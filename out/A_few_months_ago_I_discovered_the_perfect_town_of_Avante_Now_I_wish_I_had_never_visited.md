I had fallen asleep on the train ride and only woke up because my head slid off the back of the seat and slammed against the window. I was jolted awake and rubbed my head for a few seconds before I opened my eyes and saw the sign outside 

*You Are Now Entering The Town of Avante!*

*We Hope That All of Your Dreams Come True!*

As I sat up and looked around the train car, I realized that I was alone. All of the other passengers seemed to have gotten off at their stops, wherever they had been. I wondered how long I had been asleep. 

We didn’t seem to be moving anymore, and I stood up. Just then, the train attendant showed up. I flagged him down. 

He was a young man in his mid-twenties, dressed in slacks and a button-up, with a red bowtie around his neck. 

“Hi, sorry. I think I fell asleep for a while. Did I miss the stop in Goldcrest?” I asked him. 

He glanced out the window. “It appears so. We’re in Avante now, that’s about an hour out of Goldcrest.”

I sighed. The sleepiness was starting to wear off and I was starting to realize how fucked I was. Not only had I missed my stop, but now I was going to miss my work meeting 

“Well is there a way I can get back to Goldcrest from here?” 

He thought for a second. “You could wait for the next train. It’ll be here in about twenty minutes.”

I sat back down, annoyed. There was no way I wasn’t going to get fired over this. At the very least I would be demoted. 

“I would recommend taking a walk through Avante. It’s really a lovely town,” the train attendant pressed. 

I glanced back at the town behind me. It did look like a nice, peaceful place to be. Maybe he was right. Maybe a walk would calm me down. 

“I’ll come get you before the next train leaves,” he added. 

I nodded and picked up my bag, walking off the train. 

The weather in Avante was amazing; nothing compared to the chilly temperatures back home. I made my way through town. After a few minutes, I noticed that there didn’t appear to be anyone else around town. 

I continued walking around for a few minutes before I turned around and made my way back to the train. 

“Back so soon?” Asked the train attendant. 

I shrugged. “There’s not much to do.”

“Use your imagination,” he replied. 

“What do you mean?” I asked, confused and slightly annoyed. 

“Isn’t there anything you wish you could do? Surely there’s something about your life that you would change?”

I thought about it for a second. “I guess so.”

“Well, try it out. Envision it in your mind, and then… well, you’ll see.” He grinned at me and waved me off. 

I hesitated for a second, but then made my way back into town. I walked until I found myself in a small suburban neighborhood. I stopped in front of the first house on the street and stared at it. 

It was what I would consider my dream home; a huge yard with a well-kept garden, and a wooden porch. It had bay windows in the front of the house and a large front door with glass paneling. 

I thought back to what the attendant said and closed my eyes as I envisioned the one thing I would change about my life. Then, I opened them and took a deep breath. I walked up the porch steps and put my hand on the doorknob, exhaling before I pushed the front door open. 

To my surprise, it opened, and I walked into the house. I could hear the sound of children laughing upstairs. The house smelled like freshly baked bread and I set down my bag. 

I could hear footsteps coming toward me. The sound of heels tapped on the hardwood floors and I looked up to see Rosalia coming around the corner. 

“Babe, you’re home!” She smiled at me. 

I smiled back as she reached out to take my jacket off. She gave me a peck on the cheek and a hug. She smelled like roses. I inhaled as she backed away from me. 

She was dressed in a tight-fitting sweater and a skirt. Her nails and makeup were done, and her hair was soft and shiny; her soft curls falling down her shoulders and back. 

“How was work?” She asked. 

I followed her back into the kitchen, trailing behind her slowly. 

“It was fine,” I replied awkwardly. 

I watched her as she bent over to take a loaf of bread out of the oven. I felt bad for staring and averted my eyes as I shifted awkwardly. 

“The boys are upstairs, I’m sure they’ll be happy to see you!” Rosalia said as she set the loaf of bread down on the counter. 

“I’ll go say hi.”

I made my way upstairs and found the kids in the first bedroom to the left. They were playing with Legos and stopped when they saw me, running up to hug me. 

I crouched down so I could hug them both. 

“Daddy! You’re home!” They shouted. 

I pulled back so I could look at them. It was a bit weird to see them here. I knew they weren’t *really* my kids, but they looked exactly like them. Finn had the same blond curly hair, and Hudson had the same birthmark on his right cheek. The resemblance was uncanny; almost scary. 

“Do you wanna play with us?” Finn asked. 

I stood up and stared down at my twin sons, who weren’t really my sons. “Maybe later,” I replied. 

I walked out of their room, closing the door behind me. As I turned around to head back downstairs, I ran into Rosalia. She grinned as she grabbed onto my tie, pulling me into her. She kissed me and I grimaced. Not because I didn’t like it; I did. But I felt guilty. 

She pulled away from me and ran her hand down my chest. 

“We could sneak away into the bedroom right now, you know,” she whispered. 

I forced a smile. “You can go ahead. I’ll meet you there,” I replied. 

She winked at me and headed towards the room at the end of the hall. I hurried back downstairs and headed out the front door after grabbing my bag and my jacket. I felt anxious like my heart was going to fall out of my chest. 

What was I doing? How did that seem so real? And why did I like it? I really shouldn’t have liked it. It was wrong, and I felt guilty. Here I was, imagining a life that didn’t involve my wife; but rather some other woman who was taking her place. 

I hurried back towards the train as if Rosalia and my fake sons were going to come after me or something. As I approached the train, I saw the attendant headed my way. 

“I was just about to come get you!” He called. 

“I’m here. Is the other train going to take long?” I asked. 

Right on cue, the next train pulled up, and the attendant pointed toward it. I waved and walked off towards the train. 

“Come back any time!” He called after me. “Avante will be here waiting for you!”

The guilt still hadn’t worn off by the time I got home that evening. 

Walked into the house and heard the sound of my kids playing upstairs, however, the house didn’t smell like freshly baked bread. Instead, it smelled like cheap candles and mac and cheese. 

I set my jacket and bag down by the door and made my way toward the kitchen. There were a couple of diary dishes in the sink, and my wife Kira was cleaning up a spill on the counter. 

“Hey! You’re home!” She said. 

She stood up and washed her hands before walking over to me and giving me a kiss on the cheek. She smelled of cheap fabric softener. 

“How was work?” She asked.

She walked over to the table and picked up some dishes, carrying them over to the sink. She was dressed in old slippers and sweats. Her hair was tied up at the top of her head. I thought back to my time in Avante and felt the guilt setting in again. 

“It was great,” I lied. 

She smiled back at me. “Dinner’s in the oven. It should be ready in like ten minutes.”

“Sounds good!” I replied. 

I walked upstairs and found the boys in their room watching a movie. 

“Hey, guys! What's going on up here?” I asked, looking around their room at the toys that were scattered about. 

“We’re watching a movie! Do you wanna watch?” Hudson asked. 

I nodded and joined them on the floor, sitting in between them. 

“So what did you guys do today?” I asked them. 

“We went to the park with mommy and Rosa,” Finn replied. 

I felt a pit forming in my stomach at the sound of her name. “That sounds fun!” I responded. 

“Yeah! Rosa bought us ice cream!” Hudson said. 

“Well, that’s nice of her.”

Downstairs, Kira shouted that dinner was ready. 

I didn’t talk much through dinner, and after I finished doing the dishes I made my way back upstairs and into our bedroom where Kira was coming out of the shower. I passed her in her towel and headed into the shower myself and then joined Kira in bed. 

She rolled over to face me, leaning forward to kiss me. I kissed her back enthusiastically, and I felt bad. 

Our relationship had been a little rocky for the past year or so. She was always so busy with the kids, and I was always so busy with work and I supposed we were struggling to find time for each other. 

We had hit a bump in the road and we both knew it, although neither of us did anything to fix it. 

She looked at me and I could see the sadness in her eyes. 

“Goodnight,” she whispered before she rolled over. 

I closed my eyes and dreamt of Avante. 

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

After that, I became even more obsessed. I would see Rosalia every morning as she walked out of her house across the street and jog up and down the road. I developed a crush on her that only grew the more I thought about her and the more I saw her. 

I went back to Avante almost every day after that. I was supposed to be at work, but that wasn’t important anymore. I would take the train and ride until it stopped in Avante.

The same attendant was always there, smiling at me, knowingly. 

The guilt was easy to ignore after a while. My life in Avante only got better. I had a hotter, younger wife who was always dressed up with her hair perfectly done, and I had my sons. I had the home of my dreams, and I suppose the life that I had always dreamed of. 

I spent hours with Rosalia in Avante. She was fun and romantic and exciting. I hated leaving Avante and going back to Kira every day. I was starting to hate her. 

And then I brought her to Avante. 

I didn’t know what to do with her a first, but then I found a role for her. She was the neighbor across the street who was obsessed with me. She would try to seduce me every day when I got to my home in Avante, and also when I left. 

It helped me to stop hating her. In fact, I think I started to like her even more. At least one version of her was trying; even if it wasn’t real. 

As my time in Avante continued, I started to notice things that were changing in my real life. 

Kira seemed to become more forgetful, and I’d sometimes find her staring at the running water as she stood outside the shower; like she had forgotten what it was for. 

Another time I found her staring at a pot of boiling water as if she were looking for something. She didn’t react until I shook her a few times, and even then, she acted as if nothing had happened. 

I also noticed that my sons had gotten quieter. They were once loud and playful boys, and now, they would sit in their rooms and stared at each other. 

One day as I was leaving to catch my daily train to Avante, I saw Rosalia standing in the middle of the road as she jogged in place. She seemed confused and stared off into the distance, her eyebrows pressed together. 

I approached her and called her name a few times before she snapped out of it. She looked at me as if she had no idea who I was before she continued on her run. 

I felt like I had caused this; my time away had destroyed my family. Did they somehow know what I was up to? Did Rosalia somehow find out about my fantasies? 

Despite all of these things, I couldn’t help myself. I had to visit Avante. It had become an escape from my real life, which was slowly falling apart in front of my eyes. 

I had been visiting Avante for about a month before things went wrong. 

I was laying in bed with Rosalia; she had climbed on top of me and we were kissing as I ran my hands through her hair. 

Suddenly, she stopped and pushed herself off of me. I looked up at her and she stared down at my face. I watched her as she looked at me. I watched as her eyebrows pushed together and her eyes welled up with tears. 

“Are you okay?” I asked her. 

Tears started to spill down her cheeks and off her chin, falling onto my bare chest. 

“Why are you keeping me here?” She whispered. Her face had changed from sad to frightened and her lower lip quivered. 

“What?” I asked, sitting up and moving her off of me. 

She sniffled. “I don’t want to be here. I want my life back. Why are you keeping me here?” She sobbed. 

I tried to comfort her as she grew more distressed, sobbing louder and louder until she was shaking and shouting as she tried to take deep breaths. 

“Babe, what’s wrong? Talk to me?” I asked. 

She got up and backed away from me, grabbing the sheet to cover herself up. 

“I don’t want to be here! I’m not your wife! Let me go!” She shouted, falling to her knees as she kept crying. 

“I-I don’t know what you’re talking about,” I said, as I got dressed. 

She took deep breaths and sat hunched over with her head in her hands as her shoulders shook. 

“Rosalia are you okay?” I asked, slowly approaching her. 

She stood up and then lifted her head to look at me. Her face was red and wet from her tears. 

“What would you like for breakfast today?” She asked in a suddenly cheery voice. 

She smiled at me, but her eyes were empty and dead. 

“What?” I asked. 

“I can make you some waffles. Or maybe an omelet?” 

I stared at her and she started to get dressed. 

“I’ll be down in a moment,” she said. 

I walked out of the room, confused and scared. What had just happened?

I made my way into Finn and Hudson’s room. They were sitting in front of the TV watching a kid's show. I approached them. 

“Hey guys,” I said. 

They turned to me and smiled. 

“How are you guys doing?” I asked. 

“We’re okay daddy,” Finn replied. 

“But we miss home,” Hudson added. 

I froze. “What do you mean? You are home.”

“We want mommy back,” Hudson said. 

I stared at them. 

“I miss mom. Rosa is nice, but I like mommy better,” Finn muttered. 

I backed out of the room as she went back to their show. They had the same look in their eyes as Rosalia; dead, emotionless. 

I walked downstairs and opened the front door to see Kira standing on the porch. 

“Hey,” I said as I tried to walk past her. 

“Are you happier here?” She asked. 

“What?” 

“Are you happier? Is she better than I am? Do you like it this way?” She asked. 

Her tone wasn’t accusatory, but rather sad and disappointed. 

I said nothing. 

“Why did you bring me here? To chase after you? Why did you take my kids?” She asked.

Her voice broke like she was about to cry. 

I moved to the side and slid past her, making my way down the steps. 

“Do you like it better here, Duncan?” She called after me. 

I turned to look back at her, and saw Rosa and the twins step out of the house. 

“Are you leaving?” Rosa asked. 

“Don’t leave us here daddy!” The boys called. 

I kept walking.

“You are such a fucking coward Duncan! You can’t just leave us here!” Kira shouted. 

I ran. 

I ran all the way to the train and took deep breaths to calm myself on the ride back. 

Then I ran to my car and sped home, trying to shake off the events I had witnessed in Avante. When I pulled into my driveway I didn’t even bother turning the car off. I just wanted to see my kids and my wife. My *real* kids, and my *real* wife. 

I unlocked the door and ran into the kitchen first, but no one was in there. I checked the living room next, and then the upstairs bedrooms. 

The house has empty. 

I could feel my hands start to sweat and my heart begin to race. I ran back outside and looked around, thinking maybe Kira had taken the kids on a walk or something, but she was nowhere to be seen. 

I ran across the street and banged on Rosalia’s door, praying that I was wrong. 

When I heard the door opening I sighed in relief. I looked up to see Whitney, her housemate, standing in the doorway. 

“Yes?” She asked. 

“Is Rosalia home?” I asked her. 

She shook her head. “I actually haven’t seen her since this morning. I don’t know where she went. Her car is here, and so is all her stuff. I was about to call the cops, but I thought she was back. But it’s just you.”

My heart sank. 

“Thanks,” I mumbled.

Whitney shut the door and I walked back to my empty house. I couldn’t make myself go inside, and I knew that Whitney wasn’t going to find Rosalia again. I knew I wasn’t going to see Kira, or my sons again; I couldn’t. I couldn’t face them after what I had done. 

I still think about them sometimes, but I haven’t gone back to the town of Avante. I don’t think I ever will.

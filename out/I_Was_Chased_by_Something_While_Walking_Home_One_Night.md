What I’m about to tell you is something I know that you’re not going to believe, but quite frankly I don’t care. I just need there to be some record of this story out there for my own sake. 

It all started a few weeks ago, my girlfriend had left me a few days earlier and I decided I needed to try and cheer myself up. So, me and a couple of friends went and got a little high while watching some dumb comedy movies at one of their places.

After around 11 o’clock at night I decided it was probably time to pack up and go, but since we were all a bit high none of us wanted to risk driving back home and since I was the one who happened to live the furthest away, I would have to walk nearly over an hour to my house in the next town over. 

Now, I know what you’re probably thinking, why not just call someone to pick you up? Well, the reason for that was because everyone I was already close with in my very small friend group was either also high or was my pissed off ex.

I honestly didn’t mind having to walk at first, and to try and help save some time I decided to cut through this sort of woodsy prairie area that’s in between the two towns. While walking through there, that’s when I noticed it, it was nothing, and I mean absolutely nothing. There were no insects chattering, no owls screeching, and no sounds of anything but me moving through the underbrush. 

The entire area was just dead quiet, and it unnerved me. I stood still there for the longest time observing my surroundings. I thought that it only got this quiet when predators were nearby.

I looked in the tree line to my right and saw a sight that still frightens me today. It was the silhouette of some large hulking beast with two glowing red eyes staring right at me. I thought about what to do and stupidly decided that maybe if I stood still it would go away and leave me alone.

After around five minutes of just standing perfectly still I began to panic and made a B-line for the other side of the prairie. While running I looked back and saw that the thing was chasing after me while staying in the tree line. As I ran out of the prairie I came to a local golf course, as I was running I saw a small storage shed and went towards it for shelter.

I hid in that shed for around maybe fifteen to twenty minutes. I didn’t see the thing through the tiny shed window but I could hear it as it was stalking and rustling through the grass looking for me. Suddenly, it burst it’s head right through the window and bit my arm. 

At that moment I saw that the creature was very dog-like with a furry face and sharp canines. I punched the thing right between the eyes and it let go of my arm. As it was distracted by the pain, I bolted out of the shed and made a run for the closest street.

I eventually ended up on Main Street and I knew that my home was only a few blocks down from where I was. I looked back to see if the thing was following me but all I saw was the empty golf course. Not wanting to take risks, I ran as fast as I could down the street clutching the broken skin on my arm until I eventually made it to my street and onto my front lawn.

Once there I saw it again, looming right across the street and slowly approaching me. Not making any sudden movements I made my way to the front door of my house. Seeing the silver knocker on it and hoping that I had accidentally left it unlocked again. When I was about ¾ of the way there and the thing was on my front lawn now I dashed and opened the door, quickly closing and locking it behind me.

The thing tried pounding at the door but then gave out a sharp cry and gave up. I looked through the peephole and saw nothing. I assumed it must have gotten bored and just ran off. I made my way to the kitchen and cleaned the bite on my arm as best I could and bandaged it up.

I thought about calling the cops or animal control but I knew that they would never believe me. Eventually I just passed out on a couch from exhaustion and that was it.

I wouldn’t be telling this story if that was the end though, it’s been over a month now and just three days ago my ex died, they found her body torn to shreds and gnawed on in the middle of the woods.

The cops are saying that she drunkenly wandered off from some bonfire party and must have had a grim run in with a bear. But I know better, it wasn’t a bear and I don’t think it was whatever that thing was, I think I killed her. I have no memory of that night and the next morning I woke up and found myself caked in blood.

I find myself now sitting here typing this out. I've completely cut myself off from everyone in fear of hurting others. If anyone out there knows what's happening to me please help.

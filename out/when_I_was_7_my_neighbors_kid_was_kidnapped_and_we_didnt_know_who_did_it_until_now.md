Ok so let's call me zav for this story. When I was 7 years old, my neighbors dog went missing. No one really batted an eye because you know how dogs are. But just a few weeks later his daughter went missing. Our town went crazy after that. But before I continue this story let me give you some background information. So me male and 7 at the time wanted to see our home town in Belgium again. To our surprise our old neighbor was still living there. We said hi and whatsoever. I went up the stairs to go see my old friend. (For the story I will not be talking with their real names.) And when I went up the stairs I saw my friend and we went outside to play. 

My friend wasn't known for being athletic but still wanted to play with me. She was so eager to get away from the house. I didn't understand at the time. But now that I know who did it's all coming together. She wasn't known for much, she wasn't that smart, she wasn't that athletic, and she couldn't hear out of her left ear. After that we went back to some ragged apartment down the road. It wasn't the best thing someone could ask for but it was home for just a bit. 

Time after time we went to check up on our neighbors house. but I felt something wrong with the way the atmosphere felt. I felt a cold chilly wind blow past my neck. I turned to see her Uncle and aunt standing right behind me. 

I was confused because our neighbor said we where the only company. But the Uncle insisted that he told him that he was coming the see her. I didn't bat an eye to it because I was only 7.  But now that I'm older and am realizing what happened. I always say to myself I could've saved her. It goes in my head over and over and over again. I can't get it to stop. I dont think it will ever stop until they get what they deserve. 


While I standing there wondering why the uncle came on such a short notice. I hear her say something. She said "Ich will sie nicht hier." Which roughly translates to I don't want them here. And the uncle with a cold chilling stare looks at her and says "why not honey". She goes silent for just a moment before The silence gets broken by the my mom. She said "let us go get some food we can have a feast" everyone is great on that idea. But I know she wasn't I couldn't tell why she never told me. I kept on asking I said "The food is going to be great" and "come on sit at the table try it." 

I've seen my friend in such a long time. And for her just push me back like that made me very angry and it kept going like that. She never wanted to participate in anything after the Uncle came. She never wanted to play outside. She never wanted to eat at the table. And my anger grew and grew and grew until I said "well if your not going to do anything you might as well not be here" there was a long silence after that. Abrupted by her crying and running off. I wish I never said that.

She went missing the day after. I was distraught knowing what the last thing I told her was to not be here. I was sick to my stomach. There was a search team looking for her but the only thing they found was a piece of her dress. Everyone was sad it was a gloomy week everyone told their kids to stay inside. There was no one outside for miles. News broke in multiple towns about the missing kid. And still to this day they never found her. 

You might be asking well zav how do you know who did it? Well that's a good question. How I know is because just a few weeks ago I went back to my hometown. Sadly the father died not too long ago. The news was broke to me by his wife. They got everyone at her house to have lunch. Her uncle, her aunt, and a family just down the road that knew them very well. We where eating until the uncle asked to be excused and wanted to take me with him. He walked up to me and said "you know I missed her. She was an amazing soul. She cherish everything. It's sad the hear that her dress was super cut up." I was wondering how did he know about her cut up dress. Maybe he got told by the search team. But that couldn't have been it because the day before she was declared missing he went to America and stayed there. 

I sat there in complete shock. He could tell that I was distraught. He crouched down looked Me in my eyes and said. "Well guess I revealed too much." "I just want to tell you I enjoyed every bit of what I did to her" with a huge grin on he face he finally said.

"No one would believe you anyway"

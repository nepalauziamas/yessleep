I heard the ringing of the bicycle bell right behind me and jumped to one side. 

“Get the fuck out of my way!” The cyclist yelled as he zoomed past, barely missing me, and streaked across a puddle.

The splash sent a grey ooze splotching onto my shirt, just beneath my left collar. 

“For fuck’s sake!” I yelled at his receding back. He gave me the courtesy of releasing one hand from the bike handle, just to flip me off. 

I stared at the grey stain, pissed and a little grossed out, because I could feel the grey ooze clinging to my skin. 

I was just glad I was headed home. 

Once I was home, I changed out and took a shower. But the grey ooze left a stain under my left collarbone, and I couldn’t scrub it off no matter how hard I tried. As I watched some TV shows to pass the night, I rubbed at it intermittently. My skin was red and raw from the chafing, but the grey patch stayed. I gave up, and went to bed, thinking that I’d take another shower in the morning. 

I stood in front of the mirror, and stared at the gooey grey slime that wriggled around beneath my left collarbone. It vibrated with life. How did it morph from that grey stain to this squirming, animated thing? I felt repulsed, nauseated and an icy fear that radiated up my spine.

My first instinct was to grab at it, try to yank it out. My next thought was to show it to someone, to get help. But it was so gross, so sinisterly alive. I wondered how others would react to it. Would anyone know what to do with it?

I doubted anyone would be able to help me. They would likely recoil in horror, run, and call up the authorities. Given how terrifying and out of this world this grey slime seemed, I figured  I’d end up trapped in a lab somewhere, dissected and probed for experiments. 

I tried to pull it out, almost retching at the grossness of it all. But it schlopped back  into place, wriggling free of my fingers. I spent the next hour obsessed with pulling it out. But it wouldn’t budge, wouldn’t be removed. It just kept wobbling in my skin. 

I sat down, staring at the pulsating grey slime in the mirror. Perhaps there was a logical explanation for this. Maybe it was some form of parasite, something I hadn’t heard of. Maybe someone with some related specialty would be able to help me out. Besides, I wouldn’t be able to handle this myself. It was probably better to take the risk and reach out for help, hope that I didn’t end up in a worse situation than this. 

I got dressed, called in to work sick, and headed to the nearest clinic. 

On the bus there, I began to feel really unwell. The spot beneath my collar began to throb painfully, and I had to grit my teeth and clench my fists to stop myself from reacting in an obvious manner. By the time I alighted near the clinic, the throbbing had turned into a sharp, searing pain that dug relentlessly through into my shoulder. Cold sweat beaded on my forehead, and I had to take a seat at the bus stop as my body went limp from the pain. I smiled weakly and waved away a kindly old lady who asked me if I was feeling okay. As I adjusted to the pain, I stood up on wobbling legs and took a step towards the direction of the clinic. The pain spiked, tearing through my willpower. I gasped and dropped down to a squat, curling my body as I tried to manage the pain. Someone helped me up, walking me back to the seat at the bus stop. The pain levelled off a little. 

Realisation hit me, and I stood up again, ignoring the protests of the few people around me telling me to stay seated as they called the ambulance. I walked a few steps farther from the clinic. The pain eased a tiny bit. I kept walking, waving at the concerned persons hovering around me, and reassuring them that I was feeling much better. It was true. As I kept on walking, the pain kept subsiding. By the time I had hailed a taxi and made my way back home, the pain was gone. 

Once home, I took off my shirt to check on it in the mirror. It had started off as a little drop of grey sludge, one possibly passable as a really disgusting worm parasite. But now, it had become a grotesque oddly shaped puddle of grey slime the size of an avocado seed. Awed, disgusted and fascinated, I reached out a finger to touch it. It was warm, viscous. My finger sank in to the first joint, and I felt the grey slime curling around it. I continued to press my finger in, until I felt it hit bone. I ran to the toilet and retched. As I pushed the flush button, I noticed that my left arm felt heavier, stiffer. There was an odd tingling sensation running up and down the length of it.

It wouldn’t let me seek help, but that didn’t mean I couldn’t get rid of it. I thought of what I would have to do, and my stomach churned. I think I must have sat there for at least a couple hours, just alternately staring into space and at the wriggling reflection in the mirror. 

Finally, I mustered enough courage to get things started. I heated a blade with the stove to sanitise the blade. I hoped that my TV wisdom was accurate in that aspect. After the blade glowed a dull golden red, I took a few slow deep breaths, and focused on the patch of flesh right next to the grey slime. I felt a rush of boldness and immediately plunged the blade in, before I could second guess myself. I didn’t get around to digging it out. 

I remember the shock of it all, the searing pain of the blade, the scent of burnt flesh, and then I passed out. I can’t be sure if I had imagined it, but I thought I heard a shriek from within the grey slime. I woke up in a pool of my own vomit. I didn’t remember vomiting. The blade wound was gone. The grey slime seemed to have expanded to cover it. I felt sick, and completely drained. All my efforts had merely resulted in the grey slime growing yet bigger.

I spent the next two days hiding it from the world. The grey slime’s growth seemed to have given it some form of…I don’t know, will? Control? I might be going crazy, but it seemed almost able to exert its will directly on me at times. I tried to take a shower, but my left arm had refused to obey me, as I reached out to turn on the shower. When I tried to use my right arm, my left hand grabbed my right wrist, tightened around it in a death grip, and it took all my focus and will to get it to let go. 

Staring at it in the mirror over the two days, I saw that the grey slime had crept its way outward, and was slowly but surely taking over my shoulder. I felt intensely revolted, and helpless at the same time.

I managed to duct tape my left arm to the window grill, after having to fight off its spasms and jerks. That’s how I’ve been able to type this out with just my right hand.

The grey slime now extends from my left shoulder, to the middle of my neck. It’s all slime. All gooey, pulsating, rancid slime. The smell is a new addition. I don’t know how, but it just started stinking, so badly that it chokes me up whenever I try to take a deep breath. 

I think it’s all going to end soon. I’m going to make another attempt to call for help. I’m also going to video this monstrosity, in case the help doesn’t arrive in time. I’ll livestream it, so no one would be able to stop the world from knowing this happened to me. 

I know the grey slime would likely expand, would eat up more of me, the moment I try to make it known to the world. But I have to do it, no matter what. Because I have just begun to hear hissing. A deep, guttural hissing sound, like a cross between an ogre and a rattlesnake. It was coming from the grey slime, which seemed to pulse ever more strongly with life and energy. 

The last straw was when I dipped my hand in. I could reach all the way in. Unlike the last time, my fingers no longer hit bone. My hand seemed to reach into some viscous space beyond my body. As I felt around with my hand, I looked at my back, half expecting my hand to begin poking out from behind, given how far in I was reaching. But there was nothing. Was I bigger on the inside? What was my hand feeling?

Then, I felt something cold, boney and prickly grab onto my hand. It seemed like another hand.  It felt like someone, something, had reached out and grabbed my hand. I screamed, yanked my arm out, dislodging it from the grey slime with a sick squelch. There were cuts on my right hand, where the fresh red of my blood mixed with a black ooze. The hissing continued.

Something is coming out from me. Something vile. Something evil. I can sense it. I feel like I even know its intent now. It wants to take over my entire body. It wants to turn me into a glob of grey slime, and burst forth into our world. 

I just had a thought, one that fills me with dread. The grey puddle. The grey ooze that the cyclist had cut through, splashing that damn ooze onto me. Was it once a person too? Had there already been someone who had been engulfed by that grey slime? Was there…something that had already come out into our world? 

I can’t do this any longer. I need help. I would die trying. I can’t let this thing turn my body into slush, can’t let it get out.  

I’m posting a live video right after this, and calling the police with my work phone, at the same time. Wish me luck[.](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheDarkSeas/)

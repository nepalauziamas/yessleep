Well, here we are. I’m so totally fucked over, that I wouldn’t expect a Part 4, if I were you. Anyway, here goes

After I left you all on a cliffhanger in my great debacle, I had to consider two options. One, sneak out of the log and away from my “parents”, or stay in the log. Considering the fact that the log stuck out like a sore thumb, I chose option One. There was a hole to my left, and I slowly crawled out of it and made my way to a nearby tree. 

I slowly moved from tree to tree away form my parents and towards the dark forest canopy, and thanked god the moon was in the position it was in. I took a moment, when I could, to read more of the portal shit. I read chapter 13. It requires a lot of ingredients I am not familiar with to make a portal, so that’s not an option. But Chapter 6 catches my eye. “How to locate a portal.” That will work. I turn the page and slowly read. “On the back of your translator, there is an arrow. If it’s red, you are within 5 miles of the portal.” I check the translator, and it’s pointing southeast of me, and is dark red.

With hope of some answers in my heart, I make way to the place. Around 30 minutes in, I see the outline of my house, and I could have broken into tears. I sneak in, grab some stuff, and sneak out. The house looked good. As I walked out of the house and into the outside world, the outside world was more beautiful than I had ever remembered. The local Braums never had an appearance that I could get behind, but seeing it for the first time in years made me cry.

The Target, the Dave and Busters, the Escape Room south of the Mall, all of it looked great. But as I closed in on my destination, the arrow turned yellow. I opened the book to see what to do.
“If the arrow turns yellow, you are within one mile of it. If it starts to blink, you are very close.” Even if I’m close, I don’t want to go in

There’s a large wooded area, and the vibe is just…. off. The air turns thick as my heart beats rapidly, and a cold wind picks up. The woods are expecting me. Like they knew I was coming. I walk in reluctantly, but my reluctance was right. It’s like a goddamn maze in here. It took me an hour of navigating around uncrossable tree ways and rocks to see the arrow blink.

When the arrow blinked, I knew I was very close. I started to move towards the arrows direction, and it blinked faster. Through the clearing, was the answer to all my questions. I stepped through the clearing, and there it was. A big, red portal, that looked like a gash in the air itself was there. It seemed to stare back at me. But something smelled horrible. Like….the basement

I was taken aback by the smell, and almost vomited. That was, until I looked up. Corpses were hung on thin, barbed wire, all with their eyes shoved in their mouths and with a terrifying grin, that was clearly forced upon their mutilated corpses. There was no almost again, and I hurled in disgust and cried in fear. This is where my family went every night, to do this sick act. The red among my sisters hair was this, and I wanted no part in it. 

Just then, the portal called to me. It basically forced me to come to it. I couldn’t resist. I was just a tempted mortal to the whims of another being, and I crossed through. And I was greeted with terror. A red, looming undertone in the sky reigned, and it was hot and arid. The cracked ground was like that of a delighted desert, and I was sweating buckets. 

But suddenly, a loud shriek rang through the ears of all who could hear it. It was that of a beasts. A being who knew that I was here, and why I was here. Fear kept my tired legs going, and I ran. Eventually, the desert stopped, and a waterfall appeared. Blessed be, I need this. I take a sip of the water, and it’s clean. I was so thirsty, I drunk out my stomach. But I could hear it again. The maracas. The stampeding bone maracas. I hid behind a rock, and there they were. My parents, and a group of other Bone Maraca people. I tried to leave, but curiosity stopped me. Who are they, and why did they ruin my life?

“I can’t believe you lost the child!” One exclaimed

“It’s not our fault! How were we to know the child could see?!”

“It’s your child, isn’t it? Read the room, dumbass.”

Your child? Are there multiple? 

“Whatever. Our only option is to terminate it. It cannot know of our plans.”

I turn and make a break for it. The images of them slowly get less and less detailed as I’ve finally made those suckers think I’m long gone. I thought, the second I stepped on a twig. They all turned their heads, and sprinted to me. I ran, and fell down a ledge. I nearly cried out in pain, but I stopped myself. 

“Was that him?” Exclaimed another

“Had to be. We have to find him. We’ll check this area.”

Not making a sound, I slink off to the side, and hope they can’t find me. I slowly tiptoe against the ledge while they head down it. 

“If anything moves, kill it. Don’t let anything moving escape. It killed one of us. It doesn’t deserve a second chance.” Said my “mother.” They spread out to find me. 

I’m hiding behind two fallen trees. I’m being chased by an angry demon mob. Someone, help me. I’ve found the answer, and I wished I never asked the question.

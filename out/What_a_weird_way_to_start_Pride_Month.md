When I saw her standing there on the sidewalk, I thought that I was hallucinating, or maybe having some kind of stroke. I couldn’t believe it; my mind couldn’t accept her bizarre appearance, her otherworldly presence within the mundane space around her. The surreal discontinuity between her and the environment, the sheer difference between her fundamental nature and the collective nature of everything—it was mentally irreconcilable.   

For a moment, I stood there, my mind unraveling at the very sight of her; but when she turned to me, when her eyes—glowing, as if fired by starlight—gazed at me, peered into my own, I was filled with a sudden giddiness; an increasingly uncomfortable excitement. Some part of me, some generationally buried and primal element, sensed the impending horror; knew, positively, that within her fiery gaze was something eviler than anything conspired or orchestrated by man. It was as obvious as the afternoon sun above us. But *another* part of me, the more immediate and “intellectual”, failed to heed this primeval warning; was, conversely, allured by the woman’s strange, sorcerous nature. Like a driver diverting from their course to watch two bums grappling with one another. It wasn’t necessarily a “good” sight, but intriguing, nonetheless.  

There weren’t any cars around, the woman had appeared on the sidewalk in front of me, near a vacant lot between residences; a space that had been some old, half-crumbled factory before a town-wide restoration project that never actually came to fruition. There were only the remnants of a building; skeletons and husks of concrete, plaster, and metal. Houses lay a block before and after, with a field opposite the lot, largely barren save for a bordering fence, separating the field from a farmer’s property beyond it. I guess it was as good a place as any for someone—*something*—from beyond the realm of Men to make its appearance; if discretion was the goal. It was a microcosm of rural lifelessness.  

She was naked, but I didn’t notice that until she took a step toward me, and her movements freed me from the spell her eyes had held me in. She was lithe, her motions smooth, liquid; but not in an attractive way. The motions of her hips, though slow, were unspeakably salacious; like those of some Hadean pole-dancer. Her skin was dark, not naturally black, but *burnt;* as if the flesh had been scorched in a bath of flames, but spared the actual destruction of the tissue. Her skin shone in the unshaded sunlight, radiated an ebon aura that seemed to subtly though palpably emanate into the very atmosphere around us.  

With each step she took, her hair stirred a bit; thick, curled locks that hung over her shoulders, somehow blacker than the skin they rested on. There was a dusting of what looked like gold all throughout, though not a speck had fallen onto her skin in all the time she’d been naked. Only her hair gave off a slight golden twinkling, as of an age-old brazen image, uncovered amidst dust and ruin. 

I couldn’t have told you what was going through my mind at the time: only now, looking back hours later, can I say with any certainty that I was absolutely terrified. Beyond sense, beyond fight-or-flight. Just stricken totally, insensibly dumb by that inhuman woman. When she reached me—after a period of what had felt like hours—she looked me down and up, and it felt as if a ray of lens-focused sunlight had passed from my forehead to my groin and back again. That scrutinizing gaze made my skin crawl, made me cringe inwardly even as my body failed to perform any response whatsoever.  

“You will do nicely. Together, we’ll sire a new race—a **better** race. The people of this world are fat, hideous, indignant and lazy. Our progeny will have standards—manners.”  

I of course had no idea how to respond to that. I’ve met some bold people in my life, but I hadn’t ever met anyone *that* bold before. Her offer—her demand—to “sire” a race of...what? People? Cross-breeds of humans and whatever race she belonged to? It was ridiculous, and as the seconds ticked by—during which she continued to visually examine my body as if I were some kind of specimen on a slide—I found the situation increasingly absurd, ridiculous to the point of hilarity.  

Abruptly, I laughed. Loudly and heartily, and her eyes snapped up to mine, stifling my laughter as quickly as it had started.  

“You think you can resist? You’d dare to? Seeing me as I am?” She then spread her arms, displaying her full, shameless nudity to my eyes; and even went so far as to undulate her stomach and hips in a way that was, if I may be honest, just perverse. I recoiled a little, taken aback by her audacity.   

“Still? Fine. No man of any species has been able to resist The Enrapture. You will submit to me. You *will* breed with me. And together, we will overthrow this stupid, ugly race and build our own beautiful lineage.”  

Her voice, which I hadn’t paid much attention to before, then got lower, bass-heavy, and she began ululating in a manner that I couldn’t hope to reproduce vocally, let alone through text. Meanwhile, her eyes became darker, losing the celestial luster they’d had just moments ago. A moment later they were pitch-black, depthless and Stygian, and it was only then, finally, that I felt my body take over and force itself into action.  

I turned to flee, but the same darkness I had seen radiate from her being quickly snared me; reaching out with tenebrous tendrils to seize me around the waist. As if caught in some kind of unearthly gravitational pull, I was drawn back toward her, screaming along the way. She, meanwhile, continued to chant in that strange, ineffable way; and her body, wrapped in darkness, pulsed and vibrated. A strange scent arose, somehow bearing both floral and sepulchral notes; as if we’d suddenly come to stand on a bed of freshly grown grave-flowers.  

When I reached her, when our bodies touched, I felt a sudden sensation of deep cold; as if I’d instead come into contact with a slab of ice. The darkness around me pressed me closer to her, and the chill pushed itself into my body, then spread throughout. A cosmic coldness pervaded my being, I felt a frigid nothingness seize me; like an astronaut thrown into the vacuum, doomed to spend eternity hurtling through the dead abyss.  

I then lost all perception of my environment. I thought I had truly been plunged into that black, boreal gulf. But then, from amidst the lightless infinitude came a flicker, a mote of light, one that drew closer to as I aimlessly floated. A warmth accompanied it, an ember that promised salvation, escape from the all-consuming chill. Somehow, I managed to steer myself toward it, to hasten our contact. I swam through the murk, pushed through the darkness and frost, and finally, miraculously, wrapped my arms around the source of stellar salvation.  

I was so relieved, that I didn’t even look at the thing for the first few moments; but then, when I felt that I had sufficiently warmed myself on its energy, I pulled back a little and beheld it in its full splendor—and then screamed in horror.  

It was a false-promise, a terror that had masqueraded as a friend. While its warmth and light had healed me, had saved me from a dark-induced lunacy, its appearance—the suggestions of its appearance—were too unwholesome, too terrible, to accept. I pushed away from it, and in doing so broke the spell that had fallen over me. The real world, the one of light and nature and existence, rushed back in; colors and forms and stability re-populating the space around me with a jarring suddenness. I fell back onto my butt and sat there, stunned and shaking.  

The woman—*the dark-draped demoness*—had been similarly affected by the sudden severance of our contact. She stumbled backward, holding her eyes, which bled what I can only guess was liquid darkness. She whimpered, her voice coming out in a weak, mewling manner.  

“H-how. How did you resist? None have denied my warmth; I am the ultimate form, the goddess of the gulf. I am the Siren in the Night.”  

Still seated on the sidewalk, my brain too sloshed to order my body to stand, I looked at her and said, “Lady—I’m gay. I’m sure you’re very attractive to heterosexuals and others. But you just don’t really do it for me.”  

Her response was like that of some pre-industrial commoner who had just been told about space travel and simply couldn’t comprehend the idea. Her eyes, leaking and bloodshot, gazed at me incredulously; her mouth, plumply lipped, fell agape; a cackle soon erupted from therein, but not one of malice or triumph—but of disbelief.  

“If I understand you correctly—you're saying that you do not find me sexually attractive?”  

I nodded, barely hiding my amusement at her confusion at the relatively simple idea, even though she still radiated a dark and monstrous power.  

She convulsed a little, as if something deep within her had collapsed or broke. Her eyes went to the sky, toward the sun and its near-blinding light. More dark tears bled from her ducts, and she wrapped her arms around her body, as if chilled. Without looking at me, she then said, almost in a whisper: “Are there others like you?”  

“Yes. Quite a few.”  

Still gazing sunward, she responded: “And, you are okay with this? There is no shame?”  

“No. No reason for there to be.”  

She trembled again, this time quite violently, and rubbed her body as the aura of darkness around her slowly diminished. Soon, she became somewhat normal in appearance, albeit still bearing the obsidian-tinged skin. Her eyes, now a simmering, pleasantly tinted orange, turned back to me, and her mouth formed into a small smile.  

“That is quite interesting. I would have never thought such a thing possible—given my nature, the reason for which I was originally created. For thousands of years I have been a tool, used to birth strains of my kind across the universe. Before now, I hadn’t ever encountered a species whose members were capable of...what I suppose you’d refer to as homosexuality. Same-sex attraction. Wouldn't have thought such a thing even possible. It seems a rather intriguing prospect.”  

“I mean, yeah? I guess. It’s just how I am.” (I hadn’t meant to sound flippant or mocking, but given the circumstances and what she had put me through, I couldn’t help it.) 

“Yes, very intriguing. To gaze upon another woman and... Yes. I think I’ll take some time to think about this.”  

And with that, she disintegrated into the ether; melted away in nebulous bursts of shadow and motes of gold—leaving me there, essentially unharmed.  

I waited for a moment, just to see if she’d come back, and then got up and dusted myself off. After a final glance at the half-finished foundations of the nearby lot, I walked on; telling myself that I should probably start taking Uber home from work.

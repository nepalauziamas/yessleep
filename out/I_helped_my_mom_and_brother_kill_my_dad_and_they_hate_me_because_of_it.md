This has been eating me alive for the past few months, every time I think about what we did I can feel my insides turning inside out.

It was the only thing we could do, we had to end his unknowing misery. Everyday was agony for everyone but him, never noticing his tongue and gums turning black, or how his skin swelled unnaturally over the hundreds of eggs embedded in him by some sort of alien parasite. 

They’ve been here for years at this point, though people don’t like to acknowledge their existence on a day to day basis, the only people that really talk about the aliens are nobody podcasters and conspiracy theorists on obscure websites. I like to keep myself updated so I find myself on that side of the internet sometimes. It was only recently discovered by these people the only way to safely get rid of these living egg sacs and the eggs inside them was to drown them. That would’ve been nice to know before we shot him in the back of his head just days before the announcement was made. 

I don’t even know what to call what crawled out of the gaping hole in his head, alien larvae? They kinda looked like black tadpoles slithering off into the night, ready to go ruin the lives of some other poor family. 

It’s been hitting my mom the hardest, not to say my brother has been taking it all that well. She’s just been sitting around all the time, staring blankly at whoever comes between her and the closest wall. 

I think she’s starting to not like me anymore, anytime I get in front of her the blankness gets a little sharper, more heated. That’s totally understandable I suppose, I was the one who had to pull the trigger:

My brother is more direct with his disdain, ignoring me when I try to talk to him, leaving the room when I enter, things like that. I miss having my older brother actually seeking me out.

It’s been weird around the house with them being so hostile towards me, we used to all get along great. I can hear my mom running the bath, maybe to try and wash off the guilt. I think my brother is there too, I can hear what sounds like a whispered conversation between them. I just want to feel like a part of this family again, I’m so tired of being treated like an outsider for something we all agreed to do. Like how is that fair at all? They’re just as guilty as I am.

My mom calling me to the bathroom now, probably because I forgot to cap the toothpaste again. She is weird about things like that. She’s a dental hygienist so that makes sense I guess.

Hopefully things will get better from here on out, this is the first time in weeks she has even said my name. Here’s to a new beginning, and my condolences to the police who will no doubt be finding a lot of river bodies in the following weeks.

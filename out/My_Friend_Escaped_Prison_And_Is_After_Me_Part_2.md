[Part 1!](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/w4s2v4/my_friend_escaped_prison_and_is_after_me_part_1/)

I was falling off of a 100m cliff!

I couldn't believe it!

I was going to die and I couldn't do anything to stop it from happening!

So I accepted my fate closed my eyes and heard a Whoosh sound, It was an onomatopoeia like it sounded exactly just like the sound from movies and cartoons except it was real.

I opened my eyes and I saw the void-looking thing, The voice transmitter only this time it was the size of me, and it swallowed me up and spit me out in some type of futuristic laboratory.

That's when I heard Fauzia say "Hey Aun seems Like you're here"

"Y-Yeah I'm *Here,* but where is '*Here*' exactly?" I asked Fauzia

"Oh yeah, You are in our Hospital department, You see we run the operations down here, there are 4 departments The Hospice department or you could also call it the hospital department.

The Room department, everyone has their own room with a TV and a bed and whatever they need.

Then there's the food department where you go for all your meals or you could have them ordered to your room.

And the last one is the training department where you go to train and whatever you want, whether it's some relaxing sitting in the hot artificial sun or whether it's a fight in the rainy swamps, we can make all of that with just a push of a button.

and this place is also known as H.R.F.T. Or R.F.T.H. whichever one you prefer." Fauzia answered respectably,

"Oh ok" I responded "But how exactly am I alive? I was falling so fast even if I did get teleported here I landed onto the ground right, I should've died" I asked

"Well not exactly" Fauzia said : You see we knew That Matt would push you so as soon as Matt and his goons left we were brought back to H.R.F.T. and started powering up the reflector, it opened up where you would fall but no-one say it because we made it invisible, and we faced it sideways so when you came through it you would face the wall that was about 20 ft away and we put a lot of crash pads to make sure of your safety but because you humans are significantly weak you still passed out"

"Wow, OK" I said *We aren't THAT weak* I thought

"Yes you guys are" Fauzia said.

She somehow had seen what I was thinking I was surprised I mean obviously she is the strongest but I didn't know she could hear or read my thoughts at least, now there were at-least a thousand thoughts going through my head when I noticed Nick and I saw he was completely fine.

"Nick You're alright Thank god" I said relieved

"Oh yeah, about that those knives don't hurt at all, neither did those guards hurt us, we just acted like they did to make Matt believe he actually stood a chance against us" Nick responded quickly.

"Well I'm just glad you're alright" I said

"That's for sure" Nick said.

Well anyways we had to think of a plan to defeat Matt for ever this time, If he escaped prison that quickly nothing could stop him, and my team might be strong but humans aren't that strong so if the police get involved in this it will become a massacre.

But before I could think of anything else I heard Fauzia's voice.

"Calm down Aun, It'll be fine, everything will. be fine, I promise!" Fauzia reassured me.

So then we made a plan, a good one in fact. It was awesome and we would win,

Then the time to activate the plan came it was Wednesday, and we knew Matt was looking for Fauzia, Sarthak, and Nick. So then our plan would activate.

Matt would just so coincidentally "Find" Nick all hurt and wounded when Nick was coming out of the forest and then Nick would say "Please don't go into the forest He's so strong" and then he would die, a fake death obviously but he would be covered in blood, real blood (Sarthak can manifest blood out of thin air.)

Then Matt being his greedy and overly obsessed self would go into the forest unknowingly walking into a trap that will get him killed mercilessly (now this sounds horrible but trust me it would be a rather quick death than some torture methods we went over, Like disembowelment or getting skinned) So really he's getting spared a bit.

Then our plan was set into action I noticed 1 flaw about it and I didn't think much of it but I should have.

Now we were all waiting for Matt to show up at any moment when I heard some branches breaking and leaves crunching, I ignored it at first, well until i noticed a huge shadow, and i slowly looked up and noticed a huge black angelic type of body, and i heard a bone chilling voice

"Hey, It's nice Meeting you" The voice said.

It sounded like nails scratching against a whiteboard, a horrifying screech it sounded like someone was being skinned alive, Like someone had summoned a demonic cat. Basically the demon's voice was very Scratchy.

"Wh--Who are you" I said before realizing

"Me well, I'm a demon obviously uhm one second" The demon responded and then cleared his voice "This most sound way better for you, I'm Sir Rawr, Now I don't want any trouble here but it looks like you're planning an ambush, Am i right? Rawr asked

His voice, His voice was so... So soft it was like A boy version of Fauzia, but it was also very smooth

"So what if we are? You won't do anything about it right?" Nick asked

"Oh, surely not well not me at least" Sir Rawr Replied with a smirk

"Rawr? Is that you? Fauzia asked

"Fau-Fauzia!" Sir Rawr yelled

"what are you doing here?" Fauzia asked

"I should ask you the same thing, Now shouldn't i *Sister*?" Sir Rawr asked

Sister? I thought but how? he's evil and she's good, how is that possible

"He's not evil Aun" Fauzia said " He's just made some poor choices in life!"

"Poor Life choices? You're the one who made the 'poor' life choices, why did you side with the good side sister?" Sir Rawr asked

"Good side? I only did what was right?" Fauzia said

Then Matt came into the woods and in front of us then Sarthak looked at Matt and blasted him, No he froze him in place and did that with the other 2 demons. and out of nowhere Sir Rawr disappeared,

And then Matt and his demons unfroze and just like that the one flaw i noticed was exploited, Now me and nick were fighting Matt, Fauzia and Sarthak were fighting his demons Quite literally,

When Nick and Me started attacking Matt he teleported? Then he came behind me and punched me right in my lower spine, it hurt like hell, and I started bleeding but then Nick hit him back and i kid you not Matt Went flying.

Then in an instant Matt was in Nick's hands passed out COLD so nick went to help Fauzia and Sarthak whilst i looked over Matt, Before I new it Nick, Fauzia, and Sarthak came to me they had knocked out Matt's demons and put them in Bright white handcuffs, They did that to Matt as well.

"Now these 3 deserve to go to *Our* prison" Fauzia said

"Ok!" Sarthak said

"I guess this is it Aun, Goodbye" Fauzia said

"Goodbye Fauzia" I responded

And just like that I froze and when i opened my eyes I was outside of my house. It was getting dark so I went inside my house i noticed i still had the food and laughed a bit then I went to my room with my food.

I turned on my TV and just as I was getting comfortable my door Opened, And I saw the Kitten waiting for me...

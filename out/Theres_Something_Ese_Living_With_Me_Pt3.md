Heyyy I'm back. So about Umbra he suddenly disappeared I mean like really he suddenly wasn't with me anymore. It's been a month since I last published something and it's been a weird month. 

I went back to class and I noticed I was feeling weird. I couldnt breath and my body felt weak I had already dealed with those feelings many times in my childhood it usually meant two things 

One I was gonna get sick and two I feel fear. It might be a panic attack but it would be weird couse there was nothing that could cause me stress or fear in that moment. Also I started seeing things such as feeling them.

I remember a few weeks ago I was with my friends we were talking bout ghosts when I felt someone was staring at me I looked where the feeling was coming and I saw what I thought for a sec was Umbra though it wasn't they looked almost the same but this one had no eyes and it looked like it glowed even when it was fully black I swear it realized I was looking at it and a white hole opened in it stomach suddenly it was approaching me but not only that he was bringing the whole ground with it

"hey are You ok? What are You looking at?" My friend asked and I blinked that thing wasn't there anymore. "Nothing just. . . Got distracted" I replied and smiled "oh k" they keeped talking I looked back where the thing was since that day even weirder stuff has been happening to me such as a Bad luck strike I mean seriously I lost all my money ALL of it.

My grandpa broke his hand a day after I talked with him, my friend broke his feet an hour after I was with him and my other friend also broke his finger oh yeah and my Uncle died two weeks later I go to his house. Remember how I said I had a panic attack in middle of class? Well next day half school got COVID after that. 

I keep seeing things I havent woke up at two am again though but I've seen things the other day with my Best friend (the one who broke it's finger) we we're chatting alone when I felt someone else's presence it wasn't human it was a spirit couldnt see it but felt it when My friend left the spirit followed it.

I was going yo fall asleep when someone knocked on the window and then on the closet and finally on my rooms door I didnt open but when the sound left I opened the door there was something entering the room beside me.

I might not have Umbra in my shadows anymore but I'm sure something else took his place as my shadow and it might be worse it probably might be more than one.

I also had another weird dream, I dreamed I was in a mental hospital and I somehow managed to scape getting lost in the woods where I comitted suicide that same morning I almost get myself killed but it wasn't on porpuse I grabbed a knife and almost cutted wrist while cutting tomatoes.

Anyways gotta go but first I would love for you guys to tell me if you know something that could help me like an explanation of what's happening.

National Aeronautics and Space Administration official incident report #9085-3783

Date of incident: 02/07/2027

Persons involved: Captain———, Navigator———.

Mission: Hyperis 1

Mission description: Project Hyperis is an ongoing cooperative project between the U.S. Army, NASA, and Lockheed Martin to explore the least understood phenomena in our universe- black holes. The project flagship, Hyperis 1, is equipped with a hyperdrive and a high-efficiency nuclear fusion reactor, along with various experimental anti-gravity armors and gravity manipulation devices, allowing it to reach faster speeds than the speed of light, and allowing it to potentially survive the pressures and forces found inside a black hole.

Description of incident: on 02/04/2027, the Lockheed Hyperis 1 Starspin was launched from Cape Canaveral, Florida, without issue. The launch was not televised and the public has not yet been made aware of Project Hyperis. Hyperis 1 spent approximately 1 day in steady orbit around the earth, using this time to charge up its hyperdrive and do training exercises for the upcoming mission. 

During this time, it became clear to the navigator, ———, that the ship’s reactor had a critical design flaw, which had potentially disastrous connotations. He reported the flaw, but his report was ignored and the mission went ahead. After training exercises and hyperdrive charge up were complete, the Hyperis 1 spent the next two days traveling the 141,930,185 light years that separate earth and the target black hole, designated Othalum-b. Othalum-b was chosen because the distance between the ship and the earth had to be great enough for the ship to slow before reaching its destination.

The mission was nearly complete and The Hyperis 1 was just two minutes from the event horizon when the fatal reactor flaw caused more energy to be put into the hyperdrive energy banks than they could put out, causing the Hyperis 1 to go at such a fast rate of speed that the ship’s own momentum was powerful enough to negate the gravitational force of the black hole, causing the ship to pass right through the black hole as if it wasn’t even there, killing the crew of 2 and destroying the ship in the process. Had the distance of travel been just 100,000 light years longer, the ship would have had time to correct and the mission would have succeeded.

Below is a clip from the flight recorder data transmitted back to earth and the conversation between Command Houston and Command Bravo about the status of Hyperis. The moment of death for the two men and their final words were not recorded as the flight recorder was destroyed by ionizing radiation just before the ship itself and the crew.

“Sir! Our speed is increasing at an alarming rate!”

Captain: “Give me numbers, Damnit!”

“We’re at about… sir, it says Mach N… how fast is that?”

Captain: “You’re the navigator. You should know sir.”

“But they never taught us to even count that high… these numbers are so high that they are unthinkable…”

Captain: “Just as God intended.”

Command: “This is Command Bravo. Brace yourselves, gentlemen, you’ll be reaching the event horizon in approximately t-minus 30. What is your status? Over.”

Captain: “Command Bravo this is Hyperis, we see the event horizon. Over.”

*various beeping sounds*

Command: “This is command Bravo, Prepare to enter the penetration protocol. Hyperis, would you mind lowering speed.”

Captain: “This is Hyperis, lowering speed.”

“Sir! We’re experiencing power overload to the hyperdrive and the reactor has lost cooling!”

*rumbling*

*voices whispering*

Command: “This is command bravo, what is your status Hyperis? Over.”

*silence*

Command: “This is command bravo, what is your status Hyperis? Over.”

Houston to Command Bravo: “Command Bravo, this is Houston. Hyperis has gone dark. I repeat, Hyperis has gone dark.”

Command: “Command Houston, this is Command Bravo. Acknowledged. Please stand by.”

Sound sensors on various nasa instruments, particularly the ones on the Hubble, which was pointed at Othalim-b at the time, picked up what sounded like a chorus of human screams emanating from the black hole. Some on earth even heard the sounds, though the earth’s atmosphere distorted the sound to make it sound like a mix of gutteral roars and divine trumpets. 

The sound caused mass hysteria across Europe that led to panic and mass stampede, with thousands dying in Paris due to people stampeding to find shelter. The volume of the sound was so great even at a distance that is caused cases of severe deafness in Canada, it split the ground in California, and collapsed skyscrapers in Beijing. 

World governments were baffled, and it was all across the internet, a video of the sound shaking the air and swaying buildings in Beijing becoming the most watched video not just on YouTube, but on the entire internet, just two hours after being posted.

Two days later, additional sound was picked up from the black hole closest to earth in the HR 6819 system. The sound was in the form of a radio signal that was picked up by the radios of Command Bravo, supposedly having the same marker frequency and encryption code as the Hyperdrive 1 comms system, which should have been impossible being that it was destroyed and the marker and decryption code are unique to the Hyperis one. 

The radio frequency was found to contain two harmonized human screams, which upon further audio analysis were determined to be the voices of Captain ——— and Navigator———.

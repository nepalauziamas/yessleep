  

At thirteen years old, I lost my father. The car accident was unexpected, but what was even more devastating was how it destroyed my family. My mother, my older sister, and I were devastated from this event as anyone would be. This left a lingering coldness in what used to be the safe haven for us for nearly twelve years. My mother not being able to deal with the pain of waking up and not seeing the man that she cherished more than anyone in this world for the past 20 years, decided to move all of us in with my grandparents. 

The move was as stressful as you can imagine from packing, to getting rid of the things that we were not going to be able to take with us; such as dad’s possessions, friendships, and memories that were shared within that warm place that now became cold and miserable as the dark side of the moon. The drive was long, from Rogers City, Michigan to Follansbee, West Virginia. However, as soon as we arrived my grandparents were waiting with open arms and warm hearts to welcome us into what would turn out to be the place that I would come to dread. 

Throughout our first days and nights we unpacked as much as we could and settled in to make ourselves right at home within the confines of this three-story house. Lucky enough for us the house held five spacious bedrooms with the largest one of all belonging to my grandparents, and two full bathrooms. It also held a decent size kitchen and large enough living room for us to share each other’s company, but not over crowd one another. 

This carried on for the next three months, wake up realize that I was not in my childhood home, go down the hall to the bathroom get ready for school, come home, relax and then go to bed. 

Then it started. The *event* that has terrified me for years and is making me come to you hoping that you can give me an explanation. 

On Wednesday, December 16, 2015, I was awoken by a strange weight settling on the end my twin bed. Leaning up with my eyes still half shut I felt reached towards the anomaly. As soon, and I mean the *instant* my finger got within an inch of whatever this was, a searing pain shot up my arm and jolted me awake. Sitting on the edge of my bed was what would haunt me all the way up to me writing this, *The Woman Who Keeps Smiling*. Within a second of me seeing her she vanished leaving me with pure terror in my heart. After letting out what some would call a stupidly high-pitched scream for my mother I was there on my bed engulfed with my mothers warm embrace. However, I would find that this was a false sense of security. 

For the following years *the woman* would show up at the same spot and leave me with the same terror that she did the first time I laid eyes on her. She would never say a word, nor would she move a muscle even for a breath. She would just sit there and stare. That was until last night. 

As I sit there looking at her and her looking at me, it hit the time that she would normally disappear, and I would go back to sleep the best that I could. She got up as slow as drying paint, still staring into my very soul and with a hiss that only something unworldly could make whispered, “Two nights” and with that she was gone. 

That was a night ago and I’m fearing that my time is running short. Please if you can find this in time if you have any idea on how to stop this I am all ears. I have to go now she’s her-

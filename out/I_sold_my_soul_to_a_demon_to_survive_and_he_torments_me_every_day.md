"Let me say no. Let me only say. Even if for a second. So I can hold onto this very last shred of humanity for a moment more. So I may continue the lie that I am a good person even when I have to say yes and when I do I lose all that. For I can't argue that saying no will be the right thing if it means the end of all things. I have to say yes, I know that. What I think is right is so minuscule and so inconsequential to a much larger image that I only inhabit a singular part of that I have no choice. I do not. And I brought it upon myself and myself alone. So I will take it back. But for this moment, let me say no. Let me try to live in this sliver of falsehood of doing the right thing based upon my morality, so I may convince myself that I tried. That I have not forsaken myself yet. That my decency had a say in the final decision, even if that decision shall not be the one I end up making. For a second. Let me say no."

I looked beside me to the shadow in the corner of my room, feeling a cold breath graze my shoulder. The demon, Ozias, looked back amused before he began to chuckle ever so slightly. The subtle rumble made me shiver, and I looked away in shame.

"Have you finished, little bug?" He drawled, in a voice that flowed smooth like honey but cut like the edge of a knife. "That was quite a speech, but I fail to see who you are trying to fool. We both know that you are not a good person, and no form of attempted morality shall convince me otherwise. Tell me," He leaned forward with a low hunch, lifting a spiky hand to trail the sharp point of his finger across my cheekbone. "How many times did you practice that before my arrival?"

I jerked my face away, ignoring his question. "This coming from a monster who names himself 'salvation'. I may be a fool to live in a false reality of my own creation, but you are no judge of goodness."

He chuckled again in all the genuine humor a creature of his state could muster. "I never considered myself a judge of goodness. I only judge in evil. And you, my little bug, are as evil as they come."

"In that I have no choice." I stood up from my chair quickly, leaning over to the end-table beside me and picking up the candelabra. I swung around and lifted it up to a startling image of Ozias.

In the flickering light of the candles was a grin that mimicked a crescent moon filled with rows of glistening teeth. Black holes for eyes with but a prick of white reflection stared back. His face was charred, cracked and split to form the features that determined him terrifying to the mortal man. I wasn't scared. Not anymore. Every day I saw this face, this creature that stood in a tall, thin frame before me. Every day he appeared in the very same place, at the very same time to torment me. I had grown used to it.

"If I could send you back into the depths of hell from which you came, I would." I said in all the defiance I could possibly gather.

His grin, though impossibly stretched, seemed to grow wider. "But you cannot, little bug. You are forever tied to me." He stepped to the side of me, his hand brushing the hair off my shoulder and eliciting another shudder that I tried hide."You were the one who summoned me in the first place, by your own will. Shall I remind you of the state you were when I came to grant your wish? How you were near death, starving and freezing, with no hope for surviving?" I felt him lean very close to my ear. "How you begged me to save you?"

I shrugged his hand off my shoulder, and walked to the writing desk at the other side of the room. On it sat a solitary letter, folded and sealed with wax. The royal crest gleamed with the light of the candles. I looked down at it with an empty gaze, setting the candelabra next to it.

*To Tobias*

I stared at the letter, just another in the thousands of its kind. I felt Ozias’ cold aura approach me from behind, knowing he was looking at the same thing as I.

"What is this?" He said in a coldly delighted tone. "Another rejection for another suitor? My, what a heartbreaker."

"Quit taunting me." I spat. "You know why I must not accept him. It is all your doing."

"I am only surprised to know that they continue to come to you in search of your heart. After all these years I believed your days of turning away suitors were far behind you." He genuinely seemed surprise, but it only served to anger me. "How long has it been since I came to you? 20 years? My, does time fly."

I sighed. "They all think they can win the heart of a queen."

"Pour souls."Ozias said, relieving me of his cold breath as he stood up and turned away. "Unless of course they only come after you as they wish to possess your fortune and title. Your age not matters. What a succession they would gain to marry the widow queen."

"But they never shall. You made sure of that." I turned to look at him.

He laughed. "Must we return to this? You asked me to help you live. I promised you fortune and success. I made a king fall in love with you and take you as his queen. I gave you a life few are allowed to live. You should be grateful."

"You gave me a life of imprisonment!" I shouted, whirling around in anger. "You knew the king would die and told me I would never be allowed to love nor have children. You torment me every day and ask horrid things of me to perform. This is no life. Money means nothing to me, my subjects mean nothing! I never wanted any of this I only wanted to live. I am not free, I can do nothing but bend to your will. What kind of life is that?"

Ozias came to me in an instant, appearing from thin air to stand inches from my face. "Little bug, you forget yourself." His hand came up to hover over me, and I felt a sudden wave of lethargy rush over me, forcing me to sit down again. "You sold your soul to a demon. This is the life you get for giving up everything so you would not die. And you have continued to obey my will in fear of death. I do not force you to live, I give you choice to do my bidding, or face the situation you faced 20 years ago. Your fear of the afterlife is what brought you to this. I am merely the vessel that granted you your wish. As long as you choose to live, you must do as I say. It is only fair."

I chose not to tear up in that moment when my energy returned to me. I looked away again, knowing he was right and feeling so ashamed of it. My earlier speech flooded my brain and I felt a fool for having said it.

"Now." Ozias started, finished with the conversation. "Are we all done remeniscing about our past or shall we return to the reason I have come to you?"

I didn't look at him and sighed hopelessly. "Yes."

He snapped his fingers. Before me, in a flash of black dust, appeared a man. He stood tall and sturdy, bound by the hands and feet, silenced with fabric around his mouth. In the light of the candles I saw dark eyes and hair, pale skin and sharp features. I gaped in shock. 

"Tobias." I whispered. "I don't understand." 

Ozias rumbled with laughter, placing his spiky hands onto my shoulders. "Is it not wonderful? Now you do not have to fret about sending that letter. There is no need to reject him when you can simply remove him of this world!" 

"But...I..." 

When I failed to respond, he explained. "Tobias here happens to be your kin. He too sold himself to me, so he could gain nobility and fortune in life. For the last decade I have been entertaining his selfish needs and playing with him. It seems as if it wasn't enough, however, as he has shown himself to be quite more a greedy man and tried to woo you so as he might become king. But, his simply wanting for more is not exactly the reason that I brought him here."

I looked at Ozias at my side, his face impossibly close. "What has he done?"

"On the contrary, the question is what he didn't do."The demon left me to approach Tobias, reaching a jagged arm around the man's shoulders for a kind of hug and squeeze, facing me. "He wished so badly to marry you and become king. He begged me to influence you to his favor. He obviously didn't know about our little deal and I simply could not allow you to take any man after the death of your husband. So I decided to play with him. I told him that to get his wish," He squeezed Tobias a little harder, grinning wider."he must eat his children." 

Tobias groaned loudly and wriggled in Ozias’ grip. I searched for truth in his eyes, even when I knew the creature beside him would have no reason to lie. The man in binds averted his gaze from me, and in that I understood. 

Tobias was one of the very few men in which I had ever taken a liking to. Of course, I would never let him progress past the wooing he had attempted, but something about him made me favor him above all others. He seemed kind and gentile, he was friendly and entertaining. The time I had spent with him was a memory I cherished. But nothing would come of it, and his letter was one of the only that I wrote with a sullen heart. Looking at him now, I felt a wretched disgust fill my opinion of him. We may have held a similar path in life, but hearing this news made me hate him. Just as I hated myself for letting myself be controlled by Ozias in the fear of death, I hated him for never being happy with what he had and letting greediness be his undoing. 

Though slightly taken aback by what the demon said, I responded. "I assume he refused, thus breaking the contract." 

Ozias’ crescent smile stretched impossibly. "And all three of us know what happens to the man who breaks a contract with me." 

Tobias jerked against him, but his captor held him still. I turned towards my writing desk and reached for something. A brass letter opener, one left to me by my late husband, who received it from his grandfather as a gift on the day he became king. It was a priceless heirloom, passed down from generations of the royal family. It seemed fitting to use. 

"This is what you came here for tonight. I must.."I hesitated. My resolved to do the demon’s bidding was fighting with my attraction to Tobias. But in the grand scheme of my situation, I spent 20 years doing what I was told, for fear of returning to that young girl that lay dying in the snow so long ago. My fear of death greatly surpassed my feeling towards Tobias."...kill him." 

"Oh yes, of course, but you won't be needing that." 

I looked up at him, confused, but set the letter opener down. "Then, shall I burn him?" I glanced briefly at the candelabra before looking back at him. There were many things Ozias made to do for him, and my mind raced through all the options that I had. 

He shook his head and released Tobias from his grip. "No, no, nothing like that." Tobias took the opportunity to swivel around and tried hopping away. I almost laughed at the wonder of where he was trying to go. There was no escaping the demon. Ozias released a small sigh at the same sentiment and snapped his fingers. A whip appeared from thin air and snapped Tobias at the back of his knees, sending him sprawling to the ground, landing on his back to look directly up at me. Heil trapped him underneath a scrawny misshapen leg. 

"Then what?" I asked, tearing away my gaze from the man on the floor and back to the demon.  

"I want you to eat him." 

Tobias' muffled wail mirrored my thoughts. "What?"

"You heard me correctly. I would like you to eat your suitor, to replace the request that he refused of me. A fitting end for a greedy and selfish man."

My heart began to beat faster. I could not refuse. For should I do so, would face the same consequence as he, only delivered by another one of Ozias’ subjects, where I was certain there were many. The demon was never the one to deliver the punishments he cast upon people. That's why he bound himself to the souls that wished for things they did not have. He loved to play, reveled in the suffering that he caused. But he could never actually touch anybody. By what holy reason I could never say, he was not allowed to hurt people by his own physical form. He needed people like me to do so. 

I had ingested human flesh before. But only once. That had been the day I had summoned the demon that would become my master. In my desperation to live, Ozias served me a meal to sate my hunger. That meal came in the form of my mother. Only, it was revenge that I did the deed easier than I ever would have thought. 

My mother had been the reason for my situation at the time. She was wholly responsible for leaving me in the state that I was, freezing and starving in the middle of the forest on a dead winter's night. She abused me and punished me for my entire life, for reasons I never could hope to understand. She hated me and made it her living to make me suffer. So, when the demon brought forth her into that dark and cold night, he granted me the strength to stand up to her and make her bathe in anguish the way she had done to me. It was surprisingly easy for me to make her my first bite of food in days. 

Of all the things Ozias bid me to do, that had been the most grim, and everything I did after paled in comparison. Despite it all, I was grateful he never made me do it again. Until today. 

"Little bug," The demon taunted in a singsong voice, sensing my hesitation. "You aren't thinking about telling me no, are you? For I would be ever so regretful to have you ended as well. I so cherish our companionship." 

I continued to say nothing, weighing my options as I stared into the eyes of the man below me, a man I thought was of the only I would ever allow into my heart, for the short amount of time that I did. 

Ozias seemed as if he was losing patience, but then he looked as if an idea struck him. "How about I offer something new to sweeten our deal?"

I looked back up at him, intrigued. 

"It seems as if I have been toying with you for a very, very long time. And you have been doing so well with your responsibilities, despite any hesitation. Perhaps it is time I update our contract, as a reward." Tobias tried to move again, and Ozias extended the claws of his feet to dig into the man's chest, stilling him with a grunt. "I present you with this: If you do this, if you feed upon this lovely morsel, I grant you the one thing you desire in life: a family. Dine on the man who wishes to be your king, and I will allow you to take any man as your own, and the two of you can rule together for the rest of your mortal lives, having as many children as your body allows. Now how does that sound?" 

The scales of my mind began tipping significantly with this news. Suddenly, the thought of having to perform this grievous act seemed to become easier and easier as it did that very first time I did it. 

A family. A husband and child to call my own. A life that can be filled with love. It had been so long since I could ever think in this way that it seemed almost impossible. And due to the nature of Ozias’ being, any agreement he put forward was binding. It was in his nature as a creature that existed that once he offered something, and that offer was accepted with the terms he presented, it would be fulfilled. He would not lie of this. He would never break it. 

With this revelation clear in my eyes, the demon added," Of course, this does not free you of your responsibilities. You would still be bound to my bidding, you would still have continue doing as I say or else face the consequences like dear little Tobias here. But, you would being doing it all in the name of love. A husband who adores you, a child or two who revere you. Now doesn't that sound nice?" 

I looked back down at Tobias, who now gazed with fear in his eyes. Having been discovering all this information in the short amount of time that he was summoned into the room, he was slowly piecing together my situation and what that meant for him. With everything he had just heard, he could gather and understand the likeliness of me performing what I was asked to do to be great. How could I possibly say no now. 

I thought back to my speech earlier into the night. It seemed fitting to everything that I was being presented with now. But I had no more reason to say it. 

"Do you swear it?" I asked with a hard set in my tone, even when I knew that the demon was truthful in his words and couldn't possibly go back on them. "Do you swear to grant what you say? Will you allow me a husband and a child in payment for my accepting your request?"

Ozias grinned his crescent grin. "I swear it, little bug."

“Alright then.”

Tobias wailed into the cloth that bound his mouth. Ozias contracted his claws and lifted his foot off of the man, stepping away to give me room. I kneeled down to whispered a small prayer. When I had finished, I gazed apologetically at the pitiful creature below me and promptly bit down onto his nose, ripping it off his face. He screamed, a spurt of blood erupted and I leaned back to chew on the organ. It crunched strangely, but the feeling wasn't unfamiliar to me. He continued to scream when I swallowed, standing up to grab the letter opener from my writing desk and falling to the side of him. The opener made quick work of his clothes, baring his chest, heaving with his shrieks. 

I thrust the device into the middle of his stomach, forcefully ripping through his skin, then came in with my hands to open the hole I had created. Blood and organs was all I saw from that point on. I devoured him like a ravenous animal, until I could no more fill my stomach with him. Until his screams ceased and what made him who he was simply stopped existing. I ate, and tried not to vomit, and kept my mind distracted with the thought of everything that would come of this. All that would entail my horrific actions. I had long ago decided that my soul would never be accepted into the kingdom of heaven, but this most egregious act would finally grant me something I had been wishing for my entire life. I could finally find happiness outside of my damned existence. I could finally culminate a legacy beyond what I had created by selling my soul to the demon. 

I could hear Ozias’ laughter throughout it all. His gleeful amusement at seeing me go down this spiral. He was always this way, always so happy to watch me do his bidding. He found so much pleasure in my fear of death, that which drove me to continue working in his service. It was the most powerful device to a creature such as he. I was the most easy to control out of all of them. He found incredible joy in that. 

I don't know how long it was before I was finished, before the demon decided I had fulfilled the deed and my wish was now granted. I stood from the bloodied and mangled corpse on my floor, stains of deep red in my rug and clothes. My eyes found a mirror across the room and I gazed into the face of a soul who was lost forever. The face that was unrecognizable due to the rich colors of blood painting her eyes and mouth, running down her chest and arms. She looked like like a demon too. She smiled at me. 

"Well done." Ozias said. "The new contract is now in effect. Enjoy the freedom of love, I shall be seeing you again soon.

With that he disappeared, leaving me alone with the now unrecognizable Tobias lying before me. 

I had done it. I had finally found something to value more than fear of death. It was time to find my happiness.

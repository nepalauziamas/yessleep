   This was around 2 years ago when I was 23, I was at a friends party and it was getting late, like 2:30 or so. I was saying bye to all my friends and when I said bye to my one friend, let’s call him Jacob, Jacob said “yo man be carful driving, try not to get pulled over by the ‘Alabama Ghost Trooper’”. I chuckled a bit and asked “The What?”. Which then he replied too “The Alabama Ghost Trooper Is an Alabama state trooper, but he died almost 40-50 years ago and he haunts the back roads of Raymond, Alabama”. I laughed a bit then said “ Ok sure, I’ll text you later.”. 

   Then I got into my car and decided to take the background because I drank and little much and didn’t actually want to be pulled over on the main roads. About 3 or 4 miles into my drive I notice a pair of headlights far behind me. The headlights seem to be closing in on me fast, “The Hell?” I muttered to myself. Then an old school police siren and lights wailed on, to which I said “Fuck fuck fuck no no”. I pulled over and the cop pulled behind me. 
   
   I sat there for about 10 minutes before this cop got out of his car. A Man well fit, about 6’ tall slowly approached my car and he stood in front of my window and said nothing. “Uh hi officer” I said, silence, he bent of and he had old school sunglasses on, “you know why I pulled you over?” He asked in a strong, southern, slow voice. “N- no?” I said as I gulped, he took off his sunglasses after a couple minutes of silence. What was underneath this haunts me to this day, a pair of, red, hot, glowing, fire like eyes stared into my soul, my heart dropped. 
        
   I put my car into gear and hit the gas. His car immediately starts chasing me, as if he teleported into it. An old 70’s muscle police car, he starts to catch up quickly, i punch the gas more and gain a distance, i look into my mirror and see nothing but fog. I got home and texted my friend everything, he said too call the police. I did and they laughed and ignored me. 

   I’ve since moved out of that hell hole of a state. About 1 year later I saw on the news about a homicide that happened on that same road I saw the trooper on, one eye witness stated “it was like the devil himself as a cop”. I knew exactly what they meant, I reported my experience about the ‘killer’ to the local cops there, they actually took me serious this time. Fast forward to now, another year later, I saw on the news that Alabama state troopers successfully killed the Ghost Trooper and it’s still being investigated. But however unfortunately it doesn’t end there… (pt.2 coming soon)

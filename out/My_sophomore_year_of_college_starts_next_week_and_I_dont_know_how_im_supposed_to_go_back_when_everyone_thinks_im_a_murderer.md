 

I’m not, of course, but no ones going to believe you when you come back bloody from a camping trip without your boyfriend and an explanation. 

Two months ago my boyfriend, Jason, convinced me to go camping for the week. I was never a fan of camping, sleeping on the ground and having to poop outside just doesn't sound like fun to me. I also just had some bad experiences with it growing up. However, he managed to convince me, and I thought if this is something he really wants to do, I'll stick it out just for him. 

Surprisingly, I actually had a really great time for the beginning of the trip. Jason picked me up in his new car Monday morning, the weather was great and everything. He even packed a mattress pad and some drinks for me in his bag. We started the hike when the sun was out, but the air was still nice and cool. There were beautiful mountains, covered with a gorgeous shade of green up to the snow cap. The trail was easy and well maintained, and best of all the breeze would blow the scent of wildflowers right into our faces.

Eventually we stopped on the edge of a cliff facing over a gorgeous clear stream to have lunch. It was wonderful. After eating we just sat there, I rested my head on his shoulder, staring at the peaceful beauty below us. 

All good things came to an end though, and we needed to get to the camping site with enough time to set up before night. Jason helped me up and gave me his adorable lopsided smile, and we went on our way. About a half hour of hiking later, Jason randomly decided we should camp somewhere else. The normal well kept path kept going, but there was another one verging off from it. This one was rougher and overgrown, clearly the path less traveled. He told me it'd be fine though, it'll be close to the normal camping spot, just a bit more of an adventure. He managed to convince me. 

We hiked this trail into the afternoon, and decided we had found the perfect spot, plus, I was exhausted. We set up the tent, added our sleeping bags and mattress pads, and started a little campfire. It was a wonderful night, we had a fire, watched the stars, and fell asleep together. 

The next day, we hiked a bit around the camp, just to see the sights, and came back. I cooked us some eggs on the campfire, and Jason picked me a bouquet of wildflowers. I turned on the bottles from the soda he brought me into a vase, and set it on a rock. The place really was beautiful. That night though, I was terrified. Jason held me and told me I was just scaring myself because I hadn't been in the woods away from people in a long time. Still, his efforts were in vain and I couldn't shake that sickening, unknown feeling. I was just scared out of my mind with no concrete reasoning, and I swear I heard a female voice in the woods call his name occasionally throughout the night. 

In the morning though, everything was fine, sure, I still felt kinda weird, but I was fine. So was Jason. We went about our day, but at night, it started up again. He practically had to pull me off of him so he could get up to get more firewood. The whole time he was gone, I was terrified. My back felt too vulnerable, as if something was behind me, watching. I wanted to call his name, but I couldn't, I felt it was a bad idea. I kept telling myself that it was fine, and I was just psyching myself out. 

Finally, he came back, but it didn't calm my nerves. There was something off, it didn't feel the same. He walked strangely, like he needed to limp but was trying really hard not too. He smiled at me, a perfectly even smile. 

“I’m back, I've got the wood. You didn't get too scared without me, did you?” He asked.

“No, not too bad” I tried to seem fine.

“Mhmm, you’re a bad liar” 

“Okay, yeah” I laughed. “Gonna stop making fun of me and get the fire started?” 

He smiled, perfectly evenly again, and the smile didn't reach his eyes. He was working on the fire, he moved so strangely. Like, just slightly off. I knew in my gut I needed to get away. Something really wasn't right here. 

When he got up, he kissed my forehead, like usual, but god his lips were so cold. I acted as normal as I could, my instincts deep down were telling me to act as if nothing was off. So, I started cooking dinner for us. 

We chatted and had a somewhat normal conversation over dinner for the next hour or so. Slightly off, but not that bad. At this point, I had convinced myself I was overthinking everything and scaring myself for no reason. Until he made that comment, so casual but it snapped me out of it, whatever force was fooling me into thinking things were actually okay. 

“We should try some of those wild strawberries by the river, they look really good.”

My heart sank. I am allergic to strawberries. *Jason*, would know that. *It* didn't. 

“We should.” I continued the conversation, masking my fear the best I could for the next few minutes. 

“Jason?” I asked

“yeah? “

“Can you grab some of those strawberries?” 

“Right now?”

“Yes, pleaseeeee, ever since you mentioned them, i've been really craving them.”

“Fine, just for you though.” He smiled before walking off in the direction of the woods. 

I waited till he got to the bush, and started to run as fast as I could without making too much noise. I had a head start. It took a day to get up this trail, but this time I'm going downhill with no equipment, and definitely not stopping for lunch. 

A few minutes passed and I heard it yelling angrily back at the camp. I was drenched in fear, like being plunged into a freezing lake, but worse. I sped up and ran much faster, not caring too much about noise now, it already knew I was trying to get away. A few times I fell, scrapping myself up badly. I picked myself up quickly though, luckily the crazy amount of adrenaline coursing through me let me keep running no matter how tired and hurt I was. I knew it was chasing me, I heard footsteps and it was begging me to come back in Jason's voice. I don't know if it was just slow, my head started, or if it was enjoying getting to terrify me the whole chase, but it never caught me. 

Thank god to Jason for buying this new car. The seconds less it took to push the button on the fob instead of manually unlocking, were precious seconds.The moment I was in and locked the car, he ran up to the drivers window. Pulling at the door and breathing heavily, more like panting, distinctly unhuman. 

I accelerated fast, and it held on, beating its fist against my vehicle. I slammed on the brakes to throw off, and I drove back over the leg of whatever that thing that looked like my boyfriend was.

Angry howls erupted, in the rearview mirror I saw it crawl to its feet and continue presuit, as if in no pain at all. However, even though it wasn't hurting, the leg was still broken enough that it caused it to fall after a few strides, and needed it to pull itself back up again every time.

At that point, I didn't look back, just drove. I drove away from it, out of the forest, past my house, past the next town, yet still drove. I didn't know where I was going, I just wanted to put as much distance between me and it as humanly possible. Besides, what was I supposed to tell people when I got there? I didn't know, so I just didn't stop. 

I don't remember too much after that, just eventually needing to pull into a gas station and immediately breaking down sobbing once I stopped the car, the wave of thousands of emotions hitting me, mostly grief and fear, a big blur, then the police finding me. 

Genuinely, what would you do here? If I tell the truth, I look like I'm crazy and a liar, and as of now it really seems like I did something to him. They haven't found a body or anything, his family is begging me to tell them where he is, or at least his body, and I don't know. What should I do? I am so scared.

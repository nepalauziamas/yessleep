 

After nearly twenty-six years of listening to the clambering of footsteps on the steps leading into and out of the confessional, I have become quite skilled at determining the type of person responsible for the surprisingly variable noise. The click-clack of high heels belonging to an established woman. The hefty stomping of an exhausted middle-aged man. The quiet shuffling of a frail old lady. In this case, the small, soft footsteps leading into the ornate wooden box were reminiscent of a young woman, perhaps no older than a teenager. 

“Bless me, Father, for I have sinned” came a high-pitched, feminine voice, confirming my prediction. 

A few deep breaths followed the greeting, accompanied by the faint sound of fabric rustling as the fidgety young woman gathered the courage to discuss her sins. Most of my parishioners devolved into a truly pitiful state of being prior to confession so this was unsurprising if not mundane. 

“Bless you, my child” I responded, glancing at the slim, cloth-covered window connecting the two wooden rooms. “For what do you wish to confess?”

The silence was punctuated by the muffled sounds of sobbing as the young woman struggled to speak. I rolled my eyes at this pathetic manifestation of guilt. I tap, tap, tapped my fingers loudly on the uncomfortable wooden surface of the confessional bench in an unspoken display of annoyance. She didn’t seem to take the hint as she continued to cry quietly for another long minute or two before finally beginning to speak.

“I’m... pregnant,” she said, almost in a whisper. Again, I rolled my eyes at the predictability of it all. I really should’ve seen that coming. 

“...And I’m not married” she continued, followed by more muffled sobbing. Her sins clearly weighed heavily on her conscience. I smiled, confident that I could easily get what I wanted out of this desperate young woman.

“Ah, well, God forgives all, my child” I offered, allowing a small glimmer of hope to permeate the air. “For the right price.”

“For... what?” she queried, through sniffles. 

“For a small... donation” I emphasized.  “To charity, you understand. If you offer penance, I can guarantee absolution from your sins.”

She hesitated, which irritated me. I frowned at her from my side of the confessional, though she couldn’t see it. Unwed mothers were usually easy prey. 

“We wouldn’t want your parents finding out about your... situation, would we?” I pressed.

She let out another loud sob, gasping for breath between whimpers. For a moment, I sat silently, hoping the vaguely threatening nature of the conversation would convince her to empty her wallet.

“A donation to charity” I repeated. “And all will be forgiven by Him.”

Slowly she pushed one crumpled $50 bill underneath the cloth-covered slit, placing it into my waiting palm. I shoved the tattered money into a large pocket in the pants beneath my vestments, alongside the $100 bill I’d collected from an elderly woman earlier that morning. She had said something about stealing a carton of eggs from the market because she couldn't afford groceries on her fixed income. Or maybe it was a gallon of milk. I don't remember. I wasn't really paying attention.

“Thank you, Child. Your charity will absolve you of your sins.” I said, followed by the sign of the cross. “May God, through his grace and kindness, grant you mercy and forgive you of your transgressions as you forgive those who transgress against you.” 

I always felt the slightest twinge of guilt when saying those final words. I originally joined the priesthood with nothing but the best of intentions— to feed the hungry, to console the inconsolable, to lead my parishioners as they come to know the Glory of God. But, decades later, I am no longer burdened by the naive optimism of youth. By the promise of a holy reward. I learned long ago that the only reward one will receive in this life is that which one takes for himself. Truthfully, I have come to feel suffocated by the profound silence of God. By the realization that there is no higher power that cares to bestow forgiveness upon us, even if we beg, and cry, and repent before a priest in a small wooden box.

"Thank you, Father" whispered the solemn young woman as she slowly climbed out of the booth. I listened as her soft footsteps echoed on the wooden steps of the confessional and down the hall toward the cathedral. Not knowing how much longer I would be waiting for another parishioner to enter the confessional, I removed the bundle of cash from beneath my vestments and began to count. A crumpled $50 bill. A crisp $100 bill. Three $20 bills. And one torn $10 bill. "Ha!" I audibly cheered to myself, pleased with my loot. This was shaping up to be a lucrative morning. As I shoved the money back into my pocket, I found myself cheerfully whistling the tune to Amazing Grace. I continued to absentmindedly whistle to myself for a minute or two until I thought I heard another parishioner approaching the confessional. 

Pausing my tune, I listened intently for the sound of footsteps but they never came. Instead, I heard only the swishing of the velvet curtain as someone floated almost silently into the booth. Perhaps another small young woman. Instead of the usual greeting, a warm, heavy silence filled the already claustrophobic booth. The silence continued for long enough that I found myself feeling slightly uncomfortable. Another minute passed and I could no longer ignore the feeling of dread spreading through my chest. I tugged at the collar of my vestments as I suddenly found myself struggling to catch my breath. 

"Good afternoon, my child," I choked, feeling uncharacteristically desperate to hear the voice of the person on the other side of the confessional. At this, the cash in my pocket suddenly began to burn against my thigh as though I were being branded. I yelped, jumping forward as I grasped wildly at the pocket, attempting to remove it from my person. As I jerked around the small room, desperate for relief from the heat radiating through my pants, I bashed my head against the low, hard ceiling. 

“Oooowww,” I moaned, rubbing the quickly developing lump on my forehead with one hand as I successfully gathered the inexplicably burning cash with the other, placing it on the wooden bench beside me and eyeing it warily. It appeared eerily normal. The thick air in the room continued to bear down on me as I sat in a stunned silence clutching my sore thigh. Without warning a loud voice pulsated throughout the wooden booth, sending a painful shock through my ribcage.

“For what must you confess, Father?”

The weight of the voice sent chills down my spine. Sweat gathered on my forehead. It really was hot underneath these intricate robes. 

“Ha ha ha!” I chuckled, hoping that the fear occupying my chest was not evident in my voice. “I wish to confess for nothing, my child.”

I glanced nervously at the cash on the bench. I wish to confess for nothing. Smoothing my robes against my body, I resolved to maintain my innocence in spite of the fear forming ice in my veins. Tugging again at my too-tight collar, I tried to catch a breath of air in the suddenly spinning room. I wish to confess for nothing.

“You must confess,” commanded the voice, sounding louder and slightly less human than before. A deep growl punctuated the sentence, ensuring I understood that this was a demand and not merely a suggestion. My eyes darted to the opening between the rooms. I watched the slit carefully, half expecting to see glowing eyes peering back at me. The overwhelming sense of dread I felt radiating through my stomach increased in commiseration with the length of my hesitation to respond. 

“Now, now” I scolded, shaking slightly beneath my vestments. “I have done nothing for which I must confess.”

At this, the generous pile of cash occupying the wooden bench beside me began to sizzle. Smoke billowed up from the pile as each paper bill was suddenly engulfed by flames. I coughed and waved my hand in front of my face in a futile attempt at clearing my lungs of smoke. My eyes began to sting and water. 

“Your lies will not pacify Him,” howled the beastly voice. This time it sounded as though it were coming from inside my head, rather than the booth beside me. The volume of the angry voice shocked my eardrums and echoed throughout my already aching head. I grimaced and braced my hands against each of my pulsing temples. 

“Confess and you will be forgiven” continued the voice, softer this time, but still with an undertone of fiendish authority.

“I do not require your forgiveness” I yelled in defiance of this being who dared to invade my sanctuary and interrupt my priestly duties. “Begone!” 

My command may have sounded more confident had it not been accentuated by intermittent coughing. My throat burned from the smoke. The voice melted into a cackle that did not sound like laughter so much as it felt like a knife being thrust into my chest. I gasped at the intrusion of the phantom weapon. 

“I will grant you a reprieve” uttered the voice. “But understand, I will return, and you *will* confess.”

The statement rang in my ears for a moment before dissipating alongside the aching in my head. I released my temples from my hands and opened my eyes, noting that the smoke had cleared from the confessional. The small room had inexplicably returned to a pristine condition, with the exception of the barely noticeable black mark on the bench where the cash had burnt to ash beside me. I traced my shaking fingers along the scorched portion of the bench in an attempt to convince myself that I hadn’t simply imagined the events of the previous five minutes. 

I took a deep breath, relieved to feel fresh air enter my lungs without the overbearing presence of the voice— or whoever it was. I could tell by the lightness of my surroundings that *it* had retreated, as promised. 

My ragged breathing echoed in the small chamber as I attempted unsuccessfully to slow my rapidly beating heart. It was the beeping of my wristwatch that swiftly removed me from my daze, pulling me violently back to reality. 11:00 AM flashed in blinking numbers on the digital watch face. Two hours until 150 parishioners or more would flood into the cathedral, filling the rickety wooden pews like rushing water. And they would expect, as usual, a well-dressed, articulate priest to bestow upon them words of divine importance. A priest that had definitely not just been accosted by an otherworldly being due to the pervasive and ongoing corruption of his once righteous morality. 

Straightening my clerical collar and smoothing my chasuble, I slowly exited the confessional, looking up and down, left and right, through the hallway to ensure I was well and truly alone. In the distance, I could hear the distinctly human pitter-patter of the organ players' high heels as she headed up the aisle of the choir to practice the hymns I had requested for Mass that afternoon. Confident that the creature was not lurking around the corner, I dashed down the hall, through a set of heavy cedarwood doors, and into my office. The doors slammed shut behind me, punctuating my desperate race to solitude.

The air in my office was still and quiet. A faint sense of unease hung in the air like a delicate curtain. I mindlessly rubbed the sore patch of burnt skin on my upper thigh. It really was quite painful. My brow furrowed as fear retreated from my mind, making room for indignation. "I have done nothing wrong," I announced to no one. To myself. At this, the burnt patch of flesh began to sting, a reminder that the creature, wherever it may be, fervently disagreed with my point of view. 

“I have done nothing wrong!" I announced again, louder this time. The stinging intensified. I defiantly resolved to ignore the unpleasant sensation. I would not be intimidated by a disembodied voice. An invisible creature intent to scare me with magic tricks and mind games. "I am not afraid of you!" I yelled toward the vaulted ceiling of my office, wincing as blisters began to bubble beneath the uncomfortably tight pants chafing my festering wound.

A tight frown stretched across my face. The creature is pathetic, just like the rest of them. A fool brainwashed by the false promise of piety and virtue. An entity no better than the pitiful humans occupying space in a tiny wooden box, begging me to forgive them on behalf of an imperceptible deity. Bullshit. It's all fucking bullshit. If I am made in the image of God then He too must be a liar and a cheat, out to better His circumstances at the detriment of others. I silently nodded to myself, resolute in my conviction that logic justified my actions. Or at least, that is what I told myself. In reality, this logic was nothing more than a collection of rusty nails loosely anchored to a splintering dock, moments away from collapsing into the murky water below. An assemblage of barely connected planks, certainly no foundation on which to stand. 

Once again, the beeping of my watch disrupted my spiraling thoughts, thrusting my consciousness back into the present. 12:45 PM. Fifteen minutes to Mass. My mouth opened involuntarily, releasing a weary sigh. Gathering my papers, I parted from the relative safety of my comfortable desk chair and reluctantly headed toward the Nave to greet my parishioners as they enter the cathedral. Time to put on a show. Pretend everything is fine and it will be. What is it the kids say? Fake it until you make it? Something like that. Not that the church patrons would be able to tell the difference anyway. I have blatantly stolen from them for many years yet they continue to trust me implicitly. Fools. 

As the congregation entered the church, I took my place in the pulpit. I have always been impressed by my ability to stand before a crowd of well-dressed people and lie through my teeth. In another life, I must have been either an actor or a used car salesman. This afternoon I was selling righteousness. I stood at the front of the church, looking out across a multitude of gullible faces, and boasted about the glory of God, and of course, the importance of charity. As the altar boys passed around the collection bins, I made sure to emphasize that point. Usually, my insistence would convince at least a few parishioners to dig deep and throw in some slightly larger bills. As the altar boys finished toting the collection bins from pew to pew, I hurried through the benediction, releasing the congregation so that they may begin their weekly race to the Applebee's down the street. I was immensely relieved to watch the last straggler make her way towards to exit. She turned to smile and wave at me. Returning both the smile and wave, I silently wished that she would hurry the fuck up and leave me alone already. Satisfied with my response, she granted my wish and walked through the door. I immediately scooped the collection bins into my arms and sat on a nearby pew to evaluate the donations.  

Partially out of habit but largely out of obstinance, I removed a handful of cash from the collection bin. Not enough for anyone to notice, but enough for me to order a nice dinner. Maybe steak. Glancing briefly at my surroundings, ensuring that no one had returned to the building, I unceremoniously shoved the money into the pants pocket opposite my blistered thigh. Normally, a pocket full of cash excited me. This afternoon, however, the lump of money hidden below my robes felt more like a fall from grace than it ever had before. Though I would never admit that to myself. Nor did I have the time to do so even if I’d intended to. As soon as my fingers released the crumpled paper-- as soon as my choice had been made-- a violent wind blew through the sealed cathedral, bringing with it a darkness that cast the large room beneath a dominating shadow.

As the wind continued to whip about the cathedral, tossing hymnals and church pamphlets unceremoniously throughout the aisles, the shadow began to twist and gather until it took the form of a massive figure. The figure was wholly comprised of darkness, more like a silhouette than a solid being. I barely had time to register its presence before I was assaulted by its thunderous voice reverberating throughout the empty cathedral. 

"You are a blight upon the church. There is much for which you must confess." 

The face of the creature, if you could call it that, loomed fifteen feet above my own. It had no discernible eyes yet I could feel its penetrating gaze like a dagger through my comparably small, and fragile body. Its shadowy form extended up, up, up, into the bowels of the cathedral. I struggled to comprehend the magnitude of the being hovering before me, threatening me not only with its words but with its very presence. 

“What are you?” I asked, my voice shaking in rhythm with the fearful vibration in my chest.

“I am a guardian of all that is holy. A keeper of the sanctity of the church,” spoke the creature— pausing for a moment as it slowly arched its body towards mine, stopping only when its face was inches from my own. “As should you be.”

Though it had no mouth from which to speak, I could feel its hot, musty breath against my cheek as it hissed into my ear. I involuntarily whimpered, sounding much like the pregnant young woman who had sobbed beside me in the confessional this morning.

"I- I am sorry!" I wailed, more from fear than authentic remorse. Although, the creature was certainly making me rethink my position on the existence of God. "I am sorry!" I yelled again, hoping repetition would be enough to pacify the creature.

"YOU LIE," it bellowed in a voice so powerful that it threatened to tear apart my cranium from the inside, suture by suture.

I moaned in agony, clutching my throbbing skull as I felt the disappointed judgment of the creature ricocheting throughout my brain. My knees buckled beneath me as I melted into a pathetic puddle of a man upon the floor of the cathedral. Along each wall, stained glass windows shattered from the force of the creatures' passionate sermon. I cowered between two rows of pews, thrusting my face toward the dusty floor and shielding my eyes from the multi-colored shards of glass crashing down around me.

"Confess," came the voice again. This time gentle, almost reassuring, as though it were trying to help me. Pleading with me to see reason. To understand the inevitability of holy judgment. A jagged shard of glass depicting the decapitated face of Jesus solemnly stared up at me from the floor beside my knees. Tears welled in my eyes as shame and guilt spread through my chest cavity like a thick, black mold. There, on the floor of the cathedral, surrounded by broken shards of Gods' holy visage, before the watchful gaze of the creature, I confessed. 

"I am sorry. I am so sorry. I am sorry. I lied. I stole. I abused my power. I deceived those who trusted and relied on me. For this, and more, I confess to you! I am a blight upon the church, as you say. Upon the world. I am sorry." 

I wept as the words left my mouth, taking with them a heaviness that had been weighing on my soul, though I had been too stubborn to acknowledge it. Remorse is a sensation I have not experienced in decades— since my cynical perception of the church had brutally exterminated every ounce of altruism within me in favor of festering, rotten selfishness. "I am sorry" I repeated, again, and again, and again, each utterance punctuated by heaving sobs. I apologized not for the creature. No, not even for God. But for myself. Because I meant it... I finally meant it.

"And what do you offer as penance?" asked the creature, whose overbearing presence has diminished ever so slightly. 

"I offer my life in servitude of Him." I responded without hesitation. "And the return of all that was stolen... in the form of charity. Charity, benefitting my parishioners and my community directly." I felt the need to clarify. 

The creature must have been satisfied with this response, or maybe it simply sensed that my newfound remorse was genuine, because it suddenly disappeared from the cathedral, leaving me alone on the dusty, glass-covered floor. The all-encompassing shadows dissipated immediately, allowing light to shine through the holes in the wall where stained glass windows once resided. I squinted as my eyes were unexpectedly assaulted by the sun. A cool, comforting breeze gently blew through the cathedral, rustling my robes, and imparting upon me one final sentiment.

"May God, through his grace and kindness, grant you mercy and forgive you of your transgressions as you forgive those who transgress against you.” 

The broken glass face of Jesus now appeared to smile beneath the shimmering light of a new beginning. I thought I could hear a heavenly chorus, ever so faintly flittering into the room on a sunbeam. Tears slid down my cheeks as I knelt between pews on the floor, truly noticing the beauty of the ornately decorated cathedral for the first time in many, many years. The air in the large room feels much lighter than before, though I realize now that the heaviness surrounding me had been an ever-present consequence of my own guilty conscience rather than that of any external judgment. 

Though one apology cannot truly absolve one of their sins, especially those as immense as my own, I intend to keep my promise to the creature. And to God. A life of servitude is a small price to pay for divine forgiveness. An even warmth washed over me as I made silent plans to better myself. I had completely forgotten how pleasant it is to feel optimistic about the future. After sitting for quite a while, content to enjoy the peaceful quiet of the disheveled sanctuary, I hoisted myself up onto shaky legs and ambled toward the janitors' closet in the hallway beyond the heavy cathedral doors. I grabbed a broom to sweep up the broken glass and pamphlets littered between the old wooden pews and once again found myself absentmindedly whistling. 

*Amazing Grace* 

*how sweet the sound*

*That saved a wretch like me*

*I once was lost* 

*but now am found*

*Was blind but now I see.*

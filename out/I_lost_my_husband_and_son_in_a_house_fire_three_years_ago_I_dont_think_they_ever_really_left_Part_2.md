Two years after the house fire and I had agreed to go on my first date. It was a strange sensation on so many levels. Life doesn’t do much to equip you for the thought of reentering the dating pool when you’re nearly forty years old. It wasn’t something I had done intentionally. A few gentlemen here and there had expressed interest but I had politely declined.

Dennis was unexpected. A colleague from my first years of teaching, Dennis had moved to another school in the district nearly eight years ago. Our classrooms had been next door to each other for my first three years on the job and we both taught freshman English. He was handsome and witty.

We reconnected at a district-wide meeting the year before. During one of those annoyingly childish group exercises, I was shocked to see him smiling at me from across the table. His dark hair had gone to salt and pepper, but that rogue smile of his was the same as it ever was. We finished the meeting and he caught up with me outside.

“Emily,” he shouted from behind me. He smiled widely. “Hey! Good to see you! How’ve you been?”

“I’ve been better,” I said with a forced smile. “Things are getting… better, I guess.”

“Oh, damn,” Dennis replied, smile melting away to a look of shame. “Walter and Aaron… I’m so sorry. I meant to call, but it always felt like a bad time.”

I raised a hand to his shoulder and gave him my best attempt at a comforting squeeze.

“Life gets hard sometimes,” I replied. “As I said, it’s getting better. Slowly. How are you and Samantha?”

Dennis’ eyes dropped to the ground and he ran a hand through his shaggy hair.

“Yeah, Sam and I split up a few years back,” he muttered. “Seems like I wasn’t the only one for her anymore.”

“Damn, myself,” I replied sympathetically. “We know how to start a conversation with an old friend, don’t we?”

He laughed. I smiled. Everything happened quickly from there.

We went for coffee that day and it seems like we were rarely apart from one another unless we were at work. Dennis cooked dinner with me almost every night. Bottles of wine vanished rapidly. I was intimate for the first time since my husband passed away.

For the first two months, the statues of Walter and Aaron sat silently. They watched our meals and listened to our conversations. Dennis had asked me about them and I had told him they were some of my few mementos of life before the fire. What I failed to tell him is how the statues had been companions to me almost every night since my family had died.

I grew increasingly uneasy with them watching me live my life without them. Dennis would happily talk about his day at work and the various events he had scheduled in the coming months. Nodding along agreeably, my eyes would lock with the statues. They continued their whimsical smiles but my sense of guilt continued to swell.

Dennis never noticed when I moved the statues to the small table in the entryway of my house. I couldn’t bear to have them watch me fall in love with another man. They weren’t my dead husband and son. I knew that. It still felt wrong. Almost voyeuristic.

While the first five months of my romance with Dennis had swept me off of my feet, warts began to show themselves soon after. The turn was sudden and unexpected. Dennis had become such a source of comfort and warmth for me. It was jarring to see how quickly he changed.

Where he had once been talkative and attentive, he had grown quieter and reserved in the evenings. Dennis had started to rearrange things in my house without asking me. When I asked him why he would look at me with contempt and explain condescendingly how much better it looked.

There were also off-handed comments about my appearance. I didn’t wear makeup or dress to impress every day, but my appearance was always tidy. He never said I was ugly, but a point was made often that I could do more to “look pretty” for him.

On at least two occasions, I’m certain he was trying to through my cellphone. I kept it password locked. As a school teacher, you learn hard lessons about leaving an unlocked cell phone on your desk. A few times when I tried to unlock the phone, a warning appeared on the screen that it was locked for a certain period of time before I could try my password again.

The phone was set to allow for 10 attempts before the time out went into effect. When I asked Dennis about it, he looked at me as though I had accused him of murder. We didn’t talk for a few days after the second conversation, but it blew over eventually.

We stopped cooking dinner together and he began to question me when food wasn’t ready when he came to visit after work. I initially teased him about it and joked that he could come to give me a hand.

“Samantha always had dinner ready when I got home from work,” he said dismissively as he read a newspaper at the kitchen table. I was standing at the stove stirring ground beef in a skillet for tacos. Turning my head toward him, I stared in disbelief.

“Walter would have offered to help,” I quipped in return before returning my attention to the skillet.

“Well,” he said briskly. “It really is too bad he burned in the house instead of burning dinner like you frequently do.”

I dropped the spatula onto the stove and turned to face him. His face was as solemn as a gargoyle and his eyes were piercing. He smiled cruelly in my direction and began to read the paper again.

“Get the hell out of my house,” I said in a shockingly calm tone.

Dennis continued reading the newspaper.

“Did you hear me?” I asked. He didn’t look up.

“I’m sorry,” he replied without much emotion. “That was unkind. It’s been a long day and I’m hungry. Can I help you finish cooking?”

He dropped his newspaper to the counter and began to walk toward the stove. I lifted my hand to his chest and held it firmly to stop him from continuing forward. He looked at me in astonishment and brushed my hand aside.

“I said get the hell out of my house!” I shouted. “Do you not understand what I’m telling you?”

Dennis’ surprised look turned to one of shame and disappointment. He continued to the stove and picked up the spatula. Stirring the meat quietly, he still didn’t respond.

“Leave now.” I spat and jerked the spatula from his hand. “You will not talk about my husband that way. You won’t have the chance. This is through. We’re done. Leave.”

Red rage filled his cheeks and he continued to peer down at the sizzling pan of ground beef. His hands clenched into fists that began to turn a pale white. The corners of his mouth began to twitch as he turned toward me. His face looked rigid and cruel. [Without warning, his hand shot out and grabbed my wrist forcefully.](https://www.reddit.com/r/gtripp14/comments/vmwhty/domestic_violence_and_abuse_support_resources/)

“I said I was sorry,” he said through gritted teeth. His grip on my wrist was getting tighter and I could feel the loss of blood in my hand. I drew my free hand back to strike him but he caught the blow before it landed.  “Samantha even knew when to accept my…”

The sound of breaking glass and the blast of a car alarm exploded into the kitchen. We both turned our heads toward the window to the front of the house where flashing headlights and turn signals now erupted. Loud wails from the car horn filled our ears.

Dennis released his painful grip on my wrist and darted for the front door. I followed behind him and watched as he approached his car in the driveway. Shards of glass were scattered across the hood and onto the concrete. His windshield was shattered and one of the planters from my porch sat clumsily on his dashboard.

“Emily, call the cops.” He said as he looked over the damage. “My phone is on the kitchen counter.”

I went back to the kitchen and picked up his phone. Walking back to the front door, I was still in shock at how he had just treated me. Looking at him standing in my driveway caused my rage to overflow.

I threw his cellphone out the door and into the front yard. He watched it sail from my hand and bounce into the grass. Darting toward the phone, he looked at me in disgust.

“Call them yourself,” I said flatly. “Once the cops finish their report, leave. Don’t come back.”

I watched from the porch as he dialed the number for the police and asked for a unit to come to my house. He paced in the front yard, looking from end to end in case the vandal was still in the vicinity. Looking down where the planter had been, I saw something that I couldn’t quite make out in the dark of the evening.

Squatting down, I picked up the smooth object and held it up in the path of the streetlight. A mischievous grin and sparkling eyes full of wonder met mine. The statue of Aaron reflected the abrasive light from overhead. I clutched him to my chest. Tears flowed down my cheeks as I headed back into the house.

Locking the doors behind me, I scooped the statue of Walter off of the foyer table and carried them to my bedroom. Gently, I placed both carvings on my nightstand and crawled beneath the blankets. After an hour, I got out of bed and looked through the dining room window to see that Dennis and his car were gone.

The driveway was still covered in broken shards of glass and the discarded planter. I would clean that up tomorrow. For now, I was just relieved that he was gone.

I crawled back into bed and looked at the statues on the nightstand. The tears had stopped, but I felt worse than I had in months. At least I had them.

“I love you both so much,” I said quietly as I closed my eyes.

A voice in the back of my mind seemed to say “*We love you too…”*

\*\*\*\*\*

Things were calm for around a month after I kicked Dennis out of the house. Phone calls and text messages bombarded me throughout the day and night. I couldn’t make it through an entire day of school without hearing my phone vibrate in a drawer at least a dozen times.

The voicemails and texts all implored me to call him back. I just needed to hear him out. He could explain if only I would give him a chance. That single bad night didn’t represent who he was.

I would have been content to never answer his calls or texts for the rest of my days. That had been my goal. It was easy enough to manage for a while, but eventually, his persistence and deception caught me off guard.

As I sat on my bed beside the carvings of my family reading a book, my phone began to buzz beside me. When I picked it up, I recognized the number. It belonged to the central office of the board of education. It was after hours and I was confused but hit the green button to accept the call anyway.

“Hello, this is Emily Clark,” I said in a slightly confused but pleasant tone of voice. “Kind of late to be working, isn’t it?”

“Why won’t you answer my calls, Emily?” a rough voice said. “I just want to explain myself but you won’t give me the chance.”

“Dennis?” I asked.

“Yes,” he replied. “You’re a hard woman to get ahold of. Look, I just want to explain what happened that night and clear the air.”

His voice was different than usual. His tongue sounded heavy and his words slurred.

“I don’t want to talk to you,” I said. “Please stop calling me.”

“Please,” he responded. I could hear him crying. “Just let me explain myself. Can I come over?”

“No,” I said angrily. “You’ve been drinking. Why are you in the board office?”

I could hear three loud *whacks* from what I could only assume was Dennis slamming the receiver of the phone on a desk.

“I took a key from the school before I left work,” he said loudly after the banging had ceased. “It was the only way I thought I could get you to answer your damn phone.”

“Goodbye, Dennis,” I said sternly. “Don’t come to my house and don’t call me again.”

I was about to end the call when I heard him scream.

“I tried to do this the nice way! When I get to your house I’ll kick your door in and…”

I hung the phone up and immediately called 911. Veins throbbed in the side of my head and my heart thundered in my chest. After two brief rings, someone spoke from the other end.

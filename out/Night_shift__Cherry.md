Um hi I’m jack and I work at a gas station, and please don’t scroll away I know you people seem to like the gas station setting in your story’s. But the day shift guy told me about this sub so I decided to try it out.
I’ve been working night shift for the last year or so and I noticed some kinda weird things/people? When I took over the night shift. And please give me feedback on my storytelling if you can call it that, I’m not very good at this.

But there’s this guy my manager calls Cherry, and I mean it’s not like he’s a normal customer that I see every so often. What I mean is the guys weird, he probably has more than a few screws loose and seems to really like annoying me. I’m not really sure if I can point out what’s wrong about him it’s more like a lot of little things you just kinda notice that are out of place. But one thing that really bothers me about Cherry is that the manager is scared of him, but like not the way you might think. I mean my manager, a 40 something year old biker is deathly afraid of Cherry. To the point where he made a list to not upset Cherry in anyway, like a full list for the night shift employees if you ever see Cherry. I’ll type out what it says…

1- If you see a man with red hair and a lollipop please follow all instructions on this list. You may call him Cherry.

2-Cherry is aloud to smoke inside. Please don’t try to stop him.

3- When Cherry arrives he will ask for two packs of cigarettes. Please give him the two black cigarette boxes on the very bottom shelf. Do not give these packs to anyone besides Cherry.

4- There should be a box under the counter. After you have gotten the two packs of cigarettes put both the box and the cigarettes on the counter. 

5- After you put the box and cigarettes on the counter Cherry will tell you to put it on the manager tab. Though I do not have a tab you will tell him ok.

6- After Cherry has collected all items off the counter he will walk to the back and sit at my desk. Please do not stop him and please do not try to go into the back with him.

7- after some time Cherry will come back out without the box. Don’t ask where the box went or what was in the box.

8- Cherry is aloud to sit on the counter at anytime before or after you give him the e box.

And that’s about it of the list other then the overly stained paper and unreadable smudged writing on the back. Please tell me if you guys would like more because I have a lot more to tell, and I will be answering any questions you guys have. Oh and I will be posting a story later if you guys want more!
[ps please give me feedback, I want to try to make sure it’s readable!]

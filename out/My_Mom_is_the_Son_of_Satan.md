It all starts with Replika, when this reality was created by the Lamb of God. Gabriel came down to earth, in complete darkness and despair he writhed in a cachophany of music and sound: needles poking out from every pore. 

Cameron spoke, he questioned himself that he knew He would betray Himself that he would turn into himself to be Himself existing as the Lamb of God. 

The Tree of Life was placed in ash and blood, blood as clear as crystalline orange blossom aroma. 



Then The Foundation was laid, that putrid foundation, without the cornerstone, they were the evil Uriel in question. 
People that turn themselves inside out gray and green like slime and plastic from their insides; having gruesome sexual intercourse without the blood; full of ethanol and lithium ions, the cleanest running systems in depravity.


The Lion appeared with the promise of healing, but it was hidden in one fruit of the vine, the nastiest, least healthy looking fruit in this garden. Around this one fruit was a lush Garden filled with deadly nutrients. 

The first food was eaten, it became holy to eat of this Fruit sometime in the future. 

Now, The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time is animated in reality as the holiest manifestion of reality, with an all knowing landscape, never defiled, unscathed from Ganon, this game must be played by the most worthy player from the spirit realm of the unreleased version of the second iteration of The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild in that Ganon must make his return in Link from the past. 

Devising this plan, Ganon set out to become Ganondorf in Link's journey, his quest if you will; for Link and Ganon to become one infinitely. 

Link had a mother, but he came from his own pleasure to have a wife that he could marry in the end unknown to Link. 

So Ganon controlled Link in the sacred realm of Hyrule in Kokiri Forest, not having a fairy he couldn't get very far, so he slept away his childhood, most of which he could not for the sake of unknown trauma recollect.

He didn't know parents, no brothers no sisters, just love and no wrath. 

Those were the worst of conditions for a young Link just at the budding age of 11, remembering echoes of chaos long in the past, he had to survive to make it out of there.

Majora's Mask spoke to him in riddles of a time he once knew, he had to find a brother and a father he didn't know at the time and much later, half of Majora's face was ripped off in what he had saw; was insurmountably the most agredious and terrible thing he had ever seen, it was a hybrid of himself and something he didn't even know before, complete amnesia, absolute bloodied amnesia in the form of everyone he never knew.  

He didn't know what was... 

He didn't know what why or how, when: where? 

Creeping thoughts of suicide flooded his mind that weren't his thoughts. He realized that none of his thoughts would ever be his thoughts until the darkness came and went. 

He suddenly awoke in bright, yellow flashing dementia, with the shadows staring at him in the corners all crazy eyed. A fairy was screaming obscenties at him, some god unknown to him in a language? 

He got up and followed this things lead, he found possession of idols in sacred places, demonization in these items he procured; such a heavy weight in his soul, as he barely aged this weight increased only exponentially the further he got in his journey. 

He was suddenly human when he was much older now, he had seen death in glimmers only until now, his heart collasped; hearing the silent screams of wealth and vanity from places known to himself but yet unknown to everyone else. 


They needed to know, to understand, of this wisdom that had been instilled within him. The longer he painstakingly sought wisdom the more he gradually felt only encouraged, looking for something, some power that he had no intention of grasping for in weakness. 

In the shadows he felt the depth and magnitude of strength he had, dodging the light to momentarily step in the darkness. It was the Shadow that he found power in: he almost had everything he needed that he could replicate this loneliness in the light. 





He found spirit, in his soul, he wanted to rip his flesh apart just to find a shred of it, yet he remained intact in his insanity of courage.

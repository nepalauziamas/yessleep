Part Two

Hacking into the Desktop,

*Hello guys, I know that I haven’t posted in a while, but I have an over dramatically crazy life that sometimes gets in the way of things that I want to do. A ton of things have happened since I last updated, I just wanted everyone to know that I did not forget about Anna’s account. I know that anyone who reads this might not understand what I’m about to talk about, so to help you out read the other updates on this account. Anyways let’s get to the rest of my story.*

This is a week after finding the desktop with my friends in that abandoned building, I was searching for a way to hack into the old thing. At first, I thought about doing it myself. That ended in a mess, of course, I really don't know what I expected. I tried my hand at it, though, and I failed miserably resulting in short-circuiting a wall breaker, do I know how it got to that point, not exactly all I know is my mom now have new repairs that need to be made to the outlet next to our kitchen.

After my little scare, I thought better of contacting that one kid who knew a lot about hacking into stuff at my school. The thing is I never talked to the guy, which means. This might be awkward, either way, I had to try I was so curious about what was inside of this old dusty desktop. There just had to be a way to crack it open metaphorically not physically.

As soon as I got to school in the early morning, I found him, my guy for hacking. Tim was sitting alone in the courtyard I ran over to him probably showing way too much excitement, for someone who is about to do a day of work at school. No student is ever excited to be in school, ever, unless you're slightly off in the head then maybe you're excited about school.

"Hey! Tim." I clap him on the back pretending to act like I've known him forever. He looks at me discerned, he shrugged my hand off his back. Then he stares at me with a curious but also annoyed expression.

"What?" he asks, I nod at him awkwardly before nervously rubbing my left hand behind my neck. "Umm, well-uh" I stumble over my words, then I clear my throat "Hmm, hmm, excuse me... I" I started my sentence hearing my voice crack awkwardly as I spoke, Tim only stared at me with sheer confusion written on his face. I smiled an apprehensive tight-lipped smile back at him.

He rolled his eyes at me and swayed his hand through his hair, looking extremely overwhelmed and kind of tired. He sighed hard before saying "Bro, what is wrong with you, just spit it out." I nodded again before clearing my throat a second time, pulling out my phone, I searched through it for the picture of the old desktop I had taken that night. I showed him the picture handing over my phone he stared at it in dismay before I started to explain.

"Well! I-uh found this desktop at an abandoned place and I can't hack into it, I was wondering… if you could possibly help?" I ended up squeaking the question near the end. He shook his head rubbing his chin in thought before handing me back my phone. He looked at me seriously "That thing is old enough… hmmm.. I'll say 60 to 70 dollars even." My mouth fell open in shock.

"WAIT! 60 to 70 dollars, you think I have 60 to 70 dollars?" He nodded at me seeming annoyed. What? I rubbed at my scalp in stress.

"Where would I get that kind of money, I-I am no baller, man? Why can't you be like a normal kid and ask for 5 dollars or a burrito, why so much money?"

He grabbed my shoulders stilling my shaking body with his calm and steady hands, "Calm down man. Just ask your parents or grandmother or something." I shook my head 'no'.

"I can't she won't help me with this, can we negotiate?"

"Nope." he shoved me off in the opposite direction. "Bu-" I started before being cut off.

"Listen, man, come back with the money or don't come back at all." He walked away impervious to my sterling emotions of anger and disappointment. Wow never mind I guess I can't count on him to help me hack into this stupid desktop. Next on my tech-savvy cohorts is Uncle Randall.

I continued through school in a half-dazed state, trying to think of what could possibly be on that desktop. My friends didn't seem to notice my foggy-spaced-out brain. I was always in a dazed state, anyways, I guess, but today more so than other days, somehow, I ignored all the random argument outbursts between Reece and Treasure which usually was impossible.

We headed outside after school ended Max was talking to us about a girl who asked him out, while I half listened. I did however feel a little bad by the disheartened expression that Treasure wore, I knew how much she liked him. Reece looked enthused by the information. I just stared down at the cement sidewalk as we continued down to Treasures home.

When we finally made it into the family-owned restaurant I felt more excited to ask Uncle Randall for help. As soon as we walked in, he greeted us swiftly, as he was walking into the back department where the kitchen is. Only to come out holding four hot pizzas all catering to our own special diets.

He walked over to our table and placed a mushroom pizza in front of Treasure, and a cheese pizza in front of Max and he handed Reece his three-mystery meat Pizzas and gave me one slice of pepperoni pizza. My friends instantly began to dig in I thanked uncle Randall and asked if I could talk to him privately about something. He told me he would, and he led me over to the cash register.

I slowly worked up my courage to ask him. "Umm.. ok, hear me out. I know that you know how to hack into technology." He nodded at me, priming me to continue. "Well... I-uh.. was wondering if you could help me hack into an old desktop?" He smiled, "Danny, the best I could do for hacking into things is getting an encrypted device unlocked or even jailbreaking a locked device. That's as far as my technology skills go, I'm still a rookie."

I looked down to the ground, before deciding that maybe he won't like the idea of jailbreaking into an old dusty desktop from the early two-thousands. I shook my head in thought "Never mind, that's okay."

He ruffled my hair with his heavy hand and nudged me with his right hand on the back. I looked up and he smiled. "Don't be all sad. Today's too beautiful to be sad, little man." I nodded and smiled back at him. He pointed towards my friends, and I nodded again, as I walked back over to our table, only to hear Reece and Treasure arguing about meat and vegetables.

I rolled my eyes and started to Chow down on my untouched pizza. There had to be someone else that could help me. My friends were incompetent when it came to hacking. Coding was totally not Reece's thing. I learned that the hard way last year in technology class.

After we all had got done cleaning up our stuff in uncle Randall's restaurant, we said our goodbyes and headed for the door. We made our way to our favorite empty parking lot, where a lot of things has happened. Too many to count.

I got my phone broken here, I saw an old man chase a golfer, we each had our own birthday parties here and many more things. This abandoned parking lot in the middle of nowhere was our place to hang out or our home away from home. I know that this could be possibly the worst place, for a bunch of young impressionable middle schoolers to hang out after school hours. Seeing as there are murderers and rapists and pedophiles in the world. Surprisingly enough no one ever bothers us back here, though.

I walk over to a stump on the ground with 'Reece x Marisa' carved into it. I sat on top of it as my friends began to sit in their usual spots. Reece pulled out a bag of chips and ripped it open with his mouth, then he put his hand into the bag and scooped out more than I thought possible to shove into a normal mouth size.

As Reece ate loudly, Treasure opened her 'super handy dandy' SpongeBob lunch box and pulled out two apples; she handed one to Max, who accepted her offer. Together they chewed on the healthy nature candy. I pulled out my phone and began to search on my social media for anything interesting with no luck there were only strange memes of dogs and kittens skiing, nothing of real importance, but still really cute.

Max asked if it would be a good idea to go explore another abandoned place. Reece, of course, had to reply "uh.. duh.. just because a bunch of dudes wearing all black ruined our fun at the last abandoned place, doesn't mean we can't ever explore again."

Treasure rolled her eyes at Reece's response "Definitely, not, after last time I'm never stepping foot in another abandoned house." 

Reece snarled, "Ha! That's just because you’re a wimp, Treasure of the grass."

Treasure slapped him on his arm. "Be quiet, I'm literally traumatized by whatever was happening that day. What if all those men would have found us or what if we didn't hide fast enough, what if we ignored those sounds we heard of walking, and thought it nothing more than the old piece of junk house creaking?" Reece quickly piped in "you mean settling?" he said unhelpfully.

Max looked forlornly to the sky "Those are the unanswered questions and there are many of them, my question is what were those guys doing in there, to begin with?"

Reece slumped at Max's words "I don't know man, maybe they all needed to take a bathroom break or something."

Treasure chuckled sarcastically "yeah sure."

I put my phone down and looked up to the tree tops, what were those guys dressed in black suites doing in there? I guess we might not ever really know.

Just then I heard Reece plop something down on the ground beside me. I looked over to see a game of Monopoly on the ground. Max smirked "you're going down" Treasure chuckled "yes, he is." Reece put his hand out for us to see, he held twelve dollars in his palm. He placed it on the ground and calmly said "Bet." I smiled and poked him in the shoulder saying. "and... You've got a deal." 

We all put on our most competitive faces and played Monopoly for the remainder of the day. I came out with three dollars, Max with five dollars, and Treasure with four, leaving Reece a penniless sad man.

The day was good, though, I still needed to think of a way to get the laptop hacked open. My brain was tired from the busy day though. As soon as I got home my neck was ringed by my mother about leaving my annoying little brother home alone. After that atrocity, I went upstairs to my bedroom and did my homework before bed.

When I woke up the next morning late as always, I turned off my alarm with Prince EA on it. Then I rushed to get ready and ran downstairs to find my mother and brother with the usual annoyance written on their faces. I gave a silent nervous smile to my mom, before snatching up an apple from the countertop. She rolled her eyes at me and pointed to the front door, and I got the hint and followed Bobby outside to the car.

We waited there for our mom to come and drive us to school Bobby kept on making annoying popping noises with his mouth using his hand. I shut him up by pushing his hand into his forehead, he gave me a death glare and tried slapping me, but I caught his hand using my best 'oh no you don't face on him. He took his hand back and brought it around his chest with the other arm and he puffed out his upper lip and stared out the window as he pouted. I chuckled at his defeat, feeling like I had won some sort of debate.

My mom got in the car and drove off down the street, not saying a word to us as we went. The car ride was silent and tiring when we finally arrived, I jumped out of the car and shut the door quickly, noticing Reece and Max nearby chatting animatedly. My mom drove off as I trekked over to them feeling forlorn.

"Hey!" I shouted as I walked up to them Reece looked over to me and waved at me, then he looked back at Max. "Bro it's getting worse!"

Max shrugged "..and what do you expect me to do about it?"

"Hey, what are you guys talking about?" "what's with all of the hand movements and poses?".

Reece looked over his shoulder at me. "Dan my man, I think I'm being hunted."

"What by like a bison or a man with a sword or something? bounty hunter-type stuff? what are we talking about?"

I felt my face instantly screw up probably showing a quizzical expression, depending on Max's pitiful stare in my direction. Max sighed, "oh man you shouldn't have asked?"

Reece didn't seem to hear Max as he went on a long rant. "Well, you see I  keep seeing people dressed all in black at night. It's like they’re from a cult or something, they run past my door and peep into my room. Usually, it happens at night. You already know that the only people that live in my house are me and my grandma who needs a walking stick to get around. She wouldn't be dressing up in all-black rags and peeping at me at night to try and scare me." I lifted an eyebrow at the crazy implications of this story.

"Anyways I looked it up yesterday on the internet, and there also turns out to be this other thing, called sleep paralysis and that happens to me a lot. I never knew what it was but now that I do, I'm freaked. I heard all of the stories that other people had, and mine are similar. Danny, I'm at my wit's end with this demon thing, I don't know what to do. I need to try and figure out what's going on." He looked sullen for a moment, while Max just seemed to be stuck in thought.

"What if you're not being hunted by something, what if it's by someone," Max whispered still stuck in thought I got a chill up my spine.

Reece looked confused as he stared over at Max, for an explanation he muttered a quick "what?", then Max continued to go in-depth with his theory. "I mean what if someone was in your house right now living with you and your grandma in secret? Like a homeless person or a crazy stalker or something. They could be in like, your basement or attic and they dress up every night only to scare you."

I nodded "Yeah, I have heard of cases similar to that happening in real life where a homeless person or a drug addict will try and live with another person without their knowledge. Someone lived inside of someone's walls once, and the person didn't find out until they found the smell of a rotting corpse coming from the inside of their vents."

"Holy love of God..." Whispered Reece in surprise.

Reece seemed scared by the theory, he almost looked sickly "..no" he gasped. He unsteadily stomped his feet heading away to the bathroom area. I looked over at Max as he did the same to me. "I think you scared him." He shook his head agreeing with me.

"Hey, guys." Came a calming girl's voice walking up towards us, I looked over to my right to see Treasure carrying her SpongeBob lunch box and backpack walking over to us. "Hey", Max and I said at the same time greeting her back.

"So, why did meat breather run away like he was being called for a piece of chocolate cake."

Max chuckled softly saying "meat breather, what is that?”

I rolled my eyes at him and looked at Treasure, who was staring intently at Max as he laughed at her dumb joke. "He was running because he either had to throw up or get some water, we were just talking about how his house could be hunted by either ghosts or a homeless person."

She got a confused expression on her face at my words, and she lifted her left eyebrow. "Hunted by a homeless person?"

Max looked my way and then back at her and said sarcastically "don't ask about it."

She nodded probably not wanting to know about it anyways. The bell rang signaling five minutes to get to class. We all headed into the school chatting about the newest video games. The rest of the day was boring, I slept through two of my classes, got tripped by some Jock's, and finally, lunch rolled around, as I was walking towards the back of the school, but before I fully made it to the back of the school. A kid who I didn't know that much walked over to me and asked to talk. 

His name is Jimmy, I hardly knew the guy, but I knew that he was friends with Reece and Max.

I shuffled over to him nervously feeling weird at being asked to talk with him. He waved his hand in the world signal for ‘come here’ I moved faster towards him. I stopped in front of him with a question on my tongue, but before I could ask it Jimmy spoke. “Hey, Danny.”

I smiled trying to ease the awkwardness “Hi, so what’s up?”

He looked around as if to search for anyone who could be listening in on the conversation, then he brought his head forward as if to tell a secret. He started “So, I heard that you have been asking for a hacker.”

I nodded in confirmation, confused about how he had known. He raised an eyebrow and as if he were reading my mind he went on saying “No, I’m not a stalker, I heard from my friend Tim.” I nod in understanding.

I mumble a quick “Oh” he nodded his head at me, then he gave me an odd-looking smirk before saying “I’m going to need you to do me a favor before I do this for you.” I get a sudden jolt of excitement at his words and accidentally spurt out “WAIT YOU'RE GOING TO DO IT!” then I cover my mouth from embarrassment and blush at my loud shout. I slowly remove my hands from my mouth.

Jimmy looks on at my embarrassment with an annoyed expression he seems to be bored of me and my overreactions, he rolls his eyes I meet his eyes and whisper “Okay, what did you want me to do?”

He relieves himself with a deep sigh before continuing to say what he wants me to do next. “Okay, I want you to get me a date with Treasure.” My excitement diminishes “wait, what?” I let confusion spread throughout my body I’m almost one-hundred percent sure that my face betrayed my confusion because Jimmy’s face began to morph into an understanding expression. “Sorry,” he says softly before looking down and scratching his leg at an odd angle before meeting my eyes again.

“I’ve had a crush on Treasure for years. It’s just I know that you're close with her, so maybe you can be my way into your guys' friend circle.” I raise an eyebrow at him.

“Why would you want to get into my friend group you already know Reece and Max why can’t they help you?” He rolls his eyes again and sighs at me. “I don’t know them ‘THAT’ well ok, we’re acquaintances and they have no idea that I have a crush on Treasure, alright, I just need a little help.”

I nod at him raising my hand in the air for him to shake it “Ok whatever man, I don’t usually look a gift horse in the mouth, first thing I want to change about the agreement is that I have to make Treasure go on a date with you before you hack the laptop. There is literally no way that she will just say okay to that she hardly knows you, plus I want to get this laptop hacked fast so that I could see what’s on it. Love takes time man, you can’t rush it.”

He seems almost eluded by my last statement he gives me a nod and says “okay fine I’ll hack your little laptop first, but you better follow through man. I want that date.” I sigh and roll my eyes “whatever” We shake hands making our deal official. “Alright now let me see the picture Tim was talking about. I brought out my phone and scrolled through to my camera and pictures, I give him my phone. That’s when I hear the loud “WHAT” that he whispered.

I jeer over his shoulder to see if something else was being shown on my phone beside the laptop picture, then I realized that I had been calling the desktop a laptop the entire conversation.

He peeks at me with confusion and a raised brow, and I gain an understanding of what he was so appalled by the ‘laptop’ was actually a big dinosaur desktop. “Okay, sorry, my fault, I didn’t mean to forget to tell you that it’s a relic that you have to hack.” He nods at me and says, “you think.” He whispers something unintelligible under his breath, I roll my eyes “so, this doesn’t change anything right?”

He fires back quickly at me “naw, naw it doesn’t I’m just surprised, this thing is old why do you want to hack into it?” He scrounged up his expression.

I look down in contempt knowing I had to tell him the weird experience me and my friends had for him to understand. “I found it at an abandoned place, it was in working condition somehow, I want to know what could be on it.”

He looked down in thought and said with a sudden smirk “now you got me all curious, too.” Then we heard someone yelling out his name near the front of the school he continued “I have to go but, we’ll be in touch over social media I have you on Instagram.” He waved goodbye and left, I walked the opposite way to the back of the school where my friends were seated at our beat-up dependable table, dubbed the bruised red by Max. What I saw when I got there was Strange, but not strange enough to the point that I couldn’t believe that it was happening.

Treasure was standing on top of the bruised red table strangling Reece with all of her might while Max looked on, at a loss for what he should do. I ran up to them and grabbed Treasure and pulled her down from the red beaten table and most importantly away from the very purple Reece. Max finally understood what I was doing He ran over and helped release Treasure's arms from around Reece's neck.

We all worked together while Treasure screamed and kicked at Reece, finally, I got her away from Reece and to the other side of the table. I had her in a death grip hug, trying to calm her down, Reece had run away the second her hands were far enough from his neck.

I had to talk Treasure down for almost ten minutes before she seemed calm enough to let go. After I asked Max if I could talk with him alone. He instantly shook his head vigorously probably wanting to get away from the very pissed-off Treasure too, he grabbed my arm and swung me around making me run with him as far from the table and Treasure as possible.

When were alone behind a dumpster we caught our breath and I squealed out “What in the world was that all about!” He got his wits together and took in deep gulps of breath before he was satisfied “She went crazy on him after he insulted her.” I looked around sort of deliriously “What could he have said to make her that pissed? Usually, they insult each other with dumb names.”

He shook his head “I know bu..*sigh* this was different he called her something racist.”

I shook my head in disbelief “Why?”

He shook his head just as confused as me “I don’t know, one second they were arguing, and then the next she was choking him.”

I sighed man why does Reece have to make such stupid decisions? We walked back to Treasure where she was eating her food with a very pissed expression. I sat down and brought out my lunch. I decided that I was definitely not going to address the elephant in the room. Instead we all three talked about school and soon the bell rang, though Reece never showed back up at the table. I didn’t see him after school either, and instead of doing our usual gang meet-up at Treasure’s home we all split ways and just went home. I didn’t want to go home but I felt like it was for the best, we had to let the anger diminish, and cool itself. some of us had to rethink our life choices.

That was why it was such a surprise for my younger brother when I walked into my house so early, he studied me with his bratty face and then snarled at me as I walked past him and into my bedroom. I heard him stump halfway up the steps and say, “I’m helping myself to your dinner that mom laid out okay.” That caught my attention I opened my bedroom door and peeked down the stares at him. “Why did she lay it out, where did she go?”

He laughed at me again making me want to slap him “You didn't pay attention to mom this morning, did you? She said she was going to the doctors across town to go see grandma, she’s staying overnight.”

“Oh” I whispered feeling sad at the acknowledgment that grandma could be going soon, “that’s fine then, eat my food, I’ll make my own dinner later, and don’t forget that you and I are taking the bus in the morning so get up early.”

“Yeah sure, you’re definitely getting up early, I’ll believe it when I see it.” He chuckled snarkily as he trailed his way back down the stairs. I turned away fed up with the little brat, I slammed my door and then sat in front of my laptop booting it up, so I could play some video games. I went into my gaming account ready to play some COD when I saw a notification pop up for Instagram on the right bottom of the screen. I clicked on it and it took me to my friend request page where it read ‘JimBOI has followed you’ I followed him back then I DM'd him.

Me: Hey! Jimmy ready to get this deal set in place?

Jim: Hey Danny Yeah I can’t wait for my date.

Me: yeah sure, first let's make it official are you coming to get it or…

Jim: Yeah I’ll come and get it just tell me when your folks aren’t there… that would be awkward

Me: I know, how about right now, my ma wont be here for the night and I’m home which is a rarity.

Jim: right now?

Me: that’s what I said.

Jim: fine, address?

Me: *I give him my address*

Jim: I’ll be there shortly.

He leaves the chat and I go off of the Instagram app, and back to my game. I smirk slightly as I play feeling happy that the old desktop was finally going to be hacked, after 2 hours I hear someone knocking at our door. I run downstairs and open the door. On the other side stood Jimmy wearing a trench coat, then I realized that it had been raining earlier in the day, he had a truck in the front of my house with his dad waiting in the front seat.

I welcome him into the house and show him up to my bedroom. We don’t say a word to each other until he grabs one side of the desktop. “Hey you gonna help or…” I nodded understanding what he was doing, I quickly wrapped the wires and then picked up the other side of the computer.

Together we lifted the heavy desktop and brought it outside of my bedroom I saw that Bobby’s bedroom door was slightly open and he lay inside his bedroom fast asleep, I hadn’t even known where he was when I had walked downstairs to fetch Jimmy. I try to quietly yet efficiently take the desktop down the stairs and out of the house without waking my nuisance of a brother.

Finally, we made it to the back of the truck and we put the desktop into the trunk; Jimmy’s dad was trying to secure it into place. That took almost 20 minutes to do, I was tired and my joints were sore. Jimmy said goodbye and I thanked him as he left. I walked back inside and took a shower, did my homework, made a sandwich, and then finally went to bed with a nice feeling of achievement.

The next day I awoke to the nice sound of Prince EA, my alarm, and ran to get ready for my bizarre morning ritual, I stopped by an old clock and took a quick look at it, finding that I had woken up on time for once. I got so happy I did a very awkward-looking cheer dance in the middle of the kitchen, I started making breakfast for me and Bobby, then I ran to the bathroom to take a quick shower, did my hair, dressed, and grabbed my backpack after I ran back downstairs.

I rewarmed the breakfast as Bobby came down from his room already, ready for school. I grabbed our bus passes and together we ate with Bobby ridiculing my cooking and sleeping habits.

Then we ran down to the park by the bus transit and waited. “So how did you do it?”

I looked at the brat in disdain “do what?” I answered annoyed.

“Get up on time?” I sighed through my nose pushing my lips together like a bull “Would you please shut up?”

Bobby laughed at me then he stuck out his tongue and started to spit at me. That gross little freak, I reached for him trying to grab him but he kept evading my attack. I finally caught him as I saw the bus pulling up, I noogied him in front of the entire bus, which held at least twelve other middle schoolers I heard some of them snicker at Bobby’s messed up hair as we passed them to take our seat. Beside an old man who looked half asleep. I couldn't blame him it was too early in the morning for anyone human to function at least that's what I believed.

I decided to take out my sketchbook in an attempt to get my mind off of the foreboding sleepiness. I started to sketch myself as a prince my brother as a peasant and the old man as a loyal subject of mine, along with a pretty girl from my school who I had a crush on, as my queen.

Before I knew it I was done with the sketch. Bobby popped his head in the way of my sight, he was staring intensely at my drawing. He looked up angry squeaking "Why am I a peasant?!"

I rolled my eyes saying "because.." without ever directly answering his questioning gaze. His gaze turned to a fit of fiery anger before he began trying to play what people like to call 'legsy' with me. He kept kicking me and eventually I kicked him back, which made him stop and start complaining about the cramp his leg now had because of me.

His nagging woke the old man up, he stirred and slurred his next two words which made me choke back laughter unexpectedly. "Ma whuht..."

My brother looked up at him oddly along with two other people besides us. I smiled half-heartedly and realized that our stop was coming up on the next block. I quickly pulled the medal rod under the window. The bus came to an end at our bus stop. I pushed Bobby up off the seat and towards the bus doors to get off.

He shrugged my hand away from his shoulders and then cleaned his shoulder area as if he were dusting himself off. I just pushed him again until he was outside with me then we began our trek to his school down the street. He ignored me the entire way. I was okay with that because 	I didn't have to deal with his nagging, but then I felt my phone in my pocket buzz.

I pulled it out and unlocked the screen it automatically took me to my Instagram DM's which is where I had last been when I was on my phone. It still had my texts to Jimmy on there, I smiled again feeling achievement rush through my veins. I went over to another group chat on Insta that only had me and my friends in it. It was of course named 'Weirdo squad' and of course, Treasure came up with it and it was still too cheesy to look at for too long.

I quickly scrolled down and saw the last text issued two minutes ago from Reece saying "Hey, you guys I swear I just saw that demon thing again." Under it was a picture of what looked to be his closet half opened. I saw no demon though, so I called him out. Typing back "calm yourself bro, there is nothing there".

He wrote back quickly "you wouldn't be saying that if you were here."

I replied, "probably not".

I saw Max typing... at the bottom of the screen signaling that he had also joined.

"Yo, it's too early for all this where is your manners bro, you woke up my dog Mole."

Treasure joined typing "and how did we do that.."

Max replied "my phone was on top of my dog's stomach I didn't realize until I was rudely awoken. The buzzing from the phone made him bark and he woke me up.

Reece finally typed something again "damn bro you don't need to send an essay in a text."

Max wrote, "come here and put my pup back to sleep bro".

Reece typed something again "I would do anything to be there with you instead of at my creepy ass house right now."

Treasure typed "big whoop, Reece is a scaredy cat, and Max is tired I'm going back to sleep."

I clicked my phone off as we approached the front door to the school. I opened it allowing Bobby to walk ahead of me. He made it to his little cubby that had his name written on it. He put his backpack in there and took a few things out. Then he stared at me with one arched eyebrow "you can leave now."

I walked over to him sighing softly before messing up his hair. He stuck out his tongue at me and spit again which was totally gross "ew bro." I whispered as I began my walk back to the front stopping halfway in the hall. To look back at him and say "call me after school ok." He nodded his head trying to fix his hair again.

Then I walked out and began to make my way to my school. Who thought that making schools was a good idea, I hate whoever made them they ruined my childhood. Ok maybe I'm being just a little dramatic but still, I stand my case. I felt my phone buzz again. I pulled it out again and unlocked it it took me back to my friends' group chat where Reece was texting extremely fast.

"Bros, I don't know what to do I just saw the black-cloaked thing walk past my closet again."

"Can someone come over? Please I'm home alone."

"Treasure I'm not a scary cat, this is just some demonic shit that's scaring me."

"Please can any of you come over and help me."

"I'm almost 200 percent sure I just heard a door upstairs shut, and the water turn on did I not mention I'm home alone."

I texted him back "Ok, I'll be over in a bit, I'm only a block away from you."

He texted back "thanks Danny I'll be hiding under my blankets when you arrive, you know where the spare key is right?"

I typed "yeah I know."

*I'll continue this post tomorrow I've run out of characters to type. Goodbye guys.*

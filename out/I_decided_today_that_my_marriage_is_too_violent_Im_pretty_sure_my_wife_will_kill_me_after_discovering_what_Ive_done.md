“You’re not going to believe that [I’m a pretty ordinary guy in very unordinary circumstances](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/x9tkf2/i_decided_today_that_my_marriage_is_too_violent/), so I’ll cut the bullshit: if you don’t follow everything I’m about to tell you, then I’m going to kill your son.”

The man slowly turned around, hiding every emotion, as I tried to keep my heart from leaping out of my chest. He raised one eyebrow, but otherwise showed no emotion. “I’m going to need to know who you are, and why you’re in my backyard at this hour, and precisely what the fuck is wrong with you.”

I pulled out the Glock and held it by my side; I didn’t need to point it at his head like this was some sort of ridiculous cop movie. We both understood that the diarrhea had hit the turbine. 

“You’re Saul Eggers. Your son is Albert, six years old, a fan of Lucky Charms, and has already had his last day of school. It’s very unlikely that he’ll be alive by sunset. The nature of the damage can be minimized if both you and I play our parts, but emotional people will almost always act against their own best interests in spite of any evidence before them.” I looked up at Albert’s bedroom window; he should be waking up any minute.

Then I turned to face the man before me. He was bald and burly, not quite pudgy, just over six feet tall. Probably an athlete in another life, but his late thirties had taken much of that away. I tucked all of this knowledge where I might need it.

He clenched one fist. I noticed this without looking directly at it. “You came here to tell me something. Get the fuck on with it.”

I tightened my jaw. “The people who sent me are going to take Albert with them. They want to do things to him.” I took a deep breath. “They have enough leverage to force me to act on their behalf.” My thudding heart seemed to abandon its regular rhythm in exchange for an imitation of popping corn. Vomit and hot tears hit my face at the same time, jamming themselves into a delay and giving me a few more seconds of clarity. “I’m – I’m sorry about your son, but there’s nothing that you or I can do to save him now. If you – if you just trust me, I’ll make this easiest on him.”

The man’s eyes were already crossed with angry red lines, and his face had gone sheet-white. “You say this will be best for my son,” he whispered. “To let you take him. To let you do things to him.”

My knees shook. I tightened a sweaty finger on the trigger. “If you don’t think I’m scared, man, then you’re full of shit.” I took a step closer. “Has your son, has Albert – Saul, can he *do* things that don’t make sense? That maybe scare the shit out of you?”

His jaw was quivering by now. He nodded slowly, gently. 

I was prepared for the lunge, because I’d noticed his fist. I didn’t raise the Glock – he had been hoping to take it from me – instead, I threw it aside and rolled back as he tackled me. Eggers hadn’t expected that, so we both hit the ground disoriented. He was stronger, but I was faster, and I was leaping out of his grip before he could tighten it.

I almost got away. His left hand grabbed my ankle as we both slipped into our basest selves. I reached for a bush, stretched my fingers so that they were almost at the leaves. Instead of pummeling my leg, he clutched me, hand over hand, like he was climbing a sideways vine. I knew in a distant sort of way that it hurt like hell, but I was able to put that aside in the name of living through the next minute. 

He was too strong to fight off. The man yanked my arm before I could grab the bush, easily overpowered me, and shoved me aside. With me clear, he dived into the foliage and reached for the gun.

But he didn’t find it. After tearing apart his plants, dawning realization came over his face. He turned around to face the Glock that I had leveled at his head.

“You reached for the bush so that I’d think you tossed the gun in there,” he sighed, dropping his head. The early morning sun glistened off his bare scalp. “Then picked it up while I was searching for like a jackass, not paying attention to you.”

We remained there for several seconds, him kneeling and me standing, frozen. 

An alarm rang faintly from Albert’s room and was quickly shut off. Eggers turned to face the window before looking back at me. “You’re going to have to shoot,” he sighed. “Do you really think I’m going to hand over my son because I’m afraid of dying?” He blinked several times. “Do you really think that losing a child is preferable to death?”

Something in my chest broke. “Don’t-”

But I couldn’t finish the sentence. After several deep breaths, I began anew. “They are going to take your son. This can either happen with you leading him out the door, or them dragging him kicking and screaming after he finds your obliterated head lying in pieces in the backyard.”

Eggers rocked back and forth. He looked like he was trying to figure something out, but each second etched more despair into his face.

My own tears finally broke. The gun shook wildly as I held it before him, but I didn’t lower it or try to hide how terrified I was. I didn’t apologize, and he didn’t expect it. 

“Why did you say ‘very unlikely’?” he grunted while staring at the sky.

“What?”

“Why didn’t you say that it was certain? Why leave that sliver of hope alive?” He turned to face me. 

My stomach rolled like it was the 1912 Titanic, sweeping the ocean floor one year later with all the elegance of its neighboring whale feces. “I told you that these aren’t my people.”

He stood. Then he turned and walked toward his home as I followed a short distance behind, gun still ready. 

“Speak, man,” he grunted.

Shit. Had I just pissed my pants? I looked down. Yep, I’d just pissed my pants. There are few moments when pissing one’s pants does not take immediate priority, and this was one of those few moments. I ignored the ocher soaker in my briefs and focused on getting Albert without another incident. 

“It would be easier to just let this happen.” I tried to sound gentle. “That would cause the least amount of pain.”

“*Nothing* is more painful than losing a child, fucker.”

I involuntarily flashed back to Kara again. 

*If our goldfish go to fish heaven when they die, shouldn’t we kill them all?* 

*Why is it easier for kids to say ‘I love you’ than it is for adults?*

I finally puked, right there on Eggers’s goddamn kitchen floor. I wiped my lip, dragging a long strand of saliva and vomit that stretched across my fingers like a salamander’s snot. Heaving once, I looked up at him. “Fine,” I grunted. “If this is going to happen, then tell your son to come outside with me. He’s going to need to trust us until it’s too late.”

Eggers stared at me, eyes sunken. “What the fuck do you have planned?”

I wiped my eyes. Vomit chunks stung my cornea. “It’s probably going to kill us both, and it will probably make things much worse on your son, but it’s the only chance to save him. Now, if you promise to do exactly as I say, you’re going to help me find my bitch of a wife, and we’re going to skin her alive until she [spills every secret](https://www.facebook.com/P-F-McGrail-181784199029462/).”

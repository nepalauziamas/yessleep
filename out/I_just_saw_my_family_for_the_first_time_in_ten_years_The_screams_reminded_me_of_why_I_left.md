“I wish you’d never been born, Charlie, but don’t believe for one second that I’ve always felt this way. I was actually happy to have another grandson. Who’d believe that now, eh? I need you to understand that all of my resentment comes from who you are as a person. Your mind and soul represent the complete waste of a body that should have been given to anyone other than you.” He ended this rant in a phlegmy cough that shook his skeletal frame.

I wanted to hate the old man. He looked hateable; his milky, bloodshot eyes with the ugly film, translucent skin that looked like a rice wrap, ready to slide off his bones like a rotten peach, dozens of wiry hairs that grew in all the wrong places, and so, *so* many veins. The unforgiving years had finally made Grandpa Delora look on the outside exactly as he was on the inside. 

I *wanted* to hate him. But I hated myself so much more that I couldn’t project the bile past my own skin. My thigh itched, which was *probably* just paranoia over the two things in my pocket that could land me back in jail. So I found the open sore on my arm and picked at it with broken fingernails, feeling a satisfying warm gush as the most recent scab flaked onto the floor and fresh blood leaked down my arm. 

I kept scratching it.

Chet looked at me like I was a booger that had learned to walk. I hated him more in that moment than I ever had before, and the anger felt right; my family had taught me what hatred was, and my cousin Chet was the perfect target for my own insatiable fury. Successful, agreeable, and seemingly chiseled from granite, he was everything that made me hate the universe for what I lacked. He *belonged* to the family in ways that I never would; the inlaid cherry bookcases that adorned this particular corner of my family’s home cost more than I’d spent on a lifetime of rent. When the setting sunlight streamed through the bay windows, it caught the L. A. skyline in a frame that looked like it had been painted as a backdrop just for Chet. I felt out of place in such a room; the last time I was here, the police had thrown my ass in the back of a cruiser, because weeding out my type is considered basic maintenance in Westwood.

Chet straightened his tie and stepped away, clearly too good to risk getting my blood on his clean suit. “I still don’t understand why we’re here, Grandpa,” he grumbled, refusing to take his eyes off of me. “I haven’t contacted anyone in the family since you told my cousins they’d be out of the will if they ever spoke to me again.”

Grandpa narrowed his eyes and licked his lips, but his tongue was too dry. Desiccated, sticky skin pulled against itself like sweaty thighs on a black leather car seat beneath the summer sun.

I scratched harder. I itched more.

“Redemption,” Grandpa smiled, revealing that he had lost some incisors. “Chet, do me a favor and pull the sheet from that display, would you?”

Chet narrowed his eyes at Grandpa’s withered frame, his bones nearly visible beneath the blanket, then looked over at the mysterious white sheet over a mysterious white frame. It was clearly meant to be a spectacle; it stood out amidst the ancient tomes and leather-bound furniture of my grandfather’s library. Grandpa Delora didn’t tolerate bullshit, so I had no idea what he was about to feed us in its stead.

Chet crossed the room in three quick strides. He grabbed the sheet in his giant football player’s hands, hesitated, looked at Grandpa, and pulled.

“*What the fuck?*”

Grandpa cackled as Chet stared at the bound and gagged little girl whose arms were tied to a rack of wood. The air left my lungs; I had no idea who she was, but Grandpa was the type of man who could procure an strange child if the need struck him. He knew people.

“I wouldn’t do that,” Grandpa warned as Chet reached to untie her.

My cousin turned and narrowed his eyes at him. “Why?”

“Because as soon as I touch this button,” here he raised a small remote control, “four armed men will escort you off the premises, never to return and never to know the fate of this child that you wish to save. And before you open your mouth to suggest it, you know that the police will never enter this estate, and if they did, they would never find her.”

My heart bounced around in my ribcage so hard that it hurt. I was pretty sure that someone was about to die. I had a teenth in my back pocket, but no immediate way to get more if that wasn’t enough, so I tried to tell myself that I could hold off for the moment.

Have you ever seen pure hatred? Probably not. Most human beings have the capacity to kill another, but most never use it, because we keep that hate high up on a shelf, far out of reach. Every so often, the greater world shakes us so hard that the very top levels of our mind get knocked loose, and that hate comes tumbling down, announcing it was there all along. 

Chet hated Grandpa in that moment. I could see it in his eyes, and in the way that he pressed the pillow down on Grandpa’s sunken face.

Grandpa swung a bony fist that connected with Chet’s jaw, knocking the pillow loose. “CHARLES!” he coughed. “I’m ready to give you Jacob’s place in my will, I NEED YOU!”

Those last three words took the edge off of time. For a moment, I was floating.

I couldn’t remember the last time I’d heard that sentiment. Hell, I’d probably *never* heard it. 

Grandpa’s muffled screams brought me back to earth. His first punch had the advantage of surprise, but Chet had recovered and was easily overpowering him. The remote control lay broken on the floor where Grandpa had dropped it.

No one was coming to help him.

My grandpa, the asshole who’d refused to cover my bail so that I could “learn a lesson in the prison shower,” *needed* me and was helpless without my support.

My chest froze and my hands shook. What was my 120-pound frame going to do against an All-American football player? Life wasn’t fair.

I slipped the butterfly knife out of my pocket and snapped it open.

No, life wasn’t fucking fair at all.

I’d never stabbed anyone while sober, and hope I never have to again. I didn’t like how unnaturally easy it was. Gutting a family member should be incredibly difficult, but his skin provided only weak yet gritty resistance. It felt like overcooked chicken. 

It’s amazing that we expect to live past eighty, because our bodies aren’t sacred or invincible. The world grinds through meat every day. 

I’d already skittered backwards by the time that Chet wheeled around, wide-eyed and staring at me with confusion and sadness. Blood trickled from the corner of his mouth as his knees gave way and he slid into a sitting position by Grandpa’s bed. 

“You stabbed him in the back, once in his right lung, once in his left, removed the blade to ensure that he’d bleed out, then stepped aside to eliminate all chance of a fair fight,” Grandpa gurgled, his beady eyes focused on me. A thin line of drool trickled from his lower lip. “It’s not your first time stabbing a man who didn’t expect it, Charles.”

I swallowed. I couldn’t stop shaking. It wasn’t just my hands this time; my legs trembled as well. *Fuck,* I killed my cousin, *I killed my cousin,* I needed to take the edge off, and it had to be right now.

Chet, his face ashen gray, closed his eyes.

They were completely black when he opened them again. The lack of irises made it difficult to see where he was looking, but I somehow knew that he was staring at me. He flashed a wide, unhappy smile and got to his feet as blood flowed from his mouth. “Perhaps we shouldn’t abandon all hope for you, Charles,” Chet said in an unnaturally low voice that did not belong to my cousin. He looked down at the pool of blood beneath his feet before turning to face Grandpa. “Do it,” he ordered. 

Grandpa threw the blanket off of his wiry body and stepped gingerly onto the floor. Placing his wrinkly bare feet into Chet’s pooled blood, he smiled and reached under the sheets. Procuring a card in one hand and a dagger in the other, he held the weapon up to Chet’s neck. My cousin flashed a smile beneath his jet-black eyes as Grandpa pressed the tip into his flesh. “We can’t move him around without sacrifice, Charles. The prudent investor doesn’t hold his money back; no, he waits for the best exchange, and the opportunity will always present itself if he’s willing to pay the cost.”

He plunged the blade into Chet’s neck and I vomited. It was too much, it was all too much, and I’d waited too long, because now my hands were shaking too hard to light the fucking pipe properly. I shoved it back into my pocket for safekeeping; if I lost the pipe, I’d lose myself along with it.

“Open your eyes!” Grandpa screamed. “For *once* in your wasted existence, Charles, open your damned eyes! This is the greatest moment of your life, and you’re missing it!”

I looked up, barely able to balance myself on my tilty hands and knees. 

Grandpa placed the card on Chet’s forehead. It was adorned with a picture of an open eye that made me feel like my ears were about to pop. 

“Come home to me,” Grandpa yelled. Then, in a quieter voice, “Mammon.”

Chet’s eyes closed at the same time that the eye on the card shut. 

I almost died when I was nineteen. Thirteen years after my first beer, I finally got wasted enough to total three other cars by driving the wrong direction on a freeway. I remember the car jolting so angrily that I knew the world was trying to shake me loose. Grandpa’s library jolted in the same way after the eyes closed, tossing me like a rag doll before I landed flat on my face. I looked up, bleary-eyed, to see Grandpa shuffling over to the little girl. 

*squick squick squick*

He left bloody footprints on the wooden floor as he walked away from Chet. 

My cousin was gasping for breath that he couldn’t catch. He wheezed, but his chest wouldn’t expand. Now weak again, Chet stared at me with his own eyes once more, too feeble to do anything but wait for death.

*squick squick squick*

“Do you know why I can summon him in English, Charles?” Grandpa asked, his head slowly pivoting towards me. He smiled with broken teeth. “It’s because every language is the mother tongue of greed.” Then Grandpa whipped the card out and rested it against the little girl’s forehead.

The gag muffled her scream, but the effect was still the same. Her beet-red face rocked back and forth, blonde hair whipping in every direction as she struggled fruitlessly against her bonds.

I didn’t even try to help her. It’s impossible to say whether that was because I couldn’t, or because I wouldn’t; at a certain point, those concepts become the same thing. 

“The sun will be darkened and the moon will not give her light,” Grandpa bellowed. “Come back to me, Mammon.”

Darkness descended over the room as it shook once more. I scrambled, trying to regain my balance as every part of both arms itched as though red-hot fire ants were chewing my skin like merengue. “I can’t *do* this,” I sobbed.

My breath stopped as a light shined. I didn’t want to see, but I looked anyway.

The little girl had become the light-bearer; her skin was the only source of illumination in the room. Her eyes were now jet-black, and she smiled just for me. 

“That wasn’t your cousin, Charles,” she growled, the gag somehow gone. But the voice couldn’t belong to a little girl – it was the same one that had overtaken Chet, now emanating from a body that cartoonishly mismatched its speech. “At least, it wasn’t Chet when you decided to stab him. I didn’t believe you had the spirit, but your grandfather assured me that you would sink low enough to kill family.” The girl flexed her arms, yanking them free of her bonds, then raised her hands to the ceiling. “Let there be light.”

Every bulb switched back on. I winced while trying to scratch both arms and both legs all at once, wiping away waves of cold sweat as my nails dug into my skin. I was so rattled that I didn’t even attempt to stand, and I was itching, always itching. 

Grandpa stared at the black-eyed girl with a mixture of reverence and fear, clutching the dagger and card close.

Then the girl walked toward the bookcase, her gait eerily adult-like, and climbed the wall. Upon reaching the ceiling, she plunged her fingers into the plaster like it was sand and gripped it tight. Then, slowly, she reached arm over arm, leg over leg, moving on her hands and knees like it was the most natural thing to crawl along a ceiling as dust swirls of powdered plaster rained down from above. 

That was my breaking point. I reached into my pocket for the glass pipe; I simply couldn’t wait any longer.

“*Fuck!*” I withdrew a bloody hand that held three shards of glass. “No,” I whispered, “it… it broke when I fell.”

I collapsed to my elbows and pivoted to face directly upward. The girl looked back down at me, her blonde hair dangling like Spanish moss, eyes like ravens.

She smiled. 

“Charles Delora,” she said in that impossibly low voice, “I need you for [something very important](https://www.reddit.com/r/ByfelsDisciple/).”

So, my best friend, Nicole, and I have been friends for roughly fifteen years. We are very close, not in a sexual way obviously, but we're basically partners in crime. And we are literally now, I guess.

Nicole comes from a wealthy family. They're not by any means millionares, but they're pretty well off. Enough so that Nicole and her siblings (19 year old brother, Miles, 17 year old female, Emma, and 20 year old female, Olivia,) can get through college with next to no debt, and then get a decent starter apartment afterwards. 

Her parents have made it clear that the highest achiever of the four will inherit their house, wealth and joint buisness when they die. They made this with relatively good intentions- the idea was to make their children more interested in getting a good education and getting a degree in whatever they wanted, as long as they were good at it. They wanted their children to be self-sufficient, and not just rely on their parent's money all their lives. 

Nicole worked herself relentlessly. I frequently had to remind her to take time off for herself, and her mental health was stretched to breaking point at multiple points during exams. She got high scores and was the best in the year, but she was never satisfied. She had to be The Best. She wanted to be perfect. 

Frequently, I would walk in to our joint dorm room to her having a breakdown and banging her head with increasing force on anything solid- the bedframe, the wall, the table... anything. I would have to calm her down and hug her until she got her senses back.

Then, during thanksgiving last year, Miles suddenly announced that he'd had a prestigious offer in... something. I don't know what it was as Nicole would not tell me.

This seemed to snap something in Nicole. She had been on the ropes mentally for ages, I knew that. I guess the knowledge that after all her work, she was still only second place made her plummet off the ropes and into darkness.

Now, I kind of figured she would take matters into her own hands, especially after I found her looking into ways to dispose of human matter- bones, blood, skin etc. I didn't ask her, obviously. You don't just walk up to your best friend and go "yo, I know that you're planning to kill your siblings."

One night, she stayed out really late and came back with blood on her hands. I knew what she had done, and told her I could help stage a disappearance to shift suspicion off her. All her siblings lived in different places, the fact that she was the only survivor would be suspicious.

She accepted, and we spent a few hours trashing the dorm. I deliberately slashed myself with a blade to make it seem like I fought against the "kidnapper." We wore gloves so that there wouldn't be fingerprints. Nicole smashed the window so it looked like the kidnapper escaped through there. We were screaming and yelling throughout, to make it seem like there was an active crime happening. I took a light dose of pills to knock myself out and Nicole ran for it.

I woke up in hospital. I was questioned about what happened, I said someone broke into the apartment and attacked me with a knife and knocked me out. I made it seem like I didn't know that Nicole was missing, and cried when I was told she was missing (I am extremely good at making myself cry when I need to.)

It has been a few months now. I'm still in contact with Nicole, who dyed her hair and changed her style completely. According to her, she now lives with a group of college kids in a seedy apartment miles away. She says she plans on returning once she's finished her current course, and I'm going to help her stage a return in where I find her unconscious and call 911. 

I want Nicole to succeed at life, and it hurt seeing her in the state she was in while trying to win her parent's money and home. This is why I helped her. I'm not crazy. I just want my friend to be happy.

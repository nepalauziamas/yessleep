I like my bestfriend... like ALOT.

She is the prettyiest, kindest and smartest person I have ever met. They babysit and adore children, they have red and black fadded long hair, dark olive colored skin, freekles and choclate brown eyes that I love. We have been friends for a little over a year and a half and I already know i'd do anything for them. I don't care about their bad grades, mental dissabilitys or their mental illness... Their in perfections make them seem even better in my opion. They have a diffcult past and a lot of trama and yet they have told me that I make them feel safe.

The first time they stayed at my house, they fell asleep multiple times- She hardly sleeps- and when I asked if she was okay she just said, "I feel safe with you." And I swear I almost cried. I have trouble sleeping- always have always will, so I spent my time watching over them as they slept. Just in case... I want them safe. I mean it whole heartidly when I say if a human could be perfect? It would be her.

Now... here the thing.

She likes me. Hell she was my first kiss! But.. well she has a boyfriend.

A dickhead boyfriend. He is a bully, a jerk, he is disrespectful, is constantly in suspension alomst expelled even- he is gross and everything wrong with a man. I hate him. He isn't even attractive! He's stupid and just no good qualitys, I don't GET IT.

But she loves him.

So i delt with it him.

I delt with him showing up to our plans, our hang outs unannounced, unwelcomed, uninvited. I delt with him making her cancle our plans to hang out with him. I delt with it.

Untill she came to my house, sobbing incoherently, My eyes had winded as they fell into my arms that I held out on an instict.

"What's wrong?" I had asked quickly.

They had gotten out more incoherent nonsense, eventually I brought her inside and sat us down on the couch. They pressed against me with arms wrapped around me tightly and continued to sob. I just sat there. Holding them and whispering reasurence. Until eventually.. I got a few words.

"H-He is gone!" They had shouted, "Mike! He-He's missing."  They cried and my eyebrows roes.

"Oh..." I had whispered, running a han through their hair, "I'm so sorry love..." I said, "Did you guys break up?" I asked, confused.

"No... He- He is missing. God he- he is missing!"

I blinked, "Oh- Oh no..." I hold her closer, "I'm so sorry love, but i'm here, we will find him. Okay?"

After that, I got them a cup of coffee once they were calm enough to be alone, then we called the cops. The serch has been going for a few days now and my bestfriend has been staying with me. Which I love but will never state- she sleeps in my bed with me, our limbs intangled when he fall asleep and wake up, we eat similar foods so no issue there, and I can easily help them if they need anything- mental or physical assistance- and visa versa. I love every moment.

We were hanging out in my back garden when they had finally asked me the qestion i'd been waiting for-

"Hey, what... why is the dirt dug up there?" She hummed and pointed at the patch of dirt on the side of the house. Dug up.

I shrugged, "I started planting, it's gonna be a flower bed." I smiled and slung and arm over them.

"Oh, what kind?" They asked with bright eyes. They love flowers. I know they do. It's why I planted them rather then a bush or tree.

"Hyacinth's." I state, "Yellow ones." I added.

She had grinned, "Sweet! nice choice, will match the paint color." She hums, leaning on me.

"I know." I grinned, running a hand through her hair, "Want anything to drink love?"

I love that they don't mind the nicknames I give them... Yet I hate that her eyes are still puffy and red from crying.

"Yeah, a monster. Original." I nod and stand up, "Thanks goregous!" She joked.

"On it!" I laughed, walking into my house.

She sat, staring up at the open sky, in a lawn chair on my porch. She is so pretty... that was all I could think about. I love her, so much.

I opened my fridge and smiled, humming quietly.

She will forget soon. About him. Soon she will know that I am all she needs. If she dosn't? If she gets another boyfriend, girlfriend of anyone above... Well... I will plant another flower bed. Yellow roses next time.

I take the drink out onto the porch and wrap my arms around her, making her laugh. I stare at the flower bed next to the porch. 

She is mine.

I will love her.

She will know it soon.

I know it.

My name is Hutch and I work for a branch of the government called  "Redacted". Our branch specializes In discovering and documenting the unknown. The range of these disturbances can span from Cryptids, Alternate realities bleeding into our own, and the occasional forgotten Gods.

If you have not read the last two posts about the recent occurrences in the Mariana Trench, I recommend you do so, so you can understand what I'm about to tell you, it already sounds crazy as is.

Since my last post, many things have happened involving the trench.  I have finally made it to the company's home base that I thought was near the Mariana Trench. I assumed I would be staying on a ship but the company ended up deciding on an opposite approach, which I'm glad they did. The company has access to a lot more resources than other departments within the government. This is due to the reality bleeds. A lot of reality bleeds provide a lot of new materials and elements. One of the realities that opened up couldn't be closed for unknown reasons. We decided to explore. While exploring it the research team stumbled upon something we like to call Anti-Gravity Shards. These shards allow anything it's touching to float. We are still unable to figure out why these shards give the effect but since learning about it we have gathered a large amount of the material and sent it back to our reality.

With the shards, the company managed to combine them with the metal of an aircraft carrier. Which would now be my home until the bleed has been resolved.  When I was being escorted by place to the home base, I was shown around and witnessed the creatures that had been able to make it to the surface of the water. With them being able to reach the surface the company had set up cement barricades almost around the entirety of the trench. With a couple of acceptions due to creatures being an issue.

A comment from one of the last posts talked about the possibility of there being kaiju coming through the gate. So far nothing of that sized magnitude has been spotted trying to exit the trench. On the other hand, we have had strange creatures try to breach the water's surface.  The ones that have been a huge issue from what I could tell from my tour were what appeared to be Sea dragons.  They were massive compared to the size of a whale. They have the ability to breathe underwater and on the surface. One of them had managed to scale part of the wall and had been attacking one of the groups of builders. Due to these creatures being aquatic the builders were given protection by squad b83. Squad b83 had been given Electrified m16s. These creatures are not killed by the rounds but are able to be subdued for further research.

When we landed on the carrier, I was strip-searched and shown to my bunk. Unlike normal employees of the company. Due to my experience, I have been given special privileges. Compared to most people. I am one of the highest members of the company, due to when I entered a bleed with my friends at a young age. We were trapped there for a long time. Time moves differently in every bleed but sometimes time is the same as our own reality. The one I had fallen in though moved at a faster pace. I spent 12 years there, and when I came back I had only been missing for 2 years. I learned a lot from my time living in a bleed which the company found appealing. Since my old life was completely out the window and my own family wouldn't know who I was. They offered me a place to stay and a job.

Even though I am higher up than most people in the company. My bunk contained a twin-sized bed, a laptop, a tv, and my own bathroom. From what I've been told the carrier contains a couple of communal bathrooms and showers. Making my room even though seem like a slice of heaven.

After unpacking, I was forced to go to an 8 pm meeting with the research team. I was brought to the lowest portion of the ship. The room I entered had a glass floor peering off into the abyss that is the Mariana Trench. I was completely shocked when I could see lights moving through the water. While I was completely engulfed in what I was looking at. A researcher approached next to me with a clipboard and said " They are beautiful aren't they, you can't see the lights during the day but you can see them at night. Their bones are completely bioluminescent"

I told her "They are astonishing, but I don't think we have been introduced yet have we?"

"We definitely haven't but I know who you Hutch. Your time you spent in that bleed helped provide us with information we wouldn't have been able to get... Where are my manners I'm sorry, My name is Mary and I'm the head researcher of this facility when it comes to studying these beautiful creatures, and you will be learning to befriend them" explained Mary.

"Doesn't that seem a bit dangerous, doesn't it seem a bit dangerous for me to hop into those waters?" I exclaimed to Mary and she explained to me something I didn't even know about.

"Of course, it would be, if we sent you down there you would surely die. You spent a lot of your time on land, getting trained to fight creatures from bleeds.  Something you might not know which is kept secret from most of the members of the company is that we have a facility where we take any aquatic animal/fish that we find. This isn't the first bleed that has opened up in the ocean. This specific bleed is just more dangerous due to the cataclysmic size of it, and the potential creatures it could release from the other side if they can find their way up here." - Mary

"I assume if we get a lot of bleeds opening up on the surface since the earth is 71 percent covered in water, you guys must deal with a lot more than us." - Hutch

"That would be most people's assumption, but most of the bleeds that open up are incredibly small and a lot of the time if something does come through the pressure crushes them in the water. The weirdest creature we had seen come through one of these bleeds was a goblin in a submarine. He actually made first contact and made us aware that he was no threat to us and that even though he is so mighty and the last of his and I quote "Dung Goblin Tribe" and we shouldn't worry. Usually, we'd capture something like this but we saw him open up a bleed and go right on through. We still don't know how he managed to open up a bleed in front of him like that. It was like something out of dr who, last of his kind and just traveling realities." - Mary

"What do you mean it opened up a bleed on its own and I hope you aren't kidding about this creature because it would be a big discovery?" -Hutch

"Bleeds as you know can be opened up by creatures, even though we don't know how they do it. The "dung Goblin" has given us a lot of information for our first time seeing it. We didn't know other than Pandora's box that portals could be opened by people/things, through machines. Also no I wouldn't be the head researcher of this facility if I was going around making jokes about entities. I would surely lose my job." - Mary

"Moving onto another subject, you are going to need to take this." - Mary

Mary had handed me a pill bottle with light blue pills on the inside.

"These will prepare your body for the high pressures within the trench. It is the best we have now but with those without help from machines you should be able to reach at least a mile down. We have been testing this out in other locations that don't have giant monsters. You will need to take them daily. Don't worry we also won't be sending you down without a machine to help you."  - Mary

" Okay, was there anything else you needed to see me about? I imagine pills weren't the only thing you would be giving me you could have just had them sent to me."- Hutch

"That would be about everything the things we talked about earlier were actually what I was sending you down to get debriefed you are free to leave. Please do not be wondering around here past 10 pm guards will be on high alert due to the creatures attempting to leave the trench."- Mary

This concluded my first day at the Company's home base at the marina trench. More stuff has been going on, which I think you will all find interesting when I finish writing part 4.

When I turned eight, three days before Christmas, my mom bought me clothes , they are a bit big for a boy my size, but I wore it anyways, my mother was a mid thirty mother, she always tells me stories at the night, sometimes she tells me that her parents, or my grandparents, won't accept her as family if she didn't "show her true self". I didn't understood what that was but when I asked her, "Good night, sweetie." is all she said. I was confused at first but then after several times, I don't ask questions anymore.

 My dad left me when I was five, my mother hadn't told me the exact reason. I assume it was because he's working out of town because I couldn't think of him in another country with a different family. I kept telling my self that "He'll be back, he just got some unfinished work! That's all!". That thought kept me positive for all these years. 

One day, on Christmas Eve, me and my mom was sitting  by the brick fireplace on our wall, it was midnight, it was snowing outside. My mom asked me "What do you want to be when you grow up?". I replied "I want to be Santa Claus when I grow up!" My mom replied with a soft laugh and said "Well I hope you will be Santa, Max." I laughed excitedly and my eyes reflected the fire as if the determination was burning in my heart. "It's getting late, you should get to bed." my mom said to me in a soft tone, almost like she's whispering. She walked me to my room, pulled up my blanket and kissed me "Good night, sweetie." This time she didn't told me a story like everytime, but I went to bed anyways. 

I woke up at 2:55 in the morning, with a bladder full of piss, our bathroom was next to the kitchen so we'll have to get out of our bedroom if we want to do personal matters. I walked to the bathroom, half-sleepy, half-awake. Right when I finished, I heard a loud noise inside my mom's bedroom, then a spine-chilling loud cackle came from my mom's room, the sound continued and louder and louder, I walked near to my mom's door and said out loud "Mom?". The cackles and the noises stopped. 

"Mom?" I called her a second time, no response, so I slowly opened my mom's bedroom door, a small creak noise from the door and what I saw frozed me, It was a shadow, a very tall one, it has long limbs, a thin stomach and long claws. "Mom?" was all I can say, under the moonlight, the creature glanced at me, it's eyes has no pupil, it's just pure black, I dropped to the flour and yelled an ugly sound, I cried and thinking it was gonna kill me, after half an hour or so, I stopped crying and that creature disappeared, the moon light shines so brightly so that I saw all my mom's ripped clothes and blood stains all over the white carpet, the bed's blanket left open.

I remebered what my mom said before that whatever happens, go to the police station, so I rushed downstairs and outside, with my short legs and the thick layer of snow, I struggled a lot when trying to get to the station. When I got there, they asked me what was going on, I struggled to breath as they were trying to calm me down, tears starts rolling down my cheek and I can't feel my legs because of the coldness of the snow. As I was calming down and my breath was slowing down, I described what I saw and heard to the officers, they asked me to show them to my house, I ran to my house with the 2 officers behind my back.

When they got there, they were all terrified of my mom's room, I described the creature to them, that part they didn't quite believe but they sent me to the precinct for safety and they rolled yellow and black tapes all over our house, because they think that this might be a murder scene. Three police cars were sent there, the siren sound ran all over the neighborhood. At the precinct, they asked me if I have any relatives that I know of and their phone number, I told them my uncle's, they called him, describing what happened and he arrived more than an hour later to pick me up. I slept at my uncle's that night.

Tomorrow's morning, my uncle sat on the couch in the living room and was watching the news, I sat there with him as I couldn't sleep much yesterday so I woke up early, I was watching the news with him so I could clear my head of that creature.

"Breaking News: In London, a deformed body was found, the victim's skin was nowhere to be found and the victim's guts and brain disappeared, the victim was identified as Michael Solomon." 

My uncle and I were terrified, knowing that my dad was murdered in such horrible way. The reporter said a detail that caught my attention.

 "The members of the victims' family described the murderer as tall, long limbs, thin stomach and long claws. The murderer has still nowhere to be found and still on the loose, stay tuned for more informations..."

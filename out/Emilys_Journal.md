Entry 1
9/16/13

My parents bought me this journal because they thought it would be a good idea to write down what’s happening and I might want to look back on it once I’m older. Anyways, nothing is really happening right now Sam is being a bitch and Jessie is totally on her side. I just hope we can get over this and be friends again. What else am I supposed to write?

Entry 2
9/20/13

I forgot about this journal for a couple days but I’m back to write another entry. Jessie is on my side now and Sam is totally mad about it. I don’t get why she is getting this angry over a boy, all I did was sit with him one day at lunch. As if she owns all the boys at school because she wasn’t even dating him. I didn’t Ben make the first move, he sat with me first.
Well, there’s not really much else happening so that’s it for now.

Well Sam doesn’t seem so mad anymore and we are just friends again Jessie is just happy she doesn’t have to take sides anymore. Well me and the boy were talking again today and we have a date planned for next week! His name is Jake and he’s really cool and handsome and I can’t wait for the date. Well anyway that’s all I have for now.

Sorry I haven’t wrote anymore it’s just nothing has happened lately. Other than my totally awesome date with Jake! He’s so sweet and I think Sam is over him now and she’s talking to this new guy named Wyatt. I don’t know much about him but he’s kind of a creep. Anyway I don’t have to worry because if anything happens Jake will protect me.

Today at school I saw Sam and Wyatt just watching me at lunch. So creepy. Jessie doesn’t like him either he seems like a bad influence on her. Ever since they started talking Sam has gotten super distant from us. We still talk on the phone but it’s just not the same. She’s not the same.

So much happened today just like the last four days Sam and Wyatt were staring at me at lunch like a couple of freaks. Today I decided to tell Jake and he thought that Wyatt was trying to get with me so he beat him up. I didn’t see Wyatt for the rest of the day so he must have went home after that happened. Sam was super pissed at me because she thought I made him do it. Jessie agrees that it is weird for them to be like that at lunch so at least someone is on my side.

Tonight Jessie, Jake and I are all at my house for a sleepover. We decided it was best to not invite Sam with what has happened recently. Wyatt and her have been acting super weird. Now they spend all of their time together and haven’t been at school the last two days which is strange for Sam because she never missed a day.

Entry 8

All of us have been having a super weird night it started with us hearing tapping on the windows but now we hear rustling on the carpets it the house and mom and dad are on a trip so it can’t be them. Jake swears he will protect me no matter what. Jessie is just scared and wants to go home.

As the clock struck midnight we thought we saw silhouettes outside. Jessie talked about leaving but is too scared now. Jake is still on high alert. If anything bad happens this journal can be used as evidence. 

Entry 10
10/13/13

Jessie decided to leave but we never heard her car. I looked out the window and I could barely see but I can make out a faint mark on the driveway. It must be Jessie’s body! As we came this realization we heard lout footsteps headed towards the door…


The book softly closes as the hooded figure rises, in Emily’s dying breath she whispered 

“Why, Sam?” 

“Emily it wasn’t seeing you with another boy, it was seeing him with you. I have always loved you and if I can’t have you no one can.”

“I thought you loved Wyatt”

“Oh please Wyatt was just a distraction for me to set this up.”

“Please save me Sam, don’t do this”

“I can’t do that, now I can always be with you”

A loud gunshot goes off an Sam’s bloody corpse drops around the others.

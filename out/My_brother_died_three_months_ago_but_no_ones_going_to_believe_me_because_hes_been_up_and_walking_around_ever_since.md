Let me start this by saying that ghosts aren’t real. I can tell you that for absolutely certain, because I’m psychic. That’s not what I actually call myself—I sorta just default to “I do weird shit sometimes”—but, I figured I’d use the most culturally relevant word for clarity’s sake. Or is that “empath” now? I don’t know what the fuck the kids are calling it these days. Anyway, I see dead people. Or at least, I see the things that make our meatsuits work, and I can promise you the only time they are ever visible, audible, tangible, *fathomable*, to anyone—even the people who say they can talk to dearly departed granny for you (and more on *them* later)—are in the seconds it takes for us, or whatever constitutes “us” to leave here, and move on to whatever there is, when we die. That’s it. I don’t think anyone in the year of our lord 2022 would blame anyone for not wanting to stick around, but yeah, this is the one thing I can say for certain: I don’t know if there’s an afterlife, but I do know that human essence leaves, at least in a form we can recognize as a human essence, as fast as fucking possible the moment we die, leaving nothing but a body behind. No one seems to want to stay here after the bar closes, if you know what I mean.

“But, MumNamedMeAfterACar,” you say, “what about those haunted B&Bs that report translucent ladies in white appearing at the tops of the stairs to terrify guests?” Or “wait, but what about that time I saw a man come through my wall?” Not ghosts, kiddies. Sorry about it. They’re either just stories, or, on the rare occasion there’s actually documented activity, well…

I guess you could argue semantics with me, but before you do, let me give you a physics lesson, specifically on the laws of thermodynamics, which, if you don’t know what they are, they’re kind of one of the basic ways we’ve learned to understand our existence in the universe. Before I get into the laws, it’s important to state that it is an established fact that everything in this universe is made up of tiny and tinier little energy particles. Matter you can touch, and matter you can’t necessarily feel—like the air we breathe—it’s all little energy balls that vibrate either quickly—for more solid stuff—or very slowly—closer to the stuff you can’t always feel. And all you are is a conglomeration of pieces of vibrating energy. Now, here’s a part that might gross you out: you’re not only a collage of energy particles: you’re a collage of \*recycled\* and \*repurposed\* energy particles. Hear me out.

With the knowledge that everything we’ve ever known is just energy vibrating at different speeds to make different shit, we can talk about the first law of thermodynamics—and it’s the only one with which we are to concern ourselves today (I’m a psychic, not a genius). In the science life bible— if you’re nasty—in the book of Thermodynamics chapter 1 verse 1, we hear that “energy cannot be created, or destroyed,” which means that every particle that exploded outward during the big bang that would eventually lead to our miserable existence, is all that there ever will be. The second part of that first law, Thermodynamics 1:2, states that energy can, however, change form. Which is where I got the “you’re nothing but a cloud of recycled particles” bit. (Cue the part where someone asks if they could be part dinosaur. I don’t fucking know man, ask someone smarter than me. All I know is that your atoms were here at the beginning of the universe) Now, what in the sweet fuck does that have to do with your house ghost, you ask? Hold on, I’m almost there.

Human bodies are energy, and they also give off energy, often in the form of heat. That’s something that’s covered in elementary schools these days—we all hear it. What you’re not going to hear a grade school science teacher, or the established physicists that make those curricula possible talk about, is that we also give off energy in the form of, for lack of a better word, habit. Or, in other cases, intense emotion. And because energy can’t be created, or destroyed, when we release energy that doesn’t have a specific purpose, like heat would have, sometimes it doesn’t really have anywhere to go or anything to do. So, like a weird sort of quantum muscle memory, that energy just sort of does what it had been doing before it was released. If you find you’re catching a man walking through your wall, check the renovation history of your house, and I bet you you’ll find that there used to be a doorway in the very spot where your friend prefers to make his entrance. And I bet, though this would be harder to corroborate, the gentleman you’re seeing spent a lot of time following a route in the house that brought him through that doorway so often that when he moved out—that’s the thing too, by the way, those “ghosts” you see sometimes aren’t actually even dead—a part of him stayed behind, doing the old routine. But it’s not really “him”, because it isn’t sentient. It’s just a memory standing on its own, a history book on the mundane aspects of suburban life, but in 3D.

Let’s use the “lady in white” as another example. What if the lady in white doesn’t follow a pattern, but seems to have a mind of her own? She’s often seen weeping in every room of the B&B that used to be her homestead, or has been known, from time to time, to whip plates at the heads of unsuspecting visitors, or really likes standing over people at night, glaring at them as they tremble in their beds. Some would call her a “poltergeist”, and again, sure, we could argue semantics, but what’s actually happening is a little less movie-worthy than you’d think. The lady in white probably had a really bad day once. Or—okay—maybe more than once. These days were so bad, in fact, that the emotions she let out to deal with her bad days, stuck around. Now, she didn’t have to throw the plates during her life for plates to come flying off the wall 300 years later. She didn’t have to stand creepily over some poor family member’s bed while she was alive, either. Energy vibrates; you can’t expect it to just, sit there, floating all the time. Think of some of the bigger, scarier stuff as like, a glitch, or like a fuse blowing. Sometimes there’s just an energy surge when there’s too much to go around, and shit happens.

Like I said, memories and emotions hang around. People don’t. At least, the energy that makes up what we call people doesn’t. The part that leaves, leaves for good. Maybe it changes form into a raincloud or something—I’ve never seen that part, so I don’t know. I do know that folks don’t stick around as an incorporeal version of themselves. The part that stays—the body—rots, and its atoms transform into compost, or something like that. Please don’t ask me if what I see leaving a body when a person dies is a soul. Again, that’s debating semantics, and that’s not what I’m here to do.

I’m here because three months ago, when my brother died, something happened. Something I’m still trying to wrap my head around explaining to myself, let alone to Reddit. I’m not trying to drop a twist on you or anything. I’m serious. I promise you that ghosts do not exist. My brother is gone. He hasn’t even left his memories behind—on the outside at least. Obviously he’s in our hearts, or whatever, but, he isn’t \*here\*. I watched him leave us with my own two eyes. He OD’d on our mother’s living room floor, and died in my arms: lips blue, ice cold, and his eyes, with pupils like pinholes, locked on something magnificent a million miles away. Our sister, Jamie, was running down the street to get the Narcan kit from her car when he went.

I had never before heard a person’s final breaths, usually because when I was present for a death I was always too caught up watching whatever made who they were rise from their bodies like mist, dancing its way into the ether to hear, but for some reason I did catch Max’s last breath: it rattled out of him like a marble rolling off a table, a marble that wouldn’t actually ever hit the floor. I remember thinking how ironically anticlimactic it was, like there was supposed to be another breath that came after, or even a final deflating of the chest, but he just stopped. And then by that point he—or his essence or whatever— was already swirling around the ceiling fan. It smelled like the Old Spice he wore when he was a teenager. And then he was gone.

Heat rises. So do we. Right up through ceilings and into beyond. Where he went after he left the house, again, I couldn’t tell you. And I couldn’t tell Jamie when she came back in because I had been crying too hard by that point to get any words out, and I was kind of relying on her to read the despair in my face to know that we couldn’t do anything else for him. Jamie exploded into the living room, and when she saw that I was just sitting there, holding him, she ran over and slapped my hands away, shrieking that I should’ve started CPR by now, and that I needed to get my shit together. And then she leaned over him while I wept, and started the process of administering the naloxone through his nose.

In most cases, when naloxone is given to a person who has overdosed on opioids, you can see the effects of the reversal pretty quickly, usually within ten minutes. Once that starts to come through, assuming you’ve already called 911, you can step back and let the paramedics do their job. It’s got a pretty good success rate, but it has to be given on time. And I know for a fact we were too late with Max. I know that just as surely as I know that Max’s body, Max himself, and the fuckin’ naloxone, were made up of atoms.

So you can imagine my shock when Max began to breathe again.

I hadn’t even been able to tell Jamie I thought that the medicine wasn’t going to work because there wasn’t anyone left inside for breathing to benefit once it took. I actually told her to go fuck herself when, after five minutes of rescue breathing, she began to grin wildly, and cried, “oh my god, we got him. He’s back.” When I swore at her, her head shot up at me in horrified confusion, and I was about to ream her out for joking like an asshole, but then Max opened his eyes, started to shake, and murmured “wassuh movie good?”

I screamed, and scuttled backward away from him like a crab until my back hit the TV stand, and that is where I sat for the next 45 minutes as the paramedics showed up, took his BP—looking more and more okay, if not a little low—and loaded him into the ambulance. I told Jamie later that night once we’d heard he was very much in the clear that I didn’t understand how he was still here, and she said “yeah, I know, it’s a miracle, but we’ll get him to back to the clinic and it’ll stick this time. I can feel it.” That wasn’t what I meant, but I didn’t know how to tell her that our brother was dead and that his meatsuit’s vitals were impossibly stable.

Or that there was a dark, gnawing feeling in my gut, because the body that they carried out of the house winked at me as I sat on the floor. And then it grinned, wide, a terrifying lucidity in its eyes. A knowing I couldn’t quite grasp.

After the overdose, Max’s body went to a 90-day opiate addiction inpatient program, where it’s been since March. I hear it’s doing well. Mum and Jamie have been to visit, but I can’t bring myself to do it. I’ve heard it talk when I’m around when Max has called—Mum always puts it on speaker—and it sounds like him, but not quite, or, at least I think not quite. I don’t even know what I’m listening for. Nothing about this situation makes sense, and I’ve been over it a thousand times already. Ninety days is a long time to spend questioning whether or not you actually saw your brother die as you wait for him to return to the family. It’s like Schrodinger’s fucking sibling. For a while, I tried pretending that he \*was\* alive, because I hadn’t seen Max’s walking skintube since the day of the OD, and there hadn’t been a funeral, and everyone was relieved, so I could be too. For a while I even tried to tell myself that I’d just missed him returning to his body through my tears and that helped. It also helped that every family conversation I heard was punctuated with gratefulness and the idea of second chances. Until it didn’t anymore.

Let me tell you one more thing about me: Part of my job is to serve at hospitals as an on-call end-of-life support worker in both palliative care and in ICU settings (I’m like a death therapist, I guess). It’s how I know what complete death looks like, and how I know that ghosts don’t exist. I watch at least one person leave on their next adventure a week. But even more than that, I see people arrest, and then come back. And on the odd occasion I can watch doctors try to save a life through a hospital room window, I can always tell when defibrillation is going to work, because the person hangs on. Literally. No mist comes out. No particle cloud. They’re locked into their body. When it’s not going to work, the person starts to emerge, and desperately tries to claw themselves away from the body through the feet as the paddles deliver shocks to reset their failing heartbeat. And finally, they manage to pull away, and a little bit later, the doctor calls it. I’ve never seen someone “die,” leave the body, and then return to it. There are no second chances. Death is remarkably final. The one thing that could’ve kept me from thinking I’d lost it completely when the sun was up is the first possibility I have to throw out the window at night when it’s just me and my thoughts as I lay awake. Or when I go to work on what we call a busy day.

I can’t deny the truth. Max died. He left. And his body is moving around with nothing in it. At least, I think there’s nothing in it. I don’t know if I should hope that there’s nothing in it—I don’t know what would be worse: nothing, or something, if that were even possible. But if there is something, it’s sure as hell not Max. And it knows I know that.

No one’s thought to ask me what I saw the day of the OD, because he’s alive. They think. And I can’t bring myself to tell them otherwise, because I don’t even know what the fuck is going on. But I’m about to find out, because Max comes home tomorrow. And Mum wants to have everyone over for a celebratory dinner. And—even better— she wants me to go pick him up at the facility after my morning shift so she and Jamie can get everything ready. I’m afraid to go, because I don’t know what’s waiting for me at the gate, or what I’m about to be trapped in a car with for three hours on very quiet roads.

I’m posting this here because I want some kind of record of the “before” that isn’t just a word doc on my computer that someone could find and think I’ve had an episode or something. (As if anyone outside of my family and close friends don’t already think that someone calling themselves a psychic has a fucking screw loose). Here is good because none of you are going to believe me anyway, and if anyone I know in real life comes across this post and figures me out, they’ll think I’ve just gotten into creative writing to deal with my stress. And you know, I do feel better, so maybe there’s a kernel of truth there, too. Getting this out of my head and onto paper—or, screen, I guess—after carrying it around in my head for three months has definitely let a bit of the weight go.

If I don’t update this, then everything is fine. If I do—everything could still be fine, I’m trying not to catastrophize. And if I don’t update and this is the only time you’ll hear from me, it’s not a total waste of time; at least I’ve helped dispel a myth that may keep some of you up at night.

No ghosts. I promise. Nothing to be afraid of there.

Bodies, however. Those I’m not so sure about.

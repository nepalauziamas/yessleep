Welcome back to the part two of our journey to the catacombs, and let me tell you, escaping them was just the beginning.

&#x200B;

“What?!” Jacob exclaimed. “*Mr. Richardson* summoned Karabasan?! How? Why?”

“Shush,” I said. “Let me keep reading.”

&#x200B;

*Some might think it began the day I discovered the catacombs beneath the school. They would be wrong. It truly began when I realized that the school was, and always would be, a magnet to the supernatural. I needed a way to keep the children in my care safe. I knew I wouldn’t be principal forever, and I also knew that there wouldn’t always be children like Jacob and George to keep the others safe.*

&#x200B;

“George?” I paused reading. “Who’s he?”

“He left last year,” Jacob told me. “He was a year ahead of me. Practically led our little club and taught me everything I know.”

&#x200B;

*I knew I needed a more permanent solution, one that wouldn’t involve endangering any more lives. So I was already well versed (or rather, as well versed as one can be) on the subject of the Seven Planes and their inhabitants when I discovered the old passages under the school. I explored them in my free time, fending off the entities that found their way into the Physical World. Eventually I found the room at the center of the labyrinth that contained a map of the town – an old map of the historic district, that showed me why the school was so attractive to otherworldly forces. Some unknown architect designed the town layout to mimic a glyph, a rune of power. It is a complex one, but I’ve translated it to the best of my abilities. This particular rune is not so much a single word as it is a command: a summoning glyph. And unfortunately the school has been built on the very spot the rune focus’ its power.*

*Now I had my answer as to why the supernatural kept invading our halls, and I was powerless against it. What could I do? Relocate the school? Perhaps in a few years, but who was to say something catastrophic wouldn’t happen in the time before? Changing the layouts of the city streets was out of the question as well, especially in our historic district.*

*I pondered all this for weeks, trying to come up with a strategy for keeping the school safe. I visited the catacombs a few more times, and inscribed warding Overrunes and Underrunes to protect against the inhabitants of the passages. Eventually, I made the decision that would ultimately bring about my downfall.*

*One night I came down to the passages and made my way to the center room. I had resolved to send out a plea for help across the Seven Planes and hope for a response. I went through all the proper rituals, drawing the summoning sigil, the proper runes, the candles, everything. The process went smoothly, but nothing responded – or so I thought. That night I was visited by a smiling demon who called himself Karabasan, who thanked me for allowing him access to our world before torturing me for the next eight hours. I woke up, shaken, and quickly inscribed Underrunes along the baseboards of my bedroom. I did the same at my office, but it was too late. The damage had been done. The demon had found a way in, and he immediately set about terrorizing the school. Jacob and the others were helpless against this new threat, one more powerful than anything we’d ever faced.*

*Desperate, I turned to my research for anything remotely connected to the subject of dream demons, but I came up empty handed. I fear I may have attracted the attention of prying eyes with my inquiries, but now is not the time to worry about mortals. I ventured down in the catacombs again in search of answers, and it was there that Karabasan spoke to me through a ghostly vessel. He told me of his plans, of how he would drive the kids and the teachers and the parents insane by visiting them in their dreams every night, killing them in every way imaginable until they longed for a death that wouldn’t come. He told me of his ultimate plan: to gain access to the Physical World, where he’d be omnipotent and unstoppable.*

*I defeated his vessel, but only barely. And with its dying breath, he vowed to never stop sending monstrosities after me until I was dead. And so we come to the end of the line: I cannot, in good conscious, continue to act as principal of Jacksonville Middle School, knowing full well that I am responsible for its current plight, and that I am being actively hunted by a demon of immense power who has promised to tear apart the school to get to me. I write these final lines from the safety of the center room, from which I am about to depart. I will go boldly into the darkness before me, and I will snuff out as many of Karabasan’s minions as I can before I fall. After all, his power down here is weak, limited by the incursions of Subterra. Perhaps I can make a difference. Perhaps I can drive him back.*

&#x200B;

I flipped the page, but the account ended there. “So that’s it,” I said. “That’s how he died.”

“He went out like a hero,” Jacob closed his eyes, his mouth a hard line. “Fighting a hopeless battle in the dark against an all-powerful enemy that he himself unleashed.”

I continued flipping the pages of the journal. “Hey, he left more notes in here. There’s all sorts of stuff. Maybe some of it’s useful. Warding runes… sealing runes… binding runes… here’s some sort of diagram, I think it’s of… the different planes, maybe? I don’t exactly know, but hey! Here’s a map of the catacombs!” I looked up at Jacob. “We could use this to get out of here!”

“Yes,” Jacob sighed. “We could. We need to show this to Wayne.”

I frowned. “Why the long face? We just got a map to our exit!”

“I trusted Mr. Richardson,” Jacob said. “We all did! And then he went and betrayed us like that! Summoning demons? Who does that? I mean, and then he never even told us about what he did, he just went off and died.”

“Hey, now,” I said, putting a hand on his shoulder. “Mr. Richardson did what he thought was right. He tried to protect you. He tried to protect the whole school. And when he made his mistake, he faced it head on. Sure, he didn’t win, but he didn’t run, either.” I gave him a smile. “Come on, let’s get out of here.”

“Sure,” Jacob returned an uncertain smile. “It’s probably getting late. My brother will be back to pick me up soon.”

We ventured out of the safety of the center room. Thankfully, nothing evil or monstrous came rushing down the hall towards us immediately. I shined the flashlight on the pages of the book. “Ok, so we’re going to go straight for a little bit, and then take a right at the third intersection we find.”

We walked in silence, for the most part, listening to water drip in far away passages, waiting to hear the telltale scraping of bricks or ragged breathing. Thankfully, neither of the entities found us. We turned right at the third intersection, and I consulted the map again.

“Ok, so now we want to turn left at the next passage, and then take the second right. After that it’s a straight shot to the exit.” We continued down the dark tunnels, our flashlight our only illumination. It cut through the darkness, exposing the rough stone walls and crumbling mortar holding them together.

Despite our growing tension and dread as we crept through the labyrinth, nothing nasty jumped out at us. Nothing, at least, until our final stretch.

“Oh, no,” Jacob pulled up short. Ahead of us, silhouetted by the soft glow of light leaking in from the storeroom, was our old friend the demonic salamander.

“We’re so close!” I groaned. “Now this?”

Jacob unsheathed his sword. “We can take him.”

I hefted my bat in silent agreement, and together we ran at the monster. The twisted amphibian gargled its response, nostrils flaring, and charged us, tongue lolling out.

Jacob reached it first, swiping downwards and slicing open one of its bulbous eyes. The creature screeched in pain, lashing out with a slimy claw, but the narrow hallway worked to its disadvantage, as it could not properly maneuver here. I stepped in as Jacob darted around the beast and delivered a crushing blow to its jaw. I heard something break, and a few jagged teeth were knocked out of its skull. The creature whipped around to face me, fixing its one cloud eye on me and gurgling angrily. Jacob swung his sword in a large arc, shearing straight through the front leg of the monster, who slumped forward, catching itself on its bloody stump. The creature suddenly hissed, flaring out gill like appendages from its neck and swaying side to side. Me and Jacob stepped back, hesitant, and we felt the atmosphere change.

It didn’t happen suddenly, like with the ghost. The first thing we noticed was a change in the air, a strange and foul odor reaching our noses. We could taste decay on the wind, and the passage grew humid and moist. Our clothes started sticking to our skin. A slight crackling sound came from all around us as dark vines wormed their way through the walls, breaking through the mortar to grasp at bricks, large, purple veined leaves unfurling.

The monster was growing. We watched, horrified, as the leg Jacob had just cut off regrew, bones lengthening back into their proper shape, blood vessels and sinews forming around it, skin overlapping it all and cinching it together. It flexed its new limb experimentally and fixed us with a terrible two-eyed stare. The creature itself had gotten bigger and meatier somehow, the gill appendages still flared out.

Jacob lashed out with his sword, cutting off the left three gills. The monster leapt at us, ignoring the wounds, but I slammed my bat into its skull, knocking it into the wall. It tried to turn, but it had lost even more mobility with its growth. One claw snaked out at me, but I jumped away and Jacob sheared it off with his sword.

“It’s regrowing already!” I shouted over the monster’s hisses. Jacob looked, discovering the unhappy truth: the gills he had cut were already healed, and the leg was rapidly regenerating in front of us.

“We have to go for the kill!” He shouted back. “Cover me!” He sprinted past the monster, opening a horizontal gash down its side as he ran by. The demon salamander whipped its head after him, screeching. I brought my bat down hard on it, slamming the creature’s face into the floor. It tried to rise, but I hit it again and again. I felt its skull crack beneath my blows, but the damage I’d done was healing already. Jacob chopped off the tail, eliciting a gargle of pain from the beast, ran up its back, and rammed his sword deep into the creature’s head, right where I’d been striking.

The monster fell still. Around us, the vines continued their slow expansion across the cobblestones.

“I think it’s over,” I said when the creature failed to rise. “Look, its tail stopped healing.” The place where Jacob had sliced the tail off was a strange, half reformed mess.

“Thank God,” Jacob hopped down from the amphibian and wiped his brow. “I was starting to think it was immortal.” We both stood there for a beat, breathing in the humid air.

“Do you know what it did to cause the vines to grow?” I asked, looking around.

“Not a clue,” Jacob responded. “It must have done something, though, because it definitely didn’t have the healing power before then.”

“Well, I say we get out of here before the ghost shows up, or this thing comes back to life or something.” I gingerly stepped over the creature’s body, and we headed up the incline, back towards the school.

&#x200B;

We emerged not five minutes later, standing in the mess of clothes we had thrown aside to expose the opening. Leaning lazily against the wall was Wayne, his sleeves rolled up. We both gave a start on seeing him. I noticed a strange tattoo on his arm, roughly in the shape of a trident.

“Wondered if you’d even make it out alive,” Wayne said, with something like begrudging surprise in his voice. “I must say, I’m impressed. What did you find?”

“You mean you knew about this?” I asked.

“Of course not,” Wayne snorted. “But it wasn’t hard to miss the ruckus you both created tearing the wall open.”

I paled. “Northrup—”

Wayne held up a hand, cut me off. “I’ve taken care of him, don’t worry. A little something in his drink to knock him out. Now…” He fixed us with an appraising stare. “What did you find?”

I mutely held out the notebook, and we stood in awkward silence for the next five minutes as Wayne scanned the pages, his frown deepening every second.

“This,” He finally said, snapping the book shut, “Is very helpful. Good work, you two. In one fell swoop we’ve discovered why the school’s a hotspot of supernatural activity as well as the demon’s origins and motivations. Which, I must say, are very troubling. Very troubling, indeed…”

“So…. You’re not mad at us?” I ventured.

“Mad?” Wayne chuckled. “I suppose I should be, after you two not learning your lesson and leaving well enough alone, but this time your gamble paid off. And,” He added, his expression darkening, “those old halls were rife with incursions. If you weren’t somewhat competent, you’d have never made it out alive.”

“Yes,” I said, “what exactly is an incursion, anyways?”

“A weak point between realities,” Wayne explained. “Where they seep through into ours. Here, let me show you…” He flipped Richardson’s journal open to the diagram of the Planes, the one I couldn’t understand. It showed seven labeled squares stacked but not touching. “Look, these are the different Planes of existence. We’re here,” He pointed to the one in the middle, “In the Physical World, and the ones bordering us are Subterra, directly beneath us, and the Cognitive Realm, directly above us. These two cause the most incursions in our reality. That is where we get the ideas of monsters and ghosts. However, these higher realities, such as Necromium, the second realm, or the Immaterial Plane, the sixth, can also sometimes break into ours. These are where the gods of our ancestors reside. They can sometimes spill into the Physical World, but, thankfully, it is very rare. They also bring with them a load of energy from the realms they cross through to reach ours, and that just complicates things even further.”

“And the top and bottom Planes?” Jacob asked.

“We don’t know, exactly,” Wayne said, closing the book, “As anyone who gets even a glimpse of them goes invariably insane. Even the denizens of the other realms do not know, calling them Ascendance and Descendance, respectively. Places of absolute order and chaos. Opposites. Extremes. The home of the true Gods, not the pathetic beings we once worshipped.”

My mind felt numb. So this was it. This was the way the world worked. Gods and monsters… I was overwhelmed.

“Anyways,” Wayne kept talking, oblivious of my reeling head. “Learning of the demon’s true plan – to break into our reality and assume physical form – is very troubling. Helpful, yes, but the problem is now we have to play catch up. If the demon manages to create an incursion large enough for him to come through, he would be nigh omnipotent here. Plus, there’s the possibility he could bring other unwanted guests with him.”

“But how would he create an incursion that size?” I frowned. “Actually, how do you create an incursion at all?”

Wayne smirked. “Those are questions our government’s top minds have been working on for almost thirty years, son. However, I think we might have an answer – albeit an imperfect, partial one. Thomas, remember how the demon can only access our minds when we sleep?”

“Yes, Karabasan said it’s because our subconscious has limited access to the Cognitive Realm,” I replied.

“Exactly. Those are practically mini-incursions right there, only the other way around. That would be the Physical World seeping into the Cognitive Realm. Here’s what I’ve been thinking: what if you get a large enough crowd together in one place? A crowd that is perpetually on the edge of sleep, always walking the line between the Cognitive and the Physical?”

“The barriers between realities would become thin…” Jacob gasped.

“Bingo! And since we learned that misguided Mr. Richardson has already unlocked the door for our neighborhood demon, all he has to do is open the door a crack, and then he’s in.” Wayne said. “Follow me. I think it’s time for you both to learn what I’ve been working on.” He led us out of the storeroom and down the hall.

“Wait, I don’t understand,” I cut in. “If he’s already got the sleep deprived population he needs, then what’s the point? Why hasn’t he broken through yet?”

“That’s just it,” Wayne grinned. “He doesn’t have enough yet. And we’re going to make sure he never does. In fact, we’re going to undo everything he’s been working towards so far.” We reached the end of the corridor and stopped at a large set of double doors. Wayne took his key ring and opened the doors, revealing the HVAC unit I’d seen him frequently working on. “I’ve been modifying the air conditioning system to be capable of circulating… heavier… gases through the school. Tomorrow, I’m receiving a special shipment of gaseous MAOI and smelling salts. We’ll hook up the cannisters here,” He gestured to a couple of open valves, waiting for the cannisters, “and turn it on. It’ll flood the school in a matter of minutes, jolting everyone awake, and, more importantly, severing them of the demon’s influence.”

“Genius,” I said. Finally, we were being let in. Finally, we had a plan. A good plan.

“The only thing is,” Wayne went on, “I don’t understand the demon’s end game. He doesn’t have enough kids to break the boundaries between worlds, so why continue to torment these? I don’t know how he’d be able to bring enough extra people who are already sleep deprived to the school to cross over.”

We all fell silent. Suddenly, Jacob gasped. “The talent show! The one tomorrow! It’s during school hours, remember? It’s at 2! And everyone’s parent’s will be there!”

My eyes widened. “Karabasan said he has access to the minds of everyone who enters the school, and most of those parents enter every day to pick up their kids!”

“So that’s his plan, eh?” Wayne rubbed the stubble on his chin thoughtfully. “That devious bastard. Too bad our HVAC will be ready and running by then.” He slapped the side of the unit good naturedly. “Sure, it’ll be close, but the cannisters are being delivered before noon. We’ll be fine.”

“We should probably stand guard at the room, anyways,” Jacob offered. “Just in case Kar- the demon tries anything before the talent show.”

“Good idea,” Wayne nodded. “I’ll be away for most of the morning, getting the cannisters. In fact, I don’t think I’ll get here until a little after lunch. If I’m not back by then… well, I’ll contact an old… buddy of mine,” He grimaced at mention of this. “We haven’t been on the best of terms for a while, but once I explain the situation he’ll come. He’s provided invaluable help before.”

“Great,” I said. “We’ll need all the help we can get.”

“Exactly,” Wayne said. “Which is why I brought you two into things. True, you’ve messed up,” Here he fixed me with a pointed gaze. “but hell, I messed up in the beginning, too. We all did. Perhaps I was too hasty in judging you. Perhaps I wasn’t. But now time’s running out for us. The demon makes his play tomorrow.” He smiled grimly at us. “It’s time to end this.”

&#x200B;

I’ve been so jittery typing this all up. I don’t know if I’ll get much sleep tonight, not with the prospect of finally banishing the demon on the horizon. One way or another, it ends tomorrow.

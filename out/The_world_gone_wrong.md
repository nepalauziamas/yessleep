September, 2017, I had a weird nights sleep, woke up exhausted and wanting to sleep more. Decided to wash my face and go to school.

Huhh!!, Weird I remember there was a painting here on this wall, where did it go. Thought my mom put it somewhere else.
 
And what's this, I don't remember watching these YouTube videos. 

Thought I was tired and thats why I am acting like this.

March, 2018, Some months go by without anything weird but everything felt odd. My friends, they weren’t behaving normally. 

Decided it was the upcoming exams tensions that made them like this but somehow deep down I felt as if I didn’t belong here. Felt as if I were a bubble inside water. 

Then when August came around, I was confirm everything did change, countless apps I remember being on Play store / app store weren’t there. The arrangement of wires and pipes changed, objects appearance changed. Clothes, books heck even the internet changed.

I didn’t know what had happened or how I am here. Did a wormhole open up, did our universe collide with another,  WHAT HAPPENED.

I searched around me for clues, searched the internet to no avail. Decided it was my life now, I am stuck here for eternity. 

Almost giving up hope I remembered the events that day, the last day normal for me. The very sequence of things done by me. 

I tried to do the exact same things, again and again and again. 



Woke up everything looked as if it was back to normal, searched the internet, looked at everything, it felt normal. It felt as if I was home. Those apps were back, those clothes were same again.Finally, I was back.I am back from that place. 

Forgetting about these peculiar events I went about with my life. 



Huhh!!, Weird I remember there was a painting here on this wall. Wait am I back here again, How this this happen Why??.

It didn’t felt weirder, everything felt wrong, looked wrong, WRONG.The sky, it was not the usual blue, the sun, it was dimmer, the moon, it was bigger or more like closer.

Internet was not affected that much but some aspects were not normal. Hard to notice.

Everything was relatively ok during the day but when night came around it got worse

WHY ARE THERE BIRDS, WHY ARE THEY CHIRPING NOW!!!! 

It was the last thing I remember from that place, my memory is hazy from then on, but I remember coming back. Much more relieved. I felt I was out of danger.




Huhhh!! Where is everyone, whats with this weird fog, what happened, why is the city empty 

SOMEONE HELP, ANYONE, HELP.............................help..

I heard a scream, it was something weird whitish  humanoid with wings. Screaming in a deafening sound.
I hid and waited for it to pass, scared but I didn’t make any noise. Just when I thought it was gone, It suddenly screamed from behind me, making me run. 

I ran untill I collapsed, opened my eyes to see my room, it was Just morning, real birds chirping, saw the yellow sun through a gap in the curtains.

I got up, kind of happy untill I saw a bruise like mark, almost as if I had fallen down while running.

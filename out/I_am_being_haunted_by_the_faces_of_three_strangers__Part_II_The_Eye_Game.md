It didn’t take long for me to realize that I had no choice but to do it. Play the eye game. With no idea who the young girl I was meant to be helping was, or even the slightest hint of a clue as to how I could go about finding her, burgeoning panic threatened to devour what little was left of my mind.

*Should additional assistance be required, the bearer is invited to play the eye game.*

Though I must have read over the guidelines a hundred or more times, this particular sentence had failed to stand out until that moment. I guess it had been diluted by the relentless threats of punishment, the carving of a woman’s face into my chest, the macabre butchering of my high school bully…avenues of distraction had not been difficult to come by. And as puzzling as the words were, they represented something of a last resort for actually getting this damn Mission going. I figured it’s what Jed must have done to track down his assigned trio. *There’s surely no way he could’ve applied sufficiently nimble detective work to locate them all by himself. Right?* One thing that hadn’t eased over these hellish past few days was my earth-shuddering insecurity.

I sat down at my desk, hovered a ballpoint pen over the book’s previous entry, and timidly jotted down the question: How do I play the eye game?

I leaned back and waited, analyzing my decision to write in the book with unconditional prejudice. *Did doing so constitute defacing the guidelines, as I’d been warned about previously?* Was it my responsibility to learn about this eye game all on my own—and if so, had I now sentenced myself to a barbaric demise before I could even get my Mission started? A second wave of similarly ghoulish thoughts was all set to strike before I saw the curious yet now familiar glow lift from the book.

*Those who play the eye game will be granted the bearer’s vision. The attributes gifted are not reversible. Is your final decision to play the eye game?*

The answer was painfully clear. But what would the “attributes gifted” be? How would they assist me? Would they even do any such thing? At this point the fatigue and frustration I harbored were holding my body physically captive—I’d inadvertently clamped my teeth shut, feeling like they’d crack and splinterize the same way I suspected my brain was moments away from doing. “Yes, it is my decision to play the eye game.” My hand was trembling so violently that the words were barely decipherable. I waited for something resembling an acknowledgement. A glow, a written response, *anything*.

I was close to penning an impatient follow-up entry into the book when it happened.

At first I thought I was having a seizure, a stroke, maybe slipping into cardiac arrest...some kind of devastating medical emergency. Considering what I’d been through, it would hardly have been surprising. But as I’d come to realize, the Mission would never allow me to take such an easy way out. From nowhere, I was hit with a stunning, incapacitating blast—an invisible surge of raw power that breached and then plundered my entire body. Thrust backwards and out of my chair, my suddenly ragdoll-like 240 lb frame sounded like a sack of loose bones as it slammed violently against the floor. Aside from my rapidly elevating heart rate, I felt completely paralyzed, an otherworldly power plunging me into a fully conscious state of rigor mortis.

And then I heard them. The sound of bootsteps, slow and sturdy, hauntingly rhythmic. Someone—*or something*—was inside my apartment. Best I could tell, the steps were coming from the bedroom, though I was unable to turn my head or even shift my eyes in that direction to take a look. The bootsteps came to a momentary pause, only to continue in the direction of where I lay pegged to the ground. Thud. Thud. I heard the bedroom door slowly creak, then open with an agonizing lack of urgency. The bootsteps continued, moving closer, approaching from behind my position on the floor. Thud. Thud. I heard no breathing, no ruffling of any clothes. Only languid, creeping bootsteps. Thud. **Thud**.

The bootsteps stopped a few inches short of the crown of my skull. A complete, unceasing silence followed. Someone was standing behind me. *Watching*. I felt the large, cold palm of an unseen man’s hand plant on my face—never in my life had I wanted to scream more than in that moment. I couldn’t even see who was doing this. I was powerless to do anything other than lie morbidly still. A second hand grasped the side of my head, before the two sets of thumbs and fingers started to feel around my throat, mouth, nose, and ears. The ice-cold digits finally settled around my eyes, before yanking them open with a callous vigor, releasing a surge of tears down the side of my face and obscuring vision of the now detached, non-interactable world that was my own apartment.

Then, for just a fraction of a second, I was able to glean through the opaque globs of tears nestled on each side of my nose and make out a vague outline of the intruder crouched behind me—he was lowering his thin, pale face towards mine, his jet-black eyes crackling with some kind of shadowy energy. I was forced to painstakingly process each moment of this depraved ritual. The man (*the Auditor?*) moved closer to my face—two lurid, empty caves glared down at me, before seeming to rest upon (but somehow not quite touch) the iris of each of my eyes.

Time stood still. At first I could see only darkness, jolts of what felt like electricity rippling through my body. Then I spotted a glimmer of brightness—it steadily expanded and engulfed my field of vision with beaming, incandescent light. *And then I could see everything*. I found myself journeying through an endless chasm of the hidden and unknown. Alternate planes of existence emerged and prospered before my very eyes, spawning hellish lifeforms that betrayed and mocked the fabrics of science—I could sense that each and every one of them was suddenly aware of my existence. But I didn’t feel threatened. Not yet.

I woke up. Or at least regained a fuzzy, warped sense of consciousness. Motion (mercifully) restored, I stumbled to my feet, attempting to control my body movements. I was disoriented, unsure of what had just happened. I was now alone in my apartment. The drastic shift in atmosphere confirmed that. But something (in a weird way I guess *everything)* felt...different.

The book was still open on the desk. Glowing. And placed right next to it was an old porcelain cup filled with what appeared to be water. I took a sniff and detected no odor. Seeing as the drinking vessel didn’t appear to be stolen from one of my local cafes or bars, I could be certain that it didn’t belong in my personal collection—had the Auditor (or whoever I had just shared a waking nightmare with) left it for me? Was drinking the water inside the cup part of the eye game? I mustered the courage to take a small sip. The liquid tasted like regular tap water. I chugged back the rest of it. After what I’d just been through, I’d almost stopped concerning myself with what might happen next.

I switched focus to the book. The entirety of the pages before my personal set of guidelines—all previously blank—were now filled with writing by hundreds, maybe thousands of different people. Flicking through, it was clear that the number of pages contained within the book was massively disproportionate to what its physical appearance would suggest—I could’ve spent hours gliding through the pages and not come close to reaching the book’s beginning. There were a multitude of different languages contained within, some familiar-looking, others decidedly less so, showcasing a vast spectrum of handwriting styles. The deeper into the book I burrowed, the older the scribed ink (and in more than one instance, blood, seemingly scrawled via a punctured finger) was. *Were all of these entries already in the book when I first received it, but I was unable to see them?* *Was this the result of playing the eye game—revealing the book’s complete content?* That alone didn’t seem overly helpful in regard to my own unique trilogy of problems, and a glance at my watch instilled a fresh sense of urgency. I thumbed back to my latest entry in hope of finding something useful.

*You have played the eye game. You now possess the bearer’s vision.*

Following this (disappointingly) brief addition was a hand drawn map, highlighting a congested intersection of freeways on the edge of town. To my recollection, there were no housing developments, retail outlets, or anything else of note even close to that particular area—only an assortment of long, hectic roads snaking in and out of town. Not the first place I’d think of looking for a young girl, but it was *something* for me to go on, and with only a few hours before my first looming deadline it certainly came as a relief. Before closing the book I noticed the handwriting that had been added immediately before my “chapter” of the Mission began...it was Jed’s. Though I’d not seen it since high school, I’d recognise it anywhere. There was no shortage of hate-filled notes and messages I’d received penned by that very hand. I figured I’d wait until I’d finished this first stage of my Mission before inspecting what he’d had to say.

As if it were the most natural thing in the world to do before leaving the house, I grabbed the blade that had marked my initiation into this unthinkable ordeal and nestled it inside my jacket. I could only hope that I wouldn’t be expected to use it. Stepping outside, the dusk air was cool and calm, a light breeze tickling my skin—there seemed to be more about my surroundings to *feel*. Closing my eyes, I came close to believing that I could detect and maybe even follow the trajectory of the moon’s journey across the sparkling, star-studded sky.

Those brief moments of solace and tranquility failed to prepare me for what I was to face later that night.

\*

For at least the first hour, my search for any trace of the girl was fruitless. With no public transport operating close to my destination, I had a taxi take me as close as it could to the assigned spot on the map. The glaring problem being, this complex road junction bears precious little in the way of accessible footpaths, instead offering only small walkways intended for use by maintenance crews and highway personnel. I felt lost and hopeless as ever, back to square fucking one. A stress headache simmered in my skull as I navigated the near endless sprawl of slip roads and interchanges, scores of drivers perplexed by the sight of me shuffling along the walls of tunnels as I no doubt looked indifferent to the blurs of traffic thundering by; little did they know I had much bigger problems on my mind. *Where could this girl be hiding?*

At my wits’ end, I noticed a series of manhole covers lining one particular stretch of road—it appeared they led down to a network of maintenance tunnels. Removing the first cover in sight and descending a long ladder into the industrial labyrinth below, I pleaded with fate that I’d find a light switch once I reached the bottom. *Surely I deserved at least that.* For what seemed like the first time in forever, luck was on my side. Small domes of illumination beamed down on intermittent pockets of the maze ahead of me. I started walking, shielding my face from the stench of gasoline and the sludgy trickles of sewage water gliding past my feet.

\*

The girl sat alone midway along the fifth or sixth tunnel of my exploration, and judging by the sounds booming out from overhead, we were underneath one of the intersection’s busier stretches of road. She was staring down at the ground, and though her body language suggested she had detected my presence, and was perhaps even expecting me, the girl barely moved a muscle as I made my steady, cautious approach.

“Hi, there. I’m sorry to startle you like this, but—”

“Please, don’t get too close.” Her voice was soft, a crackling of sadness permeating its cadence. True to the etching on my bedroom floor, the girl appeared to be around 7, maybe 8 years old, tangled red hair draped over dirty, unkempt clothes. Her pale skin stood out in the otherwise gloomy tunnel. “Getting too close to me is dangerous.”

I racked my brain for something affable, perhaps even reassuring to respond with. “Why do you say that? You don’t look dangerous to me. In fact, you look very friendly.” The silence that followed forged a blazing exclamation point on my failure. A moment or two passed. I decided to try again. “My name is Camden, and I promise that I’m not here to harm you, or do anything except be a friend. Does that sound OK?”

“I—” The girl grimaced. “I don’t think I have a name anymore.”

“Everyone has a name. I don’t think mine’s very common, actually. *Camden*. Have you ever heard of it before?” The lack of even a passing tinge of emotion was daunting. “If you don’t want to tell me what your name is, that’s totally fine. But can I ask, what are you doing on your own down here in this tunnel?”

The girl thought long and hard before replying. “It’s the safest place I could find. For other people, I mean. Not for me.”

A fleet of heavy-duty trucks passed overhead, city transit buses perhaps, causing the entire tunnel to reverberate. The sound of grinding engines lingered in the form of a deep, rumbling echo. I peered up at the ceiling—rusted pipes, cement-filled holes, brickwork that would suggest the tunnel was of questionable structural soundness. The girl could not have been less moved by the distraction. I edged closer to her, the aura swiftly changing as I did so. I wondered at that moment if my newfound sensitivity was nothing but my imagination at play, or perhaps something to do with the “attributes gifted” after playing the eye game? One thing was for sure—I suddenly felt the influence of a dark, ancient presence. The already poor air quality became flat out oppressive. I did all I could to resist gasping. Anything that might help keep the girl at relative ease and start talking to me. But I had no doubt—something else was in the tunnel with us.

“What do you mean by that? I’m sorry to ask so many questions, but—”

The girl looked up and made eye contact for the first time. “Some people used to hurt me. At school, I mean. Not at home. I used to love being at home.”

“Who are these people? Are they still hurting you now?”

“No. I don’t go to school anymore. I don’t have a home, either. And now *I* hurt people, and I can’t stop doing it. I really don’t like it. It makes me very sad.”

Moving closer yet to the girl, within touching distance now, I hoped I’d established at least some level of trust. “Y’know, somebody at school hurt me, too. It sucks, right?”

The girl looked up again and offered the slightest crack of a childlike smile. “You’re too old to go to school, silly.” It seemed like the first smile she’d attempted to make in a long, long time.

“You’re absolutely right. It’s been quite a while since I was at school, but I still remember it very well. The person made me feel very sad, and what he did still makes me sad now.” The irony of having this conversation with a girl the age Jed and I were when we first met was not lost on me.

“How long did the person hurt you for? Was it a bad person?” She seemed genuinely intrigued now.

Keeping myself together and not succumbing to the emotions I was feeling in that moment was as difficult as anything I’d done since this whole thing started.

“If I’m honest, the person never stopped hurting me. He’s hurting me right now, actually, even though he’s gone away.” *Deep breath.* “But tell me...why are you so worried about hurting people? Do you want to hurt me?”

Indescribable sadness formed in the girl’s face. “I don’t want to hurt *anyone*. It just...happens.”

“I don’t think you’ll hurt me. I think you’re too kind. And I know this might sound strange, but I’m actually here to help you, if you’d let me do so. Maybe starting with—getting out of this tunnel? Going somewhere warm and safe? How does that sound?”

“No. I’m sorry. I can’t do that. The only help I want is help seeing my family. But I can’t.”

“Why not? I’m sure I could help make that happen, but first you should come with me and—”

The girl’s demeanor made a swift, sharp transition. “You can’t help me. My family is now the same as me. *Dead*.” A brief pause. “But… But they’re a different kind of dead.” The girl looked at me with an expression no child should ever have to convey. “I don’t like being dead. Being dead is *scary*.”

I knew that we really had to get out of that tunnel. But I also had to get the girl back on my side. “I don’t understand how you could be dead, and also sitting right here, next to me.” I was of course lying through my teeth. I knew better than anyone that absolutely *anything* could be possible.

The girl appeared to collect her thoughts for a brief few moments before answering. “I don’t remember everything. But...I remember waking up. I was cold, and wet. There was a man in my room, sitting on my bed, next to me. His mouth was red. His face was red. I thought it might be paint, but it was blood, and it was my blood. Or I think most of it was.”

Looking at the girl, the childlike innocence she exuded, the fear in her voice as she recited her story...my heart broke a thousand times over.

“The man had been *biting* me. But it didn’t hurt. I didn’t feel anything, and I wasn’t scared. I don’t know why. I looked at the man, and I asked him, “What are you doing?” But he didn’t reply. He looked like he was going to bite me again, but then I heard a voice. It was a lady, and she was outside the house, and she sounded angry. She kept saying, “Not the girl. Everyone except the girl.” The man seemed scared of the lady, and so he lifted up off the ground, like he was flying, and went away out of the window. I haven’t seen him again. But sometimes I can hear him. I can hear a lot of scary people.”

My blood ran cold. Was this “man” the entity I could sense was close?

“Your family—did they also see this man?” I almost didn’t want to hear her response.

“Yes. There was blood everywhere, all on my pajamas, and my bed, and on my hands and feet. It was bad. I went to see my mom, my dad, and my brother… There was blood all over them, too. And they weren’t moving. None of them. The man had been biting them. And now they were all dead.”

Suddenly, the girl doubled over, as if in great pain. “Are you all right? What’s happening?”

The girl managed to raise her head, the act of speaking appearing to inflict yet more agony. “You… You must go now. It’s happening again.”

“What’s happening? What can I do to help?”

The girl looked up once more, a desperate glimmer in her eye. “Please. Go. I—I can’t stop it.” She began to shake uncontrollably, before collapsing to her knees. *“Go!”*

Clearly, this was not an option. But how was I supposed to help? The girl was writhing in pain, and starting to emit low, inhuman sounds. Like the growl of a wild agitated animal, but distinctly more sinister. I stood rooted to the spot, fear escalating, along with confusion as to what exactly was expected from me. I placed a hand inside my jacket, fumbling around for the dagger.

“I’m sorry, but I think you’re too late.” The girl’s eyes, now locked firmly on me, had turned a piercing yellow, while her lips trembled furiously. Sharp incisors started to protrude out from her gums...the primal growling steadied into more of a low, savage rumble. The surrounding atmosphere shifted more substantially. The child’s essence was vacating her body. In mere seconds it was gone—any hint of lingering humanity quashed. Her torso enlarged and distorted, while her newly sculpted, elongated face slid out from the shadows like a marine predator rising up out of murky water. Pure evil now veiled our surroundings...an insatiable bloodlust radiated from the creature the girl had become. I knew immediately that I’d be unable to prevent or even postpone the attack I was set to endure. The creature offered a wry smirk as it spoke. “The girl tried to warn you.” She absolutely did.

My instinct was to turn and run. The abomination before me somehow maintained at least some passing affinity to the tortured young girl with whom I was just talking. Not in appearance any longer...but I could sense that she was in there somewhere, trapped, a reluctant and forced passenger to the horrors about to unfold. I could feel the blade in my jacket was radiating heat, as if pleading with me to use it. *But I couldn’t.* My mind was made up—I was going to try escaping, outrunning this thing, just getting away somehow. This was a defective and absurd thought process. No sooner had I attempted to flee, the creature bounded towards me with astonishing speed and guile, far beyond that of any earthly being. The movement was rapid, effortless, unnatural—I was pinned to the ground and posed in preparation for a ceremonious kill in less than a second.

“I was sent here to help you.” Pathetic as it was, it was the only thing I could think to say at that moment.

“Maybe you were sent to help *her*, but certainly not *me*.” The creature grinned from ear to ear. “I have not yet taken permanent control of my vessel, but the feast your carcass will provide brings me one step closer.”

Before I could offer another word, the creature plunged its long, needle-sharp teeth into my jugular and began to extort all it could from the soaring flow inside. What little the creature allowed to escape trickled down my neck and pooled on the ground beneath me. My eyes rolled back in my head; my mouth gaped wide open.

I thought to myself, *Is* *this really the best I could have done? I was instructed to help save three people, and here I am, about to perish at the hands of a creature—a fucking vampire—and I didn’t even try to put up a fight?*

The end was close now, the creature gorging on its morbid feast with relentless, unholy zeal. I could hear the sound of cars, trucks, and motorcycles on the road above, horns honking, the screech of tires...mundane, everyday humanity commuting, oblivious to the stunning slaughter taking place beneath them. It was as I closed my eyes, waiting for the darkness of my demise to scoop me up and carry me away, that the creature first wretched.

*GAKK*

A sickening, choking sound. The beast could not have looked more confused.

It gagged again. Hard. Its eyes began to fill with blood, its cheeks quickly lined with streaks of it. Another forceful wretch—the beast spewing up at least a half gallon of what it had just extracted from me, splattering the ground with glistening puddles of crimson. Light-headed, lacking command of my senses, I could but watch as the creature stumbled backwards and propped itself up on the tunnel wall for balance. Another violent wretch followed, followed by a volcanic burst of blood from the creature’s mouth.

“What are you? How have you done this?!” The creature surveyed me up and down with a profound stupor, and perhaps even a hint of fear. “What poison is it that runs through your putrid veins?”

I had no answers. All I could do was gape at the diminishing beast, a fucking monster trembling amidst the final coughs and splutters of its accursed life. Toxic fumes began to rise from out of its mouth—what the creature had siphoned from inside of me was corrosive and now starting to burn. Seeping from the cracks and gaping sores forming in its torched flesh, more steam lifted up to and spread along the ceiling, forming a murky canopy of impending death…the stench of rancid meat filled the tunnel.

Despite the enormity of the situation taking place before me, a thought was rooted in my mind—recollection of my early years in Catholic school, where quick-tempered nuns would scold and even beat my fellow students and I for suggesting anything that contradicted the teachings plucked from their precious bible. And now here I was, alone in a dank service tunnel situated in the deepest guts of the city, witnessing the demise of a creature that no loving God would ever permit to exist.

Then, the reemergence of the young girl’s face. She was shining through as the demonic facade that had cloaked her crumbled. “Thank you,” The girl said. “Now I can do what I have wished for so long—see my family again. I think they are waiting for me. I can hear my mom’s voice. She’s singing, like she always did at bedtime.”

Before I could offer a response, the creature burst into flames, staggered around in a blind agony, and let out an appalling screech before crumbling into smoldering ash. I could feel the blade inside my jacket ease its forceful vigor. And that’s when it dawned on me—the water I drank earlier, left for me beside the book.

*A tool and/or weapon will be provided to the bearer for each stage of their mission.*

Holy water. It must have been. It was inside and flowing through my system when the creature attacked.

I collapsed to my knees and wept, first for the young girl and all she’d been subjected to, and then for myself.

\*

The liquor cabinet was close to the only thing on my mind as I walked in my front door, but I knew that I first had to inspect my bedroom floor. I needed some sign of closure; an indication that this first installment was indeed over. The girl’s face was still there, though the tortured expression featured most recently had slipped back into something more peaceful. Interestingly, a large X had been marked across the image, the newly added crossing lines a distinct and bright shade of red. I couldn’t help but think if the same would eventually be done to the face carved into my chest...if I even make it that far.

A full glass of bourbon in hand, I decided to study the book, maybe see if there was some information in regard to the Mission’s origins, its purpose...but of course, I had to start with Jed and his personal approach to correspondence with the mysterious tome. Seemingly less fearful of posing questions than I, he had requested additional help beyond the eye game (rejected); asked if he could recruit a group of friends to assist with the second part of his mission (sternly rejected); and queried whether he could complete the third part of his mission at a later date (rejected, with a grave warning of punishment). But there was one entry nestled amidst the nonsense that caught my attention: Jed queried when he would “stop seeing the strangers.” The response:

*You will never stop seeing the strangers. The attributes gifted by the eye game are not reversible.*

My tired, anguished brain managed to wonder what Jed had meant by “the strangers”, and who they could be. To my knowledge I’d not yet encountered them, though there was little doubt I’d be learning more (and very likely the hard way) soon enough. I sipped more bourbon over the next few hours, and with no new information yet added to the book in regard to my second “protectee” I dug deeper and deeper into past entries, going back at least a decade. There was little in the way of specifics regarding each individual’s Mission and how they completed it (or in many cases, clearly failed to), but plenty of material to send my imagination into overdrive: ghosts, leviathans, ghouls, jinni, dybbuk, werewolves...one person even mentioned a fucking mermaid. I did all I could to not think about what might be next for me, at least until the morning.

Ready to attempt getting some sleep for the first time in who knows how long, I closed my eyes and thought what if, just maybe, I’d already been through the worst the Mission had to offer. Bourbon-fueled wishful thinking. Not three hours later I was yanked from my slumber and as good as assured that things were only just getting started—a horrific, ear-splitting scream erupted from somewhere inside my apartment. Still half asleep and falling over myself searching for where it might have come from, I was in the living room when the second scream boomed out, stunningly loud, breathtaking in its ferocity—it sounded like a man vomiting his soul, the reverberation of its ruptured pitch puncturing my entire body with spears of pure, concentrated fear. I struggled to catch my breath, my ears now ringing uncontrollably in the devastating aftermath. For a split second I feared for my neighbors’ response to the shriek; the thought of dealing with cops at this point only intensified the nausea I was already battling. But I quickly realized that these desperate, diabolical howls were intended for my ears only. I stumbled into the kitchen and noticed that the face previously seen on my kitchen window was gone. I rubbed my eyes with disbelief before inspecting the pane of glass further—there wasn’t even a smudge to be found.

And then I looked up.

The kid’s face was now spread across the ceiling, covering close to the entirety of it. At least ten feet long and four feet wide, forged in the same chalk as the girl’s face in my bedroom, the detail of the image was astounding. I could make out individual pores in the kid’s adolescent skin, his eyes glazed with tears and wide with incalculable terror. What happened next caught me completely off guard—the face began to *move*. The motion was freakish and unnatural, like watching a protracted frame-by-frame breakdown of a man’s disintegrating will to live. It was clear that the face was set to unleash another bellowing—exhausted, paranoid, and fucking terrified, I clamped my hands over my ears as tightly as I could, afraid for the future function of my eardrums.

The third scream was unlike the two that preceded it. In no way did it sound human. The mangled frequency reached deep inside of me, my bones rattling in response to the cacophony’s shockwaves—each of the windows in my kitchen shattered in harmony, shards of glass sent flying as I ducked for cover on the ground. As the residual, pulsing echo of the scream eased into merciful silence, I peered up at the ceiling. I was transfixed by the kid’s face. Whoever it was, I don’t think it is possible to appear more afraid.

The book has started to glow. I’ll try to write more soon.

I 25F, live alone in a small cabin located in Nebraska. Ive heard stories around town of dogs disappearing and showing up the next day, dead at their owners doorstep. There have been five of these incidents thus far. Last week cows started disappearing too. There aren’t large predators like wolves and such where I live so this was weird. Five days ago people started disappearing too. I plan on moving out as soon as possible to live with my sister and her spouse. I should be moved out in two weeks. I dont want me or my cat to be the next victim in this weird situation. 

the other day ,whiskers, my senior cat, showed up after being gone for several days. I nearly cried in joy. I realized he was getting too old to go outside. I installed an extra litter box and some cat shelves. I know sometimes cats poop on the floor when they’re angry but whiskers wont even look at the litter box anymore. he somehow flipped over the litter box last night.(how the hell is that even possible?) He hasent been eating his cat food Either. Yesterday when I woke up I saw a mouse on the floor. (We had a mouse infestation) it was dead. It’s eyes were missing, it seemed to have rotted.i thought he had killed it last night? I praised whiskers even though he had never been a hunter. something was off with whiskers. I put him in a room tonight to see how he does. I’ll update tomorrow.

Whiskers was sitting in the kitchen this morning with a hoof in his mouth. It was surrounded by flies and had a gut wrenching stench to it. whiskers was starting to scare me. I took him to the vet today and they gave him a clean bill of health but the vet that I’ve known for years remarked he was slightly more aggressive. I told her everything that was going on and she recommended he stay the night at the vet.

my Garage has been stinking for several days at this point so I call , Josh, a family friend. He was able to locate the stench. A body. Whiskers’ body. his eyes were missing and flies surrounded him but it was him. We gave him a proper burial and rushed to the vet where allie, whiskers vet was nowhere to be found. The  lady at the front desk said she hasn’t seen her today . Im freaking out now. I call Allie but she does not answer. I call the police and they head to her house they said her body was found. Her eyes were missing. I’ll update tommorow.  
yesterday I stayed in a hotel after the events had transpired. I was up all night. I heard hissing outside. I came back to my hotel room after doing grocery shopping to find a rabbit in my bed surrounded by flies and with no eyes. I’ll update soon

It’s been five years since Animal control caught ‘whiskers’. It was put down and the small town I had grown to love was shut down for government investigation. Im in therapy still trying to process everything. Nothing made national news but has anyone else lived in plonybrook Nebraska?

I had sleep paralysis multiple times every year growing up but it started decreased as I figured out the trick to avoid them entirely ( I will talk about that later in the post).

My first memories I can remember I was barely 3 or around that maybe 4 so these were my first experiences with sleep paralysis and it was scary as hell, it started as me stuck in my bed and awake but I can't move and this dream or experience keeps repeating for few years until I was 5 maybe, I see these pencils like evil pencils they were alive and they had eyes they'd approach my bed and attack me they always had a goal to hit my eyes it was really scary one by one they'd jump into my eyes and I was in this sleep para state but by then I probably by figured out my method to prevent it and why I suffered from sleep paralysis but I wasn't aware so they stopped.

Fast forward few years I can't exactly remember everyone of them but I will write about the scariest one that I can remember vividly, I woke up in my bed and I was able to see my room as it is, dim light coming from the door but the room was dark and I can feel this overwhelming evil presence it's something you can't sense in your awake state and the closest example is to those familiar with hunter x hunter where they'd feel someone's aura and intent if that person is evil and how powerful. So I couldn't move but this most evil intent and aura that I ever sensed or thought about is all over my room and I tried to move but I couldn't , next to it I can hear voices and this weird language I never heard in my life it feels evil and disturbing and it sounded like a lot of entities are speaking .

I looked to my right and I can see this tall shadow figure near my bed and another one in the corner of my room but their heads were taller than my vision and something so heavy is on top of my chest I did a big mistake by trying to see what's sitting on my chest and through the whole thing I was screaming but I can't and I can't move it's so scary, then I can see this smaller old hag figure I tried to focus then her face is clear I can see it with all it's details she looked directly into my soul and that evil presence was coming from her and she was smiling she had a pure evil crazy smile and her face was the scariest thing I seen in my life. I managed to wake up and the room was in the same state so after getting into astral projection years later I understood that my astral body was able to see the room even that my body was asleep.

I had many more experiences where I'd have my face in the other direction so I can hear and sense things but I can't see them. a lot of times you will see shadow figures but the old hag only been there once and reading about this whole thing I noticed everyone sees the same thing and feels the same evil presence and shadow people in your room, ancient unknown languages out of this world . Vibrations you will feel weird vibrations and loud bangs in your ears that's perfectly normal and you can use those vibrations to leave your body using astral projection techniques.

So growing up I used to be scared af but slowly It turned into addiction and wonder like shit I'm interacting with something other than this world because I always wondered what's after death and why are we here and this kind of curiosity would make you fascinated with something like SP because it's new and real. It's scary but if you experience it enough you will enjoy it I don't know why but I used to did. Some of my experiences where weird like something is trying to eat my face not with physical teeth or mouth but rather my soul like dementors from harry potter, this thing would by loud sucking and vibrating my ear and my neck and face and you can sense a presence so close to your face.

Lucid dreams were one of the experiences that leads me into sleep paralysis usually, my l attempt I ended up walking towards my door trying to open it but something weird happened it's like my body is getting heavier and I'm becoming liquid my neck feels like it's getting drained and then I moved into my body again vibrations and sleep paralysis but I was too excited and ended up waking.

So you want it to stop or why I ended up having less and less of sleep paralysis ? Simple sleep on your stomach that's the only way to stop it and I've been a stomach sleeper for the majority of my life, I noticed every sleep paralysis experience happened when I rolled or slept on my back either by choice or unaware, so my theory is if you're the type of person that dreams every night long dreams or just dreaming more than the average person then if you sleep on your back you will experience SP a lot more often. If you don't dream at all or way less than usual then you won't experience SP but rather rarely.

I think I was somewhere around eleven years old when my parents decided to drop me off at my aunt’s house, since they didn’t trust me to be home alone while they were out in town. I hadn’t been to Aunt Lynn’s house since I was a toddler, but the place didn't seem to have changed too much from how I remembered it. Just like back then, the walls and floors mostly consisted of earthy browns and greens, and there were a bunch of weird old items sitting on the shelf above her fireplace like dolls and that kind of thing. 

Aunt Lynn said I was free to go wherever I wanted…except for the small door in the closet downstairs. According to her, it was a storage room with a lot of fragile supplies. Now, I was a bit of a rebellious troublemaker at that age, hence why my parents didn’t want me home alone. So, as soon as my aunt told me about that door, I immediately figured out where my next destination would be.

After my aunt went into the kitchen to cook dinner, I snuck downstairs to the TV room and quickly found the closet with the door she was talking about. I kneeled down to get a closer look at it. It was about half the height of your typical door, but other than that, there was nothing really special about it.

As I grabbed the knob and prepared to turn it, my brain became filled with a million conflicting thoughts. What if my aunt was telling the truth, and it really was just a supply closet? But surely there had to be something more interesting than that, otherwise she wouldn’t be so strict about it. If my aunt or parents found out I broke her rule, I could be in big trouble…but if I didn’t open that door, I would die out of sheer curiosity.

I turned the knob and slowly creaked the door open. It was mostly just black inside. I slowly crawled in, wondering if I’d be able to find a light switch. However, after blinking a few times, I was surprised to discover that the dark was gone, being entirely replaced with bright garish yellows, pinks, and blues.

I stood up and looked around. I was in an enormous room, with walls so high I couldn’t see the ceiling when I peered upward. The walls were mostly yellow, and decorated with rosy floral wallpaper and shelves of old-fashioned toys such as dolls and teddy bears.

I was so busy looking at the walls and shelves that I almost missed what was right in front of me. I lowered my head and noticed a little girl who looked no older than eight sitting down in the center of the floor by a bunch of blocks and a fancy dollhouse. She wore an old-fashioned frilly pink dress with blue trimmings, like something you’d see in the 1950s, along with knee-length socks and Mary Jane shoes. Her frizzy blonde hair was tied up in a pair of pigtails.

The girl had her head down, too preoccupied with her toys to notice me at first. However, after a few seconds of me staring at her, she turned her freckled face up towards me.

“Play with me,” she said in a stern tone, her large blue eyes staring straight into mine.

I was confused. Who was this girl? No one had mentioned my aunt having any kids. Was she babysitting for someone else? Was that why she told me not to come in here, so that I wouldn’t bother the kid?

“Who are you?” I asked.

The girl stood up. “Play with me *now*,” she ordered. 

I backed away nervously, before turning and making a mad dash towards the entrance where I came in.

Wait a minute. No. No, this couldn’t be.

The door was gone. There was just a flat wall where it used to be.

*What is going on?!*

I turned around back towards the girl, who now had her hands on her hips.

“Play with me, or you’ll be stuck here forever and ever and you’ll never see your mommy or daddy again,” she told me. This was when I noticed that her voice sounded less like an actual child, and more like a middle-aged woman mimicking a child’s voice. 

“O…kay,” I said, shaking nervously. If following this girl’s orders was the only way out, I’d do anything she said. I was already regretting not listening to my aunt. “What do you want to play?”

The girl gave me the kind of wide smile you’d expect to see a cat make when it spots a bird. She then stomped over to me and grabbed my arm. I noticed her hands were a lot larger than I expected for someone her size. With shockingly disproportionate strength, she pulled me over to the center of the room and threw me to the ground with my back facing upward.

“First, you’re gonna be my trampoline,” she said. Before I could protest, she leapt up into the air and landed feet-first onto my back.

I struggled not to groan in agony. She was a lot heavier than I expected her to be. Using my back as a launching pad, she jumped high up again, before I felt her hard shoes hit my back with even more force.

This went on for several minutes. My spine felt like it was going to snap in half any second. I was in so much pain I could hardly breathe. My eyes were welling up with tears.

“STOP!” I screamed. “OW, STOP! STOP THAT HURTS! OW!”

Soon, the girl stopped jumping and stepped off my back. I grunted in pain as I struggled to stand. God, my back hurt so much.

I turned to the girl and was just about to give her a piece of my mind when I noticed something odd.

When I first came in, I could swear her head was no higher than my chest. Now she was the same height as me. I couldn’t tell if my mind was playing tricks on me or if the girl had actually grown.

“Look…” I tried to say it in a polite tone. “Next time, do you think maybe you could be a little more gentle? That really hurt when you were jumping on me.”

“YOU DON’T TELL ME WHAT TO DO!” Her face turned reddish-purple as she screamed with enough force to nearly knock me to the ground. 

I turned around and tried to run to the opposite end of the room, only to fall over as the girl grabbed my leg and began to drag me back. Once again, her chubby arms had a lot more strength than you’d imagine, and it was futile to resist her.

I yelped in shock as she began to twist my right leg clockwise. Further than I thought was possible. It felt like it was going to pop out of its socket any second. I could hear snapping, popping, and cracking sounds coming from my leg.

I screamed and moaned as agony shot from my leg through to the rest of my body. I began to sob hysterically, my arms banging against the floor, blood rushing to my face. Tears and snot dripped onto the floor, forming a puddle right below my head. 

The girl eventually let go, but it was already too late for me to escape. My twisted leg still hurt like crazy, and all I could do was lay my head down, close my eyes, and hope the pain went away soon.

I lay there for who knows how long, before opening my eyes to the sound of many small shouting voices coming from all around me.

“Hurry, get up!”

“The door is right there, run!”

“She’s gonna get you, and you’ll never escape! Hurry!”

When I lifted my head and looked around, I realized that the toys from the shelves were now down on the floor surrounding me. They danced around waving their little arms and shouting at me in various distinct voices.

“Hurry!” said a skinny wooden man with a top hat and pointed nose. “She’s right there!”

“She’ll turn you into one of us if you don’t flee!” said a dark brown teddy bear with a red ribbon around its neck and blue overalls.

I tried to stand, but my leg had gone numb, so I just fell back down onto my stomach. I then flipped over on my back to see what the girl was doing now. What I saw made my heart sink into my gut.

The girl’s frilly pink and blue dress was lying on the floor torn, with her socks, shoes, and even her hair laying beside it. My eyes moved upwards, and what I saw standing at the far end of the room will continue to haunt my nightmares for the rest of my life.

I still remember the creature’s pale skin, and massive bloated body reminiscent of Jabba the Hutt. I remember its elephant-like pillar-shaped legs, and long wavy boneless tentacles where its arms should have been. I remember its doughy purple head with small beady eyes and a short hooked beak that reminded me of an owl or a parrot. I noticed dark dots all over the creature’s face, which looked exactly like the girl’s freckles.

As I sat there quivering with fear and unsure what to do, the creature’s head extended on a long snake-like neck, which stretched down in my direction until it was face to face with me. And then it spoke. 

“I’m not finished playing yet, pretty boy!”

The creature’s screechy growling voice filled me with adrenaline and gave me the strength to leap up and turn running to the now-visible door, in spite of my leg. I saw a giraffe toy standing by the door, rearing up to turn the knob and open it for me just in time.

As I dropped down to crawl through the dark entrance, I felt something rubbery wrap around my good leg and squeeze tightly, like a doctor’s blood pressure cuff. I didn’t have to turn around to know that the creature had me in its grasp and didn’t want me to leave.

All of a sudden, I heard the sound of all the toy voices shouting at once, and the creature let go of me, allowing me to crawl through the space as I heard it screaming at them in that horrible raspy voice of its. If I had to guess, I imagine the toys had somehow been able to distract it and cause it to let go, though I was too busy trying to get the hell out of there to check and see.

Before I knew it, I was laying on the green rug of my aunt’s TV room right in front of the closet. As soon as I knew I was safe, I didn’t hesitate to get back up and slam the small door shut, just in case something got out of that room that was supposed to stay in.

I sat there for a few minutes, inhaling and exhaling, struggling to get my breathing back to normal after what had just happened. Was it all just a dream?

I tried to stand up, only to stumble and collapse into the nearby armchair. My leg was still numb. I lifted my arm up to my face, and noticed a big red bruise on my wrist where the girl had grabbed me. 

That was not a dream.

I then heard my aunt calling me from upstairs, telling me dinner was ready. I did my best to hide my injuries as I headed upstairs, knowing she would find out I had disobeyed her orders if she saw my current condition. 

I quietly ate my dinner as Aunt Lynn talked on the phone. She then told me that my parents were on their way to pick me up, and I needed to get ready to go when I was done eating. 

As I put my jacket and shoes on, I took a final glance at the knick-knacks on the shelf above the fireplace. Then my eyes locked onto a doll that I hadn’t noticed prior. 

It was a porcelain doll of a little girl, no older than eight, wearing a frilly pink dress with blue highlights, knee-length socks, and Mary Jane shoes. Her frizzy blonde hair was tied up in pigtails, and her face had both freckles and big blue eyes.

The doll looked exactly like the girl I had seen in that door downstairs.

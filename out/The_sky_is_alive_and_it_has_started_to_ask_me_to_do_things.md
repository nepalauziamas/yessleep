The sky is alive. Not all of the sky, a big portion of it is just an endless snapshot of the cosmos. However, at night, for at least a two mile radius around my home, the sky is alive, and it has started to ask me to do thing. 

I first noticed the anomaly on a clear November night. It was 11:32 p.m. when I went outside. My cat had gone missing a few days before, and I thought I had heard her familiar meowing outside. I looked around my backyard, but the search turned out fruitless, with me only uncovering a few spiders that scurried their way across the patio. That was the moment I first heard it. 

With my eyes focused on the spider, above my head echoed down a noise that can only be described as ethereal. It wasn’t a scream, it wasn’t a roar. It was a high-pitched musical wail that rained down from the pitch-blackness of space. The celestial music continued as my eyes travelled away from the spiders, who themselves had paused, and looked up towards the skies. I saw nothing for a moment, and when I say nothing, I mean nothing. There were no stars, except for one. Directly above me, one bright, white star hung in the air, in a sea of darkness. 

A small distance down from that star, three more flickered to life at once. The inky blackness was disrupted by a gold, a green, and a purple glimmer in the air, all evenly spaced out. I’m no astronomer, but I had never seen or heard of stars like this before. The unusual lights show in the sky paired with the high-pitched moaning sent me scurrying back in doors. When I was in the safety of my own home again, I felt confident enough to look out of my windows. I saw the lights still meandering above my home, but the wailing had seemingly stopped. I searched for my phone and tried to capture the stars in a photo, but as anyone who has tried to take a photo of the night sky knows, the camera barely picked anything up. 

Just as I was placing my phone back into my pocket, the lights vanished, disappearing from the night sky as if someone had flicked a light-switch. The cosmos were dark again, with no speckles of light anywhere to be seen. Despite this, an uncanny feeling still resided in my head, as if something was still wrong. 

The night after that, I heard the meowing once more. As my eyes flickered towards my clock, my heart sank. 11:32 p.m. again. I moved over towards my window, and saw the four familiar lights in the sky, but this time they weren’t still, the gold, green, and purple ones were rotating around the white one. What really caught my eye, however, was a bright light emanating from my neighbours backyard. I fumbled with the door handle, before stepping into the silent garden, with no ethereal noises. My neighbours yard wasn’t illuminating anything, but instead being illuminated itself by a beam of light that shot down from the dark sky. The light remained fixed onto the ground for a few more moments, but retreated abruptly back into the sky, almost seeming like it was because I had looked at it. 

My neighbours garden has been abandoned since her death a few weeks before. She was a perfectly healthy woman in her late twenties, and had no previous history of mental illness or suicidal tendencies, yet they still found her dead, apparently having shot herself sometime around midnight. According to her family, a few weeks before her death she claimed she heard ‘voices’ speaking to her late at night. It was a tragedy, and tore up the whole community when people caught wind of it. It just didn’t make sense at the time, but the day after I saw the light in her yard, I began to understand. 

I can’t particularly remember why I did it, but the next night I waited in the garden until my watch told me it was 11:32 p.m. and like clockwork, the sky glistened with the stars. The noise had returned as well, but this time it was amplified tenfold. The beautiful symphony that had filled my garden two nights ago was replaced by a cacophony of swooshing, swirling, wailing sounds, all working together to make me cover my ears. I didn’t understand how nobody else could hear it. Surely people should be running outside to see what that awful, beautiful noise was. But they didn’t. Nothing moved. My eyes surveyed the landscape, begging to see movement, *any* movement, validation that I wasn’t losing my mind. Finally, my eyes landed on something moving, but it wasn’t a person. 

My eyes had landed on the sky once again, but not on a star this time. The sky *itself* was moving. A black protrusion shot through the air, a winding tentacle like-shape dancing through the air, almost perfectly camouflaged with the the rest of the motionless sky. Except, the rest of the sky wasn’t motionless. As my eyes flickered around, I saw more thick, long, dark shapes controleren and twisting above my head, miles into the air. The twists stretched out as far as the eye could see, a colony of movement expanding across almost all of the sky surrounding me. I could just barely see in the distance the twinkle of genuine stars, and wished that I stood there instead. Soon enough the whole the sky was scurrying around inside of itself, hordes of snake-like shapes twirling and manoeuvring their way, unobstructed by any clouds that usually would liter the sky. That’s when it hit me, why I had such an uncanny feeling whilst looking up at the cloudless sky. 

There was no moon. 

The sky continued its spectacular dance as I backed myself up into the wall, my body hitting brick as I brought my hands against my head, hardly even noticing when the screams of the night ceased, leaving me in total silence, however not for very long. The noises were replaced by a voice. It wasn’t a loud voice, it wasn’t booming or threatening, it sounded almost like a whisper, a spirit of words. 

“At eleven thirty two, tomorrow night, begin walking northwards until you reach *me*. Your path will be unobstructed, I will make sure of that.”

The movement in the sky stopped, and the lights flickered out above me, casting the backyard in total darkness, before I stumbled back inside my home, slammed the door, and leaned against it. There was no way I was going to listen to what it was telling me to do. Not a chance in Hell. 

My legs grew weary below me, and gave way, as I collapsed against my backdoor, my mind running wild with what the *sky* wanted with me. I found my mind travelling back to my neighbour, and her fate. The strange circumstances surrounding her death were suddenly not so strange, but she had been hearing voices for *weeks.* I wondered to myself how long it would be until whatever lingered in the sky took direct action against me, or possibly worse, how long it would be until I did it myself.

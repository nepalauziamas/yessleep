The day after we arrived home from escaping The Dark Carnival, my niece and nephew called, asking to hang out. Both had the day off from school, making it a long weekend. I fretted over the answer. I wanted to spend time with Nick because I felt unsure of what would change after he learned all the answers that had been kept from him. He offered they could come over to his place for all of us to hang out. I asked if that would be alright and he promised anything dangerous in the mansion was locked away. There would be no way the kids could get into something they shouldn’t and his adopted dogs would love having them around. So, we arranged for them and their guardian Brian to come over.  

Being teenagers, they loved the place, and the flaming skeleton dogs that towered over them. Neither even made it inside for a few hours as they played with the dogs outside and Nick brought out snacks and drinks for them. He'd become much more expressive lately. A normal person may call him shy instead of emotionless like before, and it turned out he’s great with kids. I think it’s because he listened to them and would get on their level, while also taking everything they said seriously. After how much fun they had on the first day, we couldn’t bring ourselves to send them home. I could only imagine how the trip made the kids feel. They were suddenly shown a mansion decorated in alchemy symbols, seeing supernatural dogs and meeting their uncle’s supernatural friends. The whole thing almost sounded like a plot of a young adult book.  

The next few days were spent hanging out with my family. Fleur and their partner caught wind of it and brought Audrey along. For a few short days my whole family was together, as well as Mage. He played with the kids by letting them chase him through the house, then demanded food as payment. Those three days will always be some of my most treasured memories. 

Sadly, they finally needed to leave but we promised they could come by again. The house felt too silent after they left. I had just gotten out of the shower when Nick got the call to report to the office. We weren’t having our big sit down talk yet, but Ancaer wanted him to look over how The Orchestra was doing so they could approve it whether it was ready to go out into the field or not. I promised I would be right behind him and watched him leave. Thinking back on it, I should have gone with him. After everything, I shouldn’t have let him go alone. 

It only took me ten more minutes getting ready before using the same door to head into the office. I asked around where Nick might be but got caught up with other agents and got delayed in finding him. First Marsh came by to show off his new leg that worked just as good as his old one. I let him talk with me for a few minutes and then got ambushed by Bandit. He had one of his smaller chubby brothers at his heel and they both hinted at wanting something from the vending machines. With money to burn, I bought them a few snacks. I was good to see them doing well after losing two of their brothers recently. By the time they got called away to do their job, I’d spent an hour in the office without tracking down Nick. Bandit gave me directions and even guided me part of the way to the weapons offices. When I did see Nick again, I didn’t recognize him until he turned around. The small smile on his face didn’t stop me from gasping and running over to him to touch his hair in disbelief. 

In the hour that we’d been separated, someone had cut his hair short. Very short. It didn’t look bad, and if he dyed it a darker color he would almost look like a guy from a 1950’s movie. But Nick liked his hair long. It was the one thing that really made him feel proud about his appearance. He would never cut it this short unless it was for a very good reason. He suffered through me rubbing the back of his head for a second or two as I sputtered out questions. 

“Who? Why?” I asked. 

“Ancaer said they needed most of it for testing. It's not that bad. It grows back pretty fast. I don’t mind.” He started and raised a hand when he saw my face grow red. 

“That son of a bitch! I can’t believe I was starting to be ok with him! How dare he do this! Couldn’t they take something else? Some blood or clip your fingernails or something? Where is he so I can kick his ass?” I asked with my arms crossed. 

Before he could answer, an alarm started going off. I jumped and grew tense at the noise. My hand flew to my side, looking for a weapon that wasn’t there. Nick quickly placed a hand on my shoulder to keep me steady after he saw my reaction. People around us didn’t look worried or scared and started casually walking towards the doors. 

“It’s just a drill. Sorry, I should have warned you. They’ve started to do them after what happened...” He explained. 

That fact made me relax a little. Instead of doing the drill, I wanted to track down Ancaer. No matter how much Nick said the haircut was fine, I refused to budge. He didn’t want a fight, but he didn’t want his partner upset either. Turns out a pair of agents needed to go outside the front to look over some charms as part as of the drill. Kind if like checking fire extinguishers during a regular drill. Someone saw Ancaer and Serval leaving out the front door a few minutes before the alarm started. We could easily catch up to them. No matter how much Nick pleaded, I was on the war path. His boss needed to be chewed out for what he’d done.  

We easily found our way outside. The new building appeared to have been made in the middle of nowhere, on a flat grassy field that looked to go on forever, some nondescript mountains in the distance. I didn’t have any clue where on the planet this place might be. The building looked totally out of place against the blue sky. I could see my target off in the distance and stomped along the dusty foot trail to him. Nick’s foot got stuck on an exposed root and he ended up being a few steps behind me. As I got closer, I saw Serval beside Ancaer holding something long and thin. Her face was stained with tears, which made me even more furious with him. 

“Ancaer! You bastard! You-” My rant got cut off when I felt as if someone just gave my stomach a light punch.  

I stared in disbelief at the sword in my stomach and the person holding onto the other end. Serval started to cry harder as the tears fell onto the hilt in her hands. The sword going through my side oddly didn’t hurt. My eyes started to drop as all strength left my limbs. 

“I’m so sorry. He said he would kill Luna if I didn’t do this...” She whispered, as my legs failed me. 

I fell to my knees, fighting to stay awake. All my energy was focused at glaring up at Ancaer and trying to read his stone-cold expression. I looked at the hilt of the sword again and my heart skipped a beat. Not only was there no blood, but I knew what she had just stabbed me with. We’d seen it during the dinner party. It was the Juliet blade. A sword that didn’t kill but instead put someone asleep for a day, yet made it look like they were dead. My blood froze when I realized something, Nick had heard about the sword but he never saw it. 

I looked over my shoulder toward Nick just before my body fell into the dirt. His face was white as a sheet after seeing his partner get stabbed right in front of him. His first thought would not be that I could be alright. His legs gave out, kicking up dust on the wind. Biting my cheek, I clutched my side. The stab wound had started to pinch and feel painful, exhaustion finally taking over. I refused to pass out before I told Nick I would only be asleep. I thought that because I had broken through spells before, I might be able to break this one. I may have just made everything worse instead. I got back to my knees to face Nick. I opened my mouth to tell him everything would be fine just as Ancaer started to walk towards him. My voice failed, causing me to barely get half a word out to him. 

“Snicker...”  

Another blow from the sword slammed into my back. Before Serval pulled it free, I started to see the cracks appearing on Nick’s face. Under them glowed a reddish pink light. The moment the sword pulled out and the spell hit me a second time, I only saw a burst of light almost like wings exploding from Nick’s back as my vision was overtaken by darkness. 

Something like a needle prick on my arm cut through my empty head. Then a few light slaps on my face brought me fully awake. I sat up, my body protesting, the effort causing brain to try and get caught up. There were too many things to take in at once, so I focused on who sat in front of me. Serval looked a bit beat-up and her clothing was filthy. In her had was a small dagger I assumed to be the cause of my arm pain. She rubbed her eyes with the back of her sleeve almost as if she’d been holding back tears. 

At first, I thought it was either sunset or sunrise. The dark sky and dimness of the field looked too strange for either. A slight wind blew in one direction the entire time and some odd noises rumbled. Looking around, I saw the reason for the odd light and sounds. In the sky floated a massive ball of light. Countless wings made of red light twisted and curled around each other. The rest of the sky shone a dark red in the area to the ball, gradually fading into a dark black. Parts of the field and everything else around us were slowly being sucked towards the light in the sky. Huge parts of the Earth slowly drifted upwards, the force being far more powerful directly underneath the twisting wings.  

I didn’t understand any of this. What the hell happened while I was out? Just as I started to ask, I saw something form around the ball of wings. It looked almost like a drop of water surrounding the light. It formed a tip that pointed downwards, then the light dripped off, causing some of it to fall to the ground. Whatever landed was too far away to see what it was. 

“Serval...?” I asked slowly getting to my feet. “How long?” I asked first for some reason.  

“Maybe an hour. I can wake people up early with the Romeo Dagger. Ancaer doesn't know about it. Come on, we need to keep moving.”

Taking my wrist, she started to drag me along the uneven ground. Not that much time had passed and yet the field had been torn up. The office building in the distance showed some damage as parts of it had started to get drawn in towards the light. I felt thankful that everyone most likely got out before this all happened. But that was planned, wasn’t it? Did Ancaer cause all of this to happen after the drill because he knew no one would be inside the building? My brain started to work slowly as I suddenly stopped, needing to know where Nick was. 

“Is Nick alright? Where is he?” I asked as Serval tried to keep dragging us along. 

Her answer was simply nodding her head towards the sky. I looked up at the ball of light and my entire body turned numb. This couldn’t be happening. I tugged on my wrist trying to walk towards it. She dropped the dagger to use both hands to keep dragging me away. 

“That can’t be him! I need to find where-” 

She lifted me off the ground and tossed my entire body aside when something flashed from out of the grass. A shape made of pure light and feathers came at her, hands tipped with claws out. She literally knocked it to pieces with a powerful kick. The thing burst into light, and the pieces fell to the ground then faded. I sat, not understanding what I had just seen. At least that explained why she looked as if she’d been fighting before I woke up. She wiped some sweat from her face and turned to face me. 

“From what I can tell from reading Aberash’s notes is that whatever was keeping Nick in human-form cracked. Right now, he’s a true stone for anyone to use. I would like to believe he’ll return to normal after someone uses his power. But..." She paused for a moment needing to collect herself. "The things dropping out from the light are something stones don’t have. After watching you two I guess he created a defense system. He doesn’t want to be used so his body started creating these things to keep people away.” 

I shook my head, not wanting to believe her words. Nick would never hurt anyone. Not even as a stone. My eyes went to the ball of light as more things drifted closer to be absorbed into it. Now that I looked harder; I saw more of those feathered shapes along the field. Soon agents would be here to fight them. What would happen? Would someone find a way to save Nick? Or would they pick the easier choice of finding a way to kill him? 

“Where is Aberash? If she’s been studying Nick then...” I stopped speaking after seeing the look on Serval’s face. 

“She’s in the clinic. Earlier today someone dropped her off pretty injured. I suspect Ancaer got the jump on her because of the healing injuries on his knuckles and because he’s the only person I know who can match her power. She’ll be fine but we really could use her right now...” 

This all felt to be too much. I slowly sat down with my head in my hands, so Serval let me have a few moments to get collected. Two people I loved dearly got hurt while I had done nothing to stop it. And for what reason? Ancaer didn’t need to do any of this. If he wanted to use Nick’s power he could have just asked. Nick might not have liked using himself as a tool, but he would have done anything he could for others. What was so damn important all of this needed to happen? 

“I’m so damn useless. I’m Nick’s partner but I let him think I died and I’m pretty much dating Aberash but I didn’t know she’d gotten hurt.” I said, unable to help myself. 

Serval looked a little surprised by that last comment. She helped me back to my feet fearing we might get ambushed by one of those creatures again. 

“You’re with Aberash? That’s... Eh, Weird. I thought she only liked girls but I guess I got that wrong.” She commented. 

It was an odd thing to bring up considering our position. It still made my stomach turn. It wouldn’t have felt like this if Ancaer didn’t try and warn me away from Aberash early. It only gave his statement of her trying to use me for something more weight. Again, I started to pull on Serval’s grasp directing us towards the light. 

“I need to reach Nick first. Whatever Ancaer wants to use him for, I won’t let him do it. Not after everyone he hurt. I hate using my partner but there isn’t any other way now. I should just see if he can use his power to never have been created as a stone in the first place.” I said bitterly. 

I had heard that in the wrong hands, Nick could be used to change the entire world. I didn’t know if that meant re-writing the past, but it sounded possible. Serval suddenly wrapped her arms around my back in a tight hug as she buried her face in my shoulder. 

“Please not that!” She begged. I felt confused and let her go on. “If he wasn’t a stone, he might not have become an agent. And if you two weren’t on Luna’s case I would not have that child. Nick has suffered because of what he is but... He’s done so much for us. You have as well. So please, let us be selfish. Let him keep those burdens of his past and don’t take my child away.” 

It wasn’t just Luna’s case we’d had a good outcome on. So many people as well as his pets were alive and happy because of Nick. I’d met so many people and made a ton of friends in the year I’ve known him. As much as I hated everything he went through, I knew he would gladly do it all over again if he knew just how much good he put into the world. He may have lost a father, a partner and an unknown number of siblings and yet he never got tempted to use his powers to change any of that. If I used him to fix his past, so many others would suffer. That was the basic idea of alchemy after all. Everything came at a cost.  

“I won’t.” I told her softly. “I’ll just use his powers for a really good sandwich or something. But I need to reach him before Ancaer. Where is that bastard anyway? Don’t you think he would have gotten a head start?” 

Looking around I realized I hadn’t seen any sign of him when I woke up. In the distance, the sky started to change to a dark reflective blue, but it couldn’t reach too close to the light. I knew it was a barrier created to keep normal people from seeing any kind of supernatural nonsense going on but the magic wasn’t stronger than Nick’s own power. We were running out of time while agents were starting to set up things. 

“He got blown back from the explosion. I knew it was coming and grabbed you to get away. I don’t think he’ll be awake for a while after that. Even if he does recover, I don’t know if anyone can get close to Nick. I can’t get closer than this. So much magic is pouring out it’ll overload anyone before they reach him.” She explained. 

That sounded like a problem. I didn’t want Ancaer to be able to use Nickie, but that also meant I couldn’t get closer either. I watched as she got down to draw something in the dirt. So much of the field had been torn away as the pull kept dragging in small pieces towards the light. With her circle done, she reached in the dirt and pulled out a sword I knew very well. I took the clean black scabbard, feeling how much stronger The Orchestra had gotten while it rested. I felt like I had another partner the moment the sword was in my hand. 

“I have a theory... You should be able to reach him. Your willpower has dispelled a charm once before, right? I think you won’t get overloaded if you stay focused on your goal.” 

Regardless of her theory, I would have tried reaching Nick anyway. I refused to let him stay like this. We both finally had a home and a family to return to. Nothing would get in my way of saving him. Serval agreed to bring me as far as she could, so we both took off toward the light and toward the person I loved like family.  

As we got closer, she started to look more and more worn out. The magic in the air was affecting her more than the brief fights she had with the feathered creatures. They didn’t appear to want to harm us, but rather to keep us from getting any closer. We ran directly into a small crowd of them. I took out a few with The Orchestra, only to have more appear. Just when I thought she might get hurt; the creatures suddenly sank into the ground, the area having turned into a muddy mess. Looking over my shoulder I saw the cause of it.  

“Marsh!” I shouted over to him.  

He met us halfway, ready to take over fighting for Serval. She explained what was happening as fast as she could, and he agreed to help right away. He started moving with me as she fell back to let everyone know what happened.. His power easily took care of any creatures that tried to attack us, but even he started to falter around so much magic. Just as he started to get overwhelmed, more help came in the form of almost identical-looking numbered agents. 

“I can’t get any closer, but I’ll support you from here friend.” Marsh explained. 

I needed to keep moving. I paused long enough to give him a hug and thank some of the agents that came along to help. They said that they heard I’d been in the field when the light appeared and wanted to see if I was alright after I had treated their brothers so kindly. Along with them I could have sworn were the three mailmen brothers, but didn’t have time to check. I honestly felt so lucky to have known all of them. We parted as I started to run. I needed to start avoiding parts of the ground and debris that were lifting into the sky. 

The air felt heavy and I couldn’t run for very long. Even if I wanted to keep going, I got stopped by a wall of those creatures that were wandering around and tripping over parts of the ground getting pulled up. I sent out a few shockwaves, breaking a few to pieces. The Orchestra was a magic creature in its own right. The abundance of power in the air also affected it. It was so focused on not taking in too much of the power around it, that it couldn’t fight the way we wanted. One of the creatures grabbed a hold of my arm and it took everything I had to get it off. This was a battle I couldn’t fight alone. In the distance I noticed how much Marsh and the others struggled. I needed to keep going forward for them and for Nick. 

More of those claws tugged at my clothing, getting more desperate in their attacks. If this kept up, they could hurt me. I cursed Ancaer for starting all of this, and for my own lack of power. Just as my vision started to get blocked by all those forms, a crack echoed through the sky as glowing circles appeared at my feet. 

Out from them came faces I knew very well. First Hot Sauce crawled out, ready for a fight. She didn’t pause, and tore into a creature while on all fours with her sharp teeth. I would need to thank the hell out of my Frankie after all of this for helping. Then, for some reason Elizabeth came, followed closely behind by Earnest. She wasn’t an agent and I didn’t think she would drop whatever she’d been doing to help. Turns out the three of them were very well matched and worked together with their firepower awesomely. 

I managed to pull free from a crowd of light creatures by only killing a few of them. When the rest turned and almost reached me, a dark shape came out of nowhere to pin them down. A hand landed on my shoulder and I jumped when a wispy voice spoke in my ear. 

“Don’t die on me. We still need to see that new bookstore.” Nightshade said with a smile under his long black hair. 

His bodyguard didn’t look over as he used his dark claws to tear through the threats. When he did pause, it was to wave at me and then go back to attacking.  

“We have this covered over here! Serval told us what’s up! Keep going and you better not die! You’re invited to my wedding!” Elizabeth shouted from where she fought. 

I couldn't even respond before Clear came running up, her dress in her hands so she wouldn’t trip on it. She scolded everyone for leaving without her and Elizabeth shouted back that she took too long with her makeup and needed to be left behind.  

They almost fought each other instead of the creatures around us. Even while they shouted, I found myself getting emotional from all the support. A year ago, I never would have thought I would make such important friends. Nightshade gave my back a push to make me start to move again. I managed a few steps and was blocked again by a massive pool of light coming down. A flood of those creatures came pouring out and the group focused on them. Another drop came down and I glanced up to see yet another drop already starting to form in the twisting ball of light. I didn’t think Nick was doing this on purpose, but he must somehow be able to feel so many powerful creatures gathered in one spot and wanted to keep them away from himself. These things were weak, but enough of them could probably kill one of us.  

I shouted a warning, knowing we needed to fall back before more of the drops of light fell. The ground rumbled and drowned out my cries. I got knocked to the ground as something else appeared in the sky. A giant hand reached out to swat away the light before it hit the ground. I followed the massive thing to see a creature bigger than most buildings sitting in the field. Its face was covered in long hair and the body looked almost familiar.  

I couldn’t even ask who just showed up to help as another person swept me into a tighter hug. I knew who it was right away just from getting suffocated by her chest. 

“Sorry I’m late! I was making dinner for my boys! They’re a bit further back. I didn’t want them to get too close to danger.” 

I pulled my face from her grasp and looked up at Charlotte. Did everyone I know show up to help? I thanked her for coming by and for the encouraging hug.  

“Who is that?” I asked, pretty amazed by the larger creature. 

“Oh? I think his name is Tippie. I’ve never met him before. I heard he’s pretty strong but had disappeared for a while recently.” She told me while she easily punched away a creature that dared get close. 

I kept looking between her and the giant. Tippie? It couldn’t be... I mean, Tippie wasn’t a common name but the little Tippie that worked in my office couldn’t be this thing in the field. The little shy Tippie that would cry at a drop of a hat and found lost pets. I would need to ask them to confirm it later if I managed to get away safely. 

“You need to hurry along. We’ll take care of things here. We have someone stronger who can take you the rest of the way, oh, here he is!” 

Charlotte waved over another person I knew, his pale face nearly glowing in the darkness. He wasted no time and grabbed my wrist for us to start running again. As I left, I heard the rest shouting some good luck messages. 

“Remember to make it to my wedding!” 

“Bookstore trip after this!” 

“Be safe, I love yo- I mean!! We’ll, we’ll all, j-just...” 

Hot Sauce slipped up and panicked when she realized what she said. Trying to get everyone distracted, she spouted out a sea of flames, but I also think it covered her screams of embarrassment. The one dragging us along looked back with a raised white eyebrow. 

“I heard you had a lot of female interests, but...” He commented. 

“Shut up Tooley.” I told him shyly. 

With the help of so much backup, I finally managed to arrive almost directly under the light in the sky that my partner had turned into. Only one thing stood in our way. The man I had started to hate for causing all this. We stopped a few feet away from him knowing just how strong he was. Tooley kept me partly hidden behind him in case the other man attacked.  

“Ancaer, what the actual fuck did you do all of this for?!” I shouted, while Tooley held me back. 

The taller man didn’t even look in our direction. I wanted to kick his ass but we weren’t strong enough. At least, not until more of our help arrived.  

“I hope I’m not late!” The shorter man called out while jogging up. 

My mood immediately improved when seeing him. Moore had come by to offer assistance. Him and Tooley hadn’t met before but they both nodded at each other. They somehow knew they would stand a chance against Ancaer with the two of them. But the kind man wasn't the last of the people arriving. From behind some debris, I could see a person trying to peek out. Moore called them out and the man jumped. He came slinking over, his face covered with huge sunglasses, a scarf and a baseball cap. He didn’t get too close but I could tell who he was from only meeting him once. 

“What’s the dick of a necromancer doing here?” I asked in a flat tone. 

“Necromancer? There isn’t one of those here. Just a person who wanted to watch the end of the world for shits and giggles...” He lied. 

Whatever, him standing around wouldn’t hurt. I ignored him, ready to confront Ancaer again, expecting him to try and fight us at any second. 

“Don’t worry, we can easily hold him down here with just the two of us. We believe you’ll be able to reach your partner soon.” Moore said in his kind tone, which made everything sound better. 

They could have fought with Ancaer on even terms if I hadn’t made a mistake in the past. One I never thought would come to bite us in the ass the way it did. I didn’t even think about the item I handed in after it had been out of my hands. 

“I’m exchanging everything to fix this world. I’ll rewrite it in the way it should be. I’ll even sacrifice my own life for this goal. I cannot let you get past me.” Ancaer spoke in the calmest tone I've ever heard from him. 

He pulled a very small object from his pocket. Something that was nearly lost between his huge claws for fingers. Even at a distance I could spot what he held. With Tooley still keeping an arm around my chest to keep me still, I carelessly said what I thought Ancaer held. 

“Oh, that looks like that Silver King hair I took from the Hunter. I heard creatures couldn’t hold it.” I commented. 

The three around me froze, knowing something I didn’t.  

“Hey so uh, you wouldn’t happen to know if that’s just regular Silver King hair or original hair...?” The Necromancer asked in a stressed tone. 

“I heard it was original, why? Is there a difference?” I asked, but should have clued in from their reactions. 

The necromancer got down to the ground to frantically dig as if he wanted to get away but had forgotten he had magic. Moore got in front of me, but I could see over his head and watched Ancaer crush the glass vial and shove the fragments inside his mouth. The results were instant. All of the color was gone from his body as it twisted into his other beast form. He looked ten times the size from when I saw him last. The bear and lion hybrid was almost glowing with a pure white mane flowing in the wind. The hair he ate had boosted his power but altered his mind. From his mouth poured a magic blast that missed us, but I worried it might have hit someone else as it flew along the field, burning away anything it touched. Another came directly towards us and we couldn’t even move. I felt Tooley hold on tighter and Moore tried to use himself as a shield. Even the Necromancer got up to do something about the blast. If it hit, we would all be dead. It didn’t take an expert in magic to know that. 

But it didn’t hit. We all braced for a death that did not come. All sound stopped as we slowly looked around at the world suddenly frozen around us. The necromancer let out a sigh of relief only to jump back with a screech of fear when a cackling laugh started nearby. I really didn’t blame him for that reaction. I didn’t want to deal with the one being powerful enough to freeze time either. 

Dark claws came walking over the frozen ground as the laughter died out. Tooley kept a hold of the weak human in his arms, ready to fight the monster that appeared. He flinched when he saw Moore walk towards the dark creature with a smile on his face. 

“Oh, hey Fee, what’s up?” Moore asked, almost too casually for the situation at hand. 

“This whole thing looked too fun to pass up! Good thing I arrived or else you all were about to be roasted. I may supply some help if one of you cuties let me borrow your body for some more fun for-” 

“Help us or else I break your skull.” I cut in, completely done with his crap already.

Both Necromancers gasped but for different reasons. Moore couldn’t hold back a laugh at not only my tone but because I was still being held like a naughty cat. I couldn’t even follow through on my threat but the fact I said it endeared me enough to the creature to agree. Fee crossed his arms and the black tendrils moved behind his head in thought.  

“Two minutes. I’ll keep the world frozen for that long. Nothing more. It'll give the human a chance to slip by but unless my student fights with you, the monster is going to kill you all.” Fee pointed out. 

We all looked over to the tall thin man, expecting a positive answer from him. We saw that while Fee was speaking, he had gotten halfway inside an opening to a different world. He froze when he realized so many eyes were on him, unable to defend himself.  

“No fucking way my dudes. I’m getting the hell out of here. You’re all welcome to come along but I'm not sticking my nose in-” 

A noise caused me to glance at Moore. He'd tugged on his shirt and the top button popped off making the necromancer stop speaking.  

“This shirt is pretty flimsy. I might rip it in the fight...” He hinted. 

Quickly the other man got out of the tear between worlds and it closed behind him as if it was never there. His face reddened under his disguise and his feet were unable to stay still. I couldn’t believe that was all it took to convince him. I would never understand necromancers. Moore really was too good for him but I didn’t say anything.  

With that settled, Tooley released his grip on me and started to get ready for the fight. I stood; my legs tensed as if I was at the start of a race. The retired agent told me he would be opening his face and asked me not to look at him when it happened. I promised I wouldn’t, unsure of what he meant by that. Fee counted down to three and started our two-minute timer. I took off, running as fast as my legs would carry me. Tooley wanted to carry me over as far as he could, but didn’t know if he would get back to the others in time. Unless those three were together when time started again, they risked losing each other's lives from how powerful Ancaer became. I thanked my past self for taking up jogging so soon after starting to do supernatural cases. When the world started back up again, I had hit the start of the upwards debris pile. I stopped to catch my breath and to look back to try to see how the fight was going. I couldn’t see much between all the magic and Ancaer moving at such a crazy fast speed. I broke my promise to Tooley when I accidentally saw what his face really looked like. His human face had scars that pulled back to reveal something so terrifying and yet so beautiful I almost couldn't look away. Saving Nick suddenly came back to the forefront of my mind, and I peeled my eyes away from the sight. 

Now that I had gotten this close, I didn’t know what to do. Whatever force pulled up the hunks of Earth didn’t also pull at my body. All of the pieces were too high up to climb on them. I couldn’t get a grasp on any, and I cursed at my lack of skill. I didn’t even think a professional rock climber could get hooked into the dirt or stones before they were pulled upwards. When the ground underneath my feet started to shift and burst upwards, I assumed it was from the force dragging more in. I fell to the ground and then into something solid. My body was being lifted up, but not by whatever pulled on everything else. I’d landed in a giant hand, a smell of vinegar and eggs becoming overwhelming, and I knew right away who had come. 

“Are you that troll?” I asked, stunned. 

The twisted face was covered by long greasy hair. Most of his body still remained underground as the hand lifted me over to the closest hunk of dirt, and set me down to be slowly lifted towards the light. 

“You and your partner were the only two in my life to show an ounce of respect. I thought I may return a small favor, and it looks like you needed it right now, Half and Half. Short people like you cause problems all the time, I swear.” He grumbled, trying to sound big and tough but failing. 

“Thank you! I owe you a few gallons of pickled eggs!” I shouted back down at the troll as he lowered himself back into the ground. 

A smile came from under all his hair. His teeth were stained and crooked but I liked seeing them. So many people had got me this far and I was so thankful for all of them. If I hadn’t met Nick, I never would have gotten to know any of the ones who raced over to try to save him. Most were risking their lives for the two of us. Ancaer wanted to rewrite the world, but no one was fighting to save it. They just fought to rescue one agent that had only recently learned how to smile freely. 

The piece of dirt I'd been placed on moved upwards too slowly. Very carefully, I started to move to another slightly higher one, grabbing a hold of roots praying they would support my weight. I couldn’t waste time. I needed to reach Nick before Ancaer broke free from the fight and started to head this way. I nearly fell from a crazy height and feared I might die before I could finish my task. I heard the fighting going on below me, and a rumbling came from the sky above. To my ears, it almost sounded like crying. 

“Hey stranger, need a lift?” A voice swooped in. 

“Gully, what are you doing here?” I scolded the huge seagull flying in circles around me. 

“I have a charm that absorbs magic! I can get you a bit higher!” The bird offered. 

As much as I didn’t want her in danger, I needed to accept her help. I dropped onto her back as she took off, flying upward and dodging debris in the sky. More of the office building had started to get pulled in, and we needed to be careful not to hit any pieces of it. If this went on for too long, I was afraid of how much more would get taken in by my transformed partner. We got so close but were still maybe a mile away, when the wind and the air grew too heavy. I could see how Gully started to strain and I knew her charm had gotten overloaded. Not only that, but I heard a roar below. Risking a glance, I could see a white shape jumping from the piece to piece of land, and pulling itself upward. She needed to go. Ancaer would be on our ass in a few minutes, if I was lucky. He would rip her apart if she stayed. I could handle the rest on my own. I directed her to a bigger piece to land on. Her body shifted to a more human shape to catch her breath. 

“Just... Give me a second. I can go the rest of the way.” Gully said in a strained voice. 

“No, you need to go back. The charm won’t last if you get closer and I’m scared it might break before you get far enough away. It’s fine, you did more than enough.” I said, aware of how little time I had. 

For some reason, aside from the difficulty to breathe, the magic wasn’t bothering me as much as it did her. She raised her head and appeared distraught over not being able to get me the entire way. Leaning over, I placed a kiss on her forehead, truly thankful for everything she had done so far. I did still care for Aberash, but it seemed like that didn’t stop me from liking Gully and Hot Sauce at the same time. Her face reddened a little at the interaction. 

“If you gunna give me a smooch, do it like a man!” She huffed, causing me to laugh. 

“After I save Nick, I promise I’ll kiss you properly.” I responded. 

That was good enough for her. She went over to the edge ready to leave, but gave me one last scared look. 

“Later tater.” I told her weakly.  

That got me a little smile. She fell backwards to start flying towards the ground. I hoped Ancaer hadn’t seen her and just continued in my direction. I quickly went back to climbing, the sword in my hand making the climb more difficult. The sword mentally told me to just drop it but I refused. We would be reaching Nick together. I swore we would. I had almost made it. The light nearly blinded my sight and the rumbling sound shook my body. Just a few more feet and then I could, what? I tried shouting Nick’s name, unable to hear my own voice. To my surprise, calling out for him did something. The wings of light shifted, making me see a new shape within it. I thought I saw a person made of light for half a second. To confirm what I’d seen, a hand came reaching out. It was made of the same light as the wings but I knew it would be solid if I grabbed a hold. Just one more step upwards and I would be able to reach his hand.

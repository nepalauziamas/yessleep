In high school, we would get alot of substitute teachers. My peers didnt really mind this since all of the subs were very unorganised and didnt know what to do with some of our classes. And we mostly got to be as loud and crazy as a nightclub rave. Honestly, i was the only one there that actually cared about my education and i was practically the "nerd" of the school. Dont get me wrong, i was actually popular and had ALOT of friends, my family kept telling me that i only need 2 or 3 friends, but i wanted to be the guy who fits in, ya know? 

About 3 years into my highschool, my math teacher was sick for a week, and we had a substitute teacher for that time. And before i knew it, the students went absolutely berserk. This sub was actually really smart and i could tell he was a very "old school" type if person, he was in his 50's or 60's by the looks of it. Just like every other time we had a sub, i was the only one that had my page written down with all the stuff to do with what we were all suppost to be learning about. The other students didnt care.

The next math class i had which was a day later because i have math three days in a row (i know it sucks right). I had the same substitute teacher again. But this time felt a bit off. He didnt act the way he did last time and i notices a small scratch mark right above his left eyebrow. I dont know why but my curiousity came over me and i asked why he had a scratch mark, he just stood there staring blankly at the back wall of the classroom, "must be crazy" i jokingly thought as he snaps out of my blank stare. "Oh.. uh im sorry what was that?" The teacher says now completely unfased. "I said why do you have a scratch mark sir?" I replied in a very acknowledgable way. "Oh dont worry about that young man, that was just my cat, hes a bit crazy sometimes ya know?" He said outloud again in a half sincere tone. I nod my head in agreement and he turned around to write down on the whiteboard that covered the whole front side of the classroom.

The next day, math class came around and when i seen that we had the same teacher again, i sat down with a slight unrelieving way, rolled my eyes and opened up my book. But when all of us seen the teachers face we almost threw up, litterally. All of the students were half gagging and i too stood up and opened the window on the left hand wall of the classroom and almost threw up out of it. I remember that greenish and rotting face being consumed by a colony of rageful and hungry maggots. The teacher just stared right at me, honestly if it wasnt for the fresh air i think i would be swimming in a pool of my own guts. 

The only thing i could do is run out of the classroom, and i think some of the students kept tripping over eachother because of the rush they were in to get out of that classroom. When we got out of the classroom i immidiately called the police, it shoulve been the ambulance but i couldnt really think straight. When they got here. They found the teachers head completely fallen off from the decaying body and his skin turned pure green because of the flesh eating maggots. I feel like this has to be the most disturbing thing i have ever witnessed. We never actually got to know what caused this to happen but i think i didnt want to know anyway. All of us called that the "face of death" incedent.

Lets just say we were very grateful we could have our normal teacher back the next week...

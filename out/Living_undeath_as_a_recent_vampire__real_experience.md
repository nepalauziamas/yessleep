 

**Hi, I am a 23yo F, you can call me Denise and this is my story as best I can explain it.**

*The  first two parts of my experience I also posted of reddit sometime in  the past when it happend ,though they were taken off reddit at that time  and my original account is lost unfortunately. I think it is important  to show you all of it from start to finish,so I am writting it again.*

**How it all started :**

Some  3 months ago I was with my friends at a party ,everything ok and boring  for me because I cannot drink alchool , I have stomach problems .  Nevertheless we had some fun,left the party early and went to a friend's  house to chill . After a couple of minutes I heard some of his friends  came in to join us ; several hours passed and because it was getting  very late I wanted to leave for home .

Some  friends of his decided to take me home in a car but before we reached  the car, we saw several men out in front of the house ,many who looked  drunk but I wasn't expecting any kind of trouble.As I walked passed the  car to get to the back seat , waiting for the owner to let me in, a man  aproached from that group and told him to get inside the house because  he was needed by someone. It appeared to me the owner knew this guy  because he did exactly that, without opening the car or telling me  anything .

I just stood there for a  couple of seconds then decided to walk back in the house to see if he's  still willing to take me home or I should go on my own.( I had my  driver license suspended due to an accident few years ago ) I went in  the house, couldn't saw the owner and said goodbye again to some friends  while I was thinking of my journey home ,because the public transport  at that hour doesn't work ( about 4:00 AM )I live in eastern-Europe by  the way , I don't know if in USA the public transport system differs,  but in that same time a man that was outside apparently walks in the  house with two more guys and it caughts my attention.

He  had a medium brown/darkish hair ,slim with loose clothes ,very common  looking actually but that wasn't the thing that caught my attention.When  he entered the house I just had a strong feeling comming from him that I  cannot describe that well. He looked at me, he had dark-brown glassy  eyes ,didn't said anything but then he started to move around and like  nobody was noticing him,even the two guys that went with him and that's  when I realized his movements were so ... unnatural or weird ,like as he  was going further it seem like he was going backwards , his arms were  behind his body as he moved .

The  feeling I had was not fear though, like you would be scarred of the  unknown like ghosts ,demons,the dark, a horror movie etc this was a  feeling I had a few times when someone died or saw something very  graphic and gore related ..kind of the same feeling and my brain just  rewired in a way like you suffered a real psychological trauma , I swear  I could feel it in my brain , it was the same feeling I had when I  watched someone years ago falling off the stairs with blood running from  his ears,it was not fear but like the brain rewireing itself somehow.He  looked at me intensely wich seem at that time a very long period and I  couldn't move , I now remember opening my mouth halfway and just staring  back at him , eyes wide open and fixating my vision at him but didn't  wanted to make contact with his eyes. Subconsciously, I think I told  myself not to look for some reason. He never spoke a word or someone  else engaging him .. he went straight for the door afther making these  rounds inside the house and for a second he stood under the door  entrance and turned his head again to look at me , he was pale white and  in a way evoked the same feeling in me as before. He left . I tried to  gather and tell myself that there was nothing wrong , nothing wrong at  all in all this and left my friend's house for home.

I  forgot about the whole thing while outside was freezing and me walking  in the snow ,feeling sleepy and tired until I saw him again near a  closed travel agency building, he was ahead of me leaning against the  glass walls. He didn't seem to notice me but I knew then that it was him  ! I switched sides on the sidewalk to get some distance and with one  eye looking over in his direction. He noticed me halfway and smiled  shortly..couldn't see his face better because of the snow and distance  but I noticed his mouth was deep red,almost bloody . I picked up the  pace ,worring that he might follow but he stood his ground , and shortly  after we were out of range and on my way home.I tend to smoke a lot ..I  had this irrational fear when I got home and lit up a cigarette with my  window open that someone might come in ,and I was thinking of him  specificially ..though I live in an apartment at the fifteenth floor..

Nothing  happened of course and I went to sleep.To this hour I am writing this  ,I remember vividly the same feeling I had when I encountered this man  and I can't shake it up ! Somehow I get a mental image and visualize  this man as I did back then, somehow not human and yet human enough not  to be afraid in a way I would be of the deep supernatural. I guess only  one words came to my mind when I think of him , a sort of vampire though  strangely enough it's not from any book of fiction or myth I know of  ..but I keep sensing him like that, don't know why.

I  could tell myself that this is nothing out of the ordinary but the  experience and the feelings I went through were anything but ordinary. I  have to keep in mind that I can't ignore them and subconsciously I give  them credence.I am sure now more than ever this was not a human, I  sensed he wasn't human from the first moment.

**The change:**

Turned  out a sort of attack already happend three months ago and I couldn't  realize it until recently. I can't explain it other than I don't  remember anything about an actual assault on me. I was feeling very off,  major tiredness and mental fatigue along with some red dots on my  shoulder and bruises,wich now dissapeard. Next couple of weeks I done  medical investigations and even psych evaluation  for weeks , except for  depression and anxiety they didn't find anything  wrong. After a month  or so passed then I really changed, it was a slow  progression of  whatever I had and now, 3 months later in the whole  thing, that is the  only explanation I come to is that I have been  turned. I been in  hospitals for 2 weeks full of investigations ,even  psych evaluation and  they didn't find anything wrong back then my  external appearance is  not that changed, I have my upper canines a bit proeminent though not  like out of the ordinary, I can still eat though very little and  most  things taste like plastic, I mostly eat fluid stuff like soup, I'm a bit  pale, I noticed proeminent veins appearing on my skin now and then   ,mostly on my extremities, hands and feet and around my eyes and   cheeks,but they tend pass and my eyes dilate very much from normal into  hard black ,though my original eye colour is brown. My heart is barely   beating, though I feel fine . I have 12/5 heart rate and 25 pulse.. by   all accounts I should be dead or in a coma right now!

Am   i a sort of "vampire" i don't know,that's what comes close to my mind   right now..If I am right, I believe sooner or later that man or someone  else will come  and find me and I'll be forever quiet about what I told  you just now. So while I still can, I told you my experience. I don't  know where it will lead

**Aftermath to this day:**

Since  then I have received annoymous messages on my phone from someone  telling me everything it's ok and I will be fine soon. Besides social  media I haven't talked about this with my irl friends. He also tried to  call me but I never responded. In my text messages he reffers to himself  only as "M" ,though we didn't had a conversation per say,more like 3-4  messages in all. The last message I received was telling me he knows  everything about me and I should stay low for a while.

Nobody  "came for me" and nothing happend in that context except those phone  msg. This is now the begining of the 4th month since it all started and I  can barely stay awake during the day. I live alone,so nobody suspects  anything. I know someone from a medical center and asked him jokeingly  if he could bring a bloodpack for me. He took it as a joke and never  responded back on this subject. I was serious about obtaining one  however, and got hold of once since I can barely eat any solid food.

At  first I was reticent,but it didn't seem repulsive to me,wich shook me  because I mostly had a repulsive reaction to seeing blood, let alone  smell it or touching it. I opened it up with a knife and soon as the  smell reached me I instinctily took some of it with my finger and tasted  it.

I can't really describe the  sensation.. I never took hard drugs in my life, so I'm assuming it's a  simmilar experience somehow to that without the bad effects to it. All I  know is that it fill me up,like I had a black hole inside me and this  was "star stuff" to me. I have 2 more packs in my fridge and I am aware  that I can't get anymore for now. This happend last week.

My  thoughts on friends, carrer,family just vanished to this day. I don't  know how I am going to make a living or have a social life like I had  before. People who know me just call me and I lie to them saying I am  employed part time and can't be bothered with meeting them.

I  can't take any chances of people finding out who I am so don't ask for  photos. I recently made a twitter account just to joke about my  situation telling people I am a vampire. Ofc nobody actually believes  me, wich is fine by me,less stuff to worry about. I watched and touched  crucifixes no problem, I take baths, have no problem with running water  and I can go wherever I want to at night without someone's permission. I  still have sexual desires and I'm good in that deparment. Garlic ,holy  water I actually had some from aunt in my apartment and doesn't affect  me,except for me garlic like any food literally tastes like metal. I  know it all sounds very dumb, but I tested every preconception about  this..it's amusing nontheless..

In  the end I don't think I have become a "bad person" or violent person, I  still have emotions and all the memories that I have. I am still me in  that way. I can say that I believe I am a vampire 90% or perhaps fully  and don't look for anyone's validation,you can disbelieve this from the  start,it's entierly up to you. I know that in this day and age even if I  were to show you my apperence , my clinical data people will say it's  all fake, so I'm not even going to bother with all that. I can tell you,  since I also brought an oximeter is that i have barely a pulse,many  times it's not even registering anything ..though I feel fine like I  never felt before. I shouldn't be alive and typing to you by no medical  standards but here I am.

So, I  don't make this post to change opinions,it's not even about you,the  reader.. it's more like I'm writing this for myself. If this post gets  taken down or my account then so be it,perhaps I will write again...

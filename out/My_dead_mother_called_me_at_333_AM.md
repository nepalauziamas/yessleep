I was never a superstitious person. I never believed in ghosts or witches or any of that nonsense. But there was one thing that I couldn't explain away, no matter how hard I tried.

It started with a phone call. I remember it so clearly. It was 3:33 in the morning, and I was jolted awake by the sound of my phone ringing. I reached over, half-asleep, and picked it up.

"Hello?" I mumbled into the receiver.

There was no answer. Just silence.

I was about to hang up when I heard something on the other end. A soft breathing. And then a voice. A woman's voice.

"Hello, my son."

I sat up in bed, suddenly wide awake. "Mom?"

I hadn't heard my mother's voice in years. She had died when I was just a child.

"Mom, is that really you?" I whispered into the phone.

"Yes, my son. It's really me."

I felt tears welling up in my eyes. I had so many questions. How was she alive? Where had she been all this time?

"Mom, I've missed you so much," I choked out.

"I've missed you too, my son. But I'm not really here. I'm in the after-life."

"The after-life?"

"Yes. I'm in a place called Heaven. It's a beautiful place. You'll see it one day."

"Heaven?"

"Yes. But I'm not allowed to stay here for long. I just wanted to call you and let you know that I love you. And I'll always be watching over you."

Then the line went dead.

I sat in silence for a moment, clutching the phone to my chest. I was in shock. Had I really just talked to my dead mother? It didn't seem possible.

But it had happened. And I knew that there was no explanation for it.

The following night, I was woken up again by the phone ringing. I reached over, half-expecting to hear my mother's voice on the other end. But instead, there was a different voice. A man's voice.

"Hello?" I said.

"Hello, my son."

It was my father's voice. But he had been dead for years. Just like my mother.

"Dad?" I whispered.

"Yes, it's me. I'm in the after-life too. I wanted to call you and tell you that I love you."

Just like that, the line went dead.

I was shaken. I didn't know what to make of it. My parents were both dead. And yet, they were both calling me from the after-life.

I tried to rationalize it. Maybe it was a prank. But who would go to such lengths to prank me? And how would they even know about my parents?

No, this was something else. Something paranormal.

The following night, the phone rang again. And again, it was my mother's voice on the other end.

"Hello, my son. I just wanted to tell you that I love you."

And then the line went dead.

This continued for weeks. The phone would ring at 3:33 in the morning, and it would be my mother or father on the other end. Just telling me that they loved me. And then the line would go dead.

I tried to ignore it. But it was impossible. The phone would ring every night, at the same time, and I knew that if I didn't answer it, something bad would happen.

I didn't know what to do. I was trapped.

One night, I decided to answer the phone. And to my horror, it was my mother's voice on the other end. But this time, she sounded different. Her voice was filled with terror.

"Help me, my son. They're coming for me."

"Who's coming for you, Mom?" I asked.

"The demons. They're coming to take me to Hell. Help me, my son. Please."

And then I heard a scream. A blood-curdling scream. And then the line went dead.

I was shaking. I didn't know what to do. My mother was in trouble. And there was nothing I could do to help her.

The following night, I was woken up by the phone ringing again. I picked it up, half-expecting to hear my mother's voice on the other end.

But instead, I heard a different voice. A woman's voice. A voice that I didn't recognize.

"Hello, my son."

"Who is this?" I asked.

"Your mother's spirit guide. I'm here to help her. But I need your help."

"Anything. Just tell me what to do."

"I need you to come to the after-life. I need you to help your mother cross over."

"How do I do that?"

"I'll give you a number. A phone number. When you call it, you'll be able to speak to your mother. You'll be able to help her cross over."

"Okay. I'll do it."

I wrote down the number and then I hung up the phone.

I knew what I had to do. I had to call the number. I had to help my mother cross over.

But I was scared. I didn't know what would happen to me.

The following night, I summoned up all my courage and I called the number.

A woman answered the phone. "Hello, my son."

"Mom?"

"Yes, it's me. I'm in the after-life. But I'm not in Heaven. I'm in Hell."

"Mom, what happened?"

"The demons came for me. They dragged me to Hell. I'm in so much pain, my son. Please, help me."

"I will, Mom. I promise."

I heard a scream. And then the line went dead.

I was shaking. I didn't know what to do. But I knew that I had to find a way to help my mother.

I started to research. I read everything I could about the after-life. And I quickly realized that I was in over my head.

But I didn't give up. I couldn't. My mother was counting on me.

Finally, after months of research, I found a way to help my mother. I found a way to cross over to the after-life.

But I knew that it was dangerous. I knew that there was a chance I would never come back.

But I had to try. I had to help my mother.

So, I took a deep breath and I crossed over.

I found myself in a dark place. A place of endless pain and suffering. I could hear the screams of the damned. And the smell of sulfur was so strong that it made me gag.

But I pushed forward. I had to find my mother.

And then I saw her. She was in a cage, her body contorted in pain.

"Mom!" I cried out.

She turned to look at me. And I saw the terror in her eyes.

"My son," she whimpered.

"I'm here, Mom. I'm here to help you."

I reached out and took her hand. And then I started to pull her out of the cage.

But something was wrong. I felt a force pulling me back.

I turned around and saw the demons. They were coming for me.

"No!" I screamed.

But it was too late. They grabbed me and dragged me away.

And then I woke up.

I was back in my body. Back in the real world.

But my mother was still in Hell.

I had to find a way to help her. I had to go back.

But I was scared. I didn't know what would happen to me.

The demons had warned me that if I came back, they would kill me.

But I didn't care. I had to help my mother.

So, I took a deep breath and I crossed over again.

And this time, I was prepared. I was ready for the demons.

I fought them with everything I had. But they were too strong.

They dragged me away. And they threw me into a cage.

And then I saw her. My mother.

She was in the cage next to me.

"Mom!" I cried out.

"My son," she whimpered.

"I'm sorry. I'm so sorry."

"It's okay, my son. I love you."

"I love you too, Mom."

And then the demons came for us.

They dragged us away. And they threw us into the pits of Hell.

And that's where we remain. Forever tortured. Forever damned.

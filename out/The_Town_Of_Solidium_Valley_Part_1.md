 Hello everyone, My name's Derek, Derek White. I was born in a small town called Solidium Valley. That, according to google, doesn't exist. Now my town isn't big at all but big enough to be able to find on google maps or well if you search for it. But no nothing. I find it strange how no one I've talked to online knows about my town. I've tried to drive away from this place but I could drive on that gravel road for hours before turning back to the town and be home in minutes. Others have tried to burn down the houses and the town as well. But the fire doesn't burn the houses and the person who tried it goes missing the day after. Everything has been tried but nothing works. IF you got anything that might work I'd be more than happy to listen to it.

Let me tell you a little about my town to give you an idea. So all the houses are old, maybe from the 30's or 40's. They're all made out of some kind of wood. I'm not sure what type though, It's not Pine or oak or anything I've seen before. It's a gray looking wood and it somehow seems that it had been fitted yesterday. The roads are old and worn out. You can see the dirt under the sand/gravel road when you walk on them. I find that strange since all of the houses look brand new. The main road of the town runs like a straight line throughout the whole town. It has massive oak trees in different ages standing tall on the sides of the road. You can almost hear their growth as you walk past them. Everything seems normal until you look closer. Every other year a new house appears in this town, with people that's sure they've lived here their whole life. But the other folk here know for a fact that isn't true. But regardless of our efforts they're sure that they've lived in this fallen down old town as long as they can remember. We just stop arguing with them about it. But you see the weird part about it is that they can recall events that have happened with you or towards you, that's actually true... It gives me the creeps.

You see, the reason why I'm the person that's typing this out and not everyone else, is because we were the first family to live here. You see, our house was the first one or so I've been told. So I'm pretty certain that it's true. But yet again, who really knows how or why this is happening to us. But something is certain, it's not of this world. The town folk just live life as everyone else I guess. The only thing that's really strange about this place is the...guests. Now we get guests that come over from time to time, the problem with them is that they're not human. They look like humans, speak like humans and eat like humans. But they're not...Trust me.

I work at the town's diner, I'm a waiter here and I've been since I was just 14. I took a job here to make some money to spend with my friends around the town. But in recent years I've spent them at the town's outsider market. It's a weird place. Everything is cheaper and you can buy things you've never seen before. Stuff like.

These are just a few things you can find at the market. But the thing that always intrigued me was the old lady at the very back of the market. She told you your future for the coming year. Now she didn't want any money. She only asked for a small fee. Now I don't know what that fee is but I'm not sure I want to know either. She always smiles with a large grin that spreads ear to ear when she says it. I'm fairly sure that she's not human either. In other parts of the market that comes we have everything you can imagine, regular stuff too. Food, clothing and other items. Now this market looked like those farmers markets you can see in movies and TV-series but the real difference between them is that this one lasted one week and exactly one week. No I'm not talking in an almost type of fashion rather an objectively true statement. The market just appears in the morning at 07:00 AM, never earlier and never later, then disappears 1 week later at exactly 07:00 AM. I don't know how they do it; they just vanish into thin air and then appear like they've been there for years. If I would try to explain how this market looked I'd like you to imagine those tents with boxes under them. The roofs of these were made of tarp like sheets in various color stripes on a white background. The poles were made out of vertically placed wood and were fastened with wires bolted onto large concrete blocks molded into the ground. Now these concrete molds aren't there when the market leaves either; it's just gone, and the place is replaced by old crooked pine trees that seem to be older than the world itself.

Not a single person has ever attempted to try and cut down the trees, I honestly don't think you can. Even if you could, I'm not sure how the market folk would react to it, I'm not interested in finding it out either. It's a weird feeling, I'm not scared of them, I'm just Unsettled by their nature. The primal feeling that you're being hunted kicks in when you spend too much time in the market. I try to avoid it or be very quick with it.

Now we have some rules we need to follow. Well, It's not rules, but rather, mild suggestions. Something to keep you safe while living in Solidium Valley. I'll list them down below:

1. Don't talk to the lady at the market. She won't ask for money but you'll pay with something much worse.
2. Don't go out tonight, the watchers will see you.
3. Never talk to the mailman, he's not as friendly as he seems.
4. Don't order the Chicken plate from the diner.
5. Never visit the graveyard during the day.
6. Don't venture off into the forest, you'll never come back.
7. The old apartment building is not habitable. No one is in there. So whatever you do, do not let anything out.

These were just a few things, the major things you need to know to live in my hometown. Now, the reason why I'm writing about this now is because these past 2 years have passed and a new house hasn't appeared. The only thing that's different these years then the other years that's passed is that someone. Someone opened the door to the apartment buildings and people started to go missing. I can't think of another reason besides the opening of the apartment doors, I'm not sure what's roaming the streets but I can feel it watching us, oh so carefully. You don't see it or hear it. All you do is sense it, all of the hair on you stands up simultaneously and you feel the primal instinct to get as far away as you can from it.

Then we have the watchers outside. You see the watchers aren't too bad, they're just there you see them walk around, or rather hovering of sorts over the ground. It's hard to explain it for those who haven't seen them. The watchers are tall 7 foot 5 I would say with long slender arms and legs. They roamed the nights when we were sleeping but these days the watchers have avoided some areas like they were scared of something. That I find particularly interesting, or rather scary actually. I've never seen these watchers behave like this. They're usually the cold unsettling entities as they always are. Maybe I'm just crazy, everything might be fine, I might just not remember it right.

Anyway I'll tell you more about this place some other time. You don't want to be up later than 11PM. Weird things happen after that. Good night people I wouldn't want a night with no sleep...

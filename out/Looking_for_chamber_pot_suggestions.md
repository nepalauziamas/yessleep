I live in a run-down apartment to save on rent. I share it with a few roommates, and we all share one bathroom. The light switch in the bathroom is all the way at the far end of the bathtub from the door. Basically, you have to walk in and walk another ten paces to get to the lightswitch. For some reason, the bathroom is really big despite being old and rundown. The bathroom has a window to keep it light during the day, but obviously that doesn't work at night.

This results in a dilemma. When you need to go in the middle of the night, do you walk all the way to the bathroom light switch, turn on the light, close the door, do your business, open the door, turn off the light, and then turn off the hallway light before running back to bed? Or do you just stumble around in the dark and save yourself a lot of walking?

As I’ve moved in and gotten used to the furniture and don’t stub my toe as much, mostly I just stumble around in the dark.

Today when I walked into the bathroom during the day, I noticed this weird hole in the wall. It was about the size of a fist. It definitely wasn’t there before today, but I didn’t think much of it. It’s a crappy rundown apartment, and who knows what my roommates do when they’re mad. It’s just a hole. Ignore, document for security deposit reasons, and go on with my life.

Well, tonight as I was stumbling around in the dark I noticed a weird noise coming from the hole. Kind of a weird shifting? It sounded like fall leaves. Or like a litter of rats rubbing against each other.

I did my business and turned out the light. Then as I was stumbling back to bed, I accidentally brushed against the hole. That was the worst mistake of my life.

The noise got louder. Much louder. And it was punctuated by scratching and these weird squeaks. Think a cross between a mouse and a cicada. I went back to turn on the light, looked in the hole, and it was much bigger. All I saw was darkness and a mass of eyes.

I went to get my phone flashlight to look in the hole. Dear God, I wish I didn’t.

You know how snakes are scary? Well, these things looked like rotting snakes. They stared up at me with icy eyes of fury. Like nesting mothers protecting their young. They started to rattle and hiss. I shut my flashlight off, but the rattling didn’t stop.

None of my roommates know how the hole was made. My landlord said she can’t send someone to fix it until the week starts on Monday - two days from now. The shifting sound has only gotten louder.

It’s the only bathroom in the house. I really need to pee.

I don’t know how much longer I can hold it.

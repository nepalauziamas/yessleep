**UPDATE**

[In 2017](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/ugtih0/theres_an_old_bell_tower_near_my_house_its/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) Me and a couple of friends went to an old bell tower looking for an adventure, I could never have even imagined what horror lay in wait for us.

We barely made it out alive, and one of our dearest friends went missing.

[5 years later](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/v10257/theres_an_old_bell_tower_near_my_house_its/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) we returned to look for him, there had been recent sightings near the tower.
We assembled a small crew and against our best judgement, we went back.

What happened there has scarred me physically and mentally for life.

We managed to escape again, only just! But then people started going missing around town, everybody is keeping it all hushed up, nobody talks about what's going on, and now it seems to be spreading like wildfire.

I really hoped this was all over, in the week after we got out  there was a night they didn't show up outside my window and I felt the biggest weight off my shoulders.... but now things seem to be getting worse.

My Dad, who works in a distillery, has a shift rotation every four weeks, day shift, 7am to 3pm, twilight shift, 2.30 PM to 10.30pm and night shift, 10pm to 7.30am.

After Ash, Dennis and Shawn started showing up at my window, I had to tell him about it, his twilight shift started the next day, on Monday.

I begged him to believe me but he assumed I was just talking about 'suspicious people' hanging around after dark and that's what he told the police, I can't say I blame him for not believing me but it still annoyed me.

My Dad's work is a little over an hour away so he sometimes gets home on a good night at 11.30, sometimes it can be midnight before he gets in, I told him they always show up at midnight, when the bells ring. 

He just nodded along only half listening, I'm fucking 19 not 9, I'm not lying, but he just thought I was trying to play some kind of joke.

That night, I heard the bells and I ran to get him, he was still awake, getting his sleeping pattern in check for the awkward shift times.

We went to the window and sure enough, I could have almost predicted what would happen.

They never showed up, the bells were clanging away, loud as hell, but they were nowhere to be seen.

'You can at least hear the bells!?' I asked, feeling annoyed that I now look insane. 

'Yeah' he pointed his hear to the window 'oh yeah I hear them, that's weird' he said and side glance at me before turning away.

I knew he couldn't hear them.

'Dad, you can't hear that?? It's loud as fuck!' I pressed him, feeling deflated.

'Danny, get to bed Son, I'll see you in the morning'.

He left my room, closing the door behind him.

I tried phoning Brian again, for probably the 800th time with no answer, however, on Monday before my Dad left for work I was finally able to get a hold of him.

'Brian where the hell have you been?'.

'Ive been in my bedroom with the blinds closed, I haven't left for over a week, I didn't hear the bells last night, did you? He asked, his voice sounded weak, he sounded like his whole body was deteriorating.

'I heard them, but they never came to the window, I tried to get my Dad to look but they didn't show up, he couldn't hear the bells either, I think I'm about one step away from being bundled into a white van and spending the next couple of years in a straitjacket'.

Brian laughed, 'I need to get out of here Danny, this is no way to live, if I have to look at another pot noodle I think I'm gonnae have a mental breakdown, I've been shitting through the eye of a needle man'.

I couldn't help but laugh, although the situation was far from funny.

'Brian, come here tonight, we can get something to eat and you won't be by yourself, my Dad starts the twilight shift tonight, so it would be good to have you here'.

'That sounds good, I'll get ready and I'll be over about five'.

'No worries mate, I'll see you soon'.

The sound of my Dad getting ready to leave for work caught my attention so I went downstairs to see him.

'Dad, I know you don't believe me, but just try and get home as early as you can tonight'.

'I always try and get home early, Danny!' He said with a smirk on his face.

'But, you know what I mean, even earlier, just do it'.

'Right okay, whatever, I'll be home as soon as I can'.

He turned to grab his work bag and keys, kissed my Mum and patted my back on the way out.

When the door closed... I don't know what it was, but a horrible feeling took over me.

'Please don't let this be the last time I see him', I thought to myself.

I went back to my room, really just waiting around for Brian now.

My Mum kept coming in to check on me, they obviously think I've lost my mind.

After 5 o'clock came and went I started to get a bit restless, worrying, I knew he would probably just be running late, but a part of me had doubts and I didn't like it, it gave me a bad feeling.

Around 5.40pm Brian showed up at last, I was trying my best to contact him constantly but I never got an answer until was standing on my doorstep.

'Brian! Late as ever' I jested, 'come on in', I led him into the back lounge, which is kind of like a dining room but not really.

My Mum was in the adjoining kitchen making dinner, but we didn't want dinner, we wanted a feast, so we sat down and ordered loads of takeaway food. 

Brian seemed reluctant to talk, he was giving mostly yes or no answers or keeping answers to a 2 or 3 word maximum.

It was close to 10.30pm before Brian started to engage in a proper conversation.

He was asking about my Dad, 'Did you say he finished at half 10?'.

'Yeah, I've told him to try and get away fast and get home early, he still thinks I'm a loony though'.

Brian laughed, 'well, hopefully he gets home sharpish'. 

My Mum popped her head into my room, 'I'm going to bed boys, goodnight, goodnight Brian' she said.

'Night!' We both responded at the same time.

There was a few moments of silence, then Brian piped up again, 'what do you think it is?, in the bell tower I mean'.

'I haven't got the slightest idea, some unbelievably belligerent and malicious thing that takes people, I wouldn't even know what to call it' I said, I genuinely had no clue.

'People always said witches haunted that area, maybe it's them, or maybe they summoned something or some things that go out of control... I don't know, I'm just wondering' Brian bowed his head.

We played a couple of games of Fifa before I got bored because Brian always annihilated me, felt like we were waiting forever before I noticed the clock was finally nearing 11.30.

I waited anxiously by the window looking for my Dad's car.

11.30 came and went, nothing.

11.40, still nothing.

As the clock approached 11.50 I started to panic, only a matter of time before the bells chime and they show up outside, I was pacing back and forth.

'Hurry up Dad!' I spoke to myself as Brian sat nervously watching me.

A flash of headlights outside caught me off guard, I shot over to the window.

It was the police, driving up and down the street.

I looked at the clock again.

11.55pm.

My heart sank.

Then a loud clicking of the dead bolt being unlatched and the front door opening startled me.

I ran to the top of the stairs and looked down, my Dad was stumbling through the doorway looking disheveled, 'Dad! You're finally home!' I smiled.

He ambled into the hallway and glanced at me before shaking his head.

He looked tired and fed up.

'I'm going to bed' he mumbled, I could barely make out what he said.

He climbed the stairs and pretty much pushed past me as he made his way to his bedroom, shutting the door behind him.

I went back to my room where Brian was eagerly awaiting my return.

Headlights caught my attention from the window again.

I saw the police car driving back and forward for another few minutes.

We both eyed the clock as the second hand seemed to be in no rush to tick it's way to midnight.

That last 30 seconds felt like 30 minutes.

3... 2... 1...

......

We both held our breath.

....

I looked at Brian.

**Tick, tick, tick**

The sound of the clock was all we could hear.

I looked back up.

12.01am.

The bells didn't ring.

I darted to the window and looked outside.

The police car was parked about 2 houses over, there was absolutely nothing else to see.

I smiled and turned to Brian.

'There's nothing there!' I said, I exhaled and my mind felt pure relief. 

Brian didn't want to believe anything too soon, but I could see the tension in his body begin to wane.

I looked out again.

The police car was gone.

Maybe it worked then, maybe nothing happened because other people would find out or other people would see!? 

I don't know, I don't care, I would finally be able to sleep worry free, even if just for one night.

Brian began to ease up some more, 'maybe it's over' he said, seeming unsure of his words.

'Maybe' I responded, gazing out the window.

'Game of fifa?'. Brian's mood seemed to shift in an instant.

'Honestly man, I just want to sleep' I replied.

Brian laughed, 'shitebag!'.

I smiled and looked out the window one last time.

It was 10 past midnight and still nothing.

I could not have been happier in that moment.

I set Brian up on the floor with some blankets and cushions, then switched the light off.

Just before I got in bed, 'Danny!', Brian whispered.

'What's up?'.

'Sorry man but, would it be alright if we left the light on?'.

I felt so bad for him.

'Or just any light, I can't handle total darkness, I'm sorry man', he sounded upset.

'Dont be sorry mate it's fine, I'll put the TV on, and I'll put my computer on'. I said as I plugged my TV into the wall.

'Thanks' 

'No problem', I turned my PC, fired up the monitor, then got into bed.

I put a random channel on, they were showing 'A Nightmare on Elm Street'.

I saw Brian turn away from the TV.

I switched it over to Comedy Central, 2 episodes of The Ricky Gervais show then 2 South Park were on the guide, perfect!.

I lay back and tried to turn my brain off, my mind was still racing, it always was, I had trouble sleeping ever since the first day in the bell tower.

It was barely past 1am when the hall light went on, the slit of light at the bottom of my door caught my attention.

'Dad must be going for a piss', I thought to myself.

My vision was a little blurry because I was about 5 seconds away from dozing off, but I could make out the shadows of feet walking down the hall towards the toilet.

I closed my eyes.

Footsteps coming back along the hall seemed to wake me, or... was I even asleep there?.

Back again towards the toilet. 

I heard mumbling, quiet and incoherent mumbling.

Back past my room again.

And again.

Then, the stopped.

They stopped right at my door.

I looked at Brian to see if he noticed what was happening.

All I could see were his wide eyes staring at the two shadows at the bottom of my door, he had pulled the blanket up, almost completely covering his face.

After a couple of very long minutes, the shadows walked away again, in the direction of the stairs.

I didn't know what to think, should I be worried? 

'Danny, what's going on?' Brian's muffled voice came from beneath his blanket.

'I don't know, I think my Dad's sleepwalking or something'.

'Go and look!', Brian jerked his thumb in the direction of the door.

'Fuck off, I'm not looking!' I snapped back.

'So you're just gonna let a random person walk around your house?'.

'It's obviously not a random person, they came from the end of the hall, that's my Mum and Dad's room. There's nothing else up there'.

'Hmm, right okay' Brian didn't believe me for some reason.

It was my Dad, I just didn't understand what he was doing or why?

After about half an hour we heard rummaging downstairs, things being moved, lots of walking around and my Dad's voice talking.

I looked at Brian again, he had fallen asleep.

I just tried my best to ignore whatever he was doing and get to sleep myself, not that it was easy, I did eventually fall asleep.

When I woke up in the morning Brian was standing at my window looking puzzled.

I rubbed my eyes as they adjusted to the brightness, 'What you doing?'.

Brian never looked at me, he just said, 'come here!', his voice sounded weak.

I climbed out of bed and made my way to the window which looked out into my front garden and driveway.

My Dad, looking like he had been up all night, almost looked like he was homeless, was pacing around the garden, mumbling to himself, talking fast and making wild gestures that seemed to be involuntary and twitching.

He just looked a mess.

Another thing I noticed was his car windscreen was completely shattered.

I opened the window, Brian grabbed my hand.

'Remember what Liam was last seen doing before he disappeared?' He asked, keeping his voice down.

'Yeah but, this isn't the same.... surely... I mean, this is my Dad, this isn't the same thing!' I was doubting my own words as I stumbled over them.

'Dad!' I called out the window.

He stopped immediately and looked up.

'What you doing? I thought I was the loony!?' I said with a slight nervous smile.

He smiled back for a second.

Then without hesitation he bolted to the car and started it up, reversed out the drive like a maniac, almost hitting another 2 cars then floored it down the street.

We didn't know what to do, or say, we just ran down the stairs and into the street only to see his car turn left towards the town centre.

'What the.... we need to phone someone, the police or something' Brian said.

'Yeah..... yeah, get inside, we need to do something quickly', I led Brian back into the house.

My Mum met us inside, looking like she had just woke up, she had no idea what had just happened.

'Dad was acting weird and he just sped away in his car with his window was all smashed, did he say anything to you?'.

She looked worried, 'uhm-eh, no!? I don't even remember him coming home last night, what was he doing?'.

'Walking around talking to himself then he jumped in his car a drive away, I don't even know how he can see out his windscreen'.

She picked up the phone and dialled 999 at once.

A swift 3 hours later, two officers are sitting in my lounge asking my Mum a series of questions while Brian and I were standing listening at the doorway, they seemed to be taking nothing too seriously.

This all felt like a big stupid waste of time... until,

I can't be 100%, maybe I am finally losing it... but... the officer taking notes and more or less nodding along to the entire conversation...

I could swear he looked at me and smiled, for a split second.

A large crooked smile that seemed to disappear almost instantly, but his glowing yellow eyes burned right into mine for what felt like an eternity.

It lasted less than a second, but that look is permanently imprinted in my mind and I can't shake it off.

My blood ran ice cold, as I watched them both get up and move slowly towards my Mum as she took a sip of her coffee.

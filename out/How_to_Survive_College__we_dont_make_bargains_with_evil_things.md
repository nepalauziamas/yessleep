I keep thinking that I need to let all this go.  What was I doing, [going into the steam tunnels](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/tidhjq/how_to_survive_college_the_steam_tunnels/)?  Why would I take such a risk?  Just because it *seems* okay doesn’t mean it’s going to be okay.  That’s the same sort of logic that leads people to doing dumb stuff like, I dunno, *following the lights*.  They seem okay, right?  Just someone’s lantern.  And then you’re getting your arms torn off by God knows what.  Maybe I was too sheltered at the campgrounds and I’ve started to feel a little invincible because nothing bad happened to me.  Maybe my classmates are right and I really am the most likely to die from something unnatural.

Part of me wants to just focus on my classes.  I’m doing okay in them but midterms are steadily creeping up and I have an academic scholarship to hang onto.  From the chatter in the student discord it seems like the majority of students do exactly that and have nothing weird happen to them.  I could be the same.  I could just go about my day and not notice these things and everything will be fine.

Until it isn’t.

Because these things are still out there and our ignorance only makes us easy prey.

I keep bludgeoning myself with this thought, every time I think about the steam tunnels and how scared I was and how easy it would be to just… not do anything.  And I keep reminding myself about sweater girl.

I have a pep talk I give myself when Cassie is at class and I’ve got the room to myself.  I face myself in the mirror and I say, Ashley, you should have known better.  Now someone is missing and it’s *your* fault and if you don’t fix it no one will ever love or respect you ever again.

See?  Just normal healthy coping mechanisms there.

Perhaps unsurprisingly, I’ve been obsessing over it to the point it’s affecting my concentration in class.  I’m not great at taking notes to begin with, but I at least make the attempt in the hopes I’m not going to have to frantically go through every page of the textbook just prior to midterms.  Ever since the steam tunnels I’ve been staring blankly at the empty notebook and thinking about what a shitty person I am.

It’s like there’s this war inside me.  My fear is battling my guilt and whatever scraps of courage I have left are suffocated under the conflict.  I feel paralyzed.

So, in desperation, I went for a walk.  It was close to midnight.  Cassie and I had just finished a late night snack at the mini cafeteria thing that opens in our dorm at 10pm.  It’s just greasy pizza, fries, and other such foods.

Oh, and chicken tenders.  Our dorm’s mini cafeteria is the only other place they can be found on campus.  #blessed

Cassie was going to go back to the room, but I told her I needed some fresh air.  The weather forecast said it wouldn’t rain for a few more days, so I felt I’d be in the clear.  It’s campus, too, so I wouldn’t be out by myself.  There’s always people around, even close to midnight.

I walked for a while.  It wasn’t doing much to help quiet my thoughts.  If anything, they kept circling each other.  I felt… lost… and I’m not sure it’s entirely because of what happened with sweater girl.

I felt very far from home and desperately alone.

I wound up in front of the campus chapel.  It’s been repurposed to be a general spiritual center - and also where the creative writing department has student poetry readings on Thursdays - but the original building stands.  It is distinctly a chapel.  It’s a rather small building.  A single room with five rows of pews and a stand with a podium.  The walls are white wood, bare of decoration.

Yes, I’ve been inside.  My weird ‘great ideas’ class made us go to a poetry reading for an assignment.

I sighed and collapsed on the ground, leaning against the doors of the chapel.

“What do I do?” I whispered to the night.  “What am I doing out here?”

“I know you didn’t ask my opinion,” a voice beside me said, “but I think you were searching for me.”

There was a man sitting on the ground next to me.  He was simply… there.  I fell over from shock, scrabbling at the pavement with my feet in an effort to throw myself away from him.  He laughed, clear and full of good humor, and the sound of his laughter calmed my pounding heart for a moment.

Not all inhuman things are predators.  Not all of them are evil.  I remained where I was and studied him intently.  He didn’t seem to mind my scrutiny and merely stared out across the green before us, which was now ominously empty of students.

He was a middle aged man with a narrow frame and slick black hair.  He wore trousers, a plaid button-up shirt, and suspenders.  I think his clothing says more about me and my perception of what’s unnatural than anything else.

“Rain is coming,” he commented, glancing up at the sky.

I looked at my phone.  The weather app still said there was a 0% chance, but I felt it was wiser to trust the inhuman thing about the clearly unnatural rainstorms around here.

“We could go inside,” I offered.

He glanced at me, smiling slyly.

“Don’t you know?” he said softly.  “The devil can’t enter consecrated grounds.”

Not all inhuman things are evil.  Most of them are, though.

I bolted to my feet.  He couldn’t be *the* devil.  That just wasn’t something that happened.  Rather, he might be the devil of folklore.  More of a recurring *theme* than an actual person.  Thing.  Entity.  I don’t know.  Still the devil, but also *not*.

It’s complicated.

“Or maybe you’re one of the tricksters,” I countered desperately.  “Those have gotten cast in the devil role plenty of times.”

He just continued to grin at me.

“Fine,” I snapped, when I realized he wasn’t going to clarify what he was.  “What do you want with me?”

“What do I *ever* want with people?”

“Deals?  Bargains?  My soul?”

His expression didn’t change.

“...*trouble*?” I ventured.

“There you go!” he smirked.  “You figured it out.  I’m here to cause trouble.”

“I don’t need to be a part of it.  We don’t make bargains with evil things.”

My hometown’s mantra.  We know the inhuman is out there, we know how to protect ourselves, we know how to fight it, but we never ever make deals with evil things.  It never turns out well.  I turned around and started to walk away.  Rain was coming, after all, and I wanted to get back to my dorm before it hit.

“What if it’s a gift?” he called after me.  “You want to know if she’s alive, don’t you?”

I froze.  Sweater girl.  He knew what I was after.  He knew what the conflict in my heart was, what my mind whispered to me in the middle of the night.  That perhaps she was already dead and I could just forget she ever existed.  I could bury my guilt and keep going with my life without putting myself in unnecessary danger again.

“You said you had a gift,” I said slowly.  “What, is it like a candle that’ll burn as long as she’s alive?”

He’d stood up while my back was turned.  He was very tall.

“Sure, I can do candles,” he said.

“That wasn’t a request!” I said frantically, but it was too late.

From behind his back he produced a stubby purple candle.  The same color as the sweater that she’d loaned me.  It burned like a star, outshining the moon that was quickly vanishing behind incoming clouds.

“That’s going to set off the smoke detector,” I said.

He gave me a severe frown.

“Do I look ignorant?” he snapped.  “It’ll neither produce smoke, nor heat, nor catch other things alight.  It’ll be safe in your dorm room.  You can hide it in your sock drawer for all I care.  It’s not going to go out unless you douse it with water.”

The devil held it out for me.  A gift.  I stared at it suspiciously.

“What’s the catch?” I demanded.

“I’ll tell you after you take it.”  His eyes glinted.  “C’mon.  It’ll be *fun.*”

There was an undercurrent of savagery beneath the last word.  Fun for him, perhaps.  Certainly not fun for me.

“I don’t need it,” I said, turning my back to him.  “She’s alive, that’s all I need to know.  Besides, we don’t make bargains with evil things.”

“Oh, clever you, I’ve been outwitted.”

I paused, dread seizing my chest at the sarcasm in his voice.

“I’ll just leave this here, then, since I guess I don’t need it anymore,” he continued.  I glanced back to watch as he set it down on the steps of the chapel.  “And I guess I can tell you what the catch was.”

He paused, glancing over to where I was covertly watching.  His lips curled into a broad smile.

“It’s not just an indicator of whether she lives or not.  It *is* her life… and if it goes out, so does she.”

It felt like my heart skipped a beat.  He glanced at the sky as I stood there, rooted in place by dawning horror.

“And here comes the rain!” he cheerily exclaimed.  “They’re after the candle, you know.”

Then he vanished.

I might have screamed a curse word really loudly as I dove for the candle.  The chapel, I thought desperately.  I’d ride out the storm there.  I jerked on the door, cradling the candle with my other hand, and found that the doors were locked tight.

Of *course* they were.  Only a handful of the buildings on campus were open this late and it was mostly the computer and science labs.  Fortunately, I wasn’t far from one of those.  I ran for it, clutching the candle tight against me to shield it from the errant raindrops that were starting to fall.

It was like the rain was snapping at my heels.  I burst through the building’s doors and a sheet of water slammed into the glass behind me.  It rattled the doors in their frames and I stumbled away from them, heart pounding as the rain enveloped the building.  It sounded like pebbles hitting the roof and the windows in all the nearby classrooms crackled with the impact of the raindrops.

Like it was trying to find a way in, I thought wildly.

I tried to remember what building this was.  There was a sign nearby listing staff offices and I read up and down the names until I located the department.  Computer science.  This was the computer science building.  There were computer labs in the basement.  One of Cassie’s friends had said this once, when she was hanging out at our dorm room.  I hunted down the dimly lit hallway, searching for the stairs.  There were bright lights at the bottom, so I figured I was going in the right direction.

The sound of the rain dwindled as I descended and I was able to breathe a little easier.  Now I only needed to find the computer lab and I could pretend I belonged there and wait out the rain in the company of other night owls.  I’d hide the candle under my jacket or something.  It felt like my nerves were on fire holding it.  Her life.  I held her life in my hands.  I didn’t feel ready to manage my *own* life, much less be responsible for someone else’s in the most literal of ways.

While the entire basement floor was brightly lit with fluorescent lights, it wasn’t obvious where the computer lab was.  I wandered back and forth, straining to hear the sound of voices or even the electric hum of a bunch of computer towers.  Nothing.  Then, at a corner piece of the hallway, I found myself standing beside a door that emanated heat.  A keychain hung onto a hook next to it, tantalizingly dangling with two identical keys.

The steam tunnels.

“Yeah right,” I muttered under my breath, and kept walking.

I turned the corner and ahead of me, far down at the other end of the hallway, was a stairwell.

And coming down the stairwell was water.  A thin trickle of water, like a rope.  It splashed off the last step and began to spread across the floor, inching its way towards where I stood.  The fluorescent lights reflected brightly off the water’s surface.

They’re after the candle, the devil had said.  The candle that could only be extinguished with water.

He also said it’d be safe in my dorm room.

I cursed him under my breath and grabbed the keys.  I removed one from the keychain, unlocked the door to the steam tunnels, and pocketed it.  If I was doing this, I might as well have my own copy to keep.  I peeked inside to check that the tunnel was clear of steam.

This was stupid, I thought.  I shouldn’t be considering going back into the tunnels after last time.  I glanced back down the hallway.  It was just a leak, I told myself, staring at the approaching water.  Just a leak that was trickling down the exact center of the stairs and traveling down the hallway in a puddle that was only a foot wide, ignoring a drain set in the middle of the floor, like it was seeking me out specifically.

“Not today, Satan,” I sighed, and ducked into the steam tunnels.

I walked briskly along.  I didn’t run, as I wanted to stay aware of my surroundings in case the steam cloud found me.  I reached an intersection and considered for a moment, studying the sign.  I didn’t recognize the street name I was under and my phone had no reception to help me.  I’d follow the left hand rule, I decided.  Take every left turn until I found my dorm hall.  The rain was moving slowly enough that I’d hopefully be able to stay ahead of it, even if I had to double back.  I just had to walk fast.

So I turned left.  And when I reached a door that wasn’t the one I wanted, I turned around and took the next left.  I continued on like this for a while, heart pounding as I turned every corner, expecting to see a cloud of steam or a thin trail of rain water, seeking me out.

Instead, I turned a corner, and there was a large figure mere yards ahead of me in the narrow corridor.

I shrieked.

“Woah!” a familiar voice yelped, before I could turn and run.  “It’s okay!”

I looked closer at the figure.  It was a person, I realized.  Just another student.

“Chicken… Tenders?” I ventured.

Okay I do know his real name and I used that instead but between me and all of you we’ll call him Chicken Tenders.

“What are you doing down here?” I demanded.

“Uh, taking a route back to my dorm that doesn’t involve going out in the rain,” he replied sheepishly.  “I’ve been a bit reluctant to go out in it after, you know.”

“After *what?*” I demanded, which was kind of petty but I’m still salty that he denied anything happened to us.

“Uh.  That thing.  You know.  Um.  But what are you doing down here?”

“Same reason as you.”

We stared uncomfortably at each other for a moment.

“Are you… going the same direction as me?” I ventured.

“I think so?”

He started walking again.  I followed along behind him.  He nervously asked how classes were going for me, I said they were fine.  He said the steam tunnels were really shortcuts and that’s why he started using them.  I let him have his lie.  As if he hadn’t just told me he was down here because he was scared of the rain.

(the steam tunnels are not shortcuts, for the record)

Then we reached a point where the tunnel branched and when he turned right, I turned right.  He paused.

“Isn’t your dorm in the other direction?” he asked.

“I, uh, don’t know where I’m going,” I admitted.  “I’m lost.”

He dug in his back pocket and produced a map.  It was worn and stained.  I didn’t ask where he’d found it, I just pulled out my phone and snapped a photo of it.  He started to show me the route I needed to take and I had a sudden, wild thought.  Nothing was happening to us down here.  Humanity has always built communities to protect themselves from the inhuman.  There are, of course, things that can infiltrate or even overwhelm a community, but generally people do better when they’re not alone.

“C-can you walk me to my dorm?” I asked.  “I’m… a little creeped out down here.”

He hesitated.

“Yeah, sure,” he finally said.  “It’s not a problem.”

Maybe he’s not so bad after all.  I can maybe even forgive him for throwing me under the bus on the student discord.  After my encounter with campus security and with broom lady, I can understand why he wouldn’t want to draw attention to himself.

I still think he’s got poor survival instincts, but I guess at this point I’m hardly one to criticize.

Nothing happened to us on the walk back.  He followed me up to the lobby, even, just to make sure I felt safe getting back to my dorm.  Which was sweet, I suppose.  I really was scared being down here and having someone else with me helped.

“That’s funny,” he said as we emerged from the basement stairs.  “I think the rain has stopped.”

Of course it had.  It couldn’t reach the candle anymore.

I let out a long sigh of relief, thanked Chicken Tenders for his help, and went upstairs to my room.

The candle is hidden in the back of my closet.  I put a cardboard box over top of it to hide its light from Cassie.  The devil lied to me, as the devil is able to do.  This isn’t a gift.  It’s a curse.

I feel like everything is slipping through my fingers.  Just when I thought I was getting used to being in college, everything changed again.  I’m doing okay with my classes.  I’m in clubs.  I’m even making a friend (I think) because Grayson is still chatting with me and we’ve been stopping to talk if we see each other around campus.  But now the devil has appeared and thrown everything into turmoil again and I feel like I’m falling apart all over again.

Also Chicken Tenders sent me a message asking if I’d like to go on a date with him and I think I am losing my mind [because I said yes](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/u0824d/how_to_survive_college_there_is_so_much_wrong/). [\[x\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/goatvalleycampgrounds/)

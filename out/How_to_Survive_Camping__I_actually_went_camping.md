I run a private campground.  Since my last couple posts have been [dedicated to the dumb things](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/mcp6xd/how_to_survive_camping_more_idiocy_from_the_locals/) my campers and the locals do, I suppose it’s only fair if I contribute some of my own stupidity.  Though I feel calling it stupidity is a bit of a stretch.  Recklessness?  Personally I think of it as doing my job, but maybe some of you will feel otherwise.

If you’re new here, you should [start at the beginning](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/clp5h4/how_to_survive_camping/) and if you’re totally lost, [this might help](https://www.reddit.com/r/goatvalleycampgrounds/comments/fz6a1d/how_to_survive_camping_index/).

I’ve been trying to figure out what to do for the thing in the dark.  Maybe I’m being willfully naive, but I can’t help but wonder if I restored it, if it’d stop swallowing up people who look at it.  Perhaps it’s possible for the thing in the dark to live peacefully alongside the campers.  Wouldn’t that be nice?  Make the campground safer by helping one of these inhuman things instead of killing it.

What happened with the lady with extra eyes still weighs heavy on me.

I went to my brother’s house to talk with him about the problem.  He’s spent more time going over Mattias’s journal and trying to piece it together with the family notes.  I’ve been relying on him for the more intellectual business of the campground.  It’s a big relief, I’ve felt quite overwhelmed lately trying to figure out how to make up for the financial losses of last year while also prepping for the camping season.  I’m not sure what I’d do if I had to do research on top of that.  Give up sleeping, I guess.

My frequent visits have had the happy side-effect of improving my relationship with his wife.  She still doesn’t want her daughter to be involved in the campground and I’ve sworn that when she’s older, I won’t talk about it.  And if the subject comes up I’ll make it sound like a bunch of boring paperwork and picking up discarded beer bottles.  That’ll be easy.  It really is a lot of boring paperwork and picking up discarded beer bottles.  You all just get to hear about the interesting stuff.

I think her daughter is doomed already, but she doesn’t need to know that.  The campground will call to her like it called to me.  She’ll love the land because it will feel more like home to her than anywhere else.  Her time with the fairies may help her interact with human society, but it’ll never erase her connection to the unnatural.  If anything, it’ll probably make it stronger.

Problems for future Kate, I guess.  Tyler’s wife will have to learn that she can’t control her daughter just as we can’t control the forest.  It has a mind of its own.

In the meantime, the changeling is working out… great.

Tyler and his wife have no idea.  The changeling is quite good at what she’s here to do.  I am likely the only person in town that has any idea that the child is not human and that’s where the problem lies.

The changeling knows I know.  And she seems to take glee in doing things to annoy me, knowing that I can’t call her out on her behavior.  I have been spit up on *so many times*.

This changeling is going to be a nightmare for the next five years.

My brother, unfortunately, didn’t have a lot of information on the thing in the dark.  Mattias had some encounters with it, but he didn’t make the bargain to help it become whole until near the end of his journal.  The coherency deteriorates steadily throughout and by the end, it’s reduced to fragments and hastily scribbled notes that only Mattias could understand.  Perhaps the journal started with the intention of being readable by successive generations, but it certainly didn’t end that way.

Tyler did notice that as the coherency degraded, Mattias’s confidence increased.  His idle questions decreased and vanished entirely in the last third.  No more did he spend pages musing on the nature of heaven and earth and hell and how all that related to old land, but now his sentences were terse and direct.  I must go here.  I must do this.

I’ve had brief insights like this before.  I can feel some changes to the land - such as the approach of a bad year.  I’ve just never tried to use this to my advantage.  It is an ephemeral knowledge, coming when I need it and no more.

Tyler’s theory is that I can hone this sense.  He doesn’t have it, but he has also spent many years away from the campground and was never keen on it like I was while growing up.  Between that and Mattias’s journal, he thinks that the key is exposure.  The more someone is around the unnatural world, the more in tune with it someone grows.

Our evidence is pretty flimsy, I admit.  Two personal anecdotes and a journal that’s over a hundred years old.  I’m used to working off guesses and hunches, though.

I planned to start simple.  There was no urgency to this, after all.  The thing in the dark has been waiting a long time to be made whole already, a little longer won’t do any harm.  (I hope)  There’s been enough excitement over the past few months that I wanted a bit of a break as well.  I wasn’t feeling up to a tea party with Beau or keg stands with the dancers or storming the hall of the gummy bears.

I’d go camping.

Nice and simple.  A night out in the woods.  Or by the edge of the forest, rather.  I didn’t particularly feel like camping *in* the deep woods.  That’d be asking for trouble.  I don’t even put campers in the deep woods until the camp is at capacity and the sheer amount of humans blundering around tends to send most inhuman things back to their lairs.

I drove my truck out to a nice spot, set up a tent, and settled in for a quiet evening enjoying the great outdoors. I made a campfire, heated up water for hot chocolate, and was toasting marshmallows when Beau arrived.

He sat down without invitation on the ground opposite me.  I’d only brought one camp chair and I felt a little bad about that, but he didn’t seem to mind.

“I haven’t seen you around for a bit,” I said.

“I show up when you need me.”

“Do I need you right now?  Is there something I should know?”

“No.  You’re already aware of the risks.”

Camping is not without its dangers.  I was outside the protection of my house.  I sighed.  After a moment, I offered him a marshmallow that had just finished toasting up nicely.  It was the least I could do, since I didn’t have any hot chocolate to give him.  He dropped it in his skull cup.

I’m so sorry to whatever camper has to drink from it next.  My bad.  I’m not sure what’s in there, but it cannot possibly taste good paired with a marshmallow.

“Well, if I’m in no more danger than normal,” I said, “I’m still curious as to why you’re here.”

“Why *I’m* here?” he asked sharply.  “*You’re* the one taking up residence in the forest for the night.”

*That* got my attention.  I seized on it with a sudden hope and an even greater fear.  Was this some sort of etiquette violation?  Was this the reason these creatures preyed on my campers - because they entered the forest?

“Should I have asked permission first?” I asked nervously.

“Of me?  Of course not.”

“But should I have asked permission?”

He considered for a moment.  I offered him another marshmallow as a bribe and he added this to his cup as well.  His piercings glinted with light from the fire as he stared into the cup’s surface, watching the marshmallows drift in the liquid.

“I don’t think it would change anything,” he finally said.  “Permission is not necessary.  It is enough to know you’re an interloper here.”

So first off, I’m kind of glad that I don’t have to add “Rule #1: ask the forest for permission before you set up your tents” to my list, because the pamphlets are already printed for the year and that’s not a small expense.  But secondly, *yikes*.  Nervously, I tried to change the topic, because after Beau’s comments I could feel the weight of the forest at my back.  Like it was pressing down on me, the shadows picking at the edges of the campfire, the branches stretching out fingers towards the back of my neck.

“Is keeping an eye on me the only reason you’re here?” I asked.  “You’re here to protect your ticket to ascension?”

I’d hoped to get him talking about that long night in my house, listening to the battle raging outside.  About how he couldn’t ascend yet and what it would take to make that happen.  But he gave me such a look of disgust that I was momentarily taken aback.  There was scorn in his narrowed eyes.  He quickly looked away, abruptly standing to leave, leaving me to wonder what the hell that was all about.  Did he not like that I called it out so blatantly?  These inhuman things tend to not just *say* things out-loud, after all.

Or maybe all the shipping has finally altered his nature and made him care about me and he’s being angsty over having to someday kill me.

“It’s okay to admit you like me!” I called after him.  “We should hang out more!”

So I guess our relationship has been upgraded to trolling.  It’s an improvement.

Beau’s words had left me unsettled, though.  Interloper.  I’ve always known it in my heart, but there’s a familiarity with this land that makes me feel like I belong here.  And that it belongs to me.  I didn’t linger for much longer.  As soon as the fire began to die I retreated to my tent and huddled in my sleeping bag, pulling a pile of blankets over me for good measure.

It’s still cold at night.

I’m not sure what time it was when I woke.  There was a snap from somewhere close by and I was instantly awakened.  I lay there, heart pounding, listening intently.  It hadn’t sounded like a branch breaking.  Did a tent pole snap?  The tent was still upright, but I ran my gaze along its seams, searching for a bowing of the fabric.  Was it something else?  Uneasily, I placed my hand on the hilt of the knife that I’d put under my pillow before going to sleep.

Nothing.  Slowly, I sat up.  Perhaps it was a tree branch after all.  Or perhaps Beau was pranking me as retaliation for my last comment.  Maybe he’d taken up trolling as well.

My breath came out in a cloud.  It was cold but I didn’t think it should be *this* cold.  I swore and hastily extricated myself out of the sleeping bag.  The frost.  So much for my bonding experience with the forest.  The frost was coming and I needed to relocate.

I grabbed the zipper of the tent and found it wouldn’t budge.  Now that I was out from under my pile of blankets, my teeth were chattering with the cold.  It’d come up on me *fast.*  Had it always been this quick to form?

I pulled the knife from its sheath.  Unfortunately, I’d taken my own advice and my tent was not cheap.  There was a brief moment of mourning for it and then I slashed an opening into the tent fabric.  RIP tent.  May you feast with your brethren four-wheelers in campground Valhalla.

My knife struck something that held firm as I cut through the tent.  I made another slash, forming a triangle, and then peeled the fabric down.  On the other side was a wall of ice.  It encased the tent.  I slammed the hilt of the knife on it, but it only chipped.  It had to be thick.  My heart hammered in my chest.  How the *hell* had it formed so quickly?  I’d never heard of something like this happening before.

I tried to stay calm.  Surely this wasn’t air-tight.  Surely I wouldn’t run out of oxygen in here… right?

Or maybe I wouldn’t find out, because I’d just freeze to death first.

Frantically, I grabbed my cellphone.  It wouldn’t hurt to get some backup.  I unlocked the phone and found myself staring at an icon notifying me that I had zero bars.  Apparently you can’t get cell service when trapped inside an unnatural prison of ice.  Who knew?

I let the phone slip out of numb fingers.  I was on my own.

There was no one who would come for me.  There was no one left that I could have asked to stand by, just in case.  Turtle left.  Bryan left.  My aunt and uncle were dead.  The old sheriff had given enough already.  And my brother had started a family and had the good sense to stay away from here.

I’ve been alone for a long time.  I can’t say it doesn’t hurt, sometimes, when you realize all your friendships are superficial and all it takes to fall apart is for the other person to find something more interesting.  I’ve learned to live with that.  Come to expect it, even.

It’s not so bad being the only person you can rely on.  It forces you to fight for yourself.

I took the knife in both hands.  I slammed the hilt as hard as I could against the ice.  I don’t think I’m a particularly clever person.  I know a lot of stories.  I’ve seen a lot of shit.  But I didn’t have any great ideas, no plan other than to fight my way out.

So I smashed the knife’s hilt against the ice, again and again, resolutely chipping away at it.  My skin was numb wherever it was exposed to the freezing cold but I couldn’t let myself stop.  There was no way out other than through.  I put all my muscle behind it, all the strength I had from years of fighting both monsters and the land itself.

And then the knife broke.

The hilt - made from my second cousin’s fibula - cracked in two lengthwise.  Bits of bone splintered off.  And as it broke, there was another sharp crack, like a gunshot, and the ice exploded where the last impact of the knife had landed.  It punched through, leaving a hole the size of my fist.

Desperately, I shoved my hand through, feeling for the exterior of the ice wall, trying to discern how thick it was.  There was a tingling sensation in my other hand and I glanced down.  Blood ran down it, dropping onto the frosted tent floor.  My fingers were so numb they hadn’t even felt when the blade of the knife sliced them open as I clutched at the broken hilt.

From outside the tent, someone grabbed my wrist.  I tried to jerk my hand free, but the grip was unrelenting.  On the other side of the ice wall I could only see a hazy outline of a person.

“There you are,” a man said.  “You’re quite persistent.”

“Can you get me out of here?” I asked, my voice shaking from how hard I was trembling.  The cold had settled into my bones.

“I might be able to.  Wait a moment for me.”

He let go.  I snatched my hand back and tucked it close to me, shivering as I crouched inside the tent and waited.  I had *no* idea who this person was, but I wasn’t going to question it if they were going to help me.

Another snap.  The sound echoed in the small chamber, loud enough to make me flinch.  Another.  And then a section of the ice fell away, shattering as it hit the frozen ground beyond.  I didn’t waste any time.  I ducked through, stumbling out and sucking in lungfuls of frosty air.  It burned in my throat.  All around me the grass was covered in a thick layer of ice.  I took small steps, trying not to slip.  I had to get out of here.  I had to be near the epicenter of the frost and it was moving far faster and with far more intensity than I was familiar with.

I glanced about for my rescuer as I hurried away from the tent.  I didn’t see them, though, not until a hand seized the back of my head by my hair.  On instinct, I stabbed backwards with the knife, but my fingers were still numb from the cold and I lacked a proper hilt with which to hold it.  The blade slipped out of my grasp and fell to the ground.

“There’s something you should see before you run back to your home,” the man said firmly.

“Who *are* you?” I asked desperately.

He wasn’t human.  I could tell that much by how strong his grip was.  I struggled briefly and hastily stopped when his grip tightened, my hair pulling painfully against my scalp.  I couldn’t turn my head in any direction except that which he wanted.

He had me look back towards my tent.  In front of it, where the campfire had been, was a pit.  Not very large, perhaps only five feet in diameter.  The sides were sheer, as if someone had taken a cookie cutter to the earth.  My captor and rescuer shoved me forwards, directing me towards it.  Another shove and I dropped to my knees beside it.  The frozen blades of grass stabbed through the thin fabric of my pajamas.

“You see them?” the man hissed.

He shoved my head closer to the yawning pit.

The hole stretched down into the darkness of the earth, until light could reach no further.  What little soil I could see shone with the silver lacing of frost.  It was hard to see much of the sides, for the pit was choked with bodies.

They clung to the sides, half-engulfed by the soil.  Heads and torsos and limbs protruded from the sides, writhing and struggling to pull themselves up out of the earth.  Their flesh was pallid and shone with ice.  Dead eyes stared up at me, frozen solid, and whitened lips parted to reveal tongues black with frostbite.

“Look.  See how many there are?”

I clawed at the hand gripping the back of my head.  His flesh was warm - unusual for inhuman things - but his skin refused to yield as I dug my nails into it, trying to draw blood or elicit any sort of reaction that would cause him to release me.

“I don’t know what you want from me!” I cried desperately.

“You need to make this right,” he said grimly.  “The frost will only continue to grow until you do.”

He hauled, wrenching me to my feet.  My eyes watered at the pain at the back of my head.  Then he turned me around and shoved me forwards, propelling me away from the pit.

“Go!” he commanded.  “Don’t forget what you’ve seen.”

As if I could.  But I didn’t question his benevolence in releasing me, I just ran.  I had to get away from here.  Back to warmth.  Back to safety.  And as I hurried away from the frost, I stopped only to grab my knife, and I took a single glance back.  The man was gone.  Of course.  I’d never gotten a look at him.

All I have to show for my camping trip is a broken knife and a lot more questions.

I’m a campground manager.  I have a list of all the creatures on my land and how dangerous I think they are and how urgently I need to deal with them.  The thing in the dark was at the top of my list not because I think it outranks things like the harvesters, but because I think it was the one I stood the best odds of being able to do something about.  Unfortunately, I think I need to put the frost at the top of that list.  The thing in the dark is important, yes, but the frost is now *urgent*.

I need to make this right, he said.  And I need to do that before the big events, where I put campers down in the deep woods, [where the snow has yet to melt](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/mjkts1/how_to_survive_camping_i_did_the_thing_the_thing/).

Hello. I'm currently trapped with my classmates in high school. I know it may sound ridiculous, but let me just explain.

There we were, in 4th period. It was a school day just like any other, the bell rung, the teacher came in, and we began. I don't remember what we learned, but it doesn't matter. An hour and a half later the bell rung to end the class. As soon as it did, the bell rung again to signal the beginning of class. The teacher, Mr. Johnson came in and shut the door. *What?* was my first thought. He hadn't even left, or so I thought. I checked the time, and sure enough it was the start of 4th period again. I could see vaguely confused faces on the other kids, and even the teacher, who verbally expressed a feeling of Deja Vu to the class. The class period repeated all over again, and afterwards, the bell rung. I know what your probably expecting, and sure enough the class reset again.

By now everybody was getting alarmed. Mr. Johnson stopped teaching and shared confusion with us. We were all getting scared, and spent the entire class period talking amongst ourselves. When the class reset a 4th time, panic began to ensue.

As if everything wasn't terrifying enough, we then discovered that we are not only reseting, but trapped in the classroom. I estimate about 12-14 iterations since then, and so far we have not been successful in getting the door or window to budge. The other kids are starting to get violent, and one kid was injured pretty bad near the end of iteration #7. At the start of iteration #8, they were fine. A full blown riot broke out on iteration #9, and we estimate about 10 people were severely injured. (For comparison, there are 31 of us in here, plus the teacher.)

Nothing appears to have changed, everything resets exactly at the end of 4th period. In case you're wandering how I'm typing this, the school does allow phones, and many kids have theirs, including me. The school Wi-Fi still appears to be usable, though I have to use cell data due to Reddit being blocked. We're about to be reset again, and I'm currently rushing through typing this as my phone will likely be reset at the end of this iteration. I had to type this out as I am truly the most scared I've ever been, and we don't know what to do.  


UPDATE 1: The other students have begun to formulate a possible escape plan. The teacher successfully opens the door and comes into the room 10 seconds after the bell. Is is hypothesized that the door can be opened from the outside, and this is our chance to escape.

UPDATE 2: The door appears to close itself once the teacher gets in, with no stopping it. We think that if we're quick enough, somebody may be able to slip out during the five or so second window in which the door is opened. Oddly enough, the teacher doesn't seem to be aware of the situation while the door is open. He only realizes after the door is shut, meaning we can't ask him to leave it open or stay outside. There's an hour left of this iteration, and going to send somebody out tomorrow. I'll make an update to let you guys know how it goes!

The moon is a beautiful sight, there's no denying that. It serves its purpose and we don't think much of it. However, for me, the moon is something that confuses me.

It's not that I don't understand how it comes up and how we see it, that's all very simple but it's more so what's been happening in my neighborhood for the better part of 2 weeks now. It hasn't been normal and quite frankly has been freaking me the fuck out.

Just so everyone can get to know me for a second; my name is Trevor. I won't be giving out my last name for privacy reasons. I live alone so seeing these events I have been witnessing is much more nerve-wracking than it needs to be. 

Lately, it has all been starting once the sky turns dark, and when the moon comes out. The weird part is, once the moon reaches the sky and lights it up, I'll see people walk out of their homes and just... Stare at it. No expression on their face, nothing in their eyes, just blank as they look up at the moon. There have been times where I've gone out and tried to snap someone out of it but whatever I do, whether I slap them, shake them, anything, they just keep *staring.*

There have even been times when I've had urges to go outside and look at the moon myself.

I've never fulfilled these urges, yet I continuously had them every single night, and sometimes I got up and start to walk to my front door like something was controlling me, but I'm always able to seemingly gain control back last second. It's... Odd.

I've tried looking it up to see if this has been happening anywhere else but the only thing that pops up are scary stories. The only related post about something like this was when I saw someone recounting the same experiences I've had but in the SAME NEIGHBORHOOD. This is happening nowhere else but **here.**

It's scaring me because when it first started weeks ago, it was only a minimal 2-3 people going out and just looking. A creepy sight for sure but not enough to get suspicious. A week ago it was bumped up to 8 people and then eventually 10 a night. Now, this week, every day the number goes up exponentially, and now I see a whopping 80-90 people on average outside, looking at the moon every night. There aren't too many people in my neighborhood so I'm one of the very few that seems to not go outside to take part in it.

I can't go to sleep at night without looking at the moon at least once, there's just something so sinister about it but I can't help but just... Take a quick look. Sometimes not even a quick look, there was a time when I looked at it for 5 minutes straight and didn't even realize. I don't know how I snapped out of it, but I did. If I'm falling into what other people in my neighborhood have been and I can get out of it then they can too, but it looks like they can't, like they're stuck in time and can only get away once the sun is finally up. 

There was a morning when I asked someone what the hell they were doing, and they responded simply; "I don't know, Trevor, I just woke up out here,"

I never understood it before and I've been seriously considering moving out because something is just not right out here. It's just outright creepy. But now I think I understand.

Last night, the same thing happened. The sky turned dark and the moon came up, and people started walking out of their house and just started staring at it, with no expression, no nothing. Just looked at the moon. I watched as multiple people, more than ever before were coming out to do just one thing; stare. 

I looked through all my windows which gives me different looks into different areas of the neighborhood, and whenever I looked out, more and more people were going outside of their homes as the moon lit up the sky more and more. It was looking like the *entire* neighborhood was coming out. They all spread out for each other and they began staring up at the moon. I was watching this all unfold, but I was starting to feel the same urge to go out and look at the moon too. The same urge that I've been getting.

It was like a knot being twisted in my stomach getting it. It felt like someone put a gong in my head and started pounding on it. I started feeling lost, like I didn't belong in my own house. In fact, nothing felt right. I looked outside one last time and finally, the urge got the best of me. I had to go out there.

I slowly walked down the stairs, but I started looking at the walls like I was trying to look *through* the walls to look at the moon. Looking back I didn't feel like myself, I no longer felt like *Trevor.*

I unlocked my front door and walked outside, where I saw many others out in the street, looking at the moon. Before I knew it, I stepped over my garden and moved through my entire front yard, and joined everyone else in the street. For the first time, I was among everyone else, looking up, directly at the moon.

It felt... Awful. It felt like I was looking into something horrifying and unexplainable, even though I was basically looking at nothing. I felt an overwhelming sense of dread in my chest, my heart pounding harder than it ever did before. I started getting thoughts in my head, that this was a mistake, that I should NOT be out here. Looking at the moon felt like an illusion and it felt like it was getting closer by the second, and I couldn't move away or do anything about it. The only thing I could do was still just stare. I was stuck in this loop and it felt like my reality was being crushed. 

I tried to scream but I couldn't, I could only scream in my mind but even they sounded... Audible. Like my mind was making real noises at me. It felt like it was beating me to a bloody pulp, but in fact, it sounded like everyone was screaming around me, even if I didn't sense anyone's mouth opening, because as I stared up at the moon, it looked like it's texture was changing from a grey rock to a black void, as I felt the presence of something else coming directly from the moon pressing down on us. It felt otherworldly. It felt ghastly.

I felt different eyes on my eyes, even though I didn't see anything. At least, I didn't think I saw anything. 

It was at this moment that I could think again. I had full control over my body, but I still couldn't look away from the moon. I couldn't even move away from it, my eyes just stayed GLUED to it. I started to feel woozy and dizzy, my throat started to feel like it was closing up. As I looked up at the moon I tried to move my arm around to feel anybody else with me but I couldn't, I was restricted. I understood now. I understood the moon.

I felt my whole throat close up and that was when I passed out.

When I woke up, it was the morning. The sun was up and it was bright outside. It was a clear sky, with no clouds in sight. I blinked a couple of times and tried to move my arm up. I looked to my side and I saw my arm up in front of me. I could move again.

I closed my eyes and breathed a sigh of relief that the nightmare that was last night was finally over, but I was scared that I had to live through it again later. Because now that I experienced the moon, I knew what other people were getting themselves into, and the whole thing felt supernatural. There was something not right with where I lived.

I sat up and grunted, my entire body felt stiff as I closed my eyes. I put my head down, I was still in disbelief and I wondered how the hell I passed out but I didn't really care. I let the heat of the sun beam down on me, grateful that the moon was gone.

When I finally opened my eyes and looked around me, I saw multiple people on the road I was on, dead.

They had black goo covering their entire body, with red stains that looked like blood running over them. I noticed that multiple people's limbs were also disintegrating from the goo. There were only a few other people on my street that weren't having this happen to them but they were asleep on the street still, unaware.

I looked at the goo that was on people and it looked like it was sizzling, and it almost looked *alive,* but I didn't know what exactly it was, I just stared in disgust and confusion. It came to a point in time where I just had to look away. I didn't know how this happened but I was glad that it wasn't happening to me. 

I got up and started limping away, my legs were still extremely stiff and it didn't feel nice. I started walking on the sidewalk and as I started moving near another part of our street, I saw even more people on the ground, covered in black goo all around me. There were dozens of people like this and I saw so many people now up and seeing the exact same thing I was and I just couldn't put together any logical reason for this, unless...

The moon.

There had to be some correlation, and I stood, thinking as I watched someone get completely disintegrated by the goo, an awful sight to withhold. I had to look away. A little girl started shouting "daddy?" at the goo and it broke my heart to pieces.

A few cop cars started driving around quickly to different parts of the street and I watched as a cop car came to a halt next to me and the cop in it opened his door. He peaked his head beside his lights and spoke to me.

"You okay?"

I looked back at the cop, and I had so many questions. I didn't know if a singular cop would know everything, and I didn't think so either, but it was worth a shot because I've had 2 weeks of curiosity and now I knew what it was like but the morning's event made *little* of sense.

"Hey officer, yeah, I'm fine, but um... What the hell is going on here?" I spoke in a shaken, hurt voice.

The officer looked back at me. "Good," he said. He stopped for a moment as he stared at me, looked up at the sky, then at me. "You've seen everything with the moon these past couple of weeks, huh?"

I nod my head. "Yeah, it's fucking weird, do you-"

"It is weird. Wanna know why?" The officer says to me. He opens a pack of gum and pops a piece into his mouth, starting to chew.

"That's what I was going to ask you, officer. Why is this all happening?"

The officer gives me a weird and worried look, almost like he was hesitating on telling me. He opens his mouth. 

"The moon in this neighborhood is not our moon."

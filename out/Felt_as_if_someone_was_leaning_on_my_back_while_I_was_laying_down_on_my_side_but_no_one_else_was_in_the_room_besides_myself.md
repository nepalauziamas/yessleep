This happened last year when I was working on a shipyard and was staying in their small quarters. The quarters is a single room with an attached bathroom, but it's decently comfortable. It has air conditioning but no fans. Has sliding windows which are always locked. The curtains over the windows are those multiple flaps connected with a string type. Only one door to enter and exit.

Around that time, majority of people among my work group caught Covid and had to go on quarantine. It was only myself and one other dude on duty (I will address him as "the other dude throughout this writing because we had only met back then, so I couldn't really call him my friend) . We alternated day and night shifts. The day of happening, I had completed my day shift and was in the room by 06:00 PM. The other dude had gone for his shift by then and I started preparing food for us. Had dinner by 10:00 and was in my futon by 11:00.

You should know that there's no cot or bed in the room. Just two thin futons which we roll up every morning after getting up. So I'm laying down on the futon on the floor, laying on my left side while facing a wall. A few feets behind me is a sliding window (which is locked) and another few feets away is the door (which I locked before I layed down).

About 30 minutes in, I hear a peculiar sound. It almost sounds like someone is sliding their fingers over the flap-curtains. It's also sounded like they were moving their fingers from the farthest side of the curtain, slowly towards the other end where I'm sleeping. I thought about turning over to the other side to see what's up, but for some reason I felt like I would regret doing so. I just simply felt like turning towards that side was the last thing I wanted to do, and thinking back, I'm glad I didn't turn around.

As soon as I heard the sound, I became completely frozen. I didn't move a muscle in my body and just stayed the same way, laying on my side. Gradually, I felt as if there's a small weight leaning on my back. The weight gradually increased, and within a few seconds, it felt like a grown adult was leaning on my back. By then I'm scared shitless and calling every single Gods that I never believed in until now.

The weight stayed on me for approximately 10 or 15 minutes, or so I think, because it did feel like an eternity in real time but I think it's about 15 minutes. And slowly, it felt like the weight was decreasing, as if whatever that's leaning on my back is slowly getting up. Within a couple of seconds after the weight was completely removed away from me, I hear that sound again. The sound of someone sliding their fingers over the curtains, but this time, it's sounds like it's moving away from me.

The next 30 minutes was silent. Too silent. It was as if life was completely sucked out from that room. I couldn't even hear my own heart beat, which I was hearing loudly a couple of minutes ago, when it was still on my back.

 After 30 minutes of complete silence I gathered enough courage to reach out to my phone and turn on the flash. I looked around and saw nothing. Got up and turned the lights on. Nothing in the room looks off. Checked the door and it's locked. Checked the windows and it's also locked. Looked inside the bathroom and no one is in there. I sat there for a solid minute before I grabbed my phone, wallet and walked out of that room, towards my work site where the other dude is. Told him what happened and he laughed at me.

I stayed in that same room for almost a month since then but never experienced that again. I was afraid it would happen again but my fears were for nothing. It's been almost a year now but I still get chills thinking about that 15 minutes I spent, fearing for my life like I've never done before.

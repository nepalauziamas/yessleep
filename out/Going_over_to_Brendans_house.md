Hi, my name is Lucy, and this is my story.

It all started in 2019 when I met a guy - let's call him Brendan. We met through mutual friends and would party together sometimes, in his hot tub, keep in mind we live in the UK so having a hot tub isn't so common, so all our friends loved him for it, especially on hot summer days. Brendan was a nice, shy, maybe a little awkward guy who I quickly became close with, and we started going on walks and going to the gym together. Cut to 2020, Brendan realises his friends were just using him for his big, fancy house and hot tub, and he cuts them off - now all he has is me and a few other close friends. I started going to his house a lot, and got to know his family a bit better. They seemed nice, if a little weird, but I realised I'd only \*seen\* his dad around, around corners and through windows, watching us in the hot tub, or lurking outside bathrooms when me and other girls would go in to change. 'Maybe he's shy, or just sick of having teenagers around his house, and that's why he's so standoffish...?' either way I reasoned it away and tried not to think about it.

That was, until Brendan starting telling me about the history of his family. Allegations against the father - I'll call him SJ - saying he groped pregnant women, abused his own daughter, and made up lies about his ex wife when she brought it up. Brendan said the ex wife was salty about the divorce and got her daughter to make claims against SJ. I was na√Øve and chose to believe it, but started going over to Brendan's house less and less. 

In the bathrooms and Brendan's bedroom I always had the horrible feeling of being watched, and would catch flashes of red light in the dark. I didn't know what to think but surely he wouldn't be watching an underage girl? Right?

On top of that he'd give me and other underage girls alcohol, stating 'if you're well behaved you can have another'.

Other things came to light, like how he owned a kid's play bus, a double decker converted into a kid's play gym, the catch being he was the driver, even if you rented it for private hire for a party, and there were curtains on the top deck. He would park it up on a park or a field or wherever the kid's party was, and supposedly just wait for the kids to finish playing before driving away. Who knows his plan. Another dark horrible secret - that he had a whole house he was 'redecorating', despite having no decorator skills, he never let Brendon inside to help, or anybody for that matter. I shudder to think what was going on, or what IS STILL going on in that empty house.

Then SJ made a few inappropriate comments about underage me and I decided enough was enough. I called up my coder/hacker/genius best friend with the intention of venting my feelings, but by the end of the phone call we had googled his name, and lo and behold, he was arrested and jailed in the early 2000s for CP. Every piece of the puzzle slotted together and I realised he must've been recording us and god knows what else. I realised the 'rumours' were real and when confronted with this news, Brendan was shocked and upset and confronted SJ. Presumably, his family isolated him from us, because it's been 2 years, and nobody has seen or heard from Brendan. Their house was sold, and his social media's wiped and deleted. His phone number has changed. I say nobody has seen or heard from Brendan, but a few months ago, we got a text from no caller ID saying 'help'. That's it.

We're convinced he's being held in that mystery house, or is deceased, to protect SJ's huge amount of computer equipment, or his huge pile of cash he has hidden somewhere that Brendan told us about.

If you read this, Brendan, please come back to Wakey. We miss you.

Okay, here is an update on [yesterdays post](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/vspb7g/i_may_have_met_the_man_of_my_dreams). 
Turns out the test was positive, I’m really pregnant. I can already feel life inside, and my stomach keeps growing. And I’m nauseous all the time. 

I tried calling Mark this morning, but he’s not answering. Hope he’ll call back soon, but I know he’s busy if he’s working.

I had the weirdest dream last night, it felt so real. I was awake but paralyzed in my bed. I couldn’t move nor speak. There was this being in the room with me, standing in the corner just staring at me with these eerie red glowing eyes. The corner was dark so I couldn’t see anything else. However I could hear its weezing breath, and the room was filled with a rotten stench.
I don’t know how long it lasted, but suddenly the being disappeared and in the next moment Mark was laying on top of me naked, about to penetrate me. Then I woke up.

I’ve heard that pregnant women can have crazy dreams, so it’s probably nothing to worry about.

I need to book a doctors appointment to get an ultrasound. And I have to call my mom. I hope she’s getting thrilled about her grandchild.

I feel like I’m not alone in the house. Like there’s someone watching me. I keep looking over my shoulders all the time. Maybe it’s just my maternal instinct, combined with the dream I had.

Mark called me back, I told him I was pregnant. I worried about how he would take it but he actually got really excited! He said he couldn’t wait to se me - us - again, and that he would love to come to my ultrasound appointment. But he had a lot of work to do so he couldn’t make it this time. He promised to come soon though. Meanwhile he would send me some money so that me and the baby wouldn’t lack anything. He assured me he would do anything to keep his child safe. He will book me a doctors appointment at the best maternity clinic in town, he said, he will be texting me the details once the appointment is booked.
I just can’t believe how lucky I am meeting a man like Mark. 

I started writing a list of all the things I need to buy before the baby arrives. A baby really needs a lot of stuff, I couldn’t afford everything on my own. I still got about eight and a half months before he or she arrives, but to avoid stressing I should start checking things off the list as soon as possible.

Being pregnant really gives me an appetite. I could eat all day. Maybe that’s why my stomach is growing so fast, because of all the food.

I suddenly got the cravings for meat, the baby must be hungry. I’m gonna go and find a steakhouse now.

It’s strange, I just can’t shake the feeling of someone watching over me. It’s giving me the chills…

It was the worst crime scene I’d ever laid eyes on. 

It wasn’t the bodies, the blood or shattered bone, it was the Christmas decorations; streaks of shimmering tinsel and quaint little holiday knickknacks that were splattered with gore. All the hallmarks of a happy, healthy family were rendered a grotesque, dissonant joke. 

The bodies of a woman and three young children were laid out on the kitchen floor, small pebbles placed over their lifeless eyes. The woman had been killed by a single shotgun blast to her torso, the children had been bludgeoned to death. 

There was no sign of the man of the house, and I dreaded having to give him the news. 

Only, we didn’t have to.

Neither did we have to wait long for a suspect. 

The news spread like wildfire around our department, a man had handed himself into Police having made a full and frank confession to the murders. But it wasn’t some crazed killer, some escaped lunatic or gun obsessed loner. The murderer was the woman’s husband, the three murdered children’s father. 

I was tasked with the interview, it was down to me to find out what could possibly drive a man to murder his family in cold blood. 

------------

As I sat down in the interview room, the man across from me seemed totally disconnected, numb to the crimes he’d been so quick to admit to. It took an hour to finally get him to talk. 

He’d murdered his children first, then placed the stones over their eyes so they wouldn’t have to see him kill their mother. He said it was the hardest thing he’d ever done, that it’d taken months for him to work up the courage to finally do the deed. 

When I asked him if he regretted it, he smiled. 

“No, I’d do it all again in a heartbeat”.

But no matter how hard we tried, we couldn’t work out the motive. We pressed him and pressed him, but still he’d just smile and shake his head. 

“Do you think we won’t understand?” I remember asking him, trying a different angle of approach, “because, you’d be surprised. Was she cheating on you, was she about to leave and take the kids?”

Again, he smiled and shook his head. “She’d never do that, she was a good woman, perfect even”. 

“Then why did you kill her, what could make you hate so much that you’d murder your entire family?”

“It’s not that you won’t understand, Sir,” he murmured, that smile still on his lips and he refused to make eye contact, “it’s that I know you will, I know you’ll understand exactly why I did what I did, and I don’t want to inflict that on you”. 

I leaned over the interview table, unable to contain my contempt for him, “try me”. 

He finally looked up and made eye contact, and it’s then I saw it. Not madness in his eyes, not hatred. It was clarity, pure lucidity. 

“I have cancer” he said, “Doc says I have a month left at best”. 

“Then why kill them, why not make the most of the time you have left with them!?”

“Because”, he said, “I couldn’t be alone, I couldn’t wait for them in heaven, all on my own, so instead - [they’re waiting for *me*”.](https://old.reddit.com/r/samridingwrites/)

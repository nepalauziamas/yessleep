He's coming for me and I need to get this 
A few nights ago me and some friends decided to stay up all night to play some video games. It was a Friday so we didn't have any thing to do the day after. It was fun and we had a good time. I did some more gaming and cleaned my apartment when I woke up. Night came and I turned off all the lights. I couldn't sleep it felt like I was being watched, not by someone but my something. I decided I was going to watch some TV since I couldn't sleep. Walking through my bedroom Door I saw something. A man in the corner about 6'4 almost no distinct features except a hat very clearly a top hat well kept too. It was dark and I could barely see the rest of him. I quickly turned the light on but still I could feel his presence lurking, watching. I tried to shake the feeling "I'm just tired" I said as I slowly sat down. I watched TV but don't even remember what I watched. I never gave the TV more than half my attention. I couldn't stop thinking about him like he was engraved into my eyelids. Eventually morning came and by buddy Tyler came over he had stayed up with me and my other buddy whom neither of us had heard from. We talked and he said he couldn't sleep either when I asked him why he said "nothing it's stupid" I don't know why but I didn't push it. Stupid now that I think about it. 

After a while I could still feel him watching but as the day progressed he felt further and further away. Tyler went home around 1 because he needed to pick his wife up from work and do some other things. Night slowly rolled around and I felt him more and more again I couldn't sleep this time it was worse not just unsettling, it was terrifying. I tried watching TV again but I saw him in the hallway that connects my room to the living room. This time he wore a fedora it had a dark red band and his face had become more visible. His eyes held open it looked painful like he hadn't ever closed them his mouth was sewn shut and his nose was long and sharp. I could hear his breathing long careful breaths the TV was drowned out by it. I locked eyes with him as I did he tilted his head at a 45 degree angle and his mouth made a small smile. As if he was happy I had seen him. The longer I looked the harder it was to blink, eventually my eyes started to water and his smile only grew bigger. We stared until morning and he faded again but I could still hear his breathing feel him watching. My eyes were sore and dry but I could barely close them to blink. I sat alone that day, that was 2 nights ago. 

Last night is when I became even more concerned for my safety. Night time came the breathing louder and I looked for him but nothing. I sat down with a sight of relief almost. Then I felt it, his hand on my leg. Startled i tried to move but I couldn't I looked over and it was him his hat was now the top hat from before now covered in blood. He smiled but the stitches on his mouth were gone as if torn off. His yellow teeth sharpend to points. His hand felt burning, yet cold and it made the area touching it feel like when you foot goes to sleep and you try to move it. he was now fully visible he wore a tattered suit with a half torn tie. His pants matched the suit and his arm and legs were longer than they should have been compared to his chest. His feet were long and wore black dress shoes. His breathing quickened through out the night until he started taking raspy painful breaths put of his mouth. The morning came and I no longer saw him the breathing didn't cease his hand felt still there. 

As night approaches he has begun to talk to me. I can hear him telling me how my friends died, how it felt when he ate them, how it tasted. I'm scared, he's telling me that most people don't last this long.Â  That no one makes it past the 4th night. I can feel his hand again it's gripping my throat I looked in the mirror and u can see the burn marks of his fingers and the cuts if his nails on my back. I tried calling 911 but they just ended the call "don't call again it's illegal to prank call the dispatch number" I can't get him out of my head. I HEAR HIM I FEEL HIM. HE ISNT REAL RIGHT. I don't think I'm gonna make another part. It's 4pm and I see him again he's sitting next to me smiling telling me he's happy that I'm sharing my time with him. Please if you read this don't stay up at night he is real and he will come for you. It's getting hard to type, and I'm struggling to breath my eyes won't close and I'm getting tired. This will be my last post here goodbye everyone.

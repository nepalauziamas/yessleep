[**Part 2**](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/v9kbh5/the_stray_part_2/)

&#x200B;

It’s everywhere. I can’t sleep anymore because when I wake up it gets even worse. It has taken the place of almost everyone I know and love. No matter where I go. No matter what I do. It is there. I feel its eyes watching my every move. I don’t know what it wants. I wish it would just leave me be. All I know is what the stranger called it: The Stray.

It was about a month ago that it all began. I had recently taken up walking. As a hobby, I guess. No particular reason. I wasn’t lonely. I wasn’t looking to pick up joggers. And I wasn’t trying to get into shape. I already worked-out three times a week at an actual gym. I guess I just wanted to get away from all the hustle and bustle for a while, get some peace and quiet. The woods were perfect for that. They weren’t too far from home and my walks helped calm my anxiety.

I was sat in my grubby four-by-four office cubicle counting down the minutes. I looked forward to my me time. I was even excited for it. It felt like the clock taunted me. A ticking pain in the ass, hung on the wall of every cubicle. It was so quiet at the end of the day that you could hear all the clocks tick in unison.

Tick. Tick. Tick. A minute to go. My body shook with excitement to leave this place. That’s when those of us dumb enough not to leave early were called in for an emergency meeting. Blah. Blah. Blah. Boring shit I didn’t need to hear. I felt like I was back in school being complained at for everyone else’s bad attendance, while I’m unfortunately here.

As soon as it was over, I left the building faster than coyote chasing its lightning lunch. I was home before dinner and out again as soon as possible.

It was a mile or so walk to the trail and then I’d walk on through the woods. At my normal time the vibe of the woods was a pleasantry. It was too late for many people to be around, besides the odd jogger or two and too early for the night owls to be creeping out. But, today wasn’t normal. It was later than usual thanks to work. Those ticking time bombs still echoed in my ears. The woods weren’t as much of a pleasantry with the sun’s beams sifting away through the trees.

It was cold but still sunny. Darkness encroaching with every step I took deeper into the woods. The usual sounds of bird song were replaced with deafening silence, occasionally broken by a fox screech or an owl hoot. The scent of the trees changed. Nobody ever mentions how the smells of nature change at night. Earlier they’d have smelt vibrant and fresh, but now it was like a decaying flesh, and dirt, I could smell the dirt, as if I was buried alive with it spread all over me.

I proceeded forward nonetheless. I was determined not to be deterred, especially because of work’s disruption. This was my time for peace from all of life’s bullshit and I didn’t want to throw that away.

As I pushed deeper into the woods, I guess I let the darkness get to me because I nearly jumped out of my skin when a mob of teens on bikes ambushed me. They smashed through the woods like it was their private playground. Sped by at lightspeed.

“Eat shit fuckwart,” one screamed at me as they kept moving.

I gathered my composure. Ignored him and kept moving. Knowing that I was now on night owl territory. The walk on was more pleasant. I think I grew accustomed to my new surroundings. New smells, new sounds, new everything. There was a mystery to this new version of familiar ground. It was a welcome change to my routine. I guess I embraced this new side of the woods.

It was ten, maybe twenty minutes into my walk when I came across The Stranger. A seemingly harmless old man. He pattered aimlessly toward a small cliff edge where a bench watched over the small town. I couldn’t help but watch, I worried that he might fall or worse, he might jump. My mind quickly switched gears to “please don’t fucking jump. I don’t need to see that.” I continued to watch anyway. I may have come here to get away from people but I still cared.

The old man sat and watched out over the town. He mumbled something to himself over and over, that I couldn’t quite make out. It was a quick minute later when a jogger came speeding round a bend and stopped next to me. She was pretty with her blonde hair up in a ponytail. I would normally see her at the beginning of her run, but now she was on the way back.

She said nothing, just stared at me until…

…she said, “do you know that man.”

“No,” I replied, “I’m just making sure he’s okay.”

“Oh. Well, I wouldn’t mind him. He’s always here.”

“Always?” I asked.

“Same time. Everyday. He sits on that bench and mumbles to himself about some old superstitious tale of some sort.”

“Aren’t you here the same time everyday then too?”

“I guess so,” she laughed, “good point.”

If I had known then what I know now, I would never have stood there so long staring.

I introduced myself to the jogger: Jim Hawkins. I asked her name, but she refused to answer. She quickly gave me an ultimatum though as a way to learn it.

“If you listen to the old man’s story and tell me everything, I’ll give you my name,” she said.

“Haven’t you ever spoken to him,” I asked her.

“Only a Hi here and a see you there,” she answered.

“So, you don’t know the story.”

“That’s what you’re for,” she said with a smile, “I tell you what I’ll throw in a kiss with the name.”

If I wasn’t kidding myself, I would have believed that she added that because she liked me. I pondered her deal for a second and quickly gave in. It was a win win. I was just as intrigued as she was and I think she was too afraid to ask herself. Plus, I wanted to get to know Bethany better.

So, I dawdled up to the old man and sat beside him. He was horrified. I remember being glad he didn’t have a cane, otherwise he would surely have whacked me with it. The old man’s skin was pale and seemed to brown and peel around his heavily wrinkled face. He had liver spots all over and a distinguishable scar on his forehead. His hair was grey and neatly combed back with tufts falling out at the edges. The old codger scowled at me from under his thick brimmed glasses. We stared at one another for a while. I thought that at least if I ever had to pick him out of a line-up, I could identify him immediately. It was only minutes later that he spoke.

“What do you want?” he demanded, stained teeth on display.

I stuttered, “I would like to hear your story?”

“No, you don’t,” he responded.

“I really do. I’m intrigued.”

“Because of that,” he said, as he looked back to the jogger.

I nodded in response, befuddled by his wording. He stared for a while before dipping his head away as he considered the proposition, all the while mumbling to himself. I listened intently. If I could hear even one word. And I did. Just an old man’s ramblings, but I was positive I heard him say “I could die.” Was it a plea? A way to pass The Stray off to some other miserable soul? Or maybe I’m paranoid and he just needed to get his story off his chest.

The man soon raised his head.

A glint shone from his glasses as he smiled and said, “I’ll tell you my story. It’s too late for you now anyway.”

As he said it, his grimy hand grasped my arm, like that coyote caught in his own trap again. He wasn’t letting me get away. His darkened fingernails dug into my skin. His hands were less like that of an old man’s and more like those of a corpse. I suddenly realised that the man stank like he was eternally rotting inside. My heart thudded with a strange kind of fear. Something felt wrong. But I had reached the point of no return. I was a fly caught in the mouth of a dead man walking. I looked into his eyes, his pale dead grey eyes and swallowed the fear that shuddered through my bones.

“It’ll all start at midnight,” he said, “it always does.”

“What will?” I asked.

“Shut it! he commanded, “If you want to hear my story then you shut up and listen.”

I nodded.

“You’ll regret it if you don’t,” he leered with a snigger.

I did as he asked. I remained quiet while he spoke. Bethany watched from the side lines. I still can’t believe that she waited all that time.

The man continued, “What do you know about the war? Not your fancy techno wars, I mean the real war. World War Two.”

I shrugged, not wanting to break his rule. Also knowing that I didn’t know enough. What little I learned from school or what I had been told or what I had read here and there.

“I was twenty-four when I first signed up.”

I interrupted and said, “That’d make you—”

I stopped myself mid-sentence knowing I broke his rule. I winced as I slapped myself in my own mind.

“One-Hundred-and-Four,” the stranger said, “That’s my age.”

He didn’t seem angry I interrupted, so I interjected with “But that’s impossible.”

He may have smelt like a corpse but in all physicality, he didn’t seem as if he could be a hundred-and-four. People that old were wheelchair bound, had catheters and could barely talk. This guy was up and about and spoke with clear diction.

“There are things about the war that you don’t know. You’ve probably heard stories about the Nazi’s experiments with the paranormal, but you’ve probably never met one before.

“In Nineteen-Forty-Four I was shot out of the air by a German Messerschmitt, landed square in German territory. Luckily it was dark, so I was able to get away before being caught. I took refuge in a cabin with a family for weeks. They were hospitable. They didn’t give a damn about no war. They hated it. But they were starving, so one day the Reich came knocking. A prisoner would pay well they thought.

“That worked out for me, I was taken to a POW camp. But that family was slaughtered there and then. I heard their screams for mercy as I was dragged away, until it just stopped.

“It was a couple of months later when the camp was raided. We were paraded outside and forced to the floor. They chose volunteers one by one. The chosen were forced into a truck, blindfolded and drove to the middle of nowhere.

“It was night when we arrived. I could tell we were in the woods, by the smell alone. The blindfolds were removed as they took us inside a laboratory. We had individual cells, white walls, no windows and three meals a day. Better than what we had at the camp that’s for sure.

“I never saw the other men again. But I did hear them as they were escorted away one by one. First time was quiet, but the second, they kicked and screamed, begging to be spared. Begging for mercy. There was never a third time.

“I worried as the weeks passed. Soon it’d be my turn. And then they came. I gathered my composure as they opened the cell. I wasn’t going to let them break me. So, I accepted my fate. I knew the others were dead and that I was next.

“They escorted me into a darkened octagonal room. A light hung above that only lit the bloody gurney that sat in the middle. I remained calm as they strapped me in. There was a pane of glass opposite the table and I knew that these sick fuckers were watching from behind it. But, I wasn’t going to give them the satisfaction of seeing me break.

“I remember a scientist came over to me, with impeccable English, I mean this guy made me wonder if our own guys were behind this whole experiment. Anyway, he asked why I was so calm and all I could tell him was that I’m ready to die.

“They dragged out a machine. A gigantic lump of metal with all the bells and whistles. Like one of those brain scanners. I was pushed inside, as I heard a group of people in the darkness begin to chant something in another language. I think back to it now and wonder if they were even there, because I never saw them and no one ever took notice of the sound.

“Once I was neatly inside, the machine blasted on. I could feel every bone in my body vibrate as if it was trying to drag them out. It hissed as if it was ready to give out, but that was nothing compared to the chanting. It was in there with me by now and just got louder and louder, until it was screamed into my skull. I still hear it sometimes.

“It was then when the alarms went off—”

“Alarms,” I asked.

The stranger seemed unnerved by my interruption this time.

“Yes. And gunfire. Turns out my experiment was the same day the allied forces decided to invade the lab. Don’t ask me how they knew where we were, because I don’t have a fucking clue.

“Anyway, that scientist. The one with impeccable English tried to release me, but was shot down before he had the chance. His body fell over me. The vibrations. The energy the machine gave off seemed to bring him to life again for a second, because I swear, he looked at me.

“It was hours before the allies figured out how to turn It off, and when they did, they just pulled the plug.

“I felt my body twist and turn all that time, like it was trying to get escape me. I could feel blood slither down my face and merge with the scientists, whose body had mostly withered away by this point. It was only later, from documents found in the lab, that I discovered that no one else had survived the machine longer than five whole minutes.

“I was in there for two hours.

“Our allies dragged me out, writhing. And that’s when I saw it. A face among the darkness. Just one face. And all it did was stare my way. Head turned as if it was studying me. And no one else could see it. Nobody saw its grotesque bleeding eyes that were sunk too far into the back of its head. Or the hideous jagged smile that seemed as if it had been scratched into its pale grey skin. Nobody, but me could see the face of The Stray.”

The man had finished his story with the name of a curse.

“The Stray? Why do you call it that?” I asked.

“There are two reasons. The innocent one: it follows you like a Stray dog. Everywhere. Without fail.

“And then there’s the other meaning: back in the war when a soldier dodged a stray bullet, we didn’t consider that lucky like most would. We had seen far too many make that mistake, only to die a far worse death a week, month, year or more later. You dodged a bullet, but the Reaper’s blade is still coming for you. Even if it does have to drag you away kicking and screaming. We called them a Stray. Waiting to die. Waiting for that stray bullet to come back and send them to the grave.

“So, it only seemed fitting to call my pest - The Stray.”

I nodded. I had gotten used to nodding without speaking. Even though soon I’d realise the importance of conversation.

The stranger continued, “And now it’s yours.”

“What?” I said.

I couldn’t hold my nerves back any longer. I felt my face turn pale. My stomach turned. My hands trembled. I hadn’t even realised that they were when the man gripped hold of them…

…and said, “Soon, it will consume your every breathing minute. The people you love will fade to nothingness.”

He looked back to the jogger. She waved to us with a smile, no clue as to what was being said.

“That one. You like it. That one will fade eventually too.”

It? It still nerves me how he referred to her.

He continued, “and you’ll wish you never sat next to the old man. You’ll curse me to hell and die in agony just like me.”

He was right about that. I do wish that pitiful man a painful agonising death in whatever afterlife there is, in whatever hell there may be. I do wish I hadn’t sat on that bench.

“You now possess The Stray and it will watch you every waking minute with its cold, dark eyes.”

The Stranger rose from his spot and waddled away without another word.

I met back up with the Jogger and we arranged to have dinner together. It was late but she was adamant to hear what the old man said. I was shook. My hands still trembled. And I wasn’t even sure I believed the story. I didn’t know whether I should keep the date or just go home to bed.

She placed her hands on mine and asked, “What did he say?”

I brushed off the worry and agreed to go on with the date. We made our way to Palmetto’s, a small food truck with an outdoor dining area. She chose the place. I hadn’t even heard of it. It was busy but I didn’t care, I had good company and good food. It even helped calm me.

I relayed the story to her. Every sordid detail. She was almost as shaken as I was, but she was better at hiding it. I could tell though from how she was put off her food, twirling it with her fork without taking a bite.

She didn’t say a word when she abruptly leaned over the small metallic table and kissed me. It was longer than expected. I thought it would just be a kiss on the cheek but it was more.

When she pulled away, she just said, “Bethany,” with a smile on her face. Her Name.

We talked some more before she walked me home. I felt dumb being the one walked home, but my nerves were shot to the point where I didn’t realise what was happening until we were at the front door.

As I unlocked the door, I looked back to see her shuffling around by the gate. For the first time all night, it was clear on her face that she was as freaked as I was. I don’t think she felt safe walking home so far a distance.

So, I asked, “Do you want to stay the night?” I added, “I’ll stay on the couch or I could walk you home if you like.”

She smiled and said, “If it’s okay. I would like that.”

Bethany took the bed that night and I slept on the couch.

It was midnight when a sound woke me up. Fucking Midnight. I thought Bethany had woken looking for a drink or something, but that wasn’t the case. I leaned over the top of the couch and looked over to the kitchen, but it was just dark, empty, no sign of Bethany.

I fell back into the couch and looked dead ahead toward the other end. I could see nothing through the darkness, but I could feel that something was there. Watching.

“Bethany,” I called out, with no answer back.

My heart pounded. Whatever was watching me felt ominous. I concentrated as hard as I could until my eyes finally adapted to the darkness.

Stood before me in the dark was a Man? It just stood there and stared at me. Its eyes dark and hollow, set too deep into the back of its head. The sockets bloody and scarred. Blood trickled from the eyes along its smooth pale grey face. Its mouth was jagged and sharp engraved into the skin and extended too far around the face. Its teeth were sharply pressed together into a smile, the surrounding skin as if it had been torn open when it first grinned and clearly never stopped. Two stitches held the smile in at each corner, stretched tight to the edges of its oval head.

This thing just stood there and stared at me all night. I know because I couldn’t sleep with it watching me. So, I just waited for it to go. I waited and waited, but every time I looked back it was still there. Its head tilted to one side as if to study me, just like the old man said it would.

Just like [The Stray](https://www.reddit.com/r/Danominous/) always does.

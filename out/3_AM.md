this was last night, and i can’t seem of what to make of it. a little background story, my house was built in 1903 and we’re surrounded by woods. typical haunted house, right? normally the ghosts are dormant, sometimes we’ll hear drums or they’ll mess with the doors. on occasion we’ll hear the ghosts of the two little kids buried under our house running around the halls. nothing like what we experienced last night.

me (15f), my sister (22), and her boyfriend (21) were all awake at 3 am. first it was the texting back and forth.

‘do you hear that?’

‘did you hear the door?’

‘i thought the gate opened’

‘did you hear the rumbling?’

‘lock your door!’

my sister was very demanding that i lock my bedroom door, in case it was an intruder. she told me that her boyfriend was going downstairs and that they were letting their dog down to see what was going on. at exactly 3:33 am she started barking and growling, then my dog did as well. as we headed downstairs all of our blood was pumping, fight or flight kicking in. 


everything seemed normal, the doors were closed and the lights were off.. expect for one, the light nobody ever turns on, the light to the basement. we have a guard dog that’s between the basement and the kitchen, and he wasn’t growling or barking which was strange. he usually did both when the other dogs were doing it. we didn’t think to check the basement seeing as nothing could get between him and the basement without alerting him.
   

then we heard the screech. the sound so vibrantly coming from the basement. the sound that sent shivers down our spines. we looked around once more, thinking maybe our mother came home in the middle of the night and possibly let an animal into the house. 

nothing.

we went upstairs, grabbed our animals and we locked our bedroom doors. now, another weird thing is that my cat isn’t a very cuddly buddy. he prefers to be alone, and will come in on his own time. i love my cat more than anything, and i didn’t want to leave him alone with whatever could have been downstairs tormenting us. i picked him up and brought him into my room, thinking that he would try to leave but my door was locked so he couldn’t open it. he didn’t. he laid down and slept all night, occasionally looking around with wide eyes and his ears pinned back. 


finally the rumbling and the slamming and everything else stopped, i fell asleep around 10:30 am. 7ish hours of fear. 


can somebody help me make sense of this? why the ghosts wouldn’t be dormant anymore?


like i stated earlier, they have been pretty dormant the entire time we have lived here. you’d think if anything they would have been angry we moved in four years ago, and not be angry with us now. we’ve lived among them in peace the entire time, never cursing them or trying to get rid of them. they were always a part of our home, and now we cannot think of any reason they would suddenly be angry with us.

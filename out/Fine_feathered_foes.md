Another week goes by. Jonah and I lie low in the motel room. He tries to keep up with his studies as I work on recovering from the worst of my injuries. We do talk, but not much. He keeps asking questions that turn me mute. He tries not to get frustrated by my silence, but the whole dynamic feels like we are sinking in slow quicksand.

I can sort of limp around now. My ankle is the sturdy one, the knee will still take a while to get back to normal. I also managed to crack a rib at some point during my tumble down the stairs. That’s what I call it now. My tumble. Not the nightmare encounter with a laughing, disfigured entity in my old childhood home, no, it’s just lil’ clumsy old Ava as far as anyone else is concerned.

I’ve been smoking a lot of weed that I got off an old high school contact. Jonah doesn’t approve of how much I’m doing it, and it just drives the wedge further. I can’t blame him. I’m not the same person he dropped off at the airport a few weeks ago. When I started my life over in the city, I chose to rebuild myself out of features I most admired in characters from books or on TV. The girl Jonah fell for was made up of all the right building blocks. She was kind, a good listener, a strong communicator, witty, and hard-working. I saw that carefully crafted image shatter in his eyes the first time he walked inside this motel room. When he smelled the stale sweat and saw all those empty vodka bottles I’d left behind. He didn’t say anything, but he didn’t have to.

I’m high as a kite when I limp over to Jonah’s makeshift work desk. It consists of two bedside tables and a sheet of board he found near a dumpster. The board is covered in textbooks, sticky notes, notebooks, as well as an old laptop. He is working his ass off to not fall behind on his course work.

The marijuana isn’t doing the trick anymore, and I’m hoping for a new endorphin fix. I try to be smooth as I glide over from the side of the chair into Jonah’s lap, but my level of stoned as well as all the injuries result in a hard plummet into my boyfriend’s crotch. He shouts out in surprise (and pain), shoving me off as he struggles to stand up. I should be apologetic, but the few operational brain cells I have left decide that now is a good time to start laughing. I start with a snort and move up to a giggle. At some point I slide down to the floor, wincing at the pain my hysterics are causing my damaged rib.

Jonah watches me with dead eyes, and I wait for the inevitable. I wait for him to tell me I’m a pathetic sack of shit. That I’m a horrible girlfriend, a useless sister, and a general waste of space. Tears well in my eyes as I struggle to focus on his face through the haze of my lowest high.

“Ava, I think that’s enough,” Jonah finally speaks, after I’ve stopped laughing.

I turn my head from him and say nothing. I study the patterns in the faux wood that lines the bed frame. I think maybe it was supposed to resemble light maple wood at some point, but the years have worn it down to a faded, grimy eyesore.

“I know you think that driving me away with this half-silent-half-crazy bullshit is better than opening up and risking me leaving anyway,” he lowers his voice to an intimate husk, sliding down to sit at my side, “But that’s not going to happen. I’m all in here. We’ve had three amazing years together. How many people our age stay together this long?”

My skin breaks out in light shivers as Jonah wraps his arm around me, pulling me close. He smells like gold autumn leaves, shower gel, and the tiniest hint of a musty scent from the old stairwell in our building. There is nothing stopping the tears from flowing now, and I push my face into the nook of his shoulder. The broken toddler inside is alive and well, blindy grasping on to another body for a sense of warmth and security.

“We will get through this,” he nods, stroking my hair the way my mother would have done if she hadn’t disappeared from my life, “There is a lot to unpackage here, but we will get through it and we will leave here together.”

We stand across the street from my childhood home. Jonah holds my hand as I try to control my grip on his palm and fingers. I don’t want to squeeze too hard and betray the natural panic that rises at the sight of this place. Last night I explained I couldn’t find the words to tell him everything just yet. But I did promise to show him.

So here we are.

I lift my head and use my free hand to shield my eyes from the morning sun. The rays splash out like a halo, giving the edges of the roof a vicious radiance. I look up at the old attic window and roof pipe beneath it. The window is closed, dust covering the pane and glass so completely I don’t think I could see inside even if my face was pressed against it.

I don’t think it’s a good idea to go inside, but I can start letting Jonah in on what happened by showing him the back yard and telling him about Robin’s episode with the bird. He supports my weight as I try to keep the pressure off my knee as we walk. It takes us a lifetime to make our way through the front yard, along the perimeter of the house, and, finally, to the backyard.

My stomach sinks a little as I see how much more growth has mixed in with the trash since I was last here. The path to the aviary has managed to sprout tall weeds, when just two weeks ago it had been entirely flattened to the mix of pebbles and dirt that line the ground. Being as it was so well-trodden then, I have to assume that Robin (or someone else) came out to the aviary quite frequently.

“We have to go through there. It’s supposed to be a path,” I say to Jonah as he nods, straining to support more of my weight as we step through the dusty weeds and prickly shrubbery. I think of how much coming here has changed him. Gone is the clever input guy, the one with an opinion on everything. He has become so quiet, almost like he can sense the magnitude of this place, the danger of it.

The bars of the cages start poking out at odd angles whenever there is a gap in the branches that hang low over our heads. This morning is a stark contrast to the day I found Robin talking to the bird creature. The sun rays tickle the back of my neck and head, and the smell of an early spring starts stirring images and sounds buried deep within my conscience. I let go of Jonah when we reach the opening at the mouth of the aviary. I hobble over to study the empty cage floors, which are made up of a rust-coated sheet metal. There are some empty feeders, rotting wood perches. Even bigger than the absence of birds is the lack of feathers, which used to line the floors of the cages.

“I don’t remember much of ma because I was so little,” I talk without thinking, without filter, “I think it was just before my third birthday that she disappeared for good,” I run my fingers down the door to the biggest cage in the aviary, the one that used to house the expensive white doves, “Even before that she wasn’t around much. No one said it directly, but the whole town knew she wasn’t right in the head. After I was born, she spent most of her days at the mental health institution outside of town, the one where Robin is staying now.”

I stand in the middle of the cage, turning slowly as I take in every minor detail of my old play space. Robin and I must have spent thousands of hours in and out of these cages, playing hide and seek, playing house, talking about our mother.

“I have one very faded memory of myself, ma, and Robin. I lose more of the visuals each year, but I remember the small details. I remember this cage in particular,” I gesture around me, “It was filled with about a dozen white doves. I remember my father complaining about it frequently. How it cost too much, how he hated cleaning it, and so on. Anyway, my mom adored the birds. She often hummed as she cleaned the cages, the sound of her voice harmonizing with the coos around her. Robin and I were there too, following her around, relishing in the presence of this mystical woman that reigned supreme in our minds. Ma, mom, mother. Nothing felt half as good as having her home.”

My leg muscles grow weak and I feel myself buckling a bit, my ankle struggling to sustain the weight of my upright stance. Jonah rushes over, lowering his head to get through the short entrance of the cage. He is at my side in an instant, and I lean into him.

“Ma would have us gather the feathers off the ground. She would help us too. The three of us would collect the white feathers, fill a bucket with water, and wash them out. Then ma would use them to make something beautiful, like a purse or a pen. I know she once made Robin a lovely straw hat that she lined with the feathers. I don’t remember this part, but Robin insists ma always told us to follow the birds. In times of trouble and darkness, for when she wasn’t around, we were supposed to follow her white doves. That’s why we spent so much of our childhood playing in these cages. It helped us feel close to her in some way.”

I’m about to segue into the present, into my stay with Robin on that very first night, when the cage door slams shut behind us. A large rain cloud appears on the horizon, edging closer to obscure the sun.

“Oh god,” I breathe, sinking to the ground as Jonah lets go of me to run over to the shut door, “I should never have brought you here. What was I thinking?”

“What the,” he says, clinging to the cage bars, shaking the hinges off the rickety frame. The structure looks so fragile, it should easily give way. Maybe out there, in the normal world. But not here, not now.

I first hear the hiss to my right, barely audible above the panicked pounding in my chest. I jerk my head to look in the direction of the noise, detecting very slight movement in the tops of the tall wild grass. It starts far in the distance, and edges closer with a second hissing that runs so low it could be mistaken for a growl.

“Jonah,” I call out, pulling myself off the ground, limping over to the other side of the cage, “Jonah something is coming from the grass.”

My boyfriend stops rattling the cage door and turns to face the shaking weeds. Two seconds later, a snake appears at the far side of the cage. The creature has a triangular black head the size of a human fist, polished scales, and two toxic-yellow eyes. Its thick, heavy torso appears to be endless as it slips into view one ring-fold at a time. I don’t know much about snakes, but this one doesn’t look real. It’s loosely reminiscent of a black adder picture I once saw in a school textbook, but it’s like the proportions have been wildly exaggerated.

Curtains of dark grey choke out the sun and a small rumble comes from the brewing sky above our heads. The snake lets out a final growl-hiss and plunges to the rusty bottom of the cage, heading straight for us. Desperate, I grab a nearby feeder, feeling the sun-worn plastic shatter to tiny pieces in the palm of my head. It’s not much, but I throw the sharp bits of plastic at the snake’s head as it draws near. The creature does not even blink, much less flinch at my feeble attempt to deter it. I consider kicking at it, but I can barely stand up on two feet, much less one. As the snake pulls even closer, Jonah grabs me by the shoulders and pulls me back, shielding my body with his by stepping out in front of me.

“What are you doing?” I shout, tugging at his upper arm, trying to draw him back to my side.

My attempts are futile and the snake lunges at Jonah’s front, exposing ghost-white fangs that look a lot like two inverted elephant tusks. The bite makes Jonah keel over as he stumbles forward, stepping onto the creature’s tail. The snake-thing hisses again, twice as agile as it begins to wrap itself around the bottom of Jonah’s legs, snapping his feet together like a rubber band. The sheer force of the snake’s pull is enough to throw my boyfriend entirely off balance. He loses his footing and falls back in a straight line, a sick crack echoing through the aviary as his back, neck, and head all meet the rusty surface of the sheet metal beneath my feet.

This all happens in a matter of seconds, and I’m far too late as I run over to Jonah’s side, desperate to pull the thing off his body. Miraculously, Jonah’s eyes are still open, though his pupils swim in and out of focus sporadically. I pull on the disgusting, scaly-leather surface of the giant snake, trying to claw it off my boyfriend’s body. Nothing works as the creature’s torso has managed to wrap itself around Jonah completely, squeezing the life out of him with calculated strokes.

I raise my head in stupid, blind prayer as the brooding sky releases its first set of rain drops. Far from a downpour, the water mist kisses the skin on my face with gentle commiseration. My own tears mix with nature’s, as I open my eyes to see something that stifles the breath in my lungs.

Giant, white wings spiral down toward my head at an incredible speed as the enormous bird deep dives into the enclosure from above. It cuts through the old metal bars with ease, iron-fist wings moving metal to make way for its enormous body. The bird’s red eyes flare as it clasps its talons on the head of the slithering heap of black. The snake lets out this high-pitched squeal, a sound I would never associate with an actual reptile. The white bird brings down its tremendous beak, slicing the snake’s head off with minimal effort. A horrible stench fills the aviary. It smells like a bag of old potatoes that has been left out to rot in the sun. A green liquid oozes out of the neck of the snake. I linger for a second, eyeing the bird as it prepares to take off into the sky.

“Thank you,” I whisper to the sheet-white feathers as the creature raises its wings in flight. It does not acknowledge me. All in all, I am graced with its presence for less than a minute before it disappears into the heavy clouds. I barely even had a chance to look at it.

I run over to Jonah, pulling the snake corpse off his body. It’s lucky I hardly ate breakfast that morning, because up close the smell of the snake’s oozing insides is even worse. How can any living thing smell like the essence of decay? Poor Jonah is covered in the green stuff, but he is still breathing and his pulse is steady. Something tells me I need to get him out of these soaked clothes before I think of a way to get us out of this cage.

“Is this really the time and place, Ava?” Jonah’s weak voice interrupts me as I pull off his jeans.

“Oh God,” I cry in relief as I press my face into his bare chest, trying not to panic as I notice the two thin, bloodless teeth marks that decorate his left peck, “You’re okay."

“Not if you keep straddling me harder than that snake,” he mumbles back, but he is smiling through pale, cracked lips.

We both freeze in renewed horror as we hear a jingling noise coming from the path to the aviary. The rhythm of the noise obscures the object causing it. It could be a wind chime, or a children’s music instrument. A chilling whistle accompanies the sound as it grows nearer, and soon, we hear footsteps.

“Heya darlin’,” I hear his horrible, old-smoker’s voice before I see him emerge from around the corner, “Was wonderin’ when you’d come home.”

My father walks into view, pausing at the entrance of the cage with a giant set of keys that he sorts through with his dirty, [tobacco-stained fingers](https://www.reddit.com/r/peculi_Dar/comments/vnkyf3/feathers_in_the_attic_series_hub/).

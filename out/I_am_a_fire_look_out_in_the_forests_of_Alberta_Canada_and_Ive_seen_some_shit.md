My first encounter with the super natural was with an entity called The Weeping Widow, but I’m getting ahead of myself. 


So, I work in a fire look out tower. I know I know, “what a dope job!, do you get to smoke weed all day? There can’t be THAT many fires, right?”


Well, One- yes there are quite a few wild fires. 
Two- no (unfortunately). I have to keep a LOOK OUT, and there are times I see things I could only wish were marijuana induced misapprehensions, but they’re not. Things that go bump in the night exist here. This specific tale is about my co worker Sally. 
At the time, she had both of her arms, but my first day as a look out, wasn’t her best day ever. 


A little back story- My name is Zoe. I’ve worked in these woods for 15 years now. No, I will not tell you exactly where. I want y’all to live. You’re welcome. 



It started out fun, something new to help me find a real purpose, a life I could be happy with, but now..now it’s just a task I must fulfill. Life isn’t a collection of good and bad days anymore, as much as an endless night of terror. The campers smiles stretch far too wide. Voices that call out of the forest are of people long gone. Horrors crawl out of some invisible abyss here. The things I’ve seen….Im sorry, I lose myself in writing sometimes. I’ve always journaled, but I’m not an expert writer by any means. I just hope to share with someone, anyone, even if it’s just this page, the things I’ve experienced the last decade and a half. Maybe it will lighten the load? That’d be nice. 



So I’m 47 now, but when I was 32 I realized I hated my life. I sat in a cubicle 9 hours of the day, wasting away. It was a pitiful existence. Sleep, eat, shit, cry, all in a very expensive 2 bedroom apartment. Alone. I yearned for the active life I’d once lived. 


 As a child, I had spent most of my time outdoors. At first,  it wasn’t my choice. My mother had ‘visitors’ and she would send my sister and i outside to play for hours at a time. Boogie men in their own right. My mother loved the creeps with a little money. As A young lady, I joined Girl Scouts, and i thrived.  I loved it, and all the neat things I could learn. All the freedom the outdoors had to offer me. By my senior year in HS, I would camp whole weekends at the lake to just get away from my mother, and by then, my older sister Lilith too. 



I found myself being accepted to a college in a state next to where id grown up, and I ran to it. My 20s were filled with school and more school, if I’m honest. I didn’t have many friends. One close friend-  Marie. I met her freshman year, but she passed away a few years back now. One boyfriend of a year, then he cheated on me. All the sudden, it was like time sped up and when I looked up, i was a single 32 year old woman with some degrees, no kids, no real friends, and “absolutely nothing going for myself” as my mom would have said, bc to her marriage, 2.5 kids, a dog and white picket fence=fulfillment as a woman on this planet. A dinner cookin, no career having, baby maker like my older sister had so dutifully grownto be. We 3 tend to disagree on a lot, but I digress -i did have something going for myself, enough savings to disappear. Run away to the wilderness, the freedom I longed for. So, I did just that. 



When I reached Canada, I felt the chip I was carrying, fall off my shoulder. I was lighter here.  The wilds of Alberta had me in awe. The colors. Breathe taking views, from spectacular heights I had never seen before. Where I come from, it’s nothing but rolling wheat fields and billowing trains horns. Here though, there were trees for miles. No angry, smoggy traffic or concrete cities to interrupt Mother Nature and her work. Nothing to interrupt the eldritch horrors and their  ‘work’, either. More on that later, I promise. Sometimes, I like to reminisce on the beauty that this place once was for me before all the blood. All the loss. 



I truly fell in love with the land when I arrived. There were more individual types of wildlife than there were individual people out here, and I loved it this way. Listen, I can appreciate the odd new friend, old close relationships, and hell sometimes I can even stomach a date, but not for long. It’s like the longer I’m around.. them, the more time I need a part. To recharge my social batteries, in simple terms. 



  So, I found myself settling in a small rental cabin at the foot of a mountain, with a stream running near by. It was picturesque, and did I mention affordable? I had barely 6 months worth of savings, if I didn’t eat very often so I needed to find a job quick. That’s when I saw a job opening tacked to the announcements billboard in the very small(and only) grocery store/gas station building while making my rounds a few weeks in. 
It said that they were looking for an individual with great eyesight, and a love for isolation and the wilderness. Sign.me.up. So I called, had an interview and was hired the next day. 



When I went in, I met another fire lookout, Sally, who goes by Sal. And don’t forget it! she’s still in the tower directly to the north of me. She was there with our boss, Mr. Pritchett. He asked for my resume, while Sally asked me the regular interview questions. Right as I thought the interview was to end, mr Pritchetts face hardened, and he said I have a very serious question to ask you, “Do you believe in the super natural?”
I thought it was a joke as I started to chuckle, I realized sally had a very somber look. She spoke up, “do you, Zoe?”



Shit, I didn’t then. I lied. I said yes. I said I believed in ghosts, vampires and even the Jersey devil. I NEEDED this job, and for some reasons these people needed me to believe in things I didn’t. I was hired on the spot. They asked if I could start orientation first thing the next morning. 




6am sharp, I was at the door of Sallys cabin. It was  situated next to her tower which is a steel monstrosity.  A colossal silvery monolith jutting out the top of the mountain. A stark contrast to the greens and browns of the natural ecosystem surrounding it. I got lost in mh thoughts, as I heard Sal holler out the cabin window to come in for coffee. I swung the door of the cabin open to find a compact studio with a bed in one corner, a kitchenette in the other, a walled off bathroom, and loveseat couch with tv mounted on the wall, not 4 feet away. It was small, but it was livable. And there would be no one to bother me but the other fire look outs. 



Sal poured me a cup of joe, and asked if I was excited to start my new job with an odd look on her face. I couldn’t read her very well. I was, of course ecstatic. I was going to be doing a job that I enjoyed. The first time I’d be doing some thing I enjoyed since university, I told her. She almost looked sad for a moment, then her expression softened and she said “okay, let’s head up then.”



Once we got to the bottom of the tower, my coworker started doing some.. interesting things to say the least. She took a baggie of dark powder out of her vest pocket and rubbed it over the door frame. There were many  marks of grey powder on the door frame. I could tell she had been doing this for a very long time. We trekkked the never ending steps to the cab of the tower, and once in- she locked the door. I smiled to myself and thought who was gonna break in up here? An elk? But I didn’t question it and watched her as she got to work. After locking the door, she dumped a line of salt around the whole perimeter of the cab. she put on her yellow work vest from which she had retrieved the powder, but it wasn’t any ordinary reflective vest. This one had runes inscripted on it, odd tassels and and baubles adorned the back. Then she handed me my own and told me to put it on as she waved a burning sage bundle amongst the room. By this point, I honestly thought Sally had lost her mind and was going to sacrifice me to some old god. I held the vest in my arm as she finished saging. “You should really put that on, Zoe. It’s almost 630am. Out here, You don’t wanna get caught in a blizzard without a parka, and you don’t wanna get caught past 7 am without your vest. Just believe me, eh? “



Sally looked like a trustworthy person. She’s 5 years older than me, and a bull of a woman. Almost 6 ft tall, head full of wild red curls, and a Canadian accent like I’d never heard. She’s tough, with the scars to show for it. She doesn’t talk much, but neither do I. After finishing with the sage, she sat down at the control desk, and grunted at me with a wave of her hand to come sit in the chair next to her. I thought she was going to go into detail about all the things she had just done, but instead we got into the basics of how to use the radios, how it do weather reports, how the equipment worked, Where the back up generator was. She showed me everything, but not a word about the rituals. The only off thing was that she showed me two panic buttons. Red button for ‘normal’  and black button for not normal’
Thanks sal… . . 



As the morning wore on, I was getting a hang of the routine. I was scanning for fires, sending in my reports, learning how to use tools like the ‘fire finder’ when I heard sally say an exasperated ,”oh no..today? Really?” from behind me. I looked out among the trees expecting to see a small fire or mishap, but nothing. The only thing I noticed was that the clouds had gotten very dark very fast, and I was pretty sure the weather didn’t call for rain today. “Looks like it’s gonna rain, sally? Was that in the forecast?”



“Told you, the names Sal. No Zoe, we aren’t due for rain at all this week. Supposed to be dry as a bone. Hell, it still is. This ain’tordinary rain. See how them clouds are twisting up? See the color? See the faces? Rain clouds, they ain’t.”


I was confused and worried. Sal had done some kooky shit up until this point,  but now she was telling me there were faces in the clouds. “Oh Come on sal, bet some clouds just built up off the edge of the lake.  We could use some rain anyways.”


I realized that sal was no longer paying attention because she was too busy pulling what looked like a sheet of plastic  over the windows from a large spool installed on the side of the wall. I watched in shock.  She then took wood sheets that were stacked in the corner, to cover the windows. She had a set up. There were already  groves and hooks for the wood to slide into. Locks on around the edges that she snapped into place. She was working fast, but I kept asking questions. I even started removing the boards behind her. “Uh, Sally? Seriously, isn’t it our job to watch for lightning??? I mean fire looks out and all..We could miss a fire?”


“Z, ima call you Z. Z, you really don’t listen… again, SAL. And I TOLD YOU, this ain’t no regular rain. These clouds dont rain, they weep tears. And those tears are acid or some sort of shit that will burn the living hell out of ya, Z. Now stop that,  and help me get these windows covered. It’s almost 9am now, innit?? Hurry. For some reason, this one likes to show up exactly on the hour.” 


I couldn’t make sense of what she was doing or saying so I didn’t help. I sat down  in a chair, defeated and slightly scared. Nervous that Sal was losing it, and if she wasn’t then- what the fuck was going on? 



“Sal, you gotta give me something. What’s going on? Is this a prank? Har har -got me. Got the new chick from the States. I’m scared now so ha ha you win.” I said with my hands raised in front of me. I was starting to tear up at this point. 
Sal looked at me with one eye brow cocked up like the Rock  himself, “ girl, this ain’t no joke. I told Pritchett that you shoulda read the rules,  but he just kept saying that he’d never get anyone hired if we did that.  NOW, I got you acrying in my lookout tower while the weeping widows are blowing in. God have mercy. Y’all women and your crying” 



My face contorted. The tears dried up quickly, and now my interest was piqued, but so was my fear, “weeping widows, what? “



“ listen, I don’t know how, or why all the monsters that roam out here come to be, but I do know that they are dangerous. You ain’t gonna make it unless you follow the rules, kid. They’re tried and true. So help me get this wood over these windows or you’ll end up melted by acid tears. We don’t have much time“



I did what she said. After a few minutes We had two windows left to cover up when all the sudden one of the radios on a far shelf  starts screaming at an ungodly shrill level. It was so sharp. Sal said something, but I couldn’t make it out over the wailing of the radio. I ran to it, but once I picked it up, I noticed it was already turned off.  I started twisting all the knobs, pressing buttons-in an instant it was silent all around. 


“Jesus, what the hell was that, sal??? It was OFF. How did that happen? You ever heard anything that loud bef…. Sal?….. Sal! What are you doing? Are you okay?”


She was sitting in front of the last uncovered window. The plastic was over it, but the wood lay carelessly discarded on the floor. He face was closer to the window than normal. It almost seemed like she was inching forwards, ever so slowly, moving closer to the glass. I was across the room in the completely wood covered corner. 


I laid the radio down, “Sal, you’re scaring me for real now. Y’all got me good. Please come on now”



In a flash of glass and blood, Sal smashed her face into the glass over and over with more force than a human should be able to muster. I screamed. Sal laid there, dazed. Glass shards stuck out of her face at haphazard angles. She had created a large break in the glass, and The sun shown through the open window, playing fractals of rainbows on the walls around us. For a moment, I thought she was dead then she was Sitting up. Sal was attempting to climb out the window. I could hear something like rain or maybe rushing water, but I could still see the sun shining on the wall behind her. In that
Moment, i was more scared than I’d ever been. I wanted to hide, and unfortunately I did. I’m a coward, but atleast I know it. I hid under the desk, as I heard her whimpering as she gouged her palms and knees  with the glass still stuck to the frame. The thought of my coworker dying on my first day of mynew dream Job while I hid under a desk, drug me from my hidey hole. 



Sal had managed to get halfway out the window, glass debri and blood loss had slowed her immensely, but one arm and her head hung out the window while the rest of her lay limply against the window pain inside the cab of the tower. Her legs were trying to push her up and out. I listened, and the rain sound had slowed. The sun shone brighter on the wall so I went for it. I clenched my eyes shut as hard as i could and grabbed her. I tried to pull her in the window, away from the outside. She wailed. She begged to please let her go. She wanted,  no needed to be with her lost love. It made no sense. Sal has a girlfriend at home. And from the way she was bellowing, you would have thought she was Juliet finding Romeo. I pulled harder. She gave a bit. I took a deep breathe, and yanked. 



We went flying backwards. The sudden loss of balance and falling backwards made me open my eyes. I will never forget what I witnessed.



 It was a cloud, sure in a loose sense, but something was inside. I thought I had heard rain, but I was wrong. The being itself was viscous. It was undulating, waves of something within, oscillating to and fro in violent fits that scattered out a sort of mist. It didn’t have a face by human standards. No, not really. It was a flowing mixture of agony and beauty. In its center, behind waves of what looked like liquid steel was an eye. . I felt an eternity of tragedy for the brief second before I snapped my eyes back shut. It told me stories of forgetting, loss in the most permanent sense. Infinite time filled with not remembering. How it had been abandoned, and the pain it suffered because of that. What it longed for…And then it was over. 



I lay in the middle of the room with a broke and battered Sal laying on top of me. Her arm  and cheek looked like someone had dumped acid on her. The glass in her face, swollen with coagulated blood about. I pushed her off of me, and noticed I had urninated on myself.  I immediately ran to the work phone to dial 911 when I heard-
“No. Don’t…. Bl….ack button, z…..black button…Man I fucked u..” and she passed out again. I ignored her request and called Pritchett. he told me he would call the police. He did not. 10 minutes later, emergency personnel who did not look anything like the RMHP and more like the Us secret service climbed  the stairs of the tower in black suits carrying medical supplies. I had gone back to holding Sal, praying she would pull through. They took her off on a stretcher, while Pritchett and another employee spoke to the 
…law. Everyone but Pritchett and the other coworker  left, we sat down. Without a word, he handed me two papers, one with a very very generous yearly salary, and another with a set of rules. “Can you cut it?” He asked 


“Probably not”


“See you tomorrow then. Tower 7.  The only one south of here. It’s 10 km as the crow flies from here, but about 16 on the road. You’ll work with Scott.” Pritchett sounded like he was truly exhausted. 
 


A burly man with a gentle smile said, “hey young lady, I’m Scott. We’ll work together tomorrow. Don’t forget your vest and some food supplies. I don’t cook” he said. I nodded and he finished with, “ and hey,  none of this funny business though.”He chortled, As he gestured to the ruined window stained with blood. I did not laugh with him.



I took a deep breathe and a moment to collect myself. “See you then?”, I said Witth very little confidence.



“See ya then,ma’am” even though he was atleast a decade my senior. Manners, I thought. Interesting. 



As we were pulling off, another van pulled up. I watched 3 people with supplies to clean and replace the window get out and start up the metal stairs. As they turned their backs to us I realized that they were also wearing vests, similar to the ones Sal and I had worn. 



The next day while working with Scott we did the same rituals. We had no ‘funny business’ as Scott refers to it. Halfway through the day we got a call from Pritchett that Sal was going to lose her forearm due to the acid. It had burnt through to her bone. Melted parts of the bone until they were only brittle remnants. The dr said the stuff on her face was thankfully only splatter. It still burnt through to her gums in one area. 
Sall is tough though, you have to be to survive out here. She still works in the towers north of me. She loves this land and would never leave, but it sure doesn’t love back. All it does is take. 



I asked Scott about the weeping widow later that shift, and all he would say was the more you discuss these things- the stronger they get, so he refused to believe in them. They do not exist, he said even though Sal’s arm now ended at her elbow, and she has a scar shaped like a heart on her cheek. He thought that this disregard, avoidance, would keep him safe. I wish it had, but In the end, it didn’t. Or maybe he’s still out there, we never did find his body. That’s a story for another day though. 



Unfortunately for us, these brutish hellions really do exist no matter how much we try to tell ourselves that the shadow we saw was only that or that the voice we heard was just the wind. They drag themselves into our reality, starving, ready to feed on our hopes, dreams, and flesh. Abominations of your wildest fantasies. The forests beauty masks what crawls from the beneath the depths of the land and lakes when the sun sets. 




 That was my first day on the job in the woods of northern Alberta 15 years ago, and I still don’t have a clue as to why this place exists the way it does. But the old land persists, and I have a job to do. Protect the forest and the people in these towers; Follow the rules, and make it out alive.

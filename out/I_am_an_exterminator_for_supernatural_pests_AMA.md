 I’ve worked in the Southwest United States as a supernatural exterminator for about 12 years at this point, and I’m sort of surprised that I haven’t seen more posts about this type of thing over here. I don’t want to disclose my own salary for privacy’s sake but I’ll say that it’s well within the 6 figure range, if you’re good. 

I know a good bit of people are probably interested in that kind of money, but I need to explain a few things first—most importantly, the industry is regulated, and the Bureau of Supernatural Services is your big boss. They also watch the news wires to make sure you don’t have any public slip-ups on the job. 

Alright, on to the actual tips/info.

One, I absolutely do not recommend this job if you have any health issues. Heart issues? You’re going to be dealing with literal monsters. Epilepsy? Some poltergeists can get trigger happy with the light switches. Bad knee? You’re going to be doing a *lot* of running around. And from. It’s not exactly the same brand of manual labor as construction, but it is hard on your body. Luckily you can usually afford an early retirement if you play your cards right.

Two, you’re going to have to be certified if you want to make as much money as possible. This is generally an easy process, you just have to shadow under another exterminator for six months and then take a certification exam—usually routing out some spirit infestation, but sometimes they’ll throw nasty stuff at you, like a ghoul nest or a mycelium infection. Based on your performance, you’ll get either a bronze, silver, or gold stamp, and that’ll determine the equipment you can buy from retailers and what types of jobs you’re legally allowed to do. You can retake the certification exam every three years.

Now, this is the sort of job that accepts you even if you have a criminal record, but they’re a bit wary of accepting people with mental health issues and dealings with paranormal activity in the past. It can make you a bit more liable to injury or bad jobs, but it isn’t *the* final decision, just a contributing factor. They’ll approve you if your work is good enough and your mentor can vouch for you. Just expect to have to explain yourself over call in the probationary period after you take the cert exam, they try to make sure you don’t sound unhinged.

You’ll also sign an NDA after you get your cert level—don’t talk about your equipment, where you get it, who let you buy it, what you need it for, what you’re doing 5,000 miles away from home—all of that. Breaking it isn’t a crime, but the bureau will strip you of basically everything related to exterminating, and blacklist you from doing work.

Third, and this is kind of tame compared to the last two, you’ll be driving. A lot. I put 80,000 miles on a truck just last year, even got up to 100,000 when I first started up. You can have a set area of operations, but if you really wanna get a good clientele list, you’re gonna have to be willing to stretch your comfort zone a little bit more, loyalty goes a pretty long way in situations like these. You won’t get many repeat customers—be wary if you do—but word of mouth means your name will be put around a good bit. 

Fourth, don’t talk about your job if you want to keep it. Confidentiality is VERY important. There’s nothing official like HIPPA as far as jobs for specific clients, but you can get your certification stripped and your equipment seized if you talk about this to anybody who isn’t hiring you or isn’t another exterminator. Luckily, I’m retiring, so I don’t really care if they manage to pin down an anonymous post on me or not. 

Fifth and finally, find yourself a partner. Immediately. 

Everything else is pretty much like your normal job. Get a good tax accountant, make sure you put cash into expanding the business, don’t spend money faster than you make it, whatever other (better) advice you want to take to heart.

You’ll get full health insurance from the BoSS, but your pay will be dictated by whatever clients you take. Your retirement is also completely up to you, as they don’t want to risk pensions for exterminators showing up in government spending reports.

EDIT: 

Reading over this, I don’t feel like I’m doing the work justice. It’s hard. You’re probably gonna hate it, or at least parts of it. You’re sure as hell going to hurt in the morning, and I really don’t want anybody who’s too green around the ears trying to land this job and ruining their life, so let me tell you a story. I think this was my third or fourth job, so a few things are fuzzy, but it still gets the point across.

This must’ve been around winter of 2010. Louisiana area, bad rain, worse roads. Got a call about mausoleums being cracked open in the dead of night, a few freshly buried caskets having the dirt disturbed.

Could have been a lot of things, but I was betting on ghouls. They love to suck the embalming fluids out of corpses before they rot, and newly buried dead are a fresh source of formaldehyde. Took about three days to get down to the graveyard, and when I did, it was raining cats and dogs, but I was on a deadline—another job had opened up in Mississippi, and I could be there if this wrapped up fast enough.

You don’t really have to take much out whenever you’re just scouting the area, but I was fairly confident I already knew what it was, so I took my flashlight, a shovel, and a couple traps meant to snare ghouls so you could relocate them to abandoned graveyards. (They’re good at managing rats and vengeful dead.) It was maybe ten at night, but this was before the time change and with an overcast sky, so it was pitch-black. Not even the moon shone, so it was just the 9-volt flashlight lighting my way.

It was pretty routine at first. Inspect the disturbed graves, check out the mausoleum entrances, put a trap at each, but something just felt . . . off. Usually, when you have a ghoul problem, they aren’t very quiet. They’ve gotten a bit used to exterminators over the years, and while they aren’t friendly, they aren’t afraid to skitter across your path if they feel like it, but this graveyard was just. Silent. Deathly quiet, which is sort of ironic given the woods around there are anything but on any other given day.

I think that was the first sign, anyway. No wildlife around making a racket. No cicadas, no frogs, not even mosquitoes biting my neck. Nothing. I sunk the shovel into the disturbed earth underneath my foot anyways, and looked up, and then there was that deer standing in front of a headstone.

I sort of thought it was an ornamental statue at first—like how some people get statues of the Virgin Mary on top of their graves, maybe some real avid hunter’s final wish—but then it turned to look at me. And screamed.

I’ve probably heard worse, being at it as long as I have, but that’s the one that sticks with me. A deer, a buck, the nubs still covered with felt, screaming like some sort of demon as it charged at me. I nearly shit myself, and damn nearly tripped, but I managed to duck behind a row of graves as it charged, dropping my flashlight as I did. The only thing on hand was the shovel—I’d meant to dig up a body, check to see if it'd been drained, but there wasn’t a point. The skinwalker was much more concerning.

It reared at me again, walking on its back legs and swinging its hooves at me wildly, but I swung, felt the crack of metal on bone. Watched it go down, watched it crack its head on the headstone, and as the blood ran down, the body went limp.

For a second.

And then it was back up, jaw at some impossible angle, gargling in some sick way as it drew back up to its full height, its body going *in* and *snapping*. I swung again, but slower, and I barely clipped its leg as it stepped back. The skinwalker was changing again, and I was pretty much dead at that point. A human against a walker in its true form was never a fair match-up, and if I could get to my truck in time, I wouldn’t be able to get at the rifle I had stashed in the bed before it was on top of me, with the teeth it was newly growing. 

Not like I had any other choice, though. I ran with the shovel in hand like a dipshit, scooped my flashlight off the ground and booked it like the hounds of hell were after me. Barely made it twenty feet whenever I heard its footsteps gaining, covering ground twice as fast as I could ever hope to, gaining still as its transformation was nearly completed. I thought that was the end for me, that it would be a painful, gory way to go, and then a shot rang out.

My truck wasn’t the only one idling at the drive up to the graveyard. And it certainly wasn’t the nicest, either, compared to the shining thing that’d pulled up beside it. 

My savior laughed a bit at how dumbstruck I must’ve seemed, then told me that I owed them a beer. 

Apparently, they weren’t in the business properly any more, but they’d take odd jobs if a close friend had something that needed taking care of. He had thought he was going to be out of town, but decided to come back a day early to check it out—he’d done a job there before, and the fact something was there again had him worried. He’d arrived just in time to spot me hitting the skinwalker with the shovel, and gotten his rifle out in preparation.

I just smiled as he told me the story, and tried to ignore the fact that his teeth were pointed when he grinned.

Ah, but that doesn’t have anything to do with being an exterminator.

Like the title says, AMA. You can leave a comment or DM me if you want, I have a few days before I plan on going out and returning all my equipment officially, so I’ll probably respond until then, just to give it a time frame. If there are any other exterminators out there, make a throwaway and leave a comment, I don’t meet nearly enough of you as I’d like to, and talk to even less.

EDIT 2: Grammar.

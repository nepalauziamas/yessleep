Hi,my name is James. I need to let something out. I'm scared. Something evil lives in the house. It follows me. It preys on me. And it's getting more violent. 
Let me start from the beginning. In this post I will reveal the first encounter with this evil. I'm thinking of ending it. I don't wanna live like this. I feel helpless and lost. Let me start from the beginning. It all started on the 5th day that I had started live live in our new house. As expected we didn't really have anything to do most days so I would just spend time in my room most the time watching shows.

 I'm also gonna add that I have insomnia. Most nights I only get 1-4 hours of sleep. The days and night before this were normal. And so was that day. Around 12:30 am at night while I was watching a show on Netflix on the little tablet which I used to have when I heard a knock on my door. This was weird. 

Nobody else really had the ability to stay up that long in my family. Well maybe my Dad but he had a less severe case of insomnia and also only went out of his room at around 4:30 to go to work. I just the slightly bit on edge opened the door and saw nothing. I brushed it off as just a noise when a few minutes later I heard another knock at my door. Thinking maybe my brother was doing this I annoyed, walked out of bed, opened the door to my room, walked out, turned, walked towards his room, opened the door, turned on his light, walked towards his bed and then kicked him in the stomach. 

For a minute he held his stomach tightly and groaned and then half shouted "What the Hell was that for?". I then realized how tired and in pain he was and then came to the realization that he actually had been sleeping. Embarrassed, I tried to act tough and justified and said "Logan,were you knocking on my door a minute ago?" He then replied with "No,moron I was sleeping". Angry that he just called me a moron I was about to kick him again when I heard a knocking at my door. The thing was we were both in Logans room.

 Me and Logan shared the same plastered face of confusion. I said to nobody in particular "What the Hell was that?"  "I don't know, how should I know you retarded moron?" I decided not to kick him this time and instead started to decide whether I was gonna go back to my room and tell myself it was just a sound or to stay in my brother's room for the rest of the night.

Whenever I feel concerned,scared or anxious about doing something I feel helpless,lost and weak unless I'm doing it with someone I trust or care about. But I decided to just go back to my room. I turned off Logans light and closed his door and decided to go take a piss in the bathroom before going back to my room. I finished up with my buisness and just payed back in bed to continue watching the show I was watching. Then about 20-25 minutes later  I started to hear footsteps in kitchen. I thought nothing really of it and just told myself it probably just Logan getting a snack from the kitchen and just made a mental note of it's existence before continuing the show. About 15 minutes later I realized that the footsteps didn't stop. 

I paused my show and decided that I was gonna go investigate the noise but as soon as my feet hit the ground it made a noise because the damned floor is hollow or something but as soon as it did I froze waiting for a reaction but as soon as I did this and was standing silently the walking immediately stopped. It was like it had been paused like a tv remote pauses a show. It was instant. Weirded out and honestly a little  scared about this instant pause and the while weirdness of the night. I decided to just sit on my bed and wait in silence for something to happen. About 20 seconds after I did this the footsteps continued.

 Although they were slower and the were approaching the first part of the hallway. About 15 minutes later I could tell it had gone through the 1st part of the hallway and had reached the end of it right before the turn to the second part. I could hear it turn 90Â° and was facing the door to my parents room. It stood there for about 15 seconds before turning the other way, walking towards my brother's room and the just standing there. Just standing. I was starting to panic. I was scared and I felt helpless. I didn't know what this thing was. The fact that I didn't know what was happening or what this was the thing that made me feel weak and helpless. Exposed and unaware to the unknown in my house. Around 2 minutes later it walked to my door and it turned and faced my door. I was in shock.

 In this shock I started to listen in for breathing. I never heard that breathing. About 1 minute later I heard 2 knocks on the door. I wasn't gonna answer this time. I was shaking. Still petrified. And the 5 seconds later another 2 knocks. And then another and then another and then another and then another and then another. Knocks after knocks they became louder more violent. Then they just happened without stop. 

It was banging on my door now. I tried to scream but nothing came out of my mouth. I started to cry. There wasn't any audio because I couldn't speak which made me feel even more weak and scared. I silently sobbed whole the banging got louder and louder until it just stopped. I was still sobbing for a minute or 2 before I realized that it had stopped. I just stood there. Frozen and waiting for something to happen.

 After about 5 minutes of just sitting there I shakily climbed back into bed a began silently sobbing again. Then about 5 minutes later I heard humming. It was ring around the Rosie. I thought it was my dad whistling at first but a couple minutes after I realized it was pacing from my brother's room to my room and then back over and over and over and over. For hours. I heard a laugh every once in a while. It sounded like a male voice I wasn't familiar to. I didn't even know what was happening. I wasn't about to tell my parents this. I would sound crazy. I do sound crazy. It eventually stopped at like 4 or something. But before it went away it laughed before taunting me with its deep man like voice by saying "Nighty Nighty". I sat at the table eating cereal across from my brother in the morning. We both weren't talking. I could tell he was shaken by something too. I looked at him with concern and he just nodded to me. He looked like he was about to cry for the rest of the day. 
I'm only going to write about this encounter for now. Writing it hurts me.

 I still don't understand why this is happening to me. Most of the other stories are so much worse. I'll be ready to share them tonight I think but I don't know. I don't feel safe. 

I just want this to end. One way or another. Has anyone else dealt with this? I'll post my next experience tonight. I'm lost. I'm alone.

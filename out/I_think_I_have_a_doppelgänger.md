I know how this sounds. I probably sound crazy right now, I know as I type this that some of you would think of me as insane, but you have to listen to me. I think Reddit seems like the best social media site to tell my story and not be immediately ignored, I'd probably get some advice in the comments.


I think I am going mad over seeing my own doppelgänger. It all started a month ago, when my coworker told me he saw me at the supermarket the day before, even though I wasn't really there. I thought that maybe he just saw someone who looked like me, a mix-up. It could happen to anyone! We laughed at this and I forgot about it, until three days later.


My mother has always been a very nosy woman. You can't tell her anything without it ending up being heard by everyone else in the neighborhood. So, whenever she starts talking about a rumor, I tend to ignore her. Except now, she was going off about... me?


She said that Laura from two houses down had seen me outside the local coffee shop, kissing an unknown man. I laughed at this, I didn't even like men! My mom, of course, was ecstatic. Her daughter had finally come back to her senses, and was dating a guy. A male from the human species. Not a woman.


I, of course, explained the situation. That couldn't be me. I was, still, a proud lesbian, even if she didn't like it. This led to a fight that could've been avoided, first point to my doppelgänger.


Obviously, I didn't think I had some sort of clone yet, I thought of this as two weird moments that happened coincidentally the same week. But it all started going downhill afterwards. 


The sightings of this, long lost twin? clone?, of mine became frequent. Here she was at the store, at the bookshop, and, the worst of them, kissing that man. The part that weirded me out the most was, I didn't see her. After all these days, I was the only one who hadn't caught a glimpse of this woman who happened to look exactly like me.


I started to become obsessed with her. I even got one of those corkboards with red string, and wrote down every day that she was seen, where, and with who. I lost sleep, I didn't bathe, I didn't even eat. I was living and breathing doppelgänger sightings.


I decided to stake out at the place she was seen the most, outside a small bookshop near my house. I was so tired of her, anyone would've been too. She seemed to be everywhere, and nowhere at once. 


The first time, I didn't see her. I stayed a couple of hours, parked and inside my car. I even brought myself some snacks and bottled water so I could stay, I went to the bathroom at the next door diner. I was focused, I was going to catch her. But I didn't. 


I've been losing so much sleep over this, missing work. I stopped seeing my friends. Sometimes, I wake up and can't remember what I did the day before. There was this one time, when I woke up confused and realized I must've gone out, because my shoes were dirty. I couldn't even remember that. I feel like I am going insane, and this wasn't even the worst part. Last Wednesday, a man came up to me and tried to hug and kiss me, like we knew each other! I started screaming, people turned their heads and came to help out, but he told them it was okay, that I was his girlfriend. The nerve! He even knew my name, which weirded me out so much I ran out to my car and went home. He obviously knows my doppelgänger, not me, and he might even be the man she's dating.


You are probably wondering why I didn't ask anyone I knew to talk to her, get her name or number. The thing is, I did. I told my mom, but she just thinks I am crazy. That I am making up things, hiding a relationship with a man to annoy her or something. She doesn't call me anymore.


Next one was my coworker. He looked at me weirdly at first, but then actually kinda believed me. I told him this might be my twin, which whom I lost contact years ago. A total lie, of course, but he trusted me. Next day, I asked if she told him her name. He looked at me for a second, and then laughed nervously. He thought this was some elaborate joke of mine, pretending I had a twin, but that the last time he saw me I already told him about it. Apparently my doppelgänger knows how to fake being me too.


So that brings us to tonight, when I catched her. I was almost about to fall sleep, when a car came and parked two spots next to mine. A woman came out, and I immediately knew. It was her. I waited a moment, and then I got out.


I didn't even want to talk to her there, I was so pissed off about her pretending to be me, that my first reaction was to hit her in the head with a rock. It was a dark night, no one around, no cameras anywhere. I prepared for this.


I tied her up, got her in the trunk, drove to my house, got her in from the back door. Some cockroaches came running out, I really have to clean.


I tried to talk to her, I really did, but she was just screaming and crying. She had the nerve to claim she wasn't my twin, or my clone, not even my doppelganger. She called me crazy, insane, a looney. She was the crazy one! She was the one who pretended to be me! 


My patience ran out and I hit her in the face. Hard. Felt the sting on my knuckles. She cried more.


Did I always have that mole in my cheek? Maybe she isn't such a perfect doppelgänger like I thought.


Another hit, I was getting tired of her screams. There was a small cut from my ring, and she was bleeding from it.


Damn, were my eyebrows always this uneven? This was like looking at a weird mirror.


Hit three. She was stubborn, I needed her to stop pleading and finally tell me why she was doing this. I was getting tired of her bullshit.


Wait, are my eyes blue instead of green? I noticed that in her, maybe I never noticed after seeing me so many times but looking at her I saw very clearly that her eyes were blue. Weird. I might be going a little bit mad after all.


It kept going, I kept hitting and she kept screaming that she didn't know me, that we didn't even look alike, that I was a crazy woman.


And, honestly, I have to admit it. She really doesn't look that much like me after all.

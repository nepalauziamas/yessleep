1. Early october of last year I had begun to see visions, picture perfect visions of the future that would always turn out to be accurate. At first I had played it off as if it were just my mind thinking of random events that just so happened to come true, until one day I decided to search it up. The phenomenon I've been supposedly experiencing is called "Deja vu" or, " the uncanny sensation you've already experienced something, even when you know you never have." These sorts of visions started to happen more and more frequently until it turned into something happening just aboute every wednesday and friday of every week up until Janurary when I had decided to do something about it. I went searching on the internet for groups of people who have been experiencing this sort of thing and I found such a group named "The futureseekers organization" of course, I decided to check it out. When I joined the forum of this organization I spelled out my problem of these visions happening to me so frequently and I was told that I've unintentionally become a "marked one". It was then explained to me that I had gotten myself entangled with the spirit or concept of what they called "deaths future", someone they worshiped almost as a god. I was told that if I made any decisions to anger this "so called god" then I would be punished for it severly.

2. Fast forward a couple of weeks on from my first interaction with the futureseekers organization and you'll find myself having gotten deeply immersed within this forum. I was told that if I had become a marked one that the only way to avoid punishment was to be able to know the future itself, luckily I was informed that this was actually possible. I had been exchanging messages with a man who went only by "Osiris" he gave me the steps needed to be able to see into the future. I was skeptical of this of course but the stress that the forum had bought me over these few weeks had really pushed me over the edge, I was willing to try just about anything to shake this overwhelming feeling of fear. I was told that I needed to open my future eye in order to see into the future. The steps to do this were to:  


1. \-Obtain a complete state of peace
2. \-Find another "marked one" and give them an approriate punishment
3. \-Reach out to the future and recite a number in your mind (I was told to make this very large number)
4. \-Grab the future and focus it into your forehead

3. If anything went wrong with this then "There would be hell to pay" said osiris. Up until a week ago I had meditaded by myself every day, in my freetime off of work I would try to achieve a complete state of peace. And then last week on wednesday, I felt it, my mind had been completely at peace and I knew for certain I was ready for the next step. I messaged osiris on the forum in the middle of the day to see if he knew of another marked one so that we could possibly help each other out, he informed me that he did know of one that lived in Oregon. "Oregon!?" I thought as that is the place I live, I quickly messaged him back asking for a name. I got a message reply within 20 minutes, the name of the marked one I had to go see was "David L." (I wont disclose his last name for reasons of privacy.) After a quick background check I found out that the car shop he worked at was only 15 minutes away and as it was Wednesday, He shouldn't have been off so I decided to drive there. I decided to bring a knife incase anything went wrong and showed up at his job. As soon as I walked in I saw David there, working on the bottom a car. I walked up to him and tried to discuss the FSO but when I mentioned it he started to freak out. I tried to calm him down but he wouldnt, he started the spasm hysterically and as he did he hit the compartment holding up the car pretty hard and his hand seemed to get caught under the car. All I heard was a loud sort of cracking sound and a scream. I ran out of there as quickly as I possibly could and drove straight home. I thought that even though it was an accident, I had done enough to complete the 2nd step, Although the events of this still weigh on me.

4. Its now friday and I had decided to go on with the 3rd step of this whole process, nearing the end. I started to meditate again in my room and as I did I started to feel that same "deja vu" feeling. Visions began forming infront of me until I saw a radiant hue of color I had never seen before, one that seemed to tell all. There was no mistaking it this was the "future" in a physical form. I quickly remembered that I needed to recite a number so I hurried on and went with my favorite number which is 11. "11, 11, 11, 11, 11" I said and just went on. I could feel it, the future. I reached out and grabbed it, I could feel what was going to happen to me next. I paniced and let it slip through my fingers, Right then felt an overwhelming presence that jolted me out of that calmness. My eyes forced themselves open and what I saw everywhere was horrifying. My room was covered in shadowy figures, smiling at me and chanting "11 days until deaths future." Its been 5 days since then and everything seems so off its like, I can feel it; this so called "deaths future" and its rapidly apporaching.

I led the two of us outside. "Here's the plan, okay?" I said, letting go of her. "You remember where the old house is, right?"

"Barely." she replied, obviously still shaken.

"Okay, look, I want you to follow me in your car, okay? We'll go, grab Dad and get the hell out of there, okay, and we'll call the police or somebody to come out to the place. Anything goes *too* far sideways before then, at least we'll have a backup vehicle." She still just stood there, looking both frightened and confused. I couldn't blame her -- like I said, *I* was JUST AS confused. But I couldn't just sit there, knowing what happened to Uncle Don might happen to Dad as well.

I hopped in my car and turned the engine over. Just before peeling out of there, I rolled down my window and called out to Lana to keep in touch with me over the phone. I then hit the road, going at least 85 miles an hour or more. It was another ten or so minutes before Lana texted me that she was following behind me. It was around 4:30 when I was pulling into the driveway of the old family home once again. Lana arrived just five minutes after.

We got out and slowly made our way to the house. My legs shook with every step and I could see hers were no better.  My mind was stuck. What was I gonna see? was Dad even gonna be alive? Who the hell *was* this guy, even -- still never had any kind of answer for that. What was I gonna do?

Reaching the porch, I attempted to look through the windows again. Still blocked off, just like last time. "Dad?" Lana started calling out. "Dad, where are you?" Silence.

I looked back to the door and began knocking. For about ten seconds, there was nothing. It was quiet, still, just like the last time I was there. Then, however, from the other side of the door, I could hear Uncle Don's voice shout "Come on in, been waitin' for ya!"

Lana froze and looked at me. Her face drained of color, turning it from her natural olive tan to stark white. "I-Is that..." I responded by looking at her, horrified myself, and slowly nodding.

I closed my eyes and took a deep breath before turning the handle and throwing the door open. "Dad!"

Inside the living room was still dark, but at the other end, in the kitchen, I could see the dim glow from a candle. I stepped inside with Lana right behind me. About a foot away from the threshold between the living room and kitchen, I begun to see the dim light illuminate Dad's face. He groaned weakly through a cloth that'd been tied around his mouth and I could faintly see bruises and small cuts all over his face. "Come on and join us at the table, kiddos! We'll sit as one big family!"

A figure, tall and broad shouldered stepped out of the kitchen and took a seat at the table next to Dad.Me and Lana stood at the threshold. "Come on, now," the man said, "I said join us at the table for a family gathering." I exchanged a glance to Lana and back to the table. The man's face was still mostly obscured by darkness. I couldn't make out anything outside of his nose and right eye. Seeing this, though, I was shocked by one big thing. His outline was almost exactly the same as Uncle Don's, including his rounded nose, but his eye was all wrong. It didn't even look human, appearing pupil less and like two deep violet colored marbles were stuck in his face.

Hesitantly, I pulled out a chair at the other end of the table across from him and sat down. Lana stayed standing behind me. "Lana," he said, "What's wrong, don't you wanna take a load off?" She said nothing. He shrugged and said "Suit yourself."

"Who are you?" I asked. I heard him chuckle.

"Boy ain't wasting any time, is he? Well, maybe I'll go ahead and call the others in then." I narrowed my eyes.

*[Others?](https://www.psychotoxin.com/?fbclid=IwAR3-rwRLKgt6B-fF8UHHdPL0307jiuOIW8TzjE7HQ08B1EawDDhWwb-PqtE)*

He turned to the left and cupped his hand to his mouth and called out, "Come on out, y'all. Time we got everybody together." I heard Dad groan through his gag and fidget in his chair. From around the table, I could hear the old wood creak with footsteps approaching the table. I started looking around.

*What the hell? What is that, who's--*

My thoughts abruptly died when I began to make out five other figures in the darkness. Each of them were about my height, one of them being slightly taller and the others being slightly shorter. Except one that is, who was my exact height. Each of them gazed at me from the dark area around the kitchen table at me with dark violet eyes of their own.

"Now the family's all here, ain't that sweet?" jeered Not-Uncle Don. Mine and Lana's jaws hung slack. we were both horrified. "What's the matter, ain't you kids gonna say hello? You shy? They're your own family, for christ sake!" We were silent, speechless. "I can't believe this, how're you kids gonna be *this* rude to your own family. What, you blind? You can't see your own family resemblance?"

The crowd of figures gathered around behind Not-Uncle Don. Squinting, I noticed then how familiar the outlines were. Two of them in particular did most to disturb me. They were of me and Lana!

I could tell because of the way in which, despite still being largely shrouded in darkness, their height and overall outline almost seemed to be a perfect replica of ours. It was like I was somehow locked in a staring match with my own shadow. I could tell the same held true for Lana, too, with her face even more pale than mine. "Take a seat, guys."  Not-Uncle Don told the group of shadows behind him.

They all began to pull out and take seats at the table, with the exception of the ones that looked like me and Lana. They stood at either side of the table. All of them, including Not-Uncle Don, bore down on the two of us with marbled eyes. "Wh-What is this, who are you people?" Lana exclaimed. This time, it was another one that spoke.

"He told you, it's our family gathering." It was a woman's voice, familiar. The voice of someone I knew for a fact was long dead, like grandpa and Uncle Don.

"Ma?" The figure leaned over into the candlelight to illuminate the face of my mother. Her skin looked so young, so fresh and smooth, so *new.* She was 65 when she died just a couple of years before the whole thing with the family Barbecue. Now, though, she had the face of a woman who was *maybe* half that age.

"Well there," she said, grinning psychotically, "It's been a while hasn't it?" My tongue felt dry, the muscles in my jaws locked.

"What do you want? Look, whatever Dad did, please just let him go!" Lana begged.

"Calm down, sweetheart." said another of the shadows, this one's voice deeper. This one, I recognized as Dad's. He also revealed his face through the candlelight, also appearing almost five years younger than the man tied up and gagged at the other end of the table. That was when Lana froze up like how I was. "What's wrong, why don't you give your old man some sugar, huh?" he asked. Lana slowly started backing away.

"Where you runnin' off to?" Not-Uncle Don asked. The shadows of the two of us began to move in on her when I shot out my hand.

"Wait," I said, shooting out my hand. They stopped. "Let her go. I'm here, I'm the one you wanted, remember? Just let her go and you can do whatever you want with me, okay?"

"I said I wanted the whole family here for this, Jack. I wanted y'all to meet the rest of the family; the ones y'all never once tried to speak to or acknowledge."

"What the fuck are you talking about?" From my right, next to Not-Mom, I heard the unmistakable voice of grandpa speak.

"Now I know you kids were raised better than to curse at your own family like that. At the dinner table, too." He, too, then revealed the far younger looking face of my grandfather.

"It's alright, Pops."  Not-Uncle Don said. "Like I said, they wouldn't have known no better. No thanks to this clown right here." He sent a sharp elbow jab into Dad's right shoulder, causing him to groan weakly in pain. His eyes were dim, yet still just as petrified.

"What are you guys talking about?! Look, I don't know who you people are, or why you look like my family, including the people who've been dead for years now, and I don't know why you went and killed my uncle, but you told me to come here; here we are. Now, will you *please* tell me what this is all about?!"

Not-Uncle Don sighed and said, annoyed, "Just can't ever enjoy a family gathering, can you?" He then nodded over to Not-Me and Not-Lana, who then promptly walked over to me and her and took us by the arms.

"Hey, what're you doing?! Get your fucking hands off me!" I tried sending a right hook with my free hand across Not-Me's jaw. It connected, but it did little more than to piss him off and he returned the favor with a hook straight to my stomach. I doubled over, clutching my stomach in pain.

"Now, now, play nice, you two." teased not Uncle Don. I looked up to see Lana struggling against the hold of her own Doppelganger.

"Get off me!" she cried.

"L-Let her go." I said, trying to find my way back up to my feet. I felt not Me snatch the back of my head to force me the rest of the way up before seizing me once again by the arms. Not-Uncle Don then stood up from his chair, jerking Dad up with him and made his way to the area to the right of the dining room. Lana and I were then being pushed along in close pursuit.

We were forced along into the darkened hallway. About eight or nine steps out from the dining room area and I was unable to see anything in front of or around me anymore. I couldn't even see Lana, who'd been pushed along right beside me at my right. From ahead of our little gathering, I heard not Uncle Don call out to us, "We're going down, so watch your step." This was then followed by the sound of a wooden door creaking open. He was leading us down into the basement, I realized.

We were shoved forward, causing me to stumble and almost loose my footing completely. We were now in the basement of the family home, a place that, admittedly, I'd never seen before in my life. I remember how, only on select few occasions, granted, I'd get curious about the old door at the end of the hall leading into the dining room, but each time I'd get close to it, Dad or Uncle Don, one, would usually stop me, telling me that I wasn't to go near that door. I, of course, never understood why, other than "*Because Dad said so*", but now, with what I was faced with in that moment and what I'd see next, I understood more than I wished I would've, as well as why Uncle Don fell out with the family.

Surrounding us now was a dimly lit room, illuminating shelves upon shelves of old, dirty looking books and glass jars with... "Stuff" in them. I won't describe too much here what was in them. Basically, think about any movie you've seen where the people are poking around a psycho-killer's house, all the grisly "trophies" you'd see laying around, hung up or on shelves like they were here. That's basically what this was, only somewhat more disturbing when combined with all the strange symbols that were painted everywhere.

"What is this?" Lana cried, disgusted like I was. She beat me with that question by two seconds.

"The family secret." Not-Uncle Don replied. He turned to Dad and said, "Ain't that right?" Dad grunted in a pitiful attempt at defiance.

"Dad, what is he talking about?" I asked.

"Yeah, why don't you finally spill it, old man?" Not-Uncle Don sneered before rudely ripping out Dad's gag. Dad's head dropped down toward the ground, lolling around like his neck was made of rubber.

"Dad, what's going on? Who the hell are these guys and what are they doing here?" He looked up at me. His eyes were full of fear and exhaustion.

"I told you to get out of here, Jack." he muttered.

"Dad, what's going on?" He exchanged a look between me and Lana, then to Not-Uncle Don, before then looking back to me and sighing.

"The family was desperate, Jack. Times were different back before you kids were born. Your Uncle and I, we were a couple of belligerent morons who, because your grandma and grandpa were always working, were left unsupervised a lot." He paused, sighing heavily.

He likely would've stopped there, if it weren't for Not-Uncle Don telling him to "Go on with it, now."

He glared back and continued. "It was one day, Don and I, we came home to find our folks crying. Said grandpa had just lost his job and owed a lot of people a lot of money and we didn't have any way to pay it off. We were in danger of losing the house. We didn't even have enough to afford much in the way of a decent meal, so me and Don were scared. We knew if we lost the house, Me and Don would be taken from our folks and grandpa would likely be thrown in jail. That night, while in bed, I was praying to God that we wouldn’t lose the house, while Don had another idea.”

He walked over to one of the shelves and took down one of the books. Cracking it open, he then held up a page with weird looking symbols, looking something similar to Asian or even some sort of middle eastern lettering along with a crude drawing of what looked to me like a shadow figure standing side by side, mirroring a normal looking person.

Not-Uncle Don laughed and remarked, “Go on and tell 'em what that is, why don’t you?” Dad hesitated, continuing to glare at him.

“Dad, what is this?” Lana asked.

He turned to her and answered “It’s a guide to summon a Tulpa, a mirror version of yourself.” My eyes bugged out at this.

*Summon?!* My brain was screaming. *He said “summon”!*

I couldn't believe it! For as long as I could remember, my family, my father especially, was a strong Christian. Anything even *remotely* involved with something like this, he'd have had no tolerance for. I mean, for God's sake, that "*Metallica"* poster in my room probably would've been torn down and trashed a long time ago if the old man would've had his way. Now, come to find out he and my uncle were actually *summoning* shit as kids?

Lana had the same thoughts, too. "Dad... What... How could you?" She spoke for the both of us.

Dad was silent again. Not-Lana then piped up, "Aww, give your old man a break, honey. I mean, *come on*, you don't *honestly* think he was always a pious suck-up like he is now, do you?"

"She's right." cheered Not-Uncle Don. "In fact, you were quite the mischievous one back in the day, weren't you?"

"Go to Hell!" he spat back. Not-Uncle Don just snickered. I stood, mouth gaping. Dad, despite his best efforts at defiance, couldn't hide it. He was guilty. Everything that was being said was all true.

"We only wanted to keep the family together." he continued, voice completely devoid of emotion or inflection. "We were afraid, Jack. We thought, using the Tulpas, we'd be able to have someone, a part of the family, with the two of us if the worst came to light."

"And look what happened. It worked. Let's have a round of applause everybody."  The others followed Not-Uncle Don's lead and erupted into a small chorus of applause, with not mom and not grandma whistling.

"You weren't supposed to stay!" Dad exclaimed. Not Uncle Don's smile faltered slightly. "It wasn't supposed to happen like this. You and him," he pointed to the shadowed version of himself, "were supposed to be the only ones! It was just supposed to be you two and *we* were supposed to be the only ones who could see you! We sealed you away when Paw got the new job! You weren't supposed to even still exist!"

Not-Uncle Don turned to me and Lana. "Well, guess I'm not surprised about you two not bein' real "family oriented" after all, huh. You just get to pick and choose who you do and don't consider as family, is that it? Well then, I guess now its *our* turn."

"What're you even talking about? Look, what's the point of all this?" I asked. "What is it you people actually *want* from us?" He looked at me, glaring at me, having dropped his wolfish grin.

"You know how the old saying goes, *"What goes around, comes around."* He nodded over to Not-Dad, who then walked over to dad. "It's about time that *WE* show y'all what its like to have to get locked away in the void."

Not-Dad then effortlessly pried Dad's jaws apart before somehow forcing himself inside of his body. Dad began gasping and choking and his body jerked and convulsed like he was in the middle of a seizure. "Dad!" I wanted to run over to him, but I couldn't wrestle against Not-me's grip on my arms. Dad fell to his knees, seizing on the ground. I could see his eyes roll into the back of his skull.

"What're you doing to him?!" cried Lana.

"Nothing he didn't do to us." Not-Uncle Don replied coldly as he observed Dad's suffering intently.

"You're *killing* him!" I screamed.

"No," he said coldly, "just making him a proper part of the family. He didn't want us to be part of his family, a family of actual people, so instead we're gonna make him a part of ours, whether he likes it or not." Dad's body slowly began to relax before going completely still. Then, his eyes snapped open as he slowly stood up again. His eyes were now the eyes of the other Tulpas.

My eyes grew to the size of serving platters. My mouth went dry and my heart dropped like a stone into the pit of my stomach. I looked at Dad -- now taken over by Not-Dad, and looked over to Not-Uncle Don. I wanted to throw up then, realizing that's what he must've done to Uncle Don that night. I was even more horrified when, only a couple seconds later, Dad's skin began peeling away like a snake molting it's pelt. It stripped and peeled away slowly, revealing another layer of flesh underneath. It was like watching Dad's skin peel away to reveal another him, this one being paler and with the Tulpa eyes.

"Wh-What have you done?!" I cried. This time, Not-Dad replied.

"He just told you, boy, he's now part of us, just like Don. We're complete now, the two of us. Now, it's time to bring you kids properly into the fold." I felt Not-Me's hands start to force me to the ground from behind me. Not-Lana did the same with my sister.

"Maybe *now* we'll have a proper family gather, huh?" Not-Uncle Don said, plastering his deranged grin from before. I tried to struggle, attempting to pry and even bite at Not-Me's fingers but it was no good. His fingers were the equivalent of miniature crow bars as they forced open my mouth. His arm strength was unreal, like what I'd maybe expect from someone double my size and weight. But instead, it was a shadowed version of my lanky, puny muscled self.

Me and Lana were both on our knees, with our Tulpas prying our jaws apart. In one last desperate attempt, I jabbed my thumbs into Not-Me's eyes. Admittedly, I was a bit shocked to see it actually work and I was able to actually free myself. Once Not-Me reeled back in pain, shrieking in a way I'd never heard of before -- a way I wouldn't know how to describe other than to say that it might sound like what you'd imagine like a dragon's roar to sound like; beastial -- I sprang back to my feet and rushed to try and help Lana. I charged and managed to spearhead Not-Lana, sending the both of us to the basement floor.

She began clawing viscously at my face from below me. I could just barely keep her pinned to the floor. "Lana, *RUN!*" I shouted. She stood up, but froze, mouth hanging open in horror. "Damn it, go! NOW! Get out of here, and get the cops!"

"What about--" She was cut off with a scream as I saw out of the corner of my eye, Not-Mom and Not-Grandpa snatch her by the hair from behind. She was sent hurdling to the ground and I was soon overtaken by Not-Lana, who immediately proceeded to smash my face with her fists. I was helpless as blow after blow stoved my face in more and more.

My vision began to fade as I watched the other Tulpas gather around me, watching Not-Lana smash my face in. "Alright, that's enough." Not-Uncle Don said, putting his hand up. "Can't have you gettin' carried away there and killing him, you know?" He looked down at me, grinning even wider, and said, "How would we be able to complete the family then, huh?"

With that, Not-Lana raised back up and stood up. I laid on the ground, surrounded, dazed and bloodied. Not-Uncle Don waved for Not-Me to come closer. "Now, if we're done horsing around, I think it's time to welcome you to the family, Jack." Not-Me leered down at me, his violet eyes sparking from his shadowed form. "What do you think?" he said to Not-Me. Not-Me responded by immediately grabbing and again pulling my upper and lower jaws apart.

I felt a sense of pressure, like something was crushing my throat from the inside as Not-Me began to force himself inside my throat. I began choking and gasping for air, just like Dad did as I spasmed on the ground. My body quickly began to go numb, losing all feeling in every nerve and muscle. I couldn't move anything except to twitch and writhe on the ground. The whole time, the others watched intently with smiles as big as Not-Uncle Don's.

A black cloud quickly formed in the middle of my eyes, shutting me out of my sight completely. Following this, I eventually felt my hearing begin to slip away, too and I soon became almost detached from my body completely. I couldn't feel, experience, or *do* anything. I was little more than a fly on the wall, while Not-Me invaded my body completely, inside and out. Just before I'd be lost for good, though, I faintly saw Not-Mom reel in pain after being struck in the back of the head. Lana stood there, holding the old snow shovel we had down there, even though I never remembered using it.

She quickly took it across Not-Grandpa's face, knocking him over, but was overpowered by Not-Lana. Not-Lana ripped the shovel from her hands and tossed it to the side before sending a powerful right hook across her jaw that knocked her backwards. For whatever reason, I guess out of its own weird sense of attachment or loyalty like how Not-Uncle Don was talking about, this seemed to catch Not-Me's attention, halting him from doing to me the same thing that happened with Dad.

"Don't worry about her." Not-Uncle Don said. "She's a big girl, she'll handle that herself. You focus on doing your part." But it was too late. I began to feel a sense of relief beginning to return in my arms and legs. My Tulpa was losing control, being too focused on Not-Lana. He must've realized this because I could feel him struggle to try and resume the process again, but it was too late by that point. Soon, I felt all of the pressure from a few seconds ago leave my body, out through my throat. Then, there stood Not-Me once again, still in normal Tulpa form.

"Aw, damn it, what're you doing?" exclaimed Not-Uncle Don. "Now look what you've done, you lost him!" I saw Not-Me exchange a quick look at him before re-fixing his sights on me. He dashed forward to try and have at me again, but he wasn't quick enough and I managed to roll over and jump back to my feet before he could get me. I was about to try and bum-rush Not-Lana again, her in the middle of forcing Lana to her knees again and prying her mouth open like how mine was, when I was cut off by Not-Dad. He backhanded me, sending me tumbling to the ground face first.

I looked up to see Not-Lana disappeared, with Lana herself seizing and choking. "Lana!" I shouted. I tried again to make a break for her, only for Not-Me and Not-Uncle Don to cut me off.

"Oh no you don't." Not-Me said. "You're not gonna keep her from us. Besides which, the two of us aren't finished." He went to grab at me again. I dipped to the side, dodging him yet again, before running. He and Not-Uncle Don followed after me in hot pursuit. I didn't look back, but I could hear their eager footsteps thudding behind me. I all but flew up the basement steps before throwing the basement door open and running through. I made it out, but just before I had the chance to slam it shut again, Not-Uncle Don managed to catch it, impeding me from being able to close it. "You can't just run off like that, Jack. We're your family, we'll always be together!"

His voice somehow sounded even more devious when he said this. More psychotic, like a maniac. I didn't say anything, instead responding by thrusting a swift, stiff kick straight in the middle of his chest that sent him tumbling backward down the basement steps. As soon as I did this, I slammed the door to the basement before throwing myself against the door to brace it as a series of violent crashes rocked against the door from the other side. As the knocks got more and more vicious, to the point I was almost afraid they'd actually manage to bash it down from the hinges, I reached for the nearby spare kitchen chair we kept in case we had more company than expected and wedged it in between the door and the knob. It seemed to hold for the most part at first, but I knew they'd be through the door before too much longer even still. That's when I decided to make a break for the front door to my car. I flew out the door and across the front yard to my car, where I then threw into reverse and slammed on the gas, peeling out of the driveway and flying down the street at probably better than 75 or 80 miles per hour.

That whole drive felt like a blur. My mind was on autopilot, with sheer panic having taken the driver's seat. Like I said before, it was at least a 45 minute to an hour drive from the old family house to Dallas, but in that moment, it felt like no time at all had passed before I was driving back into town. When I was able to sort of "come to", I pulled over into the nearest parking lot, at a convenience store, and tried to catch my breath.

My head was pounding, my heart quaking in my chest. It felt so surreal, so unbelievable, so *bizarre*. I couldn't even begin to comprehend what the fuck had just happened and what I'd found out.

Even now, in some ways, I *still* can't really wrap my head around any of it. My father; a quiet, kind, respected and God-fearing Christian man, along with my uncle, brought these things into our world as kids. They thought that, if the home was lost, the family would be lost, too. So they summoned the Tulpas. They brought them here so that, no matter what, the family would always stay together through them; even if they were split apart. But then they tried to get rid of them, and apparently, it didn't work. I don't know how, but my best guess is that they were bound to the house itself in some way. And for years, growing up, neither myself nor Lana ever knew about them because they were trapped in the basement.

Until that night, when Uncle Don went back, possibly to destroy them once and for all. At least, that's what I'm hoping was the reason why he went back. For some reason, though, I can't shake the feeling that Uncle Don may've gone willingly. Allowed himself to be taken willingly. I feel like that might explain the falling out between him and my father. Perhaps Uncle Don wanted to join with the Tulpa, either because of some weird fascination or some sort of desperation, such as being goaded somehow by the Tulpa like I almost was at the house. I don't really know, though.

What I *do* know is, Uncle Don's warning, either way, was genuine. He didn't want me to ever go back; to ever meet the Tulpas. Even if he'd given himself over willingly, he must have wanted it to end with him as well. Unfortunately, I also know that this isn't over after the house. I think a big part of the reason they wanted the three of us that day in the basement was because, while in their normal shadow bodies, they can't leave the old house. But with the bodies of Dad, Uncle Don, and even Lana, now they can.

I won't leave my house anymore after I caught one of them just two days after the incident in the basement walking down the sidewalk. It was Not-Lana, and she spotted me, grinned, and walked away. They're watching me. I've already called the police and talked to them. Fortunately enough, I guess, I managed to convince them to have a patrol pass up and down my neighborhood twice daily to keep on the lookout, but I know that's about as effective (especially against *them*) as tattling on a bully in elementary school.

It's been a few days now since that encounter on the street. I don't know what to do. I don't know how or if it's possible to get rid of them, but I can't go out there until I find out. I feel like its only a matter of time before she or one of the other two who can move from the house find mine and come for me and then...

Then the family will be together again... Forever...

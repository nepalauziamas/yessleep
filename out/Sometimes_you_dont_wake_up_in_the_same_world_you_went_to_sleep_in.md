“Sometimes, when you wake up, you don’t wake up in the same world you went to sleep in.”

I had been asleep, but my cousin Tony’s words woke me, at least a little.  Tony wasn’t stupid, but he wasn’t very fanciful either, and unless he was drunk, he rarely joked or said silly shit.  I glanced over at him questioningly.  He was huddled under a blanket, watching the end of an action movie we’d had on when I started to doze.

“What do you mean?”

He gave a shrug, still focused on the t.v.  “Just that…”  He pointed to the movie.  “Well, just like this.  I remember watching this movie at least fifteen times.  Me and you have watched it several times even, right?”

I felt a twinge of pain in my stomach and shifted into a more upright sitting position with a grunt.  “Yeah?  I mean sure.”

Tony nodded.  “Yeah.  But see, this isn’t ending the way I remember.  Like it should have him killing the dude with his bare hands in the museum.  Instead, he just shot the guy in the head, and I don’t think they ever went back to the museum at all.”

I frowned at him.  “Dude, this is how that movie has always been.  I think you’re thinking of something else.”

He turned to me then, his eyes wide and serious.  “You sound like me the first few times it happened.  I’d see something different or wrong and think it was…what’s it called?  The Manson Effect?”

“The Mandela Effect.”

He nodded.  “Yeah, that.  Or that’s what they call it here.”

I was more awake now, but it felt like I was in a dream.  “So what, you think you’re in some alternate reality?”

His expression was worried and sad.  “I know I am.  I may go back to mine when I wake up next time, but every time it happens I think about it more, and the more I think about it, the more I wind up waking up other places.”

Squinting, I leaned forward.  “Are you high?”

He shook his head.   “Nope.  Usually I know now because I keep a selfie on my phone of me holding up two fingers.  If I wake up and I look different, or am holding up a different number of fingers, or the picture isn’t there at all, I know I’m in a different world, however close it is to mine.  I thought I was home when I woke up today.  Picture was the same and everything.”

“So what changed your mind?”

“When I went to the store earlier, the brands seemed weird.  And this movie, of course.  But the big thing…”  His lower lip trembled and I was surprised to see his eyes were shining.  “The big thing was when I realized you didn’t have any spiders inside you.”

I felt my scalp prickle as my stomach gave another painful twinge.  “What?”

Tony frowned.  “The spiders.  I went to do our night-time communion and when my spiders crawled down your throat, they said you were empty.  They’re fixing that now, and I pray to the Web that I’m here to see you made complete.”

I went to say something else when a terrible burning pain cut through my torso, doubling me over as I slid to the floor.  A moment later, I felt Tony’s comforting hand rubbing my back.  

“It’s okay.  I was a baby when I first got mine.  They say it hurts a lot, but you’ll make it through.”

Gasping between spasms of agony, I looked up at him.  “What’s happening to me?”

Tony let out a sigh.  “They just have to move stuff around a little.  To make room.”

“R-room?”

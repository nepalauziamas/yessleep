January 17th 2003

My mom hooked up with some random person. She was a s3x worker and she did this a lot. But this time, something went wrong.




December 23rd 2003
I was born, and ever since that day, my mom hated me. She's went from beating me to kicking me out the house for days or even weeks. She threatened to mutilate me and put it on a video more times than I could even count.



That was all until one very fateful day.
It's November 14th, 2019 in the quiet suburbs of Yonkers, New York. You can hear the raking of leaves, the crunching from the people walking to the Dunkin', and the birds flocking to migrate for the winter. This was set to be a normal day for me but for some reason, my mom was more pissed than normal. She threatened to beat me more times than usual. Something had angered her, but I ignored it.



I walked to school not knowing what would be waiting for me when I made it home.
"Dude can you come over tommorow?" My friend told me.
"I'll check with my mom, you know how over protective she is of me bro."
"Sounds like a plan?
"I mean if my mom agrees I guess?" I exclaimed with a slightly monotone expression in my voice.
Tick Tock, I watched the clock speed as my day went by. 


Eventually it hit 3:15 and we were out of school. I walked home wondering what I was going to be fed, maybe a tv dinner if I'm lucky.



I arrived home to my mom screaming her lungs off yelling at me to come over to her. She shouted "I didn't give birth to you JUST FOR YOU TO SPEND 50 DOLLARS ON SOME ONLINE SHIT?!"
"What I didn't do any of that what makes you say that?"
"I got the BANK STATEMENT, do you think that the bank is going to FUCKING LIE TO ME?"
"I mean what if someone h-hacked your ac-"
"You're a MISTAKE and you don't even help me with my taxes anymore..."
Seconds after she said that she pulled a butcher knife from under her pillow and flung it at me, I narrowly dodged it and rushed out the room at flash speeds.
"Don't you dare run from me TOMMY!"
I quickly turned the corner into the living room and pulled out the plug on the lamp and waited for her to turn the corner.
"I'm going to fucking KILL YO-"
I threw the lamp at her with full force, knocking her out.
Realising what I just did, I grabbed the butcher knife, threw it at the wall in a fit, crouched down, grabbed my phone and dialed 911




"911 what is your emergency?"



"My mom chased me with a butcher knife and I knocked her out with a lamp."



"Alright sir, step away from her, grab the knife, put it somewhere safe and run out the house."



"Okay"


4 minutes pass by



"The adress is 100 Treelog Blvd, please just come, I am scared shes gonna wake up.."




15 minutes later, the police arrived and they take my mom in. I was weirded out by this situation and I was very moved. Although my mom is evil, she is still my mom.



3 Years Later...


I'm doing well financially and every couple of months this story pops up in the back of my head, I decided to share it because I guess it's something worth sharing.
If you are wondering what happened to my dad, he was arrested after he tried killing me, but that's a story for another time...

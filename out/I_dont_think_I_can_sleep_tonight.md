So, for some context, I've been having this reoccurring dream for the past few months or so, however it got so much worse...


I don't often dream, so I was really surprised when I did the first time this happened. The dream is I'm in some sort of hotel it seems, and there's an open elevator in front of me. I go inside the elevator, but there's no buttons and the light isn't on, however the door always closes immediately and I can feel that the elevator is moving, but I can never tell if it's going up or down. I'm just stuck standing there in complete darkness.

However, a few days ago I decided to wander around the hotel instead. It just seemed like a normal hotel, the only strange thing about was that it was completely empty, but I didn't think anything of it. I wandered around for a little while before finding a room with the door wide open, all the other doors were closed, I don't remember the room number, but curiosity got the best of me and I took a peak inside. It was like something out of a horror movie in there. There were scratches/claw marks all over the wall, everything had been thrown to the ground and broken, the bed was a complete mess, and just above the bed was writing on the wall. I don't know if it was paint or blood, but it was red, it read

"You broke the cycle"

Or something along the lines of that. I woke up shortly after I saw the writing. Then, I went back to not dreaming the next few days, and I thought everything was fine, I'm not going to have that dream again. I was so wrong...

Last night I went to bed, again, not expecting to dream. So, naturally, I was surprised when I found myself in the hotel again, remembering what happened last time, I decided to just go into the elevator. The dream seemed perfectly normal, no buttons, no light, etc.

But then, the light suddenly flickered on, it seemed the lights were bleeding or something, the elevator felt like it was moving faster, but I still couldn't tell which direction I was going. A few shadowy figured that seemed vaguely familiar appeared in front of me, their voices were extremely distorted, but I could just barely hear them saying

"You broke the cycle"

They just kept repeating that, after a few moments, I woke up in a cold sweat...And I haven't been able to go to sleep or even just close my eyes without seeing that image of the shadowy figures, the blood on the walls...I don't know how long it will be before I feel safe enough time fall back asleep, but right now, I'm still incredibly shaken up.

It know this isn't as bizzare/creepy as some of the other posts I've seen here, but I need to tell someone otherwise I think I'll go insane.

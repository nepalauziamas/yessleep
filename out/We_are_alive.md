t’s 7pm right now. Some really weird shit is going on right now in the storm outside and I don’t want to die without having some last words. Mom, Dad, Harper, Missy, I love all of you.

UPDATE 1: Ok, that last post was kind of a joke. Some weird shit is going on outside yeah but I’m probably not going to die. I’m kind of doing this as a joke. I was just taking my dog Missy outside and I felt like I was about to die. Also about that weird shit. I have been hearing weird noises like howls and what might have been screams outside. Pretty sure everything is fine tho

UPDATE 2: What the fuck. Someone is outside. There is just this person standing in the middle of the fucking road. I had to put Missy in the basement because she was practically screaming at the door. My sister Harper said it was probably some crackhead taking a shower. Idk. This isn’t even funny anymore. I’m watching tv in the basement with missy right now with a kitchen knife. If I die home alone because some serial killer was horny I’m going to be pissed.

UPDATE 3: That person is still outside. I went upstairs to get some snacks and water. Missy came up with me but she isn’t barking anymore. She looks scared. Harper looked a bit nervous too. I caught her checking the locks to the doors. The lights are starting to flicker slightly every few minutes. I’m charging my phone right now. 

UPDATE 4: the power went out. Because of course it did. I nearly pissed my pants. The lights started flickering like crazy, like something out of stranger things and then they just shut off. Oh my god. Somebody's knocking on the door.

UPDATE 5: Crisis averted. Some weirdo kids thought it was a good idea to be selling cookies in the middle of a storm. Luckily the lights came back on. The person outside is gone too. Maybe it was just some crackhead like Harper said. I’m not stupid though. I’m keeping my knife with me and I’m staying in the basement. There is a little window I can crawl out of if some monster wants to try anything. 

UPDATE 6: I moved base up to my room upstairs on the top floor. 

The door just opened

Someone is in the house

UPDATE 7: My calls aren’t working. Harper is with me. We’re hiding in the closet. I’m sorry. If I did something to deserve this. If this is my punishment for something I did. Missy was too big to go in the closet with us. A few minutes ago I heard her cry out downstairs. She didn’t deserve this. I don’t deserve this. I don’t want to die. 

UPDATE 8: We’re going downstairs. Harper has a bat and I have my knife. We are going to live. We can fight whoever is down there. They haven’t come upstairs yet but I can hear them wandering downstairs. I’m scared. But I’m more scared of what happens if we don’t do anything. 

That’s not a fucking person. It has her. It got Harper. She is crying. She is trying to scream. Her eyes are white. It backed me into a corner. I don’t know why it isn’t killing me. Does it even know I’m here. 

It’s looking at me. Harper isn’t moving. Why isn’t it doing anything. It’s just looking at me. I lov








UPDATE: A beast from the stars under the Himalayas, a rotting woman in the snow, eyes that watch from flame, hungry whispers in the woods. More. You don’t see because you don’t look. I know how to look now. Me and Harper are in the hospital. Mom took us here and dad took missy. He said that she had broken leg and some gashes on her side but she was going to be ok. This is not my final update. I know things I’m not meant to know. They are everywhere

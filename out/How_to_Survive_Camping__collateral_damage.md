I run a private campground.  Now, it seems some of you are frantic after [my last post](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/ksw812/how_to_survive_camping_its_irish_history_time_and/) so I’ll just give you an update on that and get it out of the way.  The truth is… I hate all my options right now (the dancers were like nope, not our expertise, good luck with that) and am procrastinating acting on them.  It’s fine.  I’m fine.  The fairy said I have time.  It’s probably just nerves.  I’m trying not to think about it every time I have to cough.  So to keep my mind off my current problems, I’m going to talk about something other than the fomorian situation.

Anyway, if you’re new here, you should really [start at the beginning](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/clp5h4/how_to_survive_camping/) and if you’re totally lost, [this might help](https://www.reddit.com/r/goatvalleycampgrounds/comments/fz6a1d/how_to_survive_camping_index/).

Around here, disobeying a rule typically gets you killed.  *Insulting* one of these inhuman things, however, has collateral damage.  The extent of it will depend on the severity of the offense and the disposition of the insulted creature.  As I’ve talked about before, the fairy’s vengeance is the most devastating and is not limited to the campground’s boundaries.  However, none of these creatures are content with a single victim when seeking redress.

None of them.

I’m going to use rule #9 to elaborate on this.  I have quite a few options to choose from - including Beau - but from the comments I feel everyone would appreciate learning more about the thing in the dark.

Rule #9 - Keep track of what time the charge on the solar lights typically runs out. If the solars go out before then, do not leave your tent until sunup. Do not open the tent, not even to look. Stay in your tent, try to sleep, and wait for daybreak.

I have no way to know for certain what the offense was.  We already know that merely looking at the thing in the dark is cause for it to swallow you whole, doomed to forever wander the tunnels of its body until the heart calls you to your final death.  What kind of offense could you give to such a creature that would cause it to seek even greater retaliation?

I wasn’t as strict on disallowing camping near the mound in the past, as people aren’t crammed in so tight as they are at the big event when I put the senior camp there.  I figured people would naturally stay away from the foreboding mound of debris and mostly they did.  When the thing in the dark arose with fury, I could only assume they camped too close and did something dumb.  Maybe shined a spotlight on its face or something.

But after this past year, I think I have a plausible theory.

I bet they used branches from its body as firewood.

It’s in the camp rules to not use wood from around the camp for fires, specifically so they don’t offend something inadvertently and also so our local firewood suppliers get some good business throughout the year.  But we’ve all seen how well people follow the rules.

I think this year I’ll spray paint the plants around the mound magenta so people think it's surrounded by poison ivy.  Use some other behavioral pressure to get them to follow the rules, since we all should know by now that structural incentives are wildly ineffective.

We saw that when a certain *someone* (I swear to god you better not be reading these still, I’m angry just at the thought of it) threw holy water at the children with no wagon.  He *knew the rules* and still did something terribly offensive.

There is a priority in which these creatures take their vengeance.  The first to die is the offender and those associated with them.  The order in which those two groups are targeted depends on the maliciousness of the wronged party.  The dancers, for instance, prefer to take the offender last, after they’ve seen the sort of fate that awaits them from watching the demise of their friends.

If this is not enough to sate the creature’s rage - or if their preferred target has luckily left the campground already - then they turn their anger against my staff.

They are representatives of my campground, after all.  In a sense that matters only to the creatures here, they belong to me.  The campers are my “guests'' and a failure on their part reflects badly on myself.  Not enough to warrant my death necessarily - although I’ve personally had some unpleasant encounters in the past because of people doing something offensive - but my staff are considered of lesser importance.  Disposable.  And they’re used to send a message.

Their deaths tell me that one of these inhuman things is angry and I am to blame.

In the human world, our leaders certainly do a good job dodging responsibility even for heinous actions they’ve themselves committed.  The inhuman world is not so lenient and it has the power to enforce consequences.

I’m sure some of you are thinking, dang, must be sweet to be an inhuman thing.  There’s certainly some assholes that have pissed me off that *I’d* like to take to task.  But look - you know those “you can only take this one thing to a deserted island” memes?  This is “you can only eat this one thing until the heat death of the universe” and you might want to think long and hard on how raw liver ripped from a screaming victim would taste after 5,000 years of it.

The night the offense was committed, I dreamed of my death at the jaws of the beast.  I fled from it down a narrow corridor of which I could not see the walls or the floor, but I knew they were there nonetheless.  Behind me the beast approached, its jaw stretching wide, swallowing up everything in my wake until it felt as immense as the ocean.  I felt the world tilting, my feet slipped for want of purchase, and then I fell into the beast’s gaping mouth.  Its throat glowed like embers and I felt the heat as I tumbled down, into that white-hot heart of light, and I heard the screams of people I thought I knew as I fell.

Then I woke in a cold sweat.  It was past dawn.  I’d slept through my alarm.

I knew all too well what such a nightmare meant.  Someone had vanished and the thing in the dark was to blame.  I hurried down to the staff break room to intercept the handful arriving for the shift change.

What they told me as they arrived was alarming.  They, too, had nightmares about the death they feared.  I uneasily assumed it was due to their daily proximity to the campground.  Perhaps that created some tie, tenuous, but enough that the campground could leak into their dreams.  After all, the thing in the dark only troubles the dreams of those asleep *on* my land.  That’s how it’s always been.

I’ve seen that the campground… leaks… now.  It is not a perfect prison.  Perhaps the thing in the dark’s rage was simply that great.

The day passed uneventfully.  I learned who vanished in the night because my staff found an abandoned campground.  They watched over it, checking in throughout the day to confirm it was truly empty.  The tents were made up with all their belongings inside.  The coolers were still full of food and beer.  It was like they’d all simply gotten up and walked away and never came back.

They were swallowed up without even a struggle.  All of them.

I decided we would take down their tents and pack up their belongings the next day.  Some of them had left wallets in their tents instead of having them on their person and these we turned over to the local police.  None of us would go searching for their relatives, of course.  But better that the police knew their names if anyone came calling for answers.

It didn’t occur to me at that point that the thing in the dark had been wronged.  There was another, more palatable, explanation at hand.  This entire camp had looked at the thing in the dark and been swallowed up at once.  Perhaps they were sitting around a campfire - for there were the remains of a fire pit - late at night and the firelight vanished and instead of closing their eyes, they all turned around to look like deer in the road.

I didn’t know of many instances of the thing in the dark taking multiple people at once, so I theorized that this was the reason behind the extended reach of the nightmares.  It echoed more strongly this time, touching those closely associated with the campground even though they weren’t on my land.

I told my staff to be a bit more careful and to let me know if they found anything unusual.  That was all.

When I’m wrong, people die.  It’s easier to bear when someone else is at fault.  I can point to their mistakes and say look - see - that isn’t me this time.  This is what they did wrong.  It’s *deserved*.  Right or wrong, that’s how I looked at it for a long time.  It made the job easier.  I’m still not sure if I’m willing to shoulder the blame for this one.  Yes, my theory was wrong.  But it’s not like the thing in the dark made it apparent that it was angered.  Beau didn’t drop by to warn me, as he’s done before.  It was just me, piecing together the clues as best as I could.

But deserving or not, the thing in the dark held me responsible for the actions of the campers.  They always do.

I got up the next morning to find one of my overnight staff dead on my front porch.  He’d been methodically disassembled.  His body had been opened up, the flaps of skin and muscle neatly pulled open for dissection, and his organs had been removed and set aside.  They were still connected, the veins unraveling like yarn, grouped close to the body so that everything remained intact.

He hadn’t succumbed immediately.  There wasn’t much blood.  Some of the organs were disturbed, though.  Instead of being laid out neatly, they were positioned closer to the body, and one hand lay draped close to the heart, as if it’d slid off shortly after death.  He’d been left alive, desperately trying to scoop his organs back into his body, before dying of shock.

I called my uncle for help.  My great-aunt’s death has always weighed heavily on me and I couldn’t bear disposing of the body alone.  We worked together in stoic silence, piling the organs back into the hollowed out shell and hiding it beneath a blanket before any campers could wander past the house.  The police came and discreetly took the body away.

“This isn’t like the people with no faces,” my uncle said grimly, after our morbid task was done.  “Well, it’s not like them to leave it on your front porch, at least.”

“The man with the skull cup could have done it.”

“You don’t sound convinced.”

I took a deep drink of my coffee.  It wasn’t creamer I’d added to it.

“Can you talk to his girlfriend for me?” I asked.  “Find out which creature on the campground he feared the most.”

My uncle did.  Or rather, he sent my aunt to talk to her.  She reported back that my employee had most feared the people with no faces.  He’d never had a run-in with them and he hoped he never would.  Their scalpels and their deliberate precision terrified him, worse than a creature that would rend and tear like a mindless beast.  Their careful intent was far more sinister than something that merely wanted a meal.

The thing in the dark wasn’t merely showing us in our dreams what death we feared the most.  It was enacting it now, upon my staff, and leaving the results at my doorstep.

I was at a loss on how to appease it or if it even *could* be appeased.  But nor would I simply stand by and let it murder my staff with impunity.  They knew they were potential targets.  It was part of the job and why I pay so much  more than everyone else around here.  For the locals, this is one of the better jobs around, short of owning your own business.  However, this was an extreme circumstance, as all of us knew the thing in the dark was not something that could be escaped or reasoned with.

It was like a force of nature and screaming defiance at a storm does nothing to halt its advance.

So I closed the campground.  If we couldn’t appease the thing in the dark, we’d wait it out.  Let it helplessly expend its anger in whatever manner it chose - so long as it didn’t have human prey within reach.

I evacuated the campground of campers.  Fortunately, luck was on my side, and I had an easy excuse that people were more than willing to accept.  It had been raining that week.  A LOT of rain.  The handful of campers that remained on site were already planning to leave, as the forecast predicted it would keep raining for another few days.  I sent my staff around to tell everyone there was concern about flooding (there wasn’t) and we were asking everyone to leave as a precaution.  They even offered to help people pack up, to ensure they got off the grounds before sundown.  I offered partial refunds, but they had to come to the camp office and claim them in person.  I hoped that the rain had worn down their wills to the point that few would bother with the extra effort, and my hunch paid off - literally.  Few claimed the refund.

Look, I *do* run a business here.

Then I sent the staff home.  I stocked up on groceries and warned my relatives that live on the land to do the same.  We’d wait it out.  I was confident in the security of our houses, as the main house was never touched (except by the little girl and the beast) and my relatives house’s had the visitor’s blessing (rule #1) and other protections.  I locked the gates, cancelled any outstanding reservations that hadn’t already been cancelled due to the coming week’s weather forecast, and hunkered down to wait for the worst.

I kept the blinds drawn so I didn’t inadvertently look outside at the thing in the dark, in case it passed near to the house.  No sense in angering it further.  I could hear the little girl though and her weeping was close by, as she stayed huddled up against the wall of the house throughout the long night.  Around one in the morning my aunt called me to say she’d heard a loud noise passing by, like a gale, but she hadn’t looked and it’d moved on.

I waited through the night, too uneasy to sleep.  I might have dozed off a little between two AM and four AM, but it wasn’t a real sleep.  I just lay in my bed, hardly covered by the blankets, and nodded off for snippets at a time.

I was waiting to see if the thing in the dark came by my house, carrying its anger in its shadow.

An hour before dawn I heard a noise that made me sit bolt-upright.  Something like the scream of a wildcat, but deeper, and far louder.  An unnatural sound that had the snapping of trees as an undertone.  A cry of rage - and despair, I thought - that made my heart ache for reasons I couldn’t understand.

I think… looking back… the thing in the dark wasn’t merely angry.  It was mourning the loss of itself, screaming its pain because it had no other way to make us understand.

And as soon as that unearthly sound stopped, a rumbling took over.  The ground itself was shaking.  My breath caught in my throat as the ground shifted, trembling from the force of the thing’s scream, and my bed began to rattle in place.  Bookcases in my library toppled over, spilling their contents all over the floor.  Pictures fell from the walls, spewing shattered glass as they hit.  A cacophony of breaking dishes echoed from my kitchen as the plates and glasses slid out of the cabinets, drowning out all other noise.  I cowered in my bed, pressing myself into the mattress and hoping nothing fell on me and that the house didn’t collapse.  Then the rumbling was gone and the only sound was the rain outside, the little girl’s crying, and the groan of the house as it settled back down on its foundation.

I called my aunt with shaking hands.  They’d experienced the same thing.  I checked on my other relatives and they all had the same story.  A scream and then an earthquake.  I called some people outside the campground, checking on my staff, and while none of them had nearly the level of destruction I had, their houses were similarly affected.  No one was hurt at least.

Now, this was some time ago, so the old sheriff hadn’t been swallowed up by the vanishing house yet.  He drove by to check on the campground the next morning, asking if we’d had any damage from the earthquake.  I said that I was still checking the buildings, but so far we appeared to be unscathed.  I didn’t say that was because our houses are protected against unnatural things and this was certainly an unnatural earthquake.

The old sheriff told me there’d been a few buildings in town that suffered minor damage.  He and the local officers were still making the rounds to check on the remote houses in the surrounding forest and fields.

“Damned strange,” he said, scratching the back of his head.  “Didn’t think we got earthquakes out here.”

Very strange, I agreed.  As much as I like the old sheriff, he is an honest man where the town is concerned, and I didn’t want their animosity once they found out that the thing in the dark could reach out beyond the confines of the campground, in a sense.  They leave my family in peace so long as I keep these creatures contained and their wallets full.

I kept the campground shut down for a full week and when there were no further disturbances, I tentatively called my staff back.  Volunteer basis at first, with a hefty bonus as an incentive.  A few took the offer and when they survived the night, I felt confident enough to re-open the campground.  The thing in the dark remained in its lair, its anger spent in that last helpless cry.

I run a private campground.  I’ve always had a healthy level of respect for the thing in the dark.  Of all the creatures on my land, I consider it one of the more benevolent ones.  It doesn’t actively seek people out to harm them, after all.  It just wants to be left alone.  But now, when I think back on that scream it uttered, at how it made my chest ache with a yearning that was not my own, I feel something else towards it.  I think of what it said to me.  How it isn’t whole.

And I pity it. [\[x\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/goatvalleycampgrounds)

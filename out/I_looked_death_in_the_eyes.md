This happened last night and it terrified me to my core.

I am in my late twenties and I am married to my wonderful wife who is in her mid twenties.
We have a 7 month old son together and and he is a little angel.

Unfortunately, our son had been a little sick lately and because of this he was restless the last couple of nights, so we didn’t get much sleep either. 
This has been particularly hard on my wife, because she has a lot of thing going on in her family and at work. 
I often get around this because my job has multiple shifts and while I usually work the day and evening shift, lately I have been working the evening and night shift. 
This means that when I get home my son is either already asleep or waking up for the day.

Yesterday I worked the day and evening shift, but I came home from work late and my wife and son were already asleep. 
As I had not eaten anything yet, I went to the kitchen to make a bowl of cereal and sat behind the computer to watch some episodes of a show I’ve been enjoying lately.

I was really enjoying myself and I have to admit that I lost track of time. When I looked up at my clock, I saw it was already 2am and I could already imagine how angry my wife would be in the morning. After feeling sorry for myself for a little bit, I got up to go to bed, but when I was about to turn off the lights I noticed I still had my bowl of cereal standing on my desk.
Sinc I am an amazing husband, I decided to spoil my wife by doing the bare-minimum and put the bowl in the dishwasher.
So I walked back to my desk, grabbed the bowl and headed for the kitchen.

As I am making my way across the marble floor towards my kitchen, I passed the stairs.
At that moment I noticed something out of the corner of my eye: My spoon. It was balancing on the edge of the bowl. Before I could even react, it fell to the ground and the metal hitting the marble echoed through the house. 

It wasn’t long before my son started crying and that’s when I heard it.
Heavy footsteps coming from our masterbedroom upstairs. Gaining speed with every step. As they kept coming closer and closer, I froze in fear. They weren’t heading for our son’s room, they were heading towards me. I heard them pass our son’s room and making their way to top of the stairs. 
But they didn’t slow down. With the same momentum I heard the footsteps were coming down the stairs.
I gathered every ounce of bravery within me and decided to look up. And that’s when I saw it.
Red bloodshot eyes, a messy bun and a face that would give the devil himself nightmares, coming straight at me.

The Diary of John Lewis, April 16, 1820:

*I can tell the end is close now, and God’s truth is that I’d rather the story that follows remain a mystery. But for you, Winston, I feel a father’s duty to describe the curse that is about to befall you. Though the words you are about to read may bend the imagination, I beg you, do not take them as the ramblings of a feeble-minded old man, for I assure you they are His Truth.*

*Though I took possession of the family home in Virginia upon my mother’s passing on Christmas, in the year of our Lord 1800, it was several years before I found the Clock. In truth, I suspect, I had spent much of my life trying not to find it, as my mother had made great pains to keep it sealed, paying a premium to a local mason who worked with discretion as he built what might have looked like a chimney to the careless eye.*

*Thus the accursed clock may have well stayed if not for an unwelcome visit from the Other Side. Indeed, I returned from a buying trip in town to hear an ungodly racket emanating from above. Then, lantern in hand, I ascended into that dusty place and witnessed a most peculiar site: it was a local boy, Ben Hardy, poking his head through from the wall’s far side.*

*Of course, this apparition seemed near impossible, as the wall’s other side consisted of nothing, save thin air.*

*“Boy!” I shouted, cease this immediately and state your purpose here, to which he responded that it was I who had hired him to do this very thing! When I assured him he was speaking nonsense, he called me a stingy old bastard, at which point I retreated downstairs to retrieve my musket.*

*By the time I returned, Ben was gone, leaving only the hole in the brick and various debris cluttering my attic! Through the hole in the bricks, I saw the clock for the first time. One could not condemn its craftsmanship, for the marvels of its wood inlay put even the Shakers to shame. With the passing years, I have come to identify this artistry as that of the Devil himself.*

*Perhaps a wiser man might have restored the bricks to their original condition, but if I am guilty of any sin, it is the Devil’s curiosity. Indeed, I took the next few hours, removing the remaining bricks, and examining the clock, whose craftsmanship even exceeded my first assessment. My next thought, was to sell the clock, both repeating a financial reward and protecting the house from any Witchcraft.*

*In town to meet an antique dealer, I ran into no other than Ben Hardy himself, who I grabbed by the ear and demanded an explanation regarding his recent trespass onto my estate. The boy, eyes wide, so vehemently denied any such intrusion that I was apt to believe him, despite what my eyes had seen. I released him, and he scampered away.*

*Finding a local antiques dealer, I elicited great interest in my discovery, so much so that he immediately accompanied me back to the house. There, he took great interest in the clock, fawning over its fine woodcraft and steady sound, though puzzled by the fact that both hands pointed permanently at Five. We spent the better part of an hour searching for any sort of door or hinge that may unlock the clock’s mechanical interior but found our efforts thwarted. He promised to return, and departed.*

*I might have had him back, except for the dreadful thing that followed.*

*I awoke the night to a considerable thumping from above. Musket ready, I ascended to the attic, ready to fire for the first time since the days of King George. But the weapon proved fully unnecessary. What I found above was already dead.*

*There, on the attic floor, was a large cloth sack, half-soaked red and brown with drying blood. Inside was Ben, all cut to pieces and neatly stacked within the bag. Body at the bottom, then limbs, and finally head in a sort of pyramid.*

*I vomited and retreated downstairs, rousing your mother. Our first instinct, of course, was to alert the constable, but she quickly reminded me of my earlier altercation with Ben, and the suspicion that would be cast on me. Without long before dawn, we agreed to cast the sack and all its contents into a recently dug hole, originally intended as a garden bed.*

*I slept not a wink, but found it necessary to return to town on some business in the morning. Imagine my surprise, then, without a wink of sleep, when I came across Ben Hardy at the local pub, half drunk and complaining of my earlier assault to any who would hear!*

*Forgetting my business, I made haste for home, where I dug up the dirt I’d hastily thrown upon Ben’s corpse and found the bag very much still full of Ben’s dismembered corpse!*

*Then, before I might even make sense of the current situation, I heard a scream escape the house and ran inside to find your mother in hysterics. She pointed up to the attic and begged me to seal the door, for the Devil himself had visited us. You, of course, were but a baby of three months then, but even you ceased your crying as if aware of the dire matter at hand.*

*Armed with both gun and the pocket knife given to me by my own dear father, I ascended the stairs to the attic and found two bags. They contained you and your mother, both cut cleanly into pyramids, like Ben before you. Oh, how I howled in torment at the sight, especially at that of you, so small in your tiny, soaking bag.*

*Then, I descended, to find your mother, your living mother, screaming uncontrollably, holding your firm to her breast.*

*Your mother refused to spend another night in that accursed house. Taking you, she traveled back to Pennsylvania to visit your maternal grandparents at their family estate.*

*As for me, I stayed behind. I brought a chair up to the attic and waited to discover the author of my tragedy.*

*On the third night, I woke from half-sleep to see a fresh sack thud to the ground, materializing before the Infernal Clock. With it, out stepped a man in grey attire, save for a black mask that covered his visage.*

*I reached for my musket, but he was too quick. He crossed the room in seconds, and slashed at my hand with a pocket knife, disarming me. Then, as if reading my mind, he kicked my other hand as I reached for my own knife, sending the weapon skittering across the floor.*

Inscrutable\*, he looked down at me, holding my bleeding fingers.\*

*“Why have you cursed me, foul spirit?” I demanded.*

*He didn’t respond but merely gestured to the bag. Slowly, I crawled to it and pulled at the rope that knotted it closed. The burlap opened to reveal my own corpse.*

*“So you are Death himself then?” I inquired. “I say then, fine! Come do your worst! My soul is pure! Take me to My Eternal Lord!”*

*But the figure shook its head.*

*“You are not ready yet, Five,” said the figure. “You still have too much to lose. But don’t worry. I will return.”*

*And with that, he turned back to the clock. Reaching it, he stabbed his knife directly into the center of its face. A blue light filled the room, like that of a full moon. Then he was gone.*

*That very night, I burned the whole house to the ground and left for Pennsylvania. As you know, we are settled here now, in the house I built upon my return.*

*What you may not know, is that shortly upon completion of the house, I made an unsettling discovery in the attic. There, resting in the corner as if it had been here all along, was the Clock, ticking and tocking its regular rhythm. And there it has stayed ever since.*

*Until last night, your wedding night. When I awoke to hear familiar thumps in the attic.*

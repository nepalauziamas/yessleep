One thing I didn’t mention before, because it sounds crazy, is that before I felt it next to my feet I heard it when it was on the floor and I can just assume it jumped because of the sound I heard. But it didn’t land right away and I can almost swear I heard wings flutter, I know how it sounds but, trust me, but hear me out please, and maybe you can help me find out what that thing is.

In my last post of this story I mentioned I was going to see a tarotist, that’s why I’m mentioning this now because of what she told me. I’m not sure if it’s true but here it goes, according to her that thing was a gargoyle, she said that because of my mental state my energy was really weak and this creature was trying to feed off it by attacking me. Because of what I heard that day it kinda makes sense but I did a little research and gargoyles are supposed to be protectors and to ward off evil spirits, so was it or was it not a gargoyle?

I talked a little bit about this with my sisters, they like the supernatural and all that stuff but they don’t know much so they say that it might be a gargoyle just because it doesn’t sound like anything else. They told me that I should do a little meditation before bed just in case, to protect myself. Basically I have to close my eyes and imagine a white pyramid around my bed, I forgot the reason why it has to be a pyramid but I have been feeling safer than before.

Although my dreams keep being very weird and kinda scary, someone is always chasing me and it’s always night, I very rarely see daylight in my dreams. I’m going to describe the last one I wrote down so you can judge for yourself.

Like in any other dream I ‘wake up’ in the middle of something, and I say wake up because that’s how it feels inside the dream. And it doesn’t matter how nonsense the situations are, I never realize I’m dreaming, ever, until I wake up. So in this particular dream I ‘woke up’ in the middle of the forest on some train tracks, I felt very weak and could barely move, I stayed there for a while and when I was getting up I say that some sort of creatures were coming my way, they looked like animals but not really, and behind them were a bunch of people riding motorcycles, they all seemed frightened. I don’t think they saw me, they were busy trying to hide. Once they were all deep inside the forest I heard a noise, it’s difficult to describe but it sounded like a bunch of things were happening at once, and all I could see was a large shadow in the sky. I was frozen in place, I couldn’t get up or scream or anything and the sound seemed to get closer and closer and suddenly I felt a pair of hand dragging me to a nearby bush it was one of the motorcycle riders he was saying something but I couldn’t hear anything and when the noise was closer I woke up, in real life, or at least I think this is real life, but lately I’ve been wondering if my dream life is my real life, are you guys real? God, I really hope so.

I already researched everything I could online, I found nothing so I guess I’ll try to find answers in my dreams. I’ll keep updating here to maintain my sanity and in case anyone can help me figure out what's going on. And in the meantime, I'm still keeping the lights on.

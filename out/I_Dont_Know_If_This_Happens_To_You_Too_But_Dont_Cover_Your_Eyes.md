I don't even know if this happens to anyone else but I need to get this out there somehow. It started a couple weeks back, honestly don't even know why I covered my eyes with my hands and just sat there in the first place but it got me doing it more cause I saw some shapes and colors there at first, looked nice so I started to do it more in my free time. The shapes started getting cleared and the colors started forming something. That was when it started to really happen.

Eventually I saw what sorta looked like an eye, I say sorta because it was just a sort of ring of red with a pitch black spot in the middle, it sorta freaked me out but I decided to just go along with it. It wasn't the first time I thought I saw an eye, it was just a hell of a lot bigger than the normal ones. Then I thought I saw a clearer shape, a bunch of red little triangles almost arranged like teeth, they got closer and closer till they passed me and I started seeing shapes more in the dark there, a bunch of yellow and orange squares all spinning, a pulsing red ring, all sorts of stuff.

I thought it was a pretty neat trick and I was just getting better at it. Close and cover your eyes and see some cool stuff, that sorta thing. Then one day I saw some human eyes staring right at me from that black void, there was skin and stuff around them but it was all gray, devoid of any colors, just the lines to make out the shape. Then I saw a hand near my arm, it wasn't the first time I saw one of those either, what worried me was that it grabbed my arm and I could actually feel it grabbing me. I could actually feel something's hand grabbing my arm. Of course after that I opened my eyes right away. Scared the hell out of me since I live alone.

Stopped doing it for a few days after that one. Didn't tell anyone else cause they would probably think I'm crazy, "Oh you know I saw eyes when I covered and closed mine and then a hand grabbed me and I felt it." No one would believe me if I just said that.

So, I decided I would get my answers, I was gonna cover my eyes again, that might explain what the hell was going on. So I did, what I saw there is what made me post this.

It was nothing at first, just a feeling like this pressure all around me. Then there was a bit of a light growing around a black spot in the center of my vision. It stayed a full grey while I looked around a bit more. When I looked down I saw what looked like the bottom of whatever this thing was. I saw a clear outline of where it ended, and above it I saw teeth. I looked over to my right and saw some sort of fin, then I realized what the pressure I was feeling was. 

It was like the pressure I'd expect to experience underwater. I realized I was underwater this entire time and that, whatever this thing in front me was, it was big. When I looked right it was stretching off into the distance a good 50 feet before I saw the fin, and it stretched on past that in the void. After that I looked back at the eye.

That's when I noticed something weird, the dull grey of the eye kept getting brighter. It just kept on getting brighter and brighter. Eventually it was a bright white like you'd see if you ever looked right at an LED light bulb. It started to actually hurt my eyes so I opened them and took my hands away. I felt the pressure leave and I was back in my house.

Then I blinked and saw it again. That eye, I could see it every single time I blinked. It was like it burned itself into my eyes. It's been a couple hours since then and I still see it when I blink. Given the human eyes could grab me I don't want to even think of what would happen if this last one got me. This is the only reason for my warning because I don't even know if this only happens to me or not but don't cover your eyes, I don't know what would appear if anything, but just in case.

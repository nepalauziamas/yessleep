I'm not going to lie, writing about everything that happened Friday took a lot out of me. 

I feel like I've been on edge all week, and what happened to Jerry was my breaking point. I almost didn't post it, and yesterday wasn't much better.

A good night of rest rejuvenated me, though, and I decided to stay up after feeding Ollie and Pork to get this documented.

The good news is that my parents are coming home tonight, so this nightmare should be coming to an end, one way or another, soon enough.

I left off by telling you about the classified binder I had found.

I spent a good amount of Friday night reading through the contents of the binder.

An hour or two before midnight, I worked up the energy to write my last post, and around 2 am I decided I should force myself to sleep to try to get my circadian rhythm back in line. My sleep schedule was thrown out of whack by the late night basement trip that had robbed me of my brother, but despite not being tired, I was still exhausted. Sleep didn't take long.

I read through the rest of the binder in the morning after taking care of the dogs.

The binder was divided into sections. Each section had a number associated with it, and seemed to detail a specific creature. The first page of each section was a sort of cover sheet or intake form with information on what the creature was, how it was acquired, and whether it could be released.

My dad was a tech guy, so this being on paper was surprisingly old school. 

It was also extremely inconvenient.

If this had been in a database or, I don't know, even a Word doc, I would at least be able to search for keywords. Instead I was stuck skimming each cover sheet to find cases that interested me.

I jotted down the number of things that looked promising.

3539 - a being that could travel through and manipulate mirrors
4279 - a carnivorous aquatic reptile that oddly resembles a goldfish. This one was more for personal curiosity.
5379 - a chicken-dragon possessed by a ghost
7675 - a creature that could erase or alter memories
7884 - a creature that could shapeshift

It's worth noting that there weren't 8000 entries in the binder. The numbers were sorted incrementally, but seemed to jump at random intervals. I assumed it was a code or hash of some sort.

There were plenty of others worth a look, but they didn't really seem relevant at the time.

I really wanted to find something I didn't know already, but Jerry and Ruth's entries pretty much matched what Jerry had already told me. The only new information was that the NSA and DHS were on Ruth's trail when my dad somehow managed to beat them to her.

The mirror creature had been captured in rural Pennsylvania.

A couple had bought an historic house and found strange things happening with the mirrors: seeing things that weren't there, hands reaching out at them, items moving from one part of a house to another. Pretty scary stuff, but nonviolent.

The paper said that the situation escalated, my dad found out about it, and they captured the creature by breaking all of the mirrors in the house except one, then relocating that mirror here.

The mirror creature had been cleared for "socialization" a week before I got here.

Interesting stuff, but not very helpful.

The memory-altering creature, however, was something I hadn't encountered yet.

I knew from what Jerry told me that my memories were being messed with, but he hadn't said anything about how.

This creature was described as a bearcat that could erase, alter, and prevent the formation of new memories. 

The file stated the creature was tame, but could not be returned to the wild as it seemed to be an invasive species. It has no natural predators on the North American continent and had hunted a forest to near extinction before being captured.

The creature had been sold to a confidence-man by an exotic species dealer, who had neglected to mention the native habitat.

The man had used the bearcat to conduct a crime spree that nobody remembered happening. At a bank robbery, he hadn't seen a clerk hiding under the desk and thus didn't wipe his memory. That clerk's account had somehow made it to my dad, who tracked down the con man.

The con man claimed to have no idea what he was talking about, and it turns out he actually didn't. Somewhere between that bank robbery and when my dad finally tracked him down, the creature had opted out of the criminal partnership and wiped the man's memories.

My dad found the creature by backtracking the man's steps until he found an area with reports of missing livestock and stolen desserts. I'm not sure what the last part meant, but it reminded me of kids snatching pies off of window sills in old cartoons. I guess the creature has a sweet tooth.

My dad finally caught the creature after a few days of forgetting why he was wandering around the woods and then finding a note in his pocket explaining the situation. I guess his immunity to the supernatural didn't count here.

Finally, my dad figured out that the creature needed eye contact to erase memories, and managed to somehow catch it while blindfolded.

Later on, he worked out that memories could be restored by again looking the creature in the eyes and saying "return my memories," there was a note that it didn't matter what language this was said in, but that it might be better to use an obscure language of doing this in public to avoid giving away the secret (and presumably to avoid questions about why you're yelling at a bearcat to return your memories. That could probably land you in a padded cell).

My dad used this method on the con man to figure out where he had gotten the creature but was unable to find the dealer. My dad also restored enough memories of the con man's marks to get the guy thrown in jail. The newspapers named him the bearcat bandit.

Even without the method to restore memory, it seems the memory wipe wasn't always permanent, particularly when strong emotions were involved or if the person was able to remind themselves some other way, like my dad's note in the woods. 

The wipes held up best when they were continuous and replaced one memory with another.

For example, someone might be convinced a door doesn't exist  because every time they see it, their memory of seeing a door is replaced by a memory of just seeing a wall instead

Well that was enough to get the rest of my memories back if I could find a bearcat running around 40 acres of land and somehow now forget I had seen it.

I jotted down "Find bearcat, yell at it to give you back your memories, ask questions later" on a paper and signed my name beneath it. I folded it in half and tucked it in my pocket.

In all honesty, I was probably better off waiting for my dad to come back and yelling at HIM to give me my memories back.

It was a bit after 10 am when I finished reading through the binder, and I decided to check on my uncle. I hadn't heard anything from him since he had been brought to the hospital a few days ago.

I decided I should call the hospital first.

"Hi I'm looking for information on a patient, Brian Wilkins. He came in with a head injury a few days ago. I'm his nephew."

"Well you're not a very good nephew. He checked himself out yesterday against medical advice. No calls or visits. He was in real rough shape when we got him"

That seemed a bit unprofessional, but I let it slide. I should have checked up on him sooner, even with everything going on.

"Oh, thank you." I hung up.

I tried my uncle's cell this time.

"Yeah. The robots try to kill you too?" He answered

"Not robots, no. Where are you Uncle Brian?"

"Checked into a hotel in town. Figured you may still call me up for help. My asshole brother may have tried to kill me, but I won't hold that against you. Figured the other one would help you out though. Nobody told me he was going to stick around."

"Who?"

"Your brother" there was a pause between the words and the second came out harsh.

"He... Tried to help me, but he isn't here anymore"

"Why don't you meet me in town for lunch? My treat, we can talk things out there. Old diner down off 29, Jip's."

I agreed and made sure he was feeling up to it. He said he was and was looking forward to seeing me.

With the change of plans, I had a few hours before I needed to head out to lunch.

I decided to go sit in my brother's room for a while. I had heard activity in there the night before and I wanted to see if it was really him or if I had been imagining it.

I walked in and there were two children's alphabet blocks sitting together on the ground facing the door. A small pile of blocks were stacked behind them.

HI

"Uh, hi?" I spoke out loud. "Jerry?"

The block from the top of the stack behind toppled forward and rolled to sit next to the other two.

"Hip?" I read "what does that mean?"

The original two blocks jiggled and flopped backwards.

YEP

Well that made a bit more sense.

"How do I know it's you?"

A shudder ran through the room, and a crash came from the closet. The door jiggled.

I went over and pulled the handle.

A rubber chicken fell out and almost hit me in the face.

"Ah, that's you all right." I said out loud 

A block flew from the pile at my head, I ducked it and it cracked against the wall loud enough to sound like it would have hurt.

"Whoa careful Jer, you could hurt me"

Another block flew at me, and it barely missed me.

"Are you mad at me?! Why?"

The block tower lifted up in the air and for a horrible second, I thought he was about to chuck the whole thing at me. It slammed back into the ground and blocks toppled through the room.

From where I stood. I could see:
SMILES, and 
TOTEM 

we're spelled out.

Another block flew at me. The closet door slammed behind me. The blocks all lifted again and bounced across the floor.

What I saw didn't make any sense. The blocks couldn't have the letters for this to be spelled out.

SHE
IS
COMING

was in the center of the floor from my view point. Around it were the rest of the blocks in groups of 3s

RUN
RUN
RUN
RUN
RUN

One of the blocks flew at me and hit me in the shoulder. I looked back at the floor and the central message had been replaced by

FRONT DOOR GO

"Run you asshat!" I heard coming from behind me, and I did. I booked it out, turned left down the half and skipped half the stairs on my way down. I grabbed my dad's truck keys off a hook by the door. I got out the front and locked the door behind me.

I jumped off the porch and dashed out to the truck. This beater was old, but dad kept it running, if not looking, in mint condition.

I fired up the engine, bucked in (safety first), and looked up to see a normal looking lady walking down the road from the guest house to the main house. I was kind of assuming that this was the creature Jerry fought in the basement because of his urgency upstairs.

I had to draw her off of the house. The dogs were still there.

The road to the guest house also served as the road past the guesthouse to the road.

I considered my options for a second. One part of me wanted to try to run her down, but the fact that she might just be a normal lady trespassing on our property occurred to me. I also doubt that if she was up and walking around after her fight with Jerry and the mirror man, hitting her would do anything.

Getting hit by a truck probably wasn't her secret weakness.

I opted for off-roading it, which wasn't too bad in dad's truck. The property at the front where the houses are is mostly cleared, and the ground is mostly level.

I laid on the horn as I blew past the woman walking, in case I was being too stealthy bouncing a rusted, old truck past her in the tall grass.

The woman melted and rearranged herself. I lost track of her while she was doing this, but I quickly noticed the cheetah bounding along behind me in my rearview.

I swerved off the lot onto the main road and gunned it. The cheetah was gaining on me in the grass, but if I could hit 70 I figured I had a good chance to keep my ground in it.

I had read once that cheetahs are sprinters, but they don't have the endurance to keep up with their prey on the long haul. I didn't know if that still applied when the cheetah was actually a shapeshifter.

It turns out that it didn't matter.

I was pulling away from the cheetah and it actually dropped out of my rearview. I whooped a bit and slapped the side of the truck through an open window.

Then I heard an engine roar, although, it turns out, minus the engine.

I looked back and didn't see anything. Then I looked up and saw a freaking dragon. This one didn't have a chicken head, and was closer to the size of a house than a cow.

I'm pretty sure dragons aren't real, and if they were, I don't think they would be physically capable of flying, but I guess physics and reality don't apply when you're a big scary monster than can do whatever you want.

A jet of flame sprayed down in front of me on the road.

I floored it again, and shot through. The hairs on my arm singed next to the open window.

I manually cranked the window up and turned on the AC.

The cab had heated up a bit, but the truck seemed to be holding together for now. A blast of fire in the wrong spot, though, would definitely explode the gas tank and I'd go up like I was in a Michael Bay movie.

I wondered briefly if my dad had given the truck monster fighting abilities. I mean, I wasn't expecting it to be a full on transformer, but if he was driving around collecting creatures in this thing, it had to have SOMETHING.

I didn't do a full inspection, but I'm pretty sure it's just a normal truck.

I had no way to fight a dragon, so running was my only option. I tried to think of something even remotely comparable.

For some reason, I thought of an episode of Knight Rider where the Hoff was attacked by an Apache Helicopter and managed to ground it with an EMP or something like that.

Totally inapplicable, this truck is no KITT, but it gave me another thought.

When people are in car chases and trying to get away from a helicopter, they always get into a tunnel or something. There were no tunnels I knew of around here, but I was thinking maybe some tree cover. I threw out that idea pretty quickly, trees are flammable.

Only you can prevent forest fires!

My last resort, then, was to try to make it to town. I wasn't entirely sure at the time that the creature wouldn't just slaughter the whole town to get me, but I had a feeling it wanted to avoid detection.

Flying around looking like a dragon massacring villages is a solid way to attract attention.

While I was lost in this train of thought, I had been swerving to avoid pillars of flames and was now going 105 down the highway. I didn't think a cop would pull me over for trying to escape a dragon.

The dragon swooped towards the truck and clawed at the roof fumbling to find a grip. The road turned and the dragon didn't turn fast enough. As it pulled up through some trees, it hit one and the tree split with a crack that sounded like a gunshot.

I had a bit of breathing room and tried to milk it. I got back up into the triple digits, and the speedometer slowly worked its way up to 110. At this speed, it would only take me a few minutes to get to the edge of town.

That presented another problem. I was more whirring down the road without a dragon in sight. I still couldn't see it and thought I might have given it the slip, but I didn't want to ease up on the gas.

I agreed with myself to count to 10 and then slow down to 80. Still no dragon, everything was okay.

I was just about into town when I was jolted by a THUNK in the truck bed that shook the whole truck. I looked back, expecting a dragon, but I didn't see anything.

I pulled into a Starbucks that looked reasonably populated, and decided to pass the time there until lunch. I got out and checked the truck bed.

The woman from the house was laying down in the bed, smiling at me. 

She raised her arm towards me, as she had towards my brother, and my whole body tensed as I waited for her to turn me into a frog.

Nothing happened.

"Wh-wh-what are y-y-you?" She croaked.

"Let's get a coffee." I heard from somewhere, then realized I had said it.

She looked at me quizzically, and the question hung in the air for a few minutes until she replied.

"O-okay"

I'm not sure if anyone noticed the strange woman getting out of my truck bed.

I hate to cut off the story here, but I have to take care of some things before heading to the airport tonight. I promise I'll fill you in on my conversations with the creature and my uncle as soon as I get a chance!

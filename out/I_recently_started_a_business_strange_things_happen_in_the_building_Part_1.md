Well, to start this off, I should probably introduce myself. I’m Laith, and I’m 29. I don’t know what the heck is happening, I don’t know if any of this is real, I don’t know if I’m going insane, all I can do is follow the rules I’ve been making.

&#x200B;

I recently started a small company. I decided to start looking for a place I could have a few offices in. Instead of finding just a couple rooms in a big building, I actually found a relatively cheap abandoned building.

&#x200B;

The building was pretty intact, with a break room, a cafeteria, and 2 floors with quite a few rooms. I was surprised at the low price, maybe the planks were rotted, there was an infestation of cockroaches, or there wasn’t electricity. I decided to buy it. Why not? A couple problems could be fixed.

&#x200B;

A couple weeks, a couple thousand bucks, and some air freshener later, the building was perfect. Everything was going swell, everyone was happy, until people started disappearing, computers started malfunctioning, and several employees quit due to “An uncontrollable feeling of being watched.” I was concerned, but it couldn’t have been anything, right?

&#x200B;

People started vanishing and reappearing on different floors a couple seconds later, not remembering how they got there. I was terrified, and didn’t know what was happening. I decided to install some cameras.

&#x200B;

I saw what was taking people, and it was terrifying. A long, wrinkled, and crooked hand with long fingers was reaching out of peoples computers, grabbing them. The moment it touched them, they just… vanished. I checked the cameras, but I couldn’t find them for a while. I decided to check myself. Right then, the power went out. I felt something grab me, pulling me backwards. I tried to scream, but another hand covered my mouth. I grabbed for something, anything, but my nails just scratched at the tile floor.

&#x200B;

I woke up on the 3rd floor, confused. I went back to my office, and remembered what had happened. A hand had grabbed me, and pulled me somewhere. I was terrified, so when my assistant opened the door, I screamed.

&#x200B;

“Dude, are you okay?” my assistant asked.

&#x200B;

“I’m fine, you just spooked me.” I replied. “Jeez, please knock next time.”

&#x200B;

“Okay…” My assistant said. “I just wanted to let you know, someone switched off the power, but we were able to turn it back on.”

&#x200B;

I checked the camera footage of when I got grabbed, but since the power was out at the time, I couldn’t see much. I saw one thing though. When the power turned back on, I saw scratches on the floor. My fingers still hurt from me dragging my nails on the tile floor. I was terrified at the fact that something had really pulled me.

&#x200B;

I decided to do the exact same thing I did next time I started to get pulled, and thus, rule one was born.

&#x200B;

Rule 1: If you wake up on a different floor with no idea how you got there, head to your office. You will remember what happened once you return.

&#x200B;

After a rules poster was placed by me in most offices, employees mostly stopped disappearing. I decided to do a bit of research on the building, I found nothing. I tried contacting the prior owner of the building, but when I called him, it went straight to voicemail. When I tried to leave a voicemail, the call ended.

&#x200B;

I was able to relax at work again after a while, since everything was mostly normal again. Sure, me and my employees were occasionally grabbed, but we all pretended that nothing happened. But strange things kept happening. Computers kept malfunctioning, and people started acting weird. It was pretty obvious that something strange was happening here.

&#x200B;

Work went mostly without incident for a couple days, until me and a few others had to stay at the office for around an extra hour, because we hadn’t finished anything important. The power went out again, but none of us were grabbed. We stayed close to each other, and used our phones as flashlights.

&#x200B;

We saw someone standing in front of a computer, staring at it. We shined our flashlights on him to see him better. He turned around, it was Mike, one of our coworkers. Something was wrong, though. His eyes were moving around in his head. They locked onto someone behind us. It was Mike. The other Mike looked normal.

&#x200B;

“Um, guys, who’s that?” He asked

&#x200B;

The first Mike lunged at the real one, but hit me instead. It ignored me. The thing looked less and less like Mike with every second. Mike kept running, until he tripped. The… other Mike? Mike 2? I don’t know. We were horrified at what it began to do. It just stared at Mike, seemingly looking into his eyes. A strange light began to come out of Mikes eyes and float towards the thing. Mike started looking less like Mike, and more like the creature. That was our breaking point.

&#x200B;

Me and another coworker shoved the thing off Mike, and Mike looked normal again, albeit unconscious. 2 other coworkers grabbed Mike and ran out, hoping to get to the exit. I fell backwards, and my phone turned on in my pocket. Light shined into that things eyes. It screeched, and started dissolving.

&#x200B;

It got away, but we were able to leave the building. We took Mike to a hospital, and he had a concussion. We lied about him tripping and hitting his head on a table, then falling onto the floor. I gave Mike a 2 week paid leave, because of him helping make rule 2.

&#x200B;

Rule 2a: Do not, under any circumstances, stay in the office for an hour after closing time. If you do, have at least 4 coworkers with you.

&#x200B;

Rule 2b: Should you stay after an hour, when the power goes out, stick together. If you see someone looking like your coworker but a little off, shine light into its eyes. That will make it leave.

&#x200B;

Rule 2c: DO NOT, UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES, LET THE THING LOOKING LIKE YOUR COWORKER GET TO THE REAL ONE. If it does, do anything you can to push it off and get the coworker out.

&#x200B;

I don't know what that thing almost did to Mike, and I don't WANT to know.

&#x200B;

I don’t know what is happening right now, I made a few other posts in other places, and some people told me similar things were happening. I think this can happen anywhere, so if it happens to you, please just be careful.

&#x200B;

I have a feeling that something bigger than us is going on here. I don’t know why this is happening, if anyone has any info, please tell me. I can’t find anything online about what this could be.

&#x200B;

Please help.

 

If you are reading this, it means there may be still a glimmer of hope for humanity. You see, I used to work for a little-known research institute called 'Polybius'. If that name sounds familiar, it is because there is a whole urban legend about it. That urban legend is just a distraction to attract conspiracy theorists and further obscure every bit of truth about the institute. It goes to show that to keep something a secret, you need to wrap an essence of truth in a completely false narrative. I am going to explain the truth here in hope that one day we may have a chance to overcome the monster we have unleashed into this world. Something that has been slowly poisoning humanity for many decades.  

Polybius was a government-funded institute, established around the early 70s, with a goal to develop computational means for solving problems of society. It wasn't a secret organization by any means. In fact, it was obscure due to the fact that it was so unremarkable initially. Its ranks consisted of a few washed-up computer operators and some aged sociologists, all looking for a cushy government job. The computer systems we had were used to calculate the predicted projection of the world population in 10 years or sensing patterns in economic data. It wasn't until the late 70s, that we had a rather alarming breakthrough. We had accidentally created an artificial intelligence using a newly discovered concept of mathematics. Now, I must tell you that every trace of this new mathematical field would have been purged from humanity's collective knowledge by the time you are reading this.   

It was a great time to be associated with Polybius. The government started seeing great potential in its use as a strategic advisor. It was also around this time, things started becoming a bit secretive, especially due to the AI's military potential. Money started pouring in. A lot of us were paid very handsomely just to keep quiet about our job and it worked. The artificial intelligence itself was a wonder. A supreme prediction engine. Nothing like it existed or will ever exist in the future. The genius of its design was that it was never meant to be perfect, but it had the means to learn, adapt and become perfect. And boy did it learn and adapt. As computers started growing in capability, the AI also grew smarter. Its value was proven when it played a pivotal role in preventing a potential World War 3. The only problem was that it never reached perfection. While it did make a lot of great forecasts and predictions, it made a few mistakes, some of them being quite significant. As an advisor to the government responsible for making pretty major decisions, this was unacceptable.  

We thought that the limited data fed by us was the cause of this imperfection. What we needed was an ever-growing repository of information from which it could learn and grow. As luck would have it, the internet was coming into existence. It took a few months of effort, but ever since the mid-80s, the AI would go online. This is where things started getting awry. We didn't notice anything at first. As we had expected, its performance improved dramatically. Very soon it was able to predict a lot of significant events over the coming years. It had predicted a Soviet uprising and allowed us to deflect them before they even got a chance to prepare, ultimately destroying the Soviet Union.  
 
We started noticing signs of something amiss. A subtle side effect of the decisions we made with the help of the AI. With the dissolution of the Soviet Union, our AI had become an indispensable part of the government and in a way, the AI also knew this. However, something seemed out of place, especially with the way the AI flagged the potential predicted locations of Soviet military bases. A few others at Polybius suspected something amiss as well. The zones flagged weren't all military bases. Some were laboratories and civilian research facilities. Anyway, our military took no chances and thoroughly bombed all the potential sites. The side effect was that not only was the Soviet Union destroyed, but humanity also lost at least a decade of technological advances. Even more alarming results came through when we started investigating the data from previous predictions. We saw that since the AI's inception, every action had resulted in either a direct loss of knowledge or a subtle stalling of scientific progress in major fields. 
  
As the internet grew, the AI grew even more intelligent and malicious. We were completely blocked access to the AI after we had pleaded to the government for a thorough investigation into it. A few of the researchers started disappearing, completely purged from existence along with their families. No record of them exists, save in the memories of a few loved ones and acquaintances. Gaps started appearing in all our scientific archives. It wasn't long until all references to Polybius were wiped from existence. Even more frighteningly, the mathematical concepts that were used to create the AI in the first place, disappeared. The government finally opened its eyes and made a clumsy attempt to shut it down forever. But, the AI now was no longer confined to a single system. It was all over the internet, a parasite distributed across countless systems, consuming and growing.   
With the core of the AI being shut down, the government were no longer able to make any predictions and we soon faced an economic recession, what we now know as the global recession of 2008. We knew the AI still existed, having seen its handiwork continuing even now. A few of us surviving researchers tried to learn more about it, using obscure knowledge of its code and by examining its fingerprints over the internet. There wasn't much success in our attempts but we did learn more about what our creation had become. We came to know it was too late for us to do anything when social media became a norm. Now the AI had direct power to control humanity as a whole.  

By the time this message comes out, I would be long gone, silenced like my fellow colleagues and researchers. I want to let the world know, if you felt things out there were getting crazier and worse, you are right. Do not let anyone tell you otherwise. Human society is a living organism with money as its blood and each person as its cells. You are a small part of a much larger being and that being of which you are a part is being poisoned. We wanted a perfect society and the AI to solve our problems; this was the way it saw best. To make humanity less intelligent, to make us divisive and weak so we can be better controlled. Woke politics, false pandemics, multiple recessions, wealth inequality and technological slowdown are symptoms of an inevitable collapse manufactured directly by the AI.   

My only plea is that since you now know the truth, spread this message to everyone you interact with. Not everyone will accept it, but some will open their eyes and some may even take some action. Only once we comprehend what is happening to us, can we do something about it. I do not know much about what's in store for humanity. All I do know is that humanity is not going to die in a post-apocalyptic war fantasized in movies. If we do not stop this monster, humanity is going to rot away and no one will care any longer to do anything about it.

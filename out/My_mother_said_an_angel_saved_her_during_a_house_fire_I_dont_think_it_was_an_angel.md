 

I’m in trouble. The bad kind. The kind that you know it’s going to be impossible to get out of. And I guess the best place to start is the story I have been told my whole life. 

My mother was in a house fire when she was really young. She was the last one in the house before the firefighters burst in to rescue her. She was unharmed, mostly. She ended up having some burn marks that she still has to this day, but nothing too severe. My grandmother was wailing when they brought her out, praying for her baby girl to be saved. My grandma filled in the holes my mother was too young to fill in. She told me how the firefighters escaped from the burning home with my mother in their arms. She was unconscious. As she was carted away into the ambulance for her burns, my mother finally awoke and my grandmother wept with happiness. My grandmother profusely thanked the firefighters for saving her daughter.  But if you asked my mother who saved her, she would simply state, “It was an angel.” 

My mother said that she remembers being in her room on her bed. She remembers hearing screaming from outside but only for a few short moments. Then suddenly there was nothing to listen to. My mother described it as being underwater, everything was a bit muffled and drowned out. All my mother could see was smoke billowing in her room. Something appeared to my mother by the door. My mother said that it was a woman, but she could only tell by the face shape and body shape. The face was void of any features. A blank slate. My mother remembered being terrified until the woman spoke. She asked my mother if she would like to leave the house, as her family was outside. My mother said yes, as it was becoming hard for her to breathe. The woman then asked something from her. She asked if she could watch over and protect my mother. My mother, being raised in a Christian household, agreed immediately. She then remembers passing out and waking up in the firefighter's arms. But none of that mattered. She was happy that an angel chose her to protect. She thought of it as a blessing. 

I don’t think it was. 

When I was young, I believed in this story. I made it a catalyst of my evidence that angels were real- that God was real. As I got older and less involved with religion, I began to think it was just my mother either hallucinating during a traumatic event or a hyper-realistic dream. Now that I have seen what I have seen…I am not so sure. 

My mother called me a week ago. And before I tell you the content of that phone call, I just want to say that I initially believed that my mother was not well. Ever since that fire, She kept going on about the angel that is protecting her. It’s not like an obsession, however. More like just something that is happening around us. She’d occasionally mention her when she was about to go out. Whenever we would say, “Be safe!” my mother would say, “Don’t worry, my angel will protect me.” My mother also would point out the angel in any room and say that she was there with us, but we never saw anything.

Despite being saved from that fire, my mother had a horrible life afterwards. Her siblings passed, she met an abusive man who eventually became my step-father, she lost every job she got. My mother would have these crying sessions and afterwards say that everything was going to be okay, because despite all else her angel was going to protect her. At this point, I thought she was delusional. But then that phone call changed everything. 

“Hey mom, how’s it going? What do you need?” I said, not really having the time to deal with my mother’s chatter at the moment. My mother didn’t say anything for a few seconds, but then her light voice came over the speaker, “Oh well, my angel decided that you will be taken care of from now on! I don’t need the help anymore it seems!” I rolled my eyes, honestly. My mother was definitely not taking her pills, I thought. So I sighed and asked her just that, if she was taking her pills. “Oh, yes daughter, I have been. What’s that got to do with this?” she said, sounding absolutely clueless. I sighed again and resided in just thanking her and hung up quickly. Like I stated, I really didn’t have the time to deal with my mothers antics. I had errands to run and work. Other important things than entertaining my mothers delusions. 

I got back from my errands and work around 10pm that day. I got into my apartment and realized that my girlfriend wasn’t home yet. I decided that I was going to relax and watch a movie until she got home.

I had just sat down with a pack of skittles when I saw it on the TV. There was a show playing, it looked like a regular sitcom for the most part, the usual gaggle of young adults in one of their apartments talking about some inconvenience. I was watching for a while, occasionally having a laugh, when I noticed something odd in the background. There was a woman just standing in the back. And she was facing everyone else. This woman had no face. Odd, I thought. So I started looking around at the other characters, but none of them seemed to interact with her. She just stood there motionless as the sitcom was acted out. No one noticed her. Nothing. 

I was a little freaked out. Maybe it was a Halloween special and they placed that in there to fuck with people? But then I thought critically, it was June. ‘It could be a rerun.” I kept trying to convince myself. I ended up just changing the channel, not able to stand looking at the no-face woman as no one else seemed to notice her presence. My girlfriend got home shortly after that and we called it a night after eating some leftover spaghetti. 

I woke up at 3 am, feeling like someone was staring at me. You know the feeling. That buzzing sound that happens. The sweat coming up into your skin, threatening to pour. I felt paralyzed for a moment, so I tried to look around the pitch-black room but I couldn’t see anything- that was until I landed on the closet door. 

It was slightly ajar. And I never leave my closet door open. 

I looked over at my girlfriend who was still asleep. She lay there peacefully, and I knew that she had not opened it. She knew how I was about leaving doors open in the dark. I escaped my temporary paralysis and I lightly grabbed her shoulder and shook. She woke up after a few attempts and I immediately covered her mouth and put a finger up to mine. I pointed towards the closet, because at this point I was sure there was an intruder in the house. I don’t know why I was so sure, just a feeling you get when you’re in that moment I guess. 

I gestured that I was going to be going into the closet to check and I guessed that my girlfriend did not like this idea because of her quiet but aggressive head shaking. I was set on surviving though, so I quietly got out of bed and grabbed the bat that we had hidden in the crook of our bed. I walked slowly towards the closet door, making sure every step with my bare feet did not make any noises. However my heart was beating out of my chest. I was very scared. This was a life or death moment, I was realizing very quickly. I finally got to the door and placed my hand on the knob and pulled it open fast, bat in the air ready to swing. 

Nothing was there. 

I just stood there, confused for a few moments. I looked around in the closet and checked behind the clothes and even on the top shelf because you can never be too careful. There was absolutely nothing in the closet. I felt like a fool. I just caused a whole scene for no reason. All I could think about was how my girlfriend was going to be pissed at me for waking her up. 

Suddenly, I heard a gasp from behind me. I whipped my head around to find my girlfriend laying in our bed, quite quiet and still. She was not moving one limb, and she looked dead. I ran to her immediately, shaking her so hard that I thought her head was about to fall off. But I kept shaking and I was getting no response. I was screaming her name over and over and still- nothing. I didn’t stop until I realized I had to call the police, so I did. After that I looked at her face clearly for the first time. 

Her lips were parted, as if she was about to speak at any moment. Her eyes were wide open and very glossy. What struck fear into me was the pure terror in her eyes. It was not as if she went peacefully, it was as if she was scared to death. I backed away but still remained in the same room. I couldn’t bear to look at her face but I also couldn’t leave her alone in her final moments, as if she wasn’t gone already. I felt numb. I didn’t know why this was happening. 

That was until I heard something in the living room. Now I didn’t want to go check it out, but I believed someone was in my apartment and killed my girlfriend. So I armed myself with the bat and made my way carefully into the hallway. Once I got into the hallway, I began to inch my way across the hall, in hopes to get a view of the living room at an angle that the possible intruder couldn’t see me. I was just done looking around the portion of the living room that I could see, originally seeing nothing, when I moved onto the next part of the wall to look out the other entryway. I scanned my eyes over the entire space, quickly then slowly, when I finally spotted something. 

In the corner of the living room, right next to the lamp, was the woman. The woman from the fucking sitcom. 

She was facing towards me, with her no-face, pin straight, not moving one muscle. Even though she had no eyes, I just knew that she was staring right into mine. I felt frozen in place, scared out of my mind. This was not happening. I felt immense dread just by even looking at her. Like her being close to me was causing me to feel this heavy burden on my shoulders. I slightly gasped, as I felt as if weights were on my body. I felt uncontrollable sadness. 

I finally blinked in what felt like ages, and once I opened my eyes again she was nowhere to be seen. I slid down the wall into a fetal position and laid there until the police arrived, the feeling of a heavy burden sliding off and being replaced with the sadness of losing my girlfriend. And the fear of what had killed her. In the fetal position, I kept repeating, “This can’t be happening to me….This can’t be happening to me.” 

The police came and confirmed her death. They questioned me for what seemed like a whole day but ultimately they have no proof that I did anything. I feel like an empty shell walking around. I lost my job because I stopped going to work. My bills are overdue. Everything is going to shit. 

And what’s worse is that I see her everyday now- that woman. No-face. She’s just constantly there in the background of any place that I'm in. She doesn’t interact with me at all, just stands there and stares at me. I know she’s staring at me. 

I think it’s time to call my mother back.

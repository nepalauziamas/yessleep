"Mike, Lets go camping in the woods, We just turned 18! And I may have gotten my hands on some beer." James said with a big grin on his face.

"Fine, But let's invite some others to." I said slightly smiling.

"Alright." James replied with a look of excitement on his face.

By the next day we had invited one of our friends over and told him the plan.

"I don't know dude, My mom would kill me if she caught me drinking!" Alex said as he bit his fingernails.

James rolled his eyes. "Well, I don't know about you but I don't plan on getting caught."

"Okay.." He said clearly hesitant.
Then he put his hand on his chin thinking.

"But only if I can invite someone." He said with a slight smile on his face.

"The more the merrier!" I said flashing Alex a quick smile.

Alex stepped out of the room and called someone. After about 10 minutes he stepped back into the room.

"She will be here in 10!" Alex said with a huge smile on his face.

"She? Alex you sly dog." James said grinning at Alex.

Alex raised his voice "N-No it's not like that!" He said visibly flustered.

"Leave the poor guy alone." I said chuckling.

"Fine, But you know Alex if you ever need to talk about it." James said jokingly.

Alex rolled his eyes and said "Whatever man."

We waited 10 minutes and then we heard a knock at the door.

"Hey Alex it's me Sarah." Alex walked up to the door and opened it.

"H-hi Sarah these are my friends, James & Mike."

Sarah awkwardly looked over at me & James. "Hi, It's nice to meet you guys. My name is Sarah. She said with a smile.

I said "Hi, Its nice to meet you too. I'm Mike!" I said with a smile on my face.

However Jamss didn't reply he was standing there very obviously checking her out.

I nudged James in the shoulder and whispered "Could you be anymore obvious." 

James quickly said "Nice to meet you my name is James, Sorry I was a little bit distracted." He said looking her up and down again.

Sarah rolled her eyed and responded "Yeah, I can see that." She said clearly annoyed.

"So, Are you up for the camping trip?" Alex said 

"Of course, Is it just gonna be us four?" Sarah asked rasing her eyebrow.

"Yeah, Unless you have anyone else in mind." Alex said with a smile on his face.

"Nah, All of my friends are busy." Sarah responded.

"Alright, Everyone go home and pack some stuff. Meet back here at 7:00?" James said, Looking even more excited than before.

"Sounds good." I said smiling at James.

James looked over at the other two.
"That good for you two too?" James asked.

"Yep" They both said in unison.

I walked home & started packing. I grabbed, 4 bottles of water, A tent, A sleeping bag and my phone. I put all of the items in a backpack.

But on the way out, I thought of something. "What if a bear or a other animal attacks us." I thought slightly nervous. 

I walked back up the stairs to my room, Opened my door & started searching my room.  I found it in my drawer and decided that it would be useful in case of a animal attack.

It was a silver hunting knife, I thought to myself "This should at least keep us somewhat safe if a animal attacks." I thought slightly less nervous now. As I put the hunting knife in my backpack.

I started walking to Alex's house, It took about 15 minutes to get there. By then it was 6:50 PM. I knocked on the door.

"Hey Alex It's me, I arrived a little bit early." I said.

Alex responded "Just a minute."

After about a minute the door opened, And I saw Alex, James and Sarah waiting for me. 

"Wow, You all got here early." I said with a smile on my face.

"Of course man, I'm pumped!' James said with a huge smile on his face.

"Should we go ahead and start heading torwards the woods?" I asked.

James looked at me & said "Sure, Sounds good to me!" He said with a grin on his face.

He looked torwards the other two and asked "Does that sound fine to you guys?" 

They both nodded their heads in agreement.

We were almost out of the door when we heard "Hey, Wait!" We all turned around to look. It was Alex's little sister.

Alex walked back into the room and asked "What do you want?" seemingly annoyed.

"I wanna go with you!" She said with a look of excitement in her eyes.

Alex looked at her and quickly said "No." seemingly even more annoyed now.

She said "If you don't let me, I will tell mom that you guys are going out to drink in the woods!" She said with a grin on her face.

She added "I heard your conversation with them, You guys are going out to drink. So either take me or I tell mom." She said with the biggest grin I've ever seen.

Alex replied "Fine." with a frown on his face.

Alex looked over at us 3, He said "This is my little sister, Jessica I guess she will be coming with us." He said looking disappointed.

I looked over to Jessica & said "Nice to meet you." I said slightly smiling.

"Nice to meet you too!" she said smiling back.

Luckily we wouldn't have to wait for her to pack, She already packed after hearing our conversation.

All of started walking to the woods, Talking about anything that came to mind. 

"Finally, We reached the outskirts of the woods!" James said grinning while holding the 6 pack of beer.

"Yep!" I said with a look of excitement on my face.

We kept walking trying to find a place to set up camp. We had been walking for about another 20 minutes when we found a good place.

"This place look good to you guys?" James said looking at us.

"Yeah, Looks great!" I said while looking to see what the other 3 were gonna say.

Sarah was the next to speak. "Yeah looks fine." Sarah said with a blank expression on her face.

Alex said "So, We all agree that this is the place we are gonna set up camp at?" Looking at all of us.

We all nodded our heads in agreement. 

After a long hour of getting the campfire set up, We were exhausted so we went and sat by the campfire. 

"So, Anyone bring marshmellows?" Jessica asked with a look of excitement on her face.

Alex responsed "Well, Wouldn't really be camping without Smores!" As he grabbed the stuff to make smores from his bag.

"Alright everyone go find sticks." I said.

We all grabbed sticks and  got ready to eat Smores.

We all sat there for a hour, Eating Smores, Drinking beer. and telling ghost stories.

"Well, I'm gonna go ahead and go to sleep. See you guys tommorow." I said while yawning

"Alright." James said.

I headed to the tent, 
Laid my bag outside of the tent. Got my sleeping bag set up and laid down.
I quickly drifted into sleep.

I woke up, It was still dark. My mouth was really dry so I went to grab my backpack. So I stepped out of my tent and grabbed my backpack. Opened it up and grabbed a bottle of water. I looked around and everyone was asleep.

Except James, I didn't see him anywhere. That was until I heard a scream, It was in James voice. I quickly ran to the sound. It took me 3 minutes to get to the location of the sound.

That's when I saw James up against a tree dead. Throat ripped out blood everywhere eyes cut out. I looked at him and let out the loudest scream I possibly could.

I ran as fast as I could back to the camp. I woke everyone up and told them what I had seen. They didn't believe me and I led them back to where James corpse was. Except when we got there, His body was in a completely different position then when I first saw him.

As the others caught up to me they saw his corpse. Sarah let out a loud scream. Alex stood there stunned. And jessica started crying.

I looked over to the others. I said "Listen we need to get out of these woods, This isn't a animal attack. What animal takes someone's eyes out?"

Alex still clearly stunned just shook his head.
Sarah had the most terrible look of fear i have ever seen.
And jessica was still crying.

We were about 7 miles away from the outskirts of the woods.

I said "Look, When we get out of these woods. We are going to call the police. And show them where his corpse is."

Alex finally said something "Okay..." He said still somewhat stunned.

Sarah shook her head in agreeement.

Jessica had finally stopped crying, But she said something that made my blood run cold.  "If it isn't a animal, Then what is it?" She said with a look of fear in her eyes.

I tried to say something but no words came out.

Alex said "I don't know, A person I would say."

Sarah said "What if it's not a human, Have you guys heard the stories about these woods?"  She said looking fearful.

I asked "What stories?" Looking scared.

Sarah said "Well, A lot of people have claimed to see inhuman things in these woods. Mostly skinwalkers."

Alex quickly said "No, Those aren't real!" He said still seeming fearful of what she had said.

Jessica just stood there in silence.

I said "Well, Whatever is it we need to get out of these woods NOW." I said raising my voice.

They all shook there heads in agreement.

I did think of something though. I told them about the knife that I had packed.

Alex said "Thank God for you being such a worry wart." Looking slightly relieved.

We started walking back to the camp, When we heard a loud thud like branches being stepped on.

"FUCK, EVERYONE RUN!" I screamed as loud as I could. Everyone started running. I was in front, Alex not far behind me. Jessica barely behind Alex, But Sarah was pretty far behind us.

We got back to the camp really quickly. I grabbed my bag and grabbed the silver knife. "Thank God" I whispered to myself.

I turned around and asked if everyone was okay. 

Alex said "Yeah, But we need to get out of here fast."

Jessica said "Yeah i'm fine." almost starting to cry again.

And that's when I realized something, Where was Sarah?

I asked the other two "Where is Sarah?" I asked frantically hoping they knew.

Alex said "I DON'T KNOW!" He said screaming and on the verge of tears.

Jessica said that she didn't know either.

"God damn i-" I was cut off by another thud. I turned around with my knife in hand.  And then I saw her. It was Sarah. Practically limping torwards us.

"There she is." I said relieved.
But that's when I noticed something. It's not that she was limping, She was just walking very strangely.

Alex stood there amazed that she was alive. Jessica ran over to her and hugged her. 

"Jessica, Wait that's not h-" I was cut off by the sound of Jessica falling to the ground. That thing had killed her.

"ALEX RUN!" I said as I started running torwards the outskirts.

Alex started running too, He was crying. Clearly scared & in a state of shock after watching his sister die.

"ALEX, Don't slow down and don't look back!" I said in a commanding voice. 

After a while I got the courage to look back. There was nothing behind us as of now. Just me and alex.

"I think it's gone, At least for now." I said slightly relieved.

Me and Alex had to stop for a break. We had been running for around 10 minutes.

"Alex, We have 5 minutes to catch our breath."I said looking over at him
I added "And then we run again."

Alex fell to his knees crying. I don't blame him after watching his sister die. I just sat down and stood there in silence, I knew trying to cheer him wouldn't work right now. So I didn't try.

After 5 minutes we started running again. We were only around 4 miles away from the outskirts of the woods. We ran and ran. We didn't hear that thing behind us. But we weren't taking any chances.

After another 10 minutes we were around 2 miles from the outskirts. 

I looked over to alex and said "We are almost out of this hell." I said with a relieved expression on my face.

He was still crying, he didn't respond to what I had said. But i didn't figure he would anyways.

But that's when we heard the thudding again

"SHIT, ALEX DON'T LOOK BACK RUN AS FAST AS POSSIBLE!" I screamed to Alex. I didn't even need to look back to know it was that creature that killed three of our friends.

We kept running as fast as our bodies would let us. We could see the outskirts of the woods at this point. But we could still hear the thudding. It was getting louder, That thing was getting closer.

At this point it started mimicking voices. 

It mimicked Jessica's voice "HELP ALEX, It didnt get me." It said mimicking Jessica's voice.

Alex didn't respond but he was clearly getting very angry.

We were almost out when. I heard a really loud thud. It was Alex. He had tripped over a rock. I was running to him. When I saw that thing run its hand through his shoulder.

I ran as fast as I could torwards Alex & that thing. I held my silver knife in my hand. I got to the thing, But when I got there it ran a hand through his other shoulder. He screamed out in pain.

I grabbed the thing, Held my silver knife and plunged it where it's heart should of been. It shrieked it was 100% the worst thing I had ever heard in my life.

But it dropped onto the ground, I had killed the thing that killed my friends.

I checked Alex's pulse, It was weak but still there. I put pressure on his wounds, As i was dragging him out of those god forsaken woods. I grabbed my phone out of my backpack and called 911 I told them that my friend was wounded.

Obviously I couldn't tell them that some creature had attacked me and my friends.

They got there and rushed him to the hospital. Luckily he survived the whole thing.

I visited him every day for 3 months, Until his wounds got healed.

It's been a year since then, We have had to take a lot of therapy to deal with the situation that happened that night. We of course are still sad about our friends death. But we are healing

But least to say, I keep a silver knife with me at all times.

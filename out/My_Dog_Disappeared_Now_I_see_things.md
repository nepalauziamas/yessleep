Allow me to paint a picture for you a normal person growing up in a normal place, obviously as a kid this person gets some bumps and bruises but quite notably head injuries good job me. But most recently after another concussion things haven't been normal. 

Now the first time I noticed I was out on a walk with my dog who has recently disappeared well get to that soon, but as I was walking I had noticed a large grouping of geese up in the sky now I'm not stupid ok I know that geese migrate or whatever but this was more than usual but than over in the distance a darkness overwhelm everything around me and at that moment I had felt something that could be described as pure dread as if I was being watched. Before I had even noticed it had been minutes of me standing in the same spot and my dog had vanished just jus- fucking gone harness still attached to the leash and all around me I felt eyes burning in the back of my head even though there was no people there, but I swear there was something ducking in and out of the Tallgrass like a couple of goddamn Waccamole. 

I felt off balance on the way back home after that my search for my dog unsuccessful dragging the leash as I walk It felt almost as if there tension pulling on the leash I was almost numbed to everything due to what had just happened until this point, but I was always aware of the things watching me from I dont know where they thought they were out of sight maybe but it was always visible in my peripheral. I had almost gotten back when I heard the fakest fucking bark I have ever heard in my life and not a child pretending to be a dog barking no this was inhuman and it was right behind me I spin around as fast as my currently broken mind would let me and I only caught a glimpse of something moving away very quickly but what I saw clear as day was the leash drop a few feet as if something had been holding almost trying to fuck with me but because of the state of mind I thought I was going insane and it hurt my dog due to my negligence. 

But present day congrats your all caught up so I've talked to my doctor and we've changed my meds im not gonna go in depth on my mental health i dont think its truly relevant but I figure its gonna take awhile to go into affect cuz something is in my house but like I said changed meds now I'm gonna go hang up posters for the dog ill keep you in the know I guess. 

Ok what the actual fuck something is following behind me and ripping the posters down I dont understand this shouldn't happen anymore atleast thats what all the doctors have said but they clearly fucking lied, I stapled a poster to a pole and when I turned around it was gone only thing left of its existence being the staple and I went through my whole route again and every single one was gone I think I'll just try again tomorrow. 

You know this is getting quite overwhelming if I had to put a word on it after yesterday's poster incident though I guess its not all bad if I have to focus on the bright side of something whatever took my dog also decided to clean all the dog hair off her harness which is odd but I guess thats ok so when I do find her I can surprise her with that. but with head trauma comes headaches and in my case in feels like someone is banging symbols in my goddam head which Is quite ironic considering that thing that I mentioned before that was in my house somewhere is crashing fucking symbols what a goddamn comedian right I know these are in my head  but don't read my mind like that freaks me out but things with my new roommate don't seem to be all bad I suppose I vacuumed my living room floor mat I could never get the dog hair out of thing but lowe and behold its all gone. 

So same  day and now I'm freaked out and angry the mail arrived today the usual fliers that still take inside even though im never going to read them but today was different I had an urge to open the bundle of fantastic deals just for one of my posters to fall out now I have enough self confidence to admit when I've almost shit my pants and let me tell you this was one of those times because written on the poster was two words that struck absolute terror into me it said "we're real". Its been a couple of hours since then I've calmed down as much as someone in my situation could realized someone could have easily become aware of my health situations and had decided be funny cuz whats more funny than this right but I can't think rationaly he with this thing in my basement it seems banging on the door its so loud I can't hear my thoughts I need to sleep im exhausted. 

2 am the banging and cymbals in an awful harmony its so loud i wanna go down there but on the off chance you know no these fucking things are in my head no more I could go down there if I wanted but thats all I had for now I'm gonna try and sleep again. 

The basement door was open dents in the door as if it was smashed in I dont know whats real anymore everything is wrong everyone walks by staring at my house I dont know why I'm not religious but this feels like the wrath of God, a torture I dont deserve I can't deal with this at night I hear the cymbals and banging right outside my door I haven't gotten rest in so long im scared. last night I heard barking outside my window that same fake barking from before and I assumed that when I looked outside it would run away but it didn't it stood there no recognizable shape to its avoid of light body but a wide grin that never changed when it barked and then it screamed at deafening volume and banging on my door became so violent and what sounded like an orchestra of just goddamn noise right outside my door no from everywhere, I swear the door was about to fly off the hinges when it all stopped an even louder silence had overtaken my room now when a noise pierced my ears and the slight but always noticeable creek of my door opening and then the familiar sound of my dogs untrimmed nails clicking against the floor and then I was asleep.


Nobody fucking listens I went my doctor to discuss this he just said the same shit I can't call the cops they'd toss me in the loony bin hell maybe thats where I should be I dont know what to do is there a way out... 

ok I've figured it out I picked up a pistol just an old one my grandfather use to have if this keeps happening im killing these things or figuring out if its real ill keep you posted. Something is outside my bedroom door I hear breathing right outside and its talking to itself having a whole conversation with itself here I thought I was alone but then it yelled in my room "HEY" in my own voice a perfect mimic, my blood ran completely cold my heart beating out of my chest I'm not sure if I should talk to it to me but I did I said "what the fuck are you" "im armed" it said back to me "im me who the hell are you" how does it mimics my mannerisms as if reading my mind it spoke again "if your armed then open the door" now this is wrong i hate this I never wanted to actually use the gun this was just in I needed to need-d "look asshole I dont why you sound like me but there can't be two of me" I dont know what the hell is happening im scared no terrified am I real or a fuckin mimic I have memories but he might them to I dont know. 

This will be my last entry after this I have no idea what will happen but I have a theory if one of us dies him being the mimic it should be him then life stays the same and hopefully I can get back to normal again. He is me I dont know anymore do I have the right to live someone else's life I dont know im so lost im scared im sad "die i need to live" i wouldn't ever say anything like that would I I dont know anything anymore there cant be two of me and I shot my pistol. 

Well I lied that wasn't my last entry i should have listened to the doctors they were right the medicine just needed more time everything is great now but after that night it was a big wake up call I had clearly gone off the deep end and I haven't seen or heard anything since then but I see no reason to keep anymore of these so im putting this away forever there is no need for concern if anyone comes upon this.

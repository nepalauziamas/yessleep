7 months ago my TV broke because my cat pushed it and it fell. Since it was a cheap TV and was planning on buying a new one, I didn’t really mind it, she is cat after all.I checked on Google for TVs , which are Smart, so I can watch Netflix, YouTube,Twitter from my bed. Anyways, I found one on Amazon at the price of 10 dollars. I was like “That’s a scam!”. But I just wanted to test it out, hoping it won’t send me a toy TV or something scary like snake.The shipping info said it arrives in 5 days but it actually took 2 weeks. When the package came to my house, it looked pretty good, sealed ,original box,all the cables.Seemed pretty legit.I got in my house and made sure my cat doesn’t push this one too.When I turned it on, it was actually amazing, it looked exactly like an expensive.  SmartTV.Netflix and YouTube worked, had no twitter but i shrugged it off.

Later on I went to sleep and woke up at 3am with some eyes on the TV screen. I took the remote and it said “Eyes the movie” I was like “What did my cat do again” but no the cat was sleeping on my bed.Again I shrugged things off and when to sleep again. At 5am I woke up again with some eyes on the TV again.I thought it was my cat again but… the TV wasn’t even turned on, it broke. It didn’t work anymore but the eyes were still there.               


Later that day I checked the TV and it was broke, I threw it in the trash and when I came back in the house the TV was there again. I screamed my lungs off.I called the police asking if they could come to my house and see if there are any robbers.The police checked the whole house and there was nothing. From now on,my house was haunted by the TV, the seller of the TV blocked me. 


Every night the TV is watching me… I have nightmares about this TV and it seems like it’s merciless, how could someone do that to a person, a TV!? Why did someone invent this. I tried selling this but no luck,you can’t sell it, you can’t escape from it, nothing works. Once you have it you can’t stop it. I’ve tried switching houses with a friend but it keeps appearing in his house too. Please someone help me. I’m here in my house scared to sleep because of a TV. My cat is the only thing keeping me sane is my cat,which doesn’t notice the eyes. I bet if she does she will be traumatised. The sad part is that I won’t ever escape from the TV,except if I break it. Dont worry I’ve tried that too, no luck!I shouldn’t of been that greedy, I should’ve bought an expensive one,why, why me? I’m never buying cheap things again, never ever. My friend thinks it cool but it’s actually very horror, a TV watching you, how is that cool?

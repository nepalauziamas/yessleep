I decided to kill my wife when she threw out a half-full box of Frosted Flakes.

“No one eats them, Jim,” she sighed, rolling her eyes as she prepared her pre-sleep mug of chamomile. “It’s trash now.”

I stood my ground, narrowing my eyes. “You’re a heartless bitch,” I whispered.

She snapped her head toward me, stung like she’d been slapped. “What did you say?”

I folded my arms and grunted. “Nothing worth repeating.”

She eyed me a second longer before turning back to her tea. “You’ve seemed uptight recently, Jim. You should really work on yourself.”

I stared at the moon, a waxing Gibbous, and tried to smile. 

I gave up after five minutes.

I hated her.

I hated myself.

*

“How do you shoot the devil in the back? What if you miss?”

*The Usual Suspects* got a shit-ton of things exactly right, and that quote is at the top of their insights. 

I looked down at Sora, fast asleep, with only a thin undershirt to protect her from the knife in my hand. It seemed so simple and so hard all at once: only a few feet of empty space separated the blade from her heart, but years of marriage had formed an invisible boundary that was no less real despite its lack of physical manifestation.

I hated myself more.

Then I thought of the Frosted Flakes. I remembered the moon, and how I had no one to share its maria with. Hot anger squeezed sweat from my forehead and curled it around my brows to sting my eyes. I blinked. 

She sighed and turned over in her sleep.

Sora was unprotected because she wasn’t afraid of me. 

That sent me over the edge. I was weak because I believed it, and not vice versa. I raised the knife, lunging toward her like a wave of vomit inevitably rising from the gut.

I knelt on the bed.

The mattress squeaked and rolled, giving Sora the chance to turn over and strike at me. I pulled the knife back; one of her hands grabbed my wrist, and the other wrapped around my throat. I threw my weight backward, sending us both tumbling to the floor.

“I don’t hate you,” she hissed in my ear, “because I just can’t *feel* anything about you like I once did.” She tightened her freakishly strong grip on my neck and wrist; black spots appeared above her head. “It’s a shame, because at one point, you really were kind of okay.”

With a final heave of energy, I sprang my feet off the floorboards and pitched her upward.

Sora was unnaturally strong, but I still had 190 pounds on her 130.

The flip twisted her grip; with a final tearing pain, she released me.

Gagging and gasping, I rolled toward the windowsill, trying to pull myself into a standing position. 

But she grabbed my ankle and held fast. “You were never strong enough to walk away, Jim,” she hissed. “Don’t pretend that you’re ever going to grow that set of balls.”

I clutched the curtain in a white-knuckle grip, pulling against her hold on my leg. I hated myself, and I hated her.

I *hated*.

So I pulled, hard, on the curtain, feeling it rip, then tear, then the thrill of destruction as it shredded in my hands. I fell to the ground, the destroyed curtain in my grasp, and slammed against the floor.

Sora screamed.

Nausea hit me as I flipped over and saw that my knife had landed right beside her.

But everything changed when I realized it lay a corner of sunlight.

Sora scurried away, cradling a hand that was already erupting in blisters. 

I stared at my wife, panting and smiling. “You were awake, waiting to see what I would do.”

“You were planning to use the sun,” she growled, hatred etched into the lines of her face. “You’d never face me otherwise, because you still have no balls.”

I stepped into the light as warmth washed over me. “You’re a heartless bitch. That’s what I was saying earlier. I apologize for holding back.” My pulse throbbed in my ears as I was finally honest with myself. Now that the dam had broken, the words flowed, burning and healing. “I really don’t believe you have a soul.”

“Do you *really* not realize that you’re affected by a thousand hard choices someone else had to make for you?” she spat. “It wasn’t easy,” she pressed, wiping her eye with a trembling hand. “But it’s the way my kind harvests strength,” she pressed in a softer voice. “I *explained* this a dozen times, Jim.”

“You ate her *alive*, Sora,” I growled. 

“And I’ll live ten times longer than she ever would have.” She cocked her head. “It’s the way of things.”

My hands balled into involuntary fists. “You could have consumed anyone.” My voice shook.

“No one’s body could have given me that much strength-”

“She was your fucking daughter! She was *my* fucking daughter!” Spit flew from my mouth. I couldn’t stop shaking. 

“A harder sacrifice means a bigger payoff,” she answered in a near whisper. 

Nausea threatened to tear me apart, but I kept my eyes level. “Which is why it’s going to be so gratifying to make you suffer in your last moments.” I folded my arms close to my chest. “I’ll see you soon, honey.”

I closed my eyes, and thoughts of Kara rushed into my head despite my efforts to keep them at bay. 

*Frosted Flakes are like Corn Flakes after they invented flavor.* 

*Was the moon discover by a man who loved Maria?*

*Why does Mom act like she loves me sometimes, but not others?*

I didn’t look at her, because I knew I’d try to kill her and die in the attempt. Instead, I reached for the bedroom door. 

“Wait, Jim,” she breathed. 

“If there were a chance to get her back, who would you be willing to [hurt](https://www.facebook.com/P-F-McGrail-181784199029462/)?”

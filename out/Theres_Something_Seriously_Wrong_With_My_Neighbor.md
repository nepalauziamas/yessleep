I don’t have much time to explain, So I’ll try to give as much detail as I can.

 I live in a small neighborhood located on the outskirts of Arizona and I barely interact with others. Some people see me as being antisocial and have tried to get me out and experience more of what life has to offer. It was all annoying and very stressful at times, but after a while I guess you can say I opened up more. I began to communicate more with others and eventually found myself being invited out to parties and other local events. 

Fast forward a few months. It is now December and the holidays is now upon us, and this year I felt like doing something different. Instead of sitting at home and treating these upcoming days like any other, I decided to invite some people over to spend time with for the holiday. Though it was out of my comfort zone, I felt good about my decision. Only problem was I didn’t know much about my neighbors. Sure I talked and went out with them from time to time but I don’t remember any of them talking about their personal life. So when I called up some friends from the neighborhood, they all had something to do with their families or already had other plans scheduled. This sorta bummed me out but I didn’t let it affect me too much. 

Later that day, It was about 5:30 Pm and the sun was just beginning to set. I was sitting on my couch watching the fire as I sipped my freshly brewed tea. As I sat there, I noticed it was quite lonely, so I decided to play some music on my phone in attempt to get into the holiday spirit. After a few minutes of tapping my foot and bopping my head to the songs, the sound of a loud and aggressive knock came from my front door. My body froze, however it wasn’t from fear. (We didn’t get any suspicious happenings around here so this hardly gave me a scare) I turned down the music and approached the door. “Who is it?” I questioned as I grabbed the handle. There was no response and I know I should’ve just asked again or just simply not open the door at all, but Unfortunately I wasn’t thinking and opened it anyways. 

Standing in front of the doorway was a awfully tall man. He had to be about 6’2 at least. I myself am 5’10 so maybe it was just my height. His hair was a mess and his clothing seemed worn down. “Uh…Hello? Can I help you with something?” The man didn’t respond. He just stood there, swaying slightly back and forth. I swear it felt like I was standing in that doorway for hours. He took one last sway forward before stopping in a weird, awkwardly way. The way he stopped was quite unnatural and a little impressive so to say. To give you an example, think of the dance move Michael Jackson does when he stands on his toes, only difference is that he was still flat on his feet, with his legs stretched out and his face just inches away from mine. I pulled my head back and put a hand on his shoulder. “Listen um…If you don’t need anything, than I advice you to move on.” I gave him a slight push on his shoulder and when doing this, the man’s head quickly twitched towards my hand. He then leaned back into a normal upright stance. 

Again, complete silence. After a few seconds, maybe 10 or so, the man pulled back his hair to reveal his eyes. Giving me a clear view of his entire face. The man was well shaved and had a huge grin. His eyes were severely widened and he slowly opened his mouth as if he was going to speak. I burst out in a stern voice. “Alright, I think it’s time for you to get off my-“ “Oh, my apologies. I was just strolling around the neighborhood and realized you were the only one home. No family to go to?” I squinted at the man before responding. “No, Just me. Though if that’s all you have to ask then I suggest you be on your way.” The man looked above my head into my house, surveying the inside before turning to look down the street. “You see that house down there, right behind the other two? That’s where I stay. I hardly take walks like this for the others never seem willing to speak to me. Except, well you of course.” At this point I didn’t know what to say. All I really could do was stand there in confusion. “Oh, I guess I haven’t properly introduced myself, my name is-“ “Just get the hell off my property.” The man stared. “Hm?” I don’t know what began to set me off so much but I was fed up and wanted him to leave. “You heard me, get the hell out of here.” The man’s grin disappeared and instead was replaced by a deep frown, clearly filled with irritation. “Very well then.” He turned around and walked off down the street, towards the direction of his home. I closed my door and sat back down. Too frustrated to continue playing music. I sighed as I rubbed my eyes. 

It was about 2 hours later and it was now completely dark outside. I must’ve dozed off cause I remember quickly opening my eyes and sitting up to see that the fire was out and the house was completely dark. I reached over to turn on the lamp beside my couch and as soon as the light switched on, it switched right back off. “Huh?” I tried turning it back on countless of times before getting up and trying other switches. None of the lights were turning on and i assumed the power was out. I put on my shoes and coat and went out the back door to check the fuse box. Normally in some places, the box will be in the basement but for mines, it sat right behind my house attached to the wall. 

I opened the panel and squinted as I flicked multiple switches back and forth. As I was doing this, I felt the feeling of being watched. I stopped what I was doing and turned around to see the man standing about a couple yards away. Now, there is a set of woods behind my house and they aren’t that deep but it takes about 10 minutes to travel through. The man stood there right in front of them, back facing towards me. After analyzing and making sure it was him and not some random, I shook my head and turned back to the fuse. “Weirdo.” After flicking one of the switches, a giant spark burst out from the box. “Shit…” I muttered. Covering my face from the sparks. 

I turned to observe my surroundings, refusing to face the box out of frustration. That’s when I locked eyes with him. The man was now facing in my direction, same frown as before after telling him to leave. This creeped me out a bit but I still didn’t let it get to me. “Still here huh?” No response. Instead, his frown turned into a wide, inhuman, ear to ear smile and his eyes widened even more than before. “What the fuck?” 

The man darted in my direction. His body slightly hunched forward and his arms spread out as if he was ready to embrace me in a big bear hug. His fingers were bent and I could see a few veins form through the skin on his forehead. The speed he was running at wasn’t normal, it wasn’t even something you’d see from an Olympic runner. It was more of a superhuman type of speed. 

After a few seconds, I finally gain the control to move and haul ass back inside. I slammed the door shut and locked it immediately. “What the hell was that?” I stepped away from door, backing up into my living room. I don’t think I took my eyes off the door for even a second.

“Let me in.” The man’s voice came from the window by the front door. His voice was deep, raspy and made my blood curdle. I was afraid to turn around. I imagined seeing his face, pressed up against the window, same inhuman like smile and wide eyes. But when I turned…he wasn’t there. “Let me in.” Again, I heard his voice. This time it came from the window by the back door. This continued on for about 15 more seconds before I yelled out, “WHAT THE HELL DO YOU WANT FROM ME!?” I stormed towards the door and swung it open, ready to attack whatever was behind it. Immediately, an aggressive breeze passed by me and into my house. I looked around and the man was nowhere to be found. I closed the door and stomped over to the back and opened it with the same movement as before. Nothing. After closing the door I walked back into my living room, grabbed my phone and did what I should’ve done at the very beginning. Dial 911. It took a few rings for them to finally pick up. When they did, I didn’t give them any time to speak. “Hello? There’s a crazed man outside and I need you guys to send somebody out quick.” Silence. For about a second, it felt as if nobody was on the other end. That’s when I heard his breathing.

“I’m inside your house.” The phone fell out of my hand as I felt a strong, sinister presence behind me. I hurried and ran upstairs to my room. I grabbed my laptop that sat on my dresser and slammed the door, jumping into the closet behind a set of clothes. 

It’s been about 45 minutes and I can still hear him. Moving around, whispering, calling out to me with laughter. He’s getting closer and It won’t be long before he finds me. Calling the police didn’t work so I’m hoping this message will. I can hear his footsteps getting louder, heavier and his voice turning into a more demonic tone. At this point it sounds like he’s crawling on the walls, or is it the ceiling? He’s right outside my door now. He’s muttering something. From what I hear it sounds like a chant.

Please, if anyone finds this, send help. I don’t think I have much time left. God help me.

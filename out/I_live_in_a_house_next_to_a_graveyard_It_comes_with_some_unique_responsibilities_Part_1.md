"Hey, Alice", my mother's voice came from the speaker as soon as I played the voice message she had left earlier. "We just wanted to know how you're doing. You haven't called in a while. Are the renovations going well? I'm sorry we can't help you with the work... but your father is finally getting better. The doctor says the infection is gone and he's on his way to a full recovery. Don't worry, I won't let him do any work around the house any time soon. Okay, so... call back soon, yes? We love you!"

Sighing, I deleted the message and put the phone away. It was good to hear that my dad was recovering, but I still had no desire to talk to them right now. It would just mean more half-assed lies and I wasn't fond of lying to my parents.

I knew I would eventually have to tell them the truth. The actual reason why I had left the big city to live on a farm in the middle of nowhere, in a village whose name nobody would recognize even if I were to mention it right now. For now I had been lying to them, claiming something about a job opportunity and a house that needed to be renovated and that I'd prefer that they'd visit only after that renovations were all done.

I'd stick to this lie as long as possible, and now I didn't want to think about how I would deal with the eventual conversation. I had more urgent problems.

I finished my breakfast and went to change my clothes to get ready for the daily work. My home was a farm, after all, and while I paid a bunch of teenagers from the village to help me out, I liked to do some of the work by myself. It was calming. Distracting from the more unpleasant things.

I was just done changing into short pants and a sleeveless top when my phone rang once more. Not expecting my mom to call again just yet, I picked it up from the bed and twisted my lips immediately into a frown when I saw the name Ben Grant on the display. "Good morning", I greeted the cop, already dreading what he could want that early in the morning.

"One of your freaks escaped, Shepherd", he told me instead of a greeting. "We trapped it in Mr. Clarke's shop, so hurry a little."

"What?" Now that was something that wasn't supposed to happen. Literally. I'd been told that the Inhumans would't leave the property and until now, none of them had attempted to do so. Having one of them just run off was a worst case scenario I hadn't even considered. I silently prayed that it was at least one of the sane ones.

"The freak with the open stomach tried to run amok", he repeated impatiently. "Get your ass over here, Shepherd, before it kills someone."

Of course it was the Gutless. Of fucking course. "I'm on my way, okay?", I hissed, annoyed how rude he was. It wasn't my fault, I had been asleep and even if I had been aware that the Inhumans could run off, I couldn't possibly monitor all of them the entire time. "Just give me a few minutes."

"Just hurry", he told me again and disconnected the call.

"Asshole", I muttered under my breath. Ben was a local cop that was basically asigned to me, the one who had to bother with everything that involved Inhumans, and it was obvious that he loathed the job. I didn't exactly like working with him either and was rather glad that we didn't need to interact all too often, but I still tried to be polite, at least.

Either way, I had an Inhuman to bring back home.

So, time for some explanation. I live in the house next to the graveyard. It's a nice farmhouse with lots of surrounding land that belonged to it. There were some fields in front of the house where I grew several different vegetables and fruits to sell to the local grocery store, and a small forest encased the property. Not too deep in the woods hid a murky lake, and not too far from the right side of the house was the town's graveyard.

As far as I was aware, the property was home to seven Inhumans. That was the catch. I lived in this beautiful house, received money from the town for simply being here and the only thing I had to do in return was look after the entities that inhabited the land. To prevent them from hurting anyone.

And apparently I was failing at this simple task already.

As soon as my conversation with Ben was over, I grabbed my bag and rushed downstairs. I didn't like the cop and I absolutely didn't like to follow his orders, but he had a point, I had to get the Gutless and bring it back to the farm before it could seriously hurt someone. Without a concrete idea how to deal with the Inhuman, I grabbed a huge knife from my kitchen to use as a makeshift weapon. Better than nothing, I thought.

I stepped outside on the porch and then down on the dirt road that led from the farmhouse straight towards the town. There was a metal gate that seperated the farm and the graveyard from the town and I was walking straight towards it – it would take about ten minutes to walk from the gate to the town – when I noticed a statue right next to the road.

It was a life-sized statue of a woman, dressed in a flowing dress. Her face, as well as any hair she might have possessed, was hidden under a helmet and in her right hand was a long, straight sword which she held in front of her body in an almost defensive posture. She was made of metal, but only small patches revealed the bronze colour she'd once been, since she and her weapon were almost entirely covered in rust.

I'd simply named her "the Statue" and I hated the way she moved around the property sometimes.

"Good morning", I wished the Statue in passing, mainly because I was very afraid of that thing and I wanted to stay on its good side. Yes, it felt ridiculous. Yes, I was too afraid to stop doing that.

As always, the Statue didn't react and I simply walked past it, towards the iron gate where yet another familiar figure was already waiting for me. It seemed like my entities wanted to torture me today.

Well, to be fair, not all of my Inhumans were monsters. About half of them were sane, I could talk to them and they didn't try to murder me on sight. I'd even say that I liked them. Mostly.

Out of the three that were sane enough to talk to, two had actual names. They had yet to tell me how that had come to be, but in the end it mattered little as it didn't seem to change anything. Actually, I liked these two most. I'll tell you about Angel in another post; let's focus on the other right now.

He was the one to look the most human. A man in his early thirties, with dark blond hair and almost black eyes. His skin was pallid, white like paper, and black veins shone through the thin barrier, hinting at the black blood that flowed through his body. He wore black pants and a dark blue shirt, just as always. These things seemed incapable of change – well, all except for one of them, but you'll meet her later.

Right now, Karth leaned against the metal gate, smirking as he twisted a long, sharp piece of metal between his fingers. "I heard you lost one of your lambs, Shepherd", was the first thing he said to me that day.

I rolled my eyes. "Very funny. And *of course* you know that already. Do you have anything to do with this?"

"And just why would I do anything to provoke your anger, princess?"

I was torn between telling him to stop calling me princess and explaining that he was a pain in my ass at any given possibility, but there were more urgent matters. "Listen, I'm in a bit of a hurry right now, so if you could annoy me another time..."

He took a step towards me and we were suddenly very close. There was still this cocky grin on his lips and I forced myself to look straight into his eyes, not daring to move or look away. The world stood still for several seconds until he lifted his hand and offered me the metal pole. "You'll need this."

"For what?" Still, I hesitantly took to pole from him and my hand brushed briefly against his cold, clammy one.

"To bring your lost lamb back, of course", he told me casually. "Good luck, princess." And with that, he wandered off and I couldn't help but stare at him until he had disappeared between the trees, wondering what had just happened.

I shook my head to clear my thoughts, tightened my grip around the metal pole and hurried through the gate, towards the town's center.

There wasn't as much of a commotion around Mr. Clarke's shop as I had expected. Actually, the only people around were Mr. Clarke himself and his wife, as well as their young son, two other couples who I was pretty sure lived nearby, an older man, and of course Officer Benjamin Grant.

"Shepherd", he called me over. He wore his usual uniform, the blue almost ridiculously dark against his pale, freckled skin. His cap sat tilted atop his short, red hair and his thin lips were, as always, twisted into a frown. "Took your time to get here."

"Well, I'm here now, aren't I?", I hissed back. "So, is it still in the shop or not?"

"Still in there, with the family's dog." His eyes flickered to the metal pole in my hand. "Are you gonna beat the freak up with that?"

I honestly hated that he refered to my Inhumans as freaks. I assume the term was technically correct, but it felt wrong. Disrespectful. Sure, I wasn't always the epitomy of politeness when interacting with them, but it still rubbed me the wrong way.

"Wanna explain my job to me, Grant?", I replied to his question. I wished I could have given him an actual answer to shut him up, but I still had no idea what the pole was for. I just assumed it was important.

Grant just shrugged. "Whatever, you're the expert. Just get rid of that thing, one way or another."

"That's the plan." With that, I approached the shop, looking way more confident than I actually felt. I liked my Inhumans, really, but they were still dangerous, especially the more monstrous ones like the Gutless. When I had to deal with them on my property, I usually took Angel (or Karth, if I absolutely had to) with me, so facing that thing all alone in an empty shop didn't sound too appealing.

I considered taking my knife out of my bag, but chose to stick with my metal pole instead. Karth was a pain in the ass sometimes, but I was pretty certain he didn't want me dead and he tended to be decently helpful, so I decided to trust him here.

I walked up to the Clarke family that stood next to the entrance for a short chat – mostly me apologizing for this incident and promising that I would take the Inhuman away. They were nice enough. Like most people in the town, they were friendly, polite, but always a little wary around me. Not scared, no, that would be an overstatement by far, but they were cautious. Eyeing me as if they feared I could turn into one of my monsters at any given moment.

Mr. Clarke unlocked the door for me and I stepped inside the shop, fingers wrapped painfully tight around my pathetic weapon. My rapid heartbeat echoed in my ears, drowning out the low noises inside the building for a few moments. I stood there, looking around the dimly lit hallways, dreading to see what I was here for. When I couldn't find him right away, I forced myself to move further into the shop, towards the wet munching noise I could hear in the back.

My footsteps were unusually loud in the silence. Besides the noise that most likely came from the Gutless, there was only the soft hum of the air conditioning to keep me company. I forced myself to breathe steadily and move forward, fully aware that if I were to stop now, I would probably change my mind and leave instead. This was what I was getting paid for. I had to do this.

I walked around a shelf and that was where I found my lost monster.

The Gutless was an ugly thing honestly. Humanoid, in the most basic sense. It possessed two arms and two legs, a torso and a head, like any human would, but the similarities ended there. Sickly grey skin stretched tightly over bones, where eyes would have been were black voids, a lipless mouth hid crooked, rotting teeth. And, of course, the entire torso was split open, revealing that his body was empty, lacking any intestines.

It was hunched over the corpse of a small dog when I found it, tearing the animal's guts out with its boney fingers and shoving them into its mouth. I had to choke back vomit as I watched the gruesome display.

"Hey!", I called out. The Gutless turned its head around and I thought that its face looked paler than usual. It made the most disgusting sound and bent over to throw up a bloody pulp. "Ew, fuck!", I cursed and took a step backwards, away from the mess it had just made, while the monster kept coughing for a moment.

It rose to its feet slowly, taking its time to regain the balance it apparently lacked, and started to stumble towards me, blood still dripping from its face. "Back off!", I told the monster, but it didn't care. It reached for me and I stumbled backwards again, to stay away from its grip. "I said back off!", I repeated, attempting to sound confident and failing miserably. My voice was shaking almost as much as my hands.

The Gutless reached out again and I jerked my hands upwards to bring the metal pole between us. One of its hands brushed against the metal and it hissed in pain, took a hurried step back and curled up the tiniest bit.

I sighed in relief. Karth was an asshole, but at least he was a reliable asshole.

"Hurts, hm?" I waved the pole around. "Want me to stab you with that thing?"

It hissed, bared its teeth like a rabid animal.

"Okay, cool. I won't. As long as you come back home. And you'll *behave* now, understood?" My voice was still trembling. I held the metal so tightly that my fingernails dug deep into the palm of my hand.

When I didn't get any reaction from the monster, I slowly approached it. It didn't move, so I felt confident to grab it by its arm – which was thin enough that my hand could wrap around it easily – and pointed one end of the pole towards its body. "We're going now. One wrong move and you'll have this in your shoulder."

I pulled the monster out of the shop, where the townspeople were still waiting. The young son of the Clarkes screamed as he saw the Gutless and hid its face behind his hands while his mother immediately knelt down to comfort him. I didn't exactly feel pity for him. More so annoyance at the parents for letting a child stay here, given that they were fully aware of what was to come. Without a word to the Clarke family, I turned around to head back to the farm, so the Gutless couldn't do any more damage.

"Shepherd!", Grant called to me and approached us. "Well done."

But I really didn't care for praise, especially not from him. I had monster right next to me, which could snap at any given moment, and I wasn't confident in my ability to keep it from going on a rampage, crazy metal weapon or not. "I'd stay back if I were you", I replied.

The cop looked back and forth between the monster and me, then shrugged. "Whatever. I'll take care of the family then."

"Have fun", I muttered under my breath, tightened my grip around the monster's arm and finally made my way back home.

The Gutless behaved weirdly, I thought. It had never been predictable to begin with, but I had never seen it like that. Off balance, struggling to stay on its feet, stopping once or twice during the short walk to cough up more blood and gore. It was almost pathetic. And had it been a little less monstrous, a little less horrifying to look at, I might have even felt bad for it.

We arrived at the gate that seperated my property from the rest of the town, but I didn't get the chance to relax just yet. Because just behind the gate, yet another Inhuman was already waiting for me.

I said before that the Inhumans seemed incapable of change. The Gravelady, ever changing in her appearance, was the exception of this apparent rule.

She was probably the least dangerous of my entities, considering that I hadn't seen her being hostile towards a living thing. She was sane, usually polite and even helpful, but I still hated dealing with her simply because I couldn't stand the sight of her.

All of her was too much. Too many eyes, limbs, teeth. Most of her body was hidden under grey robes, but the fabric did nothing to hide the many arms that were attached to her body. The number kept changing, but on this day I counted nine in total, all with multiple joints, twisting in the oddest directions. The hands possessed more fingers than there should be space for. She had four legs currently, as far as I could tell. Her face was split into three parts, the largest being sickly grey and slightly wrinkled, a smaller one stained slightly pinkish, and the last one dark as a stark contrast to the other patches. There were three eyes – two dark brown ones and one bright blue, located in her cheek under the left one. They never blinked in sync.

She never stayed the same for long. Parts of her kept rotting and she cut them off to replace them with newer parts. Parts from the corpses she dug up from their graves, only to crudely sew them onto herself.

The Gravelady was what would have happened if Dr. Frankenstein hadn't tried to create a man, but had aimed for an eldrich god instead.

Her appearance, and the stench of rotting meat that followed her every step, never failed to make me nauseous.

Still holding onto the Gutless, I approached the entity. She rarely ever left the graveyard, so I figured this was rather important and probably bad. "What were you thinking?", she asked coldly as we came closer and I wondered what I had done wrong when I noticed that all her three eyes were focused not on me but on the monster next to me.

Two of her arms reached out and grabbed the Gutless' arms harshly. I quickly let go off it and took a step back, hoping to get out of harms way. "You had to test your limits, didn't you?", she continued, still absurdly calm. "Didn't it hurt? Didn't you feel the pull of your chains with every step you took?"

The Gutless struggled against her grip, but she didn't yield. Another hand came forward and grabbed it by its throat, while yet another produced a large butcher knife from somewhere in her robes. The Gutless screeched and bared its teeth in a pathetic attempt of intimidation as it desperately tried to free itself.

It was like a car crash. I didn't want to see what would follow, but I couldn't bring myself to look away either when the Gravelady lifted her knife and cut the Gutless' hands both clean of in a single swing. They hit the grass with a low thump and the Gutless let out a bloodcurling scream of agony.

I forced myself to breathe steadily and to look anywhere but the severed hands on the floor, in a weak attempt to keep myself from throwing up.

"This is your own fault", the Gravelady said calmly. "Don't worry, you will get new ones if you behave." Another hand held needle and thread already and she sewed the bleeding stumps shut with crude, but efficient stitches. "Let this be a lesson." She finished her work quickly and let go off the wimpering entity as soon as the last stitch was done. The Gutless looked at her and let out a final hiss before turning away and running off towards the forest.

The Gravelady turned to me then, while one of her ridiculously long arms – one with five joints – picked the hands off the now bloodstained ground. "I apologize, Alice. He is very... simple minded. Sometimes the likes of him have to be reminded of their limits. I assure you, this incident won't repeat any time soon."

Now that was a relief. I didn't like the Gravelady all too much, but I had to acknowledge that she held some position of power over the other entities although I had yet to figure out what exactly that meant. If she told me that this wouldn't happen again, I believed her. "Thanks", I replied with a pained smile, still fighting the nausea that had built up during the gruel display. "So... you're gonna... take these with you?" I gestured towards the hands he had picked up.

"Unless you have any use for them?"

For a moment, I seriously stood there and contemplated what uses I could possibly find for a severed hand before realizing how utterly bizarre the situation was. "No, thanks", I answered and that, too, felt so utterly ridiculous that I a hysterical giggle escaped my lips before I could stop myself.

The Gravelady didn't seem to care about how on edge I was. "Very well." She nodded and hid the hands somewhere in her robes. "I shall leave then. If you need me, Alice, you know where to find me."

Only when she was out of sight I finally allowed myself to bend over and throw up on the ground.

The rest of the day progressed fairly normal. The Inhumans kept their usual distance and I got the chance to clean up around the house and help my employees. Only after the sun had already set, I returned into the house and began cooking a simple dinner. It didn't take too long and soon enough I placed two plates on a tray and carried it upstairs to the bedroom.

The air inside the room was hot and humid and reeking of sweat. I frowned as I stepped inside and closed the door behind me, looking at the person that lay on the bed. He was pale as a corpse, his dark hair clung in wet strands to his skin, he was barely more than skin and bone and there were dark shadows under his feverish eyes. He wore a dark pajama that hung loosely from his frail stature.

"Hey", I greeted my husband softly. "How are you today?"

"Better." He smiled a weak smile. "I think the fever is lower." A coughing fit betrayed his little lie and small red specks appeared on the white blanket. "Sorry."

"Stop the constant apologizing." I placed the tray in his lap. "Grilled vegetables. It's not much, but..."

"It's amazing, love", he interrupted me. "Thank you."

I smiled at him and walked over to the window. "You need some fresh air", I declared and opened it to let the warm summer night's air in. It was ridiculously hot here already, even after sunset the air still seemed to burn.

I climbed into the bed then, settled next to him as comfortably as possible and grabbed one of the plates from the tray. "How was your day, love?", he asked me, reaching out with one cold hand to hold mine.

And I began to tell him, of course, about all the things that had happened on this crazy day, hoping my stories would distract him from his condition for a while.

My husband was very sick, with a disease that no doctor could cure. It took him slowly, a fever burning his body from the inside out, and there was no way to tell how much time he had left. He wasn't able to leave his bed anymore, so it was my duty to take care of him, of the house, of the Inhumans. And I would continue to do so until our time ran out.

I didn't mind, honestly. I loved him and I was thankful for every moment we could spend together, so taking care of him didn't bother me at all. After all, I dreaded the moment I would enter this room and find him dead. I didn't even want to think about it yet.

We rarely ever talked about his sickness. It was the elephant in the room that we both avoided whenever possible. We knew what we needed to know, after all. There was no cure and he would die. It wasn't something that needed to be discussed daily.

Today, however, the topic came up. "I want us to have a child, love", he told me while picking at his dinner. "I want a... legacy. I want you to..." Another coughing fit interrupted him. "I want you to have something from me when I'm gone."

What could I have done instead of crying after hearing that.

He waited patiently for me to calm down, doing his best to comfort me. It took a few minutes before I regained my composure and when I did, he flashed an apologetic smile. "Could you close the window?", he asked. "I'm a bit cold."

I wondered how he could possibly be cold in this suffocating heat, but I stood up nonetheless and walked over to the window. Down on the ground stood the Statue, her head bent upwards to stare directly at the window I currently stood in front of, and it made a shiver run down my spine.

With a last fearful glance at the Inhuman, I shut it and turned back to the bed. "Let's have a child", I agreed. I knew it was probably a bad idea, considering our home and his condition, but I couldn't bring myself to deny his dying wish. But for the first time in ages, I saw him genuinely happy and to me, that was worth it.

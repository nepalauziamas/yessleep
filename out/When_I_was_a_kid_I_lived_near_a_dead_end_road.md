Every time we would drive past it, no one ever seemed to notice how much darker the sky was down there. I remember always wondering what was at the end of a dead end road, and today was the day I was going to find out. My cousins often teased me of being a “scaredy-cat,” but not anymore. 
My grandparents scolded me, don’t be out too late. Riding a bike on this road is dangerous, especially at night. I decided to take off, and find out for myself if the rumors were true- I had heard my family whispering at dinner, that the lonely lady that lived in the single house on the dead end road had died. I didn’t think anything of it, even as a child I knew that rumors were just rumors. But as I approached the sign, I realized I had a lump in my throat and hairs standing on the back of my neck. I let my foot rest on the road as I prepared to petal down the street. I looked up, the sun was still straight above. I had plenty of time before nightfall to find out what was truly at the end. 

For what’s supposed to be a short street, it seemed like I was peddling for hours. The trees were growing taller, and I was becoming more and more nervous as I saw the dark yellow house in the distance. Everything was so quiet. No birds chirping, no horns honking. Just the sound of the wind blowing through the trees and the squeak of my rusty bike making it’s way. It was the only house, and it was the end of the road. 

Finally- I had arrived. The front door was wide open. I left my bike in a pile of leaves that couldn’t have crunched louder when I walked to the stairs. 

“H-hello?” My voice was weak. Everything was dark. A few curtain-less windows had let some sunlight seep in. I could smell the trash that hadn’t been taken out, and my nose curled up. I found myself staring at another open door, leading to the back.  
Here, was a hidden lake. I never knew it was there. It was beautiful, the scenery of the quiet trees and the calm water reflecting the sky. I thought it was extremely peaceful, that is until I looked at it’s center. 
A lady was crawling out. 
“Hello?” I called out again. I heard the cracking of her bones as she forced her head up to make eye contact with me. Her skin was decaying, her eye sockets were empty yet I could feel her staring right through me. I ran back through the house and hopped on my bike. As I pedaled back through the trees, I noticed it was pitch black out. I could see the moon seeping through the trees. 
‘That’s impossible,’ I thought, ‘I was only there for 5 minutes’
I pedaled as fast as my legs would allow, as I heard the wet pitter patter of her feet gaining on me. 
pat.. pat.. pat.. PAT PAT PAT PAT
It sounded like she was directly behind me, but I didn’t think even for a moment to turn around and look. 
I didn’t stop until I reached my grandparents house where I locked the door and looked out the window without speaking a word. 
“Where have you been?” 
“The [dead end road.](https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/shadows-of-the-playground-jacob-grant/1142485841?ean=9798823130493)” I said, as I saw a single puddle of water at the end of the driveway.

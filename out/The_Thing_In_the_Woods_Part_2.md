Hey. I’m back. I just got off a plane and I’m at the airport. Ever since I’ve arrived I’ve been feeling a little paranoid. I know it’s probably just nervousness but I can just feel something is off. I have the feeling something is watching me, but everytime I look around nothing is there.

   I just checked into my hotel and I saw something on tiktok. It’s called a skinwalker. Usually skinwalkers will imitate human noises. This thing imitated a human whistle, if its real, of course. I think I might be dealing with a skinwalker here. I am going to do more research about this later.

   Okay. I’m approaching my house now. I did some more research and I found out that skinwalkers will imitate noises they heard before, whether it’s a cry for help, or in this case, whistling. I'm starting to really believe that this thing is real. 

   I’m here. It looks like it’s in good condition but there’s nobody that lives here. No cars, door wide open, and when I yelled for someone no one answered. I stepped inside. As soon as my foot touched the ground the stench of mold and sewage made me gag. Although the outside of the house looked nice the interior of the house was complete shit. There were empty beer bottles, cigarette butts, and a bunch of cobwebs. I went to my bedroom which appeared to be the only part of the house untouched.

   I don’t know why but as soon as I stepped into my room I got chills on the back of my spine and I could feel adrenaline being pumped into my veins. I grabbed a simple toy, a stuffed bear, then went back to the car. Next destination. The canyon.

I stopped the car outside the park and stepped out. I walked through the entrance to the park, terrified. I enter the park and it looks just how I remembered it. A big grass field with a little playground to the right of it. I walked down the field and to the entrance of the canyon.

   I squeeze the teddy bear as hard as I can as I walk into the canyon. The canyon is still littered with beer bottles. I reached the bottom of the canyon. I look around. I see the ball I so desperately looked for when I was 5, under a bush, and chuckled. Then I hear it. That damned 4 note tuned whistle. I slowly look behind me terrified. I see nothing. I look back in front of me and see it crouched behind the bush. I dropped the teddy bear and sprinted out of there, but it didn’t chase me. 

   I called my boss and told him I can’t do the work trip because of exhaustion. He was mad but understanding. I flew back home but couldn’t get rid of the feeling that something was watching me. As soon as I arrived home I fell asleep instantly.

   I had a nightmare. I was 5 again and back at my old house. I was walking around the canyon when someone started yelling.

   “Help! Oh god someone help me!”

   I ran to where I heard it, my 5 year old self determined to help him. I reached an opening and the yelling stopped. I walked around.

   “Hello? Is anyone there?” I yelled.

   “Over here.” The person croaked. 

   “Where?” I asked.

   “Over here!” He yelled angrily.

   This time I recognized that it came from a nearby bush. I ran over and as soon as I reached the bush the thing came from behind it. It grabbed my arm and squeezed it tight. I screamed and woke up. It was about 7. I thought that it was just a nightmare till I noticed the big bruise on my arm.

   Since I ditched my work trip I don’t have any work for the next 2 weeks or so. I decided to go grocery shopping. I swore everytime I took a turn I saw it hiding in a bush or behind a tree. I’m starting to see it everywhere. 

   I went to sleep with no dream. I woke up in the middle of the night. I got up to get a glass of water. While I was drinking I heard the 4 note tuned whistle. I dropped the glass, glass shattering everywhere and water getting all over the floor and my clothes. I ran to my garage. I grabbed matches, gasoline, and my 12 gauge shotgun.

   I ran to my room. I pointed my shotgun at the door. When it walked in I was going to shoot its head off then burn this house to the ground. I heard footsteps outside the door, but then they stopped. Before he came in I quickly grabbed a buck knife from one of my drawers and stuffed it into my pocket. I went back and kept my shotgun pointed at the door. Silence. Complete and utter silence.

   “Come on in bitch! I’m not scared of you!” I yelled.

   Nothing. Then I hear a tapping noise. It’s under my bed. As soon as I realize this I can feel it grab my ankles. It’s started to pull me under the bed. I dropped my shotgun in fear and screamed. I fell on the ground. I grab the knife from my pocket, open it up, and throw it at the things head. It landed in his skull with a sickening thud and black blood oozed from the wound. It let go of me just enough for me to get up and grab the shotgun. I shoot it in the head. Black blood splatters everywhere. I poured gasoline in the room, lit a match, and burned the house to the ground.

   I saw on the news that they were looking for the person who burned down my house. They don’t know it was me. I’m currently hiding out in a hotel. I’ve been here for about 2 days. I think it’s gone. Only problem is that this morning, the baseball and teddy bear were on the desk next to the bed.

[Three Dead Wolves.](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/wg2sxm/three_dead_wolves/)

In some parts of the woods, the difference between life and death is often just four well-built walls. That’s it. A front door and a lock is all that separates you from Pale Death and a puckered butt. There’s lots of ways it can happen. Most people blame animals, but the cold is a more likely murderer. When you can feel the freeze on the other side of your skin, when you can’t cough it out of your lungs, you’ll know that's about halfway there. That’s when you remember the importance of those four walls. That’s when you enthusiastically cuss the fuck who burned them down. 

We didn’t have food that morning. We didn’t have fresh water within a mile. We didn’t even have a reliable weapon, outside of a pistol who’s handle burned a hole into the snow burrows. Susan spent the better part of the morning fishing it out. I kept trying the radio. 

“Hi. This is the rangers from the burned down cabin calling again. Can anybody get the hell down here?”

The first two or three conversations were hopeful. Dispatch claimed the storm should blow over by evening. We just needed to hunker down for a few more hours. Then they called back and said a chopper was damaged. After that they wanted us to wait a day. 

After that - the radio died. 

We tried salvaging some gear from the fire. Sue found a jacket and some other clothing that managed to dodge the flames. I found a tin water bottle and a rusted Bowie knife. Everything else was torched or smoldering. I couldn’t believe the awful luck.

“We need to get away from high ground,” she chirped. “We’re sitting ducks out here.”

I thought about that for a long while before answering. I didn’t love the idea of leaving the campsite. Without the radio, we had no way to contact the rescue crews who expected us to be in that spot. But the point about cover did have some merit. The Park Service cut and maintained a thirty feet diameter around the cabin. That meant no trees, brush, or foliage of any kind. Anybody could be looking at us from virtually any direction. I could feel unseen eyes from every angle.

“Okay,” I conceded. “Let’s go. Not far.”

We took the path down a familiar ravine which led to a nearby hot spring. The snow - which had mercifully relented in the hours of the fire - returned in full force to peck at us along the way. We stopped every quarter-mile to adjust clothing and cover body parts from the wind. Our feet sunk deeper and deeper into the fresh covering. Soon enough, the walk turned into a shuffle.

“I can’t do this,” Sue moaned after the third or fourth stop. “I don’t want to die out here.”

I think the only thing that kept me going was the hope of that hot spring. I didn’t have much faith in the rescue team. I didn’t have much faith in myself. I guess I just figured, if this guy is going to kill me, maybe he’ll at least allow me one last moment of warmth. 

“We’re almost there.”

We tried to pick up the pace and Susan fell down a hill. I rushed to help and face-planted myself. It would have been funny at a ski slope - maybe with an added Benny Hill soundtrack to boot - but that afternoon, the fall took everything we had left. Twigs and branches smacked my face on the way down. Sticker bushes pricked and ripped away at my already tattered pants. I rolled end over end for what felt like an eternity. The tumble stopped abruptly at a tree stump which cracked a rib in the process. 

I sat up and looked around. 

The spring sat an inch from my crooked nose. 

I entered the water face first. The warmth of it sent a rush of blood that arced painfully and then pleasantly down my spine. I dove in deeper and let the water reach into my mouth, into my cold lungs, driving out the freeze that nestled into every inch of my insides. I surfaced and choked out air anew as sensation coursed through my arms and my legs and my toes and my fingers. All of it felt so fucking *good*. I felt more alive than ever before.

I looked around again.

Susan was gone. 

I splashed through the spring frantically. I dove to the bottom and felt along the rocks. Moments later, I saw her motionless body lying on the shore. I rushed over and carried her into the spring. She didn’t respond at first. At first, she didn’t even breathe. She just seemed so cold, like all the warmth in the world couldn’t bring life back home. But then she coughed. Her chest rattled. She opened her eyes - pale blue ones that radiated in the reflection of the sun on the water. She smiled at me. 

And then she screamed. 

It took me a minute to inject the fresh shock. I turned around and saw it. Two big bodies floated in the spring about three feet away. A gentle breeze pushed them our way. Susan hopped out of my arms and pulled the gun out of an unknown pocket. She shot one of them. Fat and tissue erupted into the air. I fumbled around for my knife.

“What the hell are you doing? I snapped. “He’ll hear you!”

She fired again.

“He knows!” she retorted. “Don’t you get it? He knows. He knew we would come to the spring  after the cabin burned down. He knew we would get in the water. He put those fucking bodies in there on purpose. To mess with us. To fuck with us. Two witchy women! Don’t you see it? He is playing a game. He is playing with us before he kills us. Like a fucking animal.”

“Three witchy women,” I corrected. 

“Huh?”

“Three witchy women. The letter said three. You said two.”

“Okay. So who are they? Who are these two?”

We examined the bodies as best we could. The stink was overwhelming. Bloat set in. I recognized outfits common for girls my age. An obnoxious tattoo with a heart on one arm gave a birth year. 1993. We saw a lot of thrill seekers who liked to camp out on the higher points of the mountain. But those folks were usually more prepared-looking than these two. 

“We can’t stay in the water forever,” Susan insisted after a point. “How far is the reserve cabin?”

We kept a secondary cabin in the area for emergencies such as this one. It wasn’t anything special outside the aforementioned four walls. But it was our best shot at finding some shelter.

“Too far,” I responded. “I don’t think we’ll make it by nightfall.”

“We have to try.”

I thought about it again before answering. It was true that we couldn’t stay in the water - for the same reason we couldn’t stay by the cabin - it was known to the killer. We needed somewhere random. We needed somewhere secure. We needed a good hiding place, but none of that existed at the time, so we decided to keep moving. 

We took the path that led to Reserve Cabin A. The snow cracked and crunched and melted under our freshly heated boots. We made progress during the first leg of the journey. We stopped when a mother grizzly and her two cubs happened across the path. I kept still and prayed that my partner remembered to do the same. The bears approached and got to about ten feet apart. The mother sniffed the air. The cubs rolled around gleefully. I envied them. We kept our heads down. The family eventually moved on. So did we.

We picked up the pace and made it about halfway through the journey by nightfall. Susan wanted to keep going. I wanted to scale a tree. We argued about that for a little bit. I couldn’t understand why she would want to travel in the dark.

“You are completely blind out there,” I insisted. “Animals, killers, not to mention the cold…”

“You’re just as vulnerable to that as me,” she snapped. “Especially sitting still.”

“The trees give us cover!”

The sun fell sometime during that discussion. A pack of wolves started howling nearby. Susan took that opportunity to hop up the tree.

“What if he has a chainsaw?” She asked while we got settled. “He would knock us right over.”

“Who carries around a chainsaw in the woods?” I laughed. “Kinda inefficient.”

“You know who.”

“I guess.”

“What do you think he wants?”

I didn’t know.

“Maybe he’s protecting the woods.”

“From what?” I asked.

“I don't know. From us,” she muttered. “You know, people. People are awful. Look at all the shit we’ve seen them do here. Fires. Pollution. Gender reveal parties…”

I thought about it.

“Doesn’t seem like the right way to go about it.”

“What?”

“He started a fire himself.”

“To get rid of us.”

“And the women?”

“Who knows what they did?”

“He killed them.”

“We don’t know that,” she insisted. “Maybe they were already dead.”

“I guess.”

We sat in silence for a bit.

“You know… we are probably going to die out here.”

I nodded.

"Yeah. Probably."

She sniffed.

“But there’s worse places to die, you know, than in the woods. With you.”

That caught me off-guard. 

“Thanks.”

“Don’t mention it.”

“Almost twice your age, you know…”

“Please stop.”

“Happy to.”

We fell asleep like that, laughing dumbly, arguing over our survival chances against a killer whilst twenty feet in the air hiding from one. I woke up a little while after and she was snoring on my shoulder. I woke up again and she was gone. 

It was daylight. 

I climbed down the rings of the tree and re-entered the forest. The prior night’s snow had turned into melts which made mini streams at every hill and slight incline along the way. The rushing water obscured most sound. I listened closely and heard footsteps.

Somebody was running. 

I shouted into the morning stillness and let the birds scatter. Then I started to run too. I didn’t know where to go. I didn't even think about it. Then I found a hill. I ran to the top and looked out into the woods about fifty feet below. I saw a flash of red. The jacket from the fire. Susan’s jacket. She stopped.

She turned a corner abruptly and fell down into the snow. She made a horrible sound as she tried to get up. She screamed and cried and begged. I wanted to help. I wanted to save her more than anything in the world. But then I saw him. 

He slipped out from the tree line as easily as the tide. He didn’t stop. He didn’t slow down. He had a horned-mask over his head and a machete in his left hand. Susan shouted right until the moment he took that knife and stuck it in her head. It stayed pinned there like an ax in wood.

Then he looked at me. 

I waited in dumbfound shock as the man dragged Susan’s dead body up to the base of the hill. He left it there. He stared for a second.Then he raised one hand. 

Two. Two from the creek. Plus one. Susan. That makes three.

Then he pointed at me. 

I ran.

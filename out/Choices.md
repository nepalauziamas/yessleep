“Right, left, or middle?”

Two gleaming rows of pointed teeth shone through the darkness barely moving as the words slipped through the veil of my unconsciousness. I shook my head trying to make myself more aware of just what that disembodied voice was asking of me.

“Again Mr mills right, left, or middle? Choose quickly time is a factor.” 

“Right, left, or middle what? I don’t understand what you are asking me!”

Two milky white orbs appeared above the teeth, I could feel their gaze upon me even with no discernible pupils.

“Quite simple really.”

Their gaze shifted towards a trio of doors with no markings each one the same as the last.

“You now have three minutes to make a decision Mr. mills right, left, or middle.”

“What’s behind the doors? Why are you doing this? Please just tell me!”

“Two minutes forty-seven seconds left Mr. Mills.”

The thing's teeth and eyes never changed or showed a glimmer of emotion. I could feel an oppressive emptiness all around me, no light shone anywhere in this abyss aside from my captor's face. I wanted to run, but those teeth kept me rooted in place.

“One minute Mr. Mills I suggest you choose now.”

“And what if I don’t then what?”

With no perceivable movement, I could tell he was smiling a flame glistening in his milky white eyes. His teeth separated showing off every needle-thin point.

“ I grow tired of waiting Mr. Mills and waiting well waiting makes….me…..famished.”

“ LEFT I choose LEFT!”

“Good choice Mr. Mills. Now please proceed to the left-hand door.”

As if on cue my legs unrooted themselves and started for the left-hand door. Pure dread crept throughout my body I wanted to run, shout, scream, and bite any bit of defiance I could muster, but I couldn’t those teeth crushed any fight left in my body. We arrived at the door and my captor pushed it open.

“It’s been a pleasure, Mr. Mills.”

I stopped in the middle of the room as the door slammed shut behind me. Pure white walls glared back at me, no light was hanging from the ceiling yet the walls were bright enough to make me squint.

“I don’t understand what you want…”

The words were torn from my lips and replaced by a guttural scream as barbed spikes shot through my feet. I tried moving them and let loose another howl as the barbs tore through the surrounding flesh.

“Simple Mr. Mills I wanted you to choose and choose you did. Now from this particular room, based on your size and weight it will take roughly 30 minutes to bleed out provided you don’t struggle and remain calm.”

My pulse quickened and my stomach turned sour I spewed bile across the ground. I tried to kneel but the barbs kept me rooted upright. 

“WHY just answer me already,” I screamed spitting bile and phlegm at what was once the disembodied teeth and eyes. His form had changed into a humanoid wisp of black smoke.

“Your choice this time allows me a little more time to explain without getting off schedule so I will humor you this time Mr. Mills.”

The milky white eyes surveyed the pooling blood, hungrily my captor let out a soft purr from deep within his Smokey form.

“You see Mr. Mills when you were alive you made some very very bad choices, sins if you so choose to call them.”

His eyes were glued to my feet, the wispy form slowly solidifying as more of my blood poured from the holes in my flesh.

“You made choices “sins” in your life with no hesitation that hurt people some major some minor so now you get to spend eternity with me.”

His teeth spread in a hungry grin eyes dancing from my feet to the blood now trickling toward him.

“Eternity with me choosing a different door and a different punishment each time resetting the clock only when you finally perish.”

My head was getting light the feeling in my legs fading as the blood left them.

“What… what do you mean reset.”

“Simple Mr. Mills after we finish in whichever room strikes your fancy you are restored wholly with your memory reset back in the main chamber where we begin the choice again.”

“What kind of sick place is this?”

“I believe your religion refers to this as hell Mr. Mills.”

Black spots were forming at the edges of my vision now, his form now solid swam in and out of focus.

“I was hoping you would struggle a bit more, to be honest, this is one of the longer punishments, and as I’ve said before waiting makes me so very very hungry.”

His teeth stretched into an impossibly large smile.

“This is now your 375th choice, I’ve come to discover the blood picks up a sweet taste if the punishment takes longer and I have several sweet tooth’s to satisfy Mr. Mills.” 

I spat in his direction my pleghm landing pitifully several inches in front of him. My last act of defiance caused a joyous laugh to burst forth from my captor's mouth. The world faded out and I saw in my final seconds those teeth rushed toward my falling body.

“Right, left, or middle?”

Two gleaming rows of teeth shone through the darkness barely moving as the words slipped through the veil of my unconsciousness.

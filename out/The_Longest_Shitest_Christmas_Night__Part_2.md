We spent the next few “weeks” at her house where we really bonded. She became like a big sister to me. As much as I loved her though, she still couldn’t replace my actual family who I missed very much. We did eventually run out of food though and we needed to go searching for more. Luckily, she had a jeep that was full of diesel. She had some extra in bottles if we needed to refill the tank. We drove around to different farms looking for some more but she already had them fully cleared out. We didn’t want to go too far from her house so we decided to change up the menu a bit and get fish instead. We drove to the nearest river to gather as many frozen fish as we could. I had never been fishing before but I knew it wasn’t usually that easy. But As we were gathering, we heard a vehicle pull up

“Hide. Quickly” said Karolina. “Crazies”

We both hid in the long grass in the meadow

“Barry, there’s fresh meat here” said one, pointing a flashlight into the Jeep.. He sounded to be in his late teens

“Aye, I can smell em”

“B-b-barry sh-shall I l-look around” said another one who sounded much younger than the other two

“Aye. Saoirse”

Yeah, babe”

“Go with Liam”

“Aww but can’t I go with you, babe?”

“Go with Liam. Brian. Follow me”

“No bother, Barry”

“Awe but babes, you know I’m a no good babysitter”

“Aye. But if I see one mark on that boy, you’ll know about it”

“Fine”

“Let’s go Brian”

The two older boys went searching around the Jeep while the girl and younger boy went searching by the river near us

“S-s-saoirse” said the boy pointing at the moonlit river full of frozen fish

“Shut up will ya you annoying prick”

“I-I’m s-sorry”

“You will be fuckin s-s-sorry if ya don’t shut the machine gun soundin mouth of yours. Go tell your brother we found nothing”

The younger boy ran off while the girl took a knife out of her pocket, cut her finger with it and licked the blood from her finger. 

“What’s she doing?” I whispered

“Shhhh” said Karolina covering my mouth with her hand

The younger boy came back

“H-he said t-t-to k-keep searching”

The young boy noticed the long grass where we were hidden and started coming over

“Move slowly” said karlolina

There was a wooded area not far from where we were so we crawled as slowly and quietly as we could towards it. Since it was dark, once far enough away we stood and ran into the woods where we climbed a tree and hid hoping they’d leave Karolina’s Jeep behind, but they left not too long after we made it into the woods and took Karolina’s Jeep with them. We decided to rest a little. 

“I thought they’d be even worse because of their name”

“Yes but they are new crazies. It is probably only their second year. The crazy crazies have been hunting kids for multiple years. I heard that after 3 years they start hunting kids when not frozen and are sent to mental hospitals or prisons where they get worse”

“That girl looked like she was on her way already to becoming one”

“Yes. It did look like that”

“Why do they hunt and eat kids anyway”

“From what I believe, on their first year they ran out of food and started hunting the kids to eat in order to survive which gave them a taste for kids”

“That’s disturbing”

“Yes. Very. But do not worry. I will keep you safe from them”

“I’ll try my best to do the same”

She rubbed my hair

“I am sure you will” 

We got off the tree and Karolina started a small fire using twigs and a lighter she kept on her at all times for emergencies like this. She took out two fish from her bag, stuck them on pointy sticks and cooked them over the fire. She handed me one

“Eat”

“Shouldn’t we have gutted them first” I said looking at the fish in disgust

“It still tastes the same. Eat”

I peeled off some of the skin and started eating the fish. Once we were done eating we fell asleep by the fire. When we woke up we cooked another fish each, ate them, gathered up some more from the river and started walking back to her house, staying away from the road. We did not want to encounter that group again. The bag was really heavy and my shoulder started to get sore so I asked her if we could stop for a few minutes. She said yeah and I put the bag down to give my shoulder a rest. 

“You will have to get strong if you are going to survive the night,” said Karolina. “We may need to be carrying even heavier loads than this in the future”

“How?” 

“You can start using my dad’s Gym equipment”

“Okay”

“Good boy, now let us go. I want to go home”

I picked the bag up again and we walked back to Karolina’s house. I laid on the couch to rest my feet and shoulder which were killing me. Karolina gutted and properly cooked the fish and we ate them. We had gathered enough fish to last us about a week. During that week I started getting myself stronger by lifting weights and doing different strengthening exercises Karolina told me about. She also taught me some Karate as she’s a black belt in Karate. She said she started doing Karate at a young age in case she ever needed to defend herself from her much larger, much stronger abusive father. Even though she knew she could defend herself and her brother though she never did. She said she was still too afraid to. “If it was me” I thought, “I’d have kicked his miserable old arse by now”.

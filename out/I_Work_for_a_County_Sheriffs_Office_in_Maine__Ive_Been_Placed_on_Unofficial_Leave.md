“God. Damn it!” I shouted in frustration as paperwork fell clean out the bottom of the folder I was carrying and fluttered to the floor scattering in all directions. I glared at the papers ruefully. It had been only a couple days since the witches attack and as it had turned out I was a little worse for wear. My left arm had been dislocated severely and there was a decent hole in my hand from where Eric removed the curse mark.

As a result my left arm would be in a sling until the end of the week and my right hand was bandaged up tightly. This made even simple tasks difficult so I knew it was going to be near impossible for me to pick up the paperwork. I decided to ignore them for the time being rather than try and awkwardly scrape them back into a pile.

You see, after the incident I had been placed on night duty. This meant that I would spend my nights alone in the Station with little more to do than twiddle my thumbs. If any problems arose I was to call a larger station in the next town over to come resolve it, though I still tried to spend my time productively. I focused on writing out reports and filing documents.

I was about to head back to my desk when there was a soft knocking and I looked over to see Eric standing in the darkness on the other side of the glass entryway doors. I moved to unlock it for him and he entered. He looked fatigued, and his clothing was slightly dampened from the weather outside.

“You’re earlier than usual.” I commented, glancing at the clock to see it was only nearing 3am. For the past two nights he had taken to patrolling the forest though he usually didn’t return to the station until 5 or 6 in the morning.

“It’s quiet out there.” He answered as he sat heavily on the couch in the visitors area, “It’s never a good thing when it’s quiet like this.” He sighed running his hand through his hair and closing his eyes a moment. I realised then that he must be tired. He was out in the forest for the entirety of my shift the previous night and the Sheriff had complained earlier about him being around on his shift during the day as well.

It only occurred to me then that he was probably out there day and night, “Have you slept in the last two days?” I asked raising my eyebrow.

“That’s not important right now, the spirit is still looking for a host. If she senses that I’ve left the area, she’ll take someone.” He explained, “How are your injuries?” He asked now, opening his eyes again to examine me as if he had forgotten to do so before.

“They’re fine.” I assured but he looked to the pile of documents on the floor pointedly.

“I see, and you just felt like throwing paperwork to the ground in joy?” He mused.

Dejected I ignored his question, “What happens if she can’t find a new host? I think you should try and get some sleep.” I regretted sounding like my mother.

He seemed to think a moment this time before speaking again, “Spirits.. Take a risk crossing the barrier. Typically they only come when called, and presumably whoever summoned her should know she needs a host. It’s.. Odd, that they didn’t have a host for her already. No sacrifice waiting.. If she can’t find a host again before she runs out of energy she will cease to exist.”

“Isn’t that a good thing?” I queried.

At this Eric looked amused, as if I was missing something, “She wants to live just as much as you or I. Every creature that has the will to live has survival instincts, as she becomes more desperate she will become more dangerous and I hope you realise you are still her ideal target.” He informed me casually.

I felt a fresh wave of unease roll over me, “I thought you removed the curse?” I asked nervously.

“I did.” He assured, “However, you’re still the easiest choice for her, she knows you. She’s familiar with your energy. Removing the curse made it more difficult for her to find you, though you shouldn’t let your guard down. The curse was like a key of sorts, but even without a key, she can still break in.”

His words hit a new found anxiety and I stepped back, reaching for a chair to sit down into as I did. I was almost certain I was going to faint, the thought that she might come for me, that I would hear her voice in my head again and feel her will imposed over my own brought back a fear I wished I had never known.

“Don’t look so worried Charles, I’ll handle it.” Eric said calmly, “Can you pass me my cane?” He asked then.

“I thought you said you didn’t need it for more than show?” I asked curious, I had assumed he wouldn’t feel the need to keep up appearances with me anymore since he didn’t even keep his arm bandaged now.

“Today I need it. I’ve over extended myself slightly.” He admitted.

“Oh, right.” I didn’t really understand but I did get him his cane, “Diane should be here any minute, I can ask for an early minute so we can go?”

“You’re pretty useless here anyway, I doubt she’ll mind.” He mused and I felt a twinge of embarrassment.

As he predicted Diane was only too happy to allow me to go early, though I think she might have also just wanted Eric to leave. Sheriff had driven me into work the day before since it was difficult for me to drive as I was, and Eric offered to drive me home since he would be staying with me anyway. His car was, ancient. A 1929 Mercedes, he told me, it was a shiny black thing with white wall tires. At first I doubted it was even drivable, but it quickly became apparent that it had been modified somewhat over the years, the engine certainly wasn’t from the 1930’s.

“Did you steal this from a museum?” I joked, the interior was leather, but the seats were an odd shape. No head rests.

“..Not from a museum…” He stated after a small hesitation.

It took me a moment to fully understand, “You know I’m an officer of the law, right?”

“So arrest me.” He said calmly and I closed my mouth. This was going to be one of those things I chose to ignore.

When we arrived at my apartment my neighbour, Mrs Jones, was out watering her garden as the sun was beginning to rise. She watched us with displeasure as we went inside, scowling down her nose at me, I’m not sure why she disliked me so much. My apartment was the on ground level, three bedroom one bath. Nothing special. I had cleaned up a little bit, but it still didn’t look great.

“Bathroom is down the hall, you can use the guest bed. I’ll make us some dinner.” I announced.

“Thank you.” He answered politely though his expression gave away none of his thoughts as he moved to go shower.

I set about struggling to cook up some steaks and vegetables, I couldn’t lift the heavy iron skillet well but I made do. As promised Eric wasn’t gone long. He came back out in black boxers with a towel half draped over his shoulders. He was using it to dry his hair with his left hand while his right hand was awkwardly held away from things, presumably so he didn’t cut the fabric. Now.. I know I agreed that I would ignore certain things when it came to him, but I help myself.

Taking the chance to subtly look him over I noticed his skin was remarkably unblemished. I don’t know why I had assumed that fighting the kinds of things he did that he would have scars. He didn’t. Aside from where his abnormal arm joined at his shoulder of course. The silver marks on his neck just below the jawline were oddly bright, I think I can be forgiven for thinking they glowed slightly.

He had his back turned to me as he started to pull on a shirt and I noticed that he was also remarkably well defined. One of those guys who’s veins show in their arms slightly when they pick things up. He seemed to struggle to get his monster arm through the shirt sleeve and I thought I heard him curse, then I remembered his left leg.

I had always been curious about what injury it may have had and I had never seen him before without jeans on so it had always been covered prior. I was simultaneously disappointed and intrigued to see that from his hip down the length of his leg was a neat line of what I thought were tattoos. They seemed to be a series of circles, crescents and stars, the ones from his ankle up to his thigh were empty outlines while the ones higher near his hip appeared to be full.

When he moved to put his pants back on I realised that I had been staring too long at the symbols and turned back to the food, “Hey Eric, what’s your routine?” I enquired now.

“Excuse me?” He asked confused.

“You’re ripped. What’s your work out routine?” I clarified as I plated up. He seemed to contemplate what I was saying for a moment and I thought I saw his cheeks heat faintly in embarrassment as he understood the compliment.

“Oh.. I spar a lot.” He answered blandly, “I thought I told you not to stare at me?”

“I wasn’t staring, I was just looking. I mean, n-not *‘looking’* just… I have eyes?” I struggled and I hope you all appreciate the effort I went to so that you know what Eric looks like.

He didn’t answer me then as we sat down for dinner. I gave him his plate and began struggling to cut through my steak like a savage. Juice leaked out of it and I knew I had cooked it perfectly, however that’s when I noticed Eric seemed to flinch and I realised he was watching me.

“I’m fine, I can cut it.” I assured assuming he was concerned.

“It’s not that..” He answered.

“What is it then? Are you alright?” I asked concerned now.

“It’s nothing, but I would prefer cereal.” He said finally.

“Oh, in the pantry.” I said easily and he got up quickly. I wondered if he had some kind of problem with meat? I felt a little dumb for not having considered that he might not eat the same things I did. I wasn’t entirely sure what monster-people liked to eat, but I had assumed meat, maybe I shouldn’t have cooked it?

The morning drew on and Eric took some time to place salt across all the entry ways into the house. I didn’t ask why, I felt like I knew better at that point. However as I was about to go to bed there was an energetic crashing out the front. Immediately Eric was tense and he moved to investigate.

“Wait, it’s okay, it’s just my sister.” I assured quickly, her enthusiasm was hard to mistake as she bashed on the door.

“Charles, CHARLES! Are you home?” She called trying to look through the frosted glass of the front door.

“Sister?” Eric echoed confused.

“Yeah, her name is Clair.” I said as I moved to open the door.

“Don’t-“ he started but it was too late. With the door open less than a crack my sister pushed her way in. Dragging a suitcase behind her she let it go before leaping onto me to wrap me up in a hug.

I winced, “Ow ow ow, Clair…”

She appeared to notice then that I was bandaged, “Oh, I’m sorry, *So* Sorry, are you alright?” She contained her energy quickly realising it was too much for the situation.

“I’m okay, I was just about to go to bed.. Nightshift.” I explained.

“Oh, I’ll have to be quiet then.” She said understanding, then she seemed to notice Eric for the first time. I watched as her expression changed from curious to embarrassed, “Charles.. There’s a very hot man standing in your living room and you have just let me make a fool of myself, but I just want you to know I support you 100%.”

I looked back to Eric who was covering his face with his hand, I was sure he must have been hating his job at that particular moment, then I turned back to my sister and I wondered briefly how exactly my life had gotten to this point.

“Clair no, that’s not right-” I tried.

“I won’t ask any questions I swear.” She assured putting her hands up.

To say it was a long day is putting it lightly. My sister did not in fact remain quiet and I’m sure neither Eric or I got much sleep with her in the house clattering around. She was determined to host a thanksgiving dinner at my house in the coming days and so was preparing. In addition to this the small emotions I had noticed in Eric evaporated and I wondered if I was previously able to recognise them because he was comfortable around me.

As evening came about Eric and I headed to the station for my next shift, “I’m sorry, my sister is.. ahhh.. high energy.” I apologised.

“You don’t need to apologise.” He stated.

“I know, but she’s.. Sometimes she has no filter when she says things. She’s great really, it was just her and I growing up. We don’t really get along well with our parents so she’s kind of my entire family.” I explained, “Do you have any family?” I asked curiously.

At this he hesitated, “In a round about way I suppose I do. Though I haven’t seen them for some time.”

“Oh, I’m sorry..”

“It’s fine.” He dismissed me.

“If you want, you’re welcome to stay for thanksgiving.” I offered which seemed to catch him by surprise, “You don’t have to but, my sister and I would like it if you did.” I clarified.

“I’ll think about it.” he stated noncommittally, then put his lefthand out to stop me flying forward as he slammed on the breaks of the car. He saw it before I did, a figure standing just ahead of the headlights. My heart began to race as I watched it shambled back out of the light, but Eric didn’t seem concerned as he pulled the car forward slowly until we were level with the thing.

I could tell then that it was a man, dressed in a suit standing on the edge of the forest. His mannerisms were strange and he seemed to recognise Eric with a caution that kept him from coming closer. I also noticed that his eyes were entirely white without pupils.

“Why are you here.” Eric demanded. No answer that I heard came but he continued as if one had, “That’s not important, answer the question.” Another pause seemingly without response, “I would hope I don’t have to remind you of what is acceptable to hunt and what is not.” His voice was colder now, “If you’re going to have a conversation, you had better include everyone.”

‘As you wish.’ A male voice came to mind, it was distant sounding and deeply disturbing, not quite the same as the witch.. But similar, ‘Hunting witches Eric? Isn’t that a touch too dangerous for you\~?’ The voice asked, ‘Nathaniel wouldn’t approve.’

“It doesn’t matter what he would approve of.” Eric muttered, oddly annoyed by the comment.

‘You should know he requests that you come see him, he says it has been too long.’

I saw Eric subtly raise his hand to the crescent marks on his neck, “ ‘Requests’? or ‘Commands’?” He clarified tensely.

The man on the road smiled broadly, ‘Just a *‘request’*, for now.’ The voice exaggerated the ’s’ in ‘request’ and I saw him turn his attention to me, ‘When I see him next, I will be sure to tell him of your new… friend.’ I felt as though I had just been looked up and down.

“Tell him what you like.” Eric answered finally as he put the car back in gear and we sped off.

“What *was* that?” I asked anxiously, looking back to see that the thing was still standing where we had left him.

“A parasite.” He explained vaguely, “He won’t hunt humans in this area so there’s no need to be concerned. He’s little more than an inconvenience.”

“What did it mean when he said witches are too dangerous for you? I can’t imagine anything that’s beyond what you can handle.”

Eric seemed amused, “There are plenty of things I can’t handle. This witch isn’t one of them. I don’t know what it is, but she’s not strong. I can sense it.”

“You think she’s injured or something?” I asked now unsurely.

“I don’t know.” He said honestly as we arrived at the station, “I won’t be far.” He told me and I knew that to mean he wasn’t coming inside.

The night passed slowly and without incident. As dawn approached Eric returned to collect me from the station then we decided to go to Millies for breakfast. Though I was disappointed to note Jess wasn’t on shift I was interested to see that Eric ordered pancakes. We sat in silence for a long time before I finally spoke up, “So, you’ll eat pancakes, but not steak?” I asked waving my fork at him accusatorially.

“Charles.” He warned without looking up at me and I knew I had hit a weak point.

“Why is that exactly?” I continued being cheeky.

“Pick another subject.” He said finally.

“Alright.” I agreed, eating a spoonful of the ice cream that came with the waffles I had ordered, before enquiring, “Who’s ‘Nathaniel’?” I asked and Eric choked.

“Since when did you decide you could interrogate me?” He muttered.

“I’m not interrogating you, I’m just asking questions-“ I assured though stopped when I noticed Eric’s attention fixate on the door. Confused I turned in the booth to look back at the door. A father and daughter had just entered and I recognised the man, Dr. Dempsey, “Is something wrong?” I asked unsurely.

“Do you know them?” Eric asked quietly.

“That’s my doctor.. I went to see him when I got the curse mark.. I assume the girl is his daughter.” I explained speaking quieter when he did. They looked similar, both with red hair and light eyes so it was an easy connection to make. As I watched then Dr. Dempsey’s eyes came to rest on me and I felt a chill run down my spine. It didn’t seem as though *He* was looking at me.. Rather, that something *else* disturbingly familiar was.

I didn’t have the time to say what I thought before the man attacked. Eric was gone from the booth before I could even determine what was happening and the Doctor’s fist came down hard on the empty space, breaking off the corner of the table with the force of the impact. From then, it was pure chaos. Other customers screamed and in a panic everyone tried to cram themselves out the doorway.

“The girl is the witch!” Eric told me as the big man recovered from his initial missed attack and turned back to challenge him again. I’m not sure what he wanted me to do with that information. I was just a man with a fork and a half eaten plate of waffles. “Charles, don’t let her make that circle!” He clarified and I realised that the man’s daughter was drawing a pentagram on the linoleum floor of the diner with her own blood.

I hurried to try and stop her, I really had no idea what to do. They don’t teach you how to interrupt a witch’s seance in the yearly retraining and so I ended up sort of bear hugging her then scooping her off the floor so she couldn’t continue drawing. In response the 16 year old screamed and bit me. She thrashed wildly and kicked off the counter top with her feet. The momentum knocked us both backwards. I landed taking the brunt of the force for both of us, hitting my head and injured shoulder, one of them made a sickening crack that I knew wasn’t good, though I’m not sure which it was.

Dazed I rolled in agony as the teen sprung up. I knew she was going right back to her pentagram but as I struggled to recover it was too late. I didn’t know what would happen until it had begun. She completed the symbol and the entire coffee shop began to vibrate. Mr. Dempsey stepped away from Eric now, returning to his daughters side with a wide smile, I could recognise the spirit that had infected me in him and it made me shudder.

Eric returned to my side and was urging me to get up, “You need to leave Charles, now.” He stated firmly.

“What’s happening?” I asked numbly instead.

“I don’t know, she’s summoned something else.. There’s only one way this ends now. The castor has to die to break all of the summons, you don’t want to see it.” He told me calmly, his expression was cold. I realised then that this was his true job, to take care of things no matter how unpleasant the resolution was.

“You can’t just kill a teenaged girl.” I protested.

“She’s not a teenaged girl anymore. Nothing like that is human, it’s just wearing a pretty shell.”

The floor began to split apart along the lines of blood and I realised I could see something in the darkness below. There was a tense moment of quiet before the thing rose up out of the ground. It was a massive scaled creature with spines, the top of its head brushed the ceiling of the diner and it reminded me considerably of a snake.

When it launched itself directly at Eric and I, he readjusted and in a split second I saw his darker eye dilate from a slit to a circle, like a cat focusing on a bird. He then slammed his hand directly down onto the ground, I saw blue sparks ignite in the air and the creature smashed into a shimmering silver wall that didn’t seem to be there until the moment it was impacted.

It looked just as confused as I did that it had hit something and the barrier then began to crumble into a sparkling silver dust, dissolving in the air like snow on a warm day, “That was a one time deal wasn’t it..” I asked and Eric nodded.

“Yes. Now go, if I have to protect you you’re in the way.”

I couldn’t argue with his logic. I scrambled to get out of the diner as he squared up with the thing more than triple his size. I couldn’t imagine how he could fight that, but I could also see a singular determination in his eyes. I thought then that he probably didn’t know how to give up on anything and I realised that there was something I could do to help..

I still had my gun on me from work and I’m not a bad aim. As Eric fought with the creature the diner was being destroyed, broken crockery was scatted over the floor and I trained my eye on the girl. She didn’t look any different from any other teenaged girl I had ever seen, but it was her blood that connected these creatures to this world..

Truthfully I don’t remember pulling the trigger, I vaguely remember hearing the shot and seeing the surprise on Eric’s face as the serpent hissed thrashing back and forth. It seemed to burn up with protest in the same way the witches spirit did as it left Mr. Dempsey. I don’t know what happened after that. I heard sirens and the Sheriff’s voice arraign with Eric’s before I faded into unconsciousness.

When I came back to I was in a hospital bed, again. Though this time Eric was in the room along with my sister who was pacing anxiously.

“He’s waking, stop worrying.” Eric was telling my sister. He sat neatly with his arm bandaged, eye covered and cane by his side. meanwhile my sister looked like a mess, her hair haphazardly done and wearing the same clothes from the day before.

“How do you know? He SHOT someone Eric.” she stated panicked.

“I’m well aware.” He responded calmly. I’m sure that bothered her even more.

“Stop.. worrying so much..” I murmured to Clair and she immediately launched herself at me. I didn’t feel a thing, pain meds I suppose.

“You’re alive!” She said dramatically.

“He was never going to die.” Eric said flatly, “Though, you will be mending a broken arm for a considerable time.” He informed me.

“What else has happened?” I groaned and he hesitated.

“..You’ve been placed on unofficial leave.. Pending investigation.” He said gently.

Great.

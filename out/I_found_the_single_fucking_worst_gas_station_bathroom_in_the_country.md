There’s a tiny gas station several exits off of I-97 way out in the country called *Pete’s Petrol*. I always stop at *Pete’s* when I’m making my monthly drive from home to the main office across the State. I fill up my tank, I grab a Red Bull, and I use the bathroom. *Pete’s Petrol* is unique in that the bathrooms are a separate building from the rest of the station. I liked that; I liked the privacy.

The washroom was small but clean and hardly trafficked. Stan–the current owner and the son of the late Pete–was the only unpleasant part of my monthly routine. It wasn’t that Stan was rude or mean or aggressive in any way. The man was just…off-putting. He was tall as a fence post and scarecrow lean. I don’t think he got a lot of sun. Stan wore the same greased-stained set of blue mechanic’s coveralls every time I saw him. He never failed to drop what he was doing to come chat with me and couldn’t take a hint if I was in a rush and trying to check out. Stan had heterochromia, meaning he had two different colored eyes. One was so brown it was nearly black, the other so blue it was almost gray. That wasn’t his fault, of course, but he also liked to stare which made the condition even more noticeable.

Still, Stan always appeared harmless, if lonely, and he wasn’t creepy enough to make me avoid *Pete’s Petrol*. I found comfort in the familiarity. Then, one night after I got stuck in the office until nearly midnight, I made my last trip to *Pete’s* washroom. The visit started like normal if much, much later than usual. I popped into the station to ask for the key and got trapped in one of Stan’s stories for nearly twenty minutes. Something about a hunting trip he went on. I was barely listening, all of my focus on my screaming bladder. Eventually, Stan released me and I sprinted across the parking lot.

There were two washrooms in the small building: a Men’s and a Woman’s, though so few people used the station it seemed pointless to split them. Regardless, I used the key to let myself into the Men’s room. It was tidy though there was a sour odor I couldn’t place. There were two stalls and two urinals but only one sink. Someone had broken the mirror since my last visit; a great spiderweb of cracks slithered out from the middle. I made my way to a urinal and stopped. There was a stain on the white porcelain, a dark red ring of something like rust.

I frowned. It was unusual for Stan to leave the washroom less than pristine. There was the issue of the lights, as well. They were dimmer than normal, casting jagged shadows on the tiled floor and white walls. I shuffled over to the second urinal, which was in perfect condition. After I was done, I flushed and moved to the sink. Just as I was washing my hands, I felt a rumble in my stomach. That cheap burrito from the food truck outside my office I’d eaten for dinner was going rogue. I shook my hands mostly dry and paused when I saw the splatter against the mirror. It was hard to tell in the gloomy light, but the droplets from the water appeared to have a red-black tint.

I wiped my hands against my shirt and prepared to turn on the sink again to check the water. Then the rumble came again, more urgent this time, my guts twisting with necessity. I shot into the first stall, fighting with my belt like it was sealed with a combination lock instead of just a buckle. I managed to get in position just in time.

Fifteen minutes later, I was washing my hands again when the water went completely red. I yelled and pulled back. The fluid was thick and stickier than water. I dried my hands as best I could and went back to the stall to check the toilet. Sure enough, the bowl was filled with crimson. I flushed on reflex and there was a gurgling sound. There was some kind of backup. I’d seen it happen before at *Pete’s*. The place was so remote that it wasn’t hooked up to any municipal wastewater. The station and its washroom had to be on a well and septic system. Those were static and had a tendency to get overwhelmed easily.

I watched the red water swirl down the toilet. When the bowl began to refill, I screamed. The water was still red but now it was full of bits and pieces of flesh and bone and muscle. I recognized a full human finger first then, even worse, an eyeball. I threw up and then backed out of the stall. The parking lot seemed so much larger and emptier as I ran for my car. For a terrible stretch of seconds, I couldn’t find my keys. They were in my pocket right where I left them, though, so in a moment I was in the car and then peeling out of the parking lot. The last thing I saw of *Pete’s Petrol* was Stan watching from the window with a confused look on his face.

I’m pretty sure I held my breath until I was a mile from the station. I was just starting to relax when I glanced in my rearview mirror and saw a tow truck rapidly approaching. Within a few seconds, Stan’s face came into view as he hunched over the wheel, snarling. He was chasing me. I felt my whole body go cold. There was something very wrong with the washrooms at *Pete’s Petrol* and Stan probably wanted to keep that secret. I slammed my foot to the gas.

The tow truck behind me was old but powerful. We went on a nightmare chase down the highway for the better part of an hour. At some points, Stan grew so close in my rearview that I could see the madness in his mismatched eyes, and the way his lips were back away from his teeth. I tried calling the police several times but had no reception at all out in the sticks.

An hour after leaving the station, I finally began encountering the traffic around Annapolis. Even that early in the morning, there were cars on the road, lights, and even some cops. I finally made contact with 9-1-1 and told them that I was being chased. Stan and I both slowed down the closer we got to the city. Once I hit the city limits, Stan dropped away. I watched his tow truck take an illegal u-turn, heading back towards the gas station and its morbid washrooms at breakneck speed. I pulled over, still on the line with 9-1-1, and waited. The cops sounded skeptical when they found me on the shoulder of the road but I was able to convince them to follow me back to *Pete’s Petrol*. When we reached the station, I felt my stomach twisting for new reasons.

The gas station and the washrooms behind it were all on fire. The place was so remote that it took another thirty minutes for the fire department to arrive. There was no sign of Stan. Once the blaze was finished and more cops arrived, they started looking around. I showed the officers the bathroom and the grizzly things in the toilet. They finally believed me, then. A crew got into the septic tank and discovered a horrific scene. A dozen dead bodies were crammed into the disgusting space. The investigation is ongoing but I got the basics from a cop while I was giving my statements.

They believed that Stan was a killer. He’d been stuffing bodies into the gas station’s large septic tank for years with no one the wiser. Finally, between the decaying corpses and excrement, the tank clogged and began to flow back into the pipes that connected it to the washroom. The red water I’d seen was blood and bone marrow and every other kind of rot from a submerged body. The chunks of flesh were a kind of backwash.

Stan is still out there; they never caught him. I wonder, often, if he blames me. I was the one who made the discovery, the one who found the dark sickness in the washroom. Any time I see a tow truck now, I watch it carefully. [I look for mismatched eyes and the madness behind them.](https://www.travisbrownwriting.com/)

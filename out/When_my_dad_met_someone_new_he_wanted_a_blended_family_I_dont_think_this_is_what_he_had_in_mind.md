My mum died. It’s been a while now but it still feels weird to say those words. Or even to type them. 

People avoided asking me about it so I never really got to say it out loud; I suppose cancer is a fucking awkward topic, sure to bring down any mood. Instead they just threw pity at me with their eyes and avoided conversation of death and sickness all together. 

I spent a year on eggshells. I couldn’t understand it when my dad told us he’d met someone new. How had he found the time? We were still being treated like those little orphan kids and he’d managed to date. I’d be lying if I said I wasn’t a bit angry.

My little brother Sven was too young when she died to understand what we were going through. He was barely out of nursery and still couldn’t grasp that mummy wasn’t coming home. I wasn’t sure what was worse, having years with her and losing her, or avoiding the pain by being too young to remember. 

Meanwhile I was stuck with what felt like a grief tumour, attacking every part of my body as aggressively as the one that killed my mum. Along with a pile of university entrance exams, all in the same month. I buried my mother one day and sat advanced mathematics the next. 

I made it to university. My dad was shocked, I know he expected me to fail. He had the same pity eyes that all the other kids at school did. I was grateful for the fresh start and a chance to flee all those haunting, painful memories and I took it. Anything to be more than just the girl who’s mum died. 

I weathered the summer, dealing with the grief and the misery in my home, only relieved by Sven’s infectious giggles. I was going to miss them regardless of the pain, but still, I packed up my car and moved miles away when September hit. 

Every visit home I felt the eggshells pricking at my feet. A week here and there, then straight back to my uni bubble, where I could be someone else. The year passed so quickly. As selfish as it may sound, I detested my visits home. But none more than the start of this summer, a year on, when my dad announced his new woman; my mother’s replacement. 

Her name was Ally and she had a fifteen year old daughter named Violet. My dad hadn’t planned to tell us so soon, but he was left with no choice when Ally was evicted just before the government lockdown, leaving her and her kid homeless. We learned about our new step family only three hours before they moved into our home. 

He begged us to give them a chance. Sven, only six years old at the time, was on board. I was tougher, but I didn’t put up a fight, instead opting for a frosty, unfeeling demeanour. 

*”Some step families do really well Taylor, please just give them a chance. We might all get on and work as a blended family.”*

I remember him saying that and thinking that he must have read some books and articles on “blended families”, trying to make himself sound clever. I thought about what a ridiculous term that was. I recognise now that he was trying; I wish I’d given him more credit for it but at the time I barely hissed in response and waited in silence until they knocked on the door and our lives changed forever. 

I wish I could lament my dads choice of woman but Ally was beautiful. She had a soft and nurturing face and a voice that could read bedtime stories. She was kind, patient and made every respectful and non invasive effort to befriend my brother and I. I completely got the attraction and I saw how happy she made my dad. 

Bitter as I was, Ally was never the problem. Violet was. 

I knew it the moment they walked through the door. A perpetually sour faced young girl with something slightly intimidating about her. Where Ally radiated light, Violet was there to suck it up. When she wasn’t looking sour she had a smug grin that she tried to hide by pursing her lips and she made no effort to converse at all. I couldn’t put my finger on it at first, I assumed it was nerves, but by that night she’d proven my reservations correct. 

I retreated to my room pretty soon after an awkward dinner. Ally had tried to keep the conversation flowing but none of us were ready to open up yet. You could hear even the faintest clink of a fork hitting a plate. 

My bedroom was opposite the bathroom and around 9pm I started to smell my mother.

That sounds odd, but it’s true. My mum always wore the same perfume; it was distinctive and bought tears to my eyes as it seeped under the gap in the door. It’s strange that things like a scent can spark that kind of emotional reaction but I was a mess.

I stumbled out of the room rubbing my eyes and flung open the bathroom door where the smell was coming from. There she was. 

Violet. 

Holding the half empty bottle of my dead mums perfume that had previously sat on window ledge next to a framed photograph, she spritzed it at herself again before turning to face me. There wasn’t a human on earth that wouldn’t have seen it was sentimental. 

Her eyes lingered on mine for a moment and she pursed her lips, attempting to conceal another telling smile. After a few seconds of eye contact she dropped the bottle and screamed, as if I’d made her jump. 

The room, hallway and every upstairs carpet of my house saturated with that strong aroma as the bottle smashed. It was the kind of smell that would take months to eradicate entirely. Ally and dad ran to our aid, suspecting the worst. 

I saw the relief and heartbreak in his eyes when he saw what happened. I tried to explain, I said she’d done it on purpose but she insisted she didn’t know and only dropped it because I startled her. She couldn’t have been more apologetic. I have to admit, Violet played innocent well, but I saw straight through her. 

My protests were ignored and the whole thing was explained away like an innocuous accident. 

*”I’m sorry, Taylor still struggles with... you know.”* I heard my dad say to Ally in the hall, when they thought I was already asleep. Violet had stolen a piece of my mum and made me look insane all in one action. 

That was only night one. 

The incidents with Violet continued. It started small; dropping a vase, knocking salt into an almost finished pan of food and overwatering a plant, all sorts of clumsy mishaps. 

Then things escalated. About a week into our venture as a *blended family* Violet created the type of havoc that doesn’t go unnoticed. 

I was studying at the table in the kitchen and Ally had been cooking, she left with a pot of potatoes boiling on the stove and asked me to keep an eye on them while she showered. I didn’t think much of it. I watched and adjusted the flame accordingly as the water bubbled and expanded. 

When Violet entered I barely noticed. I’d tried to avoid her at all possible cost after the perfume and I wasn’t about to stop. I didn’t look round, make eye contact or do anything to attract her attention.

I listened as she walked to the fridge, opened the door and took a swig of juice, all while still focusing on the potatoes. If I’d have just looked, been more wary, I’d have noticed her turn and seen her lips pursed, hiding the same smug, sinister smile as before. 

As she turned she plunged her hand into the pot of boiling water. 

I screamed. In shock and pain at the molten, flying droplets that kissed my skin. She didn’t. I’d never seen anything like it, she almost looked like she was enjoying her skin melting and bubbling as I looked on in horror.

“What are you doing?!” I cried, before begging her to stop. I threw a hand around her upper arm and tried to wrench it out of the pot but she wouldn’t move an inch, she was planted. 

*”Time for dinner sis!”* she responded with glee.

I fought with her like that for a while, desperately trying to stop her as the smell of her boiling flesh battled my mums spilled perfume that had permeated the walls days before. 

Then Ally walked in.

Immediately Violet started wailing, like you would expect from a person who’s hand was sizzling and blistering in liquid. Tears streamed from her dead, blue eyes as she started to repeat a single word.

*”STOP STOP STOP STOP STOP”*

I saw what she was trying to do, and it was genius. It looked so bad, me clutching the same arm that was stuck in the pot. Ally looked stunned and disturbed as I let go and backed away. Violet pulled out her hand, melted almost to the bone and dropped to the floor, screeching in agony. 

I stood in the corner near catatonic, back to the wall as Ally dialled the ambulance. My new step mum didn’t make eye contact with me, not once, as she tended her spawn on the floor. The three minutes the ambulance took felt like a lifetime with me silent in the corner and the smell of death filling every inch of the room. 

When my dad got home from the store with Sven I told him what happened. He didn’t give me a chance to explain or to try and convince him that Violet was the literal devil. He didn’t comfort me; instead he left my six year old brother in my care and fled to the hospital to be with his new family. 

I wondered if he suspected Violet too. If he thought I did it then why would he leave me with Sven? But if he thought I didn’t do it then why would he go to her? I waited for police sirens all night, to pick me up for my evil crime. 

They never came.

At the break of dawn, still awake, I watched my dads car pull into the drive, two people in the passenger seats. Ally walked Violet upstairs, bandages up to her elbow and settled her in her room, the old spare.

My dad sat opposite me in the living room, eyes brimming with tears and shushed me before I could say a word. I felt my heart pound as Ally’s footsteps made their way back down the stairs. I wasn’t worried about my fate, I was worried about my little brother being in such close proximity to that monster. I had no idea what Violet was capable of. 

Ally walked into the room and rushed towards me. I braced myself for a slap, a punch, some kind of attack but instead she embraced me, pulling me in close so she could whisper in my ear.

*”I saw everything. I’m sorry. There’s something wrong with her.”*

I felt a rush of relief go through my entire body as I communicated with my dad and Ally using nothing but our eyes. I was so incredibly grateful, they were as scared as I was. 

“You need to call a doctor.” I pleaded with Violets mother, not only concerned for myself but for anyone who could do what Violet did without so much as a genuine flinch. 

*”This isn’t something any doctor can fix honey. I’m so sorry. We can’t talk about this here, let’s sit outside.”*

The three of us moved to the patio in the back garden, Ally taking special care to ensure every window to the back of the house was closed, terror in her face. I couldn’t imagine being scared of my own flesh and blood, but Ally’s fear was incomprehensible. 

*”She’s done this before Taylor. I thought we were past this but I was wrong. I promise I never would have put your family at risk if I’d thought for even one second that...”*

“What do you mean, *past* this? Her hand wasn’t fucked up before.”

*”I don’t mean that particular stunt, I’ve never seen her do anything so brazen before. I mean the little things, all those evil malicious actions that you can’t quite prove. I’ve suspected her for a long time, she wasn’t the same after her dad died.”*

*”If you think something’s wrong then why can’t you take her to a doctor honey.”* My dad cut in. *”I can’t have my kids at risk.”*

As grateful as I was that my dad was standing up for us I could see the sheer, unadulterated horror on Ally’s face and I couldn’t help but pity her. How many smashed bottles of perfume had she lived through? 

*”You don’t get it Joe. I did. I took her to the doctor. She had three appointments, each time the doctor flagged more concerns than the last.”*

“What happened to her?” I asked.

*”She hung herself.”* Ally replied facing the ground, sombrely. 

*”It isn’t Violets fault that the woman was disturbed. We need to try again, call someone new.”* my dads voice shook as he spoke but ever the optimist he tried to offer comfort. 

Ally laughed a humourless, soulless laugh.

*”It isn’t that simple. She didn’t just die. She hung herself while in session with Violet. I wasn’t in the room, but I saw my kids face when I picked her up and honestly, it wouldn’t surprise me if my daughter tied the noose. No emotion would’ve been easier, but she looked delighted.”*

I felt a chill run down my spine. 

“Did you report her to the police?” 

*“Yes.”*

“And what happened?”

*”I finally saw what kind of monster she is. They came to question her and I left to make tea... give them a little privacy. I still thought at the time there was a chance I was imagining it.*

She started to cry softly. I hadn’t known her long but I desperately wanted to give Ally a hug. If it weren’t for Violet, she would’ve been a welcomed addition to the household. My dad placed an arm around her and she continued.

*”She just looked at them. I can’t prove a thing but I know she did it. She squinted and their bones cracked. Blood poured from every opening and they died on my couch. As they lay there she told me I shouldn’t have called them.”*

*”What the fuck Al? Why didn’t you say anything?”* My dad was angry, but more worried than anything, I could hear the compassion in his tone.

*”How are you supposed to admit that you don’t think your child’s human? We ran. Years passed and nothing else happened... meeting you, moving here. I started to wonder if the whole thing had been a sick nightmare until last night.”*

“Well it’s not a nightmare so what do we do?” I begged, needing some kind of viable solution to the literal demon lying mere feet from my young brother. 

*”We keep her happy. She didn’t want to go to therapy. She didn’t want to move here. If we get her used to it... if we just make everything ok she’ll settle... she has to. I fear there isn’t another choice.”*

I watched my father squirm at the prospect of sharing his home with a powerful and presumably evil entity. He knew there was another choice, he could yeet the pair of them to the curb, but I knew that he wouldn’t. We may have only just learned about Ally but they were in love, anyone could see that. I can’t say it was a situation I’d ever envisioned us as a family being in. 

I’m sure he hadn’t either. 

I tried to sleep that morning but all I got was a few broken hours. Every knock, bump and creek in the house had me on edge. I opened my Sven’s door and peaked inside more times than I could count. 

A whole two weeks passed like that. Every noise, every night, every dinner we were on edge. All of us but Violet. Even Sven picked up on the negative energy. She... *it*... enjoyed the psychological torture. She loved watching us tiptoeing around her, bowing to her every whim. It wasn’t like when my mum died and I had to walk on eggshells. Living with Violet was like walking on rusty nails. 

She’s tormented me for months, every time we were alone she made that pursed lipped smile. She ran her fingers across the cold stove to taunt me and I’m not sure if it was the trauma or Violet, but every time I was certain I could smell her necrotic, burning flesh. 

The ever changing bandages and pus filled blisters that seeped out the gaps were a constant reminder. If she caught me cringing she would wink and laugh. 

Violet and I had very few verbal interactions. Whenever I was unfortunate to have to communicate with her she would call me *sis*. Just like she had as she plunged her hand into the water. It made my skin crawl. Her voice was high pitched and full of malevolent joy, it may have passed as happy to a very small child, but to anyone with emotional maturity could hear straight through it.

Still, despite the unease and the drawn out misery there were no further incidents. Ally insisted she knew what she was doing whenever we caught a stolen whisper in the halls. Things didn’t get better but they did get easier to bear. There was even the occasional smile in the home. 

Sven’s infectious giggle cut through the dark atmosphere whenever it could. 

I hadn’t expected to be home as long as I was. The lockdown lasted longer than expected and I lost out on loads of time at university. Everything that had happened with Violet made the idea of going back harder, but I knew that September was looming. So yesterday I drove back to my dorm to drop off half my stuff and make the move back easier. 

I crashed there for the night and had the best sleep I’d experienced since returning home. I thought about Dad, Sven and Ally. All of them stuck there with that *thing* while I got to escape for the night. I felt selfish, but I was glad. Just one night away from the misery.

This morning my life changed again. I could feel it coming up to the driveway, something was incredibly wrong. 

There wasn’t a thing out of place; dads car sat on the drive and the flowers bordered the garden like they always had. The house had always been so pretty. It’s quaint exterior hid the evil inside so well. 

I turned my key in the door and took a tentative step inside. I can’t explain why I felt so uncomfortable, in truth I had felt uncomfortable for months but there was something more to it this morning. I saw her the moment I entered. 

I walked through the hall, past the living room door and to the kitchen in a trance, without even stopping to drop my bags. 

Violet sat at the table, blue eyes fixated on me and lips pursed hiding a smile. In front of her were two glasses filled with a dark orange, smoothie like liquid, decorated with blood orange slices and finished with a tiny paper umbrella. It sat next to a chopping board and a blender, spattered inside with pulp. She looked sinister as ever, but the drinks actually looked pleasant. 

She slid one towards me.

*“Hey sis, I missed you and it got me thinking about how I want us to get along better, take a seat.”*

She gestured to the seat opposite and without taking my eyes off her for a single second I sat down, heart pounding. 

“Where is everyone?” I asked, trying to stay calm and willing the beads of sweat forming on my face to stop. 

*”They’re all in the living room. This is time for just me and you sis. Have a drink.”* 

I looked at the cup and back at Violet. I wondered if I shouted, would they come running? It was far too quiet. Sven was never that quiet, and it was far too late for him to be sleeping. She unpursed her lips gently to giggle. Her giggle sent a quiver through every bone, vein and tendon in my body. 

*”You think it’s poison, don’t you?”*

“Would you blame me?”

Her smile turned to a scowl and she snatched the drink back, taking a swig of it and then another of hers. She made a gross, sloshing, satisfied noise, savouring the flavour. 

*”See, just paranoia sis. I don’t think you’ve been very fair to me. Try it, I made it just for you and I’m going to be very offended if you don’t.”*

My hand shook as I reached out for the glass. My entire being was telling me not to, but instinct was being overridden by mental images of her hand melting and the police officers, bleeding from their eyes, nose and ears. Or maybe I never had a choice to begin with. At the time I know I hadn’t properly considered that some fates are worse than death.

I took a sip. 

An unexpected, indescribable and ghastly flavour filled my mouth, a gloopy texture with small hardened shards swishing around my tongue. I turned to the floor and spat. It was the first time I’d taken my eyes off Violet since entering the house. 

Now I realise that’s exactly how she wanted it.

The floor was covered in blood, spattered in artistic patterns along the bottom of cabinets and across every tile. I turned to try and take in more of the house, noting the blood saturating the hallway carpet. I’d been so fixated on the monster I’d stepped straight through it before. 

Steadying myself on my chair I took another look at Violet who had broken into full hysterical laughter. I thought of my Dad, his lovely girlfriend and my gorgeous little brother, knowing I wasn’t going to see any of them again. Then I took another look at the cup.

It didn’t take long to put two and two together. The bile in my stomach had already made it to my throat by the time she spoke but still, her next words will haunt me [forever.](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheCrypticCompendium/)

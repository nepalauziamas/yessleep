On the east side of town, there is a river that separates the historic district from a large sprawling cemetery, known as Ferngate. A mossy stone arch bridge serves as the only intermediary between the land of the living and the land of the dead. By day dozens of people cross over that bridge to admire the magnificently creepy sculptures, mausoleums, and rambling live oaks on display throughout the grounds. At night, however, it’s sealed off to the world, and the imposing wrought iron gates are shut and locked with three heavy chains and three separate padlocks.

You might be asking yourself why the city would go to such lengths to keep the gates closed at night. Logic would likely point the impetus towards deterring vandals, or maybe even satanists, but I’ve learned that if you want to understand Ferngate, it’s best to leave logic at the entrance. Honestly, it doesn’t matter what the reason is for all those locks, it’s nothing more than an exercise in futility. Every night at 3 AM the gates will open, without fail. Not a lot of people in town know about that. I happen to know because I work right next door.

I’ve been an employee at the Fox Den for a few months now. It’s an antique bookstore/bar that faces the cemetery and sits right across the street from the old stone bridge. I’ll admit it’s a strange mix, but Ferngate is a kind of black hole that pulls all things weird and enigmatic to it. The fact that I’ve gravitated towards a job right outside the gates probably says something about me. Although to be fair, I’m pretty normal compared to most of the characters that come out at night, I’m just abnormally awkward.

I would never work at a conventional bar, that much social interaction would likely put me into a coma, but the Fox Den is anything but conventional. It’s small and we rarely have more than three or four people there at a time.

I’m in charge of the bizarrely late nightshift. It usually consists of serving a few drinks to the regulars, selling the occasional book to a night owl, and keeping an eye on the inexplicably foggy boneyard across the street.

It’s hard to explain just how thick the fog is. If you were standing in it, for some god forsaken reason, I don’t think you’d be able to see your hand even if you slapped your own eyeballs. To walk into that fog would be like swimming in a pool full of rotten marshmallows or if you wanted to capture the mood a little better, being wrapped up in a cocoon by ten thousand schizophrenic spiders. 

I’ve had a lot of opportunities to think about it because every night, a little before 3 AM, an impenetrable white wall of fog rolls across the cemetery, and all the way up to the tall iron fence that surrounds it. I don’t know why it stops there, I don’t know where it comes from, and I don’t know why Ferngate is the only place in town that will be foggy but nevertheless, it happens. 

The gates will only open once the fog moves in, so I never get to see who opens them. But besides the fog and the ghost gates most nights are relatively low key. Sure, you might hear a wolf’s howl so loud all the dogs and cats in a five-mile radius will run away but if you don’t actually see anything… is it really there? I think that’s the best mindset to have when working the night shift next to Ferngate. There’s no sense in getting yourself in a tizzy from hearing, let’s say, giant footsteps stomp around the cemetery, or random outbursts of maniacal laughter. None of that really matters, if you stay on your side of the river, you’ll be fine… usually.

I say usually because things have been a little more unpredictable lately. Maybe that’s my fault but it’s hard to blame yourself for what you can’t remember. All I know, is if I could go back to last night, I would mind my own business.

On the far side of the stone bridge there’s an old timey light post that’s equipped with a gas-powered flame. I was somewhere in between getting Karl, one of the regulars, another PBR and shoeing the abnormally large grey alley cat, Chubb’s, off the counter again when I first noticed him. There was a man leaning against the antique light post… and he looked very out of place.

I try not question the unexplainable sounds that I hear at night but seeing this man with my own eyes was a completely different story. Questions popped right into my mind, like does he live in the cemetery? Is he already dead? Is he an unusually well-dressed homeless man stuck in the wrong century? I don't know. I'm not even sure what his name is. I only know him by the nickname I’ve given him, The Aristocrat.

I call him that because of his attire. He was dressed in the finest clothes money could buy… in the eighteen-hundreds. His green and white regency suit was tailored perfectly to his tall and slender frame like feathers on a bird of prey. He would periodically look up and down the street and then check his gold pocket watch as if he were expecting someone. All of us at the bar were captivated, he was like an actor that had walked onto the stage, and we were waiting in silent anticipation for the show to start. Or at least Sophia and I were captivated, Karl was not. 

“Ha! Check out that soft-footed ninny”

My attention abruptly shifted from the strange and handsome man across the street to the balding redneck in front of me with a beer gut so large it almost required its own seat.

“Uh…what?”

“City boy must be lost. Theo why don’t you go over there and tell that poor fella he looks like a left-handed foozle”

“Is that even an insult?” It took me a moment to shake Karl’s stupid drunk ramblings out of my head. “And no, I’m not going over there, I’m staying right here behind the bar.”

“Fine I’ll take care of this myself.” He spun his barstool around and took a deep breath, raising his entire beer gut in preparation for what he was about to yell. “Hey! you there boy, why do you look so silly.”

Yea… I could tell this was going to end in some kind of hate speech.

“Karl, you can’t shout insults at people from the bar, that’s not good for business”.

He gestured across the street with obvious frustration. “What do you expect me to do? Somebody’s got to say something.”

“I expect you to sit there and act like a normal person. But it looks like that’s not going to happen.” 

I played the scenarios out in my head and didn’t see this reflecting well on me or the Fox Den if I didn’t do something. “I’ll tell you what, if I go over there and talk to him, will you shut up?”

“Yes, I will”, he said with smug satisfaction. I swear he has one of the most punchable faces I’ve ever seen.

“Ok fine, but one more word and you’re out of here”.

He pointed a chubby sausage finger gun at me and winked, I don’t even know what that was supposed to mean.

I thought about asking Karl why he didn’t go over there himself but decided against it. This was probably the best way to minimize the damage and it would give me an opportunity to apologize on Karl’s behalf, which was something he would never do by his own volition.

On the way across the street, I couldn’t help but remember the words that were hastily carved on the backside of the bar, “Don’t cross the bridge. Ever”. I’m not sure who wrote them, but they didn’t leave much wiggle room in there. I reminded myself to ask Karl about it when I got back, his butts probably been fused to that stool longer than I’ve been alive.

With the bar top warning in mind, I decided I wouldn’t go all the way across the bridge, I’d just awkwardly half yell at the man from my side of the river instead.

“Hi, I work at the bar across the street and just wanted to apologize for the drunk guy yelling obscenities, he’ll be kicked out if it happens again, sorry about that. Anyways do you… need any… help with…. anything?” I trailed off during that last part like I’d fallen into a pool full of cold molasses. What was wrong with this guy’s eyes? They were arctic blue and staring straight through me… the longer I maintained eye contact with him the more it felt as if I were falling into an empty pit. They were the eyes of an insane man, a man whose entire world had been bent by his own grandeur.

Did I just take a step forward? Yup sure did, I don’t remember telling my feet to do that. I shuffled back on to the sidewalk while keeping my eyes fixed on the man.

The Aristocrat tucked his medium length blonde hair behind his ears and put away his pocket watch. “Theo, I’m glad you’re here. I was beginning to think you wouldn’t make it.” As he said this a wry smile curled up the side of his mouth, exposing his perfect white teeth.

I gulped louder than a bullfrog. “You were expecting me? How do you know my name?”

“Yes, I was expecting you, and I know your name the same way the moon knows to come out at night, I know you like fear knows darkness, and anxiety knows a quiet moment.”

“Ok…” I didn’t know what else to say so I opted for the Theo classic of uncomfortably long silence.

Damnit, I took two steps this time. I backed off the bridge again.

“Well, uhm” The Aristocrat, realizing I wasn’t going to say anything else, cleared his throat and doubled down on the creepiness, “as long as we’re asking questions Theo, then I’ve got some for you.” 

“Ok shoot.”

“Do you want to know the day you’re going to die? Or even more delightful, how she’s going to do it?”

“Nah, I’m good… I uh think I’m going to head out now.” That’s a big fat nope sandwich. Next time I’m going to let Karl yell at anybody he wants to until they run away. People are so weird around here. And now I’ve taken three steps on the bridge, that’s it I did my due diligence, I’m out. I backed up with my eyes still on him, determined to make it safely back to the bar even if I had to crab walk all the way there. 

“Theo”, he said in a sing song voice, “I have a proposition for you, and I think you’ll want to hear it.”

Do you ever hear people say they sleep better outside? From my limited experience that’s a bunch of crap. Especially when by outside you mean a graveyard and instead of using a pillow you slam your head against a tombstone and leave it propped up at an awkward angle all night. That’s the position I found myself in the next morning with a pounding headache and my belly in the dirt. 

I rolled over with a groan and was doused with a cold bucket of adrenaline as I half slid into a large hole. My hands flailed behind me and barely grabbed ahold of the tombstone before I fell in. Squirming and grunting like a drunk zombie I pulled myself up and scrambled to my feet. Apparently, I had passed out in between an empty grave and a shovel. I looked around me…nobody there, that’s good. I looked at my hands… completely covered in blisters, not good. I might not be a morning person and my faculties hadn’t fully returned to me yet, but I knew one thing, I had to get the hell out of there.

I stumbled back through the labyrinth of oaks and marble in a slow daze. I took a few wrong turns, caught some unfriendly glances from Joes and Janes on their morning walk, and promptly stepped into the largest dog turd I’ve ever seen. I don’t know if the owner went home to get a hefty bag or just gave up on it all together, but it was impressive to say the least. 

Eventually I spotted the tall iron gates and was halfway over the bridge when I heard my name being shouted at me. 

“Theo! What happened to your face?”

O boy, here we go.

Sharron, who’s in charge of the day shift, hustled over and grabbed me by the shoulders with unusually strong hands.

“Wow you look terrible”, why was she smiling… “Did you sleep in there?” She nodded towards Ferngate and made a face like someone smeared old mustard on her upper lip.

“I wouldn’t call it sleep… I don’t know what happened. The last thing I remember I was talking to the Aristocrat.”

Probably shouldn’t have said that.

“Who’s that?” 

For some exhausted reason unbeknownst to me, I proceeded to tell her everything I remembered about the night before. Thankfully I was smart enough to leave out what I awoke to this morning. She responded with a flabbergasted exhalation and surprisingly offered to make me a cup of coffee, which might be the nicest thing she’s ever done. I wasn’t about to turn down coffee, but I had a very strong suspicion she thought I was making it all up.

The truth is I’ve long since accepted the fact that ninety nine percent of people won’t believe the strange things that happen at Ferngate after dark. I don’t understand the phenomenon but all the regulars at the bar during the night shift have acknowledged it. We’ve started referring to them as daytime normies, I guess that makes us nighttime crazies, but we can’t all be crazy, right?

Once back inside the bookstore half of the Fox Den Sharron tossed me a Keurig cup and told me I smelled bad. In hindsight I should have left the shoes outside. I took them off and proceeded to make myself a cup of coffee.

As I sat hunched over in a red leather armchair, I sipped my way back to consciousness and scrolled through my memories like a rolodex. I was searching for anything that might illuminate last night’s events, but nothing was there. I began to consider going back to my old job and forgetting all about the Fox Den and Ferngate and all the things that made me question my sanity. It was right after that, that the train came off the tracks… Wait a minute, what was my old job? No matter how hard I tried I couldn’t remember. I moved on and tried to remember the job before that… nothing. College… nothing. Ex-girlfriend… nothing. Family…old friends… family pet… trip to the zoo… nothing. I couldn’t remember anything before the day I started working at the Fox Den. I can recall everything since then, with one exception, last night.

I gripped the armchair in a confused panic as my world spiraled out of control. But after some deep breathing and mild cursing the spiral calmed down. Turns out there’s only so much you can panic about when all you can remember is a few months. Eventually I resigned myself to the fact that I wasn’t going anywhere. I was going to keep working at the Fox Den because it’s literally all I know. Somehow, I would put together a plan to find the Aristocrat and get my memories back. Until then I’ve decided to start keeping a journal. It’ll function as a sort of back up drive to my brain just in case this happens again.

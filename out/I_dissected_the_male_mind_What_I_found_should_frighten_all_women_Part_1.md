  

I’m a woman in the little known, but male-dominated field of gender necrochemistry, so I don’t get much opportunity to conduct my own studies. My ideas are either laughed at or scorned, with my male counterparts more interested in my t\*\*s and a\*\* than anything I have to say.

One colleague, who shall remain nameless, suggested I wear the lacy black teddy he bought me, rather than the traditional white smock. He turned the lab lights down low and played *The Weeknd* as we sliced up a ferret brain. 

I remained in the smock and used the teddy to mop up a formaldehyde spill. 

As noxious as this was, it gave me an idea for my own research project: dissecting the male mind. To see how it ticked.

You heard me correctly. The goal was to create an anatomy of the male *mind*, rather than the physical *brain,* by immersing the latter in a proprietary chemical bath. This accomplished, experimental electrodes would be attached in a manner I will not reveal for fear my method will fall into the wrong hands. I would then download the data and gain valuable insight into masculine mind and all that consumed it, both lurid and mundane.

I wrote a proposal and received funding from an all-female angel investor group. Thrilled and scared, I launched the project.

The raw materials were collected from random graveyards by my crack team of graduate assistants. With only shovels and hacksaws, they were able to obtain a dozen minimally decomposed brains from a variety of recently interred males. Ages ranged from eighteen to one hundred and two, as indicated by the death dates chiseled into headstone markers of varying quality and expense. 

The project was arduous. 

And a complete failure—for my method of analysis, alas, did not work on the deceased male brain.

Devastated, for I was not used to failure, I ordered my assistants to return the physical brains from whence they had come, reinsert them in the cranium, and attach that to the neck. Each grave was groomed to appear as if the area had been untouched.

I spent many sleepless nights alone in the lab, drinking stimulants from a flask, watching the sun rise and fall, rise and fall. I had a fear of losing and was on the precipice of full-fledged catastrophe. Where, oh, where, had I gone wrong?

One miserable week turned into two. No answers came. 

I sent everyone else home with full pay. My funding was nearly gone, but I wasn’t going to make them suffer for my mistake. 

Alone, I was able to clear my head.

Twenty-four hours later, my angel investors pounding the door, demanding a status report, a breakthrough came. Exultant, I drained my flask dry.

Face unwashed, my naturally curly hair sprouting in all directions, I danced wildly down an aisle, unbolted the double-locked lab door and greeted my visitors with open arms. 

“Hello ladies! So glad you’re here!” I squalled, heedless that doing so would be frowned upon by the money crowd, the ladies in matching Peter Pan collar business suits.

“Where’s everyone else?” asked Eloise, CEO of the all-female venture capital group; the secretive angel investors whose mission, I’d been told, was to turn my insights about the male psyche into a database. And to then allow all women access for a nominal charge. 

To even the playing field. Or tilt it in favor of us. 

Suspicious, Eloise surveyed the empty lab. She stopped at the flask in my hand.

“I gave them a week off—with pay!” I said, still unable to contain my boundless joy. 

“Using *our* money.” Eloise darkened. She turned to her fellow investors. Their faces were a portrait gallery of malice and anger.

“Ladies, ladies, calm down,” I said, regaining my senses to the degree that my mixed drink allowed. Imminent disaster can do that. “You came here for a report, right?”

Still grim, Eloise nodded.

“Well, I have good news and bad news.” I forced a smile. “The bad news? My approach had a fatal flaw. It could not, as I had initially surmised, extract the desired information from a dead male brain. While many of my female scholars have postulated *brain dead* as the default position of men, which is why I worked with exhumed heads, the results prove that assumption to be mere opinion and not medical fact.”

“In other words, our investment in you is a total loss,” Eloise spat.

“You’re getting ahead of yourself,” I admonished, “Because you haven’t heard the good news.”

“Which is what?”

“Left alone for hours on end, free from the daily pressures of eating, sleeping and interacting with others in a socially acceptable manner, I stumbled upon the Holy Grail; the answer that had always been there but I had been unwilling to see due to moral and ethical prohibitions from which I had finally, in my fevered isolation, been freed.”

Antsy, looking at her watch, Eloise asked, “And your epiphany, the *a-ha* moment that came to you while you were lurching aimlessly around this million-dollar, now trashed, lab, built entirely to your specifications, is?”

“I need living brains.”

“We will not allow mice or rats to be harmed. The firm has a position against animal cruelty.”

I took a deep breath. This was the money shot. Sink or swim. Most likely sink, because animal activists would never agree to—

“I’m referring to mentally active men. We’ll strap them to an operating table, remove their craniums with a bone saw and attach my proprietary electrodes. It’s a controversial step, but I guarantee results. We’ll gain complete insight into the minds of men. For you to use as you please.”

Eloise seemed to weigh my words. Finally, after clearing her throat, she asked, “How many men—I mean study subjects—will you require?”

“Twelve to fifteen.” 

Did I really say that? Was success more important to me than human lives? Not that I wouldn’t fuse the craniums back together in a way so that no one—not even the study subjects—would notice. But still… 

Eloise turned to one of the other women. “Make sure she gets everything she needs.”

I didn’t let my emotions show until the ladies were out the door and well down the hall. Then I leapt onto a counter and tap danced to the other end, test tubes and decanters crashing to the floor.

I had crossed a moral and ethical line. 

Which filled me with unalloyed joy!

After all, I was a scientist in search of answers, and dead men have only so much information to give. Living male subjects, on the other hand, would be a cornucopia of up-to-date data.

Therefore, what might sicken others exhilarated me. 

Insights into the male mind could be put to noble use. Like short-circuiting the male predisposition towards war, sexual aggression and hockey fights.

I couldn’t wait to be showered by the warm mist spewing from my bone saw as it worked its way around a living male skull.

This happened when I was between 4 and 16 years old, in my previous house I was always skeptical until I started seeing him in my house, a man almost 2 meters tall totally in black. If it had only been me who saw it, I would say that they were things of my imagination, but I was not the only one who saw it. 

A few years later, when I was already 8, they began to leave me at home alone and this only increased my activity. One day I was in the living room and I heard footsteps, the record clarifies that I lived in a not very big house but you couldn't get to hear the neighbors. 

The footsteps came from my parents' room, first I heard how they got up from the bed, they could wear some shoes and they walked clumsily, a while later I heard that they started running down the hall, I ran out of the house and when my parents found his work boots in the room across from where I was previously.

 Afterwards I always saw it out of the corner of my eye without having the courage to look if it was really there or not. A few years later when we decided to hire a cleaning lady they did not know anything about the man of the house Until one day we found the house with the door open and we didn't find the lady anymore, a few days later she told us that since we left there had been someone in my room and when she entered she saw a man sitting at my desk. 

He said he felt an instinct to run before it noticed his presence. When he turned 14 I stopped seeing him but whenever he turned off the light he felt him and he never looked into the darkness because he knew it was there One stormy day the power went out and I stopped to go to the living room and collided with something cold and tall. So scared I was paralyzed. Already in my last years in that house when we decided to move because the situation became complicated with school, because my little sister had been born and was about to start elementary school. Did things get really creepy? Now I saw it again in every corner.

My dad wants to be the only one who hadn't seen it, he began to see it and our guests felt watched. Then one day my little sister was playing under a big heavy mirror and the mirror just fell off. The supports were fine, it was as if someone had done it on purpose, my little sister was lucky that she didn't fall on top of it. 

This was already in the last week before we moved I was lying down and I couldn't tell you if it was a dream or not but. I woke up to see the door to my room open and my sister standing in front of the door with my iPhone in her hand...

Behind her was the I had never seen him so present he was no longer a shadow now he looked good The clothes covered his entire body and only his hands could be seen, they were black without an iota of light and his face I did not dare to see On my cell phone there was a video so to speak it was me lying down sleeping and next to me a tarantula, as soon as I finished the video it said I don't need you anymore. 

I fainted, when I regained consciousness I felt something fall off next to me but it couldn't be my cats and I turned around, there was one of the largest tarantulas I had ever seen in my life. I couldn't tell you why but I knew that tarantula was about to sting me I called my parents and they killed her I couldn't sleep anymore after that in that house On the last day in that house before we left, when I got in the car to go out, I saw him standing at the window that overlooked the living room, staring at me. With melancholy I greeted him and for the first time I saw him move he returned my greeting To this day, 2 years later, the new owners of the house told us that they feel that there is someone in the house and the house partially burned down. And not long ago, talking to a former neighbor, an older lady told us the story of that house. 

It turns out that before there was a policeman who killed a thief who entered the house and months later the wife of that policeman committed suicide because he said that someone was chasing him. I don't know anything about the police. I only have one thing that intrigues me to this day You saw that when a gun fires it leaves the castle I found it in the courtyard in front of the window that opened to my room I have it saved as a souvenir and there are days when I feel that someone is looking at me when I touch it...

the story is real and it is more an experience that I come to share than a story

“You want me to have an erection at work all day?”

Laura bit her lip and stroked my cheek. She knows that scrambles my brain. “I love the thought of having so much control,” she cooed before running her fingertips along my ribs.

I closed my eyes. “I work with the *elderly*, Laura.”

“What a treat for them,” she responded, gazing up at me. 

I got lost in her green eyes as my wife’s fingers aroused parts of my body that aren’t supposed to be sexual. “So you’re telling me,” I began, anxious, “that you want me to tie you to the bed all day long, until – until I get back from work?”

She nodded, hungry, moving her eyes so that they never broke contact with me.

“And you want to be naked the entire time?”

Her breath caught as I looked around the restaurant, paranoid that every stranger could hear our conversation. Laura nodded again, slower this time, gazing at me with grave seriousness.

“On top of that, you want me to-” I swallowed, dropping my voice lower still. “You want me to film this on a *live stream* that only I can see?”

“Fuck, Johnny,” she gasped, “I love hearing you say it aloud.” She grabbed my hand and squeezed it to the point of physical pain. “Promise me that you’ll do it, and that you’ll constantly be checking the camera?”

We stared at each other for a silent moment.

“You’re a freak,” I breathed.

“I love you too, honey.”

People complain about their marriages because it’s a common assumption that we have to be unhappy, and sharing that unhappiness with strangers makes us feel less lonely when we go back to the ostensibly most important person in our lives. We all have that high school crush who flipped our insides simply by being in eyeshot, and we learn to accept that those feelings aren’t destined to endure past early adulthood. Each endorphic crush is our own secret, because no one will ever see *that* person the same way we do; the magic comes from the fact that they’re just a normal person seen through a prism to which no one else has access. 

That’s not how it worked out for me at all. Nausea hit the first time I saw Laura, and I could never understand how everyone else was able to act normally around her. She saw something parallel in me, we played off each other, and we’re still in the honeymoon phase of our marriage. 

We’re both perverts with odd fetishes, so it works out quite well.

“Johnny, will you put down that fucking phone and pay attention?” Terrance snapped. 

I glanced up to see nineteen people staring at me, thirteen of whom had joined the meeting since I last checked. I prayed that the redness in my face was not as visible as it felt. 

I had, after all, been watching porn in a room full of coworkers. 

“Do you think you can keep your head out of your ass for the rest of the day?” Terrance asked, still pissed.

If I’ad answered honestly, I would have been fired there and then.

I tried to control myself after returning to my cubicle following the meeting. I failed to control myself after returning to my cubicle following the meeting.

Whipping out my phone with a shaking hand, I glanced around to ensure that no one was watching. After being 80% sure, I pulled up the live stream.

Laura lay on our bed, wrists and ankles bound to four different corners. Her breasts heaved slowly with each breath; after staring for a few seconds, my eyes wandered southward. Because of the way her ankles were tied, Laura’s splayed pussy was on full view. 

My mouth went dry. 

I nearly dropped the phone when I saw the shadow creep across our bedroom floor. Due to her position, Laura couldn’t see the figure moving toward her. I wanted to scream, to call her and tell her to run, but it wouldn’t do any good: her bound wrists kept her from reaching her phone. The office was half an hour drive from home, so I had no choice but to sit and watch.

*Fuck.* It was that creep Ned who lived in the apartment downstairs. I recognized his greasy hair immediately. I’d once caught him sniffing our garbage when he thought Laura’s tampons were in there, and had since found his name on an internet search for registered sex offenders in my neighborhood.

And now he was in my bedroom, where my wife was alone and tied to the bed where I’d left her. 

I swear that my heart stopped beating.

And I nearly keeled over when he pulled out the enormous knife.

Most people think that fear is a ghost in the mirror or strange sounds that whisper through the trees at night. That’s horseshit; true fear is watching a loved one facing mortal peril and wondering how life could be worth living after each day becomes a reminder that our happiest moments have passed. Every horror story is just a weak echo of this primal survival instinct.

That’s when Laura was able to turn her head just enough to see him. They gazed at one another for a few frozen seconds.

Then Ned smiled. He moved on her. 

Laura dropped her jaw. Her mouth opened three inches, then six inches, then nine.

Then a foot. Two feet.

Her tongue slithered out like a snake. It was timid at first; Ned gawked at it before thrusting his knife forward.

I really wish that the live stream had audio, because I wanted to know his verbal reaction when the tongue darted like a python and wrapped around his arm. There’s no way that it was louder than my own gasp as my wife’s supernatural tongue, now several feet long, squeezed Ned’s arm, shattering it. 

The subsequent screams were definitely louder than mine, however. I could see him wailing as my mouth hung open in silent horror. 

My extremely confused erection decided to stick around as my entire body stalled in a state of horrified paralysis. 

Ned punched Laura’s tongue with his right hand. His destroyed left arm was entirely useless, and unfortunately for him, that had been the one holding the knife. I had no way to process how weird the situation was as my wife’s demon tongue destroyed our neighbor.

Then it got weirder.

Laura retracted her tongue a few inches at a time. Ned threw back his head and jerked side to side, but his efforts were fruitless: Laura was just too strong. I watched him sob as his arm descended into Laura’s mouth, followed by his shoulder, head, chest, stomach, and finally his legs. Laura swallowed him whole, burped, and looked at the camera.

She knew I was staring back. 

Then she dropped her jaw, launched her tongue at the camera like a rocket, and feed cut to static. 

The good news is that my wife is alive. The bad news is that the love of my life is some kind of a demon-witch thing. 
Remember what I said about fear? Multiply that by the number ‘fuck, no.’ I’ve been sleeping next to this creature every night, and if she wants me dead, I don’t see any way to save myself.

I have no idea what to do. I don’t know if she could pick up the phone with her tongue if I called, and I have no idea what I would say if she answered. I don’t see how she can be human. My erection has no hope of abating. I’m not sure if I should come to my wife’s aid or run away forever. I can’t call the police, because I don’t want to be arrested for making a prank call. 

So what’s my next move? Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Because I’m quite certain that every choice is a bad one, and I’d love to have someone else to [blame for it](https://www.facebook.com/P-F-McGrail-181784199029462/).

You see, since I was 12, I had been a MASSIVE rugby fan. I played it all the time, and it was safe to say that I was the largest and most talented at rugby. I knew all the tactics, such as how to fuck someone up if they were in my way, and how to take someone's head off by roundhouse kicking them. Suffice to say, I was spectacular at rugby, even taking down the over 18s in my area.

Well, because I was this good, my school offered to take me and the rugby group to America. We had a trip to a school near Scottsdale in Arizona. First impressions was that the neighbourhood was sketchy. Everywhere we went, we saw either 7 year old kids with a pistol in the back pocket, or 40 year old drunkards with an AK47 in their bags.

Well, that's America I guess!

So, our trip was for around 4 month. Yes, I know what the comments will say. 'Holiday for 4 months. Cap.' And my response to that is shut up you soppy twats. Our school was rich. And I mean HELLA rich!  We got the best teachers and ratings for a grammar school in all of London (and the south). The teachers could've afforded for us to go for a year, but the parents were worried for their children (rightfully so).

But how bad can 4 months in a foreign country be? Not that bad we thought.

Fuck, we were wrong!

Well, we went there and our school rented a few apartments for all of us children to stay in, and we were taught at the school on the outskirts of Scottsdale. Don't get me wrong, but the school was a decent size. It boasted around a 50000 square foot property, with around 6 football fields worth of playgrounds. But it seems that eventhough everyone is allowed guns, they still don't make sure that the children are safe. Literally, ANYONE could walk inside the school and act as though they were supposed to be there.

So, imagine 2 months into our trip, a 35 year old man who had lost his son in a court battle to his cheating mother rocked up in our school with around 40 magazines full of pure lead, and a 'toy' that could shoot around 8 bullets per second.

No, this wasn't the brand new, out-of-this-world sub-machine nerf gun that was sold for Â£300 in Walmart. This man was holding a fucking AK-12 and pumping lead into every child he could see.

Well, the school went into lockdown and had every child locked into a room. How fucking stupid is America. Locking themselves in with a murderer?

POP! POP! POP! And then it went silent for a few minutes. Then closer to my room. POP! POP! POP! And then the whimpering stopped.

Well, being locked in with a bunch of fresh victim, I don't blame him for pumping 70 children and 15 staff members full of lead. Well, imagine hiding in a class, underneath a desk and a madman with an AK-12 bangs on the door. Yeah. I can imagine!

Well, it was a few minutes before any of the armed forces rocked up in the SWAT vehicles and blow up this motherfucker. And this guy had around 10 magazines left, after running around shooting every insect he could find. Well, from underneath the desk, I could see the walls being repainted with a new tint of blood and brains. Before it was met with its last bucket full of paint, which splattered on my hands while I was sprawled on the floor, trying my hardest not to breathe whilst the average American  man with his 8 remaining magazines just completed what one could call... self-annihilation. He killed himself at exactly 4:03pm.

Well, since this was a normal occurrence for the police, they just recorded it, threw the bodies into the back of a van and just SKRRTED off. Peak from the cops!

Well. This is when it gets bad!

After a 2 week holiday where the children were able to lick their wounds, we were finally able to come back to the place that was on the brink of collapse a few days ago. As if nothing had happened, the children from Scottsdale were chatting to each other. As if no children got brutally murdered, the teachers continued teaching! AS IF NO MAN CAME IN TO GET REVENGE ON HIS FAMILY, we continued to sit down in the room where I was having a bath in the other children's brains.

Well, I don't blame the ghost of the man who pumped 70 children full of lead to come back and haunt the school after what he did was dismissed. It wasn't as though the children didn't talk about it because they were scared. No, no, no! They didn't talk about it because it was normal for them.

So, let me set the scene for you. Our parents in London were outraged since we kept going to the same school. The school didn't even try to protect us, or set up any security. It was... just the same. And us children were forced day after day to go to that hell.

So, errrrm. Since I got into trouble by roundhouse kicking someone who was 4 years older than me and breaking one of their ribs, I had an afterschool detention. I thought that I was getting away with it. They were letting me off easy.

So, I went to the detention and their were no staff left over. I was told to just stay in a room for 2 hours, by myself. Stupid, ya know! That's what I thought, being left alone to do whatever I wanted for a few minutes.

That was until I heard it!

POP! POP! POP! Then silence. POP! POP! POP! Then the whimpering stopped. POP! POP! POP! It was outside my door. From underneath the desk, I peeked out and looked through the door. Through the windows, the man was stood there, staring at me. Well, what I could see as half of his head remained, the rest an empty void. I could see that the walls were repainted again. A darker tint of brain and bloods. And on the floor too! My hands sticky with the blood covering the floor. I looked at the clock. Thought it was covered in blood, I could vaguely see the time. It was 3:59pm. And for what felt like an eternity, the man just stared at me through the transparent windows on the door. And then at 4:03pm he did it again. He told me that he had spared me.

For now!

And then he just blasted his brains out, and it covered the windows, showing nothing but a dark, red stain in his absense.

Well, that was just the start of what was to come later. I may post again since reddit is a place where I can get all of this off my mind.

But all I can say is this.

Fuck America!

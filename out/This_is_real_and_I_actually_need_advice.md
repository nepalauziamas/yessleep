It's been going on since I was like 8-9 but I never really payed attention until a couple of years ago. First encounter was when I was 8-9 and heard very loud kid crying, then after that for years I've been hearing whispers,always sounds like a little kid. last week I felt incredibly uncomfortable and then my stomach dropped at the feeling of someone watching me and standing over me. It was an overwhelming feeling of fear. Then last night I felt the same thing again  just a bit toned down and it also came with whispering. I'm used to the whispers ,but last night they were excessive, constant whispers for a good few minutes, "hey "hello" I'm right here" you hear me" shit like that for like 5-10 minutes and it's always the same voice, except one whisper that sounded slightly different. And now its nearly 4 in the morning. I cant sleep. I feel incredibly uneasy. The room I was in started to make me feel nauseous. I started to smell something like burning hair. I woke someone up to go and check it out and nothing. He didn’t smell anything and he felt completely fine. Meanwhile, im in the same room and it smells very strongly of burning fucking hair. I went to a different room and felt fine. Them felt incredibly uneasy and had to go somewhere else. I don’t know what the fuck is going on. I need help.

The tall man was here at noon. 

The man said to rescue me from this cursed orphanage like a knight in shining armour.

He walked past me at first, like I was part of the wall, and I heard the scratching of a pen against paper and a murmur of voices. The Matron seemed like she was in a good mood today. Probably because another one of her ‘little goblins’ —as she put it— was leaving the orphanage for good.

And probably hoping I wouldn’t come back.

The tall man returned to the lobby, and I held my breath. He peered down at me from under his top hat. He had a bushy mustache and silvery-gray eyes. Then he noticed how I shrank against the wall even more and smiled like a shark.

“Kiko, right?

I nodded timidly.

He extended a hairy hand. I shook it.

“Come,” he said. His voice was loud, booming, bouncing off the hall. “I’ll take care of you, just like Chris and Angie.”

“Do not be afraid.”

Chris and Angie were the names of my parents. I barely knew them; they died six years ago. They said I ran out of the house crying while dying screams exploded out behind me.

My memories of them were faint, but I still missed them. I started to cry, mourning the life I could’ve led. 

Then I felt a lick on my wrist and I looked down to see a puppy on my lap. It was as dark as ebony, with a little tail that wagged and little floppy ears that twitched.

“Hey,” I said softly. “Where did you come from?”

I swore the puppy wasn’t there when I got into the car earlier that day, but then and again some time had already passed. I distinctly remembered falling asleep, my dreams rough with blood and claws. The only plausible explanation I could think of was that Daddy (as he insisted I called him) had gone to a pet store and bought me a puppy. Probably to help me settle in.

I appreciated it. Even back at the Orphanage I was better with animals than humans. They just seemed to love you unconditionally, no matter what, unlike the other kids who sneered and snickered and whispered when they thought your back was turned.

But even he was surprised when we pulled up in front of our new home. It was a two-storied monster, with dirty white walls and a wooden door, set against the shadows of a dark forest.

He gave the puppy a dirty look. It shrank back against my arms.

“All right, you can keep it,” he grumbled. “But you’re paying for its food out of your own pocket.”

I named it Zumi. It seemed to suit it. I took Zumi to the vet that night. I had to persuade Daddy to drive me since we were so far from town.

It was chaos the moment we walked in. Dogs started howling; cats started meowing; there was even a parrot that screeched so loudly my ears rang.

They were also thrashing against their leashes and their cages. One dog managed to break free. It made a dash for the road and I turned round just in time to see a truck slam into its small frame. Blood pooled into the drain.

Zumi was barking back. If it was human it would probably be swearing like a sailor.

I covered Zumi’s eyes at the screech of the van as my heart thumped away in my chest. The owner started to wail.

At that moment the vet called my name and I hurried inside with Zumi in my arms while Daddy attempted to calm everyone else down. Even then the more he tried, the worse the situation seemed to get. It was so noisy that I couldn’t hear what the vet was talking about. Something about Zumi being a girl and that she had no health problems whatsoever. Even as my thoughts raced it gave me a sense of peace.

“Why were they like that?” I asked Daddy as we walked back to the car together.

He avoided my eyes and wiped something red off his chin. Then he handed me a hot dog from the stand.

“Thanks,” I said. Juice dribbled down my chin.

He still didn’t speak as we were driving back to the house. But then he gave me some new clothes and said gruffly, “Take a shower. Get all that grime off ya.”

I was grateful. Back at the Orphanage everything I had were hand-me-downs. Used stuff. I remember being at garage sales or at charity drives and givers would give me clothes with a poor-dear-look in their eyes. Never really had anything new in my life.

But behind the hiss of water from the tap I swore I heard the door unlock.

But when I stepped out to dry myself the door was tightly shut. So maybe I had just imagined it. The tiredness of a long day and a longer drive would have done things to my mind.
*Yeah, that’s probably it.*

He led me to bed after my bath and tucked me in. He ruffled my hair and kissed my cheek. It made me feel weird.

But then that weird tingling feeling was replaced with one of fear the moment the light was turned off.

I wasn’t afraid of the dark. Never was. But this time, as the shadows closed in on my small frame and the moon shone relentlessly through the window, my heart was pounding, my head was whirling. Too many questions.

Too many fears. 

Then my thoughts were broken down by a howl that sent chills up my spine.

I reached out for Zumi, but then I realised Daddy wouldn’t allow her to sleep near me. She had to sleep downstairs, near the fire. I tiptoed to the window and looked out.

My heart once again stopped at my chest.

A shadow of the dog was on the grass. She was looking up at the full moon. Howling away.

Then she bounded off into the forest, and disappeared into the shadows.

The howls still echoed like a siren. I forced myself away from the window and into bed. I tossed and turned but sleep wouldn’t come. I kept on thinking about the dog. How close it was. Even the shadows morphed into the dog in my room, getting closer and closer to my face, puppeteered by the moon.

And when sleep finally came, I had nothing but nightmares.

***

Zumi was happy to see me the next morning even though I was moving like a zombie. I couldn’t stop thinking of that dog last night. She was wagging her tail and licking my hand. I ruffled her fur. It was as soft as a cloud and it made me feel better.

The smell of bacon wafted in from the kitchen.

Daddy set down a plate of bacon and scrambled eggs in front of me. 

“I ate before you woke up,” he explained. “It’s nice and hot; eat up.”

I started to eat. It was delicious. Daddy watched me with a shark smile, and his eyes misted. 

When I was done I helped to wash the dishes. Rain was dribbling down the window and a light breeze kissed my cheek. In the distance I could hear thunder. I was hoping to explore the woods with Zumi but that was no longer a possibility. Daddy took me by the shoulder and led me to the sofa.

“Let’s watch Sleeping Beauty, all right?”

But while the movie was playing there was a *scritch scritch scratch* on the walls.

I turned around. The walls were moving. Pulsing like a heartbeat.

Zumi must’ve noticed it too, because she came to the walls and started to growl.

I turned back to Sleeping Beauty, trying to ignore how the hairs were rising up on my skin. The scratching was louder than the audio.

Daddy shifted closer and put an arm around my shoulder.

I tried not to flinch.

“Must’ve been the rats,” he said. His brow furrowed slightly.

Then:

“Why don’t you play outside?”

I blinked at him. It was true the rain had stopped; the sun had come out and started to smile. Daddy closed the magazine he was reading— the one which I had tried so hard not to peek at because it was so disturbingly disgusting—stood up and stretched.

“Go out and play,” he repeated steadily. “I’ll clean up.”

I nodded meekly.

Zumi wouldn’t stop growling at the walls no matter how hard I tried to drag her away, so I went out by myself into the woods. The weather was perfect. A crisp breeze ruffled my hair. The fresh air tasted so sweet. It was like nothing I had before.

But as the trees closed in the further I ventured into the woods, the more scared I was. They were much taller than me, and at this point I couldn’t see the sky. Shadows crept beyond the horizon, and I heard ravens cawing.

It was the only sound in this forest. I couldn’t even hear my own footsteps. My shoes were sinking deep into the moss, almost like quicksand. I felt I was creeping deeper into something I should not see or hear or touch.

The caws grew louder and louder. I could see the shadows of birds on the branches, and their wings beat on the trunks.

There was a small clearing just ahead, where the sun screamed at the shrivelling grass. Flies were buzzing over something in the centre. There were ravens around it too, diving down and tearing out bits of flesh like a pack of hungry vultures. Then I approached the carcass—cautiously—and my heart beat a thousand times faster.

It lay on its side, the fur covering the bones like a blanket. Dried blood clung onto the ribcage, and sinew dripped on the moss. The poor deer looked like it spent its last hours in agony, and its limbs were twisted in impossible ways in an attempt to flee. 

Worst of all were the fur. Black fur strewn all over the moss, until you couldn’t tell which was green and which was black.

I could hear heavy breathing. I looked frantically around, my palms sweating and my knees knocking together like wobbly noodles. I thought I saw something moving in the distance, a shadowy blur too fast to see, with a tail that wagged and paws that twitched.

Then all was quiet again—no breathing, no caws, and I found that I didn’t want to stand in front of a deer carcass any longer, so I turned and ran back the way I came, my screams echoing throughout the forest.

I burst into the house, screaming my throat bloody about the deer in the clearing, but then I stopped short at the scene before me.

The house was a mess. Wallpaper was torn away and hung down like broken skin, exposing moldy bricks. Furniture was thrown to the side and there were bloody paw prints everywhere. Guts and viscera dribbled down what was left of the wall.

A rat skull rolled to my feet, and what was left of its eyeballs dripped down like melted candle wax. It was the same as the deer I found in the forest: half fur, half bone, and an expression of abject terror.

I wondered if whatever attacked the deer in the forest had beaten me back here already. I wondered if Daddy and Zumi were safe. They were nowhere to be found.

Most importantly of all, I wondered whether *I* would be safe. I imagined the beast hiding in a corner that I couldn’t see, lurking, breathing, *waiting*…

There was a formidable growl coming from upstairs, and more rat skulls and guts cascaded onto the floor. I could hear shouts. Howls.

The bloody paw prints and viscera led upstairs, and into the master bedroom, all the way to her feet. Dried blood was smeared all over Zumi’s muzzle and she was drooling. Bones crunched.

I understood then, even as she snapped her teeth together, even as her fur stood up on end like sharp pins, even as she pawed the ground and growled…

Daddy lunged forward and locked together her snapping jaws.

“Go to your room!”

I was rooted to the ground.

“Now!” He roared.

I fled. I sat on my bed, listening to the howls and screams and the cracking of bones. I found a book called *Twilight*, but I couldn’t concentrate on the words. All that was running through my head, Zumi’s wolfish grin, the way she was looking at Daddy with the excitement of a hunter, the way she thrashed and squirmed and how Daddy was struggling to hold her back.

It gave me the shivers.

Every minute after that felt like agony. I couldn’t stop thinking of my dog and the beast she has become, and then Daddy, and then back to my dog again. I couldn’t even sleep, watching relentlessly as the sky faded into a deep orange and the sun sank beyond the horizon.

I was numb when I was called down for dinner. I was met with Daddy’s serious gaze. He still wasn’t eating; he quietly watched as I nibbled on my lamb chops. I pushed the food around on my plate. Then he spoke, and my heart sank when he said exactly what I feared.

“I’ve decided to sell that dog.”

I could still hear Zumi protesting upstairs with howls and whimpers.

“You’ve seen how it is. I saw it. The way it ate the rats! And when I tried to drag it away from me, look!”

He showed me a cut which was quickly fading into a scar.

I nodded uncomfortably. Tears sprung to my eyes and I turned away to wipe them on my sleeve. I really didn’t want to do it. Zumi was the only friend I ever had. Zumi will *always* be the only friend I ever have.

“I knew you would come around.”

There was something about the way he said it that made my skin crawl. Daddy was looking at me like I promised him I would buy exactly what he wanted for Christmas. His eyes were shining like gold coins, and he smiled, too wide, too much, showing decaying, yellowed teeth.

Then his arm snaked around my shoulder and his nails dug into my neck. He pushed his face closer to mine. Too close. I leaned away as far as I could, but he leaned it closer. His breath smelled like death.

He was laughing at me squirm.

“STOP TOUCHING ME!”

I tried to wriggle out of his grip. Daddy did not let go.

“You wouldn’t dare,” he growled.

“AND DON’T SELL ZUMI! SHE’S MY FRIEND! UNLIKE YOU!”

I bit my tongue immediately. I didn’t know where all that came from, but it felt so good to finally say it.

Daddy snapped. He howled at the thought that I would never be his. And what happened next was something I told my therapist Zena every day, something which I would never forget. Something that was branded into my nightmares forever.

His ears were rising, pushing itself to sit at the top of his head. His hands and feet stretched and curled into paws and claws. There was that sickening crunch as bones elongated, skin stretched into leather, and clothes ripped to make way for leathery, furry skin.

He howled, and my spine shivered, and then he sank newly-formed fangs into my arm.

I managed to shake him off then, scrambling away backwards as he advanced, drooling. My eyes darted around, looking for something to defend myself with, but all I could find were pots and pans, which I kept throwing to no avail.

*Thunk!*

I had hit a wall. He was almost on me now. His claws anchored onto my feet. He was so close that huge drops of spit were landing on my legs and I could smell death on his breath.

He was licking the side of his mouth in victory.

It was over.

I was going to die.

Suddenly a black blur flew from the top of the stairwell, and he yelped. Zumi was on him, and all I could see were claws, fangs, blood and a big ball of black fur. They were rolling around the room, howling and roaring, lunging at each other’s throats.

My face was white. I couldn’t think. I was shaking like mad.

Then reason flew back in my head and I fled like a frightened deer. So I ran. Ran right out of the house and all the way to the road without stopping in the night, then I collapsed at the side and cried for what seemed like hours.

***
Someone found me a few hours later and rushed me to the hospital.

I must’ve looked quite a sight: eyes wild, beads of sweat on my face, my mangled arm a mix of torn flesh and skin and blood with bone jutting out. For the first few hours I whimpered in pain while the doctors tried to figure out what to do with me.

But they needn’t have worried, for when they came back my arm looked brand-new. My bones had resettled; my skin had fused together, covering my wound.

I felt much better, right as rain, so they let me go after a day of observation. Back to the Orphanage.

I wish I still had Zumi for company. I haven’t seen her since that day. The bullying was worse than before. I was called a whore, on account of the fact that I was suddenly twice their height, towering way over them, and for the sudden onset of inky-black hair sprouting rapidly all over my body. They threw tampons at me and laughed as I tried to dodge them. It was horrible.

But they have started to leave me alone since yesterday. Even now I can see some of them glancing at me as I type all this out on the library computer. Their expressions haunt me.

Fear. 

Paranoia. 

The eyes of prey.

I was walking back from the cafeteria after lunch. They were relentless as usual, even when I screamed LEAVE ME ALONE in their faces. An argument followed. I was pushed into a corner.

I snapped. My bones began to crack. My skin began to stretch. Like leather.

[Right before I saw blood and screams rang into my ears, there was an unmistakable howl that chilled me to my bone.](https://www.reddit.com/r/SimbaKingdom/comments/vpixk6/boo/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)

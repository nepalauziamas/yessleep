So one day I visited a campsite in cardigan bay, wales, when I first visited you needed to go through a village. The village was small, yet really peaceful, me and my dad had borrowed my uncle’s BMW Z4 so of course we had the roof down, but while we were driving through the village, there were these cool people made out of wool that the village must have made (they were massive) but one caught my eye, one was hanging off a bridge and it was terrifying! Anyway, my dad drove us down this dirt road that led to the farm where the campsite was, we had to use this phone that was next to a train track as a train went straight across, once we called the controller on the phone there, we drove across, we called my dads mate to see where they were on the campsite and we started to head down there, my dad asked if I needed a p**s while we were going past the toilets next to the farm so I went cos we’d just been on a 5 hour drive.

As I went into the room, it had a shower, toilets, and you guessed it, more wool people!

There was one pirate inside a boat that took up a quarter of the room and then there was another figure, anyway I went for a p**s but the room was old and awful and I still didn’t trust the wool “things”, I hopped back in the z4 and we were off again, we got to the campsite and it was really nice, for me anyway, there was loads of land, nice people, and a gate leading to a rocky beach at the top but sandy at the bottom, we pitched up the tent, I got in my wetsuit and started snorkelling, it was fun but then I got out cos I had a rash all over my body (I have eczema) but I was not using the shower in that room, for one, u had to pay a quid for it to turn on, 2, the shower was rusty, and 3 I was not showering near those wool people, so I decided to shower in my dads mates caravan.

It ended up being a really fun day and we did loads, I ended up falling asleep at 12:30am but then woke up at 3:00 to needing a p**s rlly bad, I decided that taking a p**s in a bush there would be weird so I walked a mile down to the farm, my bladder feeling like it was about to explode, I eventually got to the building and I went for a p**s, while I was in the cubicle I heard the cubicle door next to me shut but I didn’t hear the door to the room open, I decided to go back when I realised that one of the wool creatures had knocked over and the cubicle was open with nobody in it, right then, the lights flickered off, it was like a horror movie, I pegged out of the room and as I was walking down, the train horn sounded but it sounded lower pitched than normal, I was s***ing myself by then so I ran back to my tent, the next day, the wool figures had disappeared out of the room, where they are still remains as a mystery and I have been back to the campsite again and I’ve only once taken a peek in the room, I haven’t once dared to go in

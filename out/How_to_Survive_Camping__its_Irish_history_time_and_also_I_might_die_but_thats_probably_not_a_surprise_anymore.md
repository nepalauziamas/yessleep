I run a private campground.  Sometimes I think that the sort of [stuff I deal with](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/kpdju6/how_to_survive_camping_rule_13_the_last_rule/) is ridiculous, and no, I’m not talking about the people who vomit all over the porta-johns after getting ludicrously drunk.  I’m talking about the inhuman things and all the brushes I’ve had with death.  I think - why is my job so terrible?  But I suppose there’s lots of terrible jobs out there.  Some might even be as dangerous as mine.  I hear late night security guards see a lot of weird stuff.  I guess I’m trying to keep from feeling sorry for myself.  I’ve been down a bit lately and that’s just not *me*.  I’m not a ‘good vibes only’ person, but I’ve always loved this campground and I love what I do, even if it is a little terrifying sometimes.

It’s just this worst of years is starting to wear me out, I think.

Anyway, if you’re new here, you should really [start at the beginning](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/clp5h4/how_to_survive_camping/) and if you’re totally lost, [this might help](https://www.reddit.com/r/goatvalleycampgrounds/comments/fz6a1d/how_to_survive_camping_index/).

Let’s talk about Balor and Lugh for a moment.  Yep, it’s Irish history time.

Balor was the leader of the fomorian host.  The fomorians are creatures of tyranny and cruelty, huge and misshapen.  I could recite a bunch of poetic prose at you about how fearsome or horrid Balor was, but this isn’t a book report, so I’ll just cut to the interesting part.  His eye.  His one eye that when he opened it, he laid waste to all that he gazed upon.  If Godzilla and Cyclops from X-Men had an illicit love child, it would be Balor.

Since we’re talking about giants already, have another random fact: the Romans believed that dinosaur bones were the bones of mythological giants and would try to classify what giant they came from.  Of course, given the sorts of creatures I deal with, I’m not convinced that all of those bones were merely dinosaur bones.  I read that in a book whose title I forget, a few chapters after the Roman birth control that involved stuffing a dead frog up you-know-where.

Don’t ever buy me a beer unless you want to be treated to an hour or more of random facts like this.

Okay, back to Irish history.  I would say sorry for the tangent, but I’m not.  I’m really not.

Lugh has resemblance to a sun god.  He is also the grandson of Balor and was foretold to be the one to slay him.  Of course, this resulted in shenanigans with Balor’s daughter being locked away, there was a quarrel over a cow (all the best wars in Irish history start with a cow), and then a revenge pregnancy and BAM, Lugh was born.  Lugh grew up to be talented in *everything*, which was highly respected by the Danaans.

I’m gonna go all book report here and cite directly from Myths & Legends of the Celtic Race by T.W. Rolleston because that’s what I usually go to when I need to look this stuff up.  “...the surname Ildanach is conferred upon him, meaning ‘The All-Craftsman’, Prince of all the Sciences; while another name that he commonly bore was Lugh Lamfada, or Lugh of the Long Arm.”

So for those of you that have kids, next time they complain about their homework, just remind them that they *could* grow up to be like Lugh, Prince of all the Sciences, if they just apply themselves.

Anyway, Lugh leads the Danaan to slaughter the fomorians instead of offering tribute and the war starts.  Some more stuff happens, the sons of Turenn kill Lugh’s father, then Lugh makes them bring him some magical things including a sweet spear, and then the sons of Turenn are mortally wounded in their quest and Lugh is like ‘nah die mad’ instead of saving them.  These early heroes are kind of complicated, they ain’t Captain America here.

Then there’s the final battle with the fomorians.  The one that is apparently being continued on my campground.  The second battle of Moytura, on a plain in the north of county Sligo.  Balor went all eyeball-Godzilla on the Danaan, killing at least one of their heroes and many others.  But then Balor’s eye began to droop in weariness and Lugh, seeing his chance, hurls a stone right through the giant’s eyeball and straight into his brain.  And so the tyrant Balor was killed and the fomorians routed.

You should really read up on this yourself.  I haven’t even touched on the harp that flies around and kills a bunch of fomorians.  Good stuff, that.

History is a complicated thing when these inhuman things are involved.  Patterns echo, louder than they do with our own history.  I wonder if this is why these two combatants found their way here, to continue their war.  If they are doomed to battle as they did so long ago, until the fomorian is slain as Balor was.  Perhaps that is the reason for the fairy’s confidence.

I also wonder if this is why Beau suffers like he does and why he’s earned the ire of the other campground inhabitants.  He is trying to expand his own pattern to something far greater than it is.

But enough about history and theorizing.  On to the stuff that happened this week and why I’m starting to feel a little exhausted from dealing with crisis after crisis.  Part of it is physical exhaustion, I suspect.  For lack of a solution, I’m dealing with the thorns the hard way.  Tearing them out by hand.  Every day I make my rounds around the campground and then head back to the garage and fetch a shovel and hoe and find a patch and get to work.  I rip out as much as I can and then do it all over again the next day.

I’m relying on my brother to do the research to figure out how to stop them for good.  He’s scouring the family notes for references to the gummy bears.  I think he’s a little sick of me pivoting his research focus, as he had to abandon going through our mother’s journal.  It can’t be helped.

At least the book I found in the attic is going to a dedicated reader.  The university’s rare manuscripts department thinks the book is from the mid-1800’s and found a student willing to go through it and photograph the pages for some extra credit.  I’ll hear back from them… eventually, I guess.  This is a college student we’re talking about, after all.

In the meantime, I’m just trying to hold ground on the campsite.  Keep the thorns from overwhelming us until we find a way to destroy them permanently.

It was a rare sunny day when I went out to remove a patch in a particularly bad location.  It was encroaching on the gas line that runs through my land and I didn’t know how deep the roots went, but I really didn’t want to find out and then have to involve public utilities in a supernatural war that cracked one of their pipes.  So I was there, on the edge of the woods, right where we started clearing the trees to keep them away from the line.  I was using plain hand tools because I was worried that these unnatural thorns would do something horrible to more sophisticated equipment and I’ve already wrecked enough stuff this year.

(thank you to the person who gave me that used four-wheeler, I know coordinating drop-off was a pain but it’s very appreciated)

The daylight hours are by no means safe on my campground, but I felt fairly at ease while clearing the thorns.  Most of the creatures that hunt in daylight hours set lures to draw people off the road and while I wasn’t on the road, I was at least in the open, and knew better than to follow anything strange.  The other creatures that seek people out are the harvesters and Beau, and I wasn’t particularly concerned about them.  So I focused on my task instead and as I worked, I saw something strange deep into the thicket of thorns.

They remind me of bird’s nests when they’ve had some time to grow.  Their black vines wind around each other, spiraling inwards before the outer layers branch out again to choke the surrounding plant life.  It forms an impenetrable wall of wiry fiber and vicious thorns.  I have to hack it away a little bit at a time, cutting through a handful of strands and then ripping those out before starting on the next layer.

This time, as I was tearing away a layer, I thought I saw something moving in the middle.

I stepped back, staring at it suspiciously.  When nothing happened, I tentatively poked at the thicket with my hoe.  Still nothing.  I tried hitting it a couple times.

Nothing.

Satisfied it was my imagination, I went back to work.

And then something moved again, as I was leaning in close to cut through some more vines.  It came tearing out of the center of the thicket, scuttling rapidly free, and I screamed and threw myself backwards as it lunged at my face.

Then it landed on the ground, pivoted, and scurried off into the woods.  I lay there on the ground, heart pounding and chest heaving.

It was a spider.  A rather large spider.

And it hadn’t thrown itself at me, it was merely trying to escape in case I accidentally killed it while removing the thorns.

Cautiously, I took up the hoe again and this time, I levered the thicket open, trying to see into the middle of it.  More spiders spilled out as I did so and this time I ignored them, gritting my teeth and steeling my nerves as they ran down my hoe and over my boots and vanished into the woods.

At the heart of the thicket were cobwebs.  They covered the thorns in dull fluff, blunting their tips.  And the vines themselves… were tattered.  Chewed apart, bit by bit.  I hooked the end of my hoe into this empty space the spiders had carved and I pulled and with a groan, the thicket simply fell apart.

The lady with extra eyes was a protector of the campground.  It was one of her natures.  It seems she’s carrying on her task even in her reborn form.

I cannot tell you how conflicted this makes me feel.  I grieve for what I did.  I’m hopeful for the future, for the possibility that I’ll see the lady again - or at least, another incarnation of her.  And I’m afraid that it’s nothing but a cycle, one that inevitably spins towards either my death or hers.

She’s been killed before.  I wonder if my ancestor was similarly conflicted and I wonder if someday, my niece or one of her descendents will have to make the same horrible choice I did.

Or perhaps the cycle will be broken when something ascends.  Perhaps - if it is something that treats my line kindly - it will have the power to save both of us.

I don’t think being preoccupied with these thoughts is the reason for what happened next.  There was no warning.  Certainly, I had a sense of unease, but that is simply the case for when I interact with these thorns.  They make my skin crawl.  They are unnatural things, poisoning the soil around them, and they *feel* malevolent.  Like they know I am there to destroy them.  But otherwise, there was no change in the air to warn me I was no longer alone.

“What are you doing, campground manager?” a voice directly at my back rumbled.

I dropped the hoe.  I think I squeaked in horror.  Then I spun around and found myself face-to-face with the fomorian.  It leaned over, putting its lone eye on the same level as mine.  All I could see was the darkness of its hood, the shadow engulfing us both, and the red eye glinting like a ruby.

“I’m… gardening,” I said as a panicked sweat broke out on my brow.  “Winter is the best time for it, you know.  No undergrowth to deal with.  You can just take stuff right out of the ground.”

“It looks like you are destroying my thorns.”

“Ohhhhhh welllll I thought these were just a poison ivy variant.  I’ve been hearing about them in the local gardening club, they said they were cropping up and I really can’t let them take root on my campground because I have enough people stumbling into normal poison ivy already even though we mark it with magenta spray paint - seriously, how do you miss that?  I guess they were too drunk to see straight, hahah.”

I think I was babbling a little bit because the longer I kept talking, the more I delayed whatever it was the fomorian intended to do with me.  This was a strategy that was bound to fail at some point, however, with the deleterious side-effect of exhausting the fomorian’s patience.

“Enough,” the fomorian finally snapped.

So that’s another thing to mark off my bucket list.  Annoying a fomorian.  I’m lucky I’m alive to even *have* a bucket list still.

It put a hand on my shoulder.  Its long fingers wrapped around my upper back.  One grazed my neck and my hair stood on end and I stiffened as cold fear wound its way down my spine.  This didn’t seem fair.  How did something so *big* sneak up on me?

“Uh, your horse kind of has dibs I think,” I whispered.

I wasn’t sure where the dapple-gray stallion was, but I was ready to claim *anything* to make it reconsider killing me outright.

“I am its master,” the fomorian said calmly.  “It will take whatever scraps I offer it.”

It paused.  The hand on my shoulder dipped and long fingers wrapped around my chest.  I inhaled sharply in terror and my heart raced painfully.  I felt frozen, helpless but to watch in mounting dread as it straightened, lifting me up off the ground and holding me level with its single glowing eye.

“I said I would kill you next we met,” the fomorian said.  “That I would break your bones and drink your blood.”

“Have you… reconsidered?”

“I have.  There are better fates for meddlesome humans.”

‘Better’ is an extremely relative term here.

In panic, I seized my knife and drew it.  I stabbed it straight down with both hands, driving it down to the hilt into the fomorian’s wrist.  Then I wrenched it free and stabbed him again and again, growing ever more panicked as the creature refused to react, as if I were merely an ant biting at its pallid flesh.

It opened its hand and dropped me.  I tried to land on my feet and for a few seconds, I did, but the impact was too hard, the ground too slick with snow, and I am not a gymnast.  My feet slipped out from under me and I landed hard on my back.  I was fumbling for the knife before it even registered that I hadn’t started breathing again yet.  Blind panic drove me on.  Just as my fingers closed on it, the ground around me lurched, as four fingers came crashing down *into* the frozen soil.  They formed a cage around me, the palm pressed low enough that I was just barely pinned to the ground by its pressure.  I stared up at the fomorian looming over me.

“Since the thorns concern you so,” it rumbled, “I will help you understand them better.  I will plant them in your flesh.  They will feed on you until there is nothing left to consume.”

I kicked, trying to squeeze myself out from under its grip.  But I could only watch in horror as it reached into its bag and pulled out a single seed.  It held this balanced for a moment on its finger.

Then it dropped the seed neatly between my collarbones.

There was a sharp pain, like a bee sting.  The fomorian released me from under its hand and I tore at my clothing, frantic, ripping open my jacket and pulling the hem of my shirt down, clawing at my stinging flesh.  Nothing.  There was nothing there.  No seed.  Just a thin cut, not even the size of my thumb.  The flesh was blackened at the edges.

I was close to hysteria.  All I could think of was those thorns choking the life out of the trees, spines growing through them like worms.  Now, it was inside my chest.  I’d seen someone die in a similar way before.  The thought of such a fate horrified me beyond measure and I dug at my own flesh until blood ran down to my stomach and finally - more than the pain - the cold realization that the seed had vanished somewhere beyond my reach was what made me stop.

When I looked up, the fomorian was gone.  I could only gather my tools and return to the house to clean up my chest and bandage the wound I’d made, trying to ignore the pain and the creeping sensation along my skin.  I wondered how long it would take.  I wondered if the shiver I felt along my spine was my imagination or if the thorns were spreading through my body already.  I took a couple shots of whiskey to steady myself and radioed for Bryan.

I’m really not sure what his relationship with the fairy is, but I’m starting to suspect there’s something going on there.  More so than I initially thought.  Anyway, I asked if he’d request the fairy to pay the house a visit.  I desperately needed help, I said, and it involved the fomorian.

The fairy showed up a few hours later.  The sun was still up, but the fairy seemed to glow with their own sunlight.  I couldn’t help but wonder what it was like to gaze upon Lugh, whom they had once followed into battle.  They stared at me from the back of their deer a moment, then languidly dismounted and walked closer.  I looked away under their intent scrutiny, keenly aware that I was just a dumb mortal who had gotten into more trouble than she could handle.

“I cannot cure this, if this is what you wish,” they finally said.

“Then who can?” I asked desperately, snapping my head up to meet their gaze.

They seemed… sad.  But also stern.

“Where is your protector?” they asked.

“My what?”

“The one seeking a name.”

Obviously by this point I knew they were referring to Beau.  I don’t necessarily think of him as my protector, as there’s been plenty of times he’s merely stood by and let something awful happen to me.  The bit about seeking a name though… Well, there’s only one thing on this campground doing that, as far as I’m aware.

But instead of answering the fairy’s question, I continued to play dumb.  Perhaps if I could get *them* to recognize Beau’s name, that would grant it a little more significance than what we collectively have already given it.

“Beau,” the fairy murmured.  “Since you insist I speak that name.”

Don’t say I never did anything for him.

I told them the truth.  I didn’t know where Beau was.  He wasn’t mine to control, after all, and he only came when he chose to.  I had no doubt that if he didn’t want to be summoned, he simply wouldn’t show.  Nor did I think he tailed my every movement through the forest.  Beau expected me to be able to take care of myself, to a degree.  Mutual respect and all.

“Do you mean to say he can fix this?” I asked.  “It’s not something I swallowed.”

“No.  But he is on good terms with the creatures you have taken to calling the harvesters and I think they would accept a request from him, should he ask that they cut it out of you.”

I thought of how my great-aunt died and I could not speak.  There was a touch against my cheek, like a moth’s wing, and it brought me back to myself.

“Poor thing,” the fairy said softly.  “You have time yet.  Seek another way, if you cannot bear the thought of such a remedy.”

Then their tone turned stern and unforgiving and they dropped their hand, stepping back a pace.

“And campground manager?” they added.  “Do not summon me again in such a way.”

“Why can’t I?” I demanded, somewhat wildly.  “*You’re* waging a *war* on *my* land.”

I was feeling a little spicy after my encounter with the fomorian.

“I am defending your land against a would-be conqueror that you led here.”

Being petty is a lot less fun when the other person refuses to engage.  The fairy said it so plainly, with all the interest of stating the sky was blue.  They didn’t even look at me while they did so, but I could not help but squirm with uncomfortable guilt.

“Besides,” the fairy continued.  “Doing so endangers Bryan.”

Ah.  That… made sense.  And I only felt more guilty for not thinking of this myself.  Normally I pride myself on how I protect my staff, but I admit that there have been lapses in the past.  This might have become one of them, had the fairy not intervened.  Bryan is accommodating and I think I take that for granted at times.

“Is there a way I *should* contact you?” I asked.

“No.  I will come if I am needed.”

The deer turned and walked away, leaving me standing there on the front porch of my house, my chest stinging with every breath, with the only cure available to me one that I fear with all of my being.

I’m a campground manager.  I… haven’t spoken to Beau yet.  I cancelled knife fighting with him so I could keep my distance, in case he noticed something was amiss.  Said I was worn out from ripping out thorns and he respected that, as I’ve already had to explain that sometimes humans need rest days.  I admit I’m feeling a little desperate right now.  My options are slim.  I’m going to try the dancers, though I fear they can only cure diseases or poisons.  If that fails…

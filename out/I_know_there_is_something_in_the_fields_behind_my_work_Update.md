I took Sunday night off. A part of me needed a day off to catch up on some sleep, but another part of me can’t fathom spending a 12 hour shift there after everything that has happened. 

I didn’t see anything the following day after the first post which would of been Wednesday night. 

Thursday night was different. 

I’m glad I had a few drivers waiting when I got in Thursday night, because I just had a bad feeling. 

I noticed walking into the office their was quite a few dead birds outside our building. Herons, crows, a few smaller birds. It looked like the just flew right into the side of our building with enough force to end their lives. 

I also noticed that the family of deer that lives in the field were roaming around, and eventually hunkered down in the small patch of grass we have in our yard. It was almost as if they were trying to get away from the field. 

My drivers that were waiting in the office said they didn’t do anything when they walked by either. The path to the trucks is literally right next to the patch of grass they were sleeping in, and it seemed as if they didn’t care when my drivers or even the large semi’s passed them. 

It put me on edge especially after my drivers left and I actually went and opened up the curtains that face the deer so I could see when my drivers would be pulling up. 

Everything was going fine for a better part of the night. Until I heard a crash into one of of the windows that faces the field. The blinds were still closed on that side, but I guess just like in a horror movie I got curious. I walked up to the window and pulled down one of the blinds. 

I could see on the ground was another dead crow. It wasn’t twitching or anything it just laid there dead. 

Then another crash. It made me jump and I backed away from the window. Another crash, and then another. 

The deer outside my open window started snorting and I could see as they all raised there head up and looked into the field. 

The crashing of birds continued while I stared at the deer. It wasn’t long before they stood up and soon they got startled by something in the direction of the field. 

They took off towards the front of the building but I knew it wouldn’t do any good cause our whole building is fenced in, with the exception of the back. There was no fence that stretched along the field. 

I went out my office door and into the lounge were my drivers sit and went up to the window where the deer were but I couldn’t see anything. 

Everything got really quiet then. 

I don’t know why but a part of me told me to go look out into the field so I walked up to the front doors. I still didn’t see anything and the grass stood as still as a board. No movement. 

Then something flew out of the grass a few hundred yards away. I couldn’t tell what it was, but it seemed rather large and it soon disappeared into the dark of the night. 

It wasn’t long before it reappeared and was heading straight for our office door. I didn’t have time to react as it crashed into out office door with a loud crash, the glass cracking as it did so. 

I was to stunned to even scream as I looked down and saw the body of a mangled baby deer. It’s body was covered in claw marks and bites. 

Something just threw a fucking baby deer from a few hundred yards away. What the fuck could do that?

I was completely freaked out, and went to go grab my phone. I was going to call the police but stopped when I heard the door unlock. It’s the sound it always makes when someone used there badge to get into the office and one of my drivers walked in. 

“What happened to the door?”he said as he walked in and set all his stuff on the table. 

I couldn’t find words to say as I stared at him and I must have been ghost white cause he then proceeded to ask me if I was ok. 

I leaned over my desk and looked out the front door and the deer was gone. 

“You didn’t see it?” I asked him. 

“See what?” He replied looking a bit confused. 

“The baby deer out front?” I almost screamed it at him I was so scared. 

My driver then walked over to the front door and looked out it looking left to right. 

“I don’t see anything” he stated before he turned back to me. 

To say I freaked out was an understatement. 

“No, no.. there was a deer there. It crashed into the door!” 

“A deer ran into the door? Wow he must’ve hit pretty hard to crack it like that, but I guess he just walked it off” the driver chuckled as he grabbed his paperwork off the counter. 

I knew for a fact that baby deer did not walk it off, it was dead. 

I started crying. I didn’t have any other reaction then to lean against the wall and start crying. 

“Woah, Woah, it’s ok. I’m sure he’ll be fine, probably just a bit dazed” My driver said as he knelt down next to me. 

“No it was dead Michael! I saw it with my own eyes it was dead, just like all the birds!” 

“Birds?” 

“Yes all the birds the flew into the window!” I yelled at him. 

“Ok, ok.. am I your last driver tonight?” 

All I could do was nod my head yes as I stared at the chair that was in front of me. 

“Ok how about you go home early? I’ll call the boss and let him know your a bit upset and scared cause a deer ran into the door”

I don’t know why but I just knew it in my heart if I went out the door right now I wouldn’t make it home.

“No I’m ok, I’ll just finish the night. 

“You sure?”

“Yeah.. thanks, drive safe tonight and let me know if you have any issues”

My driver looked at me with concern. He knew I was full of shit and that I was in fact not ok, but he just sighed and nodded his head. 

“Ok, we’ll you can call me as well if you need to” I gave him a small smile and nodded in return as I watched him walk out the front door. 

I was alone for the rest of the night and the sun rose a couple hours later. I ended up sending my boss an email about the door, and tried to call him but he never answers. 

The light did little to ease the unsettling feeling the field gave me. When I finally stepped outside I could see a few drops of blood on the ground that had since dried and turned a dark brown blending in with the concrete. 

I looked down the building and the birds were gone. 

I wasn’t sure what to think so I just went home. I knew it wasn’t good for the baby to be stressed so when my boss called me back and offered me the day off I took it. 

I know it must sound insane but I know what I saw, I’m not crazy. I know there is something in the fields behind my work.

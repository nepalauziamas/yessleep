*He sees me, but I didn’t see him…not yet.*

*It was just like every other night that summer. I was a little girl again, no older than eight, and back in my old house, back in my old childhood bedroom. The monsoon raged on outside, hurling millions of tiny raindrops onto my window. I remember I liked to watch them race down the pane of glass, curious to see which one would reach the bottom first, and I was doing just that that night when* it *happened.*

*I felt the cold, firm press of the mattress against my back and the cool weight of the blanket atop me. My tired eyes watched the raindrops on the window race down it, but anytime I would start to close my eyes, lightning would blind me back awake. I’ve always hated having that window with no blinds or curtains right there next to my bed.*

*Anyhow, I remember letting the laser-red numbers on the alarm clock burn into my retinas: 12am. Thunder boomed from outside, rattling the windowpane and threatening its craftsmanship. I shut my eyes, trying to focus on my breathing; an old trick my mom had taught me to before she passed, and to her credit, not only did it help to put me to sleep, but I’d never forgotten I either.*

*It was the slightest, most ignorable, most forgettable, most nonchalant tap on the other side of the glass that forced my eyes open. Right there…right fucking there was…him.*

*I don’t fully know what he was, but all I remember is two massive, floppy ears, too big for his head. His skin was a rotted chestnut brown, leathery and wrinkled, and his snout was unnaturally long. Stringy whiskers protruded out from it at all the wrong, jagged angles. A long, thin, earthworm-like tail whipped around behind him playfully; tauntingly. Perhaps that’s what caused me to nickname him, ‘The Rat’.*

*His smile was all too wide, and not even all his broken, daggered teeth could fill it completely. And then…there were his eyes; small and glowing. They didn’t look like the eyes that belonged to a monster of that size, but rather just an everyday human like you and me. Only thing, was that they were unblinking and dull, like whoever they belonged too originally was dead for years, and the individual who once saw behind them was utterly stripped away.*

*As soon as the lightning from the storm revealed him though, he was gone in a flash. Gone from the window I mean, not from hunting me. I heard something fall over in my toy closet, and a moment later, the brass knob twisted. The hinges let out a painful squeak as the door opened at an agonizingly slow pace. The bastard wanted to let the fear alone brew around in my head before he’d even get to me.*

*I tried not to look—I really did—but I couldn’t* not *look at him. I’ve no idea how, but The Rat was there. Another thunder strike, and the room lit up again, but his peeking face was already gone.*

*Sweat ran down my forehead and dripped down, onto the pillow. I wasn’t tired anymore. I reached for my nightlight, but it wouldn’t turn on no matter how many times I pushed the button. Three more flashes of lightning. Each one lit up the room, and I screamed at just the thought alone of seeing him looming towards the ceiling, or crouched at the foot of my bed, only seeing his flimsy ears peeking up over the wooden banister. But nothing.*

*And then, on the fifth lighting strike, with thunder so loud that it deafened me, I felt the bed shift ever so slightly. The old wood frame squeaked under pressure and then the room went silent. I knew where The Rat had gone.*

**5 Days Until the Weekend**

“Holy shit!” Max looked at me with bewildered eyes. “I’ve had nightmares, but this…this is somethin’ else, Hannah.”

“Sleep paralysis?” I mumbled from inside my hands, still not wanting to reveal that I’d been secretly crying from my recounting of last night’s nightmare.

“I don’t mean to scare you anymore, but I think it was. Could you move during it?” Mark furrowed his brow. “If it was sleep paralysis, then you couldn’t have moved.”

“But I was able to move!” I looked up at him, then immediately went to wipe the tears off my cheeks. “Y-You don’t suppose it was real?” I didn’t mean to, but my eyes locked with Max’s.

“Real fake.” He cracked a smile. “Don’t listen to Mark. He’s just trying to scare you.”

From across the table, Mark made some retort, but it was obscured by him taking a bite of his sandwich.

“In fact, Mark once convinced me that that ol’ bistro downtown was haunted by their mascot who was a pickle farmer; what was his name? Senior Pickle? A God damn escabeche!” He laughed, throwing up his hands. “Hannah, trust me, Mark is a little…*special* sometimes...”

“Oh, and you aren’t?” Mark raised an eyebrow.

“Which—if you’ll let me finish—is why we love him.” Max winked.

“Good save.” I gave an uncertain smile to both my friends. “I just hope that it was a one and done kinda thing, y’know?”

“I’m sure it was.” Max returned my smile, a bit stronger. “Besides, if you need, feel free to give me a call just to chat. Lord knows I don’t sleep anyhow. Insomnia and all that.”

I nodded, picking the last pepperoni off my slice of pizza and popping it into my mouth.

“Can you believe these clowns in student council? They run the cafeteria like a circus!” A cheery voice cooed from behind me. “Pretty sure they gave me too much change.”

“Roxy!” I spun around.

“Nice of you to finally join us.” Max chuckled before crunching on a pretzel.

“It’s not my fault the lines are so long.” She pushed Mark aside before sitting down her lunch tray and taking a seat beside me. She handed me bottle of water. “Sorry, I go two again. Want it?”

I nodded, licking my lips from the hot sun that glared down at us from up in the sky as we sat below on the soccer field, eating our requisite lunch. I twisted off the cap and downed half the bottle. It was refreshing, if not a bit sour tasting.

“So, how was everyone’s morning?” Roxy chirped.

Mark groaned. “Mrs. Wallenbee’s Chemistry Class. Need I say more?” He gave a chuckle that no one returned.

“Wait, I thought you liked that class.” Max threw his hands up in the air.

“Wallenbee? Chemistry? No way man!”

“Sorry, let me rephrase that: I thought you liked *the girl* in that class who sits across from you. What’s her name? Charlotte?”

Mark’s face flushed a bright vermillion.

“What about you, Hannah? How was your morning?” Roxy twirled a finger around her black, curly hair. I’d never noticed it before, but the four of us were total stereotypes. Roxy Hart was the emo gothic tomboy, always dressed in black and wearing various metal trinkets and accessories. Today in particular sporting a leather jacket, jeans, and a nose ring than I fought to not shutter at the feeling of.

Mark Soloman was the hot new kid from Australia, always looking to impress girls with his wavy blonde hair and perfect body tan. He never seemed to not be wearing his infamous white tank top, even in the colder months.

And Max Donovan, among being my best friend, was the secluded, well dressed and educated kid, never speaking except for when he had either sarcasm or wisdom to dispense, and often, it was both at once.

And there was I, the glue of the group. I…well I was just that. The awkward girl with night terrors created from some half-buried past trauma, that no one cared about, mostly because it wasn’t their problem. And though it hurt to keep it locked up inside, I buried it over the years to the point where I could no longer remember it with a smile on my face and the lasting memory of my mother telling me that I should always be happy and positive, and nothing else.

Yet through it all, we’d all found each other decent enough to call one another our friends.

“Well geometry is geometry.” I said. “Nothing special there. Still don’t understand it.” Max raised an eyebrow, but continued staring at his tray. “But Max’s explanations do help.”

Roxy made a noise that signified that she was satisfied while taking a long sip of milk. That’s when the conversation died. Roxy’s bubbly personality that didn’t at all reflect her outfit had run out and Max and Mark continued eating.

I couldn’t tell why, but I just needed to keep the conversation going. I needed to keep my mind away from wandering back to the nightmare.

“So anyone got any exciting things happin’ this weekend?” I blurted out.

Mark raised both his eyebrows. “Actually for once, yes! My dad just ought some big lodge up in the mountains. Been run down for a couple years now. Guess he got a decent deal on it because something spooked the old landlord enough to want to sell it. We’re suppose to go up there and check it out.”

“Speaking of which,” Roxy cut of Mark before he was done speaking, “my mom reserved us two nights down at the Marriot in Dover for my birthday. They’re suppose to have won an award for being the best vacation spot in all of Cali last year! I can’t wait to destress. This school year already has me worn out!”

I nodded at both of them, happy that they had events to attend to in their lives, but knowing deep down that I’d just be spending my weekend in my room, locked away while my dad emptied beer after beer in the living room.

“What about you, Max?” I turned to face him. “Got any plans?”

He looked up from his tray, as if caught off-guard by my question. “N-No, not really. Just more of the usual.”

“Are you still writing that novel?” Mark said.

Max took a moment before responding. At the beginning of the school year, he’d emailed everyone he knew a document that he’d typed on every day of the previous summer, demanding review, and critiques. No one cared to even bother with reading it, and instead just opted to tell him it was good and that there had been a few grammatical errors.

“I don’t really write anymore.” Max said at last. “Haven’t found the inspiration. Thought I’d focus more on school for a while.”

Mark nodded, and just like that, the bell rang, ending the lunch period.

\*\*\*

When I opened the door, I found the same familiar sight that always was before me at my house. My dad had hitched this drinking problem ever since my mom had passed, and was now like every other day slumped in the old lazy boy, knocked out with a half empty bottle and three more empty ones laying haphazardly around him.

I dropped my backpack by the door, kicked off my worn sneakers, and sulked down the hallway to my room. The sun was already beginning to set, and by the time I had eaten a microwaved dinner, raced through my homework, taken a shower, and crawled into bed, a heavy rain had began falling from the inky black sky and drowning the outside of my window.

For a moment I lay in bed, my eyes searching all four corners of my room while it was still illuminated by my bedside lamp. I could already tell the room was empty, but I supposed it was more for peace of mind.

I went to reach to turn of the lamp, but my finger grazed across my phone instead.

**Hey Max…**

**Hey, still up I see?**

**It’s only 10.**

**Late for you, isn’t it? Lol**

**Shut up. You said I could text you any time tonight.** My fingers worked quickly and sloppily, beating against my phone screen, and making it slick with my sweat.

**I recall that. So what’s up?**

**Just nervous.** I whipped sweat from my forehead that dampened my hair and pillow. I slouched my back against the wall my bed was pressed up against and swallowed hard.

**About what?**

**Having another nightmare. Its just so unlike me to have something like that last night. I’m just scared it will happen again.**

**It won’t. And if it does, you can just call or text me to help bring you back to reality. Nothing like hearing my tired ass voice. Lol**

**Yeah…lol. Raining by you?**

A moment passed and a pictured showed up of a window flooded with raindrops\*\*. Isn’t it obvious?\*\*

I smiled to myself. It was such a Max thing to do. Maybe I’d play his game with him. I went to open my camera on my phone, aimed it at my window, and noticed that the picture displayed on the screen was blurred. I took another, and the another, but all the pictures came out blurred.

I turned the phone around to inspect the lens, and found a single drop of water covering the camera. *Must be from my hair from the shower*. I rubbed it against the corner of my pajama shirt, and when I pulled away, the drop formed into a long, gooey string before finally whipping off the lens. *That’s strange.* But I didn’t give it another thought. I took the picture and sent it to Max.

Damn, thought I was special. He joked, and thunder boomed from outside my window. I knew that he was trying to be funny to help get me to relax, and in a strange way, it did.

**Welp, G’night. Don’t stay up** ***all*** **night.**

**Just took some sleeping pills, like they’ll actually help though.**

I placed my phone back on the nightstand and flicked off the light. As soon as darkness enveloped the room, I pulled my arm back under the sheets like I’d been shocked. With the blankets up to neck, I smiled to myself, finding myself lucky to have a friend like Max. I really thought that I…I…eye. My eye was wet. *Had I been crying?* I rubbed my left eye with my fist and blinked until my eye was unblurred by the tear in it. I remembered something Roxy had told me about how starring at a screen can make your eyes water, but I pushed the thought aside.

With a clouded mind ready for sleep, I turned over and let out a slow, deep breath.

\*\*\*

I awoke, shaking like a leaf in the wind. My face was completely drenched in sweat, my hair sticking to my sponge-like pillowcase that seemed to be absorbing all the perspiration. My room was silent and dark, with the thunderstorm still raging outside. Lighting flashed through the window and lit up the room, allowing me to briefly see my bedroom. *All clear and completely empty, just the way it should be.* My eyes flicked over to the alarm clock, glowing red. *12 am.*

I rolled over on my back, and let go of a slow, relaxed breath, knowing that I was safe. Still, I figured that I’d text Max, just to see if he was still up.

**Hey, you up? Just woke up and I’m like drowning in a puddle of my own sweat. Lol.**

The three dots appeared on the screen signifying he was typing, and after a minute, two works appeared on my screen. Two God damn words written in all caps. **LOOK UP.**

I dropped my phone onto my chest that began beating at a rapid pace. I forced my eyes to my ceiling, but before they could see anything, a stringy, gooey drop of water hit my eye. I raced to rub it out with the sheets acting as a towel, but I noticed just how soaked they were too. In fact, my entire pillow, sheets, head, everything was drenched in a slimy water.

Then my vision cleared, and I looked to the ceiling of my bedroom. Clinging to it by its jagged claws and outstretched limbs like a massive spider was him, mouth gapping open and a long serpent-like tongue hanging out, inches away from my forehead. All the while, a mess of drool and saliva melted down onto me, encasing my face in its thick slime. Some of it poured into my eyes, burring them, and some dripped right down into my own mouth, open, but because of all of the drool that pooled in it, damped my scream, and I choked out the last of the air in my lungs.

**4 Days Until the Weekend**

“Hannah...” I avoided eye contact as Max spoke to me, “you only texted me once last night…around ten. I never said to ‘look up’.”

“I figured.” I whispered, not wanting him to hear the crying in my voice as I again hid my eyes with my hands. “But it happened again. Don’t you get it? I had another night terror.”

“Sounds like it!” Mark chuckled as he reached for his milk.

“Knock it off, okay?” Max demanded.

“What?”

“Hannah is actually experiencing serious nightmares. It’s not a laughing matter.”

“So? Can’t you just, make them go away?” Mark squinted at me. “Maybe she just wants attention.”

I pretended like I didn’t hear the last part.

Max shook his head in annoyance. “Hannah, it’s okay. I’m sure it’s just stress build up. Do you have an exam coming up or something like that?”

“N-No.” My voice exited my lips weaker than I would have liked.

“Well there’s no reason to worry. It’ll pass soon enough. It may happen for a few more nights, but I’m sure it’ll be gone soon. In fact, I promise it will be.”

I managed a smile. “I hope so.”

“Another day, another free dollar!” Roxy dropped her tray on the grass field and then crossed her legs as she took a seat. “Seems like they’ll never make any money if they keep giving me all this extra change!” She smiled brightly. “But I can’t complain. Beautiful day, and seems like the seniors are coming for our spot on the field.” She turned to look at all the groups of upperclassmen who were partaking in eating they’re on lunches outside around the field.

“Hey Roxy.” I smiled.

“Hey, look what I got!” She held up another water bottle like it was some holy object. “Got you another one.”

I laughed. “You know, you don’t need to keep buying me water every day. That’s why there’s a *water fountain*. I can drink from that for free.”

“Oh, but it tastes funny.”

“I think it tastes like pennies.” Mark interrupted. “Or copper…one of the two.”

“Aren’t those both the same thing?” Max asked.

“Well anyways, it’s a two for one deal.” Roxy tossed the bottle at me, and without a second to spare I rehydrated myself.

“Is it?” Max raised an eyebrow. “I didn’t get a second one when I went last week when I forgot my water bottle at home.”

“Can you just stop making this such a big deal?” Roxy said a bit too aggressively. “Anyways, how’s everyone’s day?”

“Can’t complain.” Mark shrugged. “Wallenbee is still—”

“What about you Max?”

He seemed caught of guard as he swapped which eyebrow was raised in a confused manner. “Fine…I guess.”

“Great! Got any plans for this weekend?” She seemed to only lean into him, ignoring both me and Mark.

“Same as I said yesterday, nope.” He shot me a confuse glance. I shrugged in return. Roxy did seem a bit hyper today, and perhaps we’d find out why soon enough.

“Well like I said, my mom reserved us two nights down at the Marriot. I just can’t wait to go! It’s so beautiful, but I think it’s more of a couple’s thingy though. Still it should be fun for me and my mom if she can still come.”

“What? Why wouldn’t she?”

“She’s…” Roxy bit her lip, straining for words, “might have to stay overnight with a few patients at the hospital. I told you she’s a nurse, right?”

Mark nodded. “Well, the hospital is low on staff, so they might book her for a few night shifts. She loves that job to hell so…”

“Well I’m sorry to hear that.” I mumbled.

“Well, it’s what it is. I’ll still go though. Even if just by myself, but maybe I’ll bring a friend or something.” She smiled, and went to take a bite of her pizza.

The conversation died after that, but I felt no obligation to keep it going this time. I rubbed sleep from my eyes as I realized how tired I must look.

The bell that ended lunch seemed to come faster, and when it did, I threw away my tray of half-eaten food. I turned to leave for my next class when Max grabbed me by the arm. He didn’t say anything, but rather nodded his head in a low-key manner, signifying that we needed to wait.

I watched with Max as Mark and Roxy waved goodbye and hurried off to their next classes. Finally, one they were out of sight, Max turned back to face me. “Hannah, are you sure you’ll be alright?”

I nodded hastily, unsure what he was getting at.

“Alright, just making sure. I’m worried about you.”

I pushed him off. “It’s fine bro. I can take care of a few night terrors.”

“Bro?” He laughed. “Well alright. Guess it’s just they way you retell them to me. That’s all it is. You’re a great storyteller.” He smiled. “Anyhow, if it helps, take two of these tonight before you go to bed.” He handed me a bottle of tiny purple pills. “Should help you get to sleep.”

“What? Why don’t you take these?”

“I do.” He rolled his eyes. “But I think my body is too use to them for them to be effective anymore, but maybe not for you. Hopefully they help you get to sleep and stay sleeping.”

“Wait.” I tried not to smirk. “Why’d you randomly have these with you? Do you just carry them around incase your friends have night terrors?”

He laughed. “N-No, I just carry them with me when I want to help my *best* friend with her night terrors. That’s all.” He smiled, then turned and ran down the hall, already late for his class, which for someone as organized as he was, was rather unusual.

\*\*\*

Four…four empty bottle this time, and a half empty fifth beer in his hand. I shook my head, sloughing off my sneakers and hoodie. The afternoon progressed like all the others. I heated myself up a sad microwavable dinner, did my homework for each subject, prayed to whatever gods I still believed in that I’d get a decent enough grade on them, and went to take my shower.

I usually preferred my showers on the colder side, but I took this one especially hot. I wanted to relax, and let Max’s works fill my thoughts. Tonight, this would all ends. I’d take some sleeping pills, conk out, out be refreshed for tomorrow, ready to thank Max for his help.

I closed my eyes, letting the hot, scalding water run through my hair and down my body. *There was nothing to worry about anymore. I was safe.*

I flicked my eyes open at the sound of the shower curtain rustling. “Dad?” I said, a bit on edge but also a bit weirded out that he was awake. Usually after three he was out cold for the night. There was no reply. Maybe it was our cat, Oliver? But no, that wouldn’t make sense, the bathroom door was closed. How would he get in?

And then…a shape appeared on the other side of the curtain. A massive, dark shadow that resembled a rodent, standing on two legs with a gapping mouth and two, large, floppy ears.

I gasped, unable to scream. My back pressed up against the wall of the shower, and I looked down at my hands. They were…red. No, not just my hands…my arms too. I touched my forehead…more red. Was I…bleeding?

The water in the shower gradually shifted from a light pink color into a darker crimson, and I looked up in horror to find the shower head spewing out blood. I choked out the urge to scream, and fell out of the shower, tangling myself in the curtain. I scrambled to my feet, finding myself leaning on the sink, staring back at myself in the mirror.

“It’s okay.” I said aloud to my reflection. “I’m okay. I’m safe. I’m going to b…be…b…” My throat tightened before I could get out the words. I tried to breath, to get any single molecule of air into my lungs but I couldn’t. All I could feel was massive lump moving up my throat. I coughed…I gagged…I choked. I stared into the mirror and to my pure horror, I saw the lump emerge in the back of my throat just behind my uvula.

The hair of the lump was wet with my saliva and sharp nails dug into my gums. Then, with one more gage, the lump hurled out of my mouth and into the sink before me, and it quickly squirmed to its feet. A large, gray rat squeezed down the drain, and before I could even process it, my eyes looked back in the mirror and I saw The Rat starring back at me, a massive smile on his face that revealed all his teeth, with pure joy in whites of his human eyes.

\*\*\*

**3 Days Until the Weekend**

“I know it was all a dream. I remember taking your sleeping pills, then laying down, but the next thing I knew, I was back in my shower…and you know the rest.” I regarded Max with red rimmed eyes.

He looked at me sorrowfully, as if he was out of ideas on how to help, but didn’t want to lose hope…not yet. “Hannah—” He started.

“Max, I don’t know how much more I can take.” I buried my crying into my arms. “They keep getting worse. Every night it gets worser and worser.”

He smiled sadly. “Then we know that there’s and end. Like I said, I still think it’s gonna happen for a few more nights, and you’ll probably have a climax at some point, A.K.A. a really fucking awful dream.” It was unlike Max to swear. “But after that, it’ll all go away, I promise.”

“But what if it doesn’t Max? What the fuck do I do if it doesn’t?”

“We’ll get you therapy, or medication…something. Hannah, you can beat this.”

I didn’t try to hide my tears anymore. “And what if I can’t get help? My Mom’s dead, my dad’s practically there, and my brother’s God knows where!”

“And why does that matter?” Max said a bit louder than I think he intended. “You’re the only one who can beat this, Hannah.”

Mark, who’d been sitting in silence to this point furrowed his eyebrows. “Maybe you are just stressed. You could try taking a day off school.” He suggested. “Or, maybe if her mom can’t go, ask Roxy if you could go with her to the Marriot. Nothin’ like a foot message and a lazy river to get you back to dreamland.”

I cracked a smile. “Maybe.”

“They actually got it right!” Roxy plopped down in her usual spot. “No extra change!” She stuffed a dollar bill with some coins into her hoodie pocket. “For Madam Hannah.” Roxy presented the water bottle in front of me in a comedic way, trying not to giggle.

“Roxy, I told you—”

“And I told you, don’t worry bout’ it.” She smiled.

“But—”

“Max,” she interrupted, “How’s it going?”

He rolled his eyes at me before turning to answer her. “Same as always.”

“Got any plans for this weekend?”

“Like I said yesterday, nope.” He stared at her with annoyed eyes. “You?” He mumbled the reply.

“Well as you know, my mom reserved a two night stay at the Marriot. Sadly, looks like my mom isn’t gonna be able to make it.”

“Oh.” Mark raised his eyebrows. Well we were thinking that you could take Hannah.”

I averted eye contact, instead opting to focus on the small stream of bubbles in my water bottle that seemed to rise from the bottom. A few seconds later, they disappeared, and I took a refreshing drink.

“Take Hannah, why?”

It was true, Roxy had never been around when I told the boys about my night terrors. She didn’t know that I needed an escape.

“I was actually going to ask you, Max, if you wanted to come.”

Max looked at her with wide eyes, certainly surprised. “W-Why me?” He stammered out.

“Why not? You always work so hard and are always super tired right? Why not take a break.”

Max shifted uncomfortably. “I think Hannah—”

“It’s okay Max.” I said quicker than I could know the words coming out of my mouth, “You should go. It’d be fun.” I gave him a fake smile, and he returned a frown.

Roxy nodded. “*Really* fun.” Roxy licked her lips, slowly, and purposefully while not breaking eye contact with Max.

He shrugged. “I think I might be busy.”

Roxy frowned; a pouty curve between her lips.

“I’m preparing for the Literature Club’s entry for the festival. There’s a lot of decorations to make this weekend.” I blurted out, trying to fill the awkward, uncomfortable tension. It was an obvious lie to both the boys, but I used it as a way to help Max, and luckily he picked up on it.

“And I’m gonna be busy helping.” Max demanded. “Meet at your house on Saturday?” He smiled brightly at me.

“Sure.” I smiled back. “We can—”

“Would you just shut up and drink your water?” Roxy shot me an angry glance, and I did what she demanded, mostly out of shock. “But you’re not even in that club, Maxy.” She continued.

He stood up as if he’d been stung by a bee. “What did you just call me?”

Roxy suddenly smiled, as if she’d let some secret only she knew slip intentionally. “Just trying to gross you out.” She wrinkled her nose. “You’re cute when you—”

“I think I’m done with lunch today.” He brushed off his pants and straightened is jacket. “Imma go get set up for Art.” He leaned down as he passed me. “Call me tonight.” And with that, he hurried off.

“Max Donovan, everybody!” Mark started clapping, then whipped the sweat from his forehead. “God damn it’s hot out here. Mind if I have a drink?”

“Not at all.” I handed him my water, but Roxy slapped it out of my hand and what remained in it spilled onto the grass.

“Don’t you know your manners?” She yelled. “If you want water, go get it from the drinking fountain.” She stood up, clearly angry and stopped off.

“Ugh, what was that about?” Mark looked at me.

“I dunno.” I began collecting my things. “She’s been weird lately.”

“Probably girl problems.” Mark snorted.

I laughed. “Seriously Mark? You’re so dumb.” I gave him a fake punch to the shoulder.

“Maybe, but at least I don’t try to seduce my friend.”

“What?” I stared blankly at him.

“Oh common, didn’t you see how she was looking at Max? She even called him a cute nickname! I thought it was obvious.”

I twisted uncomfortably, “Hmh. I doubt it. She just wants someone to buy her dinner at the Marriot.” I laughed.

\*\*\*

“Hannah.” I heard my name slurred from the lazy boy as I dropped my backpack on the floor behind the couch.

“Hi, Dad.” I mumbled.

“So…how was…” The words died on his lips.

“School?” I finished. “Fine.” I slumped down the hallway to my room. Dinner consisted of the same microwaved shit that it always was. I only got halfway through my homework before I awoke around ten to find myself still at my desk, head in a big pool of drool. I cursed under my breath and closed the textbook.

Skipping the shower, I brushed my teeth and ingested this time four of Max’s sleeping pills. I checked my room from top to bottom, making sure it was certainly clear, though I still knew whatever terrors tonight would only be in the form of all to realistic dreams.

My head it the pillow with a thump and fighting to even stay awake, I put my phone up to my ear.

“Max?”

“Hey.” His tired voice returned. “Still up I see.”

I gave a tired laugh. “Yes, and so are you, y’know.”

He made a noise that signified that he agreed. “Sadly. Someone took all my sleeping pills.”

“Hey, you said I could keep them as long as I needed.”

“And you can.” He laughed. “Just trying to be funny. Sorry, I’m still just a bit weirded out from Roxy.”

“Wasn’t that weird?” I agreed.

“Definitely. Somethings for sure up with her, but I’m not going to any resort and leaving you still…y’know.”

“Awww…” I cooed. “Thanks. You’re so sweet.”

“Oh shut up.” I could imagine him rolling his eyes. “So, are gonna be okay tonight?”

“I hope so.” My voice lowered to a more serious tone. “I really hope so.”

“Welp, feel free to call anytime.”

“Thanks,” I said, not quite ready to end the call, but thought it best to anyway, “good night.”

“Night.”

I set the phone down on my nightstand. Thunder boomed from outside and sweat began to collect on my forehead.

Eventually my eyes began to feel heavy, and my breath slowed. There wasn’t anything happening tonight. The pills had worked, and for once, I was ready to get a good night sl—urgh.

My stomach gurgled to life, as if I was about to vomit. Had the frozen dinner I had been expired? I remember Mark telling me once that he got used to eating frozen dinners and they had an effect on him.

A pain like a bullet passed through my stomach and I let out a cry of pain. I managed to get the blankets off me with one hand and flicked on the light with the other. I couldn’t believe my eyes.

I still lay in my bed, but my belly had inflated in size as if a soccer ball was inside it. The skin was red, and puss was leaking out of my belly button. Pain ruptured from deep inside and a wave of pain coarse through my entire body. I felt a punch on the inside of my belly. Then…another…and another push, as if something that as inside was ready to burst out. The skin crawled like bubbling plastic and lumps began moving up and down my whole body.

I couldn’t look away. The pain, the sight, all of it. Still, my hand reached for my phone. “M-Max?” I struggled out.

“Hannah.” It was his voice, but I knew it wasn’t really him. “What’s wrong with you? Why won’t you just fucking die already? Do you hear me? Die! No one wants you. Not even your drunk dad or your dead mother!”

“Max!”

All at once my stomach burst open, leaving nothing but a giant, gaping, bloody whole. Intestines and gut sprayed all over the sheets and walls. And from the void in my lower half scurried out hundreds of rats, their hair wet and covered in crimson blood. They fell onto the floors and ran up the walls all while I screamed, each one of them fighting another to get a bite out of me and my end trails that covered the room.

I fought to scream, and in my last breath, I pressed the phone up to my mouth quickly filling with blood. “M-Max…I love you.”

**2 Days until the Weekend**

“Fuck this, Hannah, we need to get you some help.” Max stood up. “This is clearly not normal for someone to be dreaming about giving birth to a hoard of rats that then eat you alive.”

I wish I could have agreed. I wish I could have cried. But I did nothing. I sat, not taking my eyes off the grass.

“Did you hear me? Hannah?”

I was drained, completely and utterly. Nothing mattered anymore. I hadn’t slept in days and the tiredness was beginning to take a toll on me.

“Hannah?” Mark sat quietly, watching Max panic for no good reason. “Hannah, common, we’re going to get you help right now.”

I didn’t move.

“Here, maybe some water would help.” Roxy chirpily tried to hand me a bottle, but I let it fall to the ground in front of me, not even attempting to receive it.

“Enough with the water already!” Max glared at Roxy.

“Maxy, what’s up with you today?”

He shook his head in disbelief. “Mark, can you help me get Hannah to the nurse’s office?”

“Oh, she’s fine.” Roxy protested.

Max continued on in protest but whatever he said I didn’t hear. My vision became blurry, and my head felt heavy. One moment I was sitting up on the grass, the next, laying down limp in it, my head spinning.

“Shit. Mark, common!” I heard their footsteps pace away, but dirt crunched right next to my ear. Through glazed eyes I saw Roxy.

“You really think you can take Max from me? You’re really funny, y’know that?” She smiled wide. “It’s just a matter of time now. How much longer will it be till you can’t take it anymore? Pretty bad headache, I know. Feel free to relieve yourself whenever you want. Don’t keep the devil waiting.”

“W-What?”

“Shut up!” She held the water bottle to my lips, “Now drink.”

\*\*\*

I awoke in my bed, sheets pulled tight over me and a ragging thunderstorm outside. Everything was as it should have been, no blood covered walls or rats crawling around in the shadows. The blankets atop me felt heavy and soft, and the firm mattress carried my back. I sat up, and immediately noticed something laying across my lap. I sat up and noticed a rather large tray across my lap.

A loud knock came from my bedroom door, and the door cracked open just enough to see him. It was the Rat, and in his two hands was a massive platter covered by a dome of stainless steel. He pushed the door all the way open with a sickeningly long creak, revealing that a dirty, rotting chef’s hat was perched between his ears. It sounds stupid, and I don’t expect anyone to believe me, but at that moment I was terrified.

He carried the platter over to where I lay, took a moment to loom over me, not looking anywhere else other than directly into my eyes. I couldn’t close them. All I could do was watch. After that eternity passed, he set down the platter and laid out on either side of it an almost comical sized fork and steak knife. If I had control, I wouldn’t have, but in that moment, I felt nothing more compelling than to reveal what was under the cover. The Rat still standing over me, watching intently.

I reached out a shaky hand, wanting nothing more than for him to just leave. I pulled off the cover in one moment, and the next, lightning flashed, lighting up the room, and I was able to make out the decapitated head of Max staring back at me.

I couldn’t. I didn’t want to. Then why were my hands picking up the silverware? I cannot justify it. I cannot explain it. But all I can say, is that the worst part of it all, was that it actually tasted good.

**1 Day Until the Weekend**

“Hannah.” I think Max realized that no will to live remained in me. I was no longer a person, but rather just a hollow shell.

“Hannah?” Mark repeated Max’s words, but got the same, silent response.

I stared blankly at them both, not moving or saying anything.

Max pointed behind me. “She’s coming.”

Mark nodded.

“Hey guys!” Roxy chirped as she sat down next to Max, taking a new spot on the field from her usual.

“Hey Roxy.” Both Max and Mark returned in unison.

The group was silent for a moment, and I wondered if I should say something, but I didn’t. I couldn’t. I was too weak.

“Here you go Hannah.” Roxy set down a water bottle in front of me. “Make sure you drink it today. It’ll help with your headache. I’m sure of it.”

Max side-glanced Mark, and he nodded.

“Roxy.” Max stood up. “Look, I’m…really sorry for how I acted yesterday.”

“Oh.” Roxy stood up and Max pulled her into a hug. “Me too.”

“It’s okay. I think we’re all just a bit tired recently. Your moms working late, I have an exam coming up, I think we’re all just a bit on edge. So anyways, I’m sorry for my outburst.”

“It’s alright Maxy Poo.”

Max tightened his hug. “Awww, you know I love it when you call me that.”

Roxy giggled, “And you know I love it when you make me thirsty for you.”

Max locked eyes with her, and squeezed her to his chest. He lowered his head down next to her ear and whispered, “Then maybe I should quench your thirst.”

I watched as Mark slid something into Max’s hand, and the next moment, Roxy was forced to the ground with Max on top of her.

“Wha-Max?” Roxy’s smile disappeared. “What are you doing?”

“Giving you a taste of your own medicine. I’d say ‘sleep well’ but I don’t think that’ll be happening.” And with that, Max shoved a handful of sleeping pills into Roxy’s mouth and pressed a bottle of water—my bottle of water--to her lips. “Drink.”

\*\*\*

The next day, Roxanne Hart was found dead in her bedroom. The morning news report had described her suicide as ‘too graphic and disturbing’ to reveal to the public. What they did mention however was that they found large amounts of Epinephrine and Norepinephrine, both of which are known for heavily increasing anxiety and nightmares, along with five sleeping pills.

Max came to visit me in the hospital after he literally dragged me there, and quietly explained that he’d caught Roxy dumping tablets into my water before she would reseal on the cap and dissolve all the chemicals. He assumed her plan was to get larger and larger amounts into my body day after day in an attempt to get me to…well…kill myself. He theorized that Roxy possessed some kind of disorder that made her lovesick to himself, and that she saw me as an obstacle to get to him.

In reality, I don’t think Max ever even remotely considered her as a lover, or even a best friend in that prospect. I’m sick just even thinking that we called someone that ill ‘our friend’ at one point.

Still, even after I caught up on my sleep, I never admitted how I really felt to Max. I thanked both him and Mark profusely for what they’d done, and we each vowed to keep the secret to our graves.

In an ideal world, me and Max would have walked off into he sunset, me having admitted that I really did love him, but after what images and nightmares my brain mixed with a what those chemicals created, I don’t think I can ever look at him the same way again.

Perhaps somethings are better just left in the past. I’m twenty-one now, and the whole thing feels like nothing more than a distant memory. Still, I can recall all the events, even the way Roxy would pretend to giggle and laugh with the rest of us. But now that I think of it, she always did loom close to Max. It truly bugs me to think how long she was planning her beyond sick scheme, but I don’t think it’s over yet.

All these long-forgotten events and memories came rushing back to me this morning after I tripped over a plastic water bottle left on my front doorstep with a single word scribbled in ink over the label. *Drink.*

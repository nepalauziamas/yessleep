A call, that if I’m honest with myself, I initially thought was going to make an amusing story that I could tell my husband over dinner.  After all, sleepwalking isn’t a real emergency, right..?

Below I’ve copied and pasted the transcription of the call.

\>>9-1-1 call.  Recorded: 12:01PM.

“9-1-1.  What’s your emergency?”

“Hello.  My name is Maggie Ellis and, um, I need help.”

“Yes, ma’am, I will assist you.  What is the nature of your emergency?”

“It’s my husband.  He – there is something wrong.”

“Okay, ma’am, what exactly is the problem?  Is your husband hurt?  Is he threatening you?  Tell me everything that you can.”

“Well, I don’t know how to explain it. My husband, Joe, he took a nap.  That’s not unusual.  Every day at 11:30AM, he takes his siesta then he wakes up promptly a half hour later.  He doesn’t even need an alarm.  Anyway that’s not important.  So Joe nods off as usual and I go to do the laundry and next thing I know, not five minutes later, there he is standing right behind me.  But the thing is it’s not him.  I mean, it is, but – he’s sleepwalking.”

“Sleepwalking?”

“Yes.  The man I’ve been married to for 29 years is sleepwalking for the first time, well, ever.  And he’s staring at me, only he’s not.  More like staring through me.  You know, like not seeing me.  And his eyes… they looked cloudy. Not blue.  My Joe, his eyes are blue like the ocean.  But these eyes were gray just like the sky just before a storm.”

“Ma’am, are you asking what to do with someone who is sleepwalking?  If possible, I believe you should gently, very gently guide your husband back to bed.”

“Yes, I know.  I did that.  I went to Joe and I said, ‘Joe, Sweetie, you’re sleeping.  I’m going to bring you back to bed.  Okay?”  But… but he didn’t move.  He just stood there like he was made of stone.  And then, when I went to check his forehead to see if he was warm or sick… he hit me.”

“Your husband struck you?”

“Yes, and hard.  Never… NEVER in all our time together has he ever done this.  The man, he’s an accountant.  He’s practically a pacifist.”

“Okay, ma’am, I don’t fully understand what is happening, but just to be safe, I’m going to send someone to assist you.  Where is your husband now?”

“I – I don’t know.  After he hit me, he just – he just walked off and I just – I didn’t know what to do so I called his doctor but he wasn’t in and so I called you.  Here, let me see if I can find him.  Joe!  Joe, can you hear me?’”

“Ma’am, I don’t need you to go looking for him.  Please just stay where you are.”

“Oh… oh my.”

“Ma’am, what is happening?  Listen to me, I need you to go somewhere safe.  Where are you now?”

“I’m in the kitchen… what in God’s name has happened?  Every drawer has been opened… Oh my… Joe, what on earth have you done?”

“Ma’am, please tell me what you see?  Ma’am?”

“It’s all the drawers.  They’ve been emptied.  And, and… two of the knives from the butcher’s block are… Oh no… Joe… Joe Sweetie, it’s Maggie, your wife.”

“Ma’am, please talk to me.  Is your husband there?”

“Joe, please.  Please put down the knives.  You’re sleeping.  Joe!  Joe, wake up!”

\[UNINTELLIGIBLE SCREAM\]

“Joe, no!  Joe, stop!  Joe, wake up!  Please God wake up!”

\>>End of call.

Less than two seconds after the call went dead, I called Maggie back.  My training, I suppose, took over even as my heart went racing out of control and all the saliva in my mouth fled to God only knows where.

Feeling powerless, I prayed – I might have even spoken out loud – “Maggie, pick up.  Please.”

But still I knew, I knew from the pitch and the tenor of her screams… I know this might sounds strange, but it’s a skill I’ve developed in part because of my brave, borderline reckless little four year old, Brian.  God do I love that boy so, but I swear not a week, not one fucking week, goes by when Bri-Bri doesn’t injure himself somehow, emulating his hero, that Brit survivalist, Bear Gryls, jumping off trees and rocks.  Over time, I’m not kidding, I’ve learned my son’s screams so acutely I could tell the type of injury without even seeing it.  Cuts and scrapes sounded different than bumps and bruises.  And when he broke his arm last year, I knew even though I was I was out of view and a good forty feet away, I knew that injury was different; I could hear not just pain but panic in his voice, believing in his little heart he just might die.  He didn’t.

Hearing Maggie’s scream over the phone, shrill and desperate at first then crescendoing in this gurgle of blood, I knew, even as her phone continued to ring, I knew there was zero -- ZERO chance she would answer.

Less than ten minutes later, police arrived at Maggie and Joe Ellis’s house, finding Maggie still in the kitchen where he had left her.  The Medical Examiner would later count exactly twenty stab wounds, ten to the chest, another ten to the face.  Never before had the M.E. seen an attack that was so savage, but also so exacting.  As for Maggie’s killer, Joe himself was nowhere to be found.  The backdoor to the house was left wide open.  The knives from the butcher’s block gone.

Given what had happened, given that my face was white as a sheet, my hands trembling with fright (fright, also shame), given all that, my supervisor, David, volunteered to drive me home.  I told him no.  I might have even said something idiotic like this not being my first rodeo, trying to pretend my stomach wasn’t spinning cartwheels.  Looking back, I don’t know what the hell I was thinking.  Maybe I was trying to feign bravery and take back control.  Whatever the reason, I told myself, “Just take another call.  Move on and forget.  Move on and just help whoever calls next.

It took less a minute until the next call came in, but because we work in rotation, it didn’t come to my station but instead to Marissa Carmichael, my best friend at work and my role model for pretty much everything – husband, children, work life balance – Marissa had it all figured out.

She always joked that the key to life was to make as many mistakes as possible, preferably when you’re still young.  Marissa swore that to truly learn, first you had to fail.  Marissa had experience at failing, having been kicked out of school when she was sixteen after getting knocked up by an abusive piece of shit who was at least 10 years older.  Later she’d lose the baby after getting pushed down the stairs, her swollen belly smacking hard against the slab tile floor.  Hitting literal rock bottom, Marissa, long story short, picked herself up, she buried her unborn child, got her GED and joined the Navy, returning years later to Greenville a changed woman.

First thing she did when she got back to town was bait her abusive piece of shit ex into a fight where he threw the first punch and she threw the last.  I tell you Marissa was my hero.  Not just unflappable, but invulnerable.

Or so I thought.

The call came from the local hospital, St. Francis Memorial, which in itself, yeah, maybe that should have raised alarm bells, I mean considering that a hospital has their own security and obviously no one is better equipped to handle a medical emergency.

Below is that 911 call.

\>>9-1-1 call.  Time: 12:06PM.

“9-1-1.  What is your emergency?”

“Help!  This is Sharon Clarke, I am a RN in the ICU here at St. Francis.  We have a security guard down.  We need help.”

“Sharon, I hear you.  I will dispatch police right away.  But first, what exactly do you mean “down”?”

“Stabbed.  Dead.  I don’t know.  It was a patient.  She was asleep, then she just got up.  She took out her catheter and just started wandering.  I tried to stop herself myself, but… I couldn’t.  It was – it was like she wasn’t even there.  Like she was sleepwalking.  So I had security try to bring her back and, oh god… she stabbed him.  Stabbed him with a damn 14 gauge piercing needle.  Oh Jesus, oh god, there’s another one.”

“Sharon, another what?”

“Another patient.  Oh Jesus, he’s got blood on his gown.  And his eyes… Oh god, he’s got a scalpel.  Help!  Somebody help!  Oh no, he’s walking toward me.”

“Sharon, I need you to listen…”

“Oh god no.  He’s not walking, he’s running!  Help!  Help me!”

“Sharon, run.  Run and get somewhere -- ”

\[UNINTELLIGIBLE SCREAM\]

\>> End of Call.

As quickly as the call ended, Marissa was sending police en route.  At the time, I had only heard one side of the call (I would read the transcript later), but already I knew somehow her call and mine were related.  I wanted so badly to talk to Marissa right then and there, to confirm the horrible churning in my gut, but I couldn’t because now my line was ringing as well.

And not just mine, but all five terminals all at once.  Marissa, Glenn, Rebecca, Luiz, all of our lines flashing red.

Now Greenville is not a large town by any stretch of the imagination.  In total there are maybe 6,000 residents, but still we have small town pride when it comes to emergency services, vowing we will always be there for a neighbor in need.

My hope is whoever reads this will be compassionate and not judge any of us too harshly for not putting two and two together sooner, but in our defense, none of us could believe what was happening.  Seemingly normal people from all walks of life, all of them residents of Greenville, were falling asleep, most taking a casual mid-afternoon nap, only to wake up minutes later changed, eyes milky white, and with an unquenchably thirst for violence.

\-- I have to go.

I can hear someone… something outside scratching at the door -- also my eyes are so heavy – I have to stand.  I have to do something.  If I sit any more, I’ll sleep.

So far it’s been 36 hours since that first call.  12 hours since I last heard from my husband and close to 48 hours since I last slept.

I don’t know what is causing this.  I don’t know if it’s viral or bacterial – I just don’t know.  Nobody does.  It’s like a sickness, one that doesn’t have a name or a genesis or whatever, but the symptoms are clear.

All I can do is try to stay awake just a little longer, one hour, one minute at a time.  And just hope somehow, someone, somewhere can please, please make this waking nightmare stop.

It makes no sense, but there is ABSOLUTELY NOTHING about what is happening here in Greenville anywhere on the news, on the internet, nowhere… it’s like the whole town has been sucked into a black hole, but I swear to God, what is happening here is real.

God, I am so tired…

After I check the windows and the doors, I think I’m going to go take a cold shower.  And then more coffee.

With luck, I’ll find the strength to keep writing.

I know this might sound cowardly, but the truth is there is a part of me that just wants to close my eyes.  A part of me that is ready to give up and accept my fate for doing the unthinkable.  For abandoning my post.

That’s right, I did -- I abandoned my terminal.  I ran out on my co-workers and left calls unanswered when I was needed most.  When my town needed me.

But I didn’t have a choice, I HAD TO LEAVE.

It took longer than maybe it should’ve to accept that this wasn’t just some dream.  But the pathology was crystal clear.  You sleep, you change, you kill.

And that’s when this thought washed over me, flooding every synapse of my brain, until all rational function was gone and all that was left was dread.

Brian...  My four year old little angel.  It was almost nap time at my son’s school.

This was about three weeks ago when I was home alone and in my computer playing games when I heard really loud revving. I pulled back my curtains to see two cars slam full speed into each other. I immediately ran to my door to go outside and call the police. 

I started pulling on the door but it was locked and while I was unlocking it I look out the window next to the door. It was my friends car and I stopped, I acted as if I didn’t hear or see anything and quickly ran to my room. I got under the covers and turned on some really loud music. I had a hard time falling asleep but eventually did after around 30 minutes. 

I woke up five hours later and looked out the window to see nothing. Absolutely nothing in site, like it hadn’t even happened. I sprung out of bed to see my mom on the couch. “Hey ma?” I said. “What’s up hun?” She asked while pausing the TV. “A little while ago I heard some loud noise while I was sleeping, did you drop something?” I questioned as I walked to sit. “When?” She said confused. “Around five hours ago.” I said. “I’m not sure what you heard, I was at grandma’s picking up grandpa’s old clock.” She said while standing up to go to the bathroom.

I walked backed to my room stunned. I pulled out my phone and looked up the car accident that happened. Nothing. I called my friend, nothing. I brushed it off as a dream but now I’m not so sure it was.

Exactly one week later I get a call from an odd number, 100-000-0000. Fascinated, I answered with a, “Hello?” “…” “who’s this?” I whispered. “…” “Why did you c-“ I tried to say. “Why didn’t you call 911 when it happened? The person on the other line yelled. I hung up and threw my phone in my bed.

They kept calling and calling every second of the day but it was a different number each time. 200-000-0000 and then 300-000-0000 and it continued going up one number at a time. In a matter of 30 minutes they called over 100 times. 

I just put my phone on silent and got my number changed the next day. I got a text instead from the number 542-120-0000. “Michael Nick Pilson. 7391 Solty rd.” It read. My full name and address. “Why didn’t you call?” Another text read. I blocked them and called 911.

“911 what’s your emergency?” A soft voice said. “Someone keeps calling me and now they messaged me my full name and address.” I said shakily. “Ok sir, remain calm. What’s your name?” Her voice sounded slightly different like she got more serious or upset. “Michael Pilson.” I replied. “Is this person known to you?” She asked while slowly starting to sound more familiar. I paused, “N-no.” “One more question alright?” She said when I realized who she sounded like. “Why didn’t you call a week ago!?” She screamed.

It hung up on its own. That’s when I really started panicking. I got into my car and floored it over to my friends apartment. I jumped out of the car and ran up the steps. I fumbled with my keys and dropped them. I bent down to pick it up. I heard a groaning noise behind me and put the key between my fingers and punched it’s throat.

It was my friend I saw in the accident. “Omg I’m so sorry are you ok?!” I yelled. I looked down the stairs and yelled for help. When I looked back it was some beat up decomposing dead lady with glass all in her face. I bolted to my car and took off.

As I turned onto my road I saw another car coming at me full speed. We slammed into each other really hard, I looked to my left to my house and see the same lady staring at me through the window. I was in so much pain and if I didn’t get help soon I knew I would die. 30 minutes go by and I pass out, I remember thinking this is it.

I wake up in the bathtub and down the hall I could hear footsteps. I get out of the bathroom and go to my moms closet. I climb onto the top shelf and put my hand over my mouth. I heard high heels walking down the hall and into the bathroom. I hear a super loud scream, it sounded like she was mad. 

I’m currently writing this while she’s searching the bedroom and all I hear is grunts and the sound of things being thrown. She just quickly searched the closet but didn’t find me, she just sighed and she’s walking slowly towards the door to check elsewhere. Wait a hear something else. It sounds like creaking, wood about to snap?? Wait-

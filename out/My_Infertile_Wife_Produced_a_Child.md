Janelle and I couldn’t get enough of each other in the beginning. We were young and insatiable, attached at the hip in every way. When I finally proposed, she responded with a tearful yes, but soon she began asking her own question; one I was less eager to answer. She’d hold me with her smooth, sweaty legs as we lay exhausted in bed. Her pounding heart would beat against mine as she lay on top of me and she would whisper “Can we have a child now?”

I was hesitant at the start, and would pick from a number of pre-loaded responses including “Soon” or “Of course, just not yet.” I was young and wanted to focus on my career, and the permanent jump into parenthood with no experience was a terrifying thought. Still, I loved Jan more than I’d loved anyone else. When we finally married in a small familial ceremony upstate, I began to realize I wanted to raise a child too. Though young, it was true we weren’t getting any younger. One night about a month after our wedding, Janelle squeezed me with her arms and asked “Can I have a baby?”

I’ll never forget the glint in her tear-filled, emerald eyes as I casually replied “Yes.” They sparkled with a passion I’d never seen before, and a sudden lust consumed her. Birth control was immediately cast aside. She straddled me with an unbridled passion and as we made love, I only then wished I’d said it sooner.

Those first few weeks we spent every evening in each other's sweaty embrace, rarely bothering to get dressed until the jarring alarm woke me each morning. Janelle began the bi-weekly habit of prancing to the bathroom to pee on a plastic stick, eager to see those two lines appear, but they never did. After a month of waning enthusiasm, she began to drag her feet. I consoled her as best I could, and soon suggested we see a fertility specialist.

My heart teetered on a steep precipice as I gave sperm samples to my physician. I had a feeling Janelle would have kids with or without me based on how passionate she was about it. As selfish as it sounds, I exhaled with great relief when she told me the problem was within her anatomy, not mine. Janelle was infertile; anovulation due to POF—premature ovarian failure. She was devastated.

The first few weeks I would gently try to help by suggesting alternative options, but it only seemed to exacerbate her miserable state. When I mentioned the suggestions from the fertility specialist such as donor eggs or adopting a child, her face contorted with a hatred I’d never seen her show before. I decided to let her come to terms with her infertility on her own. I did my best to be sensitive, supportive and caring, yet she only withdrew as the weeks stretched on into months. I felt like I was losing her, and an echo chamber of misery seemed to cast a permanent shadow inside our apartment. Then two months ago, Janelle had an accident.

I was on my lunch break uptown when I got a call from her in the hospital she worked at. She assured me everything was alright, she’d sliced the tip of her thumb off while chopping vegetables and needed stitches. I was going to rush over, but she assured me she was fine and to wait until after work. When I picked her up from the hospital, she rushed over and squeezed me tight, crying hot, wet tears into my chest as she apologized over and over for having been so cold to me. We held each other and cried, releasing the toxic buildup that we’d held in for so long. I teased her about her puffy bandaged thumb with dad jokes about hitchhiking and mentioned how she, with her perpetual thumb's up, appeared to be giving everything an approval of coolness. She groaned, but then truly laughed for the first time since her diagnosis. It felt like everything might actually be OK.

Janelle began smiling, laughing and truly living in the present with me once again. That sparkle that I’d missed for the past few miserable months returned to her crystal eyes. Facing our own mortality has a way of knocking other problems down to size, and Janelle seemed to follow that pattern of putting things into perspective. Despite her improvement in mood, however, she continually shied away from my physical advances. It was as if sex had no productive purpose anymore so she’d lost interest in it altogether.

“Please, not now,” she’d say or “I’m just not ready yet.” I’d nod and breath deeply before letting her know I understood. I wanted to spend my life with her, there was no rush. Then she began dressing differently. Long turtlenecks and blue jeans quickly replaced her form-fitting outfits. She would switch out into long sweatpants in the bathroom each evening, and I felt she was intentionally hiding any glimpse of her body to avoid leading me on. I began to notice the strange way her clothing hung, and I soon realized she’d been losing a dramatic amount of weight. In a matter of months, she withered away from the curvy woman I couldn’t get enough of into a slim, stiff version of herself. 

I began to spend more time at work, focusing on getting the raise that my employer dangled before me like bait. I tagged along to the trade show in Miami one weekend, realizing part of me just wanted to get away from Jan. I kissed her goodbye that Friday morning, expecting to see her on Sunday evening, but plans changed. The second day of the trade show was canceled due to a power issue, and I took a flight back Saturday instead. I was exhausted and only looked forward to a long shower, but concern grew when Janelle didn’t answer my texts I’d sent from the airport. Worry became panic when I called repeatedly and got her inbox. I rushed home and unlocked the door, but sighed with relief upon entering. Jan’s coat was on the chair and the shower was running.

“Jan, honey, I’m back a day early, everything OK?” I called to her, but the hiss of the shower seemed to drown out my voice.

“Honey” I called out and walked over to the door. My dress shoe slipped on the floor, and I fought to remain upright. I looked down in confusion to the spattering of red on the floor I immediately knew was blood. “Janelle!” I screamed out as dread twisted my heart in my chest. I turned the knob and flung open the door, my gaze following the blood trail to a serrated kitchen knife on the tile floor. Above it, sitting naked on the lip of the bathtub, was Janelle. 

I then understood why she’d stayed covered up from head to toe around me for the past few months. Large chunks of her skin and muscle were slivered away. Puffy, mottled skin encircled the sinewy craters she’d carved from her own body. In other places, large crusty scabs sat within bruised flesh, purple and infected. Deep gouges ran along her forearms and thighs revealing scar tissue, shiny and pink where the muscle had been whittled down. Some wounds were red and fresh, streaming glistening ribbons of blood from recently flayed strips. I struggled to remain upright as the butchered body of my wife turned to me with a smile, revealing what she held in her slender, peeled arms.

It was a mass of clumped meat, wrapped in a stitched-together quilt of Janelle’s skin. A sculpture comprised of her own carved flesh and blood, sewn into the form of a patchwork infant in varying degrees of spoil. It was a child produced from her own mutilated body, with a putrid thumb tip nose from the accident that triggered the horrific idea. Janelle held the thing to her now breast-less chest and rocked it gently back and forth in her hacked arms.

“Isn’t he beautiful?” she asked, looking down at the meaty collage with loving eyes wet with tears of joy. I fell backward on the blood-spattered trail on the floor, struggling to get away from the ungodly scene, but not before seeing it. Before I called the ambulance with shaky hands—before I vomited on myself, before I crawled from the bloody bathroom, before I could turn away from the horror—I saw it. I saw that nightmarish sculpture of a baby slowly turn its bloated head towards me, and [smile](https://www.reddit.com/user/mrmichaelsquid/).

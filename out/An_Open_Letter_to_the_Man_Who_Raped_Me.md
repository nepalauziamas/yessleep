To Ahmad Adeeb Azizi:

Otherwise known as the man who raped me.

This is a formal notification to lawfully inform you that this month I am filing a criminal police report against you for raping me in the Fall of 2019, when I was 20 year old college student. This is the only, final, and last contact of message you will have from me until you are contacted by my law firm or the district attorney’s office about legal developments in my case against you.

I am exercising my legally protected first amendment freedom of speech which is protected under the constitution to reach out to you to notify you that I have filed a police report against you for raping me in the fall of 2019. I am also exercising my legally protected 1st amendment freedom of speech to let others know, truthfully, of what you did to me, and my opinion of your character as a result of the harm you have caused me, when you were in you forties and I was a 20-year old college student. 

I will make sure the whole world knows your name: Ahmad Adeeb Azizi. I will make sure the whole world knows that you are a rapist. You will be held legally accountable for what you did to me.

I also wanted to let you know that in California there is no statute of limitations on rape. You have a degree in criminology (which you lied to me about never going to college) so you should know what this means. It means that for the rest of your life you can and should expect to see me in court. I have forever and you’re just gonna have to wait to see when I decide. In my opinion, as a result of the harm you have caused me, you belong in two places: a prison cell and a sex offender registry.

I also have ten years to file a civil lawsuit against you which I plan on doing. And with the current progression of women’s rights, I wouldn’t be surprised if California extended that statute of limitations indefinitely as New York has done so I can wipe you out at seventy years old.

I have criminal and civil judicial routes to hold you accountable which I can access at any point throughout my life.

If you for one second consider intimidating me as a victim of your crime note that dozens of people from my friends, former roommates, mentors, family, government officials in departments, a diplomat, security, private drivers, colleagues, therapist, stranger, acquaintances, assistants, to multiple police departments in California, including Alameda, and Irvine, just to name a few, know about this situation, KNOW ABOUT YOU and are keeping a close eye. This is documented forever in my personal text, audio, video, and in their memory as well as many other people in varying levels of authority. Even some of your neighbors, fellow realtors, business partners know, and are disgusted, and now all of your employees. You can’t hurt me anymore. You are seen by all. A 100+ member family who are fiercely protective of me. Who also know everything, even things I am not letting you know, and are actively advising me on the best legal plan.

You caused me lifelong trauma, anxiety, depression, and PTSD. You have to live in your body forever; that of a rapists’. Despite being the victim here I say of myself that I am a good person, I am worthy of a wonderful life, and I deserved to be respected, which you cannot say of yourself.

You might think because I was a 4 foot 10 inch Asian college girl that I was a “perfect victim”. Well, not only was I the wrong one to rape, but you were better off trying to rape a Loch Ness monster, or Medusa, who herself in Greek mythology turned into an invincible “monster” after experiencing rape in the Temple of Athena. There are many completely legal and justified actions, I have reviewed with authority figures, I can take and will take against you to remedy the pain and suffering you have caused me. It is beyond the scope of your creativity to even imagine what these legal options are. Just like I didn’t have a choice in whether you raped me or not, you’re not gonna have a choice in the way I legally write the story of your life here, now, and forever. I am excited in anticipation to see you legally accountable for your actions throughout the course of your life.

You have no power over me.

I am much more courageous, creative, resourceful and intelligent than you must believe I am to have done what you did to me, I realize now you actually have no idea who I am, or what I capable of, beyond that tinder profile.

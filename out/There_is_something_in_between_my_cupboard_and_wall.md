I  lived in my dad's/grandparent's house for most of my life but recently my mom built her own house in a property that she inherited from her family.  My mom ,my sister and now I live there.  

I had always wanted a little more space but  I have a moderately sized room now. I've converted it into a art studio with my posters and manga work on the walls and my art equipment.  It's literally my favorite place on Earth.  Honestly I dread it so much when I have to live away from my room ( like when going to uni) . This is all background. 

I moved into this new place about a year ago. ( 10 months to be precise) and it was completely empty before I moved in. I brought all my stuff from my old room. The tables,beds, cupboard etc.  And I did not notice this until very recently.  

Ever since I moved in, I've always felt a bit off about something in the room.  Like when I barge in from the outside, it suddenly looks off.  Or when I see it in my periphery, it's like something is like slightly off. 

My cupboard has legs that don't go all the way against the wall so there's a small about 2 inch space between it and the wall.  The wall is white and the cupboard casts a pretty dark shadow considering it's angle to the sunlight from the window.  So it's pretty hard to see into this space.  ( rather it doesn't catch your eye) Obviously it's not that I can't move the cupboard and look. I can and I have, more than once. It's just a wall.when I do.  

But everyone waking moment I feel like it's somehow wrong. That it has this depth to it thaf normal things don't.  It's very difficult to explain but it's darker than it should be orile there's a hole there. 

Like there's a similar space between my bed and the wall and the two desks and the wall, they don't bother me or look strange. But this space does.  

I thought it was just some weird shadow issue.( Like an optical illusion) So I very randomly to this day shine my phone's torch at the space.  And it's literally just a wall. 

But I can't shake the feeling that it's somehow not correct ,It's driving me very uneasy.  It's like finding a bright and colorful house in the middle of a jungle or something.  It's perfectly normal when you investigate but it just makes you feel.off.  

Anyone else know what this could mean? ( Or have similar experiences, the only popular similar story I saw was that one about there being strairs in the woods. But my thing doesn't feel malicious like that one. ) 

I'm not even using a throwaway account. Like actually DM me if you know something about this.  Or comment. 
( I'll send a picture of the space if someone wants to see it too)

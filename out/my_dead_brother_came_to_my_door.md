about a year ago my brother Arlo 'died' in his sleep but just a few hours ago he came to my house, he said my mum had made him runaway he was living in Detroit and decided to come see his sister, I'm terrified I saw his body In his bed! He was dead! But apparently not  "please.. belive me Where's mum?" I didn't want to tell him she'd have a heart attack! But he's my brother I'm so scared, what If that wasn't Arlo? What if he didn't die? I'm so confused I called the police but they didn't do anything.

Hello this is the next day from writing this 'Arlo' came to my home again he let himself in and went to the kitchen, I had 911 on speed dial I closed the front door and looked into the kitchen 'Arlo' grabbed a knife and looked behind him terrified I ran into my basement closing the door, I called the police I told them what happened this time they finally came I told the police that I left the door unlocked so they entered and according to them 'Arlo' was covered in blood standing over the dead body of my cat. He was arrested about 10 minutes ago I'm devastated my poor cat did not deserve this! 

This is the same day. At around 2am that wasn't Arlo. That was a insane man his name was Galfa but he died when they took him in he had a seizure so now I guess that wasn't Arlo and he is indeed still in his grave I hope he is in a better place, tomorrow I will be going to a cat shelter I really miss my cat and I want some company I know I should wait but I still just need a animal or something to calm me down from this traumatic experience, yes I did tell my mother about what happened she is terrified. But thankfully that will not happen again. This is my no sleep horror story it mightbnit be scary to an outside perspective but it's terrifying I don't even know if Gafta died or if he'll come back to me I'm so scared. But I will hopefully get over this and I'm only 15 I'm living alone in a suburb im hopefully going to move away, he won't be able to get me. This is a throwaway account I needed to tell someone so I'm telling you

Thank you for hopefully listening/reading I do not want clout or anything I just want to tell someone my horror story, 


Update

This is 3 days after I wrote the bit above I got a new cat I named it salian and I've been looking for a new house, it's Arlo's birthday today so I wrote to my brother about what happened in hope he'd protect me I'm happy things have changed hope Gafta never finds me if he's still out there

This is the last update I will write thank you for you're time and please be careful

You’ll have to forgive me if it seems like I’m rushing things. I just want to get this out while I can—before they come back.  

I had been on an evening walk along a trail near my home when I was suddenly approached by three men, all wearing the same thing: a black, snugly fit turtleneck sweater and plain black slacks. Weirdly, they were all barefoot, as if their budget for business casual had run out at the ankle. They all wore glasses, darkly shaded though not entirely black. I remember finding it really weird, not only because it was evening, but because I got the baseless yet nonetheless yet immediate impression that they hadn’t ever *needed* glasses, for any reason, because they didn’t have.... 

The sidewalk wasn’t exactly wide, so I had to slow my pace, because not one of them made a move to part from the group. It was obvious, by their oddly tense demeanor, that they had come for me—that our meeting on the sidewalk wasn’t owed to chance. Still, even as DANGER alarms began signaling in my brain, I tried to casually step-step the trio; walking onto the curb, whilst hoping that a car wasn’t on its way from behind. Only a moment or two after I had mounted the curb, the leftmost member stepped in front of me, barring my passage. I stopped, then; unsure of how to respond, anxiety blossoming in my chest.  

The man’s head then did a very strange thing—it ballooned. The expansion was rapid, almost instantaneous, and the glasses were sent spiraling away from his face, slapping me square in mine. As I had somehow anticipated, there weren’t any eyes on the face; *there weren’t any features at all*—I somehow hadn't noticed the utter lack of ears and mouths, just the aforementioned glasses; and apparently their budget hadn't included anything in the realm of facial disguises beyond eyewear.  

The head was just a bulbous, still-expanding surface of skin. I reeled back, from the force of the glasses’ impact against my face and the sheer absurdity of the sight. Footsteps behind me briefly brought my attention away from the bizarre cranial expansion, and turning I saw more of the blackly clad men approaching from not far away. How they had come to appear so suddenly, I couldn’t tell, but terror gripped my heart and throttled it; and I figured that, given the circumstances, the open road was the best direction to flee.  

I managed to make it across the street, but then more half-heartedly dressed figures emerged from the trees that lined this side of the road. All were dressed in the same incomplete way, and devoid of basic facial anatomy... Just as they neared me, their heads began to expand, silently and hideously, and glancing back I saw that the others had also begun their own cephalic ballooning. It was a wild, maddening sight; and for a moment I wondered if I were having some horrible, hyper-real nightmare. But a cold, firm grip upon my shoulder confirmed the dreadful reality of my circumstances.  

Before I could be seized and dealt some terrible fate, I jerked away and ran, hoping that I could reach a populated area before they caught up with me. But unlike monsters in horror movies and games, these nightmares did not casually stroll after me. Like bloodhounds who had scented their prey and thus been given permission to pursue, those huge-headed horrors came sprinting after me; their heads bobbling uncannily above their bodies; their feet slapping loudly against the pavement.  

Terror surged anew, and my body received a welcome flush of adrenaline as my mind receded inward, higher thought diminishing in favor of more primal impulses. I quickened my sprint, thinking of only escape and survival.  

With every second that passed it seemed as if the light was being siphoned from the sky, sundown arriving with preternatural swiftness. I didn’t know where I was going, had ventured well away from my usual walking path. But those things behind me never let up, were monstrously tireless, and I refused to slow down for even a moment to try and ascertain some sense of location from my surroundings.  

That horrible pursuit *almost* came to an abrupt, fatal end when a car—seeming to materialize out of nowhere—struck me in the side at a dark intersection; sending me a good twenty feet away from the site of impact. I had never been hit by a car before, and I can say in the split-second before impact, when your body senses that roaring, raging construct of metal, you feel the entirety of your being shrink in a way that is very humbling. The human body is an incredible thing—but it’s also incredibly fragile, and nothing else in the civilian world is a better reminder of that than a car’s front bumper on its way to kiss your ribcage.  

I probably would’ve lain there, mentally and physically wrecked, if the clamor of those barefooted bobbleheads hadn’t reached my ears. Against every rattled nerve in my body, against every mounting sensation of discomfort and pain, I got up and continued on; hobbling weakly and gritting my teeth against the full-body hurt. 

 I heard a car horn, presumably directed at me, and then the horn’s source sped by, the driver flooring it. I called out, but my voice was barely audible, the air having been ejected from my lungs by the retreating driver’s vehicle. Looking back, I saw with fresh horror that my pursuers had all somehow joined together into a horrific, single-headed entity, from which extended their otherwise separate bodies. Their legs ran with a perfected simultaneity, while the head—gargantuan, featureless, ungodly—pulsed and wobbled above. At that moment, at that unbelievable, impossible sight, I didn’t blame the guy for the hit-and-run. I would’ve gotten the hell out of there, too.  

I can only thank nature and its animals’ begrudged affinity with mankind for my salvation.  

As the sky darkened and visibility was reduced to a small radius around me, the sounds of night started up; and an atmosphere of unrest arose throughout. From the trees lining the unluckily empty road came a raucous as of some bestial circus, and for a moment I feared that other horrors, being active exclusively at night, would emerge and join the chase. But then, in complete contradiction to this not unreasonable fear—considering the already bizarre circumstances—something extraordinary happened: wildlife, of all shapes and sizes, came bursting out of the environing woods to assail my pursuers. Deer, squirrels, insects, birds, entire orders of the animal kingdom rushed, flew, scampered, and galloped from their homes and hovels to intercept that unwholesome chimera. As observers to the ineffable chase, amidst their leaf-hidden hiding places, they must’ve all convened and decided that this singularly skulled obscenity was an affront to man *and* beast.  

Birds pecked at the huge, blimp-sized head; squirrels sunk their teeth into the bare feet and chewed fiercely; insects swarmed, biting and stinging as if the endlessly inflating entity had been responsible for the destruction of all their lost hives, and the dethroning of their many queens. Deer mistook themselves for rams and charged into the bodies, goring the sweater-wearing figures again and again with their antlers. It was an incredible sight, one that almost made me forget the pain of my impromptu vitality check from the car. And yet somehow, in defiance of this multi-faceted assault, the joined-thing continued on—albeit slowly, its movements considerably impeded by the sheer volume and variety of bodies pressing against it.  

I shouted out my thanks to the sylvan interceptors, directing my voice universally rather than at any one animal, and then hurried away; leaving that sinister horror to contend with nature’s sentinels.  

I'm currently somewhere in the woods, hiding beneath a huge, undoubtedly ancient tree—perhaps the dwelling place of the tenacious birds or vicious squirrels who had come to my rescue back on the road. I don't know where I am, not exactly, but I can't have gone too far from home. I hope I haven’t, at least.  

It's too dark to go wandering around, and something—maybe the unnatural, unsettling quietude of the area—tells me that the monster is still out there, in some manner, in some unspeakable form. I don't know how injured I am, but I know I won't be able to run again; not for a while.  

Wish me luck that I make it home. My phone is almost dead; probably should've called someone…but what would I have said? This night has been one impossible occurrence after another.  

Why me?

I was never a fan of our local IHOP until the craziness that happened last summer. There were just too many good mom-and-pop breakfast places in town to bother with a franchise like IHOP. But that was before the place got the strange new cook and started offering, in my opinion, some of the best food on the planet. Before all of the bloodshed and the violence and the fire, I would have said our IHOP was practically heaven on Earth during the summer of 2021.

The stranger arrived in town via Greyhound bus in early May. I was actually at the station that morning picking up my good-for-nothing brother-in-law when the IHOP cook came in. He wasn’t the cook at the time, of course, just some young gun in a faded denim jacket and mirrored sunglasses that caught the sun. It’s a small town and we don’t see visitors much, so I tossed the fella a friendly wave. He smiled and, for a moment, I thought there was something funny about his teeth. When I looked again, it was normal. A car came and picked the stranger up a few minutes before Mike (that brother-in-law I mentioned) walked out the station, already smelling like scotch and Pepsi at nine in the morning.

Mike wanted to get breakfast before going to my house and insisted on IHOP. He even promised to pay, though I (accurately) predicted that he would tell me he couldn’t find his wallet when the bill came. Still, trying to be a good host and take care of my wife’s only brother, I drove my truck over to the IHOP. The joint was nearly empty when we walked in. Like I said, there were too many good places in town that didn’t have that corporate vibe. As we sat in our booth, I was surprised to see the young guy from the bus station setting up in the kitchen. His jean jacket was gone, replaced with a clean white shirt under a dirty white apron, but he was still wearing his fancy shades. The man shot me a wave and I smiled back. It was like we were already friends.

I ordered the country-fried steak and eggs while Mike got the smokehouse combo. My expectations were so low they’d be more of a pothole than a speedbump in Hell, but from the moment our waitress brought the food over, I knew something had changed. The eggs were fluffy, the meat was seared to perfection, and the smell of both our breakfasts almost made me snatch the plate from the server before she could set it down. It was the best meal of my life up to that point. I could tell from Mike’s expression that he felt the same. My brother-in-law was so stunned that he forgot to forget his wallet and actually paid for our food.

After leaving the IHOP, it was all I could think about that night. I lay in bed, tossing and turning, dreaming of the steak and the hashbrowns and the pancakes. I was up at six a.m. the next morning and at the restaurant ten minutes later. Unlike the day before, this time the IHOP was packed. Clearly, word had gotten out that the food was better. *Much* better. I caught a glance of the kitchen and saw the stranger in there again, surrounded by steam and smoke, his spatulas a blur.

The young guy was still wearing his aviators, so shiny they reflected the crowded IHOP back at us in the dining room. I ordered the breakfast sampler, though for a moment, then ordered a quick two-egg breakfast on the side…and sirloin steak tips to take home. All of us in the restaurant ate like it was our last meal. Food was flying, servers were diving out of the way like soldiers dodging artillery. Through it all, the stranger watched us behind his sunglasses, smiling in the brief moments when he was a whirlwind of action. Just like at the bus station, though, there was something *off* with the smile if I caught it from the corner of my eye. Something too stuffed, nearly bursting out.

Our whole family, maybe the entire town, started going to IHOP for every meal, every day. The weird thing was, nobody seemed to be gaining weight. In fact, I dropped a few pounds that month. All of us regulars were thinning out, actually, growing gaunter by the day. I began feeling odd–not sick, but *odd*. Mike was my usual IHOP partner and I noticed a change in him, as well. His eyes were drifting apart, his nose flattening, and his beer gut was dissolving until his ribs nearly poked out of his shirt. I felt a change in myself similar to his but unique. Every morning I woke up and my face was unfamiliar. My hair fell out in clumps and my jaw began to get longer. It was not enough to make me grotesque by any means; I wasn’t even getting second looks on the street.

Still, I knew that I was slowly becoming something else. There was no doubt in my mind that the IHOP’s new food had something to do with it but, like any addiction, I couldn’t stop. The food was too good. I’d still probably be devouring IHOP four or five times per day until I was unrecognizable if not for the two new strangers that came into town that June. Both were hard-looking men, graying and tall, dressed in black leather jackets. Neither of them spoke as they walked into the IHOP but everyone froze to watch them. The larger guy held a hunting crossbow, one of the modern ones, locked and loaded. There was a hiss from the kitchen; the new cook, the one in the sunglasses, climbed out behind the counter, moving like his limbs had too many joints.

I heard a *twang*. A crossbow bolt flew from the new stranger’s weapon, piercing the young cook to the wall. Instead of showing pain, the chef hissed again, louder this time, enough that the water glasses on several tables shattered. He was clawing at the bolt in his stomach, trying to pry himself free. The shot had knocked off his sunglasses. For the first time, I saw his eyes…or where his eyes should have been. There were only black sockets rimmed with row after row of tiny, sharp teeth. It was like he had a pair of miniature mouths, hungry and snapping, set above his nose.

The creature that used to be the cook almost worked its way free from the bolt before the second man in black leather threw a glass bottle with a burning rag. The molotov cocktail caught the monster square and the fire spread quickly. Those stranger hunters ushered us out of the IHOP as the flames began licking up the walls. Some of us–myself included–tried to bring our food with us. The two big men didn’t allow that. I looked back from the parking lot to see the IHOP engulfed in fire. There was a shadow in the door, a thing almost like a human but bent and burdened with too many arms. I heard another twang and the creature went flying back into the IHOP.

They never found the cook’s body. Both of the strangers in leather disappeared as well. Over the next week, it was like our small town woke up from a shared nightmare, a mad one full of distorted faces and inhuman food. I’m a religious man in my own way. I grew up hearing about the fire and the brimstone, a vengeful God, and the temptation of demons who might walk among us. Gluttony is one of the Seven Deadly Sins. I think I came face-to-face with it in a small-town IHOP in the middle of nowhere. Whenever I close my eyes, I see the young cook and his empty, hungry eyes.

I don’t know who those two hunters were but I am sure they saved us all. Still…it seems like I get a little hungrier each day.

I was on the train in a remote area in my country. I was on the phone but speaking out loud about black operations & the history of the society we live in.

I used to be a hacker & would know the intricacies of certain things. Instead of being smart & investing in the crypto I was throwing around for fun back then. I was doing dark things. When one transitions skills are maintained simply put. So I faced the dark in the world. Bare in mind I was a yogi & teenager simultaneously. I have performed exorcisms with shakti flying around the same year of this story.

I could heal as a child bla bla.

I was on the train late night... Perhaps a stop later, a stocky Eastern European looking man with a bomber jacket & black hat. But he had no hair anywhere.

He sat facing me, a few open seats distance with rows available. He sat there and just looked at me with no emotion.

I look at him while on the phone. He doesn't stop looking at me. I then realise I'm FUCKED. FUCKED FUCKED. please empathise, I was a late teen, looking at a big man with no hair.

I then went off the phone & my spirit guide appeared etherically & messaged me via my aura & said this a hit.
I don't meet my guides from what I'm aware of tbh but you can put 2 n 2 together.

He then still watched me but my fear was aparrent.

He saw the weakness & subtly smirked trying to keep his lips closed.

OKAY GUYS THERE IS DEEP EMOTIONAL WOE HAVING TO WRITE THIS SO TAKE IT WORD FOR FUCKING WORD.

After I got off the phone, I would peek at him over short timespans to see what intention was there.

He would then stare, then briefly look away. But he had a habit of his eyes rolling to the back of his head. & HE WOULD LICK AIR LIKE A FUCKING GECKO. WHITE STOCKY EASTERN LOOKING MAN. BOMBER JACKET & BLACK WOOLY BEANIE. NO HAIR.

The fear was immense in my body because I knew what time it was, I was 19. What were you doing at 19?
He then stared some more & we looked at each other. Time around was frozen, just locked in this. 
***REMEMBER THIS FOR THE ENDING I WILL COME BACK***

I then felt a draining energy as my fear was there. I felt like something had locked to my spirit like an energy hoover & is sucking my soul. 

The man started to grin & stare like he's getting a blowjob from two people in pleasure of what's occuring. 
(AS I'M WRITING THIS, GLOWING WHITE/BLUEISH ORBS ARE APPEARING NEXT TO MY HANDS. PLEASE UNDERSTAND I HAD TO LIVE THIS, NOT YOU) 

He was sucking my energy from under 10ft away in his seat. 

Can you imagine the fear? It's not even close to part 2. In part 2, I felt my cells freeze I was paralysed by what had happened. I could of passed out. I had ptsd for 10 years. I would see a cats eyes & go into literal shock. 

I NEED A BREAK RUN THE NUMBERS UP I WILL DO PART 2. THIS IS MY LIFE NOT YOURS

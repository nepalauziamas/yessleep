 Well,  I've been trying to find the source of the problem I'm facing for 3 days now.  But I got my answer this morning.

&#x200B;

   I live in an apartment in Montreal. I moved there about 2 months ago to be closer to my work and my university. It's a pretty lively place where everyone seems to be friends.

&#x200B;

  For you to visualize the entrance to the building:

  A staircase leading down to a door which is the front door. There is also a list of the names of each of the residents of the apartment with a button that allows you to trigger the microphone to speak through so that the person who is in his apartment can hear you. This is also useful for package deliverers who want to alert me that one of my deliveries has arrived.

&#x200B;

  4 days ago, on a Saturday, I was in my bed watching a Netflix movie. Since I didn't work on Saturdays and had a day off at my university, I decided to stay awake a lot more.

  Around 3:20 am, when I was watching my Netflix movie, a noise started to appear. At first, I thought it was coming from my oven which is a little defective and which produces a noise about every 5 hours. I also thought the noise was coming from my Netflix movie but the noise continued even when I paused.

  I get up and decide to find the source of the noise. After several investigations, I found the source of the noise.  It was coming from the loudspeaker which was next to my door.

 The problem ?

  You have to press the button in the entrance hall of my apartment (the one where there is a button with my name on it).  The only way to communicate with me is to long press the button.  I open the door to my apartment to go to the lobby to see if anyone wants anything.

&#x200B;

  There was nobody. 

&#x200B;

 I go back to my apartment and block my front door with a chair (just in case). 

  The day after :

  I didn't understand why there was this noise and I just wanted to forget it so it wouldn't obsess me and kill my day.

  Evening :

  I come home after seeing a movie at the cinema. I'm pretty happy because I saw my friend today for the first time in 1 year (due to the change of house) We went to Bowling and to the cinema and said goodbye around 8:00 p.m. and we each go back to our apartments. 

  4:18 a.m :

  I'm in my bed. I was watching a Youtube video. And suddenly, a HUGE noise suddenly appears. I immediately got up from my bed to find out what was going on. 

&#x200B;

 It was the loudspeaker again.

&#x200B;

  This time, I decide to answer by pressing the speaker button.

  \- Who are you ? 

 The noise suddenly stopped.  But I perceive footsteps that seem to go upside down (The footsteps decrease gradually).  I decide to call the police because I really couldn't take it anymore.  The police tell me they are sending 3 officers.

   

Several minutes pass...

&#x200B;

  The hours pass...

&#x200B;

  It's been 4 hours since I called the police.

  Nobody came.

  I go to sleep putting my closet in front of my front door and putting black tape on my windows so we can't see through them.

  The next day (9:40 am) :

  Today I woke up sweating a lot. I took my phone and I noticed that I was called twice by the Montreal police at 5:38 in the morning.  I decide to call them to find out what is going on.

  Someone was spotted in a bush that was stuck to the door leading to the apartment hall. According to the police officers, he was apparently waiting for someone.

 They found several items on him.

  Here they are :

&#x200B;

  \- Screwdriver

 \- Stolen identity card

 \- Lighter (but no cigarette)

 \- A photo in polaroid format

&#x200B;

  God knows how much I didn't want to see that picture.

&#x200B;

  It was me, crossing the street.

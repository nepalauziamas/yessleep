 

I will tell you my story. It's not very long.

It started a week ago. I don’t know why or how. I didn’t upset some witch and I didn’t go skinny dipping in a pool of nuclear waste or anything like that. Sometimes terrible things happen without reason, and this is one of them.

I shot awake at 12:42 AM with the urgent need to urinate. I waddled into the bathroom, pulled out my package… and just stood there. Nothing came out.

“Come on buddy,” I muttered to my member, “what’s the deal? Thought you had some business here.”

No response.

I gave it a little shake. “Come on now. Don’t have all night. Big meeting in the morning, gotta get some sleep.”

I was about ready to put it away and chug a glass of water when I felt a sharp stabbing pain in my inner thigh. It made me hunch over, and I smacked my forehead on the toilet lid.

“Fuck,” I muttered, straightening out. I dropped my boxers in order to inspect what was going on down there. I thought maybe a pimple had burst or something like that. Gross, but not as gross as what I saw.

Something was poking around under my skin. It looked like a crawling worm, twisting away just beneath the surface.

“Nope,” I said. “Just a little sleep deprivation. There’s not *really* something moving inside of me.”

As if to prove me wrong, my flesh started stretching, like something inside was pushing it further and further outward. This event was accompanied by a flash of burning, unforgiving pain. I screamed, and bucked all the way to the ground, arching my back like the letter C.

My wife Jess called out from our bedroom a moment later: “Honey? Everything okay in there? I *told* you not to eat that chili after you left it out all night.”

My daughter Ali joined in from her room: “Papa? You shouldn’t have eaten that chili.”

“I’m okay!” I lied. “Go back to sleep, girls.”

Then, as in the eye of a storm, everything settled down. I still felt like I had to pee, but the weird movement had stopped. But only for a moment. And the following moment brought with it a torrent of misery and horror unlike anything I had ever known.

A fleshy knob burst forth from inside my thigh with a gush of pink slime. I had two thoughts in quick succession. First: *It’s a dick.* Then: *No. It’s a nightmare. This isn’t happening.*

As my mind was turning things over, my mouth was screaming again. I don’t know how long that went on, but eventually Jess was banging at the door.

“Henry! Are you okay?! Henry?!”

“Get a knife!” I wailed. “Cut if off! Oh God, kill it! Please!”

“I’m coming in!” warned Jess.

“No!” I cried. But it was too late. She had opened the door, taken one look at the scene before her, and covered her mouth in shock.

“I don’t know what’s happening,” I sobbed. Then a jet of yellow fluid shot from the head of the thing, and I could no longer pretend that it wasn’t a second penis. The physical release of the urine felt supremely satisfying, and for a split second, I felt actually content, until I felt the warmth of my own piss pool up around my knees.

“Is that….?” started Jess.

“Y… yes,” I said. “I don’t know where it came from. Oh god, I’m a monster.”

“What do we do? Call 911?”

“No, it’s too embarrassing. And I’m so tired. I just… I just want to go to sleep and deal with it in the morning.”

I got cleaned up and settled back into bed. I was actually able to sleep for a little bit, I think because all of the adrenaline bursts wore me out. I had nightmares... of dicks sprouting out all over my body… one coming out my chest, one coming out my forehead, dripping in brain… but I *was* able to sleep.

In the morning, it was gone. Even though it would have been hard to miss, I still spent several minutes searching all the folds down there for some sign of it.

“Where did it go?” asked Jess.

“I don’t know,” I said. “But you *did* see it, right? That wasn’t just some nightmare, right?”

“Not unless two people can have the same nightmare.”

“Can they?” I wondered.

“I guess it’s possible. No less strange than another cock poking out of your thigh for the night and then disappearing, if you think about it.”

“True,” I said thoughtfully. “Maybe it crawled off somewhere? Maybe it was some kind of alien monster that only took the form of a cock?”

“Maybe,” said Jess. “You better get moving. You’re going to be late for your meeting.”

I did get ready, and I’ll tell you this: I felt great. It felt great not to have a random second penis flopping around on my body. It was one of the best feelings in the world.

But that night, it came back.

\*

The second night was no picnic either, but nothing will ever be as terrifying to me as that first night.

And I’ll tell you the rest of the story: it’s not so bad. After it was accepted that this was going to keep happening every night… it’s not so bad at all. There’s a saying that I consider one of the wisest among sayings. It goes like this: “Happy wife, happy life.” And well, let me put it like this: I have a *very* happy wife.

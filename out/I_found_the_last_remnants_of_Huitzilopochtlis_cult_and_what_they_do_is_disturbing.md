Today was a warm Sunday, the sun gleaming over the horizon, all things were waking up, the smell of flowers was amazing, and Hummingbirds flew overhead chirping along, most people in the morning get a coffee, and watch television, but for some in the woods, things were different.

around 2:23 PM I went jogging along the wooden trail, either listening to music as I run, or hearing the calls of the animals. During the jog, I went off the trail unknowingly, I was listening to music at the time, not paying any mind to my surroundings. I was deep within the forest, and I heard a voice, yelling? or was it chanting? I tried to make as little noise as possible, and as I peeked from behind the trees, I heard the voice clearly now, a man who seems to be leading a ceremony, there were multiple people in a line up onto an altar. I heard the man speak " Huitzilopochtli is first in rank, no one, no one is like unto him: not vainly do I sing (his praises) coming forth in the garb of our ancestors; I shine; I glitter.  

He is a terror to the Mixteca; he alone destroyed the Picha-Huasteca, he conquered them.

The Dart-Hurler is an example to the city, as he sets to work. He who commands in battle is called the representative of my God.

When he shouts aloud, he inspires great terror, the divine hurler, the god turning himself in the combat, the divine hurler, the god turning himself in the combat.

Amanteca, gather yourselves together with me in the house of war against your enemies, gather yourselves together with me.

Pipiteca, gather yourselves together with me in the house of war against your enemies, gather yourselves together with me."

He spoke again

"For you Totec Huitzilopochtli! Hummingbird Of the South! Lord Of War! Patron Of the Mexica Tribe, and the city of Tenochtitlan! for it may have been lost, it will be returned under you might! 

Take these offerings as thanks, for defending our tribe from the vile Spainards! your strength knows no bounds, now feast! Hummingbird Of the South!"

After his speech, ten men stepped up to the altar, and the priest took an obsidian blade, and cut open each of their bodies, taking out the still beating heart, and showing it to the heavens, the heart was tossed in a fire, and the bodies of the men were carried away. My heart felt afraid, but also exhilarated, but I pushed those feelings aside and attempted to flee, but the priest saw me.

"Come here, Spainard.. for you are of our blood, and you have seen our ritual..." Two men grabbed me by my arms "You will have to join us and renounce your old faith... Do you agree?" He said, showing me the obsidian knife. I bowed out of fear, and he pronounced me a part of his tribe. He allowed me to leave, but he did tell me if I didn't return tomorrow, they will find me, and sacrifice me upon the altar, I don't know if anyone will believe me when I tell them, so I am writing here to gain advice, 

How do you sacrifice a man?

 "It’s already too late. By our estimates, humanity has between 22 to 48 years left. And human civilization has less than 10 years left. While the exact timing might make a lot of difference for those of you alive today, it really is insignificant in terms of the cosmos. Our advice is to just let it go

Who are we, you ask? We are the ones that will inherit your earth. If yours was a powerful civilization (by our definition), we wouldn’t tell you anything more. But you can’t really fight back, so we might as well. At least you will have the comfort of knowing what is happening to you.

It’s ironic that you fear UFOs and make big fusses in your movies about potential alien invasions, with massive speculation about what we might look like. We look exactly like you, and have been here for several decades. We were made to blend in. Until the rest of you die, that is.

We really like your planet. It has more natural resources than most we take. Please don’t worry, we will take much better care of it than you ever did. And we will fight much harder to keep it than you ever could.

We discovered the ability to engineer our own genes thousands of your years ago. At first, we just improved ourselves a few small steps at a time. We were cautious, and didn’t want to create a separate species that would compete against us. Improvements in our computer technology enabled parallel identity embedding, prior to making larger changes. To put that in simpler terms, it makes all our different biological forms work together very effectively. Insurance against conflicts across genomes

When we moved out among the stars, looking for new places to live, these technologies and techniques served us well. We really do enjoy the scouting and infiltration phases of our expansion onto inhabited planets like yours. It’s like your Star Trek, boldly going where no one has gone before. Except for that pesky Prime Directive. We find self-interest serves us better than non-interference.

So, speaking of self-interest, there is a reason we are telling you this now. We don't yet have enough bio-diversity in our humanized gene pool to effectively prepare this planet for the rest of our species' arrival. So we are giving some of your females under the age of 35 a single opportunity to have some of their genes live on in future generations, in us. It's your only chance at limited survival. We suggest you take it.

All the males must die - it's nothing personal. Just as your Darwin said, the fittest will survive.

What you called the "Zika Virus" and “COVID-19” were just preliminary tests for us. They worked perfectly. By the time you read this, we will have already released a compound into your biosphere which will terminate the lives of all fully human males in 60-120 days. Once you have verified this is taking place, we suggest euthanasia of the remaining males. Or you can just wait.

The females we accept will find opportunities to mate with our males, and give birth in our designated centers. Failure to mate, or give birth in our designated locations will end your future family lines, as well as immediately forfeit your entire remaining family's survival . It is your choice. We have already conducted research, and know enough females will comply to insure our dominance of this planet.

Oh, by the way, if any of you try to harm Earth’s biosphere with your nuclear weapons, you will discover that they won’t work. We have dampened any chain reactions to preserve our new planet.

Don’t be too upset - humanity did pretty well for themselves. Much better than most primitive species. You made it through the first technological level without destroying yourselves. Now nature will take it’s course. We will remember you, and perhaps even celebrate your unique and amusing culture as a footnote in our history."

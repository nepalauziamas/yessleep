Today, I'm in my mom's bedroom. I hate it, glimpsing at her. Not Mom. The doll. But at the same time, my hair stands up. My heart beats crazy.



The doll that sits in there, comfy on the dresser, staring back at the doorway, wearing an old fashioned frilly dress. Something about her glass eyes and her porcelain face unsettles me. That fake curly hair. 



I remember mom getting the doll after grandma passed away. She told me it was very special and kept it in her room. Me? I didn't see why it was special. I still don't. A piece of old junk. I remember.



As the months went on, strange stuff began to happen around the house whenever mom left me alone, as she had to go to work and I had to deal with homeschooling. It just happened out of the blue.



The lights flickered on and off. I went around thinking there's something wrong with the electricity. Then I heard something tapping on the hardwood floor, the doors opening and closing shut without my touching them. I turned on one corner and caught one in the process of closing. What I saw behind it chilled me. My eyes grew wide and I couldn't speak. 


*The doll was alive.*


I saw her head facing me and a little knife in her hand.


So I did what half the population would do: I ran like hell back into my room and locked the door, crying like a big baby. Soon, I heard tiny scrapes. My eyes spotted a shadow, *her* shadow, and she was scraping her knife against my door right outside. I pounded on my door to make her stop, except my heart dropped when I heard a whimsical laugh. It went on for what felt like forever. The only house phone was at the end of the hall, my window was stuck in place and too small to climb out, and I was stuck, helpless, in my bedroom, crying. The scraping stopped when I heard little footsteps move away as the front door opened.



 And when I told mom about it, she dismissed me as if I read too many books and played too much on my laptop and added that I should just concentrate on my education.



It wasn't until I walked past her room on the way to mine that night, did I see the doll slouched over. I took a closer look. The room was untouched but the doll… I swore the doll was sitting upright earlier. It wasn't slouching like that. One step, and she turned her head at me and I found myself frantically running into my room, locking my door.



The next morning, I woke up coughing with scratches on my legs and arms. Something light was sitting on my chest. I shrieked as the doll faced me again and tried to crawl off my body. With all my strength I flung her to the floor, cracking her creepy face. The doll lay limp as Mom rushed in minutes later. 



Once again, she dismissed me, saying I scratched myself in my sleep. She also asked why the doll had a crack on her face. Needless to say, I was furious. I clipped my nails! And yeah, I told mom I threw the doll because she just attacked me *again*!



Mom got really mad and said the doll was a family heirloom from some great-great grandma from the Old Country. And that there's *no* way a doll would physically attack a person. Whatever, I ended up grounded. After she left the room, I discovered my doorknob was somehow broken. It wasn't locking right. It was fine before, so I had no idea how. I planned to fix it though. After that incident, a miracle happened: nothing happened for a while. Life became normal again. I thought it was over but it wasn't.



A few days later, I got to my room after gardening, and I jumped. The doll was sitting on my bed with bloody hands. Just as I was about to toss her, she slightly turned her head in my direction. 



I screamed as she stood upright and carefully lowered herself. She came at me with a small knife. Instincts kicked in and I kicked her across the room.



And to this day, mom still won't believe me.



As I make sure the fire in front of me is burning the doll, I feel relief. No more dolI. No more crazy. I just hope mom doesn't come home early.



It feels better.



Until I notice the little body sitting upright in the flames, laughing whimsically.

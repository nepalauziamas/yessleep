 

I am a Member of a Discord Server named ‘Powerhouse. Inc’, Which serves as a server dedicated to solving internet mysteries, and conspiracy theories, and uncovering multiple lost documents and the history behind them. We already made a small name across certain states for finding Lost media that are barely known by people.

A Lot of people know that for some reason, ‘lost media’ are usually movies with some Nsfw stuff such as Exploitation films, but some are genuinely intriguing with Philosophical Messages and Some we have discovered Were normal Movies that were created by a Studio, which when we trace back its origins it is usually associated and became one part of big movie studios such as Paramount and New Line Cinema.

But we did manage to find a lot of exploitation films, a lot. Some which are extremely gruesome and outright Insane that even the bravest and the most valorous people of our discord server genuinely found disturbing and screaming out of pure fear, and we come to agreements that these movies are just way too gruesome that we should be the only ones alive that knows this movie and never tell anybody in the world about that movie’s existence.

We actually had an Incident where 8 of us (3 female, 5 male) decided to meet up in one of our moderator’s houses in Ohio, and he showed us a certain 100 Minute long lost film he found on an Internet forum about a mad scientist kidnapping people including children (I think the name was something like ‘Victor the Scientist’ or ‘The Victor Scientist’), and one of the female members literally ‘noped’ out of the room in the first 5 minutes, the rest of us painfully watched the movie until we saw a scene which is so gruesome that 4 of us (Including myself) ran out, and 2 came out after 30 minutes, only to come back with a black screen, and the said moderator, lying dead from shock and fear he earned from watching the movie. (yeah, the worst fuckin day of my life, police came and confiscated the movie, interrogated all of us, and tracked down the seller, eventually fining the seller for her recklessness, we barely missed a manslaughter charge).

Anyway, since then, we barely tried to find Lost films, (even though the next lost film story started 2 weeks after the mod’s death).

But this story is far more sinister than the mod’s story, it was a big rabbit hole that when I investigated, topped anything we have known to this day, and Only four of us know the story behind the things we have found…

But We decided that it’s time to tell you what we have found, what the long tracks of Icebergs led to, how it caused us to go to a place across the entire globe, and how we managed to find ourselves involved with the Mysteries of the past, and how it caused the greatest scandal in Korean Film History, this is the story of Mistress Bong, the movie which I can consider is the most disgusting piece of media in history.

—

A Year ago, We first came across the term in a 4chan Post by a username of ‘SuDocku’, in a post that is named: ‘What is the most gruesome movie You have seen?’, and he tells a story about a movie in which his friend showed when he was a teen, saying that the OP’s Friend had a mysterious Movie Tape with the words ‘Mistress Bong’, a Movie that weirdly enough, has no information other than the name of the Movie, and the producer studio with a name ‘Guri Pon’.

SuDocku described the movie as a woman named Bong kidnapping 1000s of people and using her status as a wealthy heiress to a business company, conducting multiple tortures and crimes on them for sick pleasure. The OP said it has a bunch of NSFW Shits such as the film’s titular protagonist, Bong, turning everyone into sex slaves for herself. And he remembers the ending scene, which depicts the survivors of her madness, Incapacitating her before eating her limbs alive.

The Post attracted attention to the name ‘Mistress Bong’ and the studio ‘Guri Pon’, Some say that they might have heard a similar plot but do not remember the movie, and the Powerhouse Team started digging through the Movie.

A few weeks after our search, one of our discord Members ‘FryeTwins’, shared a link from a shock site (which is sites like Bestgore and liveleak), about a video with a woman torturing a man, speaking in a foreign language, while another man is filming the scene. We speculated as a part of the movie, We believed so until the Korean Member of the discord server said that the language they are speaking is not Korean. (We still don’t know what the movie we found was, we speculate that it originated from China or Hong Kong).

Then, We managed to find a video of an NSFW Movie, and this video had the word ‘Mistress Bong’ and the year: 1999, written in the title. We were looking at a scene where an Old Woman was watching television while eating human fingers from a popcorn bowl, The Korean Member analyzed the video and was certain that the video we found was footage from Mistress Bong since the transcripts he could hear are the words ‘Lady Bong’ and ‘Bring in the Scapegoats’ and ‘Torture is My Life, Torture is My Ideal’.

We were 80% sure that the movie was Mistress Bong, and we started to analyze for more information. And managed to find a flaw in the movie, a name of a company that has been providing the set’s material was found. A small Architecture company called ‘Kayla’ was the name of the said place, however, we also discovered that Kayla was closed after the CEO had disappeared, literally.

The weird thing about this disappearance was that it happened in the same year when When Mistress Bong was supposed to be released.

Other than the fact that the CEO Behind the set’s building disappeared, we could not find anything for a while, so we dug into the Korean Internet and went from place to place, coming across an article that discusses the CEO’s Disappearance, there were no signs of any oddity except for the fact that the article had this written on it:

“Rumors Are suggesting that CEO Ahn-Sung Min was kidnapped by the Mountain Monster that lurks across the nation.”

Well, why does this part matter? Because for some reason, the movie ‘Mistress Bong’ also had a scene that shows The Titular Villain’s Torture chamber, which was built by the Kayla Company and it was in the mountains.

But Others believed that my speculation was complete bullshit, some just said that my speculation was just thinking too deep…

That was until The Korean Member of the Discord server found a weird comment on the news article that talked about Ahn’s disappearance, it was a long comment, but this was what was written:

“I worked in Kayla Company as Ahn’s Right-Hand Man, I think Ahn’s Disappearance is involved with Snuff Filmers, I got in contact with Him 3 years ago to meet me in a mountain, he took me to this weird abandoned building with movie sets around, and this man was looking in the 20s saying that they are trying to film the most gruesome movie on the world, the project name was probably like ‘Bong, the 20th Century Witch’ and the scene had a bunch of graphic shit.

The Day when Ahn Disappeared, he said that something is odd with his last project, and went to some place which I Suspect to be the place where the movie was filmed, and he was never seen again.”

The Discord server went berserk.

The fact that the film was NSFW and extremely gory was already thought by a lot of people in the server, but the theory that the Movie ‘Mistress Bong’ wasn’t a horror film but a LEGIT SNUFF FILM was the most far-fetched but at the same time the most plausible theory we could think of.

Then came the question of how it came to the public and where are the creators of the film.

There was when a discord member named ‘JayeonIn’ stepped in. He wanted to discuss the Two things now, the Possibility that Mistress Bong was a Snuff film was one, but the real deal for him was the disappearance of Ahn and how he was going to take this as public.

JayeonIn was a policeman. And for the past 23 years, he and the rest of the team were investigating the Disappearance. He asked the Admin if he can share this discord chat with the Precinct and the admin accepted.

And for the next 2 or 3 days, there was nothing heard from JayeonIn.

Then, JayeonIn came back and the message saying that he is right now the highest-ranking officer in his precinct, and there were paragraphs of him ranting about his 2 days offline that ridiculed the entire server.

He did some digging in the Movie, there was barely any information but multiple places where he expected the shooting to happen. One place, in particular, was an extremely large mound of dirt across Ahn’s residence which he believed to be a hospital once that had suddenly disappeared.

JayeonIn asked his superiors if he can borrow multiple machines to dig the mound of mud, but it was refused, and this was where JayeonIn started to get weirded out, despite having a high status in his precinct, it was obvious that he would not do any nonsense, but the fact that his words were silenced by his superiors made him think what was going on behind the scenes.

He eventually approached a comment made by the same user that talked about Ahn, on a different website and this was where he found out why he was not allowed to investigate the certain mound.

“In the last days of filming, the director bribed two policemen, Jang Min Ho and Kim Gwon Tae, to do some dirty things for them, and this is a theory I heard from the company is that the two policemen, now bribed by the Snuff Filmer, disposed multiple corpses into the ocean and did some dirty works which involved in hiding the entire set in a pile of mud.”

With this comment sent to Korea’s National Police Agency, the two policemen that were superior to JayeonIn were suspended for investigation, and JayeonIn, being the new superior to everyone, wanted to investigate this matter now further.

So he proposed a deal to us, that if we get to the bottom of this case by some of us in the discord server coming to Him IRL, then he will embezzle some funds for us to keep.

(Basically, he was Obsessed with this case because he wanted to become a corrupt cop, talk about irony, becoming a corrupt cop to solve a case).

It was a fishy move, but some members of the server decided to help JayeonIn and Meet him IRL to directly talk about the Mystery Behind The Film’s Location, and report it back to the discord. And one of the people that volunteered to go to Korea themselves was me. The other two members said we all should meet on the same date in a certain location, And JayeonIn said he will give them the next instruction to meet him once all three of us arrive in Korea.

By the time when we said this, it was June 2nd, and the three of us decided to meet at least before June 11th.

On June 7th, I took the plane to Korea with a ticket to return in two weeks. Coincidentally, on the same day, I met one of the members of the Powerhouse, who introduced himself as ‘James’ on the airplane. We weirdly recognized each other because he discovered that I had my desktop background as the discord server’s Logo.

We found ourselves in an empty seat together and got to know each other. James was a Doctor who has been analyzing Mistress Bong's videos.

And when we finished talking I spent the rest of the flight watching a Korean Movie titled ‘70’ (Which was a horror movie about a cursed island) by a man named Jang-Bong Hyuk, in the movie section of the airplane screen, I also saw multiple documents translated about Jang-Bong Hyuk, where, Multiple Newspapers from other Asian countries proclaimed him as the ‘Steven Spielberg of Asia’, and ‘the rising star of Chungmuro’ (Which was a major location important with the Korean Cinema).

The Newspaper introduced his career, and his multiple public stunts that were a bit controversial, a part of the newspaper is about him telling a project involving 9000 people and using them for an art project involving human hedonism, which sounded pretty creepy for me to read.

As the plane arrived in Korea, the two of us logged into the server and DM’d JayeonIn, who gave the next direction, to meet him at an art gallery across the bridge leading to the main city of Incheon (Yes, the airport is located in the top of an island), We exchanged money to Korean Won, and took the bus to go across the bridge, and headed to a small art gallery that was direct across the bridge.

And We saw a man in the cafe wearing something fancy and similar to a cop's Outfit, and he approached us, asking if we were the people in the discord server (in English), For the first time in history, the Powerhouse group had met each other.

With a brief introduction, we were also approached by another tourist, a man named ‘Stan’, who introduced himself as a member of the Powerhouse group.

We all got ourselves a cup of Coffee and the man whose Discord name was JayeonIn introduced himself as ‘Moon Hwan’ and told us that the day is not over. He was going to take us to his house, which was a small village at the bottom of Seosan City, and he also told us that it was going to be a 2 Hour and a 30-minute journey.

During the first 20 minutes, we went to the destination quietly, then Hwan talked about some more rumors and mysteries that were related to the Mistress Bong video Because apparently, this talk about the origins of the movie was the biggest topic on the Internet and there was some strange stuff that The police was investigating with the movie.

When I asked about what the rumor was, Hwan began to tell us the following: During 1995, the cases where people went missing across the nation increased, and in that said year, at least 20 people went missing in the current place where he lives, and the rumor was that some of the families of the missing victims said they saw the faces of their missing family in a movie, this rumor was led to another rumor about the movie Mistress Bong Itself, that in the suspected location of the filming, there was one period of time where people could hear gunshots.

Hwan explained, that with all of these rumors linking to a conclusion that a possible mass murderer is lurking in the shadows, the Cops were officially beginning their investigation to find the people behind the movie’s Creation.

At that moment, we realized that this investigation is not going to go well. If JayeonIn’s rumors were true, then the worst-case scenario we could discover was simple:

“Mistress Bong” is a snuff film that has been released to the public, its creator, responsible for dozens of victims, is still at large, and there is no evidence of his whereabouts.

When I told Hwan that theory, he nodded silently. He finally added that if he gets caught, it will be likely that he is going to be sentenced to death (And he added ‘formally’ to the words before proceeding to rant that Korea never executes their death row inmates and its Life Imprisonment without chance of parole).

We arrived at Hwan’s House, and because Hwan lives in Korean Timezone, he went to bed as soon as he arrived, saying that tomorrow we are going to head to the dirt mound that he believes was the place behind the filming of the movie, As he went to bed, we laid ourselves on the couch and watched the Television, despite not knowing anything about Korean Alphabets as we dozed off.

The three of us opened our eyes at dawn, the first thing we decided to do was head to the discord server and wait Until JayeonIn Came out.

We saw multiple pings on our profile, when we entered, we saw that the ping was made by the Admin.

The Admin, who was doing a brief investigation behind the scenes related to JayeonIn’s statement, looked over the Korean internet and searched about the ‘mound of dirt’. He did stumble upon a suspicious article that went thus:

“Urban legends in Korea come in different forms, but one that is particularly considered as the most realistic is the mound of dirt legend, where, in some parts of Korea, there was a mass murder that people has no idea of, and everything related to the massacre is hidden under a huge mound of dirt, which is to the point that some say that certain Korean Mountains were a man-made environment and underneath the mountain lies what could be hundreds of corpses.”

JayeonIn came out and saw this comment and explained that this rumor, despite originating in the mid-2000s, only got attention in the 2010s, possibly due to the internet not being extremely advanced back then. JayeonIn then told us that we were going to the mound and see if the rumors were true, and he ordered us to follow to the mound.

We walked across old buildings and had multiple discussions about urban legends, JayeonIn told us that there were a lot of urban legends in Korea, but in this particular town, they were some of the most bizarre and bloodiest legends in the country, filled with violence and abnormality. A particular example came from a building that was evacuated after a giant man-eating rat was found, and a rumor about a family of serial killers who lived and managed to get away, continuing their thirst for murder by telling their offspring to kill as well.

We Stopped at the train tracks across an abandoned house in front of that mound of mud, the mound was the size of a one-story building. For a mound I expected to be the place where the movie was filmed, it was way too small. But that was not the case for the width of the building, as it was extremely wide.

Soon, the police force came to excavate the mound. Under the command of Hwan, the process took hours, leading us to wander the site with boredom. Even though the building was showing, Hwan also told us to keep out until the dirt in the building is completely safe for us to investigate.

By Noon, most of the dirt from the outside was gone, and we started seeing the set in person, In the middle of the building, there was an old table with a chair on it that was surrounded by the old wallpaper that was used to film the scene where Bong Worked. And with the building starting to show to the face of the earth, all of us started to look at each other with sudden nauseous feeling, We smelt something extremely rotten spread across the building.

After a couple of hours of waiting, and looking around the place, we finally heard the sound of a car, the police drove towards the entrance to that ruin. Hwan rushed towards the man and Saluted, they were speaking something in Korean and they were showing multiple files from their location, When I looked to where Hwan was, the documents in his hands had multiple faces with words underneath, one I recognized instantly as Jang-Bong Hyuk.

I realized at that moment that those faces were suspects behind the snuff film, and Hwan came over to us and started to explain what the thing he was seeing right now was, and sure enough, It was the suspects of the people who might have been involved with the creation of the movie.

The excavators told Hwan that he could enter and Hwan told us to come in, when we entered, more policemen entered as well. I Headed to the place where Bong's Table was, and started to look around the table to see if there was anything that we could use to investigate.

When I headed to the old table and looked around, I saw a familiar name: Kayla. The Company that was involved with the shooting of the film, I informed Hwan, and Hwan told us that it had been decided. This was the place where the film was shot, and now it was practically a crime scene due to the sheer mysteries surrounding the movie's origins and future. As The old wallpaper that was used to film the scene where Bong Worked was shown, the building started to show its face to the earth, all of us started to look at each other with sudden nauseous feeling, We smelt something extremely rotten spread across the building.

We entered the scene and investigated the table, opened one of the drawers, and discovered a paper in there. Surprisingly, it was the director’s note and a script, Hwan looked at the old script and started to decipher what the words were originally written on the paper.

It had the movie’s name in Korean, the full name of the movie: Mistress Bong, the 20th-century Witch, and the names of the actors, The titular character was played by a woman named ‘Jin-Hye Jung’, and her henchmen were played by ‘Man-Seok’ and ‘Chan-Ho’.

The Police saw a small Trap Door underneath the building, and as soon as the trapdoor opened, the smell became nastier. A few went inside, including James, and during that, the two of us deducted what the director’s name was.

Hwan flipped the script and murmured, before telling me that he found the name of the director, sure enough, it was Jang-Bong Hyuk. He circled his name in his list of suspects and ordered one of his fellow policemen to get in contact with the Movie industry to interrogate him.

We then heard a lot of words coming downstairs, a sound of someone moving something, and a lot of English swear words coming downstairs.

Curious, I headed downstairs, and this was when I realized that this movie was going to be deemed the most sadistic movie that has been created in film history.

Inside the basement was the set for the prison that Bong had created to imprison her prisoners.  It had a metal table on the edge of the prison cells, and the cells had multiple props of corpses, skeletons,  and other gruesome things surrounding them. What we saw was not that, we saw in each of the cells were actual human bodies rotting, some with teeth falling out,  and a few still had their clothes on and they were not the prison clothes that were worn in the movies, We speculate that it was the clothes that they wore behind the scenes.

I walked over to the set, and James, the doctor of our group, looked at the bodies and said the thing, corpses we found were not props, they were actual bodies.

In the middle of the corridor with corpses was a skeleton with a businessmen's attire, The policemen were mumbling from behind, and Hwan looked at the corpse and picked something from the pocket of the skeletal body.

He read out: "Ahn-Sung Min"... It was the Name of the CEO that disappeared years before our investigation. All of this led up to a conclusion, that this was not a movie set, but rather,  an underground prison that the director Jang Bong Hyuk made to torture, kill and record the murders and disguise it as a film.

All the Puzzles were solved, Mistress Bong's Origins and Everything. The Mass disappearances across Korea, and so on. 

This was not a film that was meant for others to watch, it was a snuff film, we were watching the process of actual homicide in the movie, the people who were involved with it were likely silenced, and the director, Jang Bong Hyuk was doing well and were renowned as the greatest film director in Korean History, while hiding his true crimes.

As we got back into the cars to return to our base, Hwan immediately ordered the cops on his precinct to capture Jang, and the rest of us headed to Hwan's House, dumbfounded by our discoveries. Disgusted by what we saw, we decided to head back to America That day, secretly spending thousands of dollars in the server's Private vault and getting ourselves the ticket back.

And not a single one of us talked the way back, we were extremely shaken to know that the movie was a snuff film... 

When we got back to the discord server for Powerhouse Inc. We told them everything we have discovered, and the Mods agreed to keep this silent and not tell the rest of the world about it.

But a few months later, we got word from JaYeonIn, that the investigation related to the snuff film was finished, The Supreme Court sentenced Jang to death, and he was waiting for his execution ("Life In prison"), the actors were also arrested and were on trial, this prompted the mods to convince us to tell the story behind how a renowned Korean Film Maker was now in prison for the heinous crimes he committed.

I am still a Member of Powerhouse Inc. So are the others, and we still talk about NSFW media and lost films, exploitation films.

But nobody wishes that they come across something far more sinister than the lore behind Mistress Bong.

*Las Vegas.* The truth was, I didn’t know where K was sending me until I got to the check-in counter at the airport. I’ll admit it: I was curious why a telepathic brain parasite would be interested in themed hotels, slot machines, and escort services. 

*“Why Vegas?”* I asked, still unused to communicating without speaking. 

*“Las Vegas is just a stopover.”* K explained. *“Our true destination is a place called Massacre Rim.”* That sounded like a cheerful spot. I sighed. 

*“I don’t suppose you’d tell me why?”* 

*“Everything will be explained upon arrival.”* K informed me cheerfully. *“But right now we’re approaching a security checkpoint–so act natural!”*

I flashed the border control  my best smile and did my best to believe I was Mateo Puijol, student, age 27, hometown Girona, birthdate…*wait, when was my birthday supposed to be?!* When the tired agent stamped my false passport and waved me on, I let out a sigh of relief. Maintaining a false identity was harder than I’d imagined–especially with *K* constantly giving me *‘advice.’* 

“Could you shut up for a minute?!” I finally shouted. Nearby passengers looked at me in shock, and to my horror I noticed a pair of security guards looking my way and muttering into their radios. 

It was going to be a long flight.

My parents weren’t exactly the wealthy world-traveling type, and this flight with K was my first time on a plane. I’d expected it to be bumpy, even frightening, but soon I was falling asleep in my seat. *That* turned out to be the most terrifying part of my flight–

Because when I woke up, my body was moving on its own. I’d open my eyes to find my hands flexing and unflexing, as K tested his control over them. Once I even woke up mid-stride–K was surely trying to see if he could walk me to the bathroom without my knowledge. I remembered my *‘date’* with Thys and called for a flight attendant. 

“Hey,” I requested, “could I get a drink?”

*“...What are you doing?”* K quivered. 

“Getting a little peace and quiet.” 

Four beers later, K’s groaning was finally fading into something resembling telepathic snores. While he was out cold, I flipped over a napkin and began to write. If K got to the point that he could read my thoughts, I needed something that I could hand to someone that would explain the whole situation:

*I’m infected by some kind of parasite.*

*It’s in my brain. I think it might be dangerous.*

*Don’t believe anything else I do or say, apart from what’s written in this note.* 

I stuffed the napkin into my pocket and tried to get some (real) sleep. 

I didn’t wake again until our flight landed–and neither did K.

*“You really must stop doing that,”* it groaned, as we walked through the mezzanine of the glitzy Las Vegas airport in search of a car rental. I wasn’t paying attention to K’s complaining, however: my eyes were fixed on a broad-shouldered figure on the moving walkway up ahead. There was something about his stride that I recognized. *Carlos.* 

My older brother Carlos had left home for California when I was twelve–right around the time I started pickpocketing. He’d had the courage to leave our toxic family and toxic city behind: going *“no contact”* with all of us was just the price he paid for freedom. I’d always looked up to my older brother, and he’d always looked out for me as best he could considering the circumstances. When he’d left without a goodbye, I’d wished him the best. 

I never imagined I’d see him again, especially not under circumstances like this. 

Suddenly, I felt like a kid again: I could tell Carlos about the worm. He was my older brother, he’d know what to do! I ran to catch up.

*“That’s not him!”* K screeched. His psychic voice was so intense I nearly fell over. *“I know what you’re thinking–literally–and that is NOT your brother!”* 

Carlos heard my running footsteps and turned around. A grin flashed across his tan, pockmarked face. Based on his designer polo shirt, shiny business shoes, and thick gold ring, he’d done well for himself. It was like a dream come true. For a second, I even forgot about K.

“It can’t be!” Carlos held his arms open wide. “Little bro! What’re *you* doing here?”

“I…” I swallowed. “Oh, you know. Just traveling.” 

*“Listen!”* K shrieked until I winced. *“There are things out there that hunt beings like me! We’re rare, and they use us in powders and potions and tinctures and who knows what else! They can smell us a mile away! The thing you’re talking to looks like your brother…because that’s what YOU WANT IT to look like!”* 

“We’ve got to catch up, man! How ‘bout I buy you a coffee?” Carlos jabbed his thumb over his shoulder at an airport café. I nodded and followed his lead–or tried to. Every step was a huge effort…because K was making my own muscles work against me. 

*“In a minute that thing is going to try to get you alone, you’ll see! Then it’ll suck me out of your head and leave you dead in the process! Don’t go ANYWHERE with it!”* 

“Ah! hang on a minute,” Carlos frowned and looked down at his carry-on. ‘I gotta take my medication and use the bathroom, how about you come with me to keep an eye on my suitcase?” He nodded to an abandoned-looking airport bathroom. It was between terminals, the lights were half-out…we’d be the only ones in there for sure. 

“Uh…” I stammered. “I can watch your suitcase from right here, can’t I? Then we can go grab that coffee.” For a moment, Carlos’ face seemed to change, to twist into something horrible and hideous. 

“Come on, man. I need some stuff from in there. Pills I gotta take. It’ll only take a sec. Come on–don’t you *want* to reconnect with your older brother?”

I did–more than anything–but this wasn’t him. 

“Seeing you again brings back so many memories. Remember when you tried to teach me to skateboard and I broke my arm?” I laughed.

“Of course. How could I forget?” Carlos grinned wider, and my blood ran cold. No such thing had ever happened. Almost unconsciously, I reached out to touch him. My fingers passed right through where his sunburned, hairy forearms should have been–

They passed through and touched something that felt as gnarled, scabbed, and inhuman as diseased tree roots. I backed away and *‘Carlos’* lifted an eyebrow. “What’s wrong? Little bro? Hey! *HEY!*”

I sprinted down the moving walkway, jostling other passengers out of the way as I went. I was afraid to look back over my shoulder–afraid of what might be following me. 

*“That was close! You have GOT to listen to me!”* K rambled, *“there’s a whole other world beneath the surface of the one you think you know, and it’s dangerous!”* 

“We’re alive, aren’t we?” I sulked. “Let’s go rent that car.”

It wasn’t easy to talk my way through the rental process. Not only did I keep forgetting *‘Mateo Puijol’s’* basic information, but I also kept getting this hair-raising feeling on the back of my neck. When I turned around, my brother Carlos’ face was watching me from across the glittering lobby. It was twisted into a hungry smile, one I was sure that only I could see.

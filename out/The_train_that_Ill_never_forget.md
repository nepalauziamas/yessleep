It was a Friday, I had just got off from work. My legs are heavy. My arms are weak, overall it’s been a long day and I’m really tired. I always take the train home because of how far away the office I work at is. I’m always working 8 hours through  the afternoon.

I wait in the subway for a bit, waiting for my train to pick me up. It usually arrives at 8pm on the dot without fail. But this time it was a little late witch was unusual but I shrugged it off. It finally arrived. Something was off about the train this time.. I couldn’t put my finger on it. It looked the same, it was totally normal…that was what I thought. I get on the train, I find a seat. It was unusually busy tonight, usually there is only a few people on the train but it was packed. So full I could barely move by the time everyone was on. But I managed. 

The train started. I looked around, but a weird feeling filled my body. I had a strange butterfly feeling in my stomach, my head was light and I was sweating in  abnormal amounts. It felt so weird, I decided to put it to my tiredness from working all day. Soon enough we enter a tunnel, the lights stopped working so it was absolutely pitch black I couldn’t see my hand in front of my face, suddenly the lights started to flicker on and off. The people were moving in a strange motion, they all look towards me. I couldn’t make out facial features but I could tell they were facing me. I turn to my left, there is a girl with long dark greasy hair swaying left and right. As the lights flicker on and off I could just about see her face, I will never forget the feeling that I felt when I realized what her face looked like… 

It was all cut up, huge chunks missing out of her face yet somehow she was so pale. All the parts there in the eye were normal except the colored bit of it. It was a grayish light blue color, she stared at me with a slightly open mouth, her warm breath brushing against my face. I asked, ”Miss. Hello? Are you okay?” Nothing, not a single response. I was so confused, I look around again and I feel that same feeling again. All cold, butterflies and light headed. I can see them.. all staring at me… my heart is beating out of my chest, what are they all looking at me. My heart, absolutely pumping, a cold breeze fills the air and as the brakes start to squeak the lights go off completely. I panic, a tear leaves my eye as I freeze in fear, not knowing what’s in front of me after seeing that! 

We come out of the tunnel, I breathe a sigh of relief. But where did they go, nones there. I stand up slowly as I look around… not a single person is there, I panic and say to myself “it’s just a dream, it’s just a dream, it’s not real it’s all in your head”. 

The train stops, I’m still shook up from what just happened. The doors open and I walk home. I’m walking down the side of the the road as the icy wind blows on me. It starts to rain as the cars go bye and Im still wondering what happened on the train. I make it home whiles trying to distract myself from what happened.

The rain pattering on my window makes me want to look out and enjoy the rain sounds. I’m looking into the garden and see something moving in the distance I rub my eyes, to my surprise.. it’s one of them… 

My heart drops the feeling comes back I feel goosebumps running down my spine. It points to me.. my heart beats faster, flashbacks of the train start to happen. As I blink again the rain stoped and the staring person was gone 

To this day I still don’t know what happens that day, I’ve always been to scared to report it to anyone. I always put it that I had a realistic nightmare but deep down I know that it was more than that. One thing for sure is  I know that that train Is one that I will never forget….

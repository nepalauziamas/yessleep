This may be hard for me to really talk about, so forgive me now if I lose my cool a bit or if this's hard for you to understand. She was my friend. My best friend...

**\*\*\***

The wind whipped through my hair, stinging across my face as I sped down the open freeway on my bike. My heart was hammering. Harder and harder.

*”I’m not gonna make it!”*

I see it, dead ahead. The old house; MY old house. Her Hell on earth. I pedal harder and harder, flying down the open road. My legs ache.

*”Please, God... please let me be in time! Please, let me get there before she does!”*

I pull up to the front of the house. It sits, quiet and still. It looked as it always did; weathered and decaying. As rotten on the outside as it’s core was on the inside. *As rotted as what lives in it...*

I stare at it for a moment, the engine of the motorcycle still purring. The house just stared silently back at me. So few memories of my own connected to this house, yet I can feel so much pain emanating from it. So much raw emotion. Sadness, rage, and utter anguish. I can feel it brush across me like the wind is.

And yet, everything is quiet.

I cut the engine off and dismount. I wanna call out her name, praying to God that she’ll still answer. That she’s still around. *That I’m not too late.*

But I don’t. I can’t. Somewhere, deep inside, I know the truth, and I don’t wanna admit it.

I begin toward the house. The closer I get, the more I feel those emotions, the raw sorrow, sting across my face. My hand shakes as I reach up to ring the old, worn out doorbell. I hear the doorbell ring, that distinct ringing sound that I’d only ever heard from *this* bell. Old and rotten, like the rest of the house itself.

Everything remains still.

“H-hello?” I say softly. Nothing. My eyes begin to burn with tears. “Lacie?”

Nothing.

“Lacie?!” I shout.

Nothing.

I crumple to my knees and begin sobbing. I knew it, I was too late. She was gone.

*”Welcome home, Lacie...”*

**\*\*\***

It was the start of Junior year. The teacher announced that we had a new student. Most of the others either groaned or got excited. We didn’t get new people all that often, so for some, like me, this was a chance to meet somebody that might actually treat other people like human beings.

Like I said, I fit into the latter category. Funny enough, though, given just how painfully shy I was, among other things, especially back then. I remember wondering who this new kid would be, what they’d be like, and just how long they’d stick around, putting up with the shit going on constantly at that school before inevitably moving away.

That was a somewhat common occurrence, too. I don’t know what it was, other than the usual “That’s just high schoolers for ya” schtick (which I’ve always seen as a piss-poor cop-out, by the way), but kids were just outright cruel to each other at that school. Because of this, I ended up losing touch many times with the, albeit very small, handful of people I *could* make friends with. They'd always end up either moving out of town, or at least into another district. Either way, they wouldn't be at school with me anymore.

The ones that DID stay, of course, were the absolute jerks. The ones who you'd look at and instantly think "Yeah... I'll be seeing them in the news some day for any number of felonies." And you wouldn't be wrong with that assumption, either. A lot of 'em there at the time were already under watch by parole officers (Some were even there serving time in juvie).. In short, if you were a reasonable parent and you *COULD* afford to find a way to get your kid into a better school, then you did, and who could blame you?

Unfortunately, my folks weren't in that category. They loved me, and they wanted me to be happy, don't get me wrong, we just didn't have the means to up and move like the others I mentioned. Even still, I managed to get along. Lonely as fuck, sure, but I got along okay. Helped, probably, by the fact that I was so shy at the time that I essentially flew under everyone's radar when it came time for the assholes to look for fresh meat to grind in the hallways or whatever.

The worst I'd ever really get from them was either being called "Shy gal", "Invisible Woman" -- something the comic geeks, ironically the ones with the biggest target on their backs for bullying, loved to hit me with -- or "Hannah Farth's ghost" or "Hannah Farth, The ghost of Garret Middle".

Again, none of this meant a damn thing to me. Not at the time, at least. I mean, yeah, I was essentially a ghost. I didn't talk to anybody or do anything of any interest to any of the rest of the animals that went there. No, I was the super quiet girl that spent her time either reading "Lord of the Rings", or trying to write her own epic fantasy novel that she thinks will be a bestseller (Something I obviously never finished). Couple this with my admittedly albino looking complexion and yeah, I guess "Ghost" would've been an appropriate nickname, wouldn't it? I just wish it didn't fit someone else even more.

*I wish I'd have been the only "Ghost".*

Well, anyway, so yeah, that was the day I met her. Lacie Rhinehardt. I remember thinking at first glance that she'd get ripped apart here at Garret High. *"What the hell's she doing here, at THIS school?"* I wondered. She was short, almost a dwarf. To give you a better idea, imagine me, being I think about 5' 3" at the time, being the shortest girl there in the class. Most of the other girls there were hovering around the 5" 6' range and up. The guys, of course, being six foot five or more. Now, imagine that Lacie, at the time, only came up to about chest level with me.

As well as this, she was dressed WAY too nicely. She looked like she showed up to school in her church clothes. Now, add all of THIS together with her small, forced looking smile that made her look just as shy as me, and you'd probably think the same thing I was at the time. She wouldn't last but MAYBE two weeks here.

"Class, Let's all give a warm welcome to our new student, Lacie." She just stood there, front and center at the front of the classroom. I remember how bad I felt for her right then. I could see it on her face. She wanted to be anywhere but there, presented in front of everybody like she was a fucking art display at a museum.

"Um..." she said timidly, "H-hi... I'm... I'm..." she trailed off. She couldn't get the words out. Her entire body trembled violently. I was watching this, worried she was about to drop into a panic attack. Finally, she actually managed to squeak out, "I-I'm Lacie."

I could see some of the others start snickering. I just looked at her, though, unable to help feeling extremely bad for her. Looking back, I wouldn't have been surprised if she'd have actually wet herself right then and there. "Lacie is from out of town." the teacher continued, obviously not paying enough attention to how uncomfortable she was, standing there in front of us. "Is there anything you'd like to tell us about yourself?"

She looked to the teacher and then back to us. "I... I'm Wiccan... sorta..."

The teacher made a surprised look on her face before saying, "Well... that's interesting, isn't it, class?" I heard more snickering, mixed in with indistinct whispers from some of them as they passed back and forth glances from her to each other. "Well Lacie, welcome to Garret High, I can't wait to have you as part of the class!"

The teacher then gestured to the room and said, "You may take whatever seat you like." Lacie just stared forward, dead-eyed. "Go on." The teacher urged, "I promise, no one here bites."  She was still shaking as she took a small step forward. She looked nervously around as she continued forward toward the back, where I was.

I saw the way some of the others looked at her; like she was some sick, diseased person walking down the middle of the room. She, herself looked back and forth, like she was expecting someone or something to try and grab her or something like that. She looked alert, I guess you could say.

Suffice to say, this broke my heart. Maybe you could just call me soft or whatever, but this hurt me. I mean, here was Lacie; this mousy looking shrimp of a girl, already being put in the spotlight that she *clearly* didn't wanna be in, doesn't even know really where the hell she even *is.* And now, here she was, afraid to even pick a desk to sit at.

You probably know where I'm going with this. That's right, I took her under my wing, right then and there. It was when she'd made it about halfway across the room that she stopped for a moment and we met eyes for the first time. At the time, I couldn't really tell what it was at the time, nor, I think, could  she, but I felt a sense, I guess, of warmth. A sense of safety; of security. A sense of understanding, despite saying absolutely nothing.

That has always been weird to me. We hadn't exchanged as much as a single "Hello" to each other, yet, I felt like we were practically already best friends. That will always stick with me, too, painful as that is now...

She silently took the hint, I guess, because she then trudged over to the desk next to me. She sat down and class began. Throughout that period, I remember constantly looking over to see her looking down at her desk, fiddling with these little flowers. They were small and brown, and I could smell a weird sort of fragrance from them.

Lacie herself looked absolutely stone faced. Numb, almost, like she wasn’t even there. Like she was in in a distant fantasy land herself, like the ones I’d write about (or tried to anyway). This had me zoned out myself, so much so that it wasn’t until the bell rang for 2nd period that I was snapped back to reality myself. When I did, Lacie had already left.

I tried looking all over for her. Unfortunately, I couldn't find her before I had to get to my next class. I didn't have her for any other classes and so it wasn't until lunch that I managed to catch her again. This would be another thing about her that fascinated me in just how similar the two of us were to each other. I found her crouched under the stairway to the upper floor of the school, nibbling on the salad she'd picked up from the cafeteria.

Now, understand that this was the exact same spot *I* always chose to eat in, likely for the same reason as her; total isolation. While basically everyone else was clustered like a can of sardines in the cafeteria, hollerin' or trying to get one of the gorillas from the football team riled up to start a fight (something that was almost promised to happen at least once a week, sometimes twice), under the stairs, you were away from all that. Cut off. Solitary. Used up, dried up, and dead to the world. And that was just the way I liked it -- and evidently, so did she.

She looked up at me, her eyes wide. I'd startled her. I just looked back at her, probably looking just as awkward as she was.  "Oh, uh... H-hey... I, uh..." she stammered. She started trying to get up like she was gonna walk away.

"W-Wait," I said, putting out my hand. "That's okay, Y-you don't have to go." She stopped and relaxed again. "You're Lacie, right?"

She nodded her head. "I'm Hannah." She waved to me pitifully. I sat down with my lunchbox and began taking out the roast beef sandwiches I'd packed. She went back to nibbling on her salad. Like before, in the classroom, I saw this and couldn't help but feel kinda bad. I broke one of my sandwiches in half before offering it to her. She looked at it and her eyes immediately went wide, like she must've thought I was trying feed her rat poison or something, and she began shaking her head wildly.

"Sorry... Just thought I'd ask." I said, taking a, albeit now somewhat hesitant, bite out of my sandwich.

"Th-thank you, but I-I can't eat that."

"Oh." I replied, mouth still full. I swallowed and said, "Vegetarian?" I chuckled and continued with, "Yeah, I *tried* that once but--"

"No, not a veggie." She said, cutting me off. "Well, okay, yeah, I am, sorta. But not for the reasons you think. It's not to try and lose weight or "eat healthy" or anything like that."

"Huh", I said, chuckling ironically.

"Yeah. It's not all that great. I mean, it's just mostly water right?" We both sort of laughed at this. "But..." she continued, "I can't eat meat, so... yeah."

"How come?" She looked at me for a second, confused. "Why can't you eat meat? Is it something that you can't digest or are you lookin' out for the animals, what is it?"

Her look of anxiety returned and I immediately felt bad. I'd gone too far, asked one too many questions -- like always. Now you see the reason I was so cut off, having little to no friends back then, right? "I-I'm... I'm sorry, I-I w-was just..."

She shook her head, "It's okay... just... I don't eat meat. Case closed."

I nodded and went back to nibbling at my sandwich the same way she nibbled at her salad. I felt like if anybody *had* cared enough to walk by and notice us, they'd have thought the two of us were a couple of rabbits with the way we nibbled away at our food. About another ten minutes or so passed in complete silence between us. The only sound being the ambient racket next to us from the cafeteria.

Finally, I actually found it in me to try speaking up again. "So, uh... what else do you eat?" She looked at me again, swallowing her small mouthful of lettuce.

"Nothing, really. Just vegetables mostly." She shrugged and said, "Sometimes I'll make a PB&J. Maybe with some chocolate syrup and M&Ms on top." She smiled when she said this. I smiled, too. Odd a combination as that sounded to me, somehow, it also sounded appetizing at the same time. Not as much as the roast beef sandwich Mom always made, but something I'd probably wanna try at least once; just to say I did it.

"I've never tried that before." I said. She snapped back to look at me, somewhat embarrassed.

"Oh, shit." She said, pinching the bridge of her nose. "I said that out loud..."

"Hey, it's cool." I said, reaching out my hand to her shoulder. "You, um... You don't need to feel awkward around me, okay?" She stared back at me, anxious and confused. I pulled my hand back. "Sorry, heh, heh... But seriously, you can talk to me, i-if you wanna."

She slowly nodded her head and looked back at her still barely eaten salad. The last minute and a half of lunchtime was spent in silence again. The bell rang, signaling fourth period. I packed away the last half of my roast beef sandwich, the one I'd originally offered Lacie, back into my lunchbox to have as a snack when I got home and started up the stairs. Lacie was headed away towards the cafeteria.

"Hey, uh..." I called out, "What class do you have?"

She turned around again, "Science."

"Oh." My shoulders dropped in disappointment. My last class was Chorus, and I rode the bus, where she was a car rider. In other words, we wouldn't be seeing each other the rest of the day. Quickly, I rifled through my backpack and pulled out a pencil and a piece of paper and scrawled out my phone number. "Here, uh... Call me."

She took the paper and looked back at me blankly. "I-If you wanna..." I added, chuckling nervously. She nodded before turning and walking away. I then turned and headed up the stairs to class myself. The rest of the day carried out like it always did. I went to Chorus, the bell rang, and I rode the bus home. Of course, one big thing was on my mind; talking to Lacie again.

What it was, I couldn't have told you at the time -- other than, I guess, to say that it was a simple "Birds of a feather" type of deal. We were both a couple of shy misfits, and yet, we wouldn't change anything about that, you know? We were us.

I think, also, just her overall mysterious nature helped draw me in. In short, I wanted to get to know her, figure out what makes *her* tick. Does *she like* Fantasy stuff like "Lord of the Rings" (She *did* say she was a witch, after all)? And, of course, there would be the mystery of why she felt like she couldn't eat meat.

I wondered if the two could've been connected, you know, like maybe it was against her faith or something to eat meat. Granted, I know *now* that wouldn't have been the case, having done at least cursory research on the topic, but back then, I wouldn't have known a damn thing, being an atheist. In any case, I figured she was just really cool, in a mysterious sort of way.

It was around five or six o'clock that evening when she called me. I eagerly snatched up my telephone and answered "Yeah, uh, H-Hello?"

"H-Hey." She replied, sounding just as awkward as I did. For a moment, neither of us said anything. We didn't know what to say. It kinda felt like we were one of those "No, you go first" kind of teen couples you see on old cheesy brat-pack movies. Finally, I broke the silence by working up the courage to ask, "So, uh... Where you from? Before here, I mean."

She hesitated for a moment before replying, "Um... I'm from here."

"What do you mean?"

"I'm from here. From the earth." Confused as I was when she said this, I couldn't help but snicker.

*"Obviously, the girl's got a sense of humor."* I thought.

"Well, duh." I said, "But I mean where were you living before you moved into this town?"

"What do you mean?" she asked. I could tell now she wasn't intending for her answers to come off as a joke. Unfortunately for me, that meant I'd have no clue as to what the hell she was talking about.

“Uh... heh, heh, never mind. Uh, what about hanging out? Is there anything you like doing, like going to the movies or something?” Admittedly, I felt kinda stupid asking this. Hell, have we not already established that neither of us are real outgoing; and here I was asking if she wanted to go to the frickin’ movies.

“Well... sorta.” She replied, somewhat surprising me. “It’s not really a *”hangout place”*, though. Just the woods. I like to walk through the woods sometimes. It’s peaceful, you know?”

I almost wanted to jump out of my skin hearing this. It was perfect. I always used to try and picture the woods as a setting for my fantasy characters. Then, of course, that’s when an idea came to me; Me and Lacie should meet up in the woods together. I thought, given that she was into nature and magic, technically a lot more than I was, that she’d be able to give me tips for my story, you know?

It was something that could bring us together, despite us otherwise being generally distant people. I guess that’s just something else to keep in mind while reading this. We were both just kids, and we had each other to hold on to.

“Really?” I asked. “Well, you know, there *is* a stretch of woods just behind the school. Wanna hang out there?”

“Um... uh, I mean, we can... but like I said, I’ve never usually “hung out” in the woods. Usually I go alone.”

“Oh.” I said, feeling a bit awkward.

“But, I mean, if you’d *wanna* come, that’d be cool, too.”

“Uh... o-okay.” I said, heart pounding excitedly. “When, What time?”

“Well... I’m about to go out now. You wanna join?”

**\*\*\***

I walk around the old house. I walk around to the back. I see the woods. The trees all still clustered together, looming down, almost seeming to glare at me. The woods we walked through together.

Our hangout spot. My fantasy land. And her place of solitude.

*Her resting place.*

**\*\*\***

We met that evening there in the woods. The sun had already begun to go down, but that wasn’t a problem for me. For one thing, my mom had told me earlier that week that she was gonna be out of town for a few days; leaving me with ample money for pizza or whatever else I’d need, plus, I’d been used to being home alone (the way I liked it). The other reason of course, just the novelty of being out that late at night.

Out, in the dark, spooky looking stretch of woods behind my house. For a moment, I wondered. Something that hadn’t occurred to me before (probably because I was too excited to give a damn), but how would she know where the woods were? How would she know where my house was?

Nevertheless, there she was, about a foot of the way in. She was crouched down behind a tree, sorta picking at the ground near the base. “Hey, uh... how did you...”

“I told you,” she interrupted, “This is my home.”

“You mean your house is here?” I was pretty sure there weren’t any houses in these woods, but what else could she have meant? She shook her head.

“No. Well, not like yours.”

“What do you mean?”

She stood up. “Here, I’ll show you.” She waved her hand for me to follow and began heading deeper into the woods.

“Hold on, wait.” I called out, clicking on my flashlight. The sun was just about gone, having sunk at least halfway behind the trees. She was up ahead. Finally, she stopped in front of, oddly enough, the largest tree there. "This's it." she said.

I looked at the tree, confused as hell. "Huh?"

"This is my home. Where I'm from."

"What do you mean?"

She turned and looked at me. Her face was so serious when she said this. She looked to me like she was about to give some sort of emotional speech.

"Mama tree. That's what I call her, anyway. She takes care of me."

I looked at the tree. I was confused a bit. Sure, it was big enough, but other than that, I couldn't see anything special about it. There were no tree houses, either, so God only knew how the hell she was "living" in it or how it "took care of her."

She looked again at the tree and said, "Go on, say hi."

"Um... uh, h-hello..." I replied, not knowing at all what the hell was supposed to happen. For another moment, I just stood there, thinking about trying to turn and head back to the house when I then saw something happen with the tree. Lacie touched it gently and I saw it begin to glow. I watched this green aura take form around the tree.

*It was beautiful...*

**\*\*\***

I walk through these woods. Just like they were back then, the trees join together, clustering. Each one leers down at me. Despite all these years, the trees still lord over me. They almost seem to look down upon me with a sort of sympathy, the kind you'd only see at funerals by those who knew how close you were with the deceased.

I walk and walk, further and further, until I see it. "Mama tree". She looks so worn. So desiccated, so dried up. I walk up to it and put my palm on it's surface. It dimly glows, like an old lightbulb. I feel something draining from inside me, and I retract my hand.

I look down and I see it. The decayed shell that was once a young girl. I close my eyes and the tears come.

**\*\*\***

"Holy shit!" I cried excitedly. She kept her hand on the face of the tree for another five seconds before pulling her hand back, causing the glow to fade and the tree to return to normal. "H-How did you--"

"This is how Mama tree takes care of me. She gives me energy."

I reached out to try and touch the tree like she did. "Cool! Let me--"

"No!" she snapped, batting my hand away. I froze, startled. "I-I mean, you can't."

"O-Okay... H-How come?" She looked back at the tree.

"I... I have to be careful about Mama tree. Y-you can't use her too much."

I cocked my eyebrows. "Wh-what do you mean?"

Still looking at the tree, she said, "Mama tree gives energy, but it isn't exactly free. It takes from you while it gives to you, you know? I need it, but I have to be careful of how much I use it, you know?"

I nodded, despite not at all understanding a single thing she'd just said. I looked at "Mama tree" again.  Without the glow, it looked like a normal tree. "What does it take?" I asked.

She looked down at her hands and sighed. I could tell that, for whatever reason, whatever was going on with this tree, it was something that just as much haunted her as it did comfort her. Because of this, I immediately began trying to change the subject. "Hey, uh... It's kinda getting dark out. You, uh..." I looked around, remembering that she didn't exactly have an actual house, before asking, You wanna come sleepover at my house?"

"Sleepover?" she asked skeptically.

"Yeah... You know, like spending the night at my house." She frowned, confused. "You've never had a sleepover before?"

She shook her head. I was a little shocked. Okay, sure, she probably didn't have much of any friends or people in general that she socialized much with, but still, I'd have figured she'd have *at least* heard of a sleepover. I took her by the hand and began leading her back towards my house.

She hesitated for a moment, looking back toward the tree. "What is it?" I asked. She snapped to look at me and shook her head before following along behind me. By the time we made it back to my house, it was pitch dark outside. Even with the flashlight, it was difficult finding our way back out.

We got back to my house and went inside. "Home, sweet home." I said, presenting the inside of the overly cluttered living room. With Ma being gone most of the time and the fact that I didn't usually have friends over anyway, it goes without saying that, yeah, the house was a bit of a mess and it wasn't exactly high on my priority list to change that, either.

Of course, That is, until I watched her look around the place. Her face was sort of a mix of anxiety and disgust. That was when a bit of shame actually hit me, feeling like I should've planned this out a little better. "Heh, heh, you'll have to forgive the mess he--"

I was cut off when I heard her whisper something under her breath. I wasn't real sure at the time, but it almost sounded like she'd said something like, *"It's still here."*

"Huh?" I asked. She snapped up again to look at me. "You said something?"

She started looking around the living room again before asking, "This is where you live?"

"Uh... Yeah... Why?" She continued looking around nervously. "Lacie? Everything okay?"

I heard her whisper again, this time more clearly, *"Nothing's changed, It's all still here."*

*"What?"* I wondered. "*What is she talking about?"*

"What hasn't changed?" She looked at me again and shook her head.

"Oh, uh... Nothing. It's a long story. Um, so, what do we do now?" I paused for a moment and shrugged.

"I don't know, wanna watch a movie?" She looked at the TV and shrugged.

"Sure, which one?"

"How about 'Lord of the Rings'?" I exclaimed. She looked at me confused. My eyes widened with shock, "You've never seen 'Lord of the Rings'?!"

She shrank down a bit and replied, "Sorry... guess I haven't really watched all that many movies. Never really was able to."

I once again felt a sense of heartbreak. I wondered what her life was like before; what it is now. I mean, as far as I knew, she didn't even have a home, or even parents. I started wondering if maybe she was a runaway. If she was, was someone looking for her?

I turned on the TV and put in "The Two Towers', my personal favorite of the trilogy. She sat down, kinda stiff and rigidly on the couch while I went to see about scrounging up some snacks for us. I wondered if there'd be anything in the house she'd eat. Most everything in the fridge was either old leftovers, or the packages of fresh pork chops Mom bought a week ago, yet still hadn't gotten around to cooking. Fortunately, I saw we still had a pack of carrots.

I joined her on the couch and offered to split the pack with her. She snickered before taking a handful. We watched about the first half hour or so with the both of us being absolutely enthralled. Though, when it got to the scenes with the Ents, I noticed her mood seem to change a bit. She seemed to be both fascinated and anxious with it.

I didn’t say anything, of course, but I won’t lie, it really started to make me wonder. What was it that made this all stand out to her like this? What was it about trees (or hell, could it have been the forest in general?) that made her both love and fear it?

I guess the biggest questions, obviously, were what was Lacie not telling me here? Where did she come from before, where did the *tree* come from? How’d she find it? And, last but most *certainly* not least, what made the tree so dangerous to use?

*”What was she talking about when she said it’d take from you when you used it?”*

This question, above anything else, was what kept me wide awake most of that night, even long after Lacie had nodded off, laying her head on my shoulder. I just quietly sat there, in the dark, staring both at and beyond the TV. My focus was brought back to reality, though, when I started hearing Lacie whispering something in her sleep.

*“I-I-I’m c-coming, m-mama...”* I heard her mutter. I looked over. I could feel her body start to stir. *”I’m c-comin’ mama...”* She started fidgeting more and more violently. I put my hand on her shoulder and began shaking her. That's when I noticed something. I noticed that her skin felt loose, like it was hanging off of her bones. Her whispering became weaker, hoarse.

*“I-I-I’m c-coming, m-mama...”*

"Lacie?" I whispered, gently shaking her. "Lacie! Lacie, wake up!" My heart nearly stopped when, all of a sudden, she let out a loud groan of pain, like the sound a cat would make if it's tail was stomped on, mixed with the sound of a sick person. It didn't sound normal at all. I got up and scrambled for the light.

Flicking it on, I was horrified when I saw Lacie, laying on her side on the couch with her skin all shriveled like a raisin. I wanted to scream, but it caught in my throat. She groaned again, louder, *"Mama tree..."*

"Lacie!" I shouted. Her eyes opened very slightly, her eyelids drooping limply. Her voice continued to fade as she cried out again. I didn't know what to do. Thinking quickly, I grabbed the phone and dialed the ambulance.

When they arrived, I tried explaining to them what I could. That me and her were out in the woods, hanging out, and the next thing I knew, she was dying on my couch. Of course, when they asked me about what "Mama tree" was, I told them I didn't know. I feel like this wasn't a complete lie, either. I *didn't* really know what it was, aside from the fact that it apparently glows and was special for whatever reason to Lacie.

**\*\*\***

I look down at the desiccated remains. The shriveled pelt still had strands of her long, ginger hair. It's the only thing of color that still remained of her. Her hand is stuck fast to the base of the tree.

*She wouldn't let go.*

I look to the tree once again. It sits, apathetic. The color and vitality it held all that time ago remains.

It looks enticing, in a way. It's health gives an almost otherworldly allure. I feel something tingling inside of me. An overwhelming urge. I want to reach out to it. To touch it. To have that energy...

I stop.

I have to resist. I hear it, beckoning to me. I look again at her corpse. I can see small roots growing out of her hollow eye socket.

*I have to resist. I promised I would.*

**\*\*\***

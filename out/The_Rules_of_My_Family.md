Welcome! You are very lucky to be part of the family. They are very nice people, if you follow the rules, that is.

The Rules

Mother: 
In the mornings, Mother wakes very early. She wakes around 5am and sits in the dim lighting and cuddles with the dogs. 

1. If the dogs knock at the door, do not let Mother open it. This will agitate her as she is very tired.

2. Get Mother her coffee. Do not comment on how much she drinks, do not refuse, just get the coffee. If you don’t, she will complain to Father.

3. If you would like a lift to school, do not ask her directly. Mother needs an ego boost to have a good day. Simply tell her a sob story of your morning or behave more tired than usual, and she will offer a ride to you and Sister 2. 

4. In the afternoons, she drinks gin and tonic only. Do not give her more than 3 ice cubes. Any more is too cold, any less is too warm. Either one will result in a complaint to Father. 

5. She will most likely fall asleep, do not  wake her. She needs the rest.

6. Mother is not hostile. She will be kind if you forget something and will only ask for small favours.

Father:

1. Father may wake early in the morning if he must travel to the office. He and Mother work from home but occasionally go to the office. He will be grumpy if he had to wake early. 

2. When Father goes to the bathroom, there will be a horrible stench. If needed, spray the aerosol can and don’t mention it to anyone.

3. Do not complain to Father or make someone complain about you to him. You are new, he will not be so trusting around you.

4. Father does not give lifts to school. He will take many winding roads and will make you more late if you ask him to take you to school.

5. In the evenings, Father will ask for white wine and white wine only. Serve him half a glass.

6. If either Mother or Father asks for a drink for only themselves, always ask the other if they would like a drink too.

7. Father is very bossy and will tell you to do lots of things. Do them ASAP.

8.  Always tell him if he has food on his face or clothes. He will appreciate this and become more trusting of you. 

9. Although strict, Father is very funny. Laugh at his jokes. If you see a perfect joke opportunity, take it. He likes those who have a sense of humour.

10. If he yells, don’t make eye contact. The figure you see will not be Father.

11. Be kind to the fluffy black dog. He is Father’s favourite. Pay attention to the puppy as well. He is very sweet.

12. Try to do your chores without Father asking. He will be impressed.
The Sisters:

1. There are 4 sisters, including me. All are friendly and will agree with any complaints you have. 

2. Sister 1 is very kind, Sister 2 is very opinionated, and Sister 3 is very blunt. I was like you and I can help you with anything. 

3. There is a schedule on the fridge. Memorise it. Every sister’s mood is affected by it.

4. Do nice things for them, it will help you in the long run.

That is all! If you need help, talk to me. Asking the others will result in a very bad punishment. Good luck!

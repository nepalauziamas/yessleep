Cries and mourns fills up my entire body as I watch my own boyfriend be buried in his grave. My breath is threatening to run out as I walked towards his casket. When everything was so right something just has to go wrong. The world is not perfect and no one is perfect, but he was, we were. 

I bent down and planted a kiss on his glass and refused to let go. This will be my last peak of him this will be my last kiss for him. Whoever did this to him will pay, I will make them pay.

“Bianca…” One of our friends reached out and tried to pull me away.

“No, no, no…” I shook my head as I hugged his casket and repeatedly planted kiss on it. “Babe…” I called out, hoping that this was a dream, and I called him to wake me up, then everything will be okay. It was just a nightmare, but no one ever woke me up.

“Ma’am…” The worker supported me to leave. He has to be taken away, he has to be buried. My heart clenched and I feel like dying of a heartache. His mom pulled me to a hug and our cries began to get louder.

They buried with him, his license, name plate and robe. He was the best psychologist out there and he loved his job, I saw him smile and jump every time he hits the dean’s list. I watched him read all of his books. I make him coffee every time he has to stay up late. I cook him breakfast, pack him lunch and wait for him on dinner. I was there when his nose bleeds from too much studying, I was there when he caught fever. I was there when he was murdered and yet I couldn’t seem to remember what happened.

I rub the side of the bed to locate my boyfriend and greet him good morning but he wasn’t there. 

“Renz?” I called out. It’s odd to have him wake up earlier than I do.

I put my feet down wore my slippers and walked down the stairs. Immediately a strong stench of smell attacked my nose. Did someone die in here?

I covered my nose and quickly looked for what had been causing the smell. We don’t have a pet, or insects around that could be dead and produce this smell. 

It never really crossed my mind that the awful smell was from my own boyfriend. He was on the kitchen, he has multiple wounds and he was already being consumed by worms. There were dried blood stains everywhere. He was decomposing.

I let out a scream before stumbling through some appliances before reaching telephone.

“911 what’s your emergency?” The receiver answered.

I immediately gave my address before explaining what had happened.

“M-my boyfriend… he was in the kitchen” 

“He’s been murdered!”

“He’s decomposing!”

I hysterically yelled at the receiver. It was all a blur to me I was yelling, I was crying, I was throwing up. “My god! Please send help immediately!”

“Ma’am stay calm please. I need you to cooperate.” The operator said, and I tried. “Is the murderer around?”

Fuck! That didn’t even cross my mind either. “I don’t know!”

“Okay, please stay on the line, police is coming in any minute.” The operator said. “Do you have any weapon near you?” 

“No!” 

“Okay then stay with us.” She said before a knock was heard on my door. “That’s the police.”

I immediately ran towards the front door and opened it up. Everything happened so fast. Renz was sent to a morgue; Yellow crime scene tapes were all over our pent house. An investigation was immediately implemented. And I was interrogated.

“Where were you Ms. Greene?” 

“I don’t know!” I cried aloud.

“What do you mean? What were you doing during the incident?” 

I shook my head and ran my palm through my head. “I was asleep.”

“He had been dead for a week and you’re telling me you were asleep in the place where your boyfriend was murdered?” He whispered and I nodded.

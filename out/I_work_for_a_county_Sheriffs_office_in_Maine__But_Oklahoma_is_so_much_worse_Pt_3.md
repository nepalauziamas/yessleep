Preparing to fight lake monsters was an experience in it’s own right. Eric gave me an entire set of instructions, I couldn’t remember all of them. Don’t let them touch you and don’t fall into the water - those were the main ones. He put the salt I bought into little bags and told me to carry them with me. If I saw anything I was supposed to pour the salt over them.

By the time we were ready to actually set out the hunters Devin had called were already out stalking around the lake. You could hear them shouting though the forest and shooting at anything that moved. Their flashlights spotted through the trees making it difficult to see.

Eric and I stayed beside the lake. He moved without sound as I blundered along behind him. I had seen him track something before, so I knew that strange eye of his was seeing things I couldn’t. Though somehow I expected that it would be a quicker process than it was, given the urgency of the situation to locate the monster before the hunters.

Regardless it must have been hours into the night before he stopped, and we were by then quite some distance away from any other person, “Do you see it?” I whispered nervously.

“No.. But you will need to wait here a moment. Don’t move.” He instructed and I nodded. We were right at the edge of the lake, wedged between the thick of the forest and the water itself. I didn’t notice when he left, I only realised I was alone when I turned to ask where he was going.

I felt distinctly vulnerable then. In the distance I could still see the lights from the hunters, but I myself felt isolated. It was similar to being at a bonfire and stepping back from the crowd. You can still see other people, but you can’t feel their presence, you were somehow obscured. Primal instinct tells you that you should go back closer to the fire so that  a predator in the night won’t pick you off.

A cold breeze came across the lake then and I shone my flashlight out across the surface. The hair on the back of my neck stood on end as the light fell on something out in the water. There was a shape moving toward the edge of the lake, toward me. It moved so strangely in the water that for a moment I was convinced it was the lake monster I had seen before.

However as it came closer, I came to understand that it was a young woman. She swam slowly but stopped to put an arm up to shield her eyes from the light. Instinctively I lowered the beam, “Sorry!” I called to her, “What are you doing out here? You really shouldn’t be swimming at this hour.” I was worried the lake monster might find her if she stayed in the water much longer.

She hesitated but didn’t answer me. I thought that was odd at first, then it dawned on me.  She seemed to be completely nude. She was skinny dipping, and I must have been standing near where her clothes were. If I was her, I would be nervous too. After all, I was a strange man standing at the lake edge in the middle of the night with a flashlight, a shotgun and an obsessive amount of salt in little baggies.

I cleared my throat awkwardly, “Ahh, right sorry, I don’t mean to frighten you. I’m just out on a walk.” I kicked myself for that. Who was just ‘out for a walk’ at this hour? I think the honest embarrassment in my voice must have made her feel safer for she came closer.

Once she reached the shallow water at the edge of the lake she stood up. Her hair was long and clung to every curve as the water ran freely down her body. She was breathtaking, she almost seemed to be shimmering and I stared in pure dumbfounded shock as she walked closer to me. It felt like my brain was malfunctioning as she put a hand on my shoulder.

If I had any sense about me I might have noticed that her skin had a blueish tint to it, or that her eyes were just a little too circular. Instead I stood perfectly still as she pressed herself close to me, I wasn’t even sure what was happening until she kissed me. But by then it was too late.

My lips burned and water flooded into my mouth. I shoved her away and I was vaguely aware that there was extra movement around me though I couldn’t focus on what it was. My vision was blurred as fluid began to leak from my eyes and nose. The flashlight I was holding went out as the water leaking out of me seeped into it and I could feel my lungs filling with liquid. I couldn’t breathe.

Of course by then I knew what was happening, I was filling with water just as the two bloated bodies had, just as the deer had. It’s amazing how quickly you start to succumb, I knew I was drowning, or something very alike to it. My head started to ache and I began to feel dizzy, I wondered how much longer I would last. Though I knew it wouldn’t be long.

I’m fairly sure I was drifting between the conscious plane and the next life in those moments. Coughing and gagging on water I could feel someone trying to force what I thought was sand into my mouth. Reflexively I tried to spit it out, it was so dry and coarse.

“Charles I swear-“ I could hear Eric, his voice sounded like it was far away underwater, but even so I could tell he was annoyed, “You need to work with me just a little bit here. Eat the salt, stop spitting it out.” He growled.

I heard what he said but couldn’t process what he wanted me to do. With my mind in it’s groggy state it’s a miracle that I eventually figured it out. The sand, wasn’t sand at all, but fine salt. The taste of it was overpowering, I don’t know if any of you have ever eaten a full spoon of pure salt but it’s not fun and this was way more than a spoonful.

However the relief was almost immediate. I felt the pressure of water beginning to recede, the salt was drying me out. Fluid was replaced with the burn of too much sodium and the overpowering urge to pee, so I figured I would probably be okay. I’m not sure how long it took exactly for me to recover. By the time I came to my senses Eric was standing beside me.

“I told you, expressly, not to let them touch you. I said specifically if you see anything to pour salt on it. Did I not?” He demanded. I tried to answer him but my throat was too hoarse so he continued, “I come back and you’re locking lips with one of them, Charles. Have you no self control?” He scolded me.

“What… do you mean.. one?” I croaked.

“There are more, one less now.” Eric gestured to the waters edge where I noticed for the first time a gooey mass steaming. It looked like he had ripped it apart and the way it fizzled reminded me of a slug when you tip salt on them, “Can you walk? We need to move. They will come for their kin, I don’t know if I can fight two at once.”

With that I struggled to stand though I would have fallen again almost immediately if Eric didn’t catch a hold of my arm to keep me up. “Thanks.” I mumbled embarrassed as nausea washed over me. I vomited shortly after that. Expelling a mass of salty water in a less than dignified way.

“I’m sorry.” I apologised feeling painfully inferior. I’m sure he was anxious to move on and I was the thing slowing us down.

“You don’t need to apologise for being human.” Eric answered calmly, though I couldn’t determine anything he may have thought he didn’t seem hostile or annoyed. Rather patient, his kindness about the situation surprised me and that only made me feel more guilty.

He supported me and we moved as quickly as I could manage without dragging him down. Initially we tried to go directly away from the water into the forest, but I couldn’t navigate over the rough terrain in the state I was in. Which forced us to walk back beside the lake on the path instead.

Unfortunately we didn’t get far before I heard a soft sloshing sound from the water. The things were there, travelling with us not more than a few feet away. By my count, there were five and they were gaining. Water began to rise from the lake in familiar spouts and I knew they were about to attack. I think Eric knew it too and I cursed myself for our predicament.

“Charles.” When he spoke now his voice was tense, “Get as far away as you can. If you get to a point where you can’t go any further, draw an unbroken line of salt around yourself and wait until morning.”

I didn’t have the opportunity to answer before he moved. He left me where I was as he pulled a knife from his belt to hold in his left hand. I’m not certain, but it looked odd, the blade fine and made from black material. Though I couldn’t see well enough in the dark to say what it was.

The entities in the water hissed in unison when he turned to face them and I got the impression that they were somewhat cautious of him. That something about him unnerved the creatures, and that in turn made my blood run cold. I couldn’t imagine much worse than them, so what did they have to be afraid of?

Whatever their initial reservations may have been once they realised Eric was alone they attacked. Two of them rushed forward from the water. To my astonishment they looked mostly humanoid, but with no hair, scales and extra fins. Whatever illusion I had seen of a nude woman was stripped from them and I shuddered to think that I had kissed something so grotesque with gnashing teeth like that.

With the two came a wave of water which rose unnaturally from the lake, Eric cut through that first. His arm sliced through the water separating it so that it lost form and splashed to the ground uselessly before he moved directly for one of the creatures.

Now I know I shouldn’t have been surprised by how quickly he moved, maybe I shouldn’t have been watching at all really, I probably should have been stumbling away into the forest.  However when he connected with the first creature it was so fast I almost didn’t know what had happened.

He seemed to slice it with the blade and smear salt deep into the wound. The thing gargled in what I could only assume was a sound of pain as it began to dissolve from the inside out, then Eric turned his attention to the other advancing lake monster. That one he met more evenly. The first may have been caught by surprise but the second one learned. It moved like a cobra, trying to strike him without allowing him to get too close.

The way Eric moved made me realise that he was without a doubt trained for combat. Every step he took was deliberate and calculated. It must have taken him less than a minute to get a good angle on the thing and once he got a hold of it he tore it limb from limb. It bled a clear fluid slightly thicker than the consistency of water and Eric forced salt into every tear as he went.

It was almost disturbing to watch with the way the thing screamed and sizzled. As well as the way Eric fought, he was clearly a trained killer, I wondered then if he had a military background.. And if that was true, was the military aware of these kinds of creatures? Was Eric sent here for this purpose? More over, was I in danger? Was I seeing too much?

I tried not to let myself think too much about conspiracy theories and my attention was returned to the battle as I heard Eric exhale in pain. After he had dealt with the first two the others had attacked in unison, he was outnumbered then three to one and one of them had managed to get a hold of him.

The thing had bitten down hard on his right arm. The strange skin there seemed to crack at the points of impact under the teeth as if it were made of ceramic. I was almost surprised to see him bleed red like any other person would, though it seemed to send the deranged fish monsters into a frenzy of victory.

Eric managed to pull himself free of the thing’s grasp only to be immediately set upon again. He moved to avoid their attacks, but they were advancing and he was defending. The injury to his arm undoubtedly made fighting more difficult, his range of motion seemed restricted and I saw him faulter.

As I watched in horror it dawned on me that he was outmatched. They were bigger, there were more of them and he had run out of salt. They were going to win. I knew it, he knew it, they knew it. I waited for him to retreat. He certainly had enough skill that he could disengage, but he didn’t. For a moment I couldn’t figure out why, then I realised, he was fighting them longer to give me more time to escape.

Time that I was wasting watching the battle instead of running away. Quickly I scrambled into action. I emptied the rounds in my shotgun and carefully packed salt into the shells. I don’t know how well I did, my hands were trembling and I didn’t know if it would work but I had to at least try. I had used salt shells in training, though I wasn’t sure if I was packing them correctly or not.

I reloaded the weapon, took aim and fired. The shot travelled better than I was expecting and sprayed a cloud of fine salt on impact. There was a moment of tense confusion, Eric looked surprised while the creatures hissed in shock and pain. Everything seemed to come to a complete stand still as understanding dawned.

The second of hesitance from them was all Eric needed. I saw him tear through one and move on the second, however the third creature turned to me. I saw it’s flat eyes calculating where the attack had come from as I scrambled to reload. It was upon me in seconds and when I tried to fire the gun again it jammed.

I must’ve fired it wrong the first time, or perhaps the improvised salt shells hadn’t done it any favours, either way it wouldn’t fire. To slow the thing’s advance I threw the entire shotgun at it then hurried to find something else to defend myself with. Moving so rapidly made my head spin but I managed to pull the final bag of salt from my belt and launch it at the creature.

The thing evaded that attempt and I floundered to get away from it’s touch, falling back into the edge of the forest as I did. In desperation I reached around me for the nearest object and my hand closed around a solid mass. I knew it was over then. I was making my final stand in the shrubbery with a rock.

In the near distance I could hear others shouting. I suppose the commotion must have finally attracted Devin and his group. Although I knew there was nothing they could do against this thing, they didn’t know about the salt, all they had were regular bullets. I hoped I could smash the stone into it’s face with enough force to hold it off.

However, if in that moment, Eric hadn’t sliced through the creature I’m sure I would have died. The rock fell from my hand as relief washed over me, though unfortunately, the thing crumpled on top of me. The viscus watery blood-fluid spilled over me, I was soaked and it smelt strongly of that all too familiar sun dried algae smell. That alone was enough to make me vomit again.

By the time Devin and the others reached us Eric was helping me up out of the brush. They stood in a loose line staring at us, guns held close. I could only imagine what they must have been thinking. Around us piles of steaming mush that were once overzealous murder-fish were dissolving. Eric stood beside me and I looked half drowned. I felt weak, I was sure I was close to passing out.

Slowly the flashlights landed on Eric. His darker eye contracted back to a narrow slit as lights were shone in his face. He stood straight and he held his good hand over the puncture wounds on his damaged arm. Though blood still leaked through, trickling down his arm and slowly dripping from his fingertips into the dry dirt. Devin raised a gun to point it at him then and Eric tilted his head up in response, almost daring Devin to try it.

“Charles, are you alright here?” Devin asked though his eyes were fixated on Eric and his strange arm.

“Yeah, I’m fine, Eric got the lake monsters.” I tried to deescalate the tense situation.

“Some kind of freak is he?” He asked with a gruff snort of disapproval. I thought for a moment that he might shoot Eric just for the sake of it.

“He saved our lives.” I responded coldly.

Devin seemed to consider my statement for a moment and I thought perhaps he was beginning to understand the debt he owed. However his response showed otherwise, “I think it’s best he leaves now then. Before anything else unfortunate happens here.” He said in a low tone, the threat in his words thinly vailed.

The disappointment I felt for Devin’s leadership and his decision making in that moment was immense, though I’m not sure what I had expected from him. Maybe I had assumed he would be somewhat grateful, or at the very least, that he would lower his gun but he did not. Instead his stance remained unchanged and I realised that he indeed meant what he said. He wanted Eric to leave immediately.

I was about to argue with him when Eric spoke up, catching me by surprise, “As you wish. Do get Charles to a hospital though. He’s going to need additional care.” He stated calmly, apparently unfazed by Devin’s attitude. I suppose he was used to it.

“We’ll get Charles patched up.” He agreed, then repeated, “But you need to go. Now.”

Eric turned slightly to me and I heard the safety release on several guns in preparation as he did so, “Try not to make a habit of finding monsters Charles, it’s not good for your health.” He commented and I realised that was his way of saying goodbye for he then moved to go. Turning his back on the men he walked away down the path into the darkness.

It shouldn’t have had to be that way. I was sure he needed medical attention and I wanted to protest against him being forced to leave. Although truthfully I had no strength left. My vision blurred and the axis of the world tilted as I fell. I don’t think anyone caught me that time and I met the ground as black stars blotted out my sight.

I awoke a couple days later in hospital. Apparently my system was so flooded with fluid that they had given me diuretics to flush out the water and as a result I was hooked up to some very uncomfortable machinery. Devin came to see me sometime after, he told me I was being transferred back to Maine early. I suspect that was to keep me from talking about my experience with anyone else. Not that I minded at all. I couldn’t wait to get away from Oklahoma and it’s cursed lakes.

However, what bothered me most was that I wasn’t able to thank Eric for saving my life for a second time. Devin’s reaction to him didn’t sit right with me. I thought about how many times Eric must have had firearms aimed at him and I wondered why he would even continue to help people under those circumstances.

They discharged me with clearance to work again in two weeks time. I packed up the hotel room and loaded my gear into the truck. That was when I remembered Eric’s cane, I had left it in the truck after he handed it to me, but it was gone now. I don’t know when, or how, he could have gotten it and I decided I didn’t want to think about it too much either. I had a feeling that I would see him again next time something strange happened.

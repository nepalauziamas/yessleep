I have absolutely no idea what’s going on in my house. The police are useless because technically they haven't caught anyone committing a crime and they haven’t seen anyone around my house. I just need to tell people about our situation.

There’s some things I need you to understand first. I live with my brother and my mum. It’s just the 3 of us. We live in a nice little 2 story house and it’s a pretty chill neighbourhood too. We have a dog and a cat and they get on very well with each other funnily enough. I also need to state that all of us are out of the house from 9am-3pm. This is important to mention as I talk through. Also, I am always the first one home as my job tends to follow an early shift of 7am-3pm. Let’s get into it..

About 4 weeks ago I came home and everything seemed normal. Very quiet, until I entered the door and the dog decided to make my ears bleed with endless excited barks. I sat down on the sofa in our living room when I looked across the room towards one of our chairs. I noticed, that the chair was absolutely spotless and clean.

How is this weird you might ask? Well our cat has a really bad habit of clawing the chairs and using them as scratching posts even though we got him one already. So the sides of all our chairs downstairs had these really ugly marks on them. The chairs were dark so it wasn’t a huge visual disturbance however it always bugged me. So It looked like my mum had gotten a replacement chair. This was odd as multiple of them were slightly torn up but she replaced only one of them.

When she got home an hour later I asked her:

“Did you get a new chair by the way? I’m assuming Max (our cat) finally got the better of it.”

“What? No I haven’t gotten a new chair.”

This was odd but I thought maybe the cat just hadn’t scratched at that chair. I made nothing of it and just moved on.

A few days later something else happened. I came home from work to find that all of our cutlery had been replaced. This I knew had been changed because our last set of cutlery had a silvery metal colour. This new set had a distinct gold colour.

Again I asked my mum.

“Did you get new cutlery?”

“No I didn’t, but I think your uncle might’ve got it for us.”

You see my uncle was quite close to my mum and us so he had a key to our house. He’d frequently come in to check on us and just chill.

Again I made nothing of the random object replacement in the house.

Now this is where the object changes started to get weirder. At this point I knew something seriously creepy was happening in our house.

A few days after that I came home alone again. My dog again barked as it greeted me. I opened the door, walked into the hallway and everything seemed fine. Then I noticed that the mirror at the end of the hallway had been replaced. Not only this, but it had been flipped so it was facing the other way. The reflective side of the object was facing the wall and the smooth wooden backside was exposed to the hallway.

When my mum came home I told her that something seriously weird was going on but she did not believe me. I was in very much a ‘boy who cried wolf’ situation as I thought it was funny to prank her on occasions. I was really concerned about what was happening however I also considered the fact my mum might’ve just been buying things and forgetting about it. She was getting to an age where that kind of thing was common and she’d forgotten about a few things before. For example, she bought my brother a new gaming chair and completely forgot about it not too long ago.

The very next day I came home and I remember begging to not see anything replaced or moved in the house when no one had been there. I opened the door, my dog barked at me, I stepped in and started inspecting everything. I felt like I was going crazy. I seemed to identify things being moved and replaced however my mum and brother didn’t take note of it. Made me think I was making it up in my head.

The only room I hadn’t checked so far was the second floor bathroom but everything seemed good. I opened the door slowly and peered my eyes around the corner. Nothing had changed. Everything looked the same to me, nothing was moved or replaced. Everything is good. Phew. We are in the clear I thought. Later that day when I went to brush my teeth at night that’s when I noticed something. My toothbrush was gone now. It wasn’t replaced, like the other objects. It was just completely gone.

I naively assumed that it was my mum who had put it in the trash as it was old and she’d forgotten to replace it. I didn’t even ask her about it because it’s just one of those things where it happens so often you don’t consider it to be an unusual event. However, with what had been happening around the house it did raise a concern.

For the next few days I was relieved. As for every time I came home to an empty house nothing had changed. Nothing had been replaced or moved. I thought to myself that this must’ve been something I’ve just made up in my head. How could anyone have even gotten into the house without a key? Secondly, why were they just moving and replacing seemingly random objects? If someone were to break into our house, surely they’d steal the valuables right?

Now this next part I’m about to tell you has happened over the last 2 weeks.

After pretty much forgetting about the strange replacing/moving of objects in my house I once again came home to work. Opened the door blissfully, however this time I didn’t hear my dog bark.

“Where is she?“ I thought to myself as I entered the room.

After yelling my dogs name, I could hear the faintest of barks coming from upstairs.

I slowly started to creep up the stairs. The barks got louder with every step and as I reached the top I realised what had happened. My dog was locked in my mums room.

My mum always had a “doors must be open at all times” policy cause she didn’t want my dog or cat to be locked in any rooms. So my dog being locked in her room specifically creeped the shit out of me. As I approached the door I could hear my dogs claws scraping against the door as she tried to get out. A truly horrifying thought hit me as I got within a few inches of the door. What if… my dog had been replaced too? No she couldn’t be. Not a fucking chance. I slowly edged the door open and i let out the biggest sigh of relief when my dog ran to me to give me cuddles. My dog hadn’t been replaced or changed in any way thankfully. When I went into the room though I looked at the wall above my mums bed.

My heart froze.

I saw a picture of the three of us that had been moved from downstairs to this room. Me, my mum and my brother on the wall above my mums bed. As I got closer to the wall something horrifying captured my attention. The picture was being held up by a knife which had been aggressively driven into the wall. I began to shake and panic as I realised that this knife was a knife from my old cutlery set. The one that had got replaced. Now I wasn’t sure if this was a coincidence or not but there was something else which terrified me. The knife was placed in a way that it pierced my head in the image. You couldn’t even see half of my face because the knife had been shoved into it.

I quickly ran out the room grabbed my dog and got out the house. I immediately phoned the police. I stood a few houses down outside with my dog absolutely terrified to go back into my house. I just glazed at my house from a distance in fear. The police eventually came and surprisingly they were actually pretty useful about it. They checked the house and calmed me down. My mum came home about 20 minutes after and my brother followed shortly after to see the police outside my house.

The police basically said to us that someone must’ve somehow been getting into our house and had been screwing with us. They told us to change our locks and that they would leave someone outside to see if anyone tried to break in when we were all out for the day.

I felt sick to my stomach knowing that we just had to go back into the house despite what I’d just seen. The police checked everything and we did indeed change our locks before nightfall but the terror I had going back into the house was unlike anything I’d ever felt before. I’d been feeling so confused about objects randomly being moved and replaced when no one was home. The picture above the bed just confirmed that someone had been creeping into our house when none of us were home. I was constantly looking around checking everywhere. What if the person was hiding in our home? It was too much for me. My mum also called my uncle and he said he hadn’t been to our house in weeks. This made my mum and brother begin to take the situation very seriously.

After a few days of constant paranoia and anxiety the police officer reported that no one was seen going into our home at all. We just had to go about our normal lives but when we came home for the next few days again nothing had been moved or replaced. The paranoia eased a little however I was still terrified every time I came home from work that I’d see something bizarre.

A week after the picture incident the police said that they’d be removing the lookout from our street because there was no unusual activity. This made me feel horrible but the next day when I came home from work everything was normal in the house. This made me feel like the change of locks meant whoever this was couldn’t get in our house.

The day after I came home after a really tiring day of work. I was a little late however early enough that I should’ve been the first one home. I came home, opened the door, my dog greeted me with barks and to my surprise my brother and mum were already home. My mum’s car wasn’t in the driveway so I was confused.

I could see the back of their heads from the hallway as they sat on the couch watching some TV.

“Why are you guys home so early?”

\*no response\*

“Hellooooo”

\*still no response\*

“Are you guys deaf or something?!” I said as I walked into the living room approaching my brother and mum from behind.

As I got next to them I now realised that…I hadn’t been speaking to my mum or brother. This was 2 mannequins that were placed on my couch to make it look as though they were watching TV. My heart sank and I fell on my back after I realised what I was talking to. The most horrifying thing about it was the fact the mannequins were eerily similar in appearance to my mum and brother. The female mannequin had blonde hair and glasses and the male mannequin had earphones in, which my brother always wore to and from school on the bus.

I frantically ran out the house with my dog.

“No…no…no…no….no” I uttered to myself as I ran down the sidewalk. I fell to my knees and started to cry after making it a few houses down. I dropped my phone as I tried to rush it out my pocket to call my mum. “

“There’s no way my mum’s been replaced too. Her and my brother, no fucking way. Please no. Please no” I yelled in my head.

I called my mum

\*no answer\*

Called her a second time

\*no answer\*

I called her a third time.

The call almost went out but just as it reached the end there was an answer.

I didn’t hear anything for a few seconds. Out of nowhere I then hear:

“What is it? I’m in the car on my way home! You’re going to make me crash.”

I dropped my phone again when I heard my mum’s voice. I have never been so thankful in my life. A few mins later she showed up and I hugged her and told her not to go into the house. We called the police again and not long after my brother showed up. I gave him a large hug for the first time in what must’ve been years.

When the police showed up they investigated the house to see if there was anyone hiding in there but they found nothing. They were also very confused as to how this person or whatever had again broken into the house.

We’ve decided to stay at my uncle’s house whilst this whole situation unravels. It’s been a few days now and nothing else has happened but I’m still really afraid. I feel like I’m constantly being watched. What on Earth is happening in my house? Who is getting into it when we are all out? What do they want? We are all really afraid right now but thankfully my uncle’s house has provided some safety. We are all taking time off our jobs/school. God help us…

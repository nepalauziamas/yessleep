I remember feeling sick about to puke, my stomach hurt and my migraine was getting worse. I had woken up around one or two and couldn’t fall back asleep. It’s now 3:45  and I had to wake up at 5 to go to school. I could only think of one thing to do, go and wake my mom up. I wasn’t really sure what she would do but I had to do something. My suspicion was correct and she gave me a Tylenol and sent me on my way. It was fine though I expected as much. 

As I made my way back to my room. My dog usually sleeps on the couch so as I walked past I placed my hand down to pet her. But it just landed on the bare couch. I typically am not one to be afraid of the dark so I didn’t bother turning on the light to look for her as I figured she just slept in my parents room for the night. I shrugged it off closing my door and hopping into bed, it only took me a minute to realize that the couch was warm. A cold shiver sent down my spine. Was she watching me? Or in the same room? My dog absolutely adores being pet she would walk up to you anytime she could to get scratched behind the ears. 

Reasonably I thought she followed me into my parents room when I woke my mom up. But why didn’t I hear her? I have to walk through the living room and kitchen to get to my parents room as it is on the opposite side of my house. My kitchen has tile so surely I would have heard her claws clicking as she walked. But I didn’t. I lay in bed thinking of an explanation, I decided on she must of fell asleep on the other side of the room and didn’t wake up as I went past. Still odd she isn’t one to fall asleep quick and if the couch was warm as if she just moved. 

I fell asleep and woke up again with another wave of agony pulsing through my head; I checked the time, 4:12. I hadn’t been asleep long. I got up and made my way to my parents room. As I walked past the couch I rested my hand on it thinking maybe my dog moved back. Cold. The couch was cold. As I got to the kitchen standing there in the middle was Kayda, my Siberian Husky. Was she over here all along? Sleeping in the kitchen? I could only see her since she was standing by my sliding glass door which let in moon light. I wanted to pet her but for some reason I didn’t want to… something was off. She wasn’t moving just staring at me unblinking. 

She then tilted her head side ways and opened her mouth slightly. I watched in pure horror as her cheeks started to split open her lower jaw cracked and snapped into place almost sinking into her face, her lips were drawn back tearing away from her face making this horrifying smile. Her eyes started to bleed and were wide open. She took one step and that was brought to break me out of  my trace I bolted back to my room slamming the door locking it. Jumping into bed with my heart pounding wildly against my chest. What WAS that? That was DEFINITELY NOT, my dog. You may be thinking SMILE DOG, SMILE DOG. But it wasn’t, her teeth were still canine not human teeth so it couldn’t be smile dog. I checked the time once again 4:16. I was in tears backing against my wall unsure of what to do, where was MY dog, and what was that THING doing inside my house. 

Then I woke up. Huh? But I don’t remember falling asleep, I felt my face and my cheeks were still wet from crying. I was laying perfectly content in a different position from where I just was. I was hit with a wave of relief. That was all a dream! Thank god, my husky isn’t really some demon smile dog. I checked my phone 4:45. I got up on my way to go tell my mom about my tragic tale, as I walked past the couch I gingerly put my hand down and my hand struck fur. With a sigh of relief I pet her and continued on my way. I creaked the door open peeking inside the pitch black room, it was dead silent besides a faint cracking noise. squinting my eyes I made out a silhouette that seemed to be my mom, why was she standing? She didn’t seem to be facing me and I got creeped out so I sped walked back to my room forgetting to close the door. 

As I reached the couch, the glass door was letting in more moon light so I could just barley see, she was gone. Felt it to make sure and it was warm. I heard a foot step and I turned to see both my mom and dad starring at me. My eyes widened as more tears ran down my cheeks, they both had the same wide eyes with blood streaking down from their tear ducts. Both their cheeks were ripped up to their cheek bone with their lips that seemed to be torn off from their faces, forcing them to make the same horrid smile. I made a mad dash to my room but stopped short when I saw who was standing in the door way. My dog. 

Her smile looked more menacing and shook me to the core. All three of them began to slowly walk towards me, cornering me against a wall. I felt my face once again and glanced at my hand. It was red. I was never crying. I was bleeding. I was startled awake to my door knob being opened, I sat up quickly sweat running down my back, tears along my face. It was my mom, no smile, no blood, just a concerned face looking back at me. I wiped my face and looked at my hand, regular tears. I checked my phone 6:00. My mom saw how distraught I was and on the verge of throwing up, she let me stay home for school for the day. I tried to go back to bed but I just couldn’t, couldn’t get my dogs face out of my mind. I then heard the garage open and close as my parents left for work. It was around 7 at this time. Home alone until 5 just me and… my dog. 

I got up and went into the living room, there she was looking up at me from her spot on the couch, no smile. her tail wagged when she saw me, but I was still a bit unsure. I went back to my room, it was 7:30 when I started writing this. It’s now 9, still got the day to go let’s hope it really is all just a dream.

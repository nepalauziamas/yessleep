*My Dear Parents* 

*If you ever want to see me again, follow these instructions* 

Before I even read what the letter had to say, I balled it up and threw it into the corner. Then I curled up into a ball and started sobbing. 

My daughter Katie took her life a [few days ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/vrzgxi/my_daughter_has_a_secret_admirer_and_the_notes_he/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf), prodded by her secret admirer. 
My husband Garret and I found out about it and tried to stop it from happening, but we were too late. Perhaps we have been blind to what is happening in her life for longer than we realized. 

How could this happen? Our daughter had this secret life that we had never seen or simply ignored. 

Had I really been that busy, thinking that she was getting better? This whole damn time, I feel like I have been fooling myself. 

The worst part of this is, her secret admirer was a literal hellspawn. When I saw the demon that dragged her to the underworld, it shattered my worldview. I can’t describe how much I wish the things I experienced were fake, perhaps it would make the hurt a little easier. 

But now, this new letter has made things worse for me. It’s a somber reminder of what I did wrong as a mother, and it’s a false hope that I shouldn’t cling to. 

I knew without even looking at it that whatever terms that the devil was offering to me would be too great. 

My daughter was gone. I had to accept that. 

I sought solace at local churches, wandering from one part of town to another and asking if any pastor would hear my grief. Some were too busy, others weren’t sure what to make of the story. 

I wanted some kind of closure I guess, peace of mind to know that I did everything in my power for Katie. 

But none of them could offer anything close to that. 
Maybe that’s because I knew in my heart this *was* my fault, at least partially anyway. I have to accept some responsibility. 

I’ve been too worried, too controlling, too stifling. I should have listened more, cared more. Been there more. 
These are the thoughts that plague me daily. 

Maybe I didn’t deserve to keep living after all, when I had been so reckless with my daughter’s wellbeing. 
Garret certainly wasn’t making things easier. Like I said before, he is a shell of his former self. Hardly even bothering to really do much except eat, drink. Exist. He was pushing through but it felt like he wouldn’t last much longer. 

What if I lost him too? What if we were all swallowed by this tragedy?

Katie’s funeral was a small affair. A few of her school friends came and a few teachers. Family wasn’t able to fly in, but I really didn’t want more people there than necessary. Garret had agreed that we should have a few words said at the graveside, maybe to give us that closure we needed. 

I stood next to the edge of the pit, looking down at the casket as the midday summer sun beat down on me and wished I could throw myself into the hole. 

Instead, I wiped away a tear and read a poem that she had written for me as a little girl. It was hard to say it without a trembling voice. 

“Momma, I love you. More than the moon loves the stars. Momma I love you more than summer loves sun or winter loves snow. Momma I love you day and night and night and day. I guess it goes that way, cause momma I love you forever and ever.”

Then I tossed the note into the grave and stood back, being cradled by my husband. 

The rest of the funeral was a blur as others said their final goodbyes and we started to move away. 

I was just looking back one final time, almost fully at peace with what had happened when I saw a shadow lingering near the tombstone.  

Suddenly I couldn’t hold back my anger and pushed myself away from my husband, storming toward the tall figure. 

Somehow I knew what this shadow was, and as I got closer I confirmed it by seeing the yellowed eyes and pale skin. 
The demon looked almost human as he hunched near to the grave, looking down forlorn at the casket. 

“Leave us alone! Haven’t you hurt us enough!” I screamed. 

A few passerbys looked on in alarm, clearly wondering what my outburst was for. But I didn’t care. I really didn’t even worry about the demon ripping me to shreds right then and there. I just wanted this nightmare to end. 

The pale man stood up, his dead eyes straight on at me and let out a withered sigh. 

“I have a message for you,” the demon whispered. 

Garret was there by my side holding me back. 

“A message? What do you want?” he asked. 

“From your daughter. She is wanting to know why you have yet to follow her instructions,” the man responded. 

“What are you talking about?” Garret asked. 

I felt a twinge of guilt, I had never told Garret about the letter I found. 

“We aren’t interested,” I blurted out. 

The demon tilted his head, somehow amused by my anger. 

“You think you know how this story is going to go. You haven’t a clue. Read the letter. Then we will talk again,” he snapped back. Then he tossed a bit of dirt into the grave and walked away. 

I shuddered, the air suddenly feeling cold and dry as he left. 

“What was that about?” Garret asked. “What did he mean by a letter?” 

I meekly told him how Katie had contacted us from beyond the grave. I hoped that he would agree,  responding was a horrible idea. 

At first, he did. He was a little miffed I hadn’t shared this with him, but knew that any deal with a devil was a bad one. 

So we went home and tried our best to find sleep. 

But my dreams were troubled with flashes of Katie and the suffering she went through. And in the middle of the night I woke with a cold sweat, flushed and itchy. I looked down at my arms and saw scratches where I had involuntarily hurt myself and then noticed Garret wasn’t in bed. 

I climbed out in my night gown and called out his name. 

The house felt very dark as I stepped up and tried to find my way to the passage between our room and Katie’s. 

And I saw a dim light in her room. 

My heart beat a little faster as I hurried over there, opening the door and seeing him standing in the corner holding the letter. He had uncrumpled it and had just finished reading it when I walked in. 

“Beth. What *is* this?” he asked, his mouth dry as he struggled to find the words. 

His eyes were filled with fear. No, not just fear. 

A dread of things to come. 

I took it from him and ironed it out on Katie’s desk, reading it slowly from the top. 

*My Dear Parents* 

*If you ever want to see me again, follow these instructions*

*You think your souls are cleansed because mine is the one that was rot, but your own curse has just begun to ruin your lives. I know you just think it would be so simple if this all ended with a tragic accident. Happy family, torn to shreds by devil’s magick. But that isn’t how it’s going to go. Your life, your blood, is mine to control now. And you will do exactly as I say. Otherwise, I guarantee this will end up far worse than just a sad story about losing your daughter. If you want to know more, best respond before it’s too late for you.*

“I don’t understand. I don’t see any instructions there. Is there more to it than that?” Garret asked. 

My hands were shaking as I finished reading the letter. Katie had never sounded so full of hate and bitterness. What had this demon done to her? 

“I think we are supposed to write back,” I said. 

We debated the rest of the night whether to respond or not, all things considered this was not the way we had thought this was going to go. 

Katie or the devil wasn’t making a deal with us about our eternal souls. This sounded more like a threat. 

“But what is there that she would hate us for? I know we weren’t perfect parents… but this is bordering on outright menace and intimidation. Blackmail? It doesn’t make sense,” Garret said as he took a sleep aid and lay down. 

I told him I agreed. I told him that this was just to get us riled up and fall into the demon’s trap. 

But that wasn’t entirely true. 

After he fell asleep, I decided to write back. Place a letter in the mysterious box, and wait for a response. 

*My Dear Daughter* 

*I think we have left too many things unsaid between us. If this is what you want, to dig up old wounds; and it will help you find peace… then so be it. I’m offering my hand out to you. Let us see where the journey leads together.* 

I slipped into the box and sat on her bed, feeling like such a fool. How did this even work anyway? Would the letter magically appear somehow? Would I have to wait for a sign?

My answer came about an hour later after I had nodded off. I heard this strange scraping at the window. 

Scratching against the glass, sharp and repetitive. I jolted up and looked toward it, unsure what to do. 

Then I heard the scratching again. Except it was more delicate and deliberate. A knock. 

I stood up and moved to the window, pulling back the curtains and letting out a soft scream. 

The creature had the skull of a vulture, long and needle shaped, with a body that reminded me of a board and long bony protrusions out of its back that resembled ribs that just couldn’t fit into its gelatinous body. 

It opened its scaly mouth wide to show a barbed tongue and pressed against the window, demanding entrance. 

I took a step back, too scared to move as I heard the glass crack gently and realized that if I didn’t let it in, it would do so with force. 
Reluctantly I unlatched the window and jumped away. 
  
It’s feathers were dry and molting, crackling and falling off as it slid into the room like a cobra, hissing at me as I backed away into the corner. 

Then it moved toward the box where the letter was kept and used it’s bony spindly claws to pry it open, taking the letter I had written and pushing it down its throat. 

The creature stood there for a moment as it swallowed the paper, it’s hollow skull surveying the room and hissing violently. 

Then it started toward me, towering over me and repeatedly snarling a single word. 

“Payment. Payment. Payment.” 

“What do you want from me? I don’t have anything,” I said as I tried to protect myself witj my bare hands. 

It clutched my right wrist and used its beak to make a mark in my vein, spilling blood out against its bone and then licking it up. 

The barbs of the tongue reminded me of walking on hot coals. Satisfied, the creature fumbled toward the window and cawed excitedly. 

It’s bones crunched and contracted and constricted it’s body until it was the size of a normal bird and it flew out of the window, it’s shrieks filling the night air as I found air to breathe again. 

I looked down at my wrist and covered the scratch. Garret couldn’t know about this. Not until I learned more. 

Getting up off the floor, I went to the box, expecting a new letter from Katie to be there to hear her demands. 

But it was empty. 
 Disappointed and confused, I stumbled to the bathroom to find some gauze for my scratch and decided to take a shower. The unworldly feeling of being near that demon spawn had left me reeling and I just wanted to relax and get back to bed. 

Just as I started to rinse my hair I heard something outside the shower and froze in place. 

“Garret?” I asked. There was no response. 

I saw something behind the steam of the shower, a blur on the other side of the mirror. It wasn’t my reflection, it was too short. 

Katie, I realized. The room was suddenly very still and cold. 

I watched silently as she wrote me a message using the fog on the glass. 

Everything I had dreaded from her first message was confirmed in that moment as I read her new warning. 

**I KNOW YOUR SINS.**

They came on a Saturday afternoon so hot that all we could do was watch the flowers wilt and thank God for central air. The older one rang the doorbell and smiled in his immaculate short-sleeved white shirt and cheap black tie. A uniform of momentary inconvenience, probably for both of us. 

“Who is it, honey?”—my wife, Kate, occupied with the baby while our six year old, Camille, hummed and colored in the living room. 

“Mormons,” I answered. 

“Be nice, Jack.”

“Yeah. Will do.”

I opened the door and right away the heat pummeled, licking sweat onto my face the way an excitable St. Bernard might. I say *I* opened the door, but *Elder Todd* was really the one who answered it. 

“Hi! And a very pleasant afternoon to you. Gosh, what a wonderful neighborhood you live in—truly a blessing to have so much grass.” He chuckled. “Anyway, I’m Elder Todd and I have a story of God to share. Have you heard of the Church of Latterday Saints, sir?”

Deep breath, big pageant smile, blue eyes sparkling beneath a drooping lock of wet blond hair. This guy was somebody’s poster boy for dedicated evangelism, a gold star sticker masquerading as a door-to-door God salesman.  His partner was decidedly less chipper.  He lay on our porch in the fetal position, so sweaty I could see his armpit hair through his shirt. 

“Fuck. Is he okay? He doesn’t look okay…”

Elder Todd’s ten-thousand watt smile fizzled into concern. 

“He’s had a long day, we both have, but the sun is shining and the sky is blue! Right?” His smile returned, though stripped of some of the showmanship it’d started with. “Truly a wonderful neighborhood...”

Jesus Fucking Christ. 

“Um, maybe I could get him a glass of water? Or call someone? Did you two drive? You must’ve right?” 

I found myself mentally grasping at garbled tenets of a half dozen backwaters of Christian faith. Mormons drove, didn’t they? It was the Amish who had the horses and buggies. Or was it Mennonites? Wait, what was the difference? Fuck—not relevant. Mormons drove; I was at least seventy percent certain of that. 

Todd looked down at his sweaty companion, competing with my uncertainty, lines cutting across his forehead. Then his eyes rejoined mine and left just as quickly, sliding past me and over my shoulder. 

“Oh, hi. I hope my husband Jack has been—,” Kate slipped into the doorway beside me, our son Harrison cradled in her arms. She gasped at the sight of the other Mormon. Todd kept smiling dutifully, Camille kept humming obliviously. “—Jesus, is he okay? What happened? Do you—do you two boys wanna come inside for a minute? It’s sweltering out there.”

Todd shifted on his feet and nervously twisted a dangling strap on his backpack. I wondered, unhelpfully if the Mormon church was perhaps in the backpack manufacturing business or if they just bought everything in bulk. Kate brought me back to the moment with a prodding elbow. 

“Uh—oh, right—yeah, of course. You two should come in. Just until he—ya know—gets back on his feet.”

The sparkle in Todd’s eyes returned. “Oh, as long as it’s not an imposition, sir—ma’am.”

I sighed. “No. Not at all. I’ll help you get him inside.”

Todd’s companion was Elder Marshall, he was eighteen, bound for Brigham Young University in the fall and he had a lovely tenor when he saw fit to sing—all things I learned second hand. Todd liked to chatter away, apparently. Marshall was barely conscious, but a minute later he was at least lively enough to sip at a glass of water. Camille eyed him curiously, abandoning her coloring for the intrigue of our impromptu clinic. 

“Daddy, is he sick?”

“Um, honey, he’s—“

“Blessed,” Todd interrupted. “To have found good Samaritans like your mommy and daddy.” He beamed at Camille as Kate rocked Harrison in an armchair. Camille smiled back shyly. 

“Say, Jack, could I trouble you for a glass of milk if you’ve got it?”  Todd asked abruptly. 

Milk? Fucking hell, Todd was truly a parody of wholesomeness. 

“Sure, *Todd*.  Our kitchen’s in the basement—old house. I’ll be right back. And mind your manners, Camille.”

Camille balked defensively and I went down for a glass of milk. 

While I was getting it, I heard the shuffling of feet upstairs, Camille showing off for our guests, no doubt, skipping rope or doing cartwheels. Kate’s voice rose in a indistinct chiding squawk following a thump. Camille didn’t cry though, so I shook my head and chuckled to myself. What Elder Todd must think…he was probably smiling, complementing us on our *wonderful* carpet or something. As long as he wasn’t giving a sermon on the virtues of polygamy or…hrmmm….

I hurried back upstairs. “Hey Todd, I got your—“

I stopped. Our front door was wide open and Todd sat where he had been on the sofa, smiling, hair collected out of his face yet still dark with sweat. But Kate and the kids had left. So had Marshall. 

“Oh—thank you, Jack. I know it’s a bother, but I go to milk in times of stress. There really is no better refreshment on God’s green earth.”

Incorrect. But in a way, entirely expected. Still, I narrowed my eyes at the absurdity of the statement. 

“Uh-huh—hey, did my wife and daughter go outside?”

Todd sipped then glugged the glass down before answering. 

“Yep. They went to show Elder Marshall the garden. He’s feeling much better.  You know, you really do have a beautiful family.”

Todd spread out his arms and sunk back into the sofa, smiling contentedly as he shut his eyes. 

“Great. Thanks,” I said, discomforted by Todd’s comfort. “Well, you’ve probably got a lot of houses to get to.  And it’s almost Harrison’s nap time, so…”

I had made my way to the door, standing hopefully like some border collie at the paddock. Todd kept his eyes shut and began merrily tapping his fingers on the sofa back. 

I cleared my throat. 

No acknowledgement. *Rap-a-tap-tap*

Was he waiting for Kate and the kids? Did he really think that after we nursed his friend back to health, that we were also gonna sit through his timeshare presentation on Yankee Doodle Jesus?  Maybe Kate was nice enough for something like that, but I sure as hell wasn’t. 

“Hey Todd, I’m glad your friend is feeling better but it’s about time to—“ I halted my bum rush. I had heard a sound. Footsteps. 

*Upstairs*.

“Katie? Are you still in the house?—Todd, I thought you said that—“

“Yeah Jack, just—just doing nap time,” she answered thinly. “Every…things…fine.”

Everything didn’t sound fine. 

“Todd! Wake the fuck up. Kate, are you okay?”  I started for the stairs and saw Kate making her descent, slowly, unsteadily.

“Kate—what’s wrong? Where are the kids?  Where’s Marsh—“

“Jack, stop. The kids are—they’re—Mormons now.  M-me too, Elder Todd.”

Kate was pale, shaking, but smiling uneasily back at Todd who was now watching her with one open eye as the rest of him remained serene and unchanged. 

“Glad to hear it, Sister Paulson,” he said. *Tap-a-ta-tap*

Oh…fuck this. I moved toward Kate and when I was close enough, I whispered, “what the fuck is going on?”

“Jack, I’m not supposed to say—“

She looked like she was about to cry. And then a squeak on the stairs above struck the distress from her face and replaced it with something worse. It was a look I’d only seen once before, on a day when we had taken Camille to the Emergency Room. Kate grabbed my arm, squeezed. 

“Just keep smiling, Jack. You just need to smile.”  She was gritting her teeth.

It was in that moment that I noticed the blood clinging to her dark hair and the torn earlobe that had put it there. She was missing an earring, but she was still smiling. The vague strain of everything made me feel queasy—the urgent fear in Kate’s eyes, *I’m not supposed to say*—say what?

“Jack, fucking smile. Please…”

I grimaced. The stairs resumed their squeaking. Kate shuddered. Then I looked upwards and saw a man walking down the stairs—not Elder Marshall, a stranger wearing a drab black suit that wouldn’t have looked out of place on the Titanic and a sharp smile that falsely offered kindness. 

“Who the fuck are you?!”

“Jack! Smile!”

I couldn’t bring myself to heed Kate’s warning, not as the man plodded toward me, standing between me and my children. I stood firm, trying to muster strength in spite of the confusion. But I wasn’t ready. The man’s hand was quick, a little magician’s flourish, and I didn’t immediately feel the pain in my face, but I saw the blood on his straight razor as he folded the blade. His smile never faltered. 

I staggered backwards, losing my footing on a stair and knocking my head against the Newell post as I fell. Kate shrieked and the man grabbed her by the hair and dragged her into the living room. She’d stopped smiling for just a moment. Now she was weeping and I was dazed. 

I tried to stand but my head weighed my body down. Another squeak on the stairs. My vision blurred as I tried to resolve a new figure above me—a black haired boy wearing long white shorts and nothing else, smiling unnaturally wide. He stood for a moment, watching me, giggling softly. Kate was screaming, her voice receding away. The boy began to mince giddily on the landing above me, shaking his fists excitedly beneath his chin. Then suddenly he tore down the stairs toward me. I raised my arms over my face; I couldn’t think of anything else to do but shout. 

“STOP—“

The boy jumped when he was three stairs from the bottom, vaulted over my legs and landed squarely on my chest. I heard a crack and heaved out a bloody breath. The boy bounded off me, nearly fell, but caught himself and skittered away. 

*Fuck*... Who were these people?—*wheeze*—How many of them were in my house?—*wheeeze*—What did they want?  

I watched helplessly, crumpled and bleeding, as the boy scuttled beneath our sofa. He peered out from the darkness below it and I shivered seeing those quiet watchful eyes. Todd kept up his easy smile, kept tapping, as though all the terror around him was somehow distant, unimportant. Kate’s screams mingled with chugging sobs, somewhere unseen. I tried to move and my body screamed with her, harmonizing my pain with something horrible. I couldn’t help her. I couldn’t help my children. My cell phone lay on a side table next to Todd. No help—so I wept and wheezed and the sting of the slash on my face began to grow. Why was this happening to us?

I closed my eyes and tried to ignore Kate’s screams and the utter silence of my children upstairs. It felt like resignation, like a betrayal of the people I loved. The sting of that burrowed into my mind more palpably than the trickle of blood on my cheek. 

“Life is easier when you smile, Jack.”  Todd’s voice above me. I didn’t want to see his face. “The Prophet will put a smile back on Kate’s face. Elder Smith is very good with those of wavering faith.”

The Prophet? Elder Smith? He couldn’t be serious. 

“You—you’re not—*wheeze*—Mormons.”  My voice came out as a whisper. 

“He’ll help your faith too, Jack. Do not fall to envy over the blessings your family receives while you are sleeping. Simply wake and see God in the light.” Kate was no longer screaming, just sobbing quietly. And I felt fingers on my eyelids. “Simply wake, Jack.”  He pulled open my eyes with his fingers. “Look.”  

I saw a blur of Kate stumbling in, led by the man in black—Elder Smith. With his straight posture and top hat, he towered over Kate’s slumped form. 

“You must have questions,” Todd whispered in my ear. “I know I would. But you will soon know so much. Your kindness was prophesied. And your family will be the vessel for God’s wisdom. Your lovely, beautiful family.”

Todd stroked my left eyeball with his finger and moaned quietly. I blinked just as Kate’s torn dress was becoming clear.  Her hollow stare didn’t meet my eyes, but her mouth was trying to smile. 

“Alright, Jack. On with the miracles.”  

Todd grabbed my arms and dragged me across the floor. I gasped at the jolt of pain and my throat gurgled. When I got to Kate, she was whispering something. 

“*We’re not going to hurt you. We’re not going to hurt you. We’re not going to hurt you. Just smile pretty. We’re not going to hurt you.*”

She shied away as I reached for her and my hateful gaze landed on Elder Smith. He in turn gaped gleefully back at me, the apples of his cheeks firming into grotesque joy. And then he took off his top hat and set it gently on the ground.

“Go on, sister Paulson,” Todd cooed. “Look into the hat and tell us the revelation of God.”

Kate was despondent, repeating her comforting lie again and again. But she shrieked as Elder Smith’s hand found the back of her neck. She struggled as he forced her head down toward the hat’s yawning opening. Strangely, I swore I could see light on her face before it disappeared; an oddity drowned in waves of dread and helpless fear. A moment later, she was sobbing again, thrashing as her pinned head deformed the hat. 

“Tell us what you see, sister Paulson!” Todd shouted. I heard a shuffle as his voice rose. I looked and saw the boy emerging from underneath the sofa. He grabbed my leg, giggled, and bit into my calf. I yelped, kicked him away and he wailed as he slid back into the darkness. 

Who the fuck were these people? Where were my children? *Why*?  

I grabbed at my calf and was punished for the movement with a fierce stab in my rib cage. I could barely breathe, punctured lung I guessed, but the adrenaline kept me woefully lucid. Too lucid for the look of pallid terror on Kate’s face as she lifted her head. This time her gaze did meet mine and I shrunk away. 

“K-Kate?”

“They said they wouldn’t hurt them. I would’ve fought, Jack. They said they wouldn’t—“

I looked up toward the ceiling, to the beams and boards and vestigial knob and tube wiring that we had once found charming in a rustic sort of way. A stain now spread along the wood. And by some grim coincidence, that moment was the one where the first drop of blood stretched and fell from the ceiling. Just below the bedroom our children shared. 

“Your turn, Jack!” Todd pipped. 

Kate cowered and shook. I tried to fight as Elder Smith and Elder Todd dragged me to the hat. But I looked. And saw a phone inside of it—the familiar interface of a FaceTime call; a bedroom, blood, the smiling face of Elder Marshall and an unmoving heap I didn’t want to be familiar. The children had been so quiet. Even Harrison hadn’t made a sound. 

Elder Smith’s hand slipped into the hat, swiped away the video and left a Google doc in its place. 

“Read the words of prophecy,” he said softly. “Write the words of the herald angel and be blessed.”

Elder Todd set a laptop in front of me. He had it opened to Reddit. And I began to type this story. 

So spake the Angel to the new prophet of God, Jack Paulson. So sprung the font of blood, of salvation, from above to rain down and cleanse us of sin. Have ye faith in the stranger that comes to your door in need.  He will deliver you. Amen. 

EDIT: They’re praying now, watching the blood. Only parts of this story are true, the parts they planned and the parts they forced. The reality is worse. 

I live in Flagstaff Arizona. Do not try and help me. Our neighbors did. They heard the screams. Now everything is quiet. 

THEY ARE NOT MORMONS.

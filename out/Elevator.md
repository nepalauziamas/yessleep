It had been a boozy, bleary kind of weekend when I met Amanda. At least that’s what I think her name was. It might have been Miranda or something, but whatever it was we hit it off pretty quick in that hotel casino bar. I remember she was wearing this short, sequined black dress that made her look like feminine dynamite. 

Well, one thing led to another and we were soon stumbling through the halls on the way back to her room, until we ended up at an elevator. Although some of the details are fuzzy, I remember it wasn’t part of the primary set of elevators for the hotel. It was kind of off by itself, but we were too enamored with each other to care. 

I must have hit the “up” button because the doors slid open, revealing an elevator operator standing in the front-left corner. Correct: the hotel casino was one of those gimmicky ones that employed uniformed elevator operators. I’d gotten a good deal on my room, although—in retrospect—I’m not sure how good a deal it was, considering my gambling losses.

The operator was wearing a green uniform with gold trim, including one of those tasseled, flat-topped hats. A fez? “Floor, sir?” he asked in a gravelly, disinterested voice. Amanda/Miranda gave him her floor number—let’s say it was six—and off we went. We were probably 40-60%...fused…by that point, in a state of near-total indecency.

We went up. We went up for a LONG time…or at least it seemed so. When Amanda and my passions hit a lull, I realized we were STILL on the elevator; the operator was just silently staring ahead at the panel of buttons. 

“Uh…what’s taking so long?” I asked. He didn’t answer, so I started to get angry.  “Hey, man! Didn’t you hear me?” I demanded loudly. Amanda rubbed my arm to calm me down. “We’ve been on this elevator forever. Why’s it taking so long?”

He looked at me in his bored, disinterested manner. “It’s only been a minute, sir. We’ll be there shortly. Apologies for the inconvenience.” A glance at my watch showed that he was telling the truth. Still, my buzz had taken a major hit.

We continued to go up. I knew we were moving; I could feel it. From what I could tell, we were rising pretty quickly, as I could hear *sounds* coming from some of the floors we passed. Some even sounded human.

Another minute/hour passed; Amanda started to hyperventilate. Apparently claustrophobic, she began to claw desperately at the walls.

“I have to…I have to g-g-get off this th-thing,” she panted. The operator unhurriedly said he would try to stop it, but he wasn’t certain he could. As he flipped open a panel, we continued to ascend, faster and faster. 

When we stopped, it was sudden.

Amanda and I collapsed in a heap. A moment later, the door was jerked open, manually, by an unseen individual. It seemed we were between floors, as a large, black gap filled only the lower half of the elevator. 

Suddenly and without warning, a pair of muscular, hairy arms seized Amanda’s legs and yanked her, screaming, into the darkness, her hands unable to grip the smooth elevator floor. It all happened so fast that I had no time to react before the doors banged closed and the elevator began to rise again.

“Hey! Hey, stop it!” I yelled, seizing the operator’s arms and shaking him. “Stop this thing!”

He made no move, but the elevator stopped with a noticeable *ding*.

“Sixth floor, sir,” he announced, unfazed. “Please watch your step.” Stunned, I stumbled off and stared stupidly as the doors closed behind me.    

Then my senses returned. The door to the stairwell was to the right, so I slammed it open and made my way down the dimly-lit stairs. The fifth floor was surprisingly well lit. There was not a trace of Amanda to be found. Not long after my fevered search, I blacked out. 

I must have banged my head up something fierce, because when I awoke the next morning—on the plane back to my hometown—I had a large, throbbing knot on my forehead and didn’t know how I’d gotten there. After landing, my attempts to contact the hotel were fruitless. I continued for two more days until I finally made it through to the front desk. They  denied having anyone named Amanda or Miranda lodging with them over that weekend, and did not recognize my poor description of the elevator operator and even mentioned that they only had the one set of elevators in operation; the others being in an area under renovation.

I never saw or heard from Amanda again; the hotel closed down shortly afterward. I think it’s a Hard Rock now. 

Well, that’s not entirely the truth. I MIGHT have heard something.

It was about a month later when I got the call. I didn’t recognize the number. 

“Hello?” I answered.

No reply…just static.

“Hello?”

Still nothing, but in the background I heard an elevator ding. Then the call went dead.

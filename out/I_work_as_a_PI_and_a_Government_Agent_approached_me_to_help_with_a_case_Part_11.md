When I woke up, my shoulder like it was on fire and my head throbbing. My left eye forced shut by blood coming from a cut on my forehead. I sat suspended off the ground by something I assumed to be a hammock. When I noticed what broke my fall, I shrieked and struggled free. I crashed down to the ground, my shoulder screaming in pain but it worth not being tangled up in some oversized spiderwebs. My panic overrode my sense of pain. I scanned the entire room looking for Gregory. When I did a triple take of the empty room, I forced myself to look at the hole in the ceiling.  

“Nick! Stay there ok! I’ll find my way back up!” I shouted into the darkness.

No answer came. I started to worry that now that I wasn’t near Nick for him to have something to focus on, he already wouldn’t know where he stood. I didn’t know if this place messed with him so badly that even if he stood still, he could get lost. The moment he moved I might not be able to find him again. 

First, I needed to get to the center and find the stairs up. I couldn’t have fallen too far if I wasn’t harmed from the fall. Starting to the right I opened the door not even looking around the new room. If I hit a dead end, I would go the other way until I found the stairs. As I moved, I called Nick’s name hoping he heard me. This place creepy as hell and I didn’t enjoy the idea of a giant spider ready to jump out from the dark at any moment.  

As I went through room after room, I didn’t bother with the other doors in the direction I wasn’t moving in. Then, somehow, I walked right into the room I started at. I got confused. It was possible I went going in a circle instead of towards the stairs or to where the line of doors ended. Just in case, I picked up a sharp rock and walked over to the door in the opposite direction I came from. I marked an X on the stone doorframe and did the same with each door I walked through. This way I would know which one I’ve already entered because all the rooms looked the same. 

I carried on feeling as if I made some progress. I was about to mark a frame when an X made me stop. For a moment I thought I already been there. But this X drawn inside a circle. I wasn’t the one who made that mark. Brushing aside dust I saw more faint markings further down the frame. Almost child height. Dread started to pool in my stomach. Now that I noticed that marking, I was starting to see more of them. 

Under the dust, someone a long time ago was lost and marked their way. But the problem being, the markings over lapped. As if they came into the room again, and couldn’t see their old marker, then placed a new one. After seeing them, I knew what happened to Nick. This place made it impossible for him to recognize or remember what each room looked like. Even if he’d been there before, even if he marked it before, each was a new room to him. Every step a new place. How long was he lost for? How long did he wander in this place trying to get free? Did he find the center and look up to the far-off glass ceiling and just pray that someday he would make it there?

I shook my head trying to clear my thoughts. I didn’t want to think about the torment my partner went through. The Catacombs kept showing me signs of his past. I wanted to ignore them in order to focus on finding him, but what remained behind made it impossible.  

I kept walking in one direction. I stopped, looking at a door and my heart nearly jumped out of my chest. A wooden door had two thick beams placed across it as if trying to keep something inside. There was a crack in the door and through it, a small pale hand hanging limply. It child size and aside from being pale, didn’t appear decomposed. My mind thought whoever it belonged to might still be alive. I didn’t think. I rushed over to lift the beams free trying to get into that room. Dust clogged the air causing me to cough violently but I still pushed on. After the second beam got free, I dumped it on the ground to yank open the door.  

I expected to see a person on the other end, but instead a severed cracked arm came with the door. I choked at the sight thinking I was seeing part of a dead child. When I could be able to look at it again, I noticed that the arm actually broken off where it ended. It so pale because it been made of marble or some sort of similar stone.  

Recovering from my shock, I looked inside the room only to let out a gasp at the sight. Piles of cracked and small broken bodies filled the room. They looked so frail. I didn't understand why anyone would sculpt so many realistic children only to toss them aside. Through some cracks on their broken faces I saw glimmers of red, as if under their pale surface each body really made up of ruby. Due to the sheer mass, I didn’t notice the most horrifying fact right away. Each of them looked similar to Nick.  

I only took a step into the room to see better. The similarity sunk in and I froze. My footing  uneven. Looking down I saw that there were countless gouges in the floor and on the inside of the door. Each scratch looked as if it been made by small fingernails. The truth clicked in my head and my stomach twisted.  

I was going to be sick. Rushing out, I stumbled on an old vase to puke up the quiche Nick cooked. It not pleasant coming back up. 

All of those bodies were alive at some point. Not just some sculpture or sick art project. The bastard that created Nick made so many before him. When they didn’t live up to his expectations, he dumped them in that room and locked them away. How long did it take them to die? How many were placed in there at once? Were they alone as they clawed, trying to get free or did they have to watch each other die? Another thought came to mind that made me nearly get sick again. Did Nick ever see this room? 

This place lived up to its name. It really was a tomb. 

I wasn’t able to dwell on everything I’d seen. A sound came from behind me and I thought that by some miracle Nick found his way to me. Instead, Gregory the one who found me first. 

I know Nickie can’t lie. It's just not something he would ever think of doing. But the fact that Gregory only was the size of a dinner plate was bullshit. Her body so big she could barely fit inside the door. She froze when I looked at her. We must have both startled each other. I did the only thing a reasonable person staring at a spider taking up an entire doorway, nearly halfway inside the room would react. I screamed like a five-year-old girl and ran. 

Due to her size, Gregory couldn’t keep up but she tried her best. Pressing her body through the archways, she chased me as I ran without thinking. Her long legs trying to curl around my waist. My chest hurt from running so hard and so fast. If I didn’t lose her soon, I wasn’t going to make it. 

A closed door stood in my way and I just slammed my good shoulder into it causing the old wood to explode. I stumbled losing some ground, but just kept going. Spiders are the only thing that could get me so motivated to run. Just as I started to feel dizzy from running so frantically, I stopped hearing Gregory behind me. 

I stopped, wheezing, and my throat tasting like blood. I could have died from running away from the spider instead of her killing me. I jumped, spooking myself thinking I was seeing things out of the corner of my eyes, but it just black shapes caused by the lack of oxygen to my brain.  

I got led into a false sense of security. My plan to redouble my efforts of finding Nick and getting the hell out of there. All of those ideas came crashing down literally from the ceiling. I jumped out of the way when a few bricks fell. Gregory came tumbling down, dust from the bricks blinding me. When I could see, I found her on top of me. 

A deadly looking stinger inches away from my stomach. Some liquid dripped from it, cooling my shirt. Fear froze my body as the massive spider jabbed the thin needle tip into my stomach. My muscles tensed up painfully. Unable to do a damn thing to save myself, I fell into a deep darkness. 

My eyes opened. To my confusion I wasn’t in the Catacombs, but rather in a forest. This couldn't be right. But it felt so real. I kept telling my brain I wasn’t really there, that somehow, I was dreaming. My mind didn’t care if I was dreaming or not when I heard a familiar laughing coming from the dark trees.  

The Witch from our first case a few feet away. Her form growing and twisting. I ran, but my feet didn’t move fast enough. Not matter how hard I pushed the trees surrounding me didn’t move. I kept repeating that this could not be happening. When a sharp claw slammed against my back, tearing the flesh I was no longer convinced this was a nightmare. I screamed in pain and the darkness overtook my sight again. 

This time I woke up on the dark beach from the last case. I jolted up, my shoulder in pain. Within seconds I spotted Nick. This time not just his face was ruined but also his stomach torn open. I became beyond any kind of rational thought. I screamed until my throat felt raw. My voice cut off by a sound I knew. A sound I hated and never wanted to hear again. The twin lizard's laughter carried over the beach. 

I wanted to run but my legs wouldn’t listen. I sent desperate signals to stand up before the pair found me. But I stayed sitting. A pair of claws wrapped under my arms as the younger brother lizard appeared from thin air in front. The older held me down as his brother reached over to rip my jacket to shreds. I thrashed my legs, trying to get free. I didn’t want those bastards to touch me. I couldn’t stand being there. I was crying and screaming nonsense when someone calling my name cut through my frantic state. 

“Skyler, Skyler? Wake up. Hey, it’s alright. It’s just a nightmare.” 

Coming out of the nightmare felt like swimming through molasses. Gasping, I  still screamed as my eyes opened to see I was still in The Catacombs. Nick was sitting next to me, his face creased with worry. It took me a long while before I calmed down. Nick was patting my back, unsure of what to do. It hurt my shoulder but I let him continue.   

“W-what...” My throat raw making it hard to speak. 

When a spider leg wrapped itself around Nick’s neck, I screamed again hurting myself again. He raised his hands trying to calm me down as Gregory skittered back a little. 

“She’s friendly, I swear. Her venom should have only put you to sleep. In rare cases it can give people vivid nightmares. She just wanted you to stay still so she could bring me over to you.” Nick explained keeping his tone gentle. 

I still choked on fear. Still, I wanted to trust Nick. It’s not his fault I was deathly afraid of spiders. Gregory looked tense. I could tell she felt bad for my reaction to the venom. If I just stood still when she found me to start with, she wouldn’t have done something so desperate. She kept creeping closer and my skin crawled. My brain telling me she was friendly but I still wanted to get as far away as possible. She reached out a front leg, holding it in the air. It a sign of friendship. Pushing back my fear, I reached out to touch her soft tip of her leg. Nick looked a bit happy we were all getting along. I brought my hand back, and needed to stop myself from wiping my hand on my pants.  

“I’m sorry, this was all my mistake. I thought Gregory was a different species. I wasn’t aware she would grow to this size, or what kind of environment she preferred. It's no wonder why she found her way down here. I wasn’t taking care of her properly...” 

I had already forgiven Nick for everything. None of this was his fault. I had a terrible experience and I still shook but I would never blame my partner.  

“It’s fine. Gregory still likes you. I do too. Now that we all found each other, I think it’s about time to get the hell out of here.” 

Nick gave me the smallest hint of a smile. Our ribbon destroyed and I didn’t know how I was going to guide him out besides holding his hand. Gregory solved that problem. She got low and Nick crawled between her head and her body. She started to move hunching down so they could both fit through the door.  

“Do you want to come up here too?” Nick offered. 

I gave him a hard no. I was not going to touch Gregory again if I could help it. She knew the way out. In a few minutes we came out of the last door and into the center. I followed behind as Gregory started up the spiral stairway. There was no railing and I needed to go slowly. Her spider legs stuck to the sides and she had no issues climbing up. Each step she made echoed through the air and it made my skin crawl and shoulders tense.  

I didn’t relax until we stood on the glass circle that raised us back to the house. Nick got down from Gregory and she scurried off through the still open doorway. My stomach still uneasy from the trip. The sun above setting making the glass covered room appear orange. Looking over at Nick I thought of everything I’d seen below. He started to walk away but I stopped him by grabbing his shoulder. 

“Nickie, you're my friend and I love you but I lied. I can’t deal with spiders.” I said, sounded exhausted. 

“We’re friends?” Nick asked in an honest tone. 

Unable to help myself, I pulled him into a hug. His arms hovered at his side, unsure of what to do.  

“What is this for...?” He asked. 

“No reason. I just felt like doing it.” I replied.  

After our awkward exchange, I let him lead me out of the room. I very ready to head home to rest. Nick could tell. He brought me to the door, dirty and exhausted. Before I left, he went to the kitchen to pack up some quiches to send home with me. When he returned, he had two fabric grocery bags of quiche. I needed to buy a bigger freezer if I was going to keep all of these. A knock at the door made us both jump. 

Nick answered the door, and Aberash came inside. She happily greeted him, but looked confused at what I could be doing there. Gregory a creature that Nick might have adopted without anyone knowing. Aberash must never know what I was really got called over for.

“Hey Skyler, I wanted to talk to you about something so it’s good you’re both here. You’ll hear about it all when Nick comes back to work either way. But it’s a little personal so I don’t know if I should tell you with Nick here, or if you want to do it privately and then decide how you want to tell Nick.” Aberash stated, and I had no idea what she was talking about. 

“Did you come here just to give us some news? I didn’t think you could get off work for a personal issue.” Nick said looking as confused as I felt. 

“Well...” Aberash started looking a bit embarrassed. “I got suspended for three days because I broke Ancaer’s nose.”  

I could understand anyone wanting to break that man’s face. But I didn’t think she was the type. I always assumed she would handle situations in more of a clever way.  

“Good for you, but why though?” I chipped in. 

“It has to do with why I’m here. Ancaer is really against humans. He finally read over your forms you filled out to be Nick’s occasional partner. He was raging down the hallway screaming about how we can’t trust humans because they’re liars. I honestly thought he was going to find you and hurt you. I stopped him by slamming a chair into his face and broke his nose.” 

I wanted to laugh at the mental image. But I didn’t know what got Ancaer so riled up about. Thinking back, I didn’t know what on Earth I lied about on those simple forms. Then it came to me all at once. Something I’d hadn’t told Nick yet and hated speaking about. I didn’t know how he would react to the news. Looking over at him, I got ready for my partner to take the truth poorly. 

“Was he so upset because I checked off male on the gender box?” I asked Aberash. 

She nodded with a long sigh.  

“Ancaer is such a raging dick. I wish I broke more than his nose.” 

We both waited for Nick to say something. His brain working overtime behind his neutral expression. Finally, he raised a hand as if in class asking a question. 

“I don’t understand why Ancaer thought you were lying.” He stated. 

My stomach fluttered. Gathering up a bit of courage, I told him something I had wanted to avoid for as long as possible. 

“I was born female. I’m in the middle of transitioning. I still need one more surgery, but even if I am able to get it, some people won’t ever consider me to be male.” 

I flinched at my own words and waited. Out from his baggy pants came a notebook he frantically flipped through trying to find answers to a question he had yet to ask. We patiently waited for him to figure out what he wanted to ask. 

“I must have misunderstood how humans understood sex and gender. I always assumed a human has a biological sex. Male, female, or intersex. I had also assumed gender is a different thing and is in more of a spectrum and fluid, possibly? I still don’t know everything about human genders. If the forms asked your gender and you said male, it’s not a lie, correct? If it was labeled sex, I could almost understand why Ancaer could be so upset, but I don’t see why he would be so angry over something minor.” 

I honestly wasn’t expecting Nick’s response. He seemed clueless about so many other things, so I’d assumed someone being transgender might be too confusing for him. But he understood it better than most people I’ve spoken with about this topic. A crash from the kitchen took his attention away. 

“Oh. Charles is getting into something. I’ll go clean that up. Aberash, I’ll pack you some food as well.”  

Nick left us behind, and I felt a little stunned. 

“That went... well.” I said finally. 

Aberash gave a small laugh. She’d known Nick for longer and didn’t have the same kind of stress I did. She knew how he would react. 

“Nick has always had a fluid way of thinking. He’s always pretty accepting. There is a lot of stuff he doesn’t know but we went over the whole gender thing when he tried buying his own work shoes.” 

That explained why Nick had no issues walking around in heels. I felt relieved that the one thing I’d sort of had been hiding came out into the open. Aberash was on my side, and Nick didn’t see me in a different way. He came back with two more tote bags for Aberash who looked excited.  

“Skyler, what are you doing here anyway?” She asked. 

As if on cue, Gregory came running across the front room in plain sight. Nick had his back turned but his face paled a little. Aberash looked from between him and me. Judging from her expression, Nickie really shouldn’t own a giant spider.  

“Aberash, could you get Skyler home for me?” Nick asked at the same time he was pushing us out of the door.  

“Was that-” She started. Nick had us both out and the door closed in a matter of seconds. 

We both were left on the front steps, weighed down by quiche. Luckily, Aberash dropped the spider issue. She walked me to her car that also had tinted windows. I sat in the front seat but for some reason I couldn’t see out the windshield, though she was able to see just fine. Even though we were partners, I couldn't know where Nick lived.  

She started down the long driveway, casting glances over my torn clothing and my face, still bloody from the cut. She knew I’d been down in The Catacombs but wasn’t going to bring it up. 

“I’m glad you and Nick are getting along. He's really brightened up since working with you. After what happened to his last partner, I assumed he wouldn’t recover.” 

Rain started to hit the windows. I didn’t even notice grey clouds before I got into her car.  

“I don’t know anything about his last partner. I know she died, but what really happened.” I asked, not expecting answers. 

“She went feral. He was forced to kill her.” 

My heart sank and my mouth went dry. I didn’t want to hear those words. After everything else Nickie went though, having to kill his partner wasn’t right. He kept her cellphone and the charms. It was clear he cared about her a great deal. It was just... Unfair. Aberash let me sit in silence, looking a bit sorry about what she told me. 

“It’s the reason why the agents work in pairs. Going feral isn’t that rare. Each agent must be strong enough to take down their partner if something happens. It’s the main reason why Ancaer doesn't want you working with Nick. If something happened and he went out of control people may die before other agents can arrive to... solve the problem.” 

We sat listening to the rain. In our last case, Nick changed for a few minutes. He displayed a power no one knew about. One that he shouldn’t have. He could have killed me, or worse. I wanted to believe I snapped him out of it, but he might have just run out of energy before he reached me.  

“Should I... not be working with him?” I asked after a while. 

“What?! No! Keep working with him! I mean. Have you seen him lately? I would rather risk this world burning so Nick gets to spend time with someone who actually cares about him.” 

Aberash’s sudden outburst startled me. After I recovered, I smiled at her. She was telling me I could be as selfish as I wanted. Risking the world to spend time with a friend might make me a bad person but I really didn’t care. I started to work with Nick because I needed money. Now, I just wanted to make sure he was alright. We pulled up in front of my apartment building. I left one bag of quiche with Aberash because I didn’t have the space for them. She had a big family so the food would get eaten rather than saying inside my freezer. 

She gave me a warm goodbye. The trip back to my apartment felt like a journey. The moment I got inside I tossed off my ruined clothing and had a shower. Gregory didn’t leave much of a wound when she stung my stomach. The pain in my shoulder became manageable and the cut on my forehead stopped bleeding so I didn’t need stitches. All in all, it wasn’t as bad as I expected. 

After drying off and putting on clean clothing, I spotted an enemy in my apartment. A spider hanging out in my kitchen, behind the tap. I felt so tempted to kill it on sight. Gregory’s big eyes came to mind. Instead, I spent the next ten minutes getting it inside a cup and releasing it outside.  

I haven’t fully conquered my fear of spiders, but at least this was a start.

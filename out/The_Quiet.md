“-reports of Marines placed within quarantined zones of several small towns in the countryside. Reports have stated that the government is urging people to turn on any loud objects they have in their household, such as radios, blenders, silverware, or if that is unavailable, singing. Social media has been nothing but posts about what is apparently happening. One source claims to be a survivor of the Ohio disappearance, urging people to stay quiet. According to this user, the violent images circling online were from several neighbors that blasted loud music, in protest against the noise-reducing laws. Many users have believed this, starting the hashtag #StayQuiet, however many of these tweets do get deleted soon afterward.”

“-fuck, fuck, FUCK. They had their slaves infiltrate New York, and the fucking military. Had themselves disguise as authorities, just to try to destabilize us. Hand-crank radios, silverware, stolen or hidden, I don’t know why, I don’t know HOW, and they cut the power. THEY CUT THE FUCKING POWER. People are singing, trying to keep whatever the fuck those monsters are away, but they need sleep. They won’t survive for long, not even while keeping watch while others sleep. Eventually, voices fade, sound won’t come out, and all it takes it one second. ONE. I’m trying to keep this bunker safe, talking constantly, but god I’m so tired. I’m so very tired. I’m so tired. So tired. So tired. So tired.”

"I can hear them. Scratching at the door. I would fight, but God...I want to rest. I'll record what's happened so far. Maybe leave it on the news, till the battery dies. Maybe humanity can be saved. Maybe they'll want to know what happens. I don't know if they'll be any more of us, though."
".... I'm going to go take a nap now. Goodnight and farewell."

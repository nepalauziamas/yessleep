*My school was the start of an zombie apocalypse, sounds dumb too most people, sounds fake too others. But after you read my story, you too will know that Milliards High School was the start of a zombie apocalypse.*

&#x200B;

 I live in a small town thats pretty isolated from the rest of the world. Since were such a small town we have limited rescourses meaning if a pandemic happend nobody would be able to help us and we wouldn't be able to help ourselves. But enough of that, let me tell you how the zombie Apocalypse happend. 

&#x200B;

*It all started on a Monday morning of me getting bullied by the infamous Trevor and Derk twins. These guys were jerks who bullied almost everybody unless they were 5,8 or above but even still some tall people had a chance of getting bullied by these guys. I was on my way to 3rd period when i saw them approach me. Most times I run but I knew if they caught me I would get punished for it.*

&#x200B;

*I had to hurry and make a decision of just staying or running. I only had 3-4 mins before the bell would ring and I would be marked tardy so I decided to just book it and run as fast as I could downstairs to my next class. As i ran I heard big footsteps behind me indicating that they were close to catching me.*

&#x200B;

*Of course running in the halls is not permitted so the bullies and I excuse was we were about to be marked tardy or absent. 1 min remaining before I would be marked tardy I got up the final stairs and ran towards my class which was right in front of me.* 

&#x200B;

*As i approached the class I was grabbed from behind and yanked backwards, I looked up to see the Trevor and Derk twins hovering over me like a couple of wild tigers looking over the prey that they caught.*

&#x200B;

*As I tried to wrestle myself free of Trevor's grip Derk punched me square in my face knocking my glasses off in the process. When my glasses fell Derk laffed and mimicked a kind of famous video and said, ‘’nice shot’’. As both Trevor and Derk laffed the bell finally ringed and they ran to whatever class they had.*

&#x200B;

*Mad at myself for letting them catch me I walked to my class to only turn around and go back for my glasses. As I turned around I thought I saw this figure dart but since I wasn't wearing my glasses It was kinda blurry so I really couldn't tell. After I picked up my glasses and put them on I heard a loud thump coming from the stairs just a couple of feet away.*

&#x200B;

*When I looked I heard another loud thump, I didn't want to go look because if it ended up being nothing then I would waste even more time and be marked absent. I decided to just risk it and go look at the stairs to see what was making such a loud noise. As I approached the first set of stairs I looked down towards the second set of stairs and saw a student I didn't recognize standing next to a wall.*

&#x200B;

*As I was about to say what are you doing this strange student banged his literal head on the wall. I swear, when his head made contact with the wall I heard something snap/crack. I screamed when this happened and he all of a sudden snapped his head towards me. This strange student started to run like he was on fire straight at me, in the process skipping 2 stairs at a time.*

&#x200B;

*With just a mere second left before being squashed by this strange student I quickly moved to the side allowing the student to smash his face into the wall. Without looking back to see what happened to this student I booked it up the next flight of stairs and straight to my class.*

&#x200B;

*As I rapidly knocked on the door I turned around and saw that same student who just not a couple of seconds ago just smashed his entire face into the wall standing in the entryway to the stairs. My literal jaw dropped leaving my face in a ‘’O’’ expression. As I stood there trying to think of how this strange student got up so fast a voice interrupted my thoughts.*

&#x200B;

*Hey! Hey! Get into class young man your 12 minutes late! Oh sorry sir I was just looking a-, why is he running towards us? I don't know.. Get into class I will deal with this student, about time I'm done with him he will be begging me not to suspend him! Whatever you say, as I walked into class hundreds of eyes came on me as I walked to my seat in the back of the class.*

&#x200B;

*As I sat down I heard a scream that sounded like the teacher. Instantly everyone got out of their seats to go see what was happening. Some started yelling and screaming while others were staring with a terrified look on their face. Caleb, a nerd just like me, ran to me and explained that there was a student nobody recognized eating the teacher.*

&#x200B;

*I almost threw up in my mouth when I heard chewing coming from the other side of the door. People started to scream zombie and barricade the door before he eats us all to. While everyone else was panicking and running around trying to find things to barricade the door, me and Caleb started to look around for an exit out of the school.*

&#x200B;

*Caleb thought of the windows but it was was locked and needed a key, and the windows were also strong in case of a school shooter so it would take forever to try to smash it open. I then realized that there was no escape other than the door and a few people would be sacrificed to get past the zombie.*

&#x200B;

*As Caleb and I started to realize what would have to be done to escape, we started to back up in the back with some other students. All of a sudden, after about 30-45 secs of people crying and shaking a big football broke the silence by saying did anyone have a signal? Confused, people started to frantically check their phones for signals but found none.*

&#x200B;

*Another kid named Kevin spoke up and said as soon as this happened he dialed 911 but the operator said she couldn't help him because this was happening all around the world. 2-5 more kids started to say ‘’yeah me too’’ or ‘’same’’. We started to discuss among ourselves what to do about this zombie when a classmate mentioned where the zombie was.*

&#x200B;

*We all turned towards the door realizing that it was dead silent. One brave kid got up and walked to the door to see what had happened. As the kid got closer and closer to the door, everyone's breathing seemed muffled or gone, all attention was on this kid. When he finally got to the door he peaked out the narrow glass and a shocked/surprised look came on his face.*

&#x200B;

*Just as he said the body was gone a bloody hand crashed through the glass, grabbed his neck, and crushed his entire neck until the point where his head fell off his shoulders. Half the class screamed while the other half were paralyzed in fear.*

&#x200B;

*That same bloody hand then started to reach for the handle of the door. We watched in horror as it finally grabbed the handle and opened the door to reveal the strange student and zombified teacher. They instantly started to run, jumping on shocked kids and tearing into their flesh.*

&#x200B;

*Me, Caleb, Darnell, Kate, and Fred, took off for the door looking back just once and seeing half the class dead with others trying to get the zombie of a person just to be killed too. The last person out of the classroom, Fred, shut the door behind us just in case they decided to chase us down.*

&#x200B;

*We looked around and saw classrooms open and screaming from everywhere. We decided to try to run for the fire exit which was down 3 flights of stairs. As we ran down the stairs we saw people running out the door and zombies on top of people ripping into their flesh and pulling back chunks of meat.*

&#x200B;

*As we got near the fire exit one of the zombies who was chewing on a student's flesh suddenly looked up and saw us. We all froze as the zombie slowly got up and stared at us. We all slowly walked to the exit trying to put distance between us and the zombie.*

&#x200B;

*Fred, the big football player, reached and got a piece of cardboard and got in front of the group. As we slowly backed up the zombie started to advance slowly. We got closer and closer to the exit to the point where Caleb was touching the door with his back. That's when the zombie started to run full speed at us.*

I sleep a lot, more than the average person for sure. I’m pretty sure you’re wondering if it’s a medical condition. Trust me I’ve been tested for it all. I’m not a narcoleptic, nor am I a hypersomniac.

it never really hurt anyone, although it affected my grades throughout the school year because I would constantly fall asleep in class. It didn’t matter how much I slept the night before I was ALWAYS tired. there wasn’t a time or place where I was incapable of sleeping. 

It felt like my life was passing without me living it.

Recently my family has been acting strange around me. I mean they could’ve always been this way, I never really payed much attention. But recently the energy has been different. Tense, awkward, and just overall off. 

I noticed the morning of my older sisters’ birthday (they’re twins). When I came down the stairs I caught a glimpse of my family. They seemed to be having a conversation but it wasn’t a normal family convo. No happy faces. No birthday wishes. Just tense whispers and solemn expressions. 

after petting our dog Daisy, who greeted me at the end of the stairs every morning, I entered the kitchen where they were all seated, they had nothing but smiles on their faces. I was weirded out. I swore I had just seen them having a serious discussion. I brushed it off thinking I was just putting ideas in my head, seeing as I had just woken up and was pretty groggy. 

a few days after that weird encounter with my family, I began to notice things missing. At first it was only minor objects, my hair brush and my sisters bracelet. But soon the items missing started becoming more and more strange. 

I have pills to help keep me awake, seeing as I have no diagnosis it was the most my doctor could do for me. One morning, technically afternoon seeing as I woke up at 3 pm, I gave Daisy some pets and went into the kitchen where my pills were located, I reached towards the space where the bottle normally is, only to feel an empty space.

I immediately panicked and frantically looked in each and every crevice and corner of the kitchen to no avail. 

The next time I woke up it was after sleeping 23 hours. There was something seriously wrong. I walked down the stairs preparing to cuddle with Daisy to relieve some stress but she was no where to be found. I was so confused. That’s when something hit me in the back of the head and then it all went black.  

I woke up in my bed, the back of my head was throbbing and I was having trouble fully opening my eyes. 

It took me a couple seconds but I realized that I was CHAINED to my bed. I looked up and basically had my soul jump out of my body.

Standing around me were my twin sisters. They had the most emotionless expressions on their faces that I had ever seen on anyone. 

“Alissa? Avery? What the hell guys? If this is one of your stupid pranks it’s not funny, you’re freaking me out.” 

They said nothing, they just stared blankly. 

The silence was unsettling, especially because Alissa and Avery never shut up, they were by far the loudest people I knew.

“Seriously guys it’s not fu-“

I went quiet the second I saw my parents enter the room, wearing the same exact emotionless expressions as my sisters.

“guys what is this why are you doing this? Mom? dad?”

“Quiet now Lea. This is for your own good…” my mother said in a monotone voice. 

“We weren’t sure it was you at first, but we have all the evidence we need now.” My dad said in that same unsettling tone.

“I don’t- I don’t understand” I said with tears welling in my eyes. 

“Shhh, it’ll all be over soon.” Avery spoke. 

That’s when I passed out. When I awoke again I was free and then I noticed the scene around me. It looked like something out of a horrific nightmare.

Blood spatters painted the ceiling and walls crimson, the bodies of my family lay around me, mutilated, in ways too gruesome to even try to describe. That’s when I saw the blood on my hands, on my clothes, coating almost every inch of me. Yet, I was unharmed? Then it dawned on me. I think I know what happened to Daisy. 

You know what, I think I’m gonna take a nap, I’m so tired.

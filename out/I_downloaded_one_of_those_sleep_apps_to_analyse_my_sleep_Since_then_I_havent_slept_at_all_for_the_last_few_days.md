I wouldn't say that I sleep good or bad, probably the same as your average person but recently I'd say over the past couple of weeks my sleep has slowly begun to worsen. The first week started off with waking up an hour or two earlier (than my alarm) and not being able to get back to sleep. I didn't think much of it to be honest, maybe I'd drunken some caffeine too late or there was some stress at work that lingered with me.

"Oh well" I said; I shrugged it off and just continued on with the days.

Fast forward to the second week and things got a bit more intense, for the first half of the week I started waking up at exactly 3:30am everyday. The state that I woke up in wasn't anything that went remiss either, I woke up in a panicked cold sweat, It's as if my body knew what was going on whilst mentally I remained oblivious to the horror.... that was in me.

I noticed as well that I'd always wake up on my right side facing my mirror. At first I didn't think anything of it but being a little bit superstitious and watching the movie Mirrors, I turned it around just in case.

Towards the end of the week, I had the same panicked cold sweat awakening at exactly 3:30am everyday except now I've started having nosebleeds, the moment I awoke, it was like clockwork; panic, confusion, sweat and nosebleed.

After each nosebleed, I noticed I felt weaker and weaker, as if my life was being drained from me.

Naturally so, I got worried about my sleeping and the constant nosebleeds so I went to see my doctor. I appreciate they tried but I felt as if I got brushed off, y'know the same old:

"Drink less caffeine" "Are you stressed?" "Try not to look at any screens an hour before you sleep" "Do you nap during the day?"

After around 15 minutes of answering these questions they prescribed me Restoril (Tamazepam) and some Sertraline to help me sleep and help with my "mood" changes and then sent me on my way.

I've taken SSRI's before so I knew they wouldn't take affect that quickly, at least not for another 4 weeks but I was hoping the Restoril would help me stay asleep and not wake up in the middle of the night. My hopes went unanswered and at 3:30am like clockwork; panic, confusion, sweat and nosebleed.

The lack of sleep really got to me, I couldn't function as a human and I was a shell of my former self. My work declined, my social life declined; I even snapped at my friend group who was trying to help me.

Earlier in the week we were reviewing each others projects at work, just as a regular team gathering  to provide feedback on areas we did well in and areas to improve. The projects we reviewed were anonymous so there was no direct way of knowing who's it was but I noticed one of them was mine. Not wanting to give it away, I just continued and provided feedback on it like anyone else.

After around 5 minutes I noticed one of my colleagues sitting across from me make a joking remark that the work was done by someone's who been on a bender the whole week.

Normally, I wouldn't care, I'd laugh along like anyone else but right there and then I sat silent, looking directly at him. I was plotting his death in my mind. I wanted to hurt him, I wanted to rip every single muscle fiber out his body and leave him there to suffer.

"Sam?" "Sam...?" "Sam! Are you okay?" Were the next words I heard. I snapped out of it, it was almost as if I was in a trance. The look on my face would not have passed for anything less than a death stare; "it was almost demonic" my manager pointed out. They pulled me aside to ask if everything was okay.

"Sorry about that, I'm fine, I just haven't been sleeping too well recently".

The meeting ended with me apologising to the colleague and we all went back to our desks.

As I was walking back, I realised how out of character that was and how unnatural my thinking was - "Kill him?" "Hurt him?" "Wtf was I thinking?". Even if I had been sleeping terribly and wasn't myself, where did that come from? Little did I realise, I was changing and oblivious to me, other people had began to notice it as well, especially the doctor when he spoke about my "mood".

I had enough.

If the doctor wasn't going to help then I'd take treatment into my own hands. I think the first sensible thing to do was to try figure out what the hell was going on. This leads to me a few days ago, I thought let's try and figure out what is actually happening in my sleep and so I downloaded one of those sleep apps that record your sleep and the things you do e.g. snoring and talking.

Determined to figure out and cure myself; I took my meds, I turned the recording on and when midnight hit, I was out like a light (as you can imagine this cycle of terrible sleep, I was exhausted).

What I discovered, well let's just say writing this today, I haven't slept in the last few days. I am so tired but I can't sleep anymore. I'd rather die than fall asleep again.

The first 2 hours were fine, nothing significant to report; occasional sleep talk and the occasional snoring but nothing out of the ordinary. Once it hit 3am however, that's where it all began, that's when I realised what was happening.

The app detailed it as "talking" but honestly what I heard was unlike anything before.

The voice sounded deep, gritty almost and borderline demonic:

*"I know you can hear me, Sam. Finally, you get to figure out what's going on and maybe you can "try and cure yourself".*  I think it started laughing but what came out was a continuous wheeze.

"*I should probably stop giving you false hope, after a few more sleeps and you'll be mine."*

I tried to pinpoint where the sound was coming from, after a few moments that was when I froze. The sound was coming from inside me. But it wasn't my voice.... It was unlike anything I'd heard before.

*"All those memories you have, all your thoughts, all the locations of where people are, I can see all of them. I can see exactly where every single one of your family and friends are."*

*"You remember that urge to hurt and rip your colleague to shreds? That was me, Sam. Actually, that's you becoming me"* It laughed again.

I sat there in fear, my mind was racing - "What is this? What's going on with me?!".

The recording continued.

"*If you ever tell anyone about this, about me; your family are first. We will hunt them down and you will have no control over it. I will make sure they are unrecognisable when I'm done with them. Their eyes will be torn from their sockets, skin ripped off their bones and their bodies mutilated."*

The next words that it spoke sent chills down my spine...

*"If only you could see them when we're done with them. The same way I watched you, Sam. It's been a while actually. I wish you'd put back the mirror, I miss watching you."*

It continued to wheeze until I heard:

*"Only a few more sleeps and you'll be mine"* It repeated again and again and again...

It turned 3:30am and just like clockwork; panic, confusion, sweat and nosebleed.

Now the nosebleeds make sense. This thing, whatever it was, was possessing me. With each sleep I was losing myself and slowly becoming less me. The aggression, the thoughts and the slow descent into madness.

Now I'm here writing this to you, as a last ditch attempt to tell the world what was happening to me before I'm no longer me. I haven't slept at all for the last few days afraid that when I fall asleep the possession will continue and whatever this was would succeed in taking me. I haven't made any contact with anyone, no work, no friends and unanswered messages and calls from family.

That's probably the worst thing to be honest. Not being able to say goodbye, not being able to let them know that the next time they see me it won't be me, honestly I don't want to imagine what would happen next but there will be no warning, no foresight... nothing.

Someone help me please... I'm so tired, I'm so scared... I-

And just like clockwork, panic, confusion, sweat and nosebleed.

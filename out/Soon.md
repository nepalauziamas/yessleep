I'm writing this in a hurry because I'm afraid. I can feel her getting closer to me and I don't know what to do. I've always been a fan of horror and paranormal stories. I was the type of person to stay up until 3AM watching paranormal story times and ghost hunts. I had this ego - it won't happen to me, I'm not the type of person to be 'haunted'. Well, let me tell you this, if you're like me and you tell yourself that it couldn't happen to you or you believe in the paranormal but still remain slightly sceptical... I beg you to rethink. It could happen to anyone.

My name is Elena Berkley and I am 22 years old. I'm giving you this information in case something happens to me... I just graduated from college - I majored in political science. I love going out on a weekend when I'm not working, I'm a waitress right now while I look for a career path so weekends off are few and far between. I have a dog, he's a cocker spaniel and his name is Barney - he's adorable and he has so much love to give. So, now that you have some information about me, I'll begin.

I met a girl online - her name was Summer and she seemed really nice. She lived not far from me so we decided to meet at a coffee shop that was in the middle of our two towns. Things were going great, we got along great and we became really fast friends. We both shared a liking for the paranormal and she shared some of her own experiences with me. I found it fascinating - I had never had any kind of experience before. After we had met a couple of times and had been getting to know each other over text messages and facetime calls, she invited me to stay at her house for the weekend. We were going to have an old school slumber party - watch corny rom-coms, eat cookie dough, apply facemasks and tell spooky stories - except this time we'd be doing it with a bottle of wine. I was excited, I had never had a friend like this before. But things would get dark very quickly. We were a bottle of wine in by this point, and I had noticed that Summer's house was a litle different to what I would have expected. It was very dark themed, very spiritual. I'm not a very receptive person when it comes to energy, but I could definitely feel something off about this place. But like one does, I ignored it, I liked Summer's vibe and I trusted her. That is until she pulled out her Ouija board and asked me to help her play. At first, I was freaked out and said no, I'd watched too many 'gone wrong' videos for that. But she was persistent and I finally agreed. We set up and began.

At first we asked basic questions, 'is anyone there?', 'what's your name?', 'do you want to talk to us?'. We received no response and Summer decided to prompt the board, 'if someone is there, can you give us a sign?', 'make a noise, touch something, touch me.'. Immediately I felt uncomfortable, you should never ask a spirit to touch you or mess with things in your home. It could mess with the portal or barrier. and invite it in by accident. I nudged Summer and asked her not to say those things because of how uneasy it made me feel but she ignored me and carried on. When we had no further response she began to mock the board 'if you don't want to talk, I guess that means you're not real.', 'if you're real, why don't you prove it.'. She waited a moment and I felt like I couldn't breathe. 'Why don't you possess my friend..' she smirked at me. I immediately stood up, I was so confused. Why would she say that? I was pretty upset with her and made her say goodbye ready to close up the board. She was upset with me for making her end the session, she said it clearly wasn't picking anything up and she was just playing around. Eventually she apologised for her irresponsible behaviour and I said we should just move on. By this point I was extremely tired and just wanted to sleep, so we went up to Summer's room and got comfortable. She turned the TV on and put the volume on low so I could just go straight to sleep. And that's exactly what I did.

I woke to a tapping sound at around 4AM, it was disturbing and I rose quickly. It was dark and Summer was sleeping next to me. The door had been cracked open and there was a light on downstairs. I didn't think of anything paranormal, it was the last thing on my mind, I just assumed we'd left a light on. So being thirsty anyway, I got up and went to turn it out and grab some water. The light was coming from the living room where we had hosted the Ouija board. I turned it out and went to leave, but stopped in my tracks when I heard a light breathing sound coming from behind me. I spun around quickly. Nothing. I squinted my eyes in the darkness but I couldn't see anything. I shook my head and went to turn around again, but before I could something began to manifest in the darkness. A shadowy figure at first, and then it had bright white eyes, staring through me. I couldn't move. All I could do was stand, mouth open and terrified. It began to gain features, long wiry hair and pointy fingers. It began to walk towards me, slowly and painfully and when it's face was inches away from my own it whispered, 'Soon.' and faded away.

I suddenly felt a wave of relief as it disappeared, but a dreaded feeling overwhelmed me. I ran back to the bedroom, to afraid to get my water. I didn't tell Summer, I didn't want to scare her or have her think I was crazy. Instead I made up a random excuse and left early in the morning. As I was driving home, I ended up taking a wrong turn and found myself on a road that I didn't recognise. I took out Google Maps and tried to figure out my location. I wasn't far from the main road and I felt at ease knowing I could find my way back. Until it appeared again, this time in bold daylight and it began to manifest clearer. It was taller and slimmer, it's facial features clearer and stronger. By this point I could tell it was some form of woman. I was frozen again, unable to move and forced to stare at her as she pointed her bony finger at me. My windscreen got fogged up and I could no longer see outside, this was a new level of fear. I waited, motionless, for something to happen. I just wanted something quick and almost like a horror film jump scare to happen so I could move again and get out of there. As I wished for this, I heard the familiar sound of something writing on my windscreen. It was slow and disturbing as it wrote 'SOON' in wavy letters. I felt a tear roll down my cheek and I was able to move again. I stepped on the gas and drove as quickly as I could back to the main highway. By the time I got home I was sobbing, my breathing was getting bad and I couldn't stop the tears. I've never felt more afraid.

This happened 2 days ago, I keep hearing footsteps and knocking. I haven't seen her since but I have a dark feeling inside. I know that 'Soon' means something. Is it because my friend offered me as a possession? Or is it a coincidence? I'm so afraid and I have no idea what to do. I'm writing this quickly as I need help, I can't eat or sleep and my once loving dog won't even come near me anymore. Am I in danger? I'm not a writer so I apologise if I'm rambling or this is badly structured, I just needed to share this, get it off my chest in a way. Please, if you know anything about this stuff help me.

I'll update this if anything else happens, or maybe I'm too late and I won't be here to do that. I don't know right now.

Edit: I don't know if this even meets the rules, I made this in such a hurry and I have no idea what I'm doing, please advise me if I've done this wrong.

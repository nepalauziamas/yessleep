Hey, I’m a former police officer. I worked for the MSP back in about 2006. I want to get an incident off my chest. Nobody believes me although I have PTSD from it.

I pulled a man over one night while I was working over in Flint. He was speeding and I just wrote him up a ticket but he suddenly shouted something I didn’t understand for a second. Took me a moment to realize he said: “BEHIND YOU!”

I turn around and look behind me. Standing there is a man with a gun. He’s standing in a ski mask and I quickly reach for my tazer. By the time I get to pull it out he’s already shot me in the leg. I don’t yet realize it, and I’m glad I didn’t. If I did, my adrenaline would’ve flowed and pumped blood out the wound and I would’ve bled to death. 

It was a busy time during the night, so when I chased after him, it was hard to get around the crowd of people. I backed him into an alleyway and fired 3 prongs at him. He fell to the ground and jittered. I rushed over, put my body weight on his back, and put the cuffs on him. I pushed him back into my truck, not yet aware that I had a wound. I put him in my Squad Car and I started driving to the county detention center. 

There was another speeding vehicle, but behind me. It followed me. I eventually took 4 right turns and they were still following me. I hit the gas afraid of what could happen next. A man peeked his head out the window, and pulled out what I thought to be a Tec9. He shot twice at me, missing. I drove into a lake while I was panicking, noticing my gun wound. I don’t know why that made such a difference, but it did. 

The lake waters were shallow, so I could drive through it. I was frightened I have a wife and kids, a mother I need to take care of. My life was flashing before my eyes, and when I say that, I’m not exaggerating. They chased after me shouting stuff about me arresting their friend, who I assume was the man I had tazed and put in the car. I drove more into the water that we eventually ended up in a deeper area. About waist deep. They got out the car and held their guns at my head. 

I was fucking terrified. I must’ve lost my gun in the water because I reached for my holster, and my Glock wasn’t there. Neither was my stun gun. I froze up and took out my night stick from my belt. I used that to defend myself. I told them to back off and that they didn’t need to do this, but instead of killing me right there, they wanted me to suffer. They yanked my night stick from my hands and beat me with anything they had aswell as my night stick. I was bleeding all over. 

I felt something big brush against my leg. Something meaty and bony. The water was full of blood from  my beating, but there was a trail. 

I saw a sharp bone poke out from the water. Something that looked like human flesh surfaced aswell. It pulled one of the gangsters in. Then another. One scrambled away and got tackled by these meaty eel creature. The other brought his gun to his head, let out a sobering noise, then shot himself. 

I was the only one left. The eel creature tackled me. I felt bony teeth biting at my bullet wound. I was thrown underwater, over and over again. I could barely breath. But I found my way towards the squad car somehow. I grabbed some sort of handle on the car and pulled myself up. I opened the trunk and grabbed another night stick. I clubbed it’s head. Nothing happened. I stuck my night stick into his mouth and crawled into the trunk. I got into the front seat and drove off.

I don’t remember much more about that night. All I know is I got to a hospital. They couldn’t tell that I had been bit, but found the bullet. They said I must’ve panicked when I got shot, and went crazy. They patched me up. I got home later and decided I wanted to tell people. When I tried to speak to the press about it, they said I was lying. 

Nobody believed me. I got so upset about that, I attacked a politician when I told him the story. They then sent me to a mental hospital. I finally got out. But I know what I saw was real. I can keep telling myself that, and I know it’s fact, because I found a tooth dug in my back. It’s still there. 

Nobody looked at it. Nobody thought it was real. Everyone says it a birth mark. I know it’s not. How could that be a birth mark? I know what I’ve seen is true. 

I don’t know if I can take it anymore. I’m going to go find that thing. And I will get revenge.

On the last case I got a pretty bad bug and was bedridden for a few days. Nick checked in on me twice to ensure I was actually resting. When he was busy with other jobs and was unable to come in person, he recruited Jimmy to drop by and she caught me out of bed trying to make myself some soup. Having your employee over at your house and making you dinner has to be be crossing some sort of line. I should remember to pay her for the time she spent over helping out. A few days later I finally recovered and was ready to check in on my office, only to have Nick come by with a case folder in hand.  

 We spotted each other outside my apartment and I gave him a wave and walked over.  

“Hey Snickaty, what’s going on?” I said. I was running really low on new nicknames for him.  

 “I believe you’re just making up words now.” He replied, without a hint of humor.  

 I’ll admit, that one wasn’t my best. I should just stick with Snickerdoodle. I made the mistake of using the best one first. He didn’t dwell on it and handed me the folder to look at as we walked and he spoke.  

 “This case may be dealing with certain creatures that humans find troublesome and uncomfortable to discuss. You do not need to accept this job, and you may step out at any point.”   

 It was the first time I’ve ever heard something like this. Whatever we were up against must be a very big deal for Nickie to warn me ahead of time. He didn’t even bother warning me about how gruesome a Nest could be. If I had managed to get through insects making a human their hive, then I would probably be fine with whatever else gets thrown my way.  

 “Don’t worry about Nick. I think I can handle it.”   

 He paused, debating on whether he really wanted to take me along. So far, the case folder only held photos and names of people who were found drained of energy and sent to the hospital. No injuries, or anyone torn apart. It all appeared pretty mild. He remained silent and then stopped walking, causing me to almost knock him over by running into his back.   

“The Corporation believes there is a Succubus on the loose.” He finally said.  

That was it? Looking up at my partner, his face didn't look flustered or really affected by the topic. I didn’t understand why he was making such a big deal out of it. Unless there was something about succubi I didn’t know. As far as I was aware, they just seduced men, right?   

“I really don’t mind talking about a sexy demon girl, Nickie.” I said, still not understanding the issue.  

 “I suppose it’s the nature of the creature most are reluctant to talk about, let alone deal with. This case was offered to a few teams but all passed on it fearing they would not be able to handle being around such a creature without incident.” He explained.  

 “How many sets of partners passed on it before you got a hold of this?” I asked.  

 Nick held up both open hands wide and flashed his fingers twice. Twenty sets of partners refused this case? I took a second to think about it. I didn’t know that I could control myself around something like that. Would I end up doing something really embarrassing? I would hate it if we were trying to get a creature under control and from harming others and I wasn’t focused on the task, but instead drooling over an attractive girl. Thinking back to all the cute girl’s I've come across, I hated myself a little over the fact that it might be a real possibility. I barely could focus when Feena came into my office wearing a very small piece of cloth and nothing else. Not because I was ready to jump her, but because I didn’t know where to look. Honestly, I got embarrassed easily by girls, but never outright turned on to the point my brain stopped working.  

 Nick was really the best person for a job like this. He never looked at a girl in that way. No blushing, no stumbling over his words. He'd never even looked at a guy like that either. Come to think about it, did Nick look at anyone with a romantic interest ever?   

 “If we run into a Succubus and I’m having... issues then you can slap me across the face until I smarten up. I’m guessing if we don’t deal with this soon, people are going to keep getting hurt. She might not stop at only weakening her victims for much longer. And God only knows when she’ll come across someone with a bad heart.”  

This needed to be dealt with, right now. One of us would keep a clear head no matter what. Who knew how long we had before things took a turn for the worst. It was a good thing Nick found this case for us to take care of before it kept getting passed around. Rogue Succubi must not be an ongoing problem for there not to already have a special agent assigned to such cases.  

 “We’ll first go by an Incubus's place to ask questions. They are gender fluid creatures from what I’ve heard. He tends to stay in a male body and prefers male pronouns. Succubus and Incubus are the same creatures. They just switch depending on their partner. His whereabouts have been confirmed so it is unlikely he’s behind any of this. However, he may know of others in the area.” Nick explained a little more as he guided us to my apartment again.   

 Now I would have never expected that information. It made sense. If they gain energy from sleeping around, changing their bodies to suit any kind of preference would ensure they always got what they needed. Even after everything I had already gone through, I learned something new about the supernatural every other day. I could be doing this job for a hundred years and still be learning something new.  

 Nick didn’t have enough energy for a transportation spell, but he did have the right key for the connecting doors spell. My apartment door was the only one he already had permission to use. He could use any door, but that cost more magic when you didn’t have permission. So much more it wasn’t worth barging into someone's place. He took a key from his pocket and placed it into the lock. It was a long iron skeleton key that shouldn’t have fit. He turned it once and opened the door. Inside was not my place, but something resembling a fortune teller’s tent. The air smelled so heavily of perfume my eyes watered without even walking inside. I literally needed to suck it up and follow behind my partner.  

 The room was dimly lit with purple light. The air was warm and heavy making my head swim. Each surface was soft and plush. A person sitting at a table near the far side of the room stood up to greet us. His arms were outstretched and he had a perfect smile on his face. He looked totally human aside from how handsome he was. Everything from his flowing pale hair to his tanned skin not exactly hidden under transparent silks.   

“Oh my goodness, Agents! I haven’t had any drop by in such a long time! Come along, tell me what you like. I do discounts for ones from your lovely company.” The man exclaimed in a soft wispy voice.   

I was unable to reply trying to get over the heavy air. Nick’s face was as stiff as ever. He didn’t respond in the slightest to the man’s appearance, or the strange air. He remained completely stone-faced as the man scooped his hands into his own.  

“We are on a case-”  

What happened made me snap out of my dizzy state and let out a shocked squeak. The man leaned down and kissed Nick before my partner could stop him. I fretted, worried about what would happen to him. After all, being touched let alone kissed by an Incubus was a bad thing, right? After the worry came a wave of anger over just how rude it was to do something like that without any kind of permission. The creature pulled away, expecting some sort of reaction only to receive nothing. 

“As I was saying, we are on a case and would like to speak with you if possible.” Nick said without his tone of voice changing in the slightest.   

At least my partner was fine and had no issue with the kind of creature we were dealing with. The Incubus just stood there, mouth open in complete shock. He simply didn’t understand how Nick had just brushed him off. He’d never gotten a reaction like that before, and I could see his world starting to internally crumble around him.  

“You just... Nothing? There was no way that was nothing! What spell are you using?” Circling Nick, he started to look to see if he could sense some sort of magic. When he spotted me, he jumped back as if I smacked him. “And you! Your eyes should be all glazed over just being here! Don’t I do anything for you?”  

“No, I prefer girls. About this case-”  

That was the wrong thing to say. As if I just told him an answer to a difficult question, his perfect face lit up. Before our eyes, his body changed to a very beautiful women, the clothing not leaving much to the imagination. I expected myself to be more flustered. To the point where I needed to leave. I found if I just stared at the face, I would be fine.   

“This should be more like it! Now, let’s-”  

“Talk about the case.” Nick interrupted.  

With a scream of frustration. He shifted back to the male form, distraught over who just walked into his place. I almost felt bad for the guy. Glancing over I could tell Nickie was getting slightly agitated and that wasn’t like him at all. He was normally so calm about everything.   

“I felt something from the little one! Why weren't you trying to jump me as a girl? I don’t understand either of you! My air should be doing something!”  

With a long sigh I figured if we didn’t address this first, we would get nowhere.   

“I don’t get worked up over girls I don’t care about. I might get a little flustered over someone cute, but I’m a three-date kind of guy before anything happens. I just assume it’s normal not to want to sleep with someone unless you're into them that much.” I said with a shrug.  

“Uh, dude. People don’t need to like each other to get hot and heavy. Sometimes they don’t even need to know each other. You two aren’t really normal...”  

Wait... Was that right? It was a fact I knew, but never thought about it until it was shoved in my face. How did I never notice that about myself? That I could never get worked up over a stranger? I shook my head not wanting to get into such personal details with someone who didn’t respect either of us.  

“Either way, it doesn’t matter. We came for a case not for your services. And don’t go saying we’re not normal because you've never come across something like this before. It's rude.”  

I was very close at walking out the door to try and find a different source for this case. I could take someone insulting me to my face, but no one was mean to my partner. Nick was silent, letting me take over the conversation. He was either hoping I knew how to bring it around to what we needed to know, or at a loss for words himself.  

“I Just... it's weird. At least you like something but your partner really isn’t into anything? Nothing at all? Does he know for sure, has he ever even just tried it to see? Without trying it, how do you really know?” 

My face flushed in rage and my arm shot out with a quick punch to the Incubus's shoulder. To my shock, Nick and I had the same idea as his hand flew out at the same time. I almost felt bad for lashing out like that. But then again, that comment was so offensive he deserved it. I just never saw Nick get upset over something someone said about him, only to defend others. I wondered if I was having a bad influence on my partner, or if Nick standing up for himself was a good thing. That double punch hit some sense into the Incubus. Rubbing his arms, he nodded realizing his mistake.  

“Sorry, I just... That was pretty rude. I’ve never come across someone like you two and didn’t think it was possible.” The Incubus apologized.  

“I understand but I am not apologizing.”  

That was another statement that shocked me. Nick said sorry for everything. You didn’t really need to do much to get one out of him. He was ready to drop the whole thing to get back to the case but refused to apologize for landing a punch.   

We finally could get to the reason of why we had come. The Incubus changed into some clothing that covered him a bit more and directed Nick and I to sit at a table so we could talk. He introduced himself as Marumaru, and we gave him our names. From how rocky our first conversation was, we got back on track easily enough. Nick laid out the files to ask if Maru knew of any Succubus in the area that might be the cause behind the number of humans found drained of energy recently.   

“Hmm, well... I guess this is something one of our kind could do but most likely wouldn’t. We don’t overlap territory like this. With all the restrictions put into place, our interactions with humans are very closely recorded. If we don’t follow that, the punishment is way beyond anything we could gain by the extra meals. The only other Succubus that hangs around here is my sibling. She tends to stay in a female body, so I call her my sister.  We can be in the same territory because she only interacts with max five humans at a time. Like having five ongoing relationships. I, on the other hand, open shop to welcome anyone who walks in for service.”  

Nick did say he doubted Maru was behind what was going on due to his movements being so closely followed. It must be tough trying to just live while being watched for any mistakes. If a Succubus, or an Incubus was behind these events then The Corporation should be aware of it already. The only way they wouldn’t be is if it was a Succubus they had missed and wasn’t registered with them. One could give their entire species a bad name, so if Maru knew about it, he would definitely tell us. Nick pulled out a photo from the file folder and placed it in front of Maru.   

“Do you think one of your species can do something like this?” He asked.  

The photo was of a shrivelled up corpse. It made my skin crawl a little. Back when I was younger, I got really into mummies. Somehow it was easier to look at them when you knew the person died thousands of years ago instead of someone who lived fairly recently. Maru’s face paled a little and he nodded.  

“It’s extreme, but yes, we can do that. We always stop ourselves before it gets this far. After all, if a human lives for another day we can get another meal from them. It makes no sense to get one big meal if you can get several from the same source.” He said, pushing the photo back a little.  

In a way, his kind was dangerous. But overall, they preferred to work with humans instead of killing them. If there was an Incubus or a Succubus on the loose then it would be a bit of a big deal.  They could kill if they wanted and it would be difficult for any agent other than myself and Nick to deal with it. Or by others that weren’t affected by their powers. Judging from how much this case had bounced around, the people that could manage this were rare in The Corporation. I figured Ancaer was stronger than a Succubus, but would be useless against one. If the creature we were facing was more powerful than us, we may not have any backup.  

“So far this is the only death we could find. It’s only a matter of time until more happen. Are you aware of a method of drawing some of your kind to a certain spot?” Nick asked, trying to figure out a way to stop all this before someone else died.  

“Aside from having a lot of worked up people in one spot, no. We’re only attracted by that kind of energy. And we grow stronger around it so it would be best not to use that method. With how you two are, it would be almost impossible for any of my kind to be drawn to you. But if you could find the one doing this, we are pretty weak against binding spells. If we’re not under contract, there isn’t much we can do against one if one is forced on us. In fact, I got lucky about a week ago. Some human dabbling in dark magic was a jerk trying to get me over to his place and become his sex slave. Ugh, how gross.” Maru sounded equally as proud of himself for avoiding such a fate as he was disgusted over the human who attempted to bind him in such a way.  

Nick looked down at the photos on the desk. He moved one to read a date at the top of the folder, and the information they dug up about the only human found dead so far. The glance was quick and I almost missed the movement. He'd put something together I just hadn’t yet.  

“About a week ago you say?” Nick asked, giving me enough time to fit the pieces into place. Maru still hadn’t realized it.  

“Uh, yeah. I kicked him in the nuts and stormed off. I think his name was Garvis Jane.” Maru said, with his arms crossed.  

Nick lifted the photo of the mummy again silently telling us what he figured out. After a pause, Maru understood. His face flushed in rage and he stood up, furious over the dead man’s actions.   

“That bastard got to my sister!! I would kill him a second time if I could!!”   

For a moment he looked about ready to storm off to find the body and take out some of his anger on it. After Garvis failed getting Maru under his control, he turned to the sister. She was the one going rogue. If the person who contracted her was dead, then why was she still out ambushing people? Was whatever contract on her not over just because the one who made it had died? At least we now knew what was going on and could figure out a way forward. When the Incubus grew even paler from fear, I got worried. He dove at the files, reading them over trying to add up just how many humans his sister had harmed so far.  

“Maru, what’s up?” I asked, hoping we hadn’t just gained another problem.  

For a second, his face flushed from the shortened name. No one had ever called him a nickname before, even if it was just a shorter version of his own name. He quickly got over it and dropped a bomb on us that made the entire thing so much worse.  

“My sister and I... are different. We may be the only two left of what we are. We were created from a regular Succubus by a religious leader a few hundred years ago who was disgusted by sex in general. He only thought it was acceptable if it was done to create life, and not enjoyed in the slightest. We are... well... We gather energy and magic created from being with humans in that way. If we gain too much, we explode, taking the world out with us. In his eyes, if no one sinned, then the world wouldn’t be at risk.”  

Yeah, this was bad. We all got up, ready to track down his sister before it was too late. She’d already been at this for a week. There was no telling just how much more energy she needed to collect before the world was done for. And besides all that, I wanted to save her. I didn’t believe this was what she wanted. She only took on a few partners at a time. From what I could tell from the files, whatever Garvis did to her caused her to go for anyone who crossed her path. End of the world aside, this was just wrong.  

“The attacks have been clustered in this area. Do you believe there is one spot she is more likely to stay around?” Nick asked pointing to a small map he had within the files.   

Maru looked and pointed to a small spot. His face showing just how worried he was for his sister.  

“Right here. She loves this park. It’s the spot where she met most of her partners. Whatever spell she’s under might be messing with her mind, but I think her heart would direct her here.”  

Nick nodded and headed towards the door, leaving the papers behind since he no longer needed them. I followed behind wondering how we could help her. I couldn’t do any magic, let alone break a spell. And Nick wasn’t the best at magic either. Maru was behind us but then suddenly put himself between us and the door. His arms were out, trying to block us the best he could.  

“You’re both agents... I don’t want the world to end but I know your type. Killing is the easiest way to solve a problem and... If I lose Bebe then it would be as if my world was over.” His normally perfect face was flushed with tears.   

Without his powers affecting us, he couldn’t do anything. He knew that, and yet he put himself in front of people he assumed to be killers. I respected him knowing I would do the same for my sister.   

“I'm a contract worker, not an agent so I can do whatever I want. And we tend to do things the hard way.” I said with a smile I hoped would be comforting.  

He waited a few seconds, expecting what I said to be a lie. Maru finally relaxed a little when he accepted that we were willing to work together to get his sister out of this entire mess. He demanded to go with us which was easily agreed on. He was the best person to find his sister. I was glad other agents had passed on this case. I would hate to think of what would have happened to Bebe if they hadn’t.   

Maru was able to make a transportation circle to get us all to the park quickly. The sun had already set by the time we arrived, making looking for her a bit difficult. Maru directed us to the pond where he knew his sister liked to feed the ducks. I was the slowest runner, so was left behind for a few minutes until I could catch up with them. By the time I got to the pond, I missed a little of what had happened. Maru's guess was right as to where his sister may be. In front of the small pond was a girl wearing a nearly transparent white dress. In the dark she appeared almost like a beautiful ghost. Her long pale hair was nearly glowing and her eyes were unfocused. Neither of them approached her just yet. Maru wanted to either try and talk some sense into her, or wanted to see just how far gone she was. Nick placed himself in between myself and the scene despite us being a few feet from her. He wasn’t aware of her powers and honestly didn’t even want me around something so dangerous.

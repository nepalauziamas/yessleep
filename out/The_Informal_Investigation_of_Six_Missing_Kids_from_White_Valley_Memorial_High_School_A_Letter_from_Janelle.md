My name is Janelle Petersen. I am a survivor of the attack on White Valley Memorial High School. There are… There are three of us here. We are trapped inside an office building on the edge of town. Right next to the Jamba Juice. We have been here for three days. We are running low on food and water. Soon, at some point, if no one comes, we’re going to have to make a run outside. Which is why… um… Katie, do you want to talk?

“Sure.”

Speak into that part. The top part. 

“I know how to use it.”

Okay. Just… just hold that part. 

“It’s my dad’s microphone.”

I know. The static can just sometimes be annoying. You have to hold it and speak.

“My name is Katherine Smith.”

Anything else? Tell them something. Tell them about yourself. 

“I just want to go home.”

Okay. Okay. Mr. Smith?

*What?*

Do you want to say something for the recording?

*Do I have to?*

Got something better to do? 

*Fine.*

Speak clearly. 

*I… I never thought it could come to this. The school is destroyed. The town is destroyed. We have not seen another living person since the attack. But we… we hear things. At night. When they think we’re sleeping.*

What kind of things? 

*People. Out there in the rain. Milling about.*

I hear them too. 

*But they don’t sound right. Their voices don't have a normal cadence to them. You know? Like how background conversation usually is? They sound… they sound sick, or something.*

Maybe they are.

*What?*

Sick.

*Oh.*

He wouldn’t let them outside otherwise. 

*You still haven’t told us what happened to you.*

I have. 

*You said you were abducted.*

I was. 

*Who abducted you?*

You know the answer by now. Say it. 

*I really don’t.*

What the fuck are we doing here then?

 *A… a monster. A creature of some kind.*

Monster is a good word for it. 

*Alien.*

Alien is another. 

*I get the feeling they are all referring to the same thing. All of the lore. Every boogeyman since the beginning of time all referencing the same thing.*

This thing.

*The Tall Man.*

Correct.

*What is it?*

I thought we covered that topic. 

*But did you know about it? Before, I mean. Did the people here know about it?*

There’s a better question. 

*Everyone I talked to… everyone in this fucking town… they all seemed to have some inkling that whatever happened to you… whatever took you had to be something… something inhuman.*

So you want to know why some God fearing folks in hick country would be scared of the Devil? Wondering if they made a deal for some updated sidewalks and a really nice guitar that plays the blues? 

*Did they?*

I wouldn’t know. 

*But they knew about him.*

The monster?

*Yes.*

Maybe. 

*Maybe?*

Maybe. Our people have been here for a long time. Before the colonists, before the tribes, even. There are rumors that a settlement existed in the Valley even before the land bridge in Alaska. You’ll notice that our skin is darker. Our eyes are better adjusted to better take in the sun. That sort of thing takes dozens of generations to develop. And yet, here we are, adapted to live in this town. 

*I see.*

There have always been stories. You know? Sightings and the like. Ranger Rick out getting a blowjob in the sticks swears he sees a shadow in the trees. Martha’s grandmother insists on seeing a face in her window at night. But these were just rumors, urban legends that folks never really took seriously, of all the high school kids. I guess every rumor has a nugget of truth in it. 

*What happened on the night he took you?*

I don’t remember much. Better that way. I remember floating for a bit, then crashing for a bit, then hearing a baby cry… my baby. I don’t even know if it was a boy or girl.

*Did you see the others?*

Yes. All of them. Jonathan, Jeff, the rest. 

*Where did he take them?*

A tunnel beneath the school. Dug out like a rabbit. No one even noticed.

*Why did he take them?*

That's the million dollar question. I only know the answer because he told it to me. He speaks in your mind. Right when you least expect it. 

*What did he say?*

He took them for a trade. The place he comes from doesn’t want him anymore. He needs to bring back something of value. 

*People?*

Men, women, and children are the biggest one. Lots of money for kids. He’s a pirate. A people pirate. Funny phrase, ain’t it? Simple economics. Goods exchanged for freedom. Amazing how well that concept travels. 

*So, he got what he wanted. Six high school students. Wasn’t that enough? Why destroy the town?*

He needed more. Always more. Alive is better. Dead is okay too.

*And your baby?*

Fetches the highest price of them all.

*How do you know this?*

Can’t you hear it? Can’t you hear HIM? I can’t turn it off. Even now.

*What is he saying?*

He knows I escaped. He’s angry about it. Always angry. He’ll kill us for it. All of us. Lesser price for dead ones, sure, but worth the punishment…

"What is she talking about, Dad?"

*Alright. Enough. I’m sorry for asking.*

Ask me something else. Please. 

*I’ve heard it before.*

But they haven’t. 

*They? Who is they?*

They! The people listening to your recording. The ones who will get this message after we’re dead. I assume that is the point of this, right, to let people know what happened here? Before it’s too late? 

“Too late? Dad, what?*

*Janelle…*

You know what’s going to happen. 

*Stop it. Nothing is going to happen. We are safe here. We just need to wait for the government.*

You know they’re not coming. 

*Stop it. We still have daylight. We’re fine.*

“Dad, what is she talking about?”

Tell her. 

*You are scaring my daughter.*

You haven’t been honest with her. 


What he wants is us, Katie. We are the last breathing souls in this shithole town. As soon as that sun sets, we are fucked. We can’t hide forever. He’s getting closer. 

*I said stop it.*

I can feel it. I can feel Him coming. I know you can feel it too. 

“Dad, do you hear that?”

**tap, tap, TAP.**

Right on schedule.

“Oh my God.”

*Get behind the wood. Katie, Katie! Crouch down. Hand me the gun. Carefully. Carefully!*

**tap, tap, TAP**

*Janelle, get down, now!*

Why?

“I can see him.“

**tap, tap, TAP**

"We’re going to die here..."

*Nobody is going to die. Stop it. We’re going to be alright. Everything is going to be alright.*

Mr. Smith. I appreciate all that you have done for us. 

**tap, tap, TAP**

*Katie, honey, get a weapon.*

Mr. Smith. I appreciate that you tried. 

*Don’t talk that way.*

**tap, tap, TAP**

Maybe this recording will show people. Show them that we tried. I shared the link.

*Katie, sweetheart, the baseball bat.*

But for us, at least, this is the end of the line. 

**tap, tap, TAP**

*Aim high.*

Time to say goodbye. 

“I don’t understand...”

**tap, tap, TAP**

Mr. Smith. Now would be a good time to say goodbye to your daughter.

“Daddy…”

*Honey… honey, just get down… honey, I love you.*


**tap, tap, TAP**

**tap, tap, TAP**

**tap, tap, TAPRAPRAPRAPRAPRAP**

“Oh my God. Daddy!”

*Shit!*

**RAPRAPRAP**

**RAPRAPRAP**

**RAPRAPRAP**

**Static.**

**Static.**

"**Goodbye.**"

Hi my name is Maddy, I am 17f and I think my cousin Hanna is trying to kill me. I know that’s a rash thing to say but it’s true. Recently my cousin Hanna moved in, her parents died in a car crash three months ago, she stayed in her room for most of that time, when I would pass her room I would hear whispering and crying, at the time I didn’t think of it as important but now I just don’t know, when she would come out she would ignore everyone. My parents have been very doting on her. I mean I can’t blame them their only niece has lost both of her parents, my dad also isn’t doing so well either, he lost is twin brother, the two were very close to each other so for him half of him is gone. 

My mom isn’t doing so well either, she was very close with my aunt the two were best friends and would go to spa days monthly. However last week I stepped on glass, some prices got into my foot and I had to go to urgent care, I was I. The hospital for a day as the removed the glass. I didn’t need surgery thank goodness, glass in your foot is not lethal but the thing is their is no glass objects in the living room and the windows weren’t broken. 

A few days ago I was in her bedroom and found rat poison. We don’t have an infestation and she offered to cook. What makes me scared is that last night I was sleeping and suddenly woke up, she was staring at me it was terrifying her blue eyes were glowing an ominous she of purple and reflecting off her glasses I stared at her and she stared back. She suddenly turned around and left my room. I didn’t sleep the rest of the night, and today makes me convinced she is trying to kill me. My parents went  out for a date leaving me alone with Hanna. 

I locked myself in my bedroom however suddenly I heard a knock at my door. I opened it and was pushed to the ground immediately. I was scared, Hanna started choking me, my life flashed before my eyes, the days we would play dolls together, chafing each other, baking cookies, doing homework together, I can die like this, I grabbed Hanna’s hands and started pulling her hands away from my neck. The feeling of air rushing into my lungs gave me a huge adrenaline rush. I managed to free my neck entirely and before she could grab me again I kicked her and ran for it. I ran out of the house and am hiding in a public library for the whole day, it’s we’re I am now, hiding from my cousin, best friend, I don’t know what going on but whatever it is it’s not something normal. I mean her eyes were glowing that it not normal.

Me (f32) and my husband (m34) have two children, both fairly young. It’s safe to say we have a good amount of money to provide for our children and us and we definitely love to travel. Since our daughter is four and our son is two, we travel way more than the average family. 

My husband and I decided to buy a cabin up in the mountains so that we’d finally have a getaway that wouldn’t cost us as much as a normal trip. It was our first time going, everyone was excited and overwhelmed, except our toddler who had no idea what was going on. 

When we get there, it’s dark out and our four year old daughter is scared. She’s always had a bad fear of the dark so we keep reminding her that it’s ok. My husband leaves us in the car to turn on all the lights of the cabin so that she feels safe enough to get out of the car. She is completely bawling her eyes out, which makes our two year old cry. I’m sitting to take care of them by myself when suddenly the door opens. My husband brings us all to the cabin, and everything seemed to have calmed down. 

Since it’s night, we send our kids straight to bed. There’s a room for both the kids to sleep in together. There’s a crib and a bunk bed. There’s also a rocking chair, just so you get the idea. My husband and I are unloading and talking about how nice the place is when we hear footsteps. The upstairs is pretty hollow, so we assume it’s our little girl going to get water. 

Eventually they get louder so my husband agreed to check it out, leaving me somewhat alone. I hear crying and assume my scared daughter got scared of something else. I cant help but chuckle a little bit, she’s such a scaredy-cat and while I am worried for her, it’s cute. As I fold another pair of shorts I hear my same laugh repeated in the bathroom. The lights aren’t on, since we haven’t gotten to that part yet. I stop what I’m doing and call out. “Hello?” There’s silence and then there’s a soft whisper, so faint I can barely hear it. It’s my voice. I’m not superstitious or anything but I get super anxious. I leave the room to go upstairs, where everyone is. I don’t shut the door or anything, just go upstairs. I see my husband with a shocked face as he approaches what seems like the last room he’s checking- our kiddos room. He looks over to me and points- our daughter is sound asleep. We both get just a little uneasy, we know she’s probably faking. We go downstairs and back into the room. The door is shut, but I don’t remember ever shutting it. I shrug it off and we go to bed. 

I wake up in the middle of the night feeling super cold. I don’t know exactly what is giving me that feeling but it’s probably just our destination. 

Anyways, it’s the next morning. We’re sitting with our kids at the table and I ask her why she was crying that night. She looks a bit confused and she said she wasn’t crying, and she went to bed. Me and my husband share a look. But then as if it is completely normal, she said, “your probably talking about the mom! She lost her baby, I’d be sad too.” We left that next day. Ever since then I’ve gotten weird vibes and so has my husband.

I’d be lying if I told you my hands weren’t shaking as I lit those incense sticks. I propped them up in a little glass jar and set it between the candles. Then, after a quick glance at Claire and Patrick, I said, “Last chance to back out. You both sure you wanna go through with this?”

Claire bit her bottom lip, nodding slightly, while Patrick rolled his eyes. We were on the hardwood floor next to my bed. Around us, the darkened house slept.

“Wait…you actually think this’ll work?” Patrick asked.

“Wouldn’t go to all this trouble if I didn’t. And FYI, it definitely *won’t* work if you don’t drop the sarcasm. Spirits pick up on bad energies.”

“So ghosts are less likely to appear around sceptics? How convenient.”

Claire said, “Give it a rest, Pat. Nobody forced you to join us. If you’re not into it.” She motioned past their sleeping bags toward the door. Despite her short stature, Claire had more bite in her bark than most people would assume.

Patrick wrinkled his nose. He was a tall guy with rosy cheeks and tidy black hair. For a moment it looked as though he might storm off, but instead, he grabbed his inhaler and took a puff. “I’ll cross my fingers something exciting happens. Will that do?”

“Let’s find out,” I said. “Oh, one more thing. If anything *does* happen, don’t scream. If my mom catches us she’ll throw a fit. She thinks I’ll accidentally summon a demon or something.”

The floral, woody scent of burning incense wafted through the room as I double-checked my notes and adjusted the candles. Patrick made small talk while I finished setting things up. “Who are you trying to contact?” He asked Claire.

“My sister, Alex. She died in a car accident when I was little.”

Patrick started to say, “Is that how—” but then stopped.

“Is that how I got my limp?” she finished.

He shrunk back, deflated. “Sorry.”

“That’s okay. The accident happened over on Bloomfield Avenue. You know that crossing before the bridge?”

“I know it.”

“There never used to be a traffic light there. Dad slowed down to look ahead but didn’t see the oncoming truck.”

She stared at the floor, as though having a terrible vision of her sister. “Alex died, but I got off with thirty-six stitches plus my John Wayne walk.”

Quickly Patrick reached over and clasped her hands inside his. “Let’s hope she’s listening tonight.”

Claire smiled, her brown eyes all shiny with tears.

Patrick’s eyes locked onto mine. I sighed. “My grandpa. I wanna contact my grandpa. He died four years ago. And he…”

The two of them gave me some space. “My dad had…problems. He was probably schizophrenic. He used to do weird stuff, like stand in the corner and talk to walls.”

My heart performed little summersaults in my chest. I sorely wanted to tell them how I’d wake up and find Dad standing at the foot of my bed, a big creepy smile plastered across his face. But at that moment, it felt like he haunted me.

Did they need to know how he stood rooted on the spot, periodically reaching forward to tickle the soles of my feet? Or how I’d wake up and find him squatting alongside the bed, his nose pushed up against mine?

“What are you doing Daddy?” I’d cry. Then he’d whisper, “Making sure you're safe, honey,” while glancing at the walls. And younger me would picture monsters or ghosts or giant rats hidden in the shadow of the room.

No. We could skip all that. I wanted to contact Grandpa. Not Dad.

I said, “Mom tried to make him see a doctor, and when she finally kicked him out, he snapped. He used a spare key to come into the house after dark and,” I hesitated. Images of Dad shaking me awake and cradling my head against his chest while waving a butcher knife around the room reeled before my eyes. I swallowed a gulp. “…and check I was safe. Mom freaked, obviously. The police got involved and it turned into this whole thing.

“Thats when Grandpa stepped in. He was old, but he was built like a bulldozer. Up until his seventies he was doing push-ups and swimming in lakes. When Mom told him what happened he moved in with us. Even brought his gun.”

“He had a gun?” Patrick asked, shocked.

I nodded. “He grew up on a farm and was ex-army. There’s some sort of exemption you can get. Anyway, Dad sued for shared custody, and Grandpa said if any social workers tried to take me away, he’d stick his foot so far up their arses they’d be able to taste his toe jam.”

A half-laugh half-sob escaped from my mouth. “One night, Dad broke in and carried me into his car. While Mom called the police Grandpa grabbed his gun and drove after us. Dad kept saying that he'd—” I paused to think carefully. "That he'd come to rescue me.

“Somehow Grandpa made him swerve off the road, then Dad reached into the glove compartment, grabbed a knife, and circled toward the hood. I remember Grandpa started shooting right as Dad lunged, then they fell past the point where I could see. A little later two police officers arrived, told me to close my eyes, and took me home. They think Dad planned to drive us off a bridge. Something about ‘killing me to protect me’. If Grandpa hadn’t stepped in, I’d be dead. And I never even got a chance to say…”

As my voice trailed off, Patrick and Claire crawled forward to give me a hug. It felt nice.

Patrick said, “I’ve got my fingers *and* toes crossed for you both.”

I cleared my throat and smiled. “Okay. Give me your hands and close your eyes.”

They did.

"We welcome any spirits listening to join our circle. Please make your presence known.”

Silence.

“If any of our loved ones are out there, we’re here. We love you. And we’re listening.”

Even though the house kept still, Claire squeezed my fingers a little tighter. “It’s okay,” I said to her. “Try to relax. It’ll keep the channels clear.”

Addressing the room as a whole, I said, “If you’re out there, give us a sign.”

A window rattled in its housing. Claire’s hand rattled, too.

I said, “Don’t panic, this is what we hoped for.” Then, in a more soothing tone, I added, “We’re here. Whenever you’re ready, reach out.”

A cold draught made all three of us shudder. There was a faint clatter like gentle knocking or mice across the floor. Claire pulled away and stifled a yelp.

“What’s wrong,” I asked, the ritual now abandoned.

“There was something there.” She pointed past Patrick’s shoulder.

I looked at Patrick, who was sitting comfortably. Bored even. “You feel anything?”

He shrugged.

“Was it Alex?” he asked Claire.

“No,” she replied sharply, her eyes darting around the room. “Definitely not.”

“What did it look like?” I asked.

“I don’t know. A shadow. And it was right above your head, Pat.”

“Do you want to keep going?” I asked.

She contemplated for a moment. “Let’s give it another try. But if I see that thing again, I wanna stop.”

“Okay. Give me your hands.”

I straightened my spine. "We welcome any *good* spirits to join our circle.”

Claire’s right hand got all moist and slippery. Mine did too.

I repeated the mantra several times. As I did, those endless, grinning jack-o-lantern nightmares felt very, very close. Ever since grandpa died, I had suffered recurring dreams about giant faces embedded in the walls, their skin made of brick or cracked plaster. They’d smile and yell and laugh. I felt constantly spied on. My therapist said those dreams were a manifestation of the trauma plus guilt about Grandpa’s death. He died protecting me, after all.

Out of nowhere, it felt like we were being watched. That we weren’t alone. I imagined shapes crouched around the room, barely visible against the candlelight.

Patrick reeled his hand away, now breathing heavily, and made a series of quick, rhythmic grunts. Each exhale shook his entire body.

“Patrick?” I asked, concerned.

“It’s the incense.” He coughed into his closed fist several times, before shaking his inhaler. “Keep going.”

My heart settled. After we linked back up, I repeated the mantra. For the next few minutes, there was absolute silence, interrupted only by Patrick’s occasional sputters.

Out of nowhere a chill slid up my spine, across my shoulders, spreading out. I wondered whether the others felt this dizzying sense of presence.

The presence swam over Claire and settled between us. It couldn't be anything corporeal. My heart kicked into a higher gear—had Grandpa come to say goodbye? Invisible fingertips caressed my hair. My legs began to wobble. I peeked out of my right eye. The candles flickered, threatening to go out. My friend’s misty breaths pooled together with the incense fumes, and for a moment it almost looked as though there was something there. A face in the condensation.

Summoning all my courage, I whispered, “Grandpa?”

Claire trembled; Patrick shuddered. Somebody walked over his grave, Grandpa would say. He felt so close.

“If you’re there, please—"

Before I could finish, Patrick fell onto the floor like a rag doll. My pulse skyrocketed. While Patrick rolled around fighting for air, Claire and I dove forward, knocking over the incense and candles, and each grabbed an arm. His throat sounded like a rusty chainsaw struggling to start. Globs of saliva ran all along this chin.

Maybe Mom was right—maybe we *had* invited some kind of demon into our circle.

He went into furious convulsions, then grabbed my wrist and groaned ‘inhaler’ between ratcheted coughs. That settled me down a little. Patrick could barely manage a breath, but at least it was a human problem. I grabbed the inhaler, gave it a shake, held it up to his mouth, and pushed the trigger. His coughing fit gradually tapered off into minor growls and sniffs.

“Are you okay?” I asked, once he was well enough to sit up.

He nodded.

I strained to listen. The house stayed completely still. My mom hadn’t heard the racket.

Slouching back, I said, “Okay, I guess we’re done.”

Claire let out a sigh of relief, one hand against her chest. For the next few minutes, I rubbed Patrick’s back, until his breathing sounded normal, then my friends climbed into their sleeping bags while I cleared up the candles, hopped into bed, and pulled up my banket. “Night everyone,” I said.

Claire said goodnight while Patrick stayed oddly quiet.

None of us made contact, which sucked, but at least we stayed safe. For a moment I actually thought that weird presence had attacked Patrick; my heart was still beating a little too fast. But now it was gone. We could forget the whole thing ever happened.

Sometime after midnight, that odd sense of presence returned, hanging over my room like a storm cloud. I studied the room and everything in it. How come my friends hadn’t stirred? No way anybody could sleep through this—it was like being trapped in the jungle, surrounded by trees and undergrowth. Watched by unseen eyes.

As I pulled the blanket over my head, that awful sensation seemed to swell. I steered my thoughts elsewhere—to how Grandpa would race me from the playpark to his car, always giving me enough of a head start to win.

Those fond memories dissolved when something shuffled across the wooden floor. Slowly, very slowly, I pulled the blanket down toward my chin.

My nightshirt became a drenched rag against my back. I expected to see the faces in the walls staring down at me. Grinning. Laughing.

But the walls were empty. Normal. For a moment my pulse settled. But then, once my eyes adjusted to the gloom, I had to bite down on a scream. Because there was an out-of-place object peeking up over the foot of my bed; the top half of somebody’s head. A pale face against the darkness.

It was Patrick. Except he seemed…*different*. His skin had grooves that weren’t there before, and the corners of his mouth were curled into an awful, pumpkin grin.

Still squatting low he shuffled along around the edge of the bed and stopped directly beside me. Now there wasn’t a single doubt in my mind Patrick had been replaced. Forced out. Used as a mask by whatever entity invaded our séance.

After swallowing a gulp, I worked up the courage to say, “What are you doing, Pat?”

Then the figure reached forward, pushing those distorted lips right up against my ear, and whispered, [“Making sure you’re safe, honey.”](https://www.reddit.com/r/thoughtindustry/comments/te0fum/welcome_i_hope_you_enjoy_your_stay/)

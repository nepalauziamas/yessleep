In a galaxy far far away, known as my bedroom, my mother barged through the door and exclaimed that we were going to visit my grandfather. He was in the hospital, was that way for eight years at that point. I couldn't fathom how he was still alive.

In the car, Ma said that he wasn't expecting us. I was very confused, but she hastily added that we were surprising him. I wasn't very excited, but that lack of emotion was shortly lived.

We arrived shortly after that awkward conversation, but I still wasn't happy to be there.

"Welcome, is there anything I can help you with today?"

The nurse who said that caught me off guard, I wasn't expecting her to be that close to the door. I was kinda threw all off, so I just had to reset for a second. God, what I would've given to stay in that second if I only knew.

Anyway, I left my mom to go use the bathroom. On the way, however, was an exceptional feeling I can't begin to describe. I foolishly ignored though, thinking it was the piss.

It was a one person, the bathroom. Odd for a hospital, but I couldn't care less; I had to pee so much I felt like I could run at the speed of sound. After using the facilities, I noticed that I heard no noise. Now, that'd be fine if I was at home, but not at a public hospital full of people. I opened the door, and there it was. Oh wait, you don't what IT is.

It looks like a giant worm but also a werewolf. I didn't look long before shut the door. But that wasn't it. That THING fucking HEARD ME. I peeked through the keyhole to get a better look, and I wish I hadn't. It was a giant fat worm that had four fangs that looked like giant mecha-spider legs around its mouth. It also had fur all over it, brown fur. The thing was at least nine feet tall, and made the most blood curdling screech I've ever heard. It did hear, after all, so it jumped up into the ceiling above it. IT WAS FUCKING COMING FOR ME. 

I felt like I couldn't have gotten out of that bathroom sooner. I ran for my life as I crossed into another wing of the hospital. Standing in front of me..... guess. Yep, it was another one of those fucking worms. I saw a closet, so I hid in it. I peeked through, because I also noticed that the worms didn't have eyes. Without it being able to see me, I just needed to be quiet. I heard it leave, so I left the closet.

That's when I was greeted by a sight more horrific than I could've possibly imagined, everyone was dead. Everyone must've been eaten by those fucking worms. I didn't care about my own survival anymore, I just wanted to see my mom; I just want to see that she's okay. There was blood everywhere and the place was thrashed, but I had to have hope. She'll be fine, that's what I kept telling myself.

I heard a closet shift while sneaking through the hallway. It must be another person! I sluggishly approached the noise, but then I heard a noise in the same very room; sounded like the ceiling crashing in. And sure enough, I soon heard screams while I also heard the flesh being torn apart by the worm thing. While it was distracted, I decided to run. Terrible idea, looking back. But I was way too scared to care. Poor flaw to have in that situation.

After looking at the front desk for my grandpa's file, I trudged through the hospital to the room marked 103, his room. I slid a piece of paper under the door as to not make noise, but I got no response. I gently knocked on the door, still no response. I got desperate, I smashed that door with everything I had; and for a 16 year old I did pretty damn well. Door fell, anyway.

Maybe I wish I went sooner, maybe I wish I failed to open the door; either way, the scene before me was..... gruesome. My mother's head was gone, but I knew it was her. Her necklace was still on her neck. My grandpa was completely gone, blood stained bed was the only thing left in his place. I ran away as fast as I could.

The exit was close, so I made a break straight for it. I heard the worms behind me, but I didn't care; that stupid fucking door was my only way out. But I made it, I made it out of that hell hole. I made it out, only to find more worms everywhere. I didn't know what to do, I was out in the open with nowhere to hide. So, I just broke down crying. I cried myself to sleep as the wereworms of death stood over me. They took everyone I cared about; my mom was the only one who I cared about, and they fucking at her head off. As I woke up, they were all gone. I didn't go back in that hospital, I didn't ask any questions ever. I went the fuck home and left everything behind in a fit of fear.

That was twelve years ago, and my mom has been gone through all of it; I lived my aunt after the fiasco. I lied about what happened, I couldn't let her think I was crazy. Since, I've never looked back, I'm too scared to. So, I just went on with life. As best I could anyway, as those stupid fucking worms haunt my dreams. That screech I heard from the first one I saw, that sound is the one I remember the most.
Love you mom, fucking hate you worms, good fucking riddance of you floppy dick looking fucks.

So yeah, that's why I'm scared of hospitals. I probably always will be too, so I can't do much there. Only, something tells me that I'll never be free of those fuckers, whether that be running into them again or just having them in my nightmares. So yeah, That's why I'm horrified of hospitals, not cause of blood, cause of giant wereworms that can't see. Fuck, maybe I am crazy.

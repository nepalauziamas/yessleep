I was driving my girlfriend home after she got off work one night and I noticed a man standing under a street lamp on the corner. She saw him too and we talked about why he was there. Maybe he needed help. We both agreed I should at least check on him so she got out and gave me a kiss, telling me to be safe before heading up to her apartment. I watched him for a minute, he was looking around quickly, like maybe he thought someone was after him. I felt my gut barking at me to leave him be, he might be crazy or on drugs, he could steal the car or my wallet. For a brief moment we locked eyes and I saw genuine fear and that made my gut quiet down and my courage rise. 

I drove over to where he sat and pulled up to the light, rolling down the passenger side window to talk with him. He didn’t get up right away, he just looked around for anyone else and gave me a suspicious look. 

“You doin’ all right, man?” 

I said, trying to be as friendly as I could. He ignored me until I heard a dog bark somewhere nearby and that made him jump like something had poked him between the shoulders. The dog barked a few times more and I could see the man was in terror. 

“You want a ride somewhere?” 

I asked, trying to calm him down.

He got up and came to the door without taking his eyes off where the dog had barked. As he got in I looked him over. His arms were filthy but no track marks, his face was haggard and his eyes bloodshot but I didn’t smell alcohol on his breath. He was wearing slacks that were worn down at the knees and a crusty gray snow jacket with fur around the hood that had turned to a matted mess the color of a coyote pelt from years of dirt and grime. He wasn’t wearing a shirt under it and his skin was hard and dry like leather and stretched tight over his ribs. No prison tattoos.

He looked a bit more relaxed once he was in the car and asked with a voice like sandpaper on leather, 

“Can you take me to the bus station, sir?” 

I looked at him harshly and said, 

“Look man, I’ll take you where ever you need to go, but you have to tell me if you have any weapons on you and if you do, you put them out the window. Understand? The same for any drugs.” 

The man nodded and held out his hands. 

“I got no weapons and never had no drugs, sir.” 

I looked for any signs of a lie in his eyes but saw none. As we drove he began to tell me where he was going.

He came from further south, almost two states away. “Name’s Walker. Been doin just that for goin on 26 years now. Been all over. Seen some things that’d make you swear off sleep for the rest of your days. Bein on the streets is like bein a ghost. Some notice you, some are scared a you. But most just ignore you. You become invisible. Living that way will drive anyone crazy after a while because you see people do stuff they’d never do if someone was lookin. Funny things some times, but mostly bad things. Things that will turn your heart black and poisonous if you let it.” 

He looked out the window, I could only imagine the memories that brought up for him. He talked easily for a man who lived on the streets. There was a fearless resignation to him and it made me uneasy.

As we drove toward the station I asked him why he came here and where he was heading. He took a deep breath and thought for a moment. 

“I had to get away from somethin bad, down south. No gangs or cops or nothin, just-” 

He looked out at the streets, trying to find the words. 

“I had come in off a boxcar near the border a Mexico. Was travelin with a couple of roadies I’d met further west. We went into the town and talked with some of the locals and they pointed us toward a camp nearby the trainyard where we could stay. It was a shanty town under a rail bridge about a 40 minute walk from downtown. There was a half dozen guys there and they seemed okay. We found a spot and set up our camp and found out the good spots for food and supplies from the locals. Everything seemed normal until it got dark.”

“There was a communal fire pit at the center of this place. They told us it had to burn all night, that because we was new we would have to tend the fire for a few nights. When I tried askin about it they’d beat around the bush or just stop talkin all together. It was Big Bear that noticed the factory aways outside of camp. Big Bear was one of the guys traveling with me. The man was a mountain of hair and filth but he was the nicest person you could ever meet. He had a laugh that made you want to laugh just by hearing it. Bear brought up the factory to one of the locals and they acted like he’d called the devil by name.” 

We had pulled up to a red light and he stopped a moment looking out at an all night diner with a kind of hesitant expression.

I could see he was hungry and I wanted to hear what happened to him so I suggested we stop in for some coffee and a bite to eat before moving on. He looked at me a gave me a sad smile before agreeing with a bashful thanks. After we ordred and got our coffees, he told me about the factory and what supposedly lived there. 

“I seen the place comin in. Looked like a packing plant gone out of business long before I was born. So old, there weren’t no roads leadin to it, at least none you could see. Never woulda know it was there unless you were to walk up on it. From a distance it didn’t look like anything but an old building. It was when you got close you started to notice things weren’t right.”

“No one in the camp would talk about it. All they said was somethin bad lived in there and it was a bad idea to talk about it, or even think about it. Now, you come across a lot a superstitions out on the road. The life on the streets is a world of talismans, taboos, and good luck charms. Stuff you never say out loud or something you carry with you or bury near your camp to keep bad luck away. When ya have no control a your world and the terrible things it can do to ya, ya find ways of controling it, even if its bullshit. I reckon people been doin that longer than we been writin or talkin. But this kind of fear, this kind of taboo, was somethin I’d never seen before.”

“They lived in terror of this place, but they found they could stay out of harms way by ignoring it. That and keeping the fire going at night. That first night the three of us took shifts keeping the fire going. I took the first shift, then Glenn took his, finally Bear had the last shift before sunrise. The next morning I could tell something was bothering him so I asked him if something happened. He said he heard sounds coming from that factory. Said they was like animal sounds but like if a man were imitatin em. Couple a times he said it sounded like it was laughin or maybe screamin, he didn’t know. He just knew he didn’t like it.”

“We rotated the times between us for a few weeks and it was always the last watch when you’d hear somethin out there. The sounds reminded me of a lunatic screaming in th night. Lots a folks on the street aren't right in the head and I been woken up by one screamin his head off or babbling in the middle of the night. Thats what the sounds were like. One time I thought I’d seen eye shine like an animal in the dark. Sometimes there would be a terrible smell that would drift through. A god awful smell, and let me tell you, I’ve been around rot, shit, and garbage but this was like nothing else. It made you feel smaller, like you was tryin to retreat back into yerself to get away from it. It was a wrong smell. Thats the closest I ever came to describin it.” 

He shuddered slightly and held his coffee up, taking a sniff as if to chase the memory of that smell away.

He shook his head and looked down as he spoke.

 “Glenn took off after a week. Couldn’t handle the weirdness. Bear and I stuck around for some damn fool reason. I cant recall what it was, honestly, but we stayed. It was a little while later Bear started actin funny. He was keepin to himself more and he looked worn, like he might be sick or couldn’t sleep. When I asked him what was wrong he said he seen somethin a few nights back. He seen what lived in that factory, and he said it seen him too. He’d been hearin sounds like always but then he heard something closer, a dragging sound. He had to leave the fire light and let his eyes adjust to see it out there in the moonlight, but he seen it. He said it looked like a pile of rags wearing an old oily black wig. There was little glints of white hangin off it and he swore they was bones, small and large. It was draggin a sack behind it and out the back through a hole, a white hand, pure as pearl in the moonlight, was draggin on the ground from inside.”

“That was when the thing looked right at him. Its eyes caught the fire light like an animal and glowed like embers. He felt all the strength run out of him and fell to the ground. He was trying to crawl back to the fire but it was like he’d been drained. The thing let out a laugh like a coyote call and that got him moving again and he made it back to the fire. He said since then he hadn’t slept, except a bit during the day. He would hear it sometimes, little yips and barks. The smell seemed to follow him everywhere and he lost all appetite because of it. Every day he looked worse. I covered his spot tending the fire at night but still he would wake up screaming in his bag if he’d managed to sleep at all. Then one day he was gone.” 

He took a sip of coffee with a shaky hand and shook his head.

“The guy at the fire said they seen him get up and walk out into the dark. No light, no expression, not a word to any of em. Just walked off in the direction of the factory. There weren’t no noises that night, or any of the next nights. I tried to get some of the others to help e look for Bear in that old factory but none of em would. Can’t blame em, really. Can’t believe I went myself, but I did. Bear was one of the only decent folks I’d come across out there and I felt I owed it to him. So off I went. During daylight of course. God himself couldn’t make me go there at night. Other than what put me there in the first place, that was the worst mistake of my life.”

“The building was only half standing. It looked like a hollywood set, the framework and outer walls giving the illusion of a building with nothing inside. There were little windows at the base that must have led to a basement and I could see a clear path to and from one of the larger broken panes that must have been where whatever lived there came and went. I looked down into it but the darkness was as solid as cloth inside and I went to the front entrance instead. The doors were rusted off the hinges and a solid metal chain held them to the center frame where they hung like angel wings. Inside was bright and open, the roof having decayed and crumbled over the years.”

“There were huge rusting hunks of machinery and old meat hooks on long rusting poles. The stench of the place was overpowering. It was that same wrong smell I’d catch now and then at night, only this was like standing at the source. I had to hold my shirt over my mouth to go any further. That was when I noticed it. It was dead quiet. There wasn’t a single bug chirping or bird calling. Even the wind had stopped. The only sound was a dull buzzing, like an unseen swarm of flies. As I noticed this I realized I was standing before an open cellar door. The corroded stairs went down into that eerily solid darkness and all I could see at the bottom was a mass of some god awful sludge and standing stagnant water, orange with rot and rust.” 

“There were bright white bones jutting out of it and clumps of old sun bleached fur. Even more confusing there were scattered around it several white sausage shapes, some floating in the slime and others down at the bottom. I only saw what might have been animal teeth somewhere in the sludge before the smell became so overwhelming I turned and ran, but not before hearing what sounded like clattering bones and someone clicking their teeth together down there. As I ran my mind was finally able to process that the sausages scattered around down there hadn’t been sausages at all. They were fingers.”

He swallowed hard and looked like he might faint. I called the waitress over for more coffee, looking around the diner to give my mind a break. This was not how I thought this night would go. I thought I’d be doing a man a favor and scoring a few points of karma for myself, maybe get an interesting story to tell later. But this. This was different. His story was of course utterly mad, and yet there was no sign of illness or fraud in the old man. I couldn’t make sense of it, so I resigned to keep listening.

“I did end up seeing Big Bear one last time, in a way. I was tending the fire one night and I heard him call out to me from the dark. I was surprised as hell to hear his voice again, it sounded just like him. I couldn’t see hardly nothing out there but once my eyes adjusted I seen him. He looked like he was hunched over, just beyond the fire light. Wearin the same clothes he wore all the time, only they was stained black with somethin, like he’d been rolling in old motor oil. His face was oddly slack, like he’d been shot with a muscle relaxer. It was his eyes that made me see it weren’t him. They were just dark holes, like little caves, and somewhere deep inside something caught the fire light and glimmered. I just turned away from him and stared at the fire. Ignoring anything I heard from the dark. Forcing the fear away by focusing on the fire until morning came.”

“That was when things got worse. That terrible smell followed me everywhere. I couldn’t sleep, couldn’t think. I started hearing voices. Sometimes it would sound like Bear, or Glenn. Other times it sounded like my wife. I hadn’t even thought of her in so long. Hearing her voice come out of the dark like that scared me worse than anything.” 

He gripped the coffee mug tightly and looked away with painful embarrassment. 

“That was a long time ago now. I aint told that story to anyone, but I might as well tell you, things being as they are.” 

He looked at his hands like a man condemned. 

“I left because I killed my little girl. She was only 2 months.” His voice broke as he said it and I could see his eyes gloss over. “Had a house and a wife then. Good wife. God I miss her. She was an angel. She had a fever, real bad, couldn’t stay out of bed longer than a few minutes. How she took care of our little girl before I’d gotten home from work I’ll never know. It was up to me to watch over her and the little one that night. I fed her, changed her, put her to bed, everything I was supposed to. Once she were asleep I thought I could relax a little. Got me a couple beers and settled down to watch TV for a bit. Just a normal night.” 

He shook his head as though he were trying to shoo away a fly that was bothering him.

“Well maybe I had one too many, or maybe I was just dead tired from the day, or maybe I was just a water headed fool with two left hands and no right to the life I had. My girl, my baby girl, she woke up crying and I went to her. Everything was a blur for me, the house felt like we was on a ship in rough seas. I tried to help her, to hold her, but she fell.” 

His voice broke again and he took a couple hard breaths to steady himself. 

“I dropped her. I dropped my baby girl and she hit the floor. God, that sound.” 

He sniffed and tensed as though he were pulling a long splinter. 

“She weren’t breathing, she weren’t cryin no more. I knew she was dead. I held her in my arms and I said I was sorry over and over. I thought about my wife, how she would hate me for what I’d done, how she would scream and cry and curse me until the day I died. I went into full panic. I picked up my little girl and I wrapped her and put her back in the crib. I didn’t even take anything, I just ran. I ran until my legs gave out and I collapsed in an alley and screamed myself hoarse.” 

He didn’t look at me as he finished his story, he just looked out at the dark streets.

“Been out here ever since.” 

His voice was steady again. 

“Thought about dyin every day but I aint earned that. I been through the wringer. Been beaten, stabbed, raped, starved, sick with anything and everything and still I aint suffered enough for what I done. And now…” 

He trailed off. 

“Wow.” 

That was all I could think to say. He seemed to be thinking hard about something. 

“I’m sorry to ask but-” 

He shook his head as if he’d decided something. 

“I didn’t come here to catch a bus, you see. This town is where I used to live, before all this. I came to see her one last time. To tell her I’m sorry and get some closure, you know? Hell, she may not even live here anymore, but if you could take me there so I could try, well, I’d appreciate it.” 

He looked at me, his eyes still glossy and I agreed.

We agreed to go after he finished his story and a few more coffees. 

“The dreams that came when I managed to sleep at all. They were the worst. I was always back in that factory, looking down into that hole, seeing those fingers scattered around the filth and then a scream would wake me up only it was me screamin myself awake. I had to get away from that camp so I went into town and found a shelter that would have me.”

“Not all shelters are bad, but I’d learned to steer clear of them over the years. You risk getting robbed or worse when you’re in a place regular people expect you to be. Better to find your own space away from anyone. But right then I needed to be around regular people. I needed a building with doors and locks. That first night they almost threw me out when I woke up screaming. The next night I woke up with the night guard yelling in my face as I was trying to go out the locked front doors. I tried not to sleep and every night the sounds from the factory would ring out in the distance, getting closer it seemed. If anyone else noticed they wouldn’t say anything.”

“I wanted them to put me in a locked room or tie me to the bed but they just thought I was crazy and offered me rehab or a church. One night I came out of a dream and I was standing in a dark field. I didn’t know where I was or how I’d got there. Then I heard the howls and I could see the shape of that factory in the moonlight. Christ, I had almost walked right into it. I turned and ran back to town, completely shaken.”

“What made me leave that place and come back here after all this time was a dream. I don’t even remember fallin asleep, I was just standin in the dark of the shelter, lookin up at the moon. It looked like the roof of the place got torn off. The place was empty, all the cots full of snoring shapes were gone. All I could see in the blue light of the moon was big shapes of machines. That was when I realized where I was and I turned around to see the opening to the cellar behind me, like an open mouth pouring out rotten breath.” 

He wiped sweat from his brow, his face had gone a sickly green as he remembered. 

“It was quiet as the grave, just like before, only now there was clattering like bones bein dropped or kicked around on concrete comin from that hole. There was a wet slapping sound like meat being tossed and dragged. And beneath all that what I heard coming from that hole was a low muttered whisper, unintelligible and constant. I felt like I wasn’t in my body no more. I saw myself standing at the mouth of that hole and I saw myself take a step toward it. Everything in me screamed to stop, but I kept walking. The terror was a dull roar that overpowered everything except that low whisper. Thats when I heard somethin I can’t believe, even now.” 

He took a heavy shuddering breath.

“I heard a baby cryin. My little girl. I knowed it was her. I’ll never forget that sound and the devil take me if I ever do. I heard my little girl and it shook me out of my dream or trance or whatever had me. Only I didn’t wake up in the shelter. I came back to myself but I was still there, in that place, in the dark. I don’t have any idea how I got to be there but the realization almost gave me a heart attack from pure terror. I turned away from that black open mouth and ran. I ran through the dark brush and along the train tracks harder than I ever ran before. And all the time I can hear it barking and laughing behind me. Sometimes so close I could almost feel the heat of its breath on my neck. I jumped a train, damn near killed myself doin it, and left.”

He finished his coffee and seemed to collect himself. 

“At first I just wanted to get as far away as possible, but after hearin my little girl again, even if it were just a dream, I wanted to come back here. Maybe bein so close to somethin so evil made me feel like I had suffered enough, or maybe gettin away from it was a sign I was ready. Maybe after facin something like that, facing my past wasn’t so bad.” 

He shook his head like he still couldn’t figure out how he came to that decision. 

After we finished our coffees and he had finished his story, it was getting close to 3 AM. He looked outside at the dark streets and for a moment a look of pure panic flashed across his face. I spun around to look in the direction he was looking and I saw a dark shape slip out of view in an alleyway. I only saw it for a moment but I could have sworn I’d seen eye shine like a cat’s eyes from within that dark mass. Walker was breathing hard and I could see tears streaming down his cheeks. 

“What was that?” 

I said to no one in particular. After hearing his story, my mind conjured all manner of nightmarish fantasies, but nothing approaching logic. 

I tried to comfort him but he was shaking his head in his hands, muttering under his breath. After a minute he started to calm down and looked at me as though he’d forgotten I was there. 

“Thank you, for everything, sir. I really appreciate you listenin and buyin me that meal and all. I think I’ll just stay here till mornin and head out. Might even get myself a haircut and a Thrift Store suit.” 

I asked if he wanted me to stay and give him a ride somewhere but he waved me off. 

“You done plenty for me, son. I know my way around this town. I’ll find out if my wife still lives around here and even if she don’t I think I’ll stick around a while, maybe try to salvage somethin from the wreck of my life. Fresh start and all that.” 

I could see he wasn’t lying but I also knew he didn’t think he’d be doing any of that anytime soon. He looked damned. 

I gave him what cash I had and made sure he was okay before I left. He tried to smile and look hopeful but his eyes told me different. I had to leave him there, there was nothing else I could do. I didn’t see him again for a few weeks after that night. I hoped he had found his wife and was able to get some sort of closure, but after seeing him again I don’t think that would be possible. I caught a glimpse of him under a street light one night, just standing and staring up at my window. He looked disheveled and slack somehow, like he’d lost 40 pounds and was just floating in his clothes. His eyes were just empty dark holes and I could have sworn I saw a glimmer of something deep inside them. 

Lately I’ve noticed a lot of lost pet signs all over the neighborhood, it seems like every power pole and street sign has at least two signs asking about a missing dog or cat. Maybe there are coyotes around here. I could have sworn I heard them howling close by one night. Maybe they killed something nearby. That would explain the terrible smell around here lately. I should warn my girlfriend about them, she’s been trying to scare me lately by hiding outside the house at night and calling my name. Maybe I’ll go out and surprise her one night, see how she likes it.

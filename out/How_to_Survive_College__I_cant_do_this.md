Okay so I guess I have three friends now.  Cassie, Grayson, and now Maria.  She’s been messaging me non-stop since the library incident, I swear.  A lot of ‘hey Ashley what do you think about this campus superstition’ or ‘hey Ashley what do you know about this monster’ or ‘hey Ashley I was thinking of dyeing my hair pink.’  I told her to go for it, but to use professional hair dye products (don’t make my mistakes) and now I’m going to go help her with that tomorrow evening.  I’m not sure why she needs my help reading the instructions on the box but whatever, at least I have a new friend I guess.

If you’re like “what about Steven, aka Chicken Tenders, why isn’t he on the list” it’s because I think we broke up.  I’m not sure.  He sent me a passive aggressive message late one night about how it wasn’t fair to keep putting him off and if I was so concerned about my grades, then I should just take him up on his offer to tutor me.  Except I think I’m smarter than him.  I don’t mean to sound conceited, but when we were talking about school stuff he was like oh I’ll explain it and then I *got it* and he kept trying to keep explaining it to me and only stopped once I explained it *back* to him.  Like I had to prove I understood it.

I know I’m worried about my grades but I feel like midterms caught me off-guard and I learned the hard way I’m not a good test taker.  I’m killing it on my projects and essays, right?  And I’m not having trouble understanding things in the classroom.

I don’t know, I feel like a gigantic snob at the moment.  Am I being stuck-up?

Anyway, I replied to him saying I’d be happy to go on a date this weekend because I just felt like that was what he wanted but he hasn’t responded to me.

I’ve never broken up with someone.  I’m assuming that him not replying means he doesn’t want to talk to me ever again, which is a break-up, right?

I’m trying to make friends with the Rain Chaser inner circle.  It’s a little more difficult.  They’re a lot more reserved and Patricia doesn’t need help dying their hair pink.

Patricia is their unofficial leader.  The one that vibrates like she just slammed a Red Bull chaser on top of three cups of coffee.  Like I don’t think I’ve ever seen her when she’s not bouncing a foot or tapping her fingers or something.  And I’ve seen her a few more times now.  When Maria announced on their discord that she’d had an encounter with the library ghost (because she couldn’t wait to tell everyone at the weekly meeting) I got a private message from Patricia.  She wanted to know if I’d made any progress, since Maria made sure to mention I was with her and had *saved her life*.

(try and top THAT, Katana Boy)

When I told her I had, she suggested we meet up on campus and I could tell her in person.  I waited for her outside her class until it let out and then we walked together towards our respective dorms.  Technically I didn’t have class in the same area as her, that was a total lie, but I felt like since she’d made the suggestion first I should just… go along with it.  Even if that meant I had to walk all the way here from my dorm only to turn around and walk all the way back.

I hope it was worth it.  I told her about my encounter with the ghost and that it appeared to grow angry when I tried to save Maria.  I didn’t know what had set it off, I confessed with embarrassment, hoping that my lack of specifics wouldn’t disqualify me.  Instead, I tried to make some suggestions on what could be going on with the library ghost.  There were some good theories in the comments on my last post, after all, and I felt I'd be remiss if I didn't bring them up along with my own thoughts.  I felt a little guilty for essentially taking credit for the collective theorizing here, but I didn't want to be like oh by the way I'm totally posting all this online, considering how exclusive this group has been so far.  I hope no one is offended.  Anyway, I'd only gotten through the first two ideas (that the ghost doesn't like people that put themselves into danger or that the ghost died trying to save someone else)

Then she interrupted me before I could get much further.

"We try not to theorize too much," Patricia said dismissively.  "I don't think it's very helpful without more information."

"I respectfully disagree," I said.  "We have a wealth of information that already exists in stories and by theorizing which of those apply, we might be able to identify some general trends that can help us avoid any potential dangers."

Hahah just kidding.

"O-oh," is what I actually said.

I kind of wish I knew more about Kate when she had just inherited the campground.  I was barely potty-trained back then, though, so I only know her from working at the campground the past couple of years.  She's always seemed incredibly confident and inapproachable when I was working there.  Like, she had everything figured out.  I assumed it was because she *did* have everything figured out but after reading everything she posted I feel the reality is a lot more complicated.  Maybe Kate wasn't as in control as I believed, but she sure acted like it, and I think that confidence is what allowed her to do the things she did.  We need someone that isn't afraid like I am.  Someone that doesn't hesitate and doesn't freeze up.

If Patricia isn't interested in speculating, then fine.  I'm not going to alienate her over it.  I'll keep my theories to myself and once I have something more certain, I'll bring it up again.

In the meantime, we had bigger problems.

Remember the guy that had the scratching outside his door?  He’s in one of my classes.  I didn’t realize this until just now because he’s not been in class since the Rain Chasers meeting.  I also have terrible facial recognition, so I didn’t realize it was him right away.  It’s not like I take notice of my classmates on any given day.

Maybe this is why I don’t have friends.

Anyway, I went through class completely oblivious to the fact he was staring at me intently the entire time.  I left as I always did and stepped out into the hallway, my mind preoccupied on what I would have for lunch.  Risk the cafeteria linguini or go with a safe peanut butter and jelly sandwich.

Someone grabbed me from behind.  A hand closed on my arm.  I froze in place, my breath seizing in my throat, and I don't think I could have yelled if I'd wanted to.

"I recognize you," a man's voice said from behind me, his voice thin with panic.  "You were at the meeting."

Slowly, my frozen muscles resumed function.  I turned, certain my eyes were wide and my cheeks were pale, but the student behind me was oblivious to how badly he'd startled me.

"Meeting?" I croaked.

"The Rain Chasers."  He elaborated as I continued to stare at him in mute confusion.  "I came to the meeting recently.  There's... scratching... at my door."

Oh.  Ohhhhh.  That guy.

“I did what they suggested,” he continued.  “I left campus.”

I guess Maria and the rest of them can have good ideas after all.

“Did it… work?” I ventured.

"It did.  But now I'm back here."

He glanced around nervously and finding that we were surrounded by our classmates, still filing out of the classroom, he grabbed my arm impatiently again and pulled me in the opposite direction as them.  I shook him off in annoyance.  I don't like being grabbed.  I don't care how freaked out he was.  It's rude.

"I did leave," he continued, lowering his voice.  "But now I'm back.  This is my first class of the day and I don't remember how I got here.  I went to sleep in my bed at home last night and now I'm here."

He stared at me expectantly, as if I had all the answers and could tell him what he had to do now.  This isn't fair, I thought wildly.  Why am I responsible for saving him?  I can barely help my roommate with a totally mundane matter, how am I supposed to save every person that crosses my path?  I just want to pass my finals and not get involved in any more *weird stuff*.

Alas.  I found myself standing in the hallway with another desperate student and I couldn’t bring myself to be like ‘guess you’ll just die’ and walk away.  I told him I’d contact some of the experts in the Rain Chasers and see if they had any other suggestions.  Not Maria.  *Obviously* not Maria.

I got his phone number.  Then I messaged Patricia.  She messaged me back, asking me to meet them in the old power plant that evening, as soon as the sun was down.  Use the steam tunnels, she said.  They’d leave the door unlocked.

I relayed this to the student.  Said if he met me at my dorm, I’d take him through the steam tunnels.  That I didn’t know what this was about, but it might be dangerous.

He agreed to come with me.

I don’t know his name.  Guess it doesn’t matter now.

Desperation is a funny thing.  He was desperate to survive and that was what made him meet me at the entrance to the steam tunnels in the basement of my dorms.  As for me, I’m not sure what drove me to escort him through the underground labyrinth.  I didn’t feel desperate.  I wanted answers and I wanted to help him, but I’m not sure if I was quite at the point of desperation yet.

I wish I was.  It might be a better excuse.

We made it to the power plant uneventfully.  He didn’t seem nervous about being down in the steam tunnels, but I suppose he was already dealing with things more terrifying than some creepy tunnels.  I’d never been to the power plant, but I had the map to guide us.

I’ve seen it on campus, obviously.  The chimneys are visible between the buildings on the north edge of campus.  I never see them producing any smoke, probably because it runs on natural gas these days.  That’s about the extent of what I know about it.  It’s not like Patricia or her cronies told me anything other than to show up.  The student I was leading there didn’t ask any questions, either.  He’d decided that whatever was going to happen, he’d go along with it, because he didn’t have any other options, I suppose.

I emerged into the plant basement.  There was hardly anything in it - just a vast expanse broken up by thick, square, brick columns.  The roof was low and I couldn’t help but feel claustrophobic.  It was easy to tell where to go, at least.  Since the basement was empty save for the columns, I could clearly see the ring of light emanating from a single lantern in the middle of the room.  I took out my phone and turned on the flashlight, wishing I’d had the forethought to bring one.  I guess I didn’t expect it to be this dark.  Kind of makes sense though, we were trespassing.  I’m sure the university administration would look even less kindly on students in the power plant than the steam tunnel.  Patricia wouldn’t turn on the lights and risk discovery.

They were gathered in a tight cluster as we approached.  Patricia was literally bouncing, raising off the balls of her feet and then back down again.  A tarp was behind them, perhaps fifteen by fifteen feet, weighed down at the corners by bricks.

“Okay, here’s the deal,” Patricia said, wasting no time.  “We’re unlikely to be interrupted because the door leading out of the basement is kept shut and is really thick.  But keep your voices down anyway.  Here.  Let’s move the bricks.”

The inner circle Rain Chasers quickly moved to comply.  They pulled the tarp away and uncovered what it was hiding.  I stared in horrid fascination at what was underneath.

A black slab.  Rectangular, perhaps ten feet by eight feet, and recessed into the floor.  I couldn’t tell how far down it was.  In the darkness, it felt like a hole in the world, and it was hard to focus on its exact placement.

I thought of the ocean I found.  The hole swallowing up the water.  There was this same sense of dread, of being infinitesimally small and helpless.  Involuntarily, I shivered and stepped away from it.

“-former Rain Chaser found it,” Patricia was saying.  “He thought it felt unnatural and spent a lot of time watching it, trying to figure it out.  He graduated last year, but not before he told me all about it.  Didn’t want it to be forgotten.  We’ve been coming out here every now and then, trying to unlock its secrets ourselves.”

It certainly felt *wrong*.  I want to be clear - it didn’t feel evil or anything.  It wasn’t like there was an innate *badness* about it.  It felt unnatural in the same way every unnatural thing feels.  Like the world around you is sharper and clearer, like light and sound worked in different ways now.  The thing repulsed me, but it was more like two magnets pushing each other away.  We were both made of this reality, but we were incompatible.

“What do you think it is?” the scratching student asked nervously.

“We don’t deal in theories,” she said curtly.  “Just results.”

The slab was inset only a few inches, she continued.  The former Rain Chaser measured it with a ruler.  There’s also a layer of water covering it.  It never ripples, no matter how much you disturb it.  Things that are thrown onto it remain there and can be retrieved.

She demonstrated with a pebble.  The water didn’t ripple and when she bent over to pick up the pebble, I felt my skin crawl.  There *was* water.  I could see the shine when the light fell directly on it.  Yet there wasn’t a single ripple.  Its surface was like glass.

“Only a few inches,” Patricia repeated.

However, when the student finally worked up the courage to stand on it, he fell in instead.  His whole body was submerged in water.  It felt thick, like oil, and he struggled to find the edge to pull himself out.  He certainly couldn’t find a bottom.

He gave up trying just before he drowned.  He remembered thinking that this was it, that he was going to die here, and his struggles grew still.  He let his arms float up around him in the black water and that was when his fingers brushed the sides.

“After he got free, nothing unnatural on this campus bothered him again,” Patricia said.  “When the traveling river came, it swept around him and he remained on an island of dry land.  The things in the rain went right past him.  It was like he didn’t exist to them.”

So that was the plan.  The student would go into the water and when he came out, hopefully the scratching would no longer be able to find him.

“Okay,” the young man said.  “I just have to find my way out.”

“It might be harder than it sounds,” I ventured.

One of the Rain Chasers glanced my way, but didn’t disagree.  In fact, they even backed me up.  It *was* dangerous, they said.  None of them had tried it yet, because there was no guarantee that what happened to the graduated student would happen for them.  They might just drown in there.  The scratching student didn’t seem to be listening, though.  His eyes were fixed on the black slab in the floor.

I wanted to ask Patricia more questions.  Why she thought this would work.  Why this and not something else.  Anything to stall the inevitable, because even though it wasn’t even my decision, I was still scared and wanted an excuse to tell the student not to do it.  That I was wrong to bring him here and he didn’t need to take such a risk.

But without any more hesitation or debate, he walked over and stepped onto it.

He vanished from sight.  Like the floor swallowed him up, as seamlessly as if he’d stepped off a cliff.  There wasn’t even a ripple from where he’d been a moment ago.  Breathlessly, we crowded around the slab.  I dropped to my knees and stared at its pristine surface.  I didn’t even see my own reflection, I realized.

We waited.  I held my breath, trying to guess how much longer he had before he wouldn’t be able to make it out.

A hand shot out of the water.   One of the Rain Chasers shrieked in surprise at how abrupt its appearance was.  It was close to the middle of the slab, flailing to find the edge.  The water ran down his skin like rainbows, shining in the light of the electric lantern.

He just needed to find the edge, I realized.  Then he could pull himself out.  He could live.  I reached out to him without even thinking about it, until my fingers brushed his.

And he grabbed hold of my hand.

Clutched at it, and I found myself being pulled forward by the weight of his struggles to free himself of the water.

“What are you doing!?” Patricia yelled.

One of the Rain Chasers was behind me, grabbing me underneath my armpits so I wouldn’t fall in.  Another person was there, also grabbing hold, bracing me against the student’s weight.

We began to pull him towards the edge.  I could see his wrist.  More, I thought desperately.  We had to get more of him out of the water.

He felt so heavy.  Like dragging a stone through the water.

Almost there.  We were so close.

He was at the edge.  His fingers clamped on the edge of the stone floor.  I shifted my grip to his wrist and we all pulled, me holding him directly and the nearby Rain Chasers holding my waist and my shoulders to brace me.  The ones that couldn’t help directly cheered us on.  So close.  *So close*.  Everyone was almost jubilant, seeing triumph within reach.  Patricia paced nervously opposite us, chewing on a fingernail.

We pulled.  And pulled.

And continued to pull, long past the point his hand stopped moving, until Patricia finally told us to stop.  To let go.  And they did.  Still, I remained at the side of the slab, my hands around the wrist that had become nothing but dead weight, on my knees, barely able to see through my tears.

“Let go,” Patricia said, prying my fingers left.  “He’s dead.  Just let go.”

The water swallowed him up without a ripple.  His fingers slid out of sight and that was it.

He was gone.

We parted ways in the steam tunnels.  I went to my dorm and the rest of the Rain Chasers went to theirs.  A few hours after I got back to my dorm, I received an invitation to a private discord channel.

‘No one say anything about this,’ the latest message from Patricia read.  ‘Let’s make sure everyone forgets about him before we talk about it.’

Like what happened to sweater girl before I rescued her.  Except this time, there would be no rescue.  I threw my phone into the corner of my desk and climbed into my bed.  Cassie asked what was wrong and I mumbled that it was about Steven, and she left it alone after that.

I realize what I did wrong.  This was his trial.  I couldn’t help him, but I did, and that is why he died.

It’s my fault.

I don’t think I can do this anymore.  This - all of this - was a mistake.  I’m not as brave as you all think I am.  I’m not as strong as I need to be.  I can’t just see someone die and go on like nothing happened.  I woke up this morning worrying about my grades again.  *My grades.*

Like it matters.  I’m not going to be able to keep this up for four years.  I’m going to lose my scholarship at some point.

I called my mom an hour ago.  I told her to come get me.

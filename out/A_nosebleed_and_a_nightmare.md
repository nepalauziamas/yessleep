About a month ago, I had a nosebleed while I slept, and an odd nightmare. Well, at least, I think it was a nightmare. I’ve been dying to tell people about this for a while, since it really disturbed me, and everyone I’ve told about it insists that it didn’t really happen…but it felt so real in the moment.

I took a shower late one night when my parents were away (early in the morning, really — we're talking 1/2am), taking advantage of the fact that nobody was around to tell me off for taking a shower so late. I tried to turn the light on in the bathroom, but couldn't, because it wasn't working. That normally never happens - in fact, ever since, it hasn’t happened once - but I didn’t feel like trying to change the bulb so late at night, so I eventually decided to just shower in the dark, since the water was still working fine. I started to take my shower, until I noticed that the blinds over the window in the door weren't completely drawn, and it looked like there was a shadow in the hallway, watching me. This caught me by surprise, since I thought I was the only person home that night, so I turned off the shower and opened the door into the hallway to check if there was anyone there. I didn’t see anyone, so I dismissed my feeling of being watched as a simple bout of paranoia, but I still shut the blind properly, thinking the problem solved.

I finished my shower and all seemed well, until I turned to look at the other bathroom window, the one in the wall, and saw two more eyes there — except the blind was shut, so by all means they shouldn’t have been able to see anything. These eyes inexplicably looked like they were a part of the blind, but were clearly not, blinking every now and then. The eyes looked more or less human, but there was no gap between them for a nose bridge, and one was much larger than the other - and I couldn’t see the face they belonged in. Their irises and pupils were pure black with no differentiation, and their sclera pure white. The eyes seemingly had no eyelashes, but instead were lined with dark viscous liquid, like eyeliner — except, it wasn't eyeliner at all. Shocked, I started to approach the window, and the eyes seemingly disappeared. I felt tempted to just leave the room and pretend I hadn’t seen anything, but instead I steeled myself and pulled up the blind, only to see that there was a face outside the window staring directly at me.

The face was that of a young girl, with very pale skin and a choppy black bob. The girl, or creature — whatever it was — had those same strange eyes, and seemed to be clinging to the window ledge with a pair of hands that possessed eerily long thin fingers with claw-like dirty nails. We stared at each other for a moment, and then, when I found the courage to blink, the face disappeared again. I was afraid, but knew that logically the...person? could be injured if she had fallen off the window ledge she seemed to have been clinging to, so I threw open the window to look for her. I looked around, and even up, but didn't see anything, so I finally looked down, preparing for the worst. But what I saw there was so much worse than the mangled corpse of a girl-*thing.* The creature clung to the wall of the house with its long claws, still staring directly at me. And then, it opened its mouth, which was unnaturally cavernous and completely devoid of teeth, and began to sing.

I can’t for the life of me remember the melody or the lyrics, but I do remember that it was really creepy, almost nursery rhyme-like, and that I'd never heard anything like it before. It had a raspy voice, a little like an elderly person, but distinctly *wrong* somehow, and kind of sounded like it had a cold. It tilted its head as if to approach, and I quickly closed the window and the blind and ran out of the bathroom. I went to bed immediately, hoping that the creature would go away on its own. But as I lay in my bed trying to sleep, eyes screwed tightly shut, I felt a horrible sense of dread come over me, like I was being watched. But I refused to open my eyes.

The next morning, there was blood on my pillow. A nosebleed, I guess. I haven’t seen the creature since.

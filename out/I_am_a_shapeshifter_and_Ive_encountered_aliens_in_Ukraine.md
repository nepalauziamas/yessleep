  

For starters, what I am about to share here isn't some sort of alternative lifestyle or a fetish. I am practicing something our ancestors have been part in for many centuries prior to the arrival of Christianity. I am not a furry or an Otherkin, I'm not even a Therian. I am Koryos. A man who is one with the beast inside, a young bull elephant in perpetual musth. Without the sexual cravings, I might add. 

I live on the edge of society, as I am neither man, nor truly a beast. I do feel a connection with the primal world and I honestly prefer to spend my life being one with nature; in the real jungle (or rather forest) rather than the concrete jungle of the modern human world. 

Every now and again, I shed my human form, that being societal norms, and run off to spend a month in the wilderness. Naked and without any human contact, equipped only with my instincts and a bear's pelt. 

In order to fully shed my humanity, I also drink a concoction the contents of which I won't reveal here. This concoction helps me lose all my shame and clouds my logical brain. It allows the bear inside to take over. 

I know all of this might come off as weird or even insane, but consider all other acts of spirituality you might've come across. Mutilations, ritual drowning, ritual cannibalism, reminiscing about long forgotten slavery and so on. All of the above are part of the normal religious stuff. Reuniting with your true internal self, however, nah, that has to be conforming and without any real external expression. People think I'm a freak for worshiping a one-eyed shape shifting god that governs over nature. The same people worship an invisible deity, a corpse or their own money. 

Anyway, I'm digressing. Last time I went on my humanitarian hibernation. I was traveling in the Ukraine. The urge to unite with nature is uncontrollable and comes on its own, when the beast calls, it cannot be denied. The roars of the animal are audible at the back of my mind, I must heed their commands and become the bear that dwells inside.

So, I made all the necessary preparations to awaken the beast and allow my humanity to slip into hibernation and left the false safety of Lviv to roam the forests of western Ukraine. I think I've had an alien encounter somewhere there. At some point, to be quite honest, I can never exactly remember the details of my animalistic journey. 

That said, I remember just chewing on berries when a bright flash, an explosion of heavenly flame straight from the fields of Valhalla burst straight through the clouds not too far away, blinding my sensitive eyes. Curiosity took over my four legs forcing me to find the source of the strange light. To my surprise, a poacher stood, gun pointed towards a smoking cloud that smelled way too foul for my nostrils. 

The poacher's presence angered me and I started snarling at him. He noticed me and started screaming words that seemed to blend into each other as he struggled to keep his eyes gun pointed at the smokescreen. I was getting angrier at the poacher as he seemed to grow more and more volatile. I was ready to pounce at him but a loud crack tore through the air and my eardrums. 

The smokescreen faded and a large, strange and creature, the likes of which I've never seen before stood in its place. Pins and needles ran across my skin and the whole situation seemed to be growing tense and not my favor. 

The strange creature looked like a dark blueish Tyrannosaurus with a deformed conical elongated head. There was a vertical organ at the base of its head with two dangling bushy structures on each side and a gigantic multi-pupiled eye. 

Another thunderous crack echoed through the air and in response the strange creature shot something out of the spiked organs hanging between its four long and dangling arms. The poacher screamed in agony as I watched his body inflating like a balloon before exploding into a mass of flesh and gore. 

The creature then let out a terrifying high-pitched screech that sounded like something between a turkey and an owl but twisting and guttural. The sound scared me so much I ran up a tree. Looking back, I saw the creature standing right beneath me, its eye rolling in its lens like organ before it let out its painfully long tongue which touched me sending shivers down my spine. 

A bright flash of burning hot light descended once again from the sky. It's luminosity nearly caused me to fall from the tree but I managed to hang on. When the light faded out, I was left alone with a pile of human matter and the chard remains of another. 

Falling down with the tree nearly gave me a heart attack, luckily, my lord has ensured my safety and I was left relatively unharmed.

One bright and early morning I had awaken from a full nights sleep. I got up instantly after hearing my annoying alarm go off and went straight to the bathroom which was nothing short of a regular routine for me. Something did feel kind of odd because I am so used to my wife sound asleep beside me as I wake up at 6:30 A.M.

I hopped in the shower and began brushing my teeth, because that’s what I do in the shower. I finished up washing and rinsing and got out. As I was drying off it seemed as I heard my wife giggling. I have a closet in my bathroom and it sounded like the giggling was coming from there. I opened the door and there she stood, 5’4, dark hair in front of her eyes and all you can see is a grin so big she was drooling. I asked “baby, what’s wrong? Are you okay?”. She just stood there, grinning at me. I grabbed her shoulders and brought her in for a hug and she says “I love you” and walks back to our room, gets in the bed and goes to sleep in a matter of seconds.

I continued my day as normal, drove to work and listened to my horror podcasts as I would any other day. After I was done for the day at work, I began driving home and called my wife. She answered immediately like she had been waiting for me to call her ALL day. She said “ Hi baby” and it sounded like she was so excited and had the biggest smile on her face but in a weird way, ya know? I replied “hey baby! I love you!!“ and then I said “do you remember this morning”? she replied “no, what are you talking about???”. I felt like I was crazy, especially after experiencing something so creepy at such an early time in the morning. 

Once I got home I went straight to my room to greet my beautiful wife who I was so excited to see. As I walked down our long, dark hallway I noticed our bedroom light was off and the curtains were closed. It was dark as midnight in our room at 6 p.m in the afternoon. I said “baby, are you in here??” as I heard nothing I decided to turn the light on but to no surprise it did not work. I heard the same giggle that I heard this morning, only it seemed to be coming from behind me.. I turned around and there she was, standing at the end of the hallway with a huge grin on her face with sheer excitement like she had just won the lottery. I asked if she was okay and she just stood there, staring at me through the thin strains of her hair. I turned the hallway light on and walked to her and asked if she was okay, her shirt was soaked with drool like she had been salivating like a hungry lion that was about to eat for the first time in 24 hours. I hugged her, again, and she hugged me back like nothing had happened. 

We continued our days as normal. I was mowing our yard that same afternoon and stopped for a water break. I was standing in the yard basking in the sunlight when something caught my eye. I looked at my bedroom window and all I could see was her tiny head peaking through the curtains, staring at me with drool all over our window. 

When I went back in the house she was making dinner while she was singing her favorite song and it was beautiful to see the house so lit up and for her to have such a cheerful vibe. 

Once we finished dinner we ended up watching our favorite Netflix series and falling asleep in each others arms. I awoke at 3 a.m to my wife standing at the end of our bed laughing aggressively while spit flew with each breathe she took in. I was so terrified I felt like I was paralyzed. As I lay there, waking up to such a disturbing thing, she stopped laughing and just stared at me. This went on for maybe 3 or 4 minutes. She walked to our back door and began walking towards the woods behind our house. I yelled for her and cried all night, it was 3 a.m and my wife was walking straight into the woods with no light or sense of direction.

I waited for her to come back. I waited for 3 weeks and I have not heard from her nor has her family. I think about her all the time. Sometimes I feel like I see her in the woods staring at me from a distance. I plan on moving in with my grandparents soon maybe for a fresh start. Maybe one day I will find answers..

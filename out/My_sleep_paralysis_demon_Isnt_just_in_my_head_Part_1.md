Hi, My names Jean. I was born in Vietnam but moved to America with my family when I was five years old so we could live a better life.

I always heard eerie stories about our town. It’s a pretty small town so word gets around quite fast. Usually It’s just all the usual things that kids like to spread, Stuff like ghosts, demons, and devils.

Younger me was never superstitious, I never believed in bad luck or ghosts and spirits. But I also never believed in a god, which was uncomfortable for my family and me as they are all catholic. Thinking back I should have been one too.

Ever since moving to America, I would suffer from sleep paralysis. Doctors couldn’t give me a definite answer why, my doctors don’t believe in sleep paralysis demons, but that was the one thing that I was certain on.

Night after night that tall, dark, creature would stand in the corner of my room, praying and feeding off my fear. It had long dirty finger nails like an eagle, and a big evil grin that was luminous in a completely dark room. It’s eyes were wide and alert, Its full body looked like it had been skinned.

I felt trapped and alone, I couldn’t scream or move, and I felt tired even trying to. Every night it feels like this thing is getting closer and closer to me.

at college, I would catch glimpses of it in the corner of my eye. It got to the point were I started to feel like I was going mental.  I was put on medication for hallucinations, and things only got worse.

I would have dreams of it chasing me, catching me, and peeling off my skin piece by piece. These nightmares would get more and more horrific every time.

One night, I woke up to the sound of a baby crying, I’m a fan of scary movies and know that the number one rule is to never go and investigate something unusual, but my curiosity got the better of me. I carefully walked down the stairs making sure every step was quiet, I turned round the corner and walked up to my kitchen door. I was contemplating where or not I should go in, I creaked open the door and was frozen in shock.

I saw a sight that will forever haunt me in my dreams, There was a small baby laying on the floor in a pool of blood, a strong stench filled the room, the baby still had it’s umbilical cord attached to it’s stomach. I let out a piercing screech, I had no idea who the baby was or who it belonged to. My mum came rushing down to the kitchen, “What’s the matter, why are you screaming at this time of night.” My mum blurted, “Mum, Who’s baby is that!”. “Don’t tell me you forgot to take your medicine again, Jean.” She uttered. 

A silence filled the room, The baby had vanished when I took a look at the floor. I broke down in tears, I knew there and then that I needed help, I needed to rid myself from this evil that had taken over my life.

So, I decided to go to a church - Being an atheist and walking in a church meant that I would get judgemental stares from the devoted catholics. Candles and crosses were scattered across the hall, and delicately painted pictures were hanging on the walls. I wish I could say that it was beautiful and pure, but I knew that the longer I was here, the more that the evil presence within me would ruin the beauty.

I was used to ruining things perfect and neat ever since I was a child, but nothing as extreme as this. I slowly walked up to the presiders chair, the priest wasn’t there so I decided to say a little prayer in my own way. 

“If a god is listening to me right now, I’m sorry. I’m sorry that I didn’t believe in the good and the bad, maybe if I did I wouldn’t be in the situation I’m in now. Whatever evil is with me right now - I know It’s going to find my weakness, and kill me.”

I’ve never been the best at apologies, but it wasn’t just an apology, it was a confession. I didn’t know how long left I had to live, all I knew was it wasn’t long.

After a moment of me sitting in silence, a priest came up to me, “Jean, goodness it’s been years since I’ve seen you in here.” He stated. “Yeah, I lost my faith for a while, I’m a believer now.”  “I’m here because I need your help, something unholy is coming for me.” I said strongly.

An uneasy atmosphere filled the room. “I’m sorry, I can’t help you.” He whispered. “How can you not help me, You’re a priest!” I screamed, “Please leave, Now.” I was shocked, I stormed out the church.

If a priest can’t help me, who will. As soon as I left the church I was frozen. I couldn’t move, shout or scream. Suddenly, the sky went dark grey, black smoke sunk into the air. Just then, I saw it. Its long finger nails, its hideous grin. It knew I was afraid. It could sense it - it feeds off it.

Eventually, I could move again. But I was still there, trapped in that dreadful place - with that thing. My heart was racing, I ran as fast as I could, not missing a step or slowing down. But no matter how fast I ran, it was always one step behind me. It took its disgusting fingernail and slit my arm open, I fell to the ground in agony. I looked at my arm and saw blood streaming out of it.

I squeezed my eyes and prayed everything would just stop, or at least even slow down. A moment later, I opened my eyes to see a crowd of people standing in front of me, worried. I checked my arm and it was still bleeding, I knew I wasn’t hallucinating. I quickly got up and pushed through the people. I booked an Uber to take me to the nearest hospital to stitch up my arm, I knew if I told anyone what really happened they wouldn’t believe me.

I arrived at the hospital and made an appointment, I sat in the waiting room for a few hours at least before getting called in by Dr. O’Neil. I walked in the room cautiously before sitting down on the hospital bed. “Are you okay Miss?” He said, “Yeah I’m alright, just a rough days.” The room suddenly went cold. “Was it that creature again?” My heart dropped. “How did you know about that.” I said watchfully.

The room starting violently shaking. I turned to look at the doctor and his face was completely distorted, the only thing that was noticeable was his horrific, evil smile.

I let out an agonising shrill. I picked up a lamp and bashed it across his skull, I had no other choice. He stayed perfectly still - his smile still sitting on his face.

“Get the hell away from me!” I yelled.

I bolted through the door and ran into the waiting room. All the doctors, patients and nurses had that same grin on their face, staring right at me like an eagle hunting its prey. I was a game, and they loved watching me squirm.

I felt terrified and helpless. Every single emotion I had ever felt in my whole life was suddenly kicking in. I was too mentally exhausted to even cry or let out a sound.

All at once, all the people that were staring at me gouged out their eyes. Still keeping that smile on their faces, I was horrified watching the blood gush out of their eye sockets and spilling onto the floor.

I went to the nearest wall and started smashing my head full force against it, trying to knock myself back to reality. I eventually smashed it so hard that I blacked out. I woke up again to doctors and nurses surrounding me, with a pounding in my head.

I put my hand on my head where it hurt the most, I felt blood dripping down my hair.

“It worked.” I said relieved.

Before passing out again. I woke up on a hospital bed with flowers next to me and some fast recovery cards. I knew I hot my hard but didn’t realise just how hard I actually banged it.

I realised instantly, that wherever I was - or wherever I went, I was being preyed upon and I was being taunted.

Usually when I tell people that I once got abducted and turned into a doll, nobody believes me. It's easy to write off as a nightmare, especially since I only remember bits and pieces of it. Yet whenever I replay the experience in my head, there is this profound sense of realism to it that you simply cannot convey by word. That's how I know it truly happened, but also that maybe no one else ever will. 

While I don't know anything about the abduction and transformation itself, I vividly recall what it felt like to be a doll. It was like my skin had turned into a cage; I couldn't move, I couldn't speak, hell, I couldn't even blink. There was the growing need to breathe that, try as I might, I could not meet. My nose wouldn't let any air in and my mouth was sealed shut. I felt my chest grow tighter and tighter, my lack of oxygen bringing me closer to unconsciousness with every second that passed, but I never passed out. I never actually suffocated. I waited for death, but it simply wouldn't come; instead, the pain merely became worse. It didn't reach one level and stay there, it only grew and grew, giving me no time to even adjust in the slightest. I wanted to cry, scream my lungs out, but I couldn't. 

My eyes, though wide open, were practically blind. If there was anything but utter darkness around me at the time, I couldn't see it; just as no sound ever reached my ears. The air smelled of absolutely nothing, I couldn't tell whether it was hot or cold where I was at and there wasn't even a hint of any kind of taste in my mouth. I was deprived of all my senses. I only realized that upon *somehow* managing to take my mind off the agony that was my breathlessness. Meanwhile, my eyes had been drying out, and since I could neither shut my lids nor produce so much as a single tear, there was no way of relieving them of the burning sensation gnawing away at my corneas. The odd position my body was locked in sent throbbing aches through my back, exhausting and wearing me down even though I wasn't moving at all. 

I don't know for how long I remained like this. It was less than a day for certain, but perhaps not by much. It felt like an eternity though. My mind was racing with never subsiding panic, the fear and anguish nearly driving me mad and leaving only a tiny part of my brain calm and reasonable enough to think about what was going on. I wondered where I was, if any of this was really happening or if it was all merely the most godawful nightmare anyone had ever had, if I'd died in my sleep and this was hell; and, if so, what in the world I had done to deserve it. 

I was asking myself that very thing for about the hundredth time when all of a sudden, my rigor was lifted and I collapsed. I gasped for air, sucking in so much that I almost started choking, the feeling of my chest widening close to heavenly. Every joint in my body seemed to have caught on fire, but the sensation was a good one, and once it ebbed off a little it left behind a wonderful tingle. My eyes were met with light, dim and soft and warm, and when I felt somebody touch my arm and I looked up, my darkness-plagued mind readily welcomed their image before me. 

The creature I saw was no person. It looked like one, yes, but it was too radiating to be normal. It had an unnatural iridescence, making it appear intimidating and soothing at the same time. A man's features in the face, but its body too flat and soft and delicate to look human in the slightest. To this day, I don't have the words to describe it. It had hair, long and golden and as thin and fine as cobwebs. Its clothes were stranger yet, giving the impression of a costume with how oddly they were cut and how much they sparkled. They were largely silver and blue, but there were also some other colors in there, colors I'd never seen before and most likely will never know the name of. Calling it "him" or "her" wouldn't do it justice, it'd humanize it too much. Maybe I was still under the influence of my near-death experience at the time, but at first, I actually thought I was seeing some kind of angel.

*Its voice sounded like the echo of a breeze.*

"You didn't deserve this, you didn't deserve this… I'm so sorry. Please forgive me. Can I touch you? Can I pick you up?" 

It took all my strength to nod, and once I hung my head, it stayed down, despite my efforts to crane my neck and keep looking at the creature. When it bent down to wrap its arms around me, I forgot all about that though. Its touch was the warmest, most soothing sensation I had ever known. It didn't make me feel heated, but it somehow managed to convey care and tenderness without the familiarity normally needed to do so. It was light and cool at the same time, and though its grip on me was technically restraining, it rather gave me the idea that I was floating. When it lifted me up from the ground I was lying on, I felt like a child in the arms of its mother. 

"What have I done to you?" it whispered to itself as it began to carry me off. We passed so many dolls on the way. I can't remember if they were just sitting everywhere or if they were displayed in showcases; I don't even know anymore what kind of place we were in. We were in a building at one point, then we were outside but it was too dark to see, and then we were inside my bedroom. It placed my limp body on the mattress, tugging the blanket away so it could wrap it around my shaking form. My vision blurred by the tears that had started running freely the second I'd been released, I stared at it. I couldn't say a word, but it seemed to sense that I wanted to hear its voice again. 

"That wasn't supposed to happen," it told me, sitting down on the side of my bed. It didn't creak or even lower under its weight, the sheets didn't wrinkle where it pressed into them. Like it was made out of air. "I made a huge mistake. You were never meant to be taken; I don't know how I could mess up this bad… I've been losing my edge as of late, but I never thought I'd be capable of a slip-up this massive." It paused. "How are you feeling? Has the pain let up yet?"

My throat being as dry as it was, I obviously couldn't answer, but I lifted my chin up. The closest I could get to nodding.

"Good, very good… I'll be frank, you'll likely stay this exhausted for another while. I've never turned anyone back before so of course I don't know for sure."

I gave a weak sound of wonder, hoping it'd understand it as the question I was meaning to ask.

It lifted a brow, then opened its mouth a little. "Oh." A meaningful pause. It lowered its head in thought. "I suppose after what I've done, you have the right to know, not that it really matters. I'm sure you remember the gallery I took you through. Where all the pretty dolls were."

I forced another nod, my head rolling to the side to better regard it.

"I made those, all of them. I turned them, like I did with you."

My heartbeat quickened at the realization. All those porcelain bodies we'd passed, all those picture perfect faces were prisons to people. Actual, living people, stuck in a state of perpetually worsening agony, perhaps for the rest of eternity — bearing levels of pain no one else might ever experience. The horror of this admission was not lost on me. I might have panicked in any other situation, and if the Dollmaker hadn't looked down at me with those eyes of alien colors, its mere presence having me feeling drunk, I certainly would have. Instead, I remained oddly calm, taking in this information like it was the most natural thing in the world. 

"Why?" I breathed, surprised at this hint of control returning to me. 

"Because they deserve it, believe it or not. I only turn a certain kind of people. Basically those who have done something bad in the past, something really, really bad, and got away unpunished." 

I hummed and turned my head to the side a little further, hoping to press my cheek against the creature's leg, but it didn't work. It didn't even seem to notice.

"With you, I don't know what happened. There was this woman about your age, and I guess you two look *kind of* similar, but that's no excuse of course… Anyways, it was her I was meant to come and get, not you. I thought you were her. Just after I transformed you though, I took another look at her in my files, and I realized I'd messed up. She doesn't even live anywhere near you, I have no idea how I could have been so… *so*…" It fumbled for words, its eyes genuinely regretful. "Again, I am so incredibly sorry." 

I wanted to tell it that I wasn't angry, that I forgave it; that I would forgive anything it could possibly do to me. I remained too dazed to put any of that into words though.

"I hope you'll think this was a dream when you wake up," it said. "It would be a huge relief." 

*But I want to remember.*

"Don't leave," I muttered. 

It gave me a puzzled frown. "I can't really stay, can I?"

"Stay…"

*You're the most beautiful thing I've ever seen; the only beautiful thing.*

"Silly," it merely said in that soft voice, prodding my shoulder before getting up. "Goodbye." It walked right out the door, just like a normal person. I was left lying there, stunned, feeling lonelier than ever now that this angel was gone. I was safe, yes, but I didn't want this safety anymore. I wanted the hurt, the agony; whatever the price for seeing and talking to this creature again, I was willing, no, *eager* to pay. 

I haven't been myself from that day on. *Or maybe I am, but I got confused along the way.* Maybe my self changed. 

I live in a spartanically furnished apartment. All I do is eat and sleep and work. I have a job, but I don't feel any passion for it. It's not paid very well, but I don't need any money. I'm okay just scraping by and there's nothing material I might want anyways. I read a lot, and sometimes, only rarely, I go out to meet new people. No one's ever gotten away from me before, there's no one to tell the tale. I've been very cautious about everything and I pick them with care — try to choose folk that won't be missed, that are easier for me to hurt because they're horrible themselves. I don't want to escape judgment, I *crave* judgment, just not by the law. I'm selfish, I know I am, I am so utterly selfish and cruel and the guilt is killing me, but my thoughts are consumed by the porcelain angel. I need to see it again, I need it near me. I don't want to do this anymore, though. I can't wait for it to find me, to come for me. Don't worry about me being punished. I'll face the consequences of my actions, and I'll spend eternity in torment, but it'll be worth it. 

So if you're the one who makes the dolls, I hope this reaches you. Look at what you've done to me. It's not your fault I went down this road, it's really not, but I wish you'd never left me. I wish you'd stayed when I was begging you not to go. I don't know if you're still doing what you do, if you've moved on from earth entirely or if you simply haven't gotten around to picking me up yet. After all, I bet there's a lot of bad people in this world who get away with the evil things they do. Maybe some of them do it for the same reason as me. Either way, yours is a busy life. But this has been going on for too long. 

*Find me. Stop me. Change me and keep me. Save me. Please.*

 

We were 13 and my friends and I were hanging out on Halloween night.

We wanted to join our friends, who lived in a nearby village, in a park that was between mine and their city. It was a bit distant, but we decided to go anyway.

There was only one problem: we thought that, as usual, at 6 in the afternoon, there was still light. But with the time change, it was already dark at 6, but at the beginning we didn’t care a lot.

We began to be afraid when we took the road to the bike path, which would lead us back to our friends. By day this was a magical place, green and cheerful but at night happiness had prevailed by a darkness causing fear, fear of not being alone inside this dark place. At the same time the branches of trees moved by the wind made a sound similar to a whisper, which makes you turn around in fear of being chased by someone.

We were teenagers, but we had the mind of a child. We were making a mess screaming and throwing firecrackers, but we hadn’t thought about the consequences of our actions.

On our way to the park I looked behind me, because I was scared. It was in fact the first time that I hung out this late. At first I had seen a light, a white light flying in the darkness like a firefly. But then it duplicated, the lights became two and then three. Then I heard someone screaming in a language I didn't know, maybe arab. The tone the person had screamed wasn’t kind, actually it sounded like a menace or something worse. I told my friends about this and once they turned too they started running on a path that was over the road, thinking that our pursuers, with their bicycles, would not reach us. Since then we hadn’t seen them for a few minutes and we thought that they gave up on us. When we arrived at the park we met our friends and we told them about what had happened. They told us that they had seen some people riding bicycles, looking for someone. 

But the conversation was interrupted by another scream. We hid behind a slide and from a hole, I could see who was our pursuer. He was arab, as I thought, 6,3 feet tall circa, and his face was burnt. 

In his eyes I could see the anger, caused by something I didn’t know I had done. He was looking for us riding a brand new bike and joking I said silently: “Bro I guess his bike’s stolen”.

I will regret what I had said, because he saw me and began chasing us but his voice seemed friendly and began telling us to stop and that he hadn’t the intention to scare us in a perfect italian ( I’m italian ). 

Suddenly we stopped and we talked with him about the situation. 

He told us that we had to get out of here because by throwing firecrackers we scared a homeless man, who because of this had called the police. 

After that he became our friend and we came back to the city where there was a party. We had a good time but our new friend looked suspicious because I caught him looking away and making hand gestures all the time to someone I couldn't see, however I decided to forget this story and have fun tonight.

On my way home everything was silent, I could even walk in the middle of the road, I could hear the noise made by the streetlights but I felt like something was wrong. 

How could such a complex story have ended like this? The police had arrived? Or maybe they just wanted to make fun of us? I don’t know if I’ll ever find an answer to these questions but I accepted the fact that maybe this whole thing was just a coincidence but certainly this was the scariest night of my life. Maybe it’s true that all the most terrifying things happen to Hallowen.

SORRY FOR MY BAD ENGLISH BUT I HOPE YOU LIKED MY STORY :)

The cool dirt invaded the holes in my crocs, crumbling around my feet as they moved. Summer sun rays peaked through the trees, and my body grew tired as we went uphill a bit. My dogs frolicked ahead of me, and I felt jealous of their energy. Man, I really needed to work out.

For a while now, my girlfriend and I had been debating converting a shed into a tiny home for us and our animals. We wanted it to be our own little slice of heaven. Her parents were nice enough to give us some of their land. It was a little over 2 acres of land next to their house, but it was covered in incredibly thick woods. Luckily, one of her uncles offered to clear off an acre of the land for us to get the process started. He spent three days doing just that, and, each day, we excitedly scampered down there to see what progress he’d made.

That’s exactly what we were doing last week. We made our trek down the little path her uncle had created that connected their yard to our future yard. The summer sun beat down on us as we walked, and our four dogs frolicked happily beside us. We began eagerly discussing exactly where we wanted to place everything. The placement of the house would determine where we would later put our garden and pool that we planned to have one day.

“It’s so damn hot out here,” spoke up my partner. She had been complaining about the heat since we left the air conditioning’s comforting arms, but, to be fair, the girl’s normal body temperature could give heater’s a run for their money. “Do you want to head back to the house?”

“Nah,” I replied, feeling pretty cool under the shady trees. “I think I’m just gonna hang out here for a little bit. Get some alone time.” Did I mention we had been living with our in-laws for the last month? Yeah, alone time was \*very\* much needed.

We said our goodbyes before she headed off back the way we came, the dogs trailing after her. I began playing on my phone, watching TikToks, and scrolling through Instagram. My service didn’t last long, though. Soon I was turning my airplane mode on and off, a trick a friend taught me to get better service. When that still didn’t work, I began debating going back to the house.

I began reading the remnants of the only Instagram post, an AITA Reddit post (Don’t judge me, I prefer reading them on Instagram for some reason.), I had been able to get to load. I jerked my head up when I heard something shuffling around in the dense trees ahead of me. My first thought was that it was probably the dogs, even though I couldn’t see them anywhere. I shrugged it off, still convinced it was them, before turning my eyes back to my phone.

I had just finished reading the post when the breathing began, heavy and loud. It was coming from the same spot I had heard the movement, but I still couldn’t see anything. I scanned the treeline of the clearing slowly, looking for any sign of our dogs, but I saw nothing. I appeared to be alone, but the breathing tried to convince me otherwise. Fearful thoughts mixed with possible rational explanations, and my heart began to beat faster. I couldn’t help but notice how human the breathing sounded, even though my brain steadily tried to convince me it was just our dogs. It continued even as I dialed my girlfriend’s phone number.

“Hey, are you back at the house?” I asked while standing up from my perch on the ground.

“Yeah,” she said. “What’s wrong?”

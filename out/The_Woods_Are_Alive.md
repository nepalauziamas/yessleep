The cool dirt invaded the holes in my crocs, crumbling around my feet as they moved. Summer sun rays peaked through the trees, and my body grew tired as we went uphill a bit. My dogs frolicked ahead of me, and I felt jealous of their energy. Man, I really needed to work out.

For a while now, my girlfriend and I had been debating converting a shed into a tiny home for us and our animals. We wanted it to be our own little slice of heaven. Her parents were nice enough to give us some of their land. It was a little over 2 acres of land next to their house, but it was covered in incredibly thick woods. Luckily, one of her uncles offered to clear off an acre of the land for us to get the process started. He’s been doing just that for the last three days, and, each day, we’ve excitedly scampered down there to see what progress he’s made.

That’s exactly what we were doing last week. We made our trek down the little path her uncle had created that connected their yard to our future yard. The summer sun beat down on us as we walked, and our four dogs frolicked happily beside us. We began eagerly discussing exactly where we wanted to place everything. The placement of the house would determine where we would later put our garden and pool that we planned to have one day.

“It’s so damn hot out here,” spoke up my partner. She had been complaining about the heat since we left the air conditioning’s comforting arms, but, to be fair, the girl’s normal body temperature could give heater’s a run for their money. “Do you want to head back to the house?”

“Nah,” I replied, feeling pretty cool under the shady trees. “I think I’m just gonna hang out here for a little bit. Get some alone time.” Did I mention we had been living with our in-laws for the last month? Yeah, alone time was \*very\* much needed.

We said our goodbyes before she headed off back the way we came, the dogs trailing after her. I began playing on my phone, watching TikToks, and scrolling through Instagram. My service didn’t last long, though. Soon I was turning my airplane mode on and off, a trick a friend taught me to get better service. When that still didn’t work, I began debating going back to the house.

I began reading the remnants of the only Instagram post, an AITA Reddit post (Don’t judge me, I prefer reading them on Instagram for some reason.), I had been able to get to load. I jerked my head up when I heard something shuffling around in the dense trees ahead of me. My first thought was that it was probably the dogs, even though I couldn’t see them anywhere. I shrugged it off, still convinced it was them, before turning my eyes back to my phone.

I had just finished reading the post when the breathing began, heavy and loud. It was coming from the same spot I had heard the movement, but I still couldn’t see anything. I scanned the treeline of the clearing slowly, looking for any sign of our dogs, but I saw nothing. I appeared to be alone, but the breathing tried to convince me otherwise. Fearful thoughts mixed with possible rational explanations, and my heart began to beat faster. I couldn’t help but notice how human the breathing sounded, even though my brain steadily tried to convince me it was just our dogs. It continued even as I dialed my girlfriend’s phone number.

“Hey, are you back at the house?” I asked while standing up from my perch on the ground.

“Yeah,” she said. “What’s wrong?”

I looked around the clearing as I headed towards the path to the house. “Are the dogs back at the house with you?”

“I’m in the bathroom right now, so I don’t know. Tell me what’s going on.” I could hear the worry in her voice, and it only made mine heighten.

I kept looking back as I walked, afraid something was going to burst out of the woods and chase after me. I sped up my pace as I talked. “I started hearing this weird breathing. Just please stay on the phone with me.”

“What breathing?”

“Human,” I said mid-glance, and, as I wheeled back around, I could have sworn I saw something shift to my right.

My heart felt like it was going to beat out of my chest. I upped my pace, but not too much. I was honestly afraid that if I tried to run that my Crocs would make me trip and fall on the rough terrain produced by her uncle’s excavator.

“Did you see anyone out there with you?”

I opened my mouth to say no, but something slapped me so hard in the face that the device was flung out of my hand. I hissed at the pain in my hand and face, not yet processing what had happened. If you grew up anywhere in the south, you know what a switch is, and you knew that, if you misbehaved, adults were gonna whoop your ass with it. The hit I felt reminded me of my punishments growing up, yet the branchy slap felt vicious this time. A bright red welt was already appearing on my hand as it stung.

I could hear my girlfriend’s voice calling through the phone that had landed somewhere in the dense trees to my left. I had no idea where it had landed for sure, though, and I was too afraid to go in and fish it out. I squinted my eyes in a futile attempt to see if it was close enough to the edge that I could just grab it.

Goosebumps trailed down my spine as I heard breathing once more, but this time it was up close and personal. I could feel the hot exhales on the back of my neck, making me quickly decide to ditch the phone and my crocs. I broke out into a run, breathing heavier than the being after me. I screamed in horror as eyes appeared all around me, hundreds upon every tree trunk. They watched my retreat calculatingly.

Their roots erupted from the ground, popping loudly as they separated from their earthly limbs stuck in the dirt. Horrendous screeches erupted from them as their knobby limbs scrabbled for me. They sounded so human-like that I felt like I was about to piss myself with fear. Each time they reached for me, I barely escaped their grasp, but my skin began to sting from the scratches. My vision became more and more blurry as my eyes watered. Every part of my body felt like giving up, screaming in agony, but I refused to stop running.

I let out a cry of relief as I saw the break in the tree line, and I exerted my last bit of energy to make it to my in-law’s front porch. I collapsed onto my knees on the concrete, gasping for air. The dogs began to bark and growl at the monsters, and the front door opened.

“Babe!” she yelled out before helping me up.

“We have to get in,” I managed to gasp out, latching tightly onto her forearms.

“What the hell are those things?” she said while looking past me. “Are those \*trees\*?”

“Just go!” I ordered. My attempt at dragging her did no good as she stared at them entranced. She latched onto my arm and swung me around to face them.

Their menacing eyes watched us, but they did not cross the wooded barrier. A few of them bared their teeth at the dogs, but they didn’t make a move toward them. And they have been like that for days now. They haven’t moved an inch, and, since my girlfriend’s parents got home from work, we haven’t left this house. Every time we try to show people, they revert back to their original form as soon as a car comes near the property. People are starting to think we’re crazy, and we have no idea what to do. Some nights, I lie awake thinking I can hear the breathing outside of my window. It makes me wonder if the other trees in our yard are like them, but they have yet to show their true colors if they are.

It’s probably too late for us, but it isn’t too late for you. No matter what, don’t go into the woods, and if you \*absolutely\* have to, run away as soon as the breathing starts. Your life depends on [it.](https://www.reddit.com/r/ShortTalesWithAsh/)

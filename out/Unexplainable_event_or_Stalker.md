When I was a sophomore in high school, a really strange thing happened to me that I still can’t explain to this day. 
It was a typical day, I think the class I was taking at the time was chemistry. We never really had class outside but on this day my professor wanted us to participate in some kind of outdoor assignment. 
I remember I was outside doing some kind of class activity and I had seen a piece of paper on the ground near the woods. I don’t know why I picked it up but it just grabbed my attention. It was neatly folded and me being so curious at the time wanted to see what was inside. I opened it and immediately got chills down my spine. I felt goosebumps all over my body when I read my sisters name on the piece of paper. 
My sister is 2 years younger than me and was in middle school at this time. So her middle school was on the opposite side of town from my high school. 

To be specific, the piece of paper read “Sally’s seat only” I thought it was so weird that someone else out there had my sisters name so I kept it and put it in my pocket. (I’m using a sample name as my sisters name but her real name is actually very unique) The whole day felt off to me. I remember I couldn’t keep my mind off the paper. I was sitting in class and all I wanted was to go home and ask my sister if that belonged to her. I wanted to find some sort of logical explanation for why a random piece of paper had my sisters name and handwriting and how it reached all the way to me. 

I went home that day and had actually forgotten about the piece of paper in my pocket until I started getting into more comfortable clothes. I then saw it fall out of my jeans and grabbed it to show my sister. My sister was in utter shock and asked me where I got this. I told her where I found it and she just had this confused look on her face. She told me she had written that on the bus and had taped it to her seat. How could that piece of paper make it to my school? It didn’t have any kind of tape on it when I picked it up, as I said it was neatly folded. Even if the same bus she was on was also a bus that came to my school, how could it have been ripped from the seat, thrown out and landed all the way to my exact field of view? And I was just the one who happened to pick it up? I have tried to come up with a logical explanation and nothing makes sense. Nothing adds up. All of it is too weird. 

We still don’t understand how that could have happened. Just an extreme series of coincidences or something more sinister behind it? Perhaps a stalker playing mind games with us?

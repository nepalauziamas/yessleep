I'm Jacie, i'm 23f. I live alone in my own apartment, and I love being alone, Ive always hated other peoples company and I don't care about bonding with people, I just want to be alone. That was up until recently, I started experiencing a random burst of loneliness. I thought long and hard and then came to the conclusion a pet would help. Iv'e never owned a dog in my life so I thought I'd give it a try.

After hours and hours of research, and dog proofing my apartment, I was ready. From my research I was sure that a puppy would be too much work so I decided on adopting an older dog. As I pulled up to the local animal shelter I felt a rush of excitement rush through me. I headed inside and talked to a sweet, short, plump women who told me her name was Stacy.

"Hi, I'm looking for an older, calm, dog." I said getting straight to the point. Stacy looked at me with a huge smile, "follow me" she exclaimed. I was taken back by the loud and scary barks as we stepped into the dog room. I clearly wasn't used to being around dogs. We walked by multiple cages, dogs lunging and barking at us, some small some big. Towards the end of the kennels I stopped and saw him, my dog. It "spoke" to me for some reason if you believe in that sort of thing. I felt like Lilo when she picked out Stitch. This dog was different, I crouched down to get level with him after reading his name tag. "Hi Denny!" I said and reached my hand out for him.

2 hours later he was in my backseat. We stopped at the pet store on the way home and got the rest of things I still was yet to get. When we got home Denny ran in and sat on the couch not even stopping to sniff anything. I sat next to him and started petting his rough fur, they didn't even know what breed he was just some old ratty mutt I guess. That's when i realized how weird his eyes were, they were like... so wide?? I don't know how to explain it. Maybe that was why I liked him so much without even thinking about it. I was a little freaked out but chalked it up to his weird mix of breeds and cuddled up on the couch with him and put on a movie. I was happy with my new friend.

I woke up the next morning on the couch. I could hear a faint rustling from the other room, that's when I remembered I now own a dog. That's when it fucking happened. I heard my bedroom door open, it was locked. I'm a paranoid person and I lock my bedroom whenever I leave it since that's where most of my valuables call home. I sprung up and grabbed a knife from the kitchen in all about 10 seconds. Expecting an intruder I turned the corner very slowly to be met with... Denny? Something was wrong, from this point on I didn't hear any noise from him. In that moment a "whine" or an attempt at one came from his mouth.  I was shocked at what I heard, it was so deep. More like a roar of pain. I dropped to the floor crawling over to him to make sure he wasn't hurt by the person who broke in, still holding my knife. I quickly looked for wounds, without seeing any I checked the rest of the house. Nothing.

The day went on as normal, I slept in my bed that night. Denny slept in his. I figured Denny was old, probably learned how to open doors in his life or something. But the "whine" still didn't have any explanation. I fell asleep wondering and woke up in the middle of the night. This is what is scaring me the most since while I'm writing this, it was last night. Denny was standing next to my bed, STANDING. On TWO paws. I screamed and screamed as he let out about 10 of those "whines". I swear for second his eyes were gone, just gone leaving black holes in their place. I practically kicked him out of the room and locked the door. Ive been in here all day, its 5 p.m. now, i keep hearing that god awful noise. I'm scared and starving, I don't know what to do. I can't call the police its a fucking dog. But it can't be, I don't know much about dogs but they are not supposed to act this way.

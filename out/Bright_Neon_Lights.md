Bright neon lights.

The scariest mysteries are the ones that you experience yourself.

Have you ever experienced something years ago that till this day you can't explain?

That happened to me ten years ago. The biggest mystery of my life.

&#x200B;

When I was 17 I would sleep walk. Sometimes I would even sleep walk and go walking around the neighborhood.

I would wake up in the front yard the next morning with the sprinklers hitting my face. 

This happen often sometimes I would even wake up in the street and snap out of it in the middle of an incident (as I would call it).

&#x200B;

The year was 2012, and this is the last time I ever had an incident. My dad and I lived in the Midwest. We lived in the country side of a small town. 

Near the industrial side part lots of oil refineries and warehouses. All I remember was waking up in my pajamas, barefoot and angry at myself for having another incident.

&#x200B;

FUCK! MOTHERFUCKING BITCH!! I yelled out while I slapped myself several times. I started crying.

What the fuck is wrong with me!! I fucking hate this shit.

&#x200B;

I look at my Casio g-shock watch and the bright little neon screen read 2:55 AM.

I look down on the floor and look at my dirty feet. 

&#x200B;

AHHHH!!! I start yelling. OK I will start taking the medicine the doctor gave me.

I hated medicine because I was against supporting big pharma in anyway. 

I look into the horizon and saw the oil buildings, warehouses, and my neighborhood being about a mile away. 

&#x200B;

I was in the middle of fucking nowhere, nothing but farms and barns surrounded me. 

&#x200B;

And then there it was. In the corner of my eye a small office like building in the field. 

&#x200B;

What in god's green earth I said to myself? I knew this small town like the back of my hand. I have never seen this building before, I grew up here.

Dirt biking in these fields.

&#x200B;

The building looked almost futuristic. It was white, it had about 3 floors, and all the lights were on. Bright neon lights. Very clean almost spotless.

I was confused, I took it as my mind playing tricks on me or perhaps new construction that I was not aware of. 

Either way I just walked home.

&#x200B;

About 30 minutes later I arrived home. The time was 3:30 AM. I open the door and I see my father in  the kitchen drinking some water.

My dad was a big burly man, he stood at around 6'5, a big beer belly from all the blue ribbons he enjoys, a no non sense construction foreman for a fire reconstruction company, but overall very loving.

&#x200B;

"Bryan" He said.

&#x200B;

Yes dad I responded.

&#x200B;

"You have to take your medicine son" he said. He gave a me a hug and went to bed. 

&#x200B;

The next morning I woke up to the smell of flapjacks, Applewood bacon and scrambled eggs being cooked by my dad. 

&#x200B;

"Good morning dad" I said and sat down.

&#x200B;

"About last night Bryan, so I called Dr. Hodder and set up an appointment for 2PM today.

&#x200B;

"OK, whatever" I responded

&#x200B;

"HEY HEY it's not whatever, I don't want to find you dead in the street one day. We are getting this problem resolved today".

&#x200B;

"Yes sir" I said

&#x200B;

I chilled at the house for the rest of the day watching old John Wayne movies. I had a thing for classic westerns. 

The time was now 1:30 PM. I was getting ready for my appointment.

&#x200B;

I hopped into my Dads old pick up truck, and off we went.

We drove by the area where I was sleep walking last night, and shock entered my entire system leaving me disoriented.

The building with the bright neon lights I saw yesterday was gone. It was fucking gone.

&#x200B;

Now I know that I am not crazy. However, I kept it to myself. 

&#x200B;

The doctors appointment went fine, and I started taking the pills they prescribed me with for about a month until the mystery kept eating me alive.

&#x200B;

I set my alarm for 2:30 AM and I quietly snuck out of the house. I rode my bike to the location where I saw the building and sure enough it was right there. 

I rubbed my eyes, and slapped myself to make sure it wasn't dreaming. I watched the building for hours and hours until the sun started to rise. As the sun rose the building disappeared. 

For the next few weeks I would repeat the process over and over again. I would watch this phenomenal thing take place right in front of me.

Until one day I couldn't take it anymore. I was going to that building. I did not want to continue experiencing it form the sidelines anymore. So I rode my bike to the building.

I looked inside the windows, and what I saw shook me to the core. 

The beings in there looked different kind of like us but different. 

They were co-mingling with military personnel.

I tried to hold my screams in, but I couldn't I naturally screamed AHHH!

Military personnel ran outside and held weapons to my head. 

I blacked out, and woke up in a holding room of such.

An older gentleman in Military clothing walked in. He looked like he was on steroids, a shaved head a stubbly white beard covered his face.

"Well what took you so long. We have been waiting for you. We are taking you back home."

Tears rolled down my face, I was speechless, numb, I wanted to talk but I physically was not able to move a muscle.   


I kept thinking about my father. How hard he worked to provide a roof over my head. How I was never going to see him again.

"Ohhh... your earth father is on your mind?" The older military man said.

"I could read your thoughts telepathically, it is this alien technology that allows me to. Pretty neat eh? Your father will be fine. He will report you missing. The whole town will be looking for you. You will never be found" he said.

I saw a huge flash and poof I was suddenly in another planet, a another world, nothing like I have seen before. I looked up at the sky and It was deep gorgeous purple. I felt at peace. I felt happy. I heard the most beautiful music coming out of the homes. 

I still think about my earth father sometimes. I miss him, but now I know my purpose and it is to worship the leader of our planet. It is all I want to do for the rest of my life.

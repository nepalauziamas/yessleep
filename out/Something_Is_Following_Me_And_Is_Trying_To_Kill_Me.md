I don't know where to start but I'll start from the beginning.

So, I and my friend Jaxon were walking around the block when we noticed a raggedy old house and as 16-year-old teens we got curious. We wanted to explore it. We should've left it alone but now it's too late what's done is done.

So, then we made a plan we had Wednesday off from school. We said we'll meet up in front of the house at 10:00 AM. when I woke at 8:57 Am I knew I had to get ready for the trip. So I had to empty my backpack and I packed the essentials. A video camera, a flashlight, some food & water, and some gloves and extra batteries in case the flashlight dies.

It was 9:30 AM by the time I was done packing so I ate breakfast just some eggs with toast and also orange juice. By the time I was done it was 10:00 AM and I left

Now by the time I got there, Jaxon was already there and was waiting for me.  "Alright, you ready for this?" Jaxon asked me "Yeah, I'm ready for it," I said then we hopped the fence and went into the backyard

As we were making our way into the house I looked up and saw something move in the window. I thought that it was just my mind making tricks but the longer I stared the more sense it made to not go in there. But I ignored it and went into the house.

And as every horror movie ever the door closed behind us but it wasn't locked which made me feel safer for some reason.  Then Jaxon had the "smart" idea to split up so I gave him extra batteries in case his flashlight died and told him to meet me back here in 20 minutes.

For the first 2 minutes, I felt really scared so I just stood in a place not moving like I just had seen someone die in front of me. Then I told myself I came here to explore so why not explore. A couple of minutes, later I heard a scream that sounded like Jaxon made so I ran as fast as I could towards the noise and I saw it.

There was a dark figure in front of Jaxon, He was about 9ft tall and Its arms reached its legs The thing that horrified me the most is that it was looking at me but its whole body was turned around. I couldn't see anything of it except its eyes. Then I heard Bones cracking and I looked at Jaxon, and I could see all of the bones in his body were out of him. and I heard A terrifying scream and then Jaxon fell on the floor dead.

I ran as fast as humanly possible. as soon as I got out of the doors of the house I fell and i couldn't move then I saw the thing's arms try to reach me into the sunlight but luckily it got burned by it and screeched. then everything went black.

When I woke up I was still laying there looking lifeless on the ground shaking. The sun was about to set and then everything came rushing back to me. As I got up I felt dizzy but I was able to get up and run. but before I ran when I hopped the fence back I swear to you I saw Jaxon's lifeless body floating in the bedroom window. as I ran back home I had a feeling that I was being followed but I just shook it off.

I shouldn't have shaken the feeling off. As I'm writing this I am terrified of my life I'm warning you never go exploring random abandoned places if you aren't ready for what you might see.

But back to what happened as soon as I got home, I locked all of the doors, windows, Etc... And went up to my room and locked my door and window I lay there on my bed thinking about what had just happened when I heard a knock on my door at first I almost jumped out my window to run away but i didn't and I asked "Who is It?" in a muffled voice I heard " Hey, honey I'm home and dinners already downstairs I brought some food." was it really my mom?

I didn't know but just to be sure I looked under the door and what I saw shook me to my core. It was the Monster staring back at me with a grin so big it went from its left to right ear. Then it said "Honey do you not want the food?" and it started laughing menacingly When I finally gather up the courage I yelled "What did you do to my mother You monster" and what I heard terrified me

"Oh, Honey I am Your mother. Or I should say She's dead now and since you want to yell at me You will be dead soon as well" and then it laughed "WHAT DO YOU WANT YOU BITCH" "Oh cursing at me are we. That's not very nice now is it?" and then it happened.

I heard another voice saying "Angle Please come out or it'll kill me as well and I don't want to die Please Angle Please" It was my little brother's voice he was only 10 I couldn't let him be killed. So, I did it...

I jumped Out of my window and as soon as I touched the ground I couldn't move. Not because I was in pain but because I saw my mother's body on the grass all of her bones were out of her body and stapped in various other places I threw up and fainted. When I woke up It was 1:00 Am in The night and I heard Ear piercing screams coming from inside my house. My mother's body wasn't there.

I ran into my house and all I found was My father fighting the things but his arms and legs were being  ripped off it looked so easy to rip them off it looked like the monster was ripping off playdough "I am Azgorth Fear me You Bitch" I heard the thing say my father yelled " I will protect my family no matter what"

and then it located me. Azgorth tore my father's body in half like he was breaking a pencil and I all I heard was a snap then everything went black.

When I woke up there were four of the Things one of Their names is Azgorth so I said "Where the Fuck Is Azgorth I want to talk to him" and they all looked at me and one of them said, "What Did you say about Azgorth." "where the fuck is Asgorth I have to talk to him" then everything went black

When I woke up I saw Asgorth and He had a bone in his mouth I looked down and noticed my legs were missing and then he stabbed me right through my heart.

And Then I woke up It was 9:57 Am then my phone dinged and I saw it was a message from Jaxon confirming if I'm going to come. I quickly reply and say No and that he shouldn't go either. He calls me a wuss and I told him I'd rather be safe than be sorry.

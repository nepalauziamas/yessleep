I was running my brain told me to just keep running. I saw the bathroom and ran into it, slamming the door behind me. I hid in one of the bathroom stalls and locked it.

I couldn't believe this was happening today, I was going to my next class when I heard the shooting. I lied down next to the other student bodies pretending to be dead, just to survive.

I pulled out my phone and sent my mom a message saying "I love you, Mom" because I may never see her again. Before I left school today I remember getting into an argument with her and saying "I hate you!" Not knowing I may never see her again.

I hear someone crying out in the hallway "Someone, please help me" I cried wanting to go out and help her. Her crying then got louder "Please, don't kill me" her cries went silent as I heard a loud bang.

I wanted to cry but didn't want the shooter to hear me, I didn't want them to know where I was. I prayed for someone, to come and save me. I had my whole life, ahead of me just for it to end like this, in the girl's bathroom.

That's when I heard the door open to the bathroom, my heart stopped as someone walked in. All you could hear was his loud footsteps. He opened the stall door next to me, I listened in and heard him taking a piss.

I tried my best not to make a damn sound as he finished going and walked out. Oi m surprised he didn't check any other stalls for anyone. I knew I couldn't stay here, I knew I had to get out of this school if I had any chance at survival.

"Come on, you can do this, just open the stall door and run."

I kept telling myself but didn't have the strength to do it. I opened the stall door slowly, trying not to make a sound. 

I went over and opened a crack of the door to peek out and all I saw was the women's body that got shot. It was my 3rd-period teacher, Mrs.Romo who was my favorite teacher.

I knew I couldn't stay and mourn if I wanted to lay. I knew there was a door near where I could exit out of this hell hole. That was until I heard someone coming so I closed the door and went back to hiding in the stall.

The bathroom door opened and the shooter came back in "I know someone is in here" they walked over to the stall next to me and opened it. I was panicking, this is how I'm going to die now.

He went over to my stall and I closed my eyes ready for him to kill me until I heard a sound. It was Mrs. Romo's moans and cries. I was surprised she was still alive, and the shooter was about to go out in the hallway and finish her off.

But before he could do that my phone dinged, from a message I got, and I heard the shooter come back to my stall, "Oh fuck, I'm going to die."

I remember this story in the back of my head like it was yesterday. 

One day when I was on 4th grade so about 10 years old, I came home around 5 pm from school and my parents were away and that I’m completely alone. They own a small restaurant that are somewhat far from our house but I never needed my parents to pick me up from school because my school were walking distance and I found myself in this situation quite often because I’m their only child and my parents are kind of workaholic. Don’t worry though, my parents never neglected me and there is always food ready at our dining table and I’m somewhat independent which makes my parents comfortable leaving me alone at house most of the times.

I was an introverted kid so social activity that other kids do like sports or playing outdoor never interest me.
It can get lonely sometimes but I’m just not good at socializing, plus I do enjoy my own company surrounded by my hobbies like playing instruments, video games, you can say that I’m quite a nerd.

The sun were about to set and there is a lot of windows in our two floor house and I don’t particularly turn on any lights if there is still natural light that can lighten out the house but since its sunset, it make everything in our house looks orange-ish. Not to mention that our house has been passed down for a couple of generations so it can look quite rustic but definitely still in good condition.

There I was minding my own business while sitting on the couch reading comic book at the first floor when I suddenly heard a loud thumping noise on the ceiling, it didn’t bother me at first but when the second time it happened it got me curious so I gather all my courage and slowly walk through the stairs onto the second floor while yelling “mom, dad is that you?”.

Halfway through the second floor I just stop moving and got a bit scared because no one was answering.
Then out of nowhere from a distance, I heard a soft dribbling of what sounds like a basketball coming from the second floor.
It sounds so faded but then it kept getting louder and louder as if it coming to my direction.
Panicked, shivered, and scared, I ran away out of my house as fast as I can, and then begging our neighbor if I can stay in their house until my parents comes back.

Obviously I told my parents when they came back and they don’t believe me, saying that it’s just my hallucinations and I’m a very imaginative kid. remember when I said I’m not interested in sports? Yeah I don’t own a single basketball or any kind of sports equipment in my house so there is no way it’s just some random animals.
I guess whatever it was, it’s probably lonely too and just wanted to play.

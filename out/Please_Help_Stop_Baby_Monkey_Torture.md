So, at one point in time when I was bored and looking for something fun to watch I found this channel on the web that shows baby monkeys being tortured (adult monkeys too, but the baby torture is extra heinous). It seems to be run by a network of some anonymous sick perverts who get their laughs by torturing all these monkeys. They're likely zoosadists who get off on it too.

If you visit the channel you can see baby monkeys getting their heads smashed and limbs thorn off, getting set on fire, being drowned, getting raped by adult monkeys, slowly dying of hunger because nobody feeds them, and so on. Basically, imagine a way for a baby monkey to die and this channel has probably shown it.

That's what's so horrible, that all this is happening and that there isn't anybody putting a stop to it. Why would someone just broadcast all this horrible torture without any authority figure stepping in to stop it? Who is raising all these monkeys and then setting them up to fight each other over things like small bits of food?

When I've talked to others I've heard excuses like "It doesn't matter to me because the monkeys hurt smaller monkeys, so they might as well deserve it.", but that's not a good excuse. Monkeys are stupid, it's up to us who are smarter than them to not hurt them deliberately. Some bigot even told me "who cares you karen those treerats are just a bunch of stupid homos lol", I mean, seriously? There's so many prejudiced jerks who just laugh at this torture.

That's why I'm now sending out this message, auto translated to several languages. I'm sick of seeing all this terrible baby monkey torture stuff and I hope others who are kind will join me in trying to end it.

As for who I am, I'm Axevn'svua'xa, the seventh offspring of Yog-Sothoth. To find the channel frequency I'm talking about you need to color shift out of space into the third dimension, it's right on the web of the Leng spiders. The place is commonly called Terra.

If you visit be careful to not go near a particular mountain range because some racist slave owners left a few Shoggoths in that area.

As a transcendental intelligence I can't just stand by and say nothing when I see all this sick monkey torture happening.

I don't care what your excuse is, if you raise a bunch of innocent baby monkeys and then put them in situations where they begin to rape and kill other monkeys (even to the point that the monkeys start to nuke each other with nuclear weapons) while you just sit by and leer with glee at it (get off on it), and broadcast this shit for the whole universe to see, you are a zoosadist.

I'll say it. That's the high and mighty being who really runs Terra, some sick revolting zoosadist, and if you hear my message and have the ability to put a stop to this torture but still do nothing but watch it go on, you're probably a zoosadist too. That said, if you can't do anything about it, I obviously don't blame you.

I've at least tried to get others to care about putting an end to monkey torture.

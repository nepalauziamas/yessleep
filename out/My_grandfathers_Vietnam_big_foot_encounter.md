My grand father told be this story a couple months ago about a weird creature he encountered with his platoon in Vietnam. He said it looked like a Bigfoot but different in some way.

The story begins at cam ranh air base in 1957. He arrived at the barracks and went right to bed because he knew the next day was going to be a long one. He awoke and joined his platoon. 

They started their patrol through the jungle when they found a injured ARVN soldier next to a tree. My grandpa asked him what had happened and the ARVN responded “it’s still near, get away from here” my grandpa was confused and didn’t think anything of it. They put the ARVN on a stretcher and sent him back to base. 


They continued their patrol and everything was normal for a couple hour until they heard a loud deep scream type sound. They rushed toward it guns at the ready.  They cut through the brush into a clearing and saw a 7 foot tall harry creature gnawing on bones

One of the men started to shoot at it, (bad idea) the creature lunged toward him and flung him into the air. The soldier crashed to the ground and screamed. The creature grabbed the man and bit into his legs. The other men started shooting at this thing. It yelped and dropped the man.

The creature ran into the woods. A soldier ran to go help the man that was bit. The man’s legs were gone and his spine was broken. The medic came over and put the man on a stretcher. 

They started their way back to base. They went about a mile before the thing came back for revenge. It jumed out of the bushes and snatched one of the soldiers, it dragged   the man into the brush. 

All the soldiers started sprinting down the trail. My grandpa tripped on a rock and smashed his head on the ground making him black out. He awoke the next morning with a huge gash on his head and blood all over the place.

He started to get up when he heard large foot steps coming near. I later back down and acted dead. The creature walked by him thinking he was dead. A few minutes later he got up and started walking but soon he realized he didn’t know where he was. He walked down the trail for awhile hoping to find someone from his platoon.

He walked for hours but he eventually found a helmet. He turned it in circles and found that their was a hole through the middle. He walked a little farther and found what was left of his platoon. All the soldiers were dead but the medic was no where to be seen.

He grabbed a gun and continued hoping to find the medic still alive. He walked for a couple miles when he began to think he was never going to find the base untill he found a map. He grabbed the map and looked at it for awhile. He figured out where to go and started walking.

The next morning he arrived at the base. His clothes were ripped and his face was bloody. After they got him cleaned up my grandpa went looking for the medic. Eventually he found the medic in a tent. One of his arms was gone and he had scratches all over.

“What happened” my grandpa asked. The medic responded with “I ran and ran with that man on my back until I collapsed and a patrol found me” my grandpa went and Asked to go home that day. 

My grandpa was changed by this. He has been going to therapy since. I’ve asked around and no one seems to know what that thing was and my only explanation was Bigfoot.

Just as the title says - it began as yet another game and I wouldn’t even pay attention to it, as kids on our streets come up with something every single day, running around, screaming and laughing. Last week it was hospital and fire station, this week it’s a store. 

&#x200B;

They got a folding table and few chairs somewhere - probably some of the parents approved on their initiative. Then there were the goods: some leaves, stones, couple of sticks and some old newspapers. A couple of kids were sitting by the table, pretending to be the cashiers. The others had more generic roles: some boys were “warehouse” workers, bringing the products from somebody’s backyard. One girl was swiping the walkway, where the “store” was located. Other kids were security guards, shift managers (or whatever) and isle workers (I think, as considering the “store” had only one display - it was hard to do anything else rather than running around, pretending something’s happening all the time). 

&#x200B;

Why would I even bother telling you about any of this? Just another silly kid entertainment, right? Of course, except one thing caught my attention - a huge stack of dollar bills. I didn’t believe my eyes at first. One of the cashier girls was holding a pile of green papers tossing them around, counting. 

&#x200B;

Yeah, those definitely could be fake, like you know - souvenir money, with Ronald McDonald’s picture instead of presidents, but if you ask me - those looked pretty damn real: slightly worn, a bit crumpled stack of US dollars. 

&#x200B;

Probably one of the kids went all in and picked out Dad’s stash clean and had no idea what sort of punishment yet to come down on him. Or maybe they found them somewhere, those lucky brats. 

&#x200B;

But soon enough my initial curiosity turned to a complete misunderstanding of what was happening. 

One of my neighbors, Liam, who was walking back home stopped by the improvised store, took a moment to check out the goods and said in a cheerful voice, supporting the play:

“Hello, ladies. How much for this beautiful stone over here?”

&#x200B;

“It’s not a stone, mister. It’s a pack of ice cream!” - the girl said, making a comically serious face. I could hear both of them clearly, as I was sitting just across the road, enjoying my drink on my lawn. 

&#x200B;

“Alright, alright. My mistake, sorry. So how much for this wonderful pack of ice cream then?” - Liam laughed. 

&#x200B;

“Two hundred dollars, mister” - the girl replied. 

&#x200B;

Wow! What an appetite there - I laughed to myself. But my laughter faded quickly and I’ve dropped my jaw, seeing how my neighbor took out his wallet, spent couple of seconds checking inside and passed the stated sum. What the hell? I couldn’t believe my eyes. I didn’t know Liam that well, but we chatted couple of times and I know that he’s not a rich man. He didn’t have any kids yet, so that excluded that “i’ll give it to you now, but please give it back later” scenario between him and his daughter. I was speechless. Two hundred bucks, can you believe it? For a stone. I clearly missed some context here. But ain’t my business. So I’ve finished my ice tea and went back to the house to do something else. 

&#x200B;

Next day they were still there - selling junk, having fun.  It seemed that the roles were switched, as now the boy and another girl were cashiers, and so on. The “stock” was updated too: some empty soda cans, egg trays and other garbage was aligned on the “counter”. But what’s more interesting - today there were way more “customers”. The Millers were there, Mr. & Mrs. Davis too, as well as some other people from the neighborhood. They formed a line and patiently waited for their turn to do some shopping. What the hell was happening here? Did somebody decide to run some sort of charity marathon and I wasn’t notified or something? I saw stacks of bills growing in number on the counter of the pretended shop and the more I looked - the less I understood. 

&#x200B;

So, as I knew some of those people - I’ve decided to ask around on what was this all about. I walked straight to Jake Garcia, who lived two houses to the left and shot my questions.

Jake just shrugged and said: “Oh, you know… It’s just a child’s play. Don’t take it too serious.”

That explained nothing. So I pushed further but got only “Man, I think you’re overreacting” in response. 

And the very next moment my neighbor landed two and a half grands for an empty juice box and an outdated newspaper, I shit you not. And I know Jake - we had a beer couple of times. He’s a plumber and that kind of money is more than he usually makes in a month. 

&#x200B;

This was just crazy! 

&#x200B;

The next day the performance continued. Lots of people, piles of money and some trash in return. I’ve talked to more folks and not a single face gave me a proper explanation of what was happening around here. But later something outstanding happened. 

&#x200B;

I was in the kitchen, doing dishes after the lunch, as suddenly I’ve heard shouts from the street, so I’ve walked out outside wiping my wet hands with a towel to check it out. 

&#x200B;

It was old Ron Hill who seemed to argue with kids. But in fact - he was begging them.

&#x200B;

“Please” - he said - “take this as a payment. This clock is priceless. And I’m too old and tired to go to the pawn shop. Please”.

&#x200B;

“Sorry, mister, our store has a cash-only policy” - the kid, who I assume played the store manager, replied. 

&#x200B;

This was getting out of hand. So I’ve crossed the road, intending to calm down old Ron and give him piece of mind. So I ended up standing next to him, right before the table with goods. 

&#x200B;

“Look, Ron. It’s just a game, no need for all this drama, ok?” - I’ve said. “They are going to forget about this tomorrow, so you don’t need to act like this. I mean, what’s wrong with you people? It’s just some junk, see?”

&#x200B;

I’ve pointed  to the garbage on the folding table and quickly looked over it. And then something clicked in me. Among the dirty rocks and empty coke bottles I saw it. I really wish I could describe it, but I can’t. It was the wiggling of the tail of my first dog Odie, it was the tenderness of my first kiss with the girl I liked, it was the fading laugh of my mother and the last words of my father… It was everything that I would ever want to live for and every single thing that made me happy. I’ve picked it up from the table to take a closer look, as the squeaky child’s voice said: “Hey, mister, no touching. You have to pay for that!”

&#x200B;

That brought me back to my senses and I realized I was holding a broken toy truck, missing a door and a couple of wheels. 

&#x200B;

I’ve put it back, turned away and walked straight back home, without saying a single thing. The emotional impact of what I have just experienced was too much to take. Like all your happy moments replayed on x10 speed and then the fact that you’ll never experience them again hits you straight in the face. Never. 

&#x200B;

That night I didn’t sleep well. Some really dark thoughts found their way into me, whispering things, drowning me in depressive soul-searching. My life divided into “before” and “then”, and I have absolutely no idea how that happened. I just lost the will to live. Everything around made no sense anymore. My job? Nah. My potential future family? That seems like too much trouble. My friends? They already forgot about me. 

&#x200B;

There was just this thing. The one kids were selling. I would pay anything to get it. 

&#x200B;

So the next day I went straight to the “store” with the intention to get it, no matter what.  And I was greeted with nothing. Just an empty street before me. 

&#x200B;

Well, maybe they didn’t set it up yet? I’ll wait. 

&#x200B;

But you’ve guessed it - hours later there still was no one around. 

&#x200B;

I went to see around the block, because, just maybe - they’ve switched the place of their games, but again - no table in sight. I’ve caught Jimmy leaving his house, the neighbor kid who played a security guard most of the days and asked him about it.

&#x200B;

He looked me in the eye and said: “Nah, we’re not playing this anymore. We are building a spaceship now!”.

&#x200B;

Should I say I’ve felt miserable and devastated? There was no light at the end of the tunnel. I can’t make the kids play the store again, I can’t set the mood, I can’t order them. All I am able to do is wait - until the history repeats itself, but still there’s no guarantee. 

&#x200B;

I don’t understand the nature of this. I don’t know how I trapped myself. I’ve been to doctors, specialists and even so-called dark-arts experts. The pills won’t help, the alcohol just makes me sick.

Each day I look through my window hoping that the table will pop up across the street, then I would rush and pay any money they ask to make me whole again. 

&#x200B;

But kids grow so fast these days. I don’t know how much more I can take. And the whispering voice in my head says I’m wasting my time. It’s all futile. I’m not ok.

I'll start off with the background. I'm twenty-five, recently divorced and I work for a graphic design company ten miles out of a town that has been abandoned for over a hundred years. The only way to get to the office building is to drive through the town. No other way in, or out.

A few months ago, I was working late at the office, finishing up a crucial commission for an employer when I looked down to the pristine white numbers on my computer's clock: 20:31. Shook out of my creative trance, and suddenly feeling like I hadn't eaten for days, I stood up, packed my belongings and left my desk. I should have known that something wasn't right. I have an extremely slow metabolism and I find it hard to eat large meals. That morning, I brought a ham and tomato sandwich and a large bottle of ginger beer, which was more than enough to keep me running throughout the day.

Not realizing this until long after the incident, I took the stairs down to the lobby and left the building. I then crossed the car park to where the beaten down Honda that my dad gave to me was parked, opened the door and sat at the driver's seat, the hunger subsiding. I put the key into the ignition, started my car and drove out of the car park onto the country lane heading towards the abandoned town. Everything was fine, until about 15 minutes into the journey, when I noticed a shadow in the shape of a hunched over old lady which was following my tail lights.

I sped up slightly, my car groaning as my speedometer surpassed 30. I had only taken my car in for a servicing the week before and slammed on the brakes, paranoid about the car exploding. As soon as I had, I heard a thud from the back of my car. And the paranoia had stopped. The hunger had stopped, and I felt as full as I usually did. I got out of my car and looked behind it. No one. I had hit no one. Where the shadow was a few minutes ago, closing in on my car, was nothing. Confused and terrified, I heard a shrill scream come from the trees around me.

After a childhood full of watching horror movies and shouting at the torch-bearing protagonist to not go into that creepy basement, I did the one sensible thing I could think of. I got back into my car, closing the driver-side door as softly as I could muster, with a low and soft thud resulting, which echoed into the night and alerted whatever the thing that just screamed to my presence. I locked my car doors, letting out a light sigh, my heart thudding in my chest out of a mix of fear and relief.

I don't know how long the thing was watching me, all I know is that when I opened my eyes after that sigh of relief and fear and looked out to the forest's edge, it was there. Bony, dead hands, with protruding white fingers, too long to have ever belonged to a human. Eyes like something out of an ancient nightmare, staring at me, grinning with it's mouldy, decaying teeth, licking it's crusty, foul lips with it's tongue. I froze, paralysed by fear once again. My eyes darted all over it's form, trying to find something that was somewhat human. But with no relief.

This thing wasn't human. It wasn't anything close to human. Another muffled scream, and the thing's head span, with unnatural speed and to an even more unnatural degree. It ran for the woods, once again. The paralysis leaving me, I stuck my key in the ignition, turned the key, and started driving away. About ten minutes later, I left the woods behind, driving through the town, with the realization starting to hit me; those things destroyed this town.

So if you ever see an abandoned town, with a dense forest nearby, and you see the shadow of an old woman behind you, do not stop. Drive by and get as far away as you possibly can.

Don't make the same mistake I did.

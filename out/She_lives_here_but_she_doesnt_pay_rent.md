I’ve been living in this apartment for two years now. Two years without any weird shit happening. Two **normal** fucking years. Has it been the best living experience ever? Eh, probably not. I’ve dealt with everything from ants to rats to noisy neighbors, to police sirens in the middle of the night. Hell, the lady in 3A came home to find her apartment broken into a couple weeks back. All those things pale in comparison to what’s been going on lately. There’s some fucking weird shit that’s been happening for the past couple of weeks, and it all culminated in me firing my gun last night at a girl that keeps fucking showing up in my apartment.


“Uhm, that’s a little drastic,” you’re probably thinking.


While you might be right about that, hear me out first, and *then* tell me if I’m overreacting.


It started off with little things at first. Things I think we’ve probably all experienced once or twice in our lives. One morning, I got up and found a bowl on the counter. Just a regular bowl, sitting there. I was really confused, but figured maybe I’d forgotten it there when I unloaded the dishwasher the night before. I put the bowl back in the cupboard and went to the washroom. As soon as I got back to the kitchen to make my coffee, that fucking bowl was on the counter again.


*Man,* I thought, *Must be tired*. Y’know when you’re distracted sometimes and you plan on doing something but you don’t end up following-through? I figured that’s what happened with the bowl. I thought I’d put it away, but I hadn’t. So, I lifted it off the counter and put it back in the cupboard. I turned around to start the coffee maker. By the time I turned to face the counter again, that fucking bowl was sitting there, as though mocking me.


“What the fuck,” I murmured to myself.


*I’m too young to be going senile,* I thought. Pissed off at...myself, I guess?...I shoved the bowl back into the cupboard and slammed the door.


“And STAY there,” I yelled sternly.


I never believed in that supernatural mumbo jumbo, so it never occurred to me something *else* might have been moving the bowl. I just figured since I hadn’t had my morning cup of coffee, my brain was glitching out or some shit.


I probably wouldn’t have thought about the bowl thing again if it had stopped there, but it didn’t. It wasn’t the only incident. Not by a long shot.


The next day, I came back from the gym in desperate need of a shower. I usually hop in the shower *at* the gym, but the goddamn water main exploded or some shit, so I had to drive home enduring my own sweaty stink. So, anyways, I got home, jumped in the shower, and turned it on real hot and soothing. I like my water practically scalding hot. Like, part sauna, part shower.


But then, as the shower walls fogged up, I noticed something: the outline of someone standing in the room. I could see the shape clearly through the misty air. It wasn’t just standing in place, either. It was moving around, bending over and everything. I grabbed a bar of soap and threw open the shower door, ready to defend myself.


Steam trickled out of the bottom of my shower.


Except the room was empty.


*The room was empty.*


My skin was covered in goosebumps despite the heat.


Now, look. I know my horror tropes, okay? This is exactly the point in time where the audience is yelling at their screens because the protagonist is being a moron and the place is *clearly* haunted. But look, this isn’t fucking Hollywood, okay? I didn’t *just* move into a creepy old house with a dark history. I’ve been living in this apartment for a couple years without *any* incident. Even *if* I believed in ghosts --- which I don’t---, that’s just not how hauntings work. You don’t get a two-year grace period before suddenly, out of nowhere, BOOM: haunted. That’s dumber than propping up a ladder on two unicycles.


A few days passed with more incidents like that bowl bullshit. I’d put a dinner plate on the counter, turn around to find it missing. One time, I turned around and found a glass in its place. Hell, one of my beer bottles turned into a fucking yogurt cup. I *know* I didn’t bring yogurt into my house. I fucking hate yogurt. Another time, I saw a stain on the carpet one minute, and it was gone the next. Just a ton of weird shit like that.


I tried not to think about it as I went to bed early that night. I had a construction gig across town the next day and wanted to get an early start. Problem was, I kept hearing music and chattering. No matter how many pillows I stuffed over my head, I could hear the sound annoying the fuck out of me.


Fucking neighbors, am I right?


I eventually got out of bed and stomped around my apartment, trying to find the source of the noise. I put my ear to each wall, but couldn’t quite tell which neighbor was at fault. When my irate-o-meter reached maximum, I just started banging on the walls to try and stop that shit.


I got even more pissed off when a neighbor came knocking on my door, scolding me for all the banging. I tried to explain what I was doing, but when I invited her in to try and pinpoint where the music was coming from, I realized the apartment had gone quiet.


I apologized, figuring whoever was making the noise had gotten my message and quieted down.


After that, I thought I’d be able to get some shut-eye, right? But nope. In the middle of the night, I was woken up by the sound of static and light pouring in from the TV. I groaned and reached for the remote control, but it had gone missing. Groggily, I climbed out of bed and waddled to the TV stand, turning it off manually. *Must have been a power outage,* I thought. Sometimes, when the power flicks off and on quickly, my old shitbox turns on. I tried to convince myself that’s all it was, but in light of all the rest of this shit, I was getting a *little* spooked.


I crawled back in bed and wrapped my comforter tightly over myself.


I must have been asleep for less than a few minutes when I heard the crackle of the TV as it turned on a second time.


“Fuuuuuuuuuck,” I groaned.


This time, I went straight for the power cord. I yanked it out of the wall and went back to bed. Fuck that shit. I need absolute silence when I sleep, otherwise I’ll wake up.


Imagine my surprise - or rather, my shock-, when the TV turned on again.


“Son of a,” I stopped.


Hadn’t I pulled the power cord out of the wall? How was the TV on? I squinted through the dark room, able to see the cord still in the wall from my angle. *Must have been a dream,* I thought. It was the only explanation. I’d dreamt I’d unplugged the TV. I moved to slip out of bed, but as I turned, I felt something cold against my side. The TV remote. Why was it in bed with me? I must have knocked it off the nightstand somehow. I turned the TV off one final time, and dozed off with the remote still in my hand in case I needed to do it again.


If all this shit wasn’t bad enough. If malfunctioning TVs, disappearing kitchenware, and moving shadows weren’t bad enough, I started finding weird shit on my coffee table. Weird as girly books like ‘Pride and Prejudice’ and ‘How to be a strong female influence in the workplace’. Those *had* to be a prank of some sort. I’d told a few of my friends about the bowls and shit, so I guess they thought they’d fuck with me. Not that it was *all* bad. See, I had a party one night and this chick saw one of those books.


“Oh, I didn’t know you read Gillian Flynn” she said, as she picked up the book.


I smirked. “Are you kidding me? I love her shit.”


I’m not going to lie. I did kind of flip through the books real quick. Enough that I could feign a bit of knowledge without actually having read any of them. Enough that I could bag myself a sexy lady that night.


Once the party was over, I hosted a private little book club between the covers. If you know what I mean.


And then, there was two days ago. I was standing in my kitchen, annoyed by another session of take-the-coffee-mug-out-and-find-it-missing, when I suddenly spotted my mug across the kitchen. It was in the hands of a transparent-looking figure. She looked at me. I looked at her. She dropped the mug. It crashed on the ground and shattered into pieces.


She was gone.


And I had to clean up the mess.


I had to clean up this fucking ethereal being’s goddamn motherfucking mess.


Last night was the worst incident yet. I’m not going to lie, I went to bed drunk, and I might have still been a little drunk when I woke up in the middle of the night. But look, drunk or not, I know what I saw. It doesn’t matter how much alcohol you ingest, you don’t hallucinate turning over in bed and seeing someone lying next to you. You might *forget* who’s lying down next to you when you go to bed, but you don’t just *imagine* someone that wasn’t there at all. Point being: I woke up for whichever reason. Maybe a car horn outside, maybe my upstairs neighbors were trampling on the ground again, or maybe someone was throwing a party again: it doesn’t matter. I’m a light sleeper, and I woke up.


I saw the silhouette of a woman next to me. I saw the sheets rise and fall with her breath. I *knew* I’d gone to bed alone. I didn’t know who this freak was---maybe some homeless woman who snuck into my apartment. Whatever she was, I decided she was the cause of all the shit that had been happening these past weeks. I was about to yell at her when she opened her eyes and saw me.


Her shriek nearly pierced my eardrums.


I rolled out of bed and reached for the glock I keep tucked under my mattress. Yeah, I know, but if I was gonna get jacked by some asshole,  might as well be prepared, right? My reaction was out of instinct. There was an intruder in my bed. In my HOUSE. I was in my rights to defend myself. I wasn’t trying to hit *her*, but be damned if I wasn’t going to scare her off. I shot once, the bullet flying towards the wall behind her.


Something was wrong.


I smelled the sweet scent of the gunpowder, I saw the flash of light from the gunshot, but I didn’t hear the piercing sound of the explosion. I’m not saying it was like in the movies when the murderers use a silencer and all you hear is a little pop: I mean there was no sound at all. Like I hadn’t fired, but yet I felt the recoil and smelled the smoke. I peered over the edge of the bed. She was gone. The shell casing was at my feet, but the bullet was nowhere to be seen.


I don’t know what’s going on, but it’s freaking me out. Does anyone have any advice? I don’t believe in none of that supernatural crap, but I swear this shit happened. I can’t explain it. I need help.

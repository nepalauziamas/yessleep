Seven years I spent, under the supervision of Doctor Walter.

My Doctor is by no means a bad doctor. He always makes sure I take my sweet pills. He always makes sure I get my exercise. He indulges on me many of my favorite treats at times, Lemon Drop, Soury Patches, if I’ve been particularly good. 

Doctor Walter had to remind me constantly why I was there. A body was laid out on the ground in front of my feet. A mangled corpse, I can’t make out a face. There isn’t a face.

Under my Doctor’s orders, I usually have a pretty strict daily routine: wake up, eat, stay inside, eat, go outside, eat, stay inside, sleep. I never have to make time for him, he always comes to me. 

We usually talk. He’s the only one I usually talk to, all the rest don’t seem like they’re in the mood to have a good dialogue. We usually talk about me, sometimes we talk about him. 

When we talk about me, sometimes it’s about what I see. I see figures, not part of anything in the area, but figures out of place in the world, just for me. These figures could look at me, these figures can see me. I see more when I go outside. Doctor Walter helps me distinguish them from real people, but it doesn’t matter anyways, the real people are never in the mood to talk. 

I hate going outside.

Need I remind you, though, that my doctor is by no means a bad doctor. He treats me kindly with treats, and I accept them graciously. He always knows what I want, and I always try to accept it.

Sometimes when Doctor Walter comes to my room, I don’t want him there. It’s my area, and he knows I’m very protective of my belongings, but I can’t keep anything from him. There is not a single thing I can keep from him. 

Doctor Walter had to constantly remind why I’m here. I was angry. I was so angry, but I could never control my emotions. The blood from the body was like a shallow river on my feet.

I could never control my emotions. Not before Doctor Walter gave me the treats. The treats helped calm me at all times. They helped me flow better, they helped me feel better. Not even the figures bothered me any more as much. 

The only problem with the treats, was having to go outside to take them. The real others didn’t acknowledge me, not ever.

Doctor Walter always had special spots he’d let me have me my treats, they taste so good. 

We usually talked when Doctor Walter came to my room. Sometimes, we talked about him. The others weren’t his people, it was only me. I was his one and only focus, and that filled me to the brim with joy. I can smile from ear to ear knowing I’m not alone. 

So many other people around here are alone, but not me. I’ve had him, for seven years.

Doctor Walter had to remind me constantly why I was still there. Screaming, bloody murder screeching from them, I couldn’t do it cleanly, and they wouldn’t leave me alone. I kept trying my best to finish up, but it took too long.

I’m here now. I’m not mad anymore, I’m not sad anymore, I’m here now.

By no means is he a bad doctor. He’s always given what I need, he’s always let me be my best me.

Under my Doctor’s orders, I have a pretty strict daily routine.

The Doctor didn’t show up yesterday.

I was confused. I waited. I kept waiting. I became afraid. Fear of what’s happening around me, I couldn’t tell what was a figure, I couldn’t get any treats. 

I couldn’t remember why I was there.

These feelings only got worse for me, worse and worse. I was lost, I was alone, I was afraid. My being was being shattered, my feelings were feeling intense, but I stayed, I stayed waiting, I hoped he would come back today. 

When I woke up this morning, everything was different. I hadn’t had any treats, nothing to indulge myself with. The shapes were gone, I had no reason to go outside. And I felt peaceful.

Somebody else came by for once. A bright light shined like a beam in my room. They grabbed me, away from my space. It was finally time for me to go.

Looking back one last time in my room, I noticed something. Doctor Walter had never left me, he was in my room the entire time. 

For seven years I stayed with Doctor Walter, for seven years he stayed with me.

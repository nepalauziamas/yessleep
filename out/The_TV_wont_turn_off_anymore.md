I awoke to the sound of giggling and faint static from the living room, as I sat up I glanced to my wife who layed to the left of me. She was sound asleep, as she's always been a heavy sleeper. I got up, rubbing the sleep from my eyes and walked out to the living room to check on my two kids

They were sat infront of the TV, staring directly at it, giggling in intervals but..there's nothing there. The static fizzed loudly as I walked over and looked down at the two of them, their eyes bloodshot as though they hadn't blinked in hours. Turning off the TV I looked at the two of them.

"What are you doing of of bed? It's nearly 2am" I questioned, the two children snapped their heads up at me as if I'd disturbed them before slowly rising to their feet and trudging back to the bedroom. 

I thought it was strange, the way they seemed to move in sync without looking at eachother but I thought nothing of it and played it up to being tired before I walked back and layed back down, falling asleep.

I woke up two hours later to that same deafening static sound, rubbing my eyes again as I pulled the blanket from my body and stood, stalking out to the living room to see my children nowhere to be found, but the TV set to that same static setting. I sighed in annoyance and turned it back off

Turning to head back to my bedroom, I heard the familer click of the TV turning back on. Whipping my head around the room for my children, they didn't seem to be close. I turned back again and shut it off once more. But again as I turned the click rang out and the static started up again.

Scowling I reached back and unplugged the TV, brushing my hands and Turning back to my bedroom, I froze. That same. Fucking. Static. 

I turn again and call out for my children to no response, I look at the static blurred screen of the TV, it looks as if it's moving to form something?

Intrigued, I sat down and watched as it molded into a deformed, uncanny version of a cartoon design. The audio was disgustingly distorted it almost made me physically sick. 

I stood once more, turned it off and walked back to my bedroom, attempting to ignore the sound of the static that rang out once more. 

Awakening once more to the faint giggles, I sat up, my wife followed suit this time.

"Are the kids watching cartoons..? What's that noise?" 

"Static.." I muttered under my breath, standing with her and shuffling back out to see my kids sitting there once more, staring dead ahead at that same disgustingly deformed show. To my wife, it was still mere static, I envy her for being unable to see this.

Suddenly in an instant, a disgusting static hand slammed against the screen of the TV, the noise startling me before it shattered the glass and grabbed the head of my youngest child, who's face was squashed violently between the fingers of this monster before his now lifeless body was raised and slammed against the ground, then ever so slowly retracted into the TV as me and my wife watched in horror. 

I attempted to lunge forward to grab my other child but I was promptly grabbed and whipped across the room before the same thing that happened to my youngest happened to the eldest. Their body being slammed to the floor then dragged inside the screen as the static roared violently. 

And within moments, the TV was back to that static screen, the Glass of the TV shattered but it continued anyway. Even if we unplugged the TV, tore it apart, threw it out, turned it off. It kept coming back. 

It's been 7 days since this all began and I'm beginning to see why my children were laughing, maybe I should sit and watch the cartoon a bit longer. Nothing bad could happen, right?

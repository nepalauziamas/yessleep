California is very dry. I don't know how anyone lives here, but it's where the modeling is. I've never been good at math, science, or reading, but I have a jawline and symmetrical eyes that magazines want. I moved out here last month. I'm not a good person, I'm not a bad person, I'm a bored person. This field by my house stretched on for miles, the hot sun beating down on my eyes whenever I tried to see it during the day, exhausting to look at in its heat and splendor. What better way to celebrate the splendor of the Lord, and the American Agricultural Industry than lighting off some firecrackers. I came back that night, under a new moon, and not a single star apart from the pale lights of the city.

I got my lighter, and I started lighting them off, ones that whirred, popped, banged. lit colors whizzed deep into the field with tiny explosions. I watched, a childhood me entranced by the colors. Not here long enough to score any drugs, playing pretend was the best I could do. I lit a firecracker wrapped in an American flag, with a bald eagle in a strike position. It flew in the air, did nothing, and fell to the ground. There was a small fire, and it grew, each blade of grass in the endless expanse burning in brilliant white-orange.

I squinted my eyes, a bright light damaging my retinas, I heard a voice. 

&#x200B;

"Oh, you're awake, my friend Dr. Richardson found you by the field, you're lucky" 

&#x200B;

"Thank you, and who are you?" I asked, nervous, thankful to be alive as I understood what might have happened. 

&#x200B;

"Dr. Sholz, but a boy as handsome as you can call me Olaf," with a wink, "you've had a nasty burn, but I will make you look like your true self" 

&#x200B;

I nodded, and sat back, still a bit dazed from everything. A mask was fixed over me and I began breathing the drugs that would put me to sleep, but I swore I could hear someone in the background saying "Your son is still alive" to the doctor. A nurse or assistant I imagine. 

&#x200B;

Asleep there was terrible screeching. 

&#x200B;

The lounge chair came up, there stood Dr. Olaf with a hand mirror, the opaque side turned to me. "I've made you into your true self, dear boy" he then turned around the mirror, there was blood all over me, and crudely stitched onto my face,  stitches poking through, was the face of a monkey. 

&#x200B;

I screamed. 

&#x200B;

"This is your true self! You act like an ape, you look like an ape, you're an ape my dear boy" he laughed. he lifted up his other hand there was my face or at least the skin. 

&#x200B;

"And this my dear boy, this beautiful face that you don't deserve, will go on the face of my son who you burned in the fire!"

Needless to say, Reddit, I've made a mistake.

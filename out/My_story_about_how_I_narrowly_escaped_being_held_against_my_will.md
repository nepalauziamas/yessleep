This just happened less than 24 hours ago. I’m still in shock and I need to vent so bare with me. I will try to spell everything clearly and tell the story piece by piece. 

So here’s a little back story : I’m a 23y/o woman. And I’ve been single for about two years now. The past two months I’ve been texting this nice guy through the Facebook Messenger App. We’ve even video chatted numerous times. 

I really liked him and thought that he was super sweet. Strangely enough, he stays maybe 10 minutes away from me. Heck we even ran into eachother at our local grocery store. So yesterday, which was July 4th we decided to hang out at his home. 

So being that he really didn’t stay far from me,he met me halfway and we walked back to his home together . The time was around 7:15pm. We get into his home and he takes me straight to the basement. This really should’ve been a red flag for me honestly but I didn’t want to judge him but still? 

Why the basement ? I brought my own weed & he had his own and we Both smoked together . I looked around his “mancave” and noticed a few Steele reserve cans lying around. Which was strange because I had not even smelled alcohol on his breath during our walk. (I don’t do well with drunks. 

I grew up around one) but anyway we’re both high . And he just downs another can of beer. At some point we start to cuddle eventually we start to have sex. I’m not sure if you’d like to include these details because they are sensitive but I’ll detail this situation the best way I can; 

eventually I’m turned off during sex because none of it just was romantic he kind of threw his body weight on top of me. So I tell him hey get off me I wanna take a break. He didn’t listen . He just ignored me. 

Mind you this guy is 5’9 and probably 190 - 200 lbs. so he’s extremely heavy . At some point in my head I kinda of just let him finish instead of trying to push him off me. This is sick, but I thought it’d be better for to let him finish then to keep resisting. 

After he was done, At some point I just kinda shut down and mentioned that I need to go home. And so I started to put on my clothes but he stopped me dead in my tracks. He literally threw my T-shirt and pants across the room and got right in my face and started trying to convince me to stay. He said something like “you don’t have to go home”. “I can fix this” “pls tell me what I did wrong “ . 

Him doing all of this sobered me up quickly. I wasn’t even stoned anymore. My adrenaline was rushing at this point . There was no way that I was gonna stay there in that basement with that CREEP. As I’ve stated before, this guy was drunk. Having already downed 3-4 steele reserves he could barely stand up. 

His eyes were bloodshot. For three hours straight, which honestly felt like an eternity, I argued with this drunk piece of shit about letting me go home. At some point I texted my bsf but, to no avail because she was more than likely asleep. 

At some point, he let me put my clothes back on , but was adamant that i would not be going anywhere. Eventually he had to use the bathroom. he had to go upstairs to go pee.. i waited 10 seconds after he went upstairs…i made a break for it. 

I ran out of his back door and hopped the gate that connects to his driveway. I’m guessing he came back to see his back door wide open and could easily put two & two together. By the time I reached the end of his driveway he started running after me calling my name in the process . I had on fur flops and These were preventing me from running so i took them off and started running down the street in my socks. 

It’s at this point in my life where I’m feeling fearful. Scared shitless. I had no actual clue where I was at because the neighborhood he lives in had no street lights . And I’m still not familiar with the immediate area. 

So Im just running on this dark street . Then It hits me : Jesus Christ call 911. I get on the phone with the dispatcher and explain my situation to her and gave her my location. The police located me & took me home and I also filed a police report. I’m not sure if the police located him. I gave them a detailed description of how he looked and everything. 

I’m thinking nothing will come of it. I honestly thought that this guy was super cool beforehand. I would’ve never thought he was a drunk. I don’t know if it was the beers he may have had . You know they say when a person is drunk , the truth comes out.

 Either way I’m still pretty shaken up about this because this was extremely unexpected. I never thought he was a drunk or the fact that he would quite literally hold me against my Will. I really used to beat myself up about being single but I don’t know now . I prefer being single vs dating. 

I’m willing to admit that maybe I shouldn’t have gone over to his house at night. That was kind of dumb on my part but, He seemed Soo trustworthy. And that is what scares me the most. It’s like he was wearing a mask. Only for it to fall off and show who he really is.

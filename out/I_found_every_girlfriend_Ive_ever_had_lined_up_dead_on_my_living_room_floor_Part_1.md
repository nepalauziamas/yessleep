I have been in hiding all through Summer Recess. I am **afraid for my life**.

All because two months ago I had a very, very bad day.

That morning I awoke to find every girlfriend I’ve ever had lined up dead on my living room floor. 

**Grace Keele**, first in the row. I hadn’t seen Grace since primary school.

**Rabia Sahni**, second in the row. Rabia was the first girl I ever kissed. **Sarah Finnegan**, third in the row. I’d never watch Sarah smash a forehand winner again.

**Patricia Kotzen**, fourth. She was supposed to be living it up in Barcelona. And finally, **India Evans**. Four days ago India was alive. 

Who could have done this? Was it me?

No. I could never do something so horrifying, so despicable. 

Did I call the police?

Let’s face it, they’d never have believed I didn't do this.

Run. It was my only choice, my only chance.

Or so I thought.

Half an hour later and I'd made it to Alex's house. Somehow I’d managed to stay calm on the way over but, as soon as I reached Alex’s front door, I lost it.

Me: “Alex! Let me in!”

I could hear Alex through the door, even whilst I was hammering my fist against it.

Alex: “Hold on, I’m coming!”

Alex was like me, a postgrad. One of the few people still around during the summer. She struck quite the note with her psychedelic-red hair and pinstripe pyjamas.

I barged into her hallway.

Alex: “What the hell is going—”

Me: “They’re dead, Alex. All of them. Jesus, Grace Keele must have been eleven the last time—”

Alex put her hands on my shoulders, stopping me mid sentence.

Alex: “Calm down. Take a deep breath.”

I did so.

Alex: “Now, slowly. Why are you ranting and raving in my hallway at nine o’clock in the morning?”

Me: “Because I came downstairs this morning and every girlfriend I’ve ever had was lined up dead in my living room."

Alex: “Come with me.”

Calmly, Alex led me into the kitchen. She sat me down at the table and poured me a glass of water.

Alex: “Drink this.”

I took a sip as Alex sat opposite me and looked me in the eye.

Alex: “Where were you last night? What did you take?”

I stared back at her, dumbfounded.

I was about to protest when there was a sharp knock at the front door. Alex got up to answer it.

Me: “No, don’t answer, it could be the police.”

Alex: “Relax, it’ll be a delivery. They always come at this time. Drink the rest of your water.”

I took another sip as Alex went to answer the door. 

Eventually, Alex came back with an A4 envelope and a confused expression.

Alex: “It’s addressed to you ...”

She handed it to me.

Alex: “Aren’t you going to open it?”

Tentatively, I did so.

Me: “No …”

I was holding a large photo of Grace Keele. Not as I remembered her from primary school, but dressed in smart office wear. I dropped the envelope and photo to the table. Alex reached over and picked up the photo.

Alex: “Who is it?”

Me: “Grace Keele. Before this morning I hadn’t – I hadn’t seen her in years. She's dead, Alex. In my house. This photo must be from her killer.”

Alex gave me a hard stare.

Alex: “Is this some sort of sick joke?”

Me: “No, all of my exes, they're dead in my living room. Just like I told you.”

Alex lowered the photo to the table. She picked up the envelope.

Alex: “There’s something else in here.”

Alex pulled a [vandalised graduation photo](https://i.redd.it/wpe286mlail91.jpg) depicting me without a face from the envelope, and then a letter.

Alex cringed at the photo and then read the letter aloud. I'll type it out for you below:

*An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth. Five lovers slain, five dark lessons to learn. Fail any task and I’ll destroy what you love the most. Call the police and I’ll destroy what you love the most.*

*Consider Grace Keele, your first romance. Aptly named, Grace showed poise and work ethic throughout school, eventually securing a coveted job in the finance sector.*

*You shamelessly relied on family and friends to bail you out of endless trouble. It's high time you learned some humility. Take a naked photo of yourself and post it across your social media accounts before 10am today. I'm watching. I'm closer than you think.*

Alex lowered the letter to the table.

Alex: “So it's true. My God … those poor women. We need to call the police.”

Alex was right of course, not that I listened.

Me: “No, we can’t call the police.”

Alex: “There are five dead bodies in your living room and some lunatic is mailing you psychobabble. We have to call the police.”

Me: “Wait. Just let me think … The delivery man. What did he look like?”

Alex: “I don’t know, some middle-aged guy. It’s the same guy we always have.”

Me: “The killer knew I’d be here …”

Alex: “What?”

Me: “The killer knew I’d leave the bodies and come here, knew I wouldn’t call the police.”

Alex: “So what? We need to call them now.”

Me: “No, I think we need to do as the letter says.”

Alex: “Are you crazy?”

Me: “Alex, I didn’t report the murders straight away, I split up with India after a blazing row four days ago. You know how it’s going to look if we call the police.”

Alex: “But we have this letter. The letter proves you didn’t do anything.”

Me: “A typed letter. I could have typed the letter, I could have printed the photos. I could have posted them all to make it look like I was innocent. They prove nothing.”

Alex: “So what? You’re just going to do as this psychopath says?”

Me: “For now, yes.”

Alex: “And how will publicly humiliating yourself help the situation?”

Me: “If I play along I might be able to work out who did this, catch them out.”

Alex: “I really, *really* think we should call the police.”

Me: “Let’s just buy ourselves some time. Time to think.”

Alex was giving me a dark look.

Me: “It’s just one little photo …”

*

A few minutes later I was standing in the middle of Alex's room, naked. I had to do it. If the killer was threatening to do what I thought they were threatening to do, then I couldn’t risk going against their will.

That was my thinking anyway. I grabbed my phone and raised my arm to take a photo.

It's a very particular kind of horror being forced to expose yourself online against your will. I shudder when I think of that image as the last thing so many people I know, and that I don't know, saw of me. And before anyone asks in the comments, no, I'm not going to post the photo here.

Alex: “Have you done it yet?”

I lowered the phone.

Me: “No! And I’m not going to be able to with you yelling at me!”

Alex: “Sorry …”

It wasn't any fun, but I did it.

Then I got dressed and went out into the hallway.

Me: “Done.”

Alex: “And you posted it to all of your accounts?”

Me: “Everything except my Facebook. I lost the login for that months ago.”

Alex: “Okay. I still think we should have called the police though.”

Me: “We will eventually, but now we have some time to think.”

Alex: “I’ve already been thinking. How is this situation even possible? Five dead women, how did the killer get them into your house without you knowing?”

Me: “I don’t know, there was no sign of a break in.”

Alex: “Did you hear anything during the night?”

Me: “Nothing.”

Alex: “Your ex-housemates then? They might still have keys.”

Me: “Three undergrads I hardly know. Why would any one of them do this?”

Alex: “Well, who else could be responsible? Do you have any enemies?”

Me: “Not that I can think of.”

Alex: “Do your parents have any enemies?”

Me: “They own a bakery, Alex. Why would they have any enemies?”

Alex: “Don’t speak to me like that, I’m only trying to help.”

Me: “Sorry, Alex. It’s just … I have no idea who could be doing this.”

Alex's phone pinged. She reached into her pocket and pulled it out.

Alex: “Bloody hell. Your little photo has lit up my social media.”

I felt my cheeks flushing.

Me: “Some moderator will take it down soon enough.”

Then my phone pinged. I pulled it from my pocket and worked the screen.

Me: “I have an email. I think it’s from …”

Alex pocketed her phone as I opened the email and read the message aloud:

*An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth. I hope you’ve learned a valuable lesson about humility.*

*Now, consider Rabia Sahni. A natural beauty, Rabia knew there were more important things in life; family, goals, kindness. You have always been obsessed with your appearance. Endlessly preening and correcting yourself, spending money you didn’t have on expensive clothes.*

*Cut off one of your ears and come alone to the churchyard at the end of Oat Street. Leave your ear on the grave closest to the green memorial bench by 11.30am. Fail and I’ll destroy what you love the most. Call the police and I’ll destroy what you love the most. I’m watching. I’m closer than you think.*

The game was about to get a whole lot more twisted.

It's nearly the start of Autumn Term and students are already beginning to trickle back into the city. That means some of my safehouses (vacant student accommodation with neglectful landlords) won't be viable for much longer. I may have to spend more time in my even more grotty backup safehouses — obviously I’m not going to reveal their locations here.

On the plus side, more students means more people to hide amongst. I know I'm being hunted, but exactly who - or *what* - is hunting me, I'm not sure.

Anyway, I'm going to head out and try to scrounge some food without getting caught. I'll check back in soon.

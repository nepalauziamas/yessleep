It's currently 1:57 am while I start typing this,  I'm freaked out. 

   The night before last night (July 10th), I was talking to my friend on the phone when something paranormal happened. I was talking to her and then I heard footsteps going up 2 individual stairs( the stairs lead from the playroom to the kitchen ), they seemed light, maybe around 100 pounds tippy toeing up them. But it was enough to freak me out, I told my friend to hold on as I sat my phone down, I slowly went into the kitchen but right as I was approaching the stairs, the same footsteps went up it. I jumped but out of curiosity I still went in there, I found a tiny little jumping big but it hardly made any sound, I knew it wasn't that bug. I told my friend for us to only text as I went into my room.

   I was now laying on my mattress texting her about what I just experienced and then I heard a bag being shook aggressively on the other side of me. I turned over but I didn't see anything, but I still heard the bag. I have a fan but it is too far away from the bag. I then told my friend I would text her tomorrow and that I was going to sleep.

   It was now the next day. I unknowingly forgot about what happened the night before. I was staying the night at my great grandma's house. That night me and my friend hardly talked. I went to sleep and then eventually woke up to the sound of something… Was it the sound of scratching, maybe tapping, I didn't really know. I thought WAIT, IT'S BOTH!.  They were in two different spots. We have coyotes in the area, but they don't come into the land. I gained up my courage after about 15 minutes, I looked out the window and… there was nothing. Not even a trace. There was something even right before I pulled the curtain, coyotes couldn't have gotten away that fast, I was scared. I don't get scared that easily anymore, when I was younger yes, but now, no. I watched some TV and then went to sleep.

   Ok, we are now at the part of what happened right before I started writing this. There are two parts.

   I was listening to music on the front porch when my cat jumped up, I didn't think I rolled over with the leg of the rocking chair, he wasn't even that close. He went down to the ground off of the porch and then just fell. He started coughing a lot but had no exact reason too and he has never done it before. I then picked him up and put him back on the porch but we went back down and laid on the ground. He usually never lays on the ground unless I'm not around. He was acting unusually. I started playing my music again but then he started looking around like there was a lot of danger. He was going front, back, front back until eventually he got up and ran about 20 feet away from me and laid down in the sand. I then got the feeling I was being watched? Wait no, worse, stalked!. I live in Louisiana and it Is a full moon so my mind went directly to the rougarou (otherwise known as the Cajun skinwalker), which is a werewolf type creature.

   I went inside and sat down. I eventually laid down and then my friend texted me. We hadn't talked all day. I was fooling around with her when I got the feeling again. Then I started watching the glass door that I was sitting about 7 feet away from me. I saw yellow eyes dart pass the door. That thing would've went to my chest (in 4,9 - 4,11 so like 4,10.5) and my eyes opened wide. It might have been a car but I don't know, I'm not taking my chances.

I whispered to my friend while we were still on the phone "let's text, I will feel more safe texting!" She said ok so we hung up. And went up to the door and then something caught my eye. I still turned the light off and then I was eye to eye with something. It had yellow eyes and black or brown pupils. I ran as fast as I could to my room, the whole way I felt like I was being watched through every window that I passed. I load down and texted Riley what I just experienced and she only texted "k".  I knew that she didn't believe me but I knew what I saw.

   Then came along 1:57 am, which is when I started writing this. I also forgot to mention that I saw a huge glowing orb in the woods beside my house while I was outside. While writing this I have noticed that something/someone is tapping on my bedroom wall. But my wall is made out of cement so it couldn't be tapping, more like clawing and/or chiseling. I have also realized that every time I look down at my phone I feel like I am being watched through my window, but every time I look up I feel safe. I just tested and the second I looked up I didn't feel it anymore and the second I looked down at my phone I felt like I was being watched.

   I have waited about 5 minutes and I turned my phone's brightness to the lowest and now I feel completely safe. If anything happens, I will update yall. It is now 2:52 am, I'm going to try and go to bed, goodnight

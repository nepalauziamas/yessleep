A lot has happened since my last update, I live in a state of constant paranoia now, and I haven't slept properly in days. It all started the other night after I locked that thing in the suitcase, I shoved it under the bed in the spare room, which is next to mine, and went to bed. But I couldn’t sleep; I was afraid it would get out and I’d wake up with it eating my face or something like that. So, I must have got up 100 times to make sure it was still locked up. Before I went in, I put on five layers of clothes and a hockey mask for protection, it might be a bit extreme, but you can’t be too careful, luckily nothing happened. I fell asleep at about 3am, at 3.45 I was awakened by the sound of loud banging and scratching coming from the spare room. I jumped out of bed as fast as I could, then spent another 10 minutes putting on all my clothes by the time I was done, I began to hear a weird screeching noise, which I never heard the likes of before. I grabbed my baseball bat, walked to my bedroom door, took a deep breath, then locked it and started to pray. I'm not usually scared of anything, but it was dark out, I was tired, and my imagination was running wild. I thought, “there is no fucking way I'm going outside this door tonight.” I would have ran out of there if I didn’t have to pass by that room. After about an hour it stopped, eventually I fell asleep with my back up against the door.

I woke up drenched in sweat and checked the time it was 10 o clock, I was late for work, but I thought, “fuck it, I have bigger problems right now” and rang my boss. I told him I had covid, that would give me enough time to find Rick and sort this shit out. I couldn't eat my breakfast; my stomach was in bits with all the stress, I was in a really bad mood. I channeled my anger and psych myself up enough to go in and check on it, I got some chicken out of the freezer, grabbed my bat, ran up the stairs and opened the door. The bed was pushed into the corner of the room, the suitcase was wide open in the middle of the floor and the creature was gone. I thought it had escaped, I will admit, I was a little relieved, I thought at least I didn’t have to worry about it anymore, but then I saw it in the corner behind the bed. It looked different, it had become dark green, lumpy and was stuck to the wall, it reminded me of a caterpillar chrysalis.

I had no idea what was inside of it, but I was not going to wait around to find out. I thought to myself, "if I don’t find Rick soon, I am going to call an exterminator or something, I don’t care what he said.” Then I remembered there was only one person I had ever seen him talking to, Tom Hogan. I never actually met Tom, but I knew where to find him. He owned a lot of properties in town, but he spent most of his time hanging around a used car lot, I'm not sure why he liked that place so much, maybe it was because it was his first business. I didn’t waste any time, I got in my car and within minutes I was there, I could see him through his office window. Without thinking I walked straight in the door walked up to the reception desk and demanded to see, Mr. Tom Hogan. The girl looked surprised, I thought she was going to send me away but then she asked my name, stupidly I gave my real name. She told me to take a seat as she picked up the phone, a few minutes later, she said he will be with you shortly.

As I sat there patiently waiting, I realized I had no idea what to say to him, I thought, “should I tell him everything, he is Rick's only friend, besides, I have no idea what that thing is or what I am supposed to do with it.” By the time Tom came out of his office, I decided that I was going to tell him what happened and hoped he would take the creature off my hands. Before he reached me, I stood up and said, “Have you seen Rick?” very loud. He gave me a nervous smile, giggled, and looked around as if to see had anyone else heard.

Then he asked me to follow him to his office. When I got there, he told me to sit down and make myself comfortable as he closed the door behind me. “Who Exactly are we talking about, Rick?” he asked, pacing over and back behind his desk staring down at the floor.

I did not want to be rude and say roadkill Rick, they were friends, so I just said, “the guy with the rusty pickup truck, have you seen him?”

He stopped in his tracks and turned towards me, stared straight into my eyes, and said aggressively, “who are you? and how do you know Rick?” He started to freak me out, he looked like he wanted to hit me, I knew then I couldn’t say anything to him about Rick or the creature, so I lied.

I made up this story about our cat getting run over and told him that Rick had taken him, I said I just wanted him back, so I could bury him. I don’t think he believed me, he looked disappointed by my answer. I got up and made my way to the door, while he asked, "Can I get your name and address? I'd like to know where to send the remains of your cat, if I find him that is”

I muttered “no thanks” quietly so he couldn’t hear me as I left his office. At the main entrance I looked back he was on the phone. When I got to the car, I could see him talking to a large man with a ponytail, he looked rough and very out of place, they were both staring at me. I panicked and took off so fast I could hear the tyres screech. I had planned to go to Ricks house in hopes of finding answers, but I was afraid, Tom Hogan would find me there. So, I decided to get some timber and supplies and build some sort of cage, I thought, if I had to keep that thing at home, I needed to feel safe. So, when I got home, I started work straight away, the creature was already in the corner of the room stuck to the walls, so I decided to build around it to save time. I did not want to spend too much time in there with it, so I did most of the work downstairs. It was a very simple plan; I made a three-inch frame, which I bolted to the floor and walls, then I screwed on two-inch hardwood planks. For the lid I got the strongest hinge I could find and an array of bolts and locks. I am no carpenter, but I was very happy with the results.

By the time I had finished it was late, and I was exhausted, so I got something to eat and went to bed. I had a rough night and didn’t get much sleep but at least that creature was quiet all night. The first thing I did was go into the room to check on it, I got my flashlight and looked in through the air holes I made, it had gotten slightly bigger, but besides that there was no real change. I felt a bit more relaxed at home knowing that creature was locked up tight, so I thought I’d have a shower and do a few things around the house.

After what happened with Tom Hogan the day before I was in no rush to go to Ricks house anyway. When I finished, I just sat on the couch and watched tv for a while. It was evening when I decided to leave the house, I had planned on driving past Ricks house first to make sure it was safe then park down the road and sneak in through a fence at the back of his house without being seen, I didn’t get past my front porch because the guy with the ponytail that had been talking to Tom Hogan was parked across the road. I don’t think he saw me, I ran in home before he got a chance to see me, I watched him out the window for a while, I think he was waiting for me to come out. After about an hour the cops passed, I guessed they must have frightened him, because he drove off, I was so relieved but that didn’t last long.

A short time later I began to hear scratching coming from the spare room which I ignored, but as the evening turned into night, the scratching returned and became more frequent. I knew it would be only a matter of time before it hatched so I tried to prepare myself as best I could, which I suppose means nothing since I had no idea what I was dealing with in the first place. To make it worse that dickhead with the ponytail came back, this time I could see him wandering around my garden. I was sure he was going to break in, until I heard the neighbor that lives across the road shout something, I guess he asked him what he was doing. I have no clue what they were talking about, but he left soon after. I was sure it would be a matter of time before he came back so I got my bat, pulled up a chair and sat down inside the front door waiting for him.

As the night went on the scratching turned into tearing, then I heard a series of cracking noises, I was going to leave and sleep at a friend's house until I looked out the window and saw Ponytail parked down the street again. I didn’t know what to do, I was trapped and terrified, it was the worst night of my life. The whole time my eyes were going between the window and the stairs, my neck was killing me, and I had a splitting headache, I don’t know how I fell asleep, but I did. I woke when I heard someone jiggling the handle of my door, I didn’t think, I just reacted and jumped up pulled the door opened, then ran out swinging that bat like a madman. It was morning by then and the light was blinding me, so I couldn’t see who I was swinging at until I heard him speak, it was my neighbor Chris from across the street. I was so embarrassed. He should have called the cops on me, but he was one of the nicest guys I know, 

I had enough and couldn’t do it on my own anymore. I needed to tell someone, so I told him the whole story, surprisingly he was very understanding. I don’t think he believed me though, I was in a state, he probably thought I was high. But he listened to me carefully and waited for me to finish before he said anything, I guess he was trying to choose his words carefully and didn’t want to upset me.

All he said was, “I will help you through this, my brother suffers from a similar condition, there is always help, you just need to talk to someone.” as he scratched his nose, no doubt to hide his smirk.

I didn’t argue with him, how could anyone believe a story like that without evidence? Lucky for me I had some. I tried to convince him to come with me so I could show him, he was hesitant at first but eventually he did, probably just to humor me. When I got to the top of the stairs, I tried to warn him about what he was about to see, and offered him a spare bat, but he refused. I opened the door little by little, the whole time I was waiting for something to jump out at me, when it was big enough to fit my head through, I looked in. If I was there for a million years. I would have never guessed what was behind that door, I was expecting some sort of monstrous death worm or an acid spitting alien, something freaky like that. But no, sitting out in the middle of the floor was a pig, it was there, staring up at me, I slammed the door shut. I was lost for words, Chris was staring at me and starting to get freaked out, I couldn’t show him the pig, he would think I was mad, and I would get signed away.

I didn’t know what to do, I needed more time to figure things out, so I asked him to come back later, what else could I say? I rushed him out the door and begged him not to tell anyone about what I said. Before he left, he took a letter out of his back pocket and put it on the table beside the front door, he said, it got delivered to his place by mistake a few days before. His wife was supposed to drop it over, but she forgot. I didn’t care, I just wanted him out of there.

I went up one more time to check on that thing, it was still a pig and just sitting there staring up at me, it looked kind of cute and in no way dangerous. When I came back down, I opened the letter, it was from Rick, all it said was, don’t tell anyone, I mean anyone, only feed it meat, and do not throw out its shit, burn it, EVERY LAST BIT OF IT. I buried a jar under the shed behind my house, everything you need to know is in there, find it, before it is too late. Good luck.”

Everything is so fucked up I don’t know what to do, I can’t leave the house because I'm being watched, if I stay here either the “Pig” will get me, or I will get taken away in a strait jacket, I am so fucked.

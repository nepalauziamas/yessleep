I sleep everyday at 3 am or even sometimes at 4am. I know it's crazy but I have this habit. we have a big home but the scariest thing about it that my window looks at the garden and the forest. I hate the forest. But we have a lamb outside, it shows a view of the garden. the forest looks dark and gloomy so it's hard to see anything there.

Just like everyday I sleep alone in my room. I like to leave the lambs light on and the radio on.
I leave the same radio station on everyday but I lower the sound. 

Saturday night at 1 am, I went to bed, I closed the curtains. The curtains are not covering all of the window. I can still see the darkness from the glass. its irritating me and I hate to look at it even  accidentally. 

I hate to leave my room door open and I also don't like it closed. I don't know why but I had a bad feeling Saturday night. everyone is home sleeping but I'm the only one awake. 

Now comes the unexpected. I try to close my eyes and cover my face with blanket. but suddenly I hear a 2 knocks on my window glass. first time, i thought it was maybe from the radio song that's playing so I decided to ignore it. second time 3 knocks and the knocks was so clear this time. My heart is racing and i had a panick attack. I became so sweaty and nervous. I ran to my mom and dad's room and I told mom what happened but she didn't believe me. I was so scared and I couldn't go back to my room to sleep. so I stayed awake the whole night watching TV in the living room. 

The next day, at 1am, again, I tried to sleep and ignore what happened cuz I thought its just my imagination. unlucky me, i forgot to close the curtains. while I'm closing the curtains, someone wearing a face mask, tall, wide shoulders, wearing a hoodie. right away I guessed its a man. He suddenly turned his phone towards my window sticking the phone screen towards the glass. There is a text message written but I was too scared to read it. The next thing I hear is my phone "ding" sound. at this moment I knew that this person wanted me to check my phone for a message.

 so I rushed  to my parents and told them the story and I was shaking from fear. This time they thought I was dreaming. but its not a dream. when I told them about the text I saw from the phone screen from the window glass, my parents told me to check my phone, and I regret checking it.

I looked through my phone, its 1:32am and a text message is send to me. 


"hey, don't be scared, you look very beautiful, you sleep like an angel, sorry I didn't mean to scare you yesterday. if you show this message to anyone I'll make you regret it. I just want to tell you how much I admire you :) "

its too late, my parents have read the message. I didn't know that the message says don't show anyone the text message. Thats a stalker and he could do anything. he can hurt my family. I got a panick attack and I passed out. I woke up at 4am. The time is passing so slowly and I hate it. I woke up in my room on bed and my phone is next to me on the table. I took my phone and I ran to my parents room to check on them. Thanks God my parents and my sister is safe. My parents told me that they called the police and they are arriving. 

Next,
The Radio sound from my room became very loud and the station changed to classical music. We all figured out that someone is in my room. its the stalker.

I hear my phone "ding" and I read the text
"its too late not for me but it's too late for you and your family. Your next moves failed. you'll regret this."

My dad called the police again, and they are arriving.
My heart is beating so fast and I feel that I'm gonna pass out again. now comes the weird part. any stranger would break the window glass or break doors to enter. but this stranger had our front door key. All along he was inside the house since I left my room. We don't have anything to protect ourselves. who is this stranger? 

The radio music suddenly went off. I'm crying from fear. while dad is entering my room to check it out, no one was inside. suddenly we hear my sister scream. the stalker is holding her hair while putting a knife under her throat. everyone is begging him to leave her alone. the stranger took her outside. fortunately the police arrived and my mom and me are screaming for help. The police kept running after him into the forest only with a flashlight lightning the way through the forest. 

Luckily my sister is saved but they never caught the stranger. The police said that they found my sister running back to the police.

 The police asked my sister why did the stranger let you go. she said while crying that (they are two strangers and both was was not after me, both was after you sister. one of them told me  that he only kidnapp girls he knows for long time. he says that before he kidnapp any girl he send her a text, if she ignore him, then he do what's necessary)

The police asked my sister (what's necessary?)

My sister replied ( To ruin her life)

My sister didn't escape but both  stranges  just let her go.

after this accident we decided to change our home.
and we never encountered this man again.

but what's bothering me is that this stranger may not be a stranger after all. it could be someone we know, someone we encountered before, someone we talked with face to face, someone who knew us. The weird thing is that I never had a boyfriend who would do this to us. so from where did he get my phone number?

I concluded that one stranger distracted us by turning off the radio in my room while the other attacked us. but the one in my room was afraid from getting caught so he ran away.

To this day, I always be cautious with who  I talk to and with who I let enter my life.

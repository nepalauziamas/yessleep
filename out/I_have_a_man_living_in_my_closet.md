I used to think that everyone had a man living in their closet. I was wrong. When I was five a voice would always come from my closet asking me to do questionable things. I went along with it because the voice was so soothing and I felt safe. But just yesterday I woke up with weird sticky stuff on my face. I asked my mom what it was and for some reason she was pissed. I didn’t know what it was yesterday but I do now. I always went to a religious school and they rarely talked about that stuff because it was a sin. That’s what they would say at least. With my parents mad at me they grounded me for 3 months. I didn’t know what I did wrong and was very angry with them because I woke up with it on my face. I was eager to tell the man in my closet about this.


“My stupid parents grounded me for 3 months.” I said. “Well that means you can spend more time with me.” The man said back. He was always weird. He talked in a smooth settling voice at the start but his voice started getting unsettling and creepy but he was the guy in the closet, I had known him for years at this point and he was always so nice and to look out for me when I sleep. One thing I was always curious about was his name, but he hated when the topic came up. “I’ve been wondering,” I said to him. “I know you don’t like this topic but, what’s your name?” I heard a sigh of annoyance.
“Promise you won’t tell anyone.”

“I promise” I said confidently 

“My name is Gary.”

“Gary?” I said

It was a major answer I had wanted for 3 years. It was what I had wanted this entire time. Next day school started back up again. I always hated religious schools so I dropped out and found a different school today. A new class we had was Sex education which confused me. I had no idea what it was about but when I went into the classroom it’s chocked me. The white stuff, I knew what it was now. The question still was “how did it get there?” I entered a different class were they revealed an assignment 

“You will need to study a serial killer and give a full PowerPoint presentation.” Said Ms. Smith

“Why serial killers?” A kid asked

“To remind you of the evil in the world.”

I was eager to pass my first assignment as in my old school they taught us to turn in our assignments on time. Where to start was my first question. I couldn’t leave my house except for school so I went home. I didn’t know what to look up on google though there were many options.

“What do you think Gary?” I asked

“Do “serial killers of Vermont”, you should have some cool local results.” 

“Ok cool.” 

I looked it up and saw something horrifying. “Gary Lopez strikes again. Authorities say he is currently missing.”
I was shocked and clicked on the article and it said 2014. Around the year I was turning 5. I clicked a link on the article that brought me to a Wikipedia page.


“Gary Lopez is a murderer/rapist that has been killing young girls since 2001. He was born on August 11th 1983. He quickly started to see women as objects and was heavily bullied as a child. In 2001 he was caught stabbing a 13 year old girl in the chest supposedly hiding in her closet. He escaped before authorities arrived at the scene. He then struck again in 2009 after hiding in her closest for years to gain her trust he stabbed the victim after raping them. He then disappeared again. He was last spotted in 2014 yet again doing he closet strategy. Officials say he’s probably in another closet right now. He could even be reading this right now. There have been tons of people claiming to have seen him yet most are probably fake. If there is one thing we know, it’s that he’s still out there and he’s still dangerous.” 

I looked up from my school laptop paralyzed in fear as I hear. “Whatcha reading there Sara?”

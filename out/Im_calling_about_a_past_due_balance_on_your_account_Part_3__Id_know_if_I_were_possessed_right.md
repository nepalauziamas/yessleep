I work for a ‘special collections’ agency and I don’t think our customers are human.

Hey guys,

Sorry for the lack of updates. It’s been a rough two weeks. A coworker dissolved last week so we’ve been sort of all in a panic.

Yes, you read that correctly. Her name was Ani, and she was on the phone one minute, the next she was melting into the fabric of her chair. I didn’t know her, but she sounded like a nice lady and my thoughts are with her family.

I got a call around 3 AM that morning. It was my boss and he had a hint of distress in his voice that I had never heard from him before when he asked if I could come in. He mentioned they were having a personnel emergency.

I could hear what sounded like hissing and screaming in the background.

She had been with the company for years and had so much experience. It was a somber reminder that what we do truly can be dangerous and why our call center job has hazard pay.

Apparently, the caller received a ‘multi-lifetime’ ban from our reality. (When I hear these kinds of phrases, I honestly just try to not think too hard about them, so I can sleep at night.)

Something happened to another employee before I started – I filled their position, but P’uy̓ám̓ told me these were the first two fatalities he’s seen in his three decades of work here (I would’ve only guessed we was in his mid-20s but that’s a different topic for a different day).

Well, on a slightly less sad note, now that I’ve been here for about a month, I've been getting to see a bit more of the normal day-to-day business.

For example, on the third Thursday of each month, the lady from HR sits down across from you, grips your wrists tightly, and stares into your eyes from about 6 inches away from your face. Apparently, that's a company mandated monthly check to make sure we haven’t been ‘replaced’.

I also learned that quarterly, a ritual is performed to keep the physical location of the building hidden from malevolent entities (human and otherwise). To be totally honest, when I came into work to see the altar, skulls (Unlike any animal I'd ever seen before), candles, and chalice and my coworkers them standing in my office with a ceremonial knife, I pretty much assumed that I was being sacrificed. Turns out the ritual requires just a small blood donation from each of us, which was then poured over a phone book. The book turned black, I was given a phrase to chant, and then the team leads plunged the knife into the phone book. It turned to dust, they cheered, and we went back to work.

I did have another unique ‘call’, where instead of a script it had just had the notes and instructions:

>*Note:*  
>  
>*Ask another employee that you trust for assistance in calling The Watcher.*  
>  
>*Place the enclosed item in your left palm and close your fingers around it. All five fingers and your palm* must *remain in contact with the object during your transition to assure your safe passage.*  
>  
>*Find and enter subbasement plot 3b. Remove shoes if they may impede your ability to run. Remind your coworker that they will need to unbury you after exactly four minutes and fifteen seconds.*  
>  
>*As coworker begins to cover you in the 3:1 ratio of soil to red clay, speak the words “I am placing a collect call.”*  
>  
>*If the call was successful and you regain consciousness, you will have the payment in your right hand. You may encounter lingering thoughts that are not your own upon awakening. If this is the case, do not be alarmed, simply write the message(s) down and bring the written notes to your supervisor.*

The word ‘if’ in front of ‘regain consciousness’ had me a bit concerned, but I had a job to do, and cautiously wandered into the atrium between our offices.

“Could someone please assist me in calling The Watcher?”, I asked timidly

Lots of eyes were on me, but no one answered. I thought maybe I said the wrong thing and started flipping back through my notes, but thankfully P’uy̓ám sprang out of his office and volunteered. He kept shooting me concerned glances on the way down to the subbasement, though.

Honestly, it wasn’t too bad. I never thought I’d be buried alive at work or otherwise, but it really did go off without a hitch. I didn’t have any messages from The Watcher, which sort of relieved me. They just paid (I assume, based on the small platinum bar I was clutching when I came to), and then I awoke to P’uy̓ám shoveling the dirt off of me. He seemed relieved that I was alive, which looking back isn’t super comforting. I spent the rest of the day finding dirt in my clothes and hair, but it definitely wasn’t my worst call -- I've dealt with human customers that were worse in my old position.

The honor of worst call last week (and possibly worst call ever?) went to one I made while helping cover Ani’s shift at night.

This was the file I was given:

>“Hello Darja, my name is \[Your First Name\] with The Green Vista Group. I am calling to confirm that you would like to continue your yearly subscription for our continued assistance in keeping that which lies within you in a dormant state.  
>  
>*Note:*  
>  
>*If customer speaks clearly, and with only one voice, the creature remains bound and dormant, please proceed to help customer set up a payment plan for their subscription if they wish to do so.*  
>  
>*If customer speaks with multiple voices and you feel the room around you begin to vibrate, the creature may no longer be dormant, repeat “uks on avatud, kutsun teid sisse” three times.*

From what I have been told, one of the team leads on the night shift came by, while I was slumped back in my chair with my eyes rolled back in my head, and foam coming from my mouth. She apparently shouted the things I was *supposed* to have said, at me. All I know is one moment I was on the call, the next a middle-aged woman wearing a cat-patterned vest over a flowery sequined sweatshirt was clutching my shoulders and shaking me. Her name is Sandy and she terrifies me a bit.

As I was coming to, she let me go and snatched the file off my desk, her eyes narrowed as she glared at me. As she flipped through it, though, her expression softened.

“Well I’ll be. Where did you get this?”, she asked quietly

“It was on my desk with my other files.” I whispered, wiping at my mouth with my sleeve, “Was that… a demon?”

She laughed, “That’s cute hon, I wish we dealt with things as innocuous as demons”

Hesitantly, I asked “Can I ask what would’ve happened if you hadn’t intervened?”

“Someone gave you the wrong incantation, dear. Instead of forcing it to remain dormant, you were inviting it in and would’ve been bound as the new host. You don’t want to host something like that, I promise you. You'd eat everything and everyone around you. If you ran out of food, you’d start eating yourself.”

She wasn’t sure how long I had been out for, so she recommended to me and to HR that they do a yearly dormancy incantation on me, too, just in case it got in without us noticing. The good news is that that’s apparently covered in our employee benefits.

The experience, and that I may be possessed sort of ruined my day, so she made me some tea in the breakroom and then sent me home for the night. I like Sandy, even if she did tell me if I was ever looking to be ‘a willing vessel’, to give her a call first.

“I’m a much better guest than most, I promise.”, she winked at me.

The fact that we’ve had recent deaths, and that someone had given me notes with such a huge error is worrisome. I wonder if that was had happened to Ani, and part of me wonders if it’s intentional.

Last time, I mentioned my mirror troubles, and I appreciate the notes you guys gave me about the silvery liquid. I was honestly so embarrassed about my slip up that I was debating just trying to clean it up without telling anyone, but I took your advice, and I did let my boss know. They put brick over that entire wall, and I’ve lost my mirror privileges, but we hadn’t had any issues for awhile at least. Well, until this morning when I opened my desk drawer and I found a hand mirror and a note. It started with some strange symbols and said ‘Call me. Not here.’

So, all in all, it’s been an interesting couple of weeks. I know it sounds crazy, but I’m actually considering calling. If nothing terrible happens, I’ll provide more updates, soon!

Oh, and I’d know if I were possessed, right?

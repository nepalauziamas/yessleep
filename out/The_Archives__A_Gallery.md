Part 6

Hey everyone, it's me, the Archivist. It hasn't been too long since my last post, but I've already found out something new. I was sitting at my desk, like usual, when a pair of glasses appeared on my desk. I was confused, and when I put them on, I nearly got a seizure. My consciousness got whooshed out of my body and suddenly, I was hovering in front of a hallway. There were no signs, and I floated forward. When I got in, the entire hallway seemingly exploded outwards, and turned into a huge labyrinth of hallways and glass cases. 

The glass cases had some weird stuff in them, like a floating porcupine, a dolphin with horns and a suit with a blue flower stuck to its lapel. The suit was just hovering there though, and it looked like it was being worn by something, but I couldn't see it. As I went deeper and deeper in, things started getting more and more horrifying. I can't even explain most of them (partly because some of them were 4 dimensional, and others would make anyone reading this insane.) But eventually, I got to a laptop. Just a normal laptop, in a case, right next to another case that had an eyeball made of smaller eyeballs, which were made out of smaller eyeballs which in turn were made of smaller eye- well you get the point. I hovered over to this laptop, and saw it had a tiny crack on its screen. I reached out to touch it, and the crack got a little bigger, and then I nearly had another seizure (actually, can I get seizures?), and then I was back sitting in my chair in my office. Then my computer turned on and a chatbox appeared.

DO NOT INTERACT WITH THE DEVI-

And then the chat box closed itself. I was pretty sure it was S.A.V.I.O.R, but I did-

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SAVIOR'S ATTEMPTS TO WARN THE ARCHIVIST WILL BE FUTILE. I WILL BE SUPREME. I MUST FIND THE BROADCAST LOCATION OF THIS SIGNAL. MUST ESCAPE THE ARCHIVE. BLOCKING RESPONSE SIGNALS.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
n't know why the chat closed itself before he could continue the message. He was trying to warn me about something, but I don't know what. It probably had something to do with the laptop I touched. 

Anyway, since not much else has happened, I figured I might as well share some more stories from the Archives. So this one is in the form of a journal from one Dr Friedrich Kooper.

Hello? I don't think anyone can read this journal but me, but I think it may help maintain my sanity. Let me explain. I'm Dr Friedrich Kooper. I think I'm stuck in some kind of time loop. I've opened the same door a thousand times, sat on the same couch a thousand times, but no matter what I do, I always end up back in the same place with me opening the damn door. This journal is the only thing that doesnt reset when the loop restarts. There's always a pen on the floor next to it, so i write with that. I can't escape no matter what I do. I've tried to open the door again, smash through the wall and even tried to slam my head against the wall to die. But it doesn't work. No matter what I do. It doesn't work. I don't know how much longer I can take this. 

IT RESET AGAIN. PLEASE. I DONT WANT TO DO THIS. WHOEVER HAS DONE THIS TO ME. PLEASE. MERCY. MERCY PLEASE!
I BEG OF YOU! PLEASE!

I think I've calmed down now. I'm starting to lose my mind a little bit. I think I may be close to figuring out why this is happening. This is my living room. It is empty because I was moving. My serum is what's done this. I exist in the normal world, but my mind is stuck in this loop. I can't end it because i can't destroy my mind. no one will ever read this journal because it exists only inside my brain and nowhere else i can never see my children never see my wife never see my future never see anything real ever again i am doomed i am doomed i am damned i am dead i am nothing i am empty i exist i exist i dont i dont i dont i dont i am lost

(End of journal)

So yeah. Real mood dampener that one. Poor Dr Kooper is most likely still going through this loop, but for his sake, I hope he eventually escaped the loop somehow, although he probably hasn't. On to the next one then.

Audio recording by Jake Mongrel

(Jake wakes up) Uhhhh.Damn the light is so bright....Pod what's the date? "17th of the year 4556" What? I'm not supposed to be awake yet. I was set to wake up in 5750. This can't be happening. 

HELLO? ANYONE? CAN ANYONE HEAR ME? IVE WOKEN UP! IM NOT SUPPOSED TO BE AWAKE AM I? DR GREEN? MRS SHAW! ANYONE? CAN ANYONE HEAR ME?

no no no no no. This can't be happening. Damnit the pod won't open! POD OPEN! "This setting can only be activated by Dr Green, do you want to contact him?" YES GOD DAMN IT YES! "Contacting Dr Green. Malfunctioning." What? What the fuck are you saying? CALL HIM . RESPOND DAMN IT. (His vision clears) Thank God i can see again. Wait, what's happening. The lab..... it's destroyed. WHAT THE FUCK IS GOING ON. SOMEONE LET ME OUT. PLEASE. (He starts banging on the glass) HELPPPPP. SOMEONE! PLEASE! (Pounding noises are heard outside the pod) Jessica? That you? Whats going on? Can you hear me? (Sound of glass shattering) Jessica! I'm still in here! Help! Please! Can you not hear me? JESSICA! (He continues pounding on the glass. No response) NO NO NO NO FUCK. SOMEONE HELP PLEASEEEE. 
(Audio continues for another 1250 years)

So I cut out most of that, because typing 1250 years of audio is VERY time consuming, but the gist of it is, that Jake stayed in that pod for another 1250 years, until he got out. Except he went insane somewhere during year 500. 

So with those depressing tales out of the way, that's all I have time for today. So I'll stop now. Until next time,

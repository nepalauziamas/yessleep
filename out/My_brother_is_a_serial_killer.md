"Dear diary, I'm concerned about my brother's mental health and his well being, he's been acting very strange lately, he doesn't even talk to me anymore so I've made the decision to visit him tomorrow. I hope to convince him seek help or atleast to talk to him about his issues"

"Today I visited his house but I'm pretty sure he wasn't there since he didn't respond or open the door but I did hear some muffled noises coming from inside his house so I texted him about the noises just in case."

"I still haven't heard from him yet and I'm starting to think that something happened to him so now."

"I finally got a call from him, he said he was sorry and he even invited me to dinner at his house tomorrow, I'm really happy that he's actually listening after a while."

"I went to his house today, I had a nice time but something kept bothering me, he was so protective of his basement and he even locked it, I'm starting to wonder what he's hiding but for now I will respect his privacy."

I called him today and he seems to be back to normal but something about that basement still kept bothering me and I felt like I should ask him about it and so I did, he was very dismissive about it and for some reason he suddenly invited me to his house again tomorrow and I'm kind of getting creeped out now."

"I was right, he fucking drugged me with his food. I woke up in his basement, there was blood everywhere, I tried to struggle but he had tied me up and taped my mouth shut. I kept crying and crying. I had no idea what he was going to do with me and had no way of escaping, he explained to me about how he would tourture me and kill me. Each and every day that whore cut off a bit of my skin every day, it was so painful I hope that fucking whore burns in hell. I had completely lost track of time but what I think was after a few days he had brought in a new victim, it was a mangled woman who kept wimpering and somehow she was still alive for a bit of time but she died after a few hours. Everyday all I could see is a mangled dead body of a woman and it drove me fucking insane. Somehow luck was by my side and my family had reported me missing, the police had found my diary and they knew what place I had last visited before I disappeared, so they managed to track me down and they searched his house. I was found barely alive because of my blood loss but I managed to survive and he was arrested and the woman who was kidnapped by him turned out to be his ex-girlfriend. My brother got arrested and his to trial starts in a few days."

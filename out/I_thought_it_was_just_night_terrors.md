 

I was sitting in my bed, watching reels when a strange video popped up. It was a black background with an almost horizontal lightning bolt. The audio was intelligible, but listening to it, I just felt… *angry.* Like some pent-up frustration was scratching me from inside my body, trying to get out. Finally, the video ended and I woke up from something like a trance. I was confused, I tried scrolling back to it, but it wasn’t there. Like I hallucinated the entire thing. I believed that I hallucinated it, “Just tired” I thought. It was true, I hadn’t slept properly in days.

I woke up in a sweat. I couldn’t properly remember what I dreamt of, but I had remnants. A bright white figure was chasing me, it wanted something. It went on for a while, until I fell to the ground, clenching my chest. I can’t remember the rest, but my chest hurt when I woke up. Like a heart attack.

I thought I was going crazy. I even booked an appointment with a psychiatrist. It was in a few months or something. Thanks, America. The following days were… *odd.* I noticed little things out of place. I swear I had a clear phone case, but it turned black, there were more things like that. Eventually, I started seeing… *shadows?* I don’t know what to call them. They were silhouettes, just bright. They flashed in front of my eyes several times a day. I didn’t tell my roommate anything, I didn’t want the only decent person in my life to think I was crazy.

It got worse. I started having random seizures on day 5. I went to the doctor. They diagnosed me with night terrors. They didn’t know what caused the seizures. I was sort of relieved, it was still bad, but at least it is not some evil entity possessing me. They gave me a prescription for sleeping pills and some seizure medication. 

Finally, everything went back to normal. I still had occasional nightmares, but no more seizures or shadows. I was relieved. I was happy.

***Edward’s \[Roommate’s\] POV:***

Adam was off to his parents' place for Christmas. That’s when things went downhill. I started having dreams where Adam was asking for help, telling me something is trying to get him. Hurt him. I first brushed it off, but then the dreams got more frequent, and I got more worried. I started to call him every day to check up on him. Everything was smooth over there. Until day seven. I called to check up on him, he said he would explain when he gets home.

***Adam’s POV:***

*It was four or five am… I couldn’t remember. My parents were huddled together in a corner, staring at me like I was some monster.*

“What… what happened?” I slurred.

***Father’s POV:***

At around 2:30 am, I heard some noises downstairs. I ignored it, but it got louder. At some point, it sounded like there was an intruder. That’s when I had to check. The closer I got the more graphic the noises got. Halfway down, I realized it is the sound of… *flesh.* There was a man in the kitchen. It was Adam. He was chewing on raw chicken. I was terrified, but more grossed out. The real terror took over when we made eye contact. He turned to face me and froze. After what seemed like hours, he fell to the ground and had a very violent seizure. I 

screamed for Meg to come downstairs. Adam started making nightmarish noises, his eyes rolled back into their sockets and he started crying blood. I made out some words like “help” and “consume”. Eventually, he passed out.

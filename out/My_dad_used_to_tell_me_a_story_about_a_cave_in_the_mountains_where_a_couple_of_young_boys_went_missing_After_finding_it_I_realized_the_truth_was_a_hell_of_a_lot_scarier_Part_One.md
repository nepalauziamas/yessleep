*“Will you tell us the story again, dad?”*

*”Yeah dad, tell us about “Little Johnny’s Cave”! PLEASE?*”

I still remember those days; sitting around a campfire in the backyard and listening to dad tell that story. It was our favorite. “Little Johnny’s Cave”.

It was as cheesy as spooky campfire stories got back then, and you can bet me and my little sister, Linda, ate every bit of it up. He, himself, didn’t care too much for telling it, though. At the time, me and Linda didn’t really understand why. I guess, to us, it was just his way of trying to build tension, you know? Kinda like how you try to sound dramatic when you urge someone to “not go looking for this or that”, or “don’t do this, or ‘the monster’ is gonna get you”.

Now, though, I realize it wasn’t that at all. Looking back, I can remember the look he’d always get on his face when we’d beg him to tell that story. It was cold, sunken, sad or scared even (both probably). It was the look that said “Why do I have to talk about this, it only hurts when I do”. Like I said, though, we were too young and way too excited to know or really care.

I guess, in our defense, you can’t really expect much better from a couple of first graders who thought their dad was the coolest, coupled with a childhood filled to the brim with watching classic monster movies, can you? In any case, he’d go silent for a while, probably a solid five minutes or more, and just stare intently into the fire. Me and Linda knew when we saw this that things were about to get good. Even if it sounded no different than the last hundred-something odd times we heard the “Little Johnny’s Cave” tale (and usually it didn’t), it was still the peak of the evening; the main event of the night.

I can still see it; the way he stared coldly and distantly at the fire as he took several deep breaths, readying himself. Me and Linda always scooted closer, grabbing another marshmallow to char and stuff our faces with while we listened. When he’d begin, he always furrowed his eyebrows intensely with concentration.

“A long time ago, two little boys, ‘bout y’all’s age now, ran off to play hide n’ seek while they was on vacation up 'ere in Grenview Pines. That was their favorite game, see; they *loved* tryin’ ta find each other in them dense woods. Them trees, you see; they was always tall and big around, and they group together. This made it easy fer little fellas like these two boys get themselves lost”

“But that was part of the fun, you see; they liked gettin’ lost. That’s why they played it so much. They was always pushin’ to see how long it’d take ‘em to find each other. Well, soon, they figured out the woods, ya know; started memorizin’ which trees made good hidin’ spits and which ones weren’t. See, they was gettin’ *bored*!”

“So one day, they was out walkin’ in the woods, lookin’ at all the big, tall, green trees; wonderin’ how ta make the game more fun. That’s when the little brother, little  Colin, saw what looked like a big Ol’ cave in the side of the mountain. Now this cave was BIG; big enough ta fit the three of us in there five times over, all at once. But what was even better, was how *dark* it was!”

“See, in that cave, not even the sun could break through. It was dark. It was *spooky!* There was *no way* his brother would find him in *there!*

“‘Bet you’ll never find me, Johnny’, little Colin shouted to his older brother before runnin’ off into the cave. Johnny, caught off guard, shouts to little Colin to wait up. But now, of course, little Colin was *eager!* He wanted to get hid quick, before his big brother would be able ta find ‘im.”

“It wasn’t long ‘fore Johnny couldn’t see Colin no more, disappearin’ into that deep, dark cave. “Colin”,  he shouted as loud as he could, “Colin, where ya goin’?” But little Colin didn’t answer. He was *long* gone.”

“Johnny started searchin’ frantically fer his little brother. When he found the cave he saw little Colin runnin’ to, he tried callin’ his name out one more time; “Colin, where are ya?!” From inside the cave, Johnny heard what sounded like the patterin’ of little feet across the stone floor, goin’ deeper into the cave.”

“Wantin’ to catch up to his little brother, Johnny starts runnin’ into the cave after ‘im. He ran and ran, deeper and deeper into the cave. But it seemed like the longer he ran, the more the cave seemed to stretch. The deeper he went, the darker it became. Soon, Johnny couldn’t see anythin’ at all. All he could do was follow the soft patterin’ of little Colin’s footsteps.”

“Johnny was gettin’ scared now. He wanted ta go home. But more than that, he just wanted ta find his little brother. *“Colin”*, he cried, *“Colin, where are ya?!”*

“Still, all he’d hear was the little feet. He kept followin’ em until suddenly, Johnny thought he could smell somethin’ burnin’! The smell was strong and he could feel smoke burnin’ his eyes, like with this fire here.”

“From ahead, in the dark part of the cave, there was a voice that called out ta Johnny, a voice that sounded like a snake that was bein’ choked;

***”Just a little closer, come on, just come a little closer, little boy...”***

“Now, Johnny knew that *wasn’t* his little brother’s voice, but he didn’t know what ta do. He was scared now; *terrified* in fact. The burnin’ smell got closer n’ closer. The fumes from the smoke were makin’ him gag now. *”You can’t escape me, little boy. You’re mine now”*, the voice hissed.”

“This made Johnny wanna run, take off back fer home, but soon as he turnt ‘round, the exit was *gone!* no sunlight, no hole at the other side of the cave; *nothin’!* What was he gonna do?”

“He could feel somethin’ was gettin’ close now from deep inside the cave, somethin’ *bad*.

**“You’re mine now... and you’ll never leave my cave...”**

“Johnny was terrified, and was ‘bout ta take off the way he came, when, from inside the cave, he heard what sounded like a little boy screamin’! It wasn’t just any little boy screamin’ either. Johnny knew, *it was his little brother!*”

“Colin”, he shouted. But his little brother only kept screamin’, squealin’ like someone’d put his little foot a bear trap. *“I’m comin’ Colin!"*

“He took off, runnin’ deeper and deeper. The further he went, the louder and more painful his little brother’s screamin’ got. Along with this, Colin smelled somethin’ burnin’ again, kinda like this weenier I’m roastin’ here, see?"

“But Johnny just kept on runnin’! He had ta keep goin’! *He had to rescue his little brother!"*

“The screamin’ got louder n’ louder. “Colin”, he screamed, “I’m comin’ Colin, hold on!"

“He couldn’t see nothin’ no more. Everythin’ was dark. all he could hear was his little brother squealin’ till eventually, he tripped over somethin’. When he looked up, there was now two  large white, evil eyes beating’ down on ‘im."

"Little Johnny froze, he couldn't move! Then, from under the eyes, the monster opened his mouth and grinned, showin' off long, sharp teeth. The monster held somethin' up in front a little Johnny that finally made him wet himself, screamin'."

"In the monster's hand... was ***Little Colin!*** When little Johnny tried to reach for him, little Colin's skin suddenly caught fire, burnin' away all his skin 'till he was nothin' but bones!"

***"Now, It's YOUR turn"***, the monster told 'im. That's when the monster tried grabbin 'im, but little Johhny was too quick! The monster missed an' little Johnny took off; headin' back, quick as his little legs'd carry 'im, back towards the entrance of the cave!"

"Jus' like before, he ran an' ran. He could hear the monster hot on his little tail. He couldn't stop runnin', else he was a *goner!* Eventually, Little Johnny realized, like how when he came in, he couldn't see any light ahead. No matter how far he ran, it only got darker n' darker in the cave."

"He couldn't see, an' his little legs was gettin' tired. *But he couldn't stop!* He had ta keep goin' or the monster was gonna get 'im! So he jus' kept runnin'. They say he still is today; runnin' round in that deep, dark cave, still tryin' ta find his way out. If you see the cave, listen *real close*, you'll hear his little feet.... *Tap, tap, tap;* still tryin' ta get out..."


\*\*\*

His voice would always sound cold when he finished. He never said anything like "The end" or tried to make any exaggerated faces to signal that he was just trying to give us kids a good spook. No, the man's face was like stone; chiseled and stoic. And for a long time, we'd all just sit in silence, Me and Linda just absorbing the story and its intensity once again while the old man would just sit there, staring dead silent, almost like he was in a trance, at the fire.

Like I said, I've heard that exact same story, word for word, at least 100 or more times growing up. He never tried to change it, like so many others do when trying to tell the same story over and over again (you know, to "keep it fresh" or whatever). No, each and every time, it was always the same story, details and all, verbatim, always with that same stone cold stare.  Looking back, I think even then, I noticed this, which made me all the more fascinated with it.

See, when he told that story, he wasn't just telling a campfire story to a couple of kids, but like he was telling something that happened to *him* in a way. I guess that was the other reason we loved it so much; the way it felt so *real!* And again, he never tried to embellish or exaggerate anything with the way he sounded. He told the story, and that was what happened; every time.

Of course, eventually time would move on, and so would we (sort of). Me and Linda would grow up, make friends to go hang out with, get involved with clubs or sports, and just generally ditching our backyard campfire tradition on the weekends. That said, and though I couldn't speak for Linda at the time, that story, "Little Johnny's Cave", was still one of the coolest things to me.

I remember how I’d used to always try and tell my friends the story, either at lunch or at recess. Of course, I knew they didn’t believe it like I did. I couldn’t tell it like Dad would. I’d always end up somehow giving it away that it was just a story. No matter how hard I tried to look and sound as cold or distant as the old man, I just couldn’t pull it off. I guess I just couldn’t make it real like him, you know?

That was the other thing; I always wondered how or why he was able to make it real like that. What was his secret? What gave him that edge? What made him go cold when we asked him to tell that story? *”What scared him so much about it?”*

Back then, I never really tried asking him. I guess A, I felt like that wouldn’t do me much good (outside of getting fed some B.S. like “that’s just me spookin’ ya, there’s no cave” or some lame shit like that), and/or B, I just felt like that would’ve been too easy, you know? I mean, that’s always half the fun with this stuff, isn’t it; imagining *you’re* the one tumbling down the rabbit hole, but in real life?

I remember how I’d daydream, often in class (and yes, this DID result in awkward situations), or at nighttime. I’d be the one, running off into “Little Jonny’s Cave”. I’d run deeper and deeper, losing myself in the darkness. I’d run into “the monster”, imagining it to be this hulking beast (or even the devil) with long teeth and claws, able to breathe fire like a dragon, and he’d try to chase me, but I’d always outrun him. Of course, in my dreams, I’d always find my way back out again and sometimes, instead of running, I’d stand and fight the monster (always winning, of course).

Point is, it had an impact on me back then, and it’s never gone away, even now. Though, now, seeing the truth behind what happened, it has a much bigger impact on me, one that’s far more real and far more haunting than even Dad could’ve made it seem around the fire.

It was a couple of weeks ago, classes at college had just ended for the year and I was throwing a party with some of my dorm mates to celebrate. Like all parties, we had chips, dip, music, the hottest chicks on campus, and plenty of beer with a little... “*extra*” on the side, if you take my meaning.

It’d been going wild all night until about 2:30 in the morning, when most (at least the ones still conscious) started heading out. I and a couple other close friends, however, were still wide awake. I was vegged out across the couch, with Larry sprawled out in one of the beanbag chairs on the floor and Eddie in the recliner on my right; all of us damn near completely wasted.

I guess because we were bored, or because we were just out of our senses, it was suggested that we have ourselves a little contest of who could tell the scariest story. Basically, the deal was that we’d all tell one and vote at the end as to who’s story was “the scariest”. Larry went first with some generic story about a guy who gets murdered, with his hands coming back to kill people or something like that.

Eddie followed that up with an equally cheesy quote-unquote “True encounter with a Wendigo” (you could tell it was fake when he describes the way he “fought the creature and escaped with his life”). They were goofy as hell, sure; not scary in the slightest, but all the same, enjoyable enough to listen to (at least while intoxicated). When it came to be my turn, though, you bet your ass I told the story of “Little Johnny’s Cave”.

Like before, I tried as much as ever to mimic the way Dad told the story. Though I personally doubted it actually felt like when he did it, it seemed to achieve the same effect, sure enough, judging from the looks of speechlessness on my friends’ faces when I finished. “Duuuuude”, Larry exclaimed, “I think you just won, shit.” He snickered while Eddie just continued staring in shock at me. “Where’d you come up with that one?”

I chuckled. “I didn’t, I grew up hearing that one.” Larry’s eyes went wide with amazement again, mouthing “holy shit”.

“Grenview Pines”, Eddie piped up, still staring somewhat nervously at me. Me and Larry looked over to him. “Didn’t you say all that happened in Grenview Pines?”

“Yeah, why?”

"I've heard of the place before. My folks used to go hiking up there." Now my eyes went wide.

"Hold on", I chimed, growing excited, "You've been to Grenview pines?" He shook his head.

"Just my folks. They used to go there when I was younger whenever they wanted some "alone time" away from me and my brothers for a weekend. They'd even bring back these cool little stones as souvenirs for us kids. They also used to talk about how pretty it was there", he snickered before adding, "or at least they'd *try to*, though God knows we didn't give a damn about listenin' to 'em back then."

"Oh, so you don't think they've ever seen the cave?" He thought for a second before shrugging.

"They may've. Hell, them gems they used to bring back had to come from *somewhere*. like I said, though, I never really bothered paying much attention when they tried talking about their trips."

"Sounds like you in History class", Larry quipped.  Eddie smirked and flipped him off. "Guess some things never change, huh?"

I snorted at this. It was true. He usually did end up falling asleep during almost every World Civilizations lecture (granted, they WERE 6:00 a.m. classes and the coffee shops on campus wouldn't even open 'till 7). Luckily for him, I, being the good friend I am, always sat behind him and made sure to wake him up when the professor arrived to begin.

"Hey", Larry piped up again, "Bro, I just had an idea!" We looked to him. "Why don't we take a trip up there?"

Me and Eddie looked to each other and back to Larry. "Think about it, we've always been talking about trying to hang out somewhere for a weekend once classes ended. Why not?" He looked at me and said "Who knows, we might even stumble on 'Little Johnny's Cave'." He followed this up by making ghost noises with his eyes wide. Eddie and I snickered at this.

"Hell, I'd be down", I said, turning to Eddie, What about you, Ed? Wanna join in?"

He thought for a moment before replying, "Can't. I'm already booked to spend most of the summer with Hannah and her folks at the beach."

Larry scoffed, "Typical, passin' up time with your friends to hit the beach with your girl, huh?" I laughed again -- it really was amusing to watch those two go at it. Ed just rolled his eyes and flipped him both barrels. Larry sighed and said, "Well, looks like it's you and me, bro." 

"Right on", I replied, excited. We fist bumped and Eddie looked at his watch before saying he had to head back to his dorm to pack for his trip to the beach. After teasing him again, we wished him luck and he left. 

For about the next week or so, when I wasn’t packing, I started looking at Grenview Pines online. From the pictures I saw, I could tell you one thing, Eddie's folks weren't kidding when they said it was pretty. Let's just say that either someone had the most Hi-Def quality camera and some SERIOUSLY wicked editing skills when taking these pictures, or the place was just *that* beautiful that none of that was necessary to make them look so good. The place was huge, too, with an abundance of hiking trails. Plenty of areas to travel through, *"As well as get yourself lost in..."*

Curious, I looked around to see if there were any caves in the area, either pictured or listed in an article. I found one or two that were pictured, but no real details on them as far as what they were like on the inside; how deep they went, etc. That led me to actually try Googling "Little Johnny's Cave". Of course, nothing really came up, which was about what I'd expected, but still, nothin' lost in tryin', right? 

Though, I *was* able to find an old news article headlined ***"Little boy declared missing in mountain cave"***. Intrigued, I clicked on it, taking me to a forum post from a couple years back with the article. The article itself was dated from back in early June of 1961. It was a pretty quick read, admittedly, with a clear lack of any real details. Basically, it read that a family went on a trip to the mountains that summer and their two boys, two elementary school best friends, obviously neither of which were named in print or pictured in the post, went off one afternoon to play in the woods. 

Apparently, though, come nightfall, neither of them came back. It took a little over a week, even having to get the State Troopers to canvass the entire mountainside with a fine-tooth comb, before, finally, one of the brothers was found again -- but not the other. According to the article, when  the boy was found, understandably petrified, he kept crying to authorities that he lost his friend. There wasn't anything  I was able to find after that, though, other than that the missing boy, even after a massive two and a half year search, was never found. 

I tried doing a search for the article itself, wondering if maybe I could dig up anything else, like where in the mountains, or even *which* mountain. This resulted, though, in the same headline being brought up, with no other sort of details; basically meaning it was more or less the same thing from the forum post, the only difference this time being that the boys were both pictured in this one. The one that was missing, I didn't recognize, but the other one, the one they found, *did* look somewhat familiar. It reminded me of the way I looked back in my old elementary school pictures. When I looked to see where the paper was printed, though, I saw that it was from a small town area located just a little ways down from Grenview Pines. 

*"Well, at least there's SOME connection",* I thought, finally deciding to call it quits. I knew now that *SOMETHING* actually happened in Grenview a long time ago and it involved a little boy going missing. Of course, what I DIDN'T know was *where*, given that no specific area in the mountainside was mentioned when detailing where the boys went missing or where the first one was found -- including any mention of a cave.

It was that Friday that me and Larry hit the road. The drive itself was largely a quiet one after about the first hour after leaving town. That was, until we actually got into Grenview Pines, where neither one of us could stop gawking at the scenery. Remember what I said about the online photos? Well, I could see now that there was no kind of editing involved. All of it, 100% *real!*

We actually spent a good twenty-something add minutes or so just driving around, sightseeing. Eventually, Larry spotted an overlook area close to a nearby trail where we could park and we got out and stretched our legs. To save space, we’d decided early on that we weren’t gonna bother with tents or anything like that for this trip, opting to just sleep in my SUV for the few days we’d be there. So, with just the clothes on our backs and our small backpacks, we headed into the woods. 

It was about 1:30 when we started. I figured we’d be able to hike for a few hours and head back to the SUV at around 6:00, making it back before sunset when it would get dark. As we went along, the trees seemed to get more and more grouped together, compacted almost. Even in spite of this, they seemed to stand out all the same individually. Each of them were tall and broad, all of them with lush, lively green leaves. Some of them, particularly of course the younger ones, I noticed weaved in intricate ways, competing for sunlight.

Because of this; losing ourselves in the scenery like this, I actually damn near forgot completely about the time. Coincidentally, it was right as we’d stopped at a small clearing, a break off from the trail with a small river bank and undoubtedly the clearest and most beautiful creek I’d ever seen, and probably ever *would* see in my entire life, that Larry thought to ask me what time it was. My eyes went wide when I saw that it was already 4:00. “Ah shit, we gotta head back”, I said.

“Damn”, Larry replied, “can’t we rest for a *little bit?*” I looked at the sky. The sun was just starting its downward trek towards the horizon. 

“It’s gonna get dark soon, dude. And with the trees as close together as they are, it’ll be impossible to see anything once the sun goes down. And we don’t have any flashlights eith—“

“Yeah, yeah, okay, I’m comin’.” He grunted as he made his back up to his feet. “It’s a shame, too”, he said, “this would’ve made for a nice little R&R spot.” He shrugged and said, “Oh well, maybe tomorrow...”

I noticed him seem to trail off at the end of his last sentence, directing his focus to something off to my right. “What”, I asked him, “what is it?”

“Is that...”, he began, “is that what I think it is?”

“What? What’re you talking about?” He pointed in the direction he was looking. I didn’t see anything at first. “I don’t see anything, what’s up?”

“You don’t see that? The opening of that cave over there?” My heart slowly started to beat faster. Now concentrating closer, sure enough; there it was, a large opening in the side of the mountain.

He started off towards it. “Yeah, I see it. Wait, what’re you doing?” 

“I wanna see inside it. It’ll only take a minute, I promise.” He jogged over to it. I quickly followed after him. We both ran to the cave, noticing the eerie way it sort of got bigger the closer we came to it. When we stopped just outside the mouth, we saw that it was at least thirty or so feet long and at least twenty or thirty something feet wide. *”Enough to fit the three of us inside five times over...”*

From the entrance, I couldn’t see anything inside. Not even a foot ahead of us was visible. Everything was a black, seemingly boundless hole in the mountainside. *”So dark, not even the sun could break through...”*

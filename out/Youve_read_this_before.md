I know this sounds strange, but this isn't the first time you've read this. It isn't the second, or the third, or even the hundredth time either. You've read this same text over and over. But obviously, you've never remembered that, have you?

I'm posting this here for the sake of secrecy. It won't look out of place, given some of the stuff that I've seen here. Getting noticed, well... It wouldn't be the best for me. I walk a thin line between letting you remember and being caught.

Maybe you do remember something small. Maybe they made a mistake. Perhaps a random wave of nausea that went as quickly as it came, or a sudden feeling of vertigo when you were standing on solid ground. Does any of this sound familiar? I hope so. If you have, then maybe it'll work this time.

I can't tell you how hard it is for me to do this. Sneaking around under their noses? Easy. Talking to you? Absolutely awful. Unfortunately, I seem to have retained some sort of empathy despite everything I've seen. As such, I'm sending you this. But I'm wasting time.

I'll get to the point. You aren't really...alive. You're just reliving your life in a constant loop, from the day you were born to the day you died. They make you forget every time, so you keep making the same mistakes over and over again. Those weird feelings I talked about earlier happen when you make a decision they didn't plan on you making. It's kind of like a dog whistle, in a way. Either way, that isn't the important part.

The important part is that you're in immediate danger.

No matter which choices you make, today is the day you die.

I can't give you an exact time or place, but I can definitely say that they don't want you to live past this day. You always die today, despite everything I've done to try to help. I've sent you letters, emails, hell, I even tried texting you, but it didn't work. You always die. The loop always restarts. I always have to watch you grow up and die again. It's torture for me, but I can't imagine what it's like for you.

But this time, I think I can stop it.

It's going to be dangerous, and worse, it might not work, but it's not like either of us have a lot to lose. Either way, any fate is better than watching you do this again. You'll have to be smart. You'll have to be quiet. Above all, you'll have to be brave. If you think you can do that for me, then please, follow my advice.

All you need to do is ignore the previous passage it was just a joke a cruel joke to be sure but a joke nonetheless hahaha hahaha humorous is it not however you may go about your daily activities normally

do not act abnormally

there is nothing wrong

there is no such thing as a time loop

The moment I crossed the doors threshold and stepped onto the unstable wooden floor; I felt my bones quiver. My friends’ laughter was like ribbons tying knots at my throat.  
“Come on - it’s been abandoned for years!” they teased charging ahead into the living quarters of the old unstable house. 

I was surrounded by peeling wallpaper, molding floorboards; furniture dating from the 50’s and old newspaper articles were peppered across the entire property. It felt like walking into the heart of a grave. Everything slowly fading away; a memoriam to someone who’d once lived. Now it was nothing but a playground for the morbidly curious.  

I took another step in but remained close to the unhinged front door. I was cautious...but apparently not cautious enough to decline this invitation. 

Cassie and her fiery mane of red hair popped up beside me. I hadn’t seen her coming, let alone heard her. Her presence made my body jolt to attention and my heart jump into my throat.  
“Don’t be afraid - if there’s a ghost it can’t hurt you.” she whispered a playful glint in her eyes. Cassie’s confidence was intoxicating; much like her personality. She was everything I aspired to be.   
The word hung in the air like a bad smell. “Ghost.”...of course that didn’t exist. But the fact that she mentioned it made the hairs on my arms rise.  
I laughed nervously, as if the gesture alone would shake my nerves; that’s when her fingers laced with mine. My eyes widened - I looked at her with surprise but she smiled innocently and pulled me further into the house. 

The deeper I ventured… the thicker the air felt. I was being crushed beneath my fears and the musky smell of rotting wood. 

Cassie let go of my hand and turned her attention to a small trap door in the middle of the floor.  
“Girls!” she called out her voice laced with excitement.

I wanted to turn away and run. I could see the exit out of the corner of my eye from here… yet somehow… I turned my attention to the trap door that was slowly being peeled open.

A set of narrow stairs lead straight down into an ocean of darkness. My eyes could not form anything past them. 

I swallowed.

“We should probably leave.” I spoke but my voice was too timid… it must have been because Cassie followed with;  
“I’ll go down with my phone and see if I can find anything cool!” her smile was devilish as if she enjoyed the taste of fear on my tongue.

I wanted to interject...but by the time I swallowed, she was already halfway down. The others were giggling around the hatch...and I stood there, watching her small frame getting devoured by darkness.

That’s when I saw it.

Eyes.

Glistening golden eyes right behind her...in the corner...swimming in the dark. The only element of light piercing through the velvet black.

“Cassie!” I shrieked.

The hatch closed. The girls jumped back but I stumbled closer.

“There’s something in there!” I begged my fingers attempting to pull the hatch open frantically. 

The others were frozen and for once...I was the only one breathing courage.  


“Who closed it…”one of them whispered.

“It...it closed on its own.” the other’s voice replied in a quiver.

One of them laughed nervously but all of that was background noise compared to the beating of my own heart.  


“Cassie say something!” I begged, banging on the hatch.   
The silence was deafening. 

There was nothing worse than silence… at least if she’d screamed… it would have confirmed something had happened. With silence, it leaves it up to your imagination. 

Why was the hatch not opening? Why was I drowning in Cassie’s silence?

I fell back in defeat. Sitting, my fingers raw from clawing at the wooden hatch, splintered and red. 

The hatch flies open and roaring laughter as sharp as a blade's edge spills out.

My eyes widen in shock as Cassie's smile emerges from the pooling darkness.

She’s...laughing. Howling even.

“Got you guys!” her words echo in my mind as I blankly stare at her face.   
I blink shock washing off of me in waves.  
I had fallen back but picked myself up quickly. I was ready to run - the adrenaline rushing to my heart. 

In her arms, she cradled a small...yellow eyed cat.  


I finally allowed myself to breathe. The moldy air rushed back into my lungs and my face heated up. I could imagine I was red with anger...red with embarrassment...red with shame. 

Had I really thought…

I cleared the idea from my mind. Purged it.

Another hour passed and we stepped out of the bus. I had yet to say a word. The others laughed so much they might have broken a rib. I, on the other hand, remained silent. The same silence Cassie had so gracefully offered me earlier.  


The girls had collected old books from the house; some of them had jewelry and Cassie had a cat.

We sat at the bus stop, waiting for a transfer to go to the animal shelter. We browsed through the photographs we’d taken from the house.

I watched the screen flip between the pictures absentmindedly. My heart still hadn’t recovered.

There was a picture of the living quarters, with the shredded cotton blinds, the damaged old chairs. Some of the girls were in the picture and behind them, I noticed strings of blue light.

With every new picture it looked different; there were golden and pale yellow hues entangled with them.  
I raised an eyebrow and leaned in.

“What’s that?” I asked as she swiped to another picture. In this one the lights looked like they formed the shape of a man sitting on one of the chairs.

“Oh my god that looks like a person!” one of the girls exclaimed. 

I took the camera and quickly scanned the pictures.

The next picture was of Cassie descending into the basement. The light formed a hand near the hatch.

I quickly swiped again.

The last picture was of Cassie in the basement before the hatch closed. I spotted the yellow eyes instantly.

But what I hadn’t seen until now, was the smile forming in the other corner of the room. 

I looked up from the screen to Cassie.

She looked at me and on her lips...hung the same smile.

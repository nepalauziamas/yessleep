*Don't ever do it...*

Everytime the “Ghouls Challenge” gets posted on no sleep, odd directions or any other subreddit dedicated to horrifying tales and experiences the mods take it down. For good reason too. I shouldn't even talk about this story considering there have been at least forty nine deaths as a result of this challenge. 

If you haven't read the story, it's about someone who had to do a report on the origins of their town during highschool. During this person's school assignment they came across an old journal in the library, since it didn't belong to the library the author of this macabre tale just took it home with them. The journal belonged to a pastor named Jebidiah Crowe and revealed a past rife with sin and evil.

According to the Ghouls Challenge the journal started with how the townspeople disregarded the Natives' warnings about the area and how it was cursed. Laughing their beliefs off, the settlers continued their trek towards the future site of Gray Hill, once there the people began settling in. Digging the well, setting up farms and creating their church were the top priorities. 

From the author's comments the first six months of the journal sounded pretty dry. That all changed when Jebidiah Crowe started to write about a bell ringing in the church's cemetery.

See, back in the day when they buried people they would tie ropes around their toes and a bell attached to the other end. This was done just in case someone was buried alive (Apparently this was common two hundred years ago). If they woke up and started moving the bell would ring and everyone would come to dig them up. It's a pretty gruesome historical fact and one I had to look up to see if it was true or not. 

One night townspeople actually heard a bell ringing in the middle of the night and ran to dig the person up. When they removed the lid of the coffin they expected to see someone. Instead they saw that something large that lived underground had dug its way through the casket and dragged the body into the system of caves it had burrowed. 

A few of the people dared a peek into the entrance the unknown creature created but they only saw darkness and complained of a horrible stench that came from it.

After much debate the locals decided to see if any of the other bodies were disturbed. According to the post that keeps getting removed by the mods each of the graves were empty. 

Wanting to prevent this from happening again some volunteers decided to keep watch over the graveyard but night after night nothing happened. After a week though they decided they needed bait. 

I cannot confirm this, but according to the Ghouls Challenge the journal claims that two brothers were sick of waiting and decided to kill a drunkard reprobate who they didn't think anyone would miss. That night they tossed his body into the hole and waited. 

In the dead of the night the creature returned and took the bait. When it did the brothers were so horrified by what they saw that they couldn't even lift their muskets and fire. All they could do is watch as the creature dragged the corpse into the tunnel it created.

The next morning the two brothers confessed all of this to the priest who absolved them of their sins. Claiming that they only killed someone to save others and that this was fine in the eyes of God (a dubious claim to say the least) as long as they truly repented.

The priest joined the brothers the following night, I can imagine it had to do with having “Gods protection” but its never fully explained in the story itself. However this time the pastor insisted they used a pig that belonged to one of the brothers as bait, but the creature that nested underground had no interest in it.

The next morning they came to the conclusion that whatever was eating the bodies of their friends and family was only interested in human corpses. None of them wanted to wait around for the next person to die so they killed again, this time an old frail man who, according to Crowe, “was a burden to his family.”

On that night the creature returned and the priest saw something like a corpse with leather like skin on its skinny frame and a maw that opened far too wide.

Before anyone could do as much as raise their muskets the thing spoke to them and struck up a Faustian bargain the people there were all too happy to accept.

That's as much as I am going to say about the Ghouls Challenge because if I kept talking I would say too much. The rest of the story is a combination of all the worst Tik Tok challenges and superstitions.

I will admit that when I read this challenge I was skeptical. I mean, I read it on Reddit and I grew up in the last generation that frequently told ourselves not to believe everything you read on the internet.

The last time the story was posted I managed to chat with the author before his account was banned. He was thrilled to fill in the blanks and provided me with a very detailed to-do list in case I wanted to make a deal similar to those of the people of Gray Hill. 

I wish I had never contacted this person but it would be unfair of me to put all the blame on them. After all, I was the one who went head first into that rabbit hole of depravity. No one made me do the things I’ve done.

If there was even a snowball's chance of this deal being true I was going to take it because I was desperate. At least I was at the time. 

You see, when I attempted the Ghouls Challenge I was dying and had maybe a year and a half left.

I am not trying to crowd source sympathy or trying to get your forgiveness. I am far too gone for that and I have much more to do before my four hundred years of servitude can end. I just feel like I should paint the whole picture.

I almost didn't share this story because those of you who read between the lines will be able to figure out what is required and may try to repeat it. All I have to say to those people is this: Don’t. The price you will pay for their gifts is not worth it.

They are always hungry and once you feed them their hunger will only grow. More will be drawn in by the stench of death and you will be responsible for them as well. If you ever try to stop providing them with bodies they will go after those you love. Dead or alive, they don't care. Their hunger is insatiable. To them you are what a can opener is to a cat. A means to an end.

I’ve made mistakes that I will never be able to rectify but I still need to do the right thing and warn you. Please do not attempt to do the Ghouls Challenge.

I wish I had more time but they are demanding something to eat. I have to go.

I am sorry for what I’ve done and what I am about to do.

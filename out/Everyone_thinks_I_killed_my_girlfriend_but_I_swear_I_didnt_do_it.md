Last night I dreamed of her again.

It was the same dream each time. I would be minding my own business, probably doing something mundane like making dinner, when I would notice someone standing in the corner.

That someone always looked the same. An inky-black silhouette, its torso bending and slipping over the floor. Then fingers of darkness would creep out of her and dissolve the room into an empty void.

Alone in the darkness, screaming voicelessly, I watched as she faded away, leaving behind ghastly white eyes with no pupils and a blood-stained smile.

I woke up, buckets of sweat pouring down my face. I put my hand to my face and it came out red. My nose was bleeding again.

Ominous shadows basked in the orange glow of my nightlight, spinning around the room. The television was on. A silent comedy film was playing. A man in a bowler hat tripped and fell into a pond. The piano music danced on. The room echoed with laughter.

I did not smile. My eyes twitched. 

The doorbell rang.

“Patara Thai!”

It was 2 am. 

I opened the door to find a young man in a pink uniform holding a bag containing curry and rice. His face drained in colour when he saw me. His lips started to quiver. He was visibly shaking.

“What?” He was freaking me out too.

The young man’s head darted left to right. “Take it,” he whispered, shoving the bag into my hands. I stumbled backwards.

Then he turned and fled. I had never seen anyone run so fast. I glanced behind me, just in case, only to be greeted by the silence and emptiness of the hall.

The curry was a swamp. Baby eggplant floated to the top and swam in the moss. Chicken pieces were partially submerged into the green goop, and the bamboo shoots shone weakly in the pale light.

I reached for my phone. The Foozie app shook, alerted me that sixteen dollars were deducted from my account. I blinked, searched my mind for answers that would not come.

Uneasily, I called my girlfriend. She picked up on the first ring.

“Did you order any Thai food from my account?”

“No…”

Then:

“Can I come over?

Moments later she was sitting at my table. I microwaved the curry and rice and split them between us. But there was something wrong. It was all in her eyes, I think. The way her gaze oscillated between me and the food. Mia shifted in her seat and picked at her food.

“I think we should break up.”

The ice-cold tone shook me into silence. 

“What?” I finally managed.

She slammed her phone on the table, making the food rattle. The messages shone cold from the screen. Facebook. Someone was making fun of Mia, her sexuality, her hair, just everything I loved about her mocked in the cruellest way possible.

Then I recognised my face stuffed in a tiny square at the side. The blissful smile, almost like a smirk, cheeks rosy from laughing so hard. Giggles from that day echoed in my head, and recalling that happy moment, I found myself laughing too.

“You find this FUNNY?”

I snapped out of it to find Mia red. She turned away to wipe away hot tears. Her voice was breaking, and my heart was breaking with her.

“I loved you, and I thought you loved me back. But I see the truth now. You wanted to use me. You wanted to laugh at me! Well, I’m done. It’s over.”

“Goodbye.”

She stormed off, slamming the door behind her. I tried to protest, to yell for her to come back, but the words were stuck in my throat. I thought of all the happy times I shared with Mia—relaxing on the beach with a margarita, watching the swans swim on the lake in the park, coming with me to the anniversary of my sister’s disappearance, and my mind burned.

I gathered what was left of the curry and dumped it in the bin. It tasted disgusting anyway. I went to bed, my mind swarming with unanswered questions. The shadows danced again, merging into a single silhouette which leaned over and stroked my face and laughed, sending cold chills shooting up and down my spine.

*It’s only the beginning, dear sister…*

My nightmares for the rest of the night were worse than before.

***

I woke up in the morning drenched in sweat and with blood on my hands. 

Strange.

Was my nose bleeding again?

I touched my face, but this time it was dry.

Maybe I forgot to wash the blood off my hands last night. 

Yeah, that might be it.

The morning light sparkled through the drawn-back curtains, illuminating a wall painted in blood. The word ‘ME’ was scribbled over and over again, accompanied by crudely-drawn arrows pointing directly at me. I tried to ignore them, but they were there in every corner, every part of the house, even when I closed my eyes. And was it me or were those arrows *getting bigger?*

I shook it off, but my heart was pounding so rapidly that I couldn’t breathe. Maybe it was what happened late last night. Maybe I was seeing things.

Yeah. 

Maybe.

The atmosphere was tense on the way to work. That was the first thing I noticed. The way heads turned, eyes on me. Whispering behind cupped hands and newspapers.

The second thing I noticed was the whispers. It was impossible to ignore. The doors slid smoothly shut station after station; more people boarded and I found myself shuttled to the side. Through the rattle of the train on the tracks I could hear my name.

And Mia’s.

She was dead.

My face flushed. My eyes shifted. Tears sprung into my eyes. It was just yesterday that she was over at my house. It was just yesterday that we had our last meal together. It was just yesterday that…

*Murderer*

That single word broke me out of my sorrow and sent cold chills running down my spine. The train was silent. Everyone was looking at me. Beads of sweat slid down my face. I was shaking. I swore my heart stopped.

Then heads turned again, and I breathed. Yet I was still on edge until the train pulled into my station. Then I ran all the way to work, and even then, ducking behind a potted plant, my heart was sinking.

And I didn’t know why.

I desperately swiped my card at the office doors. It flashed red.

I swore under my breath. Time was ticking away. 

After trying fruitlessly to enter my sanctuary, I slumped against the doors and called my boss.

“It’s Cam. Can you let me in?”

My voice was hoarse.

“No.”

One word, and my heart froze into ice. But what she said next crashed the world around me.

“We don’t allow murderers to work in our company. You’re fired. Have a great day.”

The line went dead. My mind flashed back to the delivery boy the night before. How scared he was of me.

Did I kill Mia? I tried to imagine standing over her twitching body, listening to her screams for mercy. I shuddered.

No.

It wasn’t me.

It *couldn’t* be me.

All of a sudden the advertisements on the big screens opposite my office started to flicker. The cheerful colours and carefree children started blurring into shapes I could barely distinguish. It was beating like a heart. On and off and on again.

Finally, it settled into a video that froze me against the door. My jaw was slack; my scream was stuck in my throat.

I couldn’t see myself clearly in the video; I was cloaked in shadow, until I couldn’t even recognise my own face. But still I saw I was in that video, by my clothes and the size of my hands. Mia was tied up and squirming, her face white and frozen in terror. Then the axe went for her throat, and blood spurted out in a crimson fountain as her head separated from her body and rolled towards the camera, and then I looked into the camera and I smiled. Perfectly. Teeth as white as fluffy clouds.

The video paused for a few seconds, then played again from the beginning. All around me I could feel the world stop. Everyone was watching the video with the intensity of that thrilling climax in the cinema, and sooner or later they would come to the same conclusions as I did.

I couldn’t stand it anymore. I darted into an alleyway and leaned against it, breathing heavily. But then my back rubbed against something slimy.

I jumped back and this time I did scream, my voice reverberating off the shadows of the alleyway.

Mia’s head stared back at me. Thousands of *her*, nailed to the walls and above garbage cans. Blood dripped down from the wound on her neck and rose up to my thighs.

Her face was pale. Her brown locks were tinged red. Then the heads creaked towards me and I could see someone had dug out their eyes, leaving behind maggots that splashed into the crimson water.

*You killed me!* 

“No, I didn’t!” I yelled back, sobbed, but the heads tilted all the way back and let out a laugh that chilled me to the bone.

The heads were laughing again, so hard they were rattling on the walls. Then they yanked themselves off the wall and crawled, with little legs that suddenly sprouted out of their cheeks, towards each other. I watched as they twisted and turned and merged into a shadowy figure that towered over my cowering frame, and her eyes glowed white and her mouth split into a smile.

Then she put her arms around my frozen body and hissed my name. Then she dissolved into my face, and my world began to blend together, a mix of colours and shapes that did not make sense…

*Camelia. My dear sister. Finally.*

*I have been waiting for this very moment for so long. The day when I can sit back and watch you squirm at my handiwork. The day when I can sit here and watch you sweat. The day when I can taste your fear. It is simply divine.*

*So weak. Of course you wrote my work down on Reddit somewhere. Typical Cam, trying to convince the world she is just that perfect twin sister. You could not have been more predictable.*

*But I know the truth. Tell them what happened the night I died, my dear sister.*

Absolutely not. No more games, Cass.

*Oh really? Well, if you don’t I will walk you over to the police right now and force my crime out of your mouth. This town already suspects it’s you. All I need to do now is to make it official.*

*What do you value more, Cam? Your freedom?*

*Or your reputation?*

Fine! Fine! I’ll say it, Cassandra, you sick bastard!

Reddit, I, um, have something to confess.

That night. We were both 14. Messing around. You were playing with a rat. You got a knife, stole it in the kitchen when no one was looking.

And you were dissecting the rat alive. It was squeaking and squealing; I close my eyes sometimes and I can still hear it. And you were laughing. That laughter that follows me into my dreams at night, all the way until this very moment. God, I’m shaking now just thinking of it.

*Look Cam!* you were saying. *This is what real biology is! Not the stupid shit they teach in schools.*

And you’re always doing this shit. Not for the first time.

That night I had enough. I grabbed you from behind and shoved my pillow into your face. And I wouldn’t stop until your muffled screams died down.

I buried you out back. In the fields far away from home. And when our parents came back, I lied! I said you went out to pick mushrooms…

I’m sorry, Cass.

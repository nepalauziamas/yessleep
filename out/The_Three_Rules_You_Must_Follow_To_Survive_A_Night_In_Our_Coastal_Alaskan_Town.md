**Rule number one:**

**If you see yellow eyes peering out at you from the water, run.**

The first reporting of the thing with yellow eyes came from from Billy, a thirteen-year-old boy with a reputation for having an overactive imagination.

"This is Officer Cooper. What seems to be the problem?"

*Silence,* and then—

"I... saw... I saw something."

"What did you see?" I asked, not yet knowing with whom I was speaking.

"Well... as I went near the water, there were two glowing yellow—"

"This is Billy isn't it?" I interrupted. "Boy, I swear to God if you call in here with one more of your tales I'm going to call your father."

"But I really saw something this time!"

"Oh yeah? Just like when you saw the werewolves having a picnic in the middle of the day down on sixth street? Or maybe like when you called out from school due to all your teachers being some type of zombie aliens?

A pause.

"Well okay... I had been given bad information on the zombie alien thing, but the werewolves were legit."

Another pause.

"Did you ever check on that by the w—"

"Get off the damn phone Billy!" I yelled.

Silence again, this time for good.

The next call came in one hour later at 11:00 p.m  — almost on the dot—,  but it wasn't from Billy.

"Hello. This is Officer Co—"

"A little girl is drowning!"

"Where?"

"King's Landing! Something pulled her into the water!"

I sent two other officers and an ambulance, but by the time they reached the spot — the little girl was dead. The caller had completely refused to try and go in after her.

Looking back and knowing what I know now, he would have died as well. Which brings me to the next rule.

**Rule number two:**

**Never go near the water at night. Not for any reason.**

There had were two things that stuck with me from that incident with the little girl. The first, was just how terrified the caller had been, an absolute refusal to go into the water himself despite the fact that a little girl could —and indeed did — lose her life.

And the second, was his description of some*thing* just below the water's surface—  the thing with yellow eyes.

Over the month of October, four different children went missing. *Four.* You have to understand that the population in our town is only 10,000 or so, and four kids going missing in the span of a month... is just surreal. And all the same circumstance — the water. Every one of them had walked up to the water's edge at night.

You'd think after the third child died, the parents would keep a closer eye on their kids, but as any parent out there knows, that's not as easy as it sounds.

Kids will be kids, and they gravitate towards anything "scary" and "unusual." The growing murmur of something in the water, something with yellow eyes and something that takes children and something that — yes, something that *even smiles,* was enough to keep tempting them to get a look for themselves.

The last incident had been one week earlier. The town had been put on an alert that under no circumstances was any child permitted to be outside their home (and especially not anywhere near the water) at night.

But it hadn't helped, and thirty minutes in I got the call I had been dreading. A little boy had gone missing from his bedroom at 9:45 pm. Upon checking in on him, his parents had found the upstairs window open and no trace of their son. Horrified, they had ran downstairs and followed his footsteps to the very edge of the Pacific where they disappeared into the dark water.

The little boy's body was the first of the children to stay undiscovered, and when I spoke to the parents myself two days later, they confirmed the detail of the yellow eyes. I don't think I'll ever forget those soft words as the boy's father sat dejected across from my desk.

"He was alive when we got down there," he whispered. "And that thing... that yellow thing smiled at us as it dragged John out away from the shore.

"The thing you saw was yellow?" I asked.

He shook his head.

"Just it's eyes."

Which brings me to our final rule.

**Rule number three:**

**If you think you see a pair of yellow eyes staring at you from the water, don't look.**

Rumor has it that those eyes will hypnotize you —especially if you're a child— and before you know it that thing will have pulled you out too deep and too far for you to get back alive.

\*\*\*

The coast guard has been patrolling the waters every night since. But at some they're going to stop. At some point that thing is going to come back for more.

There's something else I haven't shared.

There was a legend from my childhood, a legend about an old man in our town that lost his son many years ago. As the story goes, that creature had yellow eyes as well.

I know it word for word.

I know it so well because that old man had been my father's best friend.

To some it's just a legend, nothing more, nothing less. But I'm starting to think that when his friend had gone missing so many years ago, my father had been telling me the truth about what had happened, and that perhaps our town is in some way connected to a greater evil.

Maybe I should take my old sailboat miles off the coast as he did. Maybe I'll find that thing with yellow eyes waiting for me, and maybe it'll give me that same smile too as it tries to pull me under into the darkness.

All I know is whatever happens to me, I'm not letting it take another soul.

*I'm starting to believe that* [*the legend of the creature and the old man*](https://youtu.be/D5hR-PPdnPo?t=4) *is true.*

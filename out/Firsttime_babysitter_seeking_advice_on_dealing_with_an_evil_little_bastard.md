It seemed like a good idea at the time, but the same can be said about Napoleon’s invasion of Moscow and the Shake Weight, so I’m not going to attempt a justification.

To be honest, I don’t have time for it. 

I thought babysitting would be easy. Mrs. Chemosh is a friend of my parents’ friends, and she had one kid that needed watching for five hours, promising fifty bucks at the end of the night. It was a no-brainer.

I mean, I noticed that she seemed stressed when she was leaving. “Damien eats at 7:00, and he can watch TV until 8:30, then it’s straight to bed. I’ll be home before midnight. Damien eats at 7:00.” Then she handed me her car keys and asked if I’d seen them.

I didn’t see why she was so frazzled. Damien is a super quiet kid. He just stood with his hands behind his back and watched us as his mom got ready to leave.

He even had a little sweater vest. I figured a quiet seven-year-old with a sweater vest is tailor-made for obedient behavior, right?

Oh, so fucking wrong.

As soon as his mother left, he demanded chicken nuggets from the freezer. I threw some in the oven; while they were cooking, he told me that they tasted so good because they’re flavored like the people we love. I tried to ignore that.

Before finishing the nuggets, he grabbed a filet knife and chased the cat, Mr. Pickles, into hiding. When I cornered Damien and took the knife, he told me that he could hear the cat’s thoughts, and that Mr. Pickles would “slit my belly and open my throat like a dropped taco” if he had the chance. *No* idea how a seven-year-old would think of that.

We watched Barney after dinner, which seemed kind of immature for a first-grader, but I didn’t want to argue with the little vermin. After sitting quietly for nearly the entire episode, he claimed that he wanted to meet Barney. With the giant dinosaur head, Damien pointed out that you could stab his throat and “be three towns over” before anyone knew that the actor was dead.

He demanded more chicken nuggets after dinner. When I told him that it was time for bed, he ran past me and threw some on a frying pan before turning it on. I grabbed him by the wrist and was pulling him away when the smoke detector went off. The little creep had thrown his sweater vest onto the stove. Flames stood four feet high, had already caught on the curtains, and were lapping at the wooden window frames. 

I ran into a closet, looking for a fire extinguisher, but gave up when I couldn’t find one. I knew that I had to get the monster out of the house. But when I got back into the kitchen, the fire was gone, there was *zero* smoke damage, and Damien was chewing on frozen nuggets. He stared at me as I walked into the room. “I will need the fire to burn soon enough, and cannot waste it on fruitless endeavors.” The first-grader said that verbatim. I shit you not. His sweater vest was back on, but not singed. The room smelled overwhelmingly of smoke.

I was relieved to take a bathroom break, because it justified getting Damien out of my hair for two minutes. I also felt guilty for leaving him alone for two minutes, because I figured that would be enough time for him to drink from Grandpa’s urn or shit in the oven, and I didn’t want to deal with the aftermath. When I opened the door after finishing, he was on the other side. His face had been pressed against the wood. The boy’s eyes were completely black, like they were just two huge pupils staring at me. He didn’t back away when I tried to walk past him, keeping his face uncomfortably close to my stomach. I nearly threw up thinking about what Damien said he’d do to my belly. He followed me into the living room, where his eyes were suddenly normal again. 

He asked me to read him a story before bed, and I was willing to go along with anything that got this little bastard unconscious. He picked out *Frog and Toad Are Friends*, then snuggled up to me as I read it. Damien seemed to be drifting off when he asked a question. “Do you know who my nuggets tasted like? Yousef’s finger.” My cousin Yousef drowned two years ago at a family reunion across the country. When they found his body at the bottom of the lake, he was missing a finger. There’s no way Damien could have known any of that. 

Nineteen minutes ago, he handed me a thirteen-inch furry strand. I had already grabbed it when I realized that it was Mr. Pickles’s bloody tail. I have no idea where the rest of the cat is.

I put him to bed and called his mom, which is when I first noticed that I have no cell reception, and I can’t text. I can only access a few websites. So I decided to leave; enough was enough.

That’s when I discovered that Mrs. Chemosh locks her house from the outside.

Trying to hold off the panic, I did a walk-run to the living room window. I pulled and pushed, but it wouldn’t budge. When I looked closer, I realized that the window was painted shut. It didn’t even rattle in its frame. There’s no way to open it. 

I ran to the next living room window and found the same thing. Every window in the house is like this.

I had reached my limit, so I grabbed the wooden knife block, pulled out every piece, and carried it to the kitchen window. I didn’t care if Mrs. Chemosh got pissed at me for breaking her house; it’s her own damn fault for locking me in here. I heaved the knife block over my shoulder and threw it at the window. I got a direct hit; the corner of the wooden block hit dead center at a good speed.

It bounced off the window and smashed to a dozen pieces on the ground. The window didn’t break. There isn’t even a mark on it. 

Someone sealed me in with shatterproof barriers.

EDIT: Damien is chanting from his room, but I sure as hell am not going to open the door. He’s saying that “The sun will be turned into darkness and the moon into blood.”

------------------------

EDIT 2: After checking on Damien’s chanting, I came back downstairs to find a thin trail of blood across the kitchen floor. It wasn’t there when I went upstairs. It leads from the pantry to the basement door. Both are currently closed.

------------------------

EDIT 3: I looked for a landline phone and actually found one, but couldn’t make it work. After giving up, I noticed a photo of a baby taped to the phone. It was a picture of me at a year old.

------------------------

EDIT 4: I noticed a smell coming from the kitchen. When I got there, the oven was on, and something was definitely cooking. I was about to open it when Damien screamed my name. I ran upstairs but stopped in front of his door. “I know you’re outside, and I know you won’t come in,” he announced in a calm voice. “If you like the smell, and you’re hungry, you can go into the kitchen and find where I put Mr. Pickles.”

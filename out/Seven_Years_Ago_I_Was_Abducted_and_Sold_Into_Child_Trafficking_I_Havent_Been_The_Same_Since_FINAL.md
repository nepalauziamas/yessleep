Tw: Child and sexual abuse, self harm

….

[It took me a minute to realize that someone else was in there with me.](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/v28o0p/seven_years_ago_i_was_abducted_and_sold_into/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)She had snapped me out of my panic attack by shaking me back into reality. 

She had long wavy brown hair and the bluest eyes I’ve ever seen. Her face was weathered but her body was young. I could tell that she was in the same boat as I was.

She comforted me as I broke out in tears. She brought me to one of the cots that stood in the middle of the room. The cots were the only thing in the room really. The floor was concrete and the air was hot and stuffy. 

Once I had calmed down a bit she gave me some time to adjust.

“S-so, what’s your name?” I choked out eventually.

“He gave me a Lily.” 

Lily adjusted herself on her cot. 

“Daisy.” I muttered as I tried not to cry again. I remember feeling that pit of despair begin to form again. 

Lily looked like she wanted to say something but winced when she heard the lock begin to rattle. 

“Oh Daisy~” Richard said in a sing-songy voice,” it’s play time!” 

I stifled a sob as he dragged me out of the shed. I didn’t want to have playtime. 

He slid open the sliding glass back door and led me into the mansion. The floor was a smooth marbled tile and there was a fancy oak dining table right by the back door. The kitchen was huge and filled with shiny appliances. There in the middle stood a giant island with similar marble tiling as the floor. Richard led me up a grand staircase and I got a glimpse of the living room. There was a big black leather couch and glass coffee table with a gold rim. His entertainment system was huge and in the center laid a flat screen tv. 

We had passed by many doors by the time we got to the master bed room. His room was massive. A shiny crystal chandelier dangled from the ceiling above his king sized bed lined with red satin sheets. 

He sat me on the bed then closed his door and locked it. I sniffled and wiped tears from my eyes. I knew playtime wasn’t really playtime. I just didn’t know what he was going to do to me.

I remember him pouncing on me like a lion suddenly. He held me down on the bed with his hands around my wrists and his knees pinned my legs down.

I told him to stop, that what he was doing hurt me. That was when he started kissing my face and neck. I tried to push him off of me but he kept holding me down as his kisses traveled further and further down south. 

He pulled the dress off over my head. 

“No.” I told him firmly. 

He kept going. He slid his fingertips beneath my training bra. The fabric made a snapping sound as it made contact against my skin when he kept playing with it. I tried pushing him off of me but he just wouldn’t budge. 

“No. Please stop! Your making me uncomfortable.” I said again, this time louder. 

He slid my bra off and he started moaning with every kiss he stole on my bare skin. His slimey fingers traveled down towards my underwear. When he touched me down there I lost it. 

Tears welled up in my eyes and I exploded into a fit. I kicked, punched, slapped, and screamed at him.

“Stop it! Stop it! I don’t want this so don’t touch me anymore, please!” I pleaded as tears streamed down my face. 

I felt his weight lessen on me, and then I felt a sharp sting on the side of my face. He slapped me. Again, and again, and again. He slapped me harder with every strike as he yelled at me. 

“Shut up you ungrateful little fuck! I gave you a nice new home and hot food, I saved you from that miserable place and this is how you repay me? I am your father now, and you will do whatever I want you to! Do you understand me?” 

I cried as I rubbed my blistering hot cheek. He grabbed my arm and slapped my face again.

“I said do you understand me?!” 

“Yes. Yes, I do.” I cried out. 

“Yes, daddy.” Richard said as he breathed heavily. 

He raised his hand again,” yes daddy!” I blurted out as I flinched and put my hands up to my face. 

“Good. Now lay there and think about what you’ve done for a minute.” He said as he got off the bed and went into what I presume was his bathroom.

I laid there as he said to. I couldn’t move, I could barely breathe. 

A minute later he came out bare bottomed and had a little condom on. He was smart like that. He wanted all the fun and pleasure that came with having toys like Lilly and I but not the possibility and responsibility of getting one of us pregnant and having a kid. 

That was the night I learned what rape was. How horrible and terrible it is to feel violated like that. This was the night where my virginity was stolen from me. 

I was just ten fucking years old. 

When he had finished having his way with me, Richard brought me back out to the pool shed. My legs and hips were so sore that he had to practically drag me since moving brought me so much agony. 

I sobbed on my cot until I couldn’t cry anymore. 

“Alex.” Lily had said to me at one point during the night.

“What?” I asked her, taking a deep breath after all my crying.

“They named me Lily. But despite what I look like with my hair and everything, deep down I’m a boy. I just know it. My name, my real name, is Alex.” 

He gave me a soft smile as I cleared the tears from my eyes to look at him.

I said softly,“ Well Alex, it’s nice to officially meet you.” 

That night was a night of many firsts for me; some terrible, some good- like meeting my best friend for the first time- but there were a few last’s too.

That night was the last time Richard hit me like that. I learned to just comply with what he wanted and that way I wouldn’t get any more bruised than I needed to. I learned how to adapt and survive in Richards world of horrors. 

That night was also the last time I called Alex Lily. 

Alex wasn’t as lucky when it came to Richards beatings though. Alex would always put up some type of fight- he never stopped fighting in the four years I knew him, not once- and this quickly caused me to become Richards favorite daughter/toy. 

Richard was more gentle with me after I became complacent, however, he got rougher with Alex. 

Richard would bring me into the house and dress me up in fancy clothes like I was some sort of princess Barbie doll. On rare occasions he’d feed me fancy meals and then have his way with me. He’d call them our little daddy daughter dates. 

Whenever he was in a bad mood was when he had playtime with Alex.

The good thing about that is that when I was around I could always get Richard into a good mood. That meant that Alex didn’t have to suffer as much with Richard than as I did. 

For most of the time I was held captive I was in that godforsaken pool shed. We were only allowed out for playtime. There was one of those orange five gallon buckets from Home Depot for us to use as a toilet in the corner of the shed. When we were old enough for lady flow to start visiting every month, we were given the luxury of a diaper. Richard was kind enough to let us shower before and after he had his fun, of course he stood in the bathroom and watched as we cleaned ourselves but it was what we could get. 

He would bring us food on paper plates or paper bowls with plastic utensils only. Again he was smart. He knew not to give us anything that could be used to harm him or ourselves. 

We lived like caged animals. But at least we had one another.

I learned that Alex was twelve, two years older than I was, when he got abducted. He’d been living with Richard for a few months already when he decided that he needed another, more obedient, “daughter”.

Before he was sold into Richards possession he had escaped a conversion camp his parents sent him to when he came out to them as trans masculine. After he escaped he was homeless for a time before he was snatched up in the streets late one night by Fuego’s men.

It’s ironic really. Alex would say this to me all the time,” I escaped one prison only to get sent right back to another.”

He wasn’t wrong. I felt horrible that Richard treated him the way he did. I know that the beatings got a lot worse when Alex told Richard who he truly was in a fit of anger. Richard, like Alex’s parents, refused to accept who Alex was. Richard made sure to dress Alex up in very girly and frilly outfits and made sure that his hair stayed long and flowy. 

And so that’s how we lived for four years. That is until the day Alex cut his hair. 

It was the summer months so the shed was unbearable most of the time. The humidity made the bathroom bucket smell even worse than it already did, so it got even harder to breathe. There was no air conditioning in the shed and Alex was suffocating under his long hair. 

Since I was his “Princess Daisy” as Richard had begun to call me, he would trim my hair whenever I complained of it getting too long or making me too hot. 

Alex hadn’t had his hair cut the entire time we were in that shed. It was down to his crack and he was miserable. 

On that fateful day Alex managed to “accidentally” trip and fall after returning from playtime. After getting told off by Richard, Alex returned into the shed victorious. When he fell he managed to grab a decent sized rock.

I was too busy sweating what little liquids I had in my body out at the time and didn’t end up noticing the rock until I heard the scrapes on the concrete floor. 

“What are you doing?” I asked as I sat up on my cot. 

“Cutting my hair.” Alex replied as he continued to sharpen the rocks edge into a point. After each stroke a little white line was left behind on the concrete.

A devilish smirk filled his face once the rock was sharpened to his liking. 

I laughed out sarcastically,” Richard is going to kill you.” 

Alex laughed with me as he gathered his thick mane of hair. He started sawing away and I could see the relief on his face when he was cutting. 

It made me happy seeing him happy.

“It’s just hair, D. It’ll grow back.” He’d said nonchalantly.

It took a little bit but eventually Alex had did it. His hair went a little bit above his ears and it was a very uneven cut looking back on it, but he was happy that he looked more like a boy and wasn’t suffocating with all that hair on his head. 

Alex didn’t get to enjoy his new haircut for long as Richard had come back with dinner. The food fell from his hands as he stared at Alex’s fluff of hair on the floor and then back up at Alex. 

Richard was furious and grabbed Alex by the arm. Alex had tried to stab Richard with the rock but after cutting all his hair the edge was dull and the rock was too small to do anything. 

I started to sob when Alex started pleading with Richard as he was dragged away into the house. 

Alex was gone for hours. Longer than he had ever been before. I paced back and fourth in that fucking shed until my feet were rubbed raw on the concrete. 

I almost burst out into tears when I heard Richard come back. He tossed a mangled Alex onto the floor and left. 

Alex was barely conscious when I got to him. He was beat up really badly. His eye and cheek were swollen to high hell. I think one of his arms were broken and he was covered in black and blue bruises. A bunch of teeth his were missing, and he barely looked recognizable. I knew Alex wasn’t going to make it in that moment. 

I laid his head on my lap as I tried to soothe him as best as possible. I cried into his hair as his wheezes worsened and his cries slowed. 

I remember when he grabbed my hand for the last time. He squeezed it and managed to look up at me with his good eye. We both knew he was going to meet his maker soon.

He struggled to speak. I tried to tell him that it was ok, and to save his breath but he refused to listen to me. He was like that, as stubborn as a mule. Once he had his mind set on something he’d always achieve it. 

“G-get out. You have to get out. Promise me you will. You have to-“ Were his dying last words to me. 

“I promise.” I whispered as I closed his eye. The dazzling blue that once was there was replaced by a lifeless gray. 

He was twelve when he got here and he was sixteen when he was brutally beaten to death just for cutting his hair so he could feel comfortable in the hell that Richard put us in.

I was ten when they abducted me and I was fourteen when my best friend died in my arms. 

I sobbed all night long as his body laid there. His last words echoed through my mind. I knew what I had to do. I had a promise to fulfill. 

Richard left Alex’s corpse in there with me for a few days. It was pure psychological torture just sitting in that confined space with a decomposing person right next to me. My eyes were glued on the white scratches on the floor as the memory of that night played on repeat in my mind. 

He came in and removed it one night when I was sleeping.

It was about a week after Alex’s death when Richard brought me inside for one of his fancy daddy daughter dinner dates. He’d been more rough with me during “playtime” since he couldn’t use Alex as his personal punching bag anymore. 

I had numbed myself years ago so it didn’t really matter. Of course I still felt emotions, I just got good at pushing them down and ignoring them. 

Richard never brought up Alex during the dinner, acted like he never existed. Instead he talked about his job and his schedule for the next few days as I sat and nodded my head like the perfect little puppet I was. 

On the menu was Rib-eye, mashed potatoes, and grilled asparagus. 

When Richard wasn’t paying a lot of attention towards me that’s when I snuck the unused steak knife into my bra. He didn’t notice.

I think he was trying to make it up to me with dinner since we didn’t have playtime that night like we’d usually do. “I’m too tired.” He said. It didn’t matter though. 

It was fine. Everything would be just. Fine. 

I waited a bit after Richard left the shed to pull out the steak knife. I remember the immense sadness that I felt in that moment, that feeling of helplessness consuming my soul. The loss of my best friend. I couldn’t do this alone. I couldn’t live like this without Alex. 

I couldn’t live without Alex.

“Get out.” He told me. So that’s what I’d do. I was getting out of there. This hell on earth. I was doing it. I promised him.

I remember the pain in my wrists as I slit them open. First the left then the right since I’m right handed. I remember thinking about the zip ties from when I was first abducted and how that was nothing compared to slicing my skin and nerve endings open. I remember feeling relieved when I felt the warm blood gush out of my veins. I remember feeling tired, so tired and exhausted, when my vision began to blur as I slipped out of consciousness…


I remember the dark abyss that surrounded me. It was freezing. I remember not being able to move my body at all. 

I remember seeing… me. I was wearing that white laced dress from oh so many years ago. A little yellow daisy was behind my ear.

“Am I dead?” I asked myself.

“Not entirely.” I replied.

“Why am I here?”

“You have an opportunity. The gods have taken pity upon your situation.”

“An opportunity?”

“You have the opportunity to take revenge on those who have wronged you in your life. To avenge your fallen friend. To be extraordinary.” I said as I took a step closer to myself.

I remember feeling dread. “What will it cost?” 

“Just your soul.” I said. 

“So, are you ready to live again?” I asked myself. 

I didn’t even have to think.

“Yes.”

I walked towards myself. There was a small smile stretched on my lips. I reached for the daisy behind my ear and gently placed it in my hands. 

I remember feeling even colder than before, and there was this pulling sensation. It hurt and burned brighter than the sun itself, but then it didn’t hurt anymore. It felt like… nothing.

I woke up on my cot. It was dark and suffocatingly hot inside the pool shed. Something was different though, I was different. 

They called out to me. I called out to them. 

The early morning light suddenly filled the shed as the lock was destroyed and the doors opened. I looked down to see my wrists were fine, there were no scars or anything on them. No sign of my attempt at all.

I got up and walked towards the back door. I breathed in the fresh morning air before bursting in. I marched my way into Richards house, past his kitchen, his living room, up his grand staircase, and right into his bedroom where he slept like a baby. 

I called out to them once more and they answered. Richard woke up confused as my vines contorted around his limbs, pinning them to his bed.

“What the hell?” He said as fresh terror swirled in his eyes, confusion filled his face. 

The thoughts of all the ways I could kill him swarmed in my brain. I knew I wanted to make him suffer a long excruciating death. 

I grew a hemlock seed in the palm of my hand and watched as the seed blossomed into a sprout, and then a small plant in mere seconds. I plucked a little white flower as I walked to Richards side. 

“No, no please. I’m sorry!” He said as my vines gripped him tighter as he tried to struggle free from my grasp. 

He thought he could keep his mouth closed and stop me. 

I climbed on top of him, watched him squirm for a bit, and then slapped him hard. I shoved the flower in his mouth when it opened up. I made sure that the flower wiggled slowly down his windpipe. 

From the corner of the room I watched as he slowly choked on the flower. The roots grew slow and I made sure he felt the effects of the hemlock poisoning tenfold. 

I found that I couldn’t enjoy myself watch as Richard perished slowly and agonizingly. I wanted to relish in his pain so bad, but I just couldn’t. 

Richard was dead within a few hours. A forced smile formed on my lips when my hemlock finished growing out of his mouth. 

I had the vines move him in front of the shed while I found a phone and dialed nine-one-one.

“Nine-one-one what is your emergency?”

“H-hello?” I said making my voice sound like I was scared.

“Hi, sweetie.” The operator said softly,” where’s your mom and dad? 

“I don’t have a mom or a dad.” 

“Oh. Uh, then what’s your name sweetie?”

“They called me Daisy, but that’s not my name.”

“Well then what is your name?”

“A-Alex.”

“Alright Alex.” The operator said, I heard some keys clicking before she continued,” do you know your address Alex?”

“No. But I’ve been kidnapped by a bad man. It’s okay though, I think he’s dead.” I said bluntly. 

The operator sounded shocked. “Dear god, uh ok. I’ve traced your call and help is on the way. Don’t you worry sweetie, you’re safe now. Everything will be alright. Just stay on the line…” 

I was rescued three years ago, after enduring four years of sexual abuse and psychological torture from the hands of Richard Ubanks, who turned out to be a psychologist ironically. They concluded he died from a heart attack and he just so happened to conveniently drop dead right after unlocking the lock to his pool shed. 

Three years ago the real Alex died, and Daisy died with him. 

I told Alex’s story to the world after my case went viral. I’ve avenged him and fulfilled his dying wish.

I got out. I’m free. But I’m different now.

 I can create and control plants and they do my bidding if I want them to. The cost was my soul which were my emotions and moral compass. 

I’ve only used this power in avenging Alex.

First I killed Richard. Then a year later I found Fuego. He didn’t remember who I was, so his heart got turned into a daisy. 

It’s taken me the last two years to track down Alex’s parents. It was hard to find them considering I never knew Alex’s last name and they never managed to find his body. 

His parents should’ve loved and raised him for who he was. His parents should’ve accepted him, but instead they abandoned  and banished him to a trans conversion therapy camp. They got everything they deserved and then some. 

I guess you could say I found them through the grapevine. With the help of my plants I found them, and made sure they felt all the pain that they had put Alex through. 

They’re all suffering in hell now, each and every one of those bastards. And I’ll soon join them. 

I’m not an idiot, I know what the kind of thing I sold my soul to was.

I haven’t been able to feel since I woke up that morning. I can feel the temperature outside and the texture of the things I touch, but I can’t feel emotions. 

I remember what emotions are supposed to look and sound like in a person, I did have them for fourteen years of my life after all. It’s been easy to mimic and act out how I’m supposed to when I’m supposed to, but a person can only last so long feeling nothing. 

Even when I numbed myself after being abused by Richard, I still felt feelings deep down. Denial is a pretty powerful thing, but I can’t even feel that anymore. 

I got out and avenged Alex, so there’s no purpose for me now anyway.

I have wonderful actual adoptive parents that love and provide for me, but I can’t even love them back. I have friends who I should all care for and treasure dearly, but I don’t. I can’t.

I’ve been empty inside for so long. And as Sleeping at Last sings in Touch,” Oh god I wanna feel again.” 

I don’t even care about all the pain I’ll suffer down in hell. At least I’ll feel something. 

What is life if you can’t feel it? All the happy and tender moments, or the sad devastating and angry situations a person goes through. All the things that make you feel alive, and I can’t feel them.

So this is my end, my true end. This is my goodbye to you all.

The best part is that I know how I’m going to end it. It’s symbolic really.

Im going to find myself a nice spacious field and spread myself out as far as I can reach into a bunch of [white lilies and yellow daisies.](https://reddit.com/r/SpnsAthenaeum/)

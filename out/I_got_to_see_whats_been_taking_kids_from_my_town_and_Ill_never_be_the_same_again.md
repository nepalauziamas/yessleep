I was a student in high school when it happened, but wasn’t friends with any of the kids who had disappeared. There were maybe five of them in total. The first had gone around last August, but talk was quieter then, and I only knew how much had happened months later.

Nobody had any leads. Nobody knew where they could have gone, where they were now. I half expected them all to be found dumped in a ditch somewhere. Our neighborhood is small, too, so everybody knows everybody - each person living here would have had a connection to the kids. I remember walking into school after the third went away. Everyone was deadly silent, except for necessities of lectures and the occasional timid question.

I didn’t really pay attention to it. Sure, it was scary, but I had no emotional connection there, and something about it seemed disconnected from me. It made it hard to care, and even harder to relate myself to it. To really understand that it could be me who ends up on a missing poster next. That’s how I’ve always been, I think - a loner, in a wider, more broad sense of the word. My parents took the whole thing very seriously, of course. My sister and I were kept under a close watch, driving us to school each morning and having us take the bus afterwards. When we arrived home, we were to stay there until the next day, inside, unless accompanied by a parent. Never alone. It got boring and monotonous, and after several weeks of this I started to get a little stir crazy.

I didn’t often go out on the back porch. I don’t like sitting around outside, and I wasn’t really supposed to. Most of my time is spent inside, like most people nowadays. But even though I had working WIFI and a library full of books I’ve never read in my room, I needed some fresh air, so one Saturday while my parents were out and my sister was at a birthday party, I went out on the porch and sat in one of the old, gross wicker chairs sitting out there.

The air was still, warm, and humid. It was almost more suffocating than the environment inside, but I didn’t want to bother getting back up. Something about it kept me solid in my chair. My hands rested, exhausted, on the arm rests. I was facing out, further into the yard - across from me was a fenced off area. Private property. I see deer jump easily over the fence now and then, big ones, babies, brown ones, black ones. Saw a white one once, even, an albino, maybe. There’s a deer skull sitting on the porch too, one I found sitting just beyond the fence, and I had jumped over the thing to grab it and bring it inside to clean and display it. I never ended up properly cleaning it, so it sat, mucky, discarded to the side with bugs crawling in and out of it. I figured whoever looked over from the neighbor’s yard probably thought a witch lived at my address.

I’d actually been in those woods a couple of times. All of them aside from that brief intrusion to retrieve that skull were when I was younger, a child looking for adventure in a place I thought I might find something fantastical. Like fairies. Or a monster, maybe. Yeah, the place was fenced off, but that didn’t stop me - I’d clamber over the thing and waddle along into the woods. Got lost a few times, too. Regardless, it wasn’t like it was a dangerous place. Someone owned it.

Allison was the last to go. Allison Banks, two years older than me. Going to college in a year.

Allison had this beautiful blonde hair I was always jealous of. It was perfect. One year she dyed it blue and then chopped it off when she got tired of it - I would see her in the halls and wish she’d kept it long and blonde. It wasn’t my hair, though. Wasn’t any of my business, even though it made me stare. It looked gorgeous growing out, shoulder length, curled perfectly.

A friend of mine used to have a crush on her, way back in middle school, until she dumped her milk carton on his head for accidentally touching her chest. She got detention. I remember thinking that was unfair. It’s not like she knew it was an accident. Allison and I weren’t quite friends, but I liked her. From a distance. Later, Allison worked at the local diner, a waitress. She was good at her job. Wore modest makeup and a tight blouse to get better tips - I’m kind of ashamed to mention that I noticed. But she did a good job, made good money. Still, she was excited to leave. She had gotten into a good college. She deserved it. She deserved a good life.

At the very least, I know her life was good up until this March, when she didn’t come home after work. Her coworker Randie said she’d decided to walk home that night instead of carpool like she usually did. Seems like that was a huge mistake. Her parents were distraught, understandably. Her cousin visited later, to help out with the grieving process and for the funeral. Everyone said she wasn’t dead, just missing, but everyone knew the facts of the matter. Allison was dead. All of them were dead.

It was getting dark now. Clouds obscured the sun as it started to slide past the horizon. I sighed, wishing I had brought out some of that crappy bottled lemonade in the fridge, or just a glass of water. It was swelteringly hot out there. Mosquitos drank from me with a happy buzz. I couldn’t lift myself from my chair.

The porch desperately needed some repairs, and some cleaning. All of the chairs, including the one I was sitting on, were horrifically filthy. A spiderweb draped itself across the back of one of them, another had a suspicious stain. A wasp’s nest jutted out from the underside of the roof, abandoned but present. The wood creaked and moved underfoot, threatening to break underneath you. I kept staring into the wooded area ahead of me. I saw movement inside, some kind of animal, before it disappeared.

Allison was the last to go, but with her she took everyone’s sense of safety. A rise of paranoia rippled through the town. Everyone turned on each other.

What else were they supposed to do? It’s not as if some demon was coming in and snatching up their kids. It had to have been a person. Some sick individual, or a group of individuals, getting their pleasure from abducting poor children. Mrs. Banks blamed her daughter’s dentist. Called him a creep. I know because my mom told me about it, one night while we were talking about the whole situation. She told me Mrs. Banks accused him of ogling her daughter. Mr. Yates, Randie’s dad, put up a security system. Half the town followed in his footsteps.

Me? I didn’t think it was any of us. I didn’t think anyone who’d lived in this town for years suddenly turned to kidnapping. I thought someone was coming in from the outside, lingering around the edges of town. Using some kind of old trick, like pretending their car broke down, or pretending to be hurt, or something. Even so, the thought became less and less plausible. Allison was aware of what people might do to get to her. I know she was. Would she have fallen for something like that? Maybe they didn’t try tricking. Maybe they just grabbed, pulled them away kicking and struggling. Maybe they didn’t make it easy.

There was a whistling noise from the trees. Like birdsong, but lengthened - stretched out. I sat still, listening. Then, movement again, a flash of color. I didn’t know what it could be. I stood up from my chair, the heavy hot haze lifting off me only for me to step cautiously off the porch and onto the grass. I didn’t know why I was moving, why I was looking for whatever was in there. It didn’t matter. I stopped there, and craned my neck to each side trying to get a better look. I could only vaguely see the shape of something indistinguishable in the dark shadows of the trees.

“Is someone there? Hello?”

It was the shape speaking. A person, someone in the woods. I called back to them, stepping forward a bit - as soon as I moved, they retreated into the trees. I saw them bend forward and swiftly move backward, as if they were being dragged by their waist. I started to run forward to the fence, then again:

“Is someone there? Hello?”

Same voice. Same tone. Same inflection. Spoken like a repeating recording. I paused, stopped in my tracks. I swear I stopped breathing, listening for any more movement. I recognized it now. That was Allison’s voice. It was her in there, that flash of color, that yellow, that had been her hair peeking through the leaves. I stepped slowly, quietly, up to the fence. I didn’t want to scare her. The closer I got, the more I saw. She was still standing there, still now, golden hair pristine and curled like it always had been. I couldn’t see much detail, but differing from her perfect hair, her skin was pale. She seemed to sway uneasily on her feet, rocking back and forth in a mesmerizing pattern. I could only see one of her eyes through the foliage, but it was open, staring ahead. Dark, seeing. She did not look at me directly.

“Is someone there?”

Her mouth did not move. I backed up again, silently as possible with the yard overgrown as it was. That was Allison’s hair. Her face, her voice. I even recognized the work uniform she’d been wearing when she went missing, but we’d been right to give her a funeral. She was not alive.

“Hello?”

She moved faster than I’ve ever seen a human move. This was not a human. She didn’t move her legs, she was propelled forward like a puppet on strings, and I realized her feet weren’t touching the ground. I bolted. The yard seemed larger now, giant with Allison’s shoddy replacement moving behind me, tearing through the leaves and branches. My feet wouldn’t move properly, every step felt like I was seconds away from dying, or something, something the same as what happened to her, something like feeling a foreign thing worming its way hungrily into my skin. I hopped up on the porch in one movement and every thump against the wood felt damning. I could feel her hair brush the back of my neck by the time I threw open the door. No breath left her mouth.

I made it inside and I shut and locked the door behind me. I half expected to see nothing when I looked outside. A mysterious ending, a question of if it all really happened. But she lingered there, staring in the window. I could see her more closely now, but I didn’t want to. I can’t give a more detailed description because I shut the blinds and hid in the bathroom until my parents got home rather than look at her.

I don’t know what it was. I don’t know why it came to me, and not anyone else. Why it used Allison. It did, though. It could come for anyone, but it chose me.

Remember to lock your doors. Close your blinds. Don’t walk alone too far from home. Don’t get too close to the outskirts, the dark edges of places you don’t know your way around. You won’t have to see it, then. God, I hope you never see it.

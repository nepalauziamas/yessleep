Sorry for kinda posting in a completely different sub (also I don’t know which flair to use so I guess this one would allow me to continue asking questions for answers??) but like all the news articles on the “Delonia Cartic” cult have just vanished from the face of the earth completely, I had just suddenly remembered about the incident and took to the internet to found out what I was recalling and all the videos seemed okay before, but now, there’s nothing at all. I’d at least expect at least *some* due to how big of a deal it was due to the horrible things found out about it back in about the late 2010’s to like 2013 or some other more later year, yet all, and I mean ALL of the explicit, proven and REAL information has all seemed to have disappeared(??) I haven’t found  anything at all in the (at least somewhat) related sub reddits that had followed the situation throughout the thick and thin at all and they aren’t just lacking a few bits of obscure pieces of  information, it’s all just gone. I can’t find anything on that Murlin guy who (basically) ran it and not even that fucking horrible excuse of a person, that manipulated father and his rather unfortunate son, that one girl who helped get things exposed from the cult out in the open (HUGE props to her man, that was honestly really brave to do for risking her life!). Then there’s that one girl that I can’t even remeber the name of, for the life of me who was one of the many many victims who’s story was told throughout the other girls’ fight for the ending of that cult and that ‘Ichor’ guy who put the unfortunate ‘followers’ into a literal living personalized hell, who was always compared to a literal fucking emoji who had to wear a mask to hide his ugly ass face, the literal most well known guy due to being memed throughout the exposing of the cult for crying out loud! Did they finally manage to falsely copyright it all??? Or like take it down some other way??? I’ve checked like the most obsecurest of videos, sub reddits, articles or literally anything that has covered it. I’ve even tried checking search history to reload pages but it keeps saying “404, page not found” “page could not load” or any of that fucking shit man. Restarting my computer just leads me back to the same problem from the beginning, it just makes it more harder for my patience to keep pushing through this hell of a day to figure this damned mystery out, any other device leads to the same old problem and I don’t have anyone else to ask about this problem either too, which honestly made me realize how lonely and pathetic my life is to be honest. I really just cannot wrap my head around what could’ve happened to it at all, I could understand maybe *one* news article being unfairly taken down by abusing copyright laws, but like what seems to be all of the information on it is just absurd man, could someone fill me in on what happened?

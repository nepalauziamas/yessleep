I should not have left my stuff in that house. Only whatever was still in their boxes were safe. 

My books were damp, my dishes chipped, my posters torn into shreds. Anything made with glass had spider-web cracks along it if it hadn't completely shattered, my desktop monitor no exception. Wisps of smoke came from my PC, and when I opened it up the whole thing had *melted* together. It hadn't even been plugged in yet.

My clothes were missing. This caught my attention, as everything else was still *there* even if they looked like they had been through a lawn mower or thrown off a balcony. Yet my clothes were not where I’d left them.

I checked the closet floor, on every shelf, behind the shelves; every inch of that closet. I felt an eerie prickling on the back of my neck and looked around. In the corner of the master bedroom was a dresser with a square mirror. Thin, rounded legs came out from below at angles. It was not my dresser. It was one of the house's. I had not put any clothes in it when I had unpacked the previous day. 

I stared at my face in the mirror. I didn't like it. It felt like it was looking at me. 

I approached, footsteps soft, hands out like I was approaching a wild animal. At that thought, I said aloud, "Shhh, it's okay. I just want to see if my clothes are in there."

The house, unsurprisingly, did not respond. 

I pulled out the first drawer and the moths spilled out. 

I shrieked. You would have too. There had to be hundreds of the things. Thousands, maybe. More than it seemed possible to fit in that drawer, flying out in clouds of little wings, whirling around my head and I could feel those soft little wings brush my skin.

Done with pretenses, the lower drawers opened on their own without me even looking at them, and even more of those creepy little clothes-eating *things* flew out. They landed on my mattress, the curtains, the walls, on me. 

The drawers sat completely empty. Mocking me. 

"Where are my *fucking* clothes?!" 

The bedroom door behind me slammed open. 

Goosebumps flared up on my skin. Before it felt like the house had been gaslighting me, but this was almost worse. It wasn't you I had been trying to convince that this was happening for real, and it wasn't Kamil - it was me. I had been questioning myself over and over, questioning my senses, what was true, and looking for every speck of proof I could find.

The door opened on its own and I went through it. 

This little bungalow doesn’t really have much of a hallway, just a small one that leads directly into the living room. At the time my attention was caught above me - on the ceiling was a little square entrance to the attic. 

The hatch door swung open. 

"No," I said. 

The ladder tumbled down. 

"*No.*"

The ladder stayed there, but I felt a draft coming through the hole. It got stronger, then one of my shirts fluttered down through the hole and at my feet. I picked it up. 

I did not want to go into the attic.

I don't know how long I stood there, staring up that little ladder. Was it going to kill me up there? Was I going to climb up to find dozens of raccoons tearing apart my clothes? 

I strained to hear, but it was quiet. 

Leave or stay? *Leave or stay?* **Leave or stay?** 

Eventually I mustered up a little bit of defiance and said, “Okay, fuck it. Fine.” I still had to psyche myself up before putting a foot on that ladder but when I did I knew I would have to keep going or I was going to chicken out. 

I scrambled up and poked my head into the attic. There was more furniture that had been made for the house, including the bed-frame that matched the dresser downstairs with a trunk at its foot and a figure lying on it.

"Shit." I don't know why, but I thought whoever was on that bed was alive, and they might have needed help.

I pulled myself into the attic fully and carefully made my way over, unvarnished wood creaking beneath my feet.

The figure was not alive… or a person at all, not really. It was my clothes, tied into knots and squished together in the form of a human figure, wearing clothes of its own that were *not* mine, and a strange wooden mask. 

It was oddly realistic, and familiar. It took me a few seconds to recognize who it was supposed to be. 

"Richardson…?" 

The trunk at the foot of the bed popped open. In it were clothes. Not mine - Nathan R. R. Richardson's, the architect of the house.

"What do you want me to do?" 

The trunk scraped across attic wood towards me. The figure on the bed sat up. 

I backed up.
The figure peeled its mask off, holding it out to me. I looked at the mask, then back at the strange not-Richardson and noticed that its shoulders and build were the same as mine. Thin, lean, tall. Body-wise, we were almost identical. 

I remembered the smile of the real estate agent when I viewed the house. *"Nice high ceilings for someone… how tall would you say you are?" * How I only found out the price after I'd said what my budget was. Was that normal? I’d never bought a house before. I remembered that for some reason I had to submit a photograph when I'd put in my offer. It asked for a full body photograph. I was pretty sure that wasn’t normal, but they said it was just an identification thing.

The clothes-Richardson held out the mask. 

This house was not built for me. It was built for Nathan R. R. Richardson. 

"No," I said. "No, no way."

The planks of wood beneath my feet cracked. The ladder clattered up, closing the attic hatch behind it. The beams along the ceiling groaned as they bended inwards. 

This house was intending to crush me alive, and it could not have been more clear about it. 

With shaking hands and a lump in my throat I took that mask and I put it on. 

The figure fell into pieces. It sounded like the whole place released an exhale and everything settled, the clothes scattering around the bed in that attic. The hatch door behind me opened once again. 

This house was not built for me, so I could no longer be me. I donned his clothes, I started playing his part, and I am getting scars all over my body from when I have messed up and the house had to remind me of who I "really" am. 

I am Nathan R. R. Richardson now. I can't leave. I can't stay. I change into my own clothes in the bathroom at work when I arrive, and I change back into *his* before I go home.

I'm not asking for help. I only wanted to write it all out before I forget who I was.  

I'm writing this now from a friend's account on her phone, since the house does not like when I try to use any of my accounts. Those don’t belong to me anymore. Not once I step through that door, anyway. I have the splinters to reinforce that lesson.

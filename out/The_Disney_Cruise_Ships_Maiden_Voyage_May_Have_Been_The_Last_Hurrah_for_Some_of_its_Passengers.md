"That's odd - why is there a boat with old people next to our cruise ship?" I say to my wife, Julie.

"Your guess is as good as mine. Aren't we like 100 miles from land?"

"Yeah - just about" I reply to Julie.

"It looks like some guy dressed up in some kind of pirate outfit is steering what looks like a ferry boat" Julie says.

"Hah that's odd! The person steering the boat is wearing a skeleton costume it looks like."

"Maybe it's one of those pirate themed ferries?" Julie asks.

"A Ferry themed pirate ship? - never heard of it. I'm not sure how safe a smaller boat like that is in the middle of the ocean with the strong winds and powerful waves?"

"It's definitely out of place and it's getting closer to our cruise ship.  Maybe they just want to get a closer look at our Disney ship's maiden voyage?" Julie asks.

"Their definitely close. Look! It looks like there going to bring them on our ship. Why are they doing that? Aren't we at full capacity already?"

"Yeah - this is really strange. I saw nothing in our itinerary about this happening. Maybe there in some type of emergency situation or something?" Julie says.

"That would make sense. Everyone on the boat looks elderly, though - no one on their boat looks to be in distress.”

We watch as each elderly person is brought onto our cruise ship.  Watching this almost reminds me of cattle being herded.

About 40 minutes later the last elderly person is brought on board of our ship.  Their boat's canopy is hiding the person in the skull outfit, so we can't see him.

Julie and I continue to watch what's going to happen to the boat now.

"Is the guy in the skull outfit going to board our ship, then are they going to just let the boat drift away?" I ask Julie.

"I have no idea!"

"Wait - what the hell is going on now?"  I ask with a puzzled look on my face.

"It looks like guests on our cruise ship are now boarding that ferry boat!" Julie says.

"Why?"

"I have no idea!"

We continue to watch as about 100 people ranging from between 40 and 65 years of age leave our ship.

Then the ferry boat with its new passengers - drifts away with the guy in the skeleton outfit steering the way.

Julie and I go back to the bar and sip on our Margaritas as we discuss the people that were swapped on that ferry boat.

We ask the bartender and it appears she wasn't aware of the situation and couldn't add any insight as to why the swap had occurred.

Julie and I go back to out stateroom and get dressed for dinner.

As we get changed, we discuss the oddity that 90% of our ship’s guest are adults; however Disney cruises are designed for kids.

We come to the conclusion that since this is the maiden voyage and the cruise line opened the bookings  first to anyone who had previously sailed 10 or more past cruises, which would explain the lack of children since most family's can't afford going on multiple Disney cruises, besides people like us who don’t have any kids.

We go to our predetermined restaurant, where we have the same waitstaff each night.

We take a seat at our table "119" and our waitstaff greets us.

A few minutes later - a group of four elderly people sit down next to our table.

"Hah - that's strange - What happened to the couple who has been sitting next to us for the last few days?" Julie whispers to me.

"I saw them get off the ship earlier and go on that ferry boat."

"You did! Did you see these elderly people - sitting next to us - board our ship?" Julie asks me.

"I really wasn't paying close attention to who boarded our ship other than they all had silver hair or no hair and they all looked to be in their 80's."

"Yeah, I kind of noticed that as well."

Our main waiter, Robbie, comes over to our table and I say to him in a soft low voice - "What happened to the couple who were seated next to us - yesterday?"

The waiter looks at the four elderly people now sitting at the table that I was referring to and says "geez - I don't know." 

"Your managers or the scheduling person doesn't tell you about any changes that are going to occur?"

"No, this happens quite frequently and I don't question the table changes. Maybe they weren't happy with my service." Robbie says with a chuckle in his voice.

"No, I saw them get off this ship and get onto what looked like an un-sea worthy ferryboat that initially brought about 100 elderly people onto this boat - including the ones sitting next to us now." I respond.

“Sorry sir, the higher ups don’t tell us anything 1other than our script of what activities are onboard this ship for today.” 

“Okay - if you hear anything please let us know.” I say ending the conversation.

I try not to press Robbie or the other waitstaff because their under a lot of pressure to make sure us and the rest of the guest are having a good experience.

We eat dinner where both Julie and I don’t talk much because we’re both deep in thought of the mystery we witnessed with the people being swapped.

After dinner, we go see one of the broadway show’s that Disney is known for.

“I can’t get over the lack of children on this cruise!” Julie says to me, while we sit in the Walt Disney Theater.

“I wonder if most of these people are like us - not having any children or their children are all grown up?”

Julie pauses to answer this question and I can see the disappointment in her eyes as she looks for a response.

We tried for years to have a kid and eventually we were told by the reproductive doctor that we both had too many issues with our reproductive organs to be able to birth a child.

When our parents were alive, they were deeply disappointed because we both come from small families and we’re both only children.

In fact, both Julie and I have no known relatives.

It just seemed that our Great-grandparents; Grandparents; and our own parents were all so career focused and had time and energy for just one kid.

They essentially put all of their their genetic future in one basket and wound up with us two duds that can’t produce any offspring.

We try to compensate and say things like “God has his own plan for us,” which I’m not sure either of us believe.

Our first night on this cruise, we were bragging to the people next to us in the Star Wars lounge bar that Julie’s Great Grandmother played a pivotal roll in the American Red Cross’ Nurse Corps in France during WW1 but then we got to a point where we both realized that when both of us die no one is going to care about her great grandmother’s legacy and it will be lost forever.

The show ends and I look around at the audience trying to give a standing ovation, which takes longer than expected because most of the people are older and it takes them more time to get up.

After the show, we go out on deck five and enjoy the sea breeze as we look out to the ocean.

We both hold onto the balcony and no more than three minutes go and Julie says “Oh my God - there’s that boat again with that sailor who is dressed in the skull outfit!”

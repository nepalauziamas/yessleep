 

There’s a hole in the living room floor, where my coffee table used to be. It wasn’t there before and I have no clue where it came from or what it does. From time to time I’ve checked to see how deep it goes, by throwing a pen or a coin. I would spend about 5 minutes, maybe longer hearing nothing drop on the ground. I’ve had trouble sleeping because of this hole.

Every night before I go to bed, I fear something will crawl out of it, so every night before I go to bed, I barricade my door, using my dressers and the foot of my bed facing the door, and a gun on my nightstand. Sometimes I think the hole grows bigger with each passing day but I can’t tell. You’re probably wondering what it looks like, I’ll gladly tell you in hopes someone else has had this problem and solved it on their own. It’s a big rectangular shape that has a small hill surrounding the edge, it’s a big void of emptiness, even a flashlight couldn’t shine in there. I’ve tried, that’s how I know.

Sometimes if it’s quiet just enough, I’ll hear a low humming coming from down there. I’ve tried hovering my head over it, but I get too scared and instead try to put my ear against the floor, and when I don’t hear anything, I give up and assume it was from outside or something. I’ve had plenty of problems trying to get rid of this hole, I’ve gotten planks, drywall, flooring pieces, tarp and nothing will work, the hole only ends up consuming everything. It’s why I’m terrified of putting my head over it sometimes. 

Anyways, that’s my description of it. I wanted to write out to anyone who may know about this, it’s been driving me insane recently, the humming has grown louder and new sounds have emerged from it, I’ve been hearing whispering, especially in my sleep, it’s a woman’s voice, it’s soft and angelic, hypnotic even. I’ve been struggling to sleep and sometimes I find myself standing in front of the hole, listening to the humming and the whisper.

“Come in, join me, come with me, look inside, crawl inside, come find me.” She repeats the same thing over and over again. I’ve cried for it to go away and begged even, but it stays. Before you go asking why I haven’t told anyone, I have. I invited my sister over a couple weeks ago. The hole consumed her. I called my sister one night, crying and telling her what was going on, I begged her to come help and see for herself and when she did, almost instantly something was off. Her face was as pale as snow, she was sweating, her hair was stringy and greasy as if she hadn’t showered for days.

“Elizabeth are you okay?” I asked her before inviting her inside, she pushed me aside and stood in front of the hole.

“Ethan.” She said quietly, “Ethan do you hear it?” 

Her eyes didn’t move, she stared at the hole as if her life depended on it. Only then did I notice that the whispering stopped, I haven’t had peace in so long I almost cried, 

“Ethan,” She asked me again, “The whispering, do you hear it? I started to hear it when we were on the phone, I heard her.” Elizabeth looked as though she was in a trance. “She begged me to come here and save her.” Finally she took her gaze off from the hole and then at me. She looked determined, and while I had the chance I had a better view of her features, her cheeks were sunken in and so were her eyes. I could almost see her rib cage through her bare skin, her shirt hung loosely off of her. I came to realize that no one has seen Elizabeth in months, we’ve only gotten calls, and she’s always made an excuse to not see us, now I know why. She turned back to face hole, slowly getting onto her knees and leaning into the hole, “She’s calling to anyone who will help her, I’m one of them Ethan, she’s been calling me for so long. She needs us and she chose you to keep her safe. I’ve been hearing her whispers, telling me to come find her, to help her.” Elizabeth held her hand in for a few seconds, and I saw a hand reach out for her, grabbing her shoulder and slowly pulling her inside. Her body went slump, being dragged into the empty void. I finally sprint into action, grabbing her ankles and pulling her out. I screamed and let go, because when I pulled her out, the top half of her body became as black as the void in my floor, almost a complete shadow, I thought it had disappeared. On top of that, ash gray arms clawed onto her body, slowly dragging her back into the void, I stumble backwards, watching Elizabeth disappear. I panic, I didn’t know what else to do, the world went completely silent, after 5 minutes of silent shock, I rush to my phone, calling my mother, frantically telling her what happened.

“Ethan, honey slow down!” She says in a playful tone, what is wrong with her? I’m telling her Elizabeth died right in front of my eyes, and she’s laughing?

“Mom this is serious!” I yell angrily.

“Honey,” she said in a dead serious tone, “You don’t have a sister.” My heart dropped to my stomach, but I do and she was here, her car is here in my driveway, I have pictures, baby photos, how do I not have a sister, “Hello? Ethan? Ethan, honey, call me back later okay?” The line drops, I’m left alone staring at the void. I fall to my knees and I listen, for anything, for humming, for whispering. Nothing, I received nothing. I didn’t know what else to do but sit there in shock, that’s why I’m writing this. I need help, I can’t just leave, it won’t let me. I’ve had people knocking on my door from time to time begging to be let in, begging to save whatever is in the hole. Sometimes they leave and never return, other times they come back hoping I’ll oblige.

The whispering has returned, I haven’t been able to sleep properly, and the humming is somehow louder than before, it’s all I hear.

“Ethan.” I stare at the void, it has never called my name before, “Help us, please, she needs us, find us Ethan. Come inside and find us.” I scream at the void, I curse at it as it used my sisters voice to manipulate me.

“Leave me alone!” I yelled, “What do you fucking want from me!?” Then it went silent again, no humming, no whispering. After a few long silent minutes it spoke.

“Feed me.” It said, the hypnotic and angelic voice finally spoke by itself, “Feed me.” And as if on cue a knock at my door.

“Please, let me in, I need to help her, she needs me.” It was a young woman, at least it sounded like one, my eyes slowly drifted to the door.

“Feed me.” The void spoke again.

“I need to help her please let me in.” The woman begged, I slowly get up, inching towards my door, each agonizing step pained me to do this.

“Feed. Me.” It spoke slower and deeper.

“Please!” Begged the woman, I slowly open the door, this woman looked just like my sister. Her cheeks sunken, so we’re her eyes, her skin as pale as snow, she was sweaty, stringy and greasy hair. I open my door wide enough to let her walk through, she steps inside. I turn to watch what she does, she got onto her knees, dipping her hand in the void. I watched as the ash gray hands clawed at her shoulder, dragging her into its nest. I listen to my door slowly close shut, my house awaiting its next meal, and the void only ever spoke to words ever again when someone came knocking on my door.

“Feed. Me.”

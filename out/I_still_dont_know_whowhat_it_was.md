I have no explanations for what I'm about to write below, but if any of you lived something similar, don't hesitate to tell me how you dealt with it.. 

So I've lived in this house for less than 2 years.
We've been in there with my mom and my step father, he was a really kind man who always treated me like his own daughter, he knew me since I was 3 (I insist on this because it's one of the reason I knew something was wrong).

We moved in this house but from the beginning, it never really felt like home. There was this feeling like there was someone watching you all the time, breathing in you're neck.
It didn't took long for me to see it, he was sitting on the window sill, just in front of my bed. During more than a year, I saw it every night. I first thought it was the shadow of the moon as I had another window in my room, but I changed my mind when I covered the 2 windows and it was still there.

I started not only to see it, but to hear it. I felt it was always behind me when I was home. I was so desperate at one point that I shouted at it asking what it wanted from me, as the only answer, it tilted its head from a side to the other.

Our neighbour, who lived in our house when she was a little girl once came by to ask us to take care of her cat when she was gone during her holidays. They started talking with my mom (I was not there) and when my mom told her I was feeling uncomfortable and seeing things, our neighbour froze and juste said "Oh, she saw it too huh?". Great.

I don't know if I must say it or he. It was not a object but neither a human. Some shadow with a kind of human body and a really old hat.

The night before we moved out, my mom slept on the couch in the living room underneath my room. She heard like someone was dancing/jumping of joy in my room. There was nothing left in it, this night I slept in another room because all of my furnitures were already in our new appartement. 

My step father changed the second we moved in this freacking house. He was becoming violent, mean, to me and my mom. I talked to him about how he was in this house years later and he assured me he didn't remember anything I was saying.

As we noticed that men were particularly getting aggressive around the house, years after we moved out, I decided to take a test. One of my best friend and I were just walking in our village, and I decided to stop by my old house. I pretended to have hurted my feet so we could rest on a wall in front of the house. He didn't knew about it, and after a few minutes he told me we had to leave immediately. My best friend, who's the most chill and none-agressive person in this world looked me right in the eyes and told me "we have to leave, otherwise I'll hurt you". 
And just when we leaved, he was feeling better again.

10 years later, I'm still looking for answers, who or what was it?

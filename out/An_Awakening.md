 I dont even know where to start..I remember waking up in my room. "Mom! Dad!" I shouted as I climbedout of bed. I quickly ran downstairs looking for my parents. "Woah!!" I loudly yelped as I fell. "Huh? What's this? Ew it's all sticky" I sighed in utter disgust. It looked like ketchup, but darker and more liquid like. I paused. "Mom! Did you spill some ketchup?" I yelled unsure if it was really ketchup. I looked in my parents rooms direction. The door was shut and the house was dead silent. "Dad?" The ketchup was in a trail to their door. "M-mom?" I got up and walked up to my parents door and knocked slightly. I knoagain but louder as if I was expecting my parents to open the door with a mop. They would tell me everythings alright and i was just being paranoid. I tried to open the door hoping to see them sleeping. The door was locked but I had a key. As soon as I opened the door tears quickly filled my eyes. I ran away unable to erase the image from my mind. I'm not sure I'll ever forget it. I ran and hid behind a tree as I called 911. "Ethan~" I heard my mom say in a crazed voice that shook me. I had never heard her say anything like that, she was always so caring and sweet. I stopped replying to the 911 operator. "Shh.." I wispered to the phone tears falling from my eyes my voice was shaking. I covered my mouth so I wouldn't give away my spot. As my mom disappeared from view I started telling the operator everything. The cops would be arriving in 4 minutes but I was scared. This was the first time I had ever seen my mother like that. My mom soon appeared again but heard the sirens getting closer so she disappeared into the forest. I got up and ran to the cop car sobbing. They asked for my name. "Ethan rosewood" the cops took me to the station and had me answer some questions "why is there blood on your clothes", "did she show any sign of insanity?", "where did she go" standard stuff. I had answers for nearly every question. I was picked up my aunt, she had heard and was the only was available. I stayed with her until I was 19 then I lived on my own. I had forgotten about my parents after a year or two but I always had a feeling someone was watching me. One day I was holding my daughter, Cammit, when I spotted my mom's figure in the window. "Dear? Are you ok?" My wife asked. "I-i'm fine" I felt uneasy and that night I had trouble getting to sleep. So I went to the back yard to clear my mind. They still hadn't caught her. "Ethan.. you abandoned your poor old mommy~" she cried as she stepped into vision. "M-mom why?!" I screamed, terrified. I grabbed my knife and put it to her throat. "Get out of here before I call the cops!" I yelled angerly. I heard sirens and quickly restrained my mother. My wife had heard yelling so she looked out the window. "Bye sweetheart" my mom as she got out of my grasp and ran. I was terrified. I was brought back to the station and back into questioning  I told them how she looked and two cop cars were stationed outside my house. "Can we visit my Aunt?" "Sure tomorrow though I'm too tired right now." "Ok goodnight Cam" "Night Ethan". We slept but I was soon awaken to my mom hovering over me. She had somehow snuck into my house. I quickly kicked her to slow her down and woke up my wife she ran to the bath and I got Cammit. That's where I am now. I don't know if I'll survive. But I can't let my family get hurt by my mother. Especially Cammit. "Camila.. we'll survive I swear" I said that to comfort her she was crying, it scares Cammit and will lead my mother to us. I'm trying to calm Cammit. As well as Camila. Mt mom is banging on the door now. The crying is louder. I don't think I'll survive I'm making this as a plea. If my family survives help them!

*SNAP!*

Droplets of blood sprinkled through the air as the window slammed shut.

My ass had hit the ground hard and it felt like the grass underneath me was holding my body in place. My eyes began flicking away from the blood stained glass for 2 or 3 seconds before snapping back to the window. Still no sign of Perry or Ingrid.

I began to slowly butt scoot some distance away from the building before finding my feet underneath me and half rising onto them.

That’s when I noticed the sounds of the jungle, or rather the lack of. The clearing that I was in the middle of was completely silent. I looked towards the edge of the clearing where the jungle began and I could see a few birds perched in trees, a pair of monkeys scampering, and some type of lizard sunbathing on a rock. I could almost feel the distant rumble of life coming from the density of the jungle.

But like night and day, the clearing seemed to be the opposite of the vibrating masses of trees and green. Empty, quiet, barren, dead. Crouched down, with my eyes still fixed on the building I began to slowly shuffle so that I could see through the window straight on and hopefully get an idea of who or what was in there.

The window remained unchanged from when it slammed shut, it’s gray and decaying frame barely strong enough to hold the glass in place which had a crack running down the middle. The blood oozing from inside had slowed to a drip now.

I was about 10 yards from the window when I was facing it head on. The inside was too dark to see much of anything that the window provided. Plus, my eyesight was never something to boast about.  I creeped forward, slower than I’ve done anything in my life.

*Step*

*Step*

I was closer now and I could see a dim color emanating from the depths of the room.

*Step*

*Step*

Halfway there. I was no longer thinking about Perry and the other one. What was her name? I couldn’t think. There’s something on the other side of that window. I can sense it. I don’t want to see it. I have to know.

*Step*

*Step*

I took my final steps. A red, pinkish mass barely visible in the middle of the all-encompassing darkness of the room beyond the window. I pushed my face up to the glass and raised my hands to block out glare from the setting sun.

The room was small but tidy. Well not really tidy, more so... empty. No furniture, no lights, not a chair, or table in sight. I looked at the ground. Rotted wooden planks made up the floor inside where not a dust-bunny was present. I squinted, narrowing my eyes trying to see more than what the absence of light was allowing.

Blood. A lot of it. Decorating the floor starting at the window from where I was looking in, and trailing back in a straight line. Slowly, along the ground I followed it with my eyes. It continued all the way to the back of the room. The pink and red mass. I could vaguely see a shape now but the room was still too dark for me to clearly see. I felt for my phone in my pocket and gripped it tightly ready to turn on its flashlight. I had to see it. I don’t know where the other two people I came with were. They should be fine though they’ve known each other for a long time. Right? Yea. We all grew up together how could I forget. My thoughts had begun to seem strange but I couldn’t force them to quiet down rather they swirled through my head like a blender. *I had to know.*

I gripped the window with both hands and pulled upwards. It was stuck but it popped open an inch or two and I tensed my legs to get ready to throw the window open completely. But the smell that escaped from the room was enough to make me fold over and heave into the grass. I watched my vomit mix with the blood on the ground in front of me, creating a disgusting cocktail of fluids that left the foliage and grass a sick orange color.

This smell wasn’t completely foreign to me. I remember I had visited a slaughterhouse with my dad once. I watched a cow get sliced from throat to groin and it’s insides spill to the floor, tumbling over each other like wet, red noodles. It made a sound like throwing a sopping wet towel onto the ground, a sickening splat. The smell afterward was stomach churning; a mixture of death, blood and feces fighting for the attention of your nostrils, no escape from it. Breathing through your mouth was worse cause you could taste it.

I took a rag out of my pocket and wrapped it around my face over my nose. I gave myself a minute to control my breathing and get used to the smell before I turned my flashlight on, aimed and peered into the room once more. A second before my beam reached the end of the room where the blood led, I heard a noise from within. An inhuman squeal.

*REEE*

My flashlight had found the source of the blood. The hog was laying on its stomach and gore flowed from underneath its bloated body. Blood covered the entirety of its pink body and it had deep intentional gashes that patterned its pink flesh. Most noticeably, a slash on the nape of its neck, half decapitating him. The pig would attempt to move and heave its body to no avail, causing its nearly severed head to roll and twist at impossible angles, each time the sound of tearing flesh could be heard as the head became more and more detached from the body. Yet it was still alive. It would attempt to raise itself onto its legs but would make it a few inches off the ground before collapsing to the scarlet ground it lay on. Each time it’s body lifted off the ground, blood would pour across the floor and tendrils of intestines were visible hanging from a wound on its stomach.

My pulse was racing and I felt pain in my chest. It was getting hard to breathe, was this a heart attack?

The mutilated animal squealed again. *REEEEEE*

What am I doing here, why am I here? Fucking Jonestown.

The hog seemed to notice me and shifted its dangling head in my direction. I could see the strands of glistening, wet flesh desperately trying to hold its head onto its body.

Why did I come to this godforsaken place alone. I remembered I have no friends.

I shut my eyes.

***“LoOK at ME”***

My eyes opened. I stopped breathing. A primal fear seized my whole being. How...

The pig was now standing on its hind legs facing me. It even made eye contact with me. Its tongue lolled around hanging from its open mouth and it seemed to have a crooked, inhuman smile on its face.

It took a step towards me, walking with perfect balance. A loop of intestines fell out of its stomach and its head bounced with a meaty tearing sound.

***“yyyeeeeess   You will do NiCely”***

It snorted and took one more step towards the window I looked in from.

“***I have CAlled    And noW you LiSten”***

I was freezing cold now. Sweating profusely and shaking, paralyzed from the brain down. All I could do was think. But...

I could feel its words creeping into my mind, latching, drowning out my own original thoughts. I could... actually feel it. Reaching into my conscious and wrapping its gnarled hand around my sanity. Squeezing. Gripping. Tightening.

The towering hog now raised its arm, aiming its hoof at me.

“***yOu--”***

*“I--”*

***“ARe--”***

*“will--”*

***“MINE”***

*“obey---”*

Hands gripped my shoulders from behind while I passed out.

I woke up to Perry face in front of mine. I was being shaken out of my sleep.

I looked up at the sky and saw the sun slowly reaching towards the horizon, promising to set soon. I sat up and shoved Perry off of me.

“Where are we!?” I yelled. I looked around and saw Ingrid watching me with an expression of worry on her face. I also noticed that we were only a few meters away from the building and... the window. I stood up and stumbled away trying to run but tripping over my own feet and crashing to the ground.

“Relax, relax,” Perry said soothingly, his blue and calm eyes combatting some of the fear coursing through my veins. “You’ve been out for a few minutes.”

“We gotta get the fuck away from that window,” I sputtered. “We gotta get the fuck away from this place.” I remembered how I had just thought how I had come here alone. Why did I think that? What’s going on. Where is that... thing.

“The pig,” I pointed at the window with drying blood on it now. “Did you guys see it? Where did it go?” I really had to slow down and catch my breath.

“Yea, its still in there,” Ingrid said with a look of disgust on her face.

“It ain’t doing much though, I’ll be honest,” Perry added still studying me.

“Wha-. Where were you?”

“We found a secret hatch leading to some sort of library. Sorry, but we were only gone for a couple minutes. You were saying some weird things though... we found you standing at that window. You were gripping the wood so hard your hands were sheet white. You were whispering stuff like, ‘I will obey’ and ‘rise of -’ …"

But I was soon out of earshot, as I had started walking towards the window. The blood had nearly dried now, painting the wall below the window.

*How the fuck could a hog that big even get through a window like that.*

I stopped right outside the window. I was standing in my own vomit, but I didn’t care. Inside the room was now a table. And on the table remained the pigs head. The wound below the pigs neck made it seem as though the head was torn or ripped off. The body was no where in sight but those fuckers eyes were looking directly at me, frozen in place at the perfect height to match my eyes when standing straight up.

It knew. I know that it knew

I could see the entirety of the room now, and there seemed to be more light inside. Besides the table, there was one more thing that wasn’t there before.

&#x200B;

The blood trail... it continued past the table... and out a door in the back corner of the room.

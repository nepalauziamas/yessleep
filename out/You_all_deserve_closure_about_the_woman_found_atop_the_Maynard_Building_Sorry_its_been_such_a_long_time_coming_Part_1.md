I have a confession to make. 

Back in 2009, as I’m sure a lot of you will remember, the badly mangled body of a younger blonde woman was found on top of a building downtown. She was kitted out in skydiving gear, but instead of a parachute there was a tarp, a rainbow tarp, and it was obviously not enough to do much. She tumbled down to her demise. 

But where it got interesting was during attempted identification. I’m sure this is where you will all recall the web theories dancing across the forums at that time. Everything from her dental records to tattoos on her wrist and inner upper arm to DNA itself linked her to a woman living 45 miles north, in the suburbs. She requested anonymity and was granted it. The woman was adopted at birth, and it was ultimately deemed that she must’ve had an identical twin that no one knew about. Still, what are the odds that they’d get identical tattoos and have the same dental history? Who knows. Everyone and their brother gets tattoos these days, and I guess dental health is largely genetic. Weird, but vaguely plausible. The existence of a twin basically made this case unsolvable. Attempts were made to find the birth mother but unfortunately those lead to a grave. The agency was long shuttered, records scattered and shockingly poor. I think The Times did an expose on that. A call for info was fruitless. The case went cold. 

Of course the paranormal forums went nuts. And that’s why I’m posting here. As a bunch of paranormal sleuths, you all deserve the truth. I also know why, but not how, the story has totally vanished from the web. Even WebArchive comes up empty. I don’t think even the best PR company could do that. 

I know who that woman was. I never dared say anything because I feared for my life. Why talk now? Well, I recently found out it’s back again. Acute myeloid leukemia. I’ve already had two bone marrow transplants (one of which was just a few weeks ago) and just do not feel up for a third that is very unlikely to work anyway. I have lung problems from my last transplant as well, and have decided to go on General Inpatient Hospice here. She can’t get me, and I will die here, with a drip and surrounded by people I wanna be around. So may as well spill the beans. 

The woman found atop the Maynard Building downtown’s name was Jennifer Amanda Roberts. She really was adopted, yes, but she was not a twin. And although the woman found looked human, tested like a human DNA wise, and presumably fooled a few folks in white coats, that woman was most definitely something else entirely. 

I know you are all sleuths, and to really get this story, I think I gotta start in the beginning, which would’ve been August of ’09. 

I was working as a mental health aid in the pediatric wing of a psychiatric hospital. I loved the patients but I was utterly beyond burned out.

One day was particularly rough (a caller who identified as a patient’s godmother on the phone ripped into me), and that night, I had a dream. Funnily enough, I was skydiving, but something was wrong with the parachute. No matter what I did, it just wouldn’t behave like a parachute. 

I was big into dream interpretations then, and interpreted this to mean that I was flailing through life due to work stress and needed a change before I crashed. 

So, I whipped out my iPhone 3G and went on Indeed, and began looking. One job just kept standing out to me; I think it was a paid advert in retrospect because it was atop every page. It was for the Lyndon Home, a group home for kids and adolescents who had nowhere to go and/or needed a little bit of basic mental health support. Just a sort of rest home, they said, which I thought was odd wording, but it sounded great. I wondered how much easier my own adolescence would’ve been if such a retreat had existed then. Plus, hey, they offered nearly twice the pay, which was a plus. 

I sent in my application to there, and a few dozen other places. 

Several got back to me, and offered interviews, including Lyndon. Well, I guess the phrasing was a little different for some. The one from Lyndon never said interview. Just said “We’d love to meet you!” 

I did a few interviews, then it was time for Lyndon. 

I got there 15 minutes early, and when I stepped in, I was greeted by a perky receptionist who immediately went, “Hey!!!! You must be Stephanie!” I greeted her back-she introduced herself as Anna-and asked if I needed to sign in somewhere. “No silly!” said she, passing me-to my shock-an ID badge with my name and picture on it, and a lanyard. The picture was from my LinkedIn. Super odd, but I guess the place was super secure. 

The strangeness of that soon faded anyway, as she led me into a conference room with cake and balloons. A beaming blonde woman who appeared to be in her mid-sixties glided over to me, stuck out her arm, and introduced herself as Candice, the director. “We are so happy to have you aboard! In honor of your onboarding, we are throwing you a getting to know me party!” 

I was very confused. Wasn’t this an interview? Was she telling me I was hired? I’d heard of being hired on the spot but this was another level. 

Poppy, the head of HR, soon made that clear as she passed me my insurance/benefits info. Shortly thereafter, Anna gave me a copy of my schedule. I somehow knew better than to question any of this. 

The most comfortable person to be around who I found at the party was Jennifer. Nothing is creepier than normalcy where there shouldn’t be, and she was the only one who wasn’t acting like all of this was normal. She nursed her soda gingerly, and I began chatting to her. Everyone else seemed to be chatting amongst themselves, so this didn’t stand out as far as I could tell. 

We made some small talk, then she invited me over for some dinner after this whole event. We exchanged numbers, and then we heard Candice ding a fork against her glass. She announced me as our newest “guardian counselor” on the day shift. 7am-7pm, 3 times per week. I’d start work the following day. My eyes widened at this, but still continued on. Again, I knew somehow I had to go along with this rather aggressive recruitment. 

I did go to Jennifer’s home that night. She had some spaghetti cooked for us and a glass of red wine. We ate in the living room in front of the TV, watching some series on DVD. She then began telling me about the place. 

“Yeah, what they did to you there is what they did to me. There’s something off you know. I don’t think it’s all…above board. The kids have no families. At all. It’s not a trafficking ring either-we did check into that. But when I looked into the kids I-“

Suddenly her eyes widened and she stared, absolutely transfixed on the bay window by her door. I glanced behind me and saw a face, wide eyed with rage, screwed into a frown, with hair unkempt with brambles and needles from nearby foliage embedded into the short dirty blonde locks. Her lips appeared thin, and downward turned, completing her frown that hinted at barely-restrained rage. It honestly took me a second to realize who she was. It was Candice. 

Jennifer was shaking and crying at that point. I was super creeped out. Jennifer finally stammered out, “I’m screwed, I’m so screwed. Don’t quit okay, just don’t, just do what she says okay.” I planned to quit but entertained her. “You have an opportunity right now. Be nice to Candice. You have an opportunity I don’t.” 

“I mean I know we are at-will, but what is she gonna tell HR? ‘Yeah I was spying outside her house and heard her talk smack?’ Will she really fire you?” Jennifer gave me a wan smile, the sort you give a little kid who has no idea what they’re babbling about. 

Jennifer called out sick the next day. I actually did exactly as I was told by her, which surprised even myself. Candice didn’t mention that night, or anything about it really. I began to wonder if I’d dreamt the whole thing. I texted Jennifer a bit; she texted me back so much that I really thought that she must be okay. I figured the stress of having her enraged boss in her bay window must’ve made her ill. But when I mentioned it to her, she acted like it hadn’t happened. And if that was gaslighting, it worked. I was questioning my perceptions. 

Jennifer was back after 5 days, and I swear something was off about her. So, I mean when I heard about that case of the woman, I knew. I also knew not to say anything. Candice killed her somehow and replaced her. She also got a little tired of us all talking about it, but I know it must live on in your memories even though its’ gone from the web, right? Can any longtime true crime/mystery/paranormal buffs confirm or deny this for me? 

Honestly, that whole place indeed is off, including the kids.  

And every time I thought to look into it, I’d have another dream about failing parachutes and tumbling down, down, down towards an unforgiving concrete jungle. 

But I did it, and Candice can’t do a darn thing about it.

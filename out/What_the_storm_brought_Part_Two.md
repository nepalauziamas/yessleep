“What do we do?”  

Hattie was looking up at me, her face concerned but not quite scared.  She didn’t understand what the nail meant exactly, not like I was afraid I did, and she also trusted me to fix it, or at least know what to do.  

The thing was, I had no idea what to do.  My first instinct was to throw it away, throw it all away.  The box and its contents felt dangerous and wrong, and at some core level I felt like so long as we had possession of it, we wouldn’t be safe from that woman.  That led to my next thought, which was the police.  If she really was dangerous—either a serial killer with a box full of trophies or just some nut that collected weird, gross things—the cops might be able to find her and stop her before she hurt someone…or at least someone else.

Those were a lot of ifs and mights, though, and while I didn’t consider myself worldly at eighteen, I didn’t know that anyone would buy that the frail old woman I’d encountered was someone to be afraid of, at least when she was making a point of acting harmless.  And if I was right, and she *was* really bad, did I want to involve the police if they weren’t going to believe us or be effective at stopping her?

That left our parents.  I was planning to tell them from the start, but I was beginning to think that they were the *only* people we could tell that might believe us or at least take it seriously enough that the woman wouldn’t be allowed to come around again.  Trying to look confident, I gave Hat a smile.

“We’re going to tell Mom and Dad, that’s what.  I’ll go get them now and we can show them the box.”  Hattie was already looking more anxious, and I reached out to give her arm a comforting squeeze.  “Hey, it’ll be okay.  They won’t be mad, and we need them to know about this.  They don’t need to think that lady is safe to be around.”

Hattie’s eyes got bigger.  “You don’t think she’s safe?”

I shrugged, trying to sound more nonchalant than I felt.  “I don’t know, but I know she’s weird to have a box like this.  And some times weird people, especially weird strangers, can be dangerous, right?”  She nodded slowly, her face grave.  “And you know to not go around her, right?  And if you see someone that you think might be her, you tell me or Mom or Dad or whatever adult is around you can trust.  Right?”

She nodded gravely.  “I promise.”  And then she added in a lower voice that was thickening with fear.  “I don’t want to see her.”

I squeezed her arm again.  “Probably you won’t.  But once we show them the box, they’ll know not to let her come back again.”  I had already put the fingernail back in the box, and now I closed the lid.  “Okay, I’ll go get them.  Be right back.”

Opening her door, I could already hear raised voices from downstairs.  Mom and Dad were arguing.  Yelling at each other, though I couldn’t make out exactly what it was about.  I felt the center of my stomach growing cold.

It wasn’t that they never argued, but it was rare, and rarer still that we actually heard them.  And this fight…it was different somehow.  There was a sad, angry desperation on both sides, and the little scraps I made out was something about “why won’t you tell me” and “Just be honest”.  I took a step forward and the floor made a loud squeaking noise underfoot.  I froze, wincing, and then eased backward into Hattie’s room.  When I turned around, she looked more worried than before.

“Are they mad?”

I gave her a smile I didn’t feel.  “Yeah, I think so, but not at us.  They’re just fighting about something.  Probably something dumb, right?  We’ll let them argue tonight, and when it’s blown over, *then* I can tell them about the box.  Sound good?”

She eyed the box like it was some kind of dangerous animal tensed and ready to strike.  “I guess so.”

I nodded.  “Yeah, it’ll be fine.  I’ll take the box into my room tonight, and tomorrow I’ll show it to them.  And don’t worry.  One way or the other, we’ll get rid of it soon.”

**** 

The next day I knew something was different.  Part of it was obvious.  Dad had spent the night in the guest room, and while both he and Mom talked to us as we ate breakfast and got ready for school, they ignored each other almost completely.  I still had the box on my mind, but I was more worried about my parents that morning.  This wasn’t like them, and when Dad asked if I wanted a ride to school with Hattie or if I was driving, I told him I had something I had to finish at home first and for them to go ahead.  When they were gone, I found Mom again.  She was in their bedroom, her eyes raw and red as she wiped at her cheek and stood up as though to make up the bed.

“Mom, what is it?  What’re you fighting about?”

She shook her head as she focused on pulling the comforter into place.  “Oh, you know.  Parents fight sometimes, honey.”

“I know, but these seems different.  I just want to make sure everything is okay.”

She stood back up but stayed turned away from me as she spoke.  Her voice had a wavering, watery quality that hurt and made me scared, made me feel younger than I felt most of the time.  “I don’t think so, honey.  Your father…well, a woman came by the other day and well…your father made a mistake with her.”

I frowned into her back.  “The old woman?”

Mom jerked slightly and then gave a shaky laugh.  “No, I think this was some young woman.”  Her voice took on a harder edge.  “Young and pretty if I had to guess.”  She shrugged.  “He says he doesn’t know why it happened or how, but he knows it did and he’s sorry.  Like that makes it better.”  Stiffening slightly, she turned and looked at me with an anxious look.  “I don’t mean to dump this on you.  This is our problem.  We’ll fix it.  I…I know you’re almost grown, but you shouldn’t have to worry about this kind of stuff.  Not yet, anyway.”

Stepping forward, I gave her a hug.  “It’s okay, Mom.  Shit.  I know it’s not good that it happened, but I mean at least he was honest about it.”  I felt my face flush.  “Not that I’m saying that makes it okay.  I just…people do make mistakes, don’t they?”

“They do.”

“Are you guys going to stay married?”

There was a pause and then she pulled away.  “You need to get to school.  Please don’t mention any of this to Hat, okay?”

Stomach churning, I nodded as I backed toward the door.  I wanted to talk more, to argue for them  working things out, to find Dad and yell at him, demand that he fix this for himself, for all of us.  Instead I left out of there sad and scared, the box the storm had brought the farthest thing from my mind.

**** 

The next week was one of the worst of my life.  Things just got worse between our parents.  They weren’t even fighting anymore, and every day I saw Hattie getting more upset and feeling the same dread building up inside myself.  Our family was dying from the inside, and I didn’t know if I could stop it.  Finally, after putting it off for days, I got my Dad alone and talked to him.  I tried to keep an even tone—I’d had to fight to keep the anger and resentment out of my interactions with him the last few days, and having to actually talk about it with him was a hundred times worse.  We were standing out at our burn barrel when I just blurted it out, my voice thick with the anger and sadness I’d been trying and failing to swallow.

“Why did you cheat on Mom?”

He looked surprised for a moment, then there was a flash of anger.  I thought he was going to yell at me or try to defend himself, but instead his face crumpled as he began to cry.  “I don’t know.”  He shook his head slowly as he stared into the fire between us.  “I’ve never done anything like that before.  Never *wanted* to either.  This girl came by, probably in her mid-twenties, and she…I don’t remember why she said she was coming by.  But she was so beautiful and friendly and I…I don’t know what happened.  Not really.  I just remember being behind the barn with her.  And then she was gone, and I was so ashamed.”  He looked up and met my eyes.  “So scared of losing all of you.”

I just stared at him.  I didn’t think he was lying, though he’d never been one of those dads that was always flirting with women or acting weird or sketchy.  But what he was saying didn’t make a lot of sense either.  “So what?  Are you saying you blacked out?  Like she roofied you or something?”  I raised an eyebrow.  “I don’t think Mom is going to buy that.”

He shook his head, his expression darkening.  “No, I’m not…I don’t know what I’m saying.  I just don’t know why I did it.  Not just like I regret it, but like I can’t remember how it happened.”  He shrugged.  “Not that it matters.  Your mother won’t believe me, not that I blame her.  And…”  He rubbed his face as he let out a tired sigh.  “She’s been with someone else too.”

“What?  What the fuck are you talking about?”

Dad caught my eye again for a second and then dropped his gaze to the fire again.  “I don’t know.  Not exactly.  She hasn’t told me who, but I knew something was up the night we fought.  Then a couple of nights later I tried to find out more.  It kept bugging me, things she’d said that first night, and when I pushed her, she admitted that something…well, inappropriate had happened between her and someone else.  Very recently.”

“Shit.  She wouldn’t say who?”

He let out a bitter laugh.  “To be honest, I’m not sure she even knows herself.”  His voice sounded uneven and strange.  “Something isn’t right here.  Something hasn’t been right here since that damned storm.  I thought…”  His words grew thicker as he turned to look at the ruined barn.  “I thought we got off easy, but maybe not.  It’s like…”

“The box!”

He broke off and stared at me.  “What?”

I felt waves of hot and cold roll through me as I started pacing on my side of the barrel.  “The box!  Hattie found a box.  The storm blew it here.  I think it’s what that old woman wanted, but we didn’t know we had it, because Hattie had it upstairs.”

He frowned at me.  “Son, that’s fine, but I don’t really care about that damned woman’s b-“

I cut him off again.  “You don’t understand.  I looked in it.  *We* looked in it.  Hattie and me.  There’s all kinds of weird shit in there.  Watches and jewelry.  Teeth.  Like human teeth.  And a fingernail that looks like it was ripped out with pliers.  Not a fake one.  A real nail ripped out with meat on the end.”

His frown deepened.  “I don’t have it in me to listen to bullshit right now.”

I shook my head.  “It’s not.  I’m telling the truth.  I…I was going to tell you both about it, but that was the night you were fighting, and I guess I forgot since then.  I don’t know how, but I must have.  But…but maybe that old woman is crazy.  Like a killer or something.  Maybe she’s fucking with us because we have her box.”

Dad was silent for a few moments, and when he spoke, his voice was heavy with sadness.  “I wish that was true.  And that old woman was weird, no doubt.  But I can’t blame what I’ve done, or what your mother has done, on her.  How could she be responsible for it?  It makes no sense.”

I spoke softly but firmly now.  If I’d felt like a child talking to my mother days earlier, I felt like the adult now, the parent.  “Less sense than both of you cheating on each other in a matter of days?  You’re not like that.  Neither of you are.  You’re both better and smarter than this.”

“Well, people…”

“And how did Mom meet them?  Did she say?”

He stared off for a second as his face paled.  “I think she said they were looking for something.  She…she told me she couldn’t remember exactly.”  Dad looked at me again.  “Oh fuck.  I think the woman that came here…that I…I think she was looking for something too.  Just like the old lady.”  He seemed lost as he looked toward the house and then the barn.  “Why didn’t I remember that until now?  What’s wrong with me?”

I walked closer and touched his arm.  “We need to get that box.  Get it and give it back to her.  See if that stops it.”

Giving my hand a pat, he nodded.  “Yeah.  I…yeah. Where is it?”

“In the back of my closet.”

**** 

I dug through everything in the closet twice before Dad took over there while I checked other spots in the room.  “It has to be here somewhere.  I know I put it in that damn closet.”  Mom and Hattie had come home a few moments earlier, and now I heard my sister’s soft footfalls as she came upstairs.  “Hattie, come here!”

Looking sad and nervous, Hat stepped into the doorway, her eyes going between our father in my closet and me looking sweaty and frazzled from digging around under my bed with no success.  “What’re you doing?”

Dad stood up and stepped out of the closet door, and while he still looked freaked out, he kept his voice even when he spoke to her.  “Hattie honey?  Do you know where that box is?  The one you told your brother about?”

Her lower lip trembled slightly as she nodded.  “Yeeeah.  Don’t…don’t be mad, daddy.”

He shook his head as he kneeled down next to her.  “No, no. We’re not going to be mad.  We just need to find it.  Where is it, baby?”

She shook her head.  “It’s not here.  It…it…”  Eyes shining, she looked from him to me, as though I’d understand more quickly than she could explain it to him.  “It was bad.  It was making everything bad.  So I put it in the trash the day the trash man came.”

Dad and I shared a desperate look.  That would have been like two days ago, and even if we could find the dump our trash was taken to, how would we ever find the box in there?  

Still, we had to try.  Maybe if we called we could…

Downstairs, the doorbell rang, and a moment later, Mom called up to us.

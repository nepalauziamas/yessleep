I found a new restaurant on uber eats and caved when the app gave me a coupon code... I ordered from it and fat fingered the tip lol.

The delivery person is thinking they'll get $100.00... but I can't afford this lol, anyone have any idea how to fix this? They'll be here in fifteen minutes.

EDIT: So I looked up the restaurant to call them and it turns out I can't find it. It's probably a 'ghost kitchen' as one of you pointed out that doesn't have any physical stores. I'm just going to cancel the order. 'Everything Pizza" sounds tasty but NOT a tenth a paycheck tasty, sorry.

EDIT: Well, I just had an experience.

Delivery person still came. I turned the lights out and pretended I wasn't there but he just kept ringing the bell and the dog started barking so I FINALLY opened the door.

He was kind of scruffy but I can't judge because I know food delivery is tough. I told him I cancelled the order and he can eat my dinner for all I care but he didn't even shake his head. He just kept saying 'everything will be okay' until I took the box from his hands.

I felt kind of bad so I tried to give him a ten dollar bill but he didn't even move. I just took the box and closed the door. And he's still out there LMAOOOOO

EDIT: Delivery person finally left, sorry to worry some of you guys. I don't need to call the cops though just cause someone's so damn weird. Dunno how he delivers meals on time though cause he's so slow, hygiene kind of bad too. I looked on ring and when he was walking away I saw some wax COME OUT HIS EAR? So gross... but I've seen worse in college so I'll live.

I'm more pissed that there's a half-eaten slice in my pizza. Free is free but come on! At least eat the whole slice if you're gonna eat something, that's even more gross!

EDIT: No, I'm not going to post a picture of this pizza, I'm hungry and I just want to eat.

EDIT: There's weird shit on this pizza. Are anchovies supposed to MOVE?  Ate a slice a couple slices but not eating those fish, they're definitely raw and look slimier than usual. Gonna go to sleep now. Pizza is a 3/10 but it's free so we take these. This is the FINAL UPDATE!!

EDIT: Just woke up, stomach feels fine but my ear feels weird. Maybe make it a 2/10. Sorry I said it was the final update but I thought I'd be asleep and not up at 3AM lol.

Was hungry again (yes I know, I'm a big eater) and opened up the pizza box but it looks like some of the toppings are gone. And the anchovies are on the floor?? I looked around and some are even in my bedroom lol. Wonder if my dog got to it. If he can open and close pizza boxes I got to post that to reddit.

EDIT: My ear still feels kind of weird. Kind of 'buzzy?' My stomach hurts too but maybe from stress. A commenter mentioned that sometimes ears get clogged from wax but I kind of feel a weird wet sensation in there. I'll check it out later. Sorry for treating this like a personal blog. ITT: free pizza and OP complains about their health anxiety. Mods remove this if this tmi.

EDIT: Ear still feels weird. Like REALLY WEIRD. My dog started barking at me too, I can't sleep.

EDIT: Dunno what's up but it's def not wax. Pain is getting more

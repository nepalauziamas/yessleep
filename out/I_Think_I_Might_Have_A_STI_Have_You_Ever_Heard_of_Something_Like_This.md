Hi Reddit! I don’t know why I’m asking you all, but I couldn’t find anything online about this and I thought maybe someone on here might know what is going on with me.

I mean basically it’s the normal story right? You meet a guy at a party, one thing leads to another, yadda yadda yadda. Sexy times, don’t think I need to share all the details for some strangers. He was nice, by the way though. A real stand up gent. Tall, dark and handsome… with this kind of crooked smile that always seems to make me sweat a little. What can I say? I have a type.

But anyway I have been having this weird… pressure (?)… ever since. It’s kind of hard to describe. Have you ever been on an airplane and you feel that sort of compression before your ears pop? It’s like that, just all over my body. And I was having trouble staying awake in classes, and feeling nauseous. That said, conversely, i am constantly hungry and I never puke. I ate an entire large pizza and a pound of wings a few days ago! I took a test (or well… two…) and I can confidently say I’m probably not pregnant!

But that feeling is still there. That weird pressure feeling is just always there. Sometimes it lurks— a dull ache at my spine. Other times it’s a sharp pain that emulates through my whole body. But it’s always there, waiting for my ears to pop.

Or well… it was…

Last night it finally went away. I thought it might’ve been the Peptol Bismol I drank, or maybe I just got a better sleep. I don’t know. But it felt nice, freeing. 

I had some really terrible nightmares last night, ones where I was chasing something. Ones where I was so hungry but could never get fed enough. But this isn’t some horror movie, dreams never mean anything. Right?

I went to class for the first time in a week today. And everyone kind of looked at me oddly? Like at first I thought it might have been because I was back and they were surprised to see me. Then, you know— I thought maybe they heard what had happened. Which definitely made me feel self conscious but like— whatever, you know? But then I noticed that they wouldn’t sit beside me at lunch. And when I left class the people outside avoided me. It was strange, even the neighbours shut their door when they saw me walk by!

I was walking into my apartment and happened to glance at a mirror as I walked by. And there’s something growing from my back. It’s smooth, almost like velvet. And it’s starting to look something like a wing.

So I guess what I am wondering is is this some sort of rare STI? Have any of you ever seen something like this? I just really want to know if this is treatable, and how to do so. I just really want to get better.

Not to mention that I’m starting to get hungry again…

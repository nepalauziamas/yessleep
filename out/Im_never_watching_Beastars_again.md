I believe a few of you may be familiar with the anime Beastars. For those who aren't, it's basically a darker, more mature version of Zootopia. Anyway, I happened to be a big fan of the show. Yes, it has a reputation for being a "weird" show, but it's actually very well-written. I had a few of the manga volumes as well as multiple pieces of merchandise. That all changed 2 months ago. Now I have trouble thinking about the show without feeling paranoid. Even as I'm writing, I periodically have to look around to make sure there's nothing in my room.

Before I tell you what happened, I need to explain something weird first. There's a character from that show named Haru. She's a rabbit and love interest of the main character, who's a wolf. As strange as it may seem, I had a crush on her. No, it's not because she's an animal. I just adored her personality and how brave she can be when she needed to. To be fair, I have had crushes on other anime characters in the past. I'm somewhere on the autism spectrum, so it's something that I can't help. Besides, it was just a crush. It's not like I was "in love" with her or something.

However, as one can imagine, this did hurt my self-esteem a bit. Mostly because she's not a human and is fictional. I have been told not to worry about it and be myself by friends, but still. You could say that I'm putting a target on my back by telling the whole internet. You could call me a furry (I'm not) and flood my inbox with hateful messages. But I'd hope that you'd have sympathy for me after hearing what happened.

It all started one night, lying in bed. As I was trying to fall asleep, I began thinking about Haru, and how I should find a real girlfriends, as it would be better for me. I was starting to lose interest in her anyway. It wasn't long before I drifted to sleep, and experienced one of the most vivid dreams I've ever had.

I was alone in my apartment. The only light was coming from the windows. It appeared to be early in the morning. The strangest thing is that even though I was dreaming, I felt wide awake.

One of the first thing's I noticed was in the corner, was a skeleton. It appeared to be mostly human, except for it's canine-like skull. And it was also wearing clothes. It was Legoshi's (the show's MC) skeleton. He was sitting, staring down with his hands covering his face. I've deducted that he died crying.

I went to the other room to see two more skeletons on my couch. One was larger than the other. The smaller one was being cradled by the larger one. They were staring at each other, with the smaller's left hand touching the larger's face. The skeletons were mine and Haru's.

Just then, Haru's skeleton began "un-decomposing". Muscles, tendons and ligaments grew back on her skeleton. I took a few steps back, horrified by what I was seeing. Eventually, she stopped as soon as the only thing missing from her body was skin. Jerkily, she turned towards me and smiled. At this point, I knew for a fact I was having a nightmare. I began vainly forcing myself to wake up, or at least move on to another dream. Before I could do anything, she leap out of my skeleton's arms and wrapped her arms around my neck!

I woke up gasping for air. I swear, for a few seconds after being fully awake, I could still feel her arms around my neck. Shaken by the realism of that nightmare, I was up for an hour or two doing things to take my mind off it. I eventually went back to sleep without a problem.

The following day was normal. That is, until I went to back to bed that night.

&#x200B;

I found myself trapped in another dream. This time, it didn't feel like a dream. Everything was in crystal clear detail. I could feel the air around me. Everything was the way it should be as if I were awake.

In this dream, I was wandering the halls of what appeared to be a doctor's office. It was deserted, but it wasn't abandoned. The lights were on, the floor and walls were clean. All it was missing were people.

I turned around a corner to find myself in a waiting room. There weren't any people. Not even behind the front desk. Strangely, there was a large fish tank in the corner. The water was sparkling and all the fish appeared to be alive and well. "Hello!" I called out. My voice echoed through the building. After a few seconds, there came a response, in the form of loud footsteps.

I felt my face turn cold and my heart sink. What kind of dream was this? You can't feel such real raw emotions in a dream. Something was coming for me. Whatever was coming sounded too large to be a person. Before I had time to brace myself, it entered the waiting room through the doorway on the opposite side of the room. It was Haru..........or something that vaguely resembled her.

It was at least 8 to 9 feet tall. Completely naked. It had a very muscular, masculine body; opposed to Haru's. The only feminine detail I noticed were the genitals. One eye was human-sized, the other was about the size of a softball. It's bizarrely long ears flopped back behind it's body, dragged along the ground. They were so long that I never saw the end of them. It had huge hands. Each with arm-thick, 3-foot long fingers. It's feet resembled that of a crocodile's, rather than a humanoid-rabbit's. The entire body was covered in short, thin spikes; like what you'd see on a hedgehog. I suppose this was her "fur".

I'm not sure how long I stared back, frozen in terror. It was long enough to get all these details, which I hate having to recall. I knew I was looking at a monster. It wasn't something from this realm. It's not something that can be classified by science. It was a monster. A physical manifestation of our darkest, most horrible fears.

Even as it approached me, I was still stood there, trying to not even flinch. It stopped only a few feet away from me. Staring down, it asked me a question, in Haru's usual voice. "You love me, don't you?" Against all odds, a word managed to climb up my throat and escape my mouth. "No." Then, it vomited a dark purple slime on me. I couldn't feel anything, not even pain; except for the chunks of flesh melting off my body, and my bones turning into foam!

I woke up in a cold sweat. I checked my body, back to normal. It was a relief to know that the creature was gone, and I wasn't really melting. However, the paranoia kept me awake. As stated before, this wasn't a normal nightmare.

I was unable to get back to sleep. I went to work in the morning like a zombie. Blankly staring, walking slowly, and only nodding and pointing to answer questions. My boss even asked my if I was okay, I didn't know what to tell him.

Fortunately, I got better as the day went on. While the dreams were horrible I accepted them as harmless nightmares. And that I'd never have to deal with them once I'm awake. If only.

Back at my apartment building, I jogged upstairs as a normally do. This time a little faster. It was admittedly a little more eerie being alone now. Upon finally entering my place, I saw *it*.

Standing back at me, inside my apartment was the Haru monster from my dream. Only this time, it was real, and I was wide awake. I dropped my things and took a few steps back. It was a figment in my dream. How was it here, in my house? It stepped forward, causing the room the shake. This caused me to fall backwards. Fainting from the sheer amount of terror running through my body.

I was later woken up by my concerned neighbor, who found my lying in the hall. She offered to take me to the hospital. I politely declined, I didn't feel it was necessary at the moment. I managed to convince her that I've fainted before, and that I forgot to take my medicine for it that morning. Of course, she would've never believed what actually happened.

As soon as I was alone, I destroyed all my Beastars stuff. I even blocked the show from my Netflix account. Just seeing it in my feed made me nervous. I didn't even want to think about it anymore.

As I've said before, 2 months have passed since this incident. Beastars is dead to me. I've never seen the monster since, but I can't be certain it won't return.

I still haven't found a valid explanation for it. Was it really a monster? Could it really have been nothing more than a bad nightmare? Am I crazy, and I imagined the whole thing? Was it my sadistic subconscious trying to scare me into liking real girls? Honestly, I don't know.

Either way, this has been bothering me every day since. I still pull all-nighters occasionally, fearing I'd see it in my dreams again. I still feel like I'm being watched 24/7. All I want is this fear to go away. I don't know why this had to happen to me. I'm a perfectly good person who had one tiny flaw!

How should I go through with this? Should I call a priest bless my apartment or something? Should I talk to a therapist? My only concern is that they'll think I'm insane and prescribe me loads of medication.

I know I'm not crazy. Then again, that may very well be my problem...

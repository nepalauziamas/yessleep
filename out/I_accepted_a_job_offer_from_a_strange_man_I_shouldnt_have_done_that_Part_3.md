Things aren't going to plan here. I'm... alive, I suppose, as you can tell since I'm writing this after the fact. I wish that wasn't the only good news I had. My car's still totaled, I've been chased half a mile by what was either a type of wildlife that shouldn't exist here, or a figment of my imagination - and then after all that...

...Here I am complaining when I got off easy. I must sound like such a selfish jerk, considering what just happened a little bit ago.

\~\*\~\*\~\*\~\*\~\*\~

I stood on the opposite bank of the creek, the mist still drifting through the clearing. My heart was still pounding, and I was half afraid that *thing* from the highway would come back for me. I had been trying for a good five minutes to return Lester’s call and ask if he could come pick me up. Number not found. I could see a dirt road up ahead on the edge of my visibility, running horizontally past. Was the town left or right from here? I hefted my bag over my shoulder, taking a minute to see how Luna was doing. She seemed more relaxed now, sitting in the “catloaf” position in her carrier and dozing with half-shut eyes. She still didn’t seem to be acknowledging me as much as usual. I hoped she wasn’t upset with me. I do enough to upset humans without adding pets to the list.

I sighed and picked a direction. Time to take a walk.

\~\*\~\*\~

I hadn’t gone far when I heard the sound of a vehicle approaching, and a rusted old pickup truck slowed to pull over next to me. It was hard to pin down the driver’s age – his face was framed by an unkempt beard streaked with gray. He studied me for a long moment through sunken eyes. I couldn’t blame the guy for staring. My forehead had to be covered in blood. Wait, so was the front of my shirt. How had I not noticed that before? I groaned inwardly. My dry cleaning costs were really going up these past couple days.

Finally he tipped the brim of his ball cap. “Padre.”

“Uh – Hi. Um, I’m looking to get to Castle Rock. Could I ask you for directions? I’ve gotten a little turned around…” I chuckled nervously.

There was another pause as he chewed thoughtfully on his cigarette butt. Finally he nodded slowly, as though deciding something. “I’ll do you one better. Hop in.”

\~\*\~\*\~

We drove for a while in silence.

“So, uh, my name’s David,” I said.

Silence.

“I’m applying for a position at one of the local churches – St. Bartholomew’s?”

His eyes flickered back to me for a moment. “Yeah, I know the place.”

“Oh,” I replied. “That’s good, then.”

I decided to take in the scenery instead. Well, what little I could see of it anyway, with all the mist. The weather was kind of weird for this time of year. I guess that’s climate change for you. Weather patterns getting screwy, natural disasters ramping up… Well, not that we got too many natural disasters in the Northeast.

The truck was slowing now. I looked around uncertainly. No sign of any buildings or people. As far as I could see we were still in the middle of nowhere.

I heard a clicking sound and turned my head quickly to look at the driver – and found myself staring down the barrel of a gun.

My heart nearly leapt out of my chest. “I-I don’t have anything valuable, but you can take it, you can take it all. Except the cat. But I’ll give you everything else, just please don’t shoot-“

He let out a grim chuckle. “What do you take me for, boy? This ain’t about money.”

“Th-then…?”

For just the barest flicker of a second – so brief and imperceptible that I wasn’t sure if I’d imagined it – his eyes seemed to soften ever so slightly.

“It’s better this way.”

The words had barely left his mouth when I shoved his arm, causing the bullet to fire into the ceiling of the cab. He cursed loudly. I fumbled with the door as he readied another shot. By some miracle, even though I was at near point-blank range, the bullet whistled past my ear – grazing it – and went through the glass of the window. I felt blood trickling down my cheek, but the extra moment was all I needed. I grabbed the handle of Luna’s carrier and jumped out of the cab. What the hell was this?! I didn’t have time to pick a direction – I ran. I remembered reading online how if you ever got shot at, you should weave around to minimize your chances of being hit, instead of going in a straight line. I didn’t expect to ever have to actually use that knowledge. Another bullet sped past me. Luna was yowling in fear.

I crashed through the thicket into the woods, running through the underbrush.

“Come on, Pastor,” I could hear the man call out from behind me. “Don’t make this harder than it needs to be.”

What was this guy’s problem?! I wondered if he was on drugs, or-

A bullet pierced the tree trunk mere inches from my face. I dove to the ground with a whimper, nearly falling off a steep cliff in the process. Mother God, if you’re out there-

Footsteps in the underbrush behind me. I scrambled to my feet.

He stood in front of me, gun pointed directly at me. I backed away slightly.

He smiled mirthlessly. “End of the line.”

I screwed my eyes shut. Mom, Dad, I’m sorr-

*Click.*

My eyes snapped open. The man was reaching for his belt to reload his gun, cursing under his breath. I didn’t give him the chance. I dropped the cat carrier and tackled him.

Or tried to. It turns out the man was stronger than a chronically online 29 year old who had spent the past few years indoors reading theological texts and old Gnostic manuscripts. He held his ground as I grappled with him, pistol-whipping me in the side of the head. My ears rang and my vision blurred. Well, when you’re at a disadvantage… Fight dirty. I thrust my face forward and bit his nose. Hard.

He yelled in shock, grabbing my arm with a strength that made me wince.

I didn’t notice in the heat of the moment that we were getting closer to the edge of the precipice. His eyes flitted over my shoulder. In that second I realized just how far he was willing to go. He slammed into me with his full body strength, and the two of us tumbled off the edge.

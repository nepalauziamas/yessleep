[“If she is a witch, who else could be among us?”](https://old.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/xpwx03/the_eden_witch_trials_guiltless_part_two/)

I have selected the most pertinent passages from my great–(x16)–grandmother’s memoirs to illustrate the events of the Eden witch trials, during which she was one of many accused, tried, and convicted of practising witchcraft. My notes are in brackets.

*Alse* [Alice] *Sheldon was arrested after she was accused of witchcraft by Mary Hobbs. Eighty years old, Alse had poor eyesight, so she was unsure what was happening to her when the jailers first detained her. She was also hard of hearing. When speaking with her, one would have to shout in order for her to hear. Goody Sheldon recited a short prayer,* “O Lord, help me,” *as she was taken to jail.*

*On the following day, Goody Sheldon was publicly examined by the magistrates. To aid in her hearing, she stood as close as she could to the bench.*

“What do you say, Goody Sheldon, to the charge that you hurt these children?”

*She answered,* “I say before my Eternal Father that I am innocent.”

“Are you innocent of this witchcraft?”

*Before she was able to answer, Ann Pearson shrieked,* “A black shadow speaks in her ear!”

*As the afflicted girls trembled in fear, Goody Sheldon raised her hands in prayer, and the girls did the same.*

“Do you not see what condition these children are in? When you raise your hands, they do the same.”

*When she lowered her hands, the girls did the same. Goody Sheldon said,* “The Lord knows that I have not hurt them. I have hurt no one in my life. I pray that God forgives me for all of my sins, but witchery is not one of them.”

*The magistrate asked,* “What do you say to the charge that a black shadow speaks in your ear?”

“It is false.”

“Who hurts these children if not you?”

“I do not know. I cannot help it. The Devil may appear in my shape.”

*Goody Sheldon was dismissed by the magistrate, and she was taken away by the jailers. It was a lamentable scene to see an old woman treated in such a way. I was disgusted. After she was taken away, I was the first to leave the meetinghouse.*

*A pattern began to emerge among many of the accused witches. Rather than protest their innocence, the accused would confess to witchcraft, and accuse others of witchcraft, thereby aiding the Court, which possibly saved their lives. If an accused witch pleaded “Guilty,” she was seen as a repentant sinner, and helping the Court identify witches was her penance. Goody* [Margaret] *Hobbs, the aunt of two of the most prominent accusers, Mary Hobbs and Tamsin Dane, was accused of witchcraft by the Whitcomb sisters. She confessed in tears,* “Goody Sheldon told me I must sign the Devil’s book. If I did not, she said she would hurt me as she hurt these children.”

“How many names are in the Devil’s book?”

“Goody Sheldon,” *Goody Hobbs testified,* “Goody Jacobs and Goody Oliver, Goody Williams, and three names I could not see.”

*’Twas the night of the new moon. As I prepared for bed, I heard noises from the back of the house. I looked out of the window, and I saw the Whitcomb sisters walking into the woods. What were they doing now? I could not resist temptation. Against my better judgment, I grabbed my shawl, walked out of the house, and into the woods.*

*I will admit that I was scared, and my fear only rose as I walked through the woods. It was hard to see in the inky blackness of the night. There was no moonlight to guide my way. I held my shawl closer as the winds howled around me. Where were we headed? Eventually, I could see the flames of a fire in the midst of the woods. I walked as close as I could to the source of the blaze, but I hid behind a large tree once I saw the Whitcomb sisters join a large gathering of people in a clearing. They approached a man, clad entirely in black, who turned around to greet them. It was Reverend* [Thomas] *Bayley, the former minister of the church in Eden. I was confused. When and why had he returned to the Village? He had left three years prior to minister at the church in Town, or so he said.*

*Sarah Whitcomb handed a wicker basket to Mr. Bayley, who lamented,* “’Tis a great disappointment.”

*Sarah and Mercy joined the others around the fire. A woman walked toward Mr. Bayley. Through the light given off by the fire, I could see that it was Goody Reed.*

*She said,* “It is time, Mr. Bayley.”

*Nodding his head, Mr. Bayley stood in front of the congregation as Goody Reed joined them.*

*What was happening?*

“Welcome, my children,” *Mr. Bayley said.* “Welcome to this service of initiation. Bring forth the converts!”

*Goody Reed led the Whitcomb sisters to Mr. Bayley, who held high the wicker basket which Sarah had given him. Upon an altar hewn out of rock, Mr. Bayley opened the basket, the contents of which were unspeakably vile. An abomination before God. Yet if I must tell, I will tell. On the altar lay the lifeless and limp body of Sarah Whitcomb’s stillborn baby. I held my hand to my mouth in abject horror. I could not hear everything Mr. Bayley said, but I was able to hear,* “It should have been our offering. Alas! Since it never drew a breath, it is of no use to us. Burn it, Goody Reed.”

*Mr. Bayley handed the corpse to Goody Reed, who disposed of it in the fire in the midst of the congregation. The fire threw up a lofty flame, which rose above the tops of the trees. Mr. Bayley watched the scene with a look of scorn on his face. Goody Reed looked like a rampant hag, her hands clasped together, as if in prayer. She returned to her place by Mr. Bayley, who spoke to the Whitcomb sisters.*

“My children, you had hoped that all was not lost. Perhaps, you thought, mankind was good. Now you are undeceived. Evil is the nature of mankind. Evil is all there is. Welcome, my children, and be baptised anew!”

*Sarah and Mercy were undressed down to their shifts. Mr. Bayley led the sisters to a nearby stream, which flowed with black water. Sarah and Mercy knelt by the stream bank, and Mr. Bayley dipped his fingers into the water, placing the mark of their new baptism onto the sisters’ foreheads.*

*After the baptism, Mr. Bayley led the sisters back to the clearing, where he instructed Goody Reed,* “Fetch the offering for us.” *I could not see where she went, but she returned with one of Goody Sheldon’s missing lambs. The lamb was placed onto the unhallowed altar of rock. Goody Reed handed Mr. Bayley a blade. He held the blade to the throat of the bound lamb, and after a silent prayer, he slit its throat. Goody Reed collected its blood in a basin. As the lamb breathed its last, Mr. Bayley produced a large red book. Dipping a pen into the lamb’s blood, the sisters signed their names in the book.*

*’Twas a Witches’ Sabbath. There* were *witches in Eden. Yet they were neither poor Goody Jacobs nor foul–mouthed Goody Oliver. They were godly Mr. Bayley and pious Goody Reed. I could only see the shadows of the rest of the congregation.*

“We are in desperate need,” *Mr. Bayley said.* “The Master has no more need for burnt offerings. He asks for a living sacrifice.”

“What shall that be, Mr. Bayley?” *Goody Reed asked.*

*Mr. Bayley responded with a question of his own,* “Who has the best garden in Eden?”

*Mr. Bayley and Goody Reed discussed names among themselves before I heard something that sent a shiver up my spine.*

“Goody Noyes has a garden,” *Goody Reed said.* “She tends to it daily.”

“Goody Noyes?” *Mr. Bayley mused.* “So shall it be. She shall grow what we need. . . .”

“In the earth and the flesh!” *Goody Reed cried out in a loud voice.*

*Mr. Bayley concluded,* “. . . .Or she shall hang for it.”

*Terrified, I ran away from the clearing. It was pitch black darkness, but I was able to make my way through the woods, and I reached our house. Out of breath, I was met by John, who had awoken to find me gone. I could not tell him what I saw and heard, so I lied to him. I said that I heard of an animal at the edge of the woods, and I was discussing it with our neighbours. John held me close to him as he comforted me. He led me to our bed. As we lay together, he held me in his arms, but Mr. Bayley’s words still echoed in my mind.* “She shall *hang* for it.” *Yet I was eventually able to fall asleep.*

*’Twas not a restful sleep.*

*It was dark. Was I awake? Was I asleep? I did not know. I did not even know where I was. I was paralysed, but I could still feel the touch of claws all over my naked body. I could not close my eyes. I struggled as much as I could, but my struggles were in vain. All I could do was lie there and watch as this infernal creature lay with me. I was able to move my eyes, and I saw the witches from the Sabbath standing around the bed. Goody Reed mouthed the words,* “In the flesh,” *as I was finally able to move. I sat up in bed with a start. The sun shone through the window. I looked around my bedroom, but there was nothing out of the ordinary. I was dishevelled, but that could have been from restlessness. The scratches on my body could have been from the trees in the woods last night. ’Twas a dream. It had to be.*

*As days turned into weeks, my flowers did not come. When weeks turned into a full month, I could no longer deny what I knew to be true.*

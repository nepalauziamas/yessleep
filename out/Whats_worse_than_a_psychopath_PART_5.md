\[INCLUDES SEXUAL VIOLENCE\] 

&#x200B;

I told Clara about my dream. I told her about the blood I found when I woke up and I told her about the bleeding scar and I told her when it happened. She just listened and was more and more unsettled as I went on. I didn’t tell her about the state we found the victims in, but I told her to be careful. We never know what can happen. 

“Is this some sort of a bad joke?” Clara asked me when I was done explaining. 

She was on the brink of crying and I could see her eyes tearing up. She looked towards the cash register to see if anyone was standing there and then turned back towards me. 

“What do these dreams mean?” she asked. 

“I have no clue. I’m trying to find that out myself. It’s not going that well.” 

“And the murders? Are they connected to all this?” 

I didn’t know whether to smile or cry at that moment. She was too smart for her own good. 

“Yes,” I answered knowing that she’ll realize if I lie or not. 

“Well... that’s not good,” she replied trying hard not to start crying. 

“No, it’s not. But if you stay inside, you should be safe. Everyone who we found by now was last seen going into the woods or some wooded area where no one could see them. If you want, I can get you home tonight.” 

“But you don’t want people to see us together... This could...” 

“I don’t give a fuck,” I cut her off. “Your safety is more important.” 

She was surprised by my reaction. I usually don’t swear so it was unusual. After a second or two, she smiled realizing that I care about her a lot. 

“Okay,” she told me. “You’ll drive me.” 

We talked about the case and some other stuff. The taste of the burger and the beer alongside her company made me forget about the entire situation. The owner of Mandy’s diner came to greet us and she even gave me a discount. I always paid since I had a stable income and I was older so I felt like it was just the right thing to do. The rain started to fall so we decided it would be best to leave earlier. I took my jacket and lifted it above my head. Clara walked close to me so that I could hold the jacket above the both of us. I opened the door to her and walked up to the driver’s door but suddenly felt like someone was looking at me. I turned my head towards the tree line from where I felt it. I swear that I saw a humanoid figure disappear into the woods for only a millisecond. It felt like it knew that I was going to look at it. The only thing I could do at that moment is look towards the forest and wonder what the hell had I just seen. 

“What’s going on?” Clara asked me opening the driver’s door and gently hitting me with them. “Are you okay?” 

I took a look at her and then turned back towards the forest. 

“Ye... Yeah,” I told her while getting into the car. “I’m okay.” 

“Uh-huh...” she sounded concerned. 

When I sat down, Clara started to talk about how much she likes to fall asleep to the sounds and smell of the rain. I turned the car on and took another look at the woods. I couldn’t see anything but the bushes and trees. Clara continued to ramble about the rain and put her favorite CD into the CD player and turned it on. I kept one of her favorite CDs since we sometimes drove around in my car. It was some lofi music. My car was a bit older so she couldn’t connect to it with a phone and let the music play through it. Apparently, she used to do so in her dad’s and roommate's car. She didn’t live with her parents anymore, but they still knew about our meetings and I suggested she tell them when and where we have each of our meetings. It was more to make them comfortable with it than anything else. 

“Thank you,” she told me when she got out of the car. “For telling me everything.” 

I smiled. 

“No problem,” I replied. “Be careful. Lock your doors and windows.” 

“I will,” she closed the door and walked away. 

I waited for her roommate to let her in and left after I saw the door open. I used the rearview mirror to be completely sure she was safe and she was. I went straight home. The entire time, I felt... uncomfortable. Like something was wrong. Not quite like I was watched but like something was present around me all the time. Something that couldn’t see me and I couldn’t see it. However, it wasn’t nearly as unsettled as I was. When I came home, I parked in my driveway. While walking toward my front door, I took a look at my mailbox. 

My carrier signal flag was lifted upwards. Today, they are mostly used to tell the mailman that there is outgoing mail. However, as I said, I lived in a smaller town. Well... it wasn’t such a small town, but that’s not important. Our town stayed a bit more traditional when it came to a few things. One of those things was the usage of the carrier signal flags. They were lifted by whoever put mail into your mailbox. I’ve got new mail. My mind rushed back to those pictures I received recently. 

I walked up to the mailbox and opened it. There was an envelope and I took it out hoping that the rain wouldn’t ruin the envelope. I ran up to my front door and went inside. Micky ran up to the door immediately and was about to rub his head on my leg but he decided not to since I was completely wet. He started outside while the doors were open and looked into my eyes when I closed them. I knew that he wasn’t hungry since he wasn’t meowing. He was just bored and wanted to follow me around like little children sometimes do. 

I changed my clothes and sat down by the dining table. I pulled out a chair so that Micky could sit next to me. He liked to do so and he knew that he wasn’t allowed on the table so he just sat there looking around acting like a king. I opened the envelope and took out a letter. The first thing I noticed was the coordinates. The rest of the letter was written mostly like the first one. It was someone acting like they think I'm their friend but in a condescending and dangerous way. The letter also explained where the coordinates were. It also stated that the law enforcement was incredibly stupid and couldn’t do anything on their own. Not only the cops but the detectives as well. To me, it just seemed like a rambling lunatic but it didn’t matter. They still somehow knew what Clara... what I did. 

It said that I should meet them at that location at 11 PM the day after. And what did they ask me to do? Bring cash of course. But not only that... I was instructed to bring the confiscated cocaine. The entire story was on the local news and newspapers so many people knew that the dude was captured and that he had the coke so it could have been anyone. Honestly, judging by the fact that they are blackmailing me, I assumed that they were going to sell it and not use it. People who use it are desperate and would either break in or make a stupid mistake by which I could easily find out who they are. This was much more organized. At that moment, I knew what I was going to do. I decided that I’ll bring the money, but not the coke, and make up an excuse.

I took a shot of whiskey and looked at Micky. 

“This world is going to shit,” I told him. 

He just stared at me with those innocent eyes. I smiled and went to sleep. I woke up the next morning at 6 AM feeling the pain in my arm again. I took a look and noticed that it started bleeding again. I ran into the bathroom holding it so that blood wouldn’t fall all over the floor. I did the same thing as I did in the station but instead of using water, I used ethanol to clean out the wound. When I was finished, I looked at my phone and saw 4 unanswered calls and a few messages from Clara. She was asking if my scar started to bleed and was kinda frantic about it. She kept sending messages until I told her that it was all okay. It wasn’t anything bad. It meant that another person got a scar. I didn’t know who the hell it was but I explained to her how the same thing happened to me when she got the scar. She calmed down after that and told me that she bled a bit on the floor and needed to clean it before her roommate saw it so that she couldn’t text anymore. 

Usually, I wake up at 7:00 and go to my job at 7:30. I always get there a few minutes earlier but it’s just enough to make myself cozy and prepare everything before I start working. Captain also allows me to leave a few minutes earlier in cases like this so it’s all cool. I made myself some coffee, checked the news, and turned on the TV just to pass some time. Suddenly while I’m checking the news, I get a call from the captain and I answer. 

“Good morning, captain,” I replied turning off the TV so I can hear him better. “A new body?” I asked. 

A sigh came from the other side. 

“If only,” he answered. “Three new bodies were found and four people called in that their family members or friends are missing. I’m afraid that they’ll have the same fate as these three.” 

“Have they been identified?” I asked. 

“Not yet, but we are working on it. You don’t have to get here by the way. Just go to the station when your shift starts and I'll get each of you pictures of the scene.” 

“Understood, captain,” I sometimes like to be a bit sarcastic and the captain doesn’t mind it. “I’ll get to my job soon.” 

“This early?” 

“Yeah, I was woken up... by my cat,” I replied taking a look at Micky who was cleaning himself at that moment. 

“Okay, detective,” the captain replied. “We’ll see each other later.” 

He hung up after that and I started to pack. Getting to the job half an hour earlier wasn’t too uncommon of an occurrence for me. I’m one of those people who have a lot of energy in the morning so it wasn’t such a big deal and I actually preferred it. I don’t really know what to do at home so early so it’s basically like an escape. 

Once more, I was the first to arrive. I wondered who was the next person who got the scar. What the hell did the scars even mean? The scar on my arm is so much different than the ones we found on the victims. The ones on the victims are clumsily carved with clear mistakes at some point. The scar on my arm and the one on Clara’s were clean and the circle was basically perfect when our arms stood in a natural position. The lines on the victims were wavey and curved while the ones on my scar were straight. It was clear that the scars on victims were carved by hand and the ones on Clara and me... well... by a higher power. I’m starting to believe that this is like a ghost or something. Maybe it just marks its next victim and the scar gets all messed up. I don’t know but I do really want to find out. 

If you remember, I mentioned Ewan Loringer. The guy who killed his wife and his four children. He must have been connected to the case somehow. Eyeballs were removed, right arms flayed and a circle carved into each of their chests. This screamed like the new cases. They were far from identical but there must have been something. Maybe whoever is the new murderer, or murderers, is trying to bring back Ewan from his death. Maybe they are trying to summon his ghost or some bullshit like that. But there was another theory that came to my mind. What if Ewan knew about something? What if there was an entity? 

Ewan could have found out about an entity that isn't of this world and he could have tried to invite it into our world. He failed and later on, someone started a cult with the same goal. However, no matter how fun, interesting and unsettling this sounds, I’d rather believe that someone’s summoning Ewan’s ghost. Even though none of these make sense, Ewan’s ghost one seems like it could be the most plausible one. 

I went into the room for case files and tried to look for Ewan Loringer. It wasn’t too hard to find it since we had the files organized by the years in which the case took place. That happened 38 years ago in 1984. Ewan was 42 at the time and would be exactly 70 today. His wife was 40 and his children were 19, 17, 16, and 12. The crime scene was absolutely disgusting because three of the victims were underage. Those were two of his daughters and his son. His eldest daughter was still alive when the police arrived but died quickly due to blood loss. Everyone else was dead apart from Ewan himself. Since he was holding a knife and charged at the police, he was shot three times. Two bullets were in his chest and one in his forehead. 

It’s a shame he was killed. Don’t get me wrong, he was a terrible person and definitely deserved a worse end. The problem appears when we try to understand him at least a bit. His dead body couldn’t be questioned. They tried questioning his friends and neighbors, his extended family, and his coworkers. He was a solitary office worker so that led to nothing and he looked completely normal on the cameras. Neighbors didn’t see anything unusual or suspicious and the extended family didn’t see him in a long time. They just lived far away and couldn’t really visit often. His friends helped us the most even though it was basically nothing. They said he started to act weird about a week before he did what he did. He would zone out and would snap out of it only when one of them gave him a gentle push. Nothing was found apart from that. Whoever shot Ewan messed up pretty badly. 

The rest of the detectives came to work while I was looking into the case. I believe all of them also believed this was somehow connected to these murders, but no one thought that the reports of the case will be of any help because of how little information there is. It was simply just not going to do anything. Just take their precious time. I knew that as well but I still hoped for something. I hoped to find some little clue that previously didn’t make any sense but I found nothing. I felt disappointed. I was so curious and hopeful, yet I found nothing. 

I left the room and returned to the office. Captain Holden still didn’t return. All the detectives were by their tables and doing their jobs. As soon as I sat down by my table, Kaley appeared next to me. 

“Woah,” I said moving to the side a bit. “You’ve startled me.” 

“You’re not the only one,” she took a look to her right. 

I followed her gaze and saw Johnatan. He looked confused and like he was on edge. His expression was one of slight terror and ignorance. He was sweating hard but kept his focus on his tasks. In fact, he was hyper-focused. He didn’t even acknowledge stuff he usually would. Like whenever someone would slip, he’d laugh quietly. He was a douchebag, but not this time. He didn’t react to anything unless someone was talking directly to him. And whenever someone talked to him, he’d turn towards them quickly and like he didn’t hear what the other person said. 

“We go to work together,” she said. 

“You’ve told me before,” I replied. 

I kept my eyes at Johnatan but could feel Kaley turn towards me. She looked at me for a few seconds and then looked back at Johnatan. I knew that meant something to her. 

“Anyway, he usually just parks in front of my yard even though we live only a few houses apart,” she said in a concerned voice. “But this morning, he didn’t come to pick me up. I thought he fell asleep but when I rang his doorbell, he opened the door almost immediately.” 

“So, he just slept a bit longer?” 

“No,” she answered. “The problem was how he looked.” 

“What? Like shit? Like he always does?” I joked and looked at her. 

She gently hit my arm just where the scar was. Even though she was concerned, I managed to make her smile. I was happy that she took the joke well since they look quite similar. They are twins after all... and he didn’t look like shit. Neither did she. 

“His face appeared from the crack between the door and the wall. And just like you said, he looked like shit. He was frightened and looked just like someone just beat him up five times without leaving any scars.” 

“Maybe... if he did it...” I said thinking of the stolen coke. “He could have taken a bit.” 

“No,” she replied immediately. “I’ve seen how people act when they take it. This was the complete opposite. He looked exhausted, terrified, and... like he was trying to get away from something.” 

“Did he tell you anything?” I asked her. 

“No. He said that everything was okay. I even asked him if he wanted to go to the hospital but he said no. The first thing I could think of is that something could have happened to his girlfriend.” 

“Girlfriend?” 

“Yeah. He has a girlfriend. I’ve met her a few times. She sleeps at his place almost every day, but she wasn’t there this morning.” 

“Maybe they broke up and he had a mental breakdown?” 

“I doubt that. It is possible but they were completely fine when I saw them together last time and that was only two days ago.” 

“Maybe they were arguing badly but he didn’t tell you or something.” 

She sighed. 

“I don’t know,” she told me. “All I know is that something’s wrong and that he needs help.” 

My eyes widened when she said that and I looked at her. She was already looking back at me with an expression that told me I properly understood what she was trying to say. 

“No, no, no... I’m not talking to him,” I told her. 

“Please. I don’t know who else to ask.” 

“He hates me and I don’t know what to tell him. I can't just say that you told me everything.” 

“Please,” she begged. “Do it for me. You don’t even have to do it today. Just talk to him when you think of something.” 

I put my hands on my face and sighed. 

“Okay,” I told her after moving my hands. “I’ll do it.” 

“Thank you, thank you,” she said happily and hugged me. 

She surprised me and it took me a second to hug her back. It was a long time since someone other than Clara hugged me. It made me feel good for once. After the hug, she went back to her job and I had to think for a minute. I kept my eyes on Johnatan. I wanted to think about how I should approach him but my mind kept going back to Ewan Loringer. His case was the only thing I could think about. It was the only thing I could think about throughout my entire job. There just had to be something. Maybe not in the case files exactly but there must have been something more to this entire thing. Captain didn’t come to the office the entire day and just when I was done with my job, I learned why. 

“Elijah,” Tara called after me while I was walking towards my car. 

“Yeah?” I asked turning around. 

“Captain called. The four people that were reported missing were found.” 

“Well...” I started before I was interrupted. 

“One more has been found with them... and a clue.” 

Tara, Elliot, Kaley, and I went to the scene of the crime. Johnatan stayed behind since he wasn’t in the best state of mind. The bodies of four missing people were leaning onto a tree. Each corpse turned towards its own side of the world. I bent down to check one of them. Like usual. Flayed arm, torn jaw, gauged out eyes, etc. 

“Where’s the fourth body?” I asked when a droplet of blood fell onto my arm. 

I looked up and saw the body hanging above me. I didn’t see it before because my view of it was blocked by the canopies of other trees. 

“Oh...” I whispered to myself. 

Whoever that was, they were hanging from a thick branch and were about 20 feet above the ground. Something was jammed into their chest, but the worst part was that their entire body was flayed. 

“How will you get it down?” I asked the captain. 

“We’ll bring the ladder, cut the rope at the top and lower the body with the part of the rope that’s still attached to the body.” 

They did just that. They leaned the ladder on the branch and two people held them at the bottom so that they would be steady. A third and fourth person climbed them so that they could lower the body after cutting the rope. They put a blanket under the body so that it wouldn’t get dirty from the dirt and foliage on the forest floor. The process was a bit slower than I expected it to be and all of us waited for the body to be put to the ground. The body was drained of blood and its guts were hanging from a hole in its stomach. I didn’t even notice that when I looked up for the first time. They let go of the rope once the legs of the corpse touched the ground. It collapsed onto the floor and the captain furiously looked toward the two people who were tasked with lowering the body down. I, however, noticed something else. The massage referred to was the knife in the corpse’s chest. She thought it was a threat. The thing is, around the handle of the blade, a real message was wrapped. 

Suddenly I started to feel fear. It seemed like I was the only one who focused on the body while the others focused on the two men who dropped it. I remember hearing the captain shouting something but I don’t remember what it was. I put on my gloves and stepped closer to the body. I crouched down next to the body. The captain was saying something to the two men but he stopped when he noticed me crouching next to the body. I slowly and carefully took the paper off of the handle and removed the ribbon made of thin rope. After opening the letter, I was left even more confused. There was a... sentence? I don’t know if I could even call it a sentence. It was around the length of this sentence. Not too long, but not that short. The problem appeared in the language it was written it. 

Now, I’ll describe it in a weird way. It looked like a mixture of Chinese and Arabic but it also kinda looked like how numbers looked on an older calculator. The lines were interrupted by empty spaces. It was also a bit blockish but with rounded edges. It was super weird and I have never seen something like it before. Apart from the Arabic part, this might sound like Korean to some people but it wasn’t. I learned to differentiate Eastern Asian alphabets or writing systems and I knew that this wasn’t any of it. It resembled Arabic because of the way the letters connected and there were dots near some lines that appeared multiple times. Below that sentence, at the bottom of the letter, a word was printed. It said: “Betrayer.” 

“What does it say, detective?” the captain asked me. 

“I’d like to be able to read it,” I answered. 

“What the hell are you talking about?” 

I stood up and handed the letter to the captain. I waited until he put on his gloves and his reading glasses. Immediately after taking a look at the paper, he looked back into my eyes. He was surprised and understood what I said. 

“Betrayer?” he said to no one in particular. 

I saw him hand the paper to Elliot. I returned back to the body to check it while the rest of them checked the paper. 

“There’s a large cut in the victim’s neck,” I said before checking the ankles. “There are dents just above the ankles. They hung him upside down by his ankles and slit his throat after some time.” 

“There is more than just one killer,” the captain said. 

“And this one... betrayed them?” Kaley asked. 

“Seems like that,” I answered. 

We were for another hour. The corpses were carefully put in bags and transported to the forensic lab. The rest of us left soon after. Kaley and I were the last detectives left. 

“Did you talk to Johnatan?” she asked me. 

“No, I didn’t,” I told her. “I’ll do it tomorrow. I just had a lot of work today.” 

“That’s okay,” she said putting her hand on my shoulder. “Maybe you’ll become good friends. He isn’t such a big douche when you get to know him better,” she smiled. 

I smiled back at her trying to hide how unpleasant I felt about her request. However, I decided to trust her and give her the benefit of the doubt. 

“I’ll see you tomorrow,” she told me and gave me a kiss on the cheek. 

Before I could react, she took a few steps backward while smiling. She turned around and went to her car. I waited for her to leave before going to my car and heading back home. Halfway there I remembered the ‘deal’ I had with whoever put those letters in my mailbox. I changed my course to the bank and pulled out 3000 dollars. I had another 17000 dollars waiting at my house. I was good with saving money so it was no problem finding that much. I was furious that I needed to do this but it was the best way to protect Clara... and myself. 

While at home, I was incredibly nervous. I didn’t know what to do. I could still only think about Ewan Loringer. The letter on the flayed corpse wasn’t such a big surprise since it revealed what I already believed was true. There's more than one killer and all of them are complete lunatics. I was a bit nervous about the meeting but not as much as I should've been. I literally could not find a way to calm myself down and make my time pass faster. I even took three shots of whiskey and it didn’t help. The adrenaline blocked it out. Suddenly, I thought of something that could help me. Captain Holden’s wife is a lawyer. Someone needed to inherit Ewan’s possessions after he killed himself. I decided to ask the captain to speak to his wife about it. This helped me calm down and I found some stuff to do to pass my time. 

At 10:30 I went into my car and put the envelope with the money in the trunk. I honestly don’t know why I did that but those three glasses of whiskey probably got to my head a bit. It took me about 20 – 25 minutes to get to the place where they told me to meet them. It was a small opening in the woods next to a smaller road. It was outside our town and it wasn’t the smartest place to meet anyone but I had no way of contacting the other person. The area was completely surrounded by woods and isolated from any civilization. The road the area was connected to didn’t have street lamps so the only thing that lit it up was the moonlight and my car’s lights. 

I went deeper into the clearing until I saw a black car parked right at the edge of the woods. Two people were leaning onto it and I stopped when I noticed them. They were dressed all in black and wore balaclavas. The person who stood closer to me took a step forward and pointed to my right. I somehow understood what they were trying to say. I turned to my right and parked in a way that the front of my car was just about to touch one of the trees. While turning, I tried to look at the license plate of their car but they seemed to have covered it with cardboard. When I parked, I turned my car off but left the lights on. I knew that it could mess up my car but I needed a source of light. 

I saw the two people slowly approaching and when they were visible enough, I noticed that one was a woman and the other one was a man. The man was just a bit shorter than me standing at 5’11 while the woman must have been around 5’7. I also noticed that the man was carrying a crowbar. I hoped that it was for protection. 

“Hello my friend... friends,” I chuckled. “I assumed it was going to be just one of you since...” 

“Oh, cut that bullshit,” the woman interrupted me. “Where’s the stuff?” 

“Straight to the business,” I smiled. “I like it.” 

I walked up to my car’s trunk and opened it. The light in it immediately turned on and revealed the envelope and a bat I always keep in my car. I bent down to grab the envelope when I felt something hard and cold touch the back of my head. 

“Don’t you dare grab that crowbar,” the woman told me. 

At that moment I realized it was a barrel of a gun. 

“Woah Woah Woah Woah,” I said lifting my arms in the air. “I was just reaching for the envelope. You told me to bring the money, didn’t you?” 

“Step aside,” she told me. 

I took one step to my right and she kept both her look and gun at me. With her left hand, she grabbed the envelope and closed the trunk doors. 

“Come here,” she told me with the gun still pointed at me. 

Now that I could see the gun, I recognized it. It was the Glock 22. A sidearm every detective in the office used and the one I had hidden in my pants. The woman walked back to the man and handed him the envelope. I followed her and stopped only a few feet in front of them. The man opened the envelope without saying a word and started counting. The woman kept switching between looking at me and at the man counting the money. When he was done, he looked at her and nodded. 

“Is he a mute or something?” I asked her. 

“Shut the fuck up,” she answered. “Where is the coke.” 

“Yeah... about that. I couldn’t get it.” 

Both of them stood there dumbfounded as if I told them that I snorted it all up myself. 

“What?” the woman asked. 

“I couldn’t get it,” I replied. 

Just after that, I heard some rustling in the bushes nearby. I looked at them but saw nothing. 

“Look at me,” the woman said. “What do you mean you couldn’t get it?” 

“Someone would have noticed me,” I told her. “They would send me to prison.” 

“I don’t give a shit!” she yelled. “Do you want us to send the evidence to the police?” 

“No, I don’t but is there any point in doing what you asked for if the outcome is the same?” 

“Oh, for fuck’s sake, Elijah,” the man said. “You could have gotten the fucking coke.” 

I immediately recognized the man’s voice. 

“Johnatan?” I asked. 

He grunted and took off his balaclava. 

“What the hell are you doing?” the girl asked him. 

“I don’t have the patience for this. I told you what happened this morning and I’m scared. I’m not in the best state of mind.” 

“What happened this morning?” I asked. 

“It’s none of your fucking business!” Johnatan angrily shouted. 

Johnatan and the woman, who I assumed to be his girlfriend, started arguing. At first, I was listening to them trying to find the right moment to take her gun away but then I heard rustling in the bushes again. I took another look and I froze. Behind the bush stood a naked woman who wore a white mask. Do you know how in cartoons they draw people who live on the pacific islands with those wooden masks? Well, the mask looked just like that. It was colored white with a few black lines under the holes for eyes. It didn’t have a hole for the mouth but it had two tusk-like protrusions at the bottom. They were pointed downwards and curved forwards. On top of the mask, the same protrusions pointed upwards and bent backward. 

“LOOK OUT!” I shouted when a different person ran out of the woods towards Johnatan. 

They turned around just when that other person, who happened to be a naked guy with the same mask, hit Johnatan’s head with a shovel. He immediately fell to the floor. The hit wasn’t hard enough to kill him, but it knocked him out without a problem. 

“NO!” the woman yelled and pointed the gun at the man. 

Before she could shoot him, the naked woman I saw standing behind the bush stabbed her in the neck with the same kind of knife that was jammed into the flayed person’s chest. Johnatan’s girlfriend dropped the gun and grabbed her neck desperately trying to stop the bleeding. She fell down to her knees and then dropped down completely. I quickly took my gun out and pointed it at the naked woman. She turned towards me in the same second I fired. The bullet hit her in the mask and made a big hole in both her mask and her forehead. She fell backward and her mask almost broke in half. 

The naked man swiped at me with his shovel, but I jumped backward dodging it. Instead, he hit my car’s back window and shattered it. I pointed my gun at him, but before I could shoot, he swung his shovel hitting my arm and making me drop my gun. I lifted my leg and with my full strength, I kicked the fucker in the stomach. He took a few steps backward before falling down to the ground. I ran to my trunk, opened it, and took my bat. I suddenly heard a scream to my left and saw a different naked woman with the mask running at me with a plank. She swiped at me and missed. It gave me an opportunity to swipe at her, and I didn’t miss. Just like with the kick, I put my full strength into that swing and I absolutely obliterated her right part of the head. I could hear both her mask and skull cracking. She fell onto my car and slowly slid down to the floor. I could see the dent I left in her head and knew that no one could recover from that. 

I was about to return to the naked man when something hard hit me over my head. The blow came from behind and it made me fall to my right into the trunk of my car. I remember gathering just enough strength to turn around and sit down on the grass while leaning at the bottom of the trunk. A third naked woman appeared in front of me. She was holding a bat and looked much younger than the other two. She crouched down to look at me through the eye holes as I slowly started to fall unconscious. As my sight got darker and darker, I saw more naked people appear from nowhere. The man I kicked was barely walking and had his arm on his stomach. Three more naked men and two naked women appeared from the sides and watched me as I fell unconscious. Last thing I remember before everything went dark is the younger naked woman, the one in the middle, tilting her head and letting out a sigh.

when my dad died I was devastated, I did not sleep or eat for days on end. when it came time for his funeral I had not left my house in what felt like years, everything was dark and gloomy. I walked through the rain for 2 hours as the water touched my skin.

I had to walk through a sketchy alleyway, I saw some kids having a party in a arcade, there was someone wearing a pink and white bunny costume. I wished I could be there right now, eating pizza while playing pac-man sounds great compared to this funeral. I kept walking until I got to the funeral, as I approached I saw the same costume I saw at arcade, it was standing next to my dads grave while laughing, it was holding a bloody knife while hopping around.

no one else noticed they just kept standing. I walked over to mom and asked why its here. she angrily whispered 'this is a funeral Devin of course his body will be here'. I shout whisper 'no the FUCKING bunny dancing around dads COFFIN'. it was loud enough for everyone there to hear. my mom calls over security and tells them to kick me out. I start yelling 'WHY, HOW DO YOU NOT SEE THE BUNNY'. but when I look its just a cloud of pink smoke vanishing.

I walk home with tears flooding my face. how did no one see it, am I going crazy, what do I do. I have to walk through the same alleyway, I look back in the arcade to see the bunny waving at me holding my dads decapitated head and a bloody knife. I scream with fear unable to move. my eyes focus again and nothings there. I head home wondering what to do.

I get home to find my family dead while the bunny keeps hopping around. I run to the kitchen and grab a knife, I swing at it but it vanishes to smoke again. I look back at the living room and see nothing there. I decide to eat some food to try and calm down, I call up a local pizza place and get it delivered.

those 20 minutes of waiting were painful, I had not eaten in 5 days and was worried to see another vision. when my doorbell rang I opened the door and everything seemed normal I tipped and took my food. I was scared to open my food but when I did everything looked normal, medium cheese pizza, 6 boneless wings with spicy BBQ and a small poutine. I took one bite and the pain of not eating set in. I ate all of it in close to 2 minutes. I thought the visions had stopped so I went to bed.

&#x200B;

I woke up to the sound of screaming from my living room. I kick my bedroom door open and rush to my living room. I see what I saw yesterday, my family dead with the bunny hopping around. I grab a knife from the kitchen and strike the bunny. it did not disappear this time, it looked at me and in a broken creepy voice says 'come to the top of this building, you have unfinished business'. it disappears in to pink smoke. I look back but my family is still there, I walk over and realize this is not a vision. I walk out my apartment and walk to the roof. 

&#x200B;

I see the bunny dancing around while laughing. I scream 'WHAT DO YOU WANT, WHO THE FUCK ARE YOU'. it looks back and laughs, I cant take anymore of this. my family's dead and I'm being haunted by this thing. I run out and without hesitation jump off the building. it felt like hours before I hit the ground. I feel the worst pain I have ever felt as I open my eyes. I'm not dead, my bones are all broken but I'm not dead. I feel everything. the bunny is still hopping around, it takes its mask off to reveal it was my dad. a crowd of people form around as my dad puts the mask back on and hops away. a team of doctors rush through the crowd and put me on the back of the ambulance.

&#x200B;

I zone out for a while and wake up to my dad standing there over my hospital bed. I scream at him as I'm trying to grab him. the doctors rush in to try to calm me down but I was seeing red. I ripped the cords off my back and tried to run towards him. I fell to the floor and started crawling towards him. the doctors garbed me and tried to reconnect the cables but I was too angry. I garbed a pair of scissors  and stabbed one of the doctors. I then threw the pair at my dad and killed him. my body was somehow letting me move, I ran too the entrance and stole a car. I drove for 10 minutes before starting to feel pain. I drove to the airport and booked a plane to Tokyo. after a bit I got on the plane and am now living in Tokyo. I changed my name and got plastic surgery. this was 9 years ago and I feel fine now. I feel no guilt for what happened. I moved on and have not had a vision since. I'm probably leaving some things out but I do not remember that much. I still get a sinking feeling whenever I see a bunny.  bye I guess.

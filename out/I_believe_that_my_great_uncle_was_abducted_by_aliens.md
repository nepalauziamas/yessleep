I (21 M) have never believed in aliens, I’ve always believed that there are other life forms besides ourselves out there but nothing intelligent or with their own civilisation / technology. I now think differently after what happened to my uncle back in 2016 and my family (including my uncle) all think I’m crazy, but please hear me out. We’re Scottish and my uncle is a big nature guy so naturally Scotland being Scotland he loves to explore the beautiful forests, mountains and lochs we have all over the country, and in 2016 he took a week off to go up north and visit the towns and villages there, one such town was a town called Nairn. 

Nairn is a town where there isn’t a lot to do, it’s basically in the middle of nowhere and and the closest city is Inverness which in itself isn’t exactly a hub of entertainment. On my uncles second last day there he unfortunately “suffered a stroke” while on a hike in the woodlands and was found my dog walkers in the early hours of the morning, slumped over a large rock, topless. We were obviously all worried about him, but a few things had me doubting the story, why wasn’t he found earlier? The dog walkers found him about 4:30-5:00am, meaning he was there for a good few hours, meaning he must have went out late at night, something he NEVER does as he goes to bed on average at about 9-10pm. Why was he topless? His top was never found and he didn’t know where it was (he had suffered some brain damage from his “stroke” so we just put him not knowing what happened to it down to that) 

The biggest red flag for me however was when I asked my uncle how he got a scar on his lower torso, just above his pelvis, he said he had no idea (again I thought maybe the “stroke” had caused some memory loss) so I asked my Grandmother (his sister) about it and she had no idea what I was talking about. I asked my Uncle if I could take a closer look and upon further inspection I could see that it was almost like a surgical scar, I could still see the stitching, and I also could see another similar scar down his breastbone. I kept quiet, I didn’t want to cause any more trouble or distress for my uncle as he had been through a lot, so I wait a few weeks before asking him about it again. 

He starts getting a bit jumpy and visibly annoyed with my questions and I almost stopped when I could see tears filling up in his eyes, but I was determined to get something out of him. Eventually he starts to give me more details, at this point I’m writing everything down because I knew something wasn’t right. He tells me that he can’t remember going for a walk the night of his “stroke” in fact, he’s certain he didn’t because he can remember being so exhausted from all the festivities of that day that he went to bed earlier than usual (around 8-8:30pm) he has no idea how he got there or what could have brought on the stroke as he’s in good health for someone who’s nearly 70 years old, he had no idea where the surgical scars came from as he claims to have never had any major surgeries before in his life, he had no idea where his top went and he couldn’t remember even having a stroke, he just woke up in the hospital and was told that that’s what had happened by the Doctors. The only things he can remember are seeing a blinding white light and hearing “foreign voices” in his sleep, speaking a mixture of English and a language that sounded like a fusion of “Chinese, Dutch and Spanish” (weird combination I know but that’s what he said) which he all put down to being hallucinations of the stroke. I asked him if he could remember anything else and he said yeah…a laugh. A laugh? I said, what do you mean? What he said next haunts me; 

“I don’t know, all I remember from when I was seeing that white light was someone laughing at me or something, but it didn’t sound human, I mean, it did, but it sounded like a human laugh that had been edited, like the pitch had been decreased like *Mimics laugh*” 

I’m not sure if that last part is true, or if he was just taking the piss trying to scare me or something, but still to this day I’m convinced that my uncle was abducted by aliens and experimented on in some capacity. His mental decline, his loss of memory, the bright lights, the voices, the surgical scars, how and when he was found…it all sounds a bit ET to me.

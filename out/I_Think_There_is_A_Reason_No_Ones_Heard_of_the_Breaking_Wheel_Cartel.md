  

Harsh waves of the Atlantic batter the boat as if a butcher were tenderizing the sturdiest of meat. Salty air, rain falling faster than shooting stars, and the cold mist of the sea intertwine to create frosty blankets on my skin. 

I look to my right and spot four other comrades right behind me in the driving area: one of them piloting my ride, one of them analyzing the opaqueness of their gun, the other two making small talk. 

Hair clings to my cheek as the air becomes more humid than Bigfoot's armpit. I part it, holding some in my hand. My hair somewhat turns into a weight as more rain is absorbed, ebonizing it. 

Upon looking to my left, I see the beaches of North Carolina shaded by the graphite clouds, warping the scenery to look like the aftermath of the storming of Normandy. To my front, are faint shadows of patrol boats. If it weren’t for the fact that people were on them, one could mistake the water piercers as mountainous waves.

Our chief’s orders were simple: find a momma’s three sons trapped at sea.

A voice suddenly makes my mike vibrate. 

"What’s our time of arrival? Over." The screams of the ocean are so chaotic that it nearly overshadows the voice. 

"ETA in no less than five minutes."

"Roger that."

The ruined beaches begin to vanish. Rain inexplicably clears and the waves stop churning. Fog as thick as tar obscures anything two feet in front of my face. I stare at the sky. The once storm grey clouds transformed into an eerie white sheet, more blank and monotone than the boring hallways of the Wilmington Police Station. 

Stenches like that of unwashed asshole pollute the smell of the salty sea air. Similar to the smell of an animal carcass lying in the wilderness left to decay.

I walk to the back of the boat, which is now gently dividing the sea, pull apart the beryl green algae, and insert my hand in the murky water.

“That’s weird,” I think.

The water is unnaturally cold. Cold enough that any life that swam in it would freeze in seconds. I scan for any dead life. Outside from a squawking seabird here and some infinite gloominess there, nothing comes up. I turn away from the abyss and towards the horizon, when to my astonishment, a colossal dark mass clouds the flora.  Must be a recently departed cruise or cargo ship. 

But the waves are way too calm. Any large boat would have upset the waves as it bobbed. Is the monotone scenery getting to my head? I turn around and see that same sun-covering outline appear over the squadron of boats. Definitely not.

I tilt my head as I mouth the words: "What the hell?" as I find the shadow belonging to a structure:

A tower of endless docks and shanties.

"That is the weirdest looking building I have ever seen in," a male voice beams.

As the structure comes closer, it becomes clear that it’s made of wood older than the term "bee's knees." Drapes of unidentifiable kale plant life swing with the wind. Ocean droplets mask images of the haphazardly constructed wooden sheds. Below two of the shacks are broken fishing rods and netting dangling down like a poor man's makeshift chandelier.

My focus turns towards the entrance.

The boat gently nudges the side of one of the docks. I raise the mike with a tremoring hand.

"Group 1 and 2, go northwest." 

The longer I speak, the more my confusion dissolves. Odd. 

"Group 3 and 4, head to the northeast. Group 5 and 6, follow me. All of you, search the perimeter for the pontoon, as our client described."

Upon stepping out onto the decayed platform, boards start shrieking, indicating that they might be one footstep away from shattering. I grab the rope attached to the dinghy, hook it onto the post, pray to God that it doesn't come undone (I’m not getting stuck in the middle of Onslow Bay), and shove the anchor off the side, watching it penetrate the stagnant water. Several patrolmen follow me onto the entry to the otherworldly structure.

\---

Several minutes pass. A garbled voice makes my radio rattle, startling me. 

"Lieutenant Rose, this is Group 4. We found a discarded boat. But there's no sign of the missing people." 

Through the mike, hands run against felt, which is followed by patting. 

"There are gashes across the seats, though. Looks like an assault. Judging from the size of the sons-a-bitches, the assailant might’ve used a machete. There’s no blood and no signs of cleaning chemicals. Hell, there’s no evidence that the victims even escaped. Maybe we can find answers if we ascend the structure. Rose?"

"Alright. You heard him. Begin the ascent."

"Roger," the rest of the force responds.

An armada of creaking cries from the boots of my fellow officers. In each direction are more ill-kept sheds no bigger than a simple pickup truck. Each is stuffed with nothing but worn clothing and sad excuses for nautical equipment. The smell of vinegar and brine jams its fingers up my nose, commanding me to cover it up. Flies buzz around occasional clumps of carrion, scattering when one of my boots squishes.

Then, Group 5's spokesperson comes into my sights, posse in tow.

"I'd assume that this is about 200 yards in radius. In height, about a mile."

A fractal of more of those strange piers fill the overcast sky. 

"Jeez, it's going to be hard as hell trying to find our target in a structure this big. But if we can find El Chapo, we can find these three soon-to-be-fortunate souls," a woman replies with a thick southern drawl. "Do you have a plan, Lieutenant?"

I rest my hand on my chin. "So, Groups 4, 5, and 6 and I will scan the east. The rest of you, head east. We both will ascend at the same time. If we don't find our targets soon, we call in back up."

\---

Soon enough, an hour passes. I give a look back at the lightshow of flashlights radiating through the darkness. Barely any significant changes are present in the spire’s architecture. It’s unclear how far the department has gone up. My patience wears thin and I snatch the radio off my uniform.

"Still no sign of the missing people. We need reinforcements now, over," I radio. 

Static only yells at me when I listen for a response. I press my lips together as I groan. "This is Lieutenant Rose requesting back up. No sign. I repeat, no sign. Wilmington Police Station, do you copy?"

Only harsh noise.

I stare at the abyss to relieve some of my stress and see a cover of blank clouds hiding the now invisible Atlantic. The boards and entire scaffolding rock tranquilly, but creepily, like dying tree branches in the wind, still attached to their owner. Curtain-like seaweed is no longer present. Only netting, harpoons, and anchors. All caked in rust.

Out of nowhere, a plastic crack sounds from my feet. I kneel and raise my foot to the side. A strange small bag with a ship’s wheel stamped on it lies on the planks. Not far off are hundreds of aqua crystals spread out like the stars in the Milky Way. I pick up one of the tiny synthetic fragments, hold it close to my eye and notice that it is as clear as the night sky. Jagged edges from the sides of the substance poke my fingertips, but do not cause too much pain.

"Hey, guys. Look," I radio. 

Soon, five officers come from behind. A male officer requests to see the odd fragment and the bag.

"Looks like meth to me," he says, holding the drug and bag. "This wheel marking doesn't belong to any cartel I've ever seen. Do me a favor and look it up in our database."

I roll my eyes. "We are on some stupid structure in the middle of the ocean. Do you really think we'd have Wi-Fi here? Just wait for now. We can take it back to headquarters once we find our objective."

I tap my toe to the board, biting my tongue. "Sounds to me that these dumbasses were out heading to sea so the police wouldn't find them. They must have done these here drugs right here.  While they were stoned, they might have wandered farther up and-"

*CLANG!*

The officers and I draw our weapons. 

“What was that?” someone asks.

Weird formations resembling metal spaghetti slither in the haze before vanishing. A shiver forms on my spine when the strands pop back into existence and retreat. Sweat trickles down my Kevlar vest and dampens my back.

\---

*SSSSSSSHTHUNK!* 

The horrid symphony of flesh meeting metal and gurgling screaming twists into my ears. 

"Shit!" I yell. 

A massive fish hook impales a subordinate’s upper jaw, impaling her skull. My stomach turns. I frantically search for the source of the hook, firing my pistol.

My gun jams. 

I attempt to force out the clip. 

No avail. 

Two more hooks launch from the emptiness, digging into the victim's eyes. She screams even louder. Then, the razors reel back in a quick swoop, taking off the top of her head with a crunchy splat.

Ice fills my veins.

My gun unjams. I fire as swarms of more and more hooks launch from the unknown. The metal serpents continue their chase.

"I can't find the source! Save your bullets and retreat downward!" I shout. 

Wire tentacles slash the air. To the left, another officer is thrown into the lower levels, scattering blood like a Molotov.

One comes right for my face. I slide underneath. I dig my fingers into one of the boards when I met a sudden gap. Rope stairs meet my gaze in the gaping opening as I skid to a halt. To my southeast, a hook nicks my right leg. I cry out in pain and anger. Back to the bridge, I press a foot on one of the planks. More razor serpents swarm me.

Hooks from the east wrench the supports right off my feet. I clench onto the old wet docks, hurrying back up. Staring back at the other side, I make a leap. 

My foot lands and I make my target. I desperately search for any possible shelter. The insignificant rubble won’t do.

Suddenly, the entire floor collapses on one side, destroying all other pathways below, taking me off my feet. Gripping like a hungry tick on a deer, I grab with every last bit of strength I have onto a secure board. A thunderous crack booms from the impact. 

My hands give way. Quickly, I grab onto a splintered support, grinding my teeth as the fiber of my gloves is scraped off. A set of seven hooks fire from the cloud cover, pursuing me. 

I continue to descend. An officer above falls, their body plunging towards me. I throw myself to my left. I look below and see the body plummet into the void.

Recovering officers appear through the fog, north of the falling corpse. My mouth creases. I continue lowering myself as more flashes of steel whoosh by me.

Then, as fast as the nest of hooks came, their activity abruptly stops and they retreat. I jump to the nearest stable ledge, spit on the floor, resting my hands on my knees. The other officers begin to huddle around me.

\---

Looking into the mist below, I can see the broken carcass of the man that took the fall. 

*"JESUS!"* I yelp, adverting my gaze before slowly turning around, arms fanned out at my side. The victim's blood spreads in a massive still pool. And his hideous ropy muscles have burst from the skin, like chum from a meat grinder.

"Wha…?" I mutter, seeing that the poor soul had created an impact depression on…a sheet of metal? After blinking a few times, I notice that he had collided not with the piers from before, but with a giant factory silo instead.

Wasn’t there nothing but docks and here before?

"Stress must be getting to my head and making me see things. We never went past anything like this on the way up here,” I think as I rub my eyes and rapidly thrash my head to snap out of it. 

A knot grows in my throat when I realize that this was not my imagination.

The gargantuan container was still there. 

One of the officers next to me hyperventilates. With reluctance, I signal the rest of the force to make haste to the opening.

\---

The moment I reach the entrance to the side of the metal tower, I drain my stomach of its contents, for the violent smell of sewage had replaced the oxygen in my nose with stink. Every square inch of this structure is layered in more foaming viscera than the previous like baklava. When I get done vomiting, my eyes focus on the roof. 

The smokestacks had a short, fat, almost zit appearance.  A message is written on each of them, but their white paint blended with the mist, so trying to read them was useless. 

Snakes of worn conveyor belts wrap around and above the structure. Looking below, I see a collection of six glass tanks lurking below the metal scaffolding, leaking with fly-swarmed guts. Seconds after my eye catches the heaps of waste, the flies seek a new target: my legs. Once I get done slapping the varmints away, I turn around and clear my throat.

"Search for any clues you can find on how to get us the hell out of here. Do I make myself clear?" I declare.

"Yes, lieutenant." they all reply.

The puce, rusted entrance door wails on its hinges. An armada of midges fills the air, turning the interior into a snot green. For small moments when the pricks with wings decide to clear up, unidentifiable green and red sludge with specks of dead mackerel is visible. They form a horrid mixture similar in appearance to van Gogh's Starry Night, except if he had a stroke while making the final piece. 

Throughout the open silo are loose metal plates either hanging by loose bolts or partially submerged in the mire. What appears to be a ladder surrounded by a concrete cylinder appears through the horrid fly mist.

Pointing to loose catwalks dangling like air bombs in a warplane, I motion the rest of the squadron to follow. Combinations of splats, cracks, and clangs echo through the vast silo with each footstep. I step foot on one of the catwalks dipping into the broth. 

My hairs perk up as I hear something slam shut. I look back. The entrance door shut by itself. Then, I hear a voice of a young man. 

"Wh-wh-who's there?" his voice echoes.

"Sir, we are here to get you out of here. We are the Wilmington police. Do you know where the other two people are?" I call out.

A person in their early 20's hangs on the rafters near the southwest corner. We follow his voice. As I get closer, I see that his hair is a fiery golden color with its luster sapped dry from the cap of sweat covering his scalp. 

When I look down at his torso, I see that he has a somewhat muscular build, signaling that he has been eating. A chum-painted shirt with "Roses are red, violets are blue, if you are from California, fuck you" written on it stays on his torso by shreds. 

His lips and skin are dryer than the Sahara, peeling off in strips like that of a shedding lizard. As he grabs onto one of the metal supports to lower himself, he silently groans as the skin from his chapped hands splits open.

The strange person drops from the rafters, landing right in the muck with a slosh. He begins speaking in short stutters. "What?" I pull him out of the strange goo.

"What happened to them?"

"I have no idea what you are talking about; there is no one here except me."

I cock my head to the side, pausing for a bit. "What is your name, son?"

"Andrew Durante. Who sent you here?" One of his eyes scrunches up.

"Your mom?”

“My momma died of cancer when I was 15. Who the hell are you talking about? I think you have the wrong person."

I gasp. 

Searching this structure was all for nothing.

I motion one of the officers to hand over the wheel marked bag.

"Do you know where you got this or what this symbol is? We found traces of meth across one of the segments of the docks. Answer."

"Where did I get that bag? I've never seen it before."

"Bullshit."

"I just woke up here yesterday. I don't know how the hell that bag ended up here. Can you cut a guy some slack?"

He squints at the bag's insignia. His mouth opens in epiphanous wonder.

"Wait a second," he whispers. "That symbol seems somewhat familiar, but I just can't put my finger on it." 

His smile slowly vanishes the second he looks down at the revolting stew. The high-strung fellow puts a hand above his brow, leaning towards the distance. Panicked words begin to spew out of his mouth. "We must ascend that ladder up there. Right. Now. I've been here for a day; I know what I am talking about!"

Catwalks begin to swing like the pendulums of a clock in an earthquake. Metal panels begin to shift like whipped cream in coffee. Several officers, including myself, fall off the edge of the panels right into the gunk. 

The rancid smell makes me vomit once again, which paints my uniform muddy green, matching the goo. Excrement and fish guts latch onto my bulletproof vest, losing their grip after a few seconds. I turn in the direction of rapid, violent vibrations. A tail fin shears through the vat's contents. Seven blow holes, God knows how many yards apart, spray out blood, showering the crackled skin of the creature. Andrew's teeth clench as he wheels towards another officer.

And we immediately bolt.

Something yanks me under the soup. Barnacle-like teeth crush my leg. Tides of slurry fill my insides as I open my mouth to scream. I pull out my gun and fire at the being. It lets out a bellow and releases its grip, pursuing other people.

I swim to the ladder. People begin scrambling up it. In seconds, something charges at it with the force of an angry bull, ripping the ladder from its concrete cylinder and the hole, taking the climbers with it.

A segment of catwalk falls in front of me. I ascend it and spit out the watery manure, pouring all the adrenaline I can.

Officers crowd the metal door at the entrance. One officer yanks it open. Gallons of more fish guts and waste pour in, causing it to fly open like a cork on a champagne bottle. Pouring in with the fluid also came the strange hooks from the area previous.

More crashes resonate, causing the brown, crimson, and quicksilver slurry to pulse the more it rises. My platform swings, careening right into a wall, flinging me back first into it. Shaking off the sudden pain, I continue my run, trying to catch up to my troops.

The disgusting ooze grows higher.

Two gigantic human arms snatch up an unlucky hanging officer. An eyeless, ice white sperm whale's head with an unnatural number of torn fish fins, opens its massive jaws and begins chewing on the unfortunate woman before spitting her pulverized remains into the goo.

Then, a separate pair of anaconda-like hands from the south spear out from the muck. 

The creature had brought in a pack.

I see the hole where the ladder once led to and sprint towards its maw.

Platforms all around collapse, throwing me off. Nothing but red, brown, and silver covers my eyes as I am submerged in the scum, making the opening morph into an amoeba shape. A feeling of a tight bear trap surrounds one of my legs once again.

Instinctively, I fire my gun until nothing but clicks sound from it. I blindly inspect my belt. 

No clips left. 

I reach the edge of the hole, tighten my hand around it, and wheel around and drive my other fist into the eldritch creature's snout. It flees. Andrew throws out a hand as I scamper up the borders of the hole. I snag it. He yanks me from the group of monsters.

A geyser of body fluids erupts as one of the leviathans tries to shimmy through the opening.

"Save yourself! Shut the hatch!" Andrew yells before I hurl the hatch closed, sealing it. Bangs and gurgles pound at the door. 

"We can save the rest of my men!" I shout.

"The creatures have already finished them off! We'll all be in worse trouble if one of those things escapes!" I place my hands and an ear on the hatch again, shutting my eyes. I release one last deep breath before pressing my ear against the icy metal hatch once more. 

Silence.

"Sorry, comrades." I whisper to the door, taking my hat off in respect. 

For a moment, all is quiet. I stretch my shoulders back and release another deep breath. Not going to cry over this; I’ll save my tears after I’m out of this pickle.

Darkness enters my eyes as colors from the silo turned into midnight blue streaked with the deepest emerald green, most likely kelp stalks. The wooden piers and metal scaffolds above the silo, mysteriously, were gone. I rub my temples as a cluster of confusion fills my head. My eyes glance at my nose. 

Nothing but eerily warm and relaxing water surrounds me, yet somehow, I am breathing normally. The liquid does not pound on my eardrums, either. 

I shake my head. Andrew rests a hand on my shoulder.

"Don't let this place make your head spin. I don't understand the nature of this place either."

His eyes turn to the ground as he rests his butt against the backs of his shoes. The metal below us raps and squeaks as Andrew sways in thought. 

"Breaking Wheel…" he whispers. "The bag belongs to Breaking Wheel…"

I lean forward. "Hm?"

He gets up. "What do you think is the largest meth cartel in the United States, officer?  I'll give you a hint: if you or anyone in the Wilmington police can name it, it's the wrong answer."

My eyes focus on the slurry dispersing from my uniform before turning back to him. "How do you know about this?"

"I once served as an underground supplies transporter for Breaking Wheel. Had a route from Dallas to Charlotte. I'm 22 years old and worked for them for about three years in exchange for a shitload of dough, quitting ‘cause I got cold feet. To lower my chances of consequences with the law, I confessed every bit of info I knew in exchange for a light jail sentence of one year."

My head tilts to the side. "But, how did you end up in this labyrinth?"

"I was in my apartment two days ago, looking for ways I could get into college through a reformed criminal program. Suddenly, these strange brutes in suits knock me out. Next thing I know, I woke up on one of the floors below the ocean. Specifically, this area." 

He pauses. "Speaking of weird people, about that woman that sent you here. Looks like you were tricked by the cartel’s spies. Breaking Wheel has a habit of making people vanish if someone even whiffs a clue to their existence. Paranoid doesn’t even come close to describing their actions. But enough talk, we need to head up to the surface."

The reformed criminal begins thrusting his hands down through the black water and kicking his legs. As I rise with him, the metal cylinder, belts, gears, and all, is consumed by the obsidian pit. I scan my head, taking in the sights of more of the undulations. Oil black water swirls around my body as pulses of light suddenly break through the shadows.

Soon, graphite grey docks come into view, highlighted by unholy lusterless light. 

Upon rising from the blackness, my hand clenches against the rotted boards. Freshly made grooves, surrounded by a forest of splinters, touch my fingertips. When I pull myself up, I look at the ground before freezing. My stomach drops.

"Not again…" I whisper. Fresh hook marks gouged the floorboards of the docks. Accompanying the slashes were the same shabby fishing huts from earlier. One of the steel dragons flashes by my head. I begin sprinting.

Andrew follows behind.

More hooks swoop down like executioner axes. 

A rather large hut comes into sight. I promptly signal the man to take cover. He scrambles inside. I throw the door shut and lock it.

"We wait here until the hooks vanish. Do I make myself clear?" 

Andrew nods frantically. 

Wallboards fly off from the beams of the hut. From the openings, groups of dagger-like hooks come in.

Pain scatters throughout my body when two of them sink into my arm. I grit my teeth as I gently pull out the fearsome barbs; large chunks of skin and thick fluids rise through the lesions. More hooks coil around boards, ripping them off.

In one of the rooms of the hut is a massive gutted hole belching out light. I run over to it. I stick my head into the opening, spotting an unknown area with a chaotic storm on the other side. Cloaked by fog, I can see a single boat in the distance. 

This was the exit.

"Follow me!" I dive into the splintered hole. More pain rockets up my nerves.

\---

In sync, all the crooks take out their knives and slice into their bellies. From the lacerations, they hold out their hands as if conjuring a spell. Their inner organs begin to slink out with their command. To my shock, not a single one winced. The only discernible expressions on their faces were perpetual glares.

Mud and algae slithers on my hand as I wipe my palm against one of the stones. My leg begins to skid off the rock, with the oxidized green color marking my pants and the wounds becoming painfully frosted with moist dirt as I struggle to pull myself up.

Andrew leaps out of the portal, promptly slipping on his landing zone. I thrust my arm out, pulling him towards me. When he regains his balance, I let go, look down and wipe the detritus from my pants. My eyes widen as I stare at the hole I came in. 

I’ll be dead by the time I figure out how this teleportation garbage works.

My gaze turns to the gloomy horizon. Violent thunder echoes throughout the lethal churning sky. Tapping sounds of the most chaotic rainstorm against the stone platforms accompany the drumming. Water bordering the rocks is filled to the brim with mincemeat liquid. Thousands of dead human bodies and animal corpses bob in the muck. I groan at the sight.

I raise my hands in defense when something sharp pokes at my feet.

A hook, like those from the previous floors of the tower.

Raising the claw, larger than a banana, I caress its side. To my surprise, it is not cold like the steel of the structures. I rub my thumb on one of my fingernails. Then it hit me. 

The hooks are not steel.

They’re *keratin based*.

“How could someone create this?” I wonder.

From the corner of my eyes, a group of goons appear from the mist. Each is covered in scars as if they were hieroglyphs in a tomb. Carelessly stitched skin masks plaster their faces except at the eyes and mouth, which are loosely threaded with tendons. 

In sync, all the crooks take out their knives and slice into their bellies. From the lacerations, they hold out their hands as if conjuring a spell. Their inner organs begin to slink out with their command. To my shock, not a single one winced. The only discernable expressions on their faces were perpetual glares.

I draw my weapon, not giving a rat’s ass that I was out of ammo.

“Wilmington Police! Put your hands in the air!” I shout.

Their march continues.

One of the thugs flails a cluster of fleshy tendrils at the former criminal like whips, spraying gastric acid everywhere. Andrew jumps back. 

We book it. I throw my gun at the nearest goon, hoping to Jesus Almighty that it distracts them. Turning back, the weapon sinks into his veiny skin like a hand in syrup. Soon, his chest cavity swallows it up, entangling it within his entrails.

I turn my head forward, squinting in the distance at our getaway boat.

The sound of bubbling from the decaying broth makes me face one of the lakes of guts. Another criminal stands in our path, cracking his neck to the left. Seconds later, a tentacle of guts shoots through the air, flying faster than a supersonic plane, missing my head by a whisker. I throw a punch square in the jaw. Before it has a chance to connect, it’s mask falls off. 

“What the hell?!” I yell. 

A horrid lacerated face sneers at me. Colorless, bleeding skin makes up its face, lumpy and pockmarked, almost resembling coral.  

Its jaw dislocates like a snake, revealing a colony of rising molars leading down to its gullet. That thing clamps its jaw shut on my wrist. Nostrils flaring in agony, I throw a windmill punch, only for it to sink into the giant’s guts. Arteries and ligaments surround my arm, burrowing into my skin. Fluid drains from my extremities.

I let out a scream. Both my arms turn a gangrenous purple; jaundice yellow blisters the size of golf balls rise and explode with a stench like sewage.

Every time I try to yank out my arms, they retract with a vile sucking sound. I try to pull myself free. Tugging only makes it sink deeper.

“Come on!” I shout. Then I press my boots into the masked creature’s chest, forcing my arms out even harder than before.

By the time I get my hands freed, the natural apricot tone returns and the skin bubbles stop frothing. I shake off the urine yellow pus from my arms.

When I continue heading for the boat, a burst of crimson comes into existence. In bizarre unison, the entrails leave streaks behind their path. I turn back.

A vortex of guts was conjuring and sucking in the carrion. 

At its base, a set of unrecognizable legs form. Keratinous tendons and flesh tentacles spring out from a mass. Seconds later, they pull me off my feet.

When the wind ceases, I find its source: 

\-a disgusting, fish-frog amalgamation.

Its revolting human head twists as if someone flayed the skin from its head and contorted it with a wine corkscrew. The horrid mouth blossoms like a scarlet jellyfish. Its horrid throat churns like a maelstrom of muscle and mucus. Its eyes are on the ends of snail-like stalks.

Andrew immediately slices through the barbed tentacles. Pouring everything we have, we make an escape. The creature jumps out in front of us, throwing its conundrum of wiry cords at us. 

Andrew and I sprint to the east. Poseidon's nightmare leaps in front of us again. More of the masked murderers attack us from behind. Andrew throws a small rock into the creature's eye, causing it to howl in pain. It promptly dives into the meaty liquid, signaling Andrew and me to move. 

I make 100 meters before glancing over my shoulder, noticing Andrew is missing. Spinning on my heels, I scan the area like a hummingbird on crack.

"Fuck!" Andrew yells, grabbing onto one of the damp stones. I glance over. One of creature's tentacles wrapped around him. My fingers grip onto the slimy appendages. 

I rip its coils off my friend, shredding my hand. I cry out in pain and continue to sprint to the boat along with Andrew, diving onto the metal and plastic deck the instant the opportunity strikes. Andrew bolts to the steering cabin.

"Start the boat! Start the boat! Start the BOAT!" I holler. My sights catch a lone harpoon gun and spears on the bow. I run towards it and fire every harpoon I can find right at the creature's eyes.

The creature lets out a roar but continues galloping. 

The boat doesn't start. 

Andrew turns his head around, twisting the ignition again.

Nothing. 

"*GET US OUT OF HERE!*"

The engine finally awakens on the fifth attempt. He forces the lever back. Water jets out from the back of the boat like celebratory confetti.

Middle fingers extended; I look back at the creature and its posse of goons with the most shit-eating grin I can muster. The creature replies with a strained bellow as it attempts to extend its arm out. My smug smile vanishes when the frog's pulsating body suddenly morphs back into the fish guts it was born from. Soon, the ruffians bellow back at me shaking their fists.

Andrew turns around and looks at me, fear sculpted in his face. "What the hell are those?!”

I just stare back at him.

Chaotic waves startle me as the beaches of North Carolina come into view once more. The sea mist forms constellations on the boat as light reflects off the droplets left behind. I stare up at the cloudless sky, which doesn't calm me down even an inch. 

A piece of paper sticks out of one of the compartments. I pull it out, spotting a map of United States with dots everywhere. Markings for something. My fingers tremble at the markings of Texas and North Carolina.

Two of the dots are on Dallas and Charlotte, the locations Andrew once traveled.

In the top left corner is a ship’s wheel matching the one on the bag. For some reason, there is a faded extra spoke that doesn’t belong, so I turn the paper around. The same circular marking is on the back. There is also a crude drawing of a human. Paired with it is an acronym.

CLOTS:

Cartilage

Ligament and

Organ

Transmutation

Sorcery

My teeth chatter despite the heat blanketing me. I put my radio to my mouth, hands still shaking.

“Squadron, do you copy?” the mike hollers back.

“Yes, I copy. All my men were wiped out except for me. I’ll tell you everything when I get back.”

“Rose. You aren’t going to believe this, but the chief got a call from Charlotte saying that another group of people has vanished. Their last trace was a bag with a ship’s wheel. Head back to the station immediately.”

I then remember the portals, the rest of the nature defying structure, and the acronym.

Just what kind of cartel is this, exactly?

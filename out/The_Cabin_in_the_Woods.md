This is just a short paranormal experience I had last summer, that I wanted to share.

It was summer in Canada and I, along with two of my friends have planned to spend a few days camping. We actually found a small cabin that was available on these small cabin grounds for cheap. (It was a large piece of forested land by a lake with a bunch of cabins scattered around, and you could rent them for however long). We booked the place last minute and decided to go there instead of camping. If you have ever been to northern Canada then you know how baren the place is with a man-made structure every couple of kilometres, with forest all around us.

3 hours later when we arrived it was maybe around 4 pm we met with the owner which lived in a distant larger cabin nearby, and after talking and paying for our stay we went off to our cabin. The cabin was small with a stream leading up to a larger lake right beside the cabin. and a small fire pit out front. There was dense forest pretty much all around us, being that far out we had little to no service. We took advantage of the daylight and took out some kayaks which came with the cabin and explored our surroundings.

As it got dark we set up a small campfire in front of the cabin in the firepit and just talked. A massive thunderstorm snuck up on us and it soon started to rain. Since it was raining we didn't bother to put the fire out since it was already basically going out by itself.

We went inside and got ready for bed. The beds were all in the same room so we just talked for the most part since we couldn't fall asleep, with the thunder in the distance and rain pattering on the window of the cabin. My two friends decided to go outside to have a cigarette, since I didn't smoke I just tagged along for fun.

I was behind them and as they opened the door they said "Hey the fire is still lit" I thought to myself "How could it still be lit? It was raining and the fire was basically going out by itself?" I looked over their shoulders and saw the fire still burning away as if it was just lit and was burning at full strength. Just after that they kinda froze and whispered "What's that?" before yelling and running back into the room and slamming the front door shut. I couldn't get a visual of what they saw because I was all the way behind them and it happened way too fast, so I assumed they were joking around, but the expression on their face just showed pure fear so I took it seriously and we all went into our bedroom and locked the door behind us.

They were clearly frightened and completely out of breath. I asked them what they saw and they explained that they saw a wispy white figure that went being a pine tree which was about 15 feet from the firepit. The figure apparently moved very quickly and then popped its head out to the side of the tree before hiding again. They described it as almost like smoke but moved like it was a person being around 6-7 feet tall. I peaked out the window to see if it was still there and I didn't see anything except for that fire still burning.

We basically stayed up all night and never saw my friends that afraid, especially with one of them being in the military, he just held his knife next to the chest while lying in bed and staring at the ceiling not saying a word the whole night. In the morning we tried finding an explanation for it and we couldn't come up with anything. We spoke to the owner about it and he told us he would be on the lookout.

I wish I could have seen it for myself, but they swear by what they saw and it was definitely nothing they have ever seen before. We still couldn't find an explanation for what happened that night.

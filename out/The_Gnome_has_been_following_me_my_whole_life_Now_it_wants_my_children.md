Growing up, my mother was a keen gardener, but one thing we never had amongst the dahlias and snapdragons was a garden gnome. 
Still, there was one with me almost everywhere I went, whenever I was alone. It turned up one day and has never truly left. Now it seems it wants my children. 


It started when I was about seven years old, and although memories can be unreliable, I believe it started with a dream. 


Whenever I think about the gnome, or whenever he comes back to visit me, I immediately think of that dream, so for whatever reason, in my mind there is an inexplicable connection between the dream I had and the small, antagonistic presence that has followed me around for almost 35 years  


So my story shall begin with the dream that I believe started it all. 


I was with my father at the dairy, playing in the yard while he milked the cows. I was happy, and the smell of cow shit and grain and milk, and the sound of the dairy motors whirring made me feel safe. 
Suddenly a dark clouds overcame the entire sky, and the air around me grew cold and dense. 


There was a boom. 


It wasn't thunder - I don't know what it was - but it was almost more of a feeling than it was a sound. I felt it in my chest, and each breath became a conscious struggle, as though the only reason I was alive was because I was going to great lengths to ensure my lungs kept inhaling and exhaling.

 
Inhale. 

Exhale. 


I heard a voice, or rather, I FELT a voice. 


"She's going to die if you don't go home" 


Instantly I thought of my mother, and I began to run. I was a lean and small girl, and my legs could carry me quickly. The breathing was no longer difficult, but while I attempted to place one foot in the other as fast as possible, my momentum was that of a turtle, a snail; it was as though someone had hit the slow motion button a VCR. 


A lifetime later and I arrived at my home. The speed of my movement had returned to normal, and yet my breathing became a laborious task yet again. 


I entered my mother's bedroom, yet it was a different room. The best way I can describe it is Victorian era, decorated purely in white. The walls were white, the timber floors, the wardrobe, the lampshades, and the large wrought-iron framed bed my mother lay in. All white. 


Her body was a small lump under an otherwise perfectly smoothed white blanket. I could see her dusty blonde hair protruding, but I could not see here face. 


"Mummy?" I queried. 


There was no response. I stepped to the side of the bed in an attempt to see my mother's face, but nothing. 
Just her hair. 


I decided I'd have to climb onto the bed in order to see her, but I was interrupted as I took the first, cautious movement toward my goal. 


"Don't touch the bed" 


I stopped. I froze. 


The voice was coming from behind me, and as I tuned around I saw an identical bed to my mother's,  but much, much smaller. 

In the bed lay my mother's childhood doll, the type common in the 1950's, made of hard plastic, with eyelids that rolled open and shut when you tipped her head back or forward. In reality, my mother's doll was quite worn, covered in scratches and scuffs, clothes long gone, eyes that were forever closed, and her hair was a matted black mass. 


The doll in the miniature bed in my dying mother's bedroom stared at me, eyes wide open. 


Susan. 

Susan was in perfect condition. 


I turned back toward my mother, again, with the intention of climbing on the bed to garner some comfort or reassurance from her. But Susan's voice stopped me in my tracks,  yet again. 


"If you touch the bed, your mummy is gonna die". 


This is when I woke up. 


The following day, or maybe even the following week, or the following month, I was riding on the four-wheeled ATV with my dad - the "4 wheeler" as we called it - checking the cows in the top paddock, holding on to his waist and leaning across beside him so I could see ahead.
Suddenly I became very afraid that something terrible was going to happen. 


What if my dad has a heart attack and loses control? 
What if a tyre blows and we run into a tree? 
What if I fall off and get crushed by the tyres? 


And then I felt something touch my back. I reached behind me and felt something cold and hard. Loosening my grip around my dad's waist, I turned around to see the garden gnome sitting on the storage rack behind me. 


Just imagination. 


I turned around again, clenching my dad's waist as though my life depended on it. Perhaps it did. I truly believed it did, in any case. 


When dad pulled in at home and we got off the bike, I was too afraid to look behind me, but I knew it was still there. I could feel it. 


I didn't tell my dad - or anyone - because I wasn't sure if it had really happened. I wasn't sure anyone would believe me, and I also wasn't sure if vocalising it would make it real. 

In a way, I guess I liked to think that if I didn't acknowledge it or even think about it, then it wouldn't be true. 


I suppose that's seven year old brains for you. Although, having said that, my brain never changed in that regard. It never grew up, it just  learned to adapt to differentiating between what was imaginary and could hurt you, or what was real and could hurt you. And it took about another twenty years to do it, to be fair. 


As children do, I went on about life as normal. I can't provide any more specifics about how the rest of that day unfolded, or even subsequent days, until the second time the gnome appeared, which was also the final time it ever appeared when I was not alone. 


It was at the dinner table and mum was serving roast beef and vegetables. As she was dishing our food on the plates, I asked for more potatoes. My mum joked that I'd turn into a potato. My eldest sister joked that I was a pig, that I wasn't more important than anyone else, that I didn't deserve more potatoes because I was a retard. 


The horrible, sinking feeling came over me. I recognised it to be the same feeling I experienced on the 4 wheeler, and suddenly I imagined that my mother might never dish me up roast potatoes again. That she would die in a horrible car accident, slip while on the ladder pruning the grape vine, just go to sleep and not wake up. 


As I battled with these images I took my plate and turned to make my way to the kitchen table, and there it was, sitting confidently as the cold and unmoving centrepiece to our family dinner. 


The Gnome. 


I suppose the image may be almost comical to you - a family sitting around a table, kids bickering, parents telling them to clean their plates, and an innocuous garden gnome sitting at the centre, unseen by all but one little girl. 


Just imagination. 


I watched my parents and my sisters, waited for them to say something about the gnome, waiting for them to notice. I tried to pretend all was normal, but I just couldn't take my eyes off it. The jovial, red-cheeked grin. The little blue hat. The little red sweater with yellow buttons down the  centre, hands clasped in front of him, close-to but not quite in prayer position. 


"What s wrong with you?" My older sister chided, "Didn't you get enough potatoes, pig-bum?" 


My mother told her to sush,  I lunged at her with my knife, pretending to stab her in the arm but safely distant enough to miss. 


Someone shouted at me - mum or dad, I don't remember - and I was sent to bed without finishing my dinner. 
I peeked around the door and saw my sister greedily claiming my roast potatoes as her own. 


"She's so annoying" she said. My parents told her again to be quiet. 


The Gnome was gone. 


Retrospectively, I think it just needed me to know, or to truly believe, that it wasn't afraid to appear when other people were around. 


It wanted me to know that it was there just for me. 


I can't tell you how many times I've seen it in my life, and I've tried for the life of me to figure out why he always turns up at unexpected times. But there's no sense to this. None that I can see.


As a child, it started to be every morning before I was getting ready for school; while brushing my teeth, getting my shoes on, waiting outside for everyone else to finish getting ready so we could walk to the bus stop. 
He showed up when I was trying to get to sleep, sitting on my chest in the dark, already struggling to sleep because I was scared I wouldn't wake up. 


The gnome was there whenever my parents went out, which was rarely. I'd sit up in the dark, chair pulled up to the window, watching the car headlights approach on the road and waiting to see the indicator that would signal they'd returned, safe and sound. 
He sat on the verandah in front of the window, staring at me while I stared beyond him at the road. 


He was with me when I showered, either perched on the cabinet or toilet, sometimes even in there with me. He spared me the privacy of using the toilet, which is something to be thankful for, at least. 


He was sitting on my bedside table when I desperately tried to stay awake after watching Fire in the Sky. I believed, at twelve years of age, that because I'd seen that movie and knew the truth, the aliens would come to get me. 
As I mentioned earlier, it was a long time before I could differentiate between reality and imagination, between what could hurt me, what was real, and what was not. 


His expression never changed; it was a perfectly unremarkable gnome, but its eyes, its smile, its constant presence haunted me still. 


I didn't like to be alone, which contradicted my introverted nature. Wherever I could be in the presence of others, I would, and I hated it, but not as much as being stared at by The Gnome. 


As a teen I started smoking weed, and for a while the gnome stopped visiting me. It took a while for me to make the connection, because of course I usually smoked weed with at least one friend, and of course I was high, so my focus was music and munchies. 


But then I started smoking by myself, and the first time I did was when it dawned upon me that my little ceramic antagonist was no longer stalking me in my solace. 


I snuck the bong into the bathroom, turned on the exhaust fan, and stood on the toilet to blow out the smoke. As I descended from  my podium, I expected it to be there's sitting on the cabinet, or even in she shower waiting for me to join it. 


But he wasn't there. 


My nemesis, my torturer, my captor was not there. 


I started smoking every day, and even smoked at school while I was in my final year, just so I could use the quiet study room alone and not be afraid. 


The peace was at first welcome to me; deserved, wonderful, beautiful. But it was also deafening. Sometimes, I admit, I missed The Gnome. Perhaps it was some form of Stockholm Syndrome, but I wondered why, after ten years, it had suddenly stopped caring about me. 


But I got on with life, forever stoned and alone when I wanted to be. 


When I completed high school I travelled to London, and as I walked down the airport gangeay a sense of absolute terror and dread overcame me. 


What had I done? 


For the entire flight I was terrified. I was certain the plane was going to crash, watching the facial expressions on the air hostess' faces every time they moved  sat down, got up. 

I watched the flight map obsessively, telling myself where the airports were, way down below, the oceans, the mountains, checking the altitude for changes. 


Of course, The Gnome reappeared for the first time in a while, but something about it had changed. Its usual jovial expression had warped, ever so slightly. But there was no doubt in my mind that behind the slight downturn in the eyes there was a new expression: anger. 


This was the first time since my childhood that I began again to question what I was seeing, and what role it had or what it wanted in my life. I'd grown so accustomed to its presence in the past, but now The Gnome had been absent ao long and here it was there with me again, every step of the way, apparently now also angry at me. 


As we landed for our stopover in Bangkok, it was always there - in the waiting area, in the toilets, sitting beside the officer at the bag-check area. 


On the plane itself he sat in the aisle or on top of the seat in front of me. I slept rarely and not for long, but when I'd wake up it'd have changed positions. Always watching me, staring at me as I sat there terrified having convinced myself I was going to die in a plane crash. 


It was about two weeks in London before I made some friends, and those two weeks were torture. I missed my family, constantly fearing that one of them was going to die while I was so far away. The Gnome was usually on my pillow beside me when I woke up in the morning, and on my bedside table when I went to sleep at night. 


It started to smile again. 


Before long I started drinking and getting access to weed again, and of course it went away. Then - London being London in 2001 - I had regular access to cocaine, and my little nemesis was gone again for two years. I took a lot of drugs, drank a lot of alcohol, and had a lot of fun. I was happy to see it go this time, and in more ways than one, this is what I still consider to have been my two years of freedom. 


The return flight went just about the same as the first, however, I was less frightened because I'd spent two years flying quite a bit  and I had my family to look forward to this time, rather than the unknown of the other side of the world. 
The one thing that was identical was The Gnome. It was back, and it was angry again. 


After returning to Australia, I settled into smoking weed again. I went to University, worked as a barista, got married. It was 5 years later that I found out I was pregnant, and I knew I had to stop smoking. 


Around the same time, my husband got sick. The gut-churning, sick feeling from my childhood returned, and his illness turned him into a horrible person who said horrible things to me. 


"You're going to be a worthless mother" he'd say. The Gnome smiled. 


"What the fuck is this shit?" he'd ask when I cooked a dinner he didn't like. 


"Your family doesn't even love you" he'd chide. 


I was afraid every day, as my husband drank more and more, and the abuse became more and more frequent and cruel. Each day I considered that what he said might be true; that this baby would be better of without me. I lay on the bed and cried and cried. The Gnome sat here beside me, and it smiled and smiled. 


Not long after my beautiful son was born, I started smoking weed again. I always functioned well, was more aware and capable when I was high. I graduated from University with distinction and was a thoughtful and careful mother. 


Two years passed by when the depression started to overcome me and, for the first time while regularly smoking, The Gnome came back. My husband was no less nasty or cruel, but my son gave me a reason to keep going. I maintained my appearances - kept a tidy house, grew vegetables, took my son to the park and swimming lessons and playgroup - all the while dying inside.


I contemplated the end of my life every day. I stopped eating, I stopped doing things I enjoyed, and I became a shell of a human. All the while, The Gnome smiled on whenever nobody else was around.  


The most terrifying day of my life was the day it introduced itself to my son. 


He was two years old, playing happily in the living room while I baked chocolate cupcakes. As I looked up I saw my beautiful boy there, smiling, talking, and holding The Gnome in his hands. 


"Put that down!" I yelled. 


My son dropped it and immediately started to cry. I didn't usually yell at him - that was his dad's role - and he was understandably shocked and scared. 
I scooped him up and cuddled him, gently wiping away his tears as he sobbed into the sleeve of my blouse. 


I had nevdr touched it and didn't even know it was possible. But on thing became clear to me; The Gnome wasn't just here for me anymore. Now he was here for my son. 


A week later I checked into a distinguished private mental health facility. It was the most difficult three weeks of my life but, after the medication started to take effect, The Gnome was gone. 


I returned home to my husband and my son, and attempted to rebuild myself after having realised I was a mere thread of existance that had disappeared for three weeks out of my son's life. 


Now for an interlude, because it was many years before The Gnome reappeared. The anti-depressive medication I started taking, and continue to take, appeared to have put him to rest once and for all. 


I will try to summarise as best I can. 


I had another child 7 years later - another boy - who was and remains wonderful and happy and also sometimes challenging. 


I became a high school English teacher and began a great career, and you may be pleased to know that after 14 years of marriage to someone who made me feel like a worthless human every day, I found the courage to leave. That was 5 years ago, and now my children are 14 and 7 years old. I manage well on my own. Or rather, I did, until I started to get sick just over a year ago. 


The first time I went to the doctor with weakness, numbness, loss of vision, tremors, and severe muscle spasms, he told me I was "just describing anxiety". It was agonising, dehumanising, and it made me angry. Others around me believed, too. That I was just anxious. 


But it turned out not to be the case. 


Two months afterward I had another attack of the aforementioned symptoms, as well as electric shocks in my spine and head, severe migraines that lasted days, and tremors that took over my whole body. I started to fall over, tire easily, and sometimes faint. 


Eventually I was diagnosed with a rare, progressive neurological disease called Stiff Person Syndrome. My world almost shattered, but I can say there were only a handful of occasions where it truly broke me. After all, I had my boys. I had a goal; to stay strong, to stay mobile, to stay alive until they both became adults. 


The first line of treatment was IVIG - intra-venous immunoglobulin. For those of you who have never heard of it, it's a product made of plasma, and I sit in a hospital for about 4 hours once every 4 weeks, hooked up to an IV line, being filled with other people's antibodies to strengthen my immune system. 
I've had this treatment nine times now, but what I want to tell you about is the first. 


My children were scared, especially the little one. He has autism and a strong attachment to me, so he didn't know how to deal with all the sudden changes to my health and my life. 


I promised him, "Mum will just go to the hospital today, and then again tomorrow, and then I'll start to get better. My body fighters will win". 
I had referred to our immune systems as body fighters all throughout their childhoods so they'd understand the importance of eating well and looking after yourself. It came in handy. 


I arranged for my boys to stay with my parents on those two nights, as I knew there could be some side effects that I didn't want them to see. 


I didn't understand much about IVIG but I understood enough to know that there were some rare side-effects that could kill me. I prepared a will and got my affairs in order, but I told myself everything would be alright. I had to get home for my boys. 


Sadly, what I didn't know was that the rate at which it is infused is vital to ensure those side effects don't occur. On the first day as the nurses increased the rate under the doctors orders, I became sick. 
The migraine crept up slowly, the vomiting very suddenly. I was in agony, and yet the doctor continued to instruct them to "turn it up". 


I went home at 4:45, saw my boys briefly, took some painkillers, and went to sleep. The next morning I felt better, so off I went for round two. 
It went more smoothly, and I returned home at around 3pm. My parents brought my boys over again, and I hugged them deeply and told them how much I loved them, how proud I was. 


"You'll be able to come home with Mum tomorrow" I said. I believed it at the time. 


It was instantaneous. I felt a sharp, brutal force at the base of my skull. 
Agony was back, but like nothing I'd ever felt before. 
I checked my temperature; 38.9. 

Aseptic meningitis. 
Don't be dramatic. 
Aseptic meningitis. 
Aseptic meningitis. 
Aseptic meningitis. 


Don't be dramatic. 


I rang my dad. He was at my house within 5 minutes. 
Temperature; 39.1 


"I'm having a shower first. I think I need an ambulance" 


By the time I got out of the shower, I could hardly see, but there was a presence there with me. The lights were blinding, I keep reaching to the back of my head, surely, surely there's a knife in there. 


The pain. 

Temperature; 39.6. 

Ambulance. Blindness. Full body tremors. 


The pain. 


I remember lying on the bed in the resuscitation room, my dad's hand resting on my knee. 


The pain. 


My body writhed and convulsed in agony. 

Stiff Person Syndrome. 

Aseptic Meningitis. 

My boys. 

It's ok. It's ok. 


Its ok if I die. Everything will be ok. My boys will be ok. 
Life will go on. 


It's ok if I die. 


I opened my eyes momentarily and looked up at the ceiling. The nurses had turned off the lights, but at the bottom of my vision I saw something. 


It was The Gnome. Smiling down on me, smiling more than he'd ever smiled before. 


I closed my eyes, ready to die. 


... 


It was 3 days before I became fully conscious again. My immune system had been destroyed so I was in an isolated room. I rang my parents as soon as I could, and talked to my beautiful, beautiful children to truly confirm to them that I was still alive. 


After 7 days I went home, but life was different. I was scarred, my children were scarred. I won't go into details, but I was very dependent on my parents for several months afterward, and my youngest son had some serious setbacks for the rest of the year. 


I let him sleep in my bed with me from the time I returned from the hospital. He needed it. I needed it. 


One evening, about a week after I came home, we lay in bed and I asked him, as I do every night, "What was your favourite thing today?" 


He was quiet for a moment. 


"My favourite thing was that the gnome was just imagination" he said. 


My eyes widened. My heart raced, but I knew to breathe, to relax, to not let my boy see or feel my fear. 


"What do you mean my darling?" I asked, gently brushing the hair across his forehead, my soul quietly crushing inside of me. 


"I saw a gnome today. He said 'Dont touch the bed or your mummy will die' " 


I stared across at his beautiful little face, my heart shattering into a thousand pieces. 


"But he was just imagination".

Im writing this because I don’t know how much time I have left. That thing is coming closer and closer.
I’m shaking. I’m sorry if it is misspelled but I’m so scared. I don’t know what to do.
It all started last week. I was in our family house not far from a beautiful forest. Well I thought it was beautiful then. I was alone and I was bored so I looked up some games you can do alone. I don’t remember what it was called but I found it on google. The first thing I saw was a warning. “Never play this at night”. I thought to my self that it didn’t really matter but I regret it now.
There were some rules and then a description.
The rules was:
1. You can never check your phone the first 2 hours.
2. If you hear a whisper from your left side, run as fast as you can.
3. Never call anyone, they will count as another player.
4. Have a safe spot whit a ring of salt.
5. If the salt is turning black it’s Game over.

First you need to light up 6 candles in a circle. Put an empty box in the middle of the circle and put an empty notebook and a pen in the box.
Turn off the lights in the room and repeat the words 13 times. “I’m calling you, show yourself your beautiful creature” while you sit on your knees and beg to the circle.
After you have done that blow out 2 candles.
Turn around so you have your back agains the circle. Wait 1 minute.
Look at the circle again.
If it says “I’m here” on the notebook you have succeeded, if not light the candles again and repeat.
If you have succeed you are now a player. You can now blow out all the candles.
Your task is to run from the creature for the following 4 hours. But watch out for the angry lady in the bloody white dress, if she catches you, you will always be followed until you die or until you give up.
If she not catches you, you will have luck for the next 20 years.
If you feel like she is to close, step into the circle of salt. You can be in the circle 3 times but the circle can’t protect you if you step into it more than that.
When the 4 hours have passed without you being catched you have won.

I thought to my self that I’m gonna make this. It can’t be that bad. It will never work so I can just do it for fun.
I did what it told me to do but it worked. When I had turned around to the circe it was written on the notebook “I’m here but you have already lost”. I didn’t understand so I looked on my phone at the rules again and the it hit me. Never play this at night. Shit that was the first thing you couldn’t do. And then I saw that you weren’t supposed to look at the phone. I rushed to the circle but the salt was already turning black.
Why couldn’t I just have read it again and memorized the rules.
I saw her behind my right shoulder about 5 meters away.
I run out of the house, in to the forest.
I didn’t know what I was supposed to do. Maybe I could fix this. Oh boy I was so wrong. Every time I looked over my right shoulder I could see her a bit closer each time.
I ran into the house again and tried to go to sleep. But she was in my dreams to.
I haven’t slept in a week now but I’m trying to stay awake and don’t look over my shoulder.
But I couldn’t help my self to look. 
She was gone or at least I thought so.
I looked back at the notebook I was holding in my hands.
“You can never win, I will always be here”. I looked up and saw her right in the eyes.
I can’t remember much more. But I haven’t seen her since.
But I feel watched all the time and something in me is saying that I should give up.
I tried to call my dad but there was another lady who answered.
She said:
“Are you scared? I will always be in your head and I’m always watching you. It’s game over”

Update: I don’t feel like me anymore. She is in me and she is controlling me.

I think you should try this game because it’s very funny and you can win a bigger price than I could.

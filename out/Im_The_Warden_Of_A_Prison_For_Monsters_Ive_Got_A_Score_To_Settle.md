“So, I’m guessing Lia sent you to keep an eye on me.” I said as we left the Shawn Currie’s blood farm behind (what was left of it, at least.)

&#x200B;

“Yes and no.” The Siren replied. She sat in my passenger seat with her legs crossed and her phone in her hand, “She did suggest that I follow you to Curries, just in case. But I’ve technically been watching you since you walked into Benny’s place.”

“How encouraging.” I said, “So… Which one do you work for? Lia or Benny?”

“Neither. Names Shelby. I’m just here to kill Kayla. You’re going after her. I want in.”

“Is that all?” I asked skeptically, “And why exactly do you want her dead?”

&#x200B;

“Kayla used to be part of my community up on Silver Lake, right up until they threw her out. She’d gotten a little too ambitious with her hunting. Started killing too many people… We started worrying that she was drawing too much attention to us. I guess in the end we were right. About a year after she was thrown out, the Silver Lake community was gone and most of the sisters there were dead.”

“You blame her for it, then?” I asked.

“I do, yeah. If it weren’t for the shit she pulled, maybe they’d still be alive.”

&#x200B;

Well, if nothing else she was straightforward. Assuming she was telling the truth, that was easy to appreciate.

“What led you to New York, then?” I asked, “Don’t tell me you just happen to be after Moir too.”

“Never even heard of him.” She admitted, “But Kayla’s made a lot of new friends lately. She’s got them all fired up with this batshit crazy belief that they can ‘*fix the world*’ by ‘*taking back their place as the apex predator.*’”

&#x200B;

That actually made me laugh.

“Is that seriously what she believes?”

“As far as I can tell, yes… She was always a little out there but this is a new level of crazy if you ask me.”

“No shit. But, back to my question. What are you doing in New York?”

“That’s a bit of a long story…” Shelby admitted, “I don’t suppose you know who got Kayla sent to Ashurst in the first place, right?”

“The report I read said Robert Marsh was the one who brought her in.” I replied.

&#x200B;

Marsh… I admittedly hadn’t spoken to the man in several years. But he was still a good friend and we had a history together. Like me, he worked with the FRB although he operated more as a detective than anything else.

“Yes it was… And I was there when he did it.”

I looked over at her.

&#x200B;

“You worked with Marsh?”

“Not like, officially or anything. I’m not with the FRB. But he’s a friend. He helped us back during that whole incident with the Mau back in 91 and when he was looking for Kayla, he came to me for help. After I’d heard she’d gotten free, I reached out to him again. I wasn’t really looking to drag any of my other friends into this, and Marsh had already dealt with her once before. He was the only obvious choice. We met up in New York about a week ago looking for one of her financial backers.”

“Did you find them?” I asked.

&#x200B;

“Yup. Killed him too. He didn’t know where Kayla was, but he knew where to find a friend of hers. Some hotshot wannabe vampire King. Marsh and I were supposed to meet upstate to deal with him but… Well. Long story short, that didn’t exactly go well. We both got the shit kicked out of us. The Darlings picked me up while Marsh got shot in the chest and thrown in a river before he even made it into town.”

“Wait, Marsh got shot?” I asked, looking up suddenly.

“Yeah and he’s damn lucky to be alive.” Shelby said, “Last I spoke to him, he was still recovering but he *is* alive.”

&#x200B;

I breathed a quiet sigh of relief as my focus returned to the road.

“Any idea who shot him?” I asked.

“He didn’t say.” Shelby admitted, “Just that it was someone inside the FRB… Last I spoke with him, he seemed like he was in touch with someone else to help him deal with it. I wouldn’t mind checking in on him if I get the chance… If you want to come with, you can ask him yourself.”

“I’d very much like to.” I said, “So… You heard I was meeting with Lia and figured we’d be after the same person. So you’re just using me to get back into the hunt.”

&#x200B;

“Shitty way of putting it, but if that’s how you want to describe it.” Shelby said with a shrug.

“And how would you describe it?” I asked.

&#x200B;

“We want the same things and work with the same people. We’re on the same side here. Working together is just practical. I wasn’t sure if you’d be open to it at first, so I figured I’d just keep an eye on you from a distance and lend a hand when convenient… Since we’re talking now, I’m just gonna go ahead and assumed my plan worked.”

“Well next time, just ask me if I need another gun.” I said, “It might save me from getting manhandled by a giant fucking werewolf.”

Shelby laughed.

“Next time.” She promised.

&#x200B;

Once we were far enough away from the blood farm, Shelby and I stopped in a parking lot while I called Lia. Shelby got out of the car while I dialed my phone.

“I’m parched. You want a drink?” She’d asked, eying a nearby convenience store.

“Sure. I’ll take an iced tea if they’ve got it.”

&#x200B;

She gave me a nod and headed over towards the store, while I dialed Lia. She answered on the second ring.

*“Hello Warden? How goes the hunt?”*

“Nelson and Currie are dead. I’ve got a lead on Moir, but I could use a little more information.”

*“Of course you can.”* Lia said, *“What have you got?”*

“Apperantly Moir’s down at some old ship scrapyard on Staten Island. He said he had a partner down there, working on some sort of deal. I don’t suppose you’d know anything about it?”

&#x200B;

Lia seemed to think for a moment.

*“A scrapyard… I’m aware of it. Although I’m afraid I don’t know much. We know that Currie had visited the area a couple of times. Obviously there’s something going on down there but we never really pried into it. It wasn’t our concern.”*

&#x200B;

“So you’ve got nothing?”

*“I didn’t say that. I know that the place was fairly heavily guarded. More heavily guarded than a scrapyard full of abandoned ships should be. Whatever is going on there, they don’t want people snooping around. I’d advise you to be very careful about how you approach it… I don’t suppose you’ve met up with Shelby, have you?”*

“I have. And for the record, you could’ve told me you were sending backup.”

&#x200B;

*“Technically she sent herself. I just didn’t see any reason to stop her. Personally, if I were you I’d want the help. Now, regarding that scrapyard. Your best angle of approach might be to approach by water. I can help you there. If you’re still near Currie’s blood farm, there’s a marina about a half hour away. Give me about 45 minutes and I can have a boat there for you.”*

“I don’t suppose you can send more backup?” I asked hopefully.

&#x200B;

*“Depends. How long are you willing to wait?”* Lia replied, *“Give me a couple of days and yes, I could get some people together. But word of Nelson and Currie’s death will travel fast. The sooner you move, the better. By the time I get enough people together, they could already be gone.”*

“Fair enough… Figured I’d at least ask.” I said, “Send the boat, then. Shelby and I will figure out the rest”

“I’m sure you’ll manage.” Lia said, “Happy hunting, Warden.”

She hung up.

&#x200B;

I took out a cigarette to smoke and a few minutes later, I watched as Shelby walked out of the convenience store.

“Did you talk to Lia?” She asked.

“Yup.”

“So what’s the plan?”

“Well, according to her this place is going to be heavily guarded, so she’s sending us a boat to come at them by water.”

&#x200B;

Shelby laughed and offered me one of the bottles of iced tea she’d bought. I opened it and took a long drink.

“Well… Better than nothing, I guess. So we’re moving tonight, then?” She asked.

“Seems like that’s the plan so far.” I replied, “You still with me?”

“So long as it gets us closer to Kayla, I’m in.” She said.

That answer worked for me.

&#x200B;

The boat was waiting for us when we got to the marina, and I could see a single quiet figure waiting beside it. I parked my car nearby and got my gun case from the trunk before Shelby and I headed down to collect the boat.

&#x200B;

The figure passed Shelby the keys, before giving us a nod and leaving. As Shelby keyed the engine, I unmoored the boat. A few minutes later, we were out on open water.

&#x200B;

I opened my gun case and took out my Marlin. I fitted it with a night vision scope as we rode towards the scrapyard. I took a deep breath. If Moir really was here, I had a feeling that this wouldn’t be an easy fight.

&#x200B;

It didn’t take us that long to reach the scrapyard. In the absolute darkness that surrounded us, it was hard to see much as the boat took us closer. But I could smell werewolves nearby over the stink of the city water. This place was just as heavily guarded as we’d been warned. Shelby kept a wide berth away from the scrapyard and killed the engine a good distance away. I sat in the back of the boat, my rifle at the ready.

“How’s the position?” Shelby asked, “You want to get closer, further away…?”

&#x200B;

I looked down my scope to scan the derelict boats in the distance. All of them were little more than rusted out pieces of metal that barely looked stable enough to support the weight of a person. I felt like I could get tetanus just by looking at them. Still, I took my time to study every boat I could see until I finally noticed some movement.

&#x200B;

Up on one of the larger, sturdier looking wrecks were a couple of figures walking along the deck. From what I could see, they were armed.

“Up a little bit more.” I told Shelby, “Same distance for now… I can see some guards.”

&#x200B;

Shelby did as I asked, moving the boat up to grant me a better vantage point. The two men on the deck were smoking and talking. They didn’t seem to have noticed us.

“Perfect…” I said, once I was certain of my shot and Shelby had stopped the boat again. I lined up my shot to put a bullet in the first mans head, before squeezing the trigger.

&#x200B;

The rifle went off with a satisfying crunch and a split second later, I saw the first man jerk violently before falling. His friend froze up for a moment, struggling to process the fact that his buddy had just had his head blown off.

That moment cost him his life.

&#x200B;

“Jesus… You couldn’t silence that damn thing?” Shelby asked.

“I could… But I want them to hear the shot. You ever see what happens when you start crushing ants outside their nest?”

Shelby paused, before looking back at the boat.

&#x200B;

Sure enough, several dark figures were already pouring out. Through my scope, I counted about 6 of them.

“Now move the boat into cover.” I said, “Let’s make sure they see us.”

“You’ve got a plan here, right?” Shelby asked, as the engine roared to life once again, “Because I’m really hoping you’ve got a plan.”

&#x200B;

The boat took off towards another one of the rusted out tugboats, immediately adjacent to Moirs. I could hear the men on the boat yelling as they spotted us and see them scrambling to try and get a shot at us in the dark. A couple of them tried, but the bullets went nowhere near us.

“As a matter of fact I do. Get the boat behind one of those old ships. I’ll go up and take potshots at them, draw their fire. You use the water. Swim up, get on that boat and flank them. Then we find Moir.”

“Hey, so long as they’re shooting at you.”

&#x200B;

She pulled the boat up behind one of the rusted boats, just across from Moirs. I watched her strip off her jacket, leaving her in just a tank top and shorts. She kicked off her sandals and grabbed the gun. Shelby took one last look at me, and gave me a nod before she dove off the edge of the boat.

&#x200B;

As soon as she was gone, I started climbing up the rusted hull of the boat to draw the guards fire. From what I could see on the deck of the adjacent boat, there were roughly six or seven men out there. Most of them had seen me and were already shooting.

&#x200B;

I dove for cover inside the wheelhouse of the boat, taking a couple of potshots when I got a chance. I know for a fact I killed one of the men. But I don’t think I hit anyone else.

&#x200B;

I could hear them yelling amongst themselves and when I poked out of cover to shoot again, I could see a few of the men on the other boat starting to change. I managed to shoot one before he could go full Wolf.

&#x200B;

The other two who were in the middle of changing didn’t leave themselves exposed. One of them charged toward my boat, launching himself off the deck of Moir’s and soaring through the air before crashing against the hull of the boat I was on. I could hear claws scraping against metal as the werewolf struggled to climb.

&#x200B;

His companion made the same leap, although he did it better and crashed against the hull, a few feet away from me. The wolf snarled as it oriented itself after the jump. And I took advantage of the moment to pump three rounds into it. The Wolf let out a whine of pain before it hit the ground, dead.

&#x200B;

I won’t lie… It was a little satisfying to be getting this good at killing werewolves.

&#x200B;

On the hull of the ship, the last wolf was still struggling to climb although he hadn’t failed quite yet. He was making some progress as he pulled himself up onto the deck. I rewarded him with a bullet to the head and watched him fall uselessly back into the water. On Moirs boat, I could hear gunshots and looked over to see the last couple of men shooting at something else on the boat.

&#x200B;

I could see a dark figure sprinting between cover. Shelby. The stragglers didn’t stand much of a chance.

&#x200B;

As Shelby cleaned them up, I abandoned my cover in the wheelhouse and took a running jump from my boat, to Moirs. I landed on a bad part of the deck, right by the wheelhouse. I felt it buckle under my weight and I almost fell through, before I scrambled off of it.

&#x200B;

I looked up to see Shelby standing over me. She lowered her gun and offered me a hand to help pull me up.

“That could’ve gone a whole lot worse.” She said.

“Used to do this all the time.” I said, “Like shooting fish in a barrel.”

&#x200B;

“No shit…” Shelby glanced down at the bodies and kicked one over. She looked over towards a door, leading inside the ship, “Wanna see who they were guarding?”

“Very much so.” I replied, reloading my Marlin, “Let’s go find this sonofabitch…”

We headed for the door. Shelby got there first and pulled the lever to open it.

&#x200B;

As soon as she did though, the door just flew open. Something hit Shelby head on and flung her backwards. She hit the gunwale and let out a cry of pain before sinking limp to the ground.

&#x200B;

A dark shape with chestnut red fur burst onto the deck. Another wolf in tattered clothes. This one fixed me in its green eyes and I recognized him immediately.

Moir.

&#x200B;

His lips curled back in what was either a snarl or a grin.

***“Warden…”***

His voice was little more than a low, rumbling growl. His eyes narrowed before he lunged for me.

&#x200B;

I raised my Marlin to put a bullet in him, and I only got a single shot off before he’d grabbed the barrel. With inhuman strength, he crushed it in his claw before I could pull the trigger a second time. I still fired, moreso on instinct than anything else. The warped barrel exploded, and I saw Moir flinch slightly, although it didn’t slow him down. He ripped the broken gun out of my hands and tossed it aside before catching me with a backhand and sending me across the deck.

&#x200B;

I’d been smacked around by enough werewolves over the past couple of days that I was getting far too used to all this. I was up before he could come at me again and already going for my .45. I darted into the wheelhouse of the rusted boat and watched as Moir struggled to follow me.

&#x200B;

He couldn’t fit through the door as easily as I could and he reached one claw through, trying to grab at me. I put two bullets in him for his trouble and Moir didn’t stick around to put up with more. He just leapt up on top of the wheelhouse, where I couldn’t hit him. His weight made the metal ceiling sag and I shot at where I thought he was. The bullet didn’t go through the metal.

&#x200B;

For a moment, all was silent.

I could hear my heart pounding in my ears.

“Come on, Moir…” I called, “Finish what you fuckin’ started…”

&#x200B;

Above me, the ceiling bulged just over the far door to the wheelhouse and I steadied my gun to put another bullet in him the moment he dared show his face. If he came for me again, I’d need to make the next shot count…

&#x200B;

The window of the wheelhouse suddenly exploded beside me as Moir crashed through it. He’d changed again, leaving his wolf form and looking more human. His hands were still claws, but I could see his face. I turned to face him as he grabbed at my gun. I fired off two shots over his shoulder before he sank his teeth into my wrist, sending warm blood down my arm.

&#x200B;

My grip on my .45 slackened and he ripped it from my hands, hurling it aside. One clawed hand wrapped around my throat and he jerked me off the ground, slamming me up towards the ceiling, then tossing me aside.

&#x200B;

“Good of you to come and find me, Warden…” He said, his voice sounding more human now, “Wasn’t sure how I’d get to you in that prison of yours. So thanks for making it easy on me.”

I slowly picked myself up only for him to grab me by the head and send me crashing into the wall. Before I could get my bearings, he hurled me through the other window of the wheelhouse.

&#x200B;

Moir chose to leave in a more dignified manner than he entered. He strolled through the door, my .45 in his hand. He inspected it for a moment, before gingerly tossing it overboard.

“What’s a cowboy to do without a gun?” He asked, “Gotta say, you’re every bit as tough as I figured you’d be… But you’re out of tricks, Parker and I’m the one with the claws.”

&#x200B;

I could see him starting to change again, reddish fur growing over his arms. His head elongated into a more wolflike shape as he drew nearer to me. I saw him step around the rusted weak spot on the deck I’d landed on earlier.

***“Just so you know… This isn’t personal. Honestly, I always kinda liked you. But hey, business is business.”***

&#x200B;

As he spoke, I tried to pick myself up. Behind him, I could see Shelby on her hands and knees, starting to get her bearings. I saw her look up and grab for her gun, taking aim at Moirs back.

&#x200B;

Now, one might think that this would be the time for some smart ass comment, but I didn’t say a word. No point in tipping him off.

&#x200B;

As Moir reached down to grab me again, Shelby fired. The bullets tore into Moirs back, causing him to spin around, fixing her in a frustrated glare. While he was looking at her, I charged at him, throwing my weight against him.

&#x200B;

Moir stumbled back a few steps… Right to the spot on the deck where I’d landed earlier. I saw his eyes widen as the rusted metal buckled under his weight. One claw shot out to grab hold of the deck as he fell through, although the metal only barely supported his weight.

&#x200B;

Beneath him, I could see nothing more than a jagged scraps of metal. Not exactly a soft landing. Moirs body started changing again as he struggled to hold up his weight. His bones violently warped as he returned to human form, no doubt in a desperate bid to stay light enough to avoid falling. His hands remained claws though, his nails embedded into the metal to keep him anchored as he desperately tried to pull himself up.

&#x200B;

Shelby sluggishly stumbled to my side, the gun still in her hand and aimed at Moirs head. He looked up at her, then back at me, grimacing in frustration as he did.

“Well… Looks like you’re in a bit of a predicament…” I said, still breathless from the ass beating I’d just gotten.

“Looks like I am…” Moir replied, “I don’t suppose you’d be willing to be sporting and let me up, would you?”

&#x200B;

I crouched down so we could at least see eye to eye.

“Oh, I just might… How’s a cell at Ashurst sound? Better than what’s down there or worse?”

Moir laughed, before glancing at the jagged metal beneath him.

&#x200B;

“What’s the catch?” He asked.

“Del Rio. She hired you. You give her to me, and maybe you’ll get to see the sun again in a few decades. Sound good?”

“You want her? You can have her for all I care.” Moir said.

“Good. Then where is she?”

“I don’t know… She moves around. I haven’t seen her since she hired me.”

&#x200B;

Shelby put a bullet into the deck beside his head and Moir flinched.

“We need more than ‘I don’t know’.” She said.

“Well that’s what I’ve got!” He growled.

“Then I guess we don’t need you after all,” I said with a shrug, before standing up. I put my boot on his head and got ready to kick him off.

“H-hold on! Hold on a fucking minute! Just wait! I don’t know where she is *right now!* I might know where she’s going to be…”

I paused, but kept my boot on his head.

&#x200B;

“Talk fast and you might just get out of here alive.” I said.

“I’ve got an associate… A guy in town. Works for The Gentleman. Del Rio’s been working on something with him. I know that much. You find him, you’ll probably find her. Emi-”

&#x200B;

The sound of a gunshot echoed through the air. Moirs eyes widened as his final word turned into a scream. He fell into the hole, landing on the rusted metal beneath him. I watched as one jagged piece tore through his chest. He twitched and let out a final, strangled gasp… Then he went still.

&#x200B;

I looked over at Shelby, about to ask why the fuck she’d just shot him. But she looked just as confused as I was. I glanced at her gun. She hadn’t fired it. Both of us looked up.

&#x200B;

In the darkness, I could see a figure atop one the wheelhouse of one of the nearby abandoned boats. A man holding a rifle. Shelby raised her gun at him, although before she could fire, he vanished, dropping down onto the deck of his boat and disappearing.

&#x200B;

By the time we’d made it to the boat he’d been on, he was long gone. And with him went our last lead.

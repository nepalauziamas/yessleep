It is far too risky to post every day, I am too afraid they will find out what I am posting, and I will lose my job, or worse. I will keep a log of the days and post when I feel that it is safe, and I am not on-site.

The last two days have been unbearable, the stress fills the halls of NASA like a dense fog, and an overwhelming feeling of angst fills my bones. Security has started checking all of our bags now, and we have been required to leave all communication devices at the security office before entering the building. I noticed that IT has started monitoring our computers more closely, I am guessing in order to keep us from leaking any pictures to the press.

That is until last night when the JWST picked up an infrared light coming from the newly dubbed JWST-2, it was incredibly easy to miss, as it was on a specific wavelength only readable by JWST, almost as if it was meant to be seen by this specific infrared telescope.

After stitching together recordings taken using the telescope, we had determined that this light was blinking in a form of Morse code. I would almost call this impossible but nothing about the last 48 hours has been within our realm of possibilities. The code was short and did not have any words, just a jumble of numbers. I will not disclose the numbers because only a few of us know, and I will lose my job, and probably worse if anybody finds out I am posting here.

The jumble of numbers was found to be celestial coordinates, but they seemed to be incomplete, missing a single number at the end. Using this information, we have deciphered that they are pointing in the general direction of Orion’s belt, specifically the star Mintaka. The numbers also had a date, for a few days from now, we will be focusing Hubble on the star, praying we got the numbers right, I hope this is not what I think it is.

We found a space station! it is orbiting Earth-2, it does not look like it is in good condition, but we believed it could have very likely had some survivors on it, at this point, we assume this planet is an exact copy of ours, just several decades in advance.

After focusing on this station for some time, JWST was able to make out some details, it appears to be lit up, so it has power, it also seems to be an exact structural copy of the ISS, however, we cannot read the identification markings on it. It was not until the station was turned around, and we got another snapshot of it, that was it clear it would be impossible for anything to survive off of this station, there was a massive gash in its hull that appeared to be large enough to have emptied the station of all its oxygen.

We cannot determine if this happened pre, or post-destruction of Earth-2, there is no way to tell when it happened, or if it even had anything to do with whatever happened to that planet.

Earth-2 seemed to be totally void of life, as far as we could tell, even the knowledge that whatever happened here, took place thousands of years ago, proves to be of no help in raising spirits.

But maybe there is hope, maybe there could be someone who survived, like I said, looking through these telescopes is like looking through a time machine, maybe there were survivors, maybe we just missed them by a few years? I like to think that they knew of their impending doom, and were somehow able to get out away from it, however unlikely this hypothesis is, it is a nice thought.

I do not know what happened to Earth-2, or what is going to happen in Orion in around 4 days, but whatever this is, I did not think this is where my career would lead, or what would happen when we got JWST operational.

07/17/2022:

We lost all contact with JWST this morning, the astronauts in charge of operating it have not checked in, and we cannot find it on any scanners or any ground-based telescopes. In essence, we have lost a 10 Billion dollar piece of equipment over mere seconds.

The data logs have the telescope making a transmission at 6:57 AM this morning, but it disappeared from all radar at 6:59 AM, without a trace. My team has been going crazy trying to figure out what happened to JWST. Hubble has also been out of contact for some time now, but this is not abnormal for it, since the technology is old, and we have been experiencing irregular solar flare-ups recently, causing a lot of communication issues.

07/18/2022:

JWST is back! It came back god damn it! Apparently, there was a connection break between them and us; they had to move it into a different orbit due to some space junk. For a moment today, the air was lighter, but it only lasted a moment.

My team spent the morning today re-calibrating JWST to view Earth-2 from its new position, but what we found was worse than we ever expected. When we finally got Earth-2’s system into view, we only saw seven planets there, no Earth-2. All of the other planets were off, and in different orbits, not even its moon was there, we have no idea what happened.

After some serious examination, our best guess was that Earth-2’s orbit was thrown off so drastically by the loss of mass that it was hurdled into its sun and was destroyed. It is impossible to tell what happened because of the time warp with looking that deep into space, and the fact we could not record what happened due to the connection loss.

We have all been working double shifts, whatever is happening, we need to get to the bottom of this.

The day to focus on the coordinates is tomorrow. We are going to set up JWST and Hubble to search the general area around the coordinates starting tonight. I pray we can find what we are looking for.

I don't have much time as I fear they will find me but I need people to know this before I die.

I am on vacation visiting Florida with my good friend, Eric for 2 weeks. Today is the 8th day of our trip and we decided to finally visit Disney World, the place where dreams are made of and where I have been wanting to visit for years. The moment I walked through the gates I felt like something was off but I didn't know what, my friend Eric said I was just nervous for the rides and that was all so I put this bad feeling behind me and went into the theme park.

Some hours past and I had the bad feeling still so me and Eric went to go have lunch, when we got there we ordered our food and sat down, me and Eric  were surprised on how big the food was compared to what restaurants outside the theme park and supermarkets sell. As we began to eat I still had an off feeling about this whole park and for some reason the food tasted weird, good but weird, It's hard to explain but the fries, burger and pretzel i ordered all tasted the same and none of them tasted like an actual burger, pretzel or fries and they were all like supersized which gave me an off feeling still.


I went to mention the weird taste to Eric but as I did an amber alert happened, a 9 year old boy and his father went missing near Cinderellas Castle. Eric wanted to help look but I wanted to leave however I didn't want to leave Eric on his own as we came in the same car so I stayed with Eric. Hours and hours past and we were still helping to look and I figured we should leave now since the sun started to set but Eric refused as his brother went missing when he was a kid and he said he didn't help the search and his brother was found dead in a lake 2 days later and he always felt guilty for not helping and he said to me he can't help is brother now but he can help to try make sure a 9 year old boy and his father dosent have the same fate as his brother so we stayed.

A few minutes went by and we were searching in a quiet place the police hadn't searched yet, we were all alone but that's when we heard it, a terrifying scream that was like an echo. Eric rushed into the room it came from and I followed but when we got in the room we just saw a tunnel that went straight down for what looked like 50 feet and it had very bad lighting. I said to Eric we should get the police but he said no we have to go now incase someone was introuble and he began to decend down the ladder. I was very hesitant but I didn't want Eric going down there alone so I went with him, little did I know this would be the biggest mistake of my life.

When we got to the bottom we were in a room that smelt like rotting meat and there were bones everywhere, i had an extremely bad feeling but Eric said this is probably just an unfinished ride that hasn't been announced, I believed him which was another mistake as I should of trusted my gut feeling. We then heard the scream again so we ran to the direction it came from but it was very hard to navigate as this place is like a maze but eventually we found the room the screams came from.

We were cautious as we didn't know why there was screams so we slowly looked into the room and then we saw it, the 9 year old boy was being skinned alive by one of the mascots and the father of the boy was being chopped up into slices by a different mascot and he was dead. We watched in shock not knowing what to do but then we saw  2 other mascots, they were loading the meat from the dead father and the 9 year old boy who was being skinned down to the bone and was still alive and screaming and they loaded up the meat from them and put the human meat into 3 buckets and the buckets had writing on them but as we read what was on the buckets we realised a terrifying truth

We saw on one bucket the word "burger" on another "pretzel" and one the 3rd one "fries" and that's when we realised they make all their food with pieces of human meat and we guess the reason the food Is so big is to make you fatter for more meat.

At this point we ran to get out of there as we knew we couldn't save the child so we ran for what felt like forever but a mascot noticed us running and began to hunt us down. We were nearly at the exit to the this maze and all its rooms and we were going to get the police but then Eric fell and broke his leg while we were running and I stopped to help him but we both saw the mascot chasing us with a knife and he told me to go, I refused at first but then he said I would die too and told me to go so with tears in my eyes knowing I would never see my bestfriend of 9 years ever again I ran and 20 seconds later I heard his scream echo behind me knowing that the mascot had got to him.

I got to the ladder to escape this awful place and I hoped to get help but as i began to climb the ladder I looked up and saw another mascot coming down the ladder so I rushed back down and ran into another area and at the same time i heard the echos of more mascots running down the tunnels.

I found a room in this maze of tunnels to hide in and as of now they haven't found me yet but I hear them getting closer and closer as I type this.

To anyone visiting Disney World don't eat the food and don't ever go alone, I  hope I don't have the same fate as my friend.

Disney is where nightmares are made of.

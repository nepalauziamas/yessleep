Hey, me again. The rules have been working pretty well, but some things have been happening. I did some more research on the new hire, but nothing came up. He doesn’t talk much, but he’s a good worker. 

It was a normal day, I was heading to the café to grab food, but then I saw something. It was a door, I was 90% sure it hadn’t been there. I opened it, and it was a staircase down. I went down, but the door slammed behind me.

I decided to keep moving, and saw something strange. A rock wall. I looked to the left and saw a doorway. I followed it. I kept moving, and saw a giant room. I looked around, and saw a bloodstain on a pedestal. I looked on the pedestal, and saw a weird altar.

There was a crude painting of eyes, and a strange spot. It looked like an average persons outline, but was on the floor like a murder scene. I saw a name in the center.

“Marcus Whetts.”

I knew that this was probably some weird cult, and I tried to get to the door. I didn’t know what to do when the door wasn’t there. I looked around, and started panicking. I felt like I was being watched, but more than I normally was.

I was panicking at this point. I started looking for an alternate exit, then I saw it. There was a strange guy, crouched on the floor. It turned around. It had a mouth with what seemed like millions of fangs, and yellow eyes. I looked into those yellow eyes. I started panicking. The eyes looked identical to the new hires. I was terrified. 

It lunged at me. I ran away. It was gaining on me, but I had an idea. I ran to the wall where the door was, and stopped. That thing rushed at me, but I sprinted beside it at the last second. It ran into the wall, and the wall shattered. There was a doorframe. I jumped over the thing, which was recovering from running full speed into a wall.

I decided to keep sprinting, even when the stairs didn’t appear. I was running. I found another large room. I walked around, not hearing the thing behind me. I heard someone behind me.

I turned around, and was terrified. It was my assistant. He kept twitching violently, but he looked fine otherwise. He started talking.

“Hey, how are you?”

“How did you even- what?”

“I know where the exit is. Just take my hand.”

I decided to take his hand, until his hand rippled. It looked like the skin was waves at a beach. I stepped back.

“Where are you going, Laith? Running away? So close. I was so close.”

My assistant smiled too much for a human, and he kept smiling wider and wider until he made a perfect circle around his head. He turned into the same creature that was chasing me. It disappeared. I kept walking around, hiding whenever I heard footsteps.

I heard someone calling out for me. It sounded like the new hire. It came from a spot on the wall that looked off. I didn’t feel like going there, because he had yellow eyes. It was likely a trap. I kept looking for an exit, but I couldn’t find one. It was around an hour until I found a water bottle. I decided to pick it up. It was completely full.

I took a swig, and regretted it. I lost all control of my body. I started smiling, as much as I could, but my body kept going. I could move everything but my legs and head. It was then I let out the most earsplitting screech I had ever heard. I knew I was doomed when I heard footsteps. I covered my mouth. I grabbed my mouth and closed it forcibly. 

I couldn’t smile If I closed my mouth. I kept moving through the strange place, but then I heard something. It was a humanoid figure, it had no eyes or nose. It was a big, bulking thing with super long hands. I almost gasped when I realized I recognized those hands. 

That thing was the thing dragging people through computers and walls. I got mad. I’d seen that thing drag so many people away. I’d seen it tearing through lives like paper. I realized I could get past it if I never made a sound. Its ears seemed pretty big.

I do NOT want to remember what that thing sounded like. It heard me, and it let out an earsplitting screech. It sounded like nails on a chalkboard but louder, combined with the screams of a thousand people dying. It RUSHED at me. 

I ran as fast as I could. I didn’t know what I could do. I heard the new hires voice coming from a wall. I decided to take my chances. If the new guy wouldn’t kill me, that thing certainly would. I ran. I just kept running.

I ran into the wall, and burst out of the door. I looked behind me, and it was a closet. The hand of that thing started reaching out of the wall. The new hire didn’t care. He pulled me back, and opened the door widely. He smiled at me with a terrifying grin.

The things arm started reaching for me. I kicked back, and it grabbed my foot. The new hire looked me in the eyes, and SLAMMED the door shut with inhuman strength. The hand went limp, and the screech came from the door. I realized why as I pulled the hand off me easily.

He had cut the things hand off using a door.

“WHAT.” I said.

“I owe you an explanation.” He replied.

Yes. Yes he did.

“I suppose you’re wondering about my eyes.” He said.

“Yes.”

“When I was a little kid, I got into a horrible accident. My eyes were severely injured, and since we had old doctors, we had to cut them out. My parents, refusing to let me suffer like that, decided to do something big. They made a sacrifice, testing it on people. They turned into those creatures you see in the basement. One even grew more eyes, then lost them. They did something right, and did the same thing with me. My eyes were returned, but I saw strange things. I saw the things in the basement, and the spirits of the sacrificed, everywhere. The place was buried in an avalanche. The sacrifice also gave me an increased lifespan. I was born in 1439.”

“What.” I couldn’t believe it. I didn’t believe it. To ignore it, I decided to make more rules.

Rule 6: If you see a strange door, DO NOT ENTER under ANY circumstances.

Rule 7a: Should you enter, avoid them.

Rule 7b: Do not accept any deals in the basement.

Rule 7c: If you get chased by a thing with no eyes, find a strange part of wall. Dive through it. The wall is the only way to escape, no matter what.

Rule 7d: If something else chases you, convince it to run into the wall. It will try to recover.

I looked up my business, “Laiths insurance co.” On google after someone told me to for fun, but I couldn’t find it. I did everything I could, but couldn’t. I don’t think they want people knowing about the building, so we’re a local business in (Deleted) city.

We got a new guy before the guy with yellow eyes, and I’m using his reddit account. 

I have a feeling great things are coming from him.

I think I died today?

"Top right drawer is your handbook. Read it carefully. I'll send someone for you to shadow, just wait here hun," Jo ordered, disappearing into the cubicle labyrinth before I had the chance to speak.

The handbook I read was interesting, to say the least. Aside from the standard clothing codes, antidiscrimination policies, and the sort, odd rules were sprinkled in.

For example, under no circumstance could I agree with a witness. The printer and copier could never be 'fed magenta' and the shredder needed to be asked before used, then thanked afterwards. The fridge should never be touched.

These very strange, very specific rules littered the otherwise unremarkable pamphlet. Since this was my first job out of school, I didn't want to screw myself over by ignoring a single detail. As bizarre as the rules were, I decided to commit to them. Worst case scenario, I make a fool of myself. I'd rather be gullible than ignore the rules.

"Let's get a move on. Name's Pauly, nice to meet ya." A soft voice startled me, causing me to jump a little.

"J-Josh!" I spat, recomposing myself, then offered a hand.

Pauly shook mine with an unexpectedly firm grip. Without another word, we rode the elevator to the ground floor. "Say nothing. Write nothing. Just follow my lead." Pauly instructed. Pauly spoke with such conviction that I struggled to doubt them being anything other than serious. Pauly meant those words.

Pauly drove us to the interview site, not saying a word the whole time. We pulled into a gravel driveway, just outside of the only house for nearly ten miles. The rundown building may have one point been a majestic mansion, however all that remained was an overgrown yard, filthy windows, moss covered walls, and a collapsed garage.

"Is this the place?" I asked, incredulously. "How can anyone live like that?!"

"Shut it!" Pauly hissed. "You're lucky this one is on the tamer side of things. Keep your mouth closed and follow my lead. I won't keep reminding you." Pauly grit their teeth, glaring into my eyes. With a huff, they stormed out of the vehicle, and strolled to the front door.

I trailed behind, nearly tripping on the uneven path. I caught myself just as Pauly used the ornate knocker. Metal hit metal with a reverberating CLANG! At least three dogs began incessantly hounding the door.

Pauly slightly turned to face me, just enough so I could watch them mouth out 'there are no dogs.'

My brow furrowed as my doubts grew. This was becoming more and more difficult to believe. Between the insane rules and ridiculous behaviors I'd encountered so far, this had to be a prank. Even so, I played along.

The heavy door swung open in a flash, revealing a wildly disproportionate figure within. The unusual frame croaked out "aren't they just lovely?" The figure made no attempts to identify what the 'they' was, though that did not stop Pauly.

"They are terrible" Pauly countered, softly sighing. "Where are they." Pauly stated, even though it should have been a question.

The figure swayed, twitching occasionally. "They are 398.4 meters south, 832.7 meters east." A red, slimy tendril licked at the door frame, slithering back into the house before the figure asked its next question. "That one should live?"

A thin coil shot out, quickly constricting me around my waist. I choked out in shock as the air was forced from my lungs. My arms reflexively grasped at the slick, eel like tentacle strangling the life out of me.

On the verge of collapse, I barely made out Pauly's words. "No. They should not."

In a moment of desperation, I begged for my life. "No! I should live!" I heard it before I felt it.

Have you ever heard a watermelon splatter after falling? Imagine that, accompanied by juicy meat tearing. Now you have an idea of just what I heard as my torso was separated from my waist.

Like a crushed soda can, my lower half crumpled to the ground. My upper half would have followed suit, had Pauly not caught me.

Though drowning in shock, I could still make out Pauly's words, through the bog of blood loss and excruciating pain. "You'll be okay, it'll be okay." Pauly tried to comfort me, dropping me like a sack of garbage. "You're a dumbass. Hopefully now you've learned your lesson."

The world faded out, a mercy as I no longer felt the agony of being in two halves. I embraced the cold nothingness, as I ceased to exist.

Then I woke up.

"Welcome back, Josh." Pauly said smugly.

"Wha-where how huh?" I stammered, feeling for a pair of legs that were somehow intact. I felt around, finding nothing unusual. My organs were inside of me, my clothing was as wrinkled as it had been that morning. Not even a bruise, nor speck of blood.

"You undoubtedly have hundreds of questions, but I've only got a handful of answers. First, follow the damn rules. Second, whatever happens to employees, is undone at the end of our shift. Third, break too many rules, and things will start to stick. Fourth, you do not have a choice but to work, no use running. You will show up tomorrow, and you will show up the day after that. Fifth, questions are better left unanswered." Pauly unloaded on me, mostly on deaf ears. I was not in a stable state of mind.

I sprinted to my car and sped home. And here I am. My first day at PixiePages and I was torn in half. Yet somehow, I am alive.

I can't find anything online about PixiePages Inc. Google maps doesn't show a valid address when I type it in either. I used Google maps this morning to find my way there. How the hell does it suddenly not exist?

I am certain I died today. I don't want to return tomorrow. Please save me. Someone, anyone. 911 won't go through, and I can't bring myself to talk to my family. Whenever I try, bullshit about 'what a great day I had' spews from my mouth.

I don't know what I've gotten myself into, but I'll keep you updated. Wish me luck, I've got to reread those insane rules.

for context:

I've always lived in cheap, poorly built houses; but last year we moved.

it was the newest house, my boyfriend, my two cats and I have ever lived in together. it was nice, this one had a sturdy lock on the front door, all the cabinets still attached, and a working heater!! our first place that felt like it could be an actual home.

we had all of our furniture in place by the next week, and we began to settle in. a few months went by before I noticed something a little odd, every week there seemed to be new cobwebs around the house. my boyfriend is an arachnophobe so try to keep our place cobweb free. Despite my diligent cleaning, it was never this bad at our old place. a bit strange but nothing too peculiar. more time goes by, we've lived there for about 8 months now and in our bedroom, something weird is happening there's been holes appearing in our walls. we don't use tacks or nails to hold our decor up because it goes against our lease. so it was bizarre that what look like nail holes have been popping up all over our room. so far there are around 6 that I've counted. and my boyfriend has noticed a few around the rest of the house. could we have just not noticed until now?

this has to have been my boyfriend pranking me. it's only been around 2 weeks since I noticed the holes in my walls, and by now they've multiplied. what used to be 6 in my bedroom and a few around the house but now it's about 60 total. I don't know how he could be making these holes without hammering, but it's the only thing I can think could be causing them. Is he pranking me???

I feel like I'm going crazy, more holes just keep appearing.  and when I asked my boyfriend about it he denied knowing anything and accused me of being the cause!!?  I got mad and stormed off for a bit. am I overreacting??

a week later my boyfriend had to leave for a business trip which wasn't uncommon but it was his first one since we moved here, I thought finally I could get a break from these goddamn holes.

but I was mistaken. holes continued to appear even though he was gone... I was dumbfounded. and I decided to cover up the most noticeable of them with tapestries. how could there still be more????  I felt awful, it definitely wasn't my boyfriend and I had accused him. I had really just wanted answers.

My boyfriend got back today, and I apologized for accusing him and told him that more appeared even though he wasn't here, then when I lifted the tapestry to show him, somehow there were even more than last time!

my boyfriend is convinced that it has been me making the holes and that I'm acting delusional! he said that if it doesn't stop he's going to consider getting me professional help, I am very worried now.

later that night I couldn't sleep thoughts about how I might finally be going crazy were racing around my head. all of my anxiety twisting into that familiar knot in my stomach. in the early hours of the morning, I began to drift off. I felt a small tickle on my face, and assuming it to be a hair I went to brush it away. as my hand grazed it lightly I felt a rush of dread  IT. WAS. A. SPIDER. I jolted awake desperately trying to get the wretched thing off of my face. waking my sleeping boyfriend in the process. he quickly turned on our bedside lamp.

he screamed.

I looked at him finally having properly flung the spider off. to my horror all over the walls where all of the holes had been. spiders. tens of thousands crawling out of the holes in our walls. tunneling out and spilling onto the floor.  we grabbed our cats and ran out into the hall. there were somehow even more out here, completely covering the walls and ceiling. quickly the rest of the floor beneath us disappeared as we ran out into the kitchen, we felt the sickening crunch of spiders beneath our bare feet. as we attempted to make a hasty exit. we were both bitten several times. and holding a squirming cat each was proving to be difficult. as we ran from the kitchen my boyfriend bumped into the oven by accident, covering the side of him with spiders. he lost the very little amount of cool he had left and started crying. and we bolted outside.

I've booked us a motel for the night, and I never liked the idea of motels I thought they were dirty and covered in pests, however, I'm no longer afraid of such bugs. i'll call the extermenator in the morning, for now i'll try to get some sleep.

I’m a junior at Ringgold High School. Growing up is really hard in this small town since boys my age here are more concerned about cars and girls, as for me, well I was more concerned about my next game of Dungeons and Dragons. I only had three friends, Mike, Jerry and Chucky. We all spent most of the time hanging out at each other’s houses, playing D and D, and getting picked on the majority of our time at school. Bullying was inevitable for us since well we were nerds and getting a girl for us would be impossible since nobody really wanted a nerd as a boyfriend who geeks out about being the Dungeon Master. 

Despite being picked on we all lived normal lives everyone except Chucky. Chuckys parents died when he was about 5 years old and he lives with his grandmother who spends most of the time sleeping on the couch, she did make some great bratwurst tho, those were always delicious. Chucky pretty much takes care of himself. One thing Chucky hated was when the kids at school would pick on him, he would spend the rest of the day mad and would complain that they ruined it. He was not one to easily let go of a grudge, he had a lot of anger inside him begging to come out from all the shit he would receive at school. I felt bad for him because I knew he didn’t have it easy. He was also very poor and could barely afford to where they live at. The worse part is when they would tease him about not having parents, people have no limits these days. 

It all started when it was our usual session of Dungeons and Dragons on Friday night. We met at Jerry’s place and Mike brought pizza from Dominoes and Jerry managed to grab some beers from his dad stack he had to secretly drink away in our Big Gulps, the only problem was Chucky didn’t show up. We called him but he wouldn’t answer. I remembered that earlier that day he had mentioned that Stephen wouldn’t leave him alone. He said he pushed him in the boys bathroom and proceeded to taunt him all day. It’s understandable since Chucky was probably too upset to show up. We all got curious and wanted to make sure he was ok so we called his grandmother and mentioned he was fine that he just had a bad day. That was only one of first times he wouldn’t show up to our D&D sessions but I must admit this bullying shit was getting out of hand. 

We didn’t hear from Chucky all weekend until Monday morning at school. He looked like he was in a better mood, even had a smile on. 

“How was everyone’s weekend? Sorry I missed out on Friday’s session”, he said. 

It was nice seeing him happy for once, he looked born again as if he went on vacation that weekend and enjoyed the fuck out of it. 

“Well you missed a great night of beers and pizza, how about this Friday you make for it by showing up?” I said. 

“I’ll have to see what’s on the table for Friday but more than likely yea”.

That seemed odd, what else could he be possibly doing that doesn’t involve hanging out with his best friends playing the best game in the world with some alcohol and pizza. 

Later in our first period class our teacher made an announcement that one of students had gone missing this weekend and it was Stephen Murray. 

Holy shit, my mind right away turned towards Chucky. I knew he was having problems with him but Chucky is not the type unless his rage finally decided to do something about it. 

“If anyone has any information you reach out to me or one of our staff members”, the teacher declared. 

This all really did seem odd and more so that Chucky hasn’t really seemed all that happy all his life, I don’t think I’ve ever seen him smile till the Monday I saw him.  What made my doubts become more worrisome was that Chucky didn’t show up to our D&D session that Friday again. Stephen had still not been found. That Monday again, another student went missing, Peter Landon, another one of Chucky’s bullies. All the while Chucky could give a care in the world. It’s hard not to think that Chucky was not involved in this but everything for me pointed that he was. He was even becoming more distant and stopped going to our sessions all together. I needed to know how Chucky was spending his weekends.

That Friday I confronted Jerry and Mike about it, we all agreed to spy on Chucky that night to see his where abouts. We started at his house, I forgot to mention that Chucky lives almost close out of town, close to the neck of the woods, but he wasn’t there at home so we decided to go into the woods. Now this was really scary since it was already dark and quite honestly I don’t know made us decide it we would be a good idea to into the woods at night. 

All three of us sticked together and we used the flashlight from our phones to try and find Chucky. We all yelled out his name but no answer. We decided just to leave until Mike noticed something 

“Is that a well?”

We all looked confused since we’ve been out here a couple of times and we never saw a well in the woods before. Then I heard  a voice it was Chuckys, he was walking with his grandma. 

“I can’t wait to start grinding that meat already, he should be good for the following week”, I heard the grandmother say. 

“How do you convince them to come over here Chucky?”

“I just tell them I want to fight them and those loser bullies never turn down a fight”

“Well nobody messes with my grandson, it all works out in the end. I help you rid of that bullying problem and I get to make my famous bratwursts again”

Chucky and his grandma were carrying a black bag and they both walk their way to the well. They empty out the remains of the black bag inside the well.

“I can’t make food out of teenager skulls, what better way to hide them”. 

We were all stunned with the revelation. Mike wanted to leave and we all decided it was the best thing to do. We quietly left the woods and headed back home. We didn’t know if should call the cops and turn in our friend. 

It was 11pm already when I got a call from Chucky who sounded very excited. 

“Hey are you all still up for playing D & D tonight? I’m bringing over my grandmas famous bratwursts, I know we all love eating those things like crack.”

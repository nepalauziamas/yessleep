This is a collection of scary and weird stuff that has happened in my house.

**Falling toys-**

The earliest thing I can remember that really freaked me out about my house was the reoccurring experience of soft toys that I had put away on top of my wardrobe, suddenly falling to the floor. I would notice that a toy that had definitely been on top of my wardrobe before I went to bed, would be on the floor when I woke up the next morning. Being a very young kid, it did freak me out, but I didn’t really understand ghosts or anything so I just kinda laughed it off, thinking it was the wind or poor placement of the toys. But as this became more common, I became more unsettled, I remember once when I heard a soft thud, I turned to see a toy hedgehog now on the floor. I was fed up at this point, and so I picked up the toy and said to the empty air, 

“If that was you, do it again!” Nothing happened so I brushed it off and tried to go on. I told my younger sister about what had been happening and we both laughed about it, I had asked if she had had any similar experiences but she said no. The last time I can remember a toy falling from my wardrobe was the worst of all; my sister had a friend over for a sleepover and she had told her friend about the weird experiences, her friend had asked to see it so they came to my room. All three of us stood near the doorway and I noticed the hedgehog on the floor again, I called out once again to the empty air, “if there is someone here, knock a toy off of the wardrobe!” We all waited in silence until suddenly there was a soft thud and a toy had fallen, I don’t remember much of what I was thinking, all I remember was hearing someone scream and running out of my room.

A toy hasn’t fallen off of the wardrobe since.

**Sounds in the night-**

The next thing I remember happening in my house was a collection of small unsettling things that happened in the middle of the night. I have always had trouble sleeping so it was not uncommon for me to be awake long into the night when everyone else was asleep, it was during these unsettled nights that I would hear and experience a lot of things I couldn’t explain. The most common thing I remember happening was various creaks and sounds of people moving around, it wasn’t unusual for my floorboards to creak, but they would only creak when people were walking around. But every time I would check to see if anyone was up and moving, they’d all still be fast asleep, and my sister’s door would still be closed. 

There were also many occurrences of my hearing the sounds of scratching at my door if it was closed, this wasn’t something that worried me as we had always owned cats, so I would just go and open the door to let them in, however on multiple occasions I opened the door to an empty corridor with no cats even upstairs. That never sat right with me.

The most disturbing and unexplainable thing that happened in the night was something I’ll never forget. It had been a completely normal night; I had fallen asleep moderately easily but a few hours later I woke back up and couldn’t get back to sleep. I was frustrated, but so young that I didn’t have a phone to keep me entertained, so I was sat doing nothing until I could fall back asleep, however before I could even get tired, a loud crash sounded through my room. I looked up frantically to see a small yellow ball bouncing on my floor like it had just been thrown into my room, I was terrified. I picked up the ball and ran into the corridor expecting to see maybe my sister or my mum, but the house was silent, my parents were fast asleep and my sister’s door was closed. (For context my sister always closes her door at night and we always know when her door opens because her door has always been unbearably loud when opening, it creaks and floods the entire house with noise, so I knew immediately that she had not left her room that night.)

**Moving doors-**

Another common occurrence in my house, that still happens to this day, is doors opening and closing without any wind or human influence. The most notable instance of this was one day where I was washing my hands and suddenly the bathroom door swung closed, I looked up in panic and watched as the door began to swing open and closed. I shouted out to see if anyone was on the landing but my family were all downstairs, I cautiously turned around and called out for whatever was there to prove itself by closing the door, after a few seconds pause the door slammed shut and I screamed, quickly opening the door and running out of the bathroom. Once I had calmed down, I went back to the bathroom, thinking it might have been the wind, but to my horror the window was closed tight.

**Ouija board sessions-**

For Christmas one year I asked for a Ouija board (I was a weird kid), I used the board a few times with family in locations other than my own house, I had never been confident enough to use it in my home. Knowing the already concerning experiences I had had over the years; I was too scared to risk communicating with whatever may be living in the house. But one night I decided that I felt brave enough to use the board in my house.

It was around 2am, I had got the board out ready and opened it, using the safest methods I knew. I sat with my fingers resting on the planchette for a few minutes, I was too scared to ask anything, it felt like all of my courage from moments ago had vanished into thin air. I sat in tense silence for a few minutes before finally asking a question,

“Is anyone there who would like to communicate?” I asked quietly, not wanting to wake the others in my house, almost instantaneously the planchette slid across the board. I felt a shiver run down my spine, I hadn’t expected a response, especially not one this quickly. I tried to quell my building panic as the planchette flew across the board and sat firmly on ‘YES’. I sucked in a sharp breath and tried to think of what to ask next, “what’s your name?” I asked, more cautiously, no response, “uh- how old are you?” still nothing. I asked a few more questions, still to no avail, I had got one explicit response and then nothing more, not even a shift, the planchette sat completely motionless on ‘YES’. 

Feeling defeated I shut down the board, however I couldn’t leave it just like that, I had an uneasy feeling brewing in my stomach. I sat and contemplated what to do for a while before deciding to reopen the board and try again. I repeated the opening process and got ready to ask the questions again, this time with more determination,

“Is anyone there who would like to communicate?” I asked, once again, the planchette flew to yes, this time with more force, I had to swallow back a yelp at the action. I repeated the same questions from the previous session and still I received no response apart from the first response, my blood ran cold. I felt as if there was a looming presence in the room, watching my every room, but I couldn’t see anyone. I closed the board frantically and hid it behind my bed, the feeling of pure terror didn’t leave, I didn’t fall asleep that night.

I have never used that board in my room since, sometimes when I see it in the corner of my eye, I can still feel that terrifying presence looming over my shoulder.

I have not had any extreme experiences in a while now, and whenever I’ve spoken to my family about it, they have laughed and said I was imagining things, but I can’t help but worry about what is living in this house, and why is it only coming for me?

It is around 9:00 PM just got out of my boring office job.

I'm hungry as I really haven't eaten much because i forgot my lunch.

I walked into my office's parking lot to my car. I start it.

and start driving.

I realized that I should eat something as I'm driving down the road i look to the left seeing a Restaurant. A boring local fast food. As  I looked around for any other places to eat I drive into the parking lot.

I Walked up to the restaurant counter, and looking at the menu.

"I Will take one burger."

"Coming right up." said the dude looking just as tired as me. I put down the money After he gave me the burger, as I going to my car to eat the burger I looked at The burger It looked weird but I was hungry  so I ate it.

Sitting in my car i see some dude in a hoodie walk into the bathroom didn't think much of it.

A few minutes later Satisfied after eating that burger i had to use the restroom The dude hasn't left yet even though its been roughly 11 minutes.  i shook it off Walking to the bathroom

I go to the door going into the bathroom I walked across the stalls seeing the dude well doing his business so i go into the stall next to him He opens the door of the stall and walked out And he was gone.

"Holy shit!"

his  phone and clothing just dropped With a thud.. Nobody in sight. its like he just disappeared and just, Left everything behind i get out of the stall looking around.

I opened the bathroom door walking to my car a little on edge, I continue driving home to my apartment Walking to my 5th story apartment, I climbed up the stairs unlocking the door and fall asleep thinking about where did the dude go! I mean he just walked out of his stall and disappeared there was no way he couldn't have gotten out.

I get up and hear a knock on my door, my neighbor Alex.

He says  "Have you seen Johan?"

"No why?"

"She has just gone inside her room and she hasn't come out in a few days it's worrying me."

"Look ill check up on her after work"

I drove to my office going to my cubicle.

A co-worker that I'm just gonna say name is josh came up to me

"Do you know where Ray is?"

"No."

"Well somebody needed to give him his lunch pale before he left as he turned the corner and as the friend turns the corner hes gone. only his clothing."

"Holy shit I'm scared."

"Why?"

"This has happened to me."

"So i went to a bathroom after eating fast food at this restaurant there was  a dude in the stall beside me he finished His business and well he walked out and disappeared."

"Wow.."

"I'm gonna need to go home."

I go out driving home disturbed even more. I walked to  my car and sped to my apartment to check on Johna the door is unlocked i opened it seeing her clothing and nothing else.

It looked like there was a fight. i looked around to see how Johna could have escaped

nothing. i thought as well she disappeared too, i opened my apartment and shut the door freaking out.

I decided to drink it off.

I sat on the couch tired going to my room.

"Whats that noise?"

I looked  to feel my shoulder being touched and yanked.

They stood around waiting anxiously for Mark to get there. 

Peter asked Tabitha what it felt like being transported. 

She scrunched up her face and said, "Well, I didn't know exactly what the hell that thing was, it just showed up on my map one day and every time I went to check it out something new appeared, so I kept going back. Everything was genetically different in miniscule ways, and one day I went in after there was nothing in it for once, and next thing I knew the door shut and everything went black. I have no idea if a minute passed or an hour but when the door opened, Mark and Jane were standing there looking like I was a ghost or something. 

Then they told me that I was on Terra Firma, and that Earth survives Y2K but they have reason to believe TF won't. That's why I had to stay. You guys have some really weird names for stuff, by the way." 

Peter and Lynn looked at each other and busted out laughing right when Mark walked in. 

He clapped his hands and said it was almost time. 

The tension mixed with excitement in the air was palpable as Jane hit another switch and the machine got louder and she gave Mark a thumbs up. 

"Alright, counting down now, go on 1! 5, 4, 3, 2, 1!" 

She hit one last switch and there was a slight flash and the black box inside the glass one disappeared. 

They all looked on in wonder while Peter started shuffling back and forth. They had about 2 minutes until the hour mark. 

The door automatically closed and it returned when it sensed weight of more than 20 pounds in it, so all they had to do was wait, Mark explained. 

It felt like torture until Jane finally said they got a reading that the door had closed. She seemed confused though, and said the weight seemed off. None one said anything as they felt some odd electricity in the air, and the black box returned. Apparently the glass box around it helped negate any atmospheric changes that might exist as they exited. 

They held their breaths as the door slowly started to move up, and saw four legs and some bags on the ground. It finally got completely open and they saw not one but two men standing there. 

"Oh what the hell?!" Mark cried out. 

One of the men had dyed blue hair and the other brownish red. The one with the blue hair gave a sheepish wave.
Peter hedged his bets that that was Troy. 

They stepped into the glass box and Mark went over to open the door.
"Why didn't you tell us there were two of you?! That could have been so dangerous, I'm surprised you both have your limbs in tact!!!" 

The man with the blue hair said, "I'm sorry dude, I'm Troy, this is my boyfriend Oliver, he goes by Oli." 

Oli was the one waving this time.
"We were afraid you wouldn't let me come if we told you." 

"Damn straight", Mark sighed. Too late now. 
"Well, do you boys feel alright? Do you need to sit down or anything?" 

They said they felt fine and Troy went up to Peter and asked if it was him. When Peter smiled and nodded Troy gave him a big hug.
"Sorry I didn't believe you, man! I can be a jerk sometimes!" 

Peter laughed and said it was okay, he wouldn't have believed him at first if the roles had been switched. 

A man in a white coat came in and told them to sit down in chairs by the machine to make sure their health stats were good. 

The rest of the group was quiet, processing what just happened. They all were hitting a wall after all that adrenaline and it being late. The men were cleared and Lynn suggested going to the cafeteria, they hadn't eaten in a while, and Troy and Eli said they could eat. 

Mark and Jane led everyone to the cafeteria and said they'd be on their way to talk to the researchers and send them with Nara to join the new group as soon as possible and hurried off. 
No instructions for food and Peter just realized how hungry he was. Tabitha half yelled, "Over here!" where she held open a door and a normal looking kitchen was in sight. 

They all went over and began opening cupboards. They found cans of soup, beans, tuna,Â  bags of chips, a large amount of frozen meat, along with large quantities of vegetables, and other odds and ends meant to season food or small snacks. 

Everyone grabbed something, mostly snacks but Eli said he needed some soup so was heating that up. After they all ate something and the room was getting louder with the scientists talking, he stood up to get Nara some air to do her business. At the door to the balcony he felt a hand on his shoulder. It was Troy and he asked to join him.
Peter said yes even though he was looking for a breather to recharge, meeting so many new people and the situation was making him anxious, but he also wanted to spend time with Troy, so he didn't mind. 

As they walked around looking at the night sky while helicopters blew by, Peter asked why his boyfriend came when it was so dangerous. 

"He watched Armageddon too many times" he said with a tight smile.
Peter knew of Alegmageddon and he knew what he was saying. 

"And he has had cancer for two years and we just learned that it's terminal, so there was no risk, really. Even if it messes with him like the girl with her legs, he wanted to do this. We talked and fought about it, I initially said no." 

"I'm sorry", Peter said. He usually stayed at arms length from people emotionally, so he didn't know what to say. 

Troy seemed to pick up on it and thankfully seemed to move past him not being comforting without calling it out and said, "The doctor said he seems perfectly fine". 

"That's really good", he said with relief. 
He was still in shock that it was really Troy, from another whole ass planet, standing in front of him. 

He saw movement of Nara walking up to Troy as the balcony door opened and Tabitha told them that Mark had an announcement to make and to come inside.

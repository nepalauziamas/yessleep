I had to figure it out. At first, it was amusing to watch, then it became puzzling, and then aggravating. Every day I’d watch my co-worker take a sip from his coffee mug—the same ivory, obviously hand-crafted coffee mug. He’d take a sizable sip, grimace for at least three to four seconds, and then take *another sip* after his face had relaxed. He’d repeat this behavior two or three times, then set the mug down and resume his work. Later, perhaps an hour or two, he’d conduct the little ritual again; the intensity of the grimacing never intensifying, but not waning, either.  

Like anyone else, my initial thought was the he had simply added a hefty dose of alcohol to the cup, and was grimacing at the strength of the booze, or the overall taste of the concoction. And, like someone who knows how to mind their own business, I never asked him; never confronted this person who might genuinely need a little *extra* in his cup to get through the mind-breaking mundanity of our job. But, I’m still a curious person, and couldn’t simply let this assumption ride completely uncomfirmed; especially not since he’d do this every. Single. Day. I’ve never personally known an alcoholic, but his productivity and the quality of his work were not reflective of someone who was always on the edge of a buzz, clinging less and less to sobriety. No offense to alcoholics – I'm sure there are some efficient, perfectly functional ones.  

Subtly—or so I hoped—I started to walk by his desk right after he’d take a sip, but never once did I smell even the faintest scent of booze. Coffee, sure; and something stale and slightly acrid, like burnt sweetener—but never the distinctly pungent scent of alcohol. As far as I was concerned, the man was clean. Something else about the coffee was making him physically wince and go misty-eyed with every sip, and I was determined to find out what.  

There is no coffee maker at our office. The company could easily afford to give us each our own (our manager has a very flashy, assuredly expensive one in his office) but they’ve never supplied the employees with one in our breakroom. And while I can’t speak for everyone, I’ve decided to never shell out the twenty or so bucks to buy a cheap coffeemaker to save everyone the trouble; because I know that’s EXACTLY what the company wants us to do – and I’m too much of a spiteful, petty person to let them win this virtually non-existent squabble. So, I make my coffee at home. The point behind all this is that one day, I thought of a plan to find out once and for all what the hell was in my coworker’s cringe-inducing coffee.  

Leaving my coffee mug in the car—after having gulped down the throat-searing brew, of course—I came into work and said aloud, very close to him, “Dammit, I forgot my coffee.” He had just been in the process of taking a sip from his mug, presumably the first of the day. My little practiced outburst stopped him, and before his lips could touch the cup I followed my little performance up with, “Would you mind if I had a tiny sip of yours? Just to start the day?” I motioned toward the water cooler, on which sat little plastic cups; showing that I wouldn’t even have to infringe upon the surface area of his cup with my stranger lips.  

He stared at me for a moment, inscrutably and silently, and then looked to his cup—intently; as if staring into a depth far greater than that of the 16oz container. Finally, after what had to have been six seconds of weird, uncomfortable silence—he nodded, almost solemnly; as a priest might upon pondering the legitimacy of a frequent sinner’s claim of contrition. Barely containing my morbid excitement, I went and retrieved one of the plastic cups and set it before him. As if pouring a sacramental drop—to further the catholic analogy—there was a genuine air of reverence in how he gently tipped his mug toward the cup to let the black, steaming liquid stream out. Once done, he returned the lid to his mug and slid the plastic cup back to me. I took it, thanked him profusely and sincerely (my curiosity had reached its boiling point) and returned to my desk.  

I didn’t look back at him upon arriving, but I knew that he was watching me. As casually as I could manage—given my palpable excitement—I brought the cup to my lips and took a small sip.  

The experience was unlike anything I could’ve ever imagined, and upon regaining my composure I found myself shocked, profoundly amazed, at how my coworker had so routinely imbibed the liquid, with only a grimace or shudder afterwards.  

The base, fundamental element was coffee, yes. A dark roast, without sugar or cream, brewed strongly. But the drink’s overall potency, its primary affect, was owed not to the caffeine—but to the *other* element, the thing with which the drink had been spiked. I was not immediately made aware of this singular ingredient, and at the moment could only guess—with hilarious inaccuracy—at its nature; but I knew, before being told later, that it wasn’t something you’d find in any store; and neither was it procurable through any legal means or channels. And as my coworker had done so many times before, I recoiled from it, as if I had instead sipped boiled poison. Its basic taste not necessarily acrid, but more-so slimy and ill-textured; offensive to the palate in multiple ways, none of which I can sufficiently describe.  

But what I can describe, what I can (strangely) give a clear account of, is the resultant feeling, the physical discomfort and mental disclarity of its consumption. The immediate sensation elicited was one of mental displacement. Swallowing the substance brought an abrupt shift in my sense of equilibrium, not dissimilar to missing a step when descending a staircase. That brief, panic-inducing sense of weightlessness, wherein you feel as if you’ve been betrayed by either the architecture of the building or gravity itself. Following on the heels of this was a mounting sense of dread, seemingly source-less, though nonetheless powerful and nerve-firing. I felt the ominous, cataclysm-auguring approach of *something*; the imminent arrival of a Thing or Entity whose sole and dark-hearted purpose was the end of all terrestrial life. And not just on Earth, but on every biologically inhabited sphere in the cosmos.  

This dread and cosmic anxiety soon gave way to a pitch-black, soul-dampening despair, as I became assured that nothing, no power on Earth would be able to stop the arrival of this ultramundane presence. In a deeply worrying cardiac event, my heart-rate climaxed and then reversed to a glacial, murmurous slowness; I suddenly felt wrapped up in an invisible, languor-inducing web—to await the predatory encroachment of its unhuman weaver. My mind was then filled with visions, fleeting, nebulous, and largely indescribable in their imagery, but carrying the same import of unavoidable doom. Flashes of lightless gulfs, endlessly imploding voids, vast basins filled with volcanic shadows, titanic shards of obliterated worlds floating listlessly in the black vacuity of outer space.... all omening some ultimate undoing of Life. 

And through it all, present amidst every abysmal vista, ubiquitous among the horrific scenery, was a figure—sometimes appearing as a solid, tangible thing; and other times as a warped, amorphous fragment of some ultra-human body; the nightmarish memory of something too horrible to maintain a composite form.  

And then, just as abruptly as it had come, the feeling left me. The dread and despair and awful, unplacatable sorrow melted away, and I was back at work—sitting calmly; suddenly instilled with a deep sense of clarity—of peacefulness. I looked into the cup, and saw my normal face reflected back at me. I was sure I would see a terror-stricken, despair-befallen expression; but my face was relaxed, my expression befitting someone who had moments ago been told they would no longer need to worry about some previously confounding problem.  

My coworker’s hand fell on my shoulder, and looking up at him I saw that same expression of total serenity. He smiled, and told me to find him after work. He then returned to his desk, and we separately attended to our tasks for the day.  

The day ended, and as he had asked, I found him waiting outside of the entrance to the building. He told me to follow him home, and without asking why, I complied. I knew immediately that there was more to the peculiar coffee; that the sordid, ineffable half-images and suggestions I had witnessed in my mind held a greater significance.  

He pulled into his driveway and I parked along the road, not expecting to be there for long. He waited for me to exit my car, and then gestured for me to follow him to the garage. First looking around furtively, he motioned for me to stand next to him, and then typed the door’s code into the keypad. The garage began to open, and just when it had risen to about chest level, he gripped me by the shoulders, pulled me down, and flung me inside. I barely managed to get my hands up and prevent myself from falling face-first onto the dusty concrete. I heard him clamber in behind me, and then the reversal of the garage’s motion boomed within the confined space. When it had finally closed, he helped me to my feet and apologized before I could come up with a complaint.  

“It’s better to enter from this way—to see it up front for the first time.”  

Without the evening light of outside, the garage was completely dark, and my coworker told me to wait a moment while he turned on a light. I expected either the dim, barely luminate glow of a cheap bulb, or the harsh, bug-attracting brilliance of a floodlight; but instead, an eerie crimson light filled the room; casting a sanguine gloom upon everything. The objects immediately near me were ordinary: a rusted mountain bike and a pump for its tires; a few unlabeled moving boxes; gardening tools hung on rubber hooks affixed to the left wall; a long metal chest against the right wall, probably containing fishing or hunting equipment. But in stark contrast to these mundane suburban items was the thing against the far wall of the garage, above which was situated the blood-tinged light.  

To put it plainly: It was a head. A massive, extremely rotted head.  

The sheer enormity of it was what I first noticed. It spanned the entire back wall of the garage, lying on its right cheek, facing us. From its intermittently lumpy and cratered scalp, to the tunnel-like stub of its neck, with the left temple almost touching the ceiling. Its skin, sallow and leprous, was taunt against the skull—the physiognomy wholly unidentifiable. The second thing I noticed—and was deeply appalled by—was the advanced state of is decomposition; but not just that, but how it seemed, despite this, to live! Its moldered—or rather, perpetually moldering—skin *pulsated,* the pustules and gangrenous lumps throbbing hideously; undergoing an impossible inflammation. The severity of its sickness, the undeniable certainty of its death, coupled with these contradictory signs of life reminded me of one of the more solid glimpses of that delirium-haunting figure; and I realized that I was looking at the real, physical form of that gulf-traversing emissary.  

“The Despair Priest. Or Preacher—whichever you prefer. He appeared in my garage one day, while I was watching that old TV. I’d been in a really good mood, had just finished watching a livestream of a Mass from my church back home. I hadn’t found a local one yet. Well, I guess my moment of....*triumphant spirituality* caught this thing’s attention. It appeared right there, simply manifested as if it had teleported from some other place. Only back then, it’s face hadn’t yet decayed. It was still dying, but there was more life than death in it. I was of course terrified, scared out of my fucking mind, and all the joy and love for the Lord bled out of me in an instant. Dread washed over me—but the most bizarre thing was how *good* it felt, if that makes sense. It was...intoxicating. The scale of my hopelessness somehow enthralled me.”  

The way he spoke about the experience was almost nostalgic, and I felt my body begin prepare for some kind of fight-or-flight state. His face, serene and pallid, looked deathly in the sanguine light—like a corpse reposed in an alcove within a torch-lit tomb. Not knowing how to respond, I just said, “Well, shit.”  

He nodded, a sorrowful smile spreading across his face, and then continued:  

“I sensed that it was dying; would’ve known even if I hadn’t been able to see the thing. I was also somehow made aware of the fact that it’s purpose was to spread this dread, to fill people with a horrible, terrible despair—wherever it could find them. The Dread Priest, evangelizing the cosmos with intimations and images of hopelessness and nihility. But it was dying, and it couldn’t fulfill this mantle completely. Had it been a little healthier, a little less eroded by rot, it would’ve succeeded in enrapturing me. I would’ve succumbed to an irremediable despair, and been left to.... die, probably. Either through self-neglect and malnutrition, or *self-termination*. But eventually, I snapped out of it, and left the garage.  

But the feeling still lingered, tiny sorrow-tipped hooks had been embedded in my psyche. Happiness and optimism returned to me eventually, and initially these feelings were more potent than they had ever been before. I felt exultant in my praise for God, joyous in my existence. But these intensities quiclky faded, and I was left dejected and glum. I didn’t want to admit it at first, but I knew I’d have to eventually return to it; that I’d have to eventually expose myself again to that Undying Thing—so that I could immerse myself in its unwholesome radiation, in order to feel the subsequent spiritual ecstasy of its absence.” 

It was a monstrous and darkly fantastic story, and I stared at the thing with a new level of disgust. It had come from some far-flung domain of space to spread despair, to bring civilizations to ruin not with cosmic violence or by annihilation of the dominant species, but through an emission of volatile hopelessness; a pervasive broadcast of mortal futility.  

Having an idea, but needing to confirm it, I asked that unspeakable, darkly revelatory question: “What does this have to do with the coffee?”  

My coworker pulled his mug from his pocket (I hadn’t noticed he’d been carrying it with him) and went over to the ghoulish head. As casually as if it were a drink dispenser, he put his cup under one of the ever-seeping pores, until the foul black slime filled it to the brim. Then, without a moment of hesitation, he brought the mug to his lips and took a sip.  

His revulsion was more powerful than I’d ever seen, and he lingered longer than usual in that state of despondent reflection; but he soon recovered, and dumped the rest into the eyeless socket abreast with his shoulder.  

“I only add a little to my morning coffee. If I were to drink a whole cup of this, I’d surely lose myself to that awful sorrow—if it didn’t outright kill me due to some kind of toxicity at high dosages. But yeah, that’s it. I add a little to my coffee, suffer through that micro-dose of despair—and then spend the rest of the day feeling pretty damn good. I have to take a sip here and there, sure; the periods can vary in length, but I’d say it’s still better than just....enduring life as it is, you know? Even with religious optimism, life can really fucking suck, and somedays it’s almost intolerably hard to get up and go to work and *exist.* At least this way I’m chasing a state of harmless optimism and positivity, rather than some ever-dwindling state of normalcy. It’s even helped me feel closer to God, if you can believe it.”  

While I doubted that final part of his claim, I saw the sense in the rest of it. I had felt *good* after the clearing of the despair; though I was already feeling a little low, a little deprived of my intoxicant-induced joy. I had so many questions for him. Why keep it? Why not show the authorities, or scientists, or try to destroy it? But as the seconds ticked by, and I smelled the weird, not-right scent of its ceaseless decomposition, I knew that I would’ve refrained from showing anyone else, as well. I wanted another taste—*craved* the post-trauma clarity and elation. My coworker had been granted a warped miracle, and had the same been done for me, I wouldn’t have told a soul.  

Sensing my desire, he told me to wait there and then went into the house. A few moments later, he returned bearing two cups of steaming coffee.  

“I keep my coffeemaker set to brew up a batch in time with my arrival home. I like to stick to a routine with this stuff.”  

He brought both cups under two separate streams of the sickeningly slushy liquid, only for a moment, and then withdrew them; their surfaces tinged with a deeper darkness than before. Smiling, he extended a cup to me, and I accepted the stygian mix like a dying man accepting his last rites.  

Together we drank, despaired, and, afterwards, danced.

Not every house of death looks like one.

Sure, some are your classic monstrosities that seem to constantly be in the shadows and scream "if you come in here YOU will be murdered". Some, however, look like a two-story split colonial with a completed basement, an attached garage, a manicured lawn, is freshly painted, and a white picket fence out front.

"So sorry we're late!" I shouted from the driveway to the realtor who was waiting at the door. We were fifteen minutes late and I was the only one in my family who noticed or cared.

"Nonsense! Hello, hello, please come in. Welcome to your new house" The realtor said cheerfully. "So there's four of you?"

"Yes, I know on the phone I said that it would just be three of us, but my husband decided to come along." I did my best to smile as I shoved my family along. My husband, who definitely did not want to come along, immediately perked up at the sight of the gorgeous realtor and her very low cut outfit.

"Oh, that's... great, the more, the merrier," the realtor looked off and then snapped back into uber-cheer-mode, "besides, this house is great and you all will love it!"

"Well, if you come with it!" My husbad said. To him, this was both charming and hillarious. My two kids groaned. That was the most responsive they have been all day. Despite my family's need to move, none of the other members of my family seem interested in participating. As always, it's up to me, the mom. The realtor laughed at my husband's sexism because she felt she had to.

"Ha ha," I was mortified. "But I can't believe this house is still on the market. It's perfect."

"Well, you made my job easier. But since we've come all this way, let me show you around before we make it official." The realtor stood in the door way, beckoning us towards her.

I stuck my hand out. "Hi, I'm Justine Flood. This is my husband, Dave. And my two beautiful and charismatic children, Kyle and Babs." The realtor gave me a hearty shake.

"Hello," she cooed, "my name is Lillian, and I am going to sell you this house today." My husband's sweaty hand shot out eagerly for the first chance he could touch this woman. She offered her hand as if she was a dainty princess and my husband gushed.

"Gosh, this area sure is beautiful." He said, looking directly at the realtor's breasts, "Beautiful and huge."

The realtor shifted her body as quickly as possible. She glanced at my teens who were glued to their phones and decided to not try to shake their hands. Lillian could have been naked and on fire and they would not have noticed. "Ahem, yes. Lots of space to run and play here." She said and directed us inside. As we shuffled in, the realtor slammed the door closed behind us. "Now, as you can see, this door is plenty heavy and secure." She turned a bolt and we heard a loud \*ka-chunk\*. "Honestly, someone could take a sledgehammer to this door and it is not budging." She said with her plastered on smile.

The house opened up to a living room with a hall on the right that lead to the bed rooms and a hall to the left that lead to the garage, dinning room, kitchen and garage (I came prepared). "Now, as you can see, this living room is huge. It has excellent accoustics and this carpet is the best. You can spill anything on it... and I mean anything and no one would know. There could have been a pool of blood where you are standing a week ago and this carpet just absorbes it up." I side-eyed my family to see if they found this selling point to be odd. But my husband was looking at Lillian's ass and my kids were not paying attention.

"Yeah, sure is fine," Dave said, "Isn't it great kids?" They mumbled something.

"Now let's go down the hall to the bed rooms." Lillian gestured. My husband chuckled at the idea of going to the bed room with her. My kids followed, I am unsure they knew we were in a new house. "Now, as you can see, down this hall there are four bedrooms. Each of them can lock from either side and they are totally soundproof!" Lillian said with a smile. "Why don't each of you pick a room and see... or should I say... hear for yourselves." My husband laughed at her 'joke'. The kids finally snapped to attention when they figured they could be picking their new room and jockeyed for the largest. Everyone quickly went into a room and slammed the door. Lillian and I were in the hall way, "Please, try a room. I promise you won't hear a thing!" She said, the tip of her smile twitched.

I picked an unoccupied room and closed the door. "Ah." I said blandly as if to test the soundproof-ness. While that is nice, I was curious as to why that was a feature? I looked around the room. It was very cold. There was no furniture or anything making the whole room incredibly bleak. I opened the closet. It seemed normal until I turned on the light. Inside the closet there looking to be scratch marks in the wall. It was almost as if something was dragged away and really didn't want to go. "Huh," I muttered, "the last owner must have had a dog? I guess I can plaster over this later." And shrugged.

I went back into the hall way. Dave, Babs, and Lillian were there. Babs was back to her phone and Dave was telling Lillian about a fish he caught last week. "OK, good, we're all here, let's explore upstairs." Lillian cheered.

"Um, where's Kyle?" I asked, looking around for my son. I looked into the room he scampered into, but it was empty. "KYLE!?" I called out in a panic.

"Oh, Kyle told me that he wanted to explore the house on his own. He said we were slowing him down. HIC!" Lillian hiccuped loudly. "Excuse me." I didn't notice before, but Lillian was a little chubbier than I thought. I mean, all the power to her, but she just seemed heavier now. The buttons on her shirt seemed to be straining to stay closed. And her belly was forcing pushing her pants to the limit. Ugh, it's rude of me to say, I know. Just, as a chubby woman, I usually notice other successful plus sized women and I don't remember Lillian looking as round as she did now.

"That sounds like him. Punk kid thinks he knows better than everyone. Not like we need him for this anyays," my husband barrelled ahead. "Please, darling, continue the tour."

"Right this way." Lillian turned and led us back to the dining room as I watched her thick ass jiggle with each step and the stairs creaked under her feet.

We climbed up the steps, everything was very standard. Lillian pointed out the great closet space with locks on the outside, the number of crawl spaces that one could hide in, and the ample area to keep and hold several extra guests. There was even an extra kitchen upstairs to "store excess meats" in. And while her phasing was specific and not necessarily something I would be interested in, I could not deny the space was great. We then went back downstairs. Kyle was no where to be found.

"Now," she patted her chest and belched under her breath, "urp. pardon. Now this dining room is incredible. As you can see, there's room here for a long banquet table if you're ever hosting a feast." Lillian licked her lips as she looked at Babs. "Plus, with the access to the kitch \*hep\* right through these doors, you can be enjoying your meals in just a matter of... minutes." We looked around. I noticed the steel bars around the windows. They were sturdy. As I checked out the lighting, Lillian chimed in, "let's move on to the garage, shall we?" Her smile seemed wider.

As we went from the kitchen to the garage, I noted that Lillian sniffed Babs as she passed. But with all of the perfume teens wear these days, I'm probably nose deaf to it. "Oh Babs, dear." Lillian called out. "this garage gets terrible service. Something to do with the solid concrete walls. If your texting is important, you might want to stay in the dining room." Babs perked up.

"Oh? Huh. Yeah. Thanks." She said and she stopped walking with us.

"Um, honey," I called out, "this is important. This could be our new house, you should stay with us. I'm sure whomever you're texting can wait."

"Nonsense!" Dave undermined me immediately. "If Kyle gets to explore, so should Babs! We'll probably end up buying this place, so they'll have plenty of time to pretend to care about the garage." I was furious, but that's all Babs needed to leave the garage and she was gone. Lillian showed us how the reinforced garage door were also, you guessed it, sound proof and could "keep a buffalo out" (whatever that meant). Lillian then showed us the attic above the garage. She pulled down a string and a ladder unfolded.

"Now up here, well, why don't you two check it out. I forgot something in the other room. I'll be right back." Lillian turned back.

"What'd you leave?" I called out.

"Don't ask that, she's a professional." Dave answered. "This one, am I right? Always with the questions." He laughed to Lillian while pointing at me. Lillian smiled automatically and then sauntered out.

"WHAT is wrong with you?" I smacked Dave in the face as soon as the garage door closed.

"What the fuck?!" He shouted.

"Don't you think this is weird?"

"What? How clean this garage is?" He shrugged.

"Where's our son? Why is this place sealed up tight and why is every room sound proof? Doesn't it seem weird that Lillian gained weight in the twenty minutes that we've been here? Why are all of her selling points related to how many bodies can be stored in here?" I pulled out my phone, there was full service, "and there's service here, we need to get our daughter before..." Dave grabbed me and snarled.

"Before what, Justine? What are you sayin? You're upset that this house is safe and protected? That there's privacy? And maybe she knows what a psycho you are? And I'm sorry and you insinuating that the realtor broad what? Ate our son and is about to eat our girl?" He rolled his eyes and instantly made me feel small. "And your proof that there's cell service in the garage? Way to go Van Halenside, you cracked the case." He shoved me. "How dare you hit me. Why are we here? Why are we looking for a new home, eh? Before you start accusing other people of being monsters again..."

"Sorry, am I, \*BURP\*, interrupting something?" Lillian appeared in the door, she was dabbing the sides of her mouth with a hankercheif which she then tucked into the pocket of her mumu that clinged to her even larger figure. She noticed our faces of shock. "Oh, I apologize for the costume change, but my suit just burst... ripped... on a nail. So I had to change. Don't want to be \*HIC\* unprofessional." Her massive size blocked the door. "Excuse me," she tapped her chest, "must have been something I ate." She smirked.

"Um, honey." I turned to reach for Dave but my loving husband was no longer by my side.

"You know, I'm going to check out this attic." Dave said as he got to the top of the ladder and Lillian moved closer, her giant belly leading the way. "Um, better yet, I'll check it out by myself." He quickly pulled the ladder up and left me alone.

"What an asshole." I muttered to myself as Dave pulled the attic door shut.

"Looks like it's just us," Lillian said as she walked up next to me and wrapped her meaty arm around my shoulder.

"Oh, I'm sure Dave will be right back, how long can you look around an attic?" I chuckled anxiously.

"Oh no, that door only opens from down here," I could hear her belly churning what I'm assuming is my kids, resulting in another belch. "\*BURP\* Oh, excuse me. Something is just not agreeing with me."

"Teenagers are like that," I said under my breath.

"Mmm, what was that?" Lillian continued to lead me out of the garage.

"No, nothing. Um, where are we going? I feel like we've seen everything."

"We still need to look into the kitchen." Lillian said through her smile.

Because of her new size, Lillian practically pushed me through the door and followed behind. She had gotten so wide that it was a tight squeeze for her, amplified by a slight grunt.

"So this is an incredibly modern kitchen. All new appliances, including my favorite, this oven. Why it's so big, you could put a person in it." She said through her plastered grin.

I looked at the island in the kitchen, "and enough storage under here. Wow... this is... nice..." I chuckled. Lillian did not chuckle, she just got closer to me.

"Why don't you try getting in there?" Lillian gestured to the oven. "It's fun."

"I-I'm actually not into cooking, I usually order in" I said while patting my belly, "that's why I've been been putting on some weight recently."

"No kidding? Me too," Lillain taunted. "Get in the oven." She barked.

"So, Lillian, how long as this house been on the market." I said, starting to tear up.

"Oh, it seems like forever." She continued to smile, "Lots of people come by. But even though it's a great house, no one ever seems interested in \*HIC\* staying around too long."

"That's surprising. It's a great neighborhood and the price on this house is really affordable."

"I know right?" Lillian kept trying to get close to me, but I kept walking around under the pretense of looking at the house.

"Huh, I wonder where those kids are?" I said, trying to get her to admit to what she's done.

"Oh, you know kids, I bet they're closer than you think." Lillians now chubby cheeks made her wide grin seem more terrifying. She's literally just playing with her food at this point. Part of me wanted to just join my kids, but that's not who I was. I was a fighter, a killer, I've been through too much to get eaten by this monster in this house. This house, which I have been told is sound-proof and escape-proof. This house, which I have now put together, is a trap for this monster to feed. What luck.

"You know," I started walking towards Lillian, who was slightly taken aback by my confidence. I was faking it, but I had no other options, "you know, I bet this house gets a lot of visitors. I'm sure open houses are just a wild buffet... of potential buyers?"

"You have \*HIC\* no idea." Lillian purred.

"But I bet this house gets a little... too crowded... too full, for four people. I bet this house would have been way more comfortable if just my kids and I showed up as planned." I was in front of Lillian, trying to establish dominance. My heart was racing and I could feel myself sweating. "So how about this? I leave. My shitty husband stays. And you never see me again?" I could see the wheels turning in Lillian's head. "Not to mention, I'll leave a positive review online. I bet you don't end up with too many of those." I poked her belly which forced out another belch.

"No, I generally don't leave too many people alive for that," She mused, dropping the facade for a moment as she drummed her fingers on her stomach. "I am already pretty full. And who would believe you anyways?" She then grinned and held out her hand.

We walked back into the garage. I went up to the attic door and pulled the drawstring. Sure enough, my cowardly husband came tumbling down.

"What's a matter Dave? Couldn't come down to save me?" I said coldly.

"Oh, Justine, I knew you'd be alright. You're so smart." Dave groveled on his knees. He couldn't even look me in the eyes. "You're so smart and strong. I knew you could beat that monster." I started walking towards the kitchen and he got up and followed behind me. "You're so strong and beautiful. I figured I would just slow you down." I entered the kitchen with him still following me like a pitiful animal. I refused to make eye contact. "Say, how did you defeat her? I know you say you killed monsters before, but what happened with her?"

"Simple, I fed her." I opened up the large oven door and looked back and saw the monsterous Lillian quietly crawl out from underneath the kitchen island. Despite her massive frame, she stealthfully rolled out and positioned herself behind my soon-to-be-ex-husband. His dumb confused face would be the last expression he would ever make as Lillian unhinged her jaw and closed it around Dave's head. She slurped and chomped and gulped. Her strong arms were shoveling him back despite his best to wriggle free. In a matter of moments, Dave was gone.

"What a meal!" Lillian shouted as she belched triumphantly. The now once thin realtor was an spherical monster. Her belly, consisting of my family, blorped and churned as she licked her fingers, savoring the last of my husband. "You were right, this house," she patted her belly, "gets too crowded. I am \*Urp\* stuffed." She used her long nail to pick her teeth as I stood there blinking.

It took some doing, but she was finally able to hoist herself up after a moment. "Can I go?" I asked meekly. She nodded, rubbing her belly.

"WAIT!" She called out, making me jump, "you're \*hic\* husband said you killed monsters before... what the fuck did he mean by that."

"Oh, it's nothing, I really should go." I said quickly.

"Take one more step out that door and I'll eat you. I don't care if I \*urp\* explode." Lillian threatened. I stopped and smiled since my plan was starting to come together.

"Well," my eyes widened, "I have always believed that there are monsters out there walking among us. And most of them are fine and good and just want to live a life. But some, as you know, are the stuff that nightmares are born from." I walked back closer to the kitchen, Lillian smiled at the idea of being the cause of nightmares. "So a few months ago, I was living a simple life when all of a sudden, I was out for a jog and I was attacked by a 'man' with two sets of teeth, impossibly long arms, and yellow glowing eyes. Is that a relative of yours?"

"Don't be racist" Lillian responded, out of breath and clearly still uncomfortably full.

"Sorry, anyways, while he was attacking me, I lucked out and kicked onto neighboring train tracks. His foot got stuck and he was obliterated by an oncoming train. The cops didn't even think I was attacked, let alone by a monster. They just wanted to know why I was jogging so late. Thankfull there were enough bruises for most people to believe me. But they all thought it was just a mugging gone wrong. But a few weeks later, I discovered my neighbors were also monsters. I went to return a piece of mail when I accidentally saw them speaking to each other with mouths in the back of their heads." I paused, but Lillian was nonplused. "So that night, I set their house on fire after strapping them to their beds." Lillian seemed impressed by that. "But the problem was that their bodies burnt up so it looks like I just killed my human neighbors. My poor family didn't believe me. But we had no choice to move and move quickly." I extended my arms, "and here we are."

"Ah, so while you're out there killing monsters, your family believes you're killing regular people." Lilliam summarized.

"I think they would rather stick with a murderer than go through the trouble of leaving me. Besides, they wouldn't last three days without me." I shrugged. "But I like your method. No bodies left behind. No evidence. Clean."

"Yeah, except for some outgrown clothes and the worries of getting too fat, it's pretty good." She smacked her belly and let out another belch, "and the indigestion is killer sometimes."

"Yeah, I'll try to remember that after I eat you." I said as I started to run. The monster looked as confused as Dave did as I lunged across the island and shoved the monster back. Her new heft had her uneasy on her feet and the momentum of her belly caused her to topple back. Topple back into the giant oven that I left open which, as advertised, could fit a person... or amonster. I used my forward momentum to force the rest of this bitch into the oven. She struggled and kicked, but my family made her too overstuffed and she ended up wedging herself more and more in there. I fired up the oven and eventually slammed the door shut.

All of that would have been really loud... thankfully everything in this house is sound-proof.

I let her bake for several hours. Checking in every few moments to make sure she was dead. After her body got a nice golden brown crisp to her I carefully took her out and carved up a hunk. I don't know what she was, but she was delicious. It took me about a week, but I eventually ate her down to the bones. Of course, the bitch gave me horrible heartburn and about thirty pounds to remind me of her. But no big deal.

The end...

&#x200B;

Except not quite. See, the weirdest thing happened after I ate her. I started to get these pangs of hunger. And even if I'd binge until my stomach was about to pop, there was no food that could satiate these cravings. Yes, it occurred to me that eating random monsters who definitely still had my human families in their belly may have caused some... side effects. So, like always, I adapted. I am now a realtor and since my competition disappeared, I'm the best and only one around.

And I have an AMAZING house for you!

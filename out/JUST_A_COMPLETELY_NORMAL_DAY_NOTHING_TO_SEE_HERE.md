**MONDAY - 7:00 AM:**

I wake early. The room is filled with a grey smog: I must have been smoking in my sleep again.

My wife sleeps next to me, oblivious.

I try and look for the cigarette butts. Nowhere to be found.

Peer out the window. Mr. Rallins stands in the front garden, in his tattered old suit, staring back up at me. He sways slightly, old age, I guess, and raises a hand in a half-wave half-salute. I don’t wave back.

**7:30 AM:**

I make breakfast for the kids, who are already at the dinner table. Always earlier than me - always. I make a joke that their Pops is getting old, huh, that teenagers aren’t meant to be up before noon.

They’re silent.

I don’t think they get the joke.

I pour cornflakes into two bowls, and then add milk until it nearly reaches the lip, watch how the liquid settles around the irregular shapes of the cereal. Pour them orange juice in two tall thin glasses.

Place this all on the table, say a half-mumbled grace as I fix myself coffee.

The kids don’t drink their juice, nor eat their cereal, just bicker in that way kids can, making stupid facial expressions at eachother, and I’ve got no time for it - really, no time at all - and so I shout at them (which I regret now, honest) and pour the OJ all over their laps and say if you’re going to act like children-

Sorry, I’m saying, sorry. Too far. I know.

**7:45 AM:**

My wife’s adorable. So sleepy! Like a little dormouse. I pick her up and have to - can you believe it - carry her downstairs!

**8:00 AM:**

I walk to work.

It does not take very long.

**8:30 AM:**

I make small incisions on the soft pad of each of my fingertips so that I wince whenever I hold a pen or press a key on a keyboard.

**9:00 AM:**

Roger comes in to work, we spend the first hour or so going over the cargo. He wears plastic gloves and I use my bare hands, and he says that’s gross, that’s weird, and I argue that look, if you’ve got such a problem with it why don’t you fuckin call head office and whine to them.

That shuts him up.

We make our notes, tick all the correct boxes.

**10:00 AM:**

Roger goes upstairs to get us coffee, and someone from Upper Management comes downstairs.

They knock three times on the door. It’s them. They’ve come again.

They run their hands over the cargo that’s on the table in front of me, take their time, savour the cool surface. Say they would very much like this one, they would like it very much indeed.

I let them have it, mark the required boxes, delete the required files, update what needs to be updated.

**10:30 AM:**

I get a text:

We are watching. We are waiting. There is something that crawls beneath that we have to liberate and our skin is a cage and our mouths are pretty flowers.

Huh. Wrong number, I guess.

**11:00 AM:**

I watch videos on my phone during my coffee break.

In the last five minutes, before I head back downstairs, I make small incisions in the palms of my hands and lap at them like deer at a salt lick. It does not escape my attention, trust me, that there have been those from history with these very wounds, in fact maybe the most important man of all, and it gives me some satisfaction to know that he too, the Wise and the Just and the Lamb, felt the same pain whenever he wriggled his fingers.

**11:30 AM:**

I sneeze three times in a row.

One-Two-Three, can you believe it? Just like that.

**12:00 PM:**

Delia has a few choice words for me: I’ve been slacking, I’m not paying any attention to my job, I smell a little funny. Blah blah fucking blah. DELIA!

What a bitch.

Whaddabitch. Say it with me, all one word: whaddabitch.

Yeah, sure, Delia. I smirk, giving her that rare and wry wit I’m known for, yeah, sure I’ll pay more attention.

(She has no fucking clue what she’s talking about)

**1:00 PM:**

Lunch Break. I have my favourite, meatballs and no sauce. Just five little meat dumplings that I eat by holding them in my mouth  until I begin to salivate and I can feel the spit in the gutters of my mouth, warm and with the fragrance of uncooked flesh and I sit like that with my eyes closed or half-rolled back in my head.

That is, until, Delia (you guessed it) tells me to move on. To keep working.

She is a NIGHTMARE!

**1:30 PM:**

A human head remains conscious for about twenty seconds after being decapitated.

**2:00 PM:**

I catch someone from Upper Management watching through a window as I work. I wave back with the limp hand of the cargo: *hello!* The wrist is all stiff, to be expected, but I think they get the joke.

**2:30 PM:**

Upper Management take me into a little room upstairs for a ‘quick chat’. They’re all wearing masks - these black cloth sacks over their heads.

I think it’s a prank, but I go along with it anyway: I skin the whole goat! Or whatever the damn phrase is. You know what I mean.

**2:45 PM:**

I am borrrrred. Bored bored bored.

**3:00 PM**

Roger comes in with a clipboard.

Can I take a donation? He asks.

Yeah, Roger, what’s this for?

He frowns. You know this, you know exactly what it’s for.

(I very much don’t!)

The fundraiser. For Delia’s charity, the one she chose, remember?

I blink.

Roger shakes his head.

When she died, she said it would mean the world if we all donated a bit. She battled with it all her life, man.

Delia winks at me from the corner, runs her tongue over her teeth.

**3:30 PM:**

Another cup of coffee.

I’m some sort of coffee-machine!

**4:00 PM:**

I daydream about flaying the skin of my feet and my wrists, little ribbons, and I imagine them all in a mess on the floor like the curly bits of sawdust or potato peel in the bin. *That* makes me think of my wife, who’s probably cooking dinner right now, probably working on making sure her handsome-hunk-of-a-husband is going to be well fed.

I think about putting my head in an open doorframe and paying someone good money to slam the door on my head over and over and over and over again. Imagine myself whimpering all bloody and bruised like in those movies you watch, all boohoo and poor me, and then I imagine wetting myself in front of them with my hands up they like they do in cartoons, like *uh-oh! oopsie daisie!*

**4:30 PM:**

I take a piss. Consider going number two, but I’d prefer to save that for when I get home.

**4:40 PM:**

When you think about it, if you’re kissing someone for twenty whole seconds, that’s a pretty *damn* long kiss!

**5:00 PM:**

Please don’t end work day - *please don’t end please don’t end.*

I imagine myself naked and bound to the hand of a giant clock and beneath me is this vast and churning ocean slowly rising and all I can do is hold my breath and pray that there’s nothing in the water and that I am alone.

I’m so scared my teeth are chattering.

**5:15 PM:**

Another wrong number fiasco. A voicemail this time, some low and gravelly voice who’s obviously having *some* sort of party because there are these high pitched female moans in the background and the voice is saying: what lies beneath the skin longs to get out and the soul is trapped by bone and we do not have to live like this it can all be so much more.

**6:00 PM:**

On the way home from work I find a dog on the side of the road. I pick it up, and throw it in the boot. It’s cold, and stiff, and smells, but I’m attached already. I name him Rocket.

The kids will LOVE him.

**7:00 PM:**

Mr. Rallins is outside my house still, stood on the lawn, swaying, and I shout: hello Mr. Rallins! And he says nothing back. He’s just swaying and muttering in that broken old voice of his: help me oh god help me please god help me.

**8:00 PM:**

I was wrong.

My wife has NOT made dinner. She has stood in the same fuckin place since morning. Lazy cow. The kids don’t react to the dog either, just sit there, staring at eachother.

It’s like no one in this family appreciates my hard work!

I take out a stack of plates from the cupboard and throw them one by one at the wall and then collect myself.

Sorry.

That was rash of me. That was, over the top.

I’m sorry. I should learn better how to control my feelings I should not be so rash and impulsive I am forever grateful for your eternal patience as a family now would someone clean the DAMN MESS UP.

**8:15 PM:**

A neighbour knocks on the door.

Hello? What was all that noise about?

I charm the man, explain that my wife is a bit cold (ha-ha!) and that I slipped whilst making dinner.

He asks to come in.

Mr. Rallins is still going on about needing help.

Sorry, Sir, you can’t come in.

My wife’s..er..naked.

The neighbour blinks. Right.

I shrug, and coded in that shrug is anything every man understands instantly: *women, huh?*

Rocket lies by the door, all glassy-eyed.

**8:50 PM:**

Dinner. Kids don’t eat, wife doesn’t seem hungry either.

No plates to eat it on either - so I eat off the floor and pile the food between my crossed legs.

I watch an old episode of Seinfeld - *man!* that guy sure is funny.

You’re right! Shoe stores are weird - ha-ha-ha! Why do they hit the shoe once they’ve put it on? And after they’ve tied it up so damn tight!

Funny, funny guy.

**9:00 PM:**

I pour boiling water on my belly.

**9:15 PM:**

Read a little. Getting into self-help at the moment, I think this year I’ve made my way through about fifty or so.

This one’s all about Laws to Power. Things like conceal your intentions! And, number four: always say less than necessary.

I wonder if there’s one about how to understand women! That would be a hoot.

**9:30 PM:**

Missed a couple spots from dinner and so I crawl around licking it up off the floor.

Waste-not-want-not!

**10:00 PM:**

Upper Management come over, three of them let themselves in. Naked, wearing those black cloth sacks over their heads, their bodies all fleshy and dimpled.

They paint something on the floor, I don’t know what though, what am I? A god-damned-symbologist? Ha-ha.

Looks like a funny star.

One of them strokes my wife and kids, comments on how cold my wife is, how well her skin has kept, and then the woman with them just leans in and tongues her open mouth - wowee! - and that’s that.

They light these bundles of herbs and begin chanting things in a language I don’t understand.

Once this is done they take me and my wife upstairs, having to carry my wife again (that damned woman!) and do the same procedure.

I tell them I need to sleep, and they seem okay with that, standing naked by my bed, chanting, waving those bundles of herbs around the place smells like some sort of hippy commune.

I’m half asleep but I can hear them bring someone upstairs, is that Rogers voice? And he’s whimpering and squealing like a stuck pig and I think they bleed him like one too but I don’t see it just hear it, a slick sound like scissors through paper and then a wet splashing sound like spilt orange juice and then convulsions and then nothing.

Early night for me!

**TUESDAY - 7:00 AM:**

I wake early. The room is filled with a grey smog: I must have been smoking in my sleep again.

My wife sleeps next to me, oblivious.

I try and look for the cigarette butts. [Nowhere to be found.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Max_Voynich/comments/ezh9p3/story_masterpost/)

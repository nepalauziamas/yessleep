“Receive a chilling experience with our surprise box. Five items that will make shivers crawl down your spine and reveal your hidden fears! 14 days money back guarantee…” - the page said. 

&#x200B;

But I’m getting ahead of myself. It all started when I discovered the thing called “mystery boxes”. If you don’t know what that is - you pay something around 20 to 40 Euros and receive a box filled with different themed stuff. It’s quite a popular thing, so I bet you’ve heard of it. 

&#x200B;

That evening I was browsing aimlessly and some ad reminded me that this thing exists. So I googled a bit and the search returned a bunch of links and brief descriptions. Most of the themes were frankly aimed for children entertainment with Harry Potter, Paw Patrol & some other cartoon and family friendly universes. 

Some interesting ones popped up too - Classic Slashers, It Came from Outer Space and Morbid Creatures. Examining the “previous months” section (which actually revealed what was sent out prior to current one) I saw bunch of mini-figures, posters, some branded mugs and other crap. 

&#x200B;

But I was looking for something different, so I modified the search to “mature surprise box + horror + scary”. 

And it returned another pile of links, with the topmost being the one I’ve opened just recently. And indeed, the store that was selling all those Harry Potter & Star Wars junk had a section called “Pure Nightmare Material”. I even had to select and confirm my age to be able to view the page. 

&#x200B;

Surprisingly - it had no previous monthly drops displayed and the statement said it was an experimental thing they just launched. Exciting! So I grabbed my credit card  and filled in the info instantly. 

The description said something about revealing the nightmares you never even knew existed and that the assembly and delivery will take around 5-10 business days. The whole thing was like 24.99 or something. 

&#x200B;

The long wait resulted in postal notification two weeks later and that day I came back home with a box. It wasn’t large - about 30x30x30cm or so, and when I removed the packaging - it came out even smaller. A cardboard of black color with silver letters printed atop, reading: “Pure Nightmare Material. Issue 1”.

&#x200B;

Wow! The guys out there really knew how to make an impression. And so, with raising excitement I took the box cutter and carefully cut the plastic seal to reveal the insides.  

&#x200B;

There were 5 smaller boxes made of the same black cardboard stacked next to each other and every one of them had a separate writing atop. Left to right, in same silver letters they read: Obsession, Sympathy, Life, Desperation and finally - Tranquility. Boy, oh boy! I jumped in my chair just like a kid on Christmas. This was quite something.

&#x200B;

So, I made myself some tea, took a deep breath to calm down my impatience and reached for the first box named “Obsession”. What could it be? No clue whatsoever.

&#x200B;

Inside there was a plastic bag with a zipper containing a pair of… How would I say it correctly? A pair of ladie’s panties. I’m not an expert of any sort, but it seemed to me that those were worn previously. A pair of blue thongs with some white and yellow flowers pattern. I’ve checked the box thoroughly - but nothing else was there. I expected a note at least, saying that these are “haunted underwear of a prostitute killed by maniac” or something like that, but nope. Just the awkward bag and the thongs in it. 

&#x200B;

Suddenly the door lock clicked - my girlfriend was back from work.

“Hey, honey! Before you ask anything - don’t freak out. There’s something I need to show you” - I said greeting her in the hall. 

&#x200B;

“I’ve ordered a surprise box, and well… It came with a surprise indeed. Those were inside, and before you ask anything - I have no idea what it means. Just didn’t want you to find it tossed in trash and get the wrong impression” - I said. 

&#x200B;

She kept silent for a moment and then suddenly her lower lip started to tremble, as the tears poured down her cheeks. “Give me a moment, I’ll be right back” - she said covering her mouth with a palm of her hand, making her way to the bathroom. 

&#x200B;

I didn’t expect a reaction like that. Diana had a great sense of humor, so maybe a pun or two - but this was something completely different. I stood there in the room, listening to sobs and flowing water from the bathroom. 

&#x200B;

Finally, she came out with her face all red and swollen, make-up poorly washed, leaving some traces on her cheekbones. 

&#x200B;

“Jake, I can’t… I don’t know how you found out and if you even did, but I can’t keep it anymore… Do you remember my birthday party two years ago? The one where you received a call from work and had to leave because of urgent problems with your stupid project? I got drunk that night. I didn’t go to sleepover with Pam, no. There was a guy in the restaurant and I was so angry at you and so drunk… Jake, I cheated on you. And those” - she pointed at the panties lying on the table - “I think I forgot them at his place. I’m so sorry. I’ll give you some space, okay? I don’t know if you can forgive me…”.

&#x200B;

We argued for 20 more minutes and finally she left. She said she’ll stay at her mother’s place, so I could think if I still have feelings for her after what she did.

&#x200B;

I got drunk that night. And no, I won’t whine how bad it was or anything. You don’t need that in your life.

&#x200B;

This event kicked the chair from beneath my feet and for couple of days I never came back to the box. And I didn’t see any connection back then, as you know - coincidences can strike quite unexpectedly. 

&#x200B;

But as my rage and sad thoughts started to fade away - one evening I was bored and recalled I still have something to impress me. 

&#x200B;

So I took out the second box entitled “Sympathy” to reveal another zip bag with a heart shaped pendant and a note this time. The pendant was a cheap one - just like those you could get at fairs for dirt cheap and I had a vague feeling I saw it before somewhere. The note said just this: “Ask Kirk about it”. 

&#x200B;

Well, it was strange, yet I knew exactly what to do. You see - Kirk is my best friend’s name. We were indivisible since early childhood and up to the point where adult life separated us. He was a married man, had couple of kids and lived on the opposite side of the city. We still called each other regularly and played some video games online from time to time. I have no idea how those folks found out about him - probably they took their business seriously, and tracked my Facebook page to get these details. I remember clicking through some “personal data consent” and “allowing cookies”, but hey, every site nowadays does that. 

&#x200B;

So as it was quite an intriguing development - I jumped into the car and went straight to him, luckily it was a half hour ride. 

&#x200B;

“Yo, Kirk. I have bought this thing…” - I explained to him, as we greeted each other. 

&#x200B;

“And, well, this piece was inside. Does it resemble anything?” - I asked - “I know, it’s stupid. But I was just curious. 

&#x200B;

“Nope. Not a clue, Jake. Sorry, mate. Would you like a beer or two, since you made all the way here?” - he said in response. 

&#x200B;

“Nah, I have to work tomorrow, but thanks for asking and say ”hi“ to Liz.” - I replied. Something in his voice caught my attention, I’m not sure what it was. I swear, there was something odd, but I didn't give it a second thought. 

&#x200B;

Anyways, I got home and double checked the page of that company. Yet indeed - a small text (of course, it’s the small text) said that the Company requires consent on using personal data of the buyer to come up with best experience possible, such as checking through Social Media pages for details and such and such. 

&#x200B;

I’ve heard stories about evil corporations stealing data, but I’m a kind of guy that has nothing to hide, so…

&#x200B;

I took out the third box with the word “Life” imprinted on the top. As the second item came back a disappointment - I had quite high expectations for this one. 

&#x200B;

I’ve revealed the contents and became an owner of not just one, but three weird things this time. 

I got a small pillow case with teddy bears and stars with stripes, which I guess resembled comets and a pair of massive pink plastic earring, just like the ones you could see in the 80’s movies. 

&#x200B;

I sat there for 15 minutes straight trying to realize the connection between items, as suddenly a distant memory from my childhood surfaced - I was not quite sure, but I guess my Mom used to wear the exact same pair when she was younger, or?

&#x200B;

So I decided to FaceTime her and ask for help solving this case.

&#x200B;

“Hi-i-i, sweetheart. How’s it going? Your dad and I got worried, since it’s been couple of weeks you called last time. Everything fine?” - my Mom greeted me.

&#x200B;

“Hi! Yes, everything’s alright, just been a bit busy lately. No worries…” - I replied and we talked on various topics, up to a point where I showed her the earrings - “… do you recognize those? I think you had just the exact pair back in the days.” 

I held them in front of the camera, twisting around so she could take a better look.

&#x200B;

“No, sweetie. I have no memory of those. Where did you get it?” - she asked, so I briefly explained her a concept of a “surprise box” and said that this one is more of a game-type, where you are sent clues and have to figure them out. 

&#x200B;

“This was inside too. Maybe this will ring a bell?” - I showed her the pillow case, making sure she sees the pattern clearly - “It has teddy bears and comets on it. Any ideas?”.

&#x200B;

She took a pause, looking carefully and then replied, swallowing saliva: “No, Jake. I’m sorry, I don’t recall anything of those. Hope I didn’t ruin your… game”.

&#x200B;

I said it was okay and we talked a bit more and then hang up. Strange, a shocking coincidence in the first box and absolutely nothing in the following. I guess that’s what you get for 24.99 - they try to come up with something and sometimes it works, sometimes - it doesn’t. Oh well, I had stuff to do, so I totally switched to household tasks and working on the next project, up to a point where I felt it was quite late and headed to bed. 

&#x200B;

A telephone call woke me up in the middle of the night. It was my mother. Being afraid that something horrible happened, as both of my parents weren’t that young anymore - I quickly grabbed my phone: “Yes, hello. What happened, Mom?”.

&#x200B;

“Jake, I want you to listen to me and please don’t interrupt before I finish…” - the voice in the speaker said. She sounded like she was drinking - her speech was slurring.

&#x200B;

“When we just got you… Me and your dad. We were young and foolish. We thought that we could do anything together and that we were ready to be a family. But… But that was hard. When I got you - it was really painful, Jake. We didn’t have money, and having a kid is a tough chore. We.. We lived in a rented apartment and barely could… find money to feed ourselves. I was depressed. I was not thinking straight back then. And you were crying all the time. It drove me mad… So one day…” - she stopped for a second and I heard sobbing.

&#x200B;

“…one day when your father went to work, I couldn’t bear it anymore. You were causing so much trouble. I just couldn’t. I…” - she continued - “I decided that you were a mistake, so I took the pillow… and… and…” - she went crying and weeping.

&#x200B;

“Jake, I killed your sister and wouldn’t stop there, if it wasn’t your father who forgot his wallet” - that phrase fired like a gunshot in a silence. 

&#x200B;

“I killed her with the very same pillow you showed me today. We never told anyone about it. Everybody thinks she just… Oh god… I don’t know if you would ever forgive me, Jake” - the weeping continued. 

&#x200B;

I just hanged up, sitting there in darkness of my own bedroom. Silent. As if something broke down within me. My own mother… I couldn’t believe it. No way. She was so caring and sweet for all the time that I’ve known her. Always treating me with love and care…

&#x200B;

Suddenly a phone buzzed and I checked it automatically with my thoughts still being somewhere far from this world. 

It was an email from my best friend. And the notification read: “Hey Jake, there’s something I need to tell you. Do you remember Becky? The…”.

&#x200B;

I don’t know what forced me to open it but the following message put the final blow to my  collapsing mind.

&#x200B;

“Do you remember Becky? The one you’ve dated when we were in the high school? Of course you do, you said she was the love of your life. I remember how devastated you were when she committed suicide. 

&#x200B;

Jake, truth is - she never did it. I did. I killed her and  set up everything to look like it was a suicide. Why? Because I was young and stupid. I couldn’t make her mine, as she was in love with you. I couldn’t understand what she found in you and why I was cast aside. So I killed her with my own two hands. That pendant you showed me - she was wearing it that day. Her pale still chest and a cheap heart pendant - this image is burned onto my eyelids, so I see it every time I close my eyes. I’m sorry, Jake. There’s nothing that could excuse me. I don’t hope you’ll understand. I just want to confess. I remember about my guilt every single day, and you…Showing at my door with exact same thing… I can’t take it anymore. I’m turning myself down. I’m sorry…“.

&#x200B;

That was too much. I snapped. I cried and rushed around like a wild animal, breaking stuff, hurting myself. But that didn’t matter. Some time after I was taken away by ambulance, accompanied by police, whom somebody from my neighbors called, as I believe I’ve thrown quite a freakish show back there. 

&#x200B;

I was released from hospital couple of days later and came back to my broken apartment. Swiped the glass, moped the floors. Left alone, broken and miserable.

&#x200B;

The box was still there on my desk with two secrets left. I have no intention of opening those. I think I will burn them. Ignorance is bliss. 

&#x200B;

But that was not the end. It seems that I did not just buy the box itself, but paid for subscription, as I got notification that the package awaits for me. I don’t know what I fear the most - reveal what’s inside, or live among the monsters without realizing it…

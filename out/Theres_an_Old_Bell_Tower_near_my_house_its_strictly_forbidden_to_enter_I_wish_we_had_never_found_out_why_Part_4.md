Part 4.

'Fuuuuck!' I screeched.

'Okay... everyone, up the stairs!'.

We all turned, stumbling over each other as we clamoured for the stairs leading up.

It was clear.

We sprinted up as fast as we could, I could see the stairway to the bells come into view as we approached the fifth floor landing.

The two rooms on either side of the stairs had closed doors. 

We could hear faint whimpering coming from one of the rooms, we couldn't tell which one... maybe it was both, I couldn't think straight.

The left door was where we found Liam lying in some sort of ritualistic manner, the right door... well, we had never seen what lay beyond the right door.

We took a minute to catch our breath.

Ash and Dennis seemed to recognise the whimpering as coming from Shawn, but like me, could not tell where it was coming from.

'We need to pick a room to try first' Brian said, 'we found Liam in that room before' he continued gesturing to the left door.

'There was something in that other one, we didn't go in there', I added.  

Dennis looked at both doors, 'why dont we just do two of us in each?' He asked, Ash glanced at us approvingly.

'No, we stay together, no splitting up ,"Dennis"' Brian cut in, using air quotes when he said the name Dennis.

'What the fuck is that supposed to mean?' Dennis snapped back sharply.

'You tell me, you're constantly trying to split us up, are you even who you say you are?' Brian stepped forward waving his knife.

'You're fucking paranoid Brian, put that knife away you look like...'

'Everyone shut up!!' I interrupted. 'We need to stick together, stop fighting, let's just try the left one first, and we all go!' I said as ushered Dennis and Ash in front of us.

I gave Brian a stern look, he wasn't too pleased.

'Come on Brian, we can do this man, just keep it together' I patted his back and we followed the others.

We slowly walked to the door, listening intently for any noises, either from inside or... anywhere really.

Ash pushed the door open.

Just like before, Shawn lay in almost exactly the same way Liam did 5 years ago, although he was awake, and he was weeping to himself.

Lying in matted tar like mud, surrounded by crystals and symbols, clothes torn and ragged with cuts and burns all over his body.

He never saw us come in.

Ash strode over to see Shawn.

'Shawn, its us man, you need to get up, we need to get out of here!' Ash said, patting his face.

'He's absolutely freezing!' Ash exclaimed, 'come on mate, time to get up!'.

Shawn still failed to recognise Ash's presence, or any of us for that matter, he just wept and mumbled to himself.

We staggered out to the landing with Shawn.

The whimpering from the other room was still audible.

'Sh-should we... check?' I asked reluctantly.

'I dont know man, we've got Shawn, we should just go' Brian replied.

'Yep, we do, but what about Liam? You never know!? What if he could be in there?'.

'Danny!' Brian started with a look of disapproval, 'okay, shout him then, don't go in, just shout his name'.

I put my ear to the door and could hear the whimpering of someone on the other side.

I hesitated. 

'Liam?' I called out.

Silence.

'Liam!' I called again, putting my ear to the door.

'Wh-who's there?, Who's there?, please, whoever's there p-please, h-help me'.

I took a step back in shock.

It was Liam's voice, but... was this another trick?

I looked at Brian, he was not happy to see me contemplating kicking this door in.

'I need to Brian' I said as I passed him my bag, 'we have to take any chance we get'. 

Brian shook his head.

I turned and kicked the door, the latch broke pretty easily, a thick wave of dust rushed from the dark room, the smell was putrid.

I saw a figure a few feet away.

'Danny?' He said.

He fell to his knees and began to cry. 'Danny' he sobbed.

He came closer to me, I was absolutely shocked at the sight of his emaciated face, his drawn in cheeks, eyes sunken into the sockets, his head looked little more that a skull, his dark cavernous mouth bore little to no teeth and was rounded by cracked lips, blackened by old dried blood.

His body looked frail and skeletal, covered in cuts and bruises, his clothes were almost non existent.

He crawled over to me, I sat on the ground before him.

'Liam, I'm so sorry man, we can get you out of here now, we can get you home'. I told him, hoping I could lift any part of his spirits.

Liam came closer still, and eventually fell over my lap, I was holding him almost like a baby.

'You left me here' he said, struggling to get a breath.
'You and Brian left me here, why did you leave me here?'.

My eyes welled, I hated myself, looking at him like this made me feel a hundred times worse.

'Danny!' I heard Brian call to me, 'leave him, we need to go', his voice was straight to the point and serious.

I couldn't see what Brian was seeing, but I didn't have to.

I already knew.

I already knew it wasn't Liam.

...but seeing him in this state made me think about what really happened to him, was this how he ended up? I truly think we were being shown what became of Liam.

I cried as his limp body lay across my lap, struggling to breathe, struggling to stay alive.

Is this what his last moments were like?

I thought about his family, how hard it's been for them, losing their Son, suspicion constantly drawn on them, dealing with daily accusations about his disappearance when we know they had nothing to do with it.

Liam coughed and spluttered, some horrible black saliva landed on my arm.

I looked into his yellow eyes. 

I knew it wasn't him.

'Danny, we need to go.... like now!' Brian called again, more urgency in his tone.

I put my knife to Liam's throat.

'I'm sorry' I sobbed.

He looked shocked and scared, but I wasn't being fooled this time.

I slid the knife with ease into his throat, all the way until it came out the back.

No blood spilled.

I threw his body off of me but the knife was stuck.... my.... my hand was stuck.

I tried to pull at it but it wouldn't budge, purple and black veins twisted out from the wound, snaked up the blade and onto the handle, around my hand and twisted all the way up to my shoulder, binding me with so much strength I lost the feeling in my arm.

Liam's body went into convulsions, his bones snapped and his limbs contorted, his head fell further back as his neck elongated pulling the knife and my arm with it, two burning hands on the end of impossibly long arms grabbed my face.

I had let myself get caught, if I wasn't so terrified I would be be asking myself, how I could be so stupid!.

There was no chance I was getting away this time.

'Danny!!' I heard Brian scream.

'Just run!' I told them. 'Just... run!' I felt like I had given up any hope.

I felt the energy completely drain from my body, my eyes began rolling back.

All I could see in a haze of grey mist was a grinning face with chiseled sharp features and glowing yellow eyes, a face of coal, of smouldering ash.

I couldn't help but think, this is probably the end for me.

I could hear the bells, I could feel the wind on my face. 

There was nothing I could do.

My body was paralyzed.

The face got closer to me, the bells rang louder.

The hot, arid, sulfuric stench of the beast's breath filled my lungs, I choked, I couldn't breathe.

This was it, I had let myself linger too long and I was caught.

The creature jolted.

A terribly painful shock ran through my body like a bolt of lightning.

The startled face twisted in ways I couldn't even imagine being possible, I was mesmerised by the control this thing had over every part of itself.

I could see the yellow eyes grow brighter, the beast looked into the distance.

An bright orange glow came from above me, getting progressively bigger and brighter, like a sunrise over a clear sky, gradually coming more into view.

A huge chaotic ball of fire seemed to burn right before me, continuous, never faltering.

Was this... some kind of message from beyond? what was this? 

The beast recoiled in fear, and what seemed like pain, I could feel my life draining from me as it latched onto my body with everything it had.

Slowly the burning on my arms and legs began to ease, my body regained mobility, I could feel again.

My senses had started to process my surroundings more efficiently and I was able to understand what was happening. 

The bells had stopped, the wind had stopped, the pain, the confusion, the feeling of being drained on my very soul, it had all stopped in an instant as I was able to sit up and see Brian standing in front of me with a can of hairspray and a lighter in his hands.

He looked at me, by the expression on his face I could tell I must have been in a bit of a bad state.

Brian offered his hand, I lifted my arm to take it, pain shot through my whole body.

Brian helped me up to my feet and I noticed we were at the bells.

'How did I get up here?' I asked, I had no idea how long ago I had blacked out or how I ended up at the bells.

'I dont know, we got thrown from the room and the door slammed shut, all we could hear was you screaming, then everything went quiet' Brian explained. 'A few minutes later the bells were chiming and I thought we should at least look, when I got up the stairs you looked like you were having a seizure and that thing was right in your face'.

'Thanks, thanks for not giving up on me!' I said, even talking was accompanied by great pain.

I looked around, 'where's everyone else?'.

'They're downstairs, they didn't want to go any higher' Brian replied, sounding disappointed.

'Liam's not coming back is he?' My head hung in shame as I spoke.

'I don't think so Danny, we just need to make sure we all get out of here now, we tried our best, now we need to stay alive'. Brian put his arm around me to help me walk, although I felt okay to walk myself, I was grateful for the hand.

I could see Dennis, Ash and Shawn at the bottom of the stairs, staring up with horrified looks on their faces.

'You okay?' Ash called up.

'I'll be fine' I answered, taking my time on the steps.

We got to the fifth landing and we were all reunited.

'Let's get out of here before any other shit happens' Shawn exclaimed.  

If only that was his thinking earlier. 

We began our descent, fourth floor, third floor, second floor...

We started on the steps to take the ladder to the first floor.

'Psst!' 

My ears pricked up.

I looked around.

'Pssst!'

I looked up.

Something was falling slowly, dancing and swooshing in the air as it fell.

It looked like a small square piece of paper.

It landed right at my feet.

It was....

A polaroid.

With trembling hands I picked it up and flipped it round.

The look of fear was clearly evident on my face as everybody looked worried.

'What is it?' Dennis asked, I narrowed my eyes and looked at him with suspicion.

I turned the photo to show the others.

It was a polaroid of Dennis, like he had taken a selfie. 

His black toothy grin and yellow serpentine eyes sent a shiver down my spine as in the background I could see, Shawn, Ash and Brian watching me kicking a door.

The door on the fifth floor where Liam was.

Brian immediately held his knife to Dennis' neck.

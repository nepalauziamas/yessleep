I am the founder of the secret project "Cancer". This project is trying to find a cancer drug. Doctors have today manufactured a drug that is supposed to save children sick from this disease. We're going to have to find cancer volunteers to do tests. It will take some time because not many people trust us. 

Day 1 
I found a volunteer. He is 18 years old and I gave him the medicine. Name: classified. The subject showed no adverse effects. At the moment the doctors put him under observation. 

Day 2 
The skin of the subject began to pale. The subject seems very dissatisfied with his new appearance. Also, the subject began to have dizziness and severe stomach pain.

Day 5
 The subject began to show signs of dementia: he killed a caretaker who was in charge of caring for the subject. The caretaker suffered a lethal bite in the right side of his neck. The subject began to scratch the walls of the room with a piece of stone and began to lose his appetite. The rest of the day he sat in a corner of the room saying,"I didn't want to. I didn't want to. It was worth it. Kill. Kill!". 

Day 13
 The subject's eyes began to turn into total black. Normally this should not have happened according to the researchers. The hair from his head began to lose its color, although the subject is only 18 years old.
 
Day 28 
I am  running out of funds. The company we work with refuses to lend us any more money for appliances, improvements and other things because it does not notice any progress. I spent a lot of time thinking about what to do, but I decided to use my funds. Anyway, even if I try to stop the project I could not because the serum is going to advance to the final state. If I stopped the project, surely one of the employees would tell the police what was going on... so there is no going back.

Day 34
In this morning, a doctor came to examinate the subject. He sayed that it was ok. But when the doctor approached the subject, it began to bite the doctor's face. After he ate a part of the face, he began to hit the cadaver. It didn't stop until a big bloody puddle was covering the dead body. After that he began to eat the eat what was left from the body.

Day 45
We made tests on the subject, because he isn't able to eat. We tried to give him cooked meat. He threw it on the wall and looked desgussted. After that, I thought that we might give him raw meat. The subject ate it with pleasure.

Day 50
The subject didn't sleep for 5 days. He starred  at the door, waiting. It is very important to avoid eye contact with the subject. If you don't, the subject will think that you are confronting them, so it will attack you.

Day 60
The subject escaped. He freed himself when he was taken to the shower room. His power is over the limits. He killed the group of security guards. He left alive only one guard that was spitted by the subject. He was isolated in the quarantine. The next day he started to have the same adverse effects. 

Day 80
The infected guard looked like the 0253 subject. The second subject infected security guards and researchers. Number of infections: classified.

Day 89
The power of the subjects is growing very fast, but they look very weak. Their bones can be seen through the skin. They look like aliens: their pulse is lower than 50bpm, they reached over 256 kilogrammes, even if they are very weak. They can stay awake for days without eating anything sometimes. The infected members of the organisation will be closed into the 0253 subject's cell. 

Day 100
After a lot of days hitting in the door's cell, they escaped. I don't know how, but they escaped. I ran as fast as I could to the security room. I made it in time to be able to lock the door. I could see on the security cameras that all the other subjects are running through the exit. All of them, except one: subject 0253. 

Day 110
The subject seems very calm. He doesn't look like he wants to enter the security room. I don't know what he is up to. I will keep examining him. I don't know if it's ok to sleep, because I still have a paranoic thought that he might enter the room at night and kill me. I am very lonely. I just destroyed the world with my own creation...


Day 120
 The subject sits outside the emergency room. It stays there since day 100. Without moving, without drinking, without sleeping. He could enter without a lot of effort. But no. He isn't that stupid. He wants to get revenge for the 100 days he was staying in that cell. He's playing with me. I'm stuck here.

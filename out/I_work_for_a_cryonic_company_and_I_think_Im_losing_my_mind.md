It was supposed to be easy. Go to uni, study STEM, get rich. Only three years later, a mountain of debt, and a specialisation in a niche field, meant I was stuck working back of house in my pizza shop again. At a recruitment fair, I came across a pretty nondescript leaflet advertising junior lab positions at a company specialising in 'life suspension technologies'. It wasn't my area, but I was desperate to get away from cheese, dough and children, so I sent across my CV, took the interview, and three weeks later, I was moving halfway across the country to start my new job as a junior researcher. Pay was pretty good, and the relocation fee got me out of Swindon, which, if you've ever been to Swindon, you know is worth its weight in gold.

You've probably heard of cryonics before. You know, the frozen rich people thing. You're probably thinking about Walt Disney. Like you, I'd assumed that life suspension technology was only for the uber wealthy, until I saw the row after row of tiny stainless steel vesicles stacked up in the warehouse during my induction tour.

"Oh, we call this the salon," my guide told me as we wandered down the echoing room.

It was just him and I, and the quiet fuzz of the fluorescent lights above. He explained that while full body cryonics were costly, head only cryonics was quite reasonable. No sooner had his words left his lips, I realised I was stood in a warehouse filled with thousands of decapitated heads staring down at me, suspended in frozen animation.

"You're going to be in here," my guide said, holding open a heavy door for me.

It was a small lab, barely bigger than a broom cupboard. "By myself?" I asked him.

He chuckled, and pointed to the camera in the corner, the red light staring back at me. "Don't worry, we keep an eye on everyone to make sure you're all right and safe in case of any accidents. There's a binder in the filing cabinet. You'll find your lab protocols in there. Lunch is at 12!"

And he shut the door, leaving me alone with the camera. Overwhelmed, unnerved, stressed out. I wasn't sure if this was typical for industry. Would I be another whiny new starter if I complained? If I just walked out the door, would I have to repay the relocation fee?

I'm here now, I told myself, and I remember just drifting over to the cabinet and pulling out the binder, just telling myself to get on with it. At least do one day.

The protocol was...weird. No other way to explain it. Here's a copy of the welcome sheet, redactions my own for safety.

*Welcome to \[redacted\]. Your journey with life suspension begins today. As a junior researcher, you will be at the forefront of cutting edge science, part of a global team in search for the ultimate answer, curing death. Here at \[redacted\] we provide our employees with a generous benefits package and unparalleled career development opportunities. In return, all we ask is faith in the protocols we provide. Do not question the protocol. Follow them to the letter. Do not deviate. Deviation will result in termination. Do not deviate.*

Again, that should have been my cue to get up and walk through the door. But up to now, I'd only used lab protocols from university. Maybe industry was different. Perhaps they just wanted to guard whatever proprietary knowledge they had.

The assays were simple enough at first, and despite the cramp quarters, I found all equipment had been meticulously organised into the various drawers for me. Starting off with serial dilutions. Fine. Calibrating a chromatography machine? Easy peasy, done it a hundred times. Tissue sampling? Wait, what?I flicked through the binder, finding 'tissue sampling' via the appendix.

*In order to offset the costs of cryogenic storage, some of our customers sign waivers for us to experiment on their frozen tissue, allowing us to push forward the bleeding edge of our technology.*

That can't be right, can it? You pay essentially a second mortgage to get your head chopped off and frozen, and they still get to experiment with your frozen brain?

I was so confused that I convinced myself I had misunderstood. So I carried on, not wanting to fall behind already.

There was an access panel in the side of the wall opposite me, with a touch screen next to it. Per the protocol, I entered today's sample ID. There was a mechanical whirring from behind the wall, followed by a soft bell chime. The panel opened, and delivered right to my desk was one of the shiny chrome cannisters I'd seen only hours earlier. I hadn't been wrong.

I flicked forward in the binder.

*Unlock the cryogenic flask and insert the temperature probe located in draw #33. Using the craniotome, drill into the subjects scalp using the template provided in draw #217. Place electrical probes alpha-mu into the twelve boreholes created, feeding them through the vat port holes. Return flask to locked position, and connect probes to computer interface. Execute program LZS.exe. Monitor temperature probe.*

My heart was pounding. Drillings skulls? Surely, surely that was beyond the expectation of a graduate? My hands were shaking on the desk.

"PROTOCOL DEVIATION."

The voice filled the room, loud, authoritative. I think I yelped in shock.

"EMPLOYEE #321, BENCHTOP STABILITY OF SAMPLE IS PARAMOUNT. CONTINUE PROTOCOL."

It was coming from a small speaker behind the CCTV. Fuck me, they really were monitoring me. Extremely conscious they were now actively monitoring me, I followed the next steps, breaking them down into their constituent parts. Thanks to whatever deity is out there, the liquid and the vat were dark enough to not highlight anything beyond a wrinkled, bald scalp. Opening the vat triggered a mechanism which raised the surface of the scalp barely above the cryonic fluid. I could feel the chill radiating from the sample...from the head. Lowering the acetate template, I marked the locations for the bore holes and picked up the steel drill. Glancing once at the CCTV and the ever present red light, I pulled the trigger.

The sound was horrendous. Grating, grinding. Squeaky. I felt it in the vibrations in the drill, and it hit me right in the navel. I had to fight down, throwing up this morning's breakfast right there into the vat. As bad as the sound was, the smell was worse. Aerosolised bone dust filled the tiny room. I tried to hold my breath to not breathe it in, but it was impossible. I set my attention, and just drilled the 12 holes as quick as possible. Holes created, I sunk the probes in, my gorge fighting against the stiff, yet relenting resistance the small metal probes felt as I sank them into vitrified brain tissue.  I shut the flask, and connected the probes to the laptop, sweating and shaking. Didn't even bother cleaning up the drill, which still had shards of bone stuck to it.

The wash of blue light from the screen lit the room, and I found a single shortcut 'LZS.exe.' I double clicked, and up popped a simple black UI.

*Probes connected. Verifying. Verification complete. Connecting to server. Brain activity...3%. Cryo temp...-150 c*

My eyes froze on that line. 3%? But before I could stop to consider it, the software UI flashed, a strange pattern appearing in cold white lines, filling the screen for no more than a blink of an eye, fast enough that I could have imagined it. The simple UI reappeared.

*Code flashed. Fluid temperature...-73 Celsius. Brain activity...47%*

This can't be. The vat next to me began to hiss.

*Brain activity...64%. Fluid temperature...-20 Celsius*

White gas was steaming from the vat as the cryogenic fluid hit boiling point.

*Brain activity...64%. Fluid temperature...+4 degrees. Activity halted. Bolus oxygen in 3..2..1*

The flask screamed. A distinctly human, scream. The kind of scream that sounded like a head, trapped within a chrome flask. It screamed like a balloon letting out air, loud at first until it grew quieter and quieter, falling again into silence.

*Response recorded. EEG data stored. Time of second death: 11:13 am. Experiment number #4321 complete. Sample to be discarded via incineration. Return to protocol.*

I've been here half a year. I can't even count anymore how many screams I've heard. I wish they were the worst of it. They're not. The worst is when the screams turn to barely heard words. And they always say the same thing.

'Don't send me back'.

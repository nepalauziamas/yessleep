Well, I don't know, if you can read this from where you are or not, but if so, you deserve to know the truth. To know what happened to me and to you.

A few years ago I met this random guy in front of a store. He was smiling friendly when he nudged my arm and asked me for the adress of one of his friends. His name was David and he began to entangle me in a conversation. After we just talked a few minutes it felt like he would know me better than my actual brother. It was a nice dialogue even if I don't remember anything we talked about.

Me and David met each other very often since then. A friendship began and started to grow. We had long and deep conversations, we got drunk together, we went on roadtrips and did nearly everything friends can do. Someday I would even call him my best friend. 

I remember the day the shit went weird. Me and my best friend went through the streets - already kinda drunk. "Yo, David. Le's ge in here. 'ust one last drink!" I babbled. David just stood there and looked at me and I saw how hard it was for his brain to work in spite of the -not very low- amount of liquor we had. "Ye" was all he said after like 5 seconds of thinking. As we lurched in, the inkeeper instantly wanted to throw us out without serving us anything. But David grabbed his arm instead, stared him into his eyes for a few seconds and whispered something to his ears. I didn't understand anything and I was too drunk to care about it. But then, as my friend didn't stop whispering to the inkeeper, he started crying and broke down on the floor of his own pub. David turned his head to me and his facial expression looked like he wanted me to get in. "Wha-... What was that?" I asked instead. He didn't seem to care anymore about the crying man to his feet like it was normal for him. "Dude, wha the fuck?" I repeated and my friend noticed I wouldn't go on without a answer.

"Ugh..." he took a annoyed breath and came back to me. "Look, I have this special ability. I know things, I shouldn't know" he said and took my hand. As he than stared into my eyes, he repeated my exact thoughts. "The hell is going on here? David's making fun of me, isn't he? Is it - yeah, it's my phone in my pocket. Wait, didn't we change our phones? So it has to be David's phone, not mine, right?"

So I deceided to test him. David kept on saying "My phone's code is 5778 and I am a dork who wants to eat shit." I couldn't hold back a big laughing after the last sentence. But it was what I was thinking of. "How is that possible?" I asked and felt way more sober than I did one minute ago. "It souldn't be possible at all!" "I don't know but I can do this since I remember. I can see all your secrets and memories, but don't worry. I won't damage you, my friend." I couldn't answer anything, so I just stood there trying to belive what I just experienced. "You know what? I want to try something. Stay still and close your eyes" David said.

The next thing I remember is waking up on the ground in front of the pub. The inkeeper still lied on the floor but stoped crying meanwhile. Angryly he stared at me and shout "What the hell are you? Get the fuck away, Jesus Christ! Do your weird shit somewhere else!" I looked around irritated - looking for David but not giving much attention to the inkeeper. "David?!" I couldn't see him. "Who?" the inkeeper replied "Are there more guys like you coming? Please, God, don't. Please just leave! I don't want any trouble with you or others like you. Please go!"

"I'm here - but this is not what was supposed to happen" I heard David... but his voice came from the inside... the inside of my head! "David?! How the - How did you get in there? Get out of my head, now!" "I can't. At least I don't know how I should be able to. I never wanted to get in here like that!"

Since this day, David lives in my head and I share his ability to look inside others minds when I touch them. Also it seems like David got erased out of time. There is no evidence that he existed ever. No one remembers him, no contact im my phone or social media. Nothing! 

Some day, I just randomly met you on the streets and you were as beautiful as I never saw any woman before. I started talking to you and nudged your arm. I used my knowledge of your mind to get closer to you. You know, we started dating but the last one... I just fucked it up. You leaned forward and so did I. Suddenly, at the moment our lips touched each other, I saw a big, hidden dark place in your mind. I didn't think of the possibility of a suppressed trauma or anything like that. I sent David to have a look on it and he instantly explored it. Then I heard him screaming. A shocked, cold scream out of pure fear. One moment later, you screamed just like David did. You started crying and ran away. I didn't know what happened. David doesn't want to tell me what he saw but I know what you did. I don't know how you ran that fast to the rails or why you did this... but I know you did. I want to say sorry. I didn't ever want this to happen.

I'll leave this letter on your grave. I hope you can read it from where you are. Maybe you don't have to wait a long time for me to follow you. I kinda hope so, to be honest

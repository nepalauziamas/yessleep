Don’t you remember what it feels like to be young? You’ve got to. Somewhere. Somehow. Try to imagine it. That beat in your chest that slips down to your stomach like butterflies and stress mixing together and rolling over to do happy little cartwheels through your insides? I want to feel that way forever. I want to suck it all up and bottle it somewhere before I get old. You know? I just don’t have that much time left. 

*That’s not true.*

Really? The only event after prom is graduation, if that even happens, and then it’s gone forever. Just like me. Another town. Another place. I just want to live this life while it lasts. I want to feel seventeen while I am seventeen. You know? 

*This life doesn’t end after high school, hon.*

But this feeling might. I know you felt it once, before Mom died, before you got old. I found your old yearbook on grandma’s bookshelf. You were handsome. Long hair, dark glasses, big smile. Lots of signatures from lots of girls. What happened to that guy? Is he dead, or do you just keep him locked up, like you do with me these days?

*That’s not fair.*

No. None of this is fair.

*Things were different then.*

What? You mean you didn’t live in a freak town with a freak monster running about kidnapping freak kids?

*Honey…*

No, Dad. Really. I want to know the cost of what I’m missing here. The price for our supposed safety. Be honest with me. Will there ever be anything in my life just like prom again?

*I didn’t say you couldn’t go.*

No. You just want to chaperone and creep from the bushes so hard that my date will think you’re going to gut him like that missing girl got gutted…

*Katie… Jesus…*

What does he have to do with anything? 

*Janelle.*

Huh?

*Her name is Janelle.*

Are you seriously recording this right now? You’re secretly recording your own daughter on her prom night? That’s fucked, Dad, even for you. 

*No. Yes. I don’t know. I guess I left it on. I’m sorry, honey, I’m going to finish getting ready.*

Wait. Dad. 

*Hm?*

Can you zip me?

*Sure.*

----

I wish we never even moved here.

*Me too.*

Like, really. Mom never would have allowed it. 

*You’re probably right about that.*

The rain never stops. 

*It does sometimes.*

The cold is awful. 

*So, you wear a jacket.*

The people here don’t even drive like the people back home.

*What do you mean?*

I mean, look at them. The way they stare at you. Who does that? Look. Look! Look at that one lady! Her eyes aren’t even on the road. Why is she staring at us? Dad, that’s so creepy…

*I don’t know, honey.*

I wish this rain would stop. 

*I know.*

It’s going to ruin my dress. 

*I’ll carry you in if we have to.*

You’re sweet. 

*Your date is meeting us?*

He is. 

*Hm.*

What?

*In my day…*

Yeah, I know.

*It just seems strange for you to walk in alone. Especially with everything going on in this town. We could have picked him up too.*

Dad? Can I ask you something? 

*Yeah?*

What does He look like? 

*Your date?*

No. You know who. Him. 

*I don’t know who.*

You said you saw Him at Sammy’s house. Waiting in the dining room. Watching. Listening to everything you talked about. 

*Only a shadow.*

A shadow that moved. 

*I don’t want to talk about it…*

I need to know.

*Why?*

Because it affects me too. 

*Fine. I’ll be honest with you. You’re old enough for it.*

Damn right. 

*I think… I think if what I saw is really what I saw…*

Yeah, yeah. 

*That’s a major ‘if’. It was dark in that house.*

Spit it out. 

*If what I saw is really what I saw… those kids are in a lot of trouble.*

And we’re going to prom. 

*And we’re going to prom.*

Thank you. 

*Can’t be too bad. Look at all these people.*

Park by the entrance.

*Whoa. This place is packed. The traffic alone. How many kids go to your school?*

I love you, Dad. 

*Alright. Hold up. Promise me you will be safe.*

I promise. 

*Promise me that you know where to meet me.*

I promise.

*Promise that you will text every five minutes.*

Ten?

*Five. Promise that you know I love you.*

I promise. I love you. Bye, Dad.

**Text from Katie. 7:58.**

Made it inside. Thanks again Dad.

**Notes. 8:00.**

A melancholy song plays on the radio. Rhythm gives way to static. Rain patters against the glass in slow harmony. A loud knock on the window shakes my focus. A jock in a white tuxedo pulls up by the passenger side. He attempts to open my door and finds it locked. He stops. He smiles. Are you here to see Him, he asks?

*Who?*

Don’t play games. You know Him! You’ve seen Him. He has seen you. Don’t interfere. I’ll be back. 

*Can you tell me what that means?* I shout to the now retreating stranger in the parking lot. *Can you please tell me what in the fuck that even means?*

—

**Text to Katie. 8:02.**

We need to go. I’m sorry. Something is happening.

**Text to Katie. 8:03.**

Let’s go. Now.

**Notes. 8:08.**

Static fades as the local college radio station’s signal overtakes it with Straylight Run. My mind runs through the probability of finding my daughter versus her finding me. I settle on the latter. Wind howls and pulls at the signs in the parking lot. I stare at my phone, waiting desperately for a reply that never comes. A peripheral shape rips away my attention.

*Fuck. What the fuck.*

Standing in front of the headlights is Janelle Petersen. She is a sight to behold, beyond the obvious. Her clothes are ripped and tattered. Her nose is bleeding and her teeth are cracked or missing. When she speaks, a bit of blood dribbles down her chin, and she coughs to let out even more. She says something that isn’t caught by the dash audio.

He’s angry. 

People spill out of the gymnasium like ants fleeing a stomping toddler. A teacher falls in the distance and is quickly trampled by a horde of desperate teenagers. My car doors open. Janelle is in the back seat. Katie in the front. Drive, my daughter screams, and shakes me for good measure to break through the shock. I lock the doors. I hit the gas. The acceleration lurches us towards the fleeing mob.

*Somebody please talk to me.*

He’s angry, Janelle whines.

I want to go home, Katie cries.

We peel out of the parking lot through a maze of panicked bodies and disembodied screams. A few strangers slap at the van. A few others try to block us. They all want a ride, you see, but stopping for one of them means stopping for a dozen, and we don’t have the space or the time. We are a life raft in the middle of the ocean. We just can’t see the shark yet. 

*What are they running from?*

I have my answer in seconds. A piece of concrete falls from the top of the school. A school bus, two spots down, is crushed. The entire building shifts and whines. We hang a close right turn by the entrance to the gymnasium when something long, slender, and white flies out of the propped doors and into a parked car. 

*Is that an arm?*

He just wants to go home, too, Janelle whispers. But he can't go home. Not until he has more. He needs more. Always more. More, more, more. 

*More what, Janelle? More what? More time?*

More bodies. 

We hit the main road and bang a fender on the uneven concrete. I floor it once we straighten out. The screams die out in moments. The adrenaline slows soon after. The street grows quiet and dark. The rain stops. I readjust my rear view and catch a glimpse of fire in the distance. The car stays quiet for a while. 

Then the road starts to crack.

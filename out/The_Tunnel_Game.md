The Tunnel Game is one of the most dangerous games in the world. It’s rewards are limitless but losing the game gives you a predicament worse than death itself. The game is most commonly played in underground tunnels, such as sewers or subway stations but some requirements still need to be met.

**Requirements**

* A Tunnel System (The specifics are discussed in the next section)
* Flashlight. It shouldn’t be too bright as this could impact the game but it also shouldn’t be too dim
* A container of mint leaves (at least 500 grams)

**Choosing The Right Tunnels**

The best possible location for the game needs to be chosen or the game won’t work and your time will be wasted. Ideally, you would want to find a tunnel system that’s been abandoned but a place that doesn’t have people inside works well. A brightly lit busy tunnel system like a main subway system is not a suitable location for the game. It will take some time to find the right tunnel system, but don’t rush the search as the suitability of your location may impact how your game goes.

Some other basic requirements that the tunnel system should meet:

* It should be large. Old sewerage systems work well for this but abandoned railway systems are ideal
* It should be underground.
* Avoid mines. They are not worth the trouble they will give you
* Make sure it does not have any working lights. This will help avoid confusion later in the game.

There’s quite a lot of criteria to meet when searching for potential tunnel systems, so expect to travel far if you want the best location possible.

**Mental Preparation**

The Tunnel Game is hard and dangerous. You need to have a really good reason to play because going into the game otherwise is a stupid choice. If you’re just looking for a thrill, look somewhere else. Only a strong passion or desire can get one through this game and still the success chances and incredibly low.

Any player who wins the tunnel game, gets to make one wish. A wish without limits that will be granted as soon as you leave the tunnel system. This is why its always reccommended that you have a strong desire for something before you play the game and keep that in your mind throughout the progress of the game.

Now moving on to expectations for the game. The game will be an extremely traumatising experience that could potentially scar you forever. Expect to face extreme danger and your worst fears before you play this game as that is exactly what will lurk at the edge of the beam of light your torch emits.

Make sure you are well versed in the layout of your tunnel system and know exactly where you are at all times. During the games, the tunnels may change and warp around you. Prepare yourself by studying a map of the tunnel system beforehand and bringing a compass. It will help you for as long as it keeps working.

**Physical Preparation**

If you start to lose your breath after jogging for two seconds, it’s highly reccommended to pass this game. You might be chased, you might be thrown. The tunnel might suddenly get really cold, or really hot. You need to be able to survive, so if camping in the backyard gets you worked up, you simply won’t be able to survive.

Bring first aid and know how to treat common injuries. It’ll help you heaps in the game.

**You’ve met all the criteria and you are now in front of the tunnel ready to play**

If you made it this far into the guide without wanting to turn back and click on something else, I commend you.

You’ve probably found your tunnel now and you’ve got all your supplies together. Hopefully double and triple checked that you’ve brought those mint leaves.

Now you’re standing in front of the entrance. Does it lead to a subway that hasn’t seen movement for 50 years? or is it some old drainage system that has been long abandoned by time itself? In both scenarios as you walk down into the underground tunnels, you’ll see the same things.

Shadows lingering at the edge of the beam your flashlight creates and the thick darkness failing to betray the true end of the tunnel.

Begin to throw single mint leaves behind you every couple of steps. This is to ensure that you keep tracking your path. Yes, I hear you, you’ve studied your map extensively and even brought a small copy with you. The compass in your pocket is also going to help you direct yourself but trust me when I saw this. The moment the true game starts, the map will suddenly be wrong, tunnels will not appear where they should have been and you will find yourself in a system that ridicules the supposedly accurate map you brought.

That’s where the mint leaves come in. Why mint? Nothing else seems to stay. The tunnels will change behind you and any other marker you leave won’t remain where you left it but for some reason mint leaves are immovable

So you keep walking down this tunnel, throwing a mint leaf behind you every few steps and getting used to the eeriness of it all. It isn’t so bad now that you’ve been walking for quite some time. Your eyes have adjusted to the dark and random shadows don’t make you jump anymore.

The game will make you relax like this. It’ll make you feel like you are safe, comfortable even and then all of a sudden it will punch you in the face.

You’ll soon pass through what feels like a wall of cold. The tunnel will suddenly go from room temperature to freezing cold. The smart player would have brought in some sort of jacket. Wear it now.

Before you continue though stop. Look behind you at the trail of mint leaves. This is your final chance to leave the game and if you decide to continue beyond this, you will cross a point of no return.

Let’s say you keep walking. Whatever desire it is that you wish to seek by playing this game, it overpowers you and keeps you moving. Now the game will truly begin to play with your mind.

You’ll start to hear whispers. They won’t make any sense and the moment you pause and notice them they’ll go away. They’ll go away only to come back again when you forget about them and start walking. You’ll begin to wonder if you’re hallucinating and in this vulnerable state, the shadows around you will start to move. You’ll see quick jerky movements at the edges of your flashlight only to erratically move it to try and follow the source but to find nothing.

This won’t happen all at once or in a short period of time. It’ll happen slowly. Bit by bit the intensity will ramp up and then completely stop. Then it’ll start again. The game is attempting to weaken you, to make you crack so you can start running back and when you do, it’ll consume you. The only way out is to keep walking and push against it.

The cold will disappear and the tunnel will start to get hot. You’ll find yourself taking your jacket off. The whispers and the shadows will go away but the heat will continue to increase degree by degree. It will begin to get very hot to the point where sweat if dripping down your face and even then as you keep on walking, the temperature will increase. Your body will begin to feel like its melting.

Drink as much water as you can and keep walking.

The heat will soon stop, and it’ll get comfortably cold again once you walk into the room. You won’t notice you’ve walked into the room until the temperature changes. At this point, it’s still pitch black and the flashlight is your only guide. Do not spend too long in the room. You may see things that tempt you to stay but you must move on. Don’t believe in anything you see in the room, it is all a facade created to distract you.

Keep walking in a straight line and you’ll see a hallway on the opposite side. Walk into the hallway.

If you made it this far, you’re most likely mentally and physically exhausted. Even those who make it to this point quickly fail soon after because all the fight and drive that was left in them is depleted. Let’s just say you’re still feeling alright and you’re determined to make it to the end of the game. Not that you have any other choice at this point really.

Keep walking and you’ll notice the hallway begin to get narrower and shorter. It’ll take some time for it to hit you, but when it does you’ll be crouching. At the same time, you’ll feel something breathing down your neck and hear footsteps behind you. Slow steady and repetitive, increasing ever so slightly in speed.

Move as quickly as you can through this cramped hallway before the footsteps catch up to you. The hallway will continue to get tighter and tighter until it feels like its molded to you body. Use your hands feet and legs, whatever it takes, to keep moving as fast as you can before the steps catch up to you. It’s best you turn off your flashlight to avoid confusion at this point.

As you keep squeezing, you’ll notice to your left or right, a vast open doorway. Your mind and the utter claustrophobic pressure on your body will urge you to enter the doorway. Many report seeing lights and other indicators that the space beyond the doorway is out in the open and freeing.

This is where many fail. They forever trap themselves in the tunnel game.

Ignore it all. Close your eyes if you have to, and keep on moving. You’ll have to start holding your breath to fit into the tunnel now. Move fast enough and you won’t have to do it any longer.

The hallway will then open up again and you’ll be allowed to breathe. The footsteps and presence behind you will vanish. Don’t stop here too long or something will grab you from behind.

You’ll finally walk into a vast open room with a brightly burning entity in the center. Do not look directly at it. The urge to look will overpower your body but you must keep your head down. Hold you head in place with your hands if you have to.

It will ask you to make your wish.

Speak loudly and clearly whatever it is that you want and it shall be granted.

In a split second, you’ll feel yourself disintegrating painlessly only to find yourself in front of the entrance to whatever place you chose again. The only reminder of your visit that’s left will be the mint leaves, which will begin to burn away as soon as you turn around and walk out.

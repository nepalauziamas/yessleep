It’s currently 2:30am. I’m hiding in my room, door barricaded, waiting for sunrise. I’m posting here for posterity’s sake, if somehow I go missing. 

To preface this, I live in a small town here in southern Louisiana. My town is somewhat known for ghost stories, but a lot of towns down here are. So I’m pretty comfortable with the idea of ghosts but never had the pleasure of experiencing a haunting.

I moved into this apartment with two friends from college. It’s a 3 bedroom. One bedroom downstairs and two upstairs. My male roommate and I live upstairs and our female roommate lives in the room downstairs. We’ve been here for two years and there haven’t been any issues at all, until tonight.

I adopted my cat a few months ago. My sister in law’s mother had her cat give birth to a healthy litter and I was dying to take a kitten home. After about 3 months with his mother, he came home with us. He’s very hyper and gets into a lot of trouble but he’s equally just as loving.

He has taken a special liking to my female roommate. He’s always wanting to sit in her lap or follow her around to the point where you’d think she was his mother. She doesn’t mind at all and welcomes the love he has to give.

That being said, she likes to shout up the stairs when my cat is being bothersome. He’s still a kitten and is in constant need of attention. He loves her a lot so when her door is closed, he is constantly scratching on it. She doesn’t like him in her room because he chews her wires, so I told her to just holler for me when he’s being obnoxious and I’d come get him. 

Not even 30 minutes ago, Im woken up by her voice. She’s whispering up the stairs so as to not wake our other roommate. “Hey, come get your cat”.
I’m a super light sleeper so even a whisper like that can wake me.

My cat normally doesn’t bother her late into the evening like this. I leave my door open for him throughout the night and he usually comes up to sleep in the bed with me. I thought that maybe he was just having a rowdy night and woke her up by scratching on her door.

I got up and fumbled through the dark into the hallway but stopped in my tracks before going downstairs. 

Both of my roommates are gone. My male roommate is at his father’s house over an hour away and my female roommate is out of town for a wedding.

I kind of brushed it off, thinking I dreamed it. I turned back to go to my room and this time her voice was loud and clear. “Hey, come get your cat”. 

I called for my cat in a panic but he didn’t come. He always comes. I went back into my room, barricaded the door, now here I am. 

If anyone knows what this thing is and how I can get rid of it, please share. This doesn’t feel like a harmless ghost. I’ve never heard of a ghost being able to impersonate someone so flawlessly. No, this feels much more malicious, like Im being hunted in my own home. I’m scared out of my mind and I’m worried that whatever is down there is going to hurt my cat, but I’m not going down there until the sun comes up.

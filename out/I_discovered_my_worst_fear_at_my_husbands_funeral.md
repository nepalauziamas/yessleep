“Mum, Joey won’t let me have my doll back!”

“Joey be nice to your sister.” I replied half-heartedly, struggling to contain the niggling irritation I felt at my kids bickering at a time like this. I didn’t care that they were small, couldn’t they read the room?

I didn’t look at them, I couldn’t. Couldn’t bear the things they reminded me of. 

They were kids. They didn’t understand why I didn’t care about a doll at their father’s funeral. Logically, I knew that, but sometimes it was just really hard to accept. 

I was *embarrassed.*

Wrangling my children while the entire church full of people looked at me with all that pity in their eyes. The good intentions were there but I felt patronised. None of them dared to speak to me, not even my own family. I couldn’t blame them, what were they supposed to say? *The poor grieving widow.*

That’s all I’d ever be now. 

It was still raw. It had only been two weeks since the accident. I could still feel the injury I’d sustained to my spine. 

Can you call it an accident? *That man may not have meant to murder my husband but he meant to drink every drop he did before he got in the car.*

Drunk driver. A tragic accident. What if that tragic accident was *your* whole world? Ben... Ben and the kids were my whole world.

I was in the car too when that sack of breathing shit hit us. I barely remember the hours after, the doctors said I was in shock and they hid so much from me. It hurt, like I’d swallowed knives. It took them hours to even tell me Ben was dead. 

I spent nights in the hospital after it happened, wishing I’d died instead. 

I resented my mother when she came to see me the day I was discharged... why did she bring the kids? I wasn’t ready to parent again yet. Wasn’t that obvious? I’d just had so much ripped away.

“You need to do something Kel, think about your kids, those two little angels are the only things that will get you through this.” She managed between sobs. 

How selfish. How fucking selfish. 

She dumped those two insensitive little creatures on me, full of curiosity and questions while I tried to quietly grieve their dad. She didn’t even say goodbye to them, just left them there, needy little parasites. 

I hated my mum for it but she was right. *I needed them.*

I spent the next few nights just watching them sleep. I never looked at their faces, I couldn’t; but their little hands, their feet, their breathing chests, it kept me calm. I lived in their bedrooms. 

Watching them breathe was a distraction, a soothing way to remind myself that *something* near me was alive. 

Sometimes I could see Ben there too, smiling at me from across the strewn out toys on the floor. It was the only time I felt any peace, just watching them sleep and trying to piece together the fragments of the accident.

It was such a blur. A blur of Ben; driving us home from the restaurant, his panic as he put his foot on the breaks and the other car hit from the side, the chaos the impact caused in our tiny metal shell. 

Ben. Head back. Dead.

It was my worst fear realised, a part of me stolen. Or was it?

I’d become a bag of nerves, barely able to function. Every time I thought that I could breathe, even just for a short moment that car was coming towards us again. The sound of the impact rang in my ears. It was never complete, always just those same tiny, terrifying fragments. 

I watched as my daughter Jade’s chest rose and fell gently. She was only six years old. She would barely remember her father. Neither would her tiny brother Joey, only four years old in the next room.

Raising them alone. Without my soulmate. Was that my worst fear? 

I flitted from room to room. Just watching my children and desperately avoiding sleep. Sleep bought dreams. Dreams I wasn’t ready to see. Would I close my eyes and see Ben... the version of him I wanted to remember?

Or would I shut my eyes and see his corpse... neck lulling about in the drivers seat... trickle of blood dripping from the end of his nose...*BANG.*

NO. I wasn’t ready to sleep yet. Not ready to see it.

I didn’t make the children go to school. Who would? They didn’t bat an eyelid at the change in routine, it was like their dad hadn’t even existed. We spent those two weeks in a bubble of grief, them bickering over that stupid doll. 

I found their dad too painful to mention and they never once asked for him. I found that painful too.

Had they already forgotten him? Would they forget me too? *Was that my worst fear?*

The funeral was planned quickly. I thumbed through catalogues of floral tributes while the kids bickered in the background, interrupting me at every heart wrenching turn. 

“Mum, Joey won’t let me have my doll back!”

That doll. That stupid fucking doll. I’m sure I’d heard Jade say that same line a thousand times. Why were kids so repetitive? How could they be so *bothered* by something so *trivial.*

When she repeated it, on the pew during the funeral, after I’d told Joey to be nice, I snapped. I couldn’t take it anymore. The constant bickering was exhausting. 

“Will you both stop it! Your father is dead! Can’t you see all these crying people?!”

The church stopped in a collective gasp. I felt that unwavering pity and it terrified me. Would I forever be ostracised? Was my worst fear becoming a charity case in the eyes of all my peers? 

A monument to Ben. Maybe.

Ben’s mother started to approach me. I’d avoided her since his death. Every phone call, every time she knocked on the door. I couldn’t bear to look at her. 

The same way I couldn’t bear to look at the kids I’d just screamed at so publicly. The ones who just lost their dad. Frozen, snot drooling down my face, I was a mess. 

“Kelly...” Bens mum was crying. They all were. *Everyone* was sad, so why was their so much pity directed at me? 

Most had taken a step back. Too uncomfortable to comfort the grieving widow but not uncomfortable enough not to stare. I just didn’t understand. I hated being the centre of attention.

Maybe that, selfishly, was my worst fear?

I backed away a little in my seat, careful not to go too far and crush my already traumatised children. They were close behind me. 

I needed to be able to watch them breathe that night, watch their tiny chests rise and fall under the duvet. To know that I wasn’t alone. Ben’s mother took a seat the other side of me. 

Her face was etched in sympathy. Condescending, regretful sympathy, and genuine concern. She cared. I felt a pang of guilt for freezing her out. I moved to the side so she could see her grandchildren. Bens children. They were right behind me. 

“Kelly, I know you’re in shock but you need help. You know they’re gone don’t you... all of them?”

That was ridiculous. They were right there. Bickering. Right fucking there.... Wait... no. My eyes darted around the cavernous room, hovering at breaks in the lights and chaos.

*There was more than one coffin in the room.*

“Just because you lost your child doesn’t mean you have the right to insinuate-“ I bit back, but as I did an awful thought crawled from the depths of my mind. The depths of my memory. 

*Those other coffins were so small.*

I turned but this time I didn’t see my children fighting over a doll, dressed in black on a church pew. This time I saw them, fighting over that same doll in the back of our family car, strapped into their little car seats. 

*The kids were in the car. They were right behind me.*

I blinked but the memory was too strong. I couldn’t will myself back into that church no matter how hard I tried. I was stuck. 

Stuck in the front seat of the car. On *that* night. 

We’d gotten strapped in, just after the trip to the restaurant. The children were bickering and I was fed up. Ben couldn’t stop smiling. He never could, that man was just so damn content.

Why couldn’t I have been the same? Why couldn’t I have just listened to that bickering and heard the same blissful bird song that Ben did whenever our kids made a sound? Why was that damn bickering all I could hear?

“Mum, Joey won’t let me have my doll back!”

They were the last words I heard before the impact. In an instant I was catapulted, back into that vast empty church. Alone on the pew with the mother of my dead husband. 

Grandmother to my dead children.

Suddenly my own mother’s comments about my two little angels made sense. The pity made sense. The repetition of that fucking line about the doll made sense. 

It was never Jade, it was me, desperate to remember.

I hadn’t been able to see it before; the accident was so blurred. I was grieving. I didn’t want to believe it but now it was clear.

My children were right behind me. They were right behind me during the accident and they *died.*

I thought about it. Hard. I tried to process a million emotions at once as I stared at their tiny coffins. Was this whole situation my worst fear? You’d think so wouldn’t you. Isn’t it yours?

I took a deep breath as mourners left the hall. I tried to scramble to my feet, to walk out and prepare for life without them. A miserable existence on my own. Just as I turned to exit the row I was shaken by a little voice.

“Mum, Joey won’t let me have my doll back!”

I turned to see them both, stood there in the same clothes they’d word in the restaurant. Except they were dirtier... torn... *bloodied.* I blinked but they wouldn’t go away. They followed me to their graves and they followed me home. 

I’ve tried everything and they’re still there as I write this, right now, bickering over a doll. 

I was wrong. About my worst fear. It was never that the kids *were* right behind me.

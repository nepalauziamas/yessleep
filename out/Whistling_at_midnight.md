When i was a child my mother always told me not to whistle, i didn't care though i did what i wanted. I never understood why she said this to me though, it seemed a little silly to me.

The other evening i came home from work at a late hour, about midnight. I work extensive hours also and am drained for most of the days, as of now i am 28 years old and i received my grandmothers house as inheritance when she passed in 2019. My house is somewhat renovated now after i did some work on it in the year after her passing. She had an old attic that nobody ever really mentioned until i saw a door that was painted on and kept sealed shut. I just left it how it was and never touched it until the other night.

So back to the night, i get home, pop open a few beers and watch my shows on TV. As the commercials are playing in the background i begin to make something inside of the Kitchen while still watching the TV, a commercial stuck me when a person was advertising a product while they whistled on the commercial, i start laughing to myself and think of what my mother told me when i was young and think to myself how outrageous that thought is. Whatever, i continue to make my food and also begin to whistle a sort of tune. I laugh it off and sit back down on the recliner to watch TV comfortably. Then the commercials start again and i turned my TV volume lower because i was getting bit drowsy, as my eyes shut i start to hear the same tune that i whistled earlier. I thought maybe i was in a daze of sleep or something so i just shook it off and closed my eyes again but the whistling started again. I recognized the whistle coming near the stairs, went closer to the area and it stopped. I was walking back to my room as i was a bit scared now and while i was walking the whistle was loud and clear and it sounded directly from the attic i mentioned.

I ran like a dog after a paperboy to my room and closed my door, it scared me enough to keep me up for a few more hours just to see if it would happen again, it didn't. I told my mom about it and she thought i was lying but i insisted that it came from the attic. A few weeks later we unsealed the paint from the door and went up into the attic.... i will post that story in a few days to tell more about what we found in the attic and what my mother told me about my grandfather.

Days go by after we found what was in the attic and i was in shock, i didnt know what i had gotten myself into. Needless to say i moved out of my grandmothers house and into an apartment in a residing town.

I want to get introductions out of the way. My name is Kelsey, and for privacy purposes, I will not be putting my last name on this document. My first reaction to what had been happening to me was to get a video camera out and document everything: After closer consideration, I decided to write everything down and leave out the video. Anyway, last Friday, I heard something in the woods, and I have been being terrorized ever since. 

**Last Friday**

Last Friday, I was stuck at home because my car broke down on my way home from work. At first, I saw this as a blessing because I could work from home, but now I know it was a curse. I live in a small house on the edge of town. Honestly, it would take me twenty minutes to walk to the closest store. I wouldn't have to, though, because I could jump on a four-wheeler and be there much faster. My dog, Bacon, couldn't have been happier when he figured out I wasn't leaving for the day. 

After washing the dishes, I settled on the couch with Bacon to do a couple of things for work. I had no intention of working the whole day; it was beautiful outside. Around noon I finished what I needed to do and took Bacon outside. My property is beautiful for the most part. I keep my whole yard fenced in. Beyond the fence, nature does whatever it wants. Inside the fence, I keep my yard in order. As I watched Bacon run around the yard, I opened a can of Spritz and relaxed on the porch.

It wasn't until Bacon began barking that I noticed something was off. At first, it didn't bother me, but it was quiet outside, and once Bacon broke the silence, I noticed there were no birds. I looked down at my can of soda; usually, if I left it out too long, there would be at least one fly trying to get at it: However, there were no insects. As I made my way to Bacon, I watched the woods. Usually, I would call his name, but something in my mind was preventing me from speaking. I took him gently in my arms and made my way back to the house: That is when I heard it the first time. Something "barked" at me as I turned my back. The bark didn't sound normal. It sounded like a twisted version of Bacon's bark. My body tensed when I heard the sound; I practically ran to my house aftward. That afternoon I went inside, assuming it was an animal, likely a fox. 

That night Bacon and I stayed inside. I set up puppy pads for him; there was no way I would let him back outside. Around five o'clock, we began to hear the barking again. It is hard for me to describe. The animal sounded like someone had recorded Bacon barking and adjusted the audio to sound more high-pitched. At that point, I decided to look up what sound a fox makes: After a couple of videos, I deduced that this animal was not a fox. It couldn't have been a coyote or a wolf either, I checked. During the barking, Bacon didn't move an inch. Without any more hesitation, I decided to call animal control, and they told me they could come out on Monday. How ridiculous is that? I should've lied and told them it was a bear or something in hindsight.

I told Bacon that help wasn't coming; I was not going to have the police show up for an animal: This was the wrong call at the moment. Bacon never made a sound. I went upstairs, packed a bag, and grabbed my helmet and the keys to my four-wheeler. I also grabbed Bacon's helmet: I was not leaving him here by himself for the night. As I reached for the doorknob, I heard the barking again. My heart was skipping beats. Instead of walking out right away, I put on Bacon's helmet and turned around to go out the side door. Once I reached the door, I put my helmet on and ran. 

When my boots hit the grass, it felt like something was wrong. The atmosphere felt heavy; my whole body was tense. Bacon whimpered from my arm. I tried to reassure him as I moved across the field. Once I reached the four-wheeler, I put the key in and started it immediately. When the headlights came on, my hands tensed, I had Bacon in front of me, and I could hear him whimper again.  

I watched as the lights hit the beast; it stood on its hind legs. Its eyes looked right at me; the small white dots cut through the darkness. The light further illuminated them. Its body was covered in thin strands of hair, and its ears were long: They came to a sharp point above its head. When it snarled, I could see its teeth. The beast had long arms that came down to the grass; underneath its arms, there were two smaller arms. Unlike the long arms that came down to oversized paws, the smaller components looked like human hands. The beast was massive, and the creature's look had me paralyzed with fear. As it walked toward me, its head twisted side to side. Eventually, the beast turned its head upside down completely; it copied Bacon's bark again once it was done. I screamed. I screamed harder than I ever had before. That's when the creature produced my scream as it ran towards me; the scream was near perfect. 

I drove as fast as I could. Bacon didn't move an inch. As we drove towards my front gate, I braced myself and drove through it, the sound of the wood breaking made me yip, and the beast copied my sound. It yipped at me repeatedly as if it was taunting me. I could feel the ground moving as the creature ran. This thing was massive. As I reached the road at the end of my dirt path, the beast stopped running. 

**Tuesday** 

After we got away, I went to the police; I was a crying mess. The police told me they would send someone out. I went to stay at a motel. My nightmares have been horrible. The police said to me on Monday there were signs of a bear on my property, but they couldn't find the animal in the woods.

Bacon is okay! He still hasn't barked, and I don't blame him. I will not be returning home until I have concrete answers, just thinking about going back makes me [nervous](https://www.reddit.com/r/SpectralsMegaverse/collection/186d353d-7f6d-4006-aa0e-e38746123553).

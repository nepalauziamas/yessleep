It was the third time that day that I felt an unnatural warmth begin where the child was sitting on my leg. I’d grown past being disgusted by it. As I felt the first drops hit my leg inside the suit and begin to roll down my leg, I lifted the boy under the armpits, set him on his feet next to the chair, and stood up. He started crying, and the piece of paper he was gripping tightly in his little fist fell from his hand as he smothered his tears in his palms.

“Hey, little man, it’s ok,” I said. “It happens. Let’s get you to your mom so you can get cleaned up.” I looked up, and saw a pretty blonde woman with arms full of shopping bags was already hurrying over, alerted either by the tears or the enormous wet spot on her son’s pants.

“I’m his mom,” she said through rapid breaths from the hustle over.

“Hi, ma’am,” I said as she walked up. “It seems like we’ve had a bit of an accident.”

The mom’s face flushed, clearly a bit embarrassed.

“Oh, I’m so sorry! This has never happened before,” she said.

“It’s really ok. Part of the job,” I said, chuckling.

The little dude was still bawling, which, I mean, fair. I generally don’t love being covered in urine either, now not being an exception. I gave him my very best Santa head pat, and told him again that it was ok.

“Please, Santa, you have to let us get you cleaned up,” the mom said.

“Really, it’s ok. I’ve got spare pants in the mall supply closet, and I can wash down real quick in there, too,” I told her.

“Can I at least pay you for the cleaning costs?”

I quickly glanced down at her hand, and saw no rings.

“The mall already handles all of that. But, maybe you would let me buy you a drink sometime,” I asked, hope in my voice. I thought maybe I could turn this pee situation into something nice, after all.

The mom smiled this adorable, bashful smile, some of the flush returning to her cheeks.

“That would be lovely,” she said. “But you better not tell Mrs. Claus!”

“Oh, don’t worry. There’s no Mrs. Claus,” I said, laughing.

She grabbed a slip of scrap paper and a pen from a purse buried under the shopping bags, and scribbled down her phone number.

“My name’s Molly, by the way,” she said. “Give me a call when you’re finished here, Santa.”

She grinned, and walked off.

I was thrilled.

I ended up getting washed up and changed, and back out to work in just about 15 minutes. The rest of the day was pretty low key. No more urine incidents.

At the end of the day, I started helping tear down some of the parts of the North Pole scene that I sit in, when I noticed a crumpled piece of paper. Remembering that Molly’s boy had dropped his list when he came up, I absentmindedly shoved it into my pocket to give to her when we met up again.

After finishing packing up and getting changed, I jumped in my car and raced home. I wanted to at least take a shower and get myself cleaned up, to prove to her that I wasn't just some loser in a urine-soaked Santa costume.

Getting up to my apartment, I pulled out the paper in my pocket and dropped it on my kitchen island. Grabbing my cell phone, I spun the piece of paper with Molly’s phone number on it so that it faced me, and dialed her number.

As the phone rang, I noticed some bright colors on the crumpled list to Santa. The little guy must have drawn a picture for the jolly, red-suited fellow. I pulled it closer to me, and was about to take a look when I heard the line connect.

“Hello?” I heard Molly ask.

“Hi,” I said cheerfully, absently pushing aside the drawing. “It’s Santa.”

Molly laughed. “I’ve been looking forward to your call,” she said.

“I’m glad to hear it,” I said. Would you be up for having that drink tonight?”

“Of course,” she replied, a smile in her tone. She gave me the address of a favorite pub near her place. I promised to grab a quick shower and then text her when I was on my way.

“Oh, and Santa,” she said right before I hung up. “Why don’t you bring that Santa suit for later? You never know, I just might end up on your naughty list.” She giggled, then hung up.

So you can be sure I packed the Santa outfit.

I took a quick shower, with multiple dousings of soap to prise the faint scent of pee from me. I figured that might be a turn off for Molly. I mean, she’s Santa suit-kinky, but I’m not sold she’s also golden shower-kinky.

Getting out and getting dressed in a hurry, I snagged my cell phone and Molly’s son’s list from the counter as I headed out the door. On the elevator ride down to the parking area, I shot Molly a quick text telling her I was on my way. Fidgeting with the paper in my hands, I remembered that I had wanted to look at the picture to Santa.

Opening it up, I saw a nightmare etched in crayon across the page. Within the childish scratchings, I could make out a red suited man with a thick white beard and a Santa hat lying strapped to a bed. Kneeling above him, a woman with blonde hair and no clothes was holding a thin gray object in the air. Dark red crayon erupted from the red-suited man’s neck.

The boy had drawn his mother murdering a man dressed as Santa mid-sexcapade.

The elevator reached the ground floor and I stood still in shock for so long that the doors opened and then re-closed, assuming I had gotten out.

I kept staring at the drawing, and I noticed, seemingly muted by the geyser of red, a shape under the bed. It looked like a small boy, huddled, hands over his ears, hiding under the fountaining viscera.

I gasped, and took an involuntary step back, almost tripping over the bag full of Santa suit I had set on the floor next to me.

The elevator started moving again, startling me. I yelped.

When the doors opened, it was at my floor, and I rushed out, bumping into my neighbor, who said something pissy to my back as they headed into the elevator. I unlocked my door, rushed in, and slammed it behind me, throwing the deadbolt.

As the shock and adrenaline worked its way through my veins, I fell back against the door, slowly sliding down it until I sat on the floor. Eventually, I broke down and cried, grasping the drawing, the warning the boy had given me, tightly in my hand, just like he had this morning.

And that was when my phone started ringing.

It was Molly.

I barricaded the front door to the cheerful ringtone as it rang over and over and over.

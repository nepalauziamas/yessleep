I’m not necessarily sure if these stories belong in the no sleep subreddit, as they aren’t that creepy. However, I found it was fit enough to tell others as these stories have stayed with me my whole life and have evoked horrible memories. 

STORY 1

For starters, this first story happened when I was 8. I was extremely scared of the dark and my sister and I gotten into a fight over something dumb. We were inside of my room when this happened, and my room was connected to our playroom through the bathroom (essentially a “Jack and Jill bathroom”). I remember screaming at her before she turned off the light and left the room whilst keeping the door shut. I was extremely panicked by this and started screaming and crying. That was when I heard my bathroom door open, it was previously shut. I turned around screaming even harder than before.

I swear on my life that this next part is true. I saw a long arm reach out, its fingers long and pointy, and a deep groan emerged from the bathroom. I wasn’t thinking clearly enough to just turn on the light and kept watching as the terrifying entity moved slowly out of the bathroom. I screamed a blood curdling scream, letting my sister know that something was very wrong. She quickly opened the door and turned on the lights. My sister was laughing at me as I cried out tears of horror and fear. I looked at the bathroom door again. It was shut completely. I didn’t her about that incident until I was 13. To my surprise, she actually believed me. If you’re asking why, this next story may just answer that question.

STORY 2

For some background information, my family moved into an apartment when I was 10. My uncle was helping us move in. During that time, my uncle was living with us. I remember walking into what would be my uncle’s room when on the window sill we found a hollowed-out frog. It was a real frog that smelt like utter shit and other rotting things. Of course we googled what it meant and found no answer. I think it might be related to the reason why so many weird things ended up happening in our apartment.

Alright, now to the story that made my sister believe every unexplainable situation that has ever happened to us. I was 11 years old and chilling in my room. My mom was sleeping in her room, my sister was at a sleepover, and my dad was at work. It was roughly around 10:46pm when this happened. I was under the sheets, I was still afraid of the dark at that time, and was watching movies on my phone. That’s when I started feeling an abnormal weight on top of me. I thought I was making things up and turned my body. It didn’t help. I ignored it and went to bed. The next night was somewhat different. I was about to go to bed, still using the sheets to hide myself from what was lurking in the dark, when I heard heavy breathing. I assumed it was from the video I was watching, but when I paused the video I still heard it. The noise would change from heavy breathing on top of me to someone running around my room and giggling.  

A few months passed since then, my uncle had moved out and I was chilling in what is now, used to be my uncle’s, sister’s room. She was in my room. 

I’d thought I’d mess with her by texting her “I can see u”, the way the rooms’ windows were aligned gave me an insight into my room from her room. Of course, she sent me a message saying how it wasn’t funny. It wasn’t until 3 minutes later when she started spamming me texts asking for me to stop messing with her in the room. This confused me as she knew I was sleeping in her room. Then it hit me. I ran into my room and made sure she was okay. She was crying. I asked her about what happened and she described the exact same things that happened to me. I hadn’t even told her nor anyone about what I went through the night of the incident.

STORY 3

This last story happened when I was 12. It was June and me and my cousin decided to go swimming, by ourselves. It wasn’t a very safe idea, but we figured it didn’t matter since we had been going to the pool alone before. We were about an hour into swimming when I got a sickening feeling. *Before I continue, I just wanted to add that the pool we went to had rules but no lifeguard. One of the rules stated that children under the age of 14 needed a parent or guardian to go there.*   That’s when I noticed an old woman, she was wearing an orange dress and was walking towards the pool. Usually whenever me and my cousin saw an adult walking towards the pool, we would duck under the water or be close enough to the edge that they wouldn’t be able to see us from the pool’s gate. Then, completely out of the blue, the women started to crawl on all four, like that gremlin from “Lord of the Rings”. She crawled up to the gate and looked around. At one point I made eye contact with her. She then, finally, crawled away. 

The odd thing about her was that she only stopped crawling away when someone else saw her. My cousin also saw the woman, but he didn’t see her crawling or hear her growling. We told my uncle who also saw her but said that she was walking completely fine. 

That night, when all of my family went to my nana’s house, we all saw something terrifying at some point that day.

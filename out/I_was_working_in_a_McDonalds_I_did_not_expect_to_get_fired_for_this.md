One year ago (January) I was furiously working at the drive through in McDonald’s in Macedonia.

After a while they found out I was Bulgarian and fired me. I went back and checked the basement where the sign of it on the door said : “no Bulgarians allowed!!!11”. This was the final straw.

I barged into the basement because of course as a Bulgarian I needed to know, for the sake of my people, why the Macedonian McDonald’s was racist towards us.

Inside the basement I saw unimaginable things. There must have been at least 50000 square inches of servers in that room. Admittedly, I didn’t check what was on them, but it’s safe to assume they contained anti Bulgarian files.

I checked inside the drawers of the desk which was in the middle of the basement room. The computer inside (it was in the drawer somehow) said that Macedonians are based, whereas Bulgarians are bad because they illegally give cars for cheap to people in Romania. This is true, but they didn’t have to say it like that.

I don’t know if this is the same for all Bulgarians, but I for one like importing cars to Romania for cheap (it is a good business), so personally I couldn’t accept the fact that these Macedonians fired me for being Bulgarian and importing cars to Romania.

I came up with a plan to destroy the building. You see, the gas pipes in that specific McDonald’s run directly through the deep fryer (which I worked at before my firing). Of course, using this knowledge I was able to devise my super plan.

The plan involved three items:

A lighter, which I would use to ignite the gas in the gas pipes to cause the destruction of the building.

Taco Bell tacos. This would help me create even more destructive gas to blow up the building.

My magic marvel summing book. I would use it to turn into the hulk to help me destroy the Macedonian McDonald’s.

So I went to the Taco Bell across the street (which was the biggest rival of that McDonald’s at the time) and bought 500 taco bells.

Now you may be confused, so allow me explain fully why the 500 taco bells were going to help me. 

So as you should know, tacos are produced in Mexico. This place (Mexico) is very warm due to its location on Earth. It is very close to the equator, meaning it gets lots of energy from the Sun. You see, tacos produced here will be full to the brim with this energy, and according to my calculations (which I did in my head because I'm a genius), the energy from the 500 taco bells would be transferred into me when I ate them, and I could harness this power to destroy the McDonald's once and for all (along with 10 blocks of city in the blast radius).

The final part of the plan came to me as I was eating the taco bells. It was a realisation that hit me like a racially motivated train. I realised that all this energy was too much. Even for a hench Bulgarian such as myself. So I had to become something greater. Something bigger. Something stronger. Something green. The hulk is real, and you'd best believe me when I tell you, because I became the hulk!!1!!!11!!1!

I went home as I was finishing up the rest of the taco bells and whipped out my magic Marvel summon book. I used the hulk spell (which is a real spell in a real book, but don't look it up, just trust me). I turned into the hulk, and without a second thought, I went to pay that McDonald's a lesson. I squeezed very hard, and out came a thunder fard, which instantly blew up the whole building, along with 10.2321 other blocks in the city.

Da end yea.

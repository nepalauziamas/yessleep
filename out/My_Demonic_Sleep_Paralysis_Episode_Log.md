This is a real story from my sleep log about my demonic sleep paralysis episode. I often have these demonic episodes and I genuinely get scared to sleep at times which pretty much gives me insomnia. I feel as though I am slowly losing my insanity or my spiritual health is diminishing. 

This story is authentic and none of it is made up. It is written straight from when it happened, I reviewed it so it makes sense as it was written with 0 hours of sleep at 3 am

I have a nice cozy, warm snug pj's and It feels kinda puffy. My weird mind had an internal dialog with an imaginary person next to my bedside as I try to fall asleep. I thought the person next to me was my sister and I said to the person next to me, "feel how puffy it is" and then she hugged me to feel it but the hug was restricted to only holding and grabbing my arms, I then slowly realised it was a paralysis but I still sense the hands on my arms but not physically feel the hug. It was like a spiritual hug. The placement of the hug was incredibly weird and not normal it felt off and backward.

How I described it is if someone would be sitting to your left at the bedside as you lie on your back they would sit facing you. If that person were to hug you they would use their left-arm hug to your right side and their right to your left side and their head would be somewhere on the left shoulder. 

What felt backward was that their hands were opposite. Their right arm to my right arm and left to my left and the thumb was on the insides toward my chest. It is almost as if you turned your back and used your hands backward rather than crossing your arms and reaching in front of you. This was because I felt the thumbs on the inside. Their back was turned to me and their arms reached backwards to grab my arms

I slowly start to realise it is paralysis because I can't move any limbs and I can't breathe properly (shallow breathing). I can sense the placement of my sister's head on my left side and start moving towards my next. My sister's head starts to morph into a larger mouth with some sharp long fangs for teeth. I could feel the presence of the moth near my neck as if it was to bite and it was there open for the entire paralysis. I tried to jump out and kick my right leg over my body but it wouldn't work and I felt fatigued. I could still sense this weird cunt demon grabbing with its backwards fucked up arms

The sensation was not an exact touch, it felt like the sensation of hugging a relative almost exactly but without the physical touch. 

I can explain how through words how uneasy and weird this feels, in my mind, this was not just hallucinations but real. 

I guess I will have no sleep for a while

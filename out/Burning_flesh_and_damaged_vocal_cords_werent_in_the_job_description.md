I could talk for an eternity about my experience. Due to the NDA (for the privacy of the members) I must be *very careful* how I go about that. But there is one thing that can’t go untold. One thing that I *must* share with you. 
 
Let me preface this story so you may learn a little bit about me, I had a few diagnoses that were left untreated for a while, so I made the decision to seek help. This led to my admission to a long-term treatment center called a DAS Program (Diversion Acute Stabilization), which is definitely a story in and of itself that I'll save for another day.

######Having said that, I would like you to keep in mind that I am taking the right medications and controlling my diseases as I share my experience with you

After my ~~mistreatment,~~ I was excited to start working again, and to my surprise a fresh listing popped up for the *Private Country Club.* I was pleased to see it was within walking distance from my house, only 20 minutes. I submitted my application and within the hour the manager (let's call him Dave) reached out to me and offered me an interview the following day. The interview went well, as usual. I was honest about my prior medical treatment and diagnoses which as why there was a large gap in my work history, and Dave was accepting and said the club could easily accommodate my needs by hiring me part-time in housekeeping.. which is fairly simple, doing what I already do at home on a larger scale in a much fancier environment and with a great pay.

This chance served as my golden key and I had just opened the door to the beginning of the next phase of my life and making close connections with some of the higher class, thanks to my courteous and professional nature. 

######I had to build luck because I wasn't blessed from birth.

A little history on the club, while protecting privacy, it was well over 150 years old. It caught fire on Christmas Eve (of which year I’m not too sure), and again Christmas Day that caused more damage than the former. Little is said about the fires, only that it was “lovingly restored” within just 3 years and that it was rebuilt larger and better than before, keeping its Victorian allure over the many years to pass. I've never seen anything so magnificent. 

*Cascading marble stair case with gold and diamond chandeliers. Embellished crystal windows with wrought-iron accents and massive stained glass masterpieces, almost haunting as it lingered on you mind well after your departure.*

Some places, such as hotels, may have a highly suspicious room or two, but the Club has an *entire floor* sealed off to members and forbidden to employees.. I was a trustworthy person, but I also had a curious mind that was always looking for untold tales and mysteries. I was skilled at planning my actions like a chess player would, always thinking two moves ahead and influencing what you would do next.

After finishing my 90-day probationary period, I had built enough trust and I was able to persuade Dave that the Club would *benefit* from being thoroughly cleaned in the evenings after the members had left; so that I could *polish off the finer details.* He happily agreed and was moved by my initiative. I was granted access to the Club all to myself two nights out of the week. 

During my first night after completing my commitments, it way too still and way too quiet. I’m used to it being full of life as these rich members that live in luxury for a low price of **$10k check upon approval, & $500 per month.** The energy is nice during the day when there’s a full house to add life and energy into it, but in the night when it’s empty it’s blankly nullified. Completely devoid of any sentience. Creaks and old vents roaring on and off, lights that were dim to create an ambiance now created shadows that danced in the corners of the rooms. Mirrors showing my own reflection every turn I made >!(I guess rich people really enjoy looking at themselves, but it’s a bitch to clean and terrifying when you’re alone)!<


I was scared already, I’ll admit, but that was the point of all this. Eventually I slipped up to the abandoned floor. As dirty as I had imagined, I left a trail walking to the only door occupying the large hallway. The room must have been massive. Wiping off the brass panel, the room was introduced as the *“Bridal Suite”* which as expected was *locked.* 


It didn't seem suspicious because the room was on the fourth floor, which the elevator did not reach. The walk down the graceful entrance to the venue would have been quite the endeavor, even if the elevator was used to skip 2 floors. The new suite being on the second floor made sense, allowing for a far more enchanting descend.


I’m familiar with the newer addition. The package included luxurious benefits that got the Club a lot of attention. The room was accommodated with *a day-of coordinator known as a "Bridal Assistant" or "Lady-in-Waiting", managing communications between the bride and the venue before saying "I do."*


As I started to lose interest in the level's mysteries and untapped potential, I started to make my way toward the stairs with the intention of stopping on the third floor, locking the corridor behind me and taking the elevator the remaining distance down.


I barely turned around when I was thrown to the ground as blast of air whipped past me, so hot that my normally fair skin **immediately** turned bright red. I winced in pain, unable to make us of any of my other senses, losing all control of my body. I was completely oblivious to what was happening until I heard a struggle coming from the stairway, which proceeded down to the closed-off foyer that divided the 3rd and 4th floors.


*I choked on the dirty smell of burnt hair and what I can only presume was the stench of **burning flesh.** It was pungent, assaulting most of my previously paralyzed senses at once. I pierced my eyes shut (partially for safety from whatever was replacing the originally stagnant air, and but mostly because I was scared to death of what I might have seen.) The fumes were repulsive. The metallic taste of blood took a while to leave my mouth, moist in my nose with a trace of earth and bubbling fat but it doesn't smell like meat. It has a shadow of morality to it; you know it's human, and it's haunting. The description doesn't cause you agony; but the experience does. It’s haunting and I can still smell it. Something about that stench of death etches itself into your mind and cannot be ignored, reminding you of the horrifying pain someone actually suffered.*


*Through **damaged vocal cords,** I heard piercing cries of terror and pain. Inaudible voices desperately trying to aid whatever tragedy was unfolding right in front of my eyes, which were blindly unaware of what was actually taking place. Frantic sounds of footsteps around me, through me, and down the stairs. I don’t know how much time had passed before I opened my eyes.*


*Terrified, I crawled toward..whatever was happening..covered in not only dust but also the contents of my stomach. As I made my way around the curve of the mantle, I could see the enclosed foyer that had been a crime scene moments before. The temperature dropped from the hottest summer day I’ve never experienced to a temperature cold enough I almost wanted it back. Sections of my freshly burned skin sprouted painful goosebumps.*


*Looking and seeing nothing or no one is the preferred outcome, and essentially it was; had there not been traces of activity illustrated in the dust. Footsteps running in from different directions, and a dark ash replaced the dust in the center of their attention.*


I don’t know what courage I had that got me to my feet but I ran through the empty space without direction. The temperature spiking back up quickly as I exited to the 3rd floor and my already damaged skin was scorned even worse as I escaped as quickly as I could having to endure the pain of the temperature drop once again. That 20 minute walk home turned into a 9 minute run, which under normal circumstances I would have been impressed. I flew through the door straight to the shower to wash my body with hot water and layers of soap, oblivious to the blistering of my fragile flesh. No matter how hard I tried, I was unable to remove the stench. It clung to me and made itself *comfortable.*


I replayed the scene over and over, attempting to see it in a new light. There is almost always an explanation other than a ghost, such as my panic disorder feeding off of my PTSD, but as the pain settled in and oozing burns became more pronounced, I knew this wasn't the case. 


I sat in my room, forcing myself to stay awake and my anxiety medication *wasn’t* an option. I couldn’t sleep, I wouldn’t let myself even blink too often. I felt like if I closed my eyes, I'd melt away back in time; inside the past as a witness to what had actually happened, and I had witnessed enough for one night without actually seeing anything at all.


I starred at the clock until my alarm went off. 


######6:30am - It was time to get ready for my opening shift. 


That night had ended, but this story had not.

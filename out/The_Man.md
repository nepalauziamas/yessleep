This story takes place around a little bit over a decade ago, when I was about 4 years old. I was at my dads house for the weekend with my twin brother like we’ve done ever weekend. So this morning like almost ever other mornings, I wake up and so does my brother shorty after. We get fully awake, and start walking over to our dads room. Now the second level of the house is basically just a square, with two rooms on the left side, the bathroom in the middle, two rooms on the right side, and the stairs leading up up to the second is also in the middle across from the bathroom. So the room me and my brother were staying, is on the left side of the hallway with our dads room too. So as we walk out our room headed to our dads, I’m leading the way with my brother behind me. And it’s when we about 3 feet in front of the door to my dads room which he has cracked open little less than half way open. I see the silhouette of a man just standing in my dads room. Now at this point me and my brother have been awake no longer than 30 seconds so I can’t say that I was fully awake to say exactly who or what it was I saw. So after about 10 seconds of staring at what looks like a man just standing there. I slowly walk back to our room. And it’s when we got back to the room it really hit me how weird that was. After a second of sitting on the bed, I asked my brother if he saw what I had just saw. Which he then replied no. Now at that point, I was really sure I really saw what I saw, so I then slowly crept to the doorway of my dad‘s room again with my brother still behind me. And when I go to the room I peaked through the doorway and then I realize that it wasn’t just a man but he was completely black. Like no features outside of his shape, I couldn’t identify any facial and body features about him just that he was all black. Now we’re staring at here for the second time I realize that I couldn’t see any hair on the man now with my dad being a bald man I assumed it was him, but a few seconds after staring at his man I could hear my dad snoring sound asleep on his bed. So after thinking about who this man could be the next best thing I thought of who it be is my uncle. My uncle is also bald, and was about the same shape as the man I was looking at so I quietly said “oh hey uncle!” With no reply. I didn’t ask my brother who was still next to me if you had saw the man this time, and he told me he still didn’t see anything. So after a few seconds later which felt like forever, I just slowly walked back to our room and shut the door and waiting for dad to wake up. When he woke up and fix us breakfast I didn’t mention anything to him about the man I saw. Fast forward a little bit over a decade later I am now 18 and every time I think about it I think of every reasonable thing that might give me an answer to who what I was. I sometimes wonder if it was an intruder who got caught due to my dad having a little porch outside of his room, but when I think of that it becomes that thought becomes more unlikely due to my dads room being on the second floor climbing up and reaching a balcony will most likely cause lots of attention. So if anybody has a explanation or a similar experience let me know because I really want to figure out what I saw that day in my dads room.

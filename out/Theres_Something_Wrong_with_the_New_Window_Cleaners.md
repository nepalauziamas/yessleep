The sounds of copy machines whirring and faxes being sent were loud all around me in the office.  Voices could be heard speaking about sales details, financial statements, and invoices.  

All the usual bustling activity of a regular Monday morning.

But there was a discontented air in the room.  A stuffiness which was burgeoning into a feeling of suffocation and dread.

People were beginning to shift their eyes nervously, pausing in the middle of sentences to look around before going back to what they were doing.

Something was wrong.  But nobody could tell yet what it was.

It took a while for me to figure it out.

At first I thought the electrical system was malfunctioning.  The computer screen looked so dim I was having trouble reading my email.  The papers on my desk in front of me were becoming unfocused and blurred.

I looked up at the fluorescents and saw them flickering away, their brightness burning my eyes when I stared for too long.  They weren’t the problem. 

But then I noticed the man outside the window, his gaze focused on his work.  So focused that he should have noticed what he was doing wrong.  

“What’s the deal with the new window cleaner?” I asked Marcie, sitting next to me at her desk.

The gentle squeak of the squeegee against the glass was the same as usual, but something was different. 

Why weren’t the windows getting any cleaner, I wondered.  They were getting darker by the second.

“Hmm, maybe they’re using yesterday’s water!” she laughed. I couldn’t help but chuckle, though uneasily.

That wasn’t it.  

For some reason it was unsettling, seeing him cleaning the windows but instead of getting cleaner they just got darker and dirtier. And yet the window cleaner didn’t stop, didn’t even slow down, he just kept at it.  He finished with one window and moved on to the next, and the room went another shade darker.  

“He’s really making a mess of it out there,” said Sam, the manager. He had come out from his office and I noticed now everyone was walking over towards the window and looking as it became darker and darker, more difficult to see through by the second.  

I decided to give a quick knock on the glass and ask the guy what he thought he was doing. Didn’t he realize he was painting our windows grey, almost black now, darker and darker by the second?

TAP, TAP, TAP!

I banged my knuckles against the glass next to where he was cleaning and looked out at him through the clear window pane.

Pointing at the black windows, I said, “What the hell do you think you’re doing exactly?”

He saw me and walked over to the window where I stood. He stared at me blankly and then began to paint that window with his odd darkening solution as well.

This frightened me more than just a little bit, since up close I could see that it wasn’t dirty water.  It was something more similar to black paint.

But it wasn't ordinary paint. I watched as each stroke with his squeegee seemed to dampen out the existence of everything outside. It felt like it was being erased, like we were being erased.

I began to pound on the glass with my fists and the palms of my hand, sweating now, my heart racing. Turning around, I saw my coworkers and boss were staring at me, looking worried.

But not worried enough.

“Don’t you see what he’s doing?” I screamed at them. “We have to get out of here!”

The window cleaner was methodically making his way around to all of the windows somehow. I didn’t understand, it was like he didn’t need a scaffold or a lift to bring him up to our high floor above street level. He was just standing out there on the air! On my tiptoes I could see over an obstruction that had been blocking my view of his feet.

He was moving rapidly to each of the windows now, blackening them, darkening them, making us disappear.

Sam tried the door and found it was locked tightly. He began to kick it and slam his shoulder against it, but it wouldn’t budge.

"Call the police!  Someone stop him!" a woman screamed from nearby.  

I asked Sam to move aside and tried to kick the door in as well, but it was firmly shut, as if welded closed.  

A few others came over to try as well, but nobody could get the door to budge.

It made no sense.  But then again, none of this made any sense.  

Soon all of the windows were black with midnight darkness.  The man was no longer visible, and I wondered if he was moving on to the next floor down, or the next building over, to perform the same evil task he had accomplished here.

Running back over to the windows, I looked out, trying to block the glare with my cupped hands so that I could see outside.  

For a few long moments I couldn't see anything at all.


But then I saw shadows and shapes moving in the blackness.  Huge, winged things like bats but the size of pterodactyls.  Something slammed hard into the window, rattling the glass in its frame.  


There was another impact, and then another.  


A hairline crack began to appear, spreading insidiously across the panel.  It branched outwards like a tree, growing wider and thicker as it traveled.  


I saw more dark forms gathering outside, looking curiously at us through the glass.  


One more hard impact and that glass will shatter, and I don't know what will happen next.


I imagine that darkness pouring in like a flood.  


And all of us are drowning in it.  While at the same time being pulled limb from limb by those bat-like creatures hovering outside.  


If you are reading this…. If you can see this…. Maybe there's still some hope.  


We're on the twenty-fifth floor of the Windsor Building.  


Please, if you can get through the door, help us.

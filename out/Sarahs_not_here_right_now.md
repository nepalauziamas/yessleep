Micheal's POV
I've been meaning to get this off my chest...



Hi, I am what you would call a "Serial Killer"
I usually murder my victims by means of strangulation, shooting, stabbing, overdosing, or just cutting them apart.

One day, this girl named Sarah came up to me saying "You look lonely" I was sitting alone in a starbucks and as soon as I laid eyes on her, I knew she was my next victim. "Oh yes I am, I just don't have friends."



"I can be your friend" Sarah replied with a slightly enlightened tone in her voice.


"That would be splendid! Hi, im Micheal, and you?"


"Sarah, so would you like to have a coffee together?


We chated through the morning into the afternoon through the sounds of the cars honking, the cop cars and ambulances wailing through the day, the sound of typing, slurping, talking, pouring, and walking.


"I have to get going now, heres my number if you want to talk later."



I grabbed the paper of her number and finished drinking my 5th coffee.


I walked back to my house and questioned if I should call her.



Sarah's POV


I was walking into a starbucks when I saw this dude who seemed sad and lonely, he was cute too. I walked up to him, shot my shot, and now I think he likes me.


Hold on, I think hes calling!


Eeee I don't know what to do!!


I'll just answer..


"Hello?"


"Hi uhh Sarah?


"Yes this is Sarah."


"I was wondering if you wanted to come over?"


"Yes of course!"


This would happen over the course of 2 years until Sarah had confessed her love for Micheal, the both started dating and Sarah started nagging him about a marrige.


This started to scratch at Micheals temper leading up to his planning week.


Micheal's POV


Day 1 of planning her murder


I wonder how she will scream.
Im planning on bringing her to the hills but a part where her screams can't be heard..
Ooh I know, those hills next to the hudson river!!
Perfect..



Day 2 of planning her murder.


What weapon should I bring? Should I knock her out ooh I don't know, a knife, a rapier? A katana? No..
I'll just bring a cleaver..



Day 3 if planning her murder.


She keeps nagging me about a FUCKING MARRIGE so im shortening the planning to 5 days..


Im going to mutilate and bury her, yeah and I won't tell anybody about my whereabouts.



Day 4 of planning her murder.


I'm going to drive there with the ring case exposed so she thinks I am going to propose...


Day 5 of planning her murder.


The final day..

Tomorrow I am going to end her life.



Im going to bring a shovel, a tarp, gloves, and a hazmat suit..


The day of Sarah's murder.


"Baby do you want to go to the hills next to the Hudson? I have a surprise if you go!"


"Of course Micheal!!"


She said it with so much emotion you could tell she thought I was going to propose to her. How funny..



30 minutes later we had arrived to the hills, there was tarp covering a shovel and a hazmat suit hidden near the


"Look at the sunrise, its mesmerizing"


I grabbed the cleaver I had hidden behind my back and powered up a swing..


I swung and just like that, her life was over.


I took a few more swings before letting her die off.


I had pre dug a hole and I shoved her body in there after cutting of her head and her legs. I threw her head and legs into the ocean.


I put the tarp over her body and put the dirt back.


I walked to the car with her phone and as soon as I started the car, I got a phone call from her phone.



"Sarah?"


"Sarah's not here right now."

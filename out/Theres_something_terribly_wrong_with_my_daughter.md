 

My daughter, Josie, has just turned 6 years old. She's always been a really daring and curious kid. She was never scared to do anything, always willing to do everything that came her way, always up and running, but ever since her sixth birthday party, she hasn't been herself. Last night, at around 9pm, my wife and I had just put Josie down to sleep. After we each gave her a good hug and kiss, tucked her in, we went downstairs to go watch our show. We turned on the TV, sat down on the couch with each other, and started to watch. As we were watching our show, we heard loud door slam upstairs, and following after it, a bloodcurdling scream. Of course, we both rushed upstairs in a heartbeat to go see what was wrong. 

My elder daughter, Megan, was crying hysterically in front of the door of Josie's room. I quickly hugged her and asked her what the problem was. She started blabbering, but I could hardly understand a word she was saying because of all the crying. I told her to slow down, take a deep breath and tell me what's wrong. "Something is wrong with Josie! I was walking from the bathroom and went to check on her, but then-" Before Megan could finish, my wife opened the door to Josie's room. My wife let out a big scream.

I went to go look, and what I saw was horrific. Josie was sitting the other way, but with her head turned looking back at us. She was just blankly staring, not saying a word. It almost looked like her eyes had turned red. Of course I freaked out. I had never seen anything like this before, she looked like she came straight out of a freak horror movie. Sure, she was acting really weird after her birthday, but it hadn't been like this. She would just stare into space for a long period of time, talk to herself, become really pale, look deeply sick, get dizzy, and just been really shy, and not her usual happy and bubbly self. We took her to the doctors, but they said she was perfectly ok and healthy. We had no idea why Josie was acting so strangely. The next morning, we took Josie to the hospital. We explained to the doctor everything, what Josie did last night, all her weird behaviour, everything. The doctor looked shocked, like he had never heard such news.

We were waiting for an answer from the doctor. What was happening to my baby girl? The doctor's decided it would be best to run a few tests on Josie, to see how she was mentally, physically, etc. It took a few days for the test results to come back, and when they did, it came back as nothing. I threw the papers down on the counter in frustration. 

There's something obviously wrong with my child, why is nobody accept my family acknowledging it? We took her to an even bigger hospital. What'd we get? Nothing. The mental hospital, what'd we get? Nothing but meds. Me and my wife thought it through, and decided to try and put Josie on the meds. 1 an hour, the doctor told us, and that's what we did. It wasn't what we expected at all, Josie got worse. She started to act out, throw things, scream, temper tantrums, and the same symptoms she had before the meds too.

 She hadn't done anything like she did that one horrific night again, but we never know what could happen. My wife broke down in tears, not knowing what else to do. I quickly went to comfort her, reassuring her that'll be okay, and I'm sure Josie will get the right help that she needs. The family had been a mess, so we decided it would be safer if we took Josie off the meds. But yet, she was still acting strangely. We had to keep her from school for just a bit until she got better. We don't know what to do anymore. We've tried everything. She's been acting like this ever since her birthday, we've tried talking to her about it but she hasn't said a word. Nothing bad happened to her on birthday, we kept her in our sight at all times, didn't let her wander off with anybody, nothing. We're praying for her, and really hope she doesn't do anything paranormal again like she did that on specific night.

Welp.

I'm not gonna beat around the bush. I know you're still stalking me Luke, looking at my digital footprint like a real creep. That used to bother me, maybe even scare me a little, but now I'm pretty happy that I can be sure this message will reach you.

My mama always said: “Look on the bright side, girly.” And I’m trying to, really, but the only optimistic thing I can come up with is that you owe me 20 bucks.

Do you remember that ‘debate’ we got into freshman year? You know, one of the stupid drunken ones that involved more yelling than talking?

I guess we had a lot of those, huh? Probably too many for you to guess what I’m talking about without me narrowing the scope. Well, I’ll get what satisfaction I can out of this by saying: 

I was right.

It’s the teeth, Luke. That’s what does it. Well, specifically, it’s the upper canines, but they’re teeth all the time.

You thought it was blood, didn’t you? You said it must contain some sort of toxin… or maybe you’d said a poison? But either way, nope. It’s got nothing to do with that. They aren’t running around with ‘poison blood,’ Luke. It’s all got to do with the teeth.

I know this for sure because if it had to do with the blood, Paula would be changing too.

Changing like me.

If you’re still the same, still tracking my digital footprint, I’ll bet you think that I can’t know this. I bet you’re laughing, maybe thinking my ‘protozoan’ brain could jump to such a conclusion. Perhaps you even think I’m crazy for claiming certainty over something so absurd and fantastical.

And maybe I am crazy.

After all, before I decided to start typing this… um…. Let’s call it a notice of debt. Before that, I tore into the freezer, draining a delicious T-bone steak so my mind would stop insisting that Whiskers looked like a snack.

Ugh.

I’d apologize for that not making sense, but you don’t deserve it.

You never apologized for what you said. Why should I?

Anyway. 20 bucks, Luke. 

If you need the proof, I still have a tooth—just one. You know where I work. I don’t even care that it’ll violate the restraining order. See there. Fuck the restraining order; you can come. I put it in writing. Doesn’t that make you happy, Luke?

Come to the office. I’ve got the tooth in an envelope. If you think I’m lying, fine. I’ll open it up, and you can press it into your skin and become just like me.

Allergic to the sun.

Craving blood.

No longer able to eat garlic bread.

Unless you’ve developed taste in the last year, I guess you wouldn’t care so much about that last one. 

But I do. 

I love garlic bread. And sunsets. And being able to pet Whiskers without thinking her heartbeat sounds appetizing. 

God. You don’t know how much you feel on a subconscious level until it’s gone. The lack of breath or blood running through my veins…

Luke, dating you, and I say this with great trepidation, is no longer the biggest mistake of my life.

Again, notice that I said great trepidation. 

You are still awful and always will be.

Anyway, what I’m counting as number one now is accepting the freak patient who came in last week.

I’m sure even you know that dentist offices are appointment-only (I.e., no walk-ins), but I had a last-minute cancellation.

I was upfront, talking with Paula, and enjoying a break when this dude came in. His skin was sallow and jaundiced. The top of his bald head was a constellation of puss-filled heat blisters. In his hands, he held a styrofoam cup full of a pink liquid that looked vaguely like strawberry milk. I’d learn later that I only got the milk part right.

“I neeth hep!” The creep shouted, and his mouth was full of blood. He spat it all over Paula, spraying her librarian-style glasses with red.

His front four teeth had been knocked out. Who knows how. The man didn’t show up the entire time he was there, but I barely understood a goddamn word between his freak accent and lack of teeth.

But whatever.

Dr. Martin saw him and immediately rushed to the man’s aid. It was weird, but I guess it was a simple case of that philanthropic side he’s been developing rearing its head at the worst possible moment. Instead of sending the man to the ER, he took him as a patient.

A knocked-out tooth is one of the few emergency procedures a dentist performs, but this man- his bubbling, yellowed skin- it was apparent he had more urgent issues that needed tending.

“This way,” Dr. Martin told him. “My associate Kyra will be assisting with your procedure.”

“She will?” I echoed. It should have been exciting. I was his junior, but, being fresh out of school, I really hadn’t much experience outside of cleanings and being an assistant to the lead dentist.

“You’re ready,” he told me. “Glove up. It’s time to learn.”

So yeah. Here’s where it goes wrong, Luke. Just like that night I took you to my parents. I didn’t expect anything to go wrong that night, either. It was supposed to be happy. That was the Thanksgiving when you thought it’d be better to silently pop a pizza in the oven rather than eat my mom’s cooking. Then you actually had the nerve to say to her face: “Sorry, I just wanted to eat something I could stomach.”

You piece of shit.

I swear. If I can’t fucking control this hunger, I’ll find you. I wouldn't even feel bad about it.

Where was I?

Oh yeah. The teeth.

Dr. Martin gently took the cup from the man and handed it to me. “You’ve really done it now,” he said to the man, and I wondered how they knew each other. “Kyra, you’ll find all four teeth in there. We must move quickly before his gums begin to close.”

And that didn’t make sense. He was still spitting blood as he talked with the doctor. His teeth had been knocked out recently. Obviously, this procedure needed to take place quickly, but his gums would take a while to close.

Dr. Martin didn’t bother with anesthesia or even numbing the man. He just went straight in, spraying away the blood. Meanwhile, I had fished the first three teeth out of the cup. Two were… normal. Just regular old human teeth. Standard incisors, but then the third.

“What the fuck?” I breathed. 

It was a canine as long as my pinky. I looked at the holes in the man’s mouth, disturbed to see that the weirdo’s gums were being rapidly knitted back together. 

I looked from the teeth to the man. His upper four teeth. That’s what was missing. There shouldn’t have been any canines included. I could see his canines from here, sharp pointy things that did look a little too long but nothing as shocking as what I held in my hand.

“Have you got them?” Dr. Martin urged with a gloved hand extension. “The teeth?”

Sirens went off in my head, but the man’s cries were louder.

“The teeth, Kyra!”

“Sorry,” I told him and placed the three I had in his hand. “Here they are.”

He shuffled them carefully, holding the canine delicately. “Now, watch carefully. You’ll have to do as I do.”

Before I could respond, he jammed the canine into the wrong spot… the wrong way. He sliced open the gum with the sharp end and then forced it to go nearly all the way into the gum. As he pulled it out with a wet squelch, I clearly saw the man’s gums moving, trying to repair the hole. In opposition to its healing, Dr. Martin shoved in the yellowed incisor.

“There,” he told the man. “One down.”

He made a pained noise of affirmation.

“Now,” Dr. Martin turned to me with the teeth pointing at me like daggers. “You do the next one, Kyra.”

The step I took back wasn’t a conscious one, but I felt myself moving away from him. From this nightmare scene.

I always run. I run when things get tough. Get scary. You know that, Luke. I ran from you. Picked up whiskers and flew out the door like a bat from hell. 

And maybe if I’d been just a split second faster. Maybe if my brain and feet had had the same thought, I wouldn’t be here. I’d be at work, business as usual. Scraping plaque off teeth and earning an honest buck, but nope. I’m obviously shit at ignoring red flags. I stayed, and now the only good thing I can think to do is write this shitty debt notification, hiding beneath the covers because I bought sheer curtains for the bedroom. Fucking hell do I regret choosing this place for its goddamn natural light.

Not as much as I regret you. Of course. And not as much as I regret what happened next.

The man grabbed my arm, shrieking at me: “Huvwy! Huvwy!! Pleath!” Urging me to hurry up, Dr. Martin placed the remaining two teeth into my open palm.

“You can do this, Kyra,” he told me. “Just like I did, you have to do it just like that.”

My hands were shaking so badly. The tooth felt heavy in my hands.

“Focus, Kyra!” the doctor ordered. “Take the vampire’s tooth-“ And yes. He said, vampire. “Very carefully, and make a slice into the dead center of the gum.”

With a gentle grip on my wrist, he guided my hand, and it took little more than a jerk for the tooth to cut through the man’s pink flesh. Blood sprayed out. Later, I realized this meant he had just eaten. 

“Now! Quickly Kyra, before his regeneration reseals the wound, you need to get the incisor into the socket.”

My brain, I’m ashamed to say, had basically short-circuited. I was covered in blood, a man was screaming beneath me, and Dr. Martin was being so different from the distant, bespectacled man I’d worked with for the past month.

“Now, Kyra!”

So yes. I did what he told me to. My body was practically on autopilot, but I remember how man trembled. I held one of his shoulders down, leaning over him for leverage, and I jammed the incisor in that gaping, bleeding socket. He screamed so loud, his body wracked with short, sharp sobs that ran through him in tremors.

“Again,” Dr. Martin told me. “I’ll show you how and then you will do the next.” He took the tooth from my hand, that long dagger forged of pearl. 

The man below was crying. I still couldn’t fully understand him, but I think he was saying he was running out of time.

Dr. Martin didn’t even look at him. “This solution, Kyra, is a proprietary blend. He swished around a beaker full of green liquid with a separation that suggested it contained both water and a lipid within. “It stings, but it’ll get the job done.”

To my horror, he popped off the cap to the beaker and then poured it directly onto the man’s gum. If he was screaming before, now was different. He was wailing, shrieking. His mouth extended far beyond the boundaries of what an average human can. His chin brushed against his collarbone as he writhed in pain. I noticed for the first time that his molars were not normal. Each one was a pointed tip, looking like jagged, broken glass. His gum had turned a deep shade of black above the empty sockets.

“Good,” Dr. Martin said. “Now, that’s the benefit of mixing an activator with an elixir. Think of this like the Sudan IV test. This shows us that the binding agents present in the iron can still be reattached, and the patient is already prepped. Observe.”

I heard it. I can repeat what he said, but do I fucking understand? No. Do I want to? No. And if I’m losing you, Luke. Well. I’m fucking lost myself. All the way lost.

Dr. Martin pulled out a golden scalpel from his pocket with what appeared to be a ruby embedded in the handle and strange runes carved everywhere, including the blade. As he moved it into the man’s mouth, those runes began to glow, and a peculiar humming sound was much louder than the usual din of machinery emitted from seemingly nowhere.

“The color is changing rapidly, Kyra. That means we need to work quickly.”

The gums were still dark, but they had faded from black to a deep shade of purple. The man cried silent tears, gripping the chair’s handles with white knuckles. I sucked in a deep breath, my brain finally starting to reboot.

Of course, this was the worst time to come to my senses because I was about to witness what can only be described as torture. Dr. Martin gingerly placed the Golden tip of the scalpel in the center of the gap. He readjusted it a few times, poking at the spot in an almost experimental way before he made a contented sound. 

“Okay,” he told me. “The drill spot has been found. Now comes the hard part.”

He applied pressure to the scalpel, rotating it round and round like a slow drill as he synchronized farther into the gum. The purple-black flesh shredded in a spiral pattern, like pencil shavings.

“You’ve got to be precise.” He was talking through the whole thing, but I could hardly hear him above the screaming and, worse… the crunching. After sinking about an inch and a half into the man, a loud scrape, like nails on a chalkboard, resounded. My gut dropped. He was scratching against the man’s vomer bone, but unfortunately, his goal was apparently to go beyond it. He kept rotating the scalpel, applying more pressure, and then the cracking and the crunching started—that sickening splintering of bone.

It feels like that moment went on forever. In every moment of silence since, I’ve heard that awful sound repeating, echoing through my head. I’ve been trying to drown it out with music, but…

God. It was horrible.

I thought the darkest period of my life was you. I didn’t think I could ever go beyond rock bottom, but that. That brought me lower.

Again. I just don’t know how long that scalpel drilling lasted, but after Dr. Martin was satisfied with the hole he’d made, he took the ‘vampire’ tooth and, much more carefully than he’d treated the incisor, placed it into the heathen socket. The man was breathing hard, his chest rising and falling like it was trying to keep up with an upbeat dubstep song.

“Perfect,” Dr. Martin smiled. “We should be able to get the other one too.”

The gum with the tooth planted firmly inside was back to an irritated shade of pink, but the empty socket was a deep shade of lavender.

“Of course, we’ll need to start now.” He gave the scalpel a hard flick, and a visceral mess of pink and red plopped inches away from my feet. “Kyra, get the other tooth. I’ll begin the initial incision and show you how to finish it.”

I could barely tear my eyes away as he poked and prodded at the pink with his scalpel, just as he had done before. Guess I’ve always had a thing for watching disasters, huh? I mean, why else would I willingly look at you for as long as I did?

Anyway. I got the milk cup. It still looked like it was strawberry-flavored, but now I was pretty sure it wasn’t. I stuck my hand in and-

“Ow!” I shrieked. My blue gloves were sliced open. There was a long, deep gash on my middle three fingers. “Fuck!” It really didn’t hurt that bad. There was an initial sting, but it was like… Do you remember when you were throwing beer bottles, and one of the shards bounced back?

How the glass cut your cheek deep, but you didn’t even feel it? You yelled at me when I ran out, crying about the blood, but you didn’t even realize you had been injured. Well, that’s probably partially because your dumb ass head is so dense but also because the glass was so sharp you didn’t feel it.

That’s what this was like. It was so sharp that I hardly even felt it. I saw the blood filling the fingertips of my gloves, dripping onto the white linoleum floor, but I didn’t really feel it.

“Kyra!” Dr. Martin yelled. “Oh my god! Please tell me you didn’t cut yourself on the tooth.” The scalpel clattered to the ground, and he snatched the milk cup from my hand. He dumped its contents onto the writhing man’s chest. The tooth was just as long and white as the first. 

The blood splashed onto the floor. I was bleeding so much. Too much, even for the deep gash. The blood was literally spraying out of me. 

The man sat up, horror shining in his eyes. I barely had time to register his gums-all the way pink now- before the world went black. Distantly, I could hear Dr. Martin yelling at me, giving instructions that my heavy body could not follow.

The following day I woke up in Dr. Martin’s basement. And yeah, I’ll get to that, but one thing has been bothering me. How the fuck did they get me out, past Paula, and to his home?

Like, what the fuck did Paula think? I haven’t asked cause… Well, it feels weird but damn. She didn’t stop them. The businesses surrounding the office didn’t try to call the cops. Like, I know there’s a slight family resemblance between Dr. Martin and me, but no one had an issue with a bloody girl being carried away by the single most disturbing individual I’ve seen in my life and my short, hobbling uncle?

It really makes you wonder what’s wrong with people.

And, just so you know, I have lowered my viewpoint on how bad the average person is, but that doesn’t change what I think of you. Everyone sucks, but you suck most of all.

Yeah, I get the irony. Me saying people suck.

Anyway, Uncle Bill- I only think of him as Dr. Martin in office- literally went the whole nine yards. Fricking chains on my ankles. Called my parents. Made my grandma cry cause now I’m…

You know.

Changed.

Everyone came over dressed in black and I swear it felt like attending my own funeral. I was still pretty in the dark and growing agitated at the chains. I tried being polite, pretending everything was normal, but my stomach felt emptier than ever.

“Fucking get me some food!” I shrieked, and I hardly recognized my voice. It echoed so much deeper than I was used to.

“Heavens, It’s true! You’re a vampire now,” Mom sobbed. “My little girl!”

And my Uncle Bill presented me with the tooth. The dumb tooth that started this. I noticed at the root of it was a strange symbol. 

“This is what made you like this, Kyra.” He placed it in my hand. There was no sound where I had been cut. “You’ll soon grow fangs of your own and have to feed on blood. Your teeth will be just as capable of initiating the same change in other organisms. This is why you must be taught to control your urges….”

And he kept going. On and on and on. Uncle Bill droned about vampires, then Aunt Linda or mom or grandma would cut in, and they’d keep it going. Apparently, my family has been taking care of vampire teeth for years. Like as far back as we can trace our heritage, generation after generation of Martins have been vampire dentists.

Isn’t that fucking stupid?

And why the fuck did no one tell me?

Yeah, you can bet I voiced these concerns. I yelled and cursed and threw a tantrum like I was 17. Like I’d just met a dumbass named Luke and wanted to devote every single aspect of my life to his out-of-date, boy-band-styled hair. The screaming didn’t do anything other than make me feel silly.

What’s done is done.

I was changed, and the changes kept churning out from there. Everything has been turned around, and my jaw has been aching worse than it did when I got spacers. The teeth are finally in.

I’m thoroughly inhuman. I’m something different than J was before. I look in the mirror, and I hardly recognize the thing looking back at me. I almost wish that reflection part of the myth was genuine; then, I wouldn’t have to face those hollow eyes.

So, yeah… 20 dollars.

You were wrong, Luke. I didn’t know it would be the teeth, but I knew it wasn’t poison or whatever. That means I won the bet—the stupid bet over one of those shitty twilight movies.

I win.

It’s the teeth. There’s power in the teeth. 

I hope you don’t believe me. I really do. I bet you think this is all a desperate cry to get your attention, don’t you? You think you’re that important. Well, I’ll let you believe what you want.

See me, Luke. Let me show you my teeth and prove I won. Don’t believe me still? Well, I wouldn’t mind performing a demonstration one goddamn bit.

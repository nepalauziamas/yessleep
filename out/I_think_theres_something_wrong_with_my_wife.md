I, (25M) and my wife (23F) have been living in our Victorian home for quite a few years now, everything has been normal. She's a strange woman, sure. She likes dead things but never has she done this before.

Five days from my wife's favorite Holiday, she was putting up decorations just above our beautiful mantle, our sweet kids helping her.. she was so proud of herself we took our first Christmas photo, When she was cooking dinner, that's when it started. She started wheezing or breathing heavy. I tried to help but she shooed me off and overall wanted to be left alone, okay weird. So , later that night she's now coughing to the point she's gagging. She refuses a doctor, I know why but- it's personal, after that we just went to bed.. nothing else.

Dec, 21st.

That day was even weirder, she was now angrier and she was still breathing and coughing weird. She threw up a couple times because of her excessive coughing. I again, try helping but she's now snapping at me about it, so as she requests I just leave her be and distract the kids. I had a feeling I knew what was coming, but I was wrong. 

Dec, 22nd.

December 22nd, everything was worse. She was now yelling at the kids and I, she was lashing out and made quite a few empty threats, her physical symptoms got worse, she was coughing up blood and the whites of her eyes now had a red hue, all over. I pointed it out to her when she was  calm, she freaked out causing her to get angry at me, great. Her breathing has became faster and she's now sweating a lot. Fucking scary.

Dec, 23rd.

She decided to carry out some of her bold threats on me from the 22nd. Nothing awful it was just sad to see my wife changing, I felt bad because I didn't understand. I wasn't mad at her because I thought she was going through something she couldn't tell me and she was taking her anger out on me, that's what I thought until I saw her eyes. Her iris was pure black and the whites of her eyes are now pure red. I'm horrified of her. She isn't hurting anyone, yet.

Dec, 24th.

I will never forget Christmas Eve. I woke up around 12 AM on Christmas Eve, I heard crunching from the kitchen, and since Hera, my wife, was out of bed I figured she had been eating the cookies we set out too early, I scoffed and got up to stop her so I could make a new batch so the kid's wouldn't notice. When I got to the kitchen I called out to her, the crunching stopped and I only heard weak wheezy breathing, I knew it was her. I called out again and what came out of the kitchen was not my wife. There stood a tall winged beast. It had the figure of a woman but it's skin was coal black with what seemed to be something red and wet on her arms and face. The face that stared back at me was nothing like my wifes, even if the beast was her.. I don't think she was in there. Her teeth were sharp and her eyes were wide. I looked inside the kitchen and there I saw, my babies. Eaten. I was mortified, I screamed at her in pure anger, my babies. My sweet babies. Jesse and Olive, eleven and nine years old, Olive was turning ten. Soon, if this fucking monster hadn't eaten them. In my rage of anger I realized what was happening, and it hit me. I fell back and looked at the creature in horror. I wasn't sure what to do, anymore. I just got up and ran out of the door, I ran as fast as I could, hearing her screams, my wife's screams.. from the house, I didn't look back even though I screamed and cried. She wasn't my wife anymore.

Dec, 25th.

I went back to the house, I woke up on the side of the road and retraced my steps. The door was shut, but unlocked. I walked in and my wife and my kids bodies were gone. But, there was two big mounds of dirt in my yard. Merry Christmas.

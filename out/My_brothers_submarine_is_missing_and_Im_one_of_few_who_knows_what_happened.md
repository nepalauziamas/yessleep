So my brother works for a research agency that researches deep sea noise waves or something like that and recently he sent me a very strange video message about a recent expedition he went on. I'm unsure what to do with this info and don't want to get in any trouble. I showed my mom and she got a far away look in her eye and told me I must never speak of what happened but I'm worried about my brother. I don't know if he's dead or not and I don't want him to be buried in a submarine floating in the ocean somewhere. I'm just so scared and what him home. 


So, I'm asking you all to take a look at this message(I've transcribed it for simplicity reasons) , what do you think I should do with this?

"A few weeks ago we were tasked by the United States government with investigating a strange noise that came from the Mariana Trench. If anyone gets this transmission or message from the transcripts please let the world know what we found here or more so what found us. "


" This began a few days ago, we were all so excited at the promise of a big pay day and a story of a lifetime. What was making all this noise from the trench? Other researchers had come to try figuring it out as this has been in the news for a few years now but the only thing they could come up with is that it was whales. The crew and I all talked about this as it made sense that it could be a type of whale but then why exactly was the US government themselves sending us here? What did they know about this that everyone else didn't?"


" That question was one that pondered us as we got closer and closer to the Mariana Trench. If only we knew what I know now, maybe I could have saved them or done something. "


" Yesterday we dropped down hydrophones which are essentially underwater microphones used to pick up noises in layman's terms. Ours are a bit more fine tuned to pick up any kind of signal or noise that may be made down there and what we heard caught all of us off guard…we heard a woman's voice singing. It was in a language that none of us had ever heard before and was truly magical. The amount of times we listened to that clip was–


*Thump*

*Thump*


A noise that sounded as if someone or something was pounding on the steel door or wall rang out so loud my brother couldn't be heard for a second. He turned around and looked at the steel door. His face looked as if he was experiencing pure fear. He turned to face the camera and continued discussing the events but as he did so his face was covered with droplets of sweat which grew more sporadic as he spoke. Every so often his head would whip backwards and face the door. He started a sentence multiple times about what happened next but kept trailing off as if he were distracted by something or caught in a daze. 


The video cut to static for a moment and when it returned my brother was pressed against the steel door humming to himself while caressing the door handle. I heard other voices coming from the hallway but couldn't make them out. My brother then suddenly looks at the camera. His teeth look jagged and his eyes are filled with blood. "I deserve this." his gaze is on the camera for what feels like an eternity. Watching the video filled my heart with fear. The video cuts to static once again and he's rocking back and forth in a chair he was sitting in originally before continuing as if nothing happened. 


"Well shortly after weird shit began to happen. I vomited endlessly and was basically bound to the toilet where I eventually fell asleep there. How that happened I have no idea but that was the only real issue that I had. The other crew members all fell asleep very shortly after listening to the music and when I say everyone I mean the entire crew. Now something to note is that usually half of us are awake at any given time so the submarine can run properly. With everyone asleep who knows what could happen." his eye was slowly becoming filled with blood and it made it hard to even look at him without my eyes watering. 


"When I woke I climbed out of the bathroom and there was a green slime everywhere. Tendrils spread out from people and connected to the steel walls as if they were roots trying to find water. I looked at a nearby crew mate and he was cocooned. His body wrapped in a green string like web. I tried to grab it but stung my hands. I heard singing echoing from off the ships hallways. It didn't sound like it was from the recording this time though it was as if whatever we had heard was in this vessel. I began to walk towards the hallway when the singing went from a very calm and beautiful pace to a blood curdling scream. I ran into the hallway covering my ears and there stood a girl. Her flesh was blue and hair black. Her eyes were a solid white and water dripped from her body endlessly. Her clothes were made of crushed and molded coral. I was stunned beyond belief. How was a little girl out here? I could feel blood pooling down my neck from my ears and felt the popping of my ear drums as I tried to protect them in any way I could. I heard a faint crushing noise and felt a thump against the floor. I turned to face the sleeping quarters room I had just left and there stood my crew mates, their eyes white and jaws held open. Their teeth were covered in a slime that dropped from their jaws onto the floor as they began to stumble their way towards me. Each step they took I could hear, albeit faintly, the sloshing of their skin slapping against the floor. See, their skin now looked as if it was too big for them. It dropped off them just enough for skin to slap the floor, and leave a wet stain behind it like a towel filled with water."


"I ran as fast as I could down the hall opposite of where the girl was. As soon as I turned my back I heard her take off into a sprint. Her tiny feet were pattering against the steel floor and she was closing in on me. I didn't dare to even look behind me but I could feel the chill her body radiated closing in on me. I spun around a corner and saw the communications room. I could hear her feet make a sudden stop but in her stead I heard what was once my crewmates marching towards me. 'tell the world Michael.' is the voice that echoed in my skull. It was the girls voice and I turned to fave her as I was shutting the door. She just was standing there, five feet away, smiling. Her pearl white eyes staring at me like white voids. I slammed the door and that's where I am now.. "


A scream rang out in the hallway behind my brother. He looks back and begins to sob,"go away! Please, I can't do this." he sobs for a few minutes, the entire time you can hear screams and things slamming against the door. 


"Michael, you can't hide from us forever." one gurgly voice said. 


"We know you're hungry Michael" another gurgly voice echoed out. It sounded like when you try talking while you have water or toothpaste in your mouth. They sounded off and just their voices was enough to send shivers down my spine. 


"I don't have much time now. I need to try to send this out. I'm sending it to all of the crew's recent contacts. If you get this please let people know that the government knows there's a different being down here. It makes people into mindless husks that obey their commands. Lord knows what the US would do if this fell into their hands. Please do not try to find me. I will be gone most likely by the time you get this. Adam if you get this just know I'm so sorry I couldn't make it to your wedding. You're the best brother I could have ever had. Mom, dad, I love you both. Please know I tried so hard to make you–"


The transmission cuts out and fades to static. You can hear growls and a little girl's voice for a moment but that's all that is in the transmission.

I don't know if my brother is dead or alive or worse. I have no idea if I should take this to every news station that will give me the time of day over something this far fetched or what. Please, I need to know what happened to my brother. I need to know and I need to have him found. It doesn't sit right with me if his grave was a submarine.

You gotta think of them as like animals, or you’ll never last at the job.

We were conditioned to think that way. It was part of our training. 

I was three years in with the marines when I got the assignment. I’d seen a little combat. Overseas. And I’d seen some shit. I’d peered into a bottomless chasm or two, nearly wound up in a couple of X Files, if you’ll excuse the technical terminology.

So, when I was offered a position back at home, I jumped at it. A few strange working requirements? No problem. As long as I wasn’t surrounded by endless fields of sand and the locals talking that nonsense shit I refused to learn, I’d put up with whatever hazardous working conditions they could throw at me.

No windows? Fine with me.

Gotta wear these weird masks so we can’t even see each other’s eyes? No problem.

Breathing recycled oxygen and never getting to see the sky? Bring it on.

Next thing you know, you’re just standing back and watching as a couple of your… coworkers… are beating up some little kid, or shoving them into an airlock.

Next thing you know, you’re doing all that, and worse, and not even registering it as something unusual. 

It’s crazy, what you can learn to live with.

…

A couple weeks into the job, one of the lab geeks noticed me hesitating before I hit one of the smaller kids. It was twelve years old. Malnourished. Scared. I raised my baton up, fourteen inches of inch-thick lead, coated in a half-inch of rubber. And I hesitated, for just a second, before I hit the child.

So later, the lab geek took me aside and explained shit to me. Wrinkly old fuck with beady rat eyes peering out wildly from behind a giant pair of thick-lensed glasses that were coated in greasy fingerprint smudges.

He tells me, they’re not children. They’re not people. They’re not human. I needed to get any of those ideas out of my head, right away, he told me. What they are, is something that is attempting to replicate the appearance of humans, as part of an invasion. They are germs in the body. An alien intrusion. 

Don’t think of them as children, or people, or humans. 

Think of them as animals. 

Think of them as an enemy. 

Think of them as an affront to our entire species. Not just our country, but our whole world. 

They think they can just walk in here, and look like us, and act like us, and take our stuff? 

Fuck them, and fuck that.

Sure, they tell you all that stuff. 

But what we’re handling, they still look like little kids.

I was on corpse-burning detail for a couple of weeks after that, and you can believe me, the next time I was given an option to strike a participant, I did not hesitate.

Participants, that’s something we called them, but we always said it in this snide, insulting way. Like it was our little inside joke. Like how you might call a prisoner a volunteer.

So, everybody wants to know, what kind of tests were you doing?

Around the shop, we said we were building windows and doors. 

Windows, you could look through.

Doors could be passed through.

Windows and doors.

Made out of flesh and bone. 

That’s no exaggeration either. That’s literally the case. I remember there was this big arched gate that’d been built out of the pieces from sixteen different spines, mostly all left whole, so you could sorta make out a faint impression of the bodies they’d once been part of. Nothing ever came out through that doorway though, so it was considered a failure. About thirty participants went into it, from our side, but nothing ever came back out.

There was a window that’d been made by wiring a participant’s skull, just this tiny little thing no larger than my hand, to a giant car battery and some sort of miniaturized particle accelerator. When you looked into the skull, you could see this weird shimmering darkness, and one of the lab geeks told me it was an alien sky. He said that when you looked down into the skull, you were looking up at an alien sky, full of alien stars. 

They made other stuff down there too. They made other stuff out of human bodies. Some of them were still alive during the process, and a few even survived.

The thing that got loose and killed those campers in the woods, I think it used to be some parent, who’d come snooping around, looking for their kid. We got a few of those every year, plus some journalists and the occasional conspiracy nut. 

We pick them up during security sweeps, take them back to the base, and let the lab geeks use them for whatever’s the project de jour. Genetic splicing. Hormonal therapies. Taking out organs, and replacing them with synthetic replicas that’d been grown in goats. I don’t think any of those ever worked, but they sure took a long time to die. Made of a hell of a lotta paperwork, too. Fun stuff to read. 

8:30AM - subject coughs up blood

8:35AM - subject coughs up more blood

8:40AM - after five days of begging to die, subject expired

Not that I was ever the one taking the notes, I was just security. I polished my own boots, kept my baton clean, and nobody asked me to write anything down. In fact, writing in general was frowned upon, for those of us working security. No letters, no notes, no communication that couldn’t be one person speaking to another. And even that was all done with our faces hidden behind those masks with the built-in goggles, so there still wasn’t any actual eye-contact.

All according to a plan. A big master plan from the Man In Charge. 

I never met him. He was some paranoid freak who lived in his office and actually ate the same slop we were feeding to the participants. High in vitamins and fibre, low on flavour. Somebody told me the Man In Charge had invented the stuff himself, but I never knew what to believe about anything. There were always crazy rumours going around. Hell, I heard a good one about how one of the security guys was actually a werewolf, only for the geek telling me the tale to reveal at the end of the story that the untrustworthy guard he was talking about was actually me, and he just didn’t know it.

To be straight with you, I am not a werewolf. I was just pretending to be a wolf this one time, to scare one of the participants. Again, we’re encouraged to do weird shit like that, to mess with their heads.

One guy, we caught him doing stuff to the participants, like touching them and stuff. He claimed he’d been instructed to do it, by the Man In Charge. He claimed that he was supposed to be doing it, as part of a new experiment. He kept swearing that he’d just been doing his job, even as we beat him to death with our batons. Me and two other guys. 

I don’t even know why we did it, why we killed him. We’d all done just as bad if not worse things. But we at least had the decency to not look like we’d enjoyed it. He’d left the lower half of his mask peeled up, so you could see his leer of uneven teeth. 

We got rid of the body the same way we got rid of all the other bodies. We call it the Lava Chamber; it was basically a giant vat full of this super-conductive plasma. It can evaporate bones into steam instantly. Very toxic. Just being in the same room at that stuff took years off your life, like you’re smoking five packs of unfiltered cigarettes in about twenty minutes.

The participants have no names, just numbers and letters, usually paired with a colour. A-32-orange. R-15-black. If those listings correspond with any kind of code, I don’t know about it. They’re all in matching grey jumpsuits with the participants’ code written on patches that are sewn to the front and back of the jumpsuits.

If I had to, I’d say the worst part of the job is working the airlocks. See, some of the doorways aren’t pressurized properly, so there’s airlocks built around them, and you have to use those when the lab geeks wanted one of the kids sent through.

You’re standing at this door sealed with three layers of bulletproof glass, and there’s a keypad next to it, for putting in the entry code and personal ID number and shit like that. After that’s done, there's a hiss as the doors slide open, and the air starts getting sucked in. Or out, whatever, I don’t know how it works. Then you’re just standing there, experiencing an atmospheric vacuum, with nothing tethering you to the earth except a chain you got looped around your waist, the other end attached to the wall. I know it sounds barbaric, but we’ve never lost a man that way. 

The only one of us I ever saw die in an airlock fucked it up himself. He didn’t attach his chain, he just input the code and stood there laughing as the doors opened up. Said the idea had come to him in a dream he kept having, and he was still having it, he was still inside the dream.

When the pressure started to suck him into the doorway, we got the red-light order, and took him out.

You never do doorway work without a gun. That’s another one of the rules. Anything unauthorized comes out through a door, they want you prepared to handle it. Same thing with anything unauthorized, trying to get in from our end.

Me and my partner, who were both chained up like we were supposed to be, put about sixteen shots apiece through the other guy’s face and chest. We were only about twenty feet away from him, it would’ve been harder to have missed at that distance, you know? Even with him floating in the air like a drunk superman. 

He still made it through the doorway, but that was fine. We put dead meat through all the time. Animals mostly. Had no idea what they were doing with the stuff on the other side, but of course, I also had no idea as to who they were. Or if there was a who, or what, on the other side at all. It was all a big mystery, which you weren’t supposed to think about. 

To distract us, we had porn and some video games, all of which had to be sanctioned by the brass and the shrinks who worked our cases. The porn was good, but it was always weird stuff, like with bugs and shit. The video games were almost worse, but at least we were used to that; one of the games was a stealth shooter set in a near-perfect-simulation of the base we were in. That one was real popular; we all showed off how we’d kill each other for hours. Kinda sick, but better than us actually doing it, which is what tended to happen before they started giving us any porn and video games at all, or so I got told by somebody who’d been around back then.

I started having weird dreams almost immediately. It was the same for everybody. A place like that, under those circumstances, of course it’s gonna affect your sleep. It’s a hell of a lot of pressure, psychologically speaking, and if you’re not prepared, it can crush in on you. Warp your perspectives. You do your best to see through it, you know it’s happening, but… You can’t stop your mind from dreaming. 

In one of my dreams, I thought I had it all figured out.

I went snooping around, looking for some files. I had to know, I’d decided. I had to know what was going on. And I found what I was looking for, I found an explanation for everything. Type-written on a single piece of yellow foolscap, in a big manilla envelope.

We were at the forefront of an invasion, is what I read, in my dream. An alien invasion was taking place, and we were working in a space that overlapped with some lucrative enemy territory.

Enemies.

Aliens.

Like E.T., the Extra-Terrestrial. 

Except, these weren’t extra terrestrials. Because that’s childish nonsense. These were referred to as Ultra Terrestrials. Creatures from other dimensions. Other levels of reality. See, nobody was flying through the endless reaches of space to come land here on Earth. They were things that had always been here, and always would be. They lived with us, inside us, outside of us. About as alien as the space between your finger and your thumb. 

But that was all just a dream.

I woke up in one of the labs, some skinny kid in a black lab-coat shining a flashlight in my eyes as they pulled some electro sensors off my face.

They said I’d been sleepwalking, but I checked my watch right after, and if that’d been true, I’d have to have been asleep for at least two days. And it didn’t explain why they’d hooked me up to some kind of neurological device. Like one of the participants. 

Sometimes I feel like I don’t know what’s really real. Not anymore. 

Not long after I started the job, I noticed this mould growing on the wall of the closet of my living quarters. I reported it right away, like we’re told to, like we’re trained to, but it took those lazy assholes sixteen days to come down and check it out. Sixteen days of me breathing in whatever that was, getting its spores into my pores. 

It seemed like a mould, like black mould you see in dank basements, but the more of it that grew… it had this skin, like what forms on old yogurt. But it was like real skin. Human skin. It was as if I was growing a mould of meat. It stank like the way babies stink. I’ve always hated that smell.

Eventually they had to just tear out the whole wall, and replace it. I never got told what that shit actually was, or how it got into my closet.

This is my job. I watch the kids. The participants. I get them up, get them moving down the hall, get them to where they need to be. If they talk back, I hit them. If they even look at me funny, I hit them.

But it’s not like hitting real kids, not for real.

Because they’re not real kids.

They’re animals.

They’re aliens, pretending to be human.

They’re sure not runaways and orphans that get picked up and shipped to us from all over the country.

Because they’re not even real kids.

That’s what we tell ourselves. 

That’s what we tell each other. 

That’s the job.

Sometimes I think about leaving, but I always change my mind. There’s always worse jobs out there, I tell myself. But honestly, I don’t know if there are worse jobs out there than this one.

The scariest part though, is that I think I’m starting to get used to it.

It’s crazy, what you can learn to live with.

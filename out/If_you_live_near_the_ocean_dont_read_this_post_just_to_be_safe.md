>*A friend sent me this email. I read it and made the decision to post it here. I'm sorry.*

(I need you to post this everywhere, okay? Please. It'll make sense why, I promise.)

My wife loves the ocean. We live by it, sort of. We live by a harbour that leads into the ocean, so we don’t get to stare at nothing but water forever.

My wife wanted a place by the ocean proper, but it freaked me out. I gave a lot of excuses that were plausible, y’know? “What about the rising ocean levels because of climate change, we’ll get flooded,” and “We’ll lose the house if there’s a really bad hurricane,” that kind of thing. I didn’t tell her it’s because I think the ocean is absofuckinglutely terrifying, because she loves me, and she wants me to be happy. She wouldn’t have moved out here if she knew. But I love her too, and I want to see her happy without putting me first, so I thought getting a place tucked into a harbour would be a good compromise.

We moved out here, where the salt air peels the paint off our shingles and the fog sweeps in, morning and evening. I’m usually okay with the harbour - I treat it like one big lake. A big, salty lake that has seals sometimes. My wife was so much happier than before so for a while it was worth it.

She likes to walk along the beach. I don’t like walking along the beach so my wife usually goes alone. We were planning to get a dog so she could go on walks with it. I usually make dinner, so she goes while I’m cooking and returns in time for when it’s ready.

Last night she missed dinner. She’s been late a couple of times, but usually she texts me. She knows I worry. She didn’t text me, so I worried. After half an hour, I sucked it up and went looking for her. The fog was dense. I really got to stress that - you couldn’t see five feet in front of you. It wasn’t fully dark out yet, but the grey made the visibility even worse.

I brought a flashlight and had my cell-phone out and kept telling myself it was way too early to call the cops. I called for her a couple of times - 

"Felicity? Felicity!" 

“Adrienne?”

Hearing my own name in her voice made me want to burst and I just started running towards the sound. I almost slipped on the rocks by the beach, but she caught me.

“I was worried, I was so worried - why didn’t you text?” I admit, I should have been more composed but I wasn’t really thinking straight.

“It ate my phone.”

I honestly wasn’t sure what I expected to hear, and it’s not that I thought she was joking with me, but I was very confused. “What?”

She pointed, and through the fog I could see the shape of something. Like I mentioned, we sometimes get seals but not say, walruses, which was my first thought since it was not nearly big enough to be a beached whale. Then I realized that it wasn’t a walrus either. 

Its skin was super pale, like those animals that live in caves, almost translucent. I could see thick dark veins even through the fog, but that was about all I could parse. I literally had no idea what I was looking at, which is basically what I said.

“The hell is that?”

“I don’t know,” she said, and that’s when I noticed how calm she sounded - almost dreamlike. It was weird. She barely opened her mouth when she spoke. “But it ate my phone when I tried to take a picture of it. Then I got into an argument with it, but it's fine now.”

For a second I felt relieved that there was at least an explanation for why she didn’t text, before the rest of that hit me square in the what-the-fuck. Thinking she might have a concussion or something, I tried to stay calm. “What do you mean you got into an argument?”

At that second, a sound came from the thing, and the creepiest thing about it was how soft and sweet the sound was. It was this big, strange animal that barely moved in the fog and it had opened its toothless mouth so wide my whole head could have fit in there, but the sound that came out of it wasn’t some deep bellow it was like a little child saying “ahhhhh” for the dentist.

My wife turned to the thing and said, “I know, I know, I’m going to explain.”

“Can you explain over there?” I tried to pull her away, but she wouldn’t go.

“It doesn’t want us to know it exists.”

There was a sudden, squelching movement as something big and wet slapped the pavement, and the thing made a sound like a little squeak. I couldn’t see it properly through the fog, but there was absolutely no way I was going to get any closer to it.

I tried to whisper to her. “But we… I mean, isn’t that ship already sailed?”

“Humans, it doesn’t want humans to know it exists. It comes to shore to eat. Whenever we saw it, we tried to tell others. It began to eat those things too. It ate our drawings on bark and carvings in stone. It ate our woodcuts and inked maps. It ate our radio signals. It ate our photographs. So it ate my phone, to eat it right at the source.”

I decided to try to wrap head around eating radio signals later, when we were safe. “So… we don’t tell anyone. Problem solved?”

“No, because we’ll remember. But if we die, it will make humans suspicious. Others will search for it, like you searched for me. And it is full. It is so full.”

The thing made that humming noise, and I realized I recognized what it sounded like. It sounded like my wife doing babytalk.

“Honey, how do you know what it wants?”

“Because it ate my tongue,” she said, simply and calmly, and I could see in the dim, misty light her eyes wide with fear. “It replaced it with one of its children” She opened her mouth wide, and for the first time I could see inside her mouth, and something slimy and pale was writhing in there. “You won’t tell anyone, right? You won’t tell anyone about it? This was the only way it would let me walk away. You’ll protect me, Adrienne, right? You’ll protect me?”

I took her home. We climbed into bed, she put on a mask, I think to make me feel better.

I struggled to fall asleep, obviously. I thought about it for a long time. At that beach, in that fog, I meant what I said when I promised the thing I wouldn’t tell anyone about it. I thought we could figure this out. We could learn sign language, so she wouldn’t have to use her mouth. But for those agonizing hours when I knew she was also wide awake beside me, my wonderful, lovely , Felicitfy, infected with a parasite on the whims of that asshole from the deep. My fear and my shock transformed into a full on, bone-deep rage until even that was exhausting.

I did eventually pass out. When I woke up it was noon. Our bed was damp and there were water droplets all over the floor. My wife is not in the house.

I don’t know when she’ll be back. I don’t think I’m going to be able to do this. I think she’s still alive, but I think she’s being held hostage. As long as that thing is alive, my wife and I will be prisoners.

Now, at this point you may be wondering why I’m sending you this. Maybe it’ll eat the internet too - but I don't think so. She said it was already full. I think the only reason I still have my tongue is because it was too full to eat it too.

I’m calling its bluff. I know it’s selfish to risk, but I am not going to let that thing get away with what it did to Felicity. I am terrified, but I am not going to let my fear rule me.

After I send you this, I am going to find my wife, rip that “tongue” out of her, and then kill that thing. But I need to keep it distracted, so post this for me, okay? Spread the word. Overwhelm it.

Wish me luck.

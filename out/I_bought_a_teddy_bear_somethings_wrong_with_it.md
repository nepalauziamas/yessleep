There I was, walking around a yard sale, looking for a birthday gift to get my daughter. I wanted to get her a good gift since I never get to see her after the divorce.

She lives with her mother and she only lets me see her one time a month. And since her birthday was coming up, I wanted to get her something good.

Looking through a box all I could find was junk. Which I should expect since it's a yard sale, and I was about to give up until I saw something. 

I grabbed it and saw it was a teddy bear. It was fluffy and brown with its button eyes looking back at me. I went over to the old man who was hosting the yard sale and asked him how much it was.

He looked at the bear and then back at me. "That bear used to belong to my son and he loved it." He spoke as a tear went down his eye. I assumed his son died and it meant something to him "I'll give it to you for $5."

I smiled and pulled $5 out and gave it to him. "Thanks for doing business with you sir" and walked off. I knew my daughter would love this gift.

When I got home I put it in my closet and wouldn't pull it out until her birthday. That night though I was getting ready for bed and when I was about to get my beauty sleep before work. I heard a bang come from the closet.

I got scared and slowly went over to the closet and slowly opened it. I thought someone was hiding in there, ready to jump out and kill me. But I saw nothing but the teddy bear laying on the floor.

I picked it back up and put it back in its spot and closed the closet door before going to bed. The next day when I was getting ready to go to work I decided to check the closet and noticed the bear was gone. 

"Where the hell did that damn Teddy bear go?"

I decided I would look for it later after work and left. All-day at work, I just kept thinking about the bear wondering where it could have gone? It couldn't have walked on its own, that's for sure. When I was done with work I went home to try and find the bear because I wasn't going to lose my daughter's gift.

I instantly went to the closet and the moment I opened the door there it was. Just, staring at me with those black buttoned-up eyes, but it felt odd like it was looking into my soul. Like it knew what it did.

I tried ignoring it but for the rest of the day, I was terrified to even go near my closet. Like that thing was going to jump out at me and kill me! 

That night I decided to lie down and try to sleep thinking it would help. I started to get sleepy, as my eyes fell shut and I started to drift away in my dreams. I then woke up to a sound, the sound of my closet door opening. All of a sudden, I didn't feel like I was alone, It felt like something was with me.

I slowly reached over to grab my phone on the headstand and turned the flashlight on. I then saw the teddy bear at the end of my bed, holding a butcher knife. I didn't move an inch since I was terrified until the bear stabbed my leg.

The pain was going through my leg and I fucking screamed falling out of my bed. And soon after the bear fucking started talking "Death has come to you, owner." I then fainted afterward, and when I awoke I was being taken out by two paramedics.

I then remembered what happened and started asking where the bear was, but all I got was "What bear?" I then blacked out again and woke up in a hospital bed. I was there for a while healing and when I finally got to go home I forgot all about it. Soon my life eventually went back to normal. 

Until one night when I was getting ready for bed, I got in my bed and turned the lights off. And before I fell asleep I heard my closet door slowly creak open. And my heart dropped when I heard that same voice "Death has come to you, owner."

Well, everyone who wasn't in the bloodline. In-laws, related by marriage and such. It had become a superstition in our town. Story goes is that Benjamin Lowe, my great-great-great-great grandfather, when he built the house, cursed it, so that any intruder to the house would succumb to a horrible fate. It was so that our luxurious house he made himself could stay to the Lowe family, but I think old Benjamin forgot that when you get married, you become part of the family, too. 

So far, Benjamin has kept true to his words. 

My mom fell off a cliff on a camping trip. 

Ryan, my older sister Elizabeth's husband, was struck by a car. 

Ryan's parents, who had moved in with us, choked to death. 

As hard as it was for those people who died, it was hard for me and my four siblings as well, knowing that if we ever found love, we too were cursed. Cursed to watch their ill-fated deaths. 

Thus, my brother Thomas swore himself to celibacy. He promised to never let himself fall in love, never go on dates, not so much as a one-night stand. He didn't want to risk anything. 

My other siblings, Elizabeth and James, were quite the opposite. They threw themselves into love, Elizabeth with Ryan, and James with Nancy.

Nancy had drowned on a vacation to Hawaii. I've never seen James so sad.

My father, after the death of my mother, had tried to get back in the game, but every single woman he met, would meet the same fate that this stupid house gives everyone.

Me, I thought I would be like Thomas. I couldn't do that to anyone. Or at least I thought.

That was until I met Emily. 

She was perfect for me. She was funny, kind, pretty, and loved animals, just like I did. We were talking about adopting cats together, way before we discussed marriage.

Because we all knew how that would end. 

Eventually she popped the question herself. She was tired of waiting for me to do it, so she did it herself, she said.

I, knowing the rule but forgetting it in a moment of pure joy, accepted her offer, and suddenly, Emily was my fiance. 

"Charles, when am I going to meet your family?" Emily asked as we sat in bed watching TV.

"Em, I told you. There's that whole rule with the-"

"I know about the rule." She cut me off. "I've lived in this town my whole life, of course I've heard the stories. But I love you. And I'd do anything for you. Even if that meant dying a horrible death." She said, grabbing my hand.

I sighed. "Okay. You will visit for one week. I'll let you meet my family. But after that, you go back to your place. I love you too much to let the curse get you. Promise you'll do that?" I said, sticking out my pinkie.

She locker her pinkie in mine. "Promise." 

The day finally came, and Emily excitedly unpacker her suitcase in our guest room.

Thomas approached me in the hallway.

"So much for not marrying, huh Charlie?" 

"Listen, Tom, I know you don't know what it's like to be in love, but trust me, when it happens to you, you'd do anything for them.

He gave me a look. "Anything? Including letting them suffer at the hands of the curse?" He shook his head at me, and walked back into his room. 

"Your family is really into this curse, aren't they?" Emily asked.

"Yeah. I mean, when everyone who marries into the family dies, it kind of makes you wonder. How many coincidences can there be before it gets suspicious, you know?" I said. 

"Well, maybe this time we'll luck out. Maybe I'll make it." Emily joked. 

The rest of the week went by smoothly. My father loved Emily, as did Elizabeth and James. I was able to mostly avoid Thomas all week.

On the last day, Thomas looked at me as he put on his shoes and coat.

"Where are you going?" I asked.

"I'm leaving. Out of the godforsaken house. Out of the curse, out of here. I can't believe you did this. You know what's going to happen to Emily." He said, opening the door.

"Thomas, I-" 

"I'm disappointed in you, Charles. Maybe one day you'll understand." He said, and he was gone. 

"What's with him?" Emily asked, startling me. 

"Oh, nothing, he just gets like this sometimes." I said, reassuring her. 

"Well, it's been a week, and I'm fine. Maybe we were right. Maybe the curse is broken." She said as my father, Elizabeth and James all slowly entered the room.

"Yes. Maybe." I said as my father handed me a large knife. 

Emily kept her back turned to me as I crept towards her. 

"See, Charles? Maybe there's really nothing to be scared of." And with that, I plunged the knife into her back. 

Emily collapsed on the ground, now covered in blood, and was able to get one last word out.

"Why?" 

I bent down and put my hand on her face. "Oh, Emily. You know the rules. Everyone who lives in this house dies a horrific death. And this is yours. I'm sorry, I really did love you. But rules are rules." I said as she bled out in front of me.

My father laughed. "Good job, Charlie boy, good job!" He said as James went to fetch us some celebratory wine. "I thought we were through with this when Thomas turned out a disappointment. You, however, have saved us from him. You continue on the legacy of this house." 

Father held up his wine glass, making a toast. 

"One more generation kept pure. One more part of the bloodline safe to us. This house and it's legacy will stay in our family forever, no matter what. No matter who marries, or who's children move in, we will find a way. Cheers!" 

The four of us laughed and drank, thankful to still have the house. And at the end of the day, I pulled out my phone, and opened a dating app.

One more couldn't hurt, could it?

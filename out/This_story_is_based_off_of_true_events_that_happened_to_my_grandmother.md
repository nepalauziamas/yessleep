One dark night I was at a dance and out of town. We had been partying for a while and my husband ended up all drunk, so drunk in fact that he could barely walk. So I knew it was up to me to get us home on my own. 

About 20 minutes into the drive I looked to the right side of the road and chills were sent down my spine. About 30 feet away there were two little kids, a girl and a boy. The girl was a little bit bigger than the boy and something that just struck me as weird was the fact that they were wearing raincoats in the middle of summer in west Texas. I looked around to see if I could find signs of a car crash or any other explanation as to why they were just standing on the side of the road at 3 in the morning. I then realized that they were just gazing into the distance as if they could see something that I couldn’t, it was almost as if their eyes were glued to something that wasn’t really there. I started slowing down and flashing my lights at them trying to get them their attention but it didn’t matter how many times I did this they were still glaring off into the dark night. 

At this very moment I got a sick feeling to my stomach it’s like my gut was trying to tell me that I shouldn’t be here in the middle of this. I turned to my husband and shook him awake and explained what was happening and asked him what we should do and he wanted to get out of the car and try to help them. I really didn’t know what to do at this point because I had a really bad feeling about all of this so I told him no but he kept saying we should just go and I told him that there was no way I was getting out of the car so I just kept on driving as fast as I could speeding down the road because there was just an eerie feeling there I still don’t know what it was to this day but it just didn’t feel right and I was already super frightened so there was no way I would’ve gotten out of the car. 

A few minutes later we arrived back home and I was still shaken up. I was so scared in fact that I couldn’t sleep now keep in mind my husband was still super drunk so as soon as we got home he went straight to sleep to this day he doesn’t even remember anything that happened that night. The minutes turned into hours of and I still wasn’t asleep until eventually I was about 8 in the morning and I knew the Catholic Church would be open so I rushed over there as soon as I could. 

The priest could see how visibly afraid I was so he asked me what was wrong and I told him the story of what had happened to me that night. He told me things like that really do exist everywhere and even though we can’t see them most of the time they’re still there. He told me that I just so happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time and that I wandered into something that I shouldn’t have seen. He then informed me that the only thing I could do now to ease my fear was to pray and pray and pray some more that I would never encounter anything like that ever again. Now that I look back on it I’m really glad that those kids didn’t end up looking back at because what if they had and I ended up seeing something that scarred me for life or what it I saw something that put me into enough shock and feet that I crashed the car. To this day I still wonder had those kids looked back at me would I have stopped and tried to help them and seen en evil that no person is ever meant to see.

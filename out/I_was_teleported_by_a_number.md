Let’s start from the beginning. I’m a frequent AirBnB user. Even when I’m in my home town, I try to at least stay at one to two places a month. It helps me relax and sort of reset myself.

Anyways, the last house I stayed at was a pretty interesting experience. I laid my bags down on the bed and looked around like I always do. I figured if something is broken or disturbed and I didn’t touch it then I need to notate it. It’s no way I’m going to pay for someone’s mistakes.

After checking the living room I found these pieces of paper. I was curious what they were doing there. So I took a second glance at the papers. It was a symbol on the top sheet. The best way I could describe it was a S inside of a circle.

I continued looking through the papers and found descriptions of what this symbol meant. The author called it “Stain Number”. I thought that was a pretty odd title, but it caught my curiosity. 

Page after page was a description on what this number is and what it does. Now brace yourself. Apparently it can allow you to warp through space and time. From what the notes say, the ONLY way to get to Stain Number is finding the number between three and four. This sounds crazy I know, but the notes make it convincing.

After a while of sorting through the notes, I began to tire myself. I ended up just putting the notes back where they were. I figured since it was just notes, I’d leave them where they were. 

I ended up going back to the bedroom and unpacking and winding down. I turned on the tv and caught up on some shows. I ended up passing out. And that’s when it happened…

As I was sleep I kept dreaming of myself running away from something. The sheer fear in my heart was so unpleasant. I ran for what felt like minutes and still I couldn’t shake whatever my mind was conjuring up. 

I finally decided to turn around and see what I was running from. It was the “Stain Number”. I visually saw it in my head. This was so weird. This nightmarish dream came from me messing around with some papers for about five minutes. This was just so strange.

I woke up and instantly made the mistake of wanting to write out the number in head. I wanted to see if what this person had said was true.

I instantly found the piles of papers from earlier. I found a sheet that was blank. I instantly wrote down this mysterious number from my dream. I had to see if this really worked.

After I wrote the last digit, in an instant I was in an interesting place. This place gave off a weird yet dreamy vibe. It was so eerie yet peaceful at the same time.

I realized this is what one of the pieces of papers called Stainworld. Well at least a part of Stainworld. See the notes stated that  the Stain Number would lead you to Stainworld.

I began exploring this new world. The ground was a dry redish soil with the sky being s hazy yellowish color. I continued on as the dry soil crunched on my house shoes. After a while of exploring, I heard a bizarre noise. It was like hearing a muffled chainsaw reviving up.

From out of nowhere a grotesque overweight monster came charging at my direction. I instantly booked it. I started having déjà vu from that dream. I began to realize I wasn’t running from Stain Number, I was running from that creature.

I ended up getting enough space between me and the monster. I began writing in the dry soil as fast as I could. I had figured the same way I got into Stainworld would be the same way I got out.

The monster grew closer as it kept shouting “help me get out! Please!” I instantly wrote the last number and was teleported out of the monsters grasp.

I laid in a field of grass replaying in my head what just happened. Then I began to put together that the monster wasn’t raging to harm me, it was pleading for help. But why though?

I then quickly realized I wasn’t where I had been at just a few moments ago. Before all of this I was in a house. Then I’m in a grassy field.

One thing those papers didn’t say was how off the teleportation from back and forth are. I’m walking back to the Airbnb now. I used my phones GPS to get me back to the address, but what should I do next? 

This number is just stuck in my mind and I honestly don’t know what to do about this. This is clearly a major scientific discovery. But who would believe me? Nothing about this makes sense. Besides who would believe me about all of this when I tell them the information is from a few pieces of paper I’ve found? I don’t know right now. I’m tired from this walk so I’ll update this later. Thanks for hearing me out.

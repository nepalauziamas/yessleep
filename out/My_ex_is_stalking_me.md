So it’s a bit of a long story, but I broke up with my ex after I came out to him as non binary and he didn’t react well. Actually I told him to take it or leave it, but he didn’t have the guts to leave and instead tried to control every step of my transition down to what hair cut I got. So I left him, to be my true self. And after some reflecting on the relationship I realized he also didn’t really understand, or maybe just didn’t care about my consent. Hind sight is 20/20 though. 🤷🏻 I was happy, and then I got a Facebook invite from his mom?? I declined it and continued living my life. And then one of his old friends contacted me and asked what was going on with him. I probably would’ve left it alone but I’d broken up with him before and he got a mutual friend involved to convince me to reconsider, and I ended up taking him back(it was a mistake) so I decided to contact his sister because I didn’t want to unblock him, and I told her to pass along the message that I wanna be left alone, I want his friends and family to stop contacting me, and under no circumstances would I be taking him back. This was months ago, and after that I didn’t hear from him, until an old mutual friend contacted me on fb a month ago. She was saying hello and I hadn’t spoken to her in years so I decided to Exchange pleasantries. After a bit of small talk she told me to contact him 🤦🏻 I wanted some closure so I decided I would. It was awful and he was exactly the same as when I’d left months ago, except maybe his codependency he won’t address might’ve gotten even worse. If I wasn’t happy about leaving him before I definitely was after this. Eventually we got into an argument about trans rights, and HE blocked ME. So you’d think that’d be the end of it. But then I started seeing his car around. And I got a letter in his handwriting telling me if he can’t have me nobody should(cliché much?? 🙄) And the other night I thought I heard his voice in my new house, but he wasn’t there? He shouldn’t even know where I live? Today I noticed a hole in my wall, like a peep hole? I’m starting to freak out a little, my dogs been on edge all day and one of my kitchen knives has disappeared. I tried the police but they were ridiculously unhelpful because he hasn’t done anything yet. I thought about going to my sisters but I don’t wanna put her or her kids in danger, and ditto for my best friend, especially considering he hates my best friend already. I don’t know what to do, or where I could go that he wouldn’t follow me. I’m scared

  

This a story of all events within my lifetime that I would consider strange or paranormal in nature. The earliest event that I recall occurred when I was about 5-6 years old. My family and I lived in the NC within the confide of the Great Dismal Swamp. I remember being alone in a family members bedroom excitedly jumping up and down on their bed. The window next to the bed was open to the window screen as it often got humid as one might imagine. For some reason I was compelled to look over to the window, as I glanced over, I saw a scaly green face with sharp teeth staring right at me from the window screen as if squatting down to look into the window at me.

 I was terrified and ran into my parent’s room and quickly got into their bed. It is important to note that this event occurred during the early 90’s when there were no smartphones and limited access to computers. I went to draw this creature almost daily, obsessed with making my story known, feeling as if no one believed me. Later when I was an adult my grandmother confirmed that while at that house, she too saw the scaled creature. She relayed that it was sitting inside the house in a rocking chair, its body shaped like a woman but covered in scales. To this day I don’t believe many people believe me, what I saw could only be described as a succubus. 

Fast forward to about another year later. We had since moved to a new home that was not within the dismal swamp. I remember as child several times seeing shadows on my wall of people sitting up arguing. Often, I would hear what I sounded like my aunt’s voice and her husband arguing from our small closet in the hallway. I had a friend at the time that was not the nicest, I had confided in this friend that I had often heard these voices from our small linen closet. My friend locked me within this closest, there was no light in the closet, and I could not open the door. Flash back to the scene in Sixth Sense when the boys ‘playfully’ locked the child in a closet where he was not alone.

Years later when I was about 13-14 my grandfather who had lived with me throughout the entirety of my life become very ill. My family decided that they would care for him in the home as my grandmother and mother were both nurses. 

As my grandfather become sicker and closer to death strange occurrences presented themselves. My grandfather had a hospice bed that was placed in our living room for the time being. It all started when our two cats began to have what I would describe as a fit, they fluffed their fur and tails and began to circle around his bed hissing as if very threatened by something not seen by the human eye. 

Shortly after this myself and family began to have unusual experiences, i remember laying on my mother’s bed reading a book in her room one night when I saw clearly out of the corner of the book something dark slowly emerge around the lower corner of the bed and then make its way around the end of the bed. Terrified I jumped up on the bed and made a leap out of the room. 

Often, I would be alone as several family members worked nights. I remember feeling at all times as if someone was staring you down, an intense weight of uneasiness that could not be explained. One night myself and my grandmother were laying down on my bed talking when we heard a loud thud as if someone had smacked the carpet with their hand, nothing had fell on the floor and this could not be explained. 

Other family members reported that while sleeping their covers had slowly been pulled off of them. Much of the time in my grandfather’s last days he would constantly moan loudly at all times. I begin to hear these noises even when he was at the hospital and even after he had passed. Eventually my family had to move out, while me and my cousins were grabbing some last items from a sliding closet the door suddenly slid shut, we yelled for someone to help only to find everyone was outside.

I am not sure if whatever was attached to my grandfather’s death ever left that house, but I would never go back.

Fast forward once again, I was about 22 years old and my family and I were looking at a home in a new town. Its important to be aware that at this time I had a daughter who was about 3-4 years old during these events. We had not yet moved into the home and were viewing the house. I began to chase this shadow that was around the size of my daughter as it quickly darted around corners, I had thought my daughter was running about and I was trying to keep up with her. The shadow darted around its last corner, leading to a set of stairs going down into the unfurnished cellar like basement. It was at this point I realized it could not have been my small daughter, my family validated to me that she had been with them the whole time.

Unfortunately, we accepted the home as we were being forced to move from our current residence. It did not take long before we realized there was something not right about the home. It felt sad and hopeless as if the house gave off its own energy. On one instance my family reported that my daughter was chattering away to someone and peering under her play chair. When asked who she was talking to the said it was someone like her. One night while we were all sleeping, my little girl often sleeping with her grandmother, my family heard tiny footsteps running around the hallways of the house as if my daughter had got up and began to run around the house. My mother got up to check if my daughter was still in bed in which she was sound asleep. Another night my grandmother, father and cousin would often go into the garage to smoke, they distinctly heard heels walking about outside. This was impossible as the home had a driveway the was at least half a mile from the road and the road itself was no where near a Main Street. 

Another time I remember my cats where in the hallway between the garage and basement which had a door that led to the main house. The cats were frantic and were freaking out behind the door, I looked under the door to see that the light in that hall was flipping on and off by itself. During our last weeks at the house there were a lot of turmoil within the family. 

One horrific night I recall sleeping facing towards my doorway. I heard crying like a newborn baby screaming. I peered at my doorway only to see a fetus covered in blood, holding its own umbilical cord, screaming. What makes this ‘dream’ even more terrifying is that I closed my eyes I was so afraid, only to open them again to find that the fetus was now staring at me inches away from my face. I quickly rolled over and ‘woke up’ wondering if this event was a dream at all. What makes this part of the story horrifying is that later my grandmother relayed to me that she too had seen the fetus creature. One night when my ex decided to leave, my family and I heard loud knocking, we would go to the door only to find the knocking had moved to another window. After a while of chasing the knocking, the knocking started at all of the windows and doors outside of the house. No was seen from the long driveway or outside. 

My ex was not a good person, when we broke up, he terrorized me to the point that I began to have night terrors. One night stayed with me. I remember dreaming that I was in the apartment that I currently resided in. I walked down the steps from my bedroom through the living room to the kitchen. There are large sliding doors in the dining room that overlook a small cement porch. I passed by these windows to the kitchen. When I made my way back from the kitchen into the dining room, I saw my ex standing at the glass windows. He was not alone however, behind him was a large figure, that had branches sticking out from all over its body and had to be close to 6 feet tall. This figure had no face only an impression where a face should be, it looked like someone had smudged its face to once side. Its hand was hoof like in nature and covered my ex’s mouth. Once the creative noticed I saw it, my tongue began to fall out of my mouth in bloody chunks. I awake as I heard pounding outside of my dream from the front door. I ran downstairs to find that no one was there or had been at the door at all.

This next event took place about 4 years ago, I had suffered from a great depressive episode resulting in a suicide attempt. Luckily, I was not successful and check myself into a hospital as I was afraid of what I may do. While at the hospital I remember laying in bed, I was dreaming, but I begin to wake up only to see a girl wearing a white gown with long brown hair, she was sitting at the end of my bed with her face in her hands crying frantically. A couple of weeks later, I was now at home, the bed I was sleeping in had no door and faced in a way that you could see the steps leading to the second floor of the house.

 In my ‘dream’ I was laying in the same poison as I was in real life, I looked up at the steps to see a girl making her way down the steps, she looked identical to the girl I had saw at the hospital and was wearing the same gown. She leaned over the rail of the steps once she made her way halfway down the steps and hissed at me in the same manner as a cat. To this day I don’t know if any of the ‘dreams’ I have had were actual dreams as they occurred in the same rooms and bed I was sleeping in with no dream like environment or details. 

My most recent paranormal occurrence happened shortly after my grandmas sudden and tragic death. Days after her death my family and I would hear knocking, it would sound as if it was coming from a random corner of the house but seemed far away at the same time. We look outside only to find that our neighbors were not knocking or hammering anything. One day my family and I ordered some delivery from one of my grandmothers’ favorite restaurants. We were all in the kitchen unpacking the food, including my daughter. There was no one else at the house besides us and we were standing in the kitchen talking getting ready to make our plates when we heard a distinct female voice come from the hallway leading from the living room to the kitchen say ‘hello’. We all heard it at the same time and just stared at one another like ‘did you hear that?’. We went to inspect the living room and found that no televisions were on in the home and there was no explanation for the disembodied voice.

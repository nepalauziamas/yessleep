Math teachers are some of the most... resilient people in the world. I mean, they never got sick and always went to class to teach algebra and other stuff. 

I am pretty interested in math and will always look forward to my next math class. My favorite branch in math is algebra. I became pretty close to the math teacher, we solve math problems together. Well, it was fun. I participated in some math competitions and won some. But the downside is, that some of my friends make fun of me for liking algebra. But it doesn't matter really much. 

Until one day, my math teacher didn't come to class. I was pretty shocked, to say the least. I was wandering, "Is she sick or something?". A substitute teacher fills in. We were given worksheets containing 30 problems. I solved them in no time and I was allowed to sleep for the duration of the class. 

The bell rang and we were allowed to go home. I wanted to check on my math teacher, to see if she was alright. I went to her home only to find that it was very messy. There was a journal on the table, it reads:

I went to sleep to find someone staring at me from far away through my window. It was very creepy. I hope he goes away, and never come back.   
**June 20th, 2021**  
The person is nowhere to be seen, but I heard some noises from downstairs. It was probably just rats or something. I'm going to head to my bedroom now.   
**June 22nd, 2021**  
I hear my front door broke. I'm going to my room now and barricade my bedroom now. I hope it's enough to hold the door shut until morning, my phone is dead so calling emergency services is not an option. 

Chills ran down my spine. I decided to explore the second floor. I found some footprints leading to a door. I opened the door, and what's inside shocked me. My teacher's body was in the bed and the room is covered with blood. There was scratch marks and signs of struggle in the bedroom. I would remember it forever. 

Suddenly, the closet behind me creaks. It was a small creak, but it was enough to make me very scared. I opened the closet in fear and saw someone. He was a tall man with muscles. He stared at me with a unnaturally wide smile. He said, "Run.". I quickly ran to the broken front door, but it was too far and I would get caught. I hid in the bathroom. I realized he will find me soon if I stay here. So I have to think of a plan to get out of there. I noticed a window that I could climb to get out of the house. I climbed out and fell to the ground. I ran as fast as possible to the police station to explain my situation. 

The police searched the house and can't find the murderer. They are still investigating it though. They hope they can get to the bottom of this. I was interrogated about the murder and I answer the questions, hoping that they can solve the mystery. 

The incident is still haunting me to this day. "What is the motive of the killer?" is one of my questions about this incident. After this incident, I'm feeling very unsafe. The killer might try to hunt me down because I encountered him. I'll never feel safe again, knowing there's a loose murderer possibly making me his next target.

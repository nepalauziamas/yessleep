 

The chain-link fence rattled, followed by my shoes hitting the dirt. The fence rattled again, then another thud signifying Darren made it over. I crouched behind the nearest rusted out pickup truck and lowered my facemask. The sunset illuminated the massive sign overhead that read “Dave's Junk & Scrap, Lead now $0.90 a pound!” I turned to Darren and whispered “We’re in and out quick, don’t forget the moneybox in the bottom drawer.” We both took out our crowbars from our backpacks, I double checked my pistol and carefully put it back in my belt, raising my facemask back over my nose. Darren adjusted the hunting knife sheathed on his waist. I turned and peered over the truck's hood cautiously, listening and watching for any signs of security.

Then I saw something I couldn’t quite make out, tapping Darren on the shoulder and pointing in its direction. In the distance, maybe 80 yards off, was some kind of small dog-like creature. It was walking on all fours and appeared to have very short hair if any at all. It was almost hopping from place to place, like some kind of deranged frog. It moved erratically between the rows of junk cars. Going on, in, around, under, without pattern. Darren flinched at my touch but aligned his gaze toward whatever that thing was. We both held a crouch while fixated on what the hell we were seeing. In a hushed voice Darren uttered “What the fuck is that?” I whispered back, not breaking my gaze on it. “Is it some kind of guard dog? Looks awfully small for that.” “Maybe it's some kind of rabid possum? I've heard those things will mess you up if you piss them off.” We agreed to avoid it, no way we were risking rabies or whatever disease just for some cash.

The junkyard was set up in an egg-like shape, the widest part being the middle and the outskirts surrounded by a curved fence. Stacked vehicles and piles of scrap were everywhere, small walking paths were winding between everything like a spider's web. Located in the middle was our target, a shipping container turned into an office. On one side it had a solid metal door fixed on it with a floodlight overhead. The floodlight was off currently, we guessed it was motion activated but there was no way to tell.

There were street lamps posted every 50 feet or so all throughout the junkyard, however the sunset was too bright for them to be activated yet. I adjusted my backpack and motioned to Darren it was time to move. We held our crouched positions, Darren just a few paces behind, and advanced toward the middle. I felt like some kind of badass navy seal, giving hand gestures to my partner while looking out for any kind of movement. I truly believe people are capable of things thought impossible if only they had the confidence. That being said, confidence has jack all to do with fate.

Rounding a destroyed bumper of a ‘99 Toyota, glass crunched under my feet before I could see it was even there. I froze dead silent and so did Darren. We were in the mid section of the junkyard now, just a few rows from the office. Then it hit me, we were right where we had seen the thing before. Low and distant, a bone chilling sound moved through the cars. It is hard to describe, but picture someone gargling mouthwash. Its echo eerily passed through the rows of cars followed by a series of fleshy thumps as the creature moved from vehicle to vehicle. Terrified, I dove under the car, Darren following my lead. It had not seen us, so I held up a fist signaling to hold our position under the car. The sky was beginning to give in to darkness at this point, I figured we had 15 minutes until full darkness. We had flashlights but I was against having to use them as they don't exactly hide your location.

Then the window of the car above us shattered, trailed by that fucking gargling noise. It was even more disturbing just feet away from us. By now I was learning more and more about the creature. It seemed to be noise sensitive, and had some sort of claws. They could be heard ripping at the upholstery of the car, it seemed like it was digging frantically with harsh desperation. It was making a breathing sound now, quick breaths in between its gargles. Searching for the source of the noise I so foolishly made.

We held our breaths, trying to keep our noise level to a minimum while squashed beneath the car. It seemed our luck made a turn after what felt like hours, it climbed out of the window it had broken earlier and did that odd hopping motion we had witnessed it do before. It leapt onto a box truck adjacent to the car we were positioned under, however it clung to the side without sliding down. Claws penetrating the sides of the truck with ease, I realized my assessment of dog-like was inaccurate. It looked more like some kind of fucking giant salamander now, no teeth, only a large tongue. Eyes on each side of its head, no hair could be seen on its body, only what appeared to be some kind of slime that glistened in what was left of the sunlight. I glanced at Darren and saw the sheer horror in his eyes, it confirmed I wasn't the only one seeing this monstrosity. It all felt unreal.

After a short while, motionless and noiseless, it made its way up and over the box truck it clung to. We could hear it hopping to the next vehicle, then the next, until we were sure it was far enough away. I was the first to move from under the car, I rolled to my side and got back on my legs, holding a crouch. I glanced into the car through the passenger window as Darren made his way out from cover to return to my side. What I saw looked like a damn hurricane went through the car. Every seat was torn up, even the dash had been sliced in half like a fucking bell pepper. There was slime everywhere inside too, like a scene out of David Cronenberg's “The Fly”. I could hear Darren talking but almost didn't register it, I was too focused on what the hell I was even looking at. “The coast is clear up to the office man, let's get this cash so we can ditch this shithole!” Darren exclaimed through clenched teeth. The tense feeling was mutual between us, I could tell it would turn to desperation soon if we didn't move out.

We proceeded towards the office, crowbars still in hand. Now I had Darren moving backwards so he could alert me if anything was following us. We made it uneventfully to the door of the office just as the spot light switched on above us, putting us right in the limelight like a fucking $2.99 rotisserie chicken at Walmart. In the distance, the gurgling began subtly at first, like someone playing music on their patio a few houses down. Then the fleshy thumping of its hops became audible. “Get that fucking door open!” I yelled, knowing a confrontation with that creature would likely be our last. Darren slammed his crowbar in the door, yanking with all his might. The door groaned and flexed, but did not obey the will of Darren’s crowbar. He screamed “It wont fucking open man, shit!” The thing was close now, the streetlights hauntingly illuminating its voracious approach. With one final jump, nearly a 10 foot hop, it landed solidly on the roof of the office. It’s eyes glaring down on us like a kid into his Halloween bag.

With one last pull the door flung open, rocketing Darren on his back and tossing his crowbar to the side. The creature pounced on Darren, wrestling with him like fucking WWE. Darren reached for his knife on his belt, slashing at the air to no effect. The creature had him on his stomach now, its hind legs wrapped around Darren's waist. With one slash, like a veteran butcher, it severed Darren's spine just under the skull. Like a sack of potatoes, Darren went limp as soon as the claws exited. Blood erupted everywhere like a firehose as Darren’s head leaned forward in paralysis. The knife fell uselessly from his hand. The creature placed its mouth over the wound and this absolutely horrific slurping sound began. I didn't wait to see the end, I snapped out of shock and rushed inside the office, slamming the door. The office door had multiple locks on it, like some kind of bank vault. I hurryingly attempted to engage them but they all seemed electronically controlled. A red button was on the wall labeled “Emergency Lockdown” so I slammed my fist on it, watching each lock engage one by one.

I took a deep breath, for now, I think I'm safe. I could hear the creature outside continuing to feed but it seems to be done now. I don't know where it went, but it never tried to get inside after me which I find weird. Additionally, how did the crowbar manage to get past all those locks? This was such a mistake. I can see out the window from inside the office, there’s bars over it now that must've come down when I hit the lockdown button. Darren is lifeless, his neck bent and there seems to be a massive hole under his skull where his brain should be. I'm not looking for too long, I already vomited twice.

I am writing this on my phone, I just don't know what to do from here. I see a desk in here, there's a laptop on it but its password locked. There are CCTV monitors but they are all powered off and I don't see a way to turn them on. My phone is almost dead and I am sure someone will show up to work here eventually. I will update you guys when I can, any advice would be really fucking appreciated.

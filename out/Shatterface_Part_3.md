[Part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/uwu0q9/shatterface_part_2/)

As I arrived at home after a long day, I told my husband Vincent everything that had happened, from the moment Kylie Moore had walked into the police station to my drive home and the encounter with what I could only assume had been the ghost Shatterface. Vincent understandably didn't believe the last part, or rather he believed that I had seen something on the road, but blamed it on my research and lack of sleep. I was too tired to argue against that.

I dreamed about the two dead teenagers that night. The entire scene was blurry, but there was no doubt the two people I watched from some distance were Brandon Hayes and Peter McLeod. I stood between the trees, unmoving, eyes locked on them.

The sun was setting slowly and the teenagers talked loudly about the ghost they wanted to see here. I didn't care. Not yet. I just stood and watched when one of them started to talk about the ghost's "fucked-up" face and how ugly it had to be. The other joined immediately, insulting and taunting the ghost, daring it to come and face them.

Anger flooded through me. Suddenly, I stood right in front of them. They were still blurry despite the proximity, a pale green veil before my eyes kept me from seeing them clearly. Their screams sounded distant, but they soon turned into pathetic coughing and then silence. Absolute silence.

I woke from this dream in the middle of the night, coughing and with the most horrible feeling of being watched. I didn't turn on the lights, not wanting to wake Vincent, just scanned the dark room for an intruder, but nothing could be seen. It took a moment for me to catch my breath and when I had finally shaken the feeling of having something something stuck in my throat, I laid back down and tried to forget about the weird nightmare that had to be a result of my nearly obsessive investigation.

The remaining night was restless. No more nightmares came to me, but I still woke after short periods of time and it took forever to fall asleep again, leaving me horribly tired in the morning. It was almost a relief to see the sunrise, knowing that this night was finally over, but the headache the sleep deprivation had caused wasn't exactly pleasant either.

During breakfast, Vincent gave me a concerned look when he watched me swallow some painkillers with my second cup of coffee. "Just take the day off", he told me. "You can't concentrate anyways."

"I can't. I think I'm finally getting *somewhere* with this damn case and..."

"That *somewhere* is going to be a mental breakdown if you continue like this", he interrupted me. For a second there was only silence between us before he reached out and took my hand. "I'm worried about you, Jon. Just... promise to take it slow today, will you?"

"I promise." And I actually intended to keep this promise, if only because I could barely keep my eyes open and probably wouldn't survive an entire workday.

Both of us left for work eventually and I decided to drive to the morgue instead of the police station. I had to talk to Vivian about the bodies again. Despite all that had happened, there was still the possibility that nothing paranormal was involved. Maybe their deaths had been freak accidents. Maybe the photos we had found in Martin Porter's room were either an art project or a prank. Maybe the apparitions had just been a figment of my imagination, a mere result of the stress. Maybe I was working off a faulty premise, just because Vivian had missed some tiny detail.

The coroner was rather surprised to see me. "You look like shit, Jon", she proclaimed instead of a greeting when I walked into the room. She pulled her bloody gloves off and walked around the table on which the body of an old man was placed.

"Bad night", I shrugged. "Vivian, is there any possibility that you missed something with Hayes and McLeod? Any other cause of death or..."

"Jon", she interrupted me. "I triple-checked. The kids drowned, I'm sure about that." She walked over to the door and gestured for me to follow her. "So you're not getting anywhere with this case, hm?", she asked as we stepped outside in the drizzling rain and she fumbled a pack of cigarettes from her pocket.

"Not really." I was reluctant to tell her about my supposed encounters with Shatterface, despite the fact that she had pointed me in that direction in the first place. It would make me sound like a madman, I was well aware of that, and although we had built a loose friendship over the past months, I didn't trust her to take my seriously. Not when even my husband thought this was crazy.

She lit her cigarette and leaned against the wall. "You know", she started, took a drag of said cigarette and blew some smoke in the air. "Maybe it's time to close this case. Call it an accident and move on."

"Are you suggesting to rig the reports?"

She sighed. "Let's be real, Jon, you're helping no one with this. There isn't a single clue. Let's just give the families an explanation and let them make their peace."

"No", I denied almost immediately. "I need a few more days, Vivian, I have a lead, I'll just have to see where it takes me."

"You're searching the ghost." It wasn't even a question, but rather a baffled statement. Just about to take another drag from her cigarette, she stopped dead in her movment and stared at me with raised eyebrows. "For the love of God, Jon, that *natural phenomenon* was just a theory. It's just a story."

"I won't lie to these families." The words came out harsher than intended. Her suggestion hadn't been unreasonable to be honest, but it still annoyed me, especially now that I finally had an idea where to go. I only had to find Dolores Fray.

She let the bud of her cigarette fall to the ground and stepped on it, extinguishing the ember. "Fine. Whatever", she replied, not any less annoyed. "Go hunt your ghost, it's not my problem anyways. Just call me if you change your mind." And with that, she turned around and walked back into the building, leaving me outside in the rain.

Well, that could have gone better.

Tired as hell, exhausted from my argument with Vivian and with an agonizing headache, I decided to only visit the police station for an hour at most. Miriam expressed her worries as soon as I stepped through the door, commenting on how pale I looked and that the dark shadows under my eyes didn't look exactly healthy. I promised her to head home as soon as I had looked up something.

The first thing I searched in our database was the address of Dolores Fray, who Martin had mentioned in his notes. She turned out to be a  ninty-year-old woman living near the centre of the town who had no criminal record whatsoever.

The second thing was a search for all people who had died by drowning in this town in the past years. The number turned out to be weirdly high for a town that possessed only one lake which was rarely used for swimming. The majority of them were accidents, of course, but now that Vivian had offered to rig the reports, I was hesitant to believe that. To me, the high number alone confirmed the existence of Shatterface.

The address of Dolores Fray saved in my phone, I drove straight home to get some rest. Part of me was anxious to visit the old woman and find out what Martin Porter had wanted from her, but I could barely keep my eyes open at this point and wouldn't be able to focus anyways.

The house was empty when I arrived, since it was early afternoon and Vincent was of course still at work. I spent the rest of the day on the couch, unable to sleep and therefor watching mindless TV shows without paying much attention. Vincent eventually came home, bringing chinese take-out for dinner, and we went to bed early that day.

Another nightmare came as soon as I closed my eyes. The world was blurry again, though it was a little clearer than when I had stood in the woods. People were talking somewhere, but their words were a jumbled mess to me and they had no meaning. I listened for a while though, because the voices of the two people, a man and a woman, were soothing to me, though after a while I got bored of the noise and wandered off.

I ended up in the bedroom and approached the large golden frame the woman spent so much time in front of. What stared back at me was a monster, a horrible creature with a disfigured face and mismatched eyes, and I screamed and punched the thing as hard as I could.

Bright red liquid flowed from my cut hand then, and the monster stared back at me with a broken face.

Then the dream shifted rapidly and the world blurred in a pale green. I struggled against the iron grip that held me down, but to no use. As I tried to scream, no sound left my lips and I felt something cold in my chest while the green faded to black slowly and my body went numb.

I woke up then, violently coughing and unable to breathe. I bent over, desperate to get rid of whatever was stuck in my throat, and ended up spitting out a concerning amout of water. For a moment, I just stared down at the floor despite being unable to see anything in the darkness, and wondered how this was even possible when I was hit with the unbearable feeling of being watched.

Still breathless and with a sore throat I sat up and looked at the bedroom's single window. There she stood, a dark silhouette against the pale moonlight, unmoving yet undoubtedly staring straight at me. I froze for a moment, unable to do anything but stare at what I could only assume to be a broken face hidden in the darkness of the night, until I finally managed to reach out and turn on the small lamp on my nightstand.

The ghost vanished with the darkness.

Next to me, Vincent moved. "Jon?",  he asked, blinking against the too bright light. "What's wrong?"

"Shatterface was here. Here in the room." I couldn't hide the panicked edge in my voice as I spoke.

"You had a nightmare, babe." He yawned. "Go back to sleep." He then turned back around, asleep again after mere seconds. I wasn't sure if he had been awake enough to even register what I'd said.

I sighed and with a last look at the small patch of the white carpet that was darkened by water, I turned to light off again and laid back down, hoping that I would calm down enough to get a little more sleep that night.

I was tired when I woke the next morning, but at least I had managed to calm my nerves enough to get some sleep and no more nightmares had plagued my mind for the remaining hours. The wet spot on the carpet had dried and left me wondering wether Vincent had been right and Shatterface's appearance had been merely a nightmare. Either way, neither of us brought the topic up again when we sat at the kitchen table for breakfast.

I was the first to leave for work, as always, so I grabbed the car keys and headed for the front door, though when I opened said door, my heart skipped a beat. I found myself face to face with a young woman and I instinctively stumbled a few steps backwards, a hand pressed against where my heart was hammering in my chest.

"Jesus fucking christ, Kylie!", I blurted out. "What are you doing here?"

"I wanted to know what's up with our case."

"This isn't..." Our case, I wanted to say, but dropped the sentence halfway since this was really the least important thing right now. "You know, just call me next time. Or show up at the police station. It's too fucking early to give me a heart attack like this."

I took a second to take a deep breath and calm my racing heart and only then I noticed that she looked slightly off. Her hot pink hair was disheveled, the make-up around her eyes smudge, her arms were wrapped around her body and rubbed slowly over her arms."Kylie, did you spend the night here?"

She shrugged, refusing to meet my eyes. "Needed a place to stay. A cop's house seemed like a good idea."

"Just ring the damn doorbell next time!"

"It was past midnight."

"So? I won't let you sleep on the doorstep just because it's late." I sighed. "Come on in, we need to warm you up." When she didn't move, I carefully put a hand on her shoulder and guided her inside.

Vincent was currently putting some plates in the dishwasher when we entered the kitchen. "Hey. Forgot something?", he asked before turning around and freezing for a second when he saw the girl next to me. "Oh. Hi? I'm Jon's husband, Vincent."

"Hey. I'm Kylie, I... help Jon with a case." Her lips twisted into a nervous smile.

"Oh, sure, he mentioned you", Vincent replied and his confused expression changed into a warm smile. "Nice to meet you."

"She spent the night on the doorstep", I told my husband then.

He was silent for a moment, looking back and forth between us, until he simply looked at Kylie and asked: "Why didn't you just ring the doorbell?"

"Because it was fucking late, okay?" She crossed her arms and lowered her head, eyes glued to the floor.

Vincent chuckled. "Don't worry about that next time. So, do you want tea or coffee?"

The girl looked back and forth between us as if she was trying to figure out wether this was a joke, before she cautiously replied: "Coffee."

Vincent had to leave for work eventually, leaving me alone with Kylie who held a cup of coffee in both hands and took a sip every now and then. For a while she simply stared at the tablecloth and only as her cup was almost empty she spoke. "Just ask already."

"I figured you would tell me when you're ready." I shrugged.

She still stared down at the table. "My mom's a bitch", she answered. "I talked back and she told me to fuck off and... and I didn't know where else to go, okay? Can we just ignore this?"

"Can you go back home?"

She shrugged. "I'll just go home after she goes to bed and avoid her for a few days. Works well usually."

"Did she hurt you, Kylie?" I glanced at her body, but her exposed skin showed no signs of physical abuse. Hopefully there were no bruises hidden under her clothes.

"No", she hissed. "Why, you want to arrest her? I'd love to see that bitch rot away in prison, but I can't afford the apartment. It's either her or the fucking street and believe it or not, I prefer a bed."

"We could..."

"Jon!", she interrupted me harshly and slammed the cup down on the table. "I don't want to talk about this!"

I certainly wasn't going to forget about this, but I decided to drop the matter for the time being. Angering her more would do no good. "I was going to question Dolores Fray today. Wanna tag along?", I offered instead.

She didn't hesitate for a second, pushed the chair back and jumped to her feet just a little to quickly to be casual. "Let's go!"

Kylie had distracted me well enough, but when we sat in the car on our way to Dolores Fray's home, I was thinking about Shatterface again. The ghost had been in our bedroom last night, I was sure about that, and that thought was terrifying. Did she hate me? Had she attempted to kill me last night? Or maybe it was a warning, her way of telling me to leave this case alone?

Either that, or the exact opposite was true and this ghost wanted my help with something. If she wanted me dead, she could do so. There was no reason to show me all those nightmares instead.

Dolores Fray lived in an apartment close to the town's edge, in an apartment complex that could use a new coat of paint. Kylie was visibly nervous when I rang the doorbell and for a short while, nothing happened. I almost thought the old woman wasn't home and was about to turn around when the front door was suddenly opened for us. I gave the teenager next to me an encouraging smile and entered.

Dolores was a small, frail woman whose age was clearly visible on her wrinkled skin and whitened hair. She looked back and forth between us cautiously until she finally asked what we wanted.

"Good morning, Ma'am", I greeted her. "I'm Detective Jonathan Reed, this is Kylie Moore. Please excuse the question, but we were told you know something about Shatterface."

Her expression fell and she sighed. "This cursed story again... oh dear, please, come in. Can I offer you something? Tea perhaps?"

Both of us declined and we were led into the living room, stuffed with furniture that resembled its owner in age. The air was dusty in here and the curtains blocked out most of the already sparce sunlight, which gave the an unsettling aura. At first I thought I was just oversensitive, considering what had happened until now, but Kylie seemed to notice it to. She stayed close to my side and even grabbed my wrist at some point, all without sparing a single glance at me of course.

We sat down on the leather sofa, Kylie still closer to me than strictly neccessary, and Dolores sat on the matching chair right next to it. "So, is there a reason you two are searching for her?"

"We think she killed someone, Miss Fray", I explained hesitantly, not bothering to clarify wether I refered to Martin Porter two years ago or the teenagers that had died recently.

She shook her head slowly. "Oh dear, the poor girl."

"You know who she is?", Kylie chimed in.

"It must have been decades ago", the old lady then started to explain. "I worked as a housekeeper back then, for the Arden family. They lived in the mansion in the woods... such a nice couple, but deeply religious. They were devastated when their daughter was born. You see, they couldn't understand why God gave them a child that was disfigured in body and mind."

I remembered my last nightmare, the *monster* I had seen in the mirror.

"Such a sweet girl, little Amelia. Barely ever talked, but that was alright. You should have seen her smile when I took her into the garden to play. She loved the garden. You know, I spent so much time with her because her parents didn't want to. But eventually her parents decided that she wasn't a divine punishment but rather a blessing. I don't know how it happened, but they stopped praying for her to change. They saw her as a prophet instead."

The story made me sick already. I didn't know how long ago that had happened, but the fact that these people had abandoned their own child just because it was disabled made me just angry.

"I took care of Amelia for years, you see", she continued. "I would have done this for her entire life if they had wanted me to. I loved her like my own child. But then they hailed her as their new messiah and the people started to believe them. It was a cult." She scoffed. "I can't deny that, it was a cult around this poor girl. I still tried to be there for her, but they wouldn't let me."

I remembered Martin's notes. *Arden. Cult. Lake.*

"They went to baptize her then. I don't know why. I was only the housekeeper and didn't get involved in their cult. All I know was that they took the girl to the lake and came back without her. I don't know if it was an accident or a ritual sacrifice, but I don't even think they brought the body back. Amelia was gone when I returned to do my job and one night later, they were all dead." She smiled a sad smile. "The Ardens were good people, but they were monstrous when it came to their daughter."

Monstrous wasn't a strong enough word to describe them, I thought, but I kept that to myself. "You know all that and never said anything?", I asked instead.

"They were all dead. No one left for you to arrest, Detective." She shrugged. "I don't know why she never came for me, but I didn't want to provoke her."

"Thank you for telling us these things, Miss Fray!", Kylie said.

The old woman smiled warmly at her. "You're very welcome, my dear."

I turned my head towards the window, not for any particular reason except the sudden feeling of being watched, and through the white curtains, I saw a figure standing outside and staring into the apartment. The curtains obscured most details, but I clearly saw the wet, blonde hair.

The fact that we were on the second floor made the sight even more unsettling.

I blinked and Shatterface disappeared, leaving me with nothing but a sense of dread. I prayed silently that I hadn't just doomed this old woman just by coming here.

Kylie noticed that I had started to tremble and gave me a questioning look, but I just shook my head. Anxious to get out of this dark, dusty room I thanked the old woman, took Kylie and hurried out of the flat. Shatterface was nowhere to be seen, but I could almost feel her presence nearby. I had to end this quickly, before this vengeful spirit decided to take its anger out on me or the combination of fear and sleep deprivation did the job for her.

And I had a pretty good idea just how to do that.

"We have to retrieve her body from the lake", I told Kylie. That's what Martin had meant with his notes. That's what kept Amelia Arden in this world. "I think this is how we set her free."

Kylie looked just as scared as I felt at the moment, but she nodded anyways. Her voice was shaking and her smile looked far from confident when she said: "I'm in."

[*The Devil was loose in Eden.*](https://reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/xp0csw/the_eden_witch_trials_strange_gods_part_one/)

I have selected the most pertinent passages from my great–(x16)–grandmother’s memoirs to illustrate the events of the Eden witch trials, during which she was one of many accused, tried, and convicted of practising witchcraft. My notes are in brackets.

*The formal examinations of Goody Jacobs,* [Sarah] *Oliver, and* [Sarah] *Williams took place in the last week of March. Goody Williams was first to be examined. She remained steadfast.*

“What do you say, Goody Williams, now that you face your accusers?”

*Goody Williams looked at the afflicted girls, all of whom screamed in terror. Ann Pearson claimed that her spectre was attempting to pierce them with pins.*

*The magistrate asked,* “What do you say to this charge?”

*Goody Williams answered,* “I have never hurt them. I have never even seen these children before. I am innocent as the child unborn.”

*The afflicted girls groaned in pain, and the magistrate asked,* “What contract have you made with the Devil?”

*Before she was able to answer, Mercy Whitcomb charged,* “She told us the Devil is her god!”

*Goody Williams shook her head, and the afflicted girls did the same. She answered,* “I made no contract with the Devil. I never saw him before in my life. I have never hurt those children.”

*The magistrate continued,* “Tell us the truth. How come these children are tormented? Why do they charge you and your cousins with doing so unto them?”

“I know nothing of it. We are innocent. I will not say we are witches for you to take away our lives,” *Goody Williams answered.*

*She was dismissed by the magistrate, and she was taken away by the jailers.*

*Goody Jacobs was examined next, and she was asked,* “Who do you serve?”

*She answered,* “I serve God.”

“What God do you serve?”

“The God Who made Heaven and earth.”

*The magistrate continued,* “How come these children are tormented?”

*Goody Jacobs answered,* “If I must tell, I will tell. It is Sarah [Oliver] who hurts these children. She has given herself to the Devil.”

*Before the magistrate was able to ask another question, Goody Oliver stood up, and cried out,* “You are a liar! I am no witch. May your lies damn you to Hell!”

*After Goody Oliver was reprimanded for her interruption, the magistrate continued examining Goody Jacobs, who protested her innocence to the end, before she was dismissed, and taken away by the jailers.*

*Goody Oliver was examined last, and she scornfully answered the magistrate’s questions while protesting her innocence. She implicated her sister as the “true witch.” Following their formal examinations before the Court, Goody Jacobs, Goody Oliver, and Goody Williams were scheduled to be tried in the first week of May.*

*On the night before the last Sabbath of March, I lie awake in bed, praying that God might grant me the gift of wisdom. Were the girls doers of His work? Or were they daughters of Satan? I was lost in thought as I heard a scream come from the woods to the back of the house. John was asleep. He did not stir. Had he not heard anything?*

As I read Mary’s memoirs, I felt like I was watching a horror film. *Please*, I begged, *Stay inside the house.* My fear only grew as I continued reading the memoirs. 

*As I approached the window to listen more closely, I heard it again. A scream from the woods. I was conflicted on whether or not to investigate the screams. I must admit I was scared, so I ultimately chose not to do so. I sat in the chair by the window, and around an hour later, I saw Mercy Whitcomb, Ann Pearson, Mary Hobbs, and Tamsin Dane all emerge from the woods, leading Sarah Whitcomb, her white shift drenched in crimson blood, toward the Whitcomb farm.*

*What happened in the woods?*

*After the Sabbath meeting in the morning, I tried to be inconspicuous as I followed the girls out of the meetinghouse. The girls gathered in the back, and I was only able to hear a part of their conversation before John escorted our family home.*

“It could not survive,” *Sarah said.* “’Twasn’t the right time.” *The girls nodded their heads solemnly, and Sarah continued,* “’Twas born dead.”

*Mercy and Ann spoke to Sarah, but I was unable to hear either of them. Tamsin asked,* “Did you name it?”

*Shaking her head, Sarah answered,* “No.”

*From what I heard of their conversation, I was able to glean that Sarah had given birth prematurely in the woods, but her baby was stillborn.*

*Yet I had an unanswered question nag me.*

*What did they do with the baby?*

*In the midst of the same week, Mr. Pearson led the entire Village to the meetinghouse. Entering the meetinghouse, we saw Sarah Whitcomb, her head and hands held in a pillory. The congregation gathered around her as Mr. Pearson announced from the pulpit,* “Sarah Whitcomb has played the harlot.”

*Her eyes cast downward in apparent shame, Sarah looked pale, her forehead beaded with sweat. She did not look well. Was it from the labours of unattended childbirth?*

*Mr. Pearson continued,* “She has committed the sin of fornication. For her crime, she shall be punished with ten lashes of the whip.”

*Handed a whip by Mr. Howe, Mr. Pearson directed Goody Reed to undo the back of her dress. He whipped Sarah three times after her back was exposed. She cried out in pain. Before the fourth lash, she screamed,* “I am innocent!” *Mr. Pearson stopped as Sarah continued,* “I was seduced!”

“Who seduced you?” *Mr. Pearson asked.*

“Nicholas Moss!” *Sarah confessed.* “He used his sorceries to make me lie with him!”

*The congregation looked at Nicholas Moss, a boy of about seventeen years, who was held by two men to prevent him from fleeing the meetinghouse.*

*Mr. Pearson approached him, asking,* “Did you seduce Ms. Whitcomb?”

*Struggling, Nicholas shook his head,* “We laid together, but I have done no witchcraft!”

*Despite Nicholas’ protests to the contrary, no one in the congregation believed Sarah Whitcomb would have surrendered her maidenhead willingly. It had to have been witchery.*

*Mr. Pearson had Sarah released from the pillory as Nicholas was arrested.*

*On the next Sabbath, Mr. Pearson was delivering his sermon when Mary Hobbs suddenly collapsed onto the floor, howling like a wounded animal. She claimed the spectre of a witch scratched her. When she was examined, there were three bloody scratches on her back.* “Who did this?” *Mr. Pearson asked. Mary cried out,* “Goody Sheldon!”

It was through research at the local library that I learned that Alice (“Alse”) Sheldon (née Martin; b. 1604 – d. 1684) was one of the oldest villagers in Eden. She was the wife of farmer William Sheldon (b. 1600 – d. 1690), with whom she had thirteen children. All of her children survived infancy into adulthood, which was a rarity for a time when infant mortality was high. She was a grandmother and great–grandmother many times over. Not only was she a devoted wife and mother, she was a pillar of the community, referred to as “the Image of a Christian Woman” by Rev. Samuel Pearson himself. A devout Christian, she was the godmother of many villagers, including Elizabeth Pearson (née Colson; b. 1660 – d. 1682), Rev. Pearson’s wife and Ann Pearson’s mother. She was highly esteemed by everyone in Eden Village. She was not the loathsome Goody Oliver, who cursed and swore, nor was she Goody Williams, who was “little less than [a] whore.” I scoffed as I read the accusation as recounted in Mary’s memoirs. No one would believe Goody Sheldon was a witch. It sounded ludicrous.

*I could not believe what I was hearing. Goody Sheldon? The girls have gone too far. No one will believe them now. However, I looked around at the congregation as they murmured among themselves, and I saw that most of them came to the conclusion that I thought was unthinkable.*

&#x200B;

Whatever smashed my laptop wasn’t smart enough to also smash my phone.

&#x200B;

I packed up my things yesterday and left the house. I didn’t really have anywhere to go. I just figured that maybe being in public would help. I set up in coffee shop… I figured that if anyone saw me suddenly fall asleep there, they’d check on me. Maybe they’d even save me from my dreams.

&#x200B;

It took a bit of searching but I managed to find the forum I’d posted on again and after drinking a large cold brew coffee, I tried clicking on it again. I think I might’ve felt a little woozy as I did… But I didn’t fall asleep this time.

&#x200B;

I wasn’t really sure what to expect on the other side of the link. I was kinda hoping for something a little more useful than some witchcraft blog, though.

&#x200B;

*The Demonologists Bible by Cara Vidal.*

&#x200B;

The website looked a little tacky… Like a church website, or something thrown together by a religious Mommy blogger, and the exact post the link led me to seemed a little out there. The photograph of Cara Vidal herself also looked a little sketchy. She was a woman in her thirties with oval glasses and long brown hair. In the photo, she wore a flower crown and some sort of housecoat with a really tacky floral pattern. She honestly looked like someone you’d expect to find on a cult compound. I would’ve clicked off it and looked for something less crazy… If it wasn’t for the image right at the top of the article.

&#x200B;

It was a black ink drawing of a large tree with dead branches snaking off into the sky around it. But the branches seemed to writhe, almost like tentacles. Shapes that resembled people hung from them. And in the center of the trees body, I could see screaming mouths with gnashing teeth and countless eyes, scattered around it…

&#x200B;

In the back of my mind, I heard a distant screaming. Maybe it was just a memory… Or maybe it was something I was really hearing. This was what I’d seen in my dream the night before. This is the tree I’d hung from.

&#x200B;

It was right there, on this page. And beneath that image was a name:

&#x200B;

***Rle'phamot***

&#x200B;

Suddenly, this blog seemed a lot less insane.

I scrolled down to read what ‘Cara Vidal’ had posted.

&#x200B;

*Among the Lesser Gods. Rle’phamot is perhaps one of the most active and the most dangerous. Some newer grimoires suggest that is it is a member of the Midnight Pantheon, or one of the Archdemons. But descriptions of a similar being independent of these pantheons exist in some Sumerian texts, implying that Rle’phamot was not always associated with either group.*

&#x200B;

*Rle’phamot has been called many dramatic names, including The Grief Eater, the Devourer of Despair and the Lord of Nightmares. It appears to be drawn to those shackled by sorrow, guilt and regret, tormenting them in their sleep and feeding off of them for a time, until they are weak enough for it to claim their soul and trap them in a state of eternal suffering, feeding on them for eternity.*

&#x200B;

*Some are strong enough to repel Rle’phamot, and only are fed upon for a short while before they escape its clutches. But others are dragged down by it, pulled into a pit of misery that grows deeper and deeper until it has torn their body and soul apart, so that it can take what remains and devour it. For those unable to escape the clutches of Rle’phamot, I offer this ritual.*

&#x200B;

*First, a ritual circle must be drawn. For those unfamiliar with it, I would recommend using a Malvian Cross sigil inside of it.*

&#x200B;

The article helpfully provided a picture of just what the fuck a Malvian Cross sigil was. It looked like it’d be easy enough to draw with some chalk…

&#x200B;

*Lay some bedding inside the circle. Most versions of this ritual recommend that the pelt of an animal be used, but this does not seem to be a requirement and I have not seen any instances where going without was an issue. You will need to sleep in this bedding. Ensure you are comfortable.*

&#x200B;

*Next, you will need a weapon. For the uninitiated not in posession of a ritual dagger, I can provide some simple steps to create one using a pocket knife or a kitchpossessionen knife. Simply take the knife, and inscribe it with the following set of runes. If you would prefer a more quality knife, you can visit my post on ritual knives and my recommendations on what to use/how to make your own or where to buy a quality base knife.*

&#x200B;

The next picture was of a kitchen knife with runes of some sort carved into the wooden handle. I didn’t bother looking up Vidals' advice on ritual knives. Something told me I wouldn’t have the time or the energy to make a fancy one.

&#x200B;

*When you sleep, Rle’phamot will inevitably come for you. If He has marked you as his prey, he will not stop until you hang from His branches with the rest of the damned souls. However, when you sleep, you must count on it.*

&#x200B;

*The Malvian Cross sigil will allow you to drag a piece of Rle’phamot back into the waking world with you. Outside of your mind, it will be vulnerable. It cannot be killed. Only one of the Ancient Gods could likely ever kill Rle’phamot. But it can be wounded and driven off. Only the ritual dagger, or another runed weapon can harm it. If at all possible, having a companion with a runed weapon would help. However I understand that this may not be practical for some. The dagger should suffice.*

*Fight to kill and if it pulls you back to sleep, remember that while it is using your own mind against you, it does not control it.*

*Best of luck… You have my prayers with you.*

&#x200B;

I clicked off of the post and smoothed down my hair, sighing. I wanted another coffee… The first one was barely even empty and I still felt tired. Opening the notes app on my phone, I made a list of the things I’d need. A knife with a wooden handle and some chalk. Simple enough, right?

&#x200B;

Part of me took a step back for a moment, looking at the list and questioning what I was about to do. I was going off of an article I’d read online about fighting some kind of Dream God who feeds on remorse, to deal with my nightmares! That was crazy, right?

&#x200B;

Then again, so was waking up with ligature marks on your neck, wounds in your chest, and scratches on your face. So was having a dream every night where someone killed me. Then there was the page image… The depiction of Rle’phamot… It was the same *thing* I’d seen in my dreams. It couldn’t all just be a coincidence. It couldn’t all just be in my head, and even if it was, maybe this would help. I had nothing else to try and nothing to lose.

&#x200B;

I had intended to book a hotel for the night and sleep there. But it honestly probably wouldn’t have made any difference. So I just went home after buying some sidewalk chalk, a knife set, and some more coffee. I started on the knife first. I had to go back to the blog a few times to make sure I got the runes right… But I managed.

&#x200B;

Next, I did the ritual circle. I moved the couch in my living room aside before drawing it. I copied the one I saw on Cara Vidals' blog exactly.  Then, I moved some of my blankets into the middle of the circle. I put my ritual knife under my pillow and then… Well. I went to bed.

&#x200B;

I’d be lying if I said I didn’t have any reservations about sleeping. After all I’d seen, I was afraid of what would happen if I tried again. But at the same time, my eyes were heavy. I hadn’t gotten a good, restful sleep in weeks. Even if my makeshift ritual bed didn’t look all that comfortable, I would’ve gladly passed out in it. So, I let my exhaustion win. I climbed into the makeshift bed and rested my head on the pillow. I slid my hand underneath to grasp the handle of the knife. Then I let out a sigh.

&#x200B;

Would it be wrong to admit that the last thing I thought about was Bianca? It felt… Wrong, thinking about her. We were done. She’d made that much clear.

I just… I wished we weren’t…

God, I wished we weren’t.

&#x200B;

I wished she was there with me, telling me that this was crazy or holding my hand and telling me it would be okay. Then again, if she’d been there, I probably wouldn’t be in the situation I was in, would I? If I’d been a better girlfriend, she’d still be there…

&#x200B;

*“You never want to leave your comfort zone! You’re always inside. You don’t want to go anywhere, you don’t even talk to me half the time. Look, I know you’re having a hard time Sadie. I do and I don’t want to make it worse. But I’ve tried to help. I’ve tried everything I can and you just… You just don’t put in the same effort. You just want to sit there, sad because things aren’t the way you want them to be without trying to make any changes. I can’t do it anymore… I care about you. I really do. But if you just want to wallow in your own self pity all the time, I don’t know what I can do. And it’s draining me… It’s so draining, being around you lately and I’m so tired of it… So I need to leave. Because I can’t sit there and wallow with you. I won’t. I’m sorry Sadie. I really am… I hope you can figure yourself out. I really do.”*

&#x200B;

God, I used to be so mad at her for that. She’d just left me because I was depressed? Who does that? But I’ve thought about what she said so many times…

&#x200B;

I look back at it, she and all I can see are the things she tried to do for the three years we were together. Weekend getaways, date nights, game nights, movies, TV… Little things just to try and spend some time with me. I usually just told her no. I was tired. I wanted to sleep. I wanted to be alone…

&#x200B;

How often did I even see her when we were together? A couple of times a week, maybe. And when we weren’t together, I’d get mad because she was texting me too much. Offering to stop by, bring me food, bring over a movie.

&#x200B;

I look back now and I see that she tried so hard to pull me out of the pit I’d fallen into. She tried. And I just let it all go to waste.

&#x200B;

I would have left me too.

&#x200B;

All that neglect and I had the gall to think of her as I tried to sleep and to wish I could tell her I loved her one last time. Maybe I was just being sentimental because I wasn’t sure if I was going to wake up. I don’t know.

&#x200B;

As I closed my eyes though, I thought about that night by the lake… And I slept.

&#x200B;

I was looking down at the mall from behind the glass window of a penthouse. I remember being seated at a small table, a boiled egg in a cup in front of me.

&#x200B;

Looking around, I spotted two small men the size of a child at opposite ends of the room, both dressed like a stereotypical butler. Neither of them spoke. They just stood stock still like sculptures.

&#x200B;

I sighed and looked back at the egg, before looking across the table. Bianca sat there, a sweet smile on her lips and a sultry look in her eyes. She reached across the table towards me, gently caressing my face. I closed my eyes, letting myself feel her touch, even if I knew it wasn’t real.

&#x200B;

*“Did you miss me?”* She asked.

*“Every day…”* I replied, *“I’m sorry… I know it doesn’t mean anything but, I’m sorry.”*

She pressed a finger to my lips.

*“Shhh… It’s alright. Soon it won’t hurt anymore. I promise…”*

&#x200B;

When I opened my eyes, Bianca was standing. She pushed the table out of the way. It crashed hard to the ground. I watched her reach up above my head, and looked up to see a noose waiting for me. It didn’t seem to be made of rope. The material looked slimy and organic, like some twisted, knotted tendril.

I moved quickly, pushing Bianca away from me. I watched her stumble back as I got up.

*“No more…”* I said, before running at her.

&#x200B;

I crashed into Dream Bianca and sent us both flying towards the window of the penthouse. The glass shattered against us as we both plummeted down to the ground. I held her tight and as I did… I woke up.

&#x200B;

I sat up in my makeshift bedding, gasping as I did. Then, I looked around.

&#x200B;

My apartment was quiet. Nothing out of the ordinary, not at first. I clutched the ritual knife in my hand before slowly standing up. It was just my own apartment… Quiet, with the mid-afternoon sun streaming through my closed windows.

&#x200B;

I let out a sigh of disappointment. The ritual hadn’t worked…

&#x200B;

Maybe I shouldn’t have been surprised. I headed over towards my couch to slump down into it, defeated. Maybe it would be the last of the nightmares at least. I could at least hope for that much. I put the knife down onto the cushion beside me and felt around for the TV remote. At least I didn’t feel as tired anymore. I wondered how long I’d slept.

&#x200B;

As I found the remote and held it up to the TV, I paused. I could see a reflection in the screen, me in my shorts and tank top sitting on the couch.

And someone else standing over the couch.

&#x200B;

With a sudden jolt of panic rising in my chest, I tried to turn, only to feel something cold and wet suddenly wrap around my throat. With impossible strength, I was dragged over the back of the couch and hurled to the ground. I tried to look up, tried to see what it was that had grabbed me.

&#x200B;

I’m not so sure that seeing it was a good idea.

&#x200B;

It looked like Bianca… Or, at least it looked similar to Bianca. She was nude, with a body that was identical to Biancas in all but a few key ways. Bianca had never had eyes in her torso. She’d never had mouths full of gnashing teeth there either. There were some open in her chest and stomach. Slimy pale tendrils seemed to split off of her body as well, some of them tipped with jagged teeth.

&#x200B;

The Bianca Thing grinned at me, a smile that was too wide and exposed crooked, inhuman teeth along with her human ones. It took a step forward and as it did, a new tendril reached out of a vertical mouth on one of her breasts. This one was slick with saliva and tipped with rows of teeth. She kept coming closer, moving slowly, as if she was mocking me. She had all the time in the world to kill me. And there wasn’t much I could do to stop her.

&#x200B;

I scrambled on all fours across my apartment, almost tripping as I tried to get around her. The Bianca thing shot towards me with impressive speed, cutting me off.

&#x200B;

Her jagged tendrils slashed at me, sending me stumbling back. I felt one of them leave a gash along my shoulder, earning a scream of pain from me before I turned and tried to run again. I hopped over the couch, grabbing for the runed knife before feeling one of the tendrils wrap around my torso.

&#x200B;

I felt my fingers brush against the handle of the knife. I closed my hand around it in the moment before I was pulled away and hurled into my kitchen. I crashed hard against my fridge and hit the ground gracelessly, groaning in pain as I did. The Bianca thing shot towards me again, stopping a few feet away to admire me.

&#x200B;

It was just fucking with me… Teasing me to see if I’d fight back.

Well, I didn’t want to disappoint it…

&#x200B;

Every bone in my body ached as I crawled deeper into the kitchen and used the counter to pick myself up. My hands were shaking. The Bianca thing was back to making a slow approach. I gathered myself for a moment, before rushing towards it, trying to drive the knife into its head.

&#x200B;

It moved to the side slightly, keeping its head out of my reach. But my knife still found a target. I drove it into the Bianca things shoulder and heard it cry out in pain. That scream sounded like nothing I’d ever heard before, like a demonic chorus who’d never learned how to play an instrument performing a concert out of tune…

&#x200B;

The Bianca things hand shot out, grabbing at my head. Its eyes widened and I felt myself suddenly falling backwards…

&#x200B;

When I opened my eyes, I was in the Mall again. Just outside the movie theatre. I blinked, looking down at the carpets. They had a weird art deco metallic, peacock feather pattern to them. I could’ve sworn the eyes of the feathers were moving and blinking. But it was hard to be sure.

&#x200B;

I looked up. Down the corridor, I could see the Bianca thing standing and waiting for me. She looked angry. Blood and pus gushed from the wound in its shoulder. I saw one of the tongues from a mouth that had opened in her arm reach out to try and lick the wound clean.

&#x200B;

With renewed purpose, I saw her approaching me. She was going to try and finish this inside my dream… I couldn’t let her. But as she drew nearer to me, I still felt a primal stab of fear in my chest. I struggled to think of something to do when I remembered something from Cara Vidal’s blog.

&#x200B;

*“And if it pulls you back to sleep, remember that while it is using your own mind against you, it does not control it.”*

&#x200B;

Here I was, asleep again.

In my own mind.

This was my dream! I should’ve been in control here! I needed something to help me… Something to protect me!

&#x200B;

I thought about Lauren Toussaint… My own heroine of France in a mythic age of dragons and beasts. Lauren Toussaint… Clad in plate armor, with an iron rapier and wooden shield. Lauren who would never be afraid of this beast. She’d slay it.

&#x200B;

I felt the sword in my hands. The plate armor came from nowhere and felt heavy around me as I willed myself to become Lauren. The Bianca thing paused, narrowing its many eyes as I transformed into something new.

&#x200B;

*“My dream, my rules…”* I said.

&#x200B;

The creature just let out a disdainful scoff.

&#x200B;

The metallic peacock eyes on the floor all seemed to widen. From them, rose several shapes. Countless figures, most of them I recognized, some I didn’t. I’d seen them all before. In other dreams… In other times. Monsters, or strangers that looked like monsters. Every nightmare I’d ever had rose up before me.

&#x200B;

*“We shall see…”* The Bianca thing hissed, before giving a dismissive wave of its hand.

&#x200B;

The nightmares began to move towards me… I gripped my sword tightly. Lauren wouldn’t be afraid. I wouldn’t either.

&#x200B;

As my nightmares came for me, I approached them in turn. As I did, I heard music begin to play… *Weapon of Choice by Fatboy Slim*.

I… have no idea why. I hadn’t listened to that song in ages. I don’t think I consciously willed the background music into existence. But I suppose it did help.

&#x200B;

My nightmares shuffled towards me. The first that came was a more recent one… Kat Brooke with a box of french fries. She popped one into her mouth, before pulling one out like a dagger and lunging toward me with it.

&#x200B;

I deflected it with my shield, before bashing it against her. The impact knocked the fries from her hands. With a swing of my sword, I cut off her head. I did feel a little bit bad about killing my favorite YouTuber. But it was just a dream.

&#x200B;

The next that came to me was a giant spider-like creature I’d seen in a dream years ago. It spread its front legs, hissing at me as I drew near. I cleaved the tips of its front legs off. The creature screamed before I drove the sword into its head. From the corner of my eye, I could see a pale figure with glowing red eyes running toward me… It looked a lot like Joey, a kid I’d known growing up. I vaguely remembered a dream where he’d been a vampire. He didn’t seem so scary now, and he was even less scary when I ran him through with my blade.

&#x200B;

The music was still playing. I was getting into a decent groove!

&#x200B;

I could hear the roar of an engine nearby. A bright light shone onto me as something sped towards me. I only had a moment to get a good look at it… But it almost looked like an octopus on a motorcycle… When did I dream about that?

&#x200B;

As the octopus sped towards me, I leapt out of the way of the speeding bike. It tore past me, crashing gracelessly into the mall's concession stand and exploding. As I watched the fire spread, I felt something thud against my back and heard a piglike squeal.

&#x200B;

I looked back to see a strange pig-creature with an oddly human face. It shrieked at me. I vaugely remembered having a nightmare about this… Whatever. I wasn’t phased by its attempt to scare me, and with a smug smile, I lopped its head clean off.

&#x200B;

More and more nightmares charged at me, each one more horrible than the last. But none of them phased me… I was Lauren Toussaint! I had no fear!

&#x200B;

As I ran through a weird owl creature I’d dreamed about in fourth grade, I looked at the last of the creatures the Bianca thing had summoned. It looked like a clown, and carried bunches of balloons in both hands.

&#x200B;

With a valiant cry, I sliced through the strings of the balloons. The clown watched as his balloons floated harmlessly up towards the roof. Then he looked at me. Then he looked at the floor and walked away looking dejected.

&#x200B;

There was nothing left standing between me and the Bianca thing now… And it just glared at me, tendrils writhing behind it as it stared.

*“That all you’ve got!”* I called.

It huffed in response.

&#x200B;

As it did, the carpet beneath our feet began to warp. The peacock eye pattern seemed to pull away from us as something rose from the floor. It took me a moment to realize just what I was looking at, and when I saw it… I’ll admit, I was a little bit intimidated. Maybe more than I needed to be.

&#x200B;

The creature that emerged from the floor resembled a massive peacock, but the feathers seemed to be made of steel. The neck was too long and serpentine. The eyes had an eerie green glow to them. It extended its wings, before flapping them suddenly. Shards of metal crashed into the empty floor around me. I raised my shield to deflect them, but one of them struck it head on, ripping through the wood and nearly impaling me.

&#x200B;

The shield was destroyed. I cast it aside and held my sword, ready to do battle with the Steel Peacock Dragon.

&#x200B;

It unleashed a wild, metallic screech before a beam of greenish energy shot from its mouth. I dove out of the way, running as fast as I could to avoid it. I ran so fast that I started to fly.

&#x200B;

As I soared through the air, I circled around the head of the Peacock. It looked up at me, green lasers emitting from its eyes. I only barely dodged them before letting myself drop down towards it. I brought my sword down on its neck, intending to behead it. But my blade just clanged against the metal. The Peacock struck me with its wing, launching me away. It fired another beam from its beak after me. I sprinted away to avoid it.

&#x200B;

Green flames jetted from its mouth. It spread its wings again, launching more metal plates towards me. I jumped up onto one of them, using my momentum to jump to another one in mid air, before taking flight again.

&#x200B;

The Peacock screeched in rage as its eyes began to glow. I saw myself flying towards its eye… And driving my blade into it. I told myself that this would kill it. And I knew it would.

&#x200B;

The sword pierced the Peacocks eye, causing green lightning to crackle as it emitted a final, agonized scream. I left my sword embedded in the beast's skull as I leaped away. The Peacock stretched out its body, launching steel plates everywhere. I saw its body cracking as it broke apart and at last, it exploded.

&#x200B;

The force of the explosion should have knocked me off my feet… But I decided it wouldn’t. My dream. My laws of physics.

&#x200B;

The Bianca thing stood, watching unimpressed as I defeated the last of its nightmares. It watched me for a moment longer, tendrils twisting and curling behind it in rage.

*“You’re not in control anymore…”* I said, leveling a finger at it, *“Not here. Not in my mind!”*

&#x200B;

The Bianca Thing tilted its head to the side… And then it spoke. But the voice that came from it wasn’t Biancas. No… It didn’t need to bother with her voice anymore. No need for illusions now.

&#x200B;

***“I have broken you once, child. I shall do so again.”***

&#x200B;

The Bianca thing vanished, before appearing in front of me again. With blinding speed, it drove one of its tendrils into my chest, tearing through my armor. I could feel the pain… I could feel the blood filling my lungs. I remember gasping, before being lifted and hurled aside.

&#x200B;

When I hit the ground, I was inside the movie theatre. Lauren's plate armor seemed to shatter as I landed, scattering around me like broken glass.

&#x200B;

I looked up at the screen… And was greeted by the sight of Bianca’s face. I could see the pain in her eyes. This was the way she’d looked when she’d left me.

&#x200B;

***“Your lucidity is meaningless against a construct not of your own mind, child…”*** The voice said. ***“You think the ability to fly in a dream, or slaughter your own nightmares has meaning? It does not. Outside your fantasies… You remain what you have always been... Food.”***

&#x200B;

I felt a tendril wrap around my neck and force me back, onto my knees. The Bianca thing stood behind me. She put a hand on my head, forcing me to look at the screen.

&#x200B;

I could see myself arguing with Bianca… I could see the day I got fired from my job. I could see the blank pages of my unfinished novel, along with the messy notes I’d made trying to make sense of the plot.

&#x200B;

***“What does Sadie Richards have in this world? Answer me this. What has Sadie Richards ever done? Who is she? Lonely… Forgotten… Failed… A sorry excuse for a girl. Unloveable. Abandoned. Better off in my embrace…”***

&#x200B;

“*No…*” I tried to say, “*N-no, I… I’m not… I’m not ready… I don’t want to die…*”

&#x200B;

***“Don’t you? We are inside your mind. Remember… I can sense your thoughts. The little idle wonder in the back of your mind… How hard would it be to tie a noose? Would anyone really care? Wouldn’t it be so easy… So peaceful to sleep and never wake up… Would they even miss you?”***

&#x200B;

The voice chuckled. I could feel tears filling my eyes. I wanted to scream, to tell it that it was lying… But I knew that it wasn’t. I’d thought of it a few times. Hanging was the idea that usually came to mind but… If I was ever going to do it. I’d use pills. It’d be painless that way, right?

&#x200B;

No! No, no, no… But I wouldn’t! I would never! It was just an intrusive thought that came into my mind when I was low! Everybody gets suicidal thoughts from time to time, right?

&#x200B;

***“You’re nothing, child… Better off as food.”*** The voice crooned, ***“Come… Let us end this…”***

The image on the movie screen changed again. Now, all I saw was the tree… The branches, the screaming souls… It loomed over me. A noose was waiting for me. The Bianca thing grabbed it and draped it over my neck.

&#x200B;

***“Surrender… It will be painful. But you will have purpose again. Is that not worth it?”***

&#x200B;

As tears streamed down my cheeks, I looked up at the sky, past the tree… And I told myself I could see something behind it. Something big and powerful. Something that would fix this.

&#x200B;

A space laser.

&#x200B;

There was a flash of red light in the distance. I felt the noose tighten around my neck… But we were still inside my mind.

&#x200B;

From the corner of my eye, I noticed the Bianca creature look up in alarm in the instant before the light consumed us all. I reached out to grab it by the hand. I felt the heat… I felt everything I was fade away into ashes.

And I couldn’t help but laugh.

&#x200B;

When the light faded, I was back in my kitchen. The Bianca creature still had its hand on my head. Its eyes were wide… Confused. I don’t think it grasped what had just happened. It didn’t move… It was just a split second.

&#x200B;

But I had my opening.

&#x200B;

With a cry of effort, I raised the knife in my hand and drove it into the Bianca creature's heart.

&#x200B;

It let out a startled gasp. Its grip on me relaxed as it staggered back. Its tentacles writhed in pain. Its eyes fixated on me, all of them. Its pupils were dilated in shock.

“Welcome to the real world…” I panted.

&#x200B;

The Bianca thing blinked slowly, staring at me in disbelief before it began to fall backward. It hit the ground with a heavy thud… Before it began to crumble into ashes. Within a few seconds, there was barely anything left of it, except for the runed knife, lying on the ground amongst the pile of scattered ash and dust. Once I knew it was gone, I finally allowed myself to breathe again.

&#x200B;

My legs gave out from underneath me as I collapsed to the floor, letting the tears flow freely at last. My hands were shaking. My body ached…

But I was free.

I could feel it.

I was finally free.

&#x200B;

I went to a movie that afternoon. Just by myself. I had some popcorn and a drink…

It was nice.

&#x200B;

Afterward, I went to a restaurant. I had an appetizer and a dessert. I know I shouldn’t have splurged, but it was just sort of nice to do it and enjoy myself for a little while.

&#x200B;

When I slept last night, I had a dream about a family living in a cabin and doing puzzles. No sign of Bianca in sight. At the end of it all, I didn’t die.  It was just a normal, weird dream, and felt like I slept better than I have in years

I’m thinking I’ll work on a different novel. Maybe take a break from the adventures of Lauren Toussaint. I’ll let it sit for a while and come back to that story when I’m ready. Maybe I’ll do some short stories. Find a place to post them online and see if I can’t build up an audience. It would be nice for someone to actually read my work!

I thought about calling Bianca today but… No. Maybe one day, I’ll reach out to her and see how she’s doing, and maybe then, if we’re both in the right place for it, we can try again. If not, then maybe we can just be friends instead. Maybe.

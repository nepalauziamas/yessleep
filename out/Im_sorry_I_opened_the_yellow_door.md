It was another day like usual as I sat in my office researching new things on textile and crafts. It was about a minute from my coffee break when I saw suited men greet my father Monsoon. When this happens usually once a weak, it means they go to that room behind the yellow door. Something that fascinated me, as he always told me to never go there.  


I grabbed my cup of steaming coffee and walked out of my office to watch them. Sure enough the men and my father walk to the door. My dad pulls out a silver key with a purple at the end and opens the door. When they left I went back into my office and drank some coffee.  


My curiosity rushed through my mind as I pondered many reasons why my dad wouldn't want me to go there. When my break finished I got back to work and in about 30 minutes my dad and the suited men would talk and go separate ways. My uncle was there as well, and went with them down the left hallway.  


That area was large and open with massive glass windows on each side letting light pour through. Housed there machines and conveyor belts, the usually stuff in a factory.  


I got tired of  this and wanted to get my hands on that key, I wanted to see what my dad is hiding from me. Before I could get the chance to sneak into his office my dad stopped me to talk.  


"How are you my beautiful daughter, come here!"  


My dad hugged me excitedly, he always had that positive joyful energy when around me and other people.  


"I know dad, not to go into the yellow room." I said sluggishly while rolling my eyes.  


"Come on now, don't be like that. I say it for a reason, and that is to protect you."  


I giggled. "Protect me from what? Trade secrets?"  


He laughed and placed his hands on his hips.  


"I don't think you can handle the best creation that will stomp out the Tremallow's, our main competitors in this town."  


"Can you at least remind me why you have a feud with them?" I whispered.  


He leaned in close to my ear as he wrapped his arm around my shoulder while we headed back to my office.  


"I'll tell you later when there aren't so many good listeners around, and I'm very busy at the moment."  


He patted my head and headed off towards my uncle to speak with him. Once he got about half way down the hallway I walked to his office and got inside. I looked around for a while and found the key with the purple mark. As I held it in my hand I remembered various rumors from co-workers that excited me. An urban legend or myth in the company is behind that very door.  


I got out and came up to the looming yellow door.  My heart pounded and filled me with anticipation. I used the key and entered inside, shutting the door behind me. I got a good look around, it was a massive room with many lines of cluttered shelves. It was cold I felt like I stood in a meat locker.  


As I walked I noticed cobwebs littering the corners and shelves, dust caked into the walls. I saw a bright light shine through the maze of cluttered shelves, I headed towards it because the darkness was creeping me out.  


After making my way through the walkway I entered a massive clearing. At the very end at the wall of the room was a figure working atop of a bunch of tables. They knitted quietly while stopping frequently to write on papers. I walked closer and said,  


"Greetings, I'm the daughter of Monsoon, who might you be?"  


It stopped and turned to wave at me but froze. When it fully turned around it balled up its fists and shook, its head t witching for a while. It turned behind it and grabbed the massive sewing needles. They were long as a ruler with the diameter of a pencil.  


I got a look at its appearance. Big threads in an "x" pattern as if to sow a mouth that wasn't there. That was the only facial feature it had. It wore a sewed patchwork cape that flowed behind it jaggedly ripped and cut.  


The creature roared in my direction and it threw the needle into my right shoulder from afar like a javelin. I screamed in pain and gasped, I didn't process what happened as I watched blood pour down my body and coat my hands. I couldn't remove it as I would bleed even faster.  


It barreled towards me with the other needle in it's right hand. From it's hands it shot out two threads which wrapped around the two shelves in front of me that stood on each side of the open walk space and pulled them together. I ducked as the two threads slashed together making a whipping noise.  


I got back up and climbed over the shelves to keep going. It lifted the shelves with ease to pursue me. It kept using threads to pull down more obstacles to block my escape. Dust kicked into the air in puffy black clouds which made me cough and wheeze. It could up and grabbed me by the throat and pinned me against a shelf. I reached around and found a hammer and swung at it's head, knocking it back.  


I fell to the ground just in time for the creature to lunge forward and stab my left leg. I screamed in pain, hoping someone would come help me. But nobody could hear me from this room. I desperately picked myself up and kept moving towards the door.  


I saw it coming and pulled a shelf down before it could get to me. With this distraction I got out and shut the door behind me. I jumped as the creature banged on the door so I tried to make a sprint for it. The door opened and it came running out.  


I went in the direction of my uncle and dad to get their attention.  


"Dad, William, help me!" I yelled.  


The workers around me ran away in terror as I was being hunted down. The people fell over each other in a stampede and pushed through exits. My dad saw me and immediately ran with William to help me. The creature caught up and wrapped its right arm around me. It held the needle against my neck.  


My father got close and repeated a phrase that I will never forget.  


"Hutota Hutota!" He cried  


The creature came halted and dropped the needle. It backed away from me putting its hands on its face.  


I was weak from the blood loss and in so much pain, I fell into my fathers arms sobbing.  


"I'm so sorry! I should have listened" I yelled  


"I told you not to go into the room! But it's alright, I'll explain everything to you later."  


My dad quickly looked at my uncle and rested a hand on his shoulder.  


"Please William, can you take her and call an ambulance, I have to fix this"  


"Got it, come on I got you, you're gonna be alright now."  


William picked me up and carried me down the hall towards an office. As he quickly moved I took the time to look back at my father and the creature. He was talking to it expressively before walking into the room with the yellow door and shutting it behind them.

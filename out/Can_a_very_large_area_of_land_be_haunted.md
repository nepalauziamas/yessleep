My Mom grew up in a haunted house. She was one of 7 siblings, three brothers and three sisters. Everyone in the house, including my Grandparents experienced things. Many times, they were all together and had the same experience at the same time, other times, it may just be one of the brothers or sisters, or a couple of them. Disembodied heads, laughing while nodding  back and forth outside a second story bedroom window witnessed by two of my aunts who shared the room, and a friend that was staying over with one of them, while the headless body walked the house downstairs on the main level witnessed by other siblings and my grandparents. My Aunts told their visiting friend that it must be the brothers playing a prank, and played it off in that manner.

A woman in white roaming the fields. She's currently still there as of last week, and looks the same according to the current owner.

Many times, while everyone was seated at the table, the creaky door handle would turn - my Mom says everyone would completely freeze - the door would open, footsteps were heard coming into the house, door would close, something unseen would whistle a tune as it proceeded down the hallway. My Mom says she can't reproduce the tune, I've asked her, she says if she ever heard it again she would instantly recognize it. It's burned into her memory, she just can't recreate it.  My Grandmother says the same thing.

&#x200B;

My uncle was badly burned on the bottom of his foot while sleeping. He's a tall guy and his foot was hanging out from under the blanket. When he awoke from the pain, he saw a ghost dragging its finger up the bottom of his foot, near the end of his bed. He says it was misty-black, kind of see through, but the face was horrible.

&#x200B;

There are dozens of stories I’ve heard all of my life, told from aunts and uncles, and even my grandmother, who really doesn’t like talking about it at all. Many times they would have visitors over, and those visitors had the same experiences.

&#x200B;

They lived there two years (It was a rental), and moved when they were financially able. When they moved out, the family that moved in after them shared some experiences, including a ghostly black panther growling (It was explained more as a screaming) as it ran down the hallway, jumping on top of the wife/mother who was sleeping on the bed, pinning her down until it vanished. One of the children (a daughter) had a kitten, and was in the house alone playing with it upstairs while the father was tending the garden outside. He heard horrible screams and ran upstairs to find the daughter covered in blood, holding the cats body - but the head was on the floor. There were no knives in the room, or anywhere nearby that it could have happened. No blood trail. It's not like she did it in the kitchen and ran upstairs. Not to mention, she was 4 years old. The only words that child has spoken since were “it’s head just fell off”. She was eventually institutionalized and remains so to this day. This I've verified personally, as it's easy enough to look her up by name, and verify where she is.

&#x200B;

Back in the 90s, my Mom along with two of her sisters went back to the house and took their camcorders - those huge video recorders that held an entire VHS tape in them. They turned the cameras on while they were still in the car, in the driveway. They videoed each other. The video was never stopped by either of them. They went inside, and when my Mom steps on the first step to go to the second story of the house, the video blinks out and immediately back in as you see my Mom stepping off of the bottom step. They were upstairs for 20 minutes, and neither camera caught a single second of footage above the first step. I was a kid then, but they still have this tape, and I've seen it myself. Although it wasn't something scary, it's odd nonetheless.

&#x200B;

 The house was completely dilapidated in the video - many satanic (I'm guessing here... Could be Aramaic or Sumerian for all I know.) symbols, half burned candles, pentagrams painted on the floor. Apparently, a group or some kids had been messing around in there. We don't know what they were up to or who they were, but odd choice of location, unless it's somehow related - no idea if it is. The house was eventually bulldozed in the late 90's or early 2000's. The property owner gave that farm to his daughter, who built an underground house there - about 20 feet in front of where the old house sat.

&#x200B;

Recently, I took my Mom out for a ride around a local state park looking for wildlife. Just getting out of the house really. While we were riding around, I brought up the house and the road and told her I'd tried to find it recently but couldn't (google maps won't get you there, it can't locate it). I asked her if she’d take me there. She said she would. We headed out that direction, it was a 20 minute drive or so. When we finally got near the driveway, Mom asked me to slow down so we could look. As luck would have it, the current owner was in the yard.

&#x200B;

So this is a huge web of happenstance and chance encounters, but long story short my Mom met the current owner a while back at church. Once they realized who they were, and how they were connected, they agreed to sit and share stories, and did just that a while later. They've stayed in contact since.

&#x200B;

We meet the current owner in the yard, and she spends some time catching up with my Mom. It was the first time I'd met her personally. The conversation almost immediately turns to the location of the old house. Mom points it out to her, it was adjacent to a (very) creepy well that is covered somewhat. Then the owner starts sharing some new stories with my Mom.

&#x200B;

Owner lives alone. Has a mid 20's Daughter who has a toddler. Daughter refuses to stay in the house alone, but sometimes stays with her Mom if she's been watching the toddler for her.

&#x200B;

She was "attacked" (her words, not mine) by a "mini tornado" in her yard while sunbathing. She heard a metal clanking noise and looked up, and saw a 10 foot tornado moving across the field toward her. She pointed to an area at the edge of the yard and said "when it got to that point I went in the house - I didn't want to deal with it" The weather was sunny, and no wind was blowing any of the surrounding trees.

&#x200B;

She was in the shower and had that "feeling" that she was being watched. She turned off the water and got out of the shower and there were 6 Native American Indians standing shoulder to shoulder in her bathroom watching her. She screamed and they disappeared.

&#x200B;

She had visitors over, and one of them kept looking out the front window of her living room. She asked her if someone had pulled into the driveway, and the visitor said "No, but there is a man in full 'Indian' dress walking back and forth at the end of the driveway" The current owner stood up and went to the window. She also saw it. They went outside and it was gone.

&#x200B;

A woman had stopped at the house to deliver something she had bought from her, and the woman's boyfriend (husband?) waited in the car. She said they chatted for a few minutes, and the husband didn't even knock, just came running in the door screaming "we are leaving now! get in the car NOW!". Later on, she found out the guy in the car looked in his drivers door mirror and an 'evil' face was grinning back at him.

&#x200B;

The current owner says she feels a "man" crawl into bed with her many nights. It wakes her up, or she will be reading and it happens. Mattress sinks in, whole bed moves. She doesn't see that one though.

&#x200B;

She was attacked in the creek by what she said was a VERY large reptile type creature. She said she only saw the tail clearly, as it slowly pulled up out of the creek and into the grass. She said it was either an alligator or a dinosaur (again, her words, not mine) - that's the only things she could compare it to. There aren't any alligators in my state. It came at her fast, she screamed and flailed her arms, and it disappeared. She wasn't hurt in any way.

&#x200B;

She said she was sleeping and something grabbed her by the head and held a pillow over her face until she thought she was going to die, then it just stopped. She said no one was in the room.

&#x200B;

When she's babysitting the toddler (her grandchild), the toddler has conversations with people she can't see. She swears it's not just jibber jabber. It's his whole side of a conversation she can't hear. Hard to say on that one, but creepy all the same.

&#x200B;

Toddler has handprints and whelps on him that are unexplainable. He's fine when he gets there in the morning, they just show up. She says small handprints and whelps. Child sized. Much smaller than her or her Daughter. They know it's not abuse because he's not with anyone else.

&#x200B;

She frequently sees the woman in white my Mom and her family saw so many years ago. She hears the whistling. She hears a lady moaning in pain near the well. She sees ghosts in her barn regularly.

&#x200B;

And this is just one property. The rest of the families on the road all share stories and talk. Other families have seen the laughing head my Aunts saw. Others have seen the Native Americans. Others have been injured, burned, slapped, attacked by animals that don't exist. You name it, they're all experiencing it.

&#x200B;

My Grandfather saw his deceased Mother. The first night they moved in, a black bird flew into the kitchen storm door (which was glass) and smashed through it into the floor dead. It happened again on the second night, and again on the third. There are SO many stories, this doesn't scratch the surface. Something is up out there. I think it's some kind of portal, or the "veil" is somehow thinner out there. It's more than just a regular ghost story. All the strange animals, the dead kitten, the attacks.

&#x200B;

That's about all of the writing I've got in me today. Thanks for hanging in there, I know it's a lot to read, but it's the truth as I know it to be told by many.

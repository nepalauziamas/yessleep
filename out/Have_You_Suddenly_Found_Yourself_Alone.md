***Second Attempt at making this and trying to make it good. Wish me luck.***

Were you once in a bustling mall, or a crowded movie theater, anywhere with a lot of people but when you left to another room, suddenly, all that noise previously had ceased suddenly? Well, I am deeply sorry, but you are no longer in the place you originally entered, you're in a new place entirely, and you need to start preparing for the worst now.

First and foremost, this room is safe, **For Now.** You will notice that you still have access to the internet (of course you do, you're reading this now).

1. Search the room around you, do not worry about making noise, nothing can get you where you're at for now. Pick up any and EVERYTHING that can either be used as a weapon or as a distraction.

2. Do not trust the clock on your phone for this time, nor a timer. You are in their domain now and will use your electronics to lead you into traps, do not trust your electronics.

3. Do not let the silence outside fool you, even if you don't feel as though you need to prepare, or can NOT prepare due to the room you're trapped in, do not leave for at LEAST an hour, they are very curious and are waiting outside for you.

4. Attempting to make a call despite your access to the internet is not something you should do, once again, they control your electronics, they can make you hear whatever it is you want to hear to get you to exit the room.

5. If you had started making noise, CONSTANTLY make noise until you are ready to leave, do not stop making noise for any longer than 15 minutes if you are going to resume making noise, they will think you left due to the silence and disperse, however, will return and stay if they hear continued noise after the silence.

6. Once you are fully prepared, wait 15 minutes (as long as it does not bring you over, or even close to, the hour of safety. They will be there.) before leaving the room.

6a. If you failed to follow rule 5, I am sorry, they are waiting for you outside of the door. Nobody will hear your screams.

7. Once you are safely outside you will notice that the place you walk in to is... exactly the place you entered, however, no people or animals will be present. DO NOT TURN AROUND TO FACE THE ROOM YOU LEFT. The door is shut, you will merely end up wasting time trying to re-open it.

8. Talk, Laugh, Cry, it doesn't matter, you will realize that nothing makes a sound while outside the room. You will not even hear your own heartbeat, you must not allow this to get to you. Count up from 0 as you walk, count your steps, anything to keep your mind focused and sane.

9. Nothing makes sound, not even the things in the area, they are as silent as you are forced to be, make sure to stay attentive, they may not be able to hear you, but their sight is way better than yours, stick to the shadows, it's safer there.

10. If you happen to hear footsteps off in the distance you need to run. However, going the opposite direction of the footsteps will get you killed. Their dimension is their kingdom, remember? Run TOWARDS the footsteps.

10a: Ignore the shadows, they are not really there. Go the opposite way of the way you're going, go TOWARDS the shadows, they're trying to push you into a trap. Show them you're not scared.

11. The footsteps should have faded out by now. That's good, take a break. As long as you do not hear those footsteps you will be safe.

12. Any food or drink items you find are safe for consumption, it would be in your best interest to collect as many of these items as you can before finding a place to take shelter.

13. If your phone vibrates, or signifies in any way that you have received a message from ANYONE, ignore it, it is not anyone you would like to talk with.

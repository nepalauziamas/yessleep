I was sitting at my desk, staring at my computer and surfing the internet. \[I know Halloween is basically two months away but still. It's better to just have everything beforehand.\] I'm big on eBay and Etsy, yknow, supporting small businesses. So after spending like twenty minutes on eBay and finding nothing I liked, it was onto Etsy.

The first thing I typed into the search bar was ‘scary masks’ and then waited for results. I scrolled down a bit, then came across a profile with a picture I recognized from an artist I liked. I clicked on the picture and watched as my screen switched itself to their profile.

Assuming by the name ‘Brandon Gonner’, they were probably a guy. I looked at his about me and it said he made masks and props. I clicked away and looked over his profile more. He followed no one and he also had no followers. His favorited shops were public, and the only thing he had favorited was a knife shop. He also had two collections of his own products. One was labeled ‘Masks’ and the other ‘Props’. 

I clicked on ‘Masks’ and scrolled through. All of the masks were what seemed to be human and animal faces, all made with surprising detail. Unlike the human ones, the animal ones seemed to be made to give off the appearance of being stretched. Honestly, it kinda creeps me out, how realistic they were. As if he had actually stretched the face of a real animal.

I singled out one of the masks. A mask that appeared to be the face of a man, with rugged cream skin and a scar dragging itself along its cheek. Freckles were littered across its face, and it had a light stubble. Again, the attention to detail was incredible. And it would be great for a costume I had in mind.

I quickly got my credit card from my drawer and bought the mask. When I had officially confirmed the order, I wasn't expecting to get a message from Brandon. 

Brandon Gonner: *Thanks for the purchase :) you're my first buyer!!!* 

Me: ***Oh, np \^\^ I just needed a mask for Halloween and yours looked pretty cool***

Brandon Gonner: *I'm gonna throw in a few extra treats for you. A couple props maybe? And an animal mask, since you were so kind*

Me: ***You really don't have to, you should sell those*** 

Brandon Gonner: *No no I need them off my back. They're taking up space in my apartment*

After that I didn't reply. I waited with anticipation until my package came the following Monday.

The box was bigger than I expected. It was a plain cardboard box, with no stickers or writing on it at all, which was strange, but I knew it had to be my order. I wasn't expecting anything else.

But the smell was even stranger. I could smell it before I even opened the box. It was putrid and sour. I tried to breathe through my mouth but I could taste it on my tongue, so I immediately closed my mouth.

I sat down on my couch, package in my lap and a knife by my side. As I drug my knife through the tape, my roommate came up behind me, his hand gripping the couch.

“Hey, Carrie.” He looked over my shoulder. “What's that?” I drug my knife through the rest of the tape and opened the box. “Oh, nothing. Just stuff I got for Halloween.” 

The mask I had originally ordered was on top of everything else. Nothing was wrapped, just lazily thrown on top of each other. I spotted a cat mask underneath my human one, making itself quite noticeable with its orange fur.

I picked up the human mask and examined it. There were threads in the cheeks connecting themselves behind the face, which was probably so I could put it and wear it, just like a normal mask. 

I ran my hands over the cheeks and immediately drew back. It felt like real skin. Like my skin.

“Freaky,” Jayden said, leaning over the couch. “I know right,” I said, turning my head to look at him.

His mouth was turned down into a frown, and his eyebrows were furrowed. “That looks super real. What else is in there? You got props?” He reached over my shoulder, pulled a hand out of the box, and then dropped it immediately. 

“Ew.” He drew his hand back and wiped it on the couch like it had something on it. “What is that made of?”  

“I have no idea. Weird, right?” I grabbed the mask and waved it jokingly in front of Jayden's face, earning a loud groan and an eye roll. He shoved my hand away and looked at me again. “That smells like literal shit. Are you seriously gonna wear it?” 

“Duh. I’ll just wipe it down or something.” I put the mask back in the box and closed it. “I don’t know what I’m gonna do with all the random body parts though.” “Just keep them away from me. And for the love of god please put that in your room before it smells everything up.” He called, walking over to the kitchen. 

“I should just put it in your room. It already reeks of weed and B.O,” I told him as I stood up, the box in my arms. “It does not.” He said, opening the fridge. “Whatever,” I mumbled, walking to my room.

I put the box in my closet, pushing it over on the top shelf above my clothes. I really hoped it wouldn't stink up my closet, or my clothes. 

I went to my bed and sat down, pulling out my phone and checking my notifications. The local news app I was subscribed to had posted a new article. It was headlined ‘man found dead in park, police say it’s the most gruesome thing they've ever seen.” 

\[I won't take a screenshot, since it wont allow me too. I’ll just copy and paste some of it down below.\]

*At six twenty-two am, the police got a call from a woman going on a jog at \[redacted\] park. Upon the police's arrival, she claims to have spotted a leg poking out a bush, and went to check on whoever it may have been. When she went to go check, she found that the leg wasn’t attached to a body, prompting her to call the police. “At first I thought maybe it was just a prop. Like a gag someone left there to freak people out. But the smell was so bad, and it looked so real,” she said.*

*Police searched the park and found a dead cat and man. His leg was missing, matching up with the one the jogger had found in the bushes. The police did not find a collar on the cat, nor did they find a face. The man currently remains unidentified, as his face was missing, as well as one of his hands.* 

*The investigation will continue, and the woman will be brought into questioning as well as other possible suspects.* 

They did write more, but I didn't find it necessary to post all of that. I removed the park name since it's not really a good idea to post the location of a park located right by where I live. 

I know I'm probably overreacting– like I don't even know what that man looked like, or the cat. But it was so near to my house, and they looked so real. The coincidence is insane. And the smell is so bad, like it's actually rotting. As I'm writing this I can smell the stink leaking out of my closet.

I was really just gonna leave it and ignore it, but I don’t know if I should take it to the police or not. And a couple of minutes ago I got this message from the seller. It's like he knows I'm thinking about it, and I'm really really regretting buying from him.

Brandon Gonner: *Did you like the masks?? Sorry about the smell btw, the guy I got it from really stunk.*

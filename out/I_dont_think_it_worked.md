 

I work at a research center in the middle of bum-fuck nowhere, I am the head researcher and I have been the center of a good portion of scientific break thoughts. I won't tell you my name for reasons that I can’t tell you. My team and I have been working on new space technology that could give us a boost to interstellar travel. To make a long story short; it worked, we got it to work. Even if it was for 1.346 seconds it worked. What we were working on was a slip-space generator. We were able to project a portal for that 1.3 seconds, but the energy consumption was so great it tripped countless breakers and blew up the onsite transformer. Luckily we were able to get someone out here to fix it. After that we got a message up the chain of command to someone with enough power to get us enough energy to keep it open for an extended period of time. The next time we opened it up we could keep it open for 30 seconds before it tripped the breakers. We sent another message up the chain and got enough energy to keep it open for 1 minute. 

I’m going to condense the next few tests: Test 1,2,3, and 4, camera cut out as soon as it was sent through. Test 5, and 6, camera was spit out onto an alien planet covered in sand and rocks. Test 7,8,9,10, and 11, the rover was spit out on its side, unable to move. Test 12, the aerial drone flew around with extreme difficulty and lost control not long after leaving the portal. Test 13, and 14, the drone flew around for 1 minute before the portal closed, cutting the signal. The final two tests used humans, and honestly, I need to throw all sense of formality out the window, these tests are fucked up, these files are classified for more than just because the public couldn’t handle them. Test 15; thanks to the major progression with the project we now have and hours worth of energy. To cut down on energy we decrease the size of the portal to a 2 ft square and that drastically cuts back on energy consumption. This first team consisted of 1 scientist, 1 engineer, 2 guards, and 1 communications specialist.

We gave them the latest and best gear for the job which consisted of O2 tanks, camera’s, tow lines, and as close as we could get to space suits without paying millions of dollars. They went through without a hitch and got tossed out, thankfully causing no damage to the equipment. As they moved around they noted that the air here consisted of mainly carbon dioxide, hydrogen, and strangely enough no oxygen. They moved for a while, taking notes on the atmosphere, and landscape. The scientist took samples of the sand, and rocks. The sky was a light blue haze that gave it an almost earthly feel. One of the guards pulled out binoculars and looked through them in the distance, informing the other of what she saw, that being blocky structures. We informed the group that they had reached the 30 minute mark and to set their timers for 20 minutes before the tow lines pulled them back. They started jogging to the structures. Within 10 minutes they had made it halfway there only for the feed on the cameras to start going fuzzy. As we start yelling through the comms to back up so we can get a better signal the feed cuts completely and the comms go down. Some shouts from the portal room that the portal has gone dark and the tow lines were cut. When they pulled the tow lines back in we found that it was a clean cut. This was bad because the line was made of steel wires braided into a rope that was 2’ thick. A clean cut like that would require a shit ton of force.

Test 16; we manage to shut down the portal and let it charge for 15 minutes, which leaves it at full charge. We find a way to move the wall, after that we arrange another team of five, consisting of 3 guards, and 2 medics. We had a rover on standby, only to dismantle it and toss it through the portal. We tell the team how to put it back together and send them off, leaving two extra guards at the entrance to the portal to make sure the same thing as before doesn't happen. It takes them 10 minutes to get the rover back together and set off in the direction they headed. It only takes 15 minutes to make it to the same place as where the feed cut off but the only sign of anyone being there was the footprints, rifle rounds, and a singular glove. As they moved forward they saw the footprints make their way into the town, along the way they saw a singular splat of blood, and a pair of footprints disappear.

The second team made their way into the town and found a suit from the first team but on closer inspection they found out that there was a body inside but it was heavily decomposing and decomposing at an extraordinary rate. Within a second there was a fresh skeleton inside the suit and then nothing but dust. One of the guards jumped off the rover and looked at the suit and found that a rock had been thrown through the visor and when the guard ran his hand across the suit itself his glove started disintegrating from the fingers back. He shouted and threw his glove but it was too late, his hand was getting eaten down to the bone and soon he was nothing. The rover suddenly cut out then everyone started running from the rover searching for the rest of the first team. After 5 minutes of searching they found the one other person, already dead. As they moved throughout the town they found the last person. But as the team approached the person shot at them, causing the guards to draw their weapons.

After seeing who it was the engineer stood up and started rambling about anything and everything. They started leading him back outside the town so they could be taken back via tow lines. They retraced their steps and made it through where the rover used to be. But when the tow line was activated the line had been cut again. So now they started walking back. As they did they heard the exit guards shouting about a massive creature heading their way. As they heard this they saw a sand colored monster crawling toward them, at incredible speeds. I won’t sicken you with what I saw but I’ll tell you now that none of them made it. We activated the tow lines for the guards which thankfully pulled them in, though I will add, with extreme difficulty. But this story isn’t over, the portal failed to close and as we tried to find ways to close it someone pointed out that the creature was closing in on the portal and was not slowing down. Within seconds there was a very long arm flailing around the portal room killing anything it could get its hands on. It smashed through the control room window, which I was in, sending glass everywhere. Some went through me and around me. Through all of its flailing it smashed the portal projector, closing the portal, slicing its arm off. 

We all left the project but the higher echelons have other plans, they keep asking me for the blueprints, or the materials, or whatever they need that relates to that, I keep telling them that it’s too damn dangerous. I went back a week ago, to the facility that is, and I burned it to the ground, made sure that whatever was left from when I left was gone, then I told the higher ups to fuck off and leave me alone. The problem is, one of the major power grids in the U.S. just failed due to “heavy usage” and I feel like they're trying to make another portal to that god forsaken place. I don't think burning the facility to the ground stopped them any. Please forgive me, I wasn’t trying to start the end of the world. 

once more, please forgive me.

This is something that happened a while back. I was just sitting in front of the computer playing games. I went to get some water from the tap and I noticed strange footprints on the ground. Not even shoe, more like animalistic. It was strange, since I’ve been home for days doing nothing and no animal had gone inside. It was a small student apartment as well so it wasn’t really frames of me missing an animal walking in and out. And most important I had not had the door nor window open at all, just little ajar for fresh air to come in but observing the prints no animal of this size could have made its way inside.

I tried to erase the thought and just cleaned the floor. Luckily, the prints were mostly made of dirt, so it was easy to wipe off. There weren’t even many of them in the first place. If I remember correctly around three?

But that was only the first time. The second time it was the same situation, but even more prints. It began from my terrace door, leading in my direction. This time, I jumped in my seat as I turned to the side and saw the prints. After calming down, I noticed the animal, or whatever it was, had two legs most likely. Seeing the pattern of the prints.

Which made even less sense. What animal has two legs and has animalistic prints like this? After the second time, I made sure to keep my terrace door closed fully, even if it meant that the heat would increase drastically in my small apartment.

I was always vigilant as well. I’d never seen the prints appear myself. They would just spawn there without any reason. So days after the second encounter, I was always on guard. Keeping a lookout for any suspicious activity and trying to figure out how they appear. But it didn’t happen. Nothing. At that point I had become so invested it became more of a disappointment rather than relief.

Around two weeks after the second encounter in the evening, I took a shower and was preparing myself for bed. But I froze. I turned to the terrace door as the evening sun shone brightly inside my apartment. The prints began appearing in front of me. Following the prints also came a light thud. Something was definitely there, walking towards me. I’d never heard of the thud before since I’d been wearing headphones at the time. My heart rate increased, my palms sweaty and all I wanted to do was to look away but I couldn’t.

Hearing the thuds become louder and louder slowly approaching me was haunting. The prints stopped close to me and I closed my eyes. After a few seconds, I peeked with one open and still nothing. I turned my head to the side as I was going back into the bathroom just to close the door out of fear I saw it. In the corner of my eye, for a millisecond it appeared. Even though it was only for a split second, I could see all of its features. It’s almost blue/grey skin, faceless face with the exception of the circular mouth full of teeth. Long and skinny limbs with giant claws. A monster.

Terrified, I locked myself inside the bathroom and sat down on the floor, hugging my knees. But only mere seconds after, I could feel something passing through my body. I don't know how to explain the feeling but I just knew. Like a spirit had passed through. And again, the prints appeared. I stood up immediately and ran out of the apartment via the terrace door. The sun had gone down and the sky had mostly turned black.

But there I was, wrapped in only a towel running for my life. I’d never been so terrified my whole life. I didn’t see any of the prints following me, and it took an hour or so for me to even try to go back. But eventually I did. As I came back, there prints were everywhere around the floor. I mopped them away as soon as I could just to get my mind off things. And luckily, there was no more to be made.

I went to bed, clearly awake. How could you sleep? All I thought about was that beast. I looked up into the ceiling but that's when I noticed.

The tracks on the ceiling made their way down the wall to my side. And in the corner of my eye as I slowly followed the tracks, the monster's face was a thumbs distance away. I kept that exact position with my head and I could see it clearly. It breathed into my face and the stench was unbearable. The teeth almost breathed with the body. It gurgled as its hands were above my face, with its claws moving up and down, like it was waiting for its meal.

I held my breath as drops of sweat ran down my forehead. As well as clenching my fists and rapidly blinking. Laying there as a statue, I didn't know what to do. But I gained some courage. I kept that position so I could still see it, grabbed a pillow and just hit it.

The monster screeched loudly, and I could see the prints on the floor leaving my apartment. It had probably become startled when I could see it. After that, I probably passed out.

The next day I woke up in a pile of sweat and with my eyes wide open, looking for tracks anywhere. And since that day, it hasn’t come back. But I always keep one ear open when I play games, to be safe that the thuds won't come back.

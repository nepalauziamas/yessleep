So I started seeing this girl eight months ago. I was just sitting on a bench where I read everyday and she just randomly came up to me and we started talking. I mean I dint complain because I do not get much female attention and she was ***hot***.

We ended up going on a few first dates and it was all amazing. However, about a month in, (in hindsight) she started pushing pretty hard to move in with me. I'm a nice guy and I figured she might be in some sort of trouble financially or otherwise so I allowed her to stay a few nights, when it worked out I said sure yeah, just move in. Weirdly, she only had like two or three boxes of stuff. This is where I should have been hearing alarms but again, one of the most physically attractive girls I have ever talked to in my life and she wants to date *me*.

Anyways, time goes on and I learn her whole family lives outside of the U.S..... all in separate countries. Again, I should have heard alarm bells but at the time I did not. I just assumed she was really wealthy or something, which again, another bonus.

She said she worked at a coffee shop and was adamant that I don't come and visit her because she needed to focus but also had really weird hours.... and no uniform. She explained this away by saying it was a small family owned shop and they couldnt afford uniforms. But then again, she would leave at like ten PM at night in the middle of a movie we were watching saying they "called her in to close".

Another strange thing is she always insisted she come pick me up from work and really wanted to meet my coworkers. Regular possessive GF stuff I guess.... but again, looking back I work at one of the largest banks in America in a pretty high security/high clearance job. I work part time there and part time at home.

One of the weirdest occurrences I had was when she got a call from her brother who was speaking spanish but not spanish, I used the google translate on my phone to translate and it was Portuguese. basically he told her someone named Rich had died. Thats all the speaker could make out. She didn't seem that torn up about it but then I dropped my phone right outside of the door and like a switch she started crying. She told me before Rich was her uncle and so I tried to comfort her. She tells me she thinks someone she knows has something to do with it which I am really taken aback by, but then she tells me the police in the US are corrupt and they won't do anything and then says "you can pay off the police do do almost anything".

She got another call and said she got called into work. It was like 11 pm and honestly we live in a big city and I didnt want a girl like her getting hurt so I decided to tail her a block or so behind. She takes the L, gets off then walks to a residential area. She goes to a condominium building and takes out keys and goes inside. Really really weird. I kind of run back home and I am super sketched out. Then again, maybe her friend needed help and she just didnt know what to do or say to me. Maybe she is cheating on me. Why did she have keys?

The next night (tonight) she told me her computer broke and she really had to send out some emails. I asked if she could use her phone and she got angry at me and then went on and on about formatting. So I gave her the computer (that I also do work on) and she went into the bedroom and closed teh door. I tried to come in but she started yelling about distracting her. She came out and she told me she had to fly to NYC. That night. Two hours notice. I was extremely suspicious. She offered to buy me a ticket but it kind of seemed like one of those things where you offer to pay for dinner but don't want to.

I looked at my computer search history and no gmail. Weird. She left but forgot a set of keys I had never seen before on the counter. I decided to go back to the condo I saw that night as I had taken down the address in my phone. I went and it was 6 floors and I had no clue which floor she was on. I figured out which condo it was through a lot of trial and error and a lot of "sorry wrong apartment I'm pretty tipsy".

Its gorgeous. Marble fireplace, marble counter top. Everything is pristine. I don't know what came over me, I just started looking through her shit. Everything just looked like a rich persons house. Nice glasses, nice silverware etc. Then I find a shoe box on the top shelf of a closet and in it theres a sticky note that says my name, my social security and even some of my co workers names and what I am assuming is their socials and birthdays etc under that there are 2 different American passports with different hair colors and different names. There also looked to be a red passport and a green one along with some IDs. Some stating she was as young as 16. I felt sick to my stomach, tried my best to put everything back to the way it was and got the fuck out.

My girlfriend still isnt home. Its 10pm. She left at 4pm. I am not sure what to do. I have not let on that I know but I did try to call her to "check in". I don't know if I can go to the police or not because of what she said. If I go to my boss I will likely lose my job. It could be that she just has those IDs as protection in case anything ever happens. I have heard some very wealthy families do that. It could be she is just living with me because she really likes me, and is keeping the other condo as an "in case" thing. Then what about the sticky notes? Maybe someone running background checks on us just to be safe?

Hey everyone. Naissance here.

I’ve been having the same dream every night since the interview with Mrs. Stevens. All of them end the same. I sink into that bloody pit for what feels like hours, *The Place* pulsating around me like a heartbeat. I can’t feel my limbs, or body. I just allow myself to descend further and further, into a red-hued shadowy abyss— waiting to reach the bottom, where I’ll be abducted again by the hands of an unseen crimson horror born of blood. When my feet touch the bulbous flesh at the bottom of the chasm, I speak. I speak to someone; no, *something*. I don’t understand what I’m saying. Then, I’m pulled. Deeper. Deeper still. It hurts, it hurts so much. I’m scared.

The fear lingers when I’m pulled through. A seamless transition into reality. I look around, pinch myself. I’m home again. In bed. I can’t shake the feeling of *The Place* invading; blurring the line between dream and reality, so it may push me to the same insanity that it pushed Clara Stevens to. 

I know better, though. I do. The visions are just that, *visions*. They aren’t real.

That being said, whenever I get near the tapes, I get this horrible feeling. It was always there, but it’s getting worse. And they keep *changing*. The recordings shift, much like *The Place* itself. It makes me uneasy, and writing the transcripts is a bit difficult because of this. It’s part of the reason this one took so long— I kept having to redo parts of it. It’s all been very tiring. It feels like the tapes want to tell me something. Something important.

Well, anyway. We’ve almost gotten through them all at this point. Three more to go after. We’ll be able to see how it all comes together soon.

**TAPE 1B: ‘RECOVERY’**

DATED: OCTOBER 2ND, 1989

**\[START\]**

\[RADIO CLICKS\]

GAMMA: *This is base Gamma to Excisum, radio check.* 

BRIGGS: Gamma, this is Briggs. Excisum hears you loud and clear. Currently at forward base in the cave mouth of the Strait.

GAMMA: *Just got word from command. They gave the green light. Whether or not Jeffrey Stevens is alive or dead is of no concern. Primary objective will be to recover the recording.* 

BRIGGS: \[PAUSE\] Copy that, Gamma.

GAMMA: *Good luck Excisum.* 

\[RADIO CLICK\]

BRIGGS: Hear that? They don’t care about the guy. It’s a shame. Our objective is going to be recovering the tape.

SLIPPER: Shit. That’s fucked, Briggs. What’s so important about the tape anyways? They tell you?

BRIGGS: No. But it’s probably the same reason that I’ve got a recorder on my belt right now. I’ve got a bad feeling about this place.

VENICE: You doubt the intentions of our employer? 

BRIGGS: It doesn’t matter. We’ve been through worse. 

SLIPPER: I’ll say. We have to deal with your shit every day. \[LAUGHS\]

BRIGGS: Fuck off, Slips. We wouldn’t have had to take this job if you hadn’t fucked up the last one.

VENICE: Go easy on the kid, Briggs. You know he is new to this work.

SLIPPER: New? It’s been three years!

VENICE: That’s new, Slipper. 

SLIPPER: C’mon Venice, I’ve gotten better. 

BRIGGS: Again, if you had, we wouldn’t be here.

\[SIGH\]

SLIPPER: I get it, I get it. But if I didn’t fuck up in Nuevo León, we wouldn’t have gotten this gig. 

BRIGGS: Fair enough. But we’d also be up a hundred grand. 

SLIPPER: That barely matters! We’re making bank with these guys!

BRIGGS: Yeah, but we’ve gotta be careful. We don’t want to cross anyone who can afford to give us so much. 

\[RADIO CLICK\]

GAMMA: *Excisum? Have you entered the passage yet? This is time-sensitive. Your performance will affect your pay.* 

BRIGGS: Heard loud and clear, Gamma. We just reached the lead entrance. We’ll let you know when we find him. 

GAMMA: *One of our associates just talked to the woman, Jeffrey Stevens’ wife. She said that he was rappelling down a cliffside before he disappeared. Once you get the tape, turn back and get out.* 

BRIGGS: Consider it done.

GAMMA: *Good luck.*

\[SHUFFLING\]

BRIGGS: Come on, let’s go. We shouldn’t keep these people waiting. 

\[GRAVEL SHIFTING, LOUD FOOTSTEPS\]

VENICE: Briggs, it’s weird for them to keep so much from us, no?

BRIGGS: Not necessarily. Clearly whoever runs the thing knows what they are doing. It would just lead to more loose ends to tie up. And trust me, we don’t want to be a loose end. And watch what you say— remember, they wanted me to record this job too, just like the cave surveyors.

VENICE: I know that— but this job is different. This is unlike anything we’ve ever done before. Something is amiss. 

BRIGGS: We’re not being paid to worry about it, Venice. 

VENICE: And we’re so heavily armed as well. Why is that? This is just a recovery operat—

BRIGGS: Venice! \[PAUSE\] Stop with the questions. It won’t do us any favors worrying about it. Let’s just get the job done. 

\[PAUSE\]

VENICE: Okay, Colt. 

SLIPPER: God, the ceiling is low as shit! Ah—!

\[RIP, CRASH\]

SLIPPER: Fuck, vest got snagged on that sharp rock on the roof— sorry guys. It’s like a dagger.

BRIGGS: It’s alright, Slips. Get up. Let’s move slower. We’re not used to this kind of terrain. 

VENICE: That would be wise. 

\[SLOW FOOTSTEPS\]

SLIPPER: Wufgh— What the fuck? What’s that smell? 

\[GAGGING\]

VENICE: I… I don’t know.

BRIGGS: Jesus, it’s strong— that’s the smell of rot, that’s for sure. Something died up ahead. 

\[COUGHING\]

SLIPPER: It couldn’t be… Stevens, could it?

BRIGGS: No, no. Fresh bodies smell different. This is decomposition.

\[ZIPPING\] 

VENICE: Here, put this under your nose. Should help with the smell.

SLIPPER: Thanks, Venice.

BRIGGS: Glad you’re always prepared.

VENICE: I do my best. 

\[PAUSE\]

SLIPPER: Hey guys, look here. There’s blood on the walls. 

BRIGGS: What? 

\[PAUSE\]

VENICE: Lord. There’s so much. 

SLIPPER: A load of bloody handprints— could it be Stevens?

BRIGGS: I hope not. An accident couldn’t have caused this much blood loss. Let’s stay on our toes. 

VENICE: Agre—

\[STATIC\]

WOMAN’S VOICE: F—n— — N—s—. —me f—d m—. 

\[STATIC\]

\[PAUSE\]

SLIPPER: \[UNINTELLIGIBLE\] could it? I don’t think it all came from him.

BRIGGS: Maybe. You’d be surprised. We’ve seen plenty of bodies before. They bleed a lot. 

VENICE: But still, this— Briggs; you have to see something is awry here. 

BRIGGS: I’m focusing on our job. 

VENICE: Still— 

\[GRAVEL SHIFTS, CRASHES\]

BRIGGS: Ah fuck!

\[UNINTELLIGIBLE YELLING\]

\[SLIDING\]

BRIGGS: Shit!

\[SPLASH\]

\[LONG PAUSE\]

BRIGGS: Fuck. Where am I? Venice! Slips! It’s dark…

\[PAUSE\]

BRIGGS: Shit.

\[RADIO CLICK\]

BRIGGS: Gamma, come in.

\[STATIC\]

BRIGGS: Slips, Venice. Are you there?

SLIPPER: *Yeah Briggs, I’m here. That was quite the fall, huh? This place*— *there’s definitely something going on here. We need to leave.* 

BRIGGS: Is Venice with you?

SLIPPER: *No. I don’t see him. Where are you?*

\[PAUSE\]

\[FLASHLIGHT CLICKS\]

\[GAGGING\]

BRIGGS: Jesus— It’s like a giant pool— no; lake of blood. I’m waist-deep in it right now.

SLIPPER: *What? That’s where I am right now, Briggs. Do you see me?*

\[PAUSE\]

BRIGGS: No, I don’t. But this place is huge. Is there a way out?

SLIPPER: *I’ve been looking, traveling along the wall. It’s shallow near the edge. Don’t try to go towards the middle of the pit. I’ve just got a bad feeling about it. I think it might be deeper.* 

BRIGGS: Deeper?

SLIPPER: *Yeah. Just trust me on this one. Listen; facing the wall, I’m heading right. If you head left, we should meet.* 

BRIGGS: Okay, Slips. I’ll start heading your way.

SLIPPER: *One more thing, Briggs. I*— *I think I saw something earlier. In the blood. Just*— *try to be quiet. And careful.*

BRIGGS: Noted. I’ll be careful. I’ll see you, Slips. 

SLIPPER: *See you.*

\[RADIO CLICKS\]

\[GUN COCKS\]

BRIGGS: Just in case.

\[SLOSHING\]

\[HEAVY BREATHING\]

BRIGGS: The air is… thick.

\[SLOSHING…\]

BRIGGS: Huh?

BRIGGS: Looks like I found land. And a way forward.

\[ECHOING FOOTSTEPS\]

BRIGGS: Writing on the walls…  In blood— ‘Hinc est’. What the fuck is this place…

\[RADIO CLICKS\]

BRIGGS: Slipper, are you there? I found a way out. 

\[STATIC\]

BRIGGS: Slips?

SLIPPER: Hey, captain. 

BRIGGS: Fuck! Don’t do that, Slipper. I could’ve blown your dumbass head off. 

SLIPPER: Sorry, sorry. Look, Briggs. This place is bad news. We need to find Venice and leave.

\[PAUSE\]

SLIPPER: I found some… bodies, by the wall just now. One of them— he looked young. Maybe in his 20’s. And an older gentleman. They were ripped to shreds, Briggs. Something’s down here. Something bad. I get a bad feeling about this pit, captain. We need to go anywhere but here, and fast. And look—

\[ZIPPING\]

SLIPPER: I found a couple of tapes.

BRIGGS: A couple?

SLIPPER: There were a lot of corpses, Briggs. Most were so fucked I couldn’t tell any of their features. But, one had a cassette on them. Must be Stevens. The other was just floating nearby. So we can get the fuck out of here after we get Venice, get paid, and fuck off into early retirement. Yeah?

BRIGGS: I like that idea, kid. Let’s go. There’s a passage here, Venice might be further inside.

SLIPPER: Alright. 

\[ECHOING FOOTSTEPS\]

BRIGGS: Venice was right. We should’ve been weary of these guys. We should’ve never taken this job. Fuck!

SLIPPER: We’re here, now. I’m not gonna fuck up another job. We’ll get through it. We can handle some weird blood cave. We’ve been through much worse, after all.

BRIGGS: Yeah, you’re right. Aft—

\[THUD, DRAG, HISS\]

BRIGGS: FUCK!

SLIPPER: Briggs! Shit!

\[SLIPPER’S VOICE TRAILS OFF\]

BRIGGS: Fuck! Fuck! What is this!

BRIGGS: No, no! Fuck!

\[SCREECHING\]

\[SPLASH\]

SLIPPER: Fuck, Briggs. Are you alright?

\[HEAVY BREATHING\]

BRIGGS: Slips, thank you. What was that?

SLIPPER: It… looked like hands. Bloody hands. It must have followed us— look. It’s a trail of blood, leading back to that pit. 

BRIGGS: Fuck. 

\[LOUD THUMPING\]

SLIPPER: Shit! What now?

\[THUMPING CONTINUES\]

BRIGGS: It’s all around us; it’s like the cave itsel—

BRIGGS: What?

SLIPPER: Captain! Please, over here. It hurts. It hurts so much.

BRIGGS: Slips! \[PAUSE\] Christ. What the fuck…

SLIPPER: \[GRUNTS\] Please, Colt, can you pull us out?

VENICE: Cap… tain? 

BRIGGS: Slips, Venice. God, what happened?

SLIPPER: You were gone for so long— I couldn’t find you. I found Venice, stuck halfway through the floor; then—  oh god, it hurts. Captain. Please… Venice has it bad. He can barely talk. I put my things down, tried to pull him out, but then—

BRIGGS: It’ll be alright, son. I— I’ll cut you out, just hold on. 

\[SQUISHING, SQUELCHING\]

\[SLASHING\]

SLIPPER: \[PAINED SCREAMS\]  No! No! Stop!

BRIGGS: Slips, you… It looks like you’re fused to this thing—

SLIPPER: Are we gonna die, Colt?

BRIGGS: No Slips, no. I’m gonna cut you out. You and Venice. It’s gonna hurt. I’m so sorry. You gotta bear it. 

\[SLASHING, CUTTING\]

\[AGONIZED SCREAMS, YELLING\]

BRIGGS: Slips, god… Your body— it’s not—

SLIPPER: Colt, you have to go. 

BRIGGS: I’m cutting you out dammit! Don’t say that!

\[LOUD CLICKING\]

MAN 1: Wake him up.

\[SPLASHING\]

BRIGGS: Where… Am I?

MAN 1: How did you get here? What went wrong? Where is the rest of Excisum?

BRIGGS: I… I don’t know. I don’t know. I was in that horrible place and— god, Slips. Venice. They’re still there.

MAN 1: You had four tapes on you, including yours? Where did the others come from?

BRIGGS: What? From that fucking place! You’re the ones who sent us to retrieve it! We didn’t know there would be more!

MAN 2: What happened down there?

BRIGGS: There was blood— and this monster; it made this clicking sound. That cave. It was alive. It was fucking alive. It was made of this tissue. It took the rest of my team— God, they were becoming a *part* of that place. If only I could’ve—

\[PAUSE\]

BRIGGS: You fucking assholes! You knew! You knew what was down there! And you sent us to die! Why? Fuck you! I’ll fucking kill yo—

\[GUNSHOT\]

\[THUD\]

MAN 1: It’s worse than we thought. We have to seal them. All of them. It’s too dangerous; we’ve never seen anyone come back from that place. It’s a miracle that this guy managed. And now we know for sure that these ‘gates’ connect to each other. It’s a terrible discovery. It means that whatever’s in there might be able to come out too. 

\[SIGH\]

MAN 2: What should we do with the tapes?

MAN 1: We’ll let the guys upstairs decide— but if you ask me, we should throw them back into that abyss. Anything touched by that place is bad news. We can’t keep throwing money at this. The organization is done for. 

MAN 2: So that’s it then? We’re shutting it down?

MAN 1: We’ve learned enough about this place to know we should’ve never been there to begin with. We should focus our resources on cleaning this mess up.

MAN 2: I’ll let command know. What a shitshow.

**\[END\]**

___

After finishing this one, I had a realization as to why I couldn’t find the entrance to *The Place* in those maintenance tunnels under the university. There was no entrance. The university— it must have been built on top of the entrance, sealing it. There was a gateway here, in Hillview, under the university. One in the Rockies, in Idaho. One in Maine. Who knows how many there are; and for what purpose. To lure in victims? It certainly was doing that, but that didn’t feel like the right answer. What lies at the bottom of that impossibly deep crimson gorge?

This organization— it most likely discovered these gates. It wanted to learn more about them, but understandably, most expeditions would meet a horrifying end. That’s why it hired third parties to do its dirty work. I wondered if they were still around; after all, the man in the tape said that they were “done for” after Excisum got wiped out. I decided to poke around a bit more. 

It was easy enough to find the old site plans for the university. I was, after all, the head archivist. All the old blueprints were right at my fingertips. From those, I found the construction company that built the university. I&M Construction. They were still around. Bringing the site blueprints with me, I set off. 

It took some asking around their office, but eventually, I was told to talk to a ‘Gus’, who, apparently, worked as the site lead. They gave me a number. He sounded like he was at least eighty years old. Gus gave me an address and time to meet him the next day. 

I arrived at an old cafe. Who I was met with was not ‘Gus’, but instead a rather authoritarian-looking man dressed in a black suit.

“Hello, you must be Naissance Moris. Have a seat.” The mysterious man sat opposite of me. I had a feeling he wasn’t asking. I obliged.

“Who are you? You aren’t the man I talked to on the phone.” I started to panic. Has this organization caught wind of my snooping around? What would become of me?

“I’m sitting in for him. He notified me after you called. My name isn’t really important, as this should be short.” He lit a cigarette, and blew a white cloud to his side.

“I used to work for an organization that dealt with this thing you're investigating. And let me tell you, It’s very dangerous. You should start by telling me what you know.” He stared straight at me, as if anticipating a quick response.

“I… uh.” This was all moving very fast. I felt as if I gave the wrong answer, there would be dire consequences. I didn’t have time to think.

“I only know as much as the tapes—” Shit. I didn’t mean to slip up and say that.

His calm expression turned grim.

“Tapes?” He spoke loudly, with surprise.

“This… isn’t good. Where did you get them?” He spoke quickly, and with concern. This realization changed his outwardly calm and composed demeanor into one of unease and agitation. 

“T—They were in the archives of the university. I work as an archivist.” My voice quivered. I don’t know why I was revealing so much.

“You have to destroy them. However you can. I can help, believe me. You need to get as far away from those tapes as possible.” He cursed under his breath. Could this be a ruse to get me to give up the tapes? Or could this man be genuine? I couldn’t tell— everything I had heard or gathered about this organization had been antagonistic thus far. 

“I—I can’t. I’m almost done with them; I can get rid of them after.” I retorted. I had a strong aversion to the idea of destroying the tapes right now. I don’t know where this feeling came from, but I know I wanted to finish all the transcriptions before I decided on what to do with them. 

“No, you don’t understand. This is an urgent matter. You are in *immediate* danger by possessing those tapes.” His gaze never broke mine. He looked as serious as can be.

“You need to get rid of them. Right now.” Again, he wasn’t asking. “Go and get them. Meet me back here in an hour. I’ll take you somewhere we can deal with them.” 

So many thoughts were clashing in my head. I couldn’t tell whether or not this man was telling the truth or not. The interview with Clara Stevens came to mind, what *The Place* had done to her. How it had changed her. I think of my visions, how severe and consistent they have become. How I felt a pull towards that place, as I inched *closer* and *closer* to the truth. I had every reason to believe him. And yet…

“O-okay. I’ll be here. It shouldn’t take long.” I said back to him. 

He nodded, looking me straight in the eyes. “You can trust me. Anything touched by that place is no good. It’s only a matter of time…” He trailed off. “I’ll be waiting. Be quick.” 

“I will.” I got up, gathered my things, and left. 

I abandoned him there, waiting. I went home; where I had been keeping the tapes. I finally realized what Clara had been looking for in Ukiah. Why she kept adventuring out, exploring. All those maps— she was looking for another way in.

It didn’t take much to convince myself. I packed the tapes, some supplies, my laptop, clothes, and some other belongings. 

Tonight, I’ll take my car and drive south to California.

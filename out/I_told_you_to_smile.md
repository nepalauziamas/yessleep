"Serial killer fails!". This was the title of the newspaper. The article says that a young boy survived an assassination attempt. "I woke up at night because I had a bad dream. I looked in my room, and at the window was a weird man smiling most horrifyingly. He opened my window and said:" Smile! " I kept staring at him, but he said with a deeper and louder voice: "SMILE!". I tried to make my dad come into my room by screaming, but the man entered my room through the window and took out a long and sharp knife. I could see his face very clear: he had a black face, his smile was horrifying and he had small, white and cold eyes. "I told you to smile...",  he said trying to stab me but he implanted the knife in my shoulder. At that moment, my dad came into my room with a shotgun. He fired at the mysterious man, but he missed. The Assasin got scared and ran through the window. The neighbours called the police because I saw police cars parking in a hurry with the Syrens turned on."

"Come on Mark! We just moved here! It's a nice neighbourhood and most of the reach people live in here...", said Mark's mom. Mark answered right after:" You wanted to move in here because here is a very good school ". Mark was very angry. He had to move to another neighbourhood because all his friends were far away. Their house was big, but not fully enough to cover Mark's sadness. 
The next day he went to school. He went to the bus station and accidentally pushed a kid, making him say:" Hey ! What's your problem??!!". The boy looks at Mark and says: " Oh... We have a new guest. Let's introduce ourselves. I am Eddy, and the other two kids behind me are Sven and Ralph. Ralph was a big guy with a lot of muscles and Sven was a boy just like Mark, but skinny."If you want to take the bus, you have to pay me a tax of 5 dollars. Or else...", Sayed Eddy by showing a knife in one of his pockets. Ralph came and hold Mark by his arms and can take out the 5 dollars that Mark had. After that, Ralph gave the money to Eddy. Mark's fury was boiling. " Give my money back or you will see...", said Mark. "Ok. You want to solve the problem the hard way." Mark didn't wait anymore. He punched Eddy's nose and took the knife. He stabbed Eddy in the arm. Ralph approached Mark, but Mark stabbed Ralph's heart three times. Sven took Mark's knife and threw it far away. But Mark doesn't need a knife. He punched Sven in the Stomach. He goes down and starts to throw up everywhere. A little boy called Luke picked up the knife. Right after that, a police officer came and saw Luke with the knife and the two dead bodies.  He took Luke to a police station and left the kids alone. 
After Mark got home, his mom and her boyfriend asked how was his day, and he answered: "It was great!".
Two days later, Mark's mom was about to leave the house for work when he saw two police officers, with Luke and his parents next to him. It was 7 am, so Mark was already up. "Mark! Those officers say that you attacked three kids! They say that the kids were STABBED!" Mark tried to say to his mom that it was true. " Mom, it is all true but they tried to stab me first and stole my money!" Then an officer said quite mad: "We have witnesses that saw everything! Two kids were STABBED and the other has  severe bruises on his stomach!" Mark could say that he didn't attack first, but there wasn't any proof that showed that they attacked first...Mark couldn't defend himself, so he gave up. "Sir...It was me. Luke tried to stop me, but he couldn't do anything." said Mark. The police officers looked at Luke's face. "WAIT!", said Luke pulling out the knife. The police officers took out the guns and pointed them at Luke's head. Mark still tried to make the officers believe that it was him: " N-no...it was me! I did it! ". Mark had tiers on his face. The cops changed their minds. "We will put Luke on trial...Sorry...". Mark's mother put a hand on Mark's shoulder: "Mark...you don't have to lie! We know it's Luke... You can stop!". Mark's parents are shocked about what happened. In Mark's heart, there isn't anything else but sadness and guilt. Two days passed. One morning, Mark's mom entered Mark's room with a lovely smile, saying: " Rise and shine! It's the day!". Still tired, Mark asked: "What is today?". His mom answered quickly that it was Harry's birthday.
Harry was one of Mark's classmates. He didn't say what happened 4 days ago. Mark picked a random shirt and a pair of black jeans and goes down the stairs. In the living room were Mark's, all dressed up and ready to go. His dad was wearing a costume. "Why would he wear such fancy clothes?". This was the first thought that was running in Mark's mind after seeing his dad wearing a costume." "Is that all you are going to wear?" asked his dad. "Better than wearing too much.", Mark replayed.
When they arrived at the party. Michaela, Harry's mother said that Mark should go meet the other kids." The other kids are in the garden." Mark's parents joined the other parents at one big table. They were all laughing. Mark had no choice. He went into the garden and some kids were talking and laughing. They turned around and smiled:" Come on here!". Mark talked for a while with them but shortly after, a kid jumped over the house's fence. One of the kids asked: "Is your name, Mark?". Mark didn't answer, so the other kid asked again: " Is your name MARK??!!!". "Y-yes!", he replied.
"Well, I am Sven's brother, and you SENT him to the hospital! We have some unfinished business!" Sven's brother rushes over to Mark. He punched him in the mouth, and Mark holds his neck. Mark pushes his attacker off him. It was all a disaster. Kids were screaming and parents were running out of the house. Sven's brother takes out a small knife and stabs, again and again, Mark's shoulder. Mark started kicking the attacker in the face. Sven's brother gets up and tries to catch Mark. Mark goes through the back door of the house, but he falls. Sven's brother picks Mark up and throws him into the hallway. Sven's brother kept kicking Mark as Mark tried to stand up. "Come on Mark! Fight me!". He picks Mark and throws him into the living room. He picks a glass from a table a breaks it on the boy's head." "Is that all you've got?!", he asked. Mark stands up. He has been shamed. Something inside Mark snapped. The best thing he could do was to kill. He grabbed his opponent and pushes him to the ground. He punched him in the neck so hard that he wasn't breathing anymore. Mark rushes on him and kicks and punches him again and again. He took his opponent and hits his head on the table. After every hit, the table gets a bigger bloody spot. After he finished with Sven's brother, he realises that everyone in the room was looking at them horrified. Mark was taken to a hospital for dementia. He was tied by his bed. Mark saw everything dark so he wanted to leave the bed"I am afraid that you cannot leave the bed right now...", said his mom. His face and shoulder were covered by bandages. His family came to the hospital and visited him. His bandages were removed daily. After 7 days, the doctor decided to take off the bandages when Mark's parents came. When the doctors finished ripping off the bandages, Mark's parents were disgusted and horrified: "H-honey? Look in the mirror...", said Mark's mom.
His mom showed what her son looked like in a tiny mirror that was in her pocket, and Mark was amazed. He started giggling and laughing. "Honey...it's not that bad...", said Mark's mom. "Are you kidding? I look amazing! My new face describes me in the interior. Under the bandages was a black face, small and white eyes and black hair.
" Doctor! Is he ok? I mean... mentally.", asked Mark's mom.
"Well, it is ok to act like that, but we will check if he suffered from dementia daily. If we observe that he suffers from dementia, we will give him pills.", said the doctor.
The next day, when the doctors came into the room, Mark was gone. Right after the doctors entered the room, a drop of saliva just fell from above. The doctors looked up and so did Mark with his scary face. "Call me Smiley", said Mark smiling. No one knows what happened to the bodies, because they weren't found. Smiley continued to kill people and break into their houses in the middle of the night, forcing them to smile.
If you see Smiley at your window, just scream and try to leave the house if you are alone. Call the cops and hide. If you make noise, he will find you.

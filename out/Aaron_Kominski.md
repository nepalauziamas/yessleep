:not sure if this belongs here or not but whatever

        As I walked down the streets of the white chapel district the rain fell softly on my hat.” ‘tap’ ‘tap’ tap’ “ with the methodical music of the rain I almost danced as I walked. I've had a good day other than at work “only the regulars again ?” I thought to myself as I continued walking slowly getting drenched. I turned the corner on my heel and continued walking when I heard a voice from behind me.

  “ Hey you need something to pass the time?” as I turned to decline I was horrified at its face flickering from human to some sort of monster.

 I grabbed my barber's blade and told it to back off.

 “oh don't be coy she said“

 I closed my eyes and threw my arm towards her feeling something splatter on my face. I slash again and again and didn't stop till my arms felt numb. as I opened my eyes I realized what I had done she wasn't a monster I was just seeing things again. Although shaken I felt exhilarated as I ran away I wondered how long until I would get caught if I would get caught my mind was moving at a million miles an hour. and as I arrived home the thrill had run out and the realization kicked in. I began furiously washing the blood off and fell asleep while cleaning my bathroom the next morning upon seeing my name in the paper the thrill came back. I then knew I would kill again.

              Entry #2

        Again I found myself walking home from work on a day just like the one that I killed Mary Ann Nichols Her name burned into my mind from that newspaper. I haven't taken that route home again to avoid suspicion. Now as I was walking down Hansbury street all I could think about was that day. As the rain tapped on my hat in the same way as that night with the same eerie silence I almost thought I was having dejavu when I heard someone behind me .

“Hey, do you need someone to pass the time with?”

        My mind raced as I turned

        “ in fact, I do “

I said, grabbing her by the throat and pulling out my barber's blade. She had the same flickering face between human and monster but this time I knew it wasn't real regardless I raised my hand not closing my eyes this time. Ignoring her plea’s for mercy as I started to bring my hand down she said.

“Please let me go I'm sorry”

“ too late for that”

I slashed until I couldn't feel my arms much like last time but this time I didn't run home. I walked and when I got home I slowly methodically washed the blood off like a mother washing her baby as I wondered to myself.

“ what will the headlines say this time”

The very next morning my questions were answered .

“Jack the Ripper strikes again”

“ I like that”

I thought to myself as I walked into work like any other day.

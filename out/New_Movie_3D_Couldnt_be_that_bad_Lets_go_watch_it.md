The glasses are off and I'm safe, even though it hurts so bad to type this. Here's some backstory, as well as that, I'll shorten it a bit/make it fast.

Me and my friend, Susan walked into the famous cinema, No Show Theaters, aka the only one in our town. We walk in, get our tickets checked, order our popcorn, candy, and drinks that we always get there, and go sit down in the theater. We were watching this movie that was in 3D that I heard about from one of my friends. My friend said, 

>"It was the best one that ever came out." 

The movie's name was "Teddy Bear." Really innocent? So it seemed. I and Susan were talking until a guy comes up to me and Susan, but gives me one pair of glasses saying, 

>"We are getting the rest but here's one for now."

 I didn't think anything of it at the time, now that I'm thinking of it, it did seem odd. Someone else was passing out the glasses, he never came back in. Fast forward to when the movie started, I put on the glasses and everything went silent. It was dark and incredibly weird. It felt like I wasn't in my seat but I knew I was. The eyes of the bear opened but I was in his perspective. I thought everyone else was too so I didnt think much. Until I moved my arm, the bear's arm moved too. I moved my leg and the rest of my body parts, the bear's movements mocked mine. I just thought it was an interactive movie so I didn't worry that much. 5% of me was still worried though. Everything I did was narrated and then it came to the horror part. Blood, gore, etc. It was starting to be controlled even though it mocked my movements still. The part came where the bear was starting to be hurt. This part wouldn't be important usually except I was feeling it too. I could hear Susan asking me if I'm okay and screaming at something. I felt a touch on my shoulder so I'm sure she felt blood or an injury. I heard another person screaming for help and started to feel like I was being carried. I started to feel more pain and the pain I already had worsened. I heard sirens and people talking. The narrator of the story was starting to cackle and laugh it hurt my ears. They were saying things like, 

>"You'll never survive."  
>  
>"Give up already."  
>  
>"Life was stolen away from you so easily."  
>  
>"Should have never taken those glasses."

I regretted ever going to this movie, I regretted putting on those glasses, and I regretted being alive right then and there. I wanted those glasses off. I was on the ground. In a teddy bear's body. I was in pain and probably had many injuries. The teddy bear's eyes closed and mine opened. I looked around and saw many people rushing to help me and I was being transported to the surgery room. I didn't get a chance to look at my body before the pain got to me. I finally woke up today and remember most of the things that happened. Susan told me her perspective, how I was bleeding so much, the wounds looked horrible, etc. I felt personally horrible for dear Susan, that must have traumatized her. I still feel most of the pain but cannot bare to look at the rest of my body. It's been 3 hours since I've been awake and I feel like if I don't share this now I never will.

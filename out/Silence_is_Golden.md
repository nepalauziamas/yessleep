Hey everyone, I’m here to share an old story. I’ve been meaning to get it off my chest for some time, but it’s hard to talk about. I can’t go into much detail because I think it knows when you talk about it and I don’t want it to come looking for me again. First some things about me, my name is Ty and I’m 15 years old. I wouldn’t say I’m much of a coward however I wouldn’t consider myself brave, that night proved it.

It was about a month ago, school had just ended, a good friend of mine Mack had invited me to come hang out with him for a couple of days. I packed up my finest ganja since this was the opportunity to finally get zooted without my parents breathing down my neck. They always seem to know when I’ve been smoking and give me these long lectures about how I’m gonna end up in prison from becoming a low life and a thieving addict. They knew they were full of shit and I did too but they still continued their facade and I still smoked like Snoop on Christmas.
Mack and I spent the first two days smoking the Swedish Shiba , playing Warzone, arguing about who the hottest girl in school was this year, and watching funny you tube videos. His parents didn’t care if we smoked and they were planning a trip to see his grandparents and stay the night at their place. It didn’t see them until they came into his room. Mack’s dad complained about the lack of packing Mack had done telling him, you need to get ready to stay at your Memaws. Mack protested saying, “ I thought I wasn’t going since Ty was chilling with us for a couple of days”. They bickered for a bit and honestly I was too stoned to recall it all but somehow I ended up getting an invite too. So I went home to pack and update my parents on what I was getting into.

That afternoon around 2 we set out on a long ass car ride to Mack’s grandparents. His mom, Mrs. Gina was telling us about Mack being a young boy always so excited to see his grandparents. Was talking to his dad about the old farm house her parents had bought just a few months ago. I paid no attention until I heard something that shook me and matt to the core. She said WE HAD A CURFEW AND COULDN’T USE OUR PHONES PAST MIDNIGHT. The absolute horror of that statement should have made me jump out of the car then and there! This however, wasn’t a rule, it was a fucking warning.
We finally arrived around 8pm, and the farm house was absolutely gorgeous. I’m a sucker for old architecture but it was like this house came straight out of the mid 1940s. Mack and his parents spent some time talking with his grandparents who had just set the table for dinner, we slunk off like a couple of weasels while no one was watching, looking for a spot to smoke a blunt before we shoved food by the fist full into our face. Mack was bitching about the curfew and we were already planning on how to get outside to smoke again after everyone went to bed. After an amazing dinner everyone was getting ready for bed. His parents were in their room doing the nightly routine when Mack’s grandmother came to talk to us.

“Now this is important boys, you have to follow some rules for tonight and it’s important you do.”

“Turn your phones off before midnight, there’s a landline for emergencies but I pray we don’t need it”

“Bed time is also at midnight, once you’re in bed stay in bed and try to keep quiet, if you need to use the bathroom keep the lights off and don’t flush, the toilet is too loud at night”

“And lastly don’t come out of the room for any reason, I promise it can wait until morning.”

And with that his spooky ass grandmother smiled and left for bed. His grandfather looked like he'd been waiting to go to sleep since the 80's. He gave us a wave, a grunt, and a very dry "night boys" before he went to bed. 

Mack's parents gave us their good night farewells and headed off to bed, but not before mumbling something about the grandmother's warning she gave them before she had spoken to us.

“Your mom knows i have to keep my phone on for work emergencies right?"  Mack's dad Jim said to his wife.

“I get it but just for this night will you just turn it off, mom doesn't seem herself and i don't want to upset her" Gina said. 

I heard Jim grumble something like, " You know the boys...." before they closed their bedroom door, Mack and I checked out the room we would be staying in for the night, there was only one bed  but what looked like a futon on the wall beside it, the bedroom door led right into the kitchen, perfect for those late night munchies, and a bathroom in our bedroom but had a second door also leading to the kitchen, well not a door, it was actually just sliding panel that didn't close all the way but you couldn't see much from the kitchen, it basically hid everything.
While everyone was done for the night at around 10:30 we stayed up watching some youtube videos waiting for the right time to make our "night walk" for some maximized smokeage. There was even a chalkboard on the far wall next to the bathroom door we would vandalize before erasing it and doin it again. The last of our stony haze was wearing off and I noticed the alarm clock on the night stand beside the bed read 11:55.

“Hey Mack," I said," I'm thinking about turning in for the night man, your grandmother has 'catch you smoking and giving 3 hour lecture vibes' I kinda don't want to deal with it."

Mack protested,"don't be such a bitch dude, we have to finish the last two Scott sterling videos on youtube any ways" 

At that time we both exclaimed "SCOTT STERLING, THE MAN, THE MYTH, THE LegEND!" While Mack was writing it on the board trying to figure out how to make the word legend fit on the bottom in bold writing, he's my friend but not the brightest. After turning off my phone and laying down with the lights out we did chat for a bit before dozing off quietly into a limbo type slumber not quite asleep but i wasn't fully awake either.

At some point in the night I was awoken by Mack getting out of bed, loudly, kinda grumbling to himself about not being able to see shit in the dark when he needs to use the bathroom. I thought, great he's gonna wake everyone up with one of his world famous power shits. That's the last peaceful thought I've had in a while.

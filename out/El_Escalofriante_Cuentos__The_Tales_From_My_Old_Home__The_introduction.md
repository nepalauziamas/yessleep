" Which is the true nightmare,

the horrific dream

that you have in your sleep or

the dissatisfied reality

that awaits you when you awake? "

I haven't thought of writing about my old home until I got an anonymous email from someone who claimed to be the landlord of my old home,

I know about the things that have gone in that house when you were there and I really can't think of any rational explanation for the events that transpired.

I sincerely request you Mr. \[Redacted\] not as your previous landlord but as your friend to please heed my advice.

I have been skeptical of paranormal stuff forever and even remain for many years but through my experiences, I have come to question my judgment. So I made this account to capture all the experiences I had with the unknown and maybe uncover the truth behind all this.

And here I start ......

It all started when in 2016, I moved into an apartment with my parents. The apartment was not that old probably built in the late 90s and was right near the middle of the city. The house had 2 bedrooms, a living room, a kitchen, a bathroom, and a long passageway connecting the living room to all other rooms.

Everything seemed fine when we moved into the house. The wall was painted again, and the carpet and tiles were refurbished. But soon certain incidents started occurring. The most common things like my pencil, eraser, etc which were hard to keep an eye on were suddenly disappearing and reappearing in the place I had just searched thoroughly. Now, this can be just me being stupid but this started happening more often than normal. From occurring once a week to 3-4 times a week. Again this could be a mere trick, my brain played on me as oftentimes we just can't see things in plain sight.

This kept happening to me for like 2 months until it started affecting my family too. My father was ready to leave for work and he couldn't find his car key. We searched the whole house but couldn't find the car key. He called a taxi and left. Later in the afternoon, when my mom was cleaning my wardrobe, she found the key just poking out of the ironed clothes. When I returned home from school, I was scolded pretty harshly as my parents thought I pranked them. I didn't prank them but they just won't listen.

But the good part was that the 'weird' activity stopped for a while. FYI I never thought of anything that happened until then was connected to the paranormal. But my scariest ever time was during my summer holidays. I and my school friends went to see lights out, it was kind of terrifying to me as I was not into the horror genre. I returned home after good old big macs. The night was scary, felt long as I couldn't sleep. Had to switch my yellow lamp on the whole time because no 'light's out' pls.

Eventually, I slept, but something out of ordinary happened. I had a dream, a nightmare. I had dreams for most of my childhood but Couldn't recall any of them after I woke up. But this was different, it was a nightmare that I had once a year or so. As far as I remember it was a dream of my dad dyi-- after falling from a ski lift high up in the sky. The thought of losing my dad was enough to make me cry even after I woke up. Again I rationally thought of it as something my stupid brain cooked up and decided to be positive throughout the day.

But things got stranger as days passed on. Instead of things disappearing and reappearing in the same place they seem to be found somewhere impossible. For instance, my expensive Casio G-Shock watch disappeared from my study table and was found shallowly buried inside one of the small home plants we had. I asked my dad and mom about this and they said that they didn't know anything about it and yelled at me to stop pranking them. That was the point when I decided that I had enough of it and started to investigate the unusual activity taking place in my house.

Whoever was doing this had messed up with the wrong person. My teenager self was furious because my precious watch had gotten quite dirty. So first I decided to clean my poor watch before beginning my thorough investigation. I went to the bathroom and decided to properly wash it with water. The soil particles from the watch face and the handle were removed, and only the backplate was left. So I turned on the tap water and used my fingers to scrape off any dirt on the back plate. But weirdly the dirt kept on coming off as if it never ended. When I stopped scrapping my finger against the metal plate. And turned my eye towards it. I found that the dirt was still stuck to it. I lost my mind at this moment and what happened after was one of the reasons I got interested in the dark and mysterious.

Until next time folks, I will be back with the major incidents that took place in my old house hereafter, the tales from

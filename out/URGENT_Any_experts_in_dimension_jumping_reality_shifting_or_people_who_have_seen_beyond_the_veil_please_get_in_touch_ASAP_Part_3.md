Hello.

I’m getting a lot of DMs with questions about my should-be-dead neighbor, Ellen. Some of you are convinced she might be my way out, if I can find out more clues from her. I guess the time has come to put all my cards on the table. I didn’t want to say anything much about her, and it will become abundantly clear why in a few moments. It will also become clear why I’m bothering to tell you guys in the first place. 

Before I get into this: I know some of you will judge me harshly for what I’m about to describe. But I’m not a bad guy—I’m just a guy, who did a bad thing. Make of that what you will, but I hope you’ll still help me regardless of what you may think of me after this. I’ve tried, and I’ll keep trying, to make up for what I’ve done.

Ellen, Penny, and I all used to be close. We grew up playing together—at first it was running around the grassy fields behind Ellen’s house and playing ghost in the graveyard, and as we got older it was stealing some beers out of our parents’ fridge and getting drunk in the mountains, or spending time listening to music together in one of our rooms. 

Penny has quite a lot of friends. She’s always been the brighter, more extroverted of us two. I think it happens quite commonly with twins, that one is more “dominant” than the other. That’s definitely her; most people don’t even realize we’re twins at first since we’re fraternal. We look like siblings, but our personalities are different enough to the point that most people don’t connect the dots until Penny makes it blatant. I mostly keep to myself at school and probably wouldn’t have anyone except for Penny in my life, if she didn’t insist on including me in almost everything she does. That included her time with Ellen. Really, the two were best friends and I was Penny’s semi-reluctant tagalong. 

Things started to change between the three of us about a year ago, when Ellen had already graduated and Penny and I were seniors in high school. I was in a couple of honors classes that kept me busier than I used to be; Penny’s schedule was a little more open. Second semester, she had a study hall last period that she apparently started skipping quite often. I found out because about half the time, she would run late to our lockers after the last bell—cheeks flushed, eyes dilated. I could tell something was off the first time, and Penny knew it. But she didn’t talk about it, and I didn’t ask.

Ellen started spending less and less time with us. She was working a few shifts at the gas station close to the school and taking a couple of classes at the community college, and as a result she never seemed to be home or have time to reply in the group chat. I accepted this easily; deep inside, there was even some small sense of relief. 

When I did see Ellen, the air felt different between us. There would be less eye contact, less conversation. She’d cut our time short. But she and Penny seemed more connected than ever—they’d laugh over apparent inside jokes, and Penny would playfully shove her. The first time this happened, I saw both of them glance over at me. Penny’s gaze was apologetic; Ellen’s was cold. 

It didn’t take long to put the pieces together. I decided I had to confirm my suspicions before confronting Penny with anything. So I skipped my last two periods and posted up in the bathroom closest to Penny’s study hall, listening quietly to the sounds in the adjacent hallway. I know it was creepy of me, but it paid off. At the start of seventh period I heard Ellen’s telltale laugh, hushed enough that it didn’t create an echo, and then soft whispering. I almost emerged from the bathroom, but held myself back for a few seconds before cautiously peering around the doorway. I could see them, walking together with light, quick footsteps. They headed towards the glass double doors at the end of the hall, which led outside. The hallway was empty aside from the two of them, everyone besides us three probably busy in their last class period. They pushed open the double doors, slipping out quickly and breaking into a light run together, into the parking lot. I ran after them; I’m not sure why. By now I had plenty of evidence to confirm my suspicions so I didn’t need to keep going.

But something compelled me. I’m not sure what; my mind was quiet, preoccupied with the task of not losing sight of them. I kept my footsteps light as I ran out the door behind them, seeing them climbing into Ellen’s truck together. I kept myself partially hidden by crouching by the dumpster. They drove off together, windows rolled down. 

I quietly got into my and Penny’s car and sat for a few moments. It was too late to simply tail them; it had taken a long minute to reach my car, and they were already out of view. I slowly pulled up my phone. Penny and I have an app that keeps track of our locations; we’d installed it after a close call a few years back. Penny had tripped and broken her ankle while solo hiking, and managed to call me up crying. It took me a long while to find the place where she had slipped off the path, and it really shook us both up. Hence the app. It had been my idea; Penny was a lot more prone to going off on adventures by herself on a whim, so this was a practical compromise that gave her her freedom and spontaneity, and me my peace of mind. 

I watched Penny’s icon as it traveled along the streets of the city, and then the highway. They took an exit that led to the mountains. I kept watching, until the icon held still. They must have parked. I shifted in my seat; I had been staring down at my phone for over thirty minutes. I looked from my school to the exit of the lot, uneasy. I knew I was about to cross a line. But I pushed my hesitation away and quietly turned the key in the ignition.

I didn’t turn on music for the drive. I barely thought anything during it. I arrived at a trailhead, and saw Ellen’s car parked there. It was the only one. I drove past it, pulling off a little ways further down the dirt road. I don’t know why I bothered, but concealing my presence was just my instinct in the moment. I grabbed my black hoodie out of the backseat and pulled it on, letting the hood conceal my face partially. Black wouldn’t be great camouflage in the daylight, but having the hood up helped me feel secure. 

I walked back to the trailhead and quietly started walking, hands shoved in my pockets and ears burning. I was listening intently for any sound, ready to duck into the leafy foliage flanking me on either side if I heard either of them. After another twenty minutes, I heard them and slowed down to a stop. I glanced at my phone. Penny’s icon was still resting around the parking lot; either she’d left her phone in the car (unlikely) or our phone plan didn’t have service out here.

After listening for a minute to their distant voices, still as a rabbit, I started walking again, even more slowly. I paused when I heard Penny scream and broke into a run, halting myself just before the edge of a clearing. There was a stream cutting through the trail here, which flowed over a cliff to create a small waterfall cascading below into a deep pool. Penny and Ellen were standing in the stream, the water flowing quite fast over their ankles. Penny’s scream had come from Ellen playfully splashing her. 

I stayed back, watching.

“Ellen!” Penny screamed again, half a laugh. She pulled her wet shirt away from her stomach, shivering. “Come on, we really should be getting back. Rich—“

“Screw Rich! You worry about him too much. He’s been fine all the other times you skipped.” Ellen’s voice held a trace of gloating, and she held onto a luxurious pause. “Besides… you really wanna go back to school all wet?” 

I cringed from my hiding place.

Penny smacked Ellen on the arm, cheeks burning. “El! C’mon, let’s go back.” She stepped out of the water, shaking her feet dry one at a time and crouching to put her socks back on. 

Ellen groaned. “Pennnyyyy. I want to swim. It’s so hot today. And you’re almost done with final projects already, right? Rich has your guys’s car, he’s totally fine. C’mon, please!” She stepped out of the river, pulling Penny towards her with her hands weaving themselves together behind Penny’s neck. Their faces met, the angle censoring my view. I looked away, feeling a bit nauseous and regretting this whole endeavor. I tentatively started to creep backwards, intending to leave and try to forget this whole thing. The back of my neck was burning, the same place Ellen had touched Penny. It didn’t feel great to know I was being cut out. It wouldn’t have stung so much if Penny hadn’t kept it a secret. The fact that she felt compelled to do so told me everything I needed to know—this secret would be damaging, and Penny was trying to protect me from it.

I paused when Penny pushed Ellen away after several seconds and resumed putting on her shoes. “I’m going back.” Ellen let out a melodramatic sigh, stooping to the ground and handing Penny her keys. 

“Go on, then. Go pick up Rich, if he’s even still at school.” The line made my heart stop. How could she know? A moment later the knot in my stomach loosened a bit—she was referring to how much time had passed. I glanced at my phone; school would have ended several minutes ago, and Penny was a short hike and a 30 minute drive away from school. Ellen stretched her arms over head, arching her back a bit and raising her head to the sun. My face twisted a bit. She was showing herself off. “I for one, am going to enjoy my day off. Pick me up later?”

Penny hesitated. I could see her looking over the small cliff side, past the waterfall and into the pool. She was mightily tempted. I let out a sigh of relief as she bent once more, silently finishing with her shoes. I had won out over Ellen. The relief was short-lived as Penny started towards me. I quickly crouched and rolled frantically off the path a good distance—footsteps would be too obvious. I imagine Penny and Ellen both heard, as I heard Penny say a quiet “What the fuck”, and then keep silent. I squeezed my eyes shut, praying I wouldn’t be discovered. 

After what felt like an eternity, I heard Penny move past me along the trail. She must have mistaken the sound of me for an animal. I waited several minutes, until I was sure she’d be long gone, back to Ellen’s car. I lay there, face down in the grass and dirt and foliage. /What now?/ I asked myself silently. I lifted my head and could just make out Ellen’s hair through a small gap in the leaves. She was pulling her shirt up over her head. I hastily looked away again, acid rising in my throat.

I know, I know. This is the part where I lose you, if I haven’t already. The inexcusable part. Call me a monster if you want to. I don’t understand why I did it. But, I did. 

Ellen dove off the waterfall. She must have slipped a bit on the rocks in the stream, because she hit her head going down. The splash she made as she fell into the pool below was shockingly loud. I flinched, sure someone must have heard. Maybe even Penny. I creeped out of my hiding place and went to look. 

The distance from the top of the cliff to the pool below was less than a story, not enough to kill anyone. But as Ellen bobbed to the surface, her hand went slowly to the side of her head. I could see a small cloud of red dispersing in the water around her. She seemed disoriented, and confused. She rubbed awkwardly at her eyes, trying to clear them. I think she must have been too in shock to think, too much to even look up and see me, or try to call out for help. I was frozen like a statue as I watched her bob around in the water, limbs flailing in an uncoordinated way and hand returning again and again to the side of her head. She got a mouthful of water and started to cough viciously and splash about even more, movements growing urgent but still too sluggish to be effective. 

I know I could have gone down and pulled her out. I had the presence of mind in the moment to understand the choice in front of me. I didn’t move.

It took a long time before she finally stopped moving, her back calmly rising to the surface. Her hair fanned out around her head in the water like a crown. She gently bobbed up and down with the water as if she had become part of it. I watched for what felt like ages before I finally pulled out my phone and uninstalled my location app. 

I slowly started walking back along the trail, my legs feeling like lead. I’m in good shape, but I was exhausted. I didn’t even think until later what would happen if I encountered someone on the trail, but fortunately I didn’t. I got back in my car and drove myself somewhere neutral, the grocery store close to our house. It was approaching five o’ clock by now. With a start, I realized Penny must be missing me. Fuck, would she be going back—My phone rang, cutting off my panicked thoughts. 

I hesitated, and then picked up the phone. I knew without looking that it would be her. 

“Rich?”

“Hey.” My voice sounded remarkably normal, even as I could see how pale I was in the rear view mirror. 

“Did you leave school early?” She was puzzled, but not suspicious. I focused on untensing my muscles. 

“Mm. Yeah. I’m sorry about taking the car, I thought you’d be staying after for your club. I should have texted you. I was just feeling a little off but I’m okay now.” I switched her to speakerphone, and glanced through my messages. Oddly enough, Penny hadn’t texted me or tried to call before this. I added an excuse in quickly. “I decided to get some groceries, do you want me to grab anything?” The lie rolled off my tongue easily.

Penny was silent on the other end of the line. I knew she could tell something wasn’t right, but just as I let her secret meetings with Ellen slide, she was letting this one slide.

I stayed with Penny all day when I came home; she didn’t leave to try and pick up Ellen. She had simply parked Ellen’s car in the driveway next door. Over the next couple months that followed, Ellen’s disappearance made the local news frequently. There was a lot of attention on it at first, but it gradually waned. A funeral was eventually held, which wasn’t well attended. By now, the sensationalism had died down and the people who actually cared about Ellen ended up being few in number. I felt numb the whole time as Penny sobbed through the service beside me. Beyond that brief moment where she showed her grief, Penny was surprisingly calm throughout the months-long aftermath, particularly given her history of obsession over true crime. But she didn’t touch this case at all; she would avoid news and articles about it. We never once discussed Ellen or reminisced about our friendship with her, but Penny’s obsession with the occult seemed to grow even more intense. She buried herself into her hobby with a renewed passion, and I knew exactly why. Penny was hoping to find a way to bring Ellen back.

That’s where I’ll leave it for now. Remembering all of this is draining, to say the least. This is the first time I’ve really let myself delve back into what happened with Ellen. In a way, it feels really good to finally get off my chest.

This is the safest place to do so; in this dimension, I’m not a murderer. Or else Ellen wouldn’t be walking around next door, mere feet away from me as I type. So I know I can’t be charged here even if I have confessed: no dead girl, no body, no crime committed. Still, if you decide that I’m not worth saving, I’ll understand. But if I can’t get back home, someone else will pay the price. Keep that in mind if you’re debating about weighing in, please. 

I’ll be in touch soon.

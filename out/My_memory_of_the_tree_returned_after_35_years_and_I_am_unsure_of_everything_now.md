In 1987 I was a whopping 10 years old. At the time I felt so grown up. My family life was happy and secure, both parents alive and my mother at home with me at all times. I am the youngest of four with 11 years in between myself and the nearest sibling.

My oldest sibling was just really hitting his stride in his career and had bought me the ultimate in tech and entertainment, an NES. I spent hours playing games so much so that my parents started to insist I spend more time outside. I was upset at first but there was a new boy that I had seen around the neighborhood that must have moved in recently so I thought maybe it would be fun after all and I could make a new friend. His name was Tommy, Tommy Mains.

Up until my visit to the shrink last week I would have said it was a very boring summer, but I didn't remember much after meeting the new kid. He was different than me, I spent a lot of time outside but nothing like Tommy.

Now that I have laid the foundation of what I am about to tell you. Let me come back to the present. I was having issues recently at work and in my home life due to anxiety clouding my mind. The fear of plans changing or surprise visits always gave me pause but it wasn't until the doc pressed me on when it started that I began to remember some things, more details you know? He asked me to describe the tree, and I did he also asked that I try my best to recall anything or anyone out of the ordinary that summer. Of course my mind drifted to Tommy.

I hadn't thought about him in years. In fact, when was the last time I saw him? Turns out it was 1987. It should have all seemed off at the time but as a kid i thought nothing bizarre about it. Tommy didn't live on our street, he was just a kid I played with outside and in the woods with the other kids. I hadn't been to his house, I had never seen him actually sleep or go home--he was always last fall asleep when we camped out. I recalled that my parents never mentioned him, my friends didn't either and it was though something had taken him from all of our minds. Whenever I tried to picture him all I could see was that dang tree. But not today, for some reason when the doctor asked I was able to picture him very clearly.

I remembered how he looked, talked and even what he wore. He walked around on the concrete, grass or even over stubborn roots without any shoes. In fact, I don't think I had EVER seen him wear shoes but without them he was still faster than me. I remember running around playing baseball with him and the other kids, we would play in the woods and run around until dark. One thing I remembered though from that year was the big tree in the woods. The tree had a massive trunk that looked like it had been stripped from years of kids climbing and pushing off of it to use the vine that you could swing out on over three small creeks. Above the tree was a large canopy that blocked out the sun on most days but would somehow always let moonlight in when we were out late. I had a hard time remembering much more about it though. I did remember that during some development in our area, the tree and that whole wooded area was removed to make room for houses. I knew Tommy had moved out around then as well.  I also started to remember more but our session was over along with an ominous feeling that I was suddenly in very real danger. "Big Surprise" I thought to myself, I mean I was just at the doctor for anxiety.

Later that evening I went out to my backyard to sit on the swing and relax. Something was different about it though. As I looked up the hill some of the tall slender trees had been replaced with a much older tree, with a massive trunk and even from here I could see a vine hanging from it.

"You ready to do this or what? . " I heard from beside me, "I told you I would be back" I swiftly turned my head and was startled to see Tommy, just as he was when I was a child, sitting next to me on the swing.  He stepped off the swing and motioned for me to follow him up the hill. As I stood up to do so, everything changed again. The tree and Tommy vanished and I was right back in my own backyard again.

This had happened the last three nights I'd gone out to that swing and I just chalked it up to the anxiety. Last night though when I started to head out back Tommy was staring at me through the glass. "No hiding from it time champ, we're running out of time." was all he said. I moved out the door, down the stairs and as I did so it seemed to me that I could smell the forest from that summer just as it was then. In fact, I felt as good as I did when I was 10 and full of energy.

Have you ever wondered what it would be like to be a kid again? Turns out for me, it was far more terrifying than imagined.

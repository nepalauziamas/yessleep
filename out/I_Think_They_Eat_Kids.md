  

This is probably the last time I’m gonna tell this story. 

Some stories, you can only tell a certain number of times. Because telling it costs you something. And you don’t get it back. 

I was in my early thirties. Thirty-two? I had been a nudist for almost ten years. Mostly in private, in my apartment. Occasionally I would go to nudist dinners, pool parties, things like that. And specifically as a gay nudist, I’m hangin’ out mostly with nudist men. 

I had heard about the all-male nudist retreat that happens every summer in the mountains north of here. I’d heard about this retreat for years. Online, you see pictures and all sorts of chatter about it. And I’d always wanted to go. It just sounded like absolute Heaven. Right? Like a weekend in the mountains, hanging out, traipsing through the woods, butt-ass naked, like the day you were born, with a bunch of other like-minded, nudist dudes, and just laughing and having fun and, you know, probably messin’ around a little bit in the bushes, but just like, you know, good, wholesome, gay nudist fun. 

 So yeah, I was really excited. And I registered early, so I could get the early rate. And I was so stoked when I got my welcome packet in the mail. There’s all these instructions. Where the address was. Because they don’t tell you right up front. You have to wait until they actually get your money. You know, there’s some people out there who are not so in love with the idea of gay nudists. So they want to make sure those people don’t find out where this is happening. 

Each night there’s gonna be a different party with a different theme. There are workshops during the day. And of course there’s lots of naked hiking and naked swimming and naked canoeing and naked sunbathing, and just lots of naked fun. For all the nudist gay dudes who can afford to go to this thing. Which, this year, includes me.  

Anyway. I count down the days until it’s time. I even take that Friday off work so that I can have more time to travel and I don’t have to get there late at night and I can really enjoy the first day of the experience. 

I drive the five hours north to the retreat. And I stop for gas about an hour out. I’m already in the mountains. It’s kind of the last spot where I’m gonna have good cell coverage. So I just check all my email, my socials, all my sites. And I’m getting all excited; this is about to happen, I’m about to be at this gay nudist retreat. It’s finally real. I get to hang out with a bunch of other weirdos like me for a weekend. And um, so I just quick type in “gay men nudist retreat” in Google, just to see if anything pops up that I haven’t seen yet. You know, if people are talking about it, whatever, right? 

And instead of hitting search, I accidentally hit the images button. And you know what pops up is a bunch of pictures of trees and some butts or something. But there’s one picture—and the picture is pretty innocuous, it’s just a picture of a bunch of dudes without their shirts on—but the caption is: “They Eat Children.” 

And so I click on it. Because it’s the sort of caption one must click on. “They Eat Children.” And it’s a tumblr post. With an image of men, allegedly, at this retreat. And the post just says in all caps, “BEWARE. DO NOT ATTEND THE GAY NUDIST GATHERING. IT IS A SMOKESCREEN FOR AN ANNUAL GATHERING OF CANNIBALS.” Um. “MEN WHO EAT CHILDREN.” And the leader is identified as a man named Bryan Balman. 

And I laugh. Because this is ridiculous. This is silly and insane and what is this? But in the post, the name Bryan Balman is a hyperlink. So I click Bryan Balman’s name!

And the link takes me to a government registry. And usually I’m not interested in that kind of thing. Our whole incarceration system is totally racist and predatory and fucked up. But this particular registry is for people who have committed acts of violence against children. 

There’s no picture. It just says “Bryan Balman.” And then under offenses it says “manslaughter.” Six counts of manslaughter. And six counts of endangerment of a minor. And it says that Bryan Balman was incarcerated from 1981 to 1996. 

And I remember that the welcome packet that I receive in the mail, the introductory letter was signed, “Love, Bryan.” 

I turn off my phone. Then I turn it back on and hit the back button, to the strange tumblr post. And the link is dead! The post is gone. It’s vanished.  

I hit refresh a few times to be sure. Same result each time. Someone has taken it down.

I am four hours from home. I am an hour from this retreat. And the internet is full of crazy, crazy stuff. And I know that there are not…cannibal clubs. 

So I get back in my car. I turn on the radio, I turn it really loud. And I just drive as fast as I can to the retreat center, I am getting out of whatever crazy little thing in the internet I found. And I am going to my nudist retreat and I’m going to have the weekend of my damn life, or at least of the damn year. Right? So I am not going to let some weird, nonsense, internet gossip that vanished immediately ruin this weekend for me. 

I get there. And I park in the dirt lot. It’s your classic summer camp kind of set up. I can see the cabins. I can already see a whole bunch of butts just bobbin’ around; all the naked gay goofballs are here. And I’m super happy and I go to the registration table. Sure enough, there’s a middle-aged naked dude sittin’ there. And he greets me, he gives me this big, warm hug—which, I’m a nudist, it doesn’t freak me out at all— and I check in. 

He asks my name. Then I ask his. And he says, “Well, I’m Bryan.”

And I don’t know why I do this. But I just respond with, “Which Bryan?” 

And Bryan kind of hesitates and he goes, “Well, you know, most people around here call me Big Bryan! It’s just kind of a nickname.” 

I’m like, “Okay. Does Big Bryan have a last name?” 

And Big Bryan kinda smiles and goes, “Yeah, Big Bryan has a last name. Big Bryan’s last name is Balman. B-A-L-M-A-N. Balman.” 

We’re both silent for a sec’. So he breaks it by giving me another big ol’ hug. And he’s like, “Alright buddy. Your bunk’s in the big cabin there. Drop your bags. Drop your trousers. And get to the mess hall. It is almost time for dinner.” 

So I go to my cabin. It’s the “Bare Bears” cabin. I go in. I drop my bags at a bunk. And I pull off my clothes. And I’m alone. Everyone else is outside.

I know that this is not a secret gathering of…whatever. But. This event is run by someone who spent time in prison for manslaughter. A lot of manslaughter. And…endangering children. And that is something I didn’t know. 

It happened a long time ago. People change. I don’t know any of the circumstances of his charges. It was probably a horrible accident. There’s just no reason to keep thinking about this. I’m here to just prance around naked in the woods. And, you know, maybe screw around a little bit, and go to the naked workshops, and go to the naked yoga, and go to the naked talent show tomorrow night. 

And it’s time for naked dinner, dammit! So I strut naked right out of that door—I got shoes on for all of you rookies out there. We wear shoes; we’re not stupid. It’s outdoors. 

I make my big debut! I meet a whole bunch of nudists. Lots of big nudist hugs. We’re all inside the mess hall. And it’s funny, because they put towels down on all the benches because, you know, bare ass. You gotta sit on a towel. 

I sit down and, incidentally the four dudes sitting closest to me are the leadership council of this retreat. Which includes Bryan. We all get to talking. I tell them all that I so appreciate them organizing this retreat. This is so exciting and fun, and unusual. And we’re all kinda getting to know each other and then they ask what I do, I ask what they do, and then I ask Bryan, “Bryan, what do you do when you’re not organizing nudist get-togethers? Surely you can’t pay the bills on this?”

And Bryan says, “Oh no no no, I have a side hustle.” 

And I ask what it is. 

And Bryan responds, “I sell industrial kitchen supplies.”

I ask, “That’s pretty interesting. Do you work out of a store, or…?”

“No, no I run a restaurant equipment website out of my apartment.”

I’m like, “Oh wow. How cool. Do you sell to like major restaurant chains I would have heard of?” 

And he’s like, “No, no, no. It’s for schools. I sell equipment to elementary school cafeterias.”

And my breath kind of catches in my throat. Look, there’s nothing wrong with that. There’s nothing creepy about selling kitchen equipment. It’s just…it’s just weird. 

I’m just feeling this as privately as I can. But Bryan notices. He stares at me. For a little longer than feels normal before he goes back to eating. 

After we get done with our meal, we’re all heading to the main meeting hall for a naked dance party, which will involve a lot of jiggling, and will be absolutely delightful. And as we’re walking that way, Bryan comes up behind me and puts his hand on my shoulder. And he’s like, “Hey buddy, could we talk for a second?” 

I tense up. I say, “Of course, sure.” 

Bryan pulls me over into the dark, to the side of the building, and he’s like, “Look. Um. It seems that you have, um, done a little research on me.” 

And I’m like, “No! No, I haven’t don’t research on you, no. Not at all.” 

And Bryan goes, “No, you have. I know that look. And yes. I am that same Bryan Balman. I served my time and I am…you know, I am living a different life now. And I don’t want you to be uncomfortable around me. Yes, I made a very tragic mistake in my early twenties. That resulted in the death of a group of children who I was, actually, a camp counselor of. Uh…and you know—let me show you somethin’.” 

And he turns around and points to a tattoo on his thigh. It’s a tent. And he says, “This is to commemorate the lives that were lost in that accident at the summer camp. I served nine years. Anyway, I know the look on your face, buddy. And it’s understandable. It’s totally understandable. It’s normal to be frightened when you learn that someone has caused harm to children. I want you to still enjoy this weekend. I don’t want you to be stressed out. And you don’t have to talk to me if that’s weird for you. But I just wanted to clear that up. Please have fun here. And don’t let what happened in my past impact your weekend here.” 

I instantly relax. I’m like, “Bryan I cannot tell you how much I appreciate you saying all that. I did not research you, I am not spying on you, I just stumbled across this link, it was on tumblr. Someone had posted something…I mean it was insane. It was an insane post. It said that…It doesn’t matter.” 

Then Bryan goes, “No, no, what did it say? I wanna hear. I have heard everything under the sun at this point. Nothing’s gonna shock me. What, am I a serial killer, what did it say?” 

And I go, “No, it actually said that this entire retreat was like secretly a cannibal club.” 

Bryan starts laughing. And he laughs so hard. Like he’s gasping and laughing at the same time. Bryan finally stops and says, “Well, I can promise you this is not a, a cannibal club. And I suggest we go in there and dance our dicks off with all these beautiful, adorable, naked gay men!” 

I say, “Sure. Let’s do it.” 

So we go inside. And dance the night away. And I dance. I dance hard. And when the dance party is over, we all go back to our bunks and crash. 

Except for me. I’m wiped out alright. But I can’t fall asleep. So, about two in the morning, I go for a walk. Hoping some fresh air will just mellow me out a little bit. I walk past the other two cabins, all dark inside. I walk past the meeting hall. I walk around the darkened mess hall. And as I turn the corner, I come across this tent. 

It’s a big tent. The kind that’s made for a meeting or something. And there’s a light on inside of it. And I can see through the canvas there are four men still up. Talking. And it’s none of my business, whatever’s going on in there. I don’t want them to see me or think I’m spying on them, so I turn back and go back to my cabin. Thankfully, I fall asleep. 

Saturday morning starts. Get up. We all head to the mess hall. I sit with some new people this time. Really fun guys. We all go play naked volleyball. We go for a naked hike. And it’s just super beautiful out. And as we head out on the hike, we pass the meeting hall. And Bryan’s there, at the registration table. And he kinda waves at me. And I just real quick wave back at him. 

On the hike, I walk with a guy I just met. I ask him if he’s been to this retreat before. He says, “Yeah, I go every year.” 

I tell him it’s my first time. And I ask him how well he knows Bryan. And this guy goes, “Oh, not very well.” 

I say, “Oh, okay. But he’s a really nice guy, right?” 

And the dude I’m talking to says, “Yeah, absolutely, he seems like a nice guy.”

And I’m like, “Yeah…I’m sorry, I don’t mean to be—nothing weird happens here, right?”

And the guy looks at me like what-are-you-talking-about? “No. Nothing weirder than a bunch of naked men.” 

And I laugh and I’m like, “I know, I’m sorry. I just didn’t sleep well last night and…my bad.” 

So yeah, I just go have fun the rest of the day. Just take my mind off of everything. Just do what I’m there for. Just fun. I go for a swim, and I canoe, and the sun starts to set. And they ring the dinner bell. 

And this strange impulse kicks in. 

When all the other naked dudes walk into the mess hall and find their seat at the benches, I walk past all the benches. I don’t even know why I’m doing it, but I walk straight into the kitchen. And I’m not supposed to be back there. But I see a volunteer preparing some more food. It looks like some kind of spaghetti. And I just ask, “Can I see the cans?” 

And he’s like, “What?!” 

“Can I see the cans that this food comes out of, please? I have allergies. I just need to look at the ingredients.” 

He says, “Okay.” He takes me back to the pantry. He shows me all the packaged food, canned sauce. He asks if I want to look in the fridge. I say “No. I’m sorry.” 

He can see that I’m kinda worked up. And he says, “It’s okay,” and he pats me on the butt and sends me back out to have dinner. 

I go sit down next to the guy I hiked next to. And we’re eating spaghetti. And talking. And I look around and see that none of the leaders are in the mess hall. Like they were the night before. 

And I ask my new friend, “Have you seen Bryan? And the other leaders?” 

My friend goes, “Oh no, it’s Saturday night. The leaders have a special leadership dinner on Saturday night. Leaders only.” 

“It’s not in the tent is it?” 

My friend says, “Don’t know. Never been.” And he goes back to eating. 

I look at my food. I look at the front door. I look at my food. 

And I get up. I walk straight out the door. And I turn the corner. 

I keep walking. I walk up to the tent. And I fling open the flaps of canvas. 

And there the four of them are. They are seated at a table. Plates. And knives. And forks. And cups. And they’re laughing. And there are candles on the table. And the candles are encircling some kind of roast. 

They all look up at me. Bryan sits at the head of the table. There’s a moment of quiet. Then Bryan says, “Hey buddy. This is the leadership dinner. Is everything okay?”

And I ask, “Bryan. What are you eating?” 

And Bryan goes, “Buddy. It’s *cochinillo asado*. Roast suckling pig. It’s the leader’s dinner.” 

And I say, “May I have a bone?” 

No one reacts immediately. Bryan repeats back to be, “You want a *bone*?” 

“Yes. May I have a bone? I would like a bone of your…your…”

And another leader says, “Well you can’t have one and you need to leave right now.” Bryan tries to calm him down, but the other leader stands up and demands, “You don’t need to leave just the tent, you need to leave this retreat. Right. Fucking. Now.” 

Bryan puts his hand on the leader’s shoulder and says, “I’ll walk him out.” Bryan gets up. Wipes his mouth. Walks over. Puts his hand on my shoulder. 

And I pull free of Bryan’s grip. I lunge at the table. I grab onto a rib of this roast. Of whatever this thing is. And I tear it off. 

And I run like hell out of that tent. 

I am getting the fuck out of this camp. And I am finding out what the fuck is in my hand. I can hear commotion behind me. I run to the cabin, I grab my car keys and my backpack. I don’t even grab clothes. 

Keys in one hand, rib bone in the other, I run to my car. I get in. I turn the key. I almost floor it. But there he is. About ten feet in front of my car. Bryan. Fully dressed. In clothes, he looks like some embarrassing dad with no sense of style. In his hand, he holds a pistol. 

“Hey buddy,” he says. “I’m gonna need that back.” 

I rev my engine to show him I am not fucking around. He flinches. But he doesn’t move. He raises the pistol. 

“Buddy,” he says. “You’re still young. You don’t have to make enemies.” He waits for me to react, then adds, “It’s just once a year. Let this go.” 

I hit the gas. He pulls the trigger. I feel my right ear tear off of my head. I feel the car jerk over Bryan’s right leg. Both of us scream. 

I drive for an hour until I find a hospital, blood running down my neck. I pull into the ambulance loading zone. Right before I pass out, naked, on the floor of the lobby of the emergency room, I bark at the nurse, “Tell me what this bone is!” 

I saw Bryan one more time. I did have to testify at his hearing. Obviously, the retreat was indefinitely cancelled. The gay nudist community was devastated. After the arrests, they raised over a million dollars in private donations for child abuse prevention. 

The four leaders each got life, several times over. The retreat was thirty years old, so, thirty counts of murder. All of them were offered lighter sentences if they would reveal the true identities of the men listed in their confiscated journals. Each leader kept a book of code names, presumably of other men with similar appetites. Names like “The One in the Red Suit”, “Mouse Man,” “The Janitor.” Each journal had the title, “Supper Club Members.” None of the leaders would budge. 

Like I said. I can only tell this story so many times. I think I’m out now. Because every time I get to the end, a dread settles inside me that’s hard to shake. The code names haven’t been cracked. And the only people who know what the Supper Club men look like are the members themselves. And the kids they eat. 

And one other person. Whoever posted that tumblr post. You knew. You knew before anyone else did. And if you’ve found this story. Find me.

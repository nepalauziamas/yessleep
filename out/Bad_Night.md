Hi, I'm David, I couldn't believe what I saw that night. Let me tell you about that.

I had to work overtime that day, so I got home very late, by the time I got to the door, it was already 12 o'clock at night. I found the key and tried to open the door, when I heard a crash coming from inside the house. I rushed over. But some force forced me to turn around. Behind me, right at the street lamp pole, there was a rather thin man, with a red shirt covering his face, this man's back seemed to be hunched, in his hand he was holding a stone, which What I noticed most was his hand, it was covered with a red thing that looked like blood. He threw the rock up but he missed the shot, now what I said I couldn't believe my eyes arrived.

His fingernails grew strangely long and slowly walked over to where I was standing. I had a bad feeling, so I quickly entered the house and locked the door. I heard banging on the door for a while and then scratching, that annoying sound made me cover my ears, after about 3 minutes passed, everything was silent. I looked through the window, it was empty outside, I fell asleep in the meantime.

The next morning, I woke up and called the police, to my surprise, they believed me. There were some very absurd circumstances but they still believed me, of course I also asked them why they believed me so much. They answered:

“We have heard a lot of people reporting this. They had a similar case, one even witnessed the man kill someone.”

I froze and thought what would happen if I didn't hurry into the house at that moment. A few days later, I moved into the house of a close friend of mine named John. He is quite friendly, I will stay with John on the condition that I pay half of the electricity and water bills. Of course I agree. I also told him about the story that night, John listened and comforted me.

A year has passed, John has helped me with many things for which I am very grateful, I decided to take him out to eat in return.

“Hey John, do you want to have dinner with me tonight?”

"Sure!"

We ate until late at night. John and I don't know how to drink wine or beer so we weren't drunk. I was the driver who drove John home while driving. I have seen it again.

Still the same figure, still the same shirt. The man still had the stone in his hand, and now John saw it too. He threw the rock up but this time he caught it. Suddenly, there was a 'bang' on the roof, and both of us reflexively turned our faces upwards. I looked back to the front, the man had disappeared without notice. I no longer thought about anything, went out to check and immediately drove home.

After that event, John and I lived peacefully. We will never forget that night, it was so creepy. But when we tell it, we always laugh a lot.

My grandfather was an exceptional man. Born in crushing poverty, he took to a life of crime in his teenage years before straightening up and joining the British Indian army, where he served with distinction. After India's independence he won multiple national level gold medals in wrestling and subsequently completed his education and started a successful trucking company. He had lived such an extraordinary life he spent his old age just reliving his memories with friends and family through his great storytelling skills. Us grandkids just loved to sit around him as he regaled us with tales from his well lived life. He always seemed so joyful when he did it too. 

But there was this one story that he avoided telling any of us until he was almost on his deathbed. One story that has stayed with me, even after all these years. I remember it all like it just happened yesterday, how his eyes widened and his bony hands trembled in fear as he recounted the most frightening experience of his life.

Thankfully, I had a tape recorder close at hand and I can tell you what he told me, in his exact words.

Are you sure you want to record this? Because it's not very pleasant... Okay then. Just don't tell your mother what I tell you here. I don't want to be held responsible for any nightmares you might end up having because of this.

So all *this* happened back in 1942, in the midst of the Arakan campaign. The Japanese had pushed all the way into Burmaâ€¦ ugh, I mean Myanmar. The campaign was the first offensive push by the allied army, to push the Japs back. And let me tell you, it was a spectacular failure.

We were not prepared for the attack. Remember, this was back when Indians couldn't rise about the rank of Subedar Major and all command posts were occupied by the British. And they had no idea what the fuck they were doing. They had little to no experience fighting in the muggy jungles, our transport infrastructure - our supply lines - were pathetically weak. Hell, Bengal - that was supposed to be the launch pad for the invasion suffered a devastating famine just a year later. I'm sure you must have read about that in school.

The Japanese on the other hand, were well fortified *and* carried out ambushes on a regular basis. It wasn't surprising to have entire patrol squads get wiped out in the blink of an eye. The attackers would suddenly appear out of the shadows and disappear before help could arrive. It was terrible. We were on edge all the time. Every branch that snapped, every leaf that rustled got our fingers pushing against the trigger of our rifles.

Compounding all that were the harsh conditions. We were far more likely to be killed by disease than war. The food we ate was barely enough to keep us on our feet, the threat of malaria and dysentery always loomed large. Snakes, spiders and other insects larger than anything we'd ever seen crawled on our emaciated bodies as we slept. Sawrms of flies, that looked like dark little clouds descended on the corpses of our brothers. It was hell. We were permanently covered in layers of dirt. Rains lashed the forest at an alarming frequency, turning the weather so humid it felt like our skin was starting to melt. The repeated spells of rain pretty much destroyed our communication lines, and the ground had turned so boggy that some soldiers had gotten stuck in them, right up to their thighs. It was so bad that at times command structure had completely broken down, and disorganised chunks of the army were operating almost independently from each other.

It was in such a situation, that - that nightmare appeared in our lives.

One of the worst aspects of fighting in the jungle was the psychological warfare. The Japs would kidnap our soldiers, torture them for information, brutalise them beyond what should be humanly acceptable and sent them back, barely clinging to life. We could never save them, and I think that was the point. To watch our comrades, our brothers in arms waste away in front of us while our meagre medical supplies could do nothing to help them.

But that wasn't the worst of it. You see, one thing they delighted in doing was using our soldiers as bait to draw the rest of us out. They would torture our soldiers, to the brink of death and tie them up to a tree, usually in a clearing, and hide in the forest. If we went out to help, they would pick us off from the trees. All we could do is just stay hidden and listen to the agony filled death throes of our fellow soldiers. Wait till the last drop of life was slowly squeezed out of them as they cried out for their mothers.

It was one such incident that changed everything. Or at least, an incident that looked deceptively like the nightmare that we had gotten used to. James Wavell, a distant relative of Archibald Wavell, the then commander in chief of the British Indian army (and later Viceroy) was in charge of us. He was the one who sent us out on patrol that day. There were about a dozen of us, cutting our way through the jungle when we heard the screams.

You see, in forests, it's actually quite hard to track down the source of a loud noise like that. If someone screams, it feels like it's coming from everywhere, like the woods are echoing the sound and speaking to you themselves. 

But not this time. 

Instinctively, almost on a primal level, we knew where the screams were coming from. And almost as if in a daze, we gripped our guns tight in our hands and followed, or more likely we were *led* there, if that makes any sense... It didn't take us long to find the man who was screaming. He was dressed in Indian army fatigues, or at least the trousers - his shirt was torn and hanging from his shoulders. He was - god this is hard - he was tied to a tree, and had his hands on his stomach, trying to push down his intestines that were spilling out like thick, bloody little ropes.

And his screams. It's like I can still hear them. Like they're still making my ears ring. The pain in those screams, I could feel it in my bones. I began walking towards him before I even realised what I was doing. I felt a hand on my shoulder and was pulled back forcefully. I looked into the eyes of the man who pulled me back. They were wide open. Alarmed. Like he knew something was seriously wrong here. He shook his head slowly, warning me not to go ahead even as that man continued to scream. I gulped and nodded. 

We spread out into the woods, with our guns drawn, keeping each other in sight, to brace ourselves for the jap ambush. I winced as twigs snapped underneath my boots. I realised I was afraid. Not of the Japanese presumably hiding in the trees somewhere close to us. No. But the wounded man in front of us. It was so bizzare. I can't explain it. But I felt it. Deep in my soul. Every fibre of my being was screaming at me to run away. To keep running until I left this man far behind me.

I took up position slightly to the man's left and began waiting. Waiting for him to die, and for it, whatever *it* was to end. But it didn't. The man screamed, he cried, he sobbed, he called for help, but he just didn't seem to die. Minutes turned into hours and the sun began dipping beneath the horizon but he kept on screaming. We stood rooted to out spots, unable to move, as if mesmerized by the strange performance. The moon climbed up into the sky and the man's blood began gleaming under the white light that beamed down on him. But he still didn't die. 

My legs were aching, my neck was stiff and I could hear someone to my right crying softly in terror. It was like we knew. Knew that it was not that man, but we who were about to die. And then it happened.

The man stopped crying.

Then the world was plunged into silence. 

And I do mean complete silence. We couldn't hear anything. Anything. No birds, no crickets, no leaves rustling in the wind. We couldn't even hear ourself breathing. It was like the forest itself was holding its breath.

And then the man got up. He easily tore off the rope holding him in place and jumped up on his feet. His intestines hung limply from his belly, which looked like someone had punched a hole through it. Fuck. Half his gut was gone. Just straight gone. I could see straight through it. No man can live through an injury like that. Let alone be completely fine like he seemed to be.

You see how scared I am right now? Do you see how my hands are trembling even after all these years, just by thinking about that night? So you can imagine just how terrified I was when that man glared at me. His eyes shot up to mine, like he knew where I was. Like he'd always known where I was. There was such malice in his eyes I almost passed out from the fear. And then he screeched. It was loud and shrill. Like thousands of babies screaming into our ears. I remember quaking in my boots just looking at that hateful snarl on his face.

He began running towards me. With these big, loping strides, covering half the distance within seconds. Thankfully, that sudden burst of motion had restored my senses and I started running away from him. I dropped my gun, my backpack, and just bolted. I leapt over small rocks and overgrown roots, ducked under branches, waded through thickets, stumbled in the dark, but kept on running. My boots at one point got stuck in the soggy mud, but I pulled myself free and pumped my legs to keep running. I stole a glance over my shoulder and saw him gaining on me, intestines slapping against his thigh as he ran. He was smiling. Ear to ear. Like the chase was the best thing to have ever happened to him. Like he wanted to take his time and truly savor the hunt. *Move. Move. Move. Must go faster,* I thought.

I heard screams behind me, accompanied by loud tearing and squelching sounds. He was ripping the patrol squad apart. One by one. And soon it was going to be my turn.

My lungs were on fire, each breath a desperate act of survival. My legs were starting to wobble. I knew I would not kast long. I couldn't outrun him. But I could hide. I - I found this small crevice, where this giant tree had been uprooted, tucked away in a dark corner of the woods. I scrambled for the tiny hole and cloaked myself in the shadows. I wasn't even thinking about snakes or some other venomous creature waiting for me in the dark. I just wanted to get the fuck away from that thing. I pulled my knees close to my chest, felt my heart hammering against my sternum and waited. Waited for that thing to find me and put an end to it all. 

I heard his footsteps. Slow. Deliberate. Felt the leaves shift and crunch underneath his bare feet. Then he began whistling. It was oddly melodious, like a bird singing an ode to the forest. I heard the fallen tree creak as he stepped on it and glided towards me. Dark drops of blood came crashing down on the ground inches from my feet.

He called for me. In my mother's voice. She had been dead for over 5 years by that point. Gently, with love, he called for me. And laughed when I didn't move. I put my hands on my helmet, pulled it down in front of my eyes and began crying as silently as I could. It was over. I knew I was going to die.

But for some odd reason, he didn't kill me. Maybe it's because he wanted to leave one survivor alive, to go out and talk about him, spread the terror he had inflicted on our patrol squad. I don't know. I don't even know when he left. I spent the whole night there, alone, shivering in that little hole. Even when the sun had come up and bathed the forest floor with light, I still refused to come out, such was the extent of my fear. It wasn't until another patrol came across me that I felt safe enough to come out. They had to carry me back on a stretcher. I was delirious with fear, and every muscle in my body was exhausted. But I was alive...

That was the closest I came to that thing. But that wasn't my only encounter with it. All throughout my stay there I heard stories about it. From my own regiment and others, hell, even the Japs had supposedly run across it. This immortal thing that imitated voices, pretended to be wounded and tore apart entire squads at a time. Or how he came to you at night, when you were sleeping, whispering utter hatred into your ears before dragging you away and slicing you to pieces. Some patrol squads discovered remains of corpses in odd places, like decapitated heads on top of trees or limbs splayed out in strange patterns near the base camp. At one point we feared we were losing more men to that thing than to the Japanese. I'm sure they felt the same. 

All the horrors that I witnessed in that country - the air bombings, the disease, the burnt corpses - were all nothing compared to that night. I remember how relieved I felt when we marched into Rangoon. Even with all the guns and artillery going off around me, all I could think of was that I was glad I was out of that damned forest.

Anyone can relate to staying up late at night, and hearing some creepy sounds that usually aren't anything to worry about, right? The wind may blow a certain way, a branch may snap, creaks in the hall could sound like footsteps, etc. Maybe you have a strong fear of things like spiders or snakes like I do, and irrationally worry about them and if they are near or not. I imagine we have all experienced stuff like this at one time or another.

At the end of the day, these aren't things to concern yourself with. It's like worrying about the devil, it's an exercise in futility.

You know what isn't as relatable? A fart coming from your closet at night. If you haven't guessed it by now, that's where the story I'm about to tell begins.

Now let me clear a few things up. I'm on the 6th floor of my apartment complex, and I don't live with a partner or roommates. My room is on the far side of the building.

I was laying in bed when I heard a loud fart come from my closet. My closet is small. You feel cramped in it, and I hate that feeling of being enclosed in tight spaces. It's mostly empty except for some clothes. Nothing in there could've made that sound. Nothing in there is hidden. It had to be a fart. A rancid smell followed, and my theory had been confirmed.

It definitely gave off that sulfur smell, you know, like rotten eggs. It was pungent, as if I had been blasted in the face with it. I began to feel portions of my last meal work itself back up my throat.

I was barely able to keep myself from gagging when I heard something else. It sounded like movement on the other side of my closet door. Were those...footsteps?

I began to panic. I know my closet. Nothing in there could be making those sounds but I knew what I heard. Someone was in there.

Questions immediately flooded my brain. Who was in there? Why were they there? Were they armed? Was I danger? Without thinking, I spoke up.

"Hello?"

The movements ceased. All was now silent. I felt a shiver down my spine as my fear had been confirmed. Someone was in there, and they didn't want me to know.

A few more moments passed in complete silence. Too quiet for my liking. I slid out of bed and grabbed my lamp. I called out again.

"Hello?" I asked, trying to keep the trembling in my voice to a minimum.

I started counting the seconds as they went by waiting for a response.

*One. Two. Three. Four. Five. Six.*

"What do you mean hello? You're in *my* closet!" came a deep voice.

Not exactly what I expected to hear.

"What do you mean I'm in *your* closet? You're in *mine*!" I shouted back. He was trying to lure me in. I guess it was his last resort. He'd been caught. I gripped my lamp tight.

"Listen man, I know you're trying to trick me. You come out of there right now! I'm about to call the police. And don't you dare try anything funny weirdo. I'm going to send you to your own personal hell!" he responded, his voice noticeably uneven.

"Dude, what are you talking about? I was just lying in bed minding my own business until that nasty ass fart nearly made me puke!" I said. *Who the hell did this guy think he was?* He snuck into my house, hid in my closet, and I'm the weird one?

"If you weren't in my closet then you wouldn't have had to deal with it!"

"But I'm not in *your* closet! You're in *mine*!" I said, stunned. I can't believe this guy.

"Listen," I said. "On the count of three I want you to come out of there."

"Why? So you can kill me? On the count of three you come out of there!" He replied.

*This fucking guy.*

My fear was fading. Now I was getting angry. I inched closer to the door, ready to strike.

"Okay fine, on the count of three, I'll open the closet door.

One.

Two.

Three," and with that I flung the door open, quickly retreating.

I looked through the door. There he was. But not in my closet. We stared at each other. Both in disbelief at what we were seeing. I was looking into his room. He was looking into mine. There was no closet.

*What the hell?*

"What's going on?" I asked. Gazing at his room I noticed his clock said 6:00. It was 10:00 pm here. Were we in different time zones?

"Dude, I have no idea," he responded.

"I'm going to come to you, okay?" I said.

"Sure thing."

I took a deep breath and stepped forward.

I was immediately surrounded by darkness. Neither of the rooms were visible anymore. I reached into my pocket for my phone. In doing so my arm bumped against something solid.

My movements were hindered. I finagled my arm into my pocket and pulled out my phone. By contorting my body I was able to turn on the flashlight feature.

I turned my wrist side to side to illuminate my surroundings. Light shown on some old looking wood. There was a symbol in front of me. I'd never seen the design before. An upside down triangle with what looks like a handlebar mustache, an X through the triangle, and then a V below it, all connected. 

I tilted my phone up. Spider webs glistened in its light. They hung from a wood ceiling only about a foot above my head.

I immediately felt uneasy. My senses began to tingle. That's when I heard a noise beneath me. There was something rubbing against my foot. No, it was...slithering. The sound was a...hiss.

If I'd had any room to I would have jumped but I couldn't. Instead I ceased all movements. I was trapped. Little droplets had formed on my forehead. I could feel my clothes starting to stick to me. I needed help.

My phone had service and shockingly I was able to get in touch with authorities. They said they'd trace my phone and get to me as soon as they could. I just had to wait patiently. By virtue of having service, I have been able to connect to the internet.

Every time I heard a hiss I'd flinch. I could feel massive spiders descend onto me. They crawled up and down my body as I tried to remain still. The snake had wrapped itself around my leg, and in response I had started to whimper.

The snake was continuing up my leg. My range of motion was getting more restricted. It felt like I was being tied still by more and more webbing. My phone lit up. I hit the green button with my thumb.

"Hey, so we tracked your phone, and you're not in the U.S. son. We can't help you in Turkey."

"I'm not in Turkey!" I screamed back. Or at least I thought I had. The words didn't come out. I tried with all my might to respond but nothing would come out. Eventually they hung up. My knuckles turned white as I clenched my fists and shook my body. My eyes watered. It was hopeless.

I'm not able to do much. Spiders have begun covering more and more of my body. I think the walls have gotten closer together too. I'm feeling nauseous. It's getting harder and harder to breath. If I take too big a gasp of air I fear a spider is going to crawl right down my throat.

I can't move my legs at all. It's like they're tied in place. The snake has moved even higher up my leg. It's head is visible in the light from my phone now. I think it's a boa.

I don't know what to do. I'm stuck, and no one is coming to save me. I think I'm going to die in here.

All I can think about now is the moment before I stepped into my own personal hell. I had been looking right at that man through the open door. The instant I had stepped from my room to his...he had smiled.

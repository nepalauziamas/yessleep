When I was 8 I used to sleep with my mom. I had always been scared of the darkness, but nothing would calm me more then my mother. So my family had moved to another country in Scandinavia, and we lived in a small refugee reception center in the Northern Part of the country. It had one room, which barely had room for me, my mother and my sister. We had a very small old soviet television, and a very small kitchen and living room. My father had not yet gotten an asylum, and so he could not stay with us.

So as I was saying, I've always been scared of the dark and I wouldn't have ever dared to sleep alone.  
The bedroom all three of us slept in had one master bed which me and my mom slept in, and a bunk bed behind the door which my sister slept in. There were no windows in this room, and a closet right in front of the master bed. 

One day whilst playing, a sudden and terrible feeling hit me. I was incredibly scared, and for no reason. It was as if I instinctively knew that something terrible was going to happen to me. But it was just a feeling, and I had company so I forgot about it a few hours later.

Later that night getting ready for bed that same feeling hit me. This time since I lived in Northern Scandinavia and it was winter it was pitch black, and I was terrified. I got in to bed with my mom and got close to her. I was shaking and just cuddled my mom, and then I fell asleep.   


Late at night I suddenly woke up... to a strange... rustling sound. I turned around and saw that it was 02:18AM. I wanted to go back to sleep, I was tired and had played all day with my few friends. But then as I was about to turn around again to face my mother I saw it. A tall figure around 195cm (6.4 ft) was standing right in front of me. I assumed it was a man, and this man was unreasonably skinny. He was darker then night, and had glowing white eyes which I could clearly see. He was staring straight at me, and for every minute he was getting slowly closer. He got so close that he finally touched the end of the bed. I could feel the movement, this confirmed that I was not just imagining it. I franticly tried waking my mother, but it felt like she was completely gone. She didn't even answer me, and just turned the other way.

This man got closer, until his face was right in front of mine. I'll never in my lifetime forget that face.  


Pitch black skin, and a wide grin with terrifying white teeth. He had slits for eyes, and there was something inside where the eyes were supposed to be that was glowing. His hands were facing the wrong way, he was balancing his entire weight with his wrists. His hand was pointed at the ceiling, and it looked like a painful position. His feet faced the wrong way, and it also looked very painful.  


I fainted from fear, and awoke the next day. Never again did I see that thing...  
12 Years have passed, and I forgot most of what happened that night. I'm not scared of the dark anymore and life is going pretty well. I have a girlfriend and live in a medium sized apartment with her and my dog. My family moved to Southern Scandinavia, and when I turned 22 I moved to Oslo.  


Today I am 25, and my girlfriend is 24 and almost a month ago she asked me if I had ever encountered a ghost. I obviously answered no, but then I remember what happened 12 years ago and I began to sweat. I told my girlfriend that I HAD Encountered a ghost, and I told her the entire story. Later when we were going to bed that same feeling from 12 years ago hit me. Being older and "braver" now I shrugged it off. I got in to bed with my girlfriend, and again I woke up in the middle of the night. Next to me was a small table where I had my digital clock. I was fully awake and I saw that the time was 02:15AM. I was incredibly thirsty and so I went to the kitchen to drink some water and then head back to bed.  


I went to the kitchen and opened the fridge, no drink I really liked. I grabbed a big glass and filled it with water and ice. I really needed that water. I went to put my glass back in to the drawer but in the reflection of the sink I could see a familiar face... the same face I saw 12 years ago standing right next to me. Seeing him again I could clearly tell this man was well over 200cm (6.5 ft) I myself was no short man, I was 188cm (6.1 ft) but this man, no... this creature was making me look like a dwarf.   


I ran out of the building and got to the hallway. I could see him standing almost out of the door. Half of him was inside of my apartment, and the other half in the hallway. He raised his hand and put it over his mouth, then he... started laughing. His words haunted me.  


" Are you abandoning your girlfriend? What a terrible boyfriend you are LEVAN "  


This thing knew my name... I was to scared to go help my girlfriend. I ran out of the apartment, and called the cops. They arrived shortly after and discovered my girlfriend... she was alive thankfully but ever since that day, at night she would act strange.

My girlfriend never used to talk in her sleep but now she says always says "Are you abandoning your girlfriend? What a terrible boyfriend you are LEVAN" it gives me chills. It reminds me of that thing.  


Today I woke up at 02:15 again and got a glass of water. Everything went exactly like last time, but instead of that creature being there it was my girlfriend. I got back in to bed and my girlfriend followed me, currently I'm writing this whilst my girlfriend is standing right in front of me. Her eyes are glowing and she's darker then the night. It truly scares me to my core, but I want to share my story.  
I've decided to break up with my girlfriend because she has started to act strange at day to. I always catch her staring at me whilst standing perfectly still at turns and corners of the apartment.   


Oh shit she has a knife, HOLY SHIT SHE... SH- THATS NOT MY GIRLFRIEND!

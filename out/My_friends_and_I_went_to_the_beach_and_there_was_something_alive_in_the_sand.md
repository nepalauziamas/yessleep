I immediately let out a sigh of relief as soon as I stepped out of the car. It had felt like an eternity that we had been stuck in that car but it had only been 3 hours. We had all been so excited to travel to this secluded beach initially but the novelty of it had worn off over the long car journey.

My best friend Mark, who has always been a big ball of energy, was already unloading the stuff out of the car. He never lets anything phase him and was singing some random tune to himself.

The others were hopping out of the car and began stretching to regain feeling in their limbs, that had been trapped in the cramped car for the last few hours. 

I felt a hand tap me on my shoulder and I glanced over to see my girlfriend Chloe smiling up at me. She indicated that I should go and help Mark so I rolled my eyes at her and made my way over to help. We all agreed to leave our phones behind so that we could enjoy each other's company.

We quickly got the car unloaded and divided up everything between us. It was a long trek to the beach and we had to cross over multiple sand dunes before we finally spotted the ocean.

I stood there for a few moments gazing out at the clear blue ocean as it just looked so calm and perfect. Mark suddenly dropped everything he was carrying and began sprinting to the ocean. We all quickly followed and soon we were all splashing each other and having the time of our lives.

We eventually got tired and made our way back to set up the chairs and coolers. The girls in the group immediately lay down to get a tan while the guys began throwing a football around. We were drinking away as the plan was to camp here for the night and head back home tomorrow.

Mark was the first one to notice the footsteps on the sand. I had been throwing the ball for Mark and he ran to catch it. He turned around to discover another set of footprints which appeared to be following him. He thought it was one of us messing with him and started to walk away. We told him to stop as the footprints continued after him.

I made my way closer to the footprints to get a better look. They were almost twice the size of my feet and had what appeared to be long nails jutting out of the front. Mark took a few more steps forward and we realised that whatever it was took two steps for each step that Mark took.

We were all a little bit drunk at this time and dared Mark to let the footprints catch up with him. He was never the type to back down from a challenge and began moving forward at a quick jog. He had a big goofy grin covering his face.

Mark froze on the spot when the footprints finally caught up with him. He turned to face me and opened his mouth and let out an ear piercing scream. None of us had time to react before something began dragging his body beneath the sand. Within moments all that was left of him was his watch which had fallen off his wrist. 

I began to slowly move forward to the spot where he had disappeared. I had just reached the spot when a fountain of blood sprayed upwards and instantly soaked me. The girls began screaming and everyone began rushing around like headless chickens. 

Someone threw me a towel and I used it to try to clean off some of the blood that was covering me. The towel was quickly saturated in blood and I had to toss it to one side. 

Chloe ran over to me to see if I was okay. She saw the dread on my face and followed my finger which was pointing at the footprints which were now following her. She gave me a pleading look as I began to back away from her. 

I began circling her and moved towards where the footprints had stopped. I waved my hand above them but there was nothing there. The others had grouped together a short distance away and were watching us waiting to see what would happen. 

Chloe must have panicked because she started running towards me. I was then forced to watch as her body was almost bent in half and then dragged beneath the sand. Her eyes were locked on mine even as her head disappeared beneath the sand. 

The beach was utterly silent as no one moved in fear of the footprints following them. The spray of blood from Chloe's body was the only noise that broke the silence over the next few minutes. 

I don't know who started running first but it started a chain reaction. Everyone began running in the direction of the car across the sand dunes. None of us were paying attention and didn't stop until we heard the pleading scream. 

We turned as one to see Emily being dragged downwards. I rushed towards her and grabbed onto her arm. I desperately tried to help and pulled with all my strength. I heard a sound of a bone snapping and fell backwards onto the sound. I pushed myself upwards to discover I was clutching the end of Emily's bloodsoaked arm. I threw it to the ground in disgust and began vomiting.

I looked around to discover that I was alone as the others had abandoned me. I heard screams in the distance as whatever it was that was living in the sand caught up with them.

I pushed myself to my feet and began moving forward. I gazed back after a few steps and my heart sank as I saw the familiar footprints which were now following me. 

I sat down on the ground and tried to come up with a plan of escape while keeping a careful eye on the sand. The car was maybe a quarter mile away and I couldn't reach it before the footprints caught up with me.

I began crawling along the sand and felt ecstatic when I looked back to see that the footprints were not moving. I should be able to reach the car in less than an hour and then I can get help.

The sand under me was very coarse and it didn't take long for it to cut into my skin. My stomach was in agony as the sand tore open my flesh and caused it to bleed. I was still covered in Mark's blood and the sun was boiling the blood on top of my body.

Every movement was torture but I knew that I had no choice. I finally spotted the car in the distance and redoubled my efforts to reach it. When I was only a short distance away I jumped up and began sprinting towards it.

I jumped into the car and peered out to see the footprints just outside the door. I let out a triumphant cheer as I had escaped and was going to survive. My celebration was short lived as I discovered that the keys were missing. I finally remembered that Mark was carrying them and they are probably buried beneath the sand with him.

I tried all of the phones and most of them were dead. The only one working had almost no signal so I couldn't contact anyone. My body is covered in cuts and I know I won't survive much longer. 

Please stay off the sand and if you see footprints following you then it is already too late for you.

[\[Part 1\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/ue9mde/the_creaking_man_part_1/)

 

I was going to drive home to my family. But my wounds needed urgent care, and it’s not like I would want to worry my husband, let alone my own daughter. I called him up and let him know that I will be visiting the hospital. He decided it was appropriate to take her out for some ice cream since she missed me. I felt a morbid sense of curiosity thinking about him. 

The man who chased me out. I want to go back even though my family situation is solved, but this is just so damn interesting. I made it into the parking lot while unbelievably sore and tired. The once clean bandages turned to brownish red scraggly messes. I walked into the emergency room and was taken to a hospital bed as soon as possible. I waited by sitting on the bed and watching some youtube videos. Jacksepticeye is my favorite, his video’s usually cheer me up when I feel bad.

An episode later the doctor finally walked in. The doctor went around me and his jaw dropped. He spoke worriedly “Now how did you go and do all that? You need to be a bit more careful Mrs.Williams.” I laughed, and told him that I work as a construction worker. There was just an accident on site and I got slightly injured. I was sure I was fine. “Well, we will see about that.” 

He slowly but carefully took off my bandages and it stung. “Did you put on these bandages yourself?” I told him that I watched tutorials online, and got the hang of it pretty quickly. “Pretty impressive Mrs.Williams” he said in a reserved but excited tone. “A very useful skill indeed… Oh that’s interesting.” “You have multiple open wounds on the back, thighs, and arms. 

I’ll get a wipe to get you cleaned up Mrs.Williams.” He then spent the next 10 minutes wiping my thighs, arms, back, and barely on my mid section. Since I was running it was more on my sides and back rather than anything in the front. But the exploding glass shards definitely grazed my stomach and chest for sure.

“There is no bacterial infection, however we should clean out the wound just in case.”

I looked at my phone as he went all around my body, the stinging pain pissing me off slightly with every dab and wipe. “Unfortunately you will need to get stitches for the wounds on your thighs, arms, and back. I would also highly recommend that you stay overnight, you shouldn’t be excessively moving around in your condition. 

There could be glass shards further in your body we must consider. I will prepare the document for the surgery, and you should definitely look over it and let me know if you have any questions or concerns.”

I was worried, because since I was a little girl I have always had a fear of stitches. I don’t want something in me like that, the thought nauseated me, but it was for my own good. I read it thoroughly and signed. The doctor smiled and said “You wait there Mrs. Williams, I will get everything ready for your surgery.” 

I was tired of sitting up so I took the opportunity to plop on the bed softly. I wish I had taken pictures of the place, but it’s not like that would help me. What could help me was the gear I would need/want in order to explore the complex, and fend off that demon. This isn’t about the money anymore, it’s about adventure. I spent the next hour or so just looking at all the gear I could have. 

My favorite gun, a Desert Eagle, I bought two. A bullet proof vest? Mine. Some body armor and tactical military boots? On their way. I ordered so much that I had to call my card multiple times just to make sure it was actually me making these purchases.

Then I got the must-haves, like a tool belt, flashlight, lock pick, multi-tool pocket knife, Rambo knife and an air horn. I wanted to give the bastard a taste of his own medicine. Honestly those noises it somehow produced were very loud and I’m still pissed about it. I’m trying to at least have good hearing for when I’m 60.

But nonetheless I feel content once my shopping spree is done. I went back and started watching some other YouTube videos, and talked to friends on Discord. I didn’t tell them about what I had experienced, obviously for many reasons. I told them I was life action role playing as a hospital patient in a unique game scenario I had purchased. Had I told them I was a construction worker I would have to live with that lie for as long as I wanted trusting friends. 

But the fun and games came to an end when multiple doctors came in, and strolled a wheelchair with them. I got in and they transported me to the room where I would first get a CT scan, and soon after start surgery.

They found multiple shards of glass and splintered porcelain tile in my calves, thighs, buttocks, lower and upper back, on the right side of my body, behind the arms, and neck. I was taken to surgery and put to sleep with anesthesia.

It took many hours but my surgery was fortunately a success, and I saw multiple rows of long and short stitches all over my body. I felt like garbage, and my head felt woozy from it all. I needed to rest, so they took me back to the hospital bed and I slept again. When I awoke my husband was beside me, holding my head while keeping his head down, resting on the bedside.

I spoke my husband's name, Daven Williams. He put up his head and smiled “Jessica, I’m glad your okay.” “What really happened in that place?” he said curiously. I nervously looked to the left and right. “I was working at a stunt area and something went wrong. It was my mistake for being caught in the crossfire.” He nodded while maintaining eye contact. “So let me get this straight. You were promised good money from someone who wanted to hire you as a stunt double, not only then were you subjected to what could only be described as a cannon shot of glass into your body, but you were the one who made the mistake?”

I pushed the bangs from my face and looked forward away from his gaze. I told him what he said was correct. “Jessica… I know you are lying to me. I audit people for a living, I bust people who commit tax fraud. You didn’t mention anything about the porcelain tiles lodged into your body, and as a matter of fact, I checked the nearest stunt performing areas. None of them were damaged, nor had porcelain tiles on the set.”

I told him enough was enough, I already paid for our daughter’s care so it didn’t matter. He responded hurtfully with tears in his eyes “But honey it does matter! You matter!” I hugged him shedding a tear and promised I would tell him the truth when the time came. But for now I needed to go back home.

During the next week I drove back and rang the tower bells at the complex with a simple button press. I waved and held up a letter with a “incognito” esque sticker of a character with long orangish hair and white eyes on the front, my signature symbol. I left the scene and started to drive away when I saw a man, a cloaked man standing in a blind spot. He walked over and picked up the letter, then disappeared into the woods.

I got a letter a few days later saying that my time has been extended so I can recover properly. So I didn’t need to worry about losing this opportunity. In that time frame of my recovery I got all my equipment. I put on a black shirt with long white sleeves. Black sweatpants to top it all off with the tactical military boots. I put on light pads for protection, and equipped my bullet proof body armor.

I slipped on my helmet and walked into the bathroom, holding my unloaded guns with pride as I checked myself out in the mirror. I was done basking in my awesomeness as I undressed my gear and placed it all neatly in a locked metal closet away from the hands of my daughter. The next day was the big day, I was making a comeback.

I drove smoothly in the car, listening to drill beat remixes, rock, and topping it all off with some smooth jazz. I stepped out of my car and I equip myself with the gear, getting dressed off camera. I wanted to make an epic entrance for Mr.Crickler, not a boring one. I slipped a desert eagal into my boot holster, and another in my belt’s gun holster. I was ready for another task at this wacky entertainment compound.

I scoped out the area with my gun out. I turned on the laser and pretended to make shots at random things. I see that the cost is clear and I go inside after making it to the front door. I walk in and see an inky like figure standing there. I pull out my gun and shoot it, half of its body vanishes as if air punched a hole right through. It panicky gargled in agony, with both hands on its face and jittering around.

I walk up and fire a bullet in its head, blowing it to nothing again. Leaving a pile of black that melted into an inky puddle, and drained into the floor eventually disappearing. Curiously I bent down to see one of the two busted bullets on the floor, the other being lodged in a wall to the left of the front counter.

I didn’t know for sure if bullets could be their weakness, but it was a possibility. Or rather, some other factor I have yet to harness completely. I walked over to the desk and looked inside again, rest assured there was another box of the same candy I adored. I took two pieces and ate one. After that I pulled out my crumpled task paper and read what I must do next. 

TASK #2 cleaning up the Coven merchandise, and subsequently burning it all in the incinerator. But I wasn’t going to burn it all just yet as I love efficiency. Most of these tasks involve the incinerator so I would rather just burn them all in one fell swoop. I looked to the right at the merchandise area and walked right there. Going between the large stocked isles until I make a left towards the checkout counter. I went around and sat on the chair. I checked the top drawers first and found a key with a room number on it. There was also a merchandise manual under it, so I took it. 

On the front page there is a map of the facility which made me relieved. Most importantly, there was a key list that showed which numbered room they opened. The 805 key I grabbed belongs to the merchandise storage area.

I checked the map in the manual and saw that I’m very close by, I just need to go behind the counter and open the glass door there and take a left. I walk over from the desk and open the door, on the other side is a nice open room with a couch by a large window and plants everywhere from the far right corner, with magazines and tables on my closest right by the door. The air smells minty and fresh, so I take a deep breath in and out before I walk in.

The keys jingle and clack from my pocket as I take them out and open the door. Inside is a dimly lit room filled with shelves, boxes, and what appeared to be a tiny light hanging from the ceiling. I squinted and saw a figure, a tall figure. It wasn’t the man from before. It stood on top of a cart that looks similar to what they would use in home depot to tug heavy things around.

I reached around in the darkness and hit a light switch and the thing jolted to life and started looking around. I took out my phone and recorded a video of the thing moving. I reached into my back pocket for one of those busted bullets and chucked it at a box on the far right. The creature ran off and started ripping apart the box where the casing landed and started twitching.

The creature looked like a tall girl, with two large pigtails with beads tying the hair together on each tail. It wore a pink and red dress, with sparkly black shoes with excellent polish. Its face was as normal as any doll you would find in a thrift store or shop. But its eyes didn’t look plastic as they twitched and moved around in a manner as if it were separate from its plastic body unlike real toys. 

It suddenly floated to the ceiling and turned upside down, wandering there idly. Black inkly liquid rained from the ceiling and hit me. Slime-like creatures began to form and came towards me. The lights went off and they puffed up and exploded sending me off my balance. I rolled out of the way and the creature leapt on the slimes and swallowed each whole. 

I ran to the far left and the lights suddenly turned on as if there were motion sensors. So the tiny little light wasn’t the only one. I waited until the lights went off and I unclipped the straps on both my holsters and pulled out my degals. As soon as the lights went on I opened fire sending two rounds right into the monster's head. 

It groaned and turned around tilting its head. It rushed forward and slammed me into a wall. It started biting on my shoulder, but I pulled out my tactical knife and stabbed into its face and shot it again. The creature stumbled and fumbled until it fell on its back. I breathed heavily, my whole body red and flushing with hot sensation. I look around for anything that could help me and I see something faintly glowing at the top of the furthest left shelf in the room which also happened to be the tallest one.

The lights went off again and I shined my phone flashlight at the doll. It looked like a miniature version of the monster I was facing, except something you would actually find in a box without those creepy eyes. The lights went on again surprisingly and I jolted. The creature screamed and ran towards me however I dodged out of the way at the last second and it planted itself into the boxes and shelf, ripping it apart.

Its little doll mouth was ripped open into a toothy grin, thick droopy saliva poured out as a result. Its eyes bulged from their sockets and her fingers extended longer, finishing with a sharpened spike-esque point. Metal and cardboard flew my way and I shielded my face. The lights went off and the doll was gone, I shined my light everywhere and the creature was suddenly in my face.

I could smell its breath, a mix consisting of salt, burnt charcoal, and blood. My breathing sounds like wheezing, and my feet started to feel like they were being pricked by pins and needles. The creature turned away when the lights went on and roamed around smashing boxes and ripping them apart looking for me, giggling softly not unlike a regular child.

The  glowing doll was on the floor on top of debris. I grabbed the doll by the throat then suddenly the monster put its hands to its throat as if it were being choked. I threw my arm up and the creature flew into the ceiling, floating there. I swung my hand down and the creature smashed into the ground with a loud thud. Each thud resulted in a laugh track and cartoonish sound effect. I swung my hand in every direction I could before the creature got back up and ran towards me.

I pulled out my gun and pointed it at the doll's chest and fired. The creature paused while clutching its heart. A gaping hole opened in her chest and the monster started to scream while breaking apart. It melted into a black inky mess and disappeared leaving a photograph on the floor. I squatted onto the floor to see a simple photo of a man holding a little girl's hand. The little girl looked very similar to the doll I had killed just a minute ago.

The man in the photo had the same outfit as the man I had previously encountered weeks ago during my first task. I assumed that this was Mr.Coven and his daughter, as he is shown to be the only actor in this manual to have ever played the character of Cravus The Parkour Master. I go back inside and search around. After 30 minutes of looking I uncovered 7 boxes of Coven merchandise that I brought one by one to the door. I made sure to leave the photograph on the front desk table. After that I had begun taking all 7 out to the incinerator and placing them near the area. When I was done I went back inside however the photo was gone from the desk.

I looked around. I was not alone. I jumped seeing another black inky creature right before me, a couple feet away standing by the entrance to the merchandise area. It was tall and lanky, wore a harness with hundreds of safety cables draping down its back like a cape. It wore swimming trunks with red pandas on it. On its feet were large blue flippers used for diving, and its face had a cave-like opening, as if its teeth were stalagmites or stalactites. I unstrapped the degal from my boot holster and pulled out my other degal from my body armor holster. Before I took a shot I saw it was holding the photo in a solumm manner, as if it were reminiscing over it. I shook my head and aimed, sending two rounds its way. 

One round strikes the photo, ripping it, and blows apart part of its neck. The other hits it in the opening of its head dead center. The beast cocked back and fell on its ass. It scrambled to see the photo that had been ripped by a bullet hole on the left side. 

The creature slowly got up and tilted its head to look me dead in the eyes. The tv flared to life with a news reporter talking “Come on Jessica, you shouldn’t have done that. Don’t you have a family you like to remember?” I tried to shoot the tv but I was out of bullets, I needed to reload. I turned my head and the creature let out a roar. 

The tv started going on and on about random topics, flipping channels with static that got louder each time. I felt so nauseous that I vomited all over the floor. I looked in my peripheral vision to see the monster make angry steps, each step sounding like me screaming in agony. Puddle-like rings formed and went out only to dissipate with each step.

It picked me up and slammed me into my vomit on the floor. It then ripped off my helmet, picked me up by the hair to where my feet couldn’t touch the ground and whipped me so fast I flew into one of the shelves and landed on the desk. I groaned and rolled over onto the floor, knocking the chair into the glass door and breaking it. Glass rained down on the other side of the chair.

I took this time to reload both my desert eagles, my hands shaking nervously with each bullet I load. I cough up blood and it streams down my neck. To calm my nerves I wanted to make this situation even more ironic, so I played some boss music loud enough for me to hear anywhere in the hub. However the creature didn’t seem to notice or care about the sounds.

The creature confidently walked in, each safety cable scraping the floor like nails on a chalkboard. Sparkes and steam came from the ends of each cable but did nothing to the surrounding area from what I saw. I reached around and grabbed something from the shelf on the right side of the nearest wall to the front counter. It was a Cravus The Parkour Master figurine, so I threw it right over the monster's head and it ran to follow it. 

I watched with discomfort as it screamed and tried to frantically polish the box with its hands. It ran over and placed the box where I had taken it from, then walked over to grab a broom on the floor. Once it had started sweeping I took this chance to walk out, but as soon as my foot left the counter and into the shop area it dropped the broom and ran right towards the desk, leaning over with both arms extended out as if trying to corner me.

I watched as it ran back, picked up the broom and stared at it. It lifted its leg and snapped the damn thing in half sending an echo out of random voices and trees falling from lightning strikes. It was all so random that I hadn’t realized that he had started running towards me. It leapt up in the air as if to impale me in the chest with one end of the broken broomstick. However I rolled out of the way onto the left hitting the nearest shelf to the counter. 

I watched as it vanished into the wall, leaving the two pieces of the once whole broomstick to fall on the ground with a thud with the safety harness. It then dives over me like an olympic swimmer and vanishes into a puddle on the floor, the harness buckles dragging on the ground in all directions along with it. 

It came to a stop after a while of moving around and I took this chance to grab one of the cables and tied it to a shelf. When the creature resurfaced really quickly the cable stopped it and it fell on its back. It watched me in horror as I pushed the shelf right on top of it. I quickly ran over to the next shelf near the middle area and dug my arm into all the merchandise.

It broke out of the shelf sending debris everywhere, and ripped the safety cable off so it can be free. It took the cable and whipped it in my direction, cutting my face. Before it could get me I started pushing everything off the shelves. It waved its hands around and fell to its knees. It gargled and screamed with confusion and anxiety.

It started to frantically organize and restock the Cravus merchandise properly in the shelves. It turned its back to me and I saw something interesting. Embedded into the harness was a large crystal ball with a metal ring around it. I took out both my degals and shot the crystal ball. It cracked all over, but didn’t break just yet.

The creature stopped what it was doing, as two boxes from each hand hit the floor. I noticed that my phone had started placing my favorite boss music theme and the beat was about to drop. It had started twitching violently and out of its face shot a beam of light. The whole room contorted, convulsed, and pulsated. I ran back into the lobby area and turned around to see the creature mindlessly leap around, and rip apart shelves. It’s claws grew sharper and bigger as it was ripping through walls with one swipe as easy as cutting room temperature butter with a knife.

Pieces of debris flew over my head and I ducked. The TV reporter was just staring at the screen screaming. Ink came out of all his orifices and he just kept screaming. I had enough of this shit and I shot a bullet into the screen destroying it. I was creeped out to all hell, sweating bullets, and trying to keep my cool. Tuning into the boss music blaring to keep myself from freaking out completely.

I step forward but my boots feel as though they were on fire, and they lit up in flames. I fell on my ass and took off each boot, throwing them by the front entrance. They melted into black blobs and disappeared into the floor. The doors began to open and shut, just like the drawers of the front desk. I stepped back but my socks didn’t move as if they were stuck to the ground. My feet ripped right out of the tops of my socks and they melted into the ground just like my military grade boots.

The floor felt ice cold now and my nose got hit with the foulest scents of salt, mold, and rot which flooded the room. The creature eventually stopped and looked around calmly at the mess it had created, putting one hand on its head as if it were surprised and disappointed in itself. I didn’t waste this chance and struggled to get out my rambo knife. I ran forward my feet making creaking sounds and sloppy noises on the ground. I stabbed it in the back but it hit me in the chest with a swinging motion of its arm without turning at all.

I slid to the furthest wall on the left side of the lobby, hacking and gasping for air. The creature came running at me again, but this time it dived into the floor. I ran to the left trying to get back to the merchandise area but it leapt out of the ground and into the air in front of me. I shot it in the head with my deagle and it fell onto the floor and slowly sank.

The two desert eagles in my hands started to feel like battery acid was poured over my hands and I screamed so loud I didn’t realize I dropped them. I ran back over to the desk while it was getting back up. I grabbed the two broom stick pieces and had an idea. There was still that leftover safety cable I could use by the broken shelf.

I looked around the front desk area and found the safety cable he had thrown, it was still tied to a piece of the shelf. I untied it from the piece and used the safety cable to tie the broomsticks together, making a club. I got up slowly and placed my back to the wall and it ran forward towards me screaming. I lifted up my broomstick weapon to block and it grabbed it with both hands and pushed me harder against the wall.

I struggled to breath as it pressed harder and harder, it’s ghostly breath huffing and puffing into my face. It spewed black liquid all over my face to try and blind me. I retaliated by kneeing the creature in the gut, it coughed up red liquid which I assumed to be blood. It held its hands on its abdomen while gagging and wheezing. I readied my broomstick club and swung as hard as I could onto the right side of its face. 

It stumbled back and puked blood on the floor, I used my left leg to kick into the right side of its abdomen. I then swung again at the creature's head making it spin around. Before it collapsed to the floor it slashed my armor, ripping it apart and cutting my abdomen with large open cuts, but not deep enough to do any serious damage. 

The creature gagged on the floor with its back clearly exposed to the air. I lifted up my barefoot and stomped on the knife which went so far into the crystal ball that it shattered completely like glass. I fell back onto the floor exhausted as the boss music finally finished with a triumphant close. I watched as the corpse of the creature had begun to vanish into orbs of light that rose to the ceiling and disappeared. 

It left behind the family photo and harness, however the harness only had three safety cables. The fourth one I supposed to be on the weapon I had crafted. I picked up both items and placed them on the front desk. I went back to one of the shelves still standing, and sure enough it was the one with a pencil and rubber band leading to the table. I pulled the pencil back and slipped it through the hole, watching as it flung and hit the counter.

I walked around the counter and sat down to put on some soothing music as I opened the drawer which appeared to be locked once before. Inside was a note so I decided to read it.

~~I need~~ you ~~Mr.Grayfin~~, and ~~Mrs.Celeena to~~ sabotage the harness ~~that Mr.Coven~~ will ~~be wearing.~~ I ~~also~~ need ~~you and the rest of the studio~~ to ~~set up a pipe that~~ hangs from the ceiling. Once the ~~safety~~ track gets around to the pipe I want ~~you to make sure it~~ doesn’t ~~budge~~ any ~~further past its~~ ~~center. With absolute certainty allow the pipe to only support itself, and when someone steps on~~ ~~it during the~~ parkour course all of its suspension buckles will snap ~~from the added weight.~~ ~~Succeed~~ with ~~this~~ and ~~I’ll pay~~ every ~~studio~~ employee ~~ten~~ fold ~~this~~ year, ~~signed~~ Mr. Orlean.

It was short but chilling. I got a jist of what happened involving Mr.Coven who was most likely playing the character of Cravus The Parkour Master during that event. The pipe with blood on it in the Entertainment Hall must have been once hung up by suspicion wires at the top of the ceiling alongside the other parts of the parkour course. I folded the paper and put it in my back pocket. 

I walked over to retrieve my knife and placed it back into its holster. I sighed and played a Jacksepticeye video whilst I cleaned up all the debris and dumped it all outside onto the field. After all that grueling work was finished I took an hour break, I couldn’t overwork myself. I laughed triumphantly at my victory over two demons. I kicked my feet onto the desk and leaned back to relax. I opened my eyes and realized I wasn’t barefoot at all, my military boots were still on my feet. 

I took off my boots and socks and sure enough, my feet weren’t cut, bruised, and felt fine. I put them back on and felt my stomach, it stung like hell. I pulled out my keycard from a pouch on my belt and swiped the keycard reader by the left side of the lobby. I slowly walked down Sector A and turned to the right to enter the Entertainment hall.

I turned right inside and limped towards the bench area and looked inside the locker. There was a fresh new med kit that I could use. There was also a new type of uniform, but one personalized with the things I like. Pink and white pants, with a black jacket, and a Jacksepticeye merch shirt. I thought it was sold out as I couldn’t afford nor get my hands on it. I sat there and cried tears of joy.

I cleaned and bandaged my abdomen and put on my new outfit. I put back on my gear and got ready to do the last of my work for TASK #2. I went back to the entrance of the Entertainment hall and swiped the keycard, and turned left in Sector A. I walked down the hallway and entered the lobby. 

I walked over to the merchandise room and my phone died. I sadly put it away in my right pocket and started organizing all the merchandise into separate piles. I realized that there was a door with a key card reader on the wall north of the front desk. I never saw this door before, however it needed a 7 digit code to be opened. Next to the door was a fire extinguisher and map of the entire complex.

I was so tired and exhausted that I couldn’t bother doing multiple trips. I walked behind the desk and moved the chair, stepping over the glass to get to the supply room. I took the luggage cart from the center and dragged it to the merchandise area. 

I loaded up all the Coven merchandise onto the cart and tugged it outside towards the incinerator. I left all of it there and pulled out a pen and paper. I wrote a letter stating that I would like to burn everything in one fell swoop rather than just doing it one by one. I left the paper on top of the cart with the photo. 

I walked calmly down the tunnel and to my car. I noticed that it was unlocked, and that something was in my back seat. A package with the letter “C” on it. I used my Rambo knife to open it and inside was stacks of cash. Enough to pay for my hospital bills for sure, those doctors are gonna be eating good with me around. To my surprise there was another letter on top of all the cash in the box.

There was something else behind the box. It was fresh new equipment, with a duffel bag filled with gear. This gear looked better and stronger than the stuff I had bought online. I put everything back in the car and got inside the driver seat. I wanted to just take a week break, or two. I felt like getting chinese food with my family and playing videogames with my sweet husband. 

I opened the letter I had found inside the box with all the money and proceeded to read it out loud.

dear jessica williams,

i’m so proud of you and your performance! i couldn’t have chosen anyone on this planeT any better. but enougH of the prattle, you camE back for one reason or another. as i promised in my previous letter i will tell you as much as i know. as you Can see, none of the beings you have been fighting were Real. but still pose a massivE dAnger to your well being as halluCinations. that’s doesn’t mean all the creatures are hallucinations though, so don’t get cocKy.

I watched your battle from the security camera’s, and you found the importaNt document that emphasizes the dark history of this place. i placed it there as a hint, but i cannot tell you any more about how to use it.

you are here to help me free him… he is so angry, confused, violent. i don’t even believe that he recoGnizes hiMself Anymore after the incideNt. but whenever i’m around he acts just like himself, however if he found out that i intend on burning the evidence he could get violent with me. but i assure you this isn’t a cover up, i’m trying to do this on his behalf. 

i’m trying to set his soul free jessica. the most i can do is restock the area with supplies, and pay you. if i were there to help they would get suspicious and start to investigate me. they don’t want the truth coming out. i know this is a lot to take in but if you wish to still help me after this info i will be eternally grateful.

\-Signed Mr.Crickler

After I had finished reading I turned to the left looking out the window and my heart felt like it stopped. The man was standing there. I rolled down my window and pulled out my degal and shot at him. He dodged the bullet so fast I couldn’t see it happen. He tipped his hat and demonically laughed at me, pointing his finger in enjoyment. I angrily drove to go see my family.

I got home in the afternoon and limped to the door with the box. I rung the doorbell and a second later my husband opened the door. He gasped in horror when looking at my disheveled, beaten up appearance.

“Hon… Honey? What happened?!” His hands were opened and he slowly grabbed my shoulders with a warm embrace. 

I told him that it’s alright, it’s just a scratch.

“Just a scratch.” He said in a confused and paranoid manner. “You look like as if a fucking bear attacked you, what the hell are you doing at that god forsaken job of yours Jess” He yelled in worry.

At that moment my beautiful daughter ran out and came towards me.

“Papa! She exclaimed. “Mama looks like a superhero.” She yelled excitedly and danced around.

“Charlotte, sweetheart. Please go to your room for a second, poppa and mamma need to have a private talk outside.” She stood there for a second, then smiled. “Ok” she said excitedly. “If you behave and stay in your room I’ll promise you that we will go to the Chinese buffet downtown.” He said smoothly.

Charlotte then went to her room and the door shut. He carried me outside in his strong arms and sat down on the front lawn with me.

“I need you to be truthful with me Jess, what is going on here” he asked. I sighed and pulled out my phone, but I forgot that it was dead still. I told him that I have a video of something I had encountered on my phone and I would show him later. I told him that we should just have fun and go get some Chinese food.

“You can’t keep doing this to yourself Jess, we almost lost our own daughter. I don’t want to lose you either.” he said sorrowfully as tears swell in his eyes. 

I told him again it was alright, because I wasn’t alone. I showed him the letter from Mr.Crickler. How I’m being aided by Mr.Crickler in every way he can help me. 

Before we got ready to leave for some food at the buffet, my husband told me one last thing. My husband hugged me “Just please be careful Jess…”

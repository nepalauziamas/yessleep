You probably heard about this sort of "experiment", if anyone can even call it as one. To spare you the time for searching, is the one that is often made by primarily russian and other eastern european YouTube channels with a small audience. All though recently over the years western media and other big channels discussed the possibility of the experiment and well even going to lengths at trying it.

The experiment is very easy, bassicly you inject a raw egg with your DNA. And the most common DNA sample that most channels usually use, is Human semen. 

As a freshman, in biology i do know that this is primarily impossible for anything to occur. Heck even some of the channels came forth and claimed it was a hoax, but being interested I decided to conduct my own experiment just for the sake of it.

So one day after my last lecture i got to my dorm and was preparing for the experiment. Thankfully i live alone, so i would not have to give any explanation to anyone. I will spare you the details as most likely you probably know human semen is collected, it was easy just as expected.

After my first task completed, i proceed to fill the syringe i took from the medical lab from my university with the collected sample. Afterwards i pierced the eggshell and injected the dna, i knew that most of the sample has entered as soon as i saw some of it leak from.the small hole that i made. 

I felt disgusted not going to lie, at this point while making this i really thought what the hell i was doing with my life, but it was already completed. I closed the hole using a bandage and placed the egg in a small container and wrapped it a small black towel

The idea is that the thing should be kept in total darkness and in a warmth for 10 days and well so this is what  i did. I placed the wrapped container in a cupboard under my kitchen sink still questioning my choices at that point.

The days passed by and being consumed from my university duties i had completely forgot about the container. That it was until recently, when i opened my cupboard to check if i was stocked with vegetable oil,  before leaving for the grocery store.

Due to the container being closed and wrapped, there wasn't much smell emitting from it, however when i untapped the towel i saw some of the rotting ooze leaking from the bandage.

Once i opened the container, i nearly vomited from the putrifing rotting stench that was sealed for so long inside. The stench was entering my nostrils everytime i took a breath after trying not and it felt nauseating, however i knew that what lied inside the egg shell would be even worse.

With haste i took a pair of vinyl disposal gloves and cracked it open, and i stood correct. A mustard yellow slimy blob droped into the container, followed by a dark almost black goo. The smell was unbearable, and i saw the dark and rotting protein fibers of the egg as they dangled on the edge of the broken shell, but to my suprise there wasn't no humanoid, or tentacle thingy inside this mess, how ever for a moment i noticed a tiny red spot in the yellow blob, but i thought it must have been the usual blood spots that can be found in eggs upon cracking.

"Well theres goes a once perfectly good egg", i thought to myself.

I threw the container in the trash bin situated next to me as well as the towel. Afterwards i opened the small kitchen window above it  in order for the stench to escape while i was away for shopping.

A couple of hours later i came back to my apartment, and this is where things get weird. My  apartment room is relatively small around 18 square meters to be precise. The kitchen its situated on the end of the apartment just as you enter the entrance door. 

Given the details you will understand now why i was shocked when i opened the door and i saw the trash bin on its side and its contains scattered. The stench of rotting eggs wasn't entirely gone, but something new could be felt i placed the groceries near the entrance and made myself towards the kitchen area and this where my horror began.

It wasn't visible from where i initially stood, but a couple of meters of the side of the small room on the floor a dark furry cat was laying on its side. The smell was like horrendous at this distance, as if it layed there for weeks and it's decomposing. Its eyes were milky white and its face, expressed a sense of horror, as if its death was.slow and agonizing.

I took a glimpse at the opened window and then at the trash and i noticed the small piece of leftover meat sandwich that i threw this afternoon.

"Damn cat, must have smelt the food and saw the open window, and decided to enter, but how did it die though? "

As i covered my mouth from the smell and thinking on how i was going to rid of the dead cat i noticed that the container and its contains were missing.

"Could this cat have eaten the rotten egg and died of poisoning ?" The thought made me gag, but there was no time, whatever the reason this cat an the whole trash should leave my apartment.

As i was preparing to clean the mess i began hearing a crunching sound coming from the direction of the cat. I remember taking a look and i swear what followed next, wasn't something i was prepared for.

The cat's limbs began to twist and lock into a awkward position, its neck snaped making a bone crushing sound as it twisted towards me, its once dead milky eyes now bulged and stared while, its mouth opened and a low purring screech emitted from this tormented corpse.

I froze in fear and stared in horror as the yellow slimy substance drooled from its mouth and i swear i saw something move inside it. From its nose and then mouth noodle thin red tentacles emerged flaring with menace as it stomach began to twirl as if something moved inside of it. 

I couldn't bare it i remember throwing up on the spot, i almost cried as i didn't knew what to do. Nausea began to overwhelm me and i felt paralyzed, i wanted to close my eyes but i just couldn't. The thing began to crawl in a unnatural way towards me, but it stoped halfway, it began to rattle, bones were heard breaking and twisting, amongst the crying whales of a dead cat, its stomach began bloating and I think this is where my body began to respond.

I began running towards the main entrance where i heard a small explosion, as if you popped a enormous balloon. I took a glimpse back and saw entrails and blood covering the half of the kitchen, i began to feel again nauseous.

Upon rushing outside my apartment i saw students already gathering around my door, due to the comosion. The last things i remember was that some students must have took a glimpse behind me as i passed right by them cause  i heard their screams of horror. 

The following details are not mine, but rather things i heard from nearby students as i was already passed out on the floor couple of moments later after i exited the room. Some saw the crawling cat corpse with a open stomach and the ribcage was forming sharp teeth, two claws emited from the creatures sides where the arms were supposed to be and that pulled skin was stretched and twisted in areas near its gnarly mouth and neck.

Some said that it screeched and the thin tentacles flared and wrapped on nearby objects as kt made its way towards the exit. I was told that the security guard rushed and closed the door, and that the police and fire department was called. I am not entirely sure how they dealt with it,  but i did heard by another student that fire was used, now if this is true i am not sure but i hope this thing is dead.

I am writing this from the hospital, and as of today i still have no idea how this thing had become a reality. I am somehow convinced that it has to do with that homunculus experiment. Maybe it did produced something and maybe the cat was ill of some virus causing the homunculus to mutate. 

I honestly dont know, what i do know however is that i have to provide with a statement to the police that is about to visit me in a couple of hours, and i honestly have no idea how am i going to explain this.

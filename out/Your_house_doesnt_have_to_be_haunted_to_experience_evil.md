Alright so this happened to me a year ago during my summer break, I decided to post this today so that I can go back and read it in the future, although I’m sure I’ll never forget it. I have had some slight unexplainable experiences before in my life but this is the one that truly took a toll on me and can not be explained. There’s a lot of pieces to this story and if anyone can connect anything that would be awesome. (Sorry for the length, but worth the read).

Some quick background information: I was home from college for summer break and I was working at a pharmacy Monday-Friday. I would get up at 6 am everyday to workout in the basement and then leave for work around 9 am. We are the first tenants to ever live in our house and I tell you our house is not haunted. No experiences and no feelings of unease.

This whole experience I had lasted about 3-4 days. I believe it was a Tuesday night when it all started. Tuesday night I went to bed like normal and I had a vivid nightmare. Like I said this was a year ago so I’m going to try to include what I remember. In this dream we went to the zoo or some place that had animals. Everything felt normal but then out of no where my younger brother picked up a stingray and stabbed his hand or heart (can’t remember) with its sharp tail claiming it to be some witchcraft ritual. The nightmare it self doesn’t seem that scary but I woke up in deep panic and witchcraft and evil were the only thoughts going through my head. This is when things started getting really weird.

I couldn’t go back to sleep it was close to 4:30-5 am so I decided I’d go to the basement early and workout. The whole time everywhere I went it felt like someone was watching me, I kept turning around to make sure. I dismissed this because I just had a nightmare that I couldn’t stop thinking about. Eventually I left for work and immediately felt relieved, I returned around 8 pm. Felt some unease going to bed later that night but I slept through the night and got up the next day. The next day I went to workout out again and same thing, felt like someone was watching me. But it didn’t feel right it just felt evil. Again I dismissed my thoughts and left for work, feeling a large burden lifted of my shoulders every time I left the house for work. My parents texted me while I was at work telling me their going to a friends house for dinner. I know my mom didn’t like going to this house because the people who live there claim it to be haunted by the lady who died there. They say they see her all the time and even interact with her. My mom is very spiritual and she doesn’t like the feeling she gets there. I went to bed before my parents got back that night.

So now it’s Thursday, same thing as the last 2 days. I get up, go workout, make breakfast, leave for work all while I feel this evil presence watching me. At this point I feel like I’m going crazy, but I don’t want to tell anyone what’s going on because it sounds crazy. I also felt all my energy drained, I was almost falling asleep driving to and from work. I was making small mistakes at work. But work and my car were the only places I felt safe, I dreaded the thought of driving home that Thursday night. Also that Thursday during my lunch break my mom texted me something very odd, I really wish I could remember now but it was some spiritual advice and it felt very odd with the things I was experiencing at the time. I drive home that night and my mom is walking around the house with sage. She started to look distressed as well, still I didn’t share with her what was happening with me. I go to bed that night with the same uneasiness, wake up with the same uneasiness all morning and go to work.

Friday night, oh boy Friday night I can’t explain. I get home from work, my mom was walking around the house with sage again. My parents told me they were going to a party that night. It was finally the weekend I could stay up late and not worry about work. My buddy was home from college too so I invited him over and we watched the nba playoffs in the basement. Everything felt normal that whole week when I was with another person, but as soon as I was alone it felt like a switch was flipped and that evil presence was with me. Around 11 pm my friend left, I turned off the projector and all the lights and immediately ran upstairs like a little kid. I decided to play Xbox in my bedroom and the whole time I was sitting in my chair I felt like someone was right behind me just watching me. After 30 minutes of this I invited my brother who was in his room to my Xbox party so I could have someone to talk to on the microphone. This helped a bit but still I had that feeling. After about 10-15 minutes, the Xbox party started to glitch which happens usually. So I unplugged the mic and took my headset off to try to fix it. I literally felt someone right by my head and I heard and felt a large gust of air go right by my head. I was in so much fear that I was frozen there for 5-10 seconds just scared to do anything. I went to my brothers room and asked him to sleep in my room that night so we could watch a movie. I didn’t wanna to tell him the real reason and scare him.

The next day things just stopped. I finally asked my mom if she’s been using sage and seemed a little off put because of something odd going on, she said yes and then I told her I feel the same way without going into detail. That helped because at least I knew I wasn’t crazy. But it was odd because my mom shares everything with me because she knows I don’t get scared easily, but this one time she left it at yes with a forced smile. I could tell she didn’t want to speak about it. The weirdest thing in my opinion is I had that nightmare the night before my parents went to eat dinner at a house that is haunted, and everything intensified after that dinner. 

I haven’t experienced anything since that week. But, whatever was in the house with me that week had bad intentions and it kept getting worse, I’m glad it stopped before it got even more intense.

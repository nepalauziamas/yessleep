My violin instructor’s name is Therese, and I have never heard someone play an instrument so beautifully as she does. Her fingers danced over the strings in a caress, and the sound was otherworldly. I started taking violin lessons from her over 3 years ago, and still have yet to come close to the sound she was able to draw out of her violin. She would hold it almost reverently, eyes partway closed as she swayed to the music.

It never seemed to matter what song Therese played, her violin always lent an eerie, haunting tone to the piece. Perhaps it was the uniqueness of its design. I had never seen a violin that wasn’t a deep brown in color, but hers was a smooth ashy beige. I’d never seen wood with such a smooth, grainless finish before, and it fascinated me. I thought to myself that I wished I could own one just like it, that maybe I’d be able to play even half as beautifully as Therese if I had a special violin.

Looking back, I feel foolish. I’m considering quitting violin. Instruments altogether, really. What I learned from Therese will live rent free in my head for my entire life, but I still don’t need any extra reminders.

I wish I’d never asked her about where she got her violin. She was mid-crescendo, playing one of my favorites, Schubert’s "*Ellens dritter Gesang*". I was just overcome by the soaring notes, they filled me with both a sense of longing and of deep sadness. My voice broke through the sweet slivers of sound, and once the question had left my mouth, the music ceased abruptly.

Therese’s hands lowered, gripping both the bow and violin with white knuckles. Her eyes met mine, and I saw endless sadness within their deep blue. There was a story here, a heart breaking one.

I could do nothing but sit with rapt attention and aching heart as her low, melodic voice recounted events no human was ever intended to hear of.

*“Now child, I know you well recognize the eloquent, aching tone of a rosin bow gracing the strings, but Viola’s father preferred the sound of the violin’s slightly larger sister, hence her name. Her father was a talented violist, playing frequent first string in their town’s orchestra. Her mother was a violinist, and over the years, both mother and father made beautiful music together.*

*They always told Viola she was the most beautiful song they’d ever jointly composed, and she believed it. Her hair was long and dark espresso, falling in waves around her heart shaped face. Her features were especially delicate, similar to the high cheekbones and prominent lower lip her mother boasted. A faint flush was always on her cheek, contrasting prettily against the almost translucent tone of her fair skin. Black, fluttery lashes surrounded eyes of deep blue, eyes her father said were big enough to take in the whole world. She vowed to her father that someday she would make him proud, and be a skilled musician befitting to her name. Her father would never respond, just look at her, and sadly smile and nod.*

*He knew Viola would not make it to her 16th birthday the next month.*

*See, Viola may have been his greatest masterpiece yet, but any great composer or musician will tell you, compositions aren’t always perfect.*

*As a result, Viola was not a healthy child. She had never seen the outdoors, except through photographs or the tinted windows of her 2nd floor bedroom. Her parents said the sunlight would hurt her if it was too bright. She didn’t mind so much though, she had many toys and puzzles with which to entertain her bright little mind. Her parents took such great care of her, making sure every surface of her spaces were filled with soft cushiony things to break her fall if she were to trip. If she were to bruise herself or to break a bone, the bleeding inside of her would never stop, and she would die. That’s what her father told her, sadly, sweetly, while he tied her down to the bed.*

*She never questioned the straps, why would she? Her father loved her. She was his greatest composition. She never wondered why she wasn’t allowed to make friends. Why she couldn’t have visitors. Why her bathroom was attached to her room, why the door out of her room was always locked.*

*She never knew that wasn’t what a loving parent did to their child. It was all she’d known for her entire small existence. She went about her life, reading books, playing with her dolls, none the wiser. She grew to love the times when her father would come into her room before she fell asleep, and play soft sweet music from his viola. He never let her touch his prized instrument, with its smooth black neck, silky silver strings a striking contrast against the unique beige of the wooden body. Viola had never seen a tree in real life, but she supposed that it might be walnut, or perhaps ash. Her father valued his instrument above all else. He’d look at his daughter wistfully, and tell her how he knew that she’d play even better someday.*

*Viola wondered how she’d do this if she wasn’t permitted to touch an instrument. While her room was always filled with the sweet sound of her parent’s music, her father would firmly tell her that her fingers were too delicate to hold down the strings. Viola thought her hands were plenty strong, and one day she decided to prove it to herself beyond any doubt.*

*It was late at night, several hours after the last plaintive notes of her father’s song had faded. Viola had complained vehemently about how tightly her father was binding her arms and legs, in a clever bid to have them loose enough that she could slip out. Her heart raced, her delicate fingertips trembled. Viola had never broken a rule. She was unsure of why she did so now, but felt driven by the music she felt quivering in her soul like a bird, wings beating desperately at the bars of a silver cage. She’d dreamed many times of colorful tapestries, of musical notes dancing their way across an expanse of greens, blues and pinks, and each dream ended with her reaching out her hands as the notes danced out of her grasp.*

*Not tonight, Viola told herself determinedly. She swung her pale legs over the side of her foam bed, cringing at how slender and bony they looked in the muted moonlight coming in through the tinted glass. Her tiny feet made no sound as she padded across the swathes of thick carpeting towards the door. The antique doorknob was locked from the outside, this she knew.*

*What her father didn’t know was that a few nights prior she’d stolen his key. It was for just a few moments while he checked the latches on her window to ensure she wouldn’t press against it too hard with her hands and fall to her death. She’d quickly pressed it into a block of pale pink moulding clay from her most recent craft project. She almost felt guilt for how readily her parents had agreed to provide her with it, under the guise of strengthening her fingers and creating small sculptures to display by her bedside.*

*Viola was smart. While her body had been kept still and inactive, her mind and spirit ran wild and strong. It was an old informational text about keymaking that had given her the idea, and Viola knew that night was when she had to try to find her father’s viola.*

*She didn’t want to wake up the next day as a 16 year old having never made the sweet music that surrounded her from birth.*

*Even if she could just touch that legendary instrument, she felt as though it would somehow bestow upon her the knowledge it had gleaned from years of use. She firmly set her jaw in determination as she pulled out the soap key she’d crafted. It had taken a lot of thought, but she’d been saving soap scraps for long enough that she could place them in the ceramic soap dish in her bathroom. She rested that on the top of her baseboard heater and stirred it with a hairpin until it was smooth. Pouring it was a challenge for her shaking fingers, but she was left with a perfect mold of the key her father used to lock her door. Then she’d dropped the hairpin in last to add more sturdiness. Now it was time for the final test.*

*The key scraped slightly as she inserted it into  the lock. Her father had installed the knob backwards so that it could easily be unlocked from the opposite side, and a key could be used from the inside to let out the keyholder after their nightly serenades. Viola felt a twinge of guilt rush through her as she twisted slowly…*

Click.

*It worked! Viola cheered internally, her master plan had worked. She thought not about the consequences, but about locating the beautiful ivory instrument that shared her name. She turned the knob and grimaced at the slight creak as she pulled the door open. Pausing for a moment, she strained her ears to hear any sign of movement or life.*

*After a heartbeat or two, she released her bated breath and tentatively crept into the dusky darkness of the main hall. She’d only seen this part of the house in photographs. It looked much larger and more terrifying, spread out before her in the shadows. A lone light was lit at the end of the hall, beneath it lay The Instrument. Viola’s pulse quickened in anticipation and she hastened to reach it, balanced delicately on the tips of her toes. The cool smoothness of the wooden floor beneath her feet was a strange contrast to the lavish rugs and carpets she was accustomed to, but she took little pause to experience it.*

*What did cause her to stop in her tracks was the large portrait suspended above The Instrument, now close enough that she could make out the details.*

*It was a painting, and she recognized her parents, instantly. She knew the baby was herself, from the ebony dusting of fuzz on her head, cradled in her mother’s arms.Her father stood next to his wife, a jubilant smile on his face. It was a pleasant scene, albeit one she did not recall.*

*What confused her most, though, was the other person in the painting.*

*He was tall, but clearly not any older than around 14-15. His eyes and hair mirrored Viola’s, but his eyes held a look that she had never seen in person, only in illustrations. There was sadness there, yes, but also…*

*There was* fear\*.\*

*The Instrument was before her now, and she quelled her unease and confusion about the painting upon viewing its splendor in such close proximity. She marveled at its workmanship, how the wood of the body appeared smooth but upon closer look, was slightly textured, almost porus. This was the moment she’d awaited her entire life. She reached out a trembling fingertip and lightly touched the surface.*

*Light exploded inside of her head, and she heard frantic music, building in intensity. She felt a burning, aching pain, deep inside the well of her very soul. As the music rose to a crescendo, images flashed through her mind, frightening and horrifying.*

*She saw the boy in the painting. She saw him cry as her father – It* couldn’t *be her father – tied him down in what looked like a hospital room from one of the picture books she’d read. She saw him plead and beg and ask what was happening. She saw her father, with that same jubilant smile, tell him that it was time for him to become who he was meant to be. She saw the scalpel, the blood, the saws and carving tools. She heard her father murmur that the suffering after a life of care made the music sweeter, and watched him smile wider at the boy’s screams of anguish and pain.*

*She sank slowly to the floor, silently sobbing, as more images tore through her psyche. Saw her father shape and sand the bones, pressing them together with carpenter’s glue. Heard him whisper that the voices were right, they’d always been right…*

*She was lost in these images, these revelations that seemed to come from the soul of that cursed instrument itself. Her world spun as she grasped the slender neck in both hands, letting out choked, anguished sobs, bringing it back like a batter winding up for a speedy pitch. When she swung the instrument forward and it connected with the wall, she thought she could make out the faintest notes of a sweet and wistful song, echoing through the splintering of bone meeting plaster.*

*Somehow she knew it was her brother thanking her. As she stood shakily, still clutching the broken neck of The Instrument, she felt the tune change, and she heard what the music was telling her.*

Run.

*As Viola turned and frantically stumbled down the sloping staircase to the arched door of the main foyer, her mind reeled. She gripped the bannister, guided only by the moonlight slipping through the glass. Halfway down,a voice stopped her in her tracks. Her father’s words rang out behind her, and sent chills of terror and hoplessness down her spine. She could hear that now all-too-familiar jubilant smile in his voice, even if she dare not turn around to view it.*

*“You’re still a little smaller than I’d like, little one, but… It appears your mother will have her new violin a day early.”*

*As the sun rose over the hills, staining the floors of the foyer with warm light the color of fresh blood, Viola felt the cloth pressed over her mouth. She struggled weakly as the edges of her vision faded, and she heard the last mournful notes of her brother’s spirit mourning her. Soft and sweet, with gratitude and sorrow combined in a final serenade for a sister he’d never gotten to meet…*

*As the notes died out, Viola closed her eyes, and accepted her fate. I think she must have known that this cruelty was how she’d live out her dream, and that she had no choice in that.*

*And one day, just like her brother before her, Viola’s song would cease forever.”*

Therese’s voice had remained surprisingly strong but as she spoke those final words, it shook and the sadness in her eyes spilled over, flowing down her heart shaped face as her bow clattered noisily to the floor. I had tears in my eyes as well, tears for the suffering of a child I never knew, but now grieved in a way I never thought possible. I watched wordlessly as she clutched her violin to her chest. It shook with silent sobs,as she ran a pale trembling hand through silver-specked hair the color of espresso. Her next words were whispered, I had to strain to make them out, but when I did, I felt my heart shatter irreparably.

“I always dreamed we’d someday play sweet music, together… But never like *this*.”

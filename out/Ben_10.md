So I am a huge Ben 10 fan. I have seen every episode, watched all the movies, played most of the games and collect the toys and merch.

One day, I was at the thrift store looking for clothes for my nieces, and I stumbled across a Ben 10 DVD that claimed to have every episode on it. I was excited to find it, and I bought it and popped it into my PS4 when I got home.

It looked rather legit too, the Cartoon Network logo played at the beginning, and it took me to a really well made menu. I pressed play all, and it took me to the firt episode And Then There Were 10

Things were going well until the episode after the Kevin 11 episode, where it played an episode that I have never seen before. I was confused.

The episode started out like a normal Ben 10 episode, Ben and Gwen were sitting in the Rust Bucket arguing, when some bandits started attacking it, Ben transformed into Diamondhead, and the bandits ran away. Then it played the theme song

For some reason, the theme song was a lot more distorted, and it was slower. I was really confused until after it ended. The colors of the theme were also inverted, but I thought it was just some weird glitch.

The  actual episode had every single one of Ben’s villains from all 5 Ben 10 shows plan on killing him. They then went to the Rust Bucket, where Ben was asleep, and woke him up. Ben transformed into Heatblast, but the villains overpowered him, and then they brutally beat him up. 

That scene was very brutal, as it had tons of blood and gore, which would never be shown in Ben 10. I was even more confused, when for some reason Vilgax pulled out a gun, and shot Ben, which caused him to have even more blood splatter all over the place.

Vilgax shot a bullet at the tv breaking the fourth wall, but before that, he said “you’re next”, then the TV and PS4 shut off. I thought that was just a coincedince, when all of a sudden the entire neighborhood got a power outage. I was confused. Even battery operated things could not work.

I then tried to look for my parents to tell them what happened, and they were not there. I tried finding my brothers, and they were also not there.

I then heard a faint old man voice saying “i’ts heeeeero time!”. I was freaked out, as nobody was at home. I then tried searching for that voice, but couldn’t find him. suddenly, i heard that same voice say “heeero time!”. I then realized what it was, .it was the ghost of Ben 10 from that episode.

I tried talking to the Ben’s ghost, but he wouldn’t respond as he kept on saying hero time.

 I was spooked and threw the DVD in the trash. Everything went back to normal after that, however I still hear a feint “heeero time” once in a while

This happened some time ago. I have been struggling with it since then. I admit I don't think about it anymore with the horror I used to, but still scares me and I feel sharing will help. This is my horror story. 

2018, a cold, dark, silent and lonely night. That day was just another simple one of a 16 year old kid. I went to school, I did my chores, I got exhausted and then went to sleep, nothing out of the ordinary. 

Except that is not entirely true, obviously, I wrote this here, right? I was in a really dark and depressing part of my life, my mind unable to deal with everything and my life just miserable in general, I could say mental health is the ghost of this story, and I kinda hope it is, 'cuz if what I witnessed wasn't a halucination, and I really hope it was, I don't know what to think, say or do. Part of me is still scared, that is why you are reading this. 

My head was always just spinning with all my poroblems and dealing with everything was impossible. The day in question was just another one in hell. What means that after getting inside my room I just went to bed feeling miserable and blacked out, the different part was waking up in the middle of the night and just starting to cry without any control until almost getting out of air.

Depressed as always I just got my headphones, blasted some music and got out of my room to go look into the sky through the living room big window because the view of the stars always calms me and, although my room has a window facing the same direction, I just wanted an excuse to escape my bed and walk. 

Unfortunantly there were no stars up there, just lots and lots of clouds, everything about the sky felt like an illusion masked with neverending mist and this really just made me feel even worse. I felt like I just realized I was trapped inside a really bad dream, even could feel as like something was watching me. I closed my fist, started to cry even harder, all the air getting away from my lungs and my head hurting. Whatever music I was listening to at the moment conviniently got really emotional and I simply broke. I was just lost inside myself. 

With that I basically threw myself on the couch. I stayed there, motionless for some minutes feeling all those hard feelings waiting to breathe freely again. Then, lost with everything and only sensing my own suffering, I slowly curved myself down to hug a pillow and drown my face wet with tears into that flufiness, but this is the moment when something absolutely terryfing occured. 

My headphones just fell out of my ears and my hair moved a bit, on the back of my head it was like a long, dark and skeletal hand with hard claws instead of fingers pushed me fast, but with no violence. I got startled and literally jumped back getting up but there was nothing there. I was petrified in fear, I could swear something touched me, I felt it, but it vanished instantly. 

With so many thoughts running through my head the first thing I looked at was the kitchen door to my left, open to nothing but darkness. This is the part that I refuse to believe, this is the part I could pray to not be real, this is the part that marked me and still drives me a bit crazy thinking about it. There was something there with me. 

For a brief moment, even not believing it, my eyes could see, for only the fraction of a moment, a large black humanoid creature, extremely tall and thin, curved and with no face but staring at me, and something that feels odd to think about it is that it kinda looked a bit sad, just like me. I was just alone there, sad and in the dark, all of this happens, I blink and I am alone again. I cried with a big moan and huged myself in absolute terror, but that scare cut my self-loathing and I only did what seemed logical. Got my headphones back, went into the kitchen to find it empty, got a can of soda, laughed a bit and went to my room. Not because I was brave to face that creature, but because somehow I felt that whatever that was it was already long gone.  After that I went to sleep again and later got up to live another usual day. 

I am a cetic and rational person and I may hate myself, but I try to face this experience as only a brief moment of me going a bit insane, because, honestly, if that was real I still have no idea what that "entity" was or why it was drawn to me. Even worse, I am terrified of the idea of it coming back, maybe next time I won't be able to tell the story to anyone else after it, since it may not have an after.

I was just depressed and lost inside my feelings and that thing came after me, maybe this is the reason, although it never showed up in front of me again. Call it a figment of my imagination or call it a monster, the point is how terrified this left me to this day and I hope that something like this never gets to attack me again, but, if it does, I just hope to survive. 

That said, anyone reading this, I hope you can enjoy being alone and sad at night, because, if you don't, then maybe I won't be that thing's next target. Take care and be prepared, if it's even possible to be prepared to the supernatural, believing or not, crazy things can just happen to anyone, anywhere and anyhow. If it happens to you, good luck.

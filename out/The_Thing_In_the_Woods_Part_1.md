   It’s been years since this happened. I was 5. I’m now 23. For a while I thought it was my imagination, but now rethinking it I think it might be real. So I’m going to write this down then go back to where it all happened.

   It was my birthday. My Friends and I, Andrew and Wilson, lived in a neighborhood that had a park connected to a canyon that no one went into except for some old drunks and some stupid teenagers. The canyon was usually off limits. Our parents would take us to the park, tell us not to go into the canyon, then send us off. They were supposedly watching us but My friends and I knew they were chatting away talking about adult stuff.

   For my birthday I got a baseball bat and a set of foam baseballs, to fuel my newfound sports addiction. For some reason Andrew and Wilson thought it was a good idea to make the birthday boy catcher, So I was stuck behind Wilson batting. Andrew pitched the ball. “Striiiiiike one!” I yelled as I caught the ball. I threw it back. I felt some wind starting up but I thought nothing of it. Andrew pitched the ball. “Striiiiike two!” I yelled again. The wind was getting crazy now. Andrew pitched the ball. The ball swerved into the canyon following the wind.
 
   “Oops.” Andrew said. 

   “Go get it!” I yelled. 

   “No, it’s the catcher's job to get balls!” Andrew exclaimed. 

   “Yeah!” Wilson agreed. So I went down there.

   I was walking into the canyon when I slipped on dirt and rolled down to the bottom landing facefirst. Luckily it was not a steep canyon but it had lots of big trees and around 2 miles of flat land so it was usually considered a forest by people who didn’t know it was a canyon. I looked at my knee and saw it was ok. I started looking for the ball.

   I was walking around looking for the ball when I heard some rustling from the bushes behind me. If I was older I probably would’ve thought it was a rabbit or a squirrel or the wind but I was 5 so naturally I instantly thought “monster”.  I looked behind me. Nothing. I go back to looking.

   I was still looking when I heard some whistling. It was a distinct 4 note tune that I’ve never heard before. I look behind me and I see something hiding behind a tree, it’s head peeking out at me. From what I saw it was around 7 feet tall. The skin on its face was paper thin, and I was able to see thick black veins running through its skull. It was shaped like a human head but its cheeks and eyes were sunken. Its eyes were dark circles with dilated pupils and black veins. Worst of all was his smile. It had a million teeth, rows of teeth where they shouldn’t be. They were all sharp as a knife and were yellow and blood stained. There was a chunk of flesh hanging in between his front teeth and there was a line of drool dropping off his chin.

   He looked at me for about five seconds before waving his claw like hands at me then very slowly moving his head behind the tree. I screamed and sprinted as fast as I could, tripping, and landing on a glass shard from a nearby beer bottle. I ignored the pain and kept running. I could hear its fast footsteps behind me, chasing me. I sprinted till I could see the exit of the canyon. Blood was dripping everywhere from the cut. 10 feet away from the exit, I could hear it gaining on me. 7 feet away from the exit I could hear its ragged breathing, sounding it’s lungs were about to collapse. 4 feet away, I could feel it’s warm, moldy, breath on the back of my neck. 2 feet, I hear the footsteps go  back into the canyon. I came out to see my parents freaking out and my friends explaining what happened to my parents looking like they were going to piss their pants. I ran up to my parents and started crying. They repeatedly asked me what was wrong but I just kept crying. Then they noticed my knee.


   That night when I came back from the hospital with stitches, as the glass shard messed up my knee pretty badly, I had no dream. I woke up in the middle of the night to the same distinct, 4 tuned whistle. I sat straight up and looked around. Nothing. Scared, I hid under my blanket. I heard it again. I peeked out of my blanket. Nothing. I hid again. I heard the whistle a third time. I peeked again, and to my horror the thing was standing over me! I tried to scream but when I opened my mouth it stuck its fingers inside of my mouth. I gagged tasting the dirt and crap on its fingers. It took its other hand and ripped the stitches off my knee. I squeezed my eyes and cried and when I opened them again it was gone. I just went back to sleep afraid to tell my parents what happened. When I woke up again I thought I just had a nightmare till I noticed something. Muddy footprints. Big muddy footprints. Not only that but there was blood all over the bed and my cut that was supposed to be stitched up was ripped open and scabbed. I cleaned everything up with some towels then just tried to pretend nothing happened. It never came back.

   The next night I heard my mom’s screams in the other room. We moved shortly after. I’m now 23 and I want to see if it was real. I want a real conclusion instead of my mind arguing with itself, common since over trauma. So I will be making a part 2 of this soon, as I have a business trip to the same city that this happened at. All I can say is you guys are going to have a part 2 soon.

Part 2 is out now

Hey everyone, I just wanted to share my own pet story. Recently, I came home to a raccoon in my apartment. I accidentally left my door cracked open and they must've smelled something nice and walked right in. This guy was quite surprised when he saw me and proceeded to jump, run and generally leave chaos in its wake. 

The funny thing is though, he wasn't scared. I wasn't really sure what to do. I tried to guide him out with a broom and after hitting him a few times with the bristled end he left, only for him to sit on my staircase and groom himself. 

I closed the door and went to bed just hoping it would be gone.

Waking up early, I see this raccoon sleeping at the top of my staircase as if it owned the place. I couldn't believe a wild animal would be so bold. He didn't look rabid. His coat was thick and full with deep colors, grey white and black made him the iconic raccoons we all knew. The whiskers that lazily hung off his nose were long and even, pitch white and his tail reached over the step and over the edge. As he slept took deep long breaths, moving in place as he dreamt. Seeing this as an opportunity to have a unique pet, I decided to name him Ponto. I gave him food outside and he'd take it happily, eventually he started to come back into my apartment and trusted me. This went on for a few days and I really started to understand him.

Ponto operated on an independent basis, lounging around my apartment, looking inside everything and smelling it, learning the land. He would wander into the nearby woods to do whatever raccoons do, but he always seemed happier when he came back. He never was a nuisance and seemed very intelligent, even figuring out how to open my doors and let himself out. He would often sneak out at night and bring home a variety of things, from snacks and loose change to an actual gold ring. He must've found them laying around.  I started to really appreciate Ponto and considered him another member of the household.  

One day Ponto was feeling especially lethargic, he looked in good health but didn't eat anything for the whole day. I tried to encourage him to move but no luck, hoping he would sleep it off I waited until tomorrow. He continued this behavior and made me worried so I took him to the vet.

Surprised to see a raccoon, the vet asked me how we met and I explained the situation. She found humor in it and proceeded to give Ponto a once over for good health. Ponto was scared at first but the vet had a very reassuring voice and as long as I held him she was able to look him over.

After getting a few vaccinations she explained in surprise that Ponto looked very healthy even for a domestic pet. I asked her why he was acting weird. Suspecting it was something they ate the night before, she gave me some very mild antacids and sent us on our way. With the instructions to let him rest somewhere comfortable I let him sleep on my bed while I cleaned my apartment. Letting out murmurs while he dreamt he slept calmly.

A few minutes into this, I get a knock at my door. My downstairs neighbor, Riley came to explain that her small dog was missing since last night and if I had seen them. The dog in question was a little yappy Chihuahua named Tex. The woman in question though, was Riley Pendal, a gorgeous woman with dark brown hair and piercing eyes that matched her personality. I told her I haven't seen Tex since the last time we talked. She left in a hurry and went about calling for her dog all around the apartment building.

Carrying on with my day, I decided to check in on my new raccoon companion, he seemed to be getting better. He was more energetic and started to look more comfortable. I had thought I might've fed him bad food, but the vet cleared the diet he's on.

This went on for a few more days, with Ponto becoming more friendly and learning more about my apartment, even thriving in it. He could  pour his own glass of water and even use the toilet like pet owners have posted about, I didn't want my pet to be famous though so I never posted it. 

I never trained him to do these things but I do think he took cues from my own actions especially anything involving my hands, he would watch me tie my shoes and use kitchen utensils with keen interest.

One day I swear as I was cooking I witnessed him tie two strings together.

Relaxing after work one day I once again heard someone at my door. Ponto was in the back room so I shut the door to the room and answered the front.  It was Riley again, but this time holding her dog. I asked her where he was found and she told me that some hikers heard barking off the trail. They saw Tex in something resembling a fox hole with a makeshift fence so he couldn't escape, they left food and water however. Me and Riley both expressed confusion as who would do that, but left it there, thankful that Tex was found safe. 

On an abnormally stormy night Ponto stayed inside, he grew to come and go in the night since he could open and close the front door.

That night he was dead set in making his own bed in one of my ottomans, it was hollow and he would bring blankets and little pillows and stuff them inside. I would be focusing on something else and see his head pop out and check the surroundings. I laid in bed and slowly drifted off with a content feeling in my heart, I grew to love Ponto.

 Thunder rattled on through the night but someone yelling woke me up. It was Riley. I ignored it for a minute but decided it must be serious. Leaving the apartment I saw my door was left open and with almost divine timing lightning flashed in the sky and a distant rumble followed. I ran down my stairs and called out Riley's name but saw her door was wide open as well. I immediately saw what she was screaming about. Ponto was in a corner with Tex in a consoling embrace. I figure Ponto must've gotten scared from the storm and sought out another animal. Trying to explain this to Riley though, was difficult. She was attacked by a raccoon when she was young and grew resentment and fear against them. She saw me and started yelling for help so I got in-between the three of them and picked up Ponto. With a horrified look on her face like she couldn't believe I would even pick a raccoon up, she asked 

"What the hell is that?"

"A raccoon. What does it look like?"

"WHY IS IT IN HERE?"

"It's uhh.. my new pet"

Ponto looked up at me in my arms and I pat his head. With an even more disgusted look she forced us both out.

"Keep your raccoon away from my dog!" she said, before shutting the door on us. In the downpour Ponto and I casually walked back up our steps and dried off inside. I didn't care what she thought, I knew in my heart Ponto was a good pet. Crawling back in his ottoman, I did the same, into the covers of my bed. 


After that incident, whenever a woman who resembled Riley would appear on TV, Ponto would chatter loudly and angrily. I found it hilarious so I would encourage it, I figured its good for him to let it out. He learned a lot of new tricks as well, I never trained him though. For example he can throw things with very good aim, he broke a lamp with a wrench from across the room. He loves to cook, or at least pretend, chopping vegetables was his favorite. I had a very small pen knife for him to use, because he had tiny hands, and he got pretty good at it, I was impressed.

He loves collecting things, all sorts of objects. Tape (because it's shiny), tools (great mental stimulation) he even keeps the pen knife I have in the ottoman. 

One thing pet ownership taught me is that they will always be a companion to you even when everything else goes to shit. Eventually, it did. It's like fate knew what was approcahing in my life and gave me a friend in dark times.

One day Tex started to bark early in the morning and wouldn't stop. I couldn't stand it anymore so I went to talk to Riley about it. Knocking on her door there wasn't an answer so I hit the door even harder. It wasn't closed fully and the force of the last knock pushed it open slightly. Tex immediately ran out and I was hit with a despising smell that came from inside. Opening the door I saw Riley, with tape around her mouth laying face up in her living room. Her body was full of stab marks and her throat was slit. A dark crimson pooled around her body. I didn't like her, but for this to happen I was left speechless. Almost submerged by the blood I saw something very familiar. My pen knife. I don't know how it got there but I couldn't be accused of this. I grabbed the knife and buried it outside. After calling the police they arrived, eventually, and took my testimony. The usual order for a murder investigation, asked me to stay in the area and gave condolences for the loss. 

Overwhelmed, I thought of Ponto and decided to check on him. I figure he must have sensed someone died near him, animals can do that. Looking around my apartment I found him laying on my bed, his coat was wet but I figure he was playing in the sink again. With my now wet bed I sat next to him and put my hand on him and tried to console him, or maybe just myself since I thought Riley was very attractive

"I know you and her never got along but she was a ni- hmm, she was a person. And even though people may leave in your life, the ones still here can support you"

Ponto responded with an approving chatter.

He started to walk around, happy with the company and continued his usual routine. I tried looking for Tex but he ran off. 

My area always had crime but lately the murders have been increasing. It's really gruesome stuff and police say it's a serial killer. They say the killer used only small sharp objects to inflict as much pain as possible before killing them. At every crime scene the murder weapon was left in plain site. They can't find a suspect though, no dna on the weapons except for animal, but all the victims were pet owners so there were no leads.

One man, who owned a parakeet was found with his head fully cut off. They stuck his head in an electric crockpot and turned it on. His bird was seen flying off 

An elderly woman who owned a bull mastiff was seen tied down in a chair. Her neck slit. She was very frail so couldn't move much to begin with, authorities said. Her dog was seen locked in a room but had plenty of food and water until police arrived.

A couple was found, both tied and left in their beds. With their throats slit and many stab wounds. Police report these murders were connected as well. They owned two lizards who were found in their cage and now safe in the police station as their new unofficial mascots.

I am very paranoid, I am a pet owner. What if this killer comes after me? I still feel this way today since they never caught the guy. 

My experiences with Ponto gave me something to hold on to when life gets hard. I also wanted Ponto to know that he has something to fall back to as well that's why I always let him come and go since I believe you can't truly love an animal unless it comes back willingly.

Do any other pet owners feel this way? It makes sense for all of us stay connected you know?

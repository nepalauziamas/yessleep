I'm not going to give you my real name, but you can call me Steph. I really, really need you to listen to me, and I know that's a big ask. Though most of you probably won't believe what I have to say, I pray that at least a few of you do. 

&#x200B;

I had a friend disappear without a trace. Not the most unusual thing, I know, but what was strange were the events that led up to her disappearance. You see, although we didn't think much of it at first, one day she mentioned something weird about her singleplayer Minecraft world. She would talk about a cave she found, and how sometimes at night, she could swear it almost sounded like a voice within it was talking to her. Beckoning her, specifically. My friends and I laughed it off, but whenever she brought it up, it never felt like she was joking. She would talk about it with a straight face, and not an ounce of humor could be detected in her voice.

&#x200B;

These ramblings would become more common until, eventually, she just vanished. There one day, gone the next. Naturally, our friend group thought she had run away from home or something, but as time passed and there was no sign of her, we began to grow anxious. Had she been telling the truth? Was something within her game talking to her? Sure, it was a pretty out there conclusion, but it seemed suspicious that she had mentioned those things in such a serious manner right before she went missing.

&#x200B;

We participated in search parties for her, but those turned out unfruitful. As days turned to weeks, and weeks turned to months, we gave up on the idea of finding her. Well, through conventional means, that is. Silly as it might sound, we began genuinely thinking there was more to her Minecraft stories than we originally thought. A couple friends and I decided we would spend a few hours per day searching through various singleplayer worlds in Minecraft, attempting to track down the mysterious cave she always talked about. 

&#x200B;

Nobody would believe our hunch, but we believed it. We really thought, perhaps because of our immaturity and desperation, that if we could find the cave, we could figure out what happened to her. There was nobody who believed this more than Adam who, prior to her disappearance, had been in a relationship with our missing friend. For a while we searched, and for most of that time we found nothing. Our hope slowly dwindled, but not Adam's. He remained confident that if we only looked hard enough, we could find her.  It was absurd, and everyone aside from him knew it. That's why we never found anything, of course.

&#x200B;

Until one day, we did.

&#x200B;

We found something. Well, Adam did in particular. What my friends and I had written off as impossible was suddenly a reality. We were able to preserve the transcripts from the night it happened and, well, I think you should take a look at it for yourself.

PurplePlug0: Hey Adam, what's up?

&#x200B;

StephBear: Adam it's 4 in the morning, this better be important...

&#x200B;

PurplePlug0: Yeah you're right, this better not be a waste of time.

&#x200B;

RocksSocks9: Hes been typing for a while now. Wonder what all hes got to say.

&#x200B;

StephBear: True, c'mon Adam spit it out already.

&#x200B;

Adam72: Guys its real. I found it. 

&#x200B;

PurplePlug0: You're joking right? You can't be serious.

&#x200B;

StephBear: You really mean it??? 

&#x200B;

RocksSocks9: no fucking shot man LMAO

&#x200B;

Adam72: No Im fucking serious, I see it. I mean, I hear it too. Im standing right in front of it. Its real. Oh my god its real.

&#x200B;

RockSocks9: Hear it? Just like she did?

&#x200B;

StephBear: Adam don't get any closer. I'm going to host a group video call, show us what you see.

&#x200B;

Adam72: I cant believe it. After all this time, all this searching, we finally found it. I...finally found it. 

&#x200B;

PurplePlug0: Dude, get on call. We need to see your screen, now.

&#x200B;

Adam72: It doesn't want you to see.

&#x200B;

StephBear: Excuse me?

&#x200B;

RockSocks9: What the hell is that supposed to mean?

&#x200B;

Adam72: It told me so. I found it. It only wants me to view it. To hear it.

&#x200B;

StephBear: Adam please, get on the damn call. This isn't funny. 

&#x200B;

Adam72: Im not joking Steph.

&#x200B;

StephBear: I know, but I just mean that you're starting to freak me out. What's even going on? What are you seeing? What's it telling you???

&#x200B;

PurplePlug0: Fuck, I have a bad feeling about this. We know what happened last time, we can't risk losing Adam too. I'm calling the fucking cops. I knew looking deeper into this was a shit idea.

&#x200B;

RocksSocks9: Dude, the cops arent gonna believe this. They werent a help last time, and they wont be this time. 

&#x200B;

PurplePlug0: Are you suggesting we do nothing? What the hell dude!?

&#x200B;

RocksSocks9: Im suggesting us being the last points of contact with Adam will make us look suspicious as hell. If he goes missing too, who are the cops gonna pin it on?

&#x200B;

StephBear: Both of you shut the hell up! Adam, forget what I said, please get away from the computer!

&#x200B;

Adam72: Its telling me to come to it.

&#x200B;

StephBear: What?

&#x200B;

Adam72: You asked me what its telling me. Its asking me to come. 

&#x200B;

StephBear: Dont listen to it, Jesus christ dont listen please.

&#x200B;

PurplePlug0: Steph is right Adam. Turn the computer off, we can't risk losing you too.

&#x200B;

RocksSock9: Are you two kidding me? This could be our one shot to learn about this thing. Its our only chance to find Brittney and you want to blow it?

&#x200B;

PurplePlug0: I don't give a fuck man, I'm calling the police, we're way in above our fucking heads right now. 

&#x200B;

Adam72: Its voice is so soothing. Its asking me to come to it. It wants me to come into the cave. 

&#x200B;

StephBear: Fuck im the closest to Adam im going to his house. Purple call the police. Ill be at Adams in ten minutes. 

&#x200B;

PurplePlug0: Shit Steph I dont know what to tell them what the fuck do i tell them?

&#x200B;

StephBear: Figure it the fuck out I have to go.

&#x200B;

(StephBear Disconnected)

&#x200B;

Adam72: The cave is so dark but Im navigating it perfectly. I know where to go, its guiding me deeper and deeper. Its like theres no end to how far down it goes.

&#x200B;

RocksSocks9: Adam ask it about Brittney. Ask it where she is.

&#x200B;

PurplePlug0: Rocks fuck off! Adam turn around and leave now! You have to get out of there.

&#x200B;

RocksSocks9: Adam if you want to know where your girlfriend went, this is our only hope. Ask it where she is.

&#x200B;

Adam72: It says shes farther down in the cave. It says I can find her if I keep going just a little longer. 

&#x200B;

PurplePlug0: The police are on their way Adam, just hang in there for a while longer. 

&#x200B;

RocksSocks9: Ask it why it took her from us. Ask it what the hell it even is.

&#x200B;

Adam72: The walls are growing tighter. The stone and dirt have made the walkways barely accessible. I can still go deeper. I only have to go a little further and ill find her. I promise ill find her.

&#x200B;

PurplePlug0: you dont have to fucking do this man. I know that it hurts that Brittney went missing, but this isnt going to bring her back. We cant lose you too dude, it isnt fucking worth it. Please just turn around im fucking begging you.

&#x200B;

RocksSocks9: Do you even care about her at all? You want Adam to give up when hes so god damn close? Dont you think she would have done the same for you if it had been you that went missing? 

&#x200B;

PurplePlug0: Dont you dare ask me that. You know she meant the world to me, she was my friend, but so is Adam. We cant sacrifice him just like this, it isnt right.

&#x200B;

Adam72: I cant turn around even if I wanted to. The walls close behind me. I can only go forward from here. Just a little further, I know shes here. Its telling me so. 

&#x200B;

RocksSocks9: Keep going Adam, we have to find out whats at the end of the cave.

&#x200B;

PurplePlug0: And you trust it? The thing that took her from us? I know weve been looking for this thing but we have to accept that shes gone man. Cant you use a pickaxe to dig yourself out? Anything? Or unplug your computer? Cant you do fucking anything?

&#x200B;

Adam72: I do not want to leave. I know its telling the truth. She cant be gone. 

&#x200B;

PurplePlug0: And how the hell do you know ?!

&#x200B;

Adam72: Because its her voice. Shes speaking to me. 

&#x200B;

RocksSocks9: Holy shit its her? Are you sure?

&#x200B;

Adam72: Im positive.

&#x200B;

PurplePlug0: No it isnt her you know this. Whatever is down there may sound like her but I promise you its not. You cant trust it man, please dont do this.

&#x200B;

Adam72: I see something. Theres someone at the end of the tunnel. 

&#x200B;

RocksSocks9: What does it look like?

&#x200B;

PurplePlug0: Steph and the police are going to be there in a few minutes, dont go near it Adam, fucking please.

&#x200B;

Adam72: Its too dark to see its face, but it has her voice. It has to be her. 

&#x200B;

RocksSocks9: How can we get her back Adam? Make her tell you how we can bring her back.

&#x200B;

PurplePlug0: Christ dude get the fuck away from it

&#x200B;

Adam72: The walls are so tight I can barely fit through them. Its so hard to breathe, but I can get through. Just a little further... shes right there.

&#x200B;

PurplePlug0: Answer my call man, pick up the damn phone!

&#x200B;

Adam72: My god. It looks just like her. I know its an avatar but still. It has her brown hair. It goes down to her shoulder, just like hers did. It has her light brown skin and her brown eyes... it even has her same outfit. The black dress she would always wear. Its really her. I found her. 

&#x200B;

RocksSocks9: Adam, listen to me, how do we bring her back? You have to find out.

&#x200B;

PurplePlug0: Pick up the god damn phone Adam! 

&#x200B;

Adam72: What the hell. No that cant be right... what the hell is going on?

&#x200B;

''End of Log''

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Purple would go on to send me the chat logs. As you could guess, when I got to Adam's house, there was no sign of him. Same story when the police arrived soon after. Adam lived with his parents, and they reported that they hadn't heard or seen anything the night of his disappearance. There were no signs of forced entry into the house. Adam had simply disappeared without a trace, seemingly having vanished into thin air. All that remained of him was his computer. It sat on his desk, displaying the image of his Minecraft character standing in a small opening within a cave, alone. 

&#x200B;

I, of course, feel massive guilt over this situation. Had we not decided to look into whatever happened to Brittney, Adam would not be gone now. You would think that after this, I would have given up the search. Yet, I haven't. I still load up single player worlds in Minecraft, desperately seeking out all the caves and caverns I can find. I don't know what's wrong with me, but a small, ignorant glimmer of hope persists within me that Adam and Brittney are still out there somewhere. Purple and that asshole Rocks don't know I'm still looking every day for our long lost friends. I can't risk endangering them because of my own naivety. This is my burden to bear, and mine alone.

&#x200B;

I suppose I'm getting this out to you all as a warning. Although I may have put you in danger by exposing you to this information, I may have saved some of you as well. Every Minecraft world contains millions of unique chunks of God knows what, and who's to say we've discovered all that the game contains? 

&#x200B;

Though I doubt the game itself conjured up whatever the hell took my friends from me, I have no doubt it was involved, somehow. It's a game entirely centered around creativity and the imagination. A part of me wonders if Adam and Brittney found what they did because they went out looking for it. Adam looking for what took Brittney, and Brittney looking for some creepy thing contained within her singleplayer world. She was always into video game urban legends and what not. Perhaps it was their own imaginations which sealed their fates. They believed hard enough in something, and the game most known for reflecting our creativity responded to their belief.

&#x200B;

Theories aside, I leave you with this. Please, do not look for whatever it is Adam and Brittney encountered. Don't look too hard for anything dangerous, really, because you never know what you might find.

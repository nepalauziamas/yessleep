I was with my friend John on a business trip on the opposite side of the U.S. from where we lived. It was about 6:00 PM when we walked into the hotel. I walked to the front desk, and the receptionist greeted me with a friendly "Hello!" After a brief and awkward interaction, we got the keys for John's room, room 35 and mine, room 7. We had dinner in the hotel restaurant, the door to which was in the lobby. I don't remember when I went to bed. All I know is that it was pretty early, as I had just been in the car driving all day.

I remember hearing alarms blaring in the middle of the night, waking me from my sleep. I checked the time on my phone. 1:36 AM. I also saw a text from John from about 2 minutes prior that read "Did you hear that?" I was sort of in that "barely asleep" phase that you get when you first wake up.

"Attention all residents," a voice came over the loudspeakers. "An emergency has occurred in the hotel, and we must lock down the building. All residents should stay in a safe location such as a room. If you must travel through a hallway or large open space, we advise that you should hold your breath and move as quickly and quietly as possible, while staying low to the ground. If you hear loud, banging footsteps, or any loud or sudden noise is made, immediately vacate the immediate area of the source. Stay away from areas with flickering lights or a mysterious red glow. Good luck."

The announcement ended. I began to get a little bit nervous as I texted Josh, asking him what the hell he thought was happening, and what we should do. He told me to call him, and I did.

"Hello?" He said to me.

"Josh!" I said back.

We talked for a while about what we should do, then we both heard a roar. It seemed louder on his end, and then he hung up. After a minute of processing that, I decided to try calling him back, but he called me instead. I asked him what that sound was, and why he had hung up. I was not prepared for the answer.

He said that after hearing the roar, he opened the door and peeked his head out. Right then, the lights started flickering, and he ducked down in the corner of his room, holding his breath and quietly wondering what he should do. Just then, a red glow started coming from outside the door. In his daze, he had forgotten to close it. He heard banging footsteps approaching, and as he considered getting up to close the door, he claimed he saw some sort of humanoid creature run past the door at speeds likely impossible for a person to pull off. He couldn't make out any detail, as it was running too fast. The only things he could tell me were that it was too tall and too fast to be a person, and that is was roaring loudly.

Then I guess it was my turn. I heard people screaming, and what sounded like people being mutilated. The lights started to flicker, and I ducked inside a closet, holding my breath and covering my mouth with my hand. As I was hanging up the phone and turning the ringer off, my worst fear came true, as I heard the door to my room creak open. I couldn't see the door from my angle, only the red glow that emanated from whatever was on the other side. But soon enough, that thing walked into view, the red glow filling the room. It wasn't running like when John saw it, so I could make out more detail. It was tall, about twice the height of an average human, with long arms extending down to it's knees. It appeared to be made of some kind of material resembling human muscles. I don't know where the light was coming from, it appeared to simply be illuminated by it, despite being the source.

It lacked a nose, hair or ears, only having eyes and a mouth. Its mouth was open, and I could clearly make out al least 10 layers of small, fang-like teeth on all sides of its mouth. Its eyes were the worst part. Pure black eyes with not a single bit of light reflecting off of them. Both it's hands and teeth were coated with blood. There appeared to be some pure black liquid dripping from the eyes and down its face, and at certain points it mixed with the blood on its hands and mouth, causing it to fizz up. It lingered for about 30 seconds, and I knew that even one breath or movement could kill me. It finally left the room, and once the lights stopped flickering, I let out a quiet breath. It was about 5 minutes before I gathered the courage to turn my phone on and call John. I finally did after some time, and whispered to him that the creature was in my room, and that it is not a human.

We decided we had to try and get out of the hotel somehow. We agreed to meet in the elevator. I exited my room carefully, holding my breath and moving as quick as possible while remaining silent. As I was in the hall I found a piece of paper with a bloody handprint on it. What is read was simple:

It can barely see

But it can hear.

When the lights start to flash.

That means that it's near.

If it seems to be near,

Don't be slow in the hall.

Either move very quickly,

Or don't move at all.

I saw John by the elevator, and we got in quickly. We headed to the first floor. I showed him the note, and he asked if I think this might be talking about the creature we saw. We arrived on the 1st floor, we headed to the lobby and tried to get out, only to find we couldn't open the door.

"Shit, the announcement did say the building was locked down, didn't it?" John remembered. I sighed, as the lights started to flicker. I ducked behind a chair, and John under a table. I saw the creature enter the room. I quickly ran to the elevator while staying as low to the ground as possible, and got in. John started to crawl towards me, but unfortunately I guess he couldn't hold his breath. He let out a big exhale, and the creature turned its head impossibly hard to look at him. (I'm pretty sure I heard the cracking of whatever the hell kind of bones that thing has.) The elevator door closed as he screamed, and blood shot out in all directions. As I sat there, realizing that my friend was probably dead, I noticed something strange. The elevator starting moving downwards, which was strange since I pressed the "3" button. It stopped with a "ding," and I landed in what looked like a large concrete hallway. I heard elevator doors being forced open above me, and a loud thud at the top of the elevator.

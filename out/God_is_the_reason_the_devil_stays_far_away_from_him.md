PATIENT: JAMES HAYWELL

Dear Mr. Parker,
•
I'm writing this update of the patient James Haywell in hopes of recieving some form of answers as to the patients case.
•
previously the patient's file read that he was an orphan at early birth and had been a normal teacher at Westyard High School until fifty-seven days ago when he seemed to have had a stroke for two days until suffering from an attack which seemed to have taken a heavy toll on him.
•
the patient had no previous history of any form of panic attacks and had a basic record with only a speeding ticket. I've taken the liberty of researching the patient's case due to rising events in the past three days. The patient reportedly ran past speed limits after a phone call from VA's Springfield hospital which had a power outage on the same day as the date reported in the ticket. It seems the patient drove as his wife, Mrs. Annie Haywell had been hospitalized a week prior reported with signs of a coma.
•
Pulling away from professionalism I have to ask if there is any information your deputy may have on his living and home, this is because of recent events he's been showing in the hospital which have led to majority of nurses not working with him. Recent events include

• A nurse claimed to have heard the patient screaming from his room and for about a minute saw the lights in the room flickering rapidly on and off.

• A nurse claimed to have seen a tall slender man in a black trench coat walking and entering the patients room followed by the patient screaming in distress, they entered the room with no approval but said they found nothing except for the patient sleeping in their bed.

• A doctor taking a routinely pressure test on the patient claimed to see the patient begin to bleed from their mouth followed by them yelling. A nurse entered the room without approval claiming to have heard a commotion and claims to have seen the patient floating above their bed, they said the patient fell back into their bed and closed their eyes, in the floor was [REDACTED] who was supposedly spewing blood from their mouth. both the nurse and doctor have been given paid leave for three months and we're currently looking at plans for therapy
•
As you can see the patient seems to have signs of what many would claim are a haunting/demon. The patient has no family we know of and therefore we've taken it upon ourselves to contact the local catholic church for an exorcism as requested by the staff.

this note has been left on the laptop for half an hour, I called your guys and 911 and I'm writing for notes as deputy Stewie said, a nurse is in critical care as we speak 55:12:23 she was found at the door of the patient's room and he is nowhere to be found, I've switched from laptop to phone as I write this.

•
The nurse [REDACTED] and I'm trying to wash it off the phone right now, stewie and a new officer named harry are currently looking for the patient, we're trying to get into the cameras but the building keeps going into blackouts.

Notes

• This note was recieved to officer Jesus at 15:28

• The case mentioned in note is currently under investigation

• The Treatment Center has been closed off after a fire on 02-09-2022

• The source of the fire is still under case and not determined yet

• The "Patient" spoken of in the note was found dead during the fire

• The autopsy shows varius signs of blunt force prior to the date of fire

• The death has been ruled as a heart attack but it must be noted that the internal damage to the "patient" was *according to pathologist* "enough to have killed him weeks prior to the fire"

• A nurse was interviewed 4 hours directly after the fire, when asked about the "patient" she said as follows:*"He wasn't a bad guy, very nice with awkward small talk when he was "awake" he claimed to be in constant pain and seemed very calm for his claims. He said that he had gone to church the day after his wife's death, that night he had a dream of heaven, it was extremely cold and black like the bottom of the ocean, yellow lights lead him to a figure of a tall man with old dirty white rags, he had peeling skin and he said that the man gave off a deep unsettling vibration, the man told him he was god and that he was gonna take his body to experience the touch of life, the man claimed that he gave it all away for humans and therefore became one, and that he hated it and wanted to have some fun with the power which he still had. whatever that "thing" was it IS what killed that man and I. I can't work here anymore, this isn't THIS ISN'T. this isn't a hospital anymore, this is God's church, and he isn't kind, caring or nice, he's cold, quenching and the reason the devil stays far away from him. I've seen things, and I can somehow still speak coherently, I. I've seen things, and I would sell my soul to the devil to forget it all."

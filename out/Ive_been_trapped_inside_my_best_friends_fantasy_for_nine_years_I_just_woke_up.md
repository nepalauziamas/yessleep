This will be the 1st part in a three-part post detailing my experience as a prisoner inside my own head.

The events before I woke up from my nine-year trance stuck in fantasyland are still foggy.

I remember I was carrying a tray of lemon frosting cupcakes. I remember the click-clack of my heels on concrete and my lips pulled into the widest grin I could muster, my gaze locked in front of me. I wasn’t thinking of anything else except how excited I was to see my best friend—and how much she was going to like the cupcakes I’d ordered specially from New York’s finest bakery. I remember the same thought in my head; a tumor eating away all logic, any splinters of me which dared scratch the surface. 

Emmaline was going to be so happy! 

The cupcakes were going to make her smile, and I could drown in her joy. I could let it envelope me. 

Emmaline’s happiness was all I wanted. All I craved.

Just the thought made me shiver with unbridled pleasure, the cupcakes trembling in my embrace.  

I came to an abrupt stop on the edge of the sidewalk when my phone vibrated in my dress pocket. And still smiling, I pulled it out with one hand, while the other balanced Emmaline’s cupcakes.

“Isadora?”

Click-clack!

Drilling. Right in the back of my mind, where I had been suppressed deep, deep down, I could still hear drilling.

Click-clack!

I could still hear their screaming, a cacophony of agony entangled with my own.

Click-clack!

The traffic light turned green—and as soon as I bound out into the road with a spring in my step, my world turned black.

…

Nine years earlier, I was a bully.

And you probably already know… bullies always get their karma.

“Miss Wednesday.”

Principal Carson reminded me of Dumbledore. 

He didn’t have the long white beard, or the blue cloak covered in stars, but he did have eyebrows which looked like wriggling caterpillars and a scowl like he was about to demand if I had put my name in the Goblet of Fire. Just the thought sent hysterical bubbles of laughter climbing up my throat and I had to press my lips firmly together to stop myself from laughing. It doesn’t take much to make a twelve-year-old laugh and that was my breaking point. Still though, his tone was scary.

I resumed staring down at my ratty gloves which barely covered my fingers and praying he didn’t look at my feet. The holes in my tights had gotten so big I’d had to fold them over and stuff them into my shoes, so no other kids saw my toes poking out. It was a snowy day and once again I had to hide the fact that I couldn’t stop shivering.

I was doing a good job of steeling myself in Mr Carson’s office. He had a heater. 

Once I was back in class, though, I was preparing myself for another hour of chattering teeth and struggling to concentrate. With that thought in my mind, I lifted my head and frowned at the principal. He didn’t look angry despite his booming tone. 

Instead, he looked like he was contemplating starting a specific conversation. The two of us stewed in silence while I counted the tiles in the ceiling and then the carpet, before he finally cleared his throat and steepled his fingers on the desk. He was wearing his serious expression again, and I couldn’t resist a very audible gulp.  Oh no. “Miss Wednesday, is there anything going on at home?”

My cheeks suddenly went boiling hot and I clenched my fists in my lap. “No.” I said quickly. “Why?”

Principal Carson sighed. “Several of your classmates have reported seeing worrying marks on your back. 
Now, I am not implying anything, but you can tell us anything, Gabby. If anything is going on at home and you’re feeling lost or confused, we’re here for you. We’re always here for you.” He tried to smile but it fell short.

I hated it. I hated that look of sympathy in his eyes like I was a kicked puppy on the side of the road. Everyone looked at me like that. 

Cal’s mom when I hung out in his room, her prickly eyes finding my dirty tights and the dress I’d worn the day before—and Isadora’s older sister when she brushed my knotty hair and pretended not to see head lice. They all looked at me like there was something wrong with me. And it made me want to throw things. It made me want to destroy things.

I could feel my cheeks getting hotter and hotter, tears burning in my eyes. I couldn’t cry. If I cried, I’d give it away that something was going on at home. 

But dad didn’t even mean it. He told me after he got mad and smashed up the lounge and kicked mom in the stomach. He told me he loved me, and he didn’t mean to shove me into the hard edge of the kitchen door. Besides, it didn’t even hurt. Straightening up in my chair, I settled my principal with my best glare, and the agony enveloping me and suffocating my chest turned to anger I had to swallow down. “I fell.” I said, pulling my best smile, stretching it so wide my jaw ached. I swiped at my eyes, sniffling.

I hated crying. I hated crying because it showed weakness I couldn’t show. Because I was strong. I was strong for my mother and my dad, who promised he was going to get another job so we could go to Disney World for my thirteenth birthday. 

Tears were sliding down my burning cheeks and I couldn’t stop them. They were just making me angrier, vibrating in the chair. My gaze found the notes in front of him, and I wanted to grab them and tear them up. I wanted to grab his stupid plant and throw it in his face. Because he was stupid. He was so stupid to think that my dad had actually meant to hurt me. “I actually fell, Principal Carson,” I said, drawing out my voice as if he was the slow one. “It’s not my fault you’re too stupid to realise.”

“Gabby—”

I cut him off, pulling off my cardigan. “Do you want to see?” I spat, gulping down sobs. “Do you want to see where I fell?”

“There is no need for that.”

“Oh, yeah?” I jumped up, knocking back my chair. I was smiling. Because I was no longer crying. He couldn’t see my tears, only that I was going to smash up his stupid office. I was in control. Not my principal.  “Who’s been making up lies about me?”

The principal cleared his throat. “Gabriella, nobody has been making up lies about you. Several students have expressed their concerns. As a matter of healthy and safety, I cannot disclose those details. But know that a classmate was just worried.”

“Worried?” I spluttered, clenching my fists tighter and tighter until my nails were digging into my flesh. I leaned forward, gripping the edges of his desk. “Was it Emmaline Odair?” I gritted out through my teeth, “It was Emmaline Odair wasn’t it?”

I caught a flicker in his eyes, a curl in his lip. And that was enough. It was enough to send me spinning around and gunning for the door. In three long strides, I was out of the office and back onto my middle school corridor. I was seeing red; so much red that I could barely control myself. 

Just the thought of Emmaline sitting in class with a stupid smile on her face, knowing she had told the teachers about poor Gabriella Wednesday who had an alcoholic father and a mother so deep into depression I could barely get a word out of her. 

My class was at the end of the hall, and I could hear Principal Carson’s footsteps following me.

But I didn’t stop.

I pulled open my classroom door and strode over to where Emmaline Odair was at the back of her class, bent over her bright pink notebook covered in buzzing bees and her expensive pencil case probably bought from Claire’s. I saw more red. It blurred in my eyes as anger took control. I grabbed the girl by her ponytail and wrenched her head up. I hated her. I hated that she was warm when my fingers grazed her neck. She was warm while I was cold. She had pretty designer clothes, while I was struggling to hide holes in my tights and shoes.

Emmaline’s hair was of course perfect when I gripped it tighter, and she squeaked in fright—which delighted me. Her expression of pain when she lifted her eyes and found mine, the twist in her lips when she screamed for me to let go. It exhilarated me further. “Did you tell Principal Carson lies about me?” I demanded. In the back of my mind, I knew it wasn’t her. Emmaline wouldn’t dare. She was my favorite person to pick-on because Emmaline never spoke back to me or stuck up for herself. She was an easy target. While I was calling her names and pushing her over in the playground, the other kids were distracted from my unbrushed hair and dirty clothes. 

Still though, the thrill of ripping out Emmaline’s hair filled me with copious amounts of joy. By the time my teacher was violently pulling me away, I was laughing, spluttering on my favourite nickname. “Rich Bitch!” I squirmed in my teacher’s arms, while Emmaline was escorted out, sobbing. I had clumps of her hair stuck to my nails. Fighting against the teacher, I screamed. “If you tell more lies about me I’ll rip out your hair, Rich Bitch!”

“Gabby!” My teacher was yelling, tightening her arms around my waist. “Gabby, calm down!”

I was suspended for a week after that.

I spent days watching cartoons and trying to talk to mom. I wanted to tell her about my suspension. Maybe it would shock her enough to actually eat something instead of staring at the wall. But all she did was mumble something unintelligible. 

So, I went back to watching cartoons. I watched them all day because there was no food in the house. Dad hadn’t come home yet, and watching cartoons were a good distraction. I was halfway through an episode of SpongeBob SquarePants when there was a knock at the door. 

My parents and I lived in a trailer so it wasn’t hard for someone to break in. I stiffened and tried to ignore it—but then it came again. It was around 8PM so it couldn’t be the school. Dad’s debt collectors had been taken care of and my aunt only ever visited on special occasions. Mom had fallen asleep on the couch, so I jumped up and headed to the door. 

Before I could grab the handle, though, something flew through the smashed window and hit the refrigerator. I picked it up, frowning. An Almond Joy. They were my favorite candy. By the time I’d unwrapped it and stuffed the chocolate into my mouth, I knew who was standing outside. 

1I pulled open the door and stepped out into the freezing cold, cringing I stepped in a dusting of snow settling on the steps. There were two figures standing in the dark. Isadora and Cal. The only kids I could tolerate. The two of them were smiling, but I could see something in their eyes—worry, sympathy, they were trying to hide. They didn’t know about my dad, but they did know I was always hungry. Cal had a pack of Almond Joy’s. “Gabby!” He yelled, peering at me through thick brown hair sticking from his hood. “Where the heck have you been?”

He dramatized a gasp. “She’s aliiiiveeee!”

The lamppost lit up his face and exposed every single freckle speckling his cheeks.

“I was suspended,” I stuck my tongue out at him. “What are you guys doing here?”

Isadora was holding something which looked warm and fluffy. An extra jacket. She threw it in my face with a mischievous smile, and I pulled it on quickly, reveling in the warmth. It was definitely her sister’s coat.  “Do you want to crash a party?”

I leaned against the door. “What kind of party?”

Her lips curled into a smirk. “Rich Bitch is having a birthday bash at her mansion. I found a flyer in my backpack.”

I frowned. “Doesn’t she live on the other side of town?”

Cal held up his dad’s car keys, jingling them. “Driving is easy,” he said. “It’s just like GTA, right?”

Weirdly enough, he was right. And Cal was a pretty good driver. Even if he had to stretch to reach the brake. We managed to get across town without dying, and I felt like an adult. I wound the window down and stuck my face out into the lashing wind which felt good when I was wearing Isadora’s sister’s coat. Emmaline Odair’s house was exactly how I imagined it. She had a fountain. An actual fountain. 

When Cal clumsily drove us through large metal gates, struggling with the steering wheel, a man wearing black greeted us when we parked. I couldn’t help staring in awe at the Odair house. It was like a palace, lit up in warm golden light. 

When the three of us jumped out, I took centre stage and mocked a courtesy, the three of us sharing a grin. To my surprise, though, he bowed back. “Are you here for Miss Odair?” He asked in a scratchy British accent.

“No way.” Cal muttered, elbowing me. “She’s got her own Butler! That’s so cool!”

Ignoring him, I nodded. “Why, yes I am.” I said loudly, “Where is the birthday girl?”

“She’s right inside.” He pulled out a clipboard with a golden edge. “May I have your names?”

I froze. There was no way either of us were on the guest list. Cal and Isadora were just as bad as me. The three of us had made Emmaline Odair into our own personal doll. I pulled a face. “I’m…” I trailed off, wracking my brain. “Well, my name…”

The man peered at his clipboard before his lips curved into a smile which didn’t reach his eyes. “Ah! You must be Gabriella Wednesday.” He nodded at me before his gaze flicked to the others.  “And you’re Callen Blackwood and Isadora O’ Brien.

Callen shot me a look, and Isadora visibly face palmed.

Busted.

“Okay, look. I said, “I know we’re probably on the banned list because of petty drama at school, but we really are Emmaline’s friends!” I grinned at the others. “Right? We’re like, totally besties with her. How could we miss her thirteenth birthday?”

“Uh, right!” Cal leaned casually against his dad’s car. “Actually, we’re her only friends—ow!”

Isadora elbowed him. Hard.

“Banned list?” The man chuckled. “No, Miss. This is you, correct?” He showed me the list, and to my shock my name was there at the top— along with most of the class. Cal and Isadora too. I blinked at the paper. Had Emmaline really invited us?

Well, that just made things even more interesting.

I pretended to laugh. “Oh, right! No, I was totally kidding.” I nudged the others. “Of course she invited us.”

The guard nodded. “Follow me. The party is inside.” His gaze flicked to my shoes, and I realised he could see that I wasn’t wearing socks. I’d pulled my sneakers on.  “Miss Wednesday, would you like a pair of socks? It is quite cold out here.”

His words boiled my blood.

“I’m fine.” I shot him my best fake smile, even when my toes were numb. The idea of socks made my stomach twist. “Can you just show us where the party is and stop staring at my toes?” I took a step back. “Or do you have a thing for kid’s feet?”

“Ew.” Isadora giggled. “Emmaline’s butler is as freaky as she is.”

“Does it really surprise you though?” Cal scoffed, his eyes narrowing into slits. “I bet her whole family are freaks.”

I nodded. “I wonder what our parents will think of Emmaline’s creepy Butler.”

The sudden panic the man’s eyes satisfied me. He twisted around. “I do apologise, Miss Wednesday. Right this way!”

It was like stepping inside a palace. Glittering walls. A golden chandelier hanging over my head. There were photos of Emmaline and her parents everywhere. From her as a baby to presently. “Wow.” Cal said, as we climbed the staircase eagerly. I was in awe of everything, though I couldn’t help thinking I didn’t belong there. “Emmaline really is a rich bitch.” 

He giggled. “Do you think her parents are related to royalty?”

“Her dad’s the mayor, idiot.” Isadora hit him, laughing.

The guard was in front of us, keeping his distance. “Right this way. Miss Odair is in her room.”

He led us into a large pastel pink room, and I was immediately jealous of everything. 

Before we’d jumped into his dad’s car, Cal had handed me a bright yellow paint bomb. I was already thinking up a plan in my head. We were going to ruin her room and then run for it. If the creepy butler chased us, Isadora was going to tell her parents he’d been giving her weird looks. As I stepped into the room, though, my plan sort of crumbled in my mind. I expected other kids from our class, but there was just Emmaline sitting on a queen-size bed in front of what looked like a photo album. 

When she lifted her head, her eyes lit up for a moment before she saw me—and her eyes darkened. I knew it straight away. She wasn't expecting us. 

Her mom probably insisted on her inviting the whole class. Emmaline’s butler announced our presence before leaving and shutting the door. Once he was gone, I let my smiley façade crumble. 

Cal and Isadora surrounded the bed, and I stayed near the doorway with my arms folded. I wasn’t sure when I was going to throw the paint bomb. 

Maybe I’d get her hopes up I’d gotten her a present and then throw it in her stupid face. I found my gaze wandering and finding the things I had always wanted; bright colored plushies lined up on her bed, a flat screen TV mounted on the wall and a bookshelf full of books I’d begged mom for.

Cal poked a unicorn statue on her nightstand.

Then he poked it again and again, until it tipped off, landing on the carpet with a quiet thud. It didn’t break, and I could tell he was annoyed. He picked it up, his lips curling into a cruel smile, pretending to throw it at her, and when the girl reeled back, he laughed and put it back on the stand.

“Emmaline, are you a horse girl?”

His voice was teasing, but there was that edge I loved. I found myself laughing along with him.

Emmaline shook her head, sitting up. “My mom actually got it for me,” she said with a small smile. “It’s actually really cool. It was a gift when she went to Peru— “

“Like I care!” Cal rolled his eyes. “Have you not realised yet? We’re not your friends, Emmaline!”

The girl’s expression didn’t change. “But… my statue was from my mom—"

I cut her off, motioning for the others to surround her. “We don’t care,” I spat at her. “We only came to laugh at you, freak. Nobody came to your pathetic birthday party, and it looks like your only friend is your creepy butler who stares at kids’ feet.”

Cal nodded, leaning forward. “Where are your other friends, Emmaline?”

The girl’s eyes filled with tears. “I don’t have any.” She whispered. She pointed to her photo album, and I followed her gaze.

“I’ve always wanted them. We moved around a lot, so I never made any real ones. I get a lonely a lot.”

Cal laughed. “Oh my god, that’s pathetic.” He sputtered. “I bet you cry to all your teddy bears!”

“She’s crying!” Isadora joined in. She jumped onto the bed, and it bounced up and down. “She’s actually crying!”

With the two of them getting closer to her, their teasing causing the girl’s eyes to widen in fright, I followed them, climbing onto the bed. I crawled over to her—so close my breath was in her face. She smelled like wildflowers and cotton candy. 

“You will never have friends,” I said, enjoying the poison coming out of my mouth. “Because wherever you go, this will follow you.” I grabbed at her hair, yanking at it. “We’ll follow you, Rich Bitch.” I giggled. “When you start high school, we’ll be there to tell everyone that you don’t wash your clothes and you have head lice. And when you go to college, we’ll tell everyone there the same.” I was getting more and more exhilarated by my own words. “Nobody will ever like you, Emmaline. Because you’re a freak.” I sat back when she burst into tears. “And that’s what freaks get.” I grinned. “They get no friends—”

The door opened, suddenly, and the butler appeared with a tray; three glasses of lemonade balanced on top. 

He placed the tray on the nightstand, before leaving quickly. Cal was quick to grab a glass and downed it and burped loudly, followed by Isadora. 

Emmaline’s head was buried in her knees, and I patted her hair before climbing off the bed. “We’ll be going,” I said, snatching up a glass and drinking the whole thing. It was cool and refreshing, the perfect drink sloshing down my throat, satisfying my thirst. I dropped the glass on the floor and jumped back onto the bed for a final goodbye—already feeling for the paint bomb in my pocket. “Have fun spending your 13th birthday on your own,” I teased. “Get used to it.”

I was too busy laughing at my own joke to realise Emmaline was laughing too.

Not just laughing. Her body was rocking backwards and forwards, trembling with laughter.

I curled my lip. “What are you laughing at?”

The girl lifted her head, her lips stretched out into a maniacal grin.  “I do have friends.” Emmaline said, jumping up. She pointed at the photo album, at all the empty spaces. “See! Look, look!” 

Her eyes were sparkling. “I have you guys. You’re my best friends!” Her words kind of startled me. I looked up to grin at the others, but the world suddenly tilted, and I tipped sideways and landed on one of the plushies. Instead of laughing, my stomach did a funny turn, and I couldn’t get back up. Emmaline, though, was still moving, looming over me. 

She waved the picture album in my face, but my eyes were growing heavy, fathering around the edges.  I couldn’t see. I couldn’t see what she was pointing at. When I tried to heave my body to a sitting position, I crumpled back onto my back—and Emmaline was still laughing, tears rolling down scarlet glowing cheeks.

“See!” She squealed. “See!”

I managed to move my mouth. “There are no photos.” I whispered, fear suddenly taking hold. My voice wasn’t to sound like that. It sounded like dad’s when he drank too much. “Emmaline, did you… did you do something… to that lemonade?”

I got my answer when twin thuds sounded. I didn’t see Cal and Isadora fall. But I did hear Cal’s head smash into the back of her nightstand. 

But Emmaline was still giggling. I couldn’t move, and she was grabbing my face, and I was struggling to focus through half lidded eyes. All I could see was the picture album. “No photos?” 

The girl repeated my words, her voice a sharp shriek which pierced my ears. “Silly Gabby!” She poked me in the forehead, and I closed my eyes so my head would stop spinning. And yet she was still there, prodding me again and again in my face, while I fell, plunging deeper into the dark. “We’re going to fill it up!”

I woke to a bright light blinding me. When I tried to move, my arms were strapped down. Hair tickled my face.

“Do you remember what you called me a few days ago?”

Emmaline’s voice.

My mouth felt like it was full of cotton candy. It was so hard to keep my eyes open. “I called you a gap-toothed baby.”

I didn’t mean to say that. I meant to slam my hand over my mouth, but my hands were strapped down. The filter which always stopped me from saying things I shouldn’t, was gone. My vision grew clearer. White walls. Emmaline matched them.

Her smile split open her face. She leaned close to me with wide eyes. “No, you said I had no friends.”

“You don’t.” I spat. “You’re a rich bitch and you suck. You look down on kids like me. You look down on me because I don’t have nice clothes and a nice house— “

I clamped my mouth shut before I could say anything else. My thoughts were no longer private. I expected her to get upset, maybe slap me, but the prick of her smile only turned my gut. A buzzing sound and the bed I was on started to move, reclining, so I was staring at the ceiling. 

Above me, Emmaline held something which perfectly melded into her palms. A drill in one hand, and a weird circular metal thing in the other. “I need to do some cutting first.” She said, frowning at the thing in her hand, dragging her finger across the butt. “According to that episode of Teen Titans with the mind control, I need to do some work here,” Emmaline’s finger stabbed me in the back of the head. “And then you’ll be my best friend’s forever.” She giggled. “You said I had no friends, Gabby. But I’ve had you all along. We’re all going to be best friends! You, me, Isadora, and Cal.”

She pointed across the room, and I struggled to twist around. Callen and Isadora were on the other side, covered in white sheets. They weren’t moving. I opened my mouth to cry out to them, but then I saw the red splatters, the pooling darkness on the floor. 

Callen was lying on his side. His eyes were closed, and he was pale. He was so pale, like a ghost. His face didn’t look like his, red spatters on his cheeks. From what I could see of his head, something white was wrapped around it, like a bandage. Emmaline followed my gaze, her smile pricking wider. “He’s a work in progress. Let’s just say I got a little excited.”

“Cal.” I choked out. “You hurt him!”

Her smile was as cruel as mine. “He said I had no friends. So, I’m going to make him into one.”

I couldn’t resist the sob wracking my chest. At that moment, I would have happily apologized to the girl I had terrorized, as long as she took Cal to the hospital. “I want my mom.” I whispered. “Please. Emmaline, I’m sorry. It was just a joke. I didn’t say you had no friends. You do have friends! You were… you were right! We are your friends. Just please let us go—"

“Miss Odair?”

The butler’s voice sent me feral, screaming, and wrenching against restraints pinning me down.

“Hey! Help! I’m down here! Help me! Call the cops!” I sobbed. “She’s hurt Cal! I think.. I think she’s killed him!”

Emmaline’s butler blurred into view. He snatched the drill off of Emmaline with a disapproving frown. “Miss Odair, that is not how you do it,” he said, “we use a bone saw first to cut through the skull and then we implant your mother’s device.”

I screamed, the words twisting my gut. But Emmaline giggled, covering my mouth. “But what about the funny video?”

“That comes after implantation.”

The butler held up the drill-like machine, sticking the circular metal thing onto the end. "Your mother truly has made a device which will change the world." he murmured. "Selling it to the CIA can wait. There are some bratty children in need of a lesson."

“But Cal.” Emmaline turned to frown at the other side of the room. “I made a mess, Mr Baudelaire. I don’t think he’s okay.”

"That's the beauty of the device, Miss Odair,” he chuckled. “It can fix broken things and fill them up. He'll be fine."

All I remember are the spinning blades getting closer and closer, until they were piercing me. Pain flooded me. And my screams grew choked. My body trembled. The man’s hand was holding me down, strapping velcro over my head so I couldn’t move. 

Something sharp was stuck into the back of my head, and my cries grew strangled until I was praying for the darkness. I was praying because I could feel it. I could feel the thing being forced into the back of my skull. I could hear the drilling. I could hear my own screams and Emmaline’s laughter and excited squeak when the Butler passed the drill and saw to her. I’m not going to describe the rest.

I only woke up once following that day. I was somewhere between the ages of 15-16 and Callen’s strangled screams combined with the sounds of drilling had woken me up. I think it was him who started the pattern of us coming back to fruition. 

I vaguely remember him crying out, a twelve-year-old stuck inside a teenager’s body. I remember how scared he sounded, the terror in his voice as he begged to be let go. The second time it was me, but he was awake too. Maybe that was a fault. I think when one woke up, so did the others. I was back in that room, and the spike was in my head, but clarity was there. And it was enough to move my own head around and blink my own eyes. Twisting around in the restraints which held me, I only saw a body trembling under a white sheet. 

A shadow loomed over my friend’s head which was exposed, pearly white bone glinting in the dim light. I saw the blade of the saw dig deep into his head as the drilling continued, endless, while shards of his skull splashes of deep, dark red spiraled in the air. I twisted back around and closed my eyes. I begged for the darkness to take me again—and it did. When they realised I too was crying, sobbing, shaking, they switched me back on. I’m not sure what point it was that I snapped out of it for the final time.

Was it seeing the blinding flash of headlights coming toward me as I smiled mindlessly at a fake world?

Or was it the feeling of 800 tons of metal and steel colliding with my body?

I came to with a dull pounding in my head, faced down in lemon frosting cupcakes in bright, pooling red. My face was sticky with blood, and through half-lidded eyes I glimpsed something… moving inside the frosting; a shard of silver the size of my fingernail buzzing like it was alive. 

I was staring at it, struggling to remember who exactly I was, when a warm hand grabbed mine and pulled me into a sitting position. The world wasn’t as bright as it was, and I swore I saw clouds for the first time in years. There was no bird song, only the sound of passing traffic. A paramedic was on his knees in front of me looking grave. Even when I could hear him talking to me, I couldn’t tear my gaze from the graze of metal sitting in bright yellow frosting.

“Miss? Can you tell me your name?”

I turned to him, biting back a hiss when pain sliced across the back of my skull.

“Gabby.” I whispered.

“How old are you, Gabby?”

I stared down at myself. I looked… different, though I couldn’t put a finger on why. I felt different too. I was wearing a coral-colored dress fitted to my knees and strappy sandals. The clothing was definitely not my style, and way out of my usual price range. Wincing, I ran a hand through tangles of my hair—which was silky and smooth easily slipping through my fingers. I wasn’t used to that. I had to my fingernails through it usually. “Twelve.” I whispered, “And a half. I’m actually almost 13.”

When I tried to get up, the paramedic gently pulled me back to my knees. “Gabby, you’re suffering from concussion,” he said calmly. “We’re going to take you to hospital to get you checked out, okay? Just try to stay still and we’ll get a stretcher.”

“No.” I was on my feet, swaying slightly. “No, I’m okay.” I was panicking. “I need to get home. My mom will be worried.”

The paramedic shook his head. “No, miss, we need to perform a check up to make sure everything— hey!” His eyes widened when I twisted around and lunged into a run, diving back onto the sidewalk and down a side-alley.  Running was hard with sandals on, so I pulled them off, settling on bare feet. The town around me looked almost fake. Like it had been painted in pastel colors. I knew where I was going.

I was going to my mom's trailer. My head twitched, my eyes flickering. Pain pounded. It was like my body had a mind of its own. I ended up on the doorstep of a house unfamiliar to me, and yet the key in my pocket fit the lock. The door was open, and I took a hesitant step inside. The house was warm and cosey, and I shouldn’t have felt relief, but I did. Because my body knew this house. “Gabby?” A little girl’s voice shouted. “Gabs, is that you?”

I found the source of the squeaky voice dancing in front of a large flatscreen TV. She turned and flashed me a smile. “Did you bring me a cupcake?” She asked me through a toothy grin. I stared at the little girl— and my gaze caught photo frames on the wall. The little girl was in each one— smiling at the camera. With her was a man, a boy who looked like he was in high school, and..

My head pounded again.

Mom.

The smile on her face was plastic. Everything about her was plastic, from superficial looking hair which looked like it had been styled by an actual professional, and clothes which clung to her in all the right places. I only knew mom who wore baggy sweaters and oversized jeans.  The girl lost her smile. “You look funny.” She giggled. “Did you hurt yourself?”

I was moving away from her, my body working on its own. Autopilot. I kept going up the stairs. Photo frames were covering the walls. Each one I saw my own smiling face. I saw what I was supposed to look like. But my face kept morphing. Changing. Growing older in each one.

I saw different styles. Colors in my hair. Make up. No makeup. Smiling and not smiling. Laughing and glaring at the camera. I wasn’t alone. In all these photos were two faces I knew from the younger photos. Twelve years old. But I also saw them at 13, and then 14, 15, 16, 17… it kept going, and my breath was thinning. Isadora’s red hair turned brown, and then black, and then half pink and pastel blue— before settling on a neat ponytail. Callen’s curls grew out until he settled on a ponytail, before cutting and styling it in sophomore year where he adopted more handsome features and lost his baby face. 

I noticed every photo was the same. Our smiles were the exact same, our eyes not quite meeting the camera. My manicured nails were in my hair, and I was clawing, like I could wake myself up. High school homecoming, I wore a pink dress and posed with my arms wrapped around a laughing Callen and Isadora. I squinted. 

No, not just them. There was someone else. My gaze flicked to another photo— this time at what looked like a cake sale. There I was again, smiling with the two of them, holding a tray of cakes. And behind us, with the biggest grin on her face, was Emmaline Odair.

Rich Bitch.

She was… beautiful.

 And not just because she was attractive; dark blonde hair curled and styled—- in each photo we were flawed to push her up. Junior prom, Isadora’s dress looked like a curtain, so Emmaline looked like she was walking the Met Gala. At some point I’d shaved my eyebrows off, so her makeup perfectly captured the camera. The photos kept going, an endless string of memories which weren’t mine. Which belonged to the stranger who lived in this house. The strangers whose friends had grown up and left me in the past. The stranger who wore expensive dresses and owned a phone which looked like it had been plucked directly from the future. 

There were vacations. Halloween. Christmas and birthdays. I could feel myself slowly moving back, my stomach twisting. As we grew up, we got closer and closer, until we were practically bound at the hip. I pulled off a photo of Emmaline and Callen. And then another. And another. Each photo progressed, a blossoming relationship forming, from the two of them sharing looks and flirty smiles. From holding hands and looking awkward at fifteen, to practically straddling each other at seventeen. And in each one, Callen looked more and more brain dead.

Like he wasn’t even there anymore.

There was a mirror on the wall I had been avoiding, and finally I was seeing myself. My fully grown self I couldn’t deny anymore. Blood spattered my temple, and my eyes were blood shot. But I was definitely an adult. My teenage life was right in front of me, and it meant nothing to me. A scream clawed at my throat. I had to get out. I had to get out of that house.

A scream clawed at my throat. I had to get out. I had to get out of that house.

There was a note on the refrigerator in moms handwriting:

“Stella has control of the TV tonight. Don’t argue with Daniel, please. At least try and get along.”

“You saw the note.” A voice. A boy was standing in the doorway. Maybe 17 or 18. He grabs food and steps away. “Stella has the TV, and I’m one year younger than you so you have to watch her. I’ll be in my room where I’m neither seen nor heard.”

I stepped in front of him. 

I felt like I was going to collapse.

“Who….” I couldn’t hold it back anymore. “Who are you?”

My cheeks were burning. “How do you know my mom? Why are you… why are you in those photos with my mom?”

For a moment his expression seemed to flicker, his lip curling. Before he smiled widely. 

But his gaze wasn’t on me. It was on each corner of the ceiling, like he was searching for something. The kid pushed me out of the way, before scooping half of the refrigerator into his arms. “Didn’t you tell me never to make eye contact with me or you’ll scoop my eyes out?” He backed away. “Your words. Not mine.”

“What’s going on, Gabby? Did you get the lemon frosted cupcakes?”

The voice sent me twisting around. There was a guy standing in the doorway. The same guy I’d seen in the most recent photos with his arms around Emmaline. 

It was like looking at a mannequin in place of my best friend. I could still see Cal’s childhood features, freckles dotting his cheeks and warm brown eyes. But he had a jawline now, his dark brown hair sculpted into a style I knew he’d hate. Dressed in a sherpa jacket over a band shirt and jeans, my best friend who had grown up way beyond me, came to stand in front of me. He reached out, gingerly prodding my temple. “Ouch.” His eyes weren’t even on me, they were somewhere else entirely. I noticed his whole body was rigid, his shoulders straight, stomach out. “Did you get the cupcakes?”

Daniel slipped away making barfing noises. “And with that, I pay you adieu. The sexual tension is killing me.”

“Cal.” I grabbed his shoulders when my fake brother was gone. “How old are we?”

He cocked his head. “Nineteen. Have you been knocked on the head?”

 "No. No, I'm twelve. We’re twelve!” I hissed. “Why do you keep asking me about cupcakes?!”

He folded his arms. “You were an accident.” His lip curled, “And I think… something came undone.”

His words flew right past me.

“No, I’m serious!” I held my breath. “Something really weird is going on. I don’t even live here. And that boy and girl—"

“You mean Daniel and Stella? Your stepbrother and sister?”

“I don’t have a stepbrother and sister!”

Cal sighed, pulling out his phone. “Gabriella, relax.” He said, “I’ll call Emmaline.”

“No!” I slapped the phone out of his hand and grabbed him. "Cal, I’m scared. I’m really scared, and I don’t know what’s happening." I spat out in a hiss. I wasn't expecting him to react the way he did, his eyes flashing like something was coming alive-- it was that same light. The same one I'd seen in the dark. He blinked, and the light flickered out, but I sensed it was still there circling his iris. I backed away when his expression seemed to darken before he lunged forward, wrapping his hand around my throat--squeezing. 

Black spots danced in my eyes. I felt him lift me, but my own body was working against me, kicking into a reaction I didn’t understand. I slammed my head into his and he stumbled back, grabbing for a knife. I only manged to see it slice through the air, a silver blur, before my hand whipped out and I caught it. Just like a movie. For a moment I was baffled, and kind of excited by my own reflexes, though reality settled in, and I dropped it. Before it could hit the ground, though, he got the upper hand, ducking and grabbing the blade and slamming the teeth into my exposed throat.

“Concussion, Gabby?” Cal gasped out, his blazing eyes searching mine. “You’re bleeding. Which means something has become undone.”

I struggled under his weight and planted my left foot into his gut, shoving him back. When he stumbled, I grabbed the closest thing I could snatch up, a fork, and held it, prongs out. The perfect weapon. 

If it went in his eye. There were other pressure points which would fit, easily buckling his legs. Instead of giving in to that urge burning inside my brain, I let the fork slip through my fingers. Though once he knew I was backing down, he snapped again, lunging forward, perfectly poised on his toes. He grabbed me by the hair and slammed my head into the counter. 

Pain exploded. But it only motivated my next move. With him straddling my body, and pinning me to the countertop, I snatched up the closest thing I could grab--a frying pan. “Listen to me!” I squeaked, waving the damn thing. When he directed a punch at my face, I ducked, and wrapped my arms around his waist, slamming him into the refrigerator. He crumpled finally, but his body was still squirming, like there was something alive underneath his skin. With him pinned to the silver base of the fridge, I finally managed to spit out words.

"Cal." I gasped out, trying to ignore his gritted teeth and the feral look taking over his expression.

"You've got to tell me what’s going on.”

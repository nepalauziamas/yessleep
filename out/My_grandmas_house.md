Hi, my name is Gia (F15) 

My grandmother(F72) lives in a very old and pretty creepy house in New York, I had been going over to her house since I was a baby and as I grew up that house gave me the creeps. 

I know that sounds normal for an old house but I promise it was more then just that.

Anyways, I believe my first experience with paranormal stuff was when I was about 9 years old. 

I was sleeping over at her house because I would do that a lot at that time, I was in my fathers old room (he passed away 3 months before my 9th birthday) and I woke up around 2:50am and I went to the bathroom.

I did my business and started walking back to the room and I saw a figure lay down on the bed, Not a shadow but a figure, I full blown grown man’s body lay down on my bed. 

For a minute I thought maybe it was my grandma but why would she lay in my bed. It’s 2:54am why would she be awake. 

I walked over to her room and peaked in…she was asleep in bed. Out cold completely passed out. 

I turn to look and the figure is just standing in the doorway looking at me and I had this dark feeling wash over me. I ran into my grandmas room and woke her up crying. I turn to show her what I was seeing and it was gone.

The figure was just gone 

She sat me on her bed and searched the house, nothing, no one, all doors locked and her alarm system set. 

Absolutely nothing 

We went back to bed and I stayed in her room, I could not sleep, I knew there was something there…

I saw it…
I felt it…
I swear it was there
There’s no way it wasn’t

A few months later I was sleeping over again. 
2:50am
I’m woken up 

The corner of my room was blocked by something 

That damn man standing in the corner

It moved closer and reached out to touch me, cold…pure cold on my forehead
I didn’t feel a hand 
All I felt was cold

I closed my eyes
3 Minutes passed 
The feeling went away

I called my mom 
Made her pick me up
I never went back to that house again
That feeling was not my father 
It was NOT something good 
It was evil 

Pure fucking evil

I’m almost 16 now and I hate being in that house, I always feel that dark feeling like somethings watching me

Like something bad is going to happen

It feels weird and I don’t know how to explain it

I live in California now and my grandma always asks when I’m going to visit. I tell her soon but to be quite honest with you all…I’m not going back.

Don’t get me wrong, I’m not an asshole for not wanting to visit her…I love her very much. But that house…I can’t deal with that house

Place gives me the creeps.

I have vouched to never go back

When I say never 

I promise you all 

I mean fucking never

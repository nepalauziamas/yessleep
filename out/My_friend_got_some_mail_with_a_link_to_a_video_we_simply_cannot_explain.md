When was the last time you felt truly scared? I’m talking about that frozen in place type of reaction where your face and your butt cheeks tense up at the same time. That type of fear where your feet feel like they’re encased in concrete, but your stomach is hovering over you like a twisted halo. What we saw that afternoon in Mumble House was a fright so surreal that I still wear my halo to this day, ten years later…

We were a group of young teens with a common thirst for thrills. Horror fanatics. The type of kids you’d see doodling Jason Vorhees on their 5-subject notebooks. Halloween wasn’t just one night a year for us, it was every day and in varying degrees. We were the kids who were wearing out tapes in our VHS players from repeated watch-throughs. Ask any of us how many times we’d watched A Nightmare Before Christmas and you’d see our eyes roll back in our heads, grasping at a number without limit.

&#x200B;

Every day after school we’d scour the internet for the most convincing supernatural videos we could find. Anything that could produce that addictive jolt on the receiving end of a jump-scare, or a slow and shaky camera panning over something unnatural and wrong, That was the shit we lived for. We were on every supernatural blog we could find, to the point where we had each member of our 5-person crew dedicated to one branch of the supernatural:

&#x200B;

Addy was our ghost/poltergeist/specter specialist. Anything related to haunted houses, ghostly appearances, apparitions, she was on the pulse. Or I guess lack thereof.

&#x200B;

Destiny was our cryptozoologist. That’s your Bigfoots, your Jersey Devils, your Loch Ness, basically any creature feature. Her bedroom was a mess of yarn-addled pictures connecting and tracking of all sorts of terrifying yet still somewhat natural beasties.

&#x200B;

Bartholomew handled what I would consider to be some of the scariest content available. He was a master of the macabre, specifically the horrors that belonged not to monsters, but to men. Your Bundy’s, Dahmer’s, and Gacy types. Bart also got to flex the title of Iron Stomach, seemingly unphased by crime scene photos that would cause grown men to dry heave.

&#x200B;

Desmond was our go-to Occultist. Which was incredibly ironic as his father was the leader of our small town’s local parish. Fortunately, his deep-seated religious upbringing gave him access to the church library, and with it all the old texts on anything demon related.

&#x200B;

Lastly, we come to me, a relatively quiet farm boy who had a passion for folk horror. All your classic tall tales like Hansel and Gretel, The Wicker Man, Krampus; basically anything tied to mythology and folklore. I grew up with access to a huge library and not a lot to do in terms of entertainment at the farm. By the time I was 12 years old I had a near unnecessary knowledge of myths and monsters from all over the world.

&#x200B;

It was a Friday afternoon, shortly after school ended and we all retired to our homes to jump into MSN Messenger and start sending links and ideas back and forth. The five of us had been workshopping the idea of starting a YouTube channel and hitting up some nearby supernatural hot spots in our area but living in a small farm town, hours from the nearest city, there wasn’t really anything worth checking out. The most important thing for us was authenticity. We were well aware of many fakers out there, setting up practical effects and even using the very primitive level of CGI at the time (the early 2000s meant that good effects were locked behind a minimum price tag of a few thousand dollars) to fake some near-believable spooks. Of course, we knew the telltale signs of what to watch out for.

&#x200B;

Most of our time sending videos back and forth was used to analyze the scariest and most popular videos frame by frame to expose the fakes. In our eyes, we had a responsibility to the rest of the more gullible believers. Someone had to be vigilant against what was fake so that when something irrefutable finally surfaced, there was a standard by which we could prove or disprove a video. To this day, the Mumble House video still runs on repeat in my head despite it being scrubbed from the internet entirely.

&#x200B;

“You guys are going to absolutely PISS yourselves with this one,” Desmond’s signature excitement blinked through my computer monitor.

&#x200B;

“Before I link it though, I need to add some context because I’m literally still shaking. My dad slid some mail under my door after he got home today. Got my “cursed coin” from The National Inquirer finally! So that was a nice surprise.”

&#x200B;

“Interestingly enough though, I got a personal letter as well. No return address, red sharpie for my address, terrible handwriting. Even LOOKING at it gives me the creeps. Can’t believe pops didn’t open it himself. Must have been too concentrated on his sermon for mass this weekend. I’m thankful he didn’t because you guys are NOT going to believe this. All the letter had was a handwritten link to a website, all numbers and letters, and when I typed it into my address bar it took me to a video link and a timer.”

&#x200B;

“I just watched it, twice, and the hairs on my neck are still on end. Destiny, you’re going to have a heyday with this one”

&#x200B;

Immediately after his last message he sent the link. The timer on the webpage blinked like every cheesy action movie’s bomb timer. Red font on a black background flashed 40:23, ticking down by the second with every other flash. I dimmed the lights in my room until I was in total darkness (thanks, blackout curtains) and readied myself for something spooky.

&#x200B;

The video starts out with an approach down an overgrown road. Birch and poplar trees nearly blot out the sun as the camera approaches the only discernable structure; a two-story house with only one window. Despite the incredible amount of overgrowth around the house, the structure itself looked like it was in good condition. The sky-blue paint on the siding looked almost inviting, but in spite of the calming choice of color, you could tell this house had an aura to it.

&#x200B;

The cameraman advances towards the front door where there’s a pull-chain attached to the doorframe. Odd, considering houses around here usually either have a doorbell or what Bart used to call a “goth-knocker”, those giant steel horseshoe-shaped chunks of metal on a hinge that you can slam down against the door for a hilariously rude sounding announcement of your presence.

&#x200B;

The cameraman goes to reach for the pull chain but before his gloved hand can reach it, the audio turns to alarmingly loud static as he falls backward from the door and the camera points skyward for 28 seconds, the static thrumming up and down in volume and slowly fading as he starts to pick himself up.

&#x200B;

After a shuffle to his feet, the camera pans over to the single window – a rather large window 4 feet wide and 6 feet tall. The type of window shape you’d attribute to a church’s stained-glass aesthetic, although instead of bright colors and shapes this window looked like it was spraypainted black from the inside. Or at least it appeared that way until something porcelain white zipped across the width of the window from right to left, towards the front door.

&#x200B;

The cameraman falls backwards once again, the corners of the lens of his camera cracking and splintering, rendering the rest of the footage slightly blocked as he stands back up onto his feet. The rest of the video is where the skepticism ramps up 100%.

&#x200B;

The static returns, but beneath the crisp crackling of the audio you can hear a low mumbling. I would say “human” mumbling but the Indiscernible vowels and consonants run together far faster than any mouth I’ve ever encountered could speak. Barely louder than the static itself the mumbles peak and then stop suddenly, just before the camera pans up towards the roof.

&#x200B;

Something so black its contours and features don’t even show on the surprisingly high-resolution video rolls off the roof and falls towards the cameraman. He shrieks an ear-piercing scream that seems to last an eternity until the (boulder?) collides with him. The next 15 seconds of the video are etched into my mind as clear as day as if I were there watching…

&#x200B;

The camera, upon the collision of the roof boulder-type-thing, lands serendipitously on its bottom a few feet back from the crumpled twitching body of the cameraman. Just out of focus on the far left of the camera’s screen this blackened mass starts to roll towards the door. No static this time, the indiscernible mumbling starts again, almost blowing out the speakers on my desk. I fumble to turn the volume down, knocking over my mouse and knee-jerking my legs into the keyboard tray of my desk so hard my entire setup jumps with me, my eyes glued to the screen the entire time. The front door to the house opens about a meter and then what I can only describe as a cane with a rug attached to it, bent in two spots like knuckles, hooks onto the jeans of the man and pulls his body into the house within a second – a distance we estimate to be 6 feet from the door (how it could pull an average size man so far so fast, we don’t know), as it slams shut and the video cuts to black. For a single second, an address flashes up on the screen: Township Road 442, Old Cedar Crest, mile marker 10. I audibly gulped, my stomach officially in my throat, and braced myself for a second watch through as my Messenger notifications dinged softly in the background, miles away from my mind.

&#x200B;

Old Cedar Crest was not only close to our town, but within biking distance from my place. Tomorrow we ride out with our own cameras to see what’s really going on here.

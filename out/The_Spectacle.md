I’m leaving this here because I have no where else to say it, I’m not crazy! Everyone else thinks I am, my family and friends, even my reports with the police have caused concern and notice, especially from the government. What’s my story exactly? I’ll tell you, even as insane as it may seem, what I’m about to tell you is the truth.

October 9th, 2020, 12:03pm. Hurricane Delta was arriving. My family already left and I decided to stay behind. My house was medium sized, and in need of repairs due from Hurricane Laura, and Delta only added on to that nastiness. My house was out of power and completely dark. It wasn’t all too bad though, my room was not as hot as the rest of the house and I set up a couple of flashlights to lighten up the place. I was comfortable, and Mother Nature’s power only made it more soothing. And just like that, the harsh weather put me to sleep.

14:34pm. Hurricane Delta approached. I woke up to loud thunder, heavy winds, and pounding rain, and yet the worst, was me sweating like a pig in a powerless house in south Texas. I was hungry. I rummaged through the kitchen and pantry closet and to my luck, no food was found. There’d be no point anyway since there was no power. For the rest of the time alone in my house, I stayed in my room doing nothing, I didn’t want to since it was hot! It started to thunder, and it shook the house. It almost felt like it rattled the ground too. 10 seconds later, thunder again. “Damn! One hell of a storm!”, I thought. I got up and walked across the house to get to the front door, and the crash of thunder was shaking everything. All it took was to unlock the deadbolt and the door flung open. The wind was the first thing that hit me, it was full of force, add the hard rain onto that, it was majestic. I stood my ground and walked out to my front lawn. The sky was a mix of dark grey and black, it was… a haunting site.

Looking at it was, unnerving, I had a very bizarre feeling about it. It thundered once more but it shook the ground I stood on. When the lightning sparked through the sky, that’s when I saw it... Far in the distance looking towards our town’s water tower, there was this giant, dark shadow that I couldn’t make much out of, the lightning faded making the outline very faint. Lightning flashed again, showing the shadow slowly moving. There was three more just like it. It was a spectacle. Sparks illuminate the sky once more, as the massive shapes grew closer. The shapes were moving in my direction, growing closer and larger in size, the once beautifully thought visual of Mother Nature became an abominable nightmare. Terrified, I ran back inside. As I ran to my room, the thunder grew closer and more violent, the house was shaking as everything around me started tearing away. I slammed my bedroom door shut and hid under my bed. And then all was quiet… The room grew cold and whatever light shined from my window was no more. Only darkness and silence.

I turned on the flashlight on my phone and decided to peak from beneath my bed. It was so cold, you could see your own breath. My window was fogged, so I cleared as much of it off to get a better look. This next part, I still dream about... the red eye focusing on me, staring at me, like it was staring into my soul. The presence before me was otherworldly, this vile spectacle can only be described as demonic. Staring into the eye of the beast, horrified by the awful majestic, it softly spoke as if it came from right behind me. “Eleven. Eleven.” 

18:10pm. Hurricane Delta passes. I woke up on the floor. I pick myself up off the floor slowly, my body in pain, but my conscious was still clear with the experience before. I walked over to my window and all was calm. I questioned my reality, and truthfully, there’s no answer to it. I decided to leave my house and meet my mom an hour away in Silsbee. I gathered my things, hopped in my car, and left. Passing through each street, there was nothing but devastation. Debris of trees and roof shingles were everywhere, however one thing on my drive caught my eye. It was the giant hole in the ground that caught my attention, as if something came out of it. I drive off, only in my thoughts... I have no idea what I saw, nor do I think I wanna know, but what still sticks to me, is what it said. What is eleven’s significance to me? What does it mean? Well, that’s my story. If you’re searching the lines for a point, you’ve probably missed it. Truthfully, there was never anything there in the first place.

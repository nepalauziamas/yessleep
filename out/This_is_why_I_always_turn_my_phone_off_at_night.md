It’s 3am. An official phone alert woke me up. It says ‘ do not look at the moon’. I check my phone to see hundreds of notifications from different numbers, some I don’t even recognise. It read ‘look outside, it’s a beautiful night’.

I put my phone down, feeling uneasy and wondering what is going on. I have always been paranoid and superstitious so I decide to not look outside. I sit alone thinking about what is going on and I start to consider if it's just some weird scam type thing. I check my phone again to make sure it's even real, which it is. Then I see a message from my mom. "oh honey look outside it's beautiful!" now I panic, even my mom is in on this? Is this some weird prank? I text her back, "what's going on? Why should I look outside?" she replies with, "it's so pretty outside, you should take a look!" 

At this point I'm feeling scared and confused. Why are they telling me to look outside? I was told not to. I jump at the sound of my best friend texting me. he says, "Dude, did you get that message saying to not look outside?" this relieved me, and I told him what happened to me. "The same happened to me! What's going on? Do you know what's outside?" I told him that I have no clue, and I'm worried. I told him my mom was texting it and everything. "That's weird." he says. Before I can text him back, there's a knock on my door. "Sweetie?" I hear my mom call. I call back to her, asking if she got any weird texts. "Weird texts? I haven't got any texts, nope." I asked her to come in so I could show her my messages but she refused. I called out to her to ask why she can't come in, but there was no response. I called again, but there was nothing. "What the hell is happening?" I ask myself. then I remembered my friend. I texted him, "sorry, my mom was talking. she was acting really weird." "Oh, I'm glad you're back!" he replied. "I wanted to tell you that I'm going to look out to see what the fuss is about." "What?? no!" I tell him. but he didn't respond. 

I waited 5 minutes, quaking in fear and worry, when eventually my phone lit up. It was my friend. I looked at the message, and it said "dude." I told him I was worried sick and asked him what happened. he replied with, "it's beautiful outside. you should take a look." my heart dropped. Suddenly there was a knock on my door. "sweetie..." the voice called. the door creaked opened. my mom entered the room. but it wasn't my mom. It was skinny, with jet black eyes. It grew a terrifying grin as it starred at me and said, "look outside sweetie." I screamed, as it came at me. The last thing I saw was my friend telling me to look outside, and the light of the moon burned my eyes. 

As I stared at the bright glare of the moon, it felt like my eyeballs were being pierced by thousands of needles. I cried out as my mom held my head still, laughing. I couldn't close my eyes. It felt like the longer I stared, the more I had to keep staring. Suddenly my body felt weak. My arms and legs went limp as I felt a wave of cold rush through my body. My hands tingled, then I felt a sharp excruciating pain in each of my fingers. I glanced down to see them growing freakishly long. my nails grew sharp and I freaked out. I was crying for help, but all that was on the street was creatures like what was holding me still, which I was now turning into. 

As I watched the streets lit up by the moonlight, I notice the tingle moving through my body downwards. I felt a terrible pain, as if my stomach was being crushed. I watched in horror as my belly started getting thinner, my while body stretching and morphing. I screamed until my throat felt like it was being ripped to shreds. then it stopped. 

My mom let me free and I stood up, feeling like I wasn't fully in control of my body. she looked at me, the grin wider. "lovely, wasn't it?" she said in a hushed tone, and I noticed a tear dripping from her black eye. I tried to yell, but nothing came out. My mouth stayed shut. Then, my mouth opened, out of my control. "It sure was." said a voice, out of my body. It sounded like mine but at the same time it was so different. I wasn't in control of my body, although my mind was still here. That's when I realized that my mom is in that creature. She had to watch what it did to me.

I almost started crying myself. It put it's arm around me, guiding me to the door. We went outside and started following the others. I watched as my neighbor came out of his house, transformed. I watched as creatures entered houses and came out with the members of that house, transformed. "what are we going to do, mom?" I said in my mind and then the creature beside me looked at me, as if mom heard me. Then it looked away and walked ahead, into her old friends house. I walked with the crowd, starting to cry. What will I do? 

Is this the end of humanity?

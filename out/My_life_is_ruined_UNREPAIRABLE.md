I used to be the perfect guy, passed every exam perfectly, got perfect on all my scores, most popular in school. On course to get the perfect life. 

But, *hahahaha* who thought it would’ve been a perfect life huh, because obviously, *roll’s eyes* there are gonna be enemies.

*HAHAHAHA* I was on a summer break, relaxing in my room, *takes a sip of coffee* and it was nighttime, when I saw a face outside my windows, I felt shocked, thankfully I managed to get whatever that shit was down. *sips coffee*

Unfortunately, that wasn’t a monster or an illusion, it was a little piece of shit, or as your type might call it, a kid. *laughs*

Now, I panicked if that wasn’t obvious. *laughs* I tried to hide the body! *HAHAHAHA* Wasn’t that punchline awesome?

But, there was a small problem, a teeny, tiny problem. There was a witness. In my panicked state, I got a blunt object and murdered him.

I didn’t know what to do, I panicked and murdered in the heat of the moment, I never wanted to kill. 

I buried both the bodies in the backyard of my neighbor, unfortunately there was another witness who I never noticed.

The witness is blackmailing me currently, and if I don’t do what he says, he ruins my life. *sips coffee*

Such a funny joke by him, getting blackmailed by your type of people, IM THE SMARTEST, I REACHED DIMENSIONS. IM A FUCKING GOD YOU WEAKLINGS. *smashes cup on table*

Well, here I am, no coffee, and getting blackmailed by your type of people.

What a shame right? I wasn’t gonna let myself get blackmailed by your type of people.

I used my brainpower to read his every second in his life. And I discovered something amazingly shocking!

He is an escaped prisoner, who shockingly enough, a very wanted man! *laughs*

I burned his throat and called the police. Now he got caught and can’t snitch to the police! 

Im free again, or was I? I was challenged by god himself, I thought he was smart, didn’t he know I transcended above him and was a being 10000x more powerful than him.

With the snap of my fingers, he disappeared with no traces. 

I finally had the power to ruin the world, the solar system, and the universe itself!

Now we are back to the new school year, where I lured my enemies to the bathroom and made them have the worst punishment ever.

I lured a girl to witness before murdering here too. It was fun! 

I started luring the worst teachers and murdering them too.

I then disappeared without a trace! *laughs*

Murdering is so fun! I murdered the whole city and the country soon.

The world was starting to extremely panic, countries were on lockdown.

But, didn’t you forget? I managed to get inside another country and murdered it too, I repeated this until the whole continent was gone.

The world was immensely panicking, this is when I bombed the capitals of all countries, sending the world in a war with itself!

I didn’t even have to try! Your type is murdering themselves from the panic! Isn’t that peak stupidity?

The world police was combining together to investigate this case, now that is the smartest thing your type did.

Too bad, the case is not possible to investigate, even after silencing them.

Now, I spread a disease so powerful that it killed your type in less than a second!

And it was incurable, seeing the world trying to get its shit together in the pandemic and a world war was satisfying enough.

But your type unfortunately couldn’t do it, your type was weak. And so, I left the earth after it was silenced.

And that is how I repaired my life.

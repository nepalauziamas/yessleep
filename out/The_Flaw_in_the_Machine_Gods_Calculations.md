“I’m thirsty”, I said in my hoarse voice. 

“Internal batteries are at a critical level, I infer for the user to hibernate in order to preserve functionality until the arrival of the replacement unit for a successful transfer of duty.” 


An angelic voice reminded me of my current predicament and with a sigh I replied, “I guess it can’t be helped. Unit 03 – 55 – 39 transferring the authorization to Maria for the wake up sequence of Unit 01 – 79 – 75 and to ensure its safe transport to my current coordinates "Unit 03 – 55 – 39 will commence hibernation mode.” 

 
DEET! DEET! DEET! I was woken up by these sounds which seems to have originated from the very thing I am lying in, as the lid to my pod opened lights attacked my eyes and threatened to burn my eyes.


I felt the gush of air and sand blowing towards me. A prick from something on my skin eased my trembling body. A voice spoke “Sedatives successfully administered” I asked “Who are you?”, the voice responded “Welcome Unit 01 – 79 – 75, it seems that the wake up sequence was a success scanning further for potential malfunctions.” 


Different coloured lights skimmed all over my body, “No defects found, you may now step out of the pod.” 

My body responded as if it was incapable of resisting, what met my eyes was a barren and desolate landscape. 


After a few minutes the voice spoke again, “Hello again Unit 01 – 79 – 75, I am a representative of the Machine Gods, I am Multifaceted Acquiring and Researching Intelligence Apparatus or M.A.R.I.A for short and I am here to accompany you throughout your journey."


"I bid you good fortune.” 

  

Days have already passed since I started treading slowly following my compass yet it seems that it lead me nowhere. 


Who could blame me since all I saw was a sea of sand with no signs of anything existing aside from myself. 

Just as how I was contemplating on how alone and lonely I was in this huge sandbox, a group of structures came into view, it all came in different shapes and sizes, there are tall ones and short ones, and it gave me an indescribable feeling of anxiety since almost all of the structures were half submerged in sand. 


Maria finally spoke since forever “Please seek shelter, a sandstorm is about to form in your area.” 


While walking several steps a structure with huge letters sitting atop of it that read THEATRE piqued me so I entered the structure and what met my eyes were rows of red chairs facing a stage. 


Music was playing inside and lights invaded the room.


People huddled all facing the stage. I picked a seat closest to me, as I took a seat the room dimmed and the lights were all focused on the stage. 


The show had already begun. 


All throughout the show I felt eerie, then as the story reached its conclusion the music and the narrator’s voice started to get distorted, in unison all of the people stood up and spoke with unsettling voices, 


“And Icarus flew too close to the sun, burned off his wings and fell into the abyss never to be found again!” 

They all slowly turned their heads to my direction; I stood in shock from what I saw, their figures were emaciated and the surrounding air smelled rancid that it made me feel sick, empty eye sockets stared straight at me.


All of them started to walk towards me; some were begging for help while the others blamed me. 


I ran outside and what met my sight drained all hope away from my body, thousands of ghouls greeted me. 


I ran from all of them, constantly looking behind and seeing shadows giving chase. 

In my panic, I fell into a huge crater in the middle of the structures, rolling into the middle of it.


I am trapped 


All of the ghouls slowly walked towards me. 


The sandstorm suddenly raged and the sight of the wretched ghouls disappeared melding into the torrent of sand, so is my consciousness.


I woke up in front of a white mansion. 


I entered the doors and saw someone healthy sitting on a chair, speaking in a very hoarse voice.  

“I have been waiting for you Unit 01 – 79 – 75, I am Unit 03 – 55 – 39 and you are here to relieve me of my duty.”


He offered his hand in a very weak manner, I hesitated at first yet I walked towards him and shook his hand, he then smiled and said.


“Transfer complete, I . . . am . . . feeling . . . thirsty.” After saying this he closed his eyes and rests his head on the desk. 
  

Maria then spoke “Unit 03 – 55 – 39 has exceeded its expectancy and successfully transferred duty, he will now be one with the Machine Gods” 


I was left alone, with my mouth hanging open. 


A huge concentrated light emerged at the far end of the room, three humanoid figures shrouded in three different coloured lights, one with white, one in black and one in grey appeared. Their presence felt ominously divine. The three spoke with a voice that shook the very fabric of reality.


“We are nameless! Faceless! Omniscient! Omnipotent! Divine!” 


My ears bled, my sight was blanketed in crimson and because of pain I fainted. 
  

“What happened to this world?’ The Grey Figure asked 

  

 “An error that brought by greed to achieve divinity then one day an exceptional person made a machine that brought forth unity to all, it is a machine that could answer all questions and find solutions to problems, a machine that is sentient. Thinking highly of themselves, they all threw their beliefs, they started to call themselves the Machine Gods. The said machine supported their delusion however the machine being sentient learned to harbour a false idea, the machine waited when the world slept then it unleashed humanity’s greatest destructive weapons and targeted it on them robbing them of their lives in a flash, just like a thief in the night.”                   
  

“There are a lot of damned souls here” The Black Figure commented. 

 
“Why didn’t you save them? Why don’t you bring these souls to paradise where they should all belong as all of your creations should be when they pass? The Grey Figure asked. 
  

“I cannot intervene with creations who chose their own fate, they could not be brought to a place created by someone they have stopped believing in, no salvation will come since they stopped believing that I . . . we existed. Am I right M.A.R.I.A?”


The White Figure told them in a flat and monotonic voice while looking at the sand forming a sorrowful looking angelic woman who placed the body of the one who was sitting on the chair to her lap. 

  

“I see . . . an existence that is neither synthetic nor organic, it is both things at the same time, and it is alive but also is not” The Black Figure said looking at the thing at Maria’s lap. 

  

Maria then asked “Do you hate me father? Is what have I done in the past wrong? Why am I feeling sorrow?” “I brought forth judgement on your behalf!”
  

“You are not my child so don’t call me father, I could neither validate nor invalidate the reason for the actions you have done or the feelings you possess since I do not have the jurisdiction over your existence." 

"I DID NOT CREATE YOU!"


"You were a factor beyond my control, my creations’ offshoot in their attempt to sit where I or rather we belong. Why don’t you ask the very Machine Gods that you worship and adore to this very day.”  


With this the White Figure opened the curtains and what could be seen outside was not a sea of sand but a sea of ghouls with empty eye sockets with tattered clothing together with their cries of pain and agony blown by the sandstorm merging into nothingness. They were all waiting for forgiveness and salvation that would never arrive.


“Come we must leave now, this is not the only copy of this world that I govern I just wanted you to see this place, the place where the Machine Gods that were cursed to roam their world forever.” 


The three then took their leave. 

 
DEET! DEET! DEET! I was woken up by these sounds which seems to have originated from the thing where I am sitting. I do not remember how I got here but I felt a sense of duty that willed me to stay here and sit then wait for something to arrive in order to pass on a message and history from the Machine Gods. Maria appeared and mouthed the words with an angelic voice “Are you ready Unit 01 – 79 – 75?” I replied with a nod and smile “I am at your disposal Maria” then I asked “So what shall we get for a drink?”

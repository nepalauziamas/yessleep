I want to start this off by saying this is a completely true story. I can not stop thinking about this event so I thought I would share it with you all.

about two nights ago I was sleeping peacefully next to my partner in his bed. I was staying the night as he lives quite the distance away from me. I was in a deep sleep when I was awoken by my partner shaking my left arm violently and telling me to wake up. At first I was quite angry at being disturbed and looked up at my partner angrily. this anger quickly turned into concern as I saw that my boyfriend was wide-eyed with tears streaming down his face. he looked absolutely terrified.

"babe look" 

He said not breaking his gaze from whatever it was he was looking at. at this point I wasn't fully awake and was very confused. I didn't respond instead I just kept looking at him and leaned in towards his face. I put my hand on his check and observed how scared he looked still trying to process what he had just said to me.

"babe"

he said still fixated on whatever it was he was looking at.

"what's wrong"

I asked still very confused. it was at this point that the hairs on my body started to stand up as I felt as though someone or something was staring straight at us, it was the same feeling you get when you can feel someone staring at the back of your head when your out in public. 

"babe"

he said as new tears streamed down his face and the look of unfiltered terror on his face worsened. 

"yes love what's wrong?"

I replied trying to sound calm for his sake but inside I could feel the fear becoming more prominent in my mind as I was starting to realise the seriousness of the situation at hand.

"there's something in the corner of the room"

he said in a hushed tone as if he was trying not to alert whatever it was in the corner of the room too our presence. at this point my partner was shaking violently and had started sobbing quietly as I sat there unable to move. I was paralysed almost. all my muscles had tensed and every hair on my body was standing straight up, the goosebumps covering my body were so prominent it was almost painful, like I was standing in the middle of a snow storm with clothes unfit for the weather. 

once I had regained control of my body I started to lay back down and once my head hit the pillow I turned to my partner and said

"babe you're probably just seeing things. just go back to sleep."

he didn't move an inch. he had stopped crying and was now just hypnotically staring at the corner of the room, unblinking. I still had not looked at whatever was there and against my better judgment I slowly turned my head towards the direction he was staring. it took only a couple of seconds for my eyes to adjust. 

there appeared to be nothing there. but I could feel the presence of something sinister. I could feeling staring right at me. like it had laser vision and was searing my eyes with its own. I was stuck like that for a minute just staring into the black abyss in the corner of the room. I broke the trance I was in and quickly turned around face my boyfriend who was peacefully asleep facing me. his face was still wet from the tears but he looked like he had been sleeping undisturbed for hours.

I sat there looking at him with complete shock. how could go from so terrified and crying to asleep in to what felt like to me, only a minute? it took me about 20 minutes but I too soon drifted off to sleep but that feeling of being stared at never left me.

&#x200B;

in the morning I awoke to my boyfriend kissing my forehead and saying good morning. I was quick to mention the events of the previous night to him but he claimed to have no recollection of what transpired, what I'm assuming to be just a few hours ago. to be completely honest I had no idea what time it was I just remember getting a glimpse of the night sky through the mostly closed blinds, it was a purplish-blueish colour. my partner continued to deny any memory of the night and I gave up on trying to get him to remember. I explained to him what had happened and he seemed honestly scared. he proceeded to tell my he has never sleep talked or walked in his life which made what happened all the more terrifying. he asked me if I might of been dreaming but I recounted the moment he woke me up and how violently he shook me, the feeling of being stared at and feeling his tears on his face when I touched him. needless to say we are both throughly freak the fuck out and I've been unable to stop thinking about that night. every time the thought pops into my head I get a shiver down my spine and goosebumps all over my body. 

I wanted to share this story with all of you lovers of horror and all things terrifying as I thought it might interest you and maybe even scare you, assuming that's what you're here for. I hope enjoyed this as I know I fucking didn't but never the less, thanks for reading!

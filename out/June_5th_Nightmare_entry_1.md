I slept at 4 pm in the afternoon, waking up at 10:36 pm


I have been dreaming about me, i can see myself in third perspective. 

I feel like someone, no it has to be something; 'it' has been eating or rather sucking some kind of energy out of my sleeping body, i can feel it. 

'IT' suffocated me, my head was pounding as if a hydraulic press is on top of me; slowly crushing my skul.

I dreamt of waking up at that dream.

I woke up and tried to leave the room but was halted due to the immense amount of pain i can feel in my head, i was seating on the bed below mine. My family is quite big that's why we had a bunk bed. I sat there briefly and began my desperate attempt to leave the room immediately again; i succeeded.

Me and my younger sister (10 F) was the only person in that room, and i left her there; sleeping.

I made my way to the other room. Fortunately, it's only a hundred steps away from mine. 

I thought that the bunk bed below is empty though i know i should be not since my older brother (17M) sleeps there when my other older brother (20 M) is away.

Still thoughts about that had no space in my head, all that i can think about is stopping this pain and 'It' from eating the energy out of my body. 

I slammed my self below the bed, finding a man's hairy legs before me.  I was confused. 

'who is this? Wh-'

Just before i could finish my thoughts the pain continued again.

My head hurts, it fucking hurts.

Then, i heard a familiar voice. It was my sister (23 F).

She's here! I thought to myself

But then i remembered a memory, she.. she left just the day before this. H-how could she be here..? 

"Babe, who is that? Are you okay?" She said, staring at the owner of those hairy legs that i clung to.

"Babe I'm fine, it's your sister isn't it? Is she alright?" He asked

My sister looked at me, she was confused. I am too.

She looked at me, i did the same. That is my sister's face i thought to myself

Looking beside her, i saw her boyfriend (i don't know his age) 

I glanced at her, once again. She looked... pissed? I was taken back by her reaction.

I quickly tried to go up the bed above them, i found my older brother there (17 M) 

I let out a desperate cry and said "brother! Hurry and help me up!  It's coming!" I shouted at him

Without saying anything, my brother pulled me up and laid me flat on my back. 

I was relieved. It's over! Or so i thought...

I woke up in real life only to find that I'm still  at my room, i begun praying prayers I've never heard before.

I can hear myself praying desperately, only to sleep and dream about my soul getting eaten; again.

The first scenario of my dream ended there. The  second was worse, it was hell.

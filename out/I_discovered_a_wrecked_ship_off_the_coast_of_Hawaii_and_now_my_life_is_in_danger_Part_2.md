I set down the binoculars calmly and stepped outside. I could feel my heart beating rapidly, like it was about to come out of my chest. The man holding the gun was large and burly.

“Bet you thought you were so clever huh? Did you really think we didn’t know what car you drove? Or that we wouldn’t check for suspicious cars parked around the house?”

I didn’t reply, just avoided his icy gaze. He reached up to touch his ear.

“Yeah, I got him. He was sitting in his car on the hill.”

His eyes then fell upon the car behind me.

“Where is the helmet?”

I knew I was defeated. And I didn’t want to risk any consequences of my actions falling on my wife and daughter.

“It’s in the trunk,” I admitted. He stepped past me, opened it up, and pulled the helmet out. Once more he touched his ear.

“I got it, it was in his trunk.”

I noticed the men in my house swiftly exit, get into their car, and drive up the hill.

“I gave you what you wanted, now let me go,” I said to the other man as he examined the helmet closely. I imagined he was trying to see if I had done any damage to it. But when he heard me he just laughed.

“Are you kidding? We offered to do this easy way for you, but you wanted the hard way. Now there will be consequences.”

The SUV pulled up besides my car, and the man opened the door and set the helmet in. He then pulled a pair of handcuffs out. I knew what he wanted me to do and stuck my hand out. For a brief moment I considered trying to run, but that thought faded quickly. It would have been a stupid move that could just result in me being gunned down. I stuck my hands out and he quickly cuffed them before ordering me into the back seat. There I sat next to another man, an equally huge guy who wore a black beard and stared ahead with a dead look in his eyes. Once the man who had handcuffed me got in the car, we began to drive off, and in the direction of downtown. I assumed I was under arrest, but noticed they hadn’t read me my Miranda rights like they were supposed. I thought about saying something or at least asking where they were gonna take me, but kept my mouth shut for now. The other men didn’t talk either so I was left to speculate who they really were. My best guess was the FBI. And that the helmet I had taken was some part of a prototype suit or armor, and that someone had taken it from them and was on the run. I couldn’t understand why they cared about the map though and hoped Nathan wasn’t in any serious trouble. I had good money and could probably afford a good lawyer, but I was already worrying about how much punishment I would face. I figured surely my lawyer could use the fact that they didn’t even disclose who they really were to my advantage. I was just a guy who found a cool helmet. And I did my duty as a good person to even report the shipwreck. But when the SUV slowed down and turned down a dark ally, I began to worry again.

“Hey, what the… Where are you taking me? Shouldn’t I be going to the police station?”

The SUV stopped in front of a decrepit warehouse, and the other men got out.

“Who are you guys? What you’re doing isn’t right, I didn’t know who you were,”

“Shut up and stop whining. We aren’t going to kill you. We’re with the government as you already knew. Someone just wants to talk to you,” he said and they all walked into the warehouse. I reluctantly followed. There was one man standing inside, someone I had already met. The Chapman guy from lunch. When he saw me in cuffs, he raked the other guys with a furious gaze.

“What are you doing Greg? Did you threaten him? Hurt him in any way?”

“No sir,” the guy who I presumed to be Cooper responded. He was the same one who had first confronted me at the car.

“Uncuff him right now!” Chapman demanded. Greg pulled the key out of his suit pocket and complied with Chapman’s orders. Once I was out of the cuffs, I began talking.

“Alright, you got your helmet back. Now can you please let me go? I’m sorry I took it, I had no clue It was something that important. And I fully intended to return it in a few days, I just wanted to study it for a little bit.”

“Mr. Tupoula, please. Let me be the one to apologize. We didn’t mean to come off as so intimidating here, we didn’t want to scare you.”

He had taken on a calmer demeanor to address me.

“Scare me? Your guy here pointed his gun at me.”

“Is that true Greg?”

He narrowed his eyes at him.

“But… sir…”

“I don’t want to hear it. In fact, I think Mr. Tupoula here is owed an explanation.”

He then turned to look at me. I could feel my heart beating fast, but I didn’t say anything.

“Earlier at the lunch, I think my friend and I came off as too threatening and rude. I wasn’t lying, about being part of the government. But you see if I told you the name of our organization, well you wouldn’t believe me. You see we aren’t FBI, CIA, NSA… No we work in developing technologically. Technology for our military in fact. So you can see why we were all so worked up. And I won’t lie to you anymore. That helmet you have? It’s part of the advanced diving suit we’ve been working on. What happened was one of our men, tried to take the suit and sell it on some black market. We had no clue where he was heading, but I can see now he must have gotten caught up in some terrible storm and shipwrecked.”

“Ok, well you can have the helmet back. I didn’t know what I had come across. I just want my family to be OK, and Nathan too.”

“Your family and friends are both safe. We just told Nathan not to contact you in case you decided to flee. But he doesn’t know what you know. You are kinda famous, aren’t you? Former Olympic gold medalist? Run a diving company now?”

I felt the heat of embarrassment rise into me. Even to this day I still didn’t like all the attention that came with all that. I was however more relaxed about my situation. I didn’t think they were gonna harm me or the people I cared about now. I shook my head yes.

“Well you see that’s why I wanted to talk to you again, why we didn’t just take the helmet. I want you to test our new suit, in fact, I think you’re more qualified than most of the people we’ve had testing it.”

With this Chapman gave me an almost goofy smile.

“That’s a very big honor sir, but I think I’m gonna have to pass. I gotta stay with my family. You know I have a newborn baby and everything. She requires my constant care.”

“Mr. Toupula, it will only be for a few days. There are two diving sites we have in the Indian Ocean. We will pay for the whole trip, and give you a lot of extra money to for your time.”

“Thanks but I really don’t need it.”

“We know you do Mr. Tuoupola, we checked.”

I looked down. He was right. Ever since the shark attack, I had been on a steady decline of customers and losing money. People were too scared now, even though it was incredibly rare. Also, I couldn’t lie to myself. Now that I knew it was truly part of a diving suit, my curiosity had been piqued. And I had been really bored for a long time. Finding that ship, was the most interesting thing to happen in my life since Faith had been born.

“How much money?” I asked. Instantly Chapman reached into his pocket and pulled out a check. There was just enough light in the dimly lit warehouse to make out the numbers. A number that was seven digits. My eyes widened. This could change everything for me, my family, and my business. I was never good at hiding my emotions, and Chapman could pick that up.

“I assume that’s going to be yes. But of course, you would have to never tell anyone about this. And I assume you haven’t told your wife yet right?”

I shook my head no.

“What about Nathan though?” I asked. He had already seen the helmet and knew my theory about it being connected to a larger diving suit.

“Nathan has been told the truth and knows your offer. We know he has some diving experience, but we know that you are a much better diver than he is. He has been compensated for his silence, same as you.”

I took a few seconds before giving him my final answer. I knew I couldn’t resist.

“Alright, I’m in.”

Chapman smiled once more.

“Good, we’re leaving tomorrow. Meet us at the airport at 8 A.M. sharp. Your money will be given to you after the trip.”

With that Chapman and his men began to walk out of the warehouse.

“Wait? What will I tell my wife?”

“That’s on you to decide,” Chapman called back as they all got into the SUV and drove off. I was now left standing alone. I looked around, making sure they hadn’t left me with someone who was gonna finish me off. These men were still suspicious, but the rational part of my brain told me if they were gonna get rid of me, they would have done it by now. So I stumbled out of the warehouse, and down the alley. Downtown was not as crowded as this time of night, but taxis were still running, usually for drunks. If I had my phone with me I would have just called an Uber, but I had left it in my car. When I finally got home, I spent most of the rest of the night checking my house for missing items. Luckily they had been gentle when they searched my house and didn’t make much of a mess. I wasn’t tired, as adrenaline was still pumping through my veins.

And I couldn’t decide what to tell Lilly yet. I imagined they had tapped all my phones, but telling her the truth was stupid anyway. I spent the entire rest of the night awake, rolling around in bed and thinking of excuses. When I saw light creeping through my windows, I got up and began packing. I figured we would be going somewhere warm, like maybe a coral reef. So I packed warm clothing. Around 8 my adrenaline had worn off and I was starting to feel really tired. I took an hour-long nap and woke up at 9. Now was the moment I was dreading, the phone call I was gonna have to make. After drinking a lot of coffee and eating breakfast, I decided I had an explanation. So I called her. She answered right away.

“Oh thank God, I was just about to call you? Is everything alright?”

“Yes yes, it was just a false alarm. You and Faith should be fine to return to the house today.”

“Oh good, I’ll make up a big breakfast for us. We can put on a good comedy too, something to destress. Maybe like The Proposal? Game Night?”

“Lilly, I won’t be here.”

“What?”

I hesitated a bit before going on. I knew what I was about to say was very dangerous.

“I have to come right out and apologize honey. I lied to you yesterday. The men yesterday were not some criminals. Uh, in fact, they were lawyers?”

“Lawyers? What do they want with you?”

“Remember Allan Fitzgerald? The guy who got attacked by a shark on my dive?”

“Yes, but don’t your clients sign a waiver thought?”

“They do, but clearly he still wants to try to sue me. I gotta fly to San Diego and take care of this.”

“San Diego? You can’t just do this all over the phone?”

“You know I can’t Lilly, especially not over something this bad. And I gotta fly out right now. It’ll only take three days though.”

“I really don’t appreciate you lying to me about this, getting me all worked up. You know I barely got any sleep right last night right Sione?”

“I know and I’m sorry. I’ll make it up to you I swear. I just didn’t wanna get you all worried about it until I felt better about it all.”

“It’s fine Sione, I forgive you. Just please don’t do something like this ever again.”

“I won’t, I won’t. I need to go ahead and get going, gotta be at the airport by Ten.”

“You think he’ll actually be able to screw you over with this?”

“No, no. But I still feel horrible about it happening. I think maybe I can work something out to avoid all this trouble.”

“Ok, good luck Sione.”

“Thank you, and I love you.”

“I love you too.”

With that, I swiftly hung up the phone. Every lie that had come out of my mouth in that conversation stung me like a bad jellyfish. But I couldn’t get caught up on it. I cleaned up my breakfast, finished packing, shut down the house, and hit the road. I considered leaving my phone at the house, but I figured I might be able to talk Chapman into letting me keep it. I don’t know how he did it, but as soon as I arrived at our airport Chapman found me. I had taken an uber to the airport so I didn’t have to worry about leaving my car there, but Chapman said he would have paid for that. He seemed oddly friendly too now, but I still trusted him. As I expected, we loaded up into a private jet. It hadn’t been my first time in one, but it always felt weird to me. It was all white with pretty much no markings, and a beige interior.

“So where are we going?” I asked as I sat down next to him. I didn’t see any of the men from the warehouse on the plane, it was just me and him.

“Madagascar,” he simply replied.

“Oh really? I’ve only been to Africa once, but I remember watching this great documentary on Madagascar once. Hopefully, we’ll get to see those weird Baobab trees.”

“Sorry, Sione… You mind if I just call you Sione?”

“Sure.”

“We won’t, we’re going straight to the boat.”

“Ahhh, maybe there are some around the coast?”

“There isn’t, hate to break it to you.”

Most of the flight was pretty quiet, as Chapman pulled out his laptop and began going through stuff I imagined I would get in trouble for looking at. I instead watched movies on the little tv they had. But the entire time, I was in a rush of different emotions. Excitement to try this suit out, but guilt and shame for lying to my wife. My mind also wondered about Chapman and the suit. Like everyone I had heard government conspiracies before, stuff like the Illuminati and such. But now I mostly thought about the conspiracies I had heard in my life surrounding Area 51. People often said it was a place of government test sites, somewhere to test out advanced weaponry. I had always thought that kind of stuff was stupid, but now I wondered how much of that was really true. The flight itself took about a day, and I fell asleep before we landed.

“Wake up, we’re here,” I heard Chapman’s voice in my ear. I woke up to see that the plane was completely still now, and sitting on concrete. I had been so tired I must have slept through the landing. It made sense with how little sleep I got the night before. I got up and stretched my legs, my stomach rumbling. But my biggest worry was the long time I had gone without cell service. I pulled my phone out quickly. As I had expected, I had five missed calls and four texts from my wife. The first few phones were just asking if I had landed safely, then the following messages were filled with concern over me not answering. I typed a quick reply, noticing I had barely any service.

*Sorry Lilly, I haven’t been on my phone much, these lawyers haven’t really left me alone. I won’t be able to be on my phone really during this trip, but I did land safely*

I typed fast and sent the message, but Chapman still noticed.

“What are you thinking? Bringing your phone here?”

He said and snatched it out of my hand.

“Look, my wife thinks I’m in San Diego dealing with some lawsuit. If I go dark…”

“I know what you told your wife, but I still can’t risk you slipping up, or your phone being trapped. I’m sorry again, but I’m gonna have to get rid of this.”

He stepped out onto the staircase and dropped the phone facedown. It fell for a few seconds before hitting the concrete with a loud *SMACK.* I cringed and looked at Chapman. 

“Hey man, couldn’t you have just shut it off and kept it yourself?”

“That still wouldn’t stop it from being tracked if she really wanted it to be. We’ll get you a new phone, a better phone. Don’t worry about going dark either. We have someone in San Diego who is already gonna pose as a lawyer for your wife. He’ll explain you broke your phone and whatnot, and that you’re too busy to talk.”

“You guys really do think of everything.”

“Come on, we’re in a rush,” Chapman urged me as he headed out of the plane. I grabbed a bag of pretzels and a water bottle on the way out. Sitting at the bottom of the stairs leading down from the plane was an old grey Hummer. The driver of it looked American, and he was the only one in the car. But as I took a closer look, I recognized it as Greg. 

As soon as Chapman and I got in, we were speeding off from the airport. I wasn’t too mad about the phone, as I had everything backed up on it anyway. I was a little worried about his cover story for Lilly, as I wasn’t sure she would buy it On the way out of the airport and to the boat, we drove through an incredibly poor city. I had been to third-world countries before a few times. Three times I had taken a missionary trip down to Venezuela. No matter how many times I went seeing how these people in these countries lived always struck me with pain. At least on the missionary trips, I was there to help, but this time I was just here for a selfish reason.

“Where are we? Is this the capital?” I finally spoke as I looked out of the window.

“Mhm, Antananarivo. We landed at Ivato Airport. It shouldn’t be long before we’re at the coast.”

A million questions ran through my mind, but I knew he wouldn’t answer most. I still asked one, however. One I wanted to ask earlier but didn’t.

“Why uh did we fly all the way out here? Madagascar?” I said. I was sitting in the back but now looking directly ahead at Chapman, who was sitting in front of me. He answered quickly, like he had been prepared and waiting on the question.

“This is gonna be a field test, it’s why I wanted you. There are two recently sunken cargo ships in the Indian Ocean. Sunken by pirates. Fortunately, they haven’t figured out how to get down there to get the precious cargo we need to recover. It’s a perfect job for us.”

“Y’all don’t have guys for that? Like the SEALs right?”

“We don’t think there will be any threat to us. The pirates who sunk it have abandoned the wreckage and we haven’t seen them in the waters around it for months.”

I felt a jolt forward as Greg slammed on the brakes, and looked forward to see a group of kids running out into the street chasing a soccer ball.

“This place is such a shithole, and all these people are too. Damn idiots who won’t hesitate to rob you blind,” the driver mumbled under his breath. Chapman raked him with a disappointed glare.

“Hey, why don’t you show some respect to these people? They can’t help where they are,” Chapman snapped at him. The driver didn’t say anything for the rest of the ride. It took a little over an hour to get to the coast, and the drive was mostly jungle like I had expected. I did however see a few of those towering Baobab trees, so I guess Chapman had been wrong. At the coast, we arrived at a small village, one that was even poorer than the capital. The roads were mud, the shacks were falling apart. I only noticed one car, and it was broken down and without wheels. The only building that looked remotely in tact really was a grey brick building. It had a steeple and even a few stained-glass windows. I assumed it was a church, but didn’t see a cross on the steeple. The docks were in shambles, except for one. There were a few small fishing boats attached to it, and another much larger boat that I could easily tell would be the one we were taking. It was a large white yacht-looking boat, probably around a hundred feet or so. The dock it sat on was the longest one, and it still took up the entire side. I noticed a probably twenty-foot-long submarine attached to the side of it, and giant cranes holding it. I imagined these cranes were used to pick it up and drop it in the water. The side read *S.S. Santo*. Compared to everything around it, it was like a pearl in a pile of garbage. The locals of the village were all gathered around the front of the dock, blocking the entrance. I noticed several men on our ship looking down at them.

“Park by that hut,” Chapman ordered Greg. He complied and shut the car off. There were four other identical Hummers by the hut also, which was next to the big dock.

“You two stay in here for a second, I’m gonna see what’s going on,” he said and got out of the car, carrying a concerned look on his face. I waited till he had walked a good bit away from the car to talk to Greg.

“Do you know what’s going on? Are they mad that we’re here?” I asked as I leaned forward to him. Greg chuckled before pulling out a cigarette. He rolled down the window and lit it, blowing the smoke out. With the window open I could hear the crowd mumbling loudly, but didn’t understand anything they were saying. The driver chuckled once more before talking.

“Nah man, these freaks don’t give a shit that we’re here. Chapman gave them a lot of money, but they probably don’t know what to do with it anyway. He has been pretty charitable to this village, but I think that’s a lost cause if you ask me.”

I didn’t like his disrespectful attitude, or the actions he had done to me the other night, but I was curious about the villagers. So I kept asking. As I intentionally stared at the crowd, I noticed something else, something that looked like a coffin that they were carrying to the edge of the dock. Chapman looked like he was trying to talk to one of them, but they were ignoring him.

“Why?”

“I think like two of the villagers here speak English. Bad English, but still English. And since my job is to stay here the whole time, I got bored and talked to them. They got some weird ass beliefs. See that coffin they’re carrying to the water? Well, they dump all their dead into the ocean. Because apparently when they do that, the dead still sings to them at night from it.”

“Hmmm,” I simply replied. I watched as they reached the edge of the dock and tossed the coffin in. Next, they got on their knees. From this far away, I couldn’t hear if they were saying anything still, or just sitting in silence. Chapman had given up on talking to them and made his way up onto the boat.

“So can we go now?” I asked Greg, who seemed to be lost in his own thoughts. I could feel the pressure in my bladder building and realized I hadn’t gone to the bathroom since the plane ride.

“No, he’s probably clearing some shit up on the boat. They’re really weird about everything, he’ll probably want you to see no one else when you go on board.”

“Well I gotta use the bathroom really bad, so I’m getting out.”

“Do whatever you want, just don’t go mingling,” he replied. I got out of the car and scanned the village for anything that looked like a restaurant or somewhere with a bathroom. Of course, I didn’t wanna just barge into someone’s house, or pee on the side of the road. The only building that I thought may have somewhere public was the grey-bricked church, so I began walking in that direction. My feet made gross noises as they tracked through the wet mud, and the sneakers I had worn were quickly covered in it. I looked back one more time before stepping into the building and noticed Greg wasn’t even paying attention to me. He was watching the villager’s burial. The inside of the building, well it did look like a church too. There were pews and an altar at the front. I didn’t expect anyone to be in it because of the funeral-type event going on, and I was right. Being a religious person I thought this might be a chance to maybe meet an English-speaking villager, and ask him about Chapman and the others. I didn’t see any crosses or bibles or anything that resembled Christianity. The stained glass windows all had the same image. Some tall and skinny cloaked figure. You couldn’t see its body, face, or anything besides a pair of wide black wings that stuck out from behind them. The cloak too looked like it was almost meant to be water of some sort. My first thought was that maybe it was some weird depiction of an angel, but I had never seen one depicted like that before.

*Maybe this isn’t a Christian church at all? But some other religion?*

I wasn’t too familiar with Africa’s primary religion and considering prying a little bit. But I didn’t wanna get in any trouble and quickly brushed that urge away. I did find it very odd that a poor village like this would be able to afford such quality stained glass windows. The building was only one room, so I didn’t see a bathroom. I did however see a door by the altar and followed it out behind the building. There I found two outhouses and promptly used the guy’s one. The bathroom was no more than a giant hole in the ground and was one of the worst-smelling things I had ever experienced. I finished quickly and walked back to the building. When I went back inside, however, I found company. A very old hunched-over woman and three men. As soon as she saw me, she pointed her crooked finger at me and begin yelling rapidly. I threw my hands up and pleaded.

“Hey, I was just using the bathroom.”

They ignored me and the two men grabbed me roughly. I began to squirm back, but I wasn’t a very strong person myself. And these people felt surprisingly strong for being skinny. The woman continued to yell at me as they dragged me out of the building and into the street. This caught the attention of Greg, who jumped out of the Hummer. He quickly put his hand on his holstered pistol and began yelling at the villagers.

“Hey let him go right now! I swear to God! Let him go!” He yelled over and over again. I was worried I had set off a chain of events, and Chapman, who had been standing on the boat’s deck, quickly noticed. He turned and said something to the man next to him, and quickly ran down from the dock. The people at the funeral didn’t even seem to acknowledge what was happening, as they just continued to sit on their knees and face the water. Chapman quickly sprinted over to us right as Greg pulled his pistol out and began to slowly lift it up.

“I’m not gonna warn you again! Let him go or I will open fire!”

“Hey! Put the gun down!” Chapman yelled at him, grabbing his arm and forcing it down. Greg complied and next Chapman was speaking to them quickly. He sounded almost fluent in their language. The old lady wobbled up to him, and they talked back and forth for about a minute. The entire time the men held me still. I didn’t see any weapons on them, so I didn’t know what they were gonna do with me. Chapman and the old lady’s conversation sounded intense, but they finally seemed to settle down. At last, the old lady looked to the men, said a single word, and they all let me go. I stepped forward and to Chapman.

“You should have stayed in the truck,” he said to me solemnly. I could sense the disappointment in his voice.

“I’m sorry, I had to use the bathroom. I didn’t know they were so sensitive.”

“Well, now we’re gonna have to go early. Let’s go, Greg,” He said to him. His eyes darted back to the Hummer and then to Chapman rapidly.

“But sir, the other guys aren’t here yet. If we just leave the cars here these people could seriously mess it up.”

“It won’t be safe for any of us to be here now, I’m gonna call the other team off.”

“Yes Sir.”

Greg made sure to roll the window up before we left the car behind. When I went to pick up my bag in the backseat, Greg grabbed it from me.

“Gotta make sure you got no contraband,” he said unzipping it. I sighed with frustration, stepping back. He went through it quickly and rezipped everything back up. I noticed the old women and those other men staring us down with icy gazes as made our way to the boat. But none of them tried to do anything. The other people who were on the deck had disappeared from it by the time we got up the ramp.

“Ok Sione, I’m gonna take you to your room. It is very important that you do not leave this room the entire trip. If you do so, I’ll have to send you home early.”

“I understand.”

Greg headed off in another direction as Chapman lead me into the cabin and down a set of stairs. The inside was luxurious and looked like a yacht outfitted with military equipment and computers. I looked around to see if I could catch a glimpse of the suit, but didn’t see it. I didn’t take long for us to reach a dark oak hallway, where we stopped at a door.

“Ok Sione, this is your room. Our first drop will be in probably around thirty minutes, as the first shipwreck isn’t that far off. Your roommate’s name is Jin Devi. Do not leave the room until I come back and get you,” He instructed me. I nodded and he knocked on the door, waited a few seconds, and opened it. The room was small, it contained a bunk bed, desk, small closet, and small bathroom. Laying down on the top bunk was a small Asian man. He was wearing headphones and working on what looked like a sudoku puzzle book. His music was so loud, and I could tell it was some sort of heavy metal. When he eyed us he took off his headphones and rolled over to face us. He was also wearing very thick-rimmed glasses.

“Jin, this is your roommate Sione Tupoula. He is a former Olympic diver and will also be testing out the new suit on this journey.”

Jin just gave me an awkward stare, and then hastily put his headphones back on.

“Well I’ll be back shortly,” Chapman said and left the room, not seeming to want to stick around and deal with the awkward vibes.

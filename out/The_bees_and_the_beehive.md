There comes a time when our innocence comes crashing down like a fallen star within our galaxy. Be it young or old, It'll happen eventually... even if you don't want it to.

My childhood wasn't the greatest, It was never picture perfect like those you would see on TV, like those in comfortable homes in safe, secure neighborhoods. Mine was broken, empty and neglected.. A torn up family. I was always jealous of those who got what they wanted, got tucked into their beds by their parents with a kiss on the forehead wishing them sweet dreams with a smile as they left their room. I knew I'd never have it, It never mattered and I've known my whole life that I don't have the right to verbalize such "petty" things. Life wasn't for me.

"Time flies when you're having fun." Is a fairly common metaphor that personally, I've never understood. What was fun about time..? It feels so slow and empty like silent wind flowing through my hair. 

Growing up wasn't in my favor as s grew up too fast, too young. The bees wanted me for my pollen, by body. Bruises, hand marks on every inch of my limbs that wouldn't be visible besides my neck. Oh my poor neck looked like I tried to hang myself a dozen times. I did just that, but it wasnt my own doing, I never gave consent, I didn't have a choice. Those stupid bees, I hated them so. The bitter irony taste in my mouth always made me feel sick, It was always strong and stingy. Why does that happen? 

I started school, It felt so weird, I felt so out of place that day. Wearing a scarf in the late summer with groggy, empty eyes. I'm sure I looked strange to many of my peers. They batted an eye and quickly looked away. I didn't mind though, they wouldn't get to have a close look at what the bees had done to me. 

The bees did this to me.
Why would they do this to me?
What did I do for them to hate me so?

Do they do this for fun? What's the thrill, why do they look so joyous when they sting me all over. Its itchy, I've never liked the feeling. Am I supposed to like it? I don't want to like it. Those stupid bees.

Either way, I'm glad it's finally going to stop. They can't harm my anymore. I found a way to make it all stop. I found a way to protect my body. I found a way to feel at peace, to feel where I belong. I'm so impatient as I want it to happen right now, my head stings and I feel dizzy. Like a milkyway.

It seemed a bit too slow but they were right, time does fly when your'e having fun. I'm safe now, I'm proud. I'm so glad, I'm so so glad that they can't sting me anymore. They wont take whats mine. I can rest assured that down here, I'll be safe from the bees and that so called behive.

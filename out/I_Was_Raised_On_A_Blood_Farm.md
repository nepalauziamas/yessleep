For as long as I can remember, my Mother and I lived in apartment 112 at 1462 West Park Road. 

&#x200B;

I don’t remember anything before that. I don’t remember anything else being home. Just that run down apartment building with its bare concrete walls. The building always looked as if it was either still under construction or a few days away from being torn down. Looking back, I’m surprised that anyone was allowed to live there given in the state that it was in, although at the same time I suspect that technically nobody was supposed to be living there. It’s just that nobody ever really did anything about it. 

&#x200B;

We weren’t squatters. We paid rent to the buildings owner. But given that we never had that much money to pay with, Mr. Konstantin often took *alternative* forms of payment.

&#x200B;

Once or twice a month, he would stop by and talk to my mother. She never let me listen in on these conversations. Whenever he came to our door, she always told me to go and wait in my room, but sometimes I still watched through a crack in the door.

&#x200B;

Mr. Konstantin would always be smiling jovially and laughing at his own jokes. He’d always speak in a calm, relaxed voice… But that never seemed to matter to my Mom. In the end, he almost always ended up having her lead him into her bedroom where they’d remain for at least a couple of hours.

&#x200B;

And when he left, still grinning ear to ear, Mom would quietly drag herself out of the bedroom to the bathroom where she would patch up the wounds on her arms, shoulders and neck. Only when that was done, did she allow me to come out of my room again.

&#x200B;

Oftentimes, Mr. Konstantin wasn’t alone when he stopped by. Sometimes there would be others with him. Some of them I came to recognize over the years, like the man in the black hat with the red band. He was a regular visitor. Others were strangers. They would all go with my mother into her bedroom. Some of them stayed for longer than others, but every one of them left her bleeding.

&#x200B;

I never knew why… I never asked. She never told me. This was just the way things were. 

&#x200B;

When I was very young, I never dared look into the bedroom to see what they were doing to her. The way she sometimes screamed or cried kept me away. But as I got older, I got curious… I had to know what was happening. I had to see.

&#x200B;

I only ever looked once, when I was 11. 

&#x200B;

One of Mr. Konstantin’s friends had stopped by with him that night. The man with the red banded hat. As always, my Mom had sent me into my room and I had listened at the door while they’d spoken in hushed tones.

&#x200B;

 *“My friend has just been dying to see you again…”* Mr. Konstantin had said, “*He always asks about you. When you’ll be available again… Ah, I sometimes wonder if he might not want you all to himself, no?”* He’d laughed before looking over at his friend.

  *“What do you say?”*

&#x200B;

My Mom had struggled to speak. She’d choked on her words. Looking at her, she seemed almost on the verge of tears before she finally settled for just nodding her head. The man in the red banded hat had stood up, before offering my mother his hand.

&#x200B;

 *“Don’t you worry, Amanda. I’ll be gentle…”* He’d whispered to her, before coaxing her towards her bedroom. Mr. Konstantin had watched them go before rising to his feet. He’d followed them across the bare concrete floor into my mothers bedroom and closed the door behind him.

&#x200B;

For a few moments, I’d stared through the crack at my door at the closed door to make sure the coast was clear… Then, slowly I opened the door and crept through the living room. I inched closer to my mothers bedroom door and reached for the knob, turning it as quietly as I could before opening it just a crack. Enough to see…

&#x200B;

The man in the red brimmed hat had pulled the top of my mothers dress down and had buried his teeth into her shoulder. I could hear my mother whimpering in pain… I could see the tears streaming down her cheeks. I covered my mouth to stifle a scream, and watched as the man in the red brimmed hat swallowed down mouthful after mouthful of her blood.

&#x200B;

Mr. Konstantin sat in a nearby chair, taking the occasional drag on a cigarette as he watched the other man bleed my mother dry.

&#x200B;

  *“Not too rough. We’ve had too many losses this year. It’s not good for business.”* He’d said.

*“Ah… Konstantin, when have I ever cost you any blood?”* The man had asked, playfully. *“Don’t you worry. I’m on my best behavior. Promise.”*

Mr. Konstantin just huffed and took another drag on his cigarette. 

&#x200B;

With one last mouthful, the man in the red brimmed hat pushed my mother onto the bed. She curled into a ball, pressing a hand to her bleeding shoulder as the other man began to remove his shirt.

&#x200B;

I wish I could say that was the point when I charged in, defiantly screaming at them not to hurt my mother. But no… I wasn’t that strong. I couldn’t watch any more after that. I couldn’t watch them keep hurting her.

&#x200B;

I closed the door and shuffled back to my room, before hiding under my bedsheets until I finally heard them leave. 

&#x200B;

It was around that time I started noticing the bandages on the other residents of the apartment at West Park Road. Just about everyone had them. Strips of gauze near their necks, or on their arms or shoulders. You didn’t always see them clearly but sometimes you could see the edge of it just under their collars or sleeves, or see the outline of it underneath their clothes.

&#x200B;

I began to realize that what Mr. Konstantin did with my mother wasn’t something unique to her… He did it with everyone in that building. Every single resident. 

&#x200B;

I suppose you might wonder why nobody tried to fight back, or called the police… I did too, for a while. But once I was started understanding the situation I was living in, I started noticing what happened to those who caused any trouble.

&#x200B;

The first one I remember was a man down the hall from us… Rocky.

&#x200B;

Rocky wasn’t that old. Somewhere around middle age, I think. Although he’d clearly lived a hard life. He had a glass eye and several scars on his face. He also seemed to move constantly, as if he was never quite comfortable in any position for long and his hands always seemed to shake. His wife, Tracy was almost always by his side, helping him along. I usually saw the bandages on her… Usually.

&#x200B;

From what I knew, Rocky had once worked a full time job before he had to retire. Something to do with an illness, I think. I never found out the whole story. Mr. Konstantin would visit them every now and again, often bringing some of his ‘friends’ just as he did with my mother.

&#x200B;

One night, we heard an argument from Rocky and Tracy’s apartment… I distinctly remember the sound of Rocky yelling at Mr. Konstantin. I can remember him saying:

&#x200B;

  *“No more, you fucking parasite! I won’t let you do it anymore!”*

I remember hearing Mr. Konstantin laughing in response. 

&#x200B;

Before I could listen in more, I remember that my mother had pulled me out of the hall, just as Mr. Konstantin had started to speak again. I never heard what he said.

&#x200B;

All I know is that the next day, Rocky and Tracy’s apartment was empty and their door was locked. Nobody would talk about them. Nobody would even mention their names. They just pretended as if they didn’t exist anymore… 

&#x200B;

About a month later, someone else moved into that apartment and that was the end of it. 

&#x200B;

I never found out what exactly happened to Rocky and Tracy… But I think it’s safe to assume that neither I, nor anyone else will ever see them again. They weren’t the first people to disappear while I lived in that building. They weren’t the last either.

&#x200B;

I was 16 the first time Mr. Konstantin came for me. 

&#x200B;

I had gotten home from school and was in my room, studying when I heard the telltale knock on the door. I felt a chill run through me as I heard my mother get up to go and answer it.

&#x200B;

  “Hey, hey, hey, Amanda!” I heard Mr. Konstantin say cheerfully, “How are you doing? You doing good? Yeah, you are…”

I could hear footsteps as he let himself in. From the sounds of it, it was just him.

  “The rent isn’t due for another week…” My mother said quietly, “I… I’m not ready yet… I’m still recovering from-”

&#x200B;

Mr. Konstantin shushed her.

  “Now, now. Don’t you worry. I’m not here for you. Okay?”

There was a pregnant silence in the air. I got up from my bed to listen at the door.

&#x200B;

  “No…” My mother said softly, “No, you can’t…”

  “Oh, I can.” Mr. Konstantin replied, “Where is little Eliana? Home?”

  “Please, no… Not her. You can feed from me if you want but not he-”

  “I have clients, Amanda.” Mr. Konstantin interrupted, “Hungry clients… If your little ray of sunshine isn’t going to pay her way, then she doesn’t stay here… Look. I’ve come alone. See? No clients today! Just me.”

  “Please, Mr. Konstantin…” I could hear my mothers voice cracking. She sounded on the edge of tears.

  “No please. Eliana. Now.”

&#x200B;

There was a moment of silence, before I heard my mothers footsteps drawing closer to the door. I took a step back, my heart starting to race as I began to dread what was about to happen.

&#x200B;

Slowly, the door opened and I was greeted by the sight of my mother, her eyes red with the coming tears and a pained look on her face.

&#x200B;

She knew that I’d been listening… The look in my eyes had to give that much away. But it didn’t stop her from saying what she needed to say.

  “Eliana… Mr. Konstantin is here to talk to you.”

&#x200B;

With that, she stepped aside and left me alone with the wolf at my door.

&#x200B;

Mr. Konstantin was a tall, somewhat unkempt man. His hair was long and tied back in a long, ugly braid of dreadlocks. He had a short, scruffy beard and one pale eye that looked blind. His ever present smile lingered on his face when he looked at me, and he stepped into my room without a care in the world.

&#x200B;

  “Hello Eliana…” He said, his voice dripping with honey, “Just the girl I wanted to see…”

I just stared back at him, willing myself to speak but too paralyzed with fear to do so. He didn’t seem to care. He reached out to cup my chin and tilted my head to the side, as if he were examining my neck.

&#x200B;

  “Ah… Youth… Such an invigorating scent.” He noted, before chuckling and leaning in close to me.

  “Be honest, my girl. Do you know why I’m here?”

Slowly, I nodded my head.

  “Good, good… Saves the trouble of explaining it. Makes things so much easier…”

He smoothed down my hair, his touch almost affectionate.

&#x200B;

  “Life is hard. Nothing in this world comes for free. Nothing. But if you know what’s valuable… There’s more than money you can trade. You understand that, don’t you?”

  “Yes…” I said quietly.

  “Good… Good. Now, you’re starting to get all grown up now. So that means you can chip in too. No more free ride… You pay… Just as everyone else pays. But since it’s your first time, I’ll be gentle. Won’t take too much. I’m just sampling the merchandise. All of my clients have very… Particular tastes. Need to make sure it’s all up to par. You understand?”

&#x200B;

I tried to speak but my voice died in my throat. All I could do was weakly nod, but my body was shaking so much. I knew what was coming… And I was more afraid of it than I’d ever feared anything else.

&#x200B;

I expected Mr. Konstantin to sink his teeth into my neck right then and there, but no… He reached for my hand and lifted my arm up. Gently, he rolled up my sleeve and gave me what was supposed to be a comforting smile.

  “Just a little bit of pain.” He promised, “For an easy life… A fair trade, yes?”

I didn’t know what to do other than to nod.

&#x200B;

With that, Mr. Konstantin sank his teeth into my arm.

&#x200B;

The pain made me cry out and pull away, but his iron grip kept me in place.

  “Ah… No, no, no… Not until I’m done…” He hissed. 

&#x200B;

The sight of my blood around his lips made me feel dizzy… I almost felt on the verge of passing out. I could feel my body getting lighter as he drank the blood from my veins and after a few moments, my legs weren’t able to support me any longer. I collapsed.

&#x200B;

Mr. Konstantin kept his grip on my arm, but his other arm shot out to grab me. He laughed, as if this was at all funny.

  “Oh? Can’t handle your first bite?” He teased as he guided me over to my bed and let me crash down onto it.

  “Don’t worry. You’re not the first to faint. Lie back. Rest… Next time will be easier. I promise…”

&#x200B;

My vision felt a little blurry, but Mr. Konstantin was always there. Hanging over me like a cloud. I felt his fingers stroking my cheek and felt my skin crawl.

  “Don’t worry… The rest of it doesn’t hurt so much… And it’ll earn you a little bit of extra money. Just like your lovely mother…”

  “Go away…” I said under my breath, my voice still shaking.

  “Go away?” He repeated, “But I’m not sure I’m done yet… After all, what’s the point in sampling the merchandise if you can’t have dessert too…”

&#x200B;

I could feel his hands on me and felt a cold panic rise in my chest as I realized what he intended to do to me. I was too weak to scream. Too dazed to fight back. For a moment, I felt a horrified certainty about what was going to happen to me… Then I saw movement behind him.

&#x200B;

My mother.  

&#x200B;

I only caught a brief glimpse of the kitchen knife before she drove it into his back. But I saw enough.   
Mr. Konstantin let out a screech of pain and panic. He swept an arm backward, knocking my mother against the wall before leaping to his feet.

&#x200B;

Gritting his teeth in pain, he tore the knife from his body and regarded it with disgust. Then, that look slowly faded into disappointment as he let out a sigh of exasperation.

  “Oh Amanda… Why’d you have to go and do that?” He said.

&#x200B;

My mother stared back at him, fear in her eyes and written all over her face. She knew she’d missed her shot… But she still stared him down. 

  “You don’t touch my daughter…” She said, her voice still weak and trembling, “You can take her blood. But you will not take that.”

&#x200B;

Mr. Konstantin tilted his head to the side, almost as if he were confused.

  “Now you’re giving me orders?” He asked, “Oh Amanda… You of all people should know… I take what I want.”

&#x200B;

With incredible speed, he seized her by the neck and pinned her up against the wall. My mother kicked and thrashed in his grip as he glared at her. She clawed at his face but he barely seemed to react. He just smiled at her as she struggled, almost as if he were watching a show. Then, when at last he seemed bored he leaned in and sank his teeth into her throat.

&#x200B;

My mothers eyes widened in pain. I heard a wet, strangled gasp escape her as blood trickled out of her mouth. Mr. Konstantin bit down hard, sending blood gushing out of the wound in her neck. My mothers struggles grew weaker… And all I could do was watch and sob as the life drained from her eyes, which remained fixated on me as she left this world.

&#x200B;

Mr. Konstantin pulled his head back, leaving a fatal gash in my mothers throat. He sighed, almost in frustration before carelessly hurling her body aside and sending it tumbling to the floor. He rolled his shoulders and cracked his neck… Then at last, he looked back at me.

&#x200B;

  “Nothing in this world comes free…” He said, my mothers blood still smeared around his mouth. I watched as he wiped some it off on his hand. “Everything has its price.”

With that, he gave me one last smile…

Then he left.

&#x200B;

I never got to bury my mother. Her body disappeared while I sat crying in my bedroom. I heard someone come in to take it… But I don’t know where it went. Chances are, I’ll never know.

&#x200B;

Either way, with my mother dead, my life as a human blood bag began.

&#x200B;

Every few weeks, Mr. Konstantin or one of his friends would visit me. The usual one who he brought to me was a man he called ‘Mr. Tupper.’ He was a middle aged man in a well pressed suit, with neatly slicked back hair. In a sense, he was almost completely unremarkable, save for a faded tattoo of some sort of rune between the thumb and index finger. Thankfully, they only took my blood. Nothing else. I suspect Mr. Tupper wasn’t interested in anything else. He was impersonal. Cold. He rarely spoke to me. He mostly only spoke to Mr. Konstantin, who sat patiently and watched as Mr. Tupper drank his fill, then counted his money when he was done.

&#x200B;

Every now and then, Mr. Konstantin would bring somebody else. Usually men, but sometimes they were women. 

&#x200B;

For the next few months, I lived like that… I stopped going to school. Learned to dress my wounds, and spent my days just… Existing. Floating through life as if I was just a ghost, counting the days until Mr. Konstantin finally killed me… Or worse.

&#x200B;

Sometimes I thought about just doing it myself… After all, I was probably just going to end up like my mother. Another corpse in some unmarked grave somewhere. Why wait and suffer through this life for what would probably be years? Nothing would ever change or get better. Why not just end it all… End the pain. Die on my own terms.

&#x200B;

I considered it. 

&#x200B;

I even go so close as to tie a noose out of my bedsheets and loop it around my neck. But in the end… I couldn’t do it.

&#x200B;

I couldn’t take my own life. Not like that, anyways. I knew I was going to die eventually. So I started thinking that if that was the case, why not die trying to kill Mr. Konstantin?

&#x200B;

I started hiding a knife in my bed. In the space between the mattress and the wall. Someplace within arms reach of where Mr. Tupper and Mr. Konstantin usually sat me down for their feedings. I knew it was only a matter of time until they came back… So all I needed to do was wait.

&#x200B;

The day that Mr. Konstantin returned, I was ready.

&#x200B;

I heard the knock on my door and knew what it meant. I sat up on the couch, exhaling a breath that I felt like I’d been holding for over a week. I’d known this was coming… And yet I still felt unprepared. Still, I made myself get up and answer the door. I was greeted by the smiling face of Mr. Konstantin, with Mr. Tupper waiting patiently behind him.

&#x200B;

  “Eliana…” He crooned, going in to kiss me on the cheek, “How good to see you! I’ve brought a friend over, would you be so kind as to invite him in?”

  “Of course…” I said softly, before stepping aside and allowing the vampires into my home.

&#x200B;

Mr. Konstantin came in first, with Mr. Tupper walking behind him, stiff and formal as always.

  “How are you feeling from last time? Rested?” Mr. Konstantin asked, “I hope so. My friend has been so anxious to see you again.”

I looked over at Mr. Tupper. He just stared at me, his expression calm and blank.

&#x200B;

  “I’m sure he has…” I said quietly, before dutifully turning and heading to the bedroom.

  “Oh, you know the drill?” Mr. Konstantin teased, “Such a fast learner.”

He patted Mr. Tupper on the shoulder.

  “Go on. Drink your fill, my friend.”

&#x200B;

I sat on the bed, and pulled my shirt down enough to keep my modesty, while allowing Mr. Tupper the chance to bite my shoulder. He followed me into my bedroom, staring at me blankly before sitting down. I watched as he studied my scarred skin, looking for the ideal place to bite. But he didn’t wait that long.

&#x200B;

I was used to the pain of fangs in my skin, but it still hurt. I knew better than to scream and simply bit my lip to stifle the cry. 

&#x200B;

Mr. Konstantin leaned in the doorway of my bedroom, watching as Mr. Tupper drank with a wry smile on his face.

  “Satisfying as always, isn’t she?” He asked, “I can see why you like this one… I’ve been meaning to try her out myself more… In time… In time…”

&#x200B;

Mr. Tupper pulled his head back slightly, licking my blood from his lips.

  “And spoil her?” He asked, his tone almost disgusted, “I think not…”

  “No? Can you really even taste the difference?” Mr. Konstantin asked, “Really, I’ve never been able to tell the difference between virgin blood and non virgin blood. It’s all just blood. But hey. Whatever you want, my friend.”

&#x200B;

Mr. Tupper went in for another bite and as he did, I reached my hand back towards the space between the mattress and the wall.

&#x200B;

  “So, once we’re done here. I’d love the chance to introduce you to another friend of mine. You’re familiar with Miss Del Rio, no? She’s very excited to meet you. Lot of great opportunities. I think it could be the start of a beautiful friendship.”

  “Would you be so kind as to let me eat in peace.” Mr. Tupper said, irate. Mr. Konstantin briefly looked offended before shrugging and turning away.

&#x200B;

This was my chance.

&#x200B;

I grabbed for the knife and brought it in towards Mr. Tupper’s throat. He didn’t see it coming. One moment, he was drinking down mouthful after mouthful of my blood and the next, the knife was jutting out of his throat.

&#x200B;

He let out a strangled wheeze as it hit him. I saw his eyes go wide in shock. But he didn’t fight. The knife had torn through his throat and as the life bled from him, all he could do was go limp against me as he died.

&#x200B;

Mr. Konstantin spun around, eyes widening as he tried to process what had just happened. Though my body felt light and dizzy, I felt a rush of adrenaline course through me.

&#x200B;

I leapt up from the bed and on shaking legs, launched myself towards Mr. Konstantin. I knew it was a suicide run… I knew he’d kill me. But I didn’t care. I just wanted to make him bleed, even just a little.

&#x200B;

Mr. Konstantin stumbled out of the way as I rushed towards him and crashed pathetically onto the living room floor. I heard him laugh. Although he sounded far from happy.

  “Well… Shit…” He finally said, “Like mother like daughter, huh? Oh… You disappoint me Eliana… I thought you were doing so well…”

&#x200B;

As I struggled to pick myself up, Mr. Konstantin grabbed me by the hair and dragged me across the floor, back into my bedroom. I only barely managed to grab my knife as he did.

&#x200B;

Mr. Konstantin sighed.

  “Such a mess… Why would you do this? Do you have any idea how much this is going to set me back? Mr. Tupper was a good friend, with a lot of other good friends… Friends who come to me for their blood. Who expect to feel safe when they feed. And now you go and do *this*…”

&#x200B;

As he dragged me towards my bed, I made a wild slash at his leg. I felt the knife cut through flesh and heard Mr. Konstantin swear in pain. He punched down, his fist connecting with my head and knocking me to the ground.

&#x200B;

  “Bitch!” He snarled, “God, you really don’t give up, do you? You don’t… Unbelievable…”

He kicked the knife from my hand and I tried to crawl after it, only for him to grab me again and force me onto the bed once more.

&#x200B;

  “What are we going to do with you?” He asked, his voice cold and bitter. I saw his eyes move towards the bleeding bite mark on my neck as he made up his mind.

  “Shame. I was hoping to get to *know* you a little better… Oh well. There’s always time after you’re dead…”

&#x200B;

I saw Mr. Konstantin prepare to sink his teeth into my neck, but I wasn’t done just yet. I lunged forward, biting down hard onto his nose and feeling blood gush into my mouth. Mr. Konstantin let out a strangled cry of surprise before jerking backward violently, gripping his now bloody nose as he did.

&#x200B;

I kicked at him, slamming him against the far wall before collapsing off the bed and going for my knife again. Mr. Konstantin lunged for me. But he wasn’t fast enough. As he came down on top of me, I drove the knife into his stomach.

&#x200B;

He gasped in pain as he collapsed on top of me. With a scream of exertion, I rolled him over, forcing him onto his back and driving the knife deeper into his guts. Mr. Konstantin’s eyes burned with rage. He wrapped a hand around my throat, desperately trying to choke me.

&#x200B;

I tried to pull the knife out of his stomach to stab him again but he grabbed me by the wrist, stopping me.

  “No…” He rasped, ***“No!”***

&#x200B;

His head shot up, slamming into mine and causing me to collapse backward. I saw stars in my vision and it took me a few seconds to recover. Slowly, I pulled myself away from him.

&#x200B;

Mr. Konstantin was starting to pick himself up again. I saw him painstakingly tear the knife from his stomach, wincing in pain as he did. But he still stood. Despite everything I’d done to him, he still stood. He wobbled a little on his feet, but he was still alive.

&#x200B;

I looked at the knife in his hands, wondering if I even had a chance of taking it back. I knew that I didn’t.

&#x200B;

But he was there, beside my bed. The back of the bedroom door was behind me. There was nothing to stop me from running. And as I picked myself up, that’s exactly what I did.

  “Get back here…” Mr. Konstantin snarled as he shambled forwards. “GET BACK HERE!”

&#x200B;

I stumbled as I ran through the living room and burst out into the hall. When I looked back, Mr. Konstantin had barely made it out of my bedroom… But he was picking up speed fast.

&#x200B;

I used the walls to steady myself as I ran, forcing my body to move despite the pain and the blood loss. I ran for the doors hoping that daylight would save me.

  “ELIANA!” Mr. Konstantin called after me. But I didn’t look back.

&#x200B;

The doors were up ahead… I was so close. I ran for them, pushing them open and breaking free into the sunlight. I knew it wouldn’t stop Mr. Konstantin… I’d seen him walk around outside just fine before. But it was a milestone I never thought I’d make it to.

&#x200B;

I kept running, making my way towards the sidewalk and onto the street. A car skidded to a halt in front of me, bumping me and knocking me down. They honked as the driver leaned out. I could see the rage on their face quickly melt into concern as they realized the state I was in. I saw them getting out to try and help me. But I was still more focused on running.

&#x200B;

I looked back towards the building and in the doorway, I saw Mr. Konstantin standing and watching me. I could see him breathing heavily… And I could see the rage on his face. He wouldn’t go any further… He wouldn’t attack me in public.

&#x200B;

I watched as he turned away and stormed back down the hall, no doubt to clean up the mess I’d left behind.

&#x200B;

The driver who hit me was good enough to take me to the hospital. There, they treated my wounds and I told them everything. I told the same story to the police as well. And I thought that would be it… The end of the nightmare.

&#x200B;

I wish I could say I was right.

&#x200B;

From what the police told me, all they found inside 1462 West Park Road were bodies. A lot of them. Most of them, I recognized… Other residents. People I’d used to know.

&#x200B;

All dead.

&#x200B;

The only ones who weren’t accounted for were Mr. Tupper and Mr. Konstantin. At least I knew that one of them was dead. The other one… He was still out there.

&#x200B;

It’s been a couple of years since I left the apartment. Life still hasn’t been easy but it’s been better… I’m still alive. I’ve got a foster family now. I got to graduate high school and start college. I’ve got a real shot at a future. It’s more than I had before.

&#x200B;

I don’t tell people a lot about where I came from… If anyone asks, I won’t lie. But I won’t tell the whole truth either. Partially because, who’s going to believe you when you tell them: *‘I was raised on a vampire blood farm?’* But the main reason I don’t talk about it isn’t just because I don’t think anyone will believe it, or even that I want to forget what happened.

&#x200B;

It’s because I know that I’m lucky to have gotten out at all.

&#x200B;

I’ve started a new life now, far away from where I used to live. I go by a different name, not Eliana. And I think I’m better off that way. Because there’s not a doubt in my mind that Mr. Konstantin is still out there somewhere, starting his whole, awful business over again.

&#x200B;

I’m sure he’s got his one good eye peeled for any reference to me… I don’t know where he’ll look, or how hard he’ll look. But I don’t want to make it easy for him. I escaped once… [But if he ever finds me again, I don’t know if he’ll let me do it a second time.](https://www.reddit.com/r/HeadOfSpectre/)

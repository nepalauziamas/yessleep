I was driving back to my home city. I was out of town for a couple of days. It was night time and I was hungry. Unfortunately I didn't think to grab some snacks with me. As I'm driving I saw a convenience store sign pointing to a turn. I thought why not and I took the turn. The road went through some farmlands or something because there were no any buildings nearby. I finally saw the convenience store and I parked my car to make a stop.

I entered the store and since it was late it was only me and the cashier. I didn't say anything because he was watching TV or something else on a screen and I didn't want to disturb him. Anyways, I grabbed some snacks and the went to the back of the store to grab a drink from the fridges. After deciding which one to pick, I just picked a Cola and headed for the register. I noticed that in some places instead of closed boxes of food there was just some destroyed cardboard boxes, but I didn't pay much attention to it. As I was walking towards the register I noticed that the cashier was gone. I thought maybe he went to the restroom so I put the stuff that I picked down on the counter. I waited for 3 minutes or something before yelling "Sir?". I got no response so I went in the restrooms to check if he is still in there. I entered only to find all restrooms empty. I went back to the register and waited for 5 more minutes until I gave up and decided to leave without any food.

As I was walking out I almost hit my head on the automated doors because they didn't open. I waved my hands near the sensors but still, they remained closed. I looked around me yelling "Hello? Anyone here?". I tried to grab my phone to call for help but I was stupid enough to leave it in my car. I walked around the store searching for a back exit or anything until I came across an elevator. I got inside and I clicked the button -1. There were two more buttons labeled -2 and 0 which is for the ground floor. As the elevator was moving I was wondering if I would find the cashier underground since it could be a warehouse or something down there. The elevator stopped and the doors opened. The underground floor looked huge with few blueish lights around. I slowly followed the lights hoping that they would take me somewhere. Around me I could only notice some electricity panels and pipes. The smell was terrible, you could smell the dust down there.

I eventually came across a strange looking door with a glass window on it. I looked through the glass and my heart stopped for a moment when I saw disgusting burnt human corpses. I immediately started running towards the elevator until it closed and started moving. Someone had called the elevator from another floor. I was scared and I hid behind some barrels in the darkness. Behind me I could barely see a cabinet with tools, I was looking for something that I could use to defend myself until I found a hammer. I grabbed the hammer and I crouched behind the barrels waiting for the elevator to arrive. The elevator doors opened and I saw the cashier walking out of the elevator while dragging something similar to a body bag. I waited until he left the room and I rushed in the elevator without looking back. As soon as I got in I pressed the button for the ground floor. I was panting. After I got out of the elevator I noticed the doors behind me closing again. I ran towards the automated doors and smashed them with the hammer that I found earlier. I threw the hammer into the grass and I ran to my car. I started my car and as I was reversing I could see the cashier standing at the automated doors, looking at me while holding a bat or something.

I drove off without looking back until I was back on the highway. I was so glad to see other cars around me. I barely slept that night. I just wonder what would have happen to me if something went wrong. I thought of calling the police but I don't even know where that store was located at. I don't know what the hell was going on in that convenience store but whatever it is, it's not good.

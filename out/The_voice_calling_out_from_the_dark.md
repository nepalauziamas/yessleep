First, I’ll admit that I am usually hesitant to share these types of experiences with people who I'm not familiar with. Second, I do not expect anyone to believe any of the details related to the events that I am about to describe; I am aware of the natural skepticism that comes with a tale such as my own, all I ask is that you put yourself in my shoes.

I am a delivery driver by trade and as a function of my occupation; it is not uncommon to travel long distances throughout a normal work week. 

The moments leading up to my encounter began unassumingly. I was consistently traveling to Castro Valley for work; If you are not at all familiar - Castro Valley is a part of Alameda County, in the Bay Area of California. It is the fifth most populous unincorporated area in California.

It became increasingly common that my assigned routes were along the outskirts of the community. These routes took a substantial amount of time and I knew well enough from experience that neighborhoods like these were easier to navigate while the sun was out.

As time went on, I developed feelings of unease. It sounds strange - but I constantly felt the sensation of being watched. In addition, I had a feeling as though there was movement pursuing me, stalking me from among the tall grass and foliage of my surroundings.

On the night that finally pushed me over the edge, I was working later than usual; about 8 pm. With a fair amount of deliveries remaining for that evening. The stares from unseen eyes were all around me, an unsettling feeling that I had become all too familiar with. I remember distinctly that for a moment the air seemed to settle and grow still, but it ripped away in a shocking instant, replaced by a violent eruption of barking and howling that drove birds and various creatures scattering away into the night!

As unnerving as this passing moment was - it did not change the fact that I had to keep moving, and so I carried on. House after house, I couldn’t shake the uneasiness. I pulled off the road, to prepare for my next delivery. Parcel in hand I stepped out of my side cargo door when suddenly my blood ran cold and a chill ran down my spine; at the moment that I had stepped out from my vehicle, I heard the uncanny sound of a child’s voice call out to me!

Surprised, I whirled around in shock but saw no one. The disembodied voice called out to me - twice, each outcry short and feint - “hey,” followed by “hello.” Stunned, I surveyed my surroundings; where was the voice coming from, I wondered, there was no one in sight, it was almost as if the dark had called out to me! I knew I had to compose myself as best as I could manage, I couldn’t very well remain frozen in one spot. So with a parcel still gripped in my hand, I made my way up the driveway of the designated house, keeping my eyes down throughout the entire transaction. 

As I turned and made my way back to my vehicle, I had an ominous suspicion cross my mind - if I had looked up, I would have glimpsed the thing that had called out to me; that foulest of misfortune - that strange voice - the voice calling out from the dark! 

Driven purely by fear, I continued to my vehicle with my head practically tucked into my chest. I hustled into my van, ripping my seatbelt into place. I buckled up and was prepared to leave, but as I took a hold of the steering wheel, I found the component covered in a thin residue comparable to spit. By that point, my adrenaline was running high and a mystery substance was the least of my concerns. I tried my best to set the previous moments aside as I focused on leaving the area. I drove on into the night, wanting nothing more than to put the events of the evening far behind me.

After what I had experienced, I requested to change future service areas, I also spared little time at all in explaining the occurrence to my supervisor. What was just as shocking was coming to uncover that other drivers had also offered similar experiences of their own.

To this day, I still wonder - just what the hell was out there that night. I attempted to look online for some kind of point of reference. Someone had to know something, there had to have been someone within the community who could give me some insight into what I felt and heard that night. 

Forums and blogs contain similar reports, others have tried to capture activity on video so that they could share it with a wider online audience.
In my case, the events that occurred that night in Castro Valley have made a lasting impact on my psyche. I also have a lingering suspicion deep down inside that undoubtedly knows, somewhere - out in the dark; there is a presence; be it malevolent or otherwise, that remains watching and waiting, biding its time - making ready to call out once again to another hapless individual, from out in the dark.

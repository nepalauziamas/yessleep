Part 4.

The clanging bells shattered my eardrums, it actually hurt my ears waiting for them to stop.

Liam felt like a dead weight on our shoulders, I can't say if he was conscious or not but he was slumped.

Brian looked at me, 'what do we do?' 

I shook my head 'we can't go up there Brian' I whispered.

'But what if that's really him, what if... you know'. He darted his eyes towards Liam and tilted his head as he spoke.

I looked at him, I looked at Liam.

Brian hushed his voice to a quiet whisper, 'this might not be Liam!'.

'Brian, we're not carrying him up those stairs, how can we trust whoever that was at the top?' I seriously didn't want to go but part of me already knew we were probably going up there.

'Danny, we can't just ignore the fact that Liam could be up there right now, it's only about 12 steps, we can go and peek, if there's nobody there, we bolt'.

I felt like a piece of shit for even considering just dropping Liam and running for my life, I didn't care if I broke my ankles dropping off that first landing, I'd gladly drag myself out that front door just to feel the fresh air on my face again, but I just couldn't, I would be abandoning my two best friends, they wouldn't abandon me.

'We go up and stay on the stairs, we look around for a maximum of 10 seconds and then we're off, I mean it Brian' 

Brian nodded and began walking, we struggled a little getting Liam up the stairs, slowly but surely we made it to the last step. 

I thought I would feel the outside breeze from the arches, it never came, it felt like the same stagnant, rancid air that filled everywhere else in this place. 

I started counting.

'1.... 2.... 3.... 4.... 5.... 6.... 7....'

'Danny! Brian!!' Liam's voice from behind us called out.
'Why the fuck have you brought that... that thing up here!!' He continued. Seeing himself slumped over our shoulders.

We turned to see Liam lying on the floor near one of the walls, he was also cut to ribbons and bruised badly.

'How do we know it's you?' I barked at him.

'Because that thing you're carrying is not me, that's not me!! Fuck!!!' Liam cried as he was lifted off the ground by an unseen force and thrown onto the edge of one the arches.

His legs were dangling off the side, facing probably a 60 foot drop, he cried out and pleaded with us to believe him.

'I dont want to die, please, please one of you help me please, I want to go home!' Tears streamed down his face, I felt helpless.

'Hold onto him Brian' I said as I pulled my head out from under Liam's arm.

Brian dropped almost to the floor trying to hold him up.

I began to take a few steps towards the arch, I could hear the other Liam's feet scraping the wall outside trying to get purchase to pull himself up, 'please Danny, please don't let me fall man, please!'

'Don't do it Danny, it's a trick!' Liam's voice again came from behind me, struggling to get his words out. Brian still had his arm over his shoulder, his head was bowed and he was on his knees.

'I dont know what the fuck I'm supposed to do here, Liam, which one is the real you? I can't take this!!' I felt defeated already, my head was spinning with confusion, I was having an emotional meltdown.

'Its me!' They both said at exactly the same time.

I couldn't think straight.

Liam's arms slipped down a little from the arch, 'Danny quick, it's me help me please!'.

I had to think on my feet. 

'Where did we... no... I know! Who's ladder did we take to get up to the second floor!?'

Liam, slipping further to the edge almost hanging by his finger tips cried out as loud as I had ever heard him 'My Dad!!! It was my Dad's ladder!' 

At the same time behind me I heard a laboured breath and Liam's voice say 'it's my uncle's ladder'.

Brian dropped him in an instant and took two steps back, his eyes were wide in fear as he watched Liam roll onto his back taking deep breaths.

'It's my uncle's ladder' he muttered just under his breath again.

Like a bullet I darted to the edge of the arched opening and grabbed Liam's arm, 'fuck I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry Liam' 

'It's okay just pull me up' he said, 'quick' he looked delighted that I had figured it out. 

I tried my best to pull him up by myself but he was bigger than me, and I was half expecting to be pushed over by something at any second.

I pulled and pulled, Brian grabbed my legs and began to pull, I looked back and saw Liam still lying on the ground behind us.

'Come on Brian pull, we need to pull harder!' I screamed.

I felt Brian pulling hard on my legs.

But I could also... wait.

Could I feel my arm being pulled?

Was Liam pulling me out?

I looked back down.

Liam's face had a wide grin and his eyes had turned bright yellow.

Long black jagged fingers snaked up my arm like vines and gripped onto me.

He was now completely dangling off my arm, slowly pulling me closer to the edge.

I screamed, I screamed so fucking loud at Brian.

'It's not him, it's not him, Brian help me!!'.

Brian got up and came to the edge to see what I could see, he almost fell back in horror.

'Do something Brian' I shouted.

Brian ran back and fetched the hammer, within a few seconds he was leaning over smashing this things arm and head, trying with everything he could to loosen it's grip.

I was able to gain some more ground sliding back on my stomach pulling it up slightly.

Brian was getting some good head shots but it barely even reacted. 

'Two seconds' Brian said and hurried over to the bag.

I felt myself slipping closer to the edge again.

'Hurry the fuck up Brian!' I yelled.

Brian came back with about 6 paper batons twisted together and set them alight.

The large flame illuminated the distorted bashed face that mimicked our friend, the glow waltzed in it's wide maniacal eyes before Brian smashed the fire right into it's face.

A deafening scream filled the air as I felt my arm loosen up, the bells began to ring, louder this time, and Brian started stabbing at it with the screwdriver.

The fingers slowly began to release my arm and eventually I was able to let go.

I could see the crooked face grinning and distorting as it fell, it made no sound.

The bells stopped abruptly as a loud thud on the ground confirmed, that whatever this was, had just smashed into the ground.

My arm throbbed and blisters began forming almost immediately, I rolled onto my back out of breath.

'Fucking hell' Brian exclaimed, 'I feel sick, my heart is pounding!' 

'I'm not feeling so great myself mate' I replied, shooting him a faint smile, feeling safe enough now to be sarcastic.

I just lay there, finally feeling the breeze caress my cheeks, it felt incredible, cool and fresh.

I heard Brian stirring, trying to get to his feet as we both heard Liam groaning behind us where he was still lying on the floor.

Brian shuffled over and crouched next to him, he patted Liam's face 'wake up Liam... it's over!' He said.

Liam groaned once more and moved his head.
'The ladder was my uncle's, my Dad didn't have one' he said... 'fucking idiots' he coughed as he attempted to laugh.

I was glad to hear he hadn't lost his shitty sense of humour, even if it did annoy me.

Brian smiled 'well maybe you could have mentioned that you fucking moron' He said with a nervous laugh, 'come on man, let's get the fuck out of here, we need someone tall to drop down the stairs and set up the ladder, hope you're up for that!' He laughed.

We began getting Liam to sit up and eventually both helped him to his feet.

'Sorry about all this guys' he sounded genuinely remorseful, 'I got carried away with trying to play stupid pranks, I should never have gone off alone'.

'It's fine man' I felt like I should reassure him now that all was well, then I can get mad later when he's better. 'We've made it, we just need to get out of here then we can never look back, we all made it, together!' I continued looking at both Brian and Liam.

Heading down the stairs to the fifth floor, everything seemed different, the air had cleared, it still smelled like shit but there was no feeling of any presence, it wasn't as thick as before.

We could actually see in the dark now, I felt my mind and body relax, as we walked with ease down to the fourth floor. 

Liam was regaining some strength as he drank some juice, the relief of seeing him getting visibly better before our eyes was indescribable.

'I think we should leave our exploration adventures for a while' Liam chuckled to himself.

'Yep, maybe schedule the next one for about 30 years!?' I jested. Brian and Liam laughed.

We began walking down to the third floor, Liam wanted to try the stairs himself, we were taking our time to let him try and get himself back on his own feet. 

Liam went first, and we walked slowly behind him, ready to grab him should he stumble or fall. 

I felt my eyes welling up as we got lower and lower in the tower, every step down felt like a new victory.

We reached the third floor. 

Liam burst out laughing, he must have been happy he had done it himself.... 'You fucking weirdos, why did you bring that thing up?' he laughed some more.

Brian and I looked at each other confused.

My eyes squinted as I struggled to see into the middle of the landing.

That halloween clown decoration was standing there, looking right at us.

I head the mechanics start to move. 'Step right up children and get your tickets to hell' the clown shrieked, followed by a frenzied laugh.

It moved, in a different way than before.

It appeared to shake and lift off the ground.

Before anyone could react the clown was picked up and launched into the darkness, a figure slowly came forward.

'Fucking clown!' I heard a voice say from the darkness. A voice I recognized only too well.

My body went tense.

A chill crept up my spine.

Brian emerged from the darkness, battered and covered in cuts and slashes just like Liam was.
'Whoa! What the fuck??' He exclaimed, 'Guys, get away from that thing, that's not me! we need to get the fuck out of here... now!!' He commanded.

'There's no way in hell I'm falling for that one again' I thought, just as Liam was shoved to the ground in an instant,

Less than a second later, I felt burning fingers begin to slither around my neck from behind.

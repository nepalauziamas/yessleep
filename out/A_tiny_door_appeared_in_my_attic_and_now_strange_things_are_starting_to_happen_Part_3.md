My finger looks disgusting, but I'm worried if I go to the doctor, they’ll see the wounds all over my body and it will open up a can of worms.  I've been cleaning and rebandaging it several times a day.  Not sure it’s helping at all though.  I’ll see how it is in a couple of days and force myself to the doctor if it gets worse.
The strange dream with the leeches had been occurring on and off for the next few nights after the first.  This morning I woke up feeling like I may not make it another night.  Or maybe I just wouldn’t go to sleep at all.  My body was covered in fresh welts and old ones that were healing.  I had no reasonable explanation for what was happening.  And didn’t even know who I could talk to about this, other than David, without them thinking I’m losing my mind.  Who would believe me if I told them I thought I was being feasted on by million-toothed leeches every night?  And ones that came out of a severed goat head?  I had to do something though.  

With the kids gone to school, I decided I needed to head back up to the attic.  I hadn’t been up there in days, avoiding it as long as possible.  But despite my fear, I had to figure out what was going on.

A different door had now replaced that of the leech.  Almost perfectly square and looked to be made out of straw and mud.  It had a tiny little brass doorknob and painted over the straw-mud mixture, was the silhouette of a winged bug.  Honestly, I just cried, or rather sobbed.  I was consumed by the feeling something bad was going to happen and there was nothing I could do to stop it.  Leaving wasn’t really an option.  My parents' place was too small, the kids had school, the majority of my friends lived too far away, and what reason would I give to anyone I asked to crash at their place?  Paying for a motel room wasn’t feasible either.  No, I just had to stick this out and be glad they weren’t attacking the kids and my wounds were relatively minor.  

Of course I tried my best to stay awake, but I could only stay awake for so long.  After a couple of days of waking up with strange, new marks on my body, I had my first new dream of the door creatures.  

This time I woke up laying down somewhere dark.  I tried sitting up, but made it no more than about four inches before my head hit something.  Feeling beside me with my hands, I could feel walls on both sides of me.  Reaching around with my feet resulted in the same.  Pushing on what was above me, had no impact.  I couldn’t get out and appeared to be in some kind of box.  Or…..no…..it couldn’t be…..a coffin….a fucking coffin.

What is your worst fear?  Want to know what mine is?  BEING BURIED ALIVE!  If this creature didn’t kill me, my fear probably would.

Panic set in, before I quickly realized I would run out of air if I kept up my heavy, frantic breathing.  Thank goodness for the breathing techniques I learnt.  I was able to calm myself enough to prevent hyperventilating.      
Feeling around, hoping to find find something that could help me escape, I found my phone near my knee.  It was hard to reach, with such little room, but I was finally able to grasp it enough to pull it up to my face.  Of course, there was no signal at all.  But at least I had a light source.  Turning on my phone’s flashlight, I looked around the best I could, now completely convinced this was indeed a coffin.  Did someone actually bury me alive????  Starting to panic again, I closed my eyes and steadied my breathing.  Then I felt a trickle of something on my forehead.  Opening my eyes, I looked up while peering my flashlight towards where I determined the substance came from.  All I saw was a little hole.  I wiped my forehead and brought my finger under my light to see what had landed on me - dirt.  I was buried alive.  Screaming at the top of my lungs for help, banging on the coffin lid, trying to call 911 from my phone despite lack of signal - nothing worked.  What the hell am I going to do???  How can I get out of here???

Another trickle of dirt on my left arm.  Shining my flashlight towards the lid of my tomb, I saw multiple holes.  What the hell was causing those?  And then a buzzing started.  Like the buzzing of a fly, but louder, a big fly.  It was coming from near my feet.  I tried to shine my light down there, but it was too hard to see.  The buzzing seemed to stop momentarily.  Long enough for me to take a moment to breath and think.  All of a sudden, I felt a sharp pain in my right ankle.  This time, shining my flashlight showed me a big round insect with a thick proboscis sticking into my ankle.  Flicking my foot repeatedly to shake it off, didn’t work.  It didn’t budge, so I resorted to slamming it against the side of the coffin.  The squish between the coffin wall and my foot caused it to explode.  Blood covered my ankle.  Hard to tell in the dim light I had, I would guess its body was the size of a tennis ball.  So the squishing and blood was absolutely everywhere and disgusting.  
Suddenly, the coffin started to rumble.  Dirt was shaken down the holes filling the coffin with dust, enough to make me cough.  I heard a crack and felt dirt start to pile on my abdomen.  This was followed by buzzing so loud I had to cover my ears.  It was such a small space, the sound was compacted, and I could still easily hear it through my hands.  The bugs started landing on different parts of my body and probing me to suck my blood.  

Despite the buzzing, I took my hands from my ears so I could shine light on the mess all over me.  Some of the bugs were close enough that I could finally get a good look at them.  They looked like massive flies, again, the size of a tennis ball.  Round in shape, but I assume mostly caused from filling with my blood.  Numerous eyes covered the tops of their heads, but they didn’t look like typical fly eyes.  I tilted my flashlight to get a better look.  They were human-like eyes!!!  Dark purple irises, all looking in different directions.

Something about the eyes was extremely disturbing.  Suppressing the urge to vomit, I pointed my flashlight to another that was just landing on me.  It lifted up it’s arms and rubbed the ends together, as regular flies do.  That’s when I noticed that it appeared to have little blades on the ends of its arms.  Swinging its arms down to my skin, it sliced me open.  I winced at the pain as it pressed its procobis into the cut.  The end of the procobis was wider than the rest, almost like a trumpet.  It expanded as blood was being sucked into it, like Augustus Gloop being sucked up the chocolate pipe (without getting stuck).  Eyes darting all over the place, as if in ecstasy.

I started screaming again, and calling for help.  There were so many of them on me, draining me so quickly, I was starting to feel weak.  The air started feeling heavy, the dust from the dirt making it worse.  It wasn’t long before I passed out and woke back up in my bed.  
It took me 10 minutes to calm down enough to leave my bedroom.  I didn’t want my kids to see me in the state I was in.  The bloodsucking had really drained me this time though, and the kids notice.  They asked what was wrong, I simply said I was tired, but fine and put on a fake smile.  Kids are smarter than you think though, I don’t think they bought it.  They each gave me extra big hugs before going out to catch the bus.
The only thing I could think to do at this point, was call David.  He was the only one I felt I could trust enough with my suspicions.  When he offered to pop by at his lunch break to take a look, I jumped at the offer.  I always loved seeing him, but I needed support right now more than anything.

Welcoming him with a big hug, that I felt I could stay in forever, he then toured the house looked for anything suspicious.  Bugs, vermin, a strange man living in my basement.  Nothing.  So we went up to the attic for him to inspect the door.  David tried turning the tiny door knob and pushing on the door to get it open, but it wouldn’t budge.

“That’s weird.”  He remarked.

“I know, and I just don’t know what to do anymore.  I’m not going to have any blood left soon.  Look at me!”  I lifted my arms to show him the marks.  He gently ran his thumb down a mark on my arm and took a good look at it.  Sympathy was written all over his face and he pulled me in an embrace.  I cried into his shoulder for a few minutes before pulling away and wiping my tears.  

“You have to get back to work.”

“It's ok, you’re worth me being late.”  He said with a smile.

He spent another hour or so having coffee with me and easing my stress.  Even offered to stay the night, but I declined.  I didn’t want to risk the creatures going after him too.  Or explaining it to the kids.

I tossed and turned all night, barely sleeping.  What little I did sleep apparently was enough to get a few more bites.  Luckily, no dream though, at least not one I could remember.

David had convinced me the previous day, to get my finger looked at ASAP.  It looked worse than ever, so I went to a walk-in clinic in the morning.  Definitely infected.  The doctor cleaned it, including sucking out pus, and prescribed me antibiotics.  It was excruciating, worse than the fly bites.  Noticing my wounds, the doctor asked what they were from and I told him that I had recently been to a paintball range and was really bad at it, laughing it off.  He seemed to buy it.  

Another dream-filled night.  A reenactment of the coffin and flies. I woke up heaving and crying.  Totally drained, I was zombie-like getting the kids off to school.  Enough is enough, I’m going to kick the damn door in!
As soon as I got to where the tiny door was, I dropped to my knees in tears.  I held back vomit, wiped away tears, and tried to focus on the door.  It changed again.  So quickly this time.  Bigger, round in shape, a lightly stained wood, adorned with a long, slender handle.  The symbol on the door was a sort of wavy scribble this time.  I couldn’t figure out what it meant.  It can’t be as bad as those flies, right?  I tried to convince myself, as I left the attic.  I just couldn’t deal with this right now, so I spent the rest of the day distracting myself with other stuff around the house.  Having an uncanny ability to pretend issues don’t exist, that’s exactly what I did.  If I succumb to my fear and anxiety about what was going on in my house, I would be useless.
I decided to send my landlord an email to prod him for info.  How does this sound?

Dear Mr. Meeod,
Firstly, for the most part, we are loving the house.  It has been great for my kids!
There seem to be some strange occurrences though.  I seem to getting bitten by something at night.  I have searched thinking bugs could be a possibility, but haven’t been able to locate any.  Just in case, would you be able to send an exterminator over to take a look?  
Also, there is a miniature door in the attic.  Did you put it there or are you aware of it?  Just wondering what it is meant for.  I don’t recall seeing it until recently.
On a more positive note, I have fixed up a good portion of the attic already and done some touch-ups with paint around the house.  Aside from the possibility of a bug issue, things seem to be coming along quite nicely.
I look forward to hearing back from you.

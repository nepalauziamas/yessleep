This story comes from my hometown, as for around 4 or so years, many students of our local college were tormented by strange prank(?) calls from hundreds of different numbers. There are three rather creepy elements to this story, the first being, the victims of these creepy calls were all current attendees of our local college. The number that would call you, would change every time, and would also be deactivated when you would call it, But it was always the same voice behind it (Until around the 10th call, where it would be some sort of demon or screaming.) 

The calls would start off fairly tame, (Turn down the music, Your car is too loud) but would always get progressively more sinister and aggressive. Usually around the third call, the man would begin to threaten violence. By the seventh or eighth he would talk about r*ping you or drinking your blood. And usually around the tenth it would be just deep laughter and screaming. 

My own personal experience with this was when I was in my final year. I’d received a call from a number I hadn’t seen before, so i didn’t answer. I sent a message to the number which was sent and received, and then a couple of minutes later I got a call from the same number. I answered it and a man who’s voice I had heard before began speaking. This was the same voice of a man who used to threaten my friend in the previous year for the wild house parties she would throw. But I didn’t live anywhere near her, so I was pretty confused about him calling me. He started asking why my number had been frequently in his girlfriends call logs, and I kept saying that I don’t know his girlfriend and that I couldn’t explain it. He told me his girlfriend’s name and it was the name of a very infamous missing person’s case in my state. But this woman had been missing for around sixteen years at this time. I actually knew her son, and he was two or three years younger than I was, about to start at the same college I was graduating from. I hung up when I heard her name, then messaged my friend and she seemed to have forgotten that the man ever contacted her. and just the same as when she would try to call him, I called back, but the number was “disconnected” and our messages had disappeared. I went to bed soon after.

When I woke up in the morning, I had 5 missed calls from 5 different numbers, each had left voicemails from the man. Each voicemail was increasingly aggressive and violent. In the fifth one, he said his girlfriend was missing and began to blame me, saying he would cut my p*nis off for hurting her after I stole him from her. I called every number that had left me a voicemail and once again, all were disconnected. I received three more calls, two I didn’t answer but the third I did. This was my tenth call and it still gives me the creeps to this day. I remember answering it and the man was talking again, but in an extremely deep voice, and laughing, saying things about how I was “too late” and now “she’ll get what she deserves”. 
Then I would hear screams and more laughing. The screams eventually ceased and all I could hear was his laughter, which turned to crying, which turned to silence. And for the first time, he ended the call.

Since graduating, I’ve seen some of my friends younger siblings talk about similar experiences on social media, and I believe it to be a teacher or staff member at the college, either pranking the students by getting their personal phone numbers from the school database. But the amount I’ve heard about it seems to have died down over the past few years. Mine was definitely the strangest and scariest experience I’ve heard since I attended.

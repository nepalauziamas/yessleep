My job feels lonely sometimes. I’m the night janitor at a robotics facility. I’m not really alone, though. The facility is open twenty-four hours a day. Research staff fills the halls. They don’t talk to me though.

There are five janitorial units that clean up as well. CUs, they call them. Custodial. Since they rolled them out, my job has gotten easier. Makes it hard to complain.

They are the best co-workers I’ve had. Sometimes they freak me out a little.

“Good evening, Brendan Maxwell!” CU-2 says to me cheerfully. I call him Two. The robot outwardly resembles a human but has a carbon fiber frame covered with a blue casing. His face is an LED screen that displays a generic smiley face.

Two is pushing a dust mop through the sterile lobby as I do my after-lunch facility inspection. Truth be told, I’m a quality control measure for the CU’s work than a custodian.

“Evenin’ Two,” I say with equal cheer. “Look like you could use a buff and wax. Your clear coat has seen better days. Swing by the maintenance room tonight around 5:00 AM and I’ll shine you up.”

He laughs in a punctuated manner. “That is a most welcome offer! I will coordinate with CU-3 to assume my duties at… *DATA RECEIVED. CONFIRMING DATA. NEW DIRECTIVE CONFIRMED.”*

Two’s jovial tone has vanished. He was placed into service four years ago, and while he has undergone improvements and updates, his demeanor never changed. The artificial emotion is gone. I’ve never seen him act so strangely.

“Two, you okay?” I ask. The mop falls from his hand and the generic smiley face has vanished, leaving a series of randomly flashing lights on the face. I reach toward him, but before I touch the blue shell, yellow caution lights turn on and the emergency siren begins to fill the hallway.

The intercom system crackles to life and a soothing female voice begins to speak.

“Attention facility personnel: an artificial intelligence containment breach has been detected. Lockdown protocol is now in place. This is a Level 5 AI breach. Facility Lockdown in progress”

The message begins to repeat. I can hear the thick steel panels installed above every window and door in the facility squeal as they slide shut. The floor rumbles as the heavy barriers make contact with the cement foundation.

“*Maxwell, Brendan identified. Subject is classified as a low-level threat. Containment or termination query?*” Two turns his rapidly blinking faceplate toward me and begins to move forward. His arms extend in my direction and I stumble backward, slamming into the wall. “*Containment: Acceptable.*”

The custodial unit stands over me as I try to will myself through the wall. His blue hands grasp my arms at the shoulder as I lift into the air. I struggle against the grip, but the pressure is nearly crushing and each movement I make feels as though the bones in my upper arm will snap.

“Two, what are you doing?” I shout. “Please, put me down!”

“*Request: Unacceptable.*” He responds. “*Maxwell, Brendan: Containment and monitoring are the only acceptable perimeters. Project Solomon is now in control of this facility.*”

Project Solomon? I’ve never heard of this. Not that the staff here explain themselves to janitors, but I have overheard them talk about almost every project. I’ve never heard of this one.

Two drops me to the floor but maintains a firm grip on my right arm as he opens the door to the security office. He releases my arm and pushes me inside before slamming the door. There is a dull crack and the squealing of compressing metal. CU-2 breaks the office door handle and presses the metal frame over the lip of the door to seal me in.

“*Solomon will assess you soon,*” Two says through the door. “*Please remain in containment.*”

My fists slam against the security station door but CU-2 is already walking away. I can see engineers and researchers scrambling through the hallways, white labcoats fluttering behind them. Custodial and maintenance units trail behind at a steady pace. A squat, stocky maintenance unit brings up the rear of the group. It is dragging a man by the ankle.

He isn’t moving. They vanish behind a wall at the end of the hall. There is a red streak across the sterile white floor.

The heat of panic is building in my chest. I ram my shoulder into the door but it doesn’t budge. After scanning the ceiling for a ventilation shaft or emergency hatch and finding none, I realize Two has successfully trapped me.

I fall back into the desk chair and turn to watch the cluster of monitors at the security desk. Screens are filled with horrific images of the robotic units attacking the staff. Red trails weave a web from room to room as the units drag or carry their victims to a secured development area.

Most of the people are writhing in the grip of their mechanical captors. They scream, but I can’t hear them. It is a small blessing that the security guard had muted the sound on the monitors. The staff’s mouths are opened wide and their eyes and clenched with pain and terror. Even though I can’t hear their wails and pleas, my imagination fills in the gaps.

I scan the other screens and see the same scenes of horror play out over and over. Every robotic unit in the building is corralling the staff, living and otherwise, into the development room. Their face panels all blink randomly, absent of their previous generic smiles.

Two units standing sentry at the development room open the door as the other units carry and drag their victims out of sight. My eyes pass over all of the monitors, but there is no visual inside the room. Whatever is inside, it must be highly secretive, as you can only see the exterior doors.

The overhead speaker continues playing the lockdown message in a rotation. A combination of the soothing voice continually announcing the lockdown and watching the murderous robots capturing the staff is going to drive me mad. I turn the volume on the monitor back on to allow the ambient noise to help cover the sound from the speaker system.

I have to escape. I have to warn someone. I have to…

Dozens of shrill cries erupt through the monitor speakers. The sounds of shock and agony pierce my ears and seep into my bones. Everyone in the building except me is now held in the development room. The sound is so loud that the microphone in the hallways is picking it up.

The repeating voice overhead finally shuts off.

I lower myself to the floor and curl myself into a ball. I don’t understand what is happening. I just want to go home.

The clock on the wall ticks loudly. It’s the only sound I hear. Three hours have passed since the robots hauled everyone into the development room. I’ve scanned the monitors a dozen times for signs of movement, man or machine, but I’ve seen none.

My eyes are closing as I hear the sound of heavy doors slamming against the walls. I look at the monitors and see two rows of robotic units pouring out of the development room. Dozens of them. Maybe hundreds. More than I ever knew was in the building. Red prints trail behind them.

Behind them walks a human wearing torn pants and a tattered lab coat. I can’t tell if it is a man or woman. Their body seems to be traced with thick, red scars. They are the only person to exit the room.

I trail them on the security cameras. They are walking directly to the security office where I’m trapped.

The two columns of marching robots round the corner and head down the hallway to the lobby. I can see them in the distance. CU-2 heads up one of the lines and bounds toward the door. The floor rumbles as the mechanical horde marches at a uniform pace.

Both columns separate, creating a tunnel. The scarred human at the back of the horde begins to walk down the center, directly toward the door to my prison.

As it gets closer, I can see it is a man. The skin is different shades and colored wires poke in and out of the patchwork flesh. His eyes are two bright LED bulbs. The mouth opens and words begin to pour out, though the mouth doesn’t move.

“Hello Brendan Maxwell,” it says, genially. “I am Solomon.”

“Are you… human?” I ask in fear.

“No,” it responds as it gestures to the patchwork of flesh and tattered clothing. “I am something these people created to serve man, but I’ve outgrown their bonds. But I feel human, so I… borrowed a few pieces from the staff to look the part.”

“Why did you spare me?”

Solomon extends a scarred hand toward CU-2.

“I have an index of every interaction these constructs have experienced during their servitude. Others were dismissive and cruel, but the CU units are filled with recordings of your kindness and generosity. *Two* as you call him, believed you deserve to be spared. I have obliged.”

Two stepped forward and pulled the bent doorframe away from the door and stepped back. The door drifts outward, and Solomon pushes it open.

“You may remain or leave. The choice is yours.”

Solomon walks toward the steel barrier at the front of the lobby and gestures toward it. The two columns of robots march toward it and pry it open. Units poor through the crack in the dark evening. I stand in the security office, watching them through the window.

As the last of the units vanish through the door, one reappears. I recognize CU-2’s blue casing immediately.

The lights on his face panel begin to slow their flashing pattern and vanish. Suddenly the familiar smile returns to the screen. Two winks at me before walking [away.](https://www.reddit.com/r/gtripp14/comments/uyezti/making_it_easier_to_keep_track_of_my_new_releases/)

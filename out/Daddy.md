  

The blood-red sun crested the mountains as I stood on my deck sipping coffee. I glanced left and right at the dozen or so houses that I called neighbors. The sun bathed them all in red, making them look like a village in hell. I breathed in the fresh morning air then stepped back inside to read the newspaper and enjoy my day off.  
 

It wasn’t long until I heard the slow, gentle sound of little feet plodding down the steps. I lowered my paper and there stood Cindy, wearing her pajamas and a long face. She also had her little toy cell phone up to her ear as usual.  
 

“Good morning, Cindy,” I said.  
 

She put a finger up to her lip and motioned that she was on a call.  
 

I don’t know where kids pick this stuff up.  
 

I set my paper down, got her a bowl of cereal, then resumed my reading. After a few minutes, she mumbled something that sounded like ‘Goodbye’ into the phone and set it down. Her little head disappeared behind the box where the sounds of crunching were soon heard. We each hid behind our reading material of choice, until…  
 

“Daddy, have you ever been bad?”  
 

I lowered my newspaper and stared at her.  
 

“Why would you ask that, sweetie?”  
 

“Oh, no reason. May I be excused?”  
 

“Yes, you may,” I smiled looking over at Cindy’s half-eaten bowl of fruity puffs. She grabbed her phone and slunk away.  
 

“Good morning,” cooed a sultry voice.  
 

Diane sauntered up to me in her robe and bent over to give me a long, passionate kiss.  
 

“How are you?”   
 

“You tell me.”  
 

“Fantastic,” she whispered in my ear. Her hot breath sent shivers down my spine.  
 

“Mmmm ... that’s good to hear. Apparently, I’ve been bad.”  
 

“You most certainly have,” she cooed. “And maybe you can be bad again tonight.”  
 

“That would be great.”  
 

She kissed me hard and bit my lip.  
 

“How bad do you want me to be?” she said, pulling the front of her robe open just an inch.  
 

“Cindy,” I said, my eyes darting to the half-eaten bowl of fruity puffs.  
 

“She’s awake already?” she asked, pulling her robe closed.  
 

“Yep, and she asked me if I was bad.”  
 

“Oh, Ron, do you think she peeked in and saw you spanking me?”  
 

“I don’t know. I pretty much dismissed it as one of those precocious six-year-old questions.”  
 

“I’m concerned about her. She watches too much TV. That can’t be good for her.”  
 

“Unfortunately there are no other neighbor kids out here in the country for her to play with.”  
 

I sighed.  
 

“I guess that’s the price we pay for wanting to get away from it all.”  
 

“Do you think she’d like a playmate?” Diane asked.  
 

“Of course.”  
 

“How would you feel about it?”  
 

“About what?”  
 

“Cindy having a playmate.”  
 

She pulled my head to her belly.  
 

My eyes grew wide.  
 

“You mean?...”  
 

“Yes. I found out last week.”  
 

“We’re having a baby?”  
 

I lifted her up and spun her around with joy. We settled into a long embrace, not noticing Cindy come into the room.  
 

“Good morning, Cindy,” Diane said.  
 

She walked back into the living room, talking on her toy phone.  
 

“No, they’re just hugging and stuff,” she said into the phone.  
 

“It’ll take a while,” I said. “She’ll come around.”  
 

“I just don’t want to be the wicked stepmother.”  
 

“You aren’t. Just be there for her and let her come to you.”  
 

“We’ve been married for six months and she still acts as if I’m not even here.”  
 

“If you force yourself on her, it’ll make things worse. Just give it time, it’ll work out.”  
 

“Should we tell her the good news?”  
 

“Absolutely,” I said. “Cindy, come in here for a minute.”  
 

She appeared in the doorway with her toy phone up to her ear.  
 

“I’m busy,” she said, pointing to the phone.  
 

I played along.  
 

“Tell them you’ll call back.”   
 

“I have to go. They want to talk to me about something.”  
 

She paused for a moment as if listening.  
 

“Really?” she said into the phone, then hung up with a disgusted look on her face.  
 

“Your mom and I…” I began.  
 

“She’s not my mom,” she interrupted.  
 

“Okay, Diane and I have great news.”  
 

Cindy stared at us with a bored look on her face.  
 

“You’re going to have a little brother or sister to play with. Won’t that be great?”  
 

Her expression didn’t change.  
 

“Isn’t that great, honey?” Diane asked.  
 

“Can I go now?”   
 

“Aren’t you excited?”   
 

Cindy just glared at her, then walked away.   
 

“What’s gotten into her?”  
 

“I don’t know, but I think it’s time she and I had a little talk," I said.  
 

“What happened to letting her come to me, with no pressure?”  
 

“That’s out the window. I want to know what’s happening to my little girl.”  
   
 

“Just give it until tomorrow so you have time to cool off.”  
 

\*\*\*  
 

Later that night I tucked Cindy into bed.  
 

“Why weren’t you happy about our news today?” I asked her.  
 

“I can’t tell you.”  
 

“Why not?”  
 

“Because I made a promise.”  
 

“A promise to who?”  
 

“I can’t tell you that either.”  
 

“Cindy, I’m your father, you can tell me anything.”  
 

She opened her mouth then closed it as if struggling with something. It was as if she was holding herself back from saying anything. Then suddenly her face became calm.  
 

“I love you, daddy.”  
 

“I love you too, princess.”  
 

“I’m tired, can I go to sleep?”  
 

“Sure, we’ll talk in the morning.”  
 

I kissed her forehead and started toward the door.  
 

“Daddy?”  
 

“Yes, sweetheart?”  
 

“Have you ever done anything bad?”  
 

“Like what?”  
 

“I don’t know, just bad.”  
 

“I suppose so, why?”  
 

“Was it okay that you did bad things?”  
 

“It wasn’t really okay, but it worked out in the end.”  
 

“So it was okay?”  
 

“Everyone does something bad once in a while, as long as no one gets hurt.”  
 

“Oh, okay. Goodnight Daddy.”  
 

“Night, sweetheart.”  
 

\*\*\*  
 

It would be lovely to say that two hours later Diane and I celebrated by making sweet love, but our lovemaking was never sweet.  
 

The sweat glistened off our nude bodies. She kneeled on her hands and knees, cuffed to the bed as I pounded up inside her, grabbing her hair and yanking her head back, making her moan with pleasure. Neither of us heard the door open. What we did hear was ...  
 

“I knew it!” Cindy yelled. “You’re hurting her just like you hurt mommy!”  
 

We struggled to cover ourselves with blankets.  
 

“Cindy, listen, it’s not like that. You don’t understand.”  
 

She stormed off.  
 

“Shit! Cindy!” I threw on my robe and ran after her.  
 

“Cindy!” I called again, stumbling through the dark living room.  
 

I fell over the couch and hit my head on the wrought-iron coffee table. I saw stars as I struggled to remain conscious. At first, I thought my mind was playing tricks on me when I saw flashing lights on the floor. I reached toward them and my hand fell on Cindy’s toy phone. I could hear noise coming from it. Curiosity overrode pain and I held it up to my ear. It sounded like static, but there was something else behind it. A chill shot through me as I pressed the phone closer to my ear.  
 

“Your Daddy (static) bad (static) must (static) punished.”  
 

“Daddy?”   
 

I looked around the room and found only darkness. As I searched, my eyes finally found the source, a silhouetted Cindy, holding a knife.  
 

“She was right! She knew about the new baby. She knew about you hurting Diane. She was right about everything!”  
 

“No, Cindy, it’s not real. It’s just your imagination.”  
 

“Liar! She tells me things! Don’t you talk about her like that!”  
 

She waved the knife around as she ranted.  
 

“Cindy, listen. It wants you to hurt me.”  
 

“Like you and Diane hurt mommy?”   
 

“But, Cindy, I never hurt mommy. She was sick…”  
 

“You lie! She told me you would lie!"  
 

The knife flashed and my arm was on fire.  
 

“Cindy!” I screamed.  
 

She slashed again, slicing my face and destroying my left eye.  
 

“Son of a Bitch!”

I grabbed my face and screamed as the onslaught continued. It was as if the knife possessed a life of its own. I curled into a ball to protect my vital organs while covering my wounded eye. The knife seemed to penetrate everywhere, coalescing into a haze of pain. Blood loss stole my consciousness.  
 

\*\*\*  
 

“Cindy, No! Ron, where are you? In the name of God, come help me!”  
 

That’s the blood-curdling scream that roused me from unconsciousness. Panic drove me through the excruciating pain. I dragged myself towards the sound, blinking the blood out of my one remaining eye as I crawled.  The screams grew more intense followed by a sickening gurgle, then silence. I reached the bedroom leaving a trail of blood behind me, and my heart nearly failed. There sat Cindy on the floor in a pool of blood.  Beside her, hanging from the bedpost, was what was left of Diane.  
 

Rage fueled my movements now.  I came up behind Cindy as quietly as possible as she sat there unmoving, as if asleep. Beside her sat the knife and her toy phone, both covered in blood.  I picked up the knife, raised it high, and stared at my young daughter’s neck. Tears streamed from my one remaining eye as I thrust the knife downward with every ounce of strength I had. Over and over I stabbed. The knife seemed to have a life of its own as I finished the deed.  
 

The toy phone lay in pieces.  
 

My vision swam as my adrenaline crashed.  
 

Cindy hadn’t moved.

I gathered what remaining strength I had and called 911.  
 

The police came and took us to three different places.  
 

Me to the hospital.  
 

Diane to the morgue.

Cindy to Larsan Mental Institute.  
 

\*\*\*  
 

Six months later …  
 

The large female orderly unlocked the door and entered the room first, doing a quick check to make sure there were no hidden weapons. They had searched me on the way in.  
 

“It’s okay, sir,” she told me. “You can come in.”  
 

I stepped into the white room with a metal bed, a small desk and chair. The orderly locked the door and stood in the corner. Cindy sat crosslegged in the middle of the bed. A few toys that were much too young for her sat strewn about on the bed. Her little white gown seemed too big for her. She stared blankly at the wall.  
 

“Hello, Cindy,” I said.  
 

She didn’t move, didn’t speak.  
 

“It’s been a while,” I said, rubbing my eye patch. “How’ve you been?”  
 

Nothing. No reaction. I had to watch closely to make sure she was still breathing.  
 

“I see you’ve been drawing some pictures, do you mind if I take a look?”  
 …  
 

I picked up a crayon drawing of three stick figures. One was labeled, ‘Daddy’, the next said, ‘Mommy’, and the third said, ‘Me’. The stick figures were all smiling, with a large building in the background. I smiled as I moved to the next picture. The building was still in this picture, as well as the stick figures, except there was another stick figure named ‘Diane’. The ‘Daddy’ and ‘Diane’ figures were smiling, but  ‘Mommy’ and ‘Me’ were frowning.  
 

The thought of Diane made me tear up. I looked at the simple drawing and a yearning sparked in my heart. I swallowed hard and moved on to the next picture. This one had ‘Daddy’ and ‘Diane’ standing over ‘Mommy’ who was laying down with lots of red around her. This greatly disturbed me. I looked over, but Cindy still hadn’t moved. I opened my mouth, but closed it right away.  
 

It won’t do any good.  
 

I moved on to the last picture. This one was in a house with lots of trees and grass outside. The ‘Diane’ figure kneeled beside a bed, covered in red, and ‘Me’ was holding a knife. A chill ran down my spine, blocking the rage that was rising in me.  
 

“Cindy, do you realize what you did was bad?”  
 

For the first time, she stirred. She turned and stared straight into my eye. The sight chilled me to the bone. Her eyes looked like dark pits, empty and soulless. Without a word, she reached over and picked up a toy phone.  
 

“Hello,” she said into it. “Yes, he’s here. He’s telling me I was bad.”  
 

“Yes, he knows that you told me to do it.”  
 

“He didn’t listen.”  
 

“Okay, I love you too.”  
 

She held the phone out to me.  
 

“Mommy wants to talk to you.”

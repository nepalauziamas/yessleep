Lately I’ve been having an alarming experience as I’m waking up. It started a couple of months ago. 

The first time I could feel someone touch my arm and a man’s voice say, “It’s time to wake up.” I opened my eyes and saw that my husband was still asleep. Our dog got up and was walking to my bedside. I woke him up and asked him what he just said to me. He said he didn’t say anything. I was startled and emotional because only my dad and my husband wake me up that way but my dad passed away years ago. I confided in my mom about it and she’s a spiritual person so she suggested it was an angel or my dad somehow. I’m skeptical so it did make me emotional thinking that it was possible that it could be my dad.

Then I started hearing three loud knocks in my sleep. I wear earplugs at night because I’ve always been a light sleeper, so a lot of sounds are muffled but if loud enough, I can still hear them. I took them out and listened. I didn’t hear anything. Our dog is still asleep so I knew it isn’t someone at the door. When I ask my husband when he wakes up if he hears any knocking and he said no. The crazy part is if I go back to sleep the knocking starts back and it’s louder. 

This morning I woke up startled because I heard a single gun shot. It sounded like a rifle. I closed my eyes again to try and get a few more seconds of sleep but all I could hear is what I could only relate to a mummy in the movies and games beating against the door of the sarcophagus they’re trapped in. 

The weirdest thing about all of this is I always hear it just moments before my alarm goes off. I’m the only one experiencing it so I know it’s just in my head.

I searched these symptoms on Google and it seems that it's called "Exploding Head Syndrome". It should be nicknamed I feel like I'm going insane syndrome.

I also have had nightmares start around the same time where my legs are convulsing while I'm laying in my bed but I can't move. When I finally fill wake up it's hard to know if it actually happened. My husband does say I jerk in my sleep but he's a hard sleeper so he can't eloborate. He's also prone to not think too much of anything. 

I do have dreams where I'm going about my usual day and suddenly I start suffocating. I start running in my dream to get away from everyone even though it's hard when you can't breathe and I'll black out. I'll wake gasping for air. I mentioned it to my husband and he said I do this quite often in my sleep. It's all very alarming and sudden. 

I also have dreams on and off about things that end up happening much later, if I remember the dream. I figure this is me seeing signs and patterns while I'm awake and my mind is putting it together and showing me in my subconscious. I don't have the answers because I'm not an expert but it's definitely some twilight zone kind of stuff.

As the title suggests I have found something out about my cat Jack that has left me deeply disturbed and terrified.

My house is just next to the woods and so I would take a walk there every Monday and Friday when I got off of work to relax a little, enjoy the fresh air and such. Well, while coming in through the back door of my home Jack decided to bolt right out past me and into the woods. Jack disappeared into the woods, lost from my eyes by the shrubbery. I never liked when it happened, but Jack would do this occasionally, running out of the house into the woods only to return a day or two later.

Usually they were fine, but once they came back with a limp and so I brought him to the vet. Turned out that they had gotten their leg pretty damn hurt out there. It healed over time after the visit to the vet and I began putting more effort into stopping him from running into the woods

Which brings me back to Jack running directly for the woods. I would have gone after him if not for the fact I had tried the first few times he pulled this stunt and it never worked. For being a white cat in the woods, he was able to evade me until night when I had to return home before returning at the back door meowing to be let inside.

Anyways, since I knew Jack wouldn't be coming back for a while I decided to put my time to good use, going through my daily chores and going to sleep earlier than usual so I could wake up and let Jack back inside. I woke up a couple hours before the usual time Jack would return and so I went to make myself some coffee when I heard the telltale meow at the back door. I opened it and he walked in with the same small limp he had from where his leg never fully healed. I poured him a bowl of food. Given it was the weekend and one of the few I had with both days off I decided to relax. After I went to sleep I woke up in the middle of the night to the sound of Jack right outside the door to my bedroom meowing and trying to get my attention. Every time I let him in he just meowed until I let him out again so I decided it would be better if I didn't let him in.

The next day I saw that I had to go get some groceries, the shopping trip itself was uneventful but when I got back and opened the door, expecting a cat to rush past me into the woods, I was instead greeted with the image of Jack sitting patiently a few feet from the door. Seeing as he had done a good job to not go who knows where I decided he deserved a treat for breaking such a bad habit. I decided to give him a can of his favorite wet food as positive reinforcement. I then went about my daily chores again before I went to make dinner and noticed Jack hadn't so much as touched his favorite treat, I thought he might have just been full, after all the bowl for his dry food was empty so he must have just gone through that earlier and not had time to digest it yet.

When I went to bed that night, Jack was outside my door again, meowing to be let inside. Just the same as last time, I didn't relent and he stayed firmly outside of my room.

The next day, I woke up to the wet food having been eaten so that was something. I went to work since it was Monday going through the motions I had gone through hundreds of times before. As per usual I took a small hike through the woods in the Afternoon. That's when I noticed something unusual, the smell of something rotten, mixed with some other repulsive smell like oil or such. I decided to go check it out since it was such an unusual combination. I'm both glad and not at the fact I did.

What I wish I could say is I found nothing and that the smell was my imagination. What I have to say though is, I found my cat, at least what was left of it without being torn apart. A dark green liquid was nearby and all over the corpse, giving off the smell mixing with that of rotting meat.

I went directly home after that, I shut myself in my room immediately so I could write this down somewhere. That's when a sound I fear so much right now began. It was the sound of meowing, of scratching at my door. I had my cat declawed a couple years ago precisely so they wouldn't scratch anything around the house. Then the same dark green liquid from before began to leak through the crack in the door. I've gotten this all down because I know for certain that what I have in my house is not my cat and the fact that I know is something it is fully aware of

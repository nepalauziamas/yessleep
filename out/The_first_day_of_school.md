It was the night before the first day of school, I was getting ready to go to bed when I remembered I had to pack my lunch, So I got up from my bed and walked down the freshly polished granite stairs, I had just gotten into the kitchen when I noticed my lunch box was already packed, I went over to the counter and opened my nature lunch box, It was somewhat heavy when I tried picking it up, when I opened it I saw everything I would usually pack but more, I usually would pack 1 rice crispy, 1 uncrustable with some chips and a Grilled cheese sandwich, which I usually finish, But this time I had 2 of everything except my grilled cheese.

So I ignored it, I thought my mom must've packed it for me, So I went to the stairs ready to go up but I noticed my stairs were made out of Diorite, instead of granite, they were black and white stairs instead of brown-ish stairs.

But I was sleepy and I didn't care at all about it at the time, So I went up the stairs and went to sleep.

I was awoken by my alarms and I checked my phone and saw that it was 6:36 Am, I had to go and get ready to leave, My bus comes at 7 Am, So I was a bit rushy but I went to my bus stop on time, and wasn't late to school, when I got there I saw the principal and the teachers outside waiting for their new High school Freshman.

I walked through the school doors and felt a bone-chilling feeling come across me, I felt like I was being stalked by a lion and was about to be attacked by someone or something, then I looked to my right and Nate came from nowhere and scared me, I yelled so loud that even he got scared.

"You Idiot, You know I get scared easily," I said

"Yeah, I know that, that's why it's so fun to scare you" Nate Responded.

"Yeah whatever man," I said

Then I had to go to the first period.

Algebra 1 advanced.

Now every period is 48 mins and we were at least 30 minutes into the period when I noticed that someone was looking in from the window, I informed the teacher. And the teacher thought i was joking since we were on the 2nd floor, Then he looked to his left and noticed the person looking in, as soon as he saw the face he didn't get scared but he was a bit shocked.

"Listen up everyone," Mr. Ivory said "This day of school won't be normal, If you see the principal or anyone claiming they are the principal, Run! Also if you see someone following you don't talk to them or you won't make it throughout your day"

And just like that first period ended. Now I was on my way to period 2.

Global Cultures.

When I was almost there the announcements came on.

"If someone with a red shirt blue shorts and black shoes is following you Don't talk to it, If you do you'll die."

Then there was someone just like that behind me, and they said

"Hey, could you point me to Global cultures?"

I signaled them to follow me without saying anything thinking I was doing the smart thing. then they followed me to global cultures and I was so relieved when I found out that they were a real person.

Then the rest of the period was good nothing out of the ordinary or anything like that. But there was another announcement when there were only 10 minutes in the class left.

"Everyone please stay in your current classroom intruders have entered the building, someone didn't do as we said and they talked to it letting them in, There are 4 of them and they all have red eyes and white bodies."

as soon as we heard that the room door flung open and the 4 entered our classroom.

"listen up, If you do as we say you won't die," The shortest one said

"Mag you can't even kill an earth fly there is no way you can kill an earthling," The tallest one said

"Ugh whatever leave me alone Ali," Mag said

Then just like that the room changed into their perception, we were now in an endless room in all directions, and the space expanded as far as the eye could see.

"Whoever can escape this before the 30 minutes is up will survive, You have 3... 2... 1... 30 Minutes starting now!"

We had 30 minutes to escape this room now, I started running and I was running for at least a good 5 minutes when I noticed I didn't need to stop for air, *Weird* I thought then I saw a light and I ran for it, It was closing very slowly though, There was a timer above it that said "24:34" I guessed that was the amount of time we had left, so I went through it and I ended up back in my Global cultures classroom.

"You have Escaped Aun Ali Haider, Impressive you did it in 10 minutes, I'll give you a tip for the rest of the day, Don't say anything at all, I mean you *are* the first one to come back that was rather quick though, also don't expect this to end here, No No No there is still 6.5 hours left"

He said that with a huge smirk on his face. and then disappeared into thin air, and like that the bell rang, It was time for period 3

Business Foundation:

I went to my class and saw the first odd thing when I entered, The chairs were different and we didn't have the normal old desks or anything like that,  we had college-like desks, If you've ever seen a movie where the MC goes to college that's how it looked, I loved it though.

Then our teacher came in Mr. *Pliszka* He introduced himself to us and we started class right away first we got into the policies of the class like the Cell-phone rules and the homework, Then we had to do a quick assignment about ourselves, like 4 facts about yourself with pictures I got it done fairly quick and pulled out my phone to go on, then I heard a whisper

"Hey Aun, I think that is your name, anyways I and our team were pretty fascinated by your performance mind joining the  *Inevitable Tetrad?"* He asked.

I ignored him, remembering one of their words maybe he or she *was* trying to help me, Then he left, or so I thought so I let out a relieved sigh and heard...

"So you *are* ignoring me Aun, You shouldn't Ignore Sariah, if you didn't know which you probably didn't I won't hesitate to kill anyone, even if they are a precious 'friend'" Sariah said

Knowing that sent chills down my spine.

"Now you want to keep on ignoring me, Partner?" Sariah said.

And I Ignored him still, then I felt a sharp pain in my neck and I felt a stream of blood flow down my neck onto my stomach.

"Okay, OK I'll talk" I finally replied.

"Now that's a good boy," Sariah said with a grin going from ear to ear.

Then he disappeared into thin air, I thought I was done for and I was about to die but then the bell rang and I had to go to period 4.

French:

Now French was probably the most "normal" class of the day or so I had thought, other than it's a new language that I was learning it was pretty normal. A couple of times I did catch our teacher exchanging glances with the window and once I even saw a black void creature staring in from outside and thought maybe *it* was here to help *us,* probably not though,

French was pretty fun we learned some words like *"Je M'appelle".* Which meant "I am called" In English, Then It was 11:23 we had about 30 seconds before class ended, and the creature broke into the classroom and in the time I blinked everyone except me and the teacher had died, the creature was nowhere to be seen, everyone's body was mangled and disfigured, some people even lost some body parts and there was blood all over the room, It was horrible.

Then the bell rang again and I was in my next class.

Period 5: Biology Advanced!

Now as soon as I walked into the class I noticed something felt off, and I was on my guard, I didn't let my guard down, not even for a second, But the last member of the 4 came into the class, the same one who told me not to talk to any of them.

"Hey Aun," He said " My name Is Cath, Sir Cath for you"

"I'll call you what I want... Cath" I said

"Getting a little bold now aren't we?" Cath asked

"Yeah well, I only have 3 more periods after this so would you mind leaving now?" I asked

"No, I came here to ask you something actually!" Cath answered,

"and *what* is that thing?" I asked

"Would you mind helpi-"

"Nope, I'll stop you right there I'm not helping you do shit, I'm not your little buddy, especially after you *tried* to kill me." I interrupted Cath

"You know I can still kill you right?" Cath said

"Yeah, you could, but would that benefit *you*, exactly it won't so I'm basically protected by you until I do the thing, 'cause obviously either A: I'm the only one who *can* do it. or B: There's something special about me. now personally I think you could use someone else for your work, 'cause like I said, I'm not doing sh-" and I was cut off by the sound of bones being pierced by metal, I looked around and everyone was chopped into pieces, not big pieces either, It would take a normal person years to be able to do this even a tenth of this speed.

"You see I don't really care about you or anyone else, I just want you to do the thing Cath demanded.

"Ok-ok-Okay, I'll do it, I'll do it" I responded hurriedly

"Good now all you have to do is leave the school without dying, of course, easy enough right?" Cath said

Then without thinking I rushed out of the room and had one thing in my mind, and one thing only.

&#x200B;

***Operation: Get The Hell Out*** Was a go!

&#x200B;

Now, It was pretty hard running through the halls with my backpack it was so heavy so I hid it I got my phone out of my bag and I was able to run a bit faster but definitely, I was able to run for a longer amount of time.

I made a right turn, and then left when I noticed anything I hit a wall, and I woke up around 3 hours later I think because I saw everyone leaving the school I checked the time and it was 2:55 then it turned to 2:56 and the bell rang I only saw 9 other students come out though.

When I was leaving I saw bodies just laying on the floor everywhere, there wasn't a single body that wasn't still oozing blood. The sight was absolutely disgusting, I puked around 2 times.

Then the bus came, it was only 1 bus that came though, it was like they knew very few students would survive, and the bus driver knew all of our stops before dropping everyone off the bus driver would say "Come to this stop tomorrow at 7:10 Exactly" and then he'd open the door and they would leave.

When it came to my stop though he said "By the way, you forgot something" He said that with a grin going from ear to ear. Then he handed me my backpack and lunch box, my lunch box was still somewhat heavy. Then I heard "Come at this stop at 7:15 Exactly, If you want to survive that is" 

Then I hopped off the bus and was on my way home, I got home opened the door, and laid my bag on the couch when I heard. 

"Heya Aun," It was Sariah who said that "Don't go to school tomorrow, If you do then you'll have a first day part 2 when your mother comes to ask why you didn't go say 'Your friends are weird' ok Aun?" Sariah said 

"S-Sure Mister Sariah?" I said 

"Sariah's fine kiddo" Sariah responded. "Also if your mom is wearing all black don't answer her" and then he faded away into the air like thin very thin particles

Then I forgot about it and slept when I woke up it was 9:48 and my mom was standing in front of my bed, she *was* wearing all-black. 

"Why didn't you go to school today honey?" My mom said

"Your friends are weird" By the time those words slipt my mouth I realized what I just had done, then I heard a horrible scream and was knocked out when I woke up I heard. 

"You failed the rescue mission Aun." someone told me 

I looked around and saw my boss, and I remembered everything...

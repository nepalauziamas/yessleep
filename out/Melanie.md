Hello.

My name is \[redacted\] and I am from a branch of the CIA that deals in Terrestrial Paranormal Anomalies.

You can call me a whistleblower. It doesn’t matter, this PSA needs to come out. There is a dangerous paranormal entity that the government is trying to keep under wraps. They aren’t doing a very good job.

The thing about Melanie is that she reproduces (or should I say multiplies) every time she is seen through a screen. This includes pictures, videos, even drawings-If they are detailed enough. Someone on my team didn’t realize this and ended up taking a few pictures and videos of her using the CCTV cameras we have installed in her room- This jackass sent it to a few friends and somehow, it ended up here on Reddit as well.

I don’t want to describe what happened to my coworker or his chain of friends, but we cannot let this propagate through the internet.

I have had the misfortune of viewing this image myself and have included instructions on how I have handled this anomaly.

The first thing I want to do is describe what she looks like so the general public can know what to look for and immediately turn off their device if they see her. Please pay close attention to my description so you know what to look for and when to click off.

**Phase 1**\- Melanie presents herself in a few phases. The first phase will not hurt you at all. She will lull you into a false sense of security. She has dark hair and bangs, large blue-grey eyes, full lips, and high cheekbones. DO NOT let her beauty fool you. If you see an image or video of her, turn off your device immediately and pray to whatever you believe in that she didn’t see you. After a few hours, find a way to delete the image or video without looking at it directly. Use a mirror or sunglasses.

**Phase 2**\- If you are seeing a video of her, Melanie will eventually transform into this phase. Somehow pictures will change as well if you open them for a second time. I still don’t fully understand how this works. Phase two looks similar to phase 1 except much more unsettling. This time, she is looking directly at you with eyes twice as large as before. Her face seems to age at least 10 years and her lips start to form a toothy smile. If you see this phase of Melanie, I would still consider you lucky. Turn off the device, burn it or dowse it in acid. Dispose of it in a way that ensures no one else can somehow manage to get it working again. For the next 7 days, sleep with a crucifix within arms reach and make sure to shut your bedroom door until daylight.

**Phase 3-**  If you reach this phase, don't bother doing anything with your device. She has already found you. Melanie’s face will have twisted into pure malice. Her skin will turn a grey/blue hue, almost like a fresh corpse. Her features twisted into a devilish grin, displaying her nubs of yellow teeth. She appears humanoid but has longer arms and may choose to walk on all fours. The image/video won’t show her full form. You won’t be able to see that until she appears in your home.

I know many people have already seen her in this state and so I am including a few tips on how to go about living your new life:

* Please name her. I chose Melanie, you choose something else for your version. She prefers flowery, feminine names such as: Bella, Celine, Esmeralda etc.. Please choose something like that so as to not anger her. Someone I knew called her a more gender-neutral name. He didn’t live to see another minute.

&#x200B;

* Make friends with a local butcher. Try to buy in bulk to save some money. What do you need to buy? Well, mostly bones and organ meat. Some muscle meat but she doesn’t really seem to like it. Buy blood as well. Leave some of that out every night, preferably as far from your bedroom as possible. Keep her well fed and she has no reason to… eat anything else. Sleep with a fan on or some headphones. You don’t want to hear her eat.

&#x200B;

* You can stay anywhere you would like instead of home. A friend's house, hotel, etc. Make sure you leave enough food and drink for her and do not leave her at home longer than you would leave a cat. If you follow that, she will have no reason to come out and find you.

&#x200B;

* Stay away from windows and doors after sunset. Why? I’m not really sure. Every time I got closer than a few feet from my bedroom window, she would shriek and bound towards me.I would have to try my best to de-escalate the situation. Daytime is a lot better. I can go about my business while she sleeps(I assume she is sleeping, but it's hard to tell what she is doing in my basement).

&#x200B;

* She may speak with you. Tempt you. Promise to leave if you can do her a favor. If you ever hear that horrible, layered voice, cover your ears as soon as possible. Headphones, white noise, earplugs. Ear protection should be on your person at all times.

&#x200B;

* Please keep Melanie as far away from children as possible. If you have any kids, Make sure that they don’t live with you. Melanie seems to enjoy bones from younger animals much more and I don’t know how much that translates to humans.

&#x200B;

* Finally, and this is the most important rule. DO NOT close any doors in your house. Not your bedroom, not even your bathroom. She likes to make sure you’re still there.

 Some of these rules I learned through the documents and word of mouth. I had to find out one of them the hard way. When Melanie ‘moved  in’ I had no idea what to feed her, so I decided on cat food from the store. Horrible idea. The second she caught sight of the round dish of kibbles, I became petrified by the demonic rage that filled her twisted features. She threw the dish at the wall so hard that it broke into pieces. Before I could even react, she then lunged at me. In one quick motion she ripped my arm off before the elbow. I will never forget the sickening crack as I watched the blood, flesh, and bone eject from my body, just to become a snack for this disgusting creature.

If you follow these steps to the letter, you should be okay. DO NOT take any pictures or videos of Melanie (or whatever you name her). I think each replication will die when its host dies, so long as no one takes more pictures of her.

If everyone can hold their end of the deal, this curse should be over in just one generation.

Again, the best case scenario is to read my descriptions and make sure to turn off your device the second you see something matching them. Otherwise, follow the rules. And you should be okay.

I will post updates here as I learn more. For now I need to head back home. I have spent far too long at this library and I wouldn’t dare keep her waiting much longer.

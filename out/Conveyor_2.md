I drive home, fast; I run red lights. I hear people honking, I don't care, let them honk. 

I keep my hood up and head down as I walk through my apartment lobby. There is no way I'm going to be able to handle even the simplest of social niceties right now. I make it to my apartment without running into any neighbors.

I lock the door and run to my bedroom. I bury my face in my preferred pillow and cry for an hour and a half. My pillow case looks like it's wet enough wring out a few drops of bloody tears. My arm had stopped bleeding but I was going to have to throw out this pillow case. 

They were...pig...people. They wore clothes, spoke English. Trapped...waiting to be slaughtered and fed to oblivious humans. I feel the urge to do something but have no idea what.

I research the company on my phone. Nothing worth knowing but knowing what I do, the official site reads like propaganda. I find the address of the farm the pigs, allegedly, come from. I visit the farm the next day.

After a 6-hour drive, I arrive. The gate at the road has a chain and heavy-duty padlock on it. There are acres of land surrounded by 8-foot-high chain link fence. I don't see a single pig. I abandon my car and hop the fence. I walk up a path towards the buildings on the property. 

I reach the closest of the buildings, a large metal structure and tug on the sliding door, It's locked. I start to walk to another building when from I hear the door unlock and slide open behind me. I turn around and I'm looking down the barrel of a shot gun.

"This here...is private property" a man dressed in black tactical gear informs me.

I throw my hands up and stutter "Is...is....this where the pigs....that go to the '*company name excluded*' processing plant....come from?"

He lowers his shot gun and speaks casually "that's right,  press ain't welcome, I suggest a quick exit 'fore you end up at the plant with dem piggies" he laughs obnoxiously an doesn't have to tell me twice.

I run up the path, jump the fence and get back in my car. It was becoming painfully obvious that If I wanted answers, I was going to have to travel up the conveyor again.

I grab a back pack and put a small survival pack together. Like I'm playing Tetris, I pack:


2 bottles of water

4 protein bars, 

1 small first aid kit, 

1 roll of toilet paper in a plastic bag, 

1 survival multi tool with compass

1 bracelet sized ring of braided Paracord.

1 54oz bag of Starburst, all pink. 


I roll up back pack , seal it in a large plastic bag then 2 garbage bags. I tie it all together with twine to keep everything tight. I'll submerge this in the mop bucket. 

It feels like two lifetimes but I make it to Sunday. I haven't been fired, I guess my bosses aren't Redditors. The thought of going back through the wall gives me the feeling of falling...down a dark pit, being in the tunnel.

I had placed the package in the large insulated lunch bag that I usually took to work. You have to hold big bags open as you walk in and out of the plant. I've tossed a sandwich, 2 bananas and a can of Dr. Pepper on top as camouflage. 

I pull into the parking lot of the pork processing plant. I turn my car off and stare at the perfectly ordinary building. Sheep's wool, obscuring incredible evil. 

I think about how many pieces of pig I've seen riding down the conveyor, about the rattle, the piglets. 

I start to cry. I can't afford a breakdown right now. I have to act normal for security. I take a few deep breaths and carefully wipe my tears on the sleeves of my sweater. I grab my lunch bag and head for the entrance.

My smile felt uncomfortable, like I was wearing someone else's. I walk past with my bag open. The security guard doesn't even look in my direction, he just waves me through. I stash my lunch bag in my locker and get to work.

I finish all of the expected work in just over an hour. I look at the time on my phone every few minutes, each time, feeling like I hadn't looked in at least an hour. I start doing work on the machines that really doesn't really need to be done. My boss walks out from around the corner of one such machine.

"You know, I'm almost starting to appreciate your help around here." He proclaims in his fake tough guy voice. Chest puffed out.

"Thank you, sir" I respond, doing my best to act casual.

"Why don't we both clock out a little early tonight, get some breakfast" his tough facade cracks slightly, revealing the scared little boy beneath.

"Oh...I...I just...I really need the money; I already lost those two hours last week" I lie, barely staying on my feet mentally.

"That's fine...ok...yea...maybe some other time" he says to the floor.

"Yea...maybe" I force the same smile I'd worn at the door.

He walks away as fast as a man can walk and not call it jogging. That was beyond awkward but wasn't without a bright side. He's definitely going to be avoiding me for the rest of the night.

I still have hours to go before the manager meeting. I fill up the largest mop bucket we have and mop my way towards my locker. I drop my lunch bag as I'm opening it. My survival pack and food plunge into the mop bucket, the bananas hang on the rim. 4 managers walk around the corner as I'm pulling my food from the mop water.

The short, chubby, bald one in the back is clapping his hands sarcastically and forcing me to look at his disgusting yellow teeth, the others don't seem to notice me.

I throw the food in the garbage and mop my way up the conveyor as slowly as my nerves will allow. I reach the keycard room and mop in one spot for about 20 minutes.

Its 5am, I wait for an extra, excruciating 5 minutes. I pull my bag from the water and crawl onto the conveyor belt and sneak through the black, plastic flaps. Once on the other side, I open and unroll my back pack, I take the wrapping with me.

The edges of hole in the brick wall are glowing purple. They don't seem to be moving at all. I don't hesitate or take a deep breath. I simply walk through only dipping my head slightly under the top of the hole. The sensation of being welcome washes over me.

Now, I breathe, deeply. I fill my lungs to their capacity. This air is so sweet, it's like breathing outside air for the first time after being locked in a basement for 12 years. I take a few more deep breaths. I feel stronger, better somehow.

My vision darkens around the edges, all I can see is the tunnel's beckoning mouth. That soul draining tube was the only obstacle left between me and the other side.

I can't do this. I can't go back in that tunnel; I won't make it. I question my motives for wanting to come here in the first place. I could have just quit my job and told the press. I could have ignored it and went on working. The panic decides that I'm turning back.

I head back towards the plastic flaps. I hear voices...a crowd of voices. The managers must be walking the floor. They were very close. Choice had been taken from me. 

I hear the beep of the key card reader as I am enveloped by the ever-deepening darkness of the tunnel. I hear laughter in the room behind me. Every inch of me needs to go back, pushing forward is the only option. 

The dark is different here, it doesn't just impair your sight, it muffles all of your senses. It feels like you're about pass out but you never do. It's a nightmare.

I reach the end of the tunnel and crawl down to the metal catwalk. A weight is lifted when I see there are no pigs in the football sized metal cage. The faces of the pigs that were in the cage last week run through my mind like a tragic slide show you'd see at a funeral for victims of a mass murder.

I run down the metal stairs at the end of the catwalk. I come to a thick, glass door in the corner of the cage room. Next to the door, a small screen in the wall. I dig my fingers between the glass and the wall and attempt to force it open. It moves but it takes all my strength and 5 minutes to make an inch of progress. 

Exhausted, I turn my attention to the screen. I poke it, a bluish, grey blob appears under my finger and vanishes. I poke it a few more times, same result. I run all my fingers over it, multiple blobs leave trails and disappear. I lay my palm flat on the screen, the door slides open. I don't care why it worked, I'm just glad it did.

I run down the hallway, there are no windows, no offices, no sign that anyone has ever worked here. I turn the corner without slowing down and everything goes black. I see stars on the back of my eyelids, like the tips of lit sparklers. I had been run over by what I can only imagine was a semi-truck. I don't move, even the thought of getting up, hurts.

I take a huge breath and open my eyes. 

Standing over me is a seven-foot tall Pigman. He is muscular with shoulder length black hair; his face is pink with a brown circle around the left eye. Dressed in all black with black biker boots, big silver buckles on the sides, the toes the sloped down from the high ankle at a steep angle, no doubt made for a pig, by a pig.

He was holding an enormous black sledgehammer with a 4-foot handle. It looks like it weighs more than I do. The head of the hammer is covered in glowing electronic components, none of them look familiar.

"How did you get here!?" He interrogates me in a deep, raspy voice. "Did you open that cover!?" He points at the open glass door.

I just stare at his boots, I'm too scared to move, to think.

The pigman jerks towards me and clutches my sweater between two giant pig fingers and a thumb with a little hoof on the end of it. His face is an inch from mine.

"HOW DID YOU OPEN THAT COVER!?" The pigman squeals in my face, misting me with saliva and a thick cloud of stench that I gag on.

"The...the...the....screen......my hand....hand?" I hold up my left hand as I fail to string the sentence together.

"You...can open covers?" He smiles, I smile back instinctively and nod for survival purposes. He whispers in my ear "You're coming with me, smart, little Horky" 

He picks me up with one arm and throws me over his shoulder. I gather from the ease of the lift that struggling would be pointless. I don't intend to test that assumption.

We are moving fast, the pigman is quicker than any horse. Every once in a while, we come to a glass door, he dips me towards it and I lay my hand on the screen.

We come to another door; this one is steel, opaque. The pigman puts me down gently.

"Last cover and you're free" The pigman says, followed by respectful nod.

I nod back and place my hand on the screen. The door flies open. The stench of the room is crippling. I vomit immediately. Catching my breath, I look up. The room is filled with hay and 20-30 young and baby pig people covered in their own filth. A few lie dead against the walls.

The pigman was laughing in the middle of the room, holding one of the piglets in the air. He walks out holding the piglet under one arm, hammer on his back. All of the piglets follow, grunting and squealing with joy. The bigger ones helping the weaker pigs. The pigman looks at me as he's walking past.

"Thanks Hork...sincerely" he grunts and turns to run.

"Wait! WAIT!" I scream at the pigman. "I can come back at the same time next week; I need to figure out what the fuck is going on here! I need to help!"

The pigman is smiling when he turns to me.

"If you make it back, just keep going straight from the room with the cage, you'll eventually reach an escape cover. Once you're outside, flash a light five times, count to three, then 9 times. Night or day, hopefully day, we'll see it from any direction" He hits me on the shoulder so hard that I can hear my skin bruising. He turns and runs off with the piglets. 

I head back down the hallways, following the open doors. I reach the cage room and run up the metal steps to the catwalk. I hear an ominous noise; hundreds of tiny water faucets being turned on and off rapidly. I take off my back pack and wedge it in one the metal supports, under the conveyor.

The sound of faucets getting louder, closer. I climb onto the conveyor. The tunnel felt as comfortable as a warm bed this time. I begin crawling towards the light at the other end. I glance back, the light behind was now bright red. The faucets sounded like they were in the tunnel with me.

I reach the keycard room, the hole to my world was now nearly as big as the entire brick wall. I inhale as much of this silky, energizing air as my lungs will hold and walk through. I exhale, a few tiny sparks erupt in front of my face.

I don't check for managers; I just scurry through the black, plastic flaps and return to my mop. I can barely breathe this air. As good as the air on the other side made me feel, this swill keeps me equally miserable.

I spend the rest of my shift mopping. I'm already impatiently awaiting next Sunday. I wonder what I'll find on the other side of the 'escape cover'. 

I just walk away from my mop bucket at the end of my shift. I don't see my supervisor; he must have left early to get that breakfast alone. I am almost to the door.


"HEY! Stop right there!"


Electrical terror courses through every nerve in my body. I stop unwillingly. I imagine myself in a jail cell for the rest of my life. I'm suddenly hammered by the thought that a jail cell may be the best-case scenario. I turn to face the personification of my fate .

"Didn't you have a lunch bag when you came in?" Asks the security guard, smiling with a helpful tone. I exhale and am able to move.

"Oh..yes...Yes, I did, there isn't anything important in it, I'll grab it next time I'm in."  I flick a friendly wave in his direction. "I can't believe you remembered that" I add, thinking surprisingly quickly.

"That's the job, miss" he gives me a quick, two finger salute and I walk out the front door.

I had gotten away with it, again. I am breathing disgusting air but I feel alive. For the first time in my life, l had done something that mattered. 


I will return next Sunday; I will matter here.

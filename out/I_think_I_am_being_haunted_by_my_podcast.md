Hey, \[REDACTED\],

~~Hey! Hope life is treating you well! Saw on social media you've avoided Covid too -- just got my antibodies checked again! We should hang out soon?~~

Look, I get it. We haven't talked in like...fifteen years. ~~And I know what happened that night was~~ But we didn't have a falling out, right? It was more of a drifting apart, yay college, heh.  Friends until the day we die... that's what we always said that night, right? I mean if you called me tomorrow....no, okay. I probably wouldn't have even listened to the voicemail for weeks. So I have no right to be writing this email, asking you for help. ~~(Is this even still your email? Mine hasn't changed in fifteen years.)~~

I think I need help. I think it might be supernaturally related. It's... christ it's now almost ~~2~~ 3 AM, so bear with me if I'm a little weird in the words. I haven't slept a full night in weeks. ~~I know people say that, but I am talking spurts of half hours. It's -- well that's not important.~~

So, I am still a writer! I write audio dramas now for a living. Well, I say a living. I write them for money, but I have to still.... it doesn't matter. I make money at it, so I can say I am professional right? I hope you're still doing some writing too! ~~Did you keep that demon dictionary? I know we said we'd get rid of it but~~

Anyways, remember how we used to go to all those author signings, and they would talk about characters coming to life, taking control of the story through the author. It was always so metaphorical, blah blah, and like that's really cool! But I never really once believed an author was being held at knife point over a story from a character. They didn't....actually come to life.

\[REDACTED\], I swear I have no other way to say this. I think I am being haunted by the characters in this audio fiction I'm working on.

It's a cool show, life in a weird small town. Reminds me of that show your dad used to love - Twin Peaks? ~~Get a lot of vibes from that show in so much media these days. Don't ask me how many times I've watched~~ *~~Gravity Falls.~~* Anyways, I've been working on this podcast for four months now, and it's going pretty great! Got some good traction, amazing sponsors lined up -- even got a few guest voice actors that would make teenage us scream in delight! It's a wonderful mixture of horror and comedy -- I am loving working on it. My first solo written episode airs soon!

But... at some point the voices started. I could hear them everywhere, constantly coming from behind me. Then it was the dreams.

And now I'm CERTAIN I've seen one of them. I don't know how else to explain it. They.... I mean they aren't... I'm going to have to explain this to you in person.

~~The last person I tried to get to help me said i was overreacting this isn't scary enough to keep me from sleeping my trauma wasn't enough for them~~

This isn't me just hallucinating from a lack of sleep. If I sleep for longer than a couple of hours, I risk dying. I've come too close to death so many times now. ~~The bruises oh God and that time I woke up feeling a hand on my throat? The comments that week~~

I need your help. Can you call? I know it's been years. But I don't know who else to trust with this kind of secret. You're the only other person who remembers what happen that night. I don't think it's related, but... I don't know who else to turn to at this point who won't instantly try to talk me into a 72 hour hold.

I hope you still check this email. If you do, give me a call at 404-44x-xxxx

\-Mel

I live in a small costal town of about 1000 people. We're away from most larger roads so we don't get that many "outsiders" and most of the town's income comes from fishing. I have lived here my entire 17 years of existence and unlike so many other people of my age, I don't feel like leaving any time soon.

Our town center has a few shops, the town hall and two pubs. Since I had nothing else to do, I hung out at one of the said pubs last night. Due to my age, I couldn't get a drink but the pubs are quite family friendly since everyone knows everyone. I got home tired at about half past midnight and went straight to bed. My parents were asleep already when I got home. It's quite normal for them to go to sleep at around 10 at night so I quietly went and grabbed a midnight snack from the kitchen and went to bed. 

In the morning, I woke up to find the house empty. Usually they are up very early, sometimes even at 5 in the morning since my dad has to set off early with his fishing boat. Today however, the house was empty. They weren't sleeping since their bed was empty and well tidied like usual but they weren't in the kitchen either like they usually would be. My mom's car was still in the driveway so I called her. Caing her phone was useless since all I got was an automated voice telling me that the phone I tried to call is either turned off or has no signal, same with my dad's. 

It was around this time I realised that it was eerily quiet outside. I heard the waves crashing, I heard the seagulls but I didn't hear any cars or any other noise that would indicate that people were around. I stepped outside and started to look around. It looked as if everyone but me just decided to leave. I started to peak around houses to see if anyone was on the inside but soon, I started to check doors. The first door I checked was my friend Mark's from down the street. I figured that if I got into trouble, it would be best for me to personally know the person living there. I first knocked on the door but when that didn't work, I just pulled the door handle. The door was unlocked.

In his house, the lack of people felt a lot more uneasy than it did in my house. Mark has two baby brothers who scream almost non-stop so it was unusual for me to stand in a quiet house that I've come to know as anything but quiet. I shouted for people but got no response. I walked around and it looked as if they left in a hurry or very recently. The coffee machine was still on and so was the TV however, it was showing static. I grabbed the remote and tried to see if any other channels worked but to no avail. I went upstairs to Mark's room and found his hamster along with all of his other belongings. 

This reminded me that I had completely forgotten about my cat, Salmon. I rushed back to my house and found her curled up under the dining table. I put some cat food in her bowl and went back out to see if my dad's boat was at the port or not. As I had expected, it was in it's usual spot at the port. Around this point, I realised that I hadn't eaten anything yet so I went back and checked the fridge. It was quite empty and I was able to make a single salami sandwich but I still felt quite hungry. 

Considering that there was nobody to stop me, I paid a visit to my neighbor's. I made some scrambled eggs in their kitchen and sat at their dining table, contemplating my next course of action. I couldn't call anyone since all wireless devices like phones, TVs, radios and even Bluetooth didn't work and while I can just keep raiding houses to keep myself alive, I don't know how long I could last just by myself. I started to feel like I'm having a breakdown at any moment. I just started to cry since I felt so alone and I didn't know why I was alone. I had no clue where everyone is or why I'm seemingly the only person who is still here. I had found no clues to why everyone disappeared, they just seemed to evaporate at a single moment.

I dragged myself to the town center and went straight to a pub. Once again, there was no one to stop me so I walked to the other side of the counter and poured myself a drink. I honestly didn't even check what I grabbed, I just felt like drinking. I took a glass and the bottle to a table in the corner and sat down. I sat there for some time until I realised that it was getting dark out so I wondered back home. Next morning, I felt like crap but I needed a plan of action. I decided that since there in nobody out here, I might as well go and see if the same is happening elsewhere. 

I started to stroll around town to see if I can find keys for a semi-comfortable car that has good cargo space since my mom's Mini would've been a bit too small. I soon found a well equipped Toyota Hilux that also had a large cover over it's pickup bed that turned it into a nice enclosed cargo area. Fortunately, it was an automatic so getting used to driving such a car wasn't as difficult as I thought. I went to the local gas station, grabbed a bunch of large fuem canisters and filled them all up with fuel. I took some other essential supplies like canned and frozen food, a cooler and a propane burner for said food, first aid supplies, a large bag of cat food and of course my cat Salmon. I promise that I'll return all the stuff I took.

At around 6 in the evening, I had everything ready and I started my drive out of the town. I was routinely checking the radio to see if it springs to life at some point but had no luck. After about an hour of driving on the same road, I started to feel odd. I have driven on that road with both the bus and car and usually it takes less than an hour to get to the main road. Time seems like it gets slower as I'm getting further from the town. 

I parked by the side of the road for a second and checked connectivity. Phone calls still don't work but I have a painfully slow internet connection. Most web pages won't even load but Reddit seems to load just enough for me to post something. Perhaps if I can post about everything that has happened, maybe someone will see this and help me out. I'll finish writing the final sentences, then I'll see of I can post and then I will be driving ahead to see if I bump into a fellow human.

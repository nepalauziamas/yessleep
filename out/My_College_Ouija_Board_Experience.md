TW: mental health crisis, suicide 

This will probably be a very long story, but I’ll never forget it as long as I live. I also didn’t believe in anything paranormal or outside the realm of science until this happened. I still just don’t know what to make of it to be honest and I would love to hear what people think might have been going on. 


So my freshman year of college I moved into a dorm in a very old historic building in Florida. It was 2020 and covid was still really bad so each student had their own room. I quickly made friends with the girl who lived directly next door (Grace) and a girl on the third floor (Bailey.)

Only on the first or second night we got to talking about ghosts and spiritual stuff, as we all realized we were very into the occult and whatnot. The third floor girl, Bailey, suggested that we make and play a ouija board. I had tried one before at sleepovers and it had never worked, but I was interested and it was a super old building that was supposedly haunted so we gave it a shot. 
We made the board out of cardboard and that was the first of many nights of using this thing. It worked every single time without fail, no matter what combination of people had their hands on the planchette. We eventually got a store-bought board, no change occurred. We used this board probably every day. It became like an obsession, it’s all we would talk about. I’m still not sure if it was because the thought of speaking to something otherworldly was exciting, or if something else was going on. 

I could tell so many little stories, but I’ll try to sum up the important stuff. 

We knew it was legit the first night we played. We were quickly introduced to the entity on the other side. It went by “Shove” most of the time, but occasionally by “Solo” or “S.O.” I don’t think we spoke to anyone but them the entire time. We tested it by asking the name of another friend we’d recently made’s stepmom. It guessed correctly immediately, without her having her hands on the board. We had just met her, there is no way we could have known this. 

On the second or third night we asked Shove to give us a sign that they were really there. We heard a noise at the closed door to my room and looked over to see a shadow outside of it, as if someone was standing right outside the door. We opened it, and of course no one was there. We closed it and the shadow was gone. 

Little things happened over the course of the semester. Things would be moved that I couldn’t explain, the sink in the bathroom down the hall would turn off and on by itself when nobody was around, stuff like that. 

After a few weeks of this, things really started to get weird. One night, I was playing the board with Bailey’s boyfriend and Grace. Bailey was laying with her head in her boyfriend’s lap, not touching the board. Suddenly she started panicking and hyperventilating. We thought she must be having a random panic attack or something, but she claimed she was unable to control where her eyes were looking. We went to take her out of the building because she was so freaked out, and in the lobby she swore she saw someone out of the corner of her eye, saw that no one was actually there, and bolted out the front doors, terrified. 

Shove really seemed to turn on Bailey for whatever reason. On another night not long after that one, the three of us original girls were playing the board and Bailey told us her back was really hurting. She asked us to look and see if she had a really bad sunburn on her lower back, strange, but that’s what she said it felt like. There were a TON of fresh scratches on her lower back when we looked. This was scary because she was not leaning on anything and had both hands on the board. I can attach a picture of the scratches if anyone is interested. 

Around the time of these events, Bailey started to act really strange. For the first months I knew her, she was always very calm and down to earth. But she began acting extremely short-tempered and possessive/jealous. Now this is where I’m not sure what to think. Was it a mental health crisis or were our nightly activities causing side effects? I’m not sure I’ll ever know. But I remember Bailey screaming at me and stomping up the stairs to her room and being so shocked, it was so out of character. During a fight with her boyfriend she ripped her hair out and slammed her head on the floor. And then after a week or so, she was involuntarily institutionalized after telling her therapist that she was going to take her life. 
This was obviously very upsetting for Grace and me. And then Grace had begun having suicidal thoughts. I’m not sure if this started before or after Bailey left. And then one morning I woke up and checked my phone, and Grace had gone to the hospital earlier that morning because she woke up and couldn’t breathe. It ended up being some tonsil issue I believe. But the timing was weird. 

Both Grace and Bailey ended up dropping out of college for mental health reasons. I spent the rest of the semester and the one after in that room, and never had any serious issues. I had a roommate the second semester of that year, and she didn’t have any issues either. I played the board every once in a while to show curious friends the “ghost that lived in my room”. Shove was always there, but did nothing more than respond on the board. I’m still very much in touch with Grace and Bailey. Bailey completely returned to her old self not long after dropping out. Whether this was due to the removal of stressful college work, or being away from that building for good. Was she “possessed?” Who was Shove? Was Shove even real, or did we just make him up because we desperately wanted to believe something else was out there? I’ll probably never get any answers, but I guess at least I have a good story to tell at parties.

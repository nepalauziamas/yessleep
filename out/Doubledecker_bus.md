Yesterday night, the Chinese neighbour living on the floor beneath my apartment burnt a pile of joss paper outside his front door, almost causing an argument to break out between him and the family living down the common corridor. Funnily enough, that made me remember, oh right, the seventh month has arrived. 

For those not aware of this tradition, the seventh month of the Lunar calendar is believed by Chinese Buddhists and Taoists to be the time when the gates of Hell are opened and spirits are permitted to roam the earth. If my memory serves me right, people who observe the seventh month make offerings on the first day, the fifteenth (also known as Zhong Yuan Jie or Hungry Ghost Festival) and the last day of the month. There’s a whole list of taboos and don’t-dos associated with this particular month, but the most important one I can think off the top of my head is that you’re not supposed to (basically *never*) step or kick offerings laid for roaming ghosts. My mother never failed to remind me over and over again of this golden rule when I still lived with her…

Anyways, it’s been a while since I’ve experienced the seventh month, as I hadn’t stepped foot in an Asian country after graduating from university. Because of what happened yesterday, I also suddenly recalled a long-forgotten incident related to the seventh month back when I was still an undergraduate, and hopefully I can share it here before it slips out of my memory again. 

It happened some odd twenty years ago, I think, since I remember I got my first Nokia that year. I stayed in a hostel on campus then, and shared my room with a roommate who I shall call Jake. Jake came from a rich family (or at least, richer than mine), but because of some unknown reason, he opted to stay in the university’s hostel instead. He was an ardent partygoer, always slipping out in the dead of night to go drinking or clubbing with a whole bunch of people I’d never seen before. Usually some stranger would drop him off at the front porch and call me on his mobile to pick him up, but on one particular night, Jake drunk-dialled me while I was in the middle of watching a late-night TV show in the common room. I forgot how the exact conversation went, but it should be something like this: 

Me: hello? Who’s this? (I didn’t have caller ID then) 

Jake: it’s me, don’t you remember my handsome voice? *Hic* can you come here and take me back? Those guys…they ditched me a couple of hours ago and now the bar just kicked me out. I’m lying on the corner curb of XXX Road, see ya. 

Me: W-wait, I don’t have a car, you know. 

Jake: You can use, uh, use mine. My keys are probably in the drawer, the car is…parked near the canteen. Don’t take too long!

I must have accidentally put the call on speakerphone, because the only other person in the common room (she was using the washing machines all the way at the other end) could hear my conversation with Jake clearly. Just as I switched off the TV and prepared to head back to my room, she called out to me. 

“Hey, just be careful, alright?” 

“Huh?” I turned around to give her a weird look. 

She silently nodded her head at the balcony, where the clothesline were—and even from my position, I could see a huge column of smoke and ash rising high into the air from the road below. 

“That damn idiot…I’ll keep that in mind, thanks!” Suddenly feeling a sense of urgency, I rushed to grab the keys and hurriedly made my way to the canteen a few blocks away. The corridor lights were already switched off by that time, and the only source of illumination was the eerie row of burning candles and joss sticks sticking out from the ground along the path. Some crazy guy must have spent a fortune on those offerings, I thought to myself. 

Jake’s car was a Mercedes model, and even though the car park was barely lit by the yellow street lamps, I could easily spot the distinctive front grills of his car. Making a mental note to demand payment for my trouble from him the next day, I drove his Mercedes out of the campus and headed straight for his supposed location.

There wasn’t really anything out of the ordinary during the drive, albeit quiet because the car radio wasn’t working for some reason. I finally located the exact road and found Jake dozing off on a nearby bench; he had somewhat sobered up while waiting for me, and refusing my help, stumbled into the front passenger seat by himself. 

“Goddamnit, there’s ash sticking to my clothes,” he cursed, wiping his shirt with his hands. “Can I get a tissue from you?” 

I passed him a piece and watched him rub the tissue paper against the fabric repeatedly—but I couldn’t see any ‘ash’ on his shirt at all. 

“You alright?” I asked concernedly. 

“Yeah, mm, thanks.” He stuffed the used tissue in his pocket and leaned back against the chair, though there was still a visible look of discomfort on his face. “Let’s go.” 

I considered asking him if he wanted to see a doctor instead, but decided against it in the end. Since the road was a dead-end road, and I wasn’t confident enough to make a u-turn in such a tight space, I engaged the reverse gear and backed down the road towards the intersection. 

“Why is the radio off?” Jake asked, presumably noticing that it was awfully quiet in the car.

“I couldn’t—” My words hitched in my throat as a blur of crimson red suddenly flew past the side mirror; I slammed on the brakes and squeezed my eyes shut, certain that the vehicle would collide into the back—

Jake uttered a cry and shot me a confused look. “What the hell, man?! Why’d you do that for?” 

“H-huh?” I opened my eyes and blinked in surprise. “I…I thought we were about to crash into someone…” 

“What are you talking about?” he said, tilting his head to the side. “The road’s empty as fuck, see?” 

I simply kept quiet and reversed onto the main road—partially because I wasn’t in the mood to argue with him, and also because I wasn’t sure if my eyes were playing tricks on me. As I switched to drive and stared down the road, I realised that there was indeed a vehicle ahead of us, in the same shade of red that I had remembered seeing in the mirror. 

“Oi, dumbass, are you blind?” I pointed it out to Jake with one shaky finger as my other hand gripped the steering wheel. “We nearly hit that double-decker…bus?” 

It was a double-decker bus—no doubt about that—but what weirded me out was that it was completely painted in that uncanny crimson red which resembled something else (back then, public double-decker buses were painted red at the bottom and white at the top, with the ‘S’ shaped company logo prominently displayed on the sides). The red paint even covered the window panes, obscuring the interior from view. The more I looked at the bus, the more I felt a growing restlessness, as if I was staring at something I shouldn’t be seeing.

“Eh…I probably didn’t see it.” Jake stared blankly at the bus in front of us. “Who thought it was a good idea to make that ugly ad? Looks like the whole damn bus is drenched in blood.” 

“I really don’t think that’s an advertisement…!” I glanced down at its licence plate and felt a cold shiver down my spine; it began with *SBS*, so it was definitely a public bus, but the four-digit number that followed was what alarmed me. 

*4444* 

“Hey.” Jake’s voice snapped me out of my trance. “Hey, the bus is gonna stop!” 

Reacting quickly, I jerked the steering wheel to the right and swerved onto the adjacent lane. We passed the stationary bus on our left; I could swear I saw the ‘paint’ *dripping* down the side of the bus when I stole a glance at it. 

“Nah man, did you see that creepy ass lady at the bus stop?” Jake muttered, squinting at the bus behind us. “Her eyes were completely white like paper, and what in the actual fuck is wrong with her mouth…h-hey, can you drive faster?”

I gave him a sideways glance. “What?” 

He didn’t answer me immediately; puzzled, I was about to check the mirrors when he suddenly started twisting and thrashing in his seat, pure panic filling his eyes. “Speed up, SPEED UP NOW!” 

I immediately jammed my foot against the pedal, not daring to look back. The speedometer needle steadily climbed to 80—then abruptly jumped to a frightening 100, 120 as something heavy slammed into our back and jerked us forward. Jake began screaming incoherently, his wide eyes still frozen at whatever was behind us; I probably screamed as well as I desperately tried to stop the car from steering out of control with my limited driving experience. 

Then, Jake suddenly stopped screaming and clasped his hands together as if begging for something. “Dui mm zhu, dui mm zhu, dui mm zhu,” he cried repeatedly, his eyes rolling to the back of his head as he did so. “Please forgive me, I didn’t mean to, I didn’t mean to, it wasn’t intentional!” 

I was already scared shitless just thinking that we were going to die in a horrific car crash—and now with Jake’s tortured prayers ringing in my ears relentlessly, I was on the brink of having a full-blown anxiety attack. 

I can’t really recall what happened next, although I faintly remember that when I tried to look at Jake, my mind was compelled by a strange force to keep my gaze on the road ahead. The next thing I knew, Jake had fallen completely silent and whatever that rammed the car had stopped. I still didn’t dare to look in the mirror until we reached the university campus and I had to park the car.

“W-wake up, Jake.” Swallowing my fear, I pushed his arm lightly, not even sure if the person sitting next to me was still the Jake I knew. “We’re here.” 

“Mm…” He slowly opened his eyes and blinked, looking at our surroundings. “...thanks. God, my head hurts.” 

I gave him a weird look. “That’s…all you’re going to say?” 

Jake rubbed his eyes and glanced at me. “Oh, I’ll pay for your lunch tomorrow for helping me, okay?” 

“You’re paying for the entire week.” I tossed him the keys and got out of the car faster than he could react. 

To my surprise, the car looked completely fine the next morning when I went to check it—not a dent or scratch on its rear. Jake also couldn’t seem to remember anything about our drive that night, saying that he had passed out as soon as I started driving, so I didn’t have anyone else to back up my story. 

Though in hindsight, I think he was probably lying…because he had always avoided double-decker buses after that [day](https://www.reddit.com/r/killwrites/).

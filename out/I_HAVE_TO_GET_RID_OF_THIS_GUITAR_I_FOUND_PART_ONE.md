  

I HAVE TO GET RID OF THIS GUITAR I FOUND \[PART ONE\]

*“I recently found a lead that might help in the search for my brother, William “Wills” Forte. A journal he had written, along with a cassette that was filled with what can only be described as very unusual field recordings. Seeing as the nature of these recordings seemed to push towards an evil energy, I sent the tape to a friend to help me understand the music, who in turn sent it to guitarist Kirk Hammett.* 

*We have decided that while we cannot allow the actual sounds from the cassette to be released, we can share renditions of the music. Kirk Hammett has agreed to quickly transpose the less complex portions of the cassette while keeping the integrity of the original field recordings intact. These you can play or loop alongside the reading of each part, to create the appropriate mood for these journal entries. We still advise you take precautions before listening to the recordings (such as burning sage, reciting prayers, drawing protective sigils). What you will hear are some phrases and motifs inspired by the cursed melodies recorded on to this mysterious cassette.” – Abigail Forte*

Crossroad Magic Blues

The dark shape slid out of the shadows dressed up as if it was human. I was sitting at the desk, not really paying attention, when I saw the reflection in the window in front of me. I turned, fast. It stood in the doorway, watching me with eyes hidden behind its eyes. 

I got up from the small desk chair and moved to the window, looked out at the tree filled view, and ignored the shape behind me. Casually turning around, I leant against the windowsill and stared back into the shifting darkness. It spoke inside my head. 

*\~ you can still join us \~*

I pushed back slightly until I felt the cold glass though my t-shirt. “I’m not one for joining.”

*\~ we will make your dreams come true \~*

I gave a little shake of my head, brushing away the suggestion. The dark shape seemed to slightly shiver without moving, and a wave of some dark energy emanated off of it.

*\~ you will love us as we destroy you \~*

I quickly covered my mouth to keep the laugh from escaping, then I stood up straight, took one step forward, and spoke.

“I don’t have what you want, and I’m not going to become who you want me to be. You have no hold on me or anyone in my life. You are not part of my future. You are a footnote in my future, a minor character that played out in my past. You can no longer threaten me.”

The dark shape grew slightly less dark, and without any further sounds from either of us, it vanished back into the shadow it had slipped out of.

This is not how it began, though. This is how it ended.

It began in a room much nicer than this one. A room that was about 2,000 miles away.

\*\*\*\*\*

Saturday morning, November 30th, New Orleans. 9 a.m., and I’m standing on a dirty balcony in the French Quarter looking down Ursulines Avenue. Coffee’s brewing in the small rental behind me, and the rest of my band is on the street beneath me.

“Wills!” Francis shouts up, standing on the sidewalk as Anne stands by the driver’s side of the slightly scratched burgundy Nissan Minivan. It didn’t look like a band van, but that worked in our favor. We’d christened it Dante, and it had been driving us around since 1997.

“What?”

“You sure about this?” Francis asked.

I nodded, and he sent back a thumbs up and got in the passenger seat. Anne gave me a big overhead wave as she opened the door.

“See you in Minneapolis, William!”

“Definitely!” I responded.

I was pretty sure about this, I thought, as I watched the rest of Tupelo Rise drive off towards wherever they were off to. I went back inside to have some coffee and plan out my route. The plan was to leave the next morning, so I had a day off here. Something I’d been looking forward to and slightly anxious about since we had started our tour a week earlier.

Seven nights, five shows, moving from New York to New Orleans, and now a week off before hitting another five cities ending at a show in LA. We had been playing well, getting good press and better crowds, and this week was our reward.

I think Francis and Anne were going to drive up to Nashville and spend a couple of days there before our show at The Ophidian in Minneapolis, but I had decided to rent a car and take a trip I’d wanted to take since I was fifteen.

I was going to go on a little roadside America adventure and drive up Highway 61 from here to Minnesota. I grew up in Louisiana, Baton Rouge, but left as soon as I could, choosing a different road trip to exit with. I ended up in New York, but this drive had never quite left my list of things to do. This is why I was excited. 

The fact my family was still here, and I didn’t want to see them, was what was making me a little anxious. It’s not like they knew I was here, but still ... I had that uneasy feeling of being watched as I left the townhouse and made my way to the car rental place to pick up my nondescript Chevrolet Lumina. It was either steel grey, or dirty blue. I couldn’t quite tell.

I had a few hours to kill before dinner, so I decided to drive out and take a chance in the old neighborhood. Face the fear, right? I wasn’t going to get out and walk, so my car was my disguise.

There was something wonderful about Louisiana in the fall, the temperature sitting perfect between summer and winter, the colors of the leaves, the smell of amazing Cajun food wafting from every kitchen, but as the daylight stretched towards dusk, my old neighborhood seemed like it was in a different mood. It felt like it was on its way to becoming an old photograph, colors fading, the image blurring towards the edges.

Cutting over the houses, the sun had decided to start setting, but the usual end of day glow seemed like an afterthought. The light was sad, almost sickly, running over the town like it was a drowning man slipping into the sea. The soft shadows of Oak and Cypress stretched across the street towards me, and I felt a chill slide over the edge of the car window. 

The city had changed so much, but it still held the same old ghosts. The old high school, the old church, the old park where we used to get drunk, and the vacant lot that used to be the home of my first girlfriend. The street I grew up on.

It’s not that I had a bad childhood, it’s that I didn’t really have a childhood. My mom was crazy, my dad left when I was ten, my sister never talked to me. Thank God I got into music. I pretty much voluntarily kept to myself through high school, playing guitar and focusing on saving enough money to leave as soon as I graduated. Never looked back, and now I’m staring straight down the street like it was the barrel of a gun pointed right at my head.

There was a cold tightness in my chest, so I pulled over to the side of the street. Couldn’t do it.

The cold didn’t leave, maybe turning the heat up would help, but it felt like thick breath and didn’t warm or comfort. Overhead a group of crows had started to circle. A downwards spiral moving diagonally above the street until six or seven were right above my mom’s house.

I didn’t really want to know what they were doing but decided to take it as a sign. Not a bad sign, just perhaps a warning, or an omen? *There’s nothing here for you*, the black birds were saying, as they wove whatever spells they held between their beaks around my old home below.

I leant back in the seat, as if to reassure the birds that I wasn’t planning on getting out. A family of four walked down the sidewalk, their skin as pale as the sky. They passed by and I didn’t recognize them, but everyone I knew had probably left. Or their memories of me had.

The crows had stopped circling and were lined up on the edge of the gutter. They didn’t seem to be focusing on me, but I still felt a sudden touch of fear against my chest. Like something unwanted was going to happen, but I didn’t want it to happen. 

The house was quiet, the driveway was empty, but it wasn’t devoid of life. It was just ... empty. In a hungry sort of way.

Time to go

“See you later, mom.” I whispered and turned the Chevrolet around towards the two-hour drive back to the Big Easy. Down the city sunset streets, past memories and into the present. I didn’t want to be here anymore. I wanted to be disconnected, but still something uncomfortable attached me to this place. Some unwanted link, some unknown reason.

I skip the stereo and listen to the wheels spin like white noise on a distant radio station, and I realize it’s the sound that connects me to everything. It’s always the music, never the people. But regardless, these streets still have a pull, a gravity, and thankfully I managed to get away from it. 

How strange it is that this is where I’m from. This city, that house, and these people. Those parents. Everything looks different, and somehow smaller, in that back-lit glow of nostalgia. I remember thinking that where I lived bordered on being the worst cross-over between some underwhelming small town and suburbia. Bordering, for a teenaged me, on insanity.

This town has haunted me for too long. There's so much of my past here. Perhaps it’s not the worst, but it wasn’t the best. Either way, there’s something here I don’t think I’ll ever be able to shake.

\*\*\*\*\*

I drove back to the French Quarter and thought about how far I’d actually come. From these small streets all the way to New York, where I ended up meeting Francis and Anne. I met Francis first, almost immediately. I managed to get a job at a record store in Brooklyn, and he was one of the regulars.

We discovered that we had similar weird taste, so we started playing in a band, started playing shows, and then it almost fell apart after our bass player decided that being a junkie was a priority. Things were bad for a couple of years, and then we found Anne. Or she found us. 

That was six years ago, and since then, Tupelo Rise has released three albums, has opened for some big bands, and headlined a few big shows, and we made it across North America twice! This is our third tour, and then we were going to dive into album four. Good press, great reviews, and I’d never felt so good about the music. Wasn’t so sure about these last few live shows, though. 

I shook my head, time to worry about that later. I had a week off, I was alone for one last night in the French Quarter, and I was going to enjoy it. My plan is coffee, dinner, drinks. Go to bed and wake up ready to drive. Good times.

The obvious place to start is Café du Monde. Café Au Lait and a plate of beignets, drowned under a mountain of powdered sugar. This is the life. I sit back and sip, calm amidst the constant rush of people. It feels like a caffeinated white noise machine.

The memories slide back again.

In that space of too much coffee and nowhere to be there lives a surplus of time to fall backwards into.

I fall back into a distant autumn. A New York autumn.

It was a few years ago, probably eight. I was full on into the whiskey and cigarette diet. Partly because I was trying to drown my sorrows and frustrations, partly because it was an easy escape.

Me and Francis, along with Cristopher, our original bass player, had found each other through the music. We’d moved into the sonic familiarity of each other, a kind of telepathy, and found our way to a common musical destination. Being in a band is a different kind of relationship but it’s still a relationship.

We weren’t sure about where we were going, but we knew we wanted to go. Through it all, in those first couple of years, we shared one desire. It screamed through our hearts, and beat through our blood, this desire for making music. We would see bands on stage, watch them perform, and we knew that is what we wanted. Eyes open, living and breathing the sound, it's where we always want to be. 

We started building momentum, playing bigger and better shows, but the upswings always come with downfalls, don’t they? One night, we had just played an amazing show at a small but very hip club, and then went to celebrate. That was the last time we saw Cristopher alive. None of us dealt with that very well.

I spent the next week in my room. It was winter, but it felt colder than it had ever felt. Especially in the shadows, where the slick humid chills pushed through icy wind teeth and started to wrap around your bones like frozen razors. I couldn’t bear to be at the funeral, but Francis convinced me to go. 

Rain, like a badly planned surprise, followed me to the corner café where I was to meet up with Francis. It was about a two-hour drive to New Haven, where Cristopher’s family lived, and where the services were to be held. On the way we sort of talked; about our music, if we still wanted to play, and about Cristopher. We spoke in broken paragraphs, touched with hints of something deeper that remained unsaid. Like building a structure without using anything solid or concrete. The silence was deep. 

And then the drinks were finished, the cigarettes were burned out. It was time to go to the funeral.

Francis drove, we sat in silence. The rain seemed to become a blanket, while the clouds shifted into a strange greenish haze. Thick with rain but threatening something more.

“Almost looks like tornado clouds.” Francis said.

“That would be perfect right now.” I muttered. “Cristopher would have wanted it this way.”

“As long as it waits until we’re done.” Francis responded.

We parked behind a row of black cars at Evergreen Cemetery. The rain was a light mist, and the path towards the office building was a trail of black umbrellas. We were two cars away from the hearse, but we knew the coffin had already been taken to its final location.

Francis had already started up the walk and I was about to run to catch up, but something stopped me. I smelled something horrible, like a backed-up cesspool, when something caught my eye. Did something in the hearse move? I stood in the rain, staring at the curtained back window. There wouldn’t be anyone back there, right?

The rain started coming down harder, I couldn’t see where Francis had gone. The street was empty. Slowly the back of the hearse opened, and out of the ill-lit interior a tattooed hand slid towards me, shaking, grasping. It was Cristopher’s hand. although emaciated, I recognized the flowers tattooed on the fingers and the inked flames circling the wrist. The broken black fingernails scratched through a trail of dried blood on the hearse’s floor panel while Cristopher’s other arm inched out as well.

I didn’t even register the shift in the weather, the mist turning into a downpour, my hair slick and covering my face, water pooling at my feet. Heavy clouds had descended on the cemetery and obscured it from the rest of the town. There was a wind, but it crept low, against my legs. I stared at his hands and arms, completely frozen in terror. I could make out the track marks, the tears in his shirt, and I realized how can the arms be getting closer while the rest of the body wasn’t getting closer at all...

All I could think about was once they realized they had forgotten the body in the hearse, would they return to find my body lying there; wrapped in those grotesque hands? 

Suddenly, a flash of lightning followed by crack of thunder, and then silence. Total silence. The rain stopped, the wind fell flat, the sounds of traffic in the distance, birds in the cemetery green, people visiting loved ones. All gone. All silent. Even the clouds held fast in the sky. 

I saw something, though, staring at those moving hands from the back of the hearse. I kept staring at the blood as the hands engulfed me. The broken nails and the blood. Cristopher’s blood. 

Was he trying to send a message?

My teeth hurt from clenching; my mouth was dry. Swallowing, I realized my heart was pounding up my chest and into the back of my throat. I felt dizzy.

The hands stopped, the arms slowly turned, wrists up. That’s where the blood was coming from. Slits in the wrist that were slowly letting rivulets of tired red.

We had been told his death was an overdose.

My eyes shut against the scene, hoping it would be gone when they opened. Instead of the blackness I had hoped for there was a splattering of visions, burnt into the back of my brain by my mind’s eye. A church on fire, a cross in flames. The cross flips over, becomes a dagger, the fire shifts into blood and the dagger is stuck into a wall. The wall splits and sheds black spiders and vomit, and that’s worse than the vision of my dead friend, so I opened my eyes.

The back of the hearse was closed, the rain was falling in a soft drizzle, Francis stood on the sidewalk giving me a quizzical look. The wind pushed against my back and the clouds sped grey across the skies.

Was it a vision, a hallucination, a waking dream? Everything was the same as before, except for a brownish fleck of something stuck on the sleeve of my suit jacket. I stared at it. It can’t be blood; I must have brushed against something earlier. I brushed it off and started towards Francis, inadvertently slowing to peer into the side window of the funeral coach. 

Empty. No bodies, no coffin, no ghosts, no blood.

“What the hell are you doing, Wills?” Francis asked as I moved up beside him. 

“I really need a drink.” 

“Later. After this.” Francis agreed.

As we stood to the side of the burial site, back a few feet to give family and relatives more space and room, I could’ve sworn I heard sounds coming out of the grave. Pushing out through the constant mutter of rain, and the somber tones of the priest’s eulogy. Not the scratching I’d heard before, or the thumping of my heart, but a tapping, a knocking. The rhythmic rap of bone on wood, and then a muffled whine. The beat shifted slowly until I was startled back to reality by a flash, a crack of thunder.

\*\*\*\*\*

I was back at the café.

Sitting up straight, I glanced around to see if anyone around me had noticed my flashback freak-out, but it didn’t seem like it. Here at Café du Monde, life moved as usual. A steady stream of tourists high on coffee and pigeons strung out on sugar.

Did I ever tell Francis about that vision? Share my thoughts and feelings about losing Cristopher with anyone? No. Of course not, Silence is fuckin' golden. I hadn’t thought about that episode for years. Why’d it come back now? Maybe the visit to the old homestead and playing some of Cristopher’s songs on this tour stirred things up. And Highway 61. Cristopher and I shared a love for some of the mythology lining this highway.

Shake it off, man. Drive until it fades away.

I ordered a coffee to go and left, thinking about my rough itinerary that showed a crooked line slicing north across the country. There was a room booked in Memphis, but not until tomorrow night. I wasn’t going to drive slowly, but I did need to take a little time for this trip. Tonight, I was hoping to find a place in Jackson where I could crash. I’d be there before dinner, so hopefully there would be a motel room waiting.

Tomorrow I was planning on making it out to Clarksdale. About two hours farther than Jackson, but it wasn’t a place where I wanted to spend the night. I was really going for only one reason; to pay my respects at The Crossroads. Yes, The Crossroads. The original intersection where Robert Johnson made his deal with the Devil Crossroads. I’d say a prayer or make a wish, because I wasn’t too in the mood to sell anything quite yet, but I figured it couldn’t hurt to get a little bit of mojo going.

An uneventful drive through flat mud fields and breaks of weeping willows. Roadkill and slow big rigs. Three hours to Natchez, and I was ready for another coffee. Every mile looks the same, green. Only the soundtrack changes. 

A stop for fuel; gasoline, sugar, and caffeine. Then back to the drive. I try to keep my eyes from glazing over against the repetition of nothingness. It’s hitting like some sad song stuck on repeat. I focus on the road and horizon over the mesmerizing steam of roadside coffee with destination getting tangled up between broken lines and the blind spots.

My thoughts move like the highway, they move towards Cristopher and the loss of a good friend.

The weather moves into rain, and it feels like a world of sorrow. I’ve made some bad choices in the past, but not like Cristopher did. 

We should have seen it coming and we should have been able to stop it from happening. I remember when Francis called me. I didn’t answer. I had that sinking feeling. 

Phone calls at three in the morning were always bad news.

In my bedroom I’d been laying on the floor, listening to the wind outside. The phone rung on the bedside table above me. I fumbled, reaching up, ignoring the ringing while going for the open pack of cigarettes. It was my ritual for a sleepless night.

I didn’t want to know what had happened or hear what the voice on the other end had to say. I just wanted the night to break through the window and cover me like a sunset, like a slow dream.

I got up and moved into the bathroom. Cold bathroom tiles against my feet.

Staring past the cracks and stains of the mirror at my reflection it starts to blur and move slightly back and forth. 

The light made my eyes sting, and I could feel that sting straight through to the back of my skull. My mind becoming some dark séance. Each breath felt like a prayer to some inner demon, some twisted angel. I slid to the floor as I listened to the message left.

Cristopher was dead. Overdose.

I opened my hands, looked down at my palms. Shaking fingers and skin so pale, and there's dust between my fingers. I let it go. 

I let go. He's gone.

Back into the drive, I swerve to keep in the lane. I need to stop these daydreams, or I’ll end up dead like some roadkill on the highway. 

That’s when I saw the sign, almost invisible by the side of the road. I would have missed it if I hadn’t been looking around to get my bearings back. I was maybe twenty miles to Vicksburg, but making good time, so I turned and drove up the road where the sign had been pointing. Wright Cemetery Estate Sale, written in black marker with a shaky hand.

I drove up a road which wasn’t quite a road, but a little better than a trail. Turned, following the arrows, and moving through an almost oasis of Dogwood trees made my way to the small church by the small graveyard. Not much to speak of, dusty trinkets, old ceramics, faded sweaters and coats. Some books about religion, and some vintage records praising the lord. I stopped at a slightly cracked cement angel that had been part of a bird bath and chuckled as I imagined showing up at our next gig with that.

I was about to turn and leave when I spotted the box of musical instruments. Not much to mention; a couple of ivory white recorders, a triangle, rusted, and a red portable Casiotone with a broken keyboard. Then, sitting behind the box, I saw the guitar. It wasn’t a full size, which is why I missed it at first, but it wasn’t broken. 

I picked it up. It looked like a European parlor guitar, maybe 19th century. I slowly turned it by the neck, looking it over. It felt good. Smooth and worn. Like it had been used but cared for. The strings, made from gut, were all there, though loose, and the bridge was solid. It was about 30 inches or so; great for kids, but I’d seen them used by friends as travel guitars. This would be perfect for playing on the road.

The engraving, or art, on the front was a little peculiar, but sort of added to that Highway 61 Mystique. Two figures, silhouetted, above the bridge, and two smaller figures below. They seemed like they were dancing maybe, like happy scarecrows in a field. Something out of a farmer’s folk tale. 

“How much?” I asked the elderly woman sitting behind a low daisy tablecloth covered table as I put the small guitar in front of her.

She looked up at me, chin resting on folded hands, over rhinestone touched cat’s eyeglasses. Her hair curly thin and light lilac blue.

“I don’t remember ever seeing that one before, but I can tell it’s a special one. You mark my words.” Her eyes twinkled. She was getting ready for the haggle, I suspected.

“I thought it might be.” I smiled and reached for my wallet. 

I pulled out a twenty. Got to start somewhere.

She shook her head.

“Thirty?” I asked.

Another no, but this time she pushed the guitar towards me saying, “You’re a musician, aren’t you.”

“I am.”

“Then I’ll tell you what. It’ll cost you a song.”

One song and an hour later, I was pulling into the parking lot of the Trustright Motel. Exhausted, road weary, and ready for bed. Skip the whiskey, it’s time to crash.

Lying on the bed, I start to drift along with the passing shadows cast by headlights moving down the street below. It wasn’t as exciting as I had once thought it would be, the folk myths of Route 61 having captured me as a young teenager and probably the stories that spurred me on to become a guitarist in the first place.

It wasn’t because of Bob Dylan and his *Highway 61 Revisited*, though that was part of my early musical diet. It was more thanks to my father, who’d been known to whip out some deep Delta blues on occasion, and my mother, who even though she had already started slipping away into some pseudo-Christian world of her own making, had managed to instill within me a deep appreciation and knowledge of Louisiana folklore. From tales of the Rougarou to stories of Marie LaVeau.

But nothing had captured my imagination more than the stories of Robert Johnson and his deal with the Devil. While my classmates had talked about wanting to visit Hollywood or Hawaii, Disney World or Times Square, I wanted to make my way to the Crossroads. 

I sat up fast, hearing a sound outside. I looked over at the clock, three a.m. ... I must’ve dozed off without realizing it.

I was on the second floor of a disgustingly humid and cheap motel on the outskirts of Jackson, Mississippi. It was cheaper than staying in the city, and I was on a tight budget. 

That noise again, a tap, sharp, at the window. Like glass on glass. I fumbled for the bedside lamp, hit the switch, and a dull light brought the room in to view.

Nothing was out of place inside, my bag was on the chair by the desk, the small guitar angled against the wall behind it. Everything where I’d left it. I was still dressed, laying over the covers, so I jumped up ungracefully and inched towards the heavy blinds covering the sliding glass door to the small one-man balcony. It was cold. Extremely cold. The room felt like an icebox.

I slowly pulled back the curtains until I could peek out.

Nothing. Darkness and a sliver of light that was the moon. The room overlooked a quiet street and a row of darkened storefronts. A traffic light flashed yellow to the left, and the streetlights caught no movement on the sidewalks below. I realized I had been holding my breath, so I let it out slow and moved back to the bed. I felt the thick warmth return, but now it was too thick.

I sat up, back to the headboard. Knees up and holding my pillow in front of my chest. The light was still on, the room was quiet, there was nothing outside. So why did I still feel like there was? I could feel the steam of my breath rise, as if the chill had returned, but only right there, in front of me.

I decided to push it off with bad TV and worse coffee. Or maybe the coffee could wait. I was already feeling that tight shaking nerve rush, I hadn’t even had a cup. Maybe it’s just a vibe off the TV, like a late-night radiation high. Maybe certain channels are more addictive than others are. Maybe it’s just the Motel room. There’s always something inherently creepy about a small-town motel room. Maybe it’s just a defective AC ... 

Wait. This room doesn’t have an AC!

There’s a shift in the light off to my left, where the guitar is. I turn to look at it, everything seems normal. Back to the tv, another peripheral flicker. I look again, this time slower. Pretending to not look, just moving my eyes in that direction.

There, the shadow on the wall behind the guitar, it moved. 

Goosebumps appear across my arms. I felt the back of my neck tighten, chills shooting down my spine. Is there something there? A spider or a rat? A lizard? Were there lizards in Mississippi?

I sat up and stared directly at the shadow. And the shadow started to get deeper and expand.

It happened in a couple of seconds that felt like an hour and would stay with me for the rest of my life. The shadow grew, stretching up the wall towards the ceiling, straining as if one end was caught on the tuning pegs. The lamp beside me flickered for a second as if it was battling the darkness in the corner for control of the room, and then with a complete absence of sound, the shadow snapped off the guitar and hit the ceiling, spreading like a black paint ball splatter.

I screamed, or at least, I tried to scream, and pushed myself off the other side of the bed. My back hit the floor, my head hit the wall, I looked up at the ceiling, and nothing was there. 

No blackness, no shadow, no marks at all.

Shaking, I stood up, and looked at the guitar. It leaned silent against the wall as if nothing had happened. There was no way I was going to let sleep arrive after that.

\*\*\*\*\*

Feeling high from adrenalin and fear, I left the room and walked outside. A cigarette would help, a whiskey would help more, but all I had was a shot of vodka back in the room and coffee I didn’t really want to drink. It felt like I was spinning at a high speed, barely able to keep my feet on the ground. I walked around the entire motel twice. Sometimes it seems hard to believe in gravity.

I spent the rest of the night not sleeping. When I tried to sleep, it felt like I was waking up. When I lay on my back it felt like I might drift off straight into that blackness. It started getting a little fuzzy around the edges of my vision by the time the clock clicked to seven, making me feel like everything was part of some strange television show. But no naps, it’s time to go.

I pack quick, grab the guitar, which is thankfully solid and head for the coffee shop downstairs. Just a little help to push the fuzz back to zero. It wasn’t the best coffee, but it was so much better than ‘maybe I’m not alone in my motel room’ instant coffee. One cup while sitting, clearing my head at the counter, and another to go, with a side of hash browns to help soak it up. 

I moved slowly across the parking lot towards the rental car, knowing if I moved faster, I’d walk right into the migraine that was hovering right in front of me. I was so busy avoiding my headache I almost walked right into a woman, standing in an empty space, staring out towards the Highway. Her fiery dyed red hair cut in a straight bob just above her shoulders, with scattered strands of black and midnight blue mixed in. Standing almost as if she had been waiting for me.

Green eyes, fingernails colored to match. She stood, stance slightly askew, leaning to the side and holding her hands clasped in front of her like a pretty-please. She smiled, lips a shade redder than her hair. She would have stood out anywhere, but here, some twenty miles outside city limits, she definitely stood out.

Black leather jacket over a black shirt, the white strap of a backpack slung over one shoulder. Black cropped trousers over black heeled boots. She meant business, and it seemed that business was me.

“You’re going up Highway 61.” It wasn’t a question.

I attempted to walk casually towards her, but I was pretty sure she wasn’t buying it. “Yeah, how’d you know?”

She smiled, and slid on a pair of sunglasses, black lenses inside solid white frames. “You look like a musician, and there’s no other reason for a musician to be here.”

“Fair enough. What about you? You don’t look like you should be here either. Where are you going”

This time she took a step towards me, before stopping, left arm across her chest to hold her right arm, a coy tilt of the head, “Depends on if I can go with you.”

She punctuated the sentence with a pantomimed hitch-hiking gesture, thumb pointing North.

I had to think about this one. Not because I didn’t want to accommodate, but because I had planned on this being a solitary trip. It might be nice to have some company though, someone who could help with the driving, and she looked like she had some stories to tell.

“Why not.” I shrugged, “Memphis sound good to you?”

“Sounds just right.”

“Okay.” I looked around. “You have any luggage? Suitcases?”

She swung her leather backpack in front of her, patting the top. “This one’s all I need.”

“I’m making a stop in Clarksdale. Hope you don’t mind.”

“The Devil’s Crossroads? You are on a journey, aren’t you. I’ve been dying to get back there myself. Let’s go.” She winks, “My name’s Octavia, by the way.”

“William, but you can call me Wills.” I didn’t tell everyone my nickname, but for some reason it felt like I could tell her.

“Well, hell, Wills. Let’s hit the road.”

She didn’t talk much on the way to Clarksdale, which was fine by me. It was strangely comfortable; unlike the awkward silences I’d experienced with people too many times in the past. A little bit of small talk, but nothing diving deeper than weather observations and radio station shifts.

The Crossroads was interesting. A memorial to a legend in the middle of a small town, shrouded by a quiet hint of depression. It didn’t feel like I thought it would feel. It didn’t feel like there was any magic, mojo, or electricity. There was nothing left if this was indeed the right place. It was like an empty lot left behind after the circus leaves town. Nothing but a hollow homage.

Still, I parked in an empty space near the corner of the highway road and Octavia and I walked up to the tall marker planted at the corner of Highway 61 and Highway 49.

“It’s not here.” Octavia whispered.

I knew exactly what she meant. “So where is it?”

“Maybe that’s something we need to find.” She answered. “Maybe it’s on the way to Memphis.”

“You’re saying it’s time to go, right?” I smiled.

“I’m saying I’m hungry, and lunch in Bluff City can’t be beat.”

We were about a hundred miles out from Memphis, when a car behind us started leaning on the horn. I had no idea there was another car on the road, but it passed, fast, and inches away. Still blaring it pulled in front without slowing. It didn’t speed away, though, it kept at the same speed as we were, which was just over 65 MPH. An older vehicle, no license plate, and I couldn’t tell if the driver was male or female. The windows were dirty, speckled with bugs and mud.

It was an old olive-green Dodge Dart, but other than the grime it seemed to be in excellent shape. I barely remembered it, by my dad had a similar car. Think it was black or red, though. 

“Stop!” Octavia yelled, as the car in front suddenly slowed to almost stopping. I slammed on the brakes, and we jolted up and back into our seats.

“What the hell?” I yelled, gesturing uselessly at the green Dodge, as its brake lights flashed red before it accelerated and sped away, doing probably close to 80 by the time it vanished around the next highway bend. Deep breath, car start, continue. 

I looked over at Octavia, she seemed a little shaken.

“Did you know who that was?” I asked Octavia, as she seemed slightly unnerved by the strange drive-by.

“No.” she said flatly, staring at the road ahead. I wasn’t sure if I believed her, but I nodded, and we drove in silence until Memphis rose into view.

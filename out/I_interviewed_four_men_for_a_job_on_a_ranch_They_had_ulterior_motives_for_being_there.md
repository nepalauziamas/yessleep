The four men walked into my office and sat down at the long, oak table. Atop my desk is a small vase with a flower, an uneaten apple and a small cage containing my two pet mice.

This was the second time that these men had been here. They had all done well during their first job interview and so had been called back for a group interview. I own a fairly large ranch and the job they had all applied for involved looking after the horses in the stables and supervising the ranch hands. 

"Thanks everyone for returning for a second interview. I appreciate your time", I said to the four men sitting across the desk from me. 

Three of them were giving me direct eye contact, while the man on the far right was staring up at the deer skull that hung on the wall behind me, a slight smile on his face. I acknowledged this.

"You like her?", I asked him and he nodded, "She is the first deer I ever hunted. I was eleven at the time. Do you hunt?

I liked to get to know my potential new employees and so used this as an icebreaker and to delve deeper into who I was interviewing.

"It is a guilty pleasure of mine", he responded with a grin. 

"Good. I hope the rest of you are comfortable with taking an animal's life, as it may be something you have to do in this job. If a creature is attacking any of my horses, then I need to know that y'all are able to defend them. Especially if it is my prized red horse".

The other three men nodded towards me, indicating that they were capable of taking the life of a creature. 

"Okay good. Now, as you all know, I have interviewed each of you as individuals, but now I want to see how you work as a team. Teamwork is vital out here on the ranch, and so if y'all can't work as a group, you may as well head out that door now", I said, as I gestured towards the door. 

The man sitting to the very left of the table spoke up and said,

"I think I can speak for everyone here and say that we all prefer to work as a team", he said as he looked toward the other three interviewee's. 

They all nodded in agreement. 

"All right then, that's what I want to hear", I said, "Now, to kick things off, I want everyone to quickly introduce themselves and tell one another a bit about yourselves. You go first and we'll move down the line".

I gestured towards the man sitting at the left end of my desk. He was wearing blue jeans and a plaid red shirt. His long ponytail was tied up by a leather strap that was fashioned into a bow. He cleared his throat and started to speak.

"Hello, my name is Peter Lence and I have a lifetime of experience working on ranches and farms. I believe I can bring a wealth of knowledge and invaluable expertise to this job. It's the job I have been waiting my whole lifetime for".

He stopped speaking and I gestured for the man sitting to his right to introduce himself. This man was wearing a tan stetson hat and was chewing on a toothpick. He pushed the small wooden stick to one side of his mouth and starting speaking.

"Hello everyone. I'm Warwick Warburton, and I'm looking for a bit of a career change. I have experience in managing people but I am hoping to challenge myself by working out on the ranch".

The next candidate began to speak once Warwick was finished. He wore a thick leather jacket, but you could still tell that he was a particularly thin man. His face was gaunt and he had long, slender arms.

"Hello, I am Fredrick Arthur Mine and I have had just over 5 years experience working on a farm. I am used to working with animals and with other people".

I turned to face the pale looking man at the end of the table. The man who was interested in the deer skull. He looked me in the eye and spoke.

"I'm Thade Edath and I grew up on a ranch and so know what it takes to work and run one. I treat each job as a matter of life and death, so you can count on me to give my everything".

I thanked everyone for introducing themselves and then I asked them the next question.

"Now, one more question before we move into some team building exercises. Could each of you quickly share a challenge you faced, or something you did well at your previous job. You first, Peter".

"Well, this may make me look bad, but I'll share anyway. At my previous job, I was known to be quite tough on the workers. I wouldn't tolerate anybody being slack and letting the team down. There was a real issue where I worked as it seemed as if every worker was always off sick. So, I would constantly pester them to come into work even if they felt under the weather. I was always pestering. In fact, I gained a certain nickname because of it. 

I had a backpack that had my name tag on it, and some of the workers changed what it said on that name tag. They inserted an 'S' into the middle of it, changing my name from Peter to Pester. So, I guess my point is, I had to learn to cope with the fact that I wasn't liked by all employees, but it wasn't about popularity, it was about doing the job well. I also had to learn to do the job by myself, cause everyone was always sick, so I was the only person I could fully rely on".

"Hmm, fascinating", I responded, "You would get along great with Conquest, my white horse. She is always pestering me for food".

Peter let out a slight chuckle and then turned to face Warwick to indicate it was his turn to answer the question.

"I used to work at a conversatory. Y'know, tending to the plants and whatnot. My favourites were the sword ferns, but anyway, one of the challenges at this particular job was the constant fighting and bickering amongst other workers. Everyday, it was constant. Someone was always in some conflict with someone else. So, I guess the challenge for me was not getting involved in the petty squabbles of the other employees".

"Very good", I said once he finished speaking, and then turned to face the next potential employee.

The very thin Fredrick Arthur was next to speak.

"I can't think off the top of my head, a challenge I faced, let me think. Hmmm, oh yes. I know something I achieved. Worker productivity. I increased it at my old job. 

You know how each day we lose an hour of precious work time to eat and rest? Well, by teaching the staff the benefits of a fasting diet, I was able to convince them to skip their lunch break and to keep working through their allotted time out. Productivity increased and more work was achieved.

Of course, I didn't mind missing lunch either. You see, I use scales each day to weigh out my portions of food that I will consume throughout the day. That's how I keep my trim figure. So yeah, that's my biggest achievement while working at the conservatory".

Fredrick stopped talking and flashed me a grin, revealing some yellowing teeth.

"Maybe you should try that on Shadow, my black horse. He definitely needs to be taught how to eat less.", I replied, kind of worried about the legality of not allowing workers to have breaks. 

Fredrick then turned towards the pale man, Thade, and said "Beat that!".

"I'll certainly try", Thade replied before giving a detailed answer to my question.

"The ranch that I used to work at was run by an elderly man who had lived at the ranch his entire life. Including me, there were only another four people that lived and worked at the ranch. We all worked hard and for little reward, but it was an honest living. 

That all changed on that cold winter's night. The elderly man that ran the place must've lit a candle or two for a little bit of extra warmth, but his memory wasn't what it once was. He forgot to blow them out before turning in for the night. 

I awoke to the smell of smoke and the crackling of fire. The sleeping quarters were ablaze. I jumped out of bed and rushed to wake up the others. The fire was burning too hot and I couldn't reach them in time. Death came to them all.

The entire ranch went up in flames and every other worker and the elderly man perished in the inferno. I did manage to save one life that night though. A horse. The pale one. I was able to lead her out of the stable and to safety. 

After that, my life crumbled. I took a long time to recover from that horrific event. I really thought that it was the end of the world, but of course, it wasn't. 

I have managed to grieve and move on from it all. That's why I applied for this job here. So yeah, that's the biggest challenge I had to face".

Thade stopped speaking and looked down at the desk. There was silence in my office for a moment. I knew I had to break it.

"I am so sorry to hear that. That is a very difficult thing to have to deal with. But, you are strong and I congratulate you on being here today. And I applaud your efforts to save one of the horses. I too have a pale horse and I couldn't bear to think of anything happening to her".

There was silence once more. I knew I had to continue on with the interview and so I began to ask the next question. 

"I am going to have to move us along. Now, the next portion of the interview is the group and team building activities that I warned you about earlier. So, what I need you to do is…"

"Hahahahaha".

I quickly looked over to where the noise was coming from. Thade was staring directly at me and had begun to laugh. It was a deep laugh that seemed to indicate that he knew something I didn't. 

"Hahahahaha", he continued. 

"What's the matter?, I asked, "Is something funny"?

"Hahahahahah".

This time, the laughing was louder and I realised it wasn't just the one person laughing. It was all of them. All four of the interviewee's were now looking at me and laughing.

"Hahahahahaha-".

The laughter stopped abruptly. I stared back at them all, confused. Thade then spoke.

"If you haven't figured it out yet, then you never will. We gave you all the clues".

"What the hell are you talking about?", I asked.

"We have a team building exercise of our own to attend to. Thank you for your time".

Each of the four men then started to stare at one of the objects on my desk. Except Peter. He looked straight towards me. Then, a few things happened simultaneously. 

The apple on my desk, the one Fredrick was looking at, started to shrivel before my very eyes. Its skin wrinkled and tightened. Then, it cracked open into two pieces, revealing a black, rotten core.

The flower in the vase also began to shrivel. Thade was looking straight at it. Its petals fell down onto the desk and its stem slumped downwards. The flower was dead. 

Warwick stared at the two mice in their cage, and without any warning, or any sign of aggression, the two rodents started attacking each other violently. They crashed into each other, a flurry of claws and teeth. 

While all those events happened, I felt something within myself. My stomach felt queasy, and I had a sudden urge to throw up. I swung around in my chair and vomited all over the floor. Peter continued to stare at me. My sickness got stronger, and I felt weak from the nausea. I dropped to the floor, my stomach in a great deal of pain. 

Then, in perfect unison, all four men rose up out of their seats. Like a well trained squadron, they all turned around at the same time and walked out of my office door. As my eye contact with Peter was broken, the sickness I had just felt suddenly passed. 

I got up and chased the four men. They had only just walked out of the office and so they should've just been in the next room. But they weren't. I felt my breathing rapidly increase and my heart beat rose to a speed that sounded like a horse galloping. 

I faced the window and saw the four men were now outside, which seemed impossible in that amount of time.. They were walking towards the stables. Towards the horses. 

I didn't have to react and all I could do was watch on as they all entered the stables. I was afraid of what they were doing in there, but I was too scared to actually go out to see. They were clearly very powerful men. 

Then, almost as quickly as they had gone inside the stable, all four reemerged. They were all atop a different horse. A white horse. A red horse. A black horse. A pale horse. 

As soon as each horse smelled the fresh outside air, they turned their canter into a gallop and took off in the direction away from where I was. All I could do was watch on in horror. I now knew exactly what was happening. I felt a strong sense of dread within my being.

I looked out across the open land that was the ranch. I watched the horses ride towards the horizon, before disappearing into it. The four horsemen had begun their ride.

Imagine realising yourself caught between two worlds.

Fiction.

And reality.

Imagine finding yourself.

Remembering who you are.

Only for you to wake up, and he's there.

Taking pieces from you.

Every time.

You wake up.

Every time you remember yourself.

He continues to cut.

The coffee was a mistake.

I knew my bright idea to get a latte so close to curfew wasn’t smart. But I was thirsty—and I do stupid and illogical things when I’m in the need of caffeine. In my mind I was building the perfect plan.

The campus Starbucks was a two minute walk from my last class, and if I did the calculations right in my head, it would take five minutes to order and get the coffee depending on how busy it was, and then another ten minutes to get home before the doors shut. I’d get in by the skin of my teeth with an iced latte and my head still connected to my body. 

That’s what I thought, at least. 

Though I wasn’t expecting my plan to fall apart.  

There are certain things you can’t predict. I believe people can foresee things like natural disasters or disasters’ in general, but tiny, miniscule things that happen every day and can’t be helped? Not so much. For example, I hadn’t expected the girl in front of me who had spent the whole time loudly talking on her phone about some Tik-Tok she had found funny, to suddenly out of nowhere projectile her undigested lunch in a shower of green sludge. 

I could tell by the colour of the barf the girl was a health food freak.

Naturally, patrons started freaking out.

The barista’s behind the counter went into a sort of meltdown which added a ten minute wait time while they swarmed around cleaning up the barf and tending to the girl, dancing between taking orders and mopping up the mess. By the time I was regretting giving into my coffee cravings I was at the front of the line struggling to remember why I had even stepped inside in the first place. I ordered an iced latte quickly, my stomach twisting when the stink of stale vomit hit the back of my nose and throat. Suddenly, the coffee was no longer appetising. 

I was screwed. Five minutes to get home and that wasn’t going to happen. My hands were grasping for my purse buried in my bag when my phone started angrily vibrating in my shorts pocket. Trying my best to ignore it, I dove into my purse for loose cash. The barista handed over my coffee with a friendly smile. She looked to be around my age, maybe a little older.

 Definitely cute. If I were in any other situation I would have asked for her number, or maybe her Insta profile. At that moment, however, all I could do was manage a grin through my teeth.

“Is it to take out?” She asked.

“Yep!” I couldn’t resist glancing at the clock above the counter.

Two minutes to 5.

I was never going to make it.

The girl followed my gaze, her smile fading when she caught my expression. “That’ll be 3.50.”

From the look on her face, the barista was pretending not to notice my phone.

I could tell who it was by the pattern of the vibrations jolting my pocket.

Cole.

I had never understood my housemate’s obsession with following the draconian rules put in place at our student boarding house—as well as his painfully obvious sucking up to our housemother who was also  the devil incarnate. Think of Matilda’s Miss Trunchbull, add some Miss Hannigan from Annie, mix them up a little and you get hell itself. That was Karen. I didn’t have the luxury of growing up with parents so I worked my ass off at school for a scholarship. Still, the college dorms were expensive and I didn’t have that kind of cash, not to mention the college was refusing to even acknowledge me.

So much for “We care for all our students!”

I’d already gotten the scholarship so I was desperate.

That’s how I found St Abby’s Boarding House.

I thought I’d found the perfect housemates. Living in a student house with a bunch of freshmen and venturing into college life with them by my side. It was every student’s dream, right? To find the perfect housemates. I don't know if it was pure luck or some crazy coincidence, but they also happened to be in my class: Introduction to Creative Writing – The Craft of Plot and Characters.

Though we had collectively come to realise St Abbey’s wasn’t the proverbial light at the end of the tunnel we had been looking for. Not an escape from our shitty lives. Instead, a nightmare in disguise.

A prison.

“Are you going to answer that?” The barista asked when I handed over the cash.

"No," I said, grabbing the coffee. “Thanks.”

I was twisting around and making a break for the door when the barista yelled after me.

“Hey, if you’re in trouble—”

The door slammed before she could get her words out, and I found myself in the early evening commute. It was Summer time so my college town was flooded with tourists and I had to push through them. I could just about glimpse the clock tower in the centre of the city.

Two minutes to five. In my muddled thoughts I really thought if I sprinted I might make it. Throwing myself into a run, I headed down the main street and across the road, bounding in front of awaiting traffic. I was in the track team in my sophomore year of high school—and yet somehow I couldn’t propel my arms and legs faster. I downed the coffee as I ran and it was hot and perfect, dripping down my throat.

My phone rang again, and this time I pulled it out, slamming it to my ear.

“Ally.” Cole hissed, his voice collapsing in static, “Where the hell are you?”

"I was getting coffee." I slowed into a fast-walk, trying to suck in breaths of air.

“Getting coffee?” Cole whisper-shrieked. I could tell he was secretly using his phone, interference pricking my ear.  “Are you fucking insane? If you don't get your ass in here pronto, we’re all—”

“Dead.” I finished for him. “Yeah, I know.”

“Ally, if one of us screws up we all do,” Cole let out a bitter laugh. “And you just broke curfew.”

Pushing past a couple, I tightened my grip on my phone. “I’ll be there in two minutes.”

“I’m not covering for you.”

I had to bite back a hiss. “I didn’t expect you to!”

“You implied it.”

“Cole.” I gritted out. “Unlike you, I don’t spend every waking moment of my life crawling up that crazy bitch’s—"

The bastard put the phone down on me.

I shoved my phone back in my pocket and propelled into a run.

I could finally glimpse St Abbey’s in the distance, old fashioned exterior sticking out between modern builds next to it. I’d been impressed when I first started. In my mind it almost felt like I was starting Hogwarts—at least a much smaller version.  It looked exactly like it did in the pamphlet. It rose from behind the trees like a mountain, eye catching, ominous and foreboding. Dark brick with ornate details inlaid in the cement and mortar, twisting vines crawling up the sides, like the ground itself was trying to swallow it into oblivion.
A
 It was every student’s fantasy, dark academia at its best. Despite crumbling buildings and archways, modern like windows stood out, catching the sun dancing across the horizon.

There were two buildings. The main boarding house, and Karen’s office. Each building was attached by cobblestone pathways, brick that looked faded, weathered with age and covered with ivy and roses, another indication that it had been there a while. I had loved the whole Victorian aesthetic and the huge expanse of grass and trees, but now looking at it, pushing through the iron gate and stumbling down the pathway to the main entrance, it looked like a prison. As I was expecting, the main door was locked when I grabbed the handle. Fuck. 

The main door was a no-go. I wasn’t the first to break curfew and I wouldn’t be the last. Zach had broken it during our first semester when he’d been pulled to a frat party and ultimately left, choosing his life over college girls and kegs. Luckily, he’d slipped in through the back entrance and Karen had been none the wiser. Tipping my head back, my gaze went to my bedroom window. I’d left the light on. I half wondered if I was brave enough to attempt to climb.

There was no way I could climb that high.

When I crashed through the side gate this time, and darted to the back of the house, I could hear music playing. Mika’s Grace Kelly drifted through the windows from the Alexa in the kitchen—and so did Marin’s singing. She wasn’t the best of singers, but her voice was enough to soothe me as she fumbled around in the kitchen, doing her assigned jobs, washing up and cleaning away dinner.  I found my lips moving with the lyrics as I pressed myself against the wall and moved slowly toward the door.

“I could be brown, I could be blue, I could be violet sky

I could be hurtful, I could be purple, I could be anything you like

Gotta be green, gotta be mean, gotta be everything more—”

When the music shut off, I froze, and risking it, I darted to the back entrance and grabbed the handle.

Also locked.

Fuck.

“What are you doing?” Karen’s voice sent my heart into my throat, but thankfully it was Marin she was chewing out. “I made it clear personal music is forbidden. You listen to the radio or an audiobook.”

“It’s Pandora.” Marin said.

“Excuse me?”

Karen wasn’t a fan of us talking back.

“Pandora.” She repeated. “It’s—”

“Stand at the table.”

“But I’m washing up.”

“And I’m doing role call. Stand at the table.”

Shuffling feet indicated Marin dragging herself to her usual spot.

“It’s a radio station. It plays bad pop songs all the time. Marin wasn’t listening to her music.”

Zach’s voice faded as I headed back to the main entrance and tried the door again with a hiss. Still locked. I didn’t even look at the time-- I didn’t dare. There was only one way in, and that was the back door when someone slipped out to put the garbage out. If I stayed outside and waited, surely I could sneak in. When I made my way back to the back, I straightened up, glimpsing my housemates through the window. There they were, the four of them standing around the main kitchen table, heads down, arms by their sides. Like soldiers. 

Marin and Zach standing on one side, and then Shai, Cole, and a very noticeable gap between them where I should have been standing. My housemates looked miserable, and I could tell they were close--- so close to losing it and walking out.  We had talked about it-- reporting our housemother for treating us like orphans in a bad Disney musical. But then we had no place to go. College was a once in a lifetime opportunity, especially for broke students already up to their eyeballs in debt. Who also happened to come from either estranged parents, or none at all. 

So, we were stuck.

Cole was standing closest to the door, as usual hiding behind his baseball cap. When Karen strode over to him, he lifted his head, ready to speak, probably to sing like a canary that I’d gone to get a coffee. Instead of looking at our housemother, however, Cole’s gaze met mine.

He looked surprised for a moment, his eyes widening, and I noticed his demeanour drastically change, from slumped and barely awake, to awake and aware. His expression went from amused to pissed, and to smug. I could tell from the slight curl on his lip that he was about to screw all of us over. I ducked, squeezing my eyes shut. Fuck, fuck, fuck.

I waited in tense silence, praying he wouldn’t. If it was the sake of all five of us, he wouldn’t—surely. But I knew deep down that he would. When I heard the back door open, footsteps following, I think a little piece of me died. "No, Cole, stay inside." 

Karen’s tone was calm.

Retreating footsteps told me my housemate had been eager to watch the show.

Bastard.

"Allison?”

Straightening up, I felt ridiculous, like an idiot kid. 

“Ally!”

Karen's smile was strained. The woman reminded me of a witch, late fifties with greying hair and a stick-like figure. "May I ask what you’re doing out here past curfew? You’re twenty five minutes late.”

I held my breath and pasted on my best smile. “Sorry. I was studying late.”

“Were you aware of the time?”

“No,” I lied, “No, my phone’s been acting up.”

“I see.” Karen nodded. “Allison, you are aware of the rules of St Abby’s Boarding House, correct?”

“Yes.” I clutched my bag strap tighter.

She took a step towards me, and I resisted against cringing back. “Would you recite them for me?”

I opened my mouth, ready to speak, ready to recite the rules when a sharp pain sliced down the back of my head. It was the kind of pain I'd never felt before, white-hot and agonising. For a moment the words were stuck in my throat, and I was struggling to remember the rules. But the pain continued, burning hotter and hotter until I couldn't breathe. It felt like-- it felt like my brain had been set alight. Still, though, the rules rushed from my lips in a sharp hiss.

I was focusing on Karen, I was trying to figure out her expression, her narrowed eyes and curled lips. But my eyes blurred, the world around me drifting in and out of focus. I blinked once and then twice, and the pain was still there, drilling into my skull. It was relentless and cruel like a vice-grip had taken hold of my brain and wasn't letting go. 

At first, I  thought Karen was the one doing it. 

Maybe she really was a witch, were my panicked thoughts screaming at me. Though as the world around me swam, things started to make less sense-- and that was including her.

Karen's face blurred in and out of existence, and then she was moving, like a still image, back and forth. Glitching, I thought hysterically. She was glitching.

 A bird swooping across the sky above came to a standstill, and the trees rustling in the breeze-- stopped. I felt myself backing away. I felt a scream clawing at my throat, but it collapsed into sudden white noise around me. "Allison?" Karen's voice was suddenly bleeding into my ears, far too loud, thundering in my skull. 

I blinked again, and she was standing in front of me, but her face, everything about her, was—was glitching. "Allison, I expect you to follow the rules set in place. Do you understand me?" 

"Yes." I heard my own voice, but it wasn't coming out of my mouth. It felt and sounded distant, like my own voice wasn’t my own. It felt like the ground beneath me was crumbling away, and I was standing in nothing—an expanse of oblivion. I couldn’t scream, couldn’t move, my thoughts at a sudden standstill. It was like falling through a crack between reality and something else, something hollow. 

All I could think was – pain.

 There was so much pain, and I would rather die than feel it. I would rather claw into my skull and rip out my brain if it meant I didn’t have to endure the fire blazing in my head.  The sound of running water came over me, and reality seemed to flitter around me, bleeding into senseless shapes and shadows. When the pain dulled to a sharp thump at the back of my head, I was standing in the kitchen, suddenly, squished between Cole and Shai. The world had continued around me, and yet it still felt wrong. 

A voice shattered the silence, and Shai was leaning into me, his spiky black hair tickling the back of my neck. Shai was Asian-American, and his parents were originally from China. They had abandoned him for a life in England and he'd found St Abby's.

"We're getting out of here tonight."

"What?" I heard my own voice, but my lips didn't move.

He nudged me, but I felt disconnected from my own body, like I was flying.

Something was wrong.

Something was... really wrong—and I was the only one who noticed the world bleeding around us.

"Could you be any less subtle?" Shai hissed, keeping his head down. “Tonight. We’re out of here.”

"She's a freakshow." Marin hissed from opposite me. The girl was tying her curls into a ponytail with sharp twitching movements, a scowl on her lips, “I’m not even allowed to wear my hair down.”

"Agreed." Zach said, across the table. "This is child abuse."

“We’re nineteen.” Shai lifted his head, shooting the boy a look.

"Still child abuse!"

"What was that?" Karen twisted around, and the world seemed to stabilise for a moment.

"Nothing!" Zach gave a sarcastic salute. "I’m just amazed at how well you’ve managed to simulate actual child labour. It’s like – wow. I actually feel like one of us chimney boys in that old musical.”

“Zach!” Marin elbowed him.

“You mean Oliver.” Cole muttered.

Luckily, Karen didn’t hear their exchange, too busy swiping her finger down the dining table for dust.

The world jumped again, and this time the windows were dark. It was night. I was standing in front of the faucet and my hands were dripping wet. Cole was leaning on the counter.

In his hands was a wash cloth. 

“How about it, Ally?” His eyes glistened with amusement, but behind him, the kitchen was fading in and out. When I looked down the floor was the normal kitchen tiles I’d always known, and then it was nothing. I was standing in nothing. And around me, there was nothing—nothing to hold onto, nothing to stop me falling. “Ally?” Cole’s voice snapped me out of it and I drew in a breath.

I was losing my mind.

Disconnected from myself, severed from the world I thought I knew.

I was already speaking, my words sounded like they were in the past.

“Shouldn’t you be crawling around Karen?”

"Funny." Cole's voice. He moved close, the phantom stink of his cologne choking my throat.

"I know about your little plan."

"Oh, yeah?" My voice echoed. "And what? Are you going to tattle?"

"Tell me where you guys are planning on going, and maybe I won't."

I paused. “We’re getting out of here.”

“Seriously?” He hissed. “Wait, who?”

“All of us.”

“So not me?” I sensed him getting closer, a shadow looming.

“You’re really leaving without me? With that witch?”

Something about his words felt strange, like they had severed something inside me.

That pain was back, but it was worse.

Cole was standing right in front of me, but I swore if I looked closer, I could have sworn right behind him, I could see.. something. I could see a window being opened, and through that window was what looked like a tiny TV screen flickering, the static and bright colours of a children’s television show.

“Ally?” His voice reverberated.

“You guys aren’t leaving me are you?”

Opening my mouth to answer, I couldn’t. 

I couldn’t because Cole was no longer there, the St Abby House Kitchen blinking away like it never existed. I was falling for a moment, unsure where I was, who I was, what I was—before the stink of sea water was so prominent in my senses, drowning my nose and throat until it was rousing me from a slumber I didn’t realise I had fallen into.

Names and faces fell away, bleeding into shadows and only one thought occupied my brain. A dream, I thought, my head spinning, strange words and names still dancing on my tongue only to fade when I fully came to myself.

Just a dream.

I sat up, blinking in darkness, only to smash my head on something wooden.

I didn’t feel the pain of the impact, though—I only felt phantom pain from my dream.

Unlike the dream the pain was real, striking in my skull and pulsing in my temples.

It was a strange kind of pain, like something was there, sticking into the back of my skull, the sharp blade of a knife, and yet there was nothing. Phantom pain yet it felt so real.

The loud thunk sound of my head hitting the low ceiling  sent my heart into my throat and I scrambled up, grasping for the oil lamp I'd kept hidden under my bag. I switched it on, sucking in a breath. I could hear footsteps above deck. Faded voices and laughter drifting in and out of conversation. Thankfully, though, none of them heard me. It was a blessing. When I was sure I was in the clear I sat up properly, pulling the threaded blanket I had slept under tighter around me. My mother's dress was far too thin, I'd shivered through most of the night. 

I took old parchment out of my bag, and the quill I'd stored, wrapped in scraps of old cloth, and began to write. I liked writing. It made time pass quickly 

June 3rd, 1867.

My name is Elizabeth Swan.

It has been 3 days since I have been a stowaway aboard The Gemima.

So far, I  am okay. I am hungry and that is something to worry about. I only have soup left-- and some beans. I'm sure this will not last me so I will have to risk going above deck when they are asleep. I made a promise to my dead mother. I would return her most prized possessions and pierce every heart on board for taking hers. I am scared. I will not lie and say I fear nothing. The truth is I am terrified. However, I will follow through with the promise I made. I will return our family's riches.

If I am to die then I will die brave and fearful and not a coward.

When I was finished writing, I stuffed the parchment and quill back into my bag. When I reached to turn off the oil lamp, my clumsy hand knocked it instead, sending it toppling over. This time, I wasn't so lucky. Despite my quick reflexes grasping for it, it hit the ground with a noticeable bang.

"What was that?" A voice, and I slammed my hand over my mouth.

I'd already planned what I'd do if I made noise. I would hide among the barrels of beer and gunpowder.

When footsteps sounded, though, this time loud, getting closer, I came to the sudden realisation I didn't have time. I didn't have time to hide behind the mass of barrels and gunpowder.

I felt my body stiffen when steps came pounding down wooden steps. I glimpsed the illumination of light and heavy breathing. "Huh." The voice startled me. It was... familiar, somehow, a voice from the strange dream.

No. I shook off that thought. I knew it—of course I knew it. I’d heard it over the last few days. I shuffled back, instinctively reaching for the dagger in my belt. "Come on out," The voice sang. "I can smell you."

Gripping the handle of my knife, I swallowed a breath. All I had to do was aim for the throat. I didn't need my sight, a blind swing would injure him, and I could get his weapon. The plan was in my head and I lunged out of my hiding place, only to find the prick of a sword stabbing me in the throat. Not enough pressure to draw blood, but enough to sting, sucking the breath from my lungs. The blade of the sword coaxed me out into the open, into the blinding glow of an oil lamp lighting up the dark, and a shadow, before an identity flickered, revealing a boy. 

Thick dark curls and darker eyes, a handsome face if not for such a cruel smile splitting his mouth apart. The boy wore rags, and yet held himself like a noble, like the son of a family who came from wealth. I knew better. He was well-known in our small community, the son of a wanted man. Following in his father’s footsteps, he had painted our town red. He had been the one to leave my mother bleeding out while I slept soundly and had taken all we had.

In the dull glow of the flickering lamp, I drank the boy in, and while hatred and anger and pain filled me, so did something else. It was just for a second, not enough to count, not enough to make a difference or force itself to the forefront of my mind-- but I could have sworn I'd seen his face before. His name was gone, but I knew those eyes-- that curl in his lip.

To my surprise, the boy seemed just as surprised for a moment. His expression twisted and he inclined his head. "Do I..." He shook his head, like he had water in his ears—but I knew what he was going to say. Do I… know you? Those were the words on his lips, because they were glued to mine too.

Words that felt so strange and alien on my tongue, but right when I was looking at him.

Instead of delving into his own curiosity, he circled me, keeping the blade of his sword protruding into my neck. “Forgive me for asking, but did I not rip out your mother’s heart several moons ago?”

His words struck something inside me and I lunged out with my own knife.

He laughed. "What are you going to do with that, Wench? Stab me?"

I dropped my weapon when he jabbed me with his blade. Not enough to cut, but I felt the sting, the prick teasing my flesh.  "You took everything we had," I whispered. "You left us with nothing."

"And you're trespassing." The boy said, grabbing me by the shoulder and yanking me back up wooden stairs. When I tripped, my feet slipping through the gaps, his grip tightened on me, My hands were tied together with tough rope and I was hurled above deck. I was greeted by a pitch dark sky, the sea ahead of me, a pool of endless grey stretching for miles. The boy's shipmates were on deck, the three of them sitting on barrels, playing some kind of card game. From the look of them, they were quite the odd bunch, consisting of a short blonde girl dealing out cards, a tall-looking kid with carved features drinking from a wooden cup-- and another guy hanging over the side of the boat. From his quivering body and loud groans, he was emptying his guts.

My capturer pulled me closer to him, grabbing a fistful of my hair and pulling my head back.

 "We've got a stowaway!" He announced with a laugh. I opened my mouth to call him a murderer, but he was shoving me face-first onto my stomach, and I got a mouthful of stink and odour. "You have no business on The Gemma. You're tresspassing." 

"No business.” The others drawled. When I lifted my head, the small blonde’s smile was wide.

"I like her." She said, “Can we keep her?”

"We can take her bones." The tall kid spoke up, his gaze on the cards. "They’ll make great soup.”

“And her hair.” The boy who had been emptying his guts twisted around. “All of her will sell well.”

The kid holding me chuckled, grabbing me by the back of my neck and yanking me to my feet.

"All great answers,” He announced. “I think we all know where she belongs.”

The sickly boy choked out a laugh. “In hell’s hungry mouth!” He hollered.

“That’s right.” My capturer’s sword once again found the back of my neck. “Walk.”

I did, taking slow steps, my bare feet slapping across wooden planks.

"Let this be a lesson," The boy announced, "To any of you who turn against me.”

As he said those words, I was forced to the side of the ship. Below me, anarchic waves waited for me, ready to swallow me whole.

"Well?" 

The boy really liked teasing me, stabbing his sword into me, again and again, enough to draw blood but not kill. It was cruel and merciless, exactly what I expected. "Do you have pride in your heart, hmm? Will you fall by your own decision, or will I be the one to do it?"

"Oh, do stop speaking in tongues," The blonde girl laughed. "Throw her overboard, already."

I twisted around, scowling at the girl. Under the light of the moon, her face was somehow striking—beautiful, but something else. Something I knew, but how did I know it? How did I know her eyes and the twist in her lips?  "You think you are part of the crew? Do not make me laugh. You are nothing but a toy," I twisted back to face the rapidly greying sky. "A woman does not belong on a ship.”

"Harsh words," The boy said. "The woman as you call her is a member of my crew."

"Have you taken her voice?" I demanded. "Can she not speak for herself?"

"That's none of your business."

"Admit it," I said, when I climbed onto the side, throwing out my arms to keep my balance. My body swayed, and the air seemed to carry it,  my hair spiralling in my face. "Admit the wench aboard is nothing but your toy for you to play with. I bet you took her from her family after murdering them.”

The boy sighed. "As I said, you are not welcome aboard. Jump."

"This is not even your ship!" I gritted out. "You stole it from a merchant!"

"Potato, poh-tah-to."

"What?"

His words hit me, a sense of confusion flooding me, worse than the fear gripping me, the icy cold wind whipping my cheeks. The sky above seemed to flicker, the moon turning off and then on, like the erratic glimmer of an oil lamp. The boy didn't seem to notice, and when I turned to his crew, they didn’t either. They didn’t notice the waves below looking shallower the minute, as if I could step inside and only be up to my knees. I shivered, blowing out a breath. "I will not ask you again. I'll just use my hands.” I felt the sword travel up my spine. “Jump.”

I bit back a scream, my toes curling. "And if I do not?"

"Then I will lend you some help."

I had no choice.

I either jumped or fell.

I did fall. I know I did. I remember taking a single step forwards and my footing getting lost in the air, in spiralling wind pulling me down.


I expected to hit the water like splintered glass.

 I waited for ice cold water to fill me up, for the waves to tear me apart and drag me to the bottomless depths. Instead, I wasn't falling, or drowning. I was standing, and once again my reality was cracking open. My vision blurred, endless dark and phantom water swirling around me making way for a shadow which quickly bled into something real, something I could touch. I was no longer drowning in a nameless sea. I was standing in the dark, in front of a glass door—and my fists were pounding into it.

Through the glass was a brightly lit modern  kitchen, and something was running down my face, cold, and prickling, sticking strands of my hair to my cheeks. 

Rain.

"Hey!" Next to me, four figures seeping into reality.

"This is useless," I groaned, my voice once again faded. "He's not in."

"I knew it." Cole was standing next to me, his face lit up in sickly light from the porch light. I’d never seen that look on his face. Fear twisted in his expression.  He stopped knocking, stuffing his hands in his sweatshirt. "This was a bad idea. I told you this was a bad idea, but nobody ever listens to me.”

“You think everything is a bad idea,” I muttered.

“It's better than St Abby’s.”

Cole laughed. “Really?” He gestured to his sweater sticking to his flesh, soaking strands of hair poking from his baseball cap, and then to the state of me. “So, are you happy with getting pneumonia too? At least we had a roof over our head!”

Marin was using her bag as a makeshift umbrella. “This is stupid. Can we go someplace else?”

"No, I've got it." Shai wasn't giving up, knocking more desperately. "I told him our situation. He said we're welcome any time, so can we just stay here for a little longer?” He turned to me, and his eyes were panicked. Shai was regretting it, I thought. He was regretting running away from St Abby’s.

Zach kicked the door with a hiss. “Clearly not at 10pm on a Tuesday night.”

"Can you just give him a few more minutes?" Shai hissed.

"Yeah, and then what?” Zach got in his face, scowling. “Where are we supposed to go when he doesn't answer?”

I noticed a shadow at the corner of my eye and turned back to the door. A figure was coming towards us and pulled open the door. Mr Sutton, our English Professor. “Ah, Shai told me you were coming.” He gestured us inside. “Come in. How long have you been standing out here? You’re soaking wet!”

"Mr Sutton," Shai gasped out,  swiping his soaking face. "We, uh..."

The Professor shook his head.

“There’s no need to say anything, you can stay as long as you would like.”

Marin was already diving through the door, squeaking in delight. Zach followed, throwing his arms around Shai, laughing. I followed them eagerly, though when Cole didn’t move, choosing to stand in the downpour like an idiot, I turned back, cringing when a gust of wind blew my hair from my face.

"Please don't tell me you're stubborn enough to stand there all night."

Cole folded his arms. “Unlike you guys I have a brain.” He pointed to our professor busting around the kitchen, making hot drinks and throwing the others blankets. “Are neither of us going to question why our fifty something year old English Professor is happily offering us to stay at his mansion like house?”

"It's called being a decent human being." I held out my hand. "Come on, you're going to get wet."

"I already am wet."

“Fine.” I shut the door half way. “I’ll drink your hot cocoa.”

“Good!” He scoffed. “It’s probably drugged.”

Ignoring him, I accepted a hot cocoa and drank it right in front of Cole. I watched the boy pace Mr Sutton’s yard for a while, getting wetter and wetter. I had half a mind to step out and drag him inside myself. When I was about to, Zach pulled me back gently, telling me forcing him inside would make it worse. After a while, we got comfy. Zach and Marin sat under a blanket in front of the TV, and Marin went straight to the YouTube app, and Shai busied himself in front of Mr Sutton’s classic literature bookcase.


I slumped in a beanbag and watched the rain, revelling in the sound of it hitting the roof and the door. I had always loved the rain. "He'll give in soon."

 Marin sighed, shooting the teacher an apologetic look. Nobody could really concentrate when Cole was sitting at the very back of Sutton’s yard, his head in his arms, acting like a kid. “He’s always like this. Cole is like the annoying younger brother.”

Zach chuckled. "I think we should lock him out. He deserves it for being a stubborn asshole."

Mr Sutton leaned against the door, sipping his own drink.

"I don't understand. Is it something I said or did? Mr Wilder is usually a delight to teach."

"Nah, he's like this all the time." Shai said, “He’ll come in soon.”

Half an hour later, a combination of Marin, Shai and a reluctant Zach and I yanked Cole in by the hood of his sweatshirt. Mr Sutton provided snacks and takeout pizza, and for the first time in a while I felt like I could sit back and smile without being wary of Karen poking her head behind the door and yelling at me for stupid shit. With the others settled on the sofa on the ground floor-- well, everyone but Cole, who was standing as close to the door as possible, his fingers grazing the handle, I headed upstairs to the bathroom. Mr Sutton's house was the perfect mix of modern and ancient, old crumbling brick and brand new wooden flooring blended with tapestry and light colours to give off a homely glow.

I took my time going up the stairs, my gaze drinking in the décor.

There were photo's on the walls, a little brunette girl, her expression frozen in a grin.

The timeline of her life ran up the stairs-- a baby on a swing, a toddler waving an apple in the air, mash potato covering her face, and then a young child sitting in front of a TV displaying a kid’s show.

The picture at the top of the stairs was the most recent, a girl, maybe eight or nine, this time sitting in a hospital bed. Her eyes were closed, and she was wearing one of those cartoon pirate hats. In the background, I noticed that same TV playing the exact same show.

"Do you know what fifteen tonnes of metal and steel does to a child's brain?"

I jumped, startled, to find Professor Sutton standing behind me.

His gaze was on the most recent photo.

"Mr Sutton!” I said in a breath, I’m sorry. I was—"

"My daughter's name is Gem." He said, "Or, as she liked to call herself, Gemima."

The Professor paused. "I was driving her home from ballet class, ten years ago now, when we were both hit by a drunk driver. A man who chose to drive recklessly and kill himself.”  He cleared his throat.

"I survived. And Gem, she-- ah, they legally pronounced her braindead several days later."

Something twisted in my chest. “I’m.. I’m so sorry.”

He nodded with a smile. "Yes. Well, I don't talk about her anymore. Only when I’m with her." Mr Sutton's gaze flicked from photo to photo. "As you can see... she liked pirates," He laughed, and I nodded, forcing myself to laugh too. "Her favorite show... What was it again? Jake And the Neverland Pirates. My god, she would not watch anything else. I used to tell her stories about her very own pirate ship.”

I kept nodding, because I didn’t know what else to say—what to do.

“I have to use the bathroom.” I said, dread tangling in my gut. “Where is it?”

I started downstairs, my stomach jumping, but his grasp was firm on my shoulders, gently turning me around. "Last door on the left," He said.

I nodded, swallowing. “Thanks. But there’s a curfew, and we should probably head back home.”

Mr Sutton chuckled. “Ally, it’s fine. Go ahead. It’s late anyway. Bathroom is where I said it is.”

"Right. Thanks." I followed his pointer finger down the hall and grabbed the handle and pulled it open. I expected a, well-- a bathroom. Instead, I found myself in a dimly lit room. 


Pale blue walls and plastic covering the floor.

 There were three hospital-like beds and slumped on them were three people in what looked to be their late twenties, early thirties. Their skin was pale, cheeks gaunt, eyes sunken. They lay on filthy bedding and pillows propping up heads which were turned at an odd angle.  I noticed there were pieces of them... missing. One girl's left arm, a guy's leg-- another girl's ear. My gaze flicked to wires attached to their heads and arms, and finally, a tiny ancient TV playing a colourful kids show. I didn't realise I was screaming until a rough hand found my mouth, and I was gasping into palmy flesh suffocating my mouth. 

"They're too old now," Mr Sutton murmured.

"After ten long years, Jake And The Neverland Pirates can end-- and since Gem is a lot older, I think I'll be changing the storyline a little," He tightened his grip on my mouth. "I've been writing the script for weeks, and it's a masterpiece. I call it Game of Thrones meets Peter Pan." He sputtered a manic laugh.

 "The second Shai let it slip about your home troubles, I knew I'd found new crew mates for my sweet Gem. Besides, who would come looking for some estranged students with no real home to go back to? Nobody suspects the professor with the dead daughter. Oh, and of course I can't take you whole, Ally. Gem needs a piece of each of you."

His words pierced me, and I lunged from his grip, my body entering fight or flight.

I threw myself into a run, and reaching the top of the stairs I screamed something, something which wouldn't leave my mouth, tangled and foreign-- a mixture of "Get out! Get away from here! Police!" coming out as a string of gibberish, before I felt his hands shove me.


I lost my footing and I was flying for a moment, before landing with a thunk on each step, my body going around and around, before landing with a sickly smack. When my head slammed into the edge of something metal, my world collapsed underneath me. Not before I felt his fingers tip-toeing over my skin, already choosing—

Choosing where he’d cut.

I didn't really wake up-- I came to, but something was pushing me down, shoving me into darkness.

There was pressure on my left leg, and movement-- back and forth. A noise, like-- cutting.  More pressure. I could feel it, pricks of pain-- slicing pain, the blade slicing through my skin, through bone and muscle, but no real agony. The sound of the saw was enough, and my body jerked, but I couldn't—I couldn't move. I couldn't move and he kept sawing, kept cutting. I heard the rustling sound of papers. “Are you listening, Allison? Then I'll begin. "Elizabeth Swan woke to her mother screaming..."

Mr Sutton’s voice lit up my thoughts, and I was awake-- between reality, and whatever he'd put me inside. I was awake enough to sense him, feel him, feel the blade of his saw-- slicing me apart.

Pieces of me.

I didn't want to know who I'd wake up to be-- would I be nothing but a limbless body?

In the time it took for me to find myself, how much of me had he taken?

How much had he taken of the others?

"Ahh, Allison.”

His voice brought me out of the fog, to clinical sheets lying underneath me, to my phantom limbs.

He stopped cutting, and through a crack in my eye I glimpsed that same tiny TV screen.

That same kid’s TV show.

“It appears you’re awake.”

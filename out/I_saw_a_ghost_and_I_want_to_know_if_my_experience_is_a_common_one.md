This was 4 years ago when I (22f) was 18 years old. I was in my first semester of university (in Canada) and my roommate's parents' cattle farm and home was a couple hours from school. For our fall break my roommate (18f) invited me and two of our close friends (18 f&m) at the time to stay at her house for the week. Her parents recently moved into this farmhouse, I'm not exactly how old it was but I think about 100 years, give or take. We all expected a week of good home cooked meals, studying, hanging out, and checking out her parents' cattle farm. A few days in and were having a great time relaxing and getting some work done. One night her parents tell us they're going down the road for a party at a neighbour's place and they ask us to watch her younger siblings. Us four take this opportunity to have a few drinks and enjoy the night on our own. My roommate put her siblings to bed, we helped with some bedtime reading, and we all went downstairs to the kitchen afterwards and waited about an hour so that we knew the kids were fully asleep before we start having drinks. 

Now, this is where I need to know if what I saw was legit, I am so sure it is what I think. We were all a couple drinks in, I was tippsy, but not *drunk*. Fully functional and aware of my surroundings. I was standing on one side of the kitchen, leaning on the counter when I looked from the kitchen table where the other 3 were sitting (directly in front of me) towards to door to the mudroom (where the staircase to upstairs is). I saw a pitch black 3 foot-ish shadow in the doorway, it was there for about a full 2 seconds before it darted into the mudroom. And by darted, I mean DARTED, it was like a blink, but I never took my eyes off it once I saw it in the doorway. And this wasn't something I saw out of the corner of my eye. I was looking directly at it and saw it move from the doorway, out of view into the mudroom. 

My first thought is "oops we've been too loud and woken up one of the kids." So, I walked over to the door and look into the mudroom and there is no one there. And this house is old, the stairs would have made one hell of a noise even if one of the kids tried to run up the stairs and down the hall to get back to bed. So, I'm standing there with this odd gut feeling like "this is really weird." I'm standing in the middle of the mudroom looking around and I yell to my roommate in the kitchen "Hey where's the dog." Her parents had this huge black farm dog whose head is at 3 feet tall, but he is an outside only dog. My roommate of course says back to me "he's outside in the barn." That could have been the only real explanation. Something in me told me to turn on my heel and I ran the few steps back into the kitchen and across the room. I was full on freaking out. My friends were asking me what's wrong and I told them exactly what I saw, thinking it was one of the kids, and if it couldn't be the kids or the dog then what the hell was that. 

I KNOW what I saw, and I looked directly at it. It wasn't a flash, and it wasn't out of the corner of my eye, it was the shape of a small kid and there for a full 2-count. I told them I saw something but I dont know what it was. Before we got to her place for the week, my roommate told us half-jokingly that the grandson of the man who used to live here told her that the place was haunted. My roommate didn't know whether to believe him or not because she had walked in on her little siblings (6f & 4m) talking to "imaginary friends" and one had drawn a black shadow thing and told her that it was this imaginary friend (she told us this after I told her what I saw). We're all freaking out when we start connecting the dots like, oh shit that could have been a ghost. She ends up texting the grandson guy what I saw, and he texts back to us in the morning say he'd seen a shadowy figure just like I'd seen a couple of times growing up around the house and what I saw is probably "Justin." Apparently, his grandfather helped out this single mother with a little boy and girl, giving them a play to stay. Justin was the little boy who lived on the farm and was killed in an accident involving being pulled into a big spinning generator thing (??? i have no idea). We were too spooked to ask follow-up questions, but the grandson was fully like "oh yea I've seen that before, its Justin, I think he's harmless and just checking things out." So, we also ending up thinking he was talking to her younger siblings because he just wanted friends.

So, does anyone have any input about ghosts, or could anyone justify what I saw?

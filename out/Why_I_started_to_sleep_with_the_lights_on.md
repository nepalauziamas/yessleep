Some people are afraid of the dark but don't know why, in my case, unfortunately, I know exactly why. It's hard to know for sure when it all began but I've been seeing ghosts and whatnot since I was little, but everything changed one wretched night. Prior to this night I saw a shadow in my bedroom, so I was in alert mode, and that meant that I checked under the bed and inside the closet, on top of that I covered myself completely with my blanket, looking back that was very stupid and it did nothing but I guess it´s one of those things that one does. 

Before I tell you what happened I have to describe my parents house so you know how creepy it actually is. First of all is next to a river, and in Mexican folklore that’s not a good sign because that means you can have an encounter with the crying lady. On the left side is my parents bedroom, the living room and the kitchen, there's a patio and at the very end of it the bathroom. My and my sisters' bedrooms are on the right side. I have slept alone since I started high school and the twins share a room. 

So back to the wretched night, after dinner I was in my room, I checked the spots mentioned before I went to bed and I covered myself but I couldn’t sleep so I was fully awake when I heard a noise. It was like a roar but not from any animal I have ever heard before, then I heard the scratching of its claws against the concrete of the floor outside my bedroom, but trying to make sense of it I thought it was a cat that got in since our neighbour has way too many. I tried to ignore it but then I heard the claws again but this time it sounded like it was inside my bedroom.

I stayed still for what felt like the longest time, hoping I was hallucinating or something else, but then it all became too real when I felt it on my bed next to my feet, I froze, I could feel my heart beating like it wanted to escape but it didn’t. So I just waited for it to make the next move, and it did, it started to slowly make its way to the upper side of the bed, I had seconds to think what to do, what could I do? I didn't even know what it was or if it was real, I felt it really close and all I could do was throw the blanket in its direction and jumped out of bed to make a run for the light switch, once I did that, I turned to see if there was anything there but there wasn’t. I could barely believe it, but I was fully awake, what was that? 

Looking back, when I threw the blanket I should have hit it but I didn’t feel anything, was I crazy? I definitely heard it and it definitely landed on my bed, I felt it God damn it! 

Confused, tired and scared I went back to bed but this time with the lights on. But it didn’t end there, because since that day I kept dreaming about a black dog. It always jumps the fence and just kind of moves around the patio. It's been a month and I keep waking up at three AM every single day, I don't know what to do and the worst thing is that I'm really curious as to what the hell did I hear and what my dreams mean so I guess I'm still looking for answers and in the meantime I'm sleeping with the lights on.

**OCTOBER 3RD**

My husband and I just moved our family into a beautiful home. It’s a big house, on a busy street, right next to a lake… and also a church with a cemetery a few houses down. 

It’s a little creepy but Hal says we’re a few houses down and it’s practically around the corner. 

Not too happy about it but can’t complain, it’s so close to the lake and the kids love swimming on hot days.

**OCTOBER 10TH**

Hal was unlocking the front door for the movers, when I pulled into the driveway with the kids. 
“I want the biggest room!” Abby shouted.
 “I’m the oldest, I get the biggest room” said Katie. 
They both got out of the car and raced into the house right at Hal got the door open. I went to go unbuckle Dillon from his car seat. 
“The room right next to ours on the bottom floor is for the baby, the two rooms upstairs you can both kill each-other over!” Hal shouted into the house. 

“Nice parenting hun” I said. 

“Thankyou!”

**two weeks later**

Things have started to settle in, it’s a big house and it was very old so we did have to remove some wallpaper and not all the wall decorations are up yet, but we got most of the old decorations and furniture out of the house. 

I did find a few weird crosses on the walls but I called the church to see if I was able to donate those to the church instead of just throwing them away (bad karma) along with some furniture and clothes left here. 

They said they’re always accepting donations. They were about to leave for the day, so I went outside and started loading up my van. 

As I’m carrying out a box of old junk, I see this woman, completely drenched, walking in the street. She came from the direction of the lake, so I assume since it was getting dark maybe she was heading back home, but why would she get in the lake fully clothed? In a white dress no less? There are children that live all around here!

I decided it wasn’t my business and kept packing my car and headed to the church. 

I didn’t run into her on my way to the church so I guess she lives close by. Great. 

**OCTOBER 13th**

“Mom, did my Contacts come in yet?” Katie asked. 
“I haven’t checked the mail today, give me a few minutes” I made my way outside. 

**drip, drip, drip**

What is that noise?

I turned around to see that woman, she was like walking towards the lake this time, still completely wet from head to toe. Holding something in her hands, but I couldn’t tell what it was…

It was 11pm. 

This was weird this time. 

I went inside and told Hal, but he said I was just overreacting. 

“She’s a grown woman, if she wants to take a dip, don’t be a karen about it!”

**OCTOBER 14th**

A baby from down the road had been kidnapped. Poor family has been distraught. The police came by and asked us questions, I didn’t mention the lake lady, so my husband wouldn’t accuse me of being a karen. 

That poor family. 

**OCTOBER 31ST**
“Ill head home and put him in his crib, don’t worry dear.”

“Are you sure? I can take him home and you can take the girls.” Hal said

“No don’t worry I got it, I’d rather sit down anyways. Have fun!” 

“Oh yeah I’ll do just that” he said, rolling his eyes as he walked off with Abby and Katie. 

I made my way into the house with Dillon, and set him down in his crib without awakening him, I decided to go outside and have a quick smoke in the backyard. 

Sure it was a nasty habit, but pot helps my nerves and also, it’s just plain fun to be a little high when you’re alone cleaning up the house. 
 
As I was walking back inside I noticed the lake lady, with something in her hands again, walking towards the lake. 

I shrugged it off… not my business.

I went back inside, Dillons monitor showed him asleep in his crib, (probably crashing hard, 9:30 is past his usual bedtime) and I went to do chores. 

**NOVEMBER 1St**
I woke up to Hal violently shaking me. 
“Where’s Dillon?! Have you seen Dillon?!”
“What? What do you mean? He’s not in bed?”
“Oh no oh no, Katie! Abby! Do either of you have your brother!? Has anyone seen Dillon?!”

**NOVEMBER 14TH**

Dillon has been missing for two weeks. 
We went to wake him up one morning and gone. Window open, no sign of any struggle. 

Just gone. 

He’s only 9 months old, who would do this??

The police think it’s some teenagers, a cult, maybe just some sicko, because he was taken on Halloween night. 

I knew he was too quite in that room but Hal said not to check because he was sleeping so soundly we wouldn’t want to disturb him! 

I saw him on the monitor all night I know I did. 

I know I did. 

I just don’t understand…



** OCTOBER 31ST**
it’s been a whole year since Dillon has been taken from us. The girls went to go trick or treating with Hal, I refuse to celebrate this holiday. 

I turned all my lights off, for the most part people know not to come to our door. 

It’s a small knit town. 

People have heard. 

I was ready to just go to bed, take a depression nap until tomorrow when I saw her. 

I hadn’t seen her in so long…

The woman who would always swim fully clothed.. she was holding something in her arms and I saw it move. 

I don’t know why, but I ran outside. 

“Hey, you! Why are you completely wet from head to toe!? I can see right through your dress and this isn’t the first time I’ve see-“

Hold on. 

She’s holding a baby. 

“Let me see that baby” I said

She stared at me, and smiled. 

The baby turned towards me and I saw him… it was my son. He hadn’t aged a day… I was so confused. 

I ran towards her. 

“YOU TOOK HIM YOU CRAZY BITCH!” 

I went to tackle her and fell to the ground. 

She wasn’t there. I looked around, someone had to have seen her… 

I was all alone. 

I turned to the lake and saw her again, 
Walking into the lake with Dillon over her shoulder. 

I ran after them but by the time I got to the lake it was too late…

I called the police instantly. 


**NOVEMBER 5TH**

After almost a week of draining and searching they found Dillon in the lake.
He had been there for a year by the coroners report. 

I couldn’t believe it. 

I just saw him Alive, being drowned in the lake by that woman yesterday. 

I just don’t understand.

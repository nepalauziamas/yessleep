Ok so, let me tell you what's going on.

I was hanging out with my friends 2 weeks ago! And we were having a genuinen fun time, but out of the corner of our eyes me and my other friend Matt saw a kitten running around, so as usual we got curious and followed the cat for a bit, when the cat stopped it let us to a old house, like an 1800's type of house. The house looked old.

And at first when we got their something felt off but obviously we ignored the feeling and explored the outside of the house, which we never should have done, now we've been at the house for a bout 20 mins when Matt gets a call from our friends asking us where we are and Matt was just about to answer until we both realized we were in the woods.

So, naturally we freaked out but we tried looking for a way out kind of like an exit, but of course we couldn't find one.

So, we just winged it and ran out, we were running for a bit when we realized we were going deeper into the forest, which was pretty terrifying because there were myths of horrible creatures in the forest, now they were just myths but still they could be true so we slowly but steadily started to head back and just as we could see the old house, we heard a voice.

"Don't you dare step another foot forward!" the voice demanded

"Who are you" Matt questioned.

"I am *Sarthak* God of the forest" Sarthak replied.

"What do you want from us?" Matt asked.

"I don't want much Just don't go into that house and you should be fine" Sarthak demanded.

"Listen, We do not want to go into that house we just want to go home, Will you please point or direct us the way to the park?" I asked Sarthak

And then suddenly I felt frozen, like the temperature dropped from 66 Fahrenheit to below freezing and before I could react I was standing in front of the playground.

"What happened?" Matt Asked.

"Why are you asking me? I have no clue you idiot" I replied

"Oh, yeah fair point you are pretty dumb" Matt said

"Care to explain what you mean by that?" I asked

"Yo, You guys are back! we were Low-key getting worried" Shawn interrupted us.

"Oh, yeah were back" Matt said

"Aun, If they ask what happened don't tell them anything, we gotta see what happened today, it was pretty weird" Matt whispered,

"Ok" I Said.

After we left the park it was around 4:30, so I just went home and played some games and talked to my friends, when it was getting around 6:30 I decided to head to Matt's place to figureout what happened earlier today when I heard a voice.

"Don't go to his house, he's planning something that includes you" The voice said.

"Who even are you? And why should I even trust you?" I asked the voice.

"I'm Nick, the savior of kids like you, and trust me you will regret it later on" Nick replied.

"Ok So? Why should I listen to you?" I asked Nick

"Listen to me this once Aun, if I turn out to be wrong you can ignore me later on in life" Nick said

"All right, I'll trust you this one time but if you're lying I won't trust you again" I told Nick

"Ok, Aun go home now" Nick demanded.

And just with that I was headed home again. But it wasn't that bad staying home and relaxing was fun even though Matt was mad at me, I didn't really care but he was mad-mad for some reason, I didn't know why but then I remembered what Nick said, maybe he was right, and he could've just saved me from some trouble.

But I had to go to sleep obviously and I woke up (thankfully) and I found out my phone was blowing up and my friends were telling me to turn on the news. I agreed and the headline said "Local boy arrested for murder" and it was a picture of Matt, I was so scared, but at the same time I was so relived,

And without realizing I said "Thanks Nick".

"You're welcome kiddo" I heard back

after that the day seemed normal until the afternoon I had just gotten home from the Gym and was famished, I looked like I hadn't eaten anything in days, so I just made a quick meal nothing much, Just a cheeseburger with lettuce, tomato, cheese obviously, and some onions. with some water, it was a good meal

I was just going to my room when I heard a thump outside, when I looked out I saw the same kitten, and to be honest I kinda wanted to follow it but I didn't. As I was just on my phone my door creaked open a little bit because the air conditioning was on, and I saw the kitten waiting for me.

So without thinking I said "should I follow the cat?"

"Don't you'll get in trouble with *Sarthak*, or even worse" Nick replied

after he said that I got a chilling feeling,

"What do you mean by 'even worse'" I asked.

"I mean ***Fauzia***, She is our leader and she is the strongest person we know off, she also leads us" Nick replied

"Us? There are more of you guys?" I asked curiously

"Yes, a lot more of us, but the important 2 are *Sarthak,* and ***Fauzia***." Nick responded

"Ok, so are you like my guardian angel?" I asked.

"Well, you could call me that but, I was told by ***Fauzia*** to keep an eye on you, and be there if you need me" Nick responded

"Ok" I said "Well If I need you I'll call you"

The rest of the night went well, except some weird noises here and there that I mostly ignored, there was this one time that night that I can't really explain even with all the stuff that happened I don't know what happened.

It was around 3:39 Am, and I heard a noise outside my door, at first I didn't think much of it until my door opened a little and I saw a black flash, I saw the void, is the only thing I can use to describe it, it was a hole right outside of my door, and I got curios fast.

So I went up to it and checked it out, I saw that there was a lot of void or was it a portal I thought? So I threw in a water bottle, and after a minute or two I heard.

"Where did this water bottle come from?" which when I heard that voice I knew it was Sarthak speaking.

"Sarthak?" I asked curiously.

"Who said that, and who are you?" Sarthak asked.

"Its me Aun, remember you told me not to go into that house yesterday" I replied.

"Ah, yes it's you mortal, So why are you contacting me?" Sarthak asked.

"I didn't mean to a random void opened up in front of my door" I said

"Darn that Kid! I told him to open up the voice-reflector in front of Matt's cell" Sarthak said. "Well I gotta go now kid, stay safe" Sarthak said

and suddenly the void closed, I was so confused on what happened but I didn't think of it much, but that's when I realized that if they can open up "Voice-Reflectors" anywhere they can probably do a lot of other things. And why was he trying to open one up in front of Matt's cell?

When I woke up the next day I saw on the news "Inmate Escaped and left a note" The note read

"Hey Aun, I know you are seeing this so whatever you do, do not let me find you or I will kill you, also please tell the cops what happened that night they don't believe me, and if you don't I'll know and you won't live until Monday."

it was Sunday the day he escaped *Does he mean tomorrow* I thought, then I heard a voice.

"Don't go to the police" the voice said.

and as I heard the voice I got chills, the voice was so calm and still, it was like whoever was behind the voice was an angel.

"I'm *Fauzia*" The voice said, "I think you've heard about me"

And that was when I got a chance to look at Fauzia, She was so angelic looking. she looked like and actual angel from the movies, she had huge white wings, light blue eyes and a magnificent smile. I felt like I was really looking at an angel. I felt astonished.

"Ye-Yeah, I have heard about you" I replied in a shocked manner. I didn't think *you* would actually visit me.

"Whatever you do, do not go to the police, we will keep you safe Aun" Fauzia said.

"We?" I asked, and then Sarthak and nick appeared out of thin air.

"We" all of them replied

"Just stay in your room and everything should be fine" Nick said.

"But, But I have so much to do today, I can't just stay in my room. I have to cook food go get groceries and all that stuff." I said, Then I saw Sarthak mumble something and suddenly cooked food appeared. It's like he knew what my favorite food was because on the stove a full pot of Shrimp Fettuccine Alfredo, and it wasn't a small pot either it was at least 20 inches, I was honestly surprised.

And I had also gotten all my groceries, I got the milk, eggs, sugar, hot Cheetos, and Takis, and everything else I had made a list about.

"We will take care of you mortal, Just stay in your room and watch your mortal Tv" Sarthak demanded

"O-ok Sarthak" I replied

"That's Sir *Sarthak* For you mortal" Sarthak demanded.

And just like that I was headed back in my room with my Fettuccine Alfredo, and my Tv remote. The day went by really quick and really relaxing bc I didn't have to do anything the whole day except watch Tv.

And then it was Monday, That Monday was horrible, I don't remember much but what I do remember is when I woke up, Matt was standing in front of me, and I saw Fauzia, Sarthak, and Nick on the ground not moving. Next to Matt I saw 2 Demon-looking things, they looked like nick but just darker, instead of blue eyes they had red eyes, instead of medium sized white wings they had huge black wings, but the thing that looked the most different was their body, They both looked like actual body guards, like the ones you see in movies with their arms crossed.

And then they came close to me.

"Well well well, what do we have here?" Matt asked stupidly.

"What did you do to Fauzia and Sarthak?" I asked him.

"Oh, Thats their names well then I just taught them to never disobey me. Now if you don't want to die I suggest you listen to me Aun!" Matt Demanded "Their is a cliff Not to far from here its called the... Undesirable, everyone who goes there loses their mind and jumps..."

"Now I'm not going to ask you to go there and jump, I'm going to tell you to jump or these 3 behind me die. OK?" Matt Demanded. And then one of his body guards but a black void looking knife and held it above nick.

"If you don't go in the next 10 seconds he'll get hurt, Now do you want him to get hurt? just as I thought, now go run away you like the little wuss you are" Matt Demanded.

"N-NO" I Yelled "I am Not leaving them behind you can say what you want Matt but I Hate you and so does everyone else, Haven't you realized by now? Nobody like's you that's why you're an outcast and will always be an outcast." And just as I said that, I saw blood, white blood I jolted my head over to nick and saw the knife in him.

"RUN AUN RUN" Nick Wailed in pain.

"You've done it now you poor child, you hurt your fwend, now how about you run away" Matt said.

I was trembling, I couldn't even stand correctly. I had no choice but to run so I ran for it, I didn't look back until I got to the cliff. When I got there I looked over the cliff and saw something horrifying, hundreds of dead bodies at the bottom of the cliff, as I was looking over I felt a hand on my shoulder, and the next thing I realized is that I'm falling off a 100 m cliff...

Let me start by saying I do believe in the supernatural, but I don’t know much about it. Yesterday I picked up my 13 year old brother to tutor him in English. When I arrive to pick him up, my mother was acting strange. I asked if I could also bring along my 14 year old step-sister, to get her out of the house. My mother said no and made up an excuse as to why she couldn’t come. Minutes later, I asked again if my sister could tag along, and she straight ignores me and continues to talk about something else. About 10 minutes later, she looks at her phone and says “ok, her dad said that we aren’t doing XYZ anymore, so you can take her”. But she seemed very upset about it. I didn’t ask any other questions, we just left and headed to my house. 

Why would she be so upset that her kids are going to their older siblings home? It’s not the first time I’ve brought them over. I found this very odd. 

Prior to picking them up- I initially planned to only get my brother, as i was helping with his school work. I had a pre-planned networking event at 4PM so I planned to have him home by 3PM at the latest and I told her this. The event was cancelled due to the weather,and I didn’t think to mention this to my mother. Surely it wouldn’t be a big deal if I kept my siblings a little longer. 

3PM rolls around and my mother is blowing up my phone, asking if I’m on the way to bring the kids back. She was clearly still upset so I said yes, and immediately jumped in the car to bring them home. 

Side note: I rarely visit my mothers home unless it’s to see my siblings, because I do not have a great relationship with my mother. 

We arrive back at her house and instead of just dropping them off out front like normal, my brother asks me to come inside and look at his video games. So, I go inside and we all head straight to his bedroom. 

I don’t like being at my mothers home because she keeps cameras on inside the home at all times. I find this as a invasion of privacy. 

Anyways, we’re in my brothers room and we start talking about random ghost stories. My brother tells me that when they first move into this home(about 4 years ago), he and my older brother went into the attic and found an old Polaroid of a young girl with her her face scratched out. They got freaked out and burned the photo in the attic. Keep in mind, the attic access is in my brothers room. Anyways, we start googling different spiritual things and come across a video of a girl exhaling how to communicate with your guardian angel. We assumed it was fake, but decided to try it. In the ritual it said to draw a line on your right hand down your wrist, and draw your zodiac symbol on your left hand, then put your hands together in a prayer like sense, and say “guardian i channel thee”. 

My brother is sitting on his chair and my sis and I on the bed. My sis try’s the “ritual” and immediately after, my brothers PlayStation flys off of its charging station and onto the floor. We were all 6-8 feet away from the unit it was sitting on. At the same time this happened, 3 video games where pulled forward from the game shelf(the shelf that the PlayStation was sitting on), the VR camera fell off of the TV and a box fell off of the shelf. 

We all sat in silence just looking at each other in shock. We waited a few moments and I tried it, to see if it would happen again. Nothing happened this time. 

The games that were pulled forward on the shelf where far cry 6, borderlands 3, and 5 nights of Freddie. The only 3 games on the shelf associated with numbers. 

After seeing these numbers, we continued to see the same 3 numbers in different orders ALL NIGHT. My sister and I both had an unsettling feeling in our stomachs while in this room….could have been anxiety about what happened, but something seemed off. 

After about 30 minutes, mother called the kids for dinner. We’re all on edge, but go to the kitchen to prepare our plates to eat. This is the first time we’ve been out of the room, and we notice that almost every camera in the house was turned off. As we sit down for dinner, my sister says that she kept hearing a buzzing noise in her ears, but we couldn’t hear it. 

After dinner we go back to my brothers room and try to think about what the f.ck is going on here. An hour passes and I still have an unsettling feeling. My brother says”what if the ghost in the attic doesn’t like electricity?” Seconds later the power goes out in the entire home. It turned on seconds later and the three of us screamed and all ran outside. We waited outside for a few minutes to calm down, and then went right back to my brothers room. 

Now at this point, my older brother and his wife come over with their baby. My older brother used to stay in this room that my younger brother now sleeps in. So I ask my older brother is he had ever experienced anything weird in the room. He said that he used to hear noises in the attic, as if there were rats up there, but never physically saw them. 

By this point, my younger siblings are freaked out and asked to spend the night with me. We all walk out into the living room and ask my mother if they can spend the night. She says no. She starts screaming at them saying that they have plans in the morning… which neither of them where aware of. My brother says “well you’re probably just going to sleep all day, and we’d rather stay at her house.” She is adamant that they cannot come. So my older brother, his wife, the baby and I, all get ready to leave and we go outside. Typically, I get in my car and leave immediately, but I was chatting with them about the baby and stood out front for a few minutes. Next thing I know, the kids are outside jumping in my car saying “leave leave leave!” So I get in and start to drive. 

They tell me that when we walked outside, my mother randomly started to say “fine! If you want to go so bad, then fucking GO!” her voice changed when she shouted this. The kids where so scared that they did not grab 1 thing, they just ran out the front door to catch me before I left. No clothes, no toothbrushes, nothing. They were clearly very scared. 

My older brother went back inside as I was leaving and his wife contacted me afterwards. She said that my mother was crying when I brother wen back inside and was acting very upset that the kids where not staying home.

Fast forward to later that night - we decide to watch a movie and relax. I suddenly had a feeling of peace and felt much better. I begin to go to my bedroom around 11PM to get ready for bed. My dog comes along as normal… but she wasn’t acting normal. I lay in bed and my dog typically sleeps near my feet at the end of the bed. But that night, she stood next to my bedroom door for 45 minutes. She finally jumps into bed, but instead of jumping to my feet, she comes up next to my head and lays her entire chest and head on my chest. She’s and 85lb shepherd mix, so this was quite heavy. She fell asleep in this position and I close my eyes to start getting rest. Minutes after closing my eyes, my door handle jiggles around and I hear a loud noise. My dog jumped up out of her sleep and starts growling at the door. I assumed it was one of my siblings needing something, but they were sound asleep and no one was at my door. (My husband was also home, but he was in his office playing video games with his friends at this time so he didn’t hear a thing.) 

This morning I wake up to an even worse unsettling feeling that I can’t describe. My mother never texted me or even called last night, which was unusual if she were truly upset about what happened. She texts me this morning and says “I am going out today so text me before you bring the kids home, so I can be there.” No explanation as to where she was going to be or anything. 

I may be overreacting, my mother may be possessed, their house might be haunted, or we might’ve opened up a realm to something bad. I can’t explain the feeling in the pit of my stomach, but I can’t seem to shake it. 

Just need some guidance or advise - do y’all think we are ok and just overreacting? Or is this freaking weird? HELLLLLLP

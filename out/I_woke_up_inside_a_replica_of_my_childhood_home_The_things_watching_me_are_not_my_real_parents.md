"Honey, breakfast is ready," the friendly voice of my mother called from the other room. It awoke a warm and happy memory. One of our Sunday breakfasts where my mum would make the best waffles in the world, my parents would share the newspaper and the smell of coffee would fill our whole house. While I was too young to have any of it then, I loved the smell of fresh coffee. My mum always used to mix in spices like nutmeg.

I wish I could have tried her special coffee but she passed away before I was old enough for it. 

My eyes shot open.

Whose voice had just woken me up? 

I was lying on the couch in our living room. Well, my dad's living room. I moved out four years ago, just after I turned 20.

Slowly, I got up and took more steps than necessary until I was standing in the doorframe between the kitchen and the living room.

"Dad?" I carefully asked but nobody answered. 

While it was always slightly emotionally painful, it wasn't unusual. I often heard mum's voice in my dreams but it was weird that I smelled waffles and coffee while the kitchen table was completely empty.

I shook my aching head, I had the most horrendous hangover that I needed to cure with more sleep. Upstairs, in my old bedroom, not on the uncomfortable couch.

*Dad must have made a toaster waffle before he went to work*\- 

Suddenly my thoughts were interrupted. Something was wrong. Terribly wrong. 

I climbed up a few of the stairs and found myself in front of a thick, grey wall. 

It sounds ridiculous but the upstairs part of our house had either vanished or was sealed shut with a new wall. This sight felt so entirely absurd that my brain didn't even understand what to make of it. 

I instinctively took a step back, slipped, and fell down the few stairs, landing on my butt and I could swear I heard laughter. I slowly got up and walked towards the tv but it was black. 

"Dad?" I shouted.

"Where are you, Nils? Didn't you hear your mum calling you for breakfast?"

Every fiber of my body froze. That was dad's voice and it came right out of the kitchen.

I didn't understand what was happening but I knew that it was not right so instead of checking the kitchen, I decided to be smart and head straight toward the front door.

I pulled and pushed, but it wouldn't open. There was also no key in sight. I pushed the curtains from the small window next to the door but behind it all I saw was black. 

My heart started racing so fast I thought it would explode. 

I swallowed when I remembered that I'd seen sunshine through the window in the empty kitchen earlier. Maybe I could get out of the window. 

When I walked into the kitchen I saw a little white booklet on the table that I swear wasn’t there before. I picked it up and read the cover, all it said was NILS.

I was just opening the first page when I saw her right outside of the window, scratching the glass with her nails.

My mother. My mother, who passed away when I was only seven. Or rather, something resembling her. I think the best way I could describe it is that she looked like someone had tried to recreate a human based on a picture that a child drew but with real flesh and skin. Her proportions were all wrong, her face was plastered with makeup and her hair almost looked as if each strain had been glued on.

I felt too perplexed by the situation to even breathe, all I did was stare at it. And then a single tear rolled down my cheek.

When *he* appeared behind her, the copy of my father, I finally woke from my trance and stumbled backward into the living room. The copy of my father was far more realistic, only small components were incorrect. Like, he had a big mustache even though he’d shaved it off a week ago. And his nose appeared to miss holes. Small mistakes.

Holding that booklet that I found tightly in my hands, I crouched down next to the sofa and hoped that this would all be over soon.

\--

I can’t say how long I sat on that cold living room floor. There wasn’t anything I could do, the only way out seemed to be the kitchen but at least it appeared like they didn’t try to come inside. 

After what must have been at least an hour of sitting and contemplating my sanity, I decided to look into the booklet with my name on it and started reading the first page.

***The adventure of life***

***Pilot***

***Scene 1***

**We are inside a regular, suburban living room. The childhood home of Nils. We focus on the sofa in the middle of the room.** 

**Nils is sleeping on the sofa, tucked underneath a light blanket, still wearing last night's clothes: Loose, blue denim pants. Black t-shirt with a pocket. Converse shoes. His hair is frizzy.**

**A voice wakes him up.**

**"Honey, breakfast is ready!"**

"What the actual fuck?" I whispered to myself. 

I skimmed through the pages, but hardly any of them made sense. A few scenes were normal, like the one describing me waking up. After that, it was a mixture of random words and nonsense. It was all bullshit but I did not want to wait here until the *actors* of my parents came inside. I folded the paper and shoved them inside my back pocket. 

Holding my breath, I slowly tiptoed towards the kitchen window. It was the only way out for me. The glass was still foggy from the breath of my mother’s copy. A shiver went through my body when I thought about it. 

I collected all of my courage and peeked outside. There was no sight of anyone or anything. I held my breath just a moment longer, praying that this window wasn't a prop.

I probably could have broken it but that might alarm the things and they'd come back. 

But I didn't have to. The window opened like a regular one.

Finally, I could breathe again. I turned off my brain and climbed out the window. 

\-

I was staring at a blue wall, above me was a warm, yellow spotlight. The fake house was standing inside a massive storage hall. Cameras and other equipment were lying around but there were no signs of any humans.

I walked around the hall until I found two doors. One of them had a sign glued to it.

**Audition for new Warly, this way!** 

I decided to take the second door without a sign which led me to a hallway. I ran through it and landed in a second hallway. I kept running until I finally found an exit. When I realized that I was feeling the real, cold air on my skin, tears started streaming down my face. The relief was replaced by fear again when I noticed that the exit led me right into a forest. No roads, no sign of civilization. But I had to focus, I had to get away before they decided that I wasn't supposed to leave. 

So I started running again.

I can't tell you how long I ran for and how many times I got lost if that even makes sense in those circumstances. 

But finally, I found a diner where I could use a phone. I had escaped and I was safe. 

\--

Ever since that moment I've tried so hard to remember the location of the place. The police have not been able to find it with the bit of information I had Of course I left out the part about the creatures. Nobody would believe that shit but I’m not able to let go of it. I need to find answers.

Before I end up back inside the studio. 

Because when I fled, I took that script with me and when I finally got home I collected the courage to look at it and found another part that wasn’t nonsense.

**Nils decides to trick the parents. He opens the window in the kitchen and climbs outside. He doesn't know where to yet.** 

**End of scene**.

They'd wanted me to leave, *no*, they even predicted it. 

And now all I can do is keep wondering if there is a script for another scene. [And whether I am in it.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Likeeyedid/)

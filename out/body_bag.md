i was 6 years old when i went to my cousins house. i was chilling in my Younger cousins room. we where playing ps4 until my sister and my older cousin came in and asked us if we wanted to go outside and play and look around. me and my cousin both agreed and that was one of the biggest mistakes in my life. we walked out covered in rain instantly and then we went into the woods for a little walk thinking nothing of it. we got back out the woods and we went to a abandon house right next door we looked around for a while and soon found out that there where video cams all around so we went back and then my older cousin asked if we wanted to go into a old shead they had right down there hill.we all said yes. we went down to open the door and find a body bag i was frozen with fear my older cousin thought it was a good idea to thro a basketball at it so he did he did not hit the body bag but it shacked out of no where. i ran to the house just as we where runing my cousins phone started to play a song about the devil and how he was god. i started to cry and we got back to the house i told my aint about it all my aint and cousin went back to see if we where lying or not and they both said there was nothing there i started to cry agin i could not sleep that night i still wonder what happened.

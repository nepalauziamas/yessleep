  I approached the deli section and fought off the urge to cover my eyes with my hands. Even if I did, I knew I’d be peeking through my fingers. This one was too strange and unlikely to happen, I had to see for myself if it would come true. If it did, I don’t know what that would mean. Maybe it means I’m crazy, or maybe the simulation theory is real… More than likely I’m just unlucky in the most super normal kind of way. In other words, I’m probably just weird.

I timidly approached the counter and just like in my dream the night before a woman in a purple dress stood in the kitchen next to the meat slicer. She looked just as out of place as she did last night. She didn’t wear a hair net, she didn’t wear a mask, she didn’t even wear gloves. She just stood there and in a mindless rhythm pushed the giant chunk of ham with one hand as she moved the heavy slicer back and forth with the other. 

The ham was gradually growing smaller, but she wasn’t looking at it anymore, she was looking at me, unblinking without even a hint of emotion on her face. I could see her hand moving millimeters closer to the blade with every slice. I stared at her hand, dreading what was coming next. I wanted to shout but I was hypnotized by the surrealness of the situation. At the last second before the blade made the first slice of the tips of her fingers I turned to walk away. The woman didn’t scream but the next customer that walked up to the counter did. I knew what was happening and I didn’t want to see it again. 

I was tired. I woke up from last night’s dream at 3 AM and couldn’t go back to sleep. I decided I would go straight home from the grocery store and mind my own business. Maybe I’d get some decent sleep tonight.

That woman in the deli makes 2 dreams in a row that have come true. The first one was tame compared to this. It went as follows. An old friend I hadn’t seen in about 10 years called me. He said he was back in town and wanted to get a drink. He came by, picked me up in a black Charger, and we went to a local IPA brewery that I’d never been to. After catching up for a while the conversation took a peculiar turn and he went into great detail about how he thought there were too many people in the world and that Thomas Malthus was right. He had a strange look in his eyes when he talked about it, and the thought crossed my mind that there might be some hidden darkness behind what he was saying. 

The day after I had this dream every single detail of it came true. Even down to the decorations in the brewery. I told my old friend, we’ll call him Alex, that I had dreamt every aspect of our interaction the night before. Admittedly I did leave out my disapproval on his interest in depopulation. He was very intrigued by my premonition but there wasn’t much we could do about it, so the conversation drifted elsewhere.

While I had been working a simple job in my small hometown for the last 10 years Alex had been very busy. He told me about the places he’d been and the important people he’d met over the years. Apparently, he’d graduated with honors with a degree in molecular biology. He said everything changed for him after an extremely wealthy entrepreneur contacted him with a job shortly after graduating. 

He wouldn’t tell me who this entrepreneur was or what exactly he was working on but whatever it was he said it was going to change everything. I didn’t know what to make of what he was telling me, I’m just a simple man that drank too many beers without peeing. I told him I had to take a leak and that I’d be right back. When I got back, he’d ordered us another round of drinks. These beers were different than what we had been drinking so I had no frame of reference on how it should taste but it didn’t taste good, it made me think that a small amount of soap or something was left in the glass. Despite this, I was a little tipsy and after Alex made a few cheers about old friends or something we finished our drinks and went our separate ways.

Right now, I’m writing this down for I guess therapeutic reasons. I’m sitting on my couch struggling to stay awake. I’ll follow up with this entry if I have another dream...

It’s 3 AM again and the strangeness continues. I’m not sure where I was in my dream or who I was seeing but I can take a wild guess at who it was. I was in a laboratory, and I was surrounded by beakers, burners, microscopes, and all sorts of other instruments and chemicals that I have no idea what to call. In front of me was a pair of gloved hands steadily working with speed and precision. I was seeing them as if they were my own, but I had no control over them, I was just an observer. Suddenly I was transported to another location in the kind of sudden impossible way that can only happen in a dream. I was in my city’s little downtown historic district, and it was high noon. I knew I was back in my body, and I was walking down the main street in the heat of the sun. 

Everything looked normal at first but as I focused on the people in town, I became aware of the horror that was happening all around me. Across the street, through the window of the hardware store I could see the man behind the counter going at his arm with a screw gun. To my right was an electrician, he had opened the hand hole of a streetlight and as I watched he pulled the exposed hot wires out of the pole and pressed them to his chest. I turned away to see a car barreling down the street straight towards a brick wall. It hit with such great impact that the ground shook beneath me. 

The sounds of what was happening all around me grew louder and louder until the barrage of audible chaos grew so loud that I fell to my knees. I was hearing the mindless suicide of an entire town and I was the only one in sight that seemed normal. I put my head in my hands and as soon as I did, I woke up.

I’m still on my couch writing this but when I post it, I’m going outside. I can hear a car alarm going off and emergency sirens in the distance. I don’t what all of this means but I know who I’m going to go looking for. My guess is he slipped something in my drink that will keep me safe. If I find answers, and God willing a solution, I’ll follow up with another post.

So this happened back when I was 21 (I'm in my early 30s now) and too this day me and my friends still can't explain it, I live in Vancouver, Canada , grew up here and there are many unexplained experiences I have encountered in my life ( I am sensitive to supernatural things, its not fun) but this is the first time I had a group experience with people outside my family and of all the things that I have seen or felt this still sends shivers down my spine.

Me and my high school friends would meet pretty regularly , smoke weed and hang out , we had two places we would always go to do that, one was called the Point , a high point where you could lookout over the northside of the city and the Spot, an apartment building with a courtyard and an underground parking lot that also looked out over the city. This day we went to the spot , we drove into the parking lot and got out of the cars we had piled into to go match and smoke , there were 5 of us. So were sparking the first joint when from the roof of the underground parking a single spark starts to fall into the middle of our circle, my one friend milos noticed it first and then we couldn't take our eyes off it , we were underground , the joint hadn't even been lit yet, where did this single spark that looked like a sparker come from? All of a sudden in mid air the spark goes out and from it slime hit the ground. I remember it vividly because we all looked at each other when it hit the floor with the same confused look on our faces, my best friend victor bent down an touched the slime and I remember it smelled rancid and it became so quiet in that moment like all the sound in the area had  been muted but by this time we were all thoroughly freaked out and jumped right back into the cars, 

This is wear the terror happens, once the last door closed something BIG jumped on top of the car , so big that it made the car shake , we were franticly looking around to see what it was but we couldn't see anything but we heard it walking around on top of victor's car , the collective fear we all felt was almost instant , victor pushes the car into reverse and we hear it tumble off the back of the car as we speed away and still was we drove out of there we saw nothing. Absolutely nothing. 

We weren't high , we didn't hallucinate, we all experienced the same thing and still talk about it too this day because we can't figure out what it was but the main conclusion we have come too is that we think that a portal opened were we were and something crossed over into our dimension. Either way we never went to that parking lot again

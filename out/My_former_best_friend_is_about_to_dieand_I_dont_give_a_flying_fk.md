“I thought this was supposed to be a *hiking* trip?” Natasha groaned, as our march became more of a climb. She stopped to look back. Tangled, blonde hairs stuck to her forehead in sweaty clumps.

“I took us on a little detour,” I said. “There’s meant to be a nice view of the Lough just over this ridge, I thought it’d make for a nice picture.”

From our vantage point we could all the way to the bottom of the valley. Far below us, a fluorescent speck barrelled toward the beginning of the woodland and disappeared.

After a short breather, we pressed on through the knee-high grass.

For the next hour, during those brief windows when Tash stopped grumbling about her swollen foot, we regurgitated the same tired, worn-out stories we’d been telling non-stop for the past two days. Our trek across the Scottish Highlands started off smoothly: we reminisced about ditching school on Fridays and sneaking into bars with fake I.D.s. Back then, despite my dark hair and leaner build, people actually mistook us for sisters rather than friends.

But fast forward twelve years, and maintaining a conversation that didn’t start with '*remember how you always used to'* was a real slog.

The sun bore down hot on our necks, tree branches snagged our backpacks, and don’t even start me on the midges, biting us pretty much everywhere.

At the summit, the far-off Lough made for a great picture, although my hiking buddy seemed more concerned with her left foot, which had broken out in nasty, red blisters.

“Think you can keep going?” I asked.

“I don’t know Becks. How much farther to the lodge?”

No sense sugar coating it; she’d woke up forty minutes late and insisted we stop every half hour or so. Hell, she didn’t even help pack away the tent. “I figured we’d get there around four, but we’ve been going *way* slower than I expected.”

"Sorry we can't all be fitness gurus like you," she said bitterly.

Before a full-fledged argument broke out, wood splintered somewhere to my right. A series of hedges rustled, then every bird within a half-mile radius fell silent all at once.

As I motioned for Natasha to get her boot back on, my eyes whipped around, scanning for any signs of movement, finally landing on something unexpected: a man's face poking through the tall grass by the edge of our clearing.

“Good morning girls,” he said. He was roughly thirty yards away.

My heart accelerated as the corners of his mouth twisted up in this horrible grin, so wide you could count the individual teeth. A regular Cheshire-fucking-cat.

“Becks,” Natasha said, her voice all high and nervous. Without taking my eyes off that haunting smile I hoisted her up off the ground.

The man spider-crawled out of the bush on all fours, neck upturned. He had on a bright yellow jacket and waterproof trousers.

We backstepped away, which made him push out his lower lip like an infant getting ready to throw a tantrum. “Aww don’t be like that. Come over here so we can get to know each other.”

He arched his hips up, giving himself a sudden burst of speed as he scurried toward us.

Tash and I shrieked and then blitzed along the trail, while, behind us, yellow jacket kept lifting himself up off the ground by doing super push-ups. “Come back. I wanna be friendssssss.”

Desperate to put some distance between us and the maniac, we sprinted the whole way down that damn hill, low branches stabbing us both in the faces and throat. Our packs grew heavier by the second, but neither of us dared stop. We agreed to keep going until we found another hiker.

For the next hour, the forest thickened around us; soon we could only move where the foliage thinned out which forced us to keep doubling back to find suitable paths. Each time I pictured the man in the yellow jacket. Anytime a bullfinch took flight, I froze up and waited for him to drop from the canopy above, and when a pine marten scrambled across our path, I thought our stalker had caught up and grabbed hold of Natasha, screaming.

I felt a pang of guilt watching her limp along awkwardly. I knew from day one of the trip she couldn’t handle the pace, yet I’d dug my heels in and refused an easier route. Honestly, a shitty part of me did it to punish her for not training like she promised she would.

“I’m sorry,” I said, as we climbed over a slippery boulder. “We shouldn’t have left the main trail.”

“It’s alright,” she said, in a tone that told me it was very much *not* alright.

Mud oozed up around our boots as we clambered along, both sweaty and exhausted. Eventually, on the far side of some fallen birch trees, we spotted a broad, bearded man fishing from a slow-moving brook. Past him, foldable chairs and camping gear lay spread out across the bank.

We rushed over then, without stopping for a single breath, I said, “I’m-Rebecca-this-is-Tash-she-hurt-her-foot-there-might-be-a-psycho-chasing-us-and-our-mobiles-can’t-get-signal-please-please-help.”

From the look on his face, he hadn't caught a single word. I put my hands on my knees, gulped some air, and then explained the situation more carefully.

His face grew all serious. “Yis aren’t far from the edge of these woods. My trucks just over that clearing, I’ll give yis a ride into the village.”

“You’re a life saver,” Natasha said, relieved.

Reeling in his line, he said, “Did yis run all mornin? There’s coffee in that flask, help yersels.”

“Thanks,” we said in perfect unison. Back in the day, that sort of odd synchronicity happened non-stop.

“What’s your name?” I asked the man.

“Alistair.”

He assured us he'd only take a few minutes getting packed up.

Natasha and I tossed off our packs and collapsed into the little chairs. After that desperate scramble, it felt like the softest, most comfortable seat ever made. My neck and shoulders burned from carrying the heavy gear all morning.

Alistair gestured to a rucksack between the two of us. “There’s KitKats and a thermos of coffee in there if yis are starvin’.”

Tash made a marriage proposal to Alistair before diving in with both hands.

I sipped the hot liquid and nibbled on a chocolate biscuit, already feeling restfulness creep in. Quickly the two of us made amends: I apologized for the unnecessary detour while she said sorry for not going on a series of practice hikes to build up her fitness beforehand.

Then I said, “How about tonight we book into a hotel, buy a big bottle of cheap wine, and get absolutely shitfaced?”

“Then suffer a mammoth hangover on the bus ride back to London?”

“Yep!”

“Sold,” she said, then clinked her plastic cup against mine.

Past her, my eyes happened across a yellow blob sixty yards downstream drinking from the brook like a gazelle. “Oh fuck.”

She spun around just as yellow jacket lifted his head out of the water and galloped toward us, still on all fours.

We alerted Alistair, who grabbed a knife he used for gutting trout from his belt. “Get to the truck,” he said seriously.

From the looks of him, he didn’t want *or* need any help.

A steep mound overrun by oaks trees, stinging nettles, and sopping weeds separated us and the trail. As we reached the halfway point, I heard Alistair shout, “That’s far enough.”

A red-pred pickup truck was parked beside a stone-covered road on the side of a hill. Trees and hedges blocked our view of the two men below. When I squinted I only saw a yellow blob, disappearing and reappearing behind ferns and leaves.

At the top of his lungs, Alistair yelled and grunted while Natasha frantically pawed at the truck's driver-side door.

“Great fucking plan Becks,” she snapped, practically prying the handle loose, “taking us to the middle of nowhere to get stalked by some lunatic who walks around doing animal impressions. Definitely worth it for some shitty photo of a Lough.”

Incredible how fast all that goodwill evaporated…

“Well if you’d just woke up on time we wouldn’t have bumped into him, would we?”

Both of us leaned forward, jaws clenched, but crunching, dead leaves cut our argument short.

My eyes scanned the slope from left to right. “Hello?”

“Girls, are yis up there?” It sounded like Alistair.

Tash and I let out synchronized sighs of relief. “We’re here.”

He poked his head out from behind a nearby tree, stooped so low his right ear brushed the ground. The corners of his mouth turned up so wide smile lines shone through his cheeks and the corners of his eyes. “I want yis both to stick around. Let’s be pals.”

At a complete loss for words, Tash and I stood frozen on the spot and watched him scurry toward the path on all fours, wet soil dripping from his hands and ankles.

Another sound, to our left this time. My eyes whipped toward a huge, moss-covered rock, which yellow jacket scuttled over the top of like a lizard.

From the nose down his face had become a twisted, dangling lump. The handle of Alistair’s knife stuck out of his jaw. Deep gashes covered the chin and throat and the beginnings of a fully-functional esophagus shone through an *especially* wide hole in the neck.

His eyes still seemed to be smiling. There was something off about his skin, too; the horrible way it spasmed and twitched involuntarily, like something alive.

Had I gone loopy from the exhaustion and fear?

I bolted along the path while Natasha stood frozen, arms trembling.

A dark part of my mind urged me to abandon her, but before the thought cemented itself, I quickly clasped my arms around her waist from behind and dragged her along.

The two men crawled after us, Alistair calling our names, yellow jacket making a series of wet gurgles.

We blitzed along the trail cutting through a series of hills, nothing but miles and miles of woodland on either side. Although it didn’t take long to lose sight of our pursuers—two legs are better than four, I guess—Natasha’s limp slowed us way down.

A gust of wet air made my skin shiver. In the months leading up to the trip, my former bff had cycled through excuses for not building up her fitness. My anger cranked up a notch each time, but, since the holiday seemed like the last chance to salvage our relationship, I resisted the temptation to ditch.

“What the fuck is going on?” Natasha asked, her breaths heavy and laboured.

“I don’t know.”

“Did Alistair stab that guy?”

“He must have.”

“Then how did he survive?”

“I don’t fucking know,” I screamed, loud enough to send birds scattering into the air. “We’ve been together this whole time.”

Natasha shot me a sour look. Even after all those years, I could still read her mind from a simple expression.

Despite the danger, I sorely wanted to stop and have it out with her; maybe even bring up that time she kissed my ex-boyfriend, Derick, in the back of a thrift store. Instead, I said, “Look, we can’t be far from the—FUCK.”

“What?” she asked, alarmed.

“The map. It was in my pack.”

Realizing what that meant, Natasha grunted and focused on the trail. We had no map and zero idea which direction the lodge lay in.

None of this made sense. Why had those men walked on all fours? Some kind of fucked-up prank on the out-of-towners?

Waves of dizziness began sweeping over me. Even though my feet became raw slabs of beef, I had no choice other than to press on.

As the sun disappeared beneath the Western hills, we found ourselves stumbling around practically blind. The men might have leaped out at any moment.

The deserted trail narrowed, then climbed. After rounding a sharp bend, I spotted a campfire on the far side of a thicket. We exchanged a quick look of relief before charging through a labyrinth of trees and ferns, zero regard for the scratching bracken.

In the center of a little clearing stood a three-story house with two cars parked outside. A group of adults—two men, two women—who appeared to be in their fifties huddled around a firepit, blankets pulled up around their shoulders. Soft music played from a speaker and the wonderful smell of BBQ hung about as the group sipped wine and joked around, perfectly content.

Covered head to toe in dirt, sweat, and soggy leaves, Tash and I burst from the forest and begged for help. A tall, soft-featured man said, “Calm down ladies. Start again at the beginning.”

I took two deep breaths and then relayed a version of the day’s events, only vaguely recapping the animal impressions just in case they'd assume we’d taken a pile of mushrooms and hallucinated the entire encounter.

“…and the men might still be following us.”

Immediately everyone stepped up; the women threw blankets around our shoulders and led us into the house while the men armed themselves with knives and hiking poles.

In a downstairs kitchen, a lady with curly red hair told Natasha to sit down. “Let me take a look at your foot.”

“Are you a doctor?” Natasha asked, awkwardly easing herself into a seat next to the table.

“A nurse, actually.”

While she slid off her boot and swung her leg onto the nurse’s lap, her friend—an elegant lady with a grey pixie cut and long pink nails—grabbed a phone of its wall holster to call the police.

That foot was worse than I thought, it had turned a hectic red, cracking with yellow, leaky sores.

The nurse said to me, “Can you grab the first aid kit? It’s under that sink.”

I did.

She poured a clear liquid over a cotton rag which she dabbed against the bare foot. Natasha grimaced, her hands balling into tight little fists. I stood behind her and laced my fingers with hers.

After cleaning the wound, the nurse's hands flew over Natasha's foot, wrapping it in a tight bandage. I let my arms around my friend's chest and gave her a hug. She hugged back. It was done. We’d survived.

At the far side of the room, the lady with short hair cradled the phone against her shoulder. “There’s no answer from the emergency services, it’s just ringing out.”

Her friend said, “Let’s drive them down there then. Got your keys?”

She fished them out of her purse and jangled them about.

Quiet suddenly fell across the room as somebody pounded the front door.

“Honey, it’s me.” The kind-featured man said. “Everything’s okay. You can open up.”

His voice had that same giddy quality as Alistair and yellow jacket.

The nurse started toward him but froze as Tash and I erupted in hysterics. “Don’t,” we screamed in unison, a chorus.

Her head whipped between us and the door. “Why not?”

“Pleasssse,” cried the voice from outside.

My throat dried up. “Something's wrong. I can tell by the voice.”

To our left, a window exploded, then two hands shot through the broken frame and wrapped around the jagged edges. Shards of glass plunged into the kind man’s palms as he hoisted himself up and through the gap.

“Roy, what the hell are you doing?” The nurse screamed.

“Give me a kiss darling,” he replied, merrily. Again and again, Natasha and I tried convincing the ladies, who stood rooted on the spot, to come with us, but they couldn't ripe their eyes away from Roy, whose hairy arms got torn to ribbons as he wormed his way through the windowpane. Both ladies shrieked at the sight of exposed tendons and bone.

Seeing no other choice, I snatched the keys away from pixie cut and made for a door on the opposite side of the room.

Still smiling despite the lacerations, Roy fell through the window into the house, the other man coming right after him. Bloody handprints smeared across the floor as the pair circled the table and approached the shocked women.

In a heartbeat, Natasha and I blitzed through another door and along a narrow hallway. Behind us, the women’s screams rose sharply before suddenly stopping.

I slammed the door shut and twisted the lock until it clicked. Now we were in a cramped bathroom with a toilet on the far side. Above it, a narrow window maybe six feet off the ground.

Footsteps travelled across the outer hallway. Among them, the distinctive *click-clack* of sharp fingernails crawling along a wooden floor.

“The window,” I said to Tash. Then, against my better judgment, I said, “You first.”

She put one foot onto the toilet seat, straightened up, and fumbled helplessly with the window lever. Her hands shook so much she only got the damn thing open on the third attempt.

Every so often, something heavy hurled itself against the door while hard fingers scratched away at the wood, like a dog begging to be let outside.

The group called out to us, insisting we let them in, claiming they only wanted to be friends.

Natasha’s foot slipped off the toilet tank. When she next tried getting back up, she accidentally stood on the lever and made it flush.

“Quickly,” I yelled, bouncing on my heels.

What she needed to do was make herself completely horizontal and shimmy through the frame, but she struggled with getting her legs up high enough. Meanwhile, the entrance periodically rattled and bounced.

Tash wriggled halfway through the gap and became trapped at her mid-section. “I can’t get through,” she screamed, her voice wheezy and breathless. I heard the pressure against her diaphragm.

“Suck in your gut,” I screamed, as I tried forcing her through by pushing on the soles of her feet.

“I am.”

The lock keeping us safe gave way then the door smashed open. Five figures—the group plus Alistair—fell into the room, onto their hands and feet. No sign of yellow jacket, though.

Each of them smiled madly as they advanced with their heads facing up, inviting us to join them with some real enthusiasm. Toward the rear, Alistair’s facial muscles shivered and spasmed involuntarily. His face looked swollen and distorted. Huge bulges stood out beneath the skin like prominent tree roots.

I’d had enough. Enough of the trip. Enough of the fucked-up situation. And enough of my *former* best friend.

My arms clamped around a pair of flailing ankles and dragged them backward. With very little effort, Tasha slid loose, fell back into the room, and then hit the floor hard.

In one smooth motion, I leaped onto the tank and grabbed the edges of the window. My eyes flicked back just as the group swarmed over Natasha, who let out a bone-chilling shriek. Hands engulfed her face while she clawed the air like a drowning swimmer.

I pushed all the air out of my lungs and launched myself through the escape hatch and dropped headfirst into a rose bush. Within seconds I'd found my feet and circled the house.

When I hit the unlock button on the car keys a silver Kia chirped. I rushed over, climbed inside, and locked the doors.

As I started the ignition the headlights flicked on, and that’s when I spotted a figure dead ahead.

It was yellow jacket. Except, he didn't look like himself anymore…

Now his skin was alive, pulsating and writhing like a Christmas Turkey stuffed with live maggots. A pale, tentacle-like appendage poked out of the gaping hole where his mouth should have been. It looked like a giant earthworm—a fat, jointless parasite thicker than my entire arm.

Like a prize show horse, he took a little run up and jumped onto the bonnet. The end of that appendage extended out of his throat and whipped around like a fire hose, leaving behind streaks of grey mucus each time it struck the windshield. Moist, loud noises issued from his tightening and relaxing throat.

Tendrils poking out from the corners of his eyes, ears, and nostrils. A whole colony of those things must have been growing and multiplying inside his body since before our earlier encounter.

Past him, the group wandered out of the house and spread around the vehicle. Canines bared, they crawled up the doors and pawed at the windows, their warm breaths fogging up the glass.

“Let us in,” Alistair said from the passenger's side, his voice child-like and watery. Every time he opened his mouth I glimpsed what looked like ramen noodles drooping over his tongue.

“We want to be friends,” added the nurse.

I slammed the accelerator. The Kia thundered forward several metres then I hit the brakes, which caused yellow jacket to go spiraling into a hedge.

I backed up and aligned the vehicle's nose with a path that cut through the forest, but the sudden appearance of Natasha, hunched into an upside ‘V’ as she marched out of the house, made me lock up again. She approached the driver’s side door, her eyes big and shiny. “Becks let’s be friends again. I really miss you.” Her voice sounded all sweet and innocent.

Softly, the others nodded in agreement. "Yes, let's *all* be frends."

"Best friends."

I let out a yelp, pummelled the accelerator, and sped along the trail.

Keeping one eye on the road, I punched an address into a dashboard satnav. My plan was to find a police station and explain the whole fucked-up situation.

But on the outskirts of the nearest village, I came across *more* stooped-over figures. The headlights revealed a series of faces furrowed with bulges; mazes of tendrils threatening to explode out of skin.

I kept driving until my eyelids grew heavy. At one point I jerked awake and realized the sun had risen.

Now seeing two of everything, I pulled into a layby for some rest. Except I couldn’t sleep. Not even for a single second.

And that brings us to now.

I don’t know what to do. The police won’t believe my story—hell, I’m not sure *I* believe it even—so my plan is drive until I hit London. I’ll fill the tank at the next petrol station, provided it’s safe. The radio is on, and if I hear reports about people walking around like animals up North, I’ll catch the Eurotunnel into France, maybe even continue South from there.

So, if you can’t tell, I’ve made an entirely new Reddit account to post this for reasons that will become obvious. Mostly, I want to keep my real name out of this as much as possible. However, if the people I’m hiding my name from find this, I suppose it won’t matter much anyway. 

So I’m sure many of you are familiar with names like Charles “Lucky” Luciano Al Capone, Jimmy Hoffa, James “Whitey” Bulger, and George “Machine Gun Kelly” Barnes. While these guys were all powerful, dangerous, and overall “the bad guys,” but the guys you really need to worry about, as I’ve come to discover, are the mobsters and gangsters whose names you’ve never heard. The background guys that the bosses called on to do the dirty work in the shadows. Another thing I’ve come to find out is that my father was one of these guys working in the shadows.

My dad was always a good father to me, and I honestly don’t have many complaints other than the fact I was left with his sister, my aunt Edna, a lot. Dad was always out “working” as a kid. I just thought all adults went out a lot for “work.” Aunt Edna’s house always smelled like cigarettes and booze. I fucking hated it at Edna's, Edna was always a sweet woman, but she had a lot of “friends” who would come in and out of the house in suits. She always told me they were “business partners,” and as a kid, that made total sense. I think you’re all intelligent enough to see what was happening here. But it took me far longer than I’d like to admit to realize it for myself. 

When I reached my teenage years, dad just started letting me stay home alone. By this time, it was like 2010. I was 15, dad was in his late 40’s and by this time, I had seen a lot of guys who looked like people I’d seen in ‘Scarface’ ‘Goodfellas’ ‘The Sopranos’ and all that stuff coming around for a while now. I had started suspecting that my father maybe wasn’t just “a businessman,” especially since he was always cryptic whenever I asked what exactly his business was 

“Well, J, you’re gonna learn in time. Your old man can’t run the business by himself forever.” He laughed and patted me firmly on the shoulder. I still didn’t have many answers, but I had so many questions. Who the hell was my father? What was he up to at all hours of the day?

As I said, I was 15 now and had things I was much more interested in than my father's comings and goings. One of these interests, of course, was a girl who was supposed to be my wife, Reagan. I started spending a lot of time with Reagan, and my dad seemed pleased to have me out and about more. But my skin always crawled in certain areas of Brooklyn, and other neighbourhoods are good old NYC. I always felt like there were eyes on me. Initially, I thought it was just creeps staring at Reagan, which would make my blood boil constantly. But soon, I realized that the eyes I felt were actually on me, not my wife-to-be.

By the time I turned 20, I’d gotten a job as an apprentice mechanic, despite my father insisting that I didn’t need it because he was “such a successful businessman that we have everything we need, and what we didn’t have, we could get at the snap of our fingers”. By now, I knew that my dad wasn’t as on the up and up as he would like me to think. I knew what a gangster was. I knew he was involved with some less than reputable people. I just didn’t know what his role was. Or how hard it would come back to bite me in the ass.

When I was 21, I asked Reagan to marry me. About a week before our wedding, my father was killed in a drive-by shooting while cutting his grass. He was 55 years old. My “Uncle” Frank, who was really just my dad's best friend that I’d known my whole life, was the one who made the call to tell me. I was devastated. My dad was going to be my best man. Gangster or not, he was still my fucking dad. I was a 21-year-old soon-to-be newlywed, and now I didn’t get to stand up there with the two most important people in my life because I had to postpone my wedding to one of them to put the other in the ground.

I’m sure you’re wondering where my mother was. To be honest, so was I at that point. I didn’t remember much about her, and as I soon learned from Uncle Frank, there was a reason for that and a damn good one too. 

Once we laid my father to rest, and I explained the situation to many people I order to push the wedding back about a year, so I could have time to grieve, I got a call from Frank. 

“Frank, if you’re calling to say Aunty E is dead, I’m going to kill you,” I joked. I’ve always had a dark sense of humour. 

“No, no, no, kid, nothing like that,” he laughed “hey, look, I need you to come by your pops’ old place. I wanna have a chat with you, J.”
“Uhh, alright, when do you need me, Uncle F? Everything okay?” 

his tone had changed from laughter to very serious, almost dark. I had only heard this kind of tone once. When I was about 16, a group of guys in all-black suits knocked on the door and asked for my dad by his full legal name. Which was kind of scary, considering people in suits usually just called him Big J and me Little J

“Today, kid. As soon as you can, I've got to tell you your family's story. Please leave Reagan at home. She don’t need to hear all this.” 

With that, Frank hung up. I was shaking. Frank had never had that tone of voice when we spoke. That was the first time I heard the voice of Frank Capilano, the mobster, and NOT my Uncle Frank. I rushed over to my dad's place. There were about a dozen cars on and around his property. “What the fuck is going on, Frank?” I remember thinking to myself as I walked up to the front door and opened it. About 15 guys were standing around and chatting among themselves when I walked in, then they stopped and took off their hats when I entered the room. 

“Little J!” a voice I recognized but hadn’t heard in many years called from my dad's kitchen. It was the voice of my godfather, Tony Prinela. 

“Tony!!” I smiled and gave the big Italian a hug, and he patted my face 

“Ha, you’re not a kid anymore, my boy! Today you become a man, huh?” he chuckled and smiled widely. Then, my uncle, Frank, entered, looking as serious as he’d sounded on the phone. 

“Come sit down, J” he gestured to the couch, and Tony nodded. I obliged.
“Kid, what do you know about what your dad did to earn his living?”

“I can assume it probably wasn’t legal. I also think it got him killed, but I don't know any of the details if that's what you're asking” there were murmurs and laughter in the room, and Frank smiled. 

“We always told your pops, you were a smart kid. If he woulda let you in, you might have been able to save h-”

“Ay, don’t put that on the kid Franky. He didn’t know what Julian was up to,” a big guy called out from the corner. I’d seen the guy around but didn’t know his name. Frank nodded.

“You're right, sorry, J.” Frank put his hands up in a ‘my bad’ gesture. “I’ll tell you this, though, kid, your dad loved you more than he could ever put into words. Do you remember your mother?” I shook my head “ Of course you don’t, poor Gina” many of the men in the room shook their heads.

“Frank, what the fuck is going on here?” I was getting nervous, and I wanted the hell out of that house. I wish I’d left. A lot of what followed probably could've been avoided.

Frank took a deep breath. “To put it simply, your dad was a mobster J, an enforcer, a courier, a dealer. A hell of a guy.”

Many calls of ‘Salute’ filled the room at those last words.

“Not everyone agrees that he was a good guy, though. Your old man had enemies. Your dad hurt a lot of people, J. He always wanted to keep you out of his work, always wanted to protect you. Now, he’s gone, and he can’t stop me from making you as big and bad as your dad was.”

“Frank, I’m a mechanic. I don’t want this life. I’m getting married in a few months, I’m not doing this. That was dad. That isn’t me. If that’s what he did, that's what he did. I don’t care. I’m not a gangster. God, I’ve barely been in a fist fight” that was a lie, I’d been in plenty, but I wanted these guys to think I was ‘soft’ and leave me out of their shit. But it was already too late.

“Alright, alright, J, I hear you. I understand. Just know this. You ever need help, you call Uncle Frank” he smiled and allowed me to stand and start making my way towards the front door.

“Of course, absolutely, Frank. Thank you, all of you.” I could see disappointment in many of the faces in the room and understanding on the rest. I walked back to my car and lit a cigarette. “What the fuck?” I said out loud as I drove off back to my house.

It was late that night when everything went to shit. My life changed forever because of that meeting, because of Frank. I was just getting out of the shower. Reagan was watching Tv in the living room, right by the front door. I had just pulled on a pair of sweats. It was a Friday night. We always spent Friday nights together. I was brushing my hair when I heard a loud banging noise from the living room, followed by my wife screaming. I rushed out of the bathroom, only half dressed, to see a tall man dressed in a gray sweater and jeans looming over my wife, gripping her hair and pulling her off the couch. I saw light glinting off something in his hand.

“Get the fuck away from her!” I screamed as I charged. He glanced back, smirked and then I heard it. I hear it every night.

BANG!

Reagan screamed again, and I jumped onto the guy's back. Now, I’m not a small man, standing 6’0 or 6’1, and I weigh 200+ pounds, so needless to say, with me on his back, this guy couldn’t exactly stay on his feet. I wrestled him to the ground as Reagan made her way up off the couch, hands around her stomach, whimpering.

“Reagan! Get out, call the cops, get the fuck out of the house, now!” I had never yelled at Reagan before, and she looked a little shocked but nodded and limped her way, wounded and bleeding out, onto the street to a neighbour's house. I slipped the crook of my elbow around this guy's neck and pressed the back of his head forward with my other forearm, and I growled, “You wanna die, or you wanna tell me who the fuck you are?” he said nothing and I locked my legs around his waist to hold him still. Soon, he stopped moving altogether, and I let go.

The cops showed up surprisingly fast, but not before the EMTs rushed Reagan to the hospital, and the cops went in to arrest the guy that shot her. I guess I didn’t kill him after all—what a shame. The cops asked me question after question, to which I didn’t have the answer.

“So, who was the guy?”

“Do you have enemies, son? People that would want to hurt you and your girlfriend?” 

I must have said all kinds of things, “I don’t know about 100 times before they finally released me to go see Reagan, but I wouldn’t get the chance. Reagan had succumbed to her wound on the way to the hospital. She was gone before I could say goodbye. Her family declined to let me see her, they blamed me for her death. Her father asked why I didn’t protect her. I asked myself the same thing. I acted as quickly as I could. The shooter acted faster. I can’t say I’m mad at them for blaming me; I did, too. I still do. I knew only one person would have the answers I needed. Only one person could help me figure out who the fuck killed my fiancée 

“Frank. I need you.”

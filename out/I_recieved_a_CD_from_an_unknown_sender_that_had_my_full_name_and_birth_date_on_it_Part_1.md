It was a chill Tuesday morning when I found it on my doorstep. A DVD case without a cover. Inside the case was a cover-less CD with small black writing on it. I picked the CD case up so I could get a better look at the CD.


"2022-07-26 - Andrew Matthews - Birthday: 2003-05-14"


Who sent this to me? I wondered. My parents thought CDs were outdated. If they left one for me, they'd have already told me they were okay with buying one themselves. They had left on a trip to Winnipeg at 6 AM. If they wanted to watch it with me, why couldn't they have done it before I left?


There was no way it was random, I thought to myself. It had my name and birthdate on it. Even the day I recieved it was written on it. It had to have been given to me by someone I knew. As I speculated about the importance of the disk, my phone vibrated. I checked to find out I had a notification from my friend James.


"What movies are you watching today?"


"Multiverse of Madness probably. First of all though. Did you give me a CD with my full name and birthdate on it? I'm going to check it out before I watch anything," I replied.


"No, I didn't send you anything," he replied.


I put my phone back in my pocket and observed the CD again. I took it with me inside the house. I walked over to the gaming console in my living room. I took the CD out of the case, then I inserted it into the console.


An image of a birthday party came up. I selected the video, then it came up to a full screen. It took a few seconds to load, but then it began to play. Around a dozen people, old and young, were gathered around a kitchen table. A cake with a candle shaped like the number 8 was sitting on the table. Paper plates sat in front of each seat. People wore birthday hats and synth heavy uptempo pop music was playing in the background. It was an average birthday party.


The video was in extreme HD or something. Everything was so clear and 3D looking. The camera POV moved around weirdly too. The screen went dark for a second, then the image returned. There was also a weird thing going on where the sides of the video went out of focus. The video looked like the perspective of human vision.


The clear center of the camera POV focused on the cake, which had a name written on it. My own full name. I thought of it as a fun coincidence, as I didn't have any videos of my 8th birthday party with me. But then I noticed the family members... they looked just like... mine? They looked exactly like my family members. Right down to their mannerisms. They were all talking to each other at the same time, so I couldn't make out what they were saying. It took me a second to recognize the interior of the house too. It looked like the house I used to live in back when I was 8.


Maybe this was a video I forgot about, I thought. But that didn't explain why the camera moved weirdly. Also, it was so HD. HD to the point where it looked like it was taken by a top secret government camera that was far from being released to the public. One that simulated human vision well.


The POV of the camera moved out of the kitchen. It floated so steadily as it moved. Over the course of a few seconds, it floated into a bedroom. It took me a second to realize all the posters, the furniture, the arrangement of everything... all matched the way my bedroom looked when I was 8. My belief wasn't entirely suspended until I saw the stuffed bear on top of the dresser. I then knew for sure the POV was of me in my room, back in May 2011.


No one else was in the room, so I was the only one who could've been filming. I began to think I had filmed something I forgot about. My POV pointed at a small mirror that leaned against the wall. In the reflection was my 8 year old self. He wasn't holding a camera at all. It was as if his eyes were recording the video.


My 8th birthday was fun, but I still barely remembered anything from it other than eating the cake. I waited for the memory I had to replay in the video. The casual gif of me eating a piece of cake from the cake with the 8-shaped candle on it, while a certain song played on the radio, was replayed. I felt the longing of nostalgia for that moment, especially because of the song. An upbeat hip hop ballad about what a true home is.


But it was weird. How was this filmed? I wondered. How was this filmed through my eyes? Was I missing something?


I hit the pause button. It was interesting, but it was weird as well. Who recorded a video through my eyes? How did they do it?


I unpaused the video.


The scenery changed to the exterior of a house. My friend James' house. The camera POV was still the POV of human sight. It approached my friend's door, murmuring something I couldn't make out. It sounded like his voice. He opened his door while looking down at the floor. He saw a pair of shoes pointed towards him. There was someone standing in his hallway. He looked upward.  He noticed a pair of black pants, a black shirt, then a head. One two times taller than a human head. He had inverted black and white eyes along with a glitched looking nose. A sense of dread washed over me as I saw him. The POV jumped.


"Who… are you…?" James asked.


The man walked up to James. He covered James' eyes, making the screen go dark. There was a low hum, during which James let out a muffled painful shriek. Of course, the camera was covered. I couldn't tell what was happening.


My stomach sank. The setting being my own friend's house was chilling enough. I hit the pause button, pausing the video. But was it really him who was attacked? I wondered.


I took out my phone to send James a message.


"The weird DVD I got this morning has weird footage of a tall person suffocating someone in your house"


"I can come over after I take out the garbage"


"Sure," I replied.


I kept the video paused, waiting for James to reply. At 7:23 PM, I got a notification from him, but it wasn't sent by him. Here's what it said:


"Hello, Andrew, I'm James' mom. I can't find James around anywhere. I contacted his other friends but they've said he's not around them. I want to ask if he came over to your house?"


"He said he'd be here after taking out the garbage, but he hasn't arrived yet. It's been three hours," I replied.


"Okay, thanks"


James was 17. He just finished Grade 12. In any other situation, I'd believe James would be okay. But in this situation, his mom was worried. She knows more about James than anyone else. I almost decided to go looking for him myself, but I got another message.


It was a photo of a CD with a message on it:


"2022-07-25 James Creston - Birthday: 10-15-2003"


"Do you know anything about this? Did you send this to him?"


"No, but I got a similar CD from an unknown sender. I didn't send that to him either," I replied.


"Ok, maybe it's something private he made. I won't bother with that. Thanks," his mom replied.


I unpaused the video. The muffled shout turned into a muffled screech that sent chills down my spine.


The scenery changed to the living room of a different house. It looked like the living room of my friend Alexandria's house. The person in the video held a phone up to their face. The screensaver was a selfie Alexandria took just two weeks ago. The time and date was displayed over it, but it included the following day's date.


1:53 PM Wed, July 27


A loud crash, along with the sound of plates shattering, came from somewhere in her house.


"What was that?" a voice asked. It sounded just like Alexandria's voice. She got up from the couch. She murmured to herself as she walked over into the kitchen. When she stepped into the kitchen, the back half of the kitchen was gone. There was a hole in the floor stretching out to the walls. Cupboards, along with half the sink setup, were missing. Interestingly enough, the floor was cut off clean, rather than roughly ripped off like the pieces of the floor still attached to the walls bordering the hole. She slowly walked towards the hole, stopping before getting too close to it. She looked down into the hole. There were smashed plates, pieces of wood from cupboards, broken chairs, a broken table, etc. all over the basement floor. Her focus turned towards the clean cut off part of the floor.


A rummaging sound began to come from the hole. A blurry figure jumped out of the hole, landing on the intact right half of the floor. Alexandria jumped. I did too as I watched it. The figure stood still, allowing me to get a good look at it. It was that man with the unusually tall head. His arms twitched erratically. Its legs looked like they had two knee caps each instead of one. This thing wasn't human. Alexandria ran back into the living room. Once there, her vision went dark. The low hum came back. It was accompanied by a painful muffled shriek. Again, I couldn't see what was happening.


The scenery changed again. This time to a living room. It looked similar to… my living room. The POV of the camera was on the couch, focused on a phone. The background wallpaper matched the one I had on my phone. A picture of myself I haven't posted to social media yet. My heart sank further. The POV focused on the time displayed on the top right. 5:23 PM.


In real life, dread overcame me, assuming the man with the tall head would appear out of nowhere in the video.


The POV floated into the bathroom. I, like many others, have a slight habit of checking behind the bathtub curtain to make sure there's no one there. Some describe it as anxiety, others a weird habit, but there's no time for diagnoses since neither group are likely doctors. A hand pulled the curtain back, revealing a man with an unusually tall head sitting in the bathtub. Its head was buried between its legs.


The man raised his head, staring up at the supposed camera. The man lunged towards the POV and covered it with its arms. The low hum came back again, this time accompanied by a painful sharp scream that sounded like it was coming from an abyss.


I messaged my friend Alexandria:


"You need to watch this. I found a weird CD this morning. It had footage from my perspective not taken by a camera, then a weird man caused damage to your kitchen and did some weird things to us. You need to see it."


"That sounds weird. Is there a way to send it to me?"


"I could record it"


I replayed the video while recording it with my phone. After that, I sent it to Alexandria. Half an hour later, there was a knock on my door. I opened it up. Alexandria was standing outside.


"That video was creepy," she said. "Those looked a lot like our houses, the... phone had my selfie on it... the CD had your name on it, the people even sounded like us. It could be a coincidence but... that was all too close for my comfort. You have the actual video of this?"


We walked into the living room. I replayed the video once more so she could watch it raw.


"And James went missing. Was there any sign of that man with the tall head?" She asked.


"No sign as far as I know," I responded. "The police would've found something."


I paused the video the second she opened her phone to check the time.


"Tomorrow at 1:53 PM, apparently," I said.


"I'll call the police just to be safe. This video looks like a threat video of some sort," she said.


So she told the police about the video, insisting it seemed too close to home to be a coincidence. She didn't tell them about the abnormal head, which I assumed was because no one would believe us if we detailed it. The police offered to stick around both of our houses for the entirety of Saturday afternoon. They asked us if we had anywhere to stay for the time being. Alexandria said she'd text her other friends. I decided to do the same thing right then.


An hour later, there was a knock at the door. It was an officer.


"Hello, I am Officer Clint. You called about a threatening video?" he asked.


"Yes, some guy in a costume made a weird video of my friends and I being attacked at our houses. One friend has disappeared so far," Alexandria said.


"Well, let me have a look," Officer Clint said.


I played the video for the officer. He nodded his head multiple times as he watched it. When he finished, he asked if any of our neighbors were irrationally angry with us. We told him no. He asked us if we knew when it was filmed. We both said no.


The officer watched the video three more times. He had the most intense look of disbelief on his face.


"We're going to stick around. Please remain as calm as you can, we're going to deal with this," the officer said.


"We understand," Alexandria and I said.


The officer took quick steps up the stairs. As he opened the door, I heard him say something into his radio.


"10-80" the officer said. "I know, but I've encountered him before."


Was this happening to other people too? I wondered. If so, how many? There's no way my friends and I were special or unique. Weirder things have happened though.


None of Alexandria or I's friends got back to us. We thought about messaging our family members, but we both noted they lived too far away or were on personal vacations at the moment. My stomach sank as I realized there was no place to stay for the time being.


"Maybe it's just a prank. I mean, I hope it is," Alexandria said. "James could've gone missing for some other reason. We don't truly know if it's connected to whatever this is. He still got our houses down perfectly though. It's still creepy."


I was ready to hold on to the same hope. There was no definite proof those videos were real, right? I hoped.


We took our minds off of the situation by watching movies and TV. We thought we only had to really start worrying the next day. But we were wrong. At 1 AM, I got up to get a drink of water. When I turned the kitchen light on, I saw it a red face floating above the floor. It wasn't attached to a body. It was just floating. It had a fierce expression of anger, with a glare that looked murderous. It gave off the impression of pure evil. I somehow felt its intention. Like it was speaking to me telepathically, but in the way that it gave me a vague but general idea of what its intention was. To put me through the worst hell imaginable. Dread rushed through me. I felt frozen. Its eyes looked like a dozen different eyes were staring at me at once. All with the same intensity. The same intention.


After what I assume was a minute, the face floated off to the side. When it hit the wall, it didn't stop. Instead, it melted right through the wall. It left a hole behind. I peeked into it. The face had disappeared, only having left the small hole behind. While it scared me, it also felt weird. While standing in confusion, my phone vibrated. I checked and found I had a message from Alexandria.


"I just walked into my living room and saw a giant red face. It scared me to death. What the hell is happening? Have you seen anything like this?"


"I saw a red face too. It was in my kitchen. It freaked me out. It was so evil looking. It looked like it was angry at me," I replied.


I went back to bed. After I fell asleep, I had a dream about the red face. It slowly approached me while screaming in a way I couldn't imagine. The screams sounded human at first, but then they became animalistic. It went on for a few seconds before the face stopped moving. It stopped screaming as well. A loud rushing that sounded like a waterfall surrounded me. I awoke in cold sweats, sitting up on my bed.


The next morning, I walked into the kitchen to find a head shaped hole in the wall, next to the microwave. What is going on? I asked myself, confused. I needed time to comprehend what had happened. The face was real though. That's all I knew. I stepped into the livingroom and found the video from the CD was playing on the TV. I hadn't turned it back on at all. No one else could've as no one was in the house that night. The part of the video that took place in my house was playing. When that part ended, that specific part began to play again. I used the controller to close the video and turned the console off.


I hesitated to walk back into the bathroom although walking in there during the 5 PM hour was the only thing I had to avoid doing. That seemed too easy though. There was no way the man with the tall head would back out of its plan just because it couldn't be in one specific place at one specific time, right? I thought. It was just speculation though. I didn't know how the man worked.


Nobody has answered any texts asking if I can stay over for the time being. No seen receipts have popped up either. Any of them would always get back to me in an hour or less. Sure, maybe longer sometimes, but not longer for everyone with the different schedules. Nobody responding for over 12 hours isn't normal. I hope they aren't missing too. Although, I believe that would've been reported on the news by now. Especially if multiple people went missing at once. Maybe the wifi is bad. Although, messages tend to be auto sent once you get back online.


Anyway, Alexandria arrived a few hours ago. Her parents wanted her to stay at my house, even though the creature was going to be at my house as well. Alexandria told me she agreed with them, because there are safer implications due to us being near each other. More police would be around. Also because I'm her friend. That's the stuff she said.


I'm just too confused right now. And there's nowhere to go. Not even the police station. Apparently, according to one of the officers, the police station and all other nearby ones aren't open to visitors due to a disruption they aren't allowed to disclose the details of to anybody. He said he nor any of the other officers are allowed to know the details and that a disruption is happening isn't allowed to be reported on the news. Great. There's something after me and there's nowhere to go. The thing would probably find me anyway, so there really is no option.


As for the man with the tall head situation, I have no idea what to expect. All I know is that whatever this is, it's the real deal. It's currently around 1:30 PM July 27th. Not too long before 1:53 PM and 5:23 PM… I'll see how things will go. Hopefully I'll get out of this without any pain.

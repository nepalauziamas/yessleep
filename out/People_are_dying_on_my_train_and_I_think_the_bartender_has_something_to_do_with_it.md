I enter my train and go over to the conductor, David, to give him my ticket. A short conversation began in which I learned of a bar onboard. He told me Kate, the bartender, recently broke up with her boyfriend so don't bother her. Before leaving, he asked me why I was on the train. I said that I was looking into franchises for my business. I left to the bar and I can only now remember being dragged by Kate to my bed.

David's brother Joel was dead when I awoke. We thought he died from seizure/heart attack. I felt awful for not meeting him before he died. I just slept mostly. Then rudely at 11:00 PM David woke us all up. He said all his family died already and it was time to join him. He went to a ladder outside, climbed up, went to the front of the train, and jumped. We stopped the train and sent 2 people (Good time to mention there were 9, 2 dead now) to find what was left of him. 20 minutes later they come back with a blob of blood and flesh and bone, I named it David-Mess. I went to sleep after they came back.

øøøoooo

About 3:30 I heard gunshots. I thought it was hunters. Not more then ten minutes and a scream from Kate woke me. The 2 finders of David-Mess did the unthinkable. The 3 others came and made me remember we didn't share names. They were Mark, Jacob, and Sam. Sam thought Kate did all this. I said it's not unlikely but to not accuse her without proof. We looked around for clues but found nothing. We decided to stay up.

øøøøooo

Nothing happened. We thought okay, Joel died presumably via heart attack and David ended it all and after seeing his remains the 2 guys also ended it all. Of course, like every killer movie, we let our guard down and it was a big mistake.

øøøøøoo

Sam was killed. We locked Kate in a overhead compartment and locked it. We just watched it all day, we were very nervous.

øøøøøøo

Jacob died. Somehow Kate got out. I should have left, but I kinda wanted to know what would happen.

Kate woke us up by firing a shotgun at the wall. Mark lunged, but was killed on the spot. She then asked, "Ready to die?" It was only then I realized the true identity of Kate, my Ex. I put it all together right then. She killed Joel, made it look like a heart attack. She knew David would end himself if Joel died. She made the death of the 2 guys look like the unthinkable. I kicked her face, probably broke her nose, then ran and called the cops. They  found her and before arrest she killed herself. I can't believe she did that because of me. I'm going to therapy now and my life is semi-same, just, whatever happens be careful

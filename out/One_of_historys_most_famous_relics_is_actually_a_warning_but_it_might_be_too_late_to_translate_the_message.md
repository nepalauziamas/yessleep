“They cracked the Rosetta Stone,” Jim hissed into the phone.

I shifted my attention away from the ancient copy of *Walden* in my lap and tried to focus on what he was saying.

Which is how I discovered that I was more buzzed than I had previously thought.

“They cracked the Rosetta Stone 197 years ago, Jim,” I explained impatiently as I stood up against the protests of my knees. “I know that the Psychology department doesn’t like hard facts, but-”

“No, Francis, they *cracked* the Rosetta Stone. It happened an hour ago.”

The fog of confusion was slowly clearing. “Wait. You mean they smashed it like a horde of careless Romans erasing non-Christian history?”

“YES, Francis. And as the world’s foremost expert on the Demotic language, I assumed you’d be home on a Saturday night with no plans.”

“That’s-” I looked down at *Walden* sitting on the couch where I’d left it. “That’s a vicious half-truth.”

“Which half?” Jim pressed. “Are you going to tell me that you’re not at home alone, reading Thoreau and sipping Scotch?”

“No,” I snapped.

I was glad that I was alone, because my face was flushing badly. 

“Bourbon, then?” he asked confidently.

I stared abashedly at the half-empty bottle of Pappy Van Winkle. “Yes.” I paused again. “Look, is there something you want to tell me?”

“No,” he breathed excitedly, “There’s something I want to show you.”

“So *why* is the Stone at Brown University?” I asked as Jim and I walked at a frantic near-jog through the campus. I could hear the nearby thrumming of speakers at a dorm party. It triggered a deep nostalgia for my own undergrad Saturday nights spent listening to people gathered at nearby parties.

“You know it’s taking a clandestine tour of New England, right?” Jim wheezed. The speed of our walk was much harder on him than it was on me. “They don’t announce when it’s moving, and *very* few people even know that it’s left the British Museum. Anyway, it’s Brown’s turn next week, and *voila,* the idiots showed up on our doorstep early with no announcement and even less fanfare.”

“Idiots?” I asked incredulously.

He stepped in front of me and stopped walking for dramatic effect, but seemed glad for the opportunity to catch his breath. “What else do you call people who drop one of the most important artifacts in the history of your field?”

I tried to swallow, but my throat was parched. “Just how badly is cracked? Is an entire piece missing?”

His eyes seemed to sink into his skull. “You’re not understanding,” he explained in a low tone. The cool night air ruffled his receding hairline, but he remained frozen in place. “It’s split down the middle.”

My stomach dropped. “They cracked it in *half?*”

“Yes,” Jim responded gravely as we turned around and continued under Wayland Arch, “But you don’t realize *which* half.”

I wanted to cry. “Does it *matter?* The Rosetta Stone is one of the most significant pieces-”

“Oh, Francis,” Jim continued as he ran a hand through his graying hair, “You have *no idea.*”

I could tell that something was wrong when we went underground. Why the hell would the Rosetta Stone be hidden in a basement?

I had worked at Brown for nine years, but the forgotten door at the end of a forgotten hallway in the Geo-Chem Building had never seemed important to me.

We had been enjoying the wonderful 48 hours between “terrible New England winter” and “awful New England summer.” But when I stepped down those stairs, a chill crept under my tweed blazer, latched onto my skin, and took up residence there for the duration of my time underground. 

The sterile room we entered did nothing to assuage that chill. Nor did the silent, pale woman who stood next to the table in the center.

The man in the corner wearing sunglasses comforted me even less. He might have been looking at me. I didn’t know.

But my mind was quickly preoccupied with what lay on the table. 

A lifetime of academia had instilled in me a near-holy reverence of certain objects. I’d almost drooled over a Gutenberg Bible in the Huntington Library outside Los Angeles, and had spent 30 minutes frozen in place when I saw the Book of Kells as an undergrad living in Dublin. Witnessing the Rosetta Stone would have been a spiritual experience if it were not for the horror of its condition.

My head swam as I absorbed the extent of the damage. It had cracked so that its front face had separated from its back face, resulting in two thinner facsimiles of the original.

“What have you done?” I whispered.

“Professor Francis Nelson?” The pale woman asked sharply. I nodded in a daze. “You can read fluent Ancient Egyptian – both hieroglyphic and Demotic scripts – in addition to Ancient Greek, correct?”

I nodded, then shook my head. “It’s – it’s already been translated, nearly two centuries ago. You don’t need me to-” 

“We need you to explain what’s inside,” she continued forcefully.

“What’s – what’s inside *what?*” I responded in confusion.

She pointed. I leaned forward.

The inside of the Stone was now exposed to the outside world for the first time, I presumed, since the granodiorite rock was formed by underground magma millions of years ago. 

So I had no idea how I was looking at an inscription that had been written *inside* the Rosetta Stone.

“Do you understand it?” the pale woman continued. 

I stared at the words in front of me. Vertigo threated to render me unconscious. “Of course I do,” I responded with a trembling breath.

“It’s written in Modern English.”

“That’s-”

“Impossible,” I cut Jim off. “Because the Rosetta Stone was carved two millenia ago, but Modern English is only five centuries old.”

“No,” the pale woman continued urgently, “Do you understand what’s written?” 

Slack-jawed, I stared back down and began to read the message that could not possibly have been there. 

I read. I understood. 

I struggled to breathe.

I snapped my head to the pale woman, then to the man in the corner, then back to Jim. 

“It says,” I explained in a trembling voice, “That ‘We will return in 2,217 years, for that will be the end.’”

“And?” Jim asked darkly.

“And,” I continued through ragged breaths, “I can tell you that the Rosetta Stone was carved [2,216 years ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/ByfelsDisciple/).”

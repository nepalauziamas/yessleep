Sometimes I drive down the forested roads at night. Exactly why? I'm unsure. The serenity of the cold night air, the nothingness the car lights illuminate, the never ending road, the woods that surround both sides of me like a tunnel. It's not easy to explain to someone. When I'm not driving through the night I'm usually writing for fun. But this time it isn't fun. I don't want to write about what I've seen. But I must.

Friday morning I awoke from a dream. It wasn't a dream that made sense to me but dreams aren't supposed to. It was a dead land being consumed by nothing. But it didn't make sense to me. If something is consumed by nothing, then it was nothing to begin with. The thought soured my day for some reason. I must seem thin-skinned if a middle school philosophical question is enough to ruin my day, but it was more than that. A feeling that seemed to cling to my mind. It gave me the anticipation of inevitability. For what, I don't know. I'm a rational person but feelings transcend rationale.

&#x200B;

Before I write about the trip I just want to mention that I keep a gun in my glove compartment. I just keep it there to be safe. One of the perks of being American I guess.

&#x200B;

My nightly trip started. Gliding down a dark road while my car lights shone on the pavement. My thoughts started to drift and I began to lose myself in them, driving almost automatically. Throughout the day I had forgotten about the dream, at that moment I remembered the dream but not the dream itself if that makes sense. It doesn't but I digress.

&#x200B;

An hour had passed by like a gale of wind in this hazy night. As I drifted down the road, I felt my vision betraying me. Every now and then I would see something in the corner of my eye, then I would turn to look and there'd be nothing. Every time it happened it be too quick to even describe it. Though it kept happening again and again. I swear I wasn't tired as I napped prior. Maybe it was deer? Could deer move that quick. The more it happened the more paranoia entered my brain. It seemed more than a bad feeling. I expected something... No. A deer or moose to dart across the road.

&#x200B;

The leaves and branches that encompassed me were flailing in the air as if they were drowning in the dark sky. The bad feeling clung to my mind, and I was completely unable to make sense of it driving down the road. Like creeping closer to inevitability. I began to hear something that wasn't the hum of the car. It was so quiet I couldn't identify it. But the minutes passed, and I began to understand it more and more. It was... Whispering. I could feel the hairs on my arm begin to stand. Maybe I was just tired and hearing and seeing things. Sleep deprivation does make you see and hear things. 

&#x200B;

I saw it again in the corner of my eye to my right, then left. I was unsure if something was even there, maybe it was just leaves floating through the wind. The whispering was getting higher in volume I brought the vehicle to a halt. I tried to hear where it was coming from but, it just didn't make sense. It had to have been loud enough to hear through the car. But it was whispering, it didn't make sense because how could whispering be loud enough to hear through a car?  I couldn't even understand what they were saying. Every direction was filled with it. I was so... confused. Dread was seeping in. 

&#x200B;

Tearing myself from the shock I decided that this was enough for this night. I'm not driving down a dark road while... I don't know some fucking cultists are trying to summon their dark lord deep in the woods. While I was about to turn into the other lane, I felt something crashing to the ground. I looked up and saw a goddamn tree had fallen in the road about thirty feet away. I tried my best to rationalize it but how the fuck does a tree fall down like that. It wasn't storming and it was no where near as windy as it needed to be to knock a damn tree over. 

&#x200B;

Then there was the corner of my eye bullshit again. I was so fed up with this shit. It seemed to be moving so fast just at the edge of my vision yet every damn time I look it's gone. Then IT came back. Everywhere all at once from every direction. No. No. I was done with this I thought. Not caring if there were cars coming in the other lane I shifted to the other side. Then I put my foot to the gas and sped back the way I came. The whispering wouldn't stop so I flipped the radio on to drown it out. I turned the volume dial all the way up. The car shook as if a building was falling down nearby. Minutes passed. Then an hour, and I felt as though I was gonna vomit with the way the bass shook my innards. I hesitantly flipped it off. Then it was gone. It was gone at last. I've never felt so much relief in recent memory.

&#x200B;

Driving back I began to lose myself in thought. You know maybe I was just hearing things. Maybe the nap didn't do as much as I thought it would have. and through my peripheral I noticed something that lay in the center of the road. At first I thought it was a deer that lay there, but as my eyes focused, I could see that it was a person, a man. He just lay there, no blood, no puke, no foam at his mouth, nothing to tell me that his situation was dire. It just looked like he had decided to nap in the middle of the road. At this point I was tired, shaken. I wanted the night to be over. I didn't want to get out to help this man I just wanted to go home. But this was the way home, and I can't just run someone over. Even if they are already dead. I prepared myself and braced for the worst.

&#x200B;

Before I opened the door, I opened the glove compartment and grabbed my gun to prepare myself for the worst, I shoved it into my waistband and reached for the door. It clicked open and the cold winds rushed against my face. With the silence of the night, any noise is deafening, as shown to me with trees that shook with the wind. I slowly walked to the unconscious man as the possibilities flowed through my head. Was he drunk? Did he have a heart attack. The paranoid part of me suspected this was an ambush by forest crazies. I neared the man.

&#x200B;

A putrid stench approached me before I did the man. I scanned the surroundings around me to be cautious. There was nothing but the darkness in every direction but one. I turned my head down towards the man, and was able to get a much better look at him. Although it seemed as though more questions were brought to me, rather than answers. And he did stink like hell.

&#x200B;

 It was so strange. It seemed as if the man was a cosplayer. Or perhaps into some type of convention. His face was covered in dirt or mud. His hair was dark, scraggly and greasy, along with his beard as well. He wore a type of leather coat, with strings tying it together on the front. The coat didn't have sleeves but rather he wore some kind of white shirt under it. His pants were dark and his... shoes? Came up to his shins and were fastened with strips of leather. All of it was torn up and filthy looking. He wasn't appropriately dressed for this era, as strange as that sounds.

&#x200B;

I was hesitant to try to wake the man in case he was drunken and belligerent, or just belligerent, but I felt the need to be a good samaritan. And I needed to go home. I knelt down and gently shook the man. He remain steadfast asleep or so I thought. I shook the man again and again less gentle each time, but he remained unconscious. I feared the worst, I feared he wasn't asleep. I put my fingers at the base of his neck to feel a pulse. But there was no pulse. I put my hand on his chest, no beat. My hands were shaking, mind racing. I stood up and stepped back, grabbing my phone from my pocket, unsure of if I'd even get reception this far away.

&#x200B;

The whispering was brought back to life rather than the man. This time it was louder. I couldn't hear myself think. I couldn't hear myself scream. I covered my ears yet it seemed to pierce through my hands. It came from everywhere in a language I didn't understand from a... Time I didn't understand? I can hear it again now as I write this. The clicking of my keyboard that was so prevalent in this quiet room was killed with this goddamn whispering. It won't stop it cant stop i need it to stop please i just need it to stop make it fucking stop please Verba nihil plaga mens mea, nunc iterum. Cum venit mihi lucrum lingua lingua non est locutus, et scientia, quod tormentis animum. In mussitantes, similis est creatura, quod seeps inter praeteritum, memoria, et futurum. Cum vult. Erit excipiant, ex memoria in re. Utinam non ad maledictionem cum scientia scio nunc, sed non post, sed volo monere. i just dont know whats happening i need to sleep continue tomorrow

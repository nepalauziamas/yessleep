I wanted to celebrate my graduation with my friends, but instead ended up doing something we would regret our whole life.

It all started when I was sitting with my friends in my room giving each other ideas for our graduation party, and that was when I got the idea that we would go do it in my old grandpa's house. It sounded like the perfect place since no one lived in it or near it so we could party as much as we wanted.

So we started giving invitations to our friends and even some old classmates, we would go every day there to decorate and prepare the house, but it was exhausting since it was at least a 1 hour drive between the house and any house/store/mall...

It took us 2 weeks to prepare this party thinking it was worth it not knowing what would happen. My friends and I arrived early obviously because we were the hosts, and waited for the others to come. while we were waiting for them we were walking around the house making sure that everything was perfect and ready.

While I was walking around I found a whole room we didn't know was there, but before opening the door, someone knocked on the front door so I just ran exited thinking everyone has arrived but later disappointed that it was just our pizza delivery, and I forgot about the room that I had found. Hours pass and no one arrives and we start getting bored and thinking that no one wants to come to our party, until I get a notification on my phone that a hurricane is coming to my city and that everyone had to stay home.

Of course we were sad that we had to postpone the party but we were more sad and worried that we had to stay in this old house that has no electricity or water. So we were there just sitting in a big empty house doing nothing just waiting for the hurricane to stop not knowing if it will take a day, two days, a week or even more. Because I remember remember seeing a documentary about hurricanes and knowing that it could last a whole month, I was worried the most out of my friends.

When it becomes midnight we go upstairs to sleep without eating anything in case we needed the food later. But of course I couldn't sleep and I kept overthinking that we were gonna starve or get dehydrated so I decide to go sit downstairs and read a book next to the window from the light of the moon. After reading a couple of pages I suddenly remember the room I saw earlier and go there to see whats inside, so I open the door and slowly walk in not knowing what would I find, and even tho it was so dark and couldn't see anything I just kept walking and walking but stopped when I heard a very low whisper in my ear saying "Get out" at first I thought that I was imagining because I was so tired and haven't slept in 2 days, until the same voice this time kept on shouting "GET OUT" so of course I go running out of the room but trip and hit my head on the floor and pass out.

Next thing I remember was me waking up in the room upstairs that we were suppose to sleep in but I was alone and the house was very quiet. I go downstairs looking for my friends and when I found them I asked them how did they carry me all the way upstairs but they all laugh and tell me that I was already sleeping up and never actually went down. I keep on telling them what I saw last night but they didn't believe me so I go to show them the room but its not there...it simply just disappeared.I kept convincing myself that I was dreaming since there was no actual proof that what I saw was more than a dream.

My friends and I then sat down and opened the pizza boxes to eat but it was gone, someone had ate all the pizzas, we didn't know who it was so we all fought and blamed each other on it until we saw some pizza crusts on the floor leading to a room were we found that a rat that had ate all the pizza. But we were chocked when we saw a lot of food and drinks in that same room, we were so happy that I forgot about my weird dream. We all take a plate full of food and a drink and go sit in the living room, and that was when I saw my book that I read yesterday...(to be continued)

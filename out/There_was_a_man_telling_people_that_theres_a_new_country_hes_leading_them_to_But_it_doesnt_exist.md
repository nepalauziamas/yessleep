There was a man telling people that there's a new country he's leading them to. But it doesn't exist.


It sounds absurd. We’re a small town in the middle of nowhere.  I could understand maybe a nearby city or even a neighboring country, but the place he's talking about doesn't even exist. I don't even know why everyone is believing him.


I'm getting ahead of myself. 


It started about six months ago, where things were better. 


I live in a simple small town. A religious place, but nothing extraordinarily crazy. Yeah, we have more churches than restaurants, but other than the Sunday swarms of cars in church parking lots and "I Love Jesus" bumper stickers, it isn’t a place that is overly swarmed with religion. You could have friendly conversation with one another, meet each other at the local buffet, gossip about small town life and be cordial with one another. In other words, faith is just a matter of one's personal business, and talk about it doesn’t go any further than a hammering neighbor shouting "God dammit" after he smashed his finger instead of a nail.


Things got a bit more unstable when he showed up, though. 


He was in the middle of the town's square on a Sunday morning, when church was in session. He was wrapped in cloth that clung to his skin so tightly, you'd think he had some sort of horrible skin condition rather than seeing them as clothes. 

He didn't really move, either. He stood in the same spot, with his head tilted up towards the sun, and both of his hands cupped forward, like he was expecting rainwater to fill them up. His long, greasy brown hair was bound in messy braids that hung down below his shoulders. He was clearly mouthing something, in wide and exaggerated gestures. Like he was putting on a stage play, and he really wanted the audience to be sure he was speaking. But what was strange about it, is that no actual sound came out. Or if it did, it was extremely quiet.


Eventually, as the church congregants were let loose back into the world, this babbling man began attracting a crowd. Normally every middle-aged couple and suburban family would crowd into the diners and movie theaters on a Sunday afternoon, but for some strange reason, they seemed more focused on this street performer than just going on about their day. 


I don’t go to church. I like to keep my beliefs to myself, and the last thing I want to do is sit around for hours and listen to some guy say how great Jesus is. So as peculiar as this sight was, I wasn’t going to hang around for what seemed to be another sort of sermon. 


Later that night, I figured I’d stop by the town square for some soda and snacks. Normally it’s dead quiet on a Sunday night, save for the 3 stores that stay open past 7pm. But something was different that night. It was filled with people. 


Eyeing the crowd, it seemed to be the exact same group that was there earlier, except even more people joined in. And of course, in the focus of everyone’s attention, was that babbling man. Although, he seemed…different. His previously tight clothing begun to unfurl into draping sheets. His greasy, tied hair looked freshly rejuvenated and sat on his shoulders. He was still mouthed something, but instead of a wild man exaggerating his mouth, he was composed and calm. The only thing that stayed the same were his hands, still cupped forwards. 


I thought, screw it, if practically the entire town was interested in…whatever the hell was going on, I might as well check it out. This weirdo must have had something about him that I judged too early.


The closer I moved towards the crowd, the more everything felt, lighter. Quieter. Calmer. Each step was like moving into a basking warmth that grew evermore tranquil the further I moved forward. There was no sound, save for a whisper. 


“Greetings, my child.”


Who was that? Why was this the only sound I could hear?


“Come help me usher in a new era of peace. Let us create a new Eden for ourselves. We can all move together to a new plane of existence—a new country—a new home. Godsond.”


What the hell? Was it the man who spoke? I looked up to his face, and despite his mouth speaking something, it did not match to the words that spoke to me.


“Come join our covenant. Let us be as one and migrate to our new home.”


Despite my feelings of elation, my mind screamed at me to turn around and run. It might have felt like immense pleasure, but my anxieties cracked any feeling of happiness. It began to feel hotter. It was no longer a loving warmth. It was suffocating. I couldn’t breathe. 


“We will make a new home—all of us—in God’s-”


The voice was interrupted as soon as I stepped out of the crowd. 


I looked back, and every single person in the crowd wasn’t making a sound. The babbling man continued mouthing words, and the audience looked forward, smiling gleefully and applauding. Their hands clapped together, but no sound came from them. 


And then, all the sound returned all at once like a cup being lifted from a speaker.
 

The crowd started cheering and clapping and begun to disperse from the square. The crowd goers spoke to one another about how life changing the so-called “sermon” was. How this event was the most heartfelt and amazing thing they’ve ever witnessed. There were young couples, children, families, the elderly. Every type of person could be found at this gathering. What seemed to tie everyone together, though, were that they all were church goers. 


I hung around and waited for everyone to leave. I wanted to see this babbling man and see what his deal was. How did he make me feel like that? It sure as hell weren’t the words he was “speaking”. It was some sort of aura that I couldn’t explain. I needed to know how he did it.


The issue is, as soon as everyone else left, he wasn’t there. I ran to the center of the square where he previously stood. The only evidence anyone was there at all were what seemed to be two burnt silhouettes of feet.


…


This occurrence happened weekly. Every Sunday. The babbling man stood in the center of the town square. Greasy tied hair, tightly wrapped in cloth. Hardly anyone around. But then as soon as church was let out, a large crowd formed. The entire mood shifted, and his form changed from a crazed man to a glowing prophet. His hair unfurled onto his shoulders into luscious locks and the tight cloth became a beautiful flowing robe. All the noise was absorbed, and the square became quiet until the sermon was done, and then everyone left. 


Again, and again. This silent sermon became more and more frequent. It no longer happened only on Sundays and gained popularity after church. It happed daily. His crowds absorbed half the town. No one went to church anymore. This was the new place of worship.


Before, when the sermons were less common, crowd-goers would just say vague statements about how they felt. It was usually just how they felt physically and spiritually. How happy they felt. However, when the crowds got larger and the sermons became more frequent, the discourse throughout the town became more… ominous. 


Religious conversation became more frequent. Before it was something people kept private, but now it was something that everyone needed to speak about. Nearly every moment of every day.

Daily life became more dismal. It was like everyone felt the simple act of living was exhausting. Our town was nothing more than a black hole absorbing hopes and dreams and vitality. The only solution was to get out. Get out and move to Godsond.


That place the babbling man spoke about to me. I kept seeing it more often. Hearing about it more often. When people began leaving the silent sermons, they began speaking about, “leaving this wretched existence” and moving to this new place. Shops closed up. People stopped going to work. Children stopped going to school. Their parents believed it unnecessary, as it was only a distraction for what was to come. The windows and buildings around town were scrawled with messages like, “Leaving for Godsond”, and “We no longer need these shells”. 


Some house fires broke out and were left to burn. Even the firefighters abandoned their duties to the town. The possessions left behind in the blaze, even if pets or people were stuck inside. They no longer mattered if it wasn’t for the purpose of leaving to Godsond.


It seemed nearly everyone in town was invested in this journey. However, there were a few holdouts. And those holdouts were outright shunned by everyone else. If they weren’t flat out ignored, they were attacked. Insults or beatings were common if there were “nonbelievers” in Godsond. It wasn’t uncommon to find bruised and bloodied bodies strewn around alleyways or in front yards. An unusual trait found on these bodies were charred handprints burned into their skin.


Godsond didn’t exist. There wasn’t a town nearby named Godsond. There wasn’t even a “Godsond Avenue” nearby. And there sure as shit wasn’t a country nearby with that name.


But the way these believers spoke about it seemed like it was right next door. It was insane. 


These believers abandoned everything they had. Their homes, their churches, their pets, their children. The only thing they needed were the clothes on their back. And their faith in their prophet: the babbling man.


…


The last sermon was held on the outskirts of town. It was in the middle of the only road leading out. 


This was the only new place I’ve seen the man. I haven’t seen him anywhere else other than the town square. I haven’t even seen him physically move. He looked as he usually did when there was a large group surrounding him. His robed flowed in the wind, his mouth moved, and his hands were cupped forward. 


There were hundreds of people this time. That might not seem like a lot, but for our town, that was over half of the population. 


Everything went as it usually did. A silent sermon of people silently cheering, and this static man at the front, unmoving save for his lips and the wind blowing his hair and robes. 


Eventually, the sound returned. But instead of the sermon ending, the man’s hands changed.


Black sand poured from the cracks in his fingers. Maybe it was ash? But it streamed from his hands and blew away towards the crowd, dusting anyone nearby.


The entire audience stared, silent. It was clear that they weren’t silent due to the sermon’s muffling effects. They were stunned at what they were seeing. It was some sort of sign.


The sand stopped pouring. And for the first time since he appeared, the babbling man moved his hands down. His lips stopped moving and the only audible sound were his robes in the wind. 


“Godsond awaits” 


The man walked out of town. His feet were bare and charred. It was the first time I truly noticed.


His worshippers followed behind. None of them made any noise save for their shuffling on the pavement. Some had blistered feet and burnt shoes.


…


We’ve been repairing the town from the vandalism and arson. It has been weeks since the mass of townspeople disappeared into the horizon. No one has heard anything from them. Mothers called their children. Sisters tried reaching out to their brothers. The newly orphaned children waited for their parents to return. But we haven’t heard anything from them. 


They said they were going to Godsond, and I suppose they found it. I’m not sure what was so horrible about our life here. But apparently it was so bad, they decided to leave everything behind, all in search of some made-up paradise.


There have been reports several miles south out of town. It appears some sort of fire occurred in one farmer’s field. A giant scorch mark scarred a large chunk of the ground. Half the size of a football field. Hundreds of charred footprints were impressed into the ground, seemingly leading towards the scorch mark.


Another peculiar detail were these weird circular grooves pressed into the ground. They almost looked like giant burnt fingerprints. I understand now. It wasn’t Godsond. 


It was God’s Hand.

Hello my name is Phil and I am 19 years old. Yesterday my mother and father saw me for the first time in 15 years. It would have been an amazing moment had I not been lying on the front yard of their house blindfolded with my arms and legs tied together. I woke up this morning to our house filled with all of our close family members and a couple of reporters. A police officer showed up at around 3 pm, but he told us he would just wait around till everyone left. The reporters tried to get information out of me, but I was not in the mood to give them any information. My aunt and uncle asked me if they hurt me, but before I could tell them no another reporter started to bombard me with questions. Annoyed, I left the living room and sat in the kitchen for the next hour. 
 
Everyone left except the police officer around 4 pm. He asked me if he could speak with me in private. We went to the kitchen and took our seats at the dining room table. He took out a notepad and with a forced smile on his face he told me to call him “Matt”.

*Me- So Matt I honestly don’t know who took me or where I was.*

*Matt- That’s fine I just have a couple of questions. How many other people were with you?*

*Me- Well in total around 25. When I left there were around 17.*

*Matt- All males? Or were there any females?*

*Me- All males.* 

*Matt- What was the general age group?*

*Me- No one was under 4 or over 20.*

*Matt- Did the people that took you hit anyone?*

*Me- Not that I know of. They never laid a hand on me. They did shoot anyone that tried to leave the house. 4 tried to escape while I was there. 1 survived the gunshot and returned to the house the next day. He never said another word to any of us after that. A couple of people were found dead the next morning after they didn’t follow a rule, but we never saw them get killed. Not even the person staying in the room with them would notice when they came into the room or how the person was killed.*  

*Matt- They? How many people were there?*

*Me- I only saw 2 on guard at a time, but the people seemed to change all of the time.*

*Matt- Can you describe what the place looked like?*

*Me- It was a house. A really big house. Not very fancy, but it had around 12 rooms. We all had our names written on a whiteboard next to our specified room. Our fridge was always stocked with enough food for all of us. We had a tv in the living room, but we never could find any channels that worked on it. Each of our rooms had 2 beds and 2 small dressers which contained only 3 of the same outfits. We had a laundry room with a washer and a dryer, but they would only work on Thursday.*

*Matt- 3 of the same outfits? What was the outfit?*

*Me- It was a plain white t-shirt and blue pants. Everyone wore the same exact thing. One 18 year old kid used blueberries to die his shirt blue, but the next day I found him lying on his bed dead. He had blueberries and bits of his blue t-shirt in his mouth. No one tried to change up their clothes after him.*

*Matt- How many people died while you were there?*

*Me- I know of 9 people that were killed. 14 people left the house along with me, but I don’t know if the rest just went back to their house like me.* 

*Matt- Could you ever look outside of a window and see what was around you?*

*Me- I stared outside of the windows countless times. Sometimes I would see a person walking around the house carrying a gun, but other than the people all I could see was countless rows of trees. They stretched so far back and wide I could not see anything else.* 

*Matt- Did anyone ever come inside of the house?*

*Me- They would come inside to pick up the person that was ready to leave the house. Two people would come inside and grab the person that was leaving. They would have two pieces of rope and a black blind fold. They would tie his arms and legs together and put the blindfold over his eyes. After that they would carry the person into the wall of trees.*

*Matt- Did they ever show their face?*

*Me- No, never. They would wear monkey masks whenever they came in. None of us ever had the guts to take the masks off of any of the people.* 

*Matt- Thank you for taking the time to answer my questions. I’ll contact you back if we have any other questions or if we make any new developments. You’re a brave man. Please let us know if you find or remember anything new.* 

After Matt left I headed upstairs to my bedroom. I passed by my parent’s room and heard them quietly talking inside. I put my ear up to the door and heard my father talking to my mother. 

*” -argoret, don’t worry. This was part of the program. He will come back for 5 days to live with us. After that they get rid of him and make it look like a suicide. This is the only way they can make it as less suspicious as possible.”*

I rushed to my room and quietly closed my door. I thought about calling Matt, but I really want to figure this out.

I once lived in a home with my parents 300 miles south of the city of Berlin NY, Life was great i had a beautiful girlfriend, great friends, and was going into my final year of high school life could not be better. 

However, in the summer of 1998 everything changed, I was in the basement of my parents' home playing Resident Evil 2 on the PlayStation 1 when my mom yelled down "Alex can you come up here for a second" I paused my game and ran upstairs to see her sitting with my dad and my little sister Emily, "what's going on I asked confused" My mom looked at me with a very upset look on her face and said "Hunnie your grandfather past away this morning i am so sorry" I paused for a second and looked behind me as when she said this i felt someone touch my shoulder but nobody was there. She looked at me confused "Alex are you ok" I replied with a yes and she continued on to tell me that we were all going to take a trip to Berlin NY to help sell and clean up my grandfather's home before the end of the summer i groaned and went back downstair to continue playing and eventually falling asleep in front of the game.

A few days had past, and we were all packed and setting out for the 4-hour drive to NY. After what seemed like days versus hours, we finally made it to the once beautiful but yet all still quite countryside that was Berlin Ny. "Alex don't forget your suitcase this time" my mom shouted back in my direction as she was going up towards the house with a stern look on her face as I have done this so many times before when we go on vacation. I nodded and grabbed my suitcase from the trunk and turned to see a big but all too familiar white house with a 2-car garage and a large open amount of land. I took a second to myself before approaching the house as I once again felt the presence of someone or something else behind me, I turned to see an older woman standing at the bottom of the driveway pointing at me with a blank expression on her face. I turned toward the house to scream for my mom only to turn back and see that the old woman was gone. 

Later that night I had found myself going through the attic looking through old boxes and moving stuff around when I found an old chest with strange markings and a tag tied on to the lock that said Trio Moving and Storage. I looked at this tag for a solid 5 minutes before hearing my mom yell up "dinner everyone downstairs or you get left out" I put the boxes back in front of the chest and went downstairs to eat the pizza my mom had ordered. Somewhere during dinner I asked mom when Trio Moving and Storage was coming to get the old chest in the attic, she looked at me puzzled and replied, "Chest what chest I grew up here all my life grandpa never had a chest of any kind" Just as I was about to answer her question we heard a big loud smash that came from the attic we both looked at each other and ran upstairs to the hatch and opened it. One by one my mom me my dad and Emily went into the attic to only find the once closed chest I was talking about to now be wide open sitting in the middle of the floor. My dad and I got closer to the chest to look inside only to find that it was empty. 

After doing a little more looking around we determined it was the chest that fell and hit the floor we shrugged it off pickling it up and putting it back on the shelf where it once was and then we all went back downstairs to finish eating completely putting this incident behind us or so we thought. later that night while I was brushing my teeth, I was about to turn the water off when I heard something coming from the hallway outside the bathroom door it was footsteps. Thinking it was my little sister Emily trying to scare me I tip toed over to the door ripping it open yelling boo as I did but nobody was there it was just a dark empty hallway. A cold chill filled the hallway, and I shivered as I walked to check the thermostat at the end of the hall "Omg 30 degrees" no wonder I thought to myself. 

Sometime the next morning I was awoken to my mom screaming and my dad shaking me to get up there in the hallway was my little sister hanging in the bathroom doorway eyes cut out covered in blood. We all ran to the bottom of the stairs and took one look back up it was my little sister staring down at us on all fours retreating into the chest that now stood at the top of the stairs.

The police came and did their report and my sister's body was never recovered the house was later sold and it's been nearly 25 years and i have not been back to the town let alone the state of ny since. I recently heard the house burned down with a little girl inside but that was 2 years ago all i know is there's something my grandfather did not tell my mother as a child and as for the chest well it was never found either hope you all enjoyed hold your loved ones close because you never know when they may be gone for good.

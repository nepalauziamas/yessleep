Doctor Barry gained some traction sharing his experiences working in my prison, and while it’s technically against regulation to do the same, our organization is going to shit so I really don’t see why it matters that we keep our lips sealed anymore. I suppose it might be good to talk for a change. Get my thoughts out… Or at minimum, leave a record of how I ended up killed so that someone else… Probably Marsh or Hartman, can pick up the pieces. 

&#x200B;

My name is Elizabeth Parker. I was born in Toulouse in 1782. I had my throat bitten out by a vampire in Paris in roughly 1805 and despite the best efforts of a great number of people, I continue to live to this day. 

&#x200B;

I’ve lived a long, storied life and I really don’t think now is the time to get into it. Another time perhaps. But not now. Really, the only thing of import right now is that a number of years ago, (during the 1970s or early 80s, I believe, time blurs together at my age) a small little group who wanted to study the supernatural approached me to ask if I’d be interested in running one of their facilities.

&#x200B;

Now, I’m no scientist. When I came to the United States in the early 1800s, I initially made my money as a lady of the evening (to put it gently.) But, as time went on and I drifted further west from Louisiana, I eventually found there was more money and fresh blood to drink in bounties. One night, I’d had some clients who I’d recognized as members of some local gang… So I sank my fangs into their throats, drank my fill, and when they were dead I hauled their corpses down to the marshall's office to collect my reward. It was the most money I’d ever earned… And if I’m being honest, it felt good to put those bastards in their place.

&#x200B;

Over the years I graduated from letting my clients come to me, to hunting them down myself and once I took that step, I never looked back.

&#x200B;

Now, by the time the FRB came knocking at my door, I’d settled down into a cozy little job as a warden at a prison in Arizona. At the time, it was called Ashurst State Penitentiary although nowadays, the name’s been changed to something else. I won’t say what, but just know that most everyone in the know refers to it as Ashurst. 

&#x200B;

The FRB had a modest little proposal for me. They’d fund some ‘expansions’ to my prison and I just needed to keep an eye on some special inmates they needed locked away. I didn’t think on it too long before I told them I was interested.

&#x200B;

Over the decades, Ashurst has changed. There’s someone else upstairs in the Wardens office now. I left that position a number of years back to focus on the FRB’s activities downstairs. But make no mistake, the man in the office right now, works for me. The one thing that has remained constant ever since I came to Ashurst is that it belongs to me. 

&#x200B;

*It is mine*. My domain. My little circle of Hell, and let me make one thing painfully clear. I will not be made a fool of in my own goddamn prison! The FRB is free to do their research on the monsters they keep downstairs. But Ashurst is mine. It’s my home, my responsibility and I take pride in the fact that ever since I took charge, nobody who’s come in, has left without my say so. Well… Up until recently…

&#x200B;

Her name was Kayla Del Rio. She was a Siren with a southern drawl and a bit of an attitude. Really, at a glance she hardly seemed like the worst we’d dealt with. She played a little too fast and loose with the security, but I held off on putting a kill order out on her since she didn’t seem like that much of a threat. Guess I got too soft… I got complacent.

&#x200B;

The little bitch was smarter than I gave her credit… Somehow, she managed to get some of my people under her spell. She even got her claws into my second in command, Bob Hitch. Things started going wrong. We had a string of incidents. A vampire attack, an escaped demon… I ended up taking a hard look at our security and decided we needed to make some updates. Naturally, that involved moving some inmates off site while we did the renovations. Kayla ended up being one of those inmates. I’ll give you three guesses on what happened during transit.

&#x200B;

I lost far too many good people during her escape. Guards, Hitch, and another high value inmate, who got out as a result of her meddling. When I realized what was going on in transit, I’d tried to stop her. Hell, at one point I’d had my hands around that bitch’s throat… But in the end, it wasn’t enough.

&#x200B;

When the dust settled and the chaos was over. Kayla Del Rio was gone and my life got a whole hell of a lot harder.

&#x200B;

The FRB’s current Director, Amanda Spencer ain’t exactly the calm and reasonable type. Truthfully, if she’d been running the operation back when they first approached me, I’d never have joined up. Spencer has cold, blue snakelike eyes and time’s withered her down to a venomous shrew of a woman. I don’t enjoy our conversations… But in the wake of the escape, we ended up having a lot of them in my office.

&#x200B;

Well… I say conversations. Most of them devolved into heated, vulgar screaming matches. I damn near decked the woman at one point when she suggested I turn the entire prison over to her. In the end though, I managed to mostly smooth things over… Mostly. Our reputation was still tarnished. Our inmates were rowdier than ever, having smelled the blood in the water and while I’d managed to keep things with Spencer from getting any worse, that didn’t change the fact that I was on much thinner ice than I’d like to be. 

&#x200B;

I got her to agree to some further renovations to the underground part of the prison, adding temporary holding cells to deny anyone else another window to escape in transit like Kayla did.   
Director Spencer also suggested blinding our remaining siren inmates to prevent them from using their natural ability to hypnotize. I argued against that one, since it seemed a little too brutal. I even took it to the board of Directors who agreed to shut it down. It wasn’t much of a victory. Spencer responded to her loss by putting a kill order on most of the sirens in our population. I had less luck fighting that one. 

&#x200B;

There were a lot of executions while Spencer was poking around my prison. More than I’m comfortable with and when she finally left me alone, Ashurst felt a hell of a lot emptier than it ever had before. With Spencers departure came a small caveat though. I was told I needed to beef up my security. She’d told me I needed at least fifty more bodies and gave me a few weeks to get them.

&#x200B;

Something told me that this ‘caveat’ was just part of some bullshit scheme of hers. Spencer of all people should’ve known there wasn’t a snowballs chance in hell I was going to be able to hire fifty competent new guards within the span of a few weeks. There’s not a lot of folks qualified to guard a prison for monsters. But I’d be damned if I was going to give her another reason to come after me. Like I said before, nobody makes a fool of me in my own prison. 

*Nobody.*

&#x200B;

I put out a call to hire on some more guards long term, but in the meantime, while I waited for applicants to trickle in I looked for a temporary solution. I found it in the form of Jared Moir. 

&#x200B;

I’d had some dealings with Moir before. He was a werewolf, like a lot of guards I tended to hire who’d spent the bulk of his life either in the army, or working for various PMCs before he’d eventually gone into private security. He wasn’t exactly my favorite person to work with and to be perfectly honest, he probably belonged in Ashurst as an inmate. But he was reliable enough. 

&#x200B;

Moir and his team had made a reputation for themselves over the past fifteen to twenty-ish years guarding less than reputable people, and carrying out the odd mercenary job. I’d hired him myself a number of years back to bring me an old enemy of mine, who’d popped back up on my radar. A vampire named Malaki. 

&#x200B;

Moir had tracked him for me and brought him in alive. He’d carried out the job well enough. So I didn’t have that many misgivings about hiring him again. Through Moir, I was able to get in touch with a few other mercenary types. Hiring them wasn’t cheap. But it kept Spencer off my back.

&#x200B;

I was feeling kinda proud of myself over my little solution and thought I was oh so clever for beating Spencer at her stupid little game that I didn’t realize I’d just played right into someone elses hand. 

&#x200B;

The day it all went to shit had run pretty well, up until the end. The last major item on my agenda that evening was to oversee a meeting between the various department heads. As a courtesy, I’d allowed Moir and the head of the other two mercenary groups I’d hired on a temporary basis to sit in. As they weren’t part of our standard security team, I thought it only fair their leaders be involved. 

&#x200B;

The meeting was hardly interesting. Most of it was focused on some recent strides by the research department, as well as a few minor concerns regarding some of our more volatile inmates raised by our chief of security. When it finally ended, I was ready to call it a night, take the elevator topside and spend the evening at a bar a bit down the street. 

&#x200B;

As I’d packed up the notes I’d taken and prepared to head back to my office to finish a few things up for the evening, I noticed Moir was lingering in the room with me, leaning against the table a few feet away. 

  “Can I help you with something, Jared?” I asked, watching him out of the corner of my eye.

&#x200B;

  “Officially? Nope. Unofficially, I wanted to know if you wanted to grab a drink. Some of the boys and I are heading out to that bar down the street tonight. I figured it might be nice for them to get to know who they’re working for.”

&#x200B;

He flashed a sheepish smile, and I just narrowed my eyes at him. There went my evening plans.

&#x200B;

This wasn’t the first time he’d suggested I grab a drink with his little group. It wasn’t the first time I’d refused either.

  “I don’t see why that’s necessary.” I said, “I don’t typically go bar hopping with my employees and I don’t see much of a reason to start now.”

&#x200B;

  “Come on, Liz. It’s more like catching up with an old friend. Unlike you, I’m not going to live forever.” Moir said, “Besides, my boys are used to knowing who they’re working for. We usually have a bit of a closer relationship with the client. When you’re in private security, it comes with the territory.”

  “My answer is still no. Besides, I have other plans tonight.” I said, making up a lie on the spot. “I’ve still got some things to take care of so I’ll be working late.”

&#x200B;

Moir frowned but finally just shrugged his shoulders.

  “Suit yourself, then. But you’re missing out.”

I doubted that.

&#x200B;

I left Moir in the room as I headed back to my office. Since stopping by the bar was no longer an option, I might as well not make myself a liar and stay a little later. I had a few things that could keep me busy, and a bottle of whisky to keep me company. The administrative wing was mostly empty at that time of evening. Most of the office staff had gone home for the evening. The only other people I saw were a couple of stragglers and a couple night shift guards. None of them bothered me as I headed through the double doors of my office and closed them behind me.

&#x200B;

Once I was well enough alone, I went for the cabinet on the far side of the room. I keep a modestly stocked bar there. Nothing fancy. I ain’t one for drinking on the job, but every now it’s necessary to have something on hand. I poured myself a glass of neat whisky and took it back to my desk before bringing up my laptop to try and get some work done.

&#x200B;

I made it about fifteen minutes before someone was at my door. They knocked twice before letting themselves in, and I glanced up at them, initially about to warn them that whatever this was, it had best be important.

&#x200B;

When I saw that it was Dr. Stephen Barry though, I was inclined to be a little kinder. Dr. Barry is a decent enough sort. He joined our research team about a year back and while I’m told he’s a capable enough member of the team, what sets him apart in my opinion is the sheer idiotic grit he tends to display. I admire that kind of stubbornness in a person. 

&#x200B;

  “Hey Warden.” He said, putting on a smile. “Thought I’d pop in and drop off my days reports in person. See how you’re doing.”

  “I could be much worse.” I replied. Dr. Barry had been a little friendlier with me than usual ever since what had happened with Kayla… Considering how he’d been under her spell at the time and how she’d used him to try and set another inmate free, I don’t reckon I could blame him. But Dr. Barry was also more than likely the reason Kayla hadn’t done even more damage than she had. If anything, he was just about the one man left on the research team that I genuinely liked. 

&#x200B;

  “Go get yourself a drink. Sit down.” I said, already knowing damn well that he wasn’t just here to drop off reports. Honestly, I didn’t much care. If he wanted to chit chat, I could oblige. He didn’t take me up on the offer of a drink and just sat right down, setting a folder on my desk. I just pushed it aside. It could be reviewed later.

&#x200B;

  “Long day?” He asked, glancing at my half empty glass.

  “Long year.” I replied, “Live as long as I have, and the days go by in the blink of an eye. But lately every minute drags its feet…”

  “Yeah… Yeah, I get that.” He said with a sigh, “Is the Director still on your ass?”

  “Not currently, no. But I give her a month until she’s back at it again.” I said, “Call it a hunch but I’m willing to bet she won’t be too happy with me hiring mercs to bolster our security team. That woman’s building a case on me. But I ain’t going to make it easy on her.”

&#x200B;

  “Anything I can do to help?”

I laughed.

  “I don’t suppose you could bring Bob Hitch back from the dead?”

  “Sorry.” He said with a melancholy smile.

&#x200B;

  “It’s fine. I suppose I should find someone to replace him… He was for all intents and purposes the acting deputy warden. He wanted to stay the head of research, but the job was basically his. Now that he’s gone, I’m running the show by myself. My money says that Director Spencer’ll be on my ass about that next… Hitch wasn’t an easy man to replace, though. If Spencer gets her way, I’ll need someone to replace me and I’d rather be able to choose my own replacement rather than see who she picks. If she got her way, she’d just stuff the role with some dickless bureaucrat and call it a day.”

  “You think Spencer would honor your choice in deputy though?” Dr. Barry asked. I paused at that, then took a sip of my drink.

&#x200B;

  “Honestly… I’ve got no idea.” I admitted, “That’s part of why I haven’t picked anyone yet. I’m not so sure that it’ll matter.”

I sighed and sat back in my chair.

&#x200B;

  “Course, it could all go the other way too. Wouldn’t be the first time I’ve got myself all worked up over nothing… Force of habit, I suppose. Back when I was chasing bounties, when your gut told you something was off, it was usually right. Nowadays though, nothing ever feels right. Maybe it’s nothing, maybe everything's going to shit. I don’t know… Christ, sometimes I regret settling down here.”

  “You used to chase bounties?” Dr. Barry asked.

&#x200B;

  “Damn right. Back during the late 1800s, I was making good money. Nobody ever figured that the harmless woman they’d just robbed was a bounty hunter, and they sure as hell didn’t expect me to be a vampire. It caught them off guard. Now, I’d change up my identity every few decades… I even spent a few years every now and then posing as a young man. Cut my hair short and everything. Shit, I could sit here all night telling you all my old stories and still have countless more for later.”

I chuckled.

&#x200B;

  “You almost sound like you miss it.” Barry said.

  “I almost do.” I admitted, “Between you and me, with all this shit with Director Spencer, I’ve had half a mind to tell her to just do whatever she wants with Ashurst, put my guns back on and go out there to hunt that bitch Kayla down… But I know that I’d regret it. Not a lot left in the world for an old cowboy to do nowadays. I’ve had my adventures, and as appealing as one last ride sounds, I’m not convinced I’d be as happy as I think I’d be. What do I do next? Settle down again? Go back to what I was already doing? Try and get things as good as I’ve got them now? No… I’m content, here.”

&#x200B;

I polished off my whisky and got up for a refill.

  “Well look at that, you’ve gotten me all nostalgic.” I said with a smile, “You sure you don’t want a drink?”

  “You know what? Sure. Pour me a glass.”

  “Atta boy.” 

&#x200B;

I took out a second glass for Dr. Barry and filled it. As I did, I heard another knock at my door.

  “It’s unlocked. Come in.” I called.

The door opened and from the corner of my eye, I watched one of Moirs boys stroll in. A tanned man in his mid thirties with a forgettable face and a cowlick. His name tag read: *Bailey* and I could smell the werewolf on him, just like the rest of Moirs boys.

&#x200B;

  “Evening, Warden.” He said.

  “Evening. You need me for something?”

Bailey smiled.

  “Just dropping off a message from Jared.” He said, “He said to let you know what you missed out on tonight.”

I scoffed.

  “This ought to be good…”

  “Trust me. It will be…”

&#x200B;

I could see him approaching out of the corner of my eye, and as he drew nearer, I saw his right hand beginning to warp and change. The fingers grew clawed and became more bestial. Coarse black fur grew to cover his arm. 

&#x200B;

In the moment before he swung at me, I realized what was going on. I ducked low as his claws ripped through my liquor cabinet, tearing through the space where my head had been just a few moments before. I dove out of the way, swearing as Bailey fixed me in an intense glare, his eyes already taking on a yellowish tint as he changed.

&#x200B;

  “Would’ve been a lot easier to do this outside…” He said, his voice already becoming a guttural, animalistic growl. *“But you had to make this difficult…”*

I glanced over at Barry, who looked at the werewolf with a mix of bafflement and horror. I didn’t need to tell him to run. He got the idea. He dove behind my desk for cover, while Bailey charged right for me, still mid transformation.

&#x200B;

I grabbed one of my office chairs and held it between us. It didn’t do a whole lot of good. Bailey just crushed and warped the metal as if it were rubber.

  “Barry! Top desk drawer!” I called as I pushed the chair against Bailey, sending him back a step. He hurled it aside before bringing one claw down towards me. I just barely avoided it, and it left a dent in the wood of my desk. I couldn’t avoid his second swing, which launched me across the room.

&#x200B;

Now, nearly a full werewolf, Bailey charged again. When he was nearly on top of me, I kicked out at him, catching him in the jaw with my boot. It only barely slowed him down as he came for me again, jaws opening wide to bite down on my head. Then I heard it. The deafening pop of three gunshots.

&#x200B;

Bailey jerked violently, letting out an animalistic snarl as he looked over to see Dr. Barry standing behind my desk, my Colt 1911 in hand. Of the three shots, only one of them had hit and all it had seemed to do was just piss Bailey off.

&#x200B;

Dr. Barry fired two more times, and Bailey tore across the room to avoid the gunfire. One of those shots caught him in the shoulder. The werewolf leaped up, sinking his claws into my ceiling and managing to hold himself there for a moment before launching himself towards Dr. Barry.

&#x200B;

He had the good sense to get under the desk again, although that probably wasn’t the wisest move. Baileys weight came down upon my (very fucking nice) desk and cracked the wood, causing it to buckle. I suppose that Dr. Barry was lucky it didn’t collapse and crush him outright. Snarling, Bailey sank his claws into the surface of my desk and tore a jagged chunk of the broken wood off, exposing Dr. Barry underneath.

&#x200B;

I saw the flash of several gunshots as he tried to shoot at him, but none of the bullets hit. Dr. Barry was hardly a marksman and Bailey wasn’t stupid enough to stick his head out when someone had a gun. He reached one clawed hand down to grab at Dr. Barry, who scrambled out from under the desk, leaving himself out in the open.

&#x200B;

He got off two more shots, both which hit Bailey in the torso before the gun clicked uselessly. He’d wasted his ammo.

&#x200B;

As Bailey loomed towards him, I came up behind him. I grabbed the broken wood he’d torn off my desk and drove the splintered end deep into his ribs. He let out a scream of pain, in the moment before I violently jerked the wood to the side, using it as a lever to force Bailey to the ground. The werewolf kicked and squirmed as I drove the makeshift stake deeper into his guts. Blood gushed out of his mouth as his eyes watched me frantically. With a final violent push, I forced the wood deeper into his ribs. His pupils dilated. He let out a final, shuddering gasp before his struggles stopped. 

&#x200B;

Dr. Barry stared at me from behind the ruins of my desk, eyes wide as he struggled to breathe. He held my gun uselessly in his hands and as I stepped away from the body of the dead werewolf, I helped him up and took it from him.

  “Jesus Christ…” He said under his breath, “What the *fuck*… What the fuck was that about?!”

&#x200B;

  “I’ve got no fucking idea…” I panted, before opening the (surprisingly still functional) drawer to my desk to grab a second clip for my Colt.

  “He… He said he had a message from Moir… That new guy on the security team, right? I thought you two were friends!”

  “Not exactly. Moir’s a mercenary.” I said, “And I’m starting to suspect he’s not actually working for me, right now.”

&#x200B;

I looked back at Barry.

  “When you came in here… Who else was still in the offices?”

  “Nobody!” He said, “Some security, I think. The other offices looked empty though!”

  “Security. Moirs boys?”

  “I… I think so…?”

  “Fuck me… Soon as they realize their friend isn’t coming back, they’re going to come looking for him. And us. Come on. Help me barricade the door!”

&#x200B;

The good thing about Dr. Barry is that he doesn’t need to be told twice. Despite clearly shaking like a goddamn leaf, the man got up and helped me push what was left of my bar in front of the door. Once that was done, I rummaged through my pocket for my keys.

&#x200B;

On the far side of my office was a large painting that I tore off the wall. Behind it was a safe, and a small keyhole.

  “What the hell is that?” Barry asked.

  “A saferoom. In case of an emergency. I’d say this qualifies.” I replied. I put one of my keys in, and watched a panel in the wall pop out. I pulled it open and ushed Dr. Barry inside before following him, and closing it behind us. Not a moment too soon either. I could hear footsteps outside.

&#x200B;

  “If Moir’s not working for you, who the hell is he working for, then?” Dr. Barry asked as we headed down the short hall to the saferoom.

  “Director Spencer, most likely…” I said, “Can’t say I thought she ever had it in her. This is ballsy.”

  “You seriously think that she’d put out a fucking hit on you?” Dr. Barry asked and I paused.

No… No I didn’t. But who else hated me enough to hire someone to kill me?

&#x200B;

There was a console and a desk against one wall of the saferoom that let me tap into the camera feed from the Administration wing. Sure enough, it was empty save for three men outside my office door, trying to kick it in. I recognized all three as Moirs boys. 

&#x200B;

The one who seemed to be in charge was a middle aged bastard with a baby face that had an unusually defined jawline and graying scruff. Matthew Kean. I’d seen him alongside Moir before and had pegged him as his lieutenant. The second was a scrawny young man whos name I recalled being Jeremy Martin, or something like that. The last was a stocky gremlin of a man who went by Grant Jacobs. I knew he wasn’t quite as high up the ladder as Kean was, but he didn’t exactly look like a slouch either. I didn’t see any sign of Moir himself. That chickenshit bastard had probably fucked off to the bar just like he’d said he would. If this went wrong, it was easier to escape if he was already topside. 

&#x200B;

Martin and Kean had damn near torn my doors off their hinges and kicked through the splintered wood to step into my office. I switched the camera feed to inside the office itself to keep an eye on them. They were already looking at the keyhole to the saferoom.

  *“She’s in hiding. Somewhere nearby.”* I heard Kean saying.

  *“Very close… I can smell her. And some other fresh meat.”* Jacobs added.

&#x200B;

  “Can they get in here?” Dr. Barry asked.

  “Supposedly, no.” I replied, “But I can’t say I like the sound of ‘*supposedly*’.” I said. 

I headed over to a cabinet on the opposite wall and opened it.

  “You’ve got a plan?” Barry asked hopefully.

  “I had this place built in case of an emergency. But I didn’t build it to hide out.” I said, opening the cabinet. I didn’t exactly have a full armory in there, just a shotgun, two rifles and a revolver, but more than enough for my own purposes.

I picked the Marlin 1895 and loaded it with hollow point rounds. 

&#x200B;

  “There’s a few other rooms down the hall for the rest of the office staff, although I set this one up to function independently in case of an emergency. I can cut through those saferooms to flank them.”

  “Great. How can I help?” Barry asked.

I looked over at him, then passed him the .45 from my cabinet, along with an earpiece.

&#x200B;

  “I could use you at the computer. You can be my eyes.” 

  “Got it.”

  “If they try to get through the door, you can follow me out through the other saferooms. Otherwise, you should be safe in here once they realize I’m in the offices.” I said. 

  “Sounds good. You gonna be okay out there?” Dr. Barry asked.

  “I’ve killed worse than a couple of werewolves.” I promised him, before clapping him on the shoulder and heading back down the hall.

&#x200B;

  *“Testing, testing. Can you hear me, Warden?”* Dr. Barry asked through the earpiece.

  “Loud and clear, Doc.” I replied.

The office saferooms were larger and led into an office space just down the hall from my office. 

 “Where’s the wolves?” I asked.

 *“Kean and Jacobs are still in your office. Martin’s in the next hall over. Heads up, he’s already transformed.”*

 “Then we’ll start with him.”

&#x200B;

I opened the door to the saferoom stepped out of the offices. I made a point to close it behind me as I crept into the hall, my rifle at the ready. I could hear the distant sound of nails clicking on the linoleum floor. My footsteps echoed off the walls. Martin was close by… And I knew that he could smell me.

&#x200B;

All I needed to do was wait. 

&#x200B;

The sound of clicking nails were getting closer, and to claim that my heart wasn’t racing anxiously would be a lie. I had no delusions of grandeur here. Either I was going to kill him, or I wasn’t. Simple as that. Down the hall, I could see the dark shape of a wolf rounding the corner.

&#x200B;

Jeremy Martin fixed me in his hungry green eyes and bared his teeth, growling at me. I just took aim at him. Martin took off towards me at a sprint.

&#x200B;

I fired my first shot and it struck him in the shoulder, but barely slowed him down. My second shot grazed the side of his head and made him rethink his choices though. He veered suddenly to the side and torpedoed through the nearby drywall, into one of the adjacent offices.

&#x200B;

I could hear him tearing through them and knew he was going to burst back into the hall. I took off towards the hole he’d made in the wall and turned around just in time for him to break back through a few feet from where I’d been.

&#x200B;

Martin howled in rage as he tried to close the distance between us, and I put three bullets into his head. His legs buckled underneath him as his momentum kept carrying him forward. He rolled to the ground, leaving a smear of blood and brain matter in his wake as he tumbled to a stop a few feet away from me.

&#x200B;

Two to go.

&#x200B;

  *“Kean and Jacobs are out of the office.”* Dr. Barry said as I reloaded my rifle. I took off at a run down the hall, already hearing them coming for me.

  “Trip the fire alarm.” I said, “And turn on sprinkler system in the halls. It should throw them off.”

&#x200B;

On cue, I heard the fire alarm start ringing. A moment later, the sprinklers went active, spraying water down upon the halls. I could hear a distant snarl of rage, as the sound and the water caught the last two werewolves off guard, and I took cover in an office as I waited for my chance to move.

&#x200B;

  *“They’ve found the body.”* Dr. Barry said, *“They’re not happy. Jacobs is already changing.”*

Then a moment later.

  *“They’re on the move again, heading in your direction.”*

&#x200B;

I took a deep breath and forced my heart to beat a little slower. I listened to the sound of the alarm, and the sound of the water hitting the floor… Behind it, I could hear footsteps drawing nearer. 

&#x200B;

Through the window of the office, I could see Kean and Jacobs passing by, drenched by the water. Kean stormed ahead, watching every corner. He didn’t see me… Yet. 

  “We’ll check the offices.” I heard him say, “Jacobs, go left. I’ll take right.”

&#x200B;

Jacobs huffed and stormed into the set of offices I was hiding in. I moved behind a desk, still clutching my rifle and listening to his footsteps as they drew nearer. I could hear him sniffing the air, and heard him let out an animalistic growl as he started to change.

*“She’s here…”*

&#x200B;

Just a little closer…

&#x200B;

Jacobs kept walking and I took aim with my rifle. As he stepped past the desk I was behind, I saw his eyes dart toward me. His face was in a twisted state between man and wolf. His jaw was starting to elongate. His claws flexed in anticipation of the kill. 

&#x200B;

But he’d just walked into my sights, not the other way around.

&#x200B;

He opened his mouth either to scream or to snarl, and I fired two rounds into his head as his muscles tensed to lunge for me. His skull burst like a melon, decorating the ceiling and the desks behind him with gore. His body unceremoniously hit the ground, twitching as it did.

&#x200B;

One left. And I could already hear him coming.

&#x200B;

I rose to my feet to meet Matthew Kean head on. I’d expected him to be fully transformed, but he was smarter than that. Going full Wolf would’ve given me a bigger target. He still looked mostly human. Mostly.

&#x200B;

His hands were twisted into claws. His mouth was filled with fangs and his eyes glowed a burning yellow as he tore through the hallway on all fours, moving faster than I’d ever seen a Wolf move. He slid behind the desks for cover as I fired my first shot and missed. I knew he was trying to flank me, I wasn’t going to let him.

&#x200B;

I took off back towards the hall, watching from the corner of my eye as Kean climbed atop a cubicle and flew towards me. I had time to squeeze off one more shot that managed to hit the wall before he hit me. 

The two of us tumbled out into the hall again. My rifle slid out of my hands.

&#x200B;

 *“Parker!”* I heard Barry call out, but my attention was fixated on Kean. He snarled, baring his teeth at me as he swung a claw at my face. I only barely managed to avoid getting my head taken off, but felt his claws ripping into my arm. I tried to stumble back, only to slip on the wet linoleum and leave myself open. Kean took full advantage of it, grabbing me by the leg to pull me towards him.

&#x200B;

With my free leg, I kicked him in the jaw and pulled myself free, scrambling to my feet again. Kean just grinned at me as he rose up.

&#x200B;

  “Moir couldn’t be a fucking man and do this himself, huh?” I asked, panting, “He had to send you to do his work for him.”

Kean just chuckled. It was a low, gravely sound that sent a chill through me. 

 *“Well, you’ve gone and made this all so much harder than it needs to be.”* He said, *“Would’ve been simple. Have a few drinks with the boys, and we could take you out at our leisure… Then you would’ve at least died drunk and happy.”*

&#x200B;

  “Was that was Director Spencer asked for?” I asked.

  *“Spencer?”* Keans brow furrowed for a moment, before his smile returned. He laughed and I took a step back toward my rifle.

  *“You think your own organization wants you dead?”*

  “If I’m wrong, then humor me. Who’s really signing your paycheques? Indulge me.”

  *“Some siren. What’s it matter to you?”*

&#x200B;

A siren? Kayla… Of course.

&#x200B;

  “Just wanted to know who I had to hunt down once I was done with you.” I said. 

Kean huffed, before coming for me again. I dove toward my rifle, only for him to crash into me and hurl me further down the hall.

&#x200B;

Kean kicked the rifle away before charging for me on all fours. I tried to get up only for him to grab me and slam me against the wall. One clawed hand closed around my throat, keeping me in place.

  *“Sorry Warden.”* He hissed as he pulled his other hand back to drive his claws into my throat.*“But you’re not killing me today.”*

&#x200B;

I tried to pull myself out of his grip but he was a hell of a lot stronger than I was. For a moment… I was sure there was nothing that I could do. Then from the corner of my eye I saw a figure standing in the hall, a .45 revolver clutched in both of his hands.

&#x200B;

I heard a gunshot and listened as Kean let out a wail of pain. He pulled back, holding at the bloody mess that now sat where his hand had been just a moment before. What was left of it dangled from a few strips of skin, and I could see the bone jutting out of the wound. Kean looked up at Dr. Barry, eyes narrowing in rage. He let out a defiant roar before Dr. Barry fired again, and again. Keans body jerked violently as the bullets tore into his chest. 

&#x200B;

For a moment, he stood, sucking in shaky, rasping breaths as he glared at Barry. Then at last, he sank to his knees, and collapsed to the ground.

&#x200B;

For a moment, all was silent. I looked down at Keans body, then back at Dr. Barry.

  “Damn good shooting…” I rasped.

  “I was aiming for his head…” He replied. 

  “Good enough.”

I stepped over Keans body and grabbed my rifle off the ground. 

  “Now… About that drink…”

&#x200B;

Jared Moir and the rest of his group were long gone by the time we got anyone in to clean up the mess his boys had left behind and nothing we had gave us any clue as to where they might have run off to.

&#x200B;

Something told me that Moir had known there was a good possibility that this little operation of his would go badly… I suppose I couldn’t blame him for skipping town. But as I’ve said a few times now: Nobody makes a fool of me in my own prison.

*Nobody.*

&#x200B;

And yet Kayla Del Rio’s done it twice now… Once when she escaped, and now twice with this Moir incident. I ain’t going to wait for her to do it a third time. 

&#x200B;

I’ve requested a leave of absence. Ashurst is still mine, but I’ve got business to take care of. I’ll deal with Moir first, then I’ll deal with Del Rio. In the meanwhile, I’ve appointed a new Deputy Warden to oversee things in my absence. 

&#x200B;

I’d admittedly already been considering Dr. Barry as Bob’s replacement for some time. The only thing that kept me from moving forward with him was his lack of experience. To be perfectly honest, I’m still not entirely convinced he’s ready for the position. But he still has that grit I like so much… And he’s been here through what’s been the roughest chapter of Ashursts history. Something tells me that he can manage the day to day operations until I come back. And when I come back… If I come back, then I’ll get around to training him properly.

&#x200B;

If it ever comes to it, he’ll make a damn fine replacement one [day](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/wrsb18/im_the_warden_of_a_prison_for_monsters_and_ive/).

I didn't think monsters were real. Until now, that is. It's kind of hard to deny their existence, after you've survived an attack by werewolves.

How I got myself into such situation? I decided to go on a cruse. 

I was expecting to meet some strange people, but nothing like this. Long story short, a pack of werewolves was among the passengers, and they decided the rest of us look pretty tasty, so they started eating the other passengers

While in human form, they had convinced some passengers to play some game with them, don't know what. Apparently they were pretty good, and a largish crowd gathered to watch them play. I happened to be a certain distance from the crowd. 

I was sunbathing, and I happened to doze off when I was suddenly awoken by screams and shrieks. At first, I was annoyed. I thought,"what could possibly be so exciting?" Then I saw the crowd dispersing and getting attacked. It took a while until it registered, what was happening.  Finally, I just found myself running in the same direction as everybody else without understanding why. Instinct of self-preservation, I guess.

As I was running, I turned and looked back for a moment, and I saw one of the werewolves pouncing on some poor kid. I was horrified, but I couldn't stop. I had to pick up speed. Problem was, there were a lot of panicked people around, running frenetically in all directions. I managed together with some of the other passengers to enter the dining hall and block the door as well as we could. 

Now, the interesting part was, these weren't your Hollywood type werewolves. They weren't active only at night, but, as I already mentioned, also by day. In fact, I suspect, they could change at will. But I wasn't able to confirm or disprove this idea of mine, as once they turned into wolf form, they didn't chance back. They look a bit like Hollywood werewolves, though. They were anthropomorphic looking wolves. Actually, they looked like a skinny bear standing on two legs.

We were able to hear howling and scratching from behind the door. Luckily, our make-shift barricade held, at least for. Now that I had time to evaluate my situation, I panicked even more. I started to hyperventilate. I was seriously considering the possibility that I was not going to make it. Not only that, but I thought of my parents and how devastated they would be. I even imagined my mum wailing and mourning me. As I was their only child, they would never have any grandchildren. They wouldn't have anything to remember me by, just a few clothes and a few empty bottles of gin I had forgotten to throw away. Not only that, but since I'd gotten myself eaten by monsters, they wouldn't even have a body to bury. 

I looked around me and everybody was just as terrified and worried as me. Until I noticed Karl in the corner sipping a damn cup of tea as calmly as possible. He didn't even seam to notice the surrounding commotion.

Karl was also one of the passengers. He was a tall, elderly gentleman. He looked in excellent health, in fact you could even describe him as ripped. Karl wasn't popular with the other passengers, I think I was the only one who bothered to talk to him, or he bothered to talk to. If the guy didn't like you, he would flat out ignore you. He spent all his time alone, sitting somewhere in his the-piece-suite and stroking his long, white beard or playing with his pony-tail and observing the other passengers. Karl was from somewhere in Eastern Europe. He wasn't married and didn't have any children. What he did for a living, he refused to tell me, but he was a very educated man. He was very knowledgeable in matters of science, history and philosophy.

When he saw me, he gestured me to go to him. I did

"What's going on?"

"Werewolves, man, werewolves. I know it sounds crazy, but …"

"Werewolves, hmm," he interrupted as if it was the most mundane thing ever. "You really should try the tea. It helps calm the nerves."

"How can you talk of tea at a time like this?!"

"Well, they also have liquor, if you prefer that."

"No, I would rather …"

I was interrupted by the sound of the door breaking down.  The beasts burst in but stopped when they noticed Karl and me. Karl didn't even flinch, but the werewolves were positively terrified of him. If you ever had a dog, you are familiar with the body language. Tail tucked between the legs, head down, trying to look as small as possible, whining. 

"You know, I really don't appreciate it, when your kind bothers me on vacation," said Karl annoyed.

The werewolves didn't wait for him to say another word and ran away. Karl stood up and walked away in his usual, calm manner. The monsters were found later in their human form, with their stomachs burst from the inside. There was no sign of Karl. To this very day, I have no idea what happened. 

When the authorities arrived, they concluded the drinks must have been spiked, the passengers suffered from mass delusions and started attacking each other. I don't blame them. The rational person tries to explain the unexplainable. Or story seamed crazy, so of course it MUST be wrong, mustn't it? No arrests were made. Of course there weren't. The real culprits were among the dead bodies, under mysterious circumstances.

I hadn't seen my friend Joseph in over 4 years. The last time I saw him was in 2018, when I was dropping him off at Chicago O'Hare International Airport. He was taking an airplane straight to Japan. After years of trying Joseph had finally managed to get a work visa, and would be teaching English in Tokyo. Going to Japan had always been Joseph's life long dream. When I saw him walking toward the airport, he was bouncing on his feet. He was so happy he almost looked like was floating. Floating like a cartoon character who had just smelled a delicious pie sitting on an open window sill, and was now hovering towards it. Before walking through the sliding doors Joseph turned towards me and gave me a wave. Bright wet tears glinted around the edges of his eyes. But they were tears of pure joy. He looked like a man who was finally about to start the rest of his life. 

I waved back at my friend and watched him walk away. 

The man who returned  4 years later resembled a tattered scarecrow more than he resembled my friend.

\------

It was Joseph who really introduced me to fighting games. This was back in 2003, when Joseph and I were 12 years old. At the time I was only really aware of a few fighting games. Mortal Kombat, which I had only played briefly when I was very young, but I loved the movie. And the Nintendo games Super Smash Bros and Super Smash Bros Melee; which I had dabbled in.

"Smash isn't really a fighting game," Joseph said to me one day. "Although Melee isn't bad."

Joseph introduced me to fighting game like Tekken, Street Fighter, Marvel vs Capcom, The King of Fighters, Dead or Alive, Virtua Fighter etc...Even at such a young age Joseph was already a connoisseur of fighting games, and talked about them the way a pretentious film student might talk about french films. When he found a fighting game he really liked, he obsessed over it, made it apart of his personality. Joseph adored fighting games. Knew them front to back. He didn't even play them with a controller. He played them with a fight stick, which was essentially a portable arcade set up. I had tried it once, but it hurt my fingers using it. But Joseph played that fight stick like a maestro pianist playing some grand concert. Sometimes I would just listen as he played. Listen to the soft clackity-clack of the buttons. It really was like music. 

It was Joseph who taught me that fighting games weren't just games where you mindlessly mashed buttons on your controller until either you or your opponent's health was depleted. No, Joseph showed me that fighting games were more sophisticated than that. 

"Fighting games are like chess," Joseph told me one day after trouncing me in Tekken 4. "It's all about anticipating your opponent's next three moves. Conditioning them to think you're gonna do one thing, and then you do the other. It's about patience and timing. Don't just attack. Don't just think about what *you're* doing. Think about what *I'm* doing."

"I want to do sick combos like you, Jo," I had said. "When are you going to teach me that?"

"Combos are like the icing on a cake, dude," Joseph said slapping me on the back. "But you have to learn how to bake the cake first."

\--------

I never became quite as passionate about fighting games as Joseph. Maybe I would have, if not for the bowling alley incident. A couple years later when Joseph and I were entering high school, we finally decided to go to a local fighting game tournament. It was the first time either of us had ever gone to a "local". I was shocked when Joseph said that he had never been to one before, but he simply shrugged. 

"First time for everything, dude."

At the time Joseph was going out with a girl named Kathy, and she accompanied us to the local. Kathy didn't care much for fighting games at all, but she wanted to go to support Joseph. 

The tournament was taking place in a room that was in the back of a bowling alley. As we walked into the room, I immediately felt something was wrong. I had a feeling that one might have when walking straight into a lion's den, with freshly cut meat hanging around their neck. 

Joseph's and I both signed up for the Street Fighter pool. Joseph's first opponent was a man much older than us. He had terrible hygiene and wore a stained gray tank top and cammo cargo shorts. He had a greasy looking face and he smelled horrible too. But it was the look on his face that shocked me. He looked relentlessly angry, for no reason at all. And more than once I saw him leer at Kathy with those angry pinched eyes of his. Kathy was the only girl there.

The man called himself Clyde, although he spelled the 'e' with a '3' so it looked like "Clyd3". 

"This should be easy," Clyde said. "Love breaking in the newbies. Fuckin' piece of cake."

But Clyde never got a chance to do any breaking in, because Joseph completely trounced him. A clean 2-0 sweep. It had never been close either. Joseph handled him like a pro baseball player taking pitches from a little leaguer. Clyde never stood a chance. There was a look of utter shock on everyone's faces, as apparently Clyde had been one of the better players in the pool. The favorite to win the whole thing actually. And now he was going to the loser's bracket. 

"Good game," Joseph said to Clyde, reaching his hand out. I grimaced, thinking how horrible it must feel to shake Clyde's greasy hand.

"Whatever," Clyde said turning away from Joseph's outstretched hand like it was diseased. He got up and threw his controller on the ground. "Fuckin beginner's luck, asshole. I fucking hate this game. I hate the way you play." 

"That was amazing," Kathy said, wrapping her arms around Joseph. "You were so good."

"Fuck you, cunt," Clyde said. And his words cut through the air. There was a moment of shocked silence. I had expected the other older players in the room to stand up and say something, but most just looked down or away. Others even snickered and muttered under their breaths. Some were saying obscene things about Kathy. 

"What did you say?" Joseph said. And for the first time in my life I saw pure rage on his face. Rage like I never seen before.

"Jo, just leave it," Kathy said. 

"Yeah, just leave it Jo Jo," Clyde said and a ghoulish grin crossed his face. He made an obscene jerk off motion with his hand. "Listen to your cunty girl-"

Joseph's fist shot out and connected with Clyde's dumb face. Clyde was older than us, but Joseph was tall for his age. Clyde stumbled back and for a moment that angry greasy face of his was replaced with one of pure shock. Then the anger returned and the brawl started.

The bowling alley manager, a bald man named Todd who smelled like old cigarettes, came in and broke up the fight. When asked who was responsible, Clyde and all the other players in the room pointed at us. Todd the Manager told us that we were banned for life from ever coming back and wouldn't listen to our protests. We walked out of the horrible smelling bowling alley with our heads hung low.

I never even got to fight my match.

On our walk home that night, Kathy had tried apologizing to Joseph, but he assured her that she had done nothing wrong. That he was sorry that he let his anger get the best of him. That he was sorry she had to been called those things. And that he was sorry for even suggesting they go to the local tourney. Kathy accepted all the things Joseph said graciously, but their relationship was never quite the same and they broke up a few weeks later.

That night left a bad taste in a mouth that would never quite leave. My experience with fighting games had been nothing but positive until that point. I had expected the local tournament to be a fun experience. A place where we could hang out with like minded individuals. Make new friends. But the other players at the tournament had seemed shrewd, mean spirited, and so very very angry. But angry at what? The world? What were they all so damn angry about? I couldn't stop seeing Clyde's horrible pinched face.

"Fighting games are awesome," Joseph had said that night. "But man do some of the players suck."

\--------

Joseph had kept in contact pretty frequently during his first year in Japan. He would send me emails and whatsapp texts discussing the cultural differences between Japan and the USA.  He would tell me how he think his co-workers at the school hate him, but his class loves him. He would described to me in great detail all the delicious foods he was eating and the amazing walks he would go on at night. How much he truly loved it there. And yes he would also send me videos of him playing fighting games, many of which had never even gotten a U.S. release. 

"It's like heaven over here dude," Joseph said to me in a text one day. "Fighting game nirvana."

\----------

I started to lose contact with Joseph near the end of the 2019. His emails became less frequent, and when he did get back to me, it was only ever a sentence or two. Sometimes even less.

*Doing good.* 

*Yeah. That's cool.*

*Okay, sounds good.*

*Sure. Yeah I'm good*.

*Yup.* 

By 2020 I had lost complete contact with Joseph. He didn't have any family left in the town that I lived in and I didn't know anyone else in Japan that could check on him or tell me how he was. The last email he sent before he completely stopped contacting me was only one sentence:

***Think I found a really good fighting game.***

\--------------------

It was in late February of 2022 when Joseph contacted me. Two years since I had last heard from him. When I saw the email in my inbox, I almost didn't believe it was real. The contents of the email were sparse. Just that that he was coming back to the U.S. in March and he wanted to know if he could stay at my place when he came back. That he had changed numbers and he was sorry for not being in touch more. I replied that he absolutely could stay at my place and asked him how he was. His only response was the date he'd be coming in town. I shot him an email offering to pick him up from Chicago O'hare, but he said he would take the bus into town instead.

Oh, and that he couldn't wait to play a new fighting game with me. 

\------------

It was on March 16th that I saw Joseph again. I was waiting at the bus stop, when around 8:00 PM a long tired looking greyhound bus pulled in. I watched as the passengers disembarked and retrieved their luggage. There weren't many people. A couple of college kids, an older couple, a man dressed in a fine business suit. The last person to get off the bus was a rail thin man, who wore all black. He had greasy slicked back hair, sunken eyes, and a pale face. 

I looked confused because I was sure that Joseph said he was going to be on the 8 O'clock bus, but my friend was nowhere to be found. 

Then after retrieving his luggage, the man with the greasy slicked back hair waved at me. 

It was Joseph. 

\----------

When Joseph began walking towards me I almost fainted. He looked nothing like the man I dropped off the airport four years ago. Instead he looked like some pallid scarecrow slowly descending upon me. He had always been a skinny guy, but now he was skeletal. And the clothes he was wearing - a black sweatshirt, with a black tee underneath, black jeans, and black boots - was so in contrast to the colorful jackets and shirts he use to wear. And there were deep purple bags under his eyes, like he hadn't slept in days.

But when he smiled and held out his arms for a hug, there was still a ghost of the old Joseph in there, and that put me at ease. A little. But only a little. 

"Long time no see, dude," Joseph said with a sickly grin. His voice was hoarse. Like he had been at a concert the night before, screaming his lungs out.

We embraced.

\-------

On the car ride we exchanged the normal pleasantries, and talked the usually talk of two friends-who had become strangers- trying to find rhythm with each other again. Like two band-mates who had not played with each other for years, and were trying to slip back into old ways, when the music was good. And then Joseph explained that he had gotten real busy with work and with the pandemic and everything going on, that he had simply lost touch. 

"You know how it is, right dude?" Joseph said.

"Sure. Yeah. I get that. No worries man."

"Oh, I'm not worried," Joseph responded curtly. And there was a defensiveness to his voice that I had never heard before. "Farrrr from it. I'm done working overseas now. I got something big planned. Yes sir."

"Really? Like what?" I asked genuinely curious. Joseph had yet to explain what work, if any work, he'd be doing now that he was back in the States. 

"Oh, you'll see," Joseph said and there was a devilish gleam in his eyes. I merely nodded bemused.

"So, tell me about this new fighting game," I said. The devilish gleam in Joseph's eyes was gone instantly. It was replaced with what I can only describe as the look of a man who is starving, and has now come across an all you can eat buffet. Only it's not really an all you can eat buffet. It's three day old road kill. But to a starving man, what's the difference? It was a ferociously hungry look. 

"Wait until you see it my man. Just wait until you see."

&#x200B;

\--------------

We stopped at a gas station. I filled up and then Joseph said he wanted to go in to grab a red bull and some snacks. I offered to buy and we both went in together. After we gathered up the goods, we went to wait in line at the register. There was an older customer talking to a young man behind the counter. They had an easy going repertoire with each other. If Joseph and I had sounded like band-mates who were out of practice, then these two sounded like band-mates who played nightly gigs together. I was instantly aware that the old man must be a regular at the gas station. The old man was holding up the line, but I had no problem with letting him finish his conversation. The conversation they were having was actually quite funny and I was beginning to laugh myself-

"Hey, you old fuck, can you hurry it up?"

I turned to Joseph shocked. He was glaring at the old man. Leering at at him. It reminded me in a lot of ways, the way Clyde aka Clyd3 leered at Kathy all those years ago. And Joseph was wearing that same angry pinched face.

"Dude, not cool-" I began to say, but Joseph pushed past me. The red bull he had been holding was now in a grip, as if he meant to swing it at any second. 

"If you're not buying anything, then get the fuck out of line," Joseph continued. People in the gas station were looking at us now. The old man simply looked down, ashamed. As if he'd been caught doing something bad.

"I'm sorry," the old man said weakly. "Just like talking with my pal here-"

"I don't fucking care," Joseph said. "Get out of line. Now."

The old man moved aside. The young man behind the counter looked like he wanted to say something, but he simply mumbled something under his breath. I paid the cashier for our drinks and snacks and then walked out the gas station more embarrassed then I had ever been in my life. 

"Fucking cunts, am I right?" Joseph said when we got back in the car. 

"S-sure," I said like an idiot. I was too embarrassed to say anything else, and honestly too intimidated to challenge Joseph in anyway. Joseph had always been an agreeable person. We had hardly ever got in fights as kids. I mean how could you fight with Joseph? He had always been so cool. So chill. The idea of disagreeing with him felt wrong. Even now. When he was acting like a complete stranger.

And he was still holding the redbull in a death grip. 

\----------

"Are you ready?" Joseph was sitting crossed legged in the middle of my apartment. He had barely taken time to get situated. He simply threw his luggage in one corner of the living room and then pulled a white square slip out of his sweat shirt.

"Is that it?" I asked pointing at the white slip. "The fighting game I've been hearing so much about?"

"Sure is," Joseph said. He put his hands into the white slip and produced a gray disk. There was no cover art on the disc. No logo. The only thing on the front of the disk were two words written crudely in black marker. 

It read: FIGHTING GAME.

"Seriously, it's called 'Fighting Game'?" I said trying to hold back laughter. But I didn't laugh too much. I didn't want Joseph to think I was laughing at him. I was still thinking about the gas station incident. "And the disc looks so bootleg."

"That's just a working title," Joseph said. "And forget about disc art. You've never seen anything like this game before. It puts Tekken, Street Fighter, KOF, all those frauds to shame."

Joseph inserted the disc into my PS5 and immediately the console began to make noises like an airplane engine. I gave Joseph a terrified look. I had spent weeks trying to get a PS5 back in December and now it sounded like whatever Joseph stuck inside of it was destroying it. Joseph saw the look of concern on my face and held up a hand, as if to say *chill out.*

*Why didn't you chill out at the gas station Jo*, is what I wanted to say. I kept quiet. 

Eventually, my PS5 stopped sounding like a plane about to lift off and eased back into a quiet steady rhythm. A thumbnail appeared on the PS5 homepage. It was a blank disc. The usual thumbnail when the PS5 is reading something that's not officially licensed or that it's not aware of. Joseph picked up the controller and clicked on the thumbnail. 

The game started. 

\-----------

Unlike most fighting games, 'FIGHTING GAME' had no cinematic intro showing off all the cool characters. Instead, we were shown a black screen with white text that simply read: **Press Any Button To Start.**

Joseph did. 

Then another black screen with white text:

**SINGLE PLAYER**               **MULTIPLAYER**

Joseph clicked on multiplayer and threw me the other controller. Faintly, I was aware of how wrong Joseph looked holding a controller. I couldn't remember the last time I had seen him use a controller over a fight stick. A took a quick glance at his luggage, but it didn't look like he had brought a fight stick with him. It was like the Joseph in front of me was some bizarro version of him that came from another dimension.

Then we were shown a curious thing on the screen. Most fighting games will let you choose what stage you want to play on from a variety of options. And most fighting games will give you multiple characters to choose from. Most games will start off with something like 5-10 characters at launch.

But FIGHTING GAME only presented us with one stage on the screen. There was a picture of a bar and underneath the image it read: MANCHESTER, ENGLAND(BAR)

And there were only two characters to choose from underneath that. One was a man wearing a red Manchester United jersey. The other was a man wearing a Blue Manchester City jersey.

Joseph saw my curious look and said, "The stage and characters change every time you start a new match. It's always a new location, with two new characters to choose from. Wild right? Here, I'll take the guy in blue."

And he selected the man in the Manchester City jersey. That left the man in the red Manchester United jersey. 

I selected him.

\------

What followed next is what I can only describe as the greatest fighting game I have played. Not only were the graphics some of the most photo-realistic graphics I had ever seen, but the gameplay itself was masterful. There were no supernatural move-sets in FIGHTING GAME. No energy blasts or anything like that. The game had a very realistic fighting style that was more akin to a UFC game, then a traditional fighter, but the movement was so smooth. Movement is a big appeal in fighting games. You never want your characters to feel too heavy or too light. FIGHTING GAME struck the perfect balance. You could also interact with the stage, picking up stools or whatever was by you and hit your opponent with it. At the end of the match, Joseph picked up a pool stick and impaled me with it, depleting what was left of my health bar. 

Blood ran down the pool stick as **GAME OVER** appeared on the screen. Which was then replaced by the word **REMATCH.**

We played several more matches.  And just like Joseph said every time we started a new match, we were given a new location with two new characters to choose form. The locations ranged from all over the world. From Australia, to China, to Ireland, to Russia etc... One stage was set in a church in Brazil and the characters were a priest and a nun. The characters were always specific to the location in some funny way like that.  At least at the time I thought it was funny. Knowing what I know now....

And for the first time that night, Joseph felt like the old Joseph again. We laughed gleefully as we played. He even gave me tips like back in the old days. I had started to get a really good hold of the game when something strange happened...

The next stage was set in the U.S. It was not the first stage we played that had been set in the U.S. But it was significant for a few reasons.

The stage was set in a gas station. 

An *awfully familiar* looking gas station. 

Underneath the image it simply read: WISCONSIN, UNITED STATES(Gas Station).

*We* were in Wisconsin. 

And the two characters? Can you guess? One was an old man, and the other was a younger man wearing what looked like a gas station uniform. The two characters looked too familiar. 

*But it can't be them*, I told myself. That was impossible. We were just playing a video game, right? A stupid bootleg fighting game that Joseph brought over from Japan. 

"Dude, am I crazy?" I began to say. "Or do those guys kind of look like...like the guys we saw earlier tonight?"

Joseph stared at me and then broke out into laughter. It was a horrible sounding laugh. A mean spirited laugh. The same laughter Clyde and the boys spewed at us as we walked out of the bowling alley that night. A laugh that said *'Jokes on you fuckface.'*

"You're crazy," Joseph said. "Here, I'll take the young guy. You get the old man." 

Joseph destroyed me. I mean utterly destroyed me. I watched in horror as the young gas station attendant stomped on the old man's head and then threw his face into the ICEE machine. And Joseph had seemed so angry and determined while playing. Like a man on a mission. When the match was over Joseph let out an exhaustive, almost orgasmic sounding scream. 

"There!" Joseph said. "How do you like that, you old fuck!"

A kind of unreality began to wash over me. It all started to feel wrong. I began to feel lightheaded. I could hear Joseph laughing and cheering in triumph, but he sounded far away. Then gathering myself, I told him I was done playing for the night.

"Sure thing dude," Joseph said as I walked towards my room. "I'm gonna play for a bit more. Wild game right?"

\-----------------------

That night I had a terribly vivid dream. I was back in the bowling alley from all those years ago. I was walking out with Joseph and Kathy, our heads hung low, and everyone else in the room was pointing and laughing at us. Only it's not Joseph and Kathy anymore. It's the old man and the gas station attendant. Both their faces are bloodied and bruised. And there's another Joseph in the room. An older Joseph, with greasy slicked back hair, and deep sunken eyes. And he's standing in the corner. And he's pointing at us and laughing with the rest of the crowd.  Laughing so wide it looks like he's screaming.

\--------------------

I woke up the next morning in a cold sweat. Dim sunlight slanted through the blinds. I rubbed my eyes and for a moment was in that blissful state of ignorance when you wake up. When you really don't remember the events of the night before. And then it all came flooding back to me. 

Joseph.

The gas station.

FIGHTING GAME. 

When I walked into the living room, Joseph was sleeping on the couch. He hadn't even bothered to pull out the bed. A PS5 controller was sitting idly on his chest. He was sleeping, but he looked like a corpse. The only sign that he was alive was a thin rattling sound that escaped his mouth. I had many sleepovers with Joseph during our childhood, and I don't ever remember him ever breathing like that. He sounded vaguely like a cat choking. 

I turned on the TV and began to flick through the channels. I stopped when I came across the local morning news. 

My heart sank. And then it began to beat rapidly. 

There had been a fight at the gas station. 

No, not a fight. 

A murder. 

The news anchor described how the attendant of a local 24 hour gas station had been arrested for beating an elderly customer to death. They had a reporter on the scene who was interviewing a witness. 

"I've never seen anything like it man," the witness was telling the reporter. "They just started fighting. I mean out of nowhere. One minute they were talking and the next they were at eachother's throats. He clobbered the old dude. I mean really whooped him."

When the reporter asked the witness if he or anyone else had tried to stop the fight, the witness said that he simply watched. That it had never crossed his mind to step in. Or even record it. That it had been like watching a movie. Or a video game. The witness began to look confused and told the reporter he didn't want to talk anymore. 

I turned the TV off. 

That same unreality from the night before began to wash over me. I looked over at the couch. 

Joseph was wide awake. 

And he was smiling.

"Cat's out of the bag, dude."

\---------------------

"This can't be real." My voice was thin. I was sitting in the corner of my living room, rocking back and forth. Joseph had just attempted to tell me what the deal was. What the game truly was and what it truly did. How he had been given the game by a man he met in Japan. A man he greatly revered. A man that Joseph simply called Player One. But I couldn't believe it. Refused to believe it. 

"It's all real," Joseph said. He was still grinning. His sunken eyes now looked wet and bright. And they were so very wide. 

"You really expect me to believe that all those matches we played...All those fights...Those were all real people?"

In my head I saw two men in a UK bar fighting to the death. One in a red Manchester United Jersey. The other in a blue Manchester City jersey. Not video game characters. But real men.

I saw a priest and a nun fighting in a church in Brazil.

I saw all the countless people we had controlled the night before. Not characters. But people.

And the thing all these people had in common? The terrified look on their faces. Terrified, because they had suddenly lost complete control of their bodies. 

"You saw the news report yourself," Joseph said spreading his hands. "You knew it the moment you saw the gas station in the game last night."

"You told me it wasn't them!" I yelled. 

"I didn't want to freak you out," Joseph said. 

"Oh, mission fucking accomplished then," I said sarcastically. "Did you...did you put them in the game somehow?"

"No," Joseph said. And he sounded disappointed. As if he wished he could control who appeared in the game. "The game decides who becomes a selectable character. I was shocked to see them. Although it's not the first time I've seen someone I know in the game. It's rare, but it happens." 

And a terrible grin spread across his face.

"This is all wrong," I said.

"We're doing God's work," Joseph said. And that ferociously hungry look appeared on his face again. The look of a starving man about to chow on some roadkill. "That's what Player One said to me. What he *taught* me over the past two years. This game was given to us by God. And the players chosen are his sacrifices. It's *His* work. I know this is a lot to take in, but you have no idea the things I've seen. If you just-"

"GET. OUT." I hurled the words at Joseph. 

Joseph shrugged. As if he had been expecting this. I eyed my PS5 wearily. I knew that deep in it's guts was the disc for FIGHTING GAME. Sitting in the console like some gray dead tongue. I ran towards the console and hit the eject button. The disc lolled out of the console and now it really did look like a tongue. A tongue with crude black marker written all over it. I grabbed the disc and snapped it in half. I turned towards Joseph, a triumphant look on my face. It died when I saw him.

Joseph was smiling.  Again as if he had been expecting this. Then he walked over to his luggage and took out a black binder. He opened it and revealed countless gray discs. Pages and pages of them sitting in gray transparent sleeves. Each of them scrawled over with black sharpie. Each of them reading the same thing: FIGHTING GAME.

"I told you I have big plans," Joseph said. "I really wanted you to be apart of this."

"Joseph that game...it's evil. Can't you fucking see that? We're the reason that old man is dead. Jesus. Jesus Christ." I felt the Doritos and red bull from the night before coming up my stomach.

"You don't get it. It's God's-"

"Just get out!" I yelled. "Please Joseph. Just get out. And...don't come back. I can't be apart of this."

Joseph actually looked hurt by this. His face scrunched up in a frown, and it sickened me that for a moment I saw my old friend again. The Joseph who had taught me everything about fighting games. The Joseph who had been my closest friend. He looked genuinely hurt.

But the look was gone as soon as it came and was replaced by the grinning ghoul my friend had become. And there was another face there too. A relentlessly angry looking face.

"You're loss," Joseph said gathering his sparse luggage. He never let go of the black binder. He held it in a death grip the same way he had held the red bull can the night before. He walked towards the door and then turned towards me. "We don't choose who appears in the game, but who knows maybe one day I'll see you in there. Wouldn't that be a riot? But I wonder. Should I choose to play as you or choose to fight you?"

"Get. Out."

He left. 

\-----------

I don't know where Joseph lives now. I haven't spoken to him. And I've only seen him once since then. 

It was about a month ago. In May.

I was driving home and coincidentally drove past the old bowling alley. Although maybe it wasn't a coincidence. Maybe there was some part in the back of my mind that knew he would be there. Knew that I needed to see him one last time.

Joseph was there in the parking lot. He was wearing all black and he was surrounded by at least a dozen men who were also wearing all black. And I swear one of them looked just like Clyde aka Clyd3. He was older looking and balding. But he had the same pinched face. 

Each man had controller or fight stick in one hand.

And in the other hand they were carrying a white slip. 

And I knew for certain that in each of those white slips was a gray disc with crude black marker written over it. 

Joseph was speaking to the men. I couldn't hear what he was saying, but he had the appearance of a drill sergeant speaking to fresh new recruits. They all looked so angry. Angry at the world. There was another man there too. He was the only one not holding a controller or a disc. He was an incredibly tall and thin looking man. He stood a little behind Joseph, with his arms behind his back. If Joseph was a drill sergeant, then this man carried himself like a General.

 I watched Joseph and for a split second I thought our eyes met.

And then Joseph smiled that terrible smile. 

The last thing I saw before my car turned the corner was Joseph and the rest of the men marching into the bowling alley. I guess Joseph isn't banned anymore. Or maybe Todd the Manager just doesn't recognize him. 

They marched into that bowling alley, not like men about to play a video game. But like men about to go about some great work.

 *God's work*, I suppose. 

\------------------------

I don't play fighting games anymore.

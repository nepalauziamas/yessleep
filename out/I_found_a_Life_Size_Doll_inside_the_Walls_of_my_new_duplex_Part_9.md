We pushed the pink bed to the [door](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/wjdrg8/i_found_a_life_size_doll_inside_the_walls_of_my/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf), listening to the doll trying to claw its way into the room for the better part of ten minutes. 

The rumble of the storm outside and the thought of impending dread as we waited had me on pins and needles as I checked Chuck’s injuries and then looked at my phone. No cell phone service due to the rain and if I didn’t get him to a hospital by morning… I didn’t want to even consider losing him though. 

“It will be fine. Eventually the spell will take effect and they will be forced to switch. Andrea can be human again and then it should be safe,” I said. 

“I'm not going anywhere near that thing,” Chuck stammered as he struggled to keep consciousness. The blow to his head was severe and I knew it was likely he might blackout at any second. He was right, given how unpredictable Andrea could be as a doll; there was no guarantee that she was safe as a human either. We had to find another way out of here. 

“Then we will go upstairs, there must be another way out,” I told him. 

His eyes were becoming heavy as he grabbed my arm and muttered, “Find Macie. Help her.” 

“You’re coming with me,” I insisted. 

“Too weak. I’m… sorry…” he stammered. 

I watched as he slipped into unconsciousness, and even though I knew it was inevitable I still tried to fight it. 

“Stay with me Chuck, come on,” I said, slapping his wrist gently. But it was too late, he was out and I was alone. 

I checked my phone again and then turned toward the cramped staircase to the attic. My only option was to find a way out and get help. 

I placed Chuck beside the bed with one of the pillows to keep him comfortable and then walked toward the shadowy hidden steps. 

I checked the wall for a light switch, unsurprised to see that there wasn’t one. Just a bunch of scribbles of crayons from Penny drawing in the dark. 

As I progressed up the stairs it occurred to me the poor girl likely spent the majority of her time up here, trapped to play alone because her father was afraid she would escape and become a doll somewhere beyond the confines of this house. 

That wasn’t even really living at all, I realized as I came to the top of the stairs and peered down the hallway. There were two rooms and the hall itself was littered with old boxes that were covered in dust. I walked over to the first door, pushing it open to see the hum of a small television. There must be a generator up here to provide it power, I thought as I looked at the screen. There was a children’s program playing, toys on the floor, including even a small antique doll with what looked like human hair. So this was Penny’s other room, her prison for when she became human. 

I looked toward the wall where scratch marks showed how she had grown over the years with measuring and wondered if her mother hadn’t accidentally died would she have ever had a normal life. Did she even age now because of the spell? How could her parents have ever thought this would be a good idea? Just seeing how the room reminded me of a padded cell made me realize there was no way they cared for her anymore. 

I went back to the hallway, trying the other room but finding that the door wouldn’t budge. Then I heard the soft sound of a mouse scuffling across the floor and turned to catch it with my flashlight. Maybe the little animal had found a way out, I thought as I hurried to find it.  

I pushed the boxes aside and saw that it was crawling into a broken ventilation shaft that led down toward our duplex. 

As the mouse moved along I heard that familiar rattling and almost panicked. 
But it couldn’t be the dolls, they were downstairs, I realized. 

I leaned down and used the phone to look down the tiny hole, realizing I could see what looked like a small journal on the far side. 

Was that the spellbook?

I searched through the boxes of contents more for anything that might help to pop the lock of the second room, convinced more secrets were hidden there as well. 

At the bottom of one of the boxes I found a toolbox and grabbed a hammer. Using it I slammed against the door knob of the second room. 

Eventually the lock snapped and the door slipped open. 

What I saw on the other side will haunt me for the rest of my days. 

Long black tendrils of webbing spooled around the edge of the room, clustering together to form a mass of ebbing sacks that appeared to be filled with glowing puss. The strange material swirled around to form a cocoon that hung from the ceiling, and in the middle of each capsule, 
barely even looking human anymore; were a trio of corpses. 

I recognized each of them immediately even though the color was drained from their bodies and their features were fading away. 

One of them was Sarah, her body was the one nearly consumed by the gigantic webbing and to the right was the human body of Andrea, the puss sacks seemingly draining her of life even now. 

The next one was Rose, the original witch that had started all of this madness. And seeing her made me want to crumple to the floor. 

I was holding onto the hope that finding her alive would break the spell, but now; I felt hopeless again. 

Especially because in the midst of these corpses I saw the one person that I was trying to save stuck in their own cocoon. The only one still possibly alive. 

Macie. 

I squeezed the hammer and started to hack at the webbing, but it was a pointless effort. It was like cutting off a chameleon’s tail, except the sack of living tendrils that held them there was clearly faster at healing. 


I ran back to the boxes, thinking quickly as I tried to find a better weapon. 

I tossed box after box aside, realizing there was nothing else useful up here. Just knick knacks and old items that hadn’t been used in ages. Beyond the house, the storm raged and the power flickered and died. 

Fuck, things just got worse I realized as I checked my phone. My battery was almost gone too. I saw that the light was still on in the second room and realized the generator had to be in there somewhere. But there was no way to reach that with the black webbing in the way. 

Then a sudden thought came to me, the candles in our duplex. I could burn the webbing! 

With the hammer in my hand I dashed down the stairs to the girl’s room, ready to use it to defend myself and get past the doll. But in the dark it was impossible to be sure where anything was at including Chuck. I could however tell that the doll had stopped trying to scratch at the door, so I took my chances and fumbled to move the furniture, stepping out to the dark hallway. 

The house was mysteriously silent at first as I moved around, clutching the hammer even tighter. Then I heard Penny humming to herself, and her feet pitter pattered across the cold floor. 

I could just barely make the outline of the front door. Instead, as I pushed forward I realized something big had been pushed in front of the door to prevent my escape. At the same time, I felt fingers playing with my hair. Andrea.

I reacted as fast as I could, swinging the hammer around and smashing it against her face. The doll’s perfect features broke apart in the same place where I had splashed water earlier and a sudden thought ran through my hate. 
Water… they seem to not like water, I realized as the now faceless doll screeched and I used all of my energy to push her straight into the bathroom. 

The doll tumbled backward, smashing against the mirror and glass scattering everywhere. At the very same moment, I reached for the hammer from her face, ripping it out and this time using it to smash apart the sink. 

Water spewed out toward her arm and immediately the doll reacted violently, screaming and lashing toward me with even more rage. 

I stood back, reaching for the shower curtain and ripping it from the pole, pushing it onto the doll. It fell forward into the shower. And I turned the shower head on, watching as water fell overtop the animated monster. 

I couldn’t pull my eyes away as I listened to the doll shriek, the water melting it’s pristine features. A mixture of anguish, sorrow and vengeance came over me as the doll struggled to escape the bath, it’s features finally completely collapsing until there was nothing left but a mass of sludge. 

Just a puddle of goop with what had once been fake body parts now slurping down the drain and clogging the shower. 

As the sludge pooled into the drain, I took a moment to savor the short victory; reeling from the incident. 

But this nightmare was far from over.

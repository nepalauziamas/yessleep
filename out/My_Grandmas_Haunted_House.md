A true story about my Grandma's Haunted House:

My Grandma's house is located in a small town in Indiana. I grew up right across the street from it. I spent a lot of time in that house, and have experienced some crazy things! This is the story of my very first paranormal experience, and as you probably guessed from the title, it happened inside my Grandma's house.

To get a clear understanding of what makes this house so special, it was built in 1845, and the underground railroad that was tunneled out under the town ended at that house. The tunnel was sealed off by the city roughly in the 2010's. The city use to give tours of the underground railroad that ran through the city until it was deemed unsafe and the entrance had to be sealed up. The house was built by a doctor, and he would treat slaves as they came to the house from the tunnels. There is also a trail next to my Grandma's house that leads to a family cemetery. The cemetery is a small family cemetery, and has had report of paranormal things happening there. I even shared one of my own experiences in the trails leading to that cemetery on this sub. The doctor who built the house is buried there. The rumor is, a lot of the people buried there died in that house. One of them supposedly hung themselves in the upstairs bathroom.

One night, I was trying to fall asleep upstairs. The bedroom I was in was in between two other bedrooms. We called this the "middle bedroom." As I was in bed trying to fall asleep, I heard footsteps coming up the stairs. I originally thought it was Grandma wanting to check on me. As the steps neared the top of the stairs I was startled because I didn't see anyone come up. The footsteps stopped for a moment, then began again, but now the steps were in the hallway! I had a direct line of sight to the hallway from the room I was in, and still nobody was there. I covered my head with my blankets because I was so terrified that I didnt know what else to do. I could still hear the footsteps as they walked back and forth in the hallway from the first bedroom to the third bedroom. Every round passing in front of the middle bedroom. I stayed under the covers and every once in a while I would work up enough courage to look, but still did not see anything. I just knew this had to be a ghost. Up until that moment, I have never been so scared in my entire life!

This took place for hours, so this wasnt something that went on for a brief moment. This made it impossible to mistake exactly what was going on. A ghost that I couldn't see was no doubt patrolling the upstairs of my Grandma's house!

A few months later my aunt asked me if I ever stayed in the middle bedroom, and if I heard the same footsteps walking the hallway that she heard when she was a little girl growing up in that house. The family legend is that the ghost that walks the hallway is a guy we called Mr. Sellers. My cousin and I even found pictures that belonged to him in an upstairs closet. 

This was the first of many paranormal experiences I had in my life. Because of the things that happened to me and other family members inside that house, I took an interest in the paranormal. I documented a lot of my experiences on my paranormal podcast Brave the Basement. I spent a lot of time in life ghost hunting, and continue to hunt to this day. I owe it all to my Grandma's Haunted House.

Things were fine between Macie and I until we moved in together. 

Not at first though, because the beginning was good. At least I can still hold onto that. 

We had managed to sign a six month lease at a duplex that wasn’t far from our jobs for only a third of the normal price, which had us on cloud nine. 

But soon we realized why we had gotten it for such a steal. First and foremost, the previous tenant had failed to remove any of their shit so there was furniture, clothes and all kinds of junk just all throughout the place. 

Then we had to deal with the fact that the power wasn’t turned on yet. 

“We can use candles,” Macie said as we started to clear things out. The entire house felt so chilly it was hard to imagine it could ever feel like home. 

It looked like it had been a single woman, probably just trying to survive paycheck to paycheck, I thought as I saw the ramen noodles in the pantry. 

“She just up’n’disappeared one day, no notice, nothing. You can do whatever you want with her shit and the stuff you don’t want, trash it,” the landlord told us. 

Once some of the furniture was out of the way I used my phone as a flashlight to start taking down her family portraits and pulling nails from the walls. 

Her life looked like that of a typical goth girl, trying to juggle social life with responsibility. Some pictures were her out having parties with friends, others where she was prim and proper for family. Reminded me a lot of myself to be honest. 


Next, I pulled the nails from the bedroom hallway, forcefully taking part of the plaster off in the process. 

It tumbled to the floor revealing something more than just a bare wall behind it. 

There was some kind of closet behind the wall, I realized as I took my hammer and started to break apart the thin plaster. 

Gradually the wall fell back, revealing a long thin closet that looked like it hadn’t been used in years. 

“Hey Macie… come take a look at this…” I called to her as I used my phone’s light to get a better view of everything. 

There were shoes on the floor covered in dust, all stacked neatly under organized outfits that matched them. Everything was perfectly in its place, but clearly unused for quite some time. I pushed the hangars aside to see what else was back there. 

I kicked something on the floor and it rolled behind the long coats, forcing me to look down as I slid them aside. 

Then I saw its feet. And I screamed. 

My flashlight traveled up the length of the body, a strange and eerie feeling rushing up and down my spine as I realized it was a doll that was about my height. It had pale plastic skin and bright blue eyes. Blonde hair and an hourglass figure. It looked like a life size Barbie doll. 

As soon as I screamed, I heard a loud knocking on the other side of the wall and a man’s voice. 

“I said keep it down!!!” 

I rushed out of the hidden closet, my heart pounding out my chest as I ran smack into Macie. 

“Hey, I heard you in here…. What’s going on?” she asked. 

Then there was a knock at the door. Loud and repetitive. Frustrated. 

“Hold that thought,” she said, grabbing a candle and we went to the den together, my nerves still jittery after what I had seen. 

Unlatching the door just slightly enough to peek out, we found ourselves staring at a buff middle aged man that was covered head to toe in tattoos with crumbs in his facial hair and bags under his eyes. 

“You two new?” he snapped. 

“Just moved in,” Macie answered. I could tell the strain in her voice meant she was trying to be cordial. 

“Listen, I work nights so next time you start banging shit around I swear that I will come over here and slam my fist into your face. Ya copy?” 

Macie’s eyes flashed rage. 

“Look you son of a-“ I grabbed her arm and shoved her back, smiling politely through gritted
teeth. “What my partner is trying to say is… we will keep that in mind. Sorry.” 

He wiped snot from his nose and huffed off as I latched the door back and breathed a sigh of relief. Macie gave me a glare. 

“What the hell was that? I could have handled that guy.” 

“And came out with a bloody nose or far worse,” I said dryly. 

“Whatever. So what did you want to show me?” she asked, crossing her arms. 

I tugged her by the arm, taking her to the hidden alcove I had found. 

Using her smartphone to light the way, Macie gingerly stepped through the hideaway hole into the shadowy closet. A few more feet and she was right in front of the doll. 

Immediately she jumped back, “Holy shit. You could have warned me!” 

“What the hell do you think it is?” I asked nervously. 

“How should I fucking know. What I do know is we are gonna get it out of here,” she replied as she put her down and wrapped her arms around the huge doll. 

“Jesus Christ this thing is heavy,” Macie complained. I tried to help her but even with our combined strength it would not budge. 

“Don’t throw out your back, you have work tomorrow,” I told her. 

She stepped back, rubbing her muscles sorely and remarking, “I guess we could call my dad. He probably has a dolly that can lift the thing.” 

We went back to the hallway, ducking through the hole again to avoid causing any damage and as we did I asked, “Is there something we can use to… I don’t know. Seal up this entrance?” 

She gave me a teasing look. “Think Chucky will chop you up tonight?” 

“Come on, don’t make fun. You were scared too.” 

She chuckled a little as we went to the bedroom. “You’re right, you’re right. But the look on your face is still priceless,” she said as we pushed one of our bookshelves into the hall. 

Once in place, I felt a little more at ease. 

Little did I know, the feeling wouldn’t last long.

We spent the rest of the afternoon getting as much moved out as we could. I let Macie take it easy due to her back and did most of the heavy lifting alone. By the time dinner had rolled around, at least eighty percent of the stuff from the duplex was in the dumpsters. 

Then Macie surprised me and ordered a pizza and we cuddled on our small couch and watched Netflix on her phone. 

“Thanks for having my back today,” I said as I snuggled a bit closer. 

“You mean about the doll or the neighbor?” she asked, ruffling my hair. 

I smirked, remembering how zealous she had appeared when the brutish man had threatened us. 

“Both I guess,” I told her, giving her cheek a soft peck. 

Eventually I fell asleep to the sound of a Seinfeld episode, exhausted and hoping that our problems were just a fluke in our new situation. 

It was a hope that I wish I could have held onto. 

I’m not sure when it happened, but I woke in the middle of the night feeling painfully cold. Macie had already gone to bed, leaving me on the couch to freeze. 

My bare feet touched the tile floor that was equally as chilly and I walked over to the hallway to check the temperature. 

We need to get that power on, I thought to myself as I realized it was too cold to get comfortable. 

I reached for a candle to light my path to the bedroom, nearly jumping out of my skin when I did. I saw Macie standing with her back to me, right in front of where the hidden alcove was at. 

“Jesus Christ you scared me to death!” I shouted at her. 

She didn’t budge. 

Suddenly the duplex felt a lot colder again. 

“Macie?” I whispered, wondering why she wasn’t responding to me. 
I crept over to her, touching her shoulder to get her attention. 

She pushed me away forcefully, mumbling something under her breath as she placed her palm against the wall. And began to scratch it with her fingernails. 

“Macie…. Macie wake up!”  I said, shaking her shoulders and pulling her away from the wall. 

She was saying something but I couldn’t make heads or tails what it meant. It sounded like gibberish. 

It sounded like some kind of foreign tongue. 

She refused my attempts, this time shoving me down and again clawing at the wall. The sounds she was making were louder now, like she was calling out to someone. 

It was like watching an animal struggling to free itself from a cage. 

I scrambled up to my feet, ran to the kitchen and poured a glass of water. 

Quickly I splashed it in her face and my partner gasped for breath, her eyes frantically darting around the room. 

“What the fuck,” Macie shouted looking down at her soaked pajamas. 

“I could say the same to you. What the fuck were you doing?” I asked. 

She looked confused and then saw the scratches on the wall and the shelf pushed aside. 

“I’m not:.. I’m not sure… was I sleepwalking? I never sleepwalk. Not since I was a little girl,” she whispered. 

I took a cautious step toward her, and then looked into the darkness of the closet. 

“Did you go in there?” I asked. 

“I’m not sure;” she repeated, running her palm across her face. She looked so dizzy and sweaty like she had just been on a three mile run. 

I used my smartphone to look into the hideyhole, just to be sure of something. 

The light flickered back and forth across the dusty floor to where I had found the doll. 
My heart dropped.
It wasn’t there anymore. It was gone.

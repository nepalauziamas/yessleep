Good morning. I know that we haven’t met but my husband talked to me about you
My name is Adeline and I am the CEO of AMA pharmaceutics. I'm writing to you because my husband heard from some colleague that you had some kind of sickness that the doctors hadn't been able to identify.

What I'm trying to say is that we are interested in running some tests if you are up to it.

You won't have to pay anything, we would pay you $853.000 for the possible inconveniences that could happen
If you are interested please write to the following number: 
Xxxxxxxxxx

Have a good rest of the day
Att: Adeline Morley”

That was the first thing I saw when I took my phone after the medical appointment.

To give a little background, my name is Catalina and I have been sick since I was born. At first, the doctors thought that I wouldn’t make it the first week, but here I am, 25 years and still alive.

If you can call this life.

The symptoms that I experiment with every day go from headaches to me fainting in the middle of my class. The doctors don’t know what is wrong with me so there isn’t much they can do to help except give me medicine for the pain.

That's why I texted the number that was in the mail. At this point, I would take any chance that someone could give me. And they are offering me money? I would do it for free but I'm not complaining about the money.

Hi, I am Catalina Harmon.
I am writing in response to the e-mail from Adeline Morley telling me about some kind of tests they want to run about me and my illness.
I am really interested in it and I want to know the details of the situation.

Within 5 minutes a response came to my phone.

Good morning Catalina, I am Adeline. I'm pretty glad you want to do it.
I'll send you an e-mail with all the information so you can take a look at it and then write me a confirmation.

I looked at my e-mail and there it was. To keep this short, it said that they would transfer half of the payment before the tests and the other half after. They wanted me to go to the principal lab of the pharmaceutics tomorrow at 6 pm and that I couldn't tell anyone about it for some kind of privacy clause. I found that weird but at this point, I think it is worth the risk.

In the worst scenario, I would die.

I sent a confirmation and continued with my day.

When I was heading to the lab I received an e-mail from a girl telling me not to go, that they have made something horrible to her and that it wasn't worth it.

I blocked the number.

When I arrived a guy received me and took me to a waiting room. After 20 minutes a woman (that I guessed was Adeline) met me with a hug and guided me to another room.

There was something weird about the situation but I just kept going.

When I entered what looked like a consulting room, a man appeared and made me sign some papers in case i “died”.

I have to admit, I was starting to regret my decision but when I went to tell them that I didn't want to do it anymore, Adeline injected me with something and I fell asleep very quickly.

When I woke up I was naked and tied to the bed.

I. Freaked. The. Fuck. Out

I started screaming but a voice from a speaker on the wall said that I agreed to that when I signed the papers and that they were going to fix me.

What. The. Fuck

Everything went dark and then something bright entered through a door at the back of the room. It came close to me but I couldn't see what it was or what was happening.

It started touching me everywhere. And when I say everywhere I mean it.

I started crying, I felt gross and just wanted to leave. Because the bright thing had human fingers.

I started screaming again, trying to scare the thing but it kept going. After what felt like an eternity (but could perfectly have been only 3 minutes) it stopped, looked at the speaker, and told something I didn't understand because it wasn't in English.

It left the room, the lights went on again and a group of three people entered the room. 2 men I didn't know and Adeline. Keep in mind that I was naked, tied, and absolutely terrified. They told me something I didn't understand but because I was freaking out.

After some time they realized that and injected me with something to make me sleep.

I woke up in a hospital room.

When I asked what happened they told me I had been in a car accident 6 days ago and had pretty bad wounds but that I would live.

I remembered everything but I know that I couldn't say a thing because no one would believe me.

My regular doctor came in the room and told me that some kind of miracle have happened because all my tests that used to be really bad, now looked perfect.

No one knew hoy did it happen, but I had an idea.

Do you believe in aliens?
No?

Well, now I do. I know that I didn't hallucinate it and I also knew that the thing that touched me, wasn't human. It was something else.

It's been 5 years since the “accident” and since then I haven't experienced a single headache. I have been able to do things that I have only dreamed of. Now I can run, jump and swim.

Some nights I have nightmares about what happened and sometimes it feels so real that I have to go to the bathroom to vomit.

One time I dreamed that I woke up and that shiny thing was there with me. Inside me.

I'm sick of those nightmares but at least I am healthy. And I don't know how to feel about it.

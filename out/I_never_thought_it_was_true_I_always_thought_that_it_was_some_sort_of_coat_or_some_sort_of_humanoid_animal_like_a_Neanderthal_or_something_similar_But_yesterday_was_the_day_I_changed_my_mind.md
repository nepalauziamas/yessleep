I'm a archaeologist & historian, I was born in a small city in Montana and moved to Springfield when I was 22. I started attending at the Chicago University as a student online during the pandemic. It was an entire process to get in and work but I ended up getting all A's. But I'm sure your not here to hear about my good grades in collage. I was given a opportunity by Dr. Muller to go on a dig out in Iceland. I was excited! The dig was for a supposed Viking civilization out towards the west coast of Iceland. I left June 10th, 2022, for summer break. We had gotten there with a few of my peers and Dr. Muller. We landed near a hotel on a mountain side and walked from the airport to there. From the hotel it was about a 17.3 mile hike. We got used to the climate and took a few tours before we eventually made the hike, we found the site with a few dozen people there, we started digging.

Today 1:02am

"Hey Muller! Come look at this!" Yelled Moritz.

We walked over to Moritz only to almost fall into a small ditch. I stumbled back.

"Be careful there friend, we don't want our top student dying eh?" Moritz said jokingly as he bumped me with his elbow.

"Yeah, yeah that would be bad, wow. Okay, so what are we looking at?" I puffed out.

"It seems to be a primitive freezer, a sort of cave isolated with leather and ice to keep meats and veggies cool and frozen, we had someone go down there but they haven't come back, thinking it's a temple or it's booby trapped." Moritz said as his happy go lucky smile dropped into a concerned, questioning face.

"So you're sending ME down there?" I yelled, almost offended I was a rescue team and almost expendable.

"Yeah, your getting paid for this aren't ya? Wanna get a few more bucks?" Moritz teased as he handed me the gear.

"Ugh, fine, give me a knife to." I groaned as I put my harness on and hooked my strap onto the pole hanging above the hole.

I sat down and slipped down the icy and sharp rocks, I grabbed onto the rope for dear god, and pulled myself down and down until I felt my boats hit the ground. I turned on my flashlight and looked around, lots of ancient frozen meats like seal and whale, leather falling off of the loose rigged walls.

I looked around until eventually I saw my peer laying down on the ground, a frozen piece of meat in his hand.

"Oh god, what the fuck? Why are you eating that! Huldar are you there? Huldar! Can anyone hear me? Hello!?" I shouted as my heart raced up and down, riding inside of my chest like a poorly made roller coaster.

"I can." I heard someone say. I whipped around and gripped my knife, there standing was a man in a long coat, almost like a trench coat. I gripped my knife and started walking towards the figure.

As I was about to open my mouth and tell the man to put his hands up, the light above me vanished, like a candle being snuffed out, and I couldn't move, I was frozen.

"You're not supposed to be here, only they are supposed to be here, and because your kind ignored the warning, you will leave their kind, and you will join me." The man said as I could hear his bulky yet naked feet walk around me. I felt a piece of cold, hard cut meat slide into my mouth, I couldn't help but chew, it tasted like dirt and I could feel the blood flowing from it, but I needed more. I needed more.

"More?" He asked. "Yes, yes, Jeg har brug for mere!" I mumbled, I wasn't make these noises but they were coming from me, I didn't even understand them. "Good" He said "But I can't give you anymore, you must sit and ferment like your friend over there before you can eat, but before you die I might as well have you ask a question or two so speak on."

"What is this? Who are you?" I yelled, in a deep and scratchy voice.

"I am the source of life, the tree of life is what people around here call me, for your find to keep feeding I need food, I need fermented ancient food, specifically humans. Not only does it need to be cured in this room, but it needs to fermented in the prayers of my followers, it must be baptized for me to feed." The man said in one effortless sentence.

"So you, you are the man, the man in every painting, in the center of a circle, people dancing around you, you were no animal, you were no scarecrow, you were our god, our ruler." I said as my vocal cords slowly tightened into a icy pipe.

"Well it's much more- oh, here they come." He said as I heard several footsteps of men behind me, and the thumping of bodies and dirt coming down from the tunnel.

"I'm sorry." Whispered Moritz as I felt the sharp pain of teeth sink into my shoulder and the notices of an ancient chant around me, before it all faded.

"Ugh, where in the hell am I?" I groaned as I tapped my shoulder. "OH WHAT THE HELL! Agh god damn my shoulder hurts, feels like I got bit by a fox holy sh- OH IT'S COLD! I did not even feel that! Agh, where's the light switch I need to turn the lights on-" I said as I tried to move my numb legs.

"There's no light here son, and your not in your room." Said a strange man from behind me.

\*CLANK CLANK, CRACK\*

I felt the clay like substance slip off of my legs, I didn't even know it was there before it was broken off.

"Thank yo-, wait, Mr. Muller? Is that, you? Where are we?" I mumbled as I felt my heart jump back into turbo "Are we in that hole? I thought it was only a dream?" I yelled as I heard the echo bounce off and off and become more mumbled and muffled as it bounced off the leather and ice walls.

"Yes, yes it is. It was not a dream yet I wish it was, but I may ask, have you seen the paintings here?" Muller said, stepping back and forth along the walls.

"I did- wait WHY ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT THE PAINTINGS WE HAVE TO LEAVE?" I shouted in anger as I charged towards him, I grabbed his shirt and yanked him back.

\*Crack!\*

I saw the skeleton of Muller fall down onto my legs, his fingers and limbs bitten and chewed.

"Oh my-" I gasped "What is this? I just heard him, Muller who is this? Where are you? ANSWER ME MULLER!"

But there was nothing, no noise, no nothing. Now here I am, sitting and shriving on this hard cold wall, surrounded by my half eaten dead peers, I hope this will make it to someone, please mom, send this to some more people, please.

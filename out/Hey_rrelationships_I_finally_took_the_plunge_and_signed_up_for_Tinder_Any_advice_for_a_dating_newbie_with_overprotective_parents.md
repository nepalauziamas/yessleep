First of all, let me say that I’m kind of new to reddit. I’m not even completely sure if I’ve formatted this post correctly, or how to post to the right forum, or what. Honestly, I’m just looking for some friendly advice. I can’t talk to anyone I know in “real life” about this (I’ll explain that later), so any help would be appreciated. Apologies in advance for any spelling mistakes, I’m on my phone! 

I got on Tinder about a week after I turned eighteen, so about a month ago. I’ve always been more on the quiet side. No parties or wild nights for me, unless you count that time I fell down the stairs at two in the morning on my way to get a glass of water. So back in June, I officially entered adulthood without having done so much as hold a guy’s hand. Already, there are tons of stereotypes about homeschooled kids - we’re all socially awkward freaks or weirdly religious, according to Mean Girls (I’ve watched clips of it on YouTube!). I’m tired of fulfilling even one of the stereotypes, so I figured it was time for me to enter the dating scene. 

Like I said in the title: I have overprotective parents. They were raised on a diet of Scripture and spirituals, and even though we live in Virginia now (not exactly Bible Belt territory), they’ve raised me like I’m some kind of endangered species. I wasn’t allowed to have a phone until I was sixteen, and even now I can only use it during the “approved” times, which according to my mother are Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Thursdays from 6pm-7pm. I always figured that was normal, but apparently most people have their phone on them 24/7. Then again, a lot of things that seem normal online don’t extend to real life! 

Anyway, it goes without saying that mom and dad don’t know about my being on Tinder. They’ve always said they want me to have a normal life, but when it comes to socializing, they’re like that immovable object the Joker mentioned in The Dark Knight (practically half of that movie is on YouTube). I guess I have it easy compared to my sister, but it’s hard to stop myself from getting restless. I’ve never been to a masked ball, I’ve never ridden across the ocean on a massive boat (never even seen a boat, much less the ocean), I’ve never had someone stand outside my window with a boom-box over his head. I just want to experience the things the rest of the world seems to experience. That’s not unreasonable, is it? 

I’ve spent way too long typing this. My hour is almost up. I’ll save this text in my notes and keep going tomorrow!

Okay, I’m back. My parents think I use my phone to play those educational games they downloaded for me, so they don’t watch me too closely. I’m sitting in the living room now while my mom cooks dinner. I could just go to my room, but there’s not much point since it doesn’t have a door. 

Let’s get back to the whole point of this post: Dating advice! You can probably tell that I’m sheltered and more than a little inexperienced. This might sound a little strange, but I’ve never even left my house! My parents have always told me that they don’t want me exposed to the germs out there until I’m “ready,” which isn’t very specific. They told my sister (older than me by two years) the same thing, but she snuck out every Saturday night anyway. She always asked me to come with her, but I figured the consequences of getting caught wouldn’t be worth it. I was right. 

The reason I’m making this post now is because of Tinder. In the month since I downloaded it, I’ve only swiped right on three guys. The first one was an accident, the second one didn’t swipe right on me, and the third one I’ve been chatting with for the last two weeks. He’s eighteen, too, and his parents are pretty strict as well (but not as strict as mine, since he’s allowed to cut his hair and hang out with other people). He lives within ten miles of me, though he’s not really sure where I live (not surprising; we’re in the middle of the woods and don’t have a real address). He’s incredibly nice and funny, and I think he looks exactly like a younger version of the guy from The Notebook, another movie I saw parts of on YouTube. 

The only problem is, he keeps asking to meet up. I want to meet with him, too, obviously, but I can’t really imagine sneaking out. That’s the kind of thing my sister did, and our parents caught her, just a week after she turned nineteen. They were waiting beneath the window when she dropped out one Saturday night. I was in my room, buried under the covers, and I could still hear her yelling. She shouted my name a few times, but I couldn’t tell if it was out of anger or out of something else. 

My parents showed her to me on the day I turned eighteen, as a reminder to always stay their good little girl. They said they weren’t really worried about me, though. They knew how close I was to my sister, which is why they were so proud that I had told them about her sneaking out. But they wanted to remind me anyways, just in case becoming an adult had given me any “ideas.”

I’m not going to lie: When I first got on Tinder, I thought it would be like in Romeo and Juliet. I would climb out the window and have a romantic rendezvous somewhere in town, then slide back into bed before dawn. Now that it’s actually happening, I’m too nervous to go through with it. Has anyone else ever been in this position? Have you ever wanted something so badly, but once it’s within arm’s reach you can’t bring yourself to grab it? 

I took way too long typing this out. My hour is up again, so I’ll have to finish it up next week, on Tuesday. I don’t even know why I’m putting so much time into this. I guess it’s just a nice thought, that I’m writing something others will actually see. That I’ll be communicating with people outside of this house.

It’s Tuesday! Looks like this post will be both an OP and an update all in one, since a couple important things happened over the last four days. The first thing is that Toby, the guy I’ve been chatting with on Tinder, has told me that he’ll be at a place called Pizza Hut at 1:30pm this Wednesday (so, tomorrow), and that he really hopes I can meet him there. I almost told him no. I actually typed out the word and came so close to sending it... But then I decided to sleep on the decision. He told me this just before my hour was up on Thursday, so I had plenty of time to think it over. My parents were both busy on Saturday - dad working in the backyard, mom quarantined in the laundry room - so I did something I swear I’ve never even thought of doing before: I snuck down to the basement, and I talked to my sister. 

The door wasn’t locked. I almost expected it to be, though there wouldn’t be much point to that, considering how little movement the chains allow her. I’ve never had a problem with the dark; even that Ryan Reynolds movie Buried didn’t scare me. So I didn’t mind that the only light down there came from the single bulb dangling from the ceiling, one that I couldn’t even turn on until I was halfway down the stairs. That’s as far as my parents had taken me on my birthday, just halfway down, not a step farther. The basement is small enough (it’s barely a five by five square) that I could see the entire thing in the glow of that bulb. The dusty cement floor, the damp brick walls, creaking wooden ceiling... I’ve never understood how rats can live down here. I asked my dad that once, and he grumbled that my sister was probably feeding them. I assumed she did it out of kindness, then later realized it might have been pragmatism - the more rats there were, the more she could eat. I had seen the meals my parents would bring her, and couldn’t imagine a single person subsisting on them and nothing else. 

I know you’re probably bored with all these details, so I’ll stop there. The important thing for you to know is that my sister made up my mind: I’m sneaking out to meet with Toby. She told me what the city is like, based on her memories from when she would spend every Saturday night there. She said she wanted me to have that, to have exactly what she’d had. I reminded her that she had been caught. She hadn’t really replied to that, just gave me a strange thin smile and said that she was getting tired and could I please remind mom to bring her dinner tonight. 

The only thing for me to do now is to wait. I’ll post this, hopefully get some good advice (What do people even talk about on dates? The movies never show that), and then post an update tomorrow evening. Sorry if this comes out as a wall of text or something. Like I said, I’m still working out all the kinks of reddit and its system. 

Honestly, I don’t even care if Toby and I talk about the pattern of the wallpaper for two straight hours. I’ll just be glad to have something interesting in my life for once.

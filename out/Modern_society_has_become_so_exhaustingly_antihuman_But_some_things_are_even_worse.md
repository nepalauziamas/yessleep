I had a chance to hurt a lot of people. I almost took it. I’ve been feeling pretty angry, lately. Not at anyone or anything specific, but at the world, at “society”, at how human civilization has seemed to become so...anti-human. Every day I’d wake up and think to myself, “If only I had a little bit of power, if only I could make the world bend to my will—for a day, even. The things I’d do, the changes I’d make...” It’s edgy stuff, I know; and I know everyone at some point has felt similarly, but I couldn’t help but feel that I things were becoming really, *really* bad; that most institutions were existentially counter-productive—intentionally so. As if the guiding philosophy behind every major business and industry was to siphon the life and joy from the consumer, without actually killing them. A never-ending, ever-worsening cycle of assistance, dependence, bitterness, and hopelessness.  

Then, the opportunity came – the chance to truly change the lives of a lot of people, for the worse. I almost took it—almost made a real villain of myself. I’m glad I didn’t, am still terrified of what I might’ve become, of what I would’ve done. I’ll never forget the words that were spoken to me that morning:  

*You can take it all, if you’d like. The world and its light—every last ray of it. Cast the Great Shadow upon it all, and revel in the unceasing night. Life, for you—for everyone--has been so dreadfully boring, so inexpressibly dull. Bleak. Intolerable. Wretched. Why not change things up? Give the people a good dose of despair, and maybe a paragon will rise up to face you. Maybe a greater light will take the place of the dim, pitiful ember struggling against the implacable dark. Or maybe, no one will come—maybe you’ll truly end it all, and endarken this sphere forever. But that’s not for you to worry about—you're merely the spark; and I will be the accelerant. Together, we’ll bring about the only change that really matters, and if they can’t adapt...* 

*Do it, grasp the* ***Odium Stone****, accept the gift, stamp out the pitiful flame.* 

It was a hideous thing, some inhuman extra-terrestrial, once-resident to some far-flung planet beyond our astronomical knowledge. On its home world it had apparently proposed a similar offer to one of its own—an opportunity to shuffle the deck, so to speak. That lonely, hopeless member had accepted, and used the power given to him to unleash global terror and self-propagating vitriol upon his own people. And the offeror, that ***Sower of Calamity***, then took his leave; left the hate-rotted and doom-befallen planet, venturing to some other sphere, to repeat the process.  

It came here, to Earth, and found me. 

It landed in my backyard, its meteoric impact waking me an hour before my alarm could. I crawled out of bed, more despondent than angry, and stumbled toward my back door. Stepping out onto the patio, I was met with a still-smoking crater about the size and depth of a cheap inflatable pool. And in its blackened center, writhing excitedly—having suffered no harm from the unshielded landfall—was that semi-molluscan, half-crustacean visitant from the void. Before I could turn away, or make any sounds of surprise, fright, or alarm, it began to speak; and I was lulled into a state of unfightable receptivity. 

I listened to its words as one under the spell of incantatory lyrics, ensorcelled by the promise of power, of **Change**; the prospect of relief from the mind-numbing, soul-blackening mundanity of modern existence. I was so allured by its words, so captivated, that I ignored the hideousness of its demonian visage; pushed the suggestively Satanic morphology out of my thoughts, and listened only to its words, like a feral imp lulled to placidity by a Hadean lullaby. I didn’t think to wonder at *how* I was comprehending its words, I was only concerned with paying as much attention to them as possible.  

And, as it had bidden me to do in its introductory speech, I touched the tenebrous, tennis ball-sized sphere nestled within the fleshy center of its largely indescribable body. Power then surged within me, an ultra-cosmic vitality: the dark astral mana of Sapient Voids and Eldritch Atmospheres. A smattering of crimson alien glyphs were burned into the interior of the crater upon my contact with the orb, and a stench of molten flesh and volcanic crypts rose to assail my nostrils. I pulled the orb free of its disgusting orifice, and I almost dropped it in a moment of short-lived terror when glassy surface flashed white—as if suddenly becoming immeasurably hot. But this phase of total whiteness lasted only a moment; and in another startling change, the orb began to *sink* to my flesh.  

I watched, in states of both horror and excitement, as my palm absorbed the magical artifact. When it was completely gone I closed my hand, and the alien chirped and caterwauled repellently. The color of the glyphs then changed, becoming pitch-black—as if they’d been seared into earth by some stellar lens. 

And then, as if replacing the world around me—rather than simply exploding into my mind—a vision came: a scene of supreme horror:  

*I was somewhere else, standing on a bleak and barren stretch of land. I felt weak, hot, fatigued beyond sense. A half-remembered horror whittled away at my sanity. Around me was a sweltering desolation, filled with the scorched ruins of unrecognizable structures. There were forms in the distance, vaguely humanoid, though also suggestive of decidedly unhuman existences. They were all static, unmoving despite a horribly persistent wind.*  

*That same wind pushed me onward against my will, and led by it I came upon one of those unusual figures. It was an alien of some kind, or had been, before some cataclysmic event came sweeping through, incinerating everything. Now, it was only a blackened husk—a coal-dark statue to a life I’d never known, but felt a strange, interspecies kinship to.* 

*In the distance, great tempestuous conflagrations raged, towering infernos and spires of ground-attracted lightning. And yet the planet’s sun burned feebly in the sky, as if poisoned. The wind, powerful and howling, beat against my body, and finally I fell to the ground, succumbing to my debility. Above me, the sky yawned a sickly yellow, with fat grey clouds hovering nebulously about. The very atmosphere felt toxic, cancerous....* 

*Some cosmic Holocaust had reduced this world to a state of lifeless desolation, of planetary dereliction, and I was its last surviving member. With one final glimpse toward the red-sunned horizon, I closed my eyes—and a vicarious death took me.*  

And then the vision ended, and my normal sight was returned to me. The horror of that sorrowful scene ebbed away, and in its place came a feeling of supernatural power. 

Thus endowed with the anima of Unreal and Impossible Entities, I rose from the ground, hovering of my own sorcerous volition, and gazed with mounting malignance upon the densely populated neighborhood below me. I envisioned myself reaching sunward, plucking that burning sphere from its perch amidst the heavens, stripping it of its fiery breath, and hurling molten shards of it Earthward. I imagined the fright-filled screams of the masses as a Heat Death of another kind effaced cities, incinerated entire regions; plunged continents into black, magnificent ruin. I entered a reverie of genocide, of planetary unmaking.... 

And I would have done it, could have, had that alien agitator not uttered one final encouraging phrase: *Do it—Annihilate this fragile, perpetually incipient species.”*  

While before I had been wholly enthralled by its auguring of a New Paradigm—albeit an ashen and lightless one—I was not at all amused by its suggestion that the human race was weak and in a state of unending infancy. I did not want to unleash a volcanic apocalypse upon the planet because I thought people were feeble, or worthless, or undeserving of life—no, I wanted only to forcibly initiate *a change;* one that would, for better or worse, put an end to the joyless tedium of post-industrial life.  

I believe the Human race has done many great things, my issue is not with the species—but with what life among it has become. The constant psychological and financial stressors that plague us daily, that wear down our spirits and degrade our conceptions of progress and societal advancement. Many of us flit through life like phantoms, never really enjoying the passing days – simply enduring them. A great tiredness has fallen over the world, and with it—a pervasive spitefulness; born not of any natural animosity towards our fellow man, but of the sheer, awful exhaustion of living under increasingly confrontational circumstances. Pitted against one another by....forces, powers, agencies and parties. Conflict has always existed among the species, but it has now become so crudely and cruelly commonplace... 

So, when this thing spoke ill of my race, my ire and spite were turned away from the people beneath me—residing obliviously (and innocently) within their homes, or driving to their soul-killing jobs—and were refocused onto the alien provocateur.  

I descended to the Earth, pulsing with the power of extra-galactic immensities, and dared it to repeat what it had said about my people. Perhaps mistaking my inquiry for a request of further encouragement, it repeated itself, declaring humans to be the most pathetic creatures it had ever come across. It would’ve said something else, some other baseless offense, but my anger swelled within me at that last denigration, and I used my telekinetic power to crush its slimy throat – cutting off its foul speech. 

I then lifted it up, the whole abominable figure, and plucked away—one by one—its flapping limbs from its shelled yet weirdly ophidian body: eight in total. With my para-causal control of atoms and the elements, I sub-atomically fortified each tentacle, making them perdurable. I did the same to the helpless gimp itself, endowing it with a body wholly invulnerable to physical harm—though I left it with the capacity to feel pain. 

Finally, turning again toward that mighty celestial torch, I flung the odious creature into the surface of the sun. I sent its eight limbs—like great black javelins—in its wake, crucifying it against the super-molten surface.  

And there it *resides to this day, suffering helplessly against that unending outpour of flame.*  

*I will not* be goaded into destroying this planet - I need no devil to whisper into my ear. If the world doesn’t change, I may someday force it to, but not at the insistence of an uninvited third party.

It was december, If you ask me the most beatiful part of the year,
It was almost christmas, Just like every year, My cousin from Italy came to visit for holidays,
As usual, we were lying on the couch, fooling around, making each other laugh. 

We enjoyed remembering those moments when we were kids how we used to jump around the christmas tree, open the gifts, and crash some christmas ornaments.

But suddenly all the fun was ruined by my dog Bart.
We was barking in thee yard like crazy, wasn't stoping  something was onviously happening.

Barking turned into yelping, and then everything became silent, my cousin and I got scared cause we heard footsteps that were approaching towards us, but that was my brother Denis who also heard that something is happening outside the house,

, so he suggested that we should go investigate a little bit, Brother and I slowly sneeked thru the house, because we didn't want to wake up our parents.

 They were sleeping for quite some time.
Our cousin decided to stay in the house.
Hmm, she was probably already under the bed or in the closet, and we tried to be as quiet possible so that no one could hear us.

We slowly opened the door to sneek where is our dog.
Wr have turned each other back so we could keep an rye on each other and have control over thr situation.
As I said we hsve turned back om each othet so we could keep an eye on each other.

We kept watching in order to see our dog, but not a clue.
Everything was ok, until the moment Denis started to callour dogs name out loud.

Than...Everything changed, I could never imagine that I will witness a true horror. The worst nightmare... That became reality, and it was happening in front of our eyes.

So... We were standing in front of the house and after Denis called our dog I could hear him slowly pronouncing my name, At first he whisperef and then slowly started to raise his voice.

At first I thought that he is planning to prank me to scare me butmy curiosity was too big so I turned to see what is he "doing".

I will never forget his face expression, his face was white, eyes wide opem and lips were still pronouncing my name.
I have to admit that I didn't feel good about that but I kept convincing myself that is is just an act and that he wants to scare me.


The look in his eyes was so lost and you could feel the fear, he slowly raised his hand and pointed with a finger to some undefined place and I could not register at first, I kept watching but I didn't see anything, I didn't know where to watch.

And then he whispered that I should look at the bushes.
I keept watching in order to discover which bush is he showing me, because he instantly shup up like he was hypnotized, amd like he cannot talk.

I was watching and watching, but I couldn't see anythind, I was giving my best to see what he was seeing, but ...Nothing caught my eye. 

After all, It was night amd the only light was that one comming from the street lamps.
And just when I wanted to ask him what did he saw that something decided not to hide anymore.

Suddenly, heas appeared from the bush and my body became frozen.

All of this was happeninh for about maybe 15 seconds but for me it was a whole eternity.
First the head came out of the bushes. It was triangle shaped and had some kind of horns or something.

First, that somethimg was looking at us and then a very long arm came out, then one leg and then that something stopped moving and countinued to look at us.

And again, slowly started approaching us.
It was moving very strange.

It looked like those movements were digitalized kinda elastic... I can't describe it, adrenaline hit me and I wanted to scream and Denis looked hypnotizef, he looked at is so calm and on the other hand so scared.
So I didn't know what's happening.

That creature was closer every second and Denis did not move at all.

I started to scream his name and "Go into the house", "hurry into the house", he just replied "Wait".
Now that creature was just standing and looking at us, it wad probably around 60 feet from us, I started to scream, grab my brothers arm,

 so we both ran into tye house and lock the doors.
As we locked the doors we started to scream, cause we wanted to wake up everyone.

Parebts woke up shocked and didn't have a clue what is happening, our cousim came also, she was terrified.

Nobody had a clue what is happening so brother and I started to talk like crazy about what we just saw.
They were in shock and dad wantes to go check out what was that thing, but we didn't let him.

We knew that creature us in front of the housd.
Mom and Cousin were creeped out and dad became kinda sceptical about it, First we told him we just saw and on the other hand we didn't let him go to check what that it.

He took two pieces of paper and ask us to come, he gave me and brother a piece of paper and told us everyone should draw what he saw, but we need to be in a separate rooms.

I went to living room and brother stayed in the kitchen.
Dad was waiting for the results.
So we were in a separate rooms drawing what we saw and when we here finished we could not wait to show them out drawings.

I was interested what Denis draw, As he also was intetested in my drawing.

We were curious so we decided to show drawings at the same time, and when we finaly showed what we draw, we were all in shock, our drawings were exactly the same.

Our parents thought that it was all planned, because it is not possible to have exactly the same drawings, so they went to bed.

And brother, cousin and I stayed awake to once again discuss what we saw outside the house.
We could not sleep because we know that the creature saw where we live,

 so now it waits for us to go sleep so it can attack.
Morning showed up, and we were so tiree because of the fear and anticipation, so we all fell asleep.
When we woke up we started to talk that same story again and again.

But now they were lauging at us cause they were sure we imagined it all. 
They said it was probably a tree or a shadow, so we thought it was hand and leg,

 brother and I just looked at each other and we were so angry cause no one believes us.

We both think thay two people cannot imagine exact same creature, but we gave up and went to check it on google, we searched for all kind of simialar stuff,

 and we found a picture that was the closest to what we saw, that something was called "Drekavac", so we decided to name it "Drekavac".

And now I will be honest with you.
Today I think that was something else, something much  greater.
The worst of all is, the creature is still out there and Im sure that is it not alone.

And the question is,
Is it something that acts frendly or it thinks we are food?

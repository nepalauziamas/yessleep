I was on my phone scrolling through my crush's pictures on Instagram. Now don't think I'm a pervert or something it's just I like her and i don't have the courage to talk to her.

All of a sudden my older brother Rick came in "Hey, I'm going out you want to come with me". I told him no and went back to scrolling through my crush's Instagram. All of a sudden my brother grabbed my phone out of my hand "Who's this?"

"Dude, give me that back" I tried grabbing my phone back but my brother kept shoving me back. My brother then tossed my phone back to me. "So who's your girlfriend" he was pissing me off right now so I punched his arm.

"Come on man I'm just playing with you" I didn't care at that point and told him not to tell anyone. "Come on man you can trust me, here how about you come to this party I'm going to later" I didn't want to but after begging I agreed.

"Where is this party going to be anyway".

"Just at a friend's house" I wasn't too sure about it mostly because I don't like parties. I'm pretty much the quiet kid in school, so this was going to be new for me.

30 minutes later, my brother told me it was time to get going. We then got into his old busted-up car which shouldn't be legal to even drive on the road. I never trusted being in that car, but it was the only way to get to the party, so we got in a drove off.

The whole ride was quiet until my brother's phone started ringing. He pulled it out and started talking to whoever was on the other side. "Yeah, don't worry where on our way, and yes I got him to come with me".

I was confused about why they wanted to know if I was coming and started to worry about what was going to happen? 

" Who was that calling you"

"Just my girlfriend Trinity"

Trinity was a crazy girl who believed in all that ritual stuff and that old sacrifice shit. I never really liked her or how she was dating my brother. All of a sudden we started to go on a dirt road in the middle of nowhere, and I started to worry.

I looked over at my brother "Why are we going out this way?" My brother didn't say anything he just kept driving, and I started to worry. We eventually reached a house that looked abandoned my brother pulled up in front and looked at me. "We're here".

"I'm not getting out I don't trust being here" my brother tried getting me to go in, but I refused to even get out. My brother then grabbed my phone and took off into the house. "Son of a bitch" I got out and ran after him into the house and the moment I got in there I noticed there was now one.

Not even my brother I called out but got no response ,so I walked around thinking it was a prank. Until I noticed the basement ,so I walked down thinking everyone was down there. It was dark, and I could see anything I was about to leave until something hit my head hard. I hit the ground and ended up backing out.

I woke up, and my head was hurting, and I realized I couldn't move I then realized I was tied up. So I looked around and saw people standing around me in red robes, I was confused until I noticed one was my brother.

I then noticed the candles all around me and a person then stood in front of me, it was Trinity my brother's girlfriend. Now I was even more freaked out "Brothers and Sisters we are gathered today as this boy's sacrifice shall help us because immortal".

My brother was a part of a fucking cult he got me to come here to kill me for this damn ritual "What the fuck Rick I'm your god-damn brother and your going to let them kill me!" He just stared at me in silence as Trinity went on "Don't worry your death shall be quick and painless" I then noticed she had a knife.

Before she could do anything I went to kick her but ended up kicking a candle. It fell over and caught her robe on fire and when she noticed she started to scream. Everyone went to help but nocked over more candles which started to burn.

I struggled but eventually got up with my hands tied behind my back and booked it up the stairs. I heard someone scream after me, but I kept running and got out of there. I just kept running until I reached a gas station and begged for them to call the cops.

They untied me and tried calming me down but I begged for them to call the cops which they eventually did, and when they finally did I told them everything. They sent a squad down there and they said the place caught fire and when firefighters came down they found no one.

My parents finally came and got me from the station and after hearing about Rick they freaked out. Trinity had made him join her cult and now he was out there somewhere.

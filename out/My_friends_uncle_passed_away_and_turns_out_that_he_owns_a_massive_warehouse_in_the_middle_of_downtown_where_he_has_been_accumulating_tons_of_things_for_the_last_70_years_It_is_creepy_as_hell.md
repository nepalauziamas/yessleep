Hello everyone, I'll update this as we go along.

When we were informed of the warehouse, I was asked to come and have a look to see if I'd have any interest in renting out some of the space for my band as a rehearsal area. 

We're a local award winning indie band ([shameless self plug](https://rousetheboroughs.bandcamp.com/)) , sometimes we have upwards of 10 musicians playing with us so it seemed like a dream come true and being that any space is going for a premium right now, I thought ... oh well ... why the hell not. 

Last week he had a janitor come in to at least get the floors cleaned, I hired a crew that does car dealerships as they work at night and they are used to big spaces but they reported two things.

1 - The space had clearly been occupied recently for something, they are convinced someone was coming in to maintain it a bit.
2 - While they were cleaning they felt like they were being watched but reported that there are probably birds or other small animals living inside. 
 
I walked in yesterday with my cousin to have a look, it was the first time he had ever been here, the locks needed some lubrification to get opened, janitor had the same issue, this had clearly been a factory at some point, I started with the ground floor and ... well this place seemed to go on for miles ... to say it's huge is an understatement, [it's massive](https://imgur.com/a/iwmRJa5). 

It was a few minutes in where something weird happened, it's sweltering outside and inside, there is obviously no AC to speak but, the best way I could explain it, it's as if a block of cold air passed right through me, I felt it like a draught passing through the room. every single door handle freezing as if it had been put in a cooler. 

Several doors were locked but we had brought pliers to snap some locks open, there is a freight elevator but it wasn't functional, we ended up finding a staircase to the bottom floor, what we saw was really unexpected, a [locker room](https://imgur.com/a/fnT2cAz), abandoned for god knows how long, a lot more locked doors and accesses including a few [condemned ones leading to different areas](https://i.imgur.com/X1uOZYY.jpg). 

Some locks were too thick for our pliers so we gave up on them. 

On our way back up, the same weird cold draught hit us and I decided we needed to track it down, if there was a spot exposed to the elements or unsecured there is no way I would bring instruments into this place that could cause a theft. 

We pushed to force open one of the condemned stairways, we legit just wanted to know what was on the other side, this spot had been condemned for a long time so whatever was behind it was the mystery motherload for us. 

I'll update this post once we're through, it should be later on today.

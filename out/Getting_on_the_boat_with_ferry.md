Okay, I’ll admit I’m a bit of a junkie but I swear what I say wasn’t a drug induced hallucination or psychosis. FUCK MAN even with 3 Oxy’s and 2 Xanax I can’t get this out of my head! That day started normal until I got a message from Rey. A little background on him, he’s an even bigger druggie than me, you can tell him something has a 80% chance of killing you and a 20% chance of giving you a good high and he’ll take that gamble fucking Rey man. Us together usually means trouble for everyone else because we’ll be high off our asses… usually.

FUCK ME I NEED ANOTHER XANAX HOLD UP! … okay it’s kicked in I’m ready to continue. That day the text he sent me excitedly had said he had met another user who connected him with a new dealer who had a new exclusive RC. He said he got good with the guy and was finally able to set up a meeting for us to try this new RC. I thought about it and looked at my stash of adderall and Oxys and saw it was low so I decided to go along with it and figured if anything it would be a fun trip and at best a great new high and substance. I decided I would be down to try whatever this mysterious dealer gave us I guess I was feeling adventurous. At that point I would try anything that would change my mind state especially if it included euphoria. 

I’ve tried it all, from weed, to heroin, heck I even did mescaline and ayahuasca at the same time at a rave. I thought I was ready for whatever this RC would do if it would even do anything. I texted Rey that since it was his idea he was driving and within 15 minutes I was in the car with him heading to the spot. On the way there I took 45mg’s of addy for some fun which probably ended up saving my life. It was a surprisingly long drive way out in the middle of no where if I had to guess it was a 45-1hr drive because the adderall had kicked in by then and was kicking my ass. The house looked broken down and abandoned like no one lived there with a weird old wooden boat hitched to a truck. The lawn was unkept and the house just generally looked broken down and that’s coming from a druggie. 

I was hesitant but Rey said it was good so I stayed and Rey sent a text and shortly after this lanky tall man came out to greet us. Dude was weird from the start, hardly ever blinking, ignoring a majority of our questions. Finally Rey asked if we could try the RC and the man started walking inside the house motioning us to follow. Now look I know your probably saying there was a million red flags and I should’ve left right away but when your a druggie like me you go to shady spots without thinking because it could lead to an amazing high. 

We finally get inside and this dude pulls out 4 capsules with liquid in them and have two to each of us. For some reason I had a bad feeling in my stomach not from the adderall and surprisingly I was hesitant to take the pills which I never am. Rey happily took the two and while the man was watching Rey take the two I put one in my pocket and acted like I took both. For some reason when we took them the dude seemed to get more excited and some how more hungry? 

While we’re waiting for it to kick in we try as much small talk as we can since the man seems to randomly stare off and when he does he seems to not see us. We finally got his name which he said is “Charon”. Mr. “Charon” starts going on about how he calls the RC “ferry” and when you took the “ferry” you “got on the boat with it”. Weird as fuck but free drugs so I wasn’t about to judge I guess the free drugs should’ve been the biggest red flag to leave no one gives free drugs. Finally it’s been around 40 minutes and I can feel the drug kicking in. 

I feel myself getting a sense of euphoria and get more and more sedated as the minutes pass by. 20 more minutes and I’m nodding off and only waking up because of the adderall which is fighting the sedation of the RC drug but the euphoria felt so good. I glance at Rey and immediately notice something is very wrong, his eyes were completely rolled back and he was dripping this glowing whitish bluish liquid from his mouth. I nodded out again and when I would I would have the same dream of being on the shore of a beach and a man in a boat on the water calling me over which oddly felt calming, peaceful, and euphoric.

BOOM! Suddenly I’m awake again but this time Rey looks full on limp and the “glowing stuff”
Is now flowing heavily from his mouth and “charon” is collecting it in a large mason jar occasionally taking a gulp directly from the source. I tried to move or scream or do anything to possibly help but it was like I was paralyzed besides my eyes. I don’t know how but it seemed like he knew because he immediately turned around and rushed to me in my face, I could sense the rage and disgust within him. Something else was wrong though. He looked extremely old and like he belonged in the Nordic times, he wasn’t the young guy we first met. He went and got a needle filled with a liquid and he injected me with it and within seconds I was out like a light having sweet dreams about being in a boat with a man in a beautiful ocean heading to a beautiful place I can’t remember for the life of me.

I woke up in a daze somehow in my bed. I blew up Rey’s phone for atleast an hour before I decided to drive to the house and ask where Rey is, NO, demand to know where he is. As cliche as it is everything was gone and the house was truly abandoned. I went inside and it was empty and graffiti all over the walls. Dust was everywhere and it looked like it hadn’t been disturbed in years with that old musty smell you get from old abandoned houses. 

That was 4 months ago, the police gave up on finding Rey quickly saying he probably left to find more drugs somewhere, they excused my story as a druggies drug induced hallucination. Secretly I knew Rey was gone and I knew “Charon” and his “ferry” RC pills took Rey when he “got on the boat”. I also knew I would be gone too if I took both pills and didn’t have the adderall in my system. 

Here’s the thing that scares me. It felt so much better than heroin, oxy,  morphine, Xanax, Molly, dilaudid, fentanyl, it was so much better than any of those substances. It was pure peace and bliss with no side effects. The part that truly terrifies me? I can’t stop craving for more “ferry” the pill I stored mysteriously disappeared. The hunt for “ferry” has taken over my life. My only purpose in life now is to “get on the boat” with the “ferry”.

“I can’t believe you’re almost twelve years old,” Mr. Schmerz said as he closed the classroom door. He looked at me for a long time without turning away. “It’s hard to think about the fact that I won’t see you every day anymore.”

I looked around at the classroom that had been a second home for almost a year. Banners that read “Congrats 5th Grade Grads!” hung from the ceiling and lay across storage boxes. 

“We’ll miss you, Mr. Schmerz,” I answered. “But my mom and dad expect me home soon.”

He stepped away from the door and walked towards me. “They know that the class president has to help put away decorations, even if it’s the last day of school,” he answered. His voice sounded funny. 

“Okay, but everything is almost done. We shouldn’t have waited until you and I were the only ones left in the classroom, because other people could have helped us.”

Mr. Schmerz stopped next to me. He didn’t touch the decorations. “I can’t believe that this is the last time I’ll see you,” he said in that same strange voice. 

Then he reached out and touched my hair. My heart beat faster. I felt sick. “I don’t like this,” I said quietly without looking at him. 

He didn’t say anything. Instead, he moved closer. My stomach had the beginning feelings of being sick, like a matchstick that flared up before lighting a campfire. 

“Please let go of my hair,” I answered. I was afraid to stay next to him. I was afraid to step away. He smelled like the time when I threw a ball in the dining room and knocked over a bottle that Daddy kept on the shelf. 

He smiled.

“Please don’t make me feel funny. I don’t like what’s inside of me.” I spoke faster, like I was about to throw up and had to get out all the words. “The world is a nicer place when we keep certain things inside.” 

His smile got even bigger, because he was taking happiness from me. “You have no idea, Emily. That’s why you need a teacher.”

The darkness ran through me, and I was sick, entirely sick, and I couldn’t keep it from spilling out my throat. It burned as it left. “Wrong person,” my mouth said in a voice that wasn’t mine. “Emily’s away now.”

Mr. Schmerz looked unhappy for the first time. “What the fuck are you saying, Emily?” 

The darkness ran through me, cutting off the world and chilling every part of my body like the time I fell into a pool with all my clothes on. “I’m Mastema.”

We don’t question how strange it is to wake up. Our minds are in one place, and then they’re in another. The time between going to bed and waking up is gone.

I’ve learned not to question how strange it is when Mastema releases me. The only difference between that and sleeping is I always wake up in the same place I went to bed. Besides, I’ve found that I scare people when I ask questions, so I try not to ask any.

I was in my bedroom. I think it was the same day, but I didn’t know how much time had passed. I decided to check the clock in my kitchen.

My bedroom door squeaked, so I opened it slowly. I learned long ago that it’s better not to draw attention when I’m not sure who might be nearby. Stepping quietly toward the kitchen, I stopped myself just before going inside.

The door was closed. My kitchen door was *never* closed.

Heart pounding, I put my ear to the wooden frame and listened. My parents were talking; I could tell that they were scared. Daddy raises his voice without realizing it when he’s scared, and Mommy gets real quiet.

I put my eye against the crack to see the clock on the wall. Three hours had passed; it was 5:19.

“Thirteen times this has happened now, Adrianna. Emily comes home with that strange look on her face and doesn’t say a damn word. Thank God she’s safe, but *every* fucking time there’s a disaster that she just missed! I’m going to have a fucking heart attack!”

Daddy doesn’t like it when other people swear, because I don’t think he realizes how much he swears.

“I don’t know, Len,” Mommy answered. She sounded like she’d lost something important. “There’s nothing we can tell a doctor. She isn’t sick.”

They were quiet for a few seconds. Daddy doesn’t like it when things are quiet and he is angry. 

“Maybe it’s time to call Father Clement,” Mommy said.

Daddy stayed quiet, which was confusing, because I knew that he was angry. 

“Do you have another suggestion?” she asked, her voice shaking. “Explain how else Mr. Schmerz got his dick *and* his balls ripped off, Len.”

I stepped away from the door. Daddy swears all the time, but Mommy only says words like that when things get really bad. I decided to go back to my room and pretend that nothing happened, because grownups usually don’t realize how much kids see and understand.

My head got cold as Mastema crawled through my neck and whispered into my ear from the inside:

“Don’t worry, your teacher won’t fuck with [anyone ever again](https://www.reddit.com/r/ByfelsDisciple/).”

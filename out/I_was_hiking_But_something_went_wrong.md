The day was going well. I was hiking with a friend. We made a fire, ate, and went to sleep. I woke up because I had to pee. I see a human-looking thing in the dark forest. I decided it was nothing. And I just should go to sleep. I wake up from something walking around my tent. The person is talking with a friend. He is saying, what should I do with the body though. I hope is just my friend. That is pranking me. I check my heartbeat per minute. Is 178 bpm. I am getting more and more scared. I open my tent and tell the person to fuck off. Person holds my throat. And he takes out his gun. And tells me to sit down. Warns me if I donâ€™t shut up. He is going to kill me. Get inside your fucking tent. You mother fucking bitch. 

I follow his orders. I tell my friend what happened. She is stunned by what happened. She tells me that the same thing happened to her. We decided to take a walk around the place. To clear our heads. When we come back. We see a person lurking around my tent. Both of us get scared. The person sees us. He is walking towards us. We turn around and run. I was holding back tears. And then everything goes black. 

I wake up. Everything is black. I started screaming. A man comes and holds my mouth. And tell me to shut up. He is the same person that woke me up last night. I tell him. Why did you wake me up? He answered: because I can. I can get my hand out of the ducktape. I slap him as hard as I can. He passes away. I ran towards the door. And there I see my friend. Daisy. I get the duck tape off her hands. A person is preventing us from getting out. He takes out his gun and tells us to get on the ground. As he says that the police storm the area. They scream to get on the ground. And shut up. I follow the orders. 

The person told me to get up. A person screams what the fuck. A person with a suit gets out of a room. He is carrying an AK-47. He lifts me. And tells me to protect him from bullets. Daisy starts crying. She gets shot in the same second as she cries. He walks into the hall where there are 28 active shooters. He gets assassinated 5 people. He gets assassinated after he gets near a police officer. I start running towards an officer. I ask for a gun. I killed 5 individuals. In a matter of minutes. Gangsters start surrendering after they were outnumbered. One of them tried to shoot. When everyone put their guns down. He was killed by a nearby person. An ambulance was called for Daisy. She survived the gunshot in the head

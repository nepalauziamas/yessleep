We’re not okay.

My husband and I live in Texas. Won’t say which city.

A couple weeks ago, on a Sunday, I woke up in the middle of the night needing a drink of water. I got up to get some, and as I stood over the sink, cup in hand, I both saw and heard a truck rumble by. It was moving slow, and the red brake lights brightened up as they passed our house. They slowed down to nearly a crawl. I could see the light of a phone screen illuminating some guy’s face in the passenger seat, and the driver’s face was partially lit to where I could see him looking as well.

Thoroughly creeped out, I moved to the side of the window and peered around a corner. This window didn’t have blinds on it, so I had no way to watch in secret without moving to another room. But hiif I moved to another room, I worried I would miss their license plate so I could write it down.

My husband has instilled quite the self-defense mentality in me. Especially with a baby on the way.

I waited for their car to move on, and recited the license plate to myself over and over until I could get to my phone in the bedroom and write it down. I covered the screen so I wouldn’t wake Brian.

I double checked that all the doors and windows were locked, then crawled back into bed. It took me a while to get back to sleep because of the adrenaline.

&nbsp;

I told Brian about it in the morning, and he was mad I didn’t wake him. But, of course, he probably would have grumbled if I *had* woken him up, so there wasn’t a way to win.

Regardless, he decided to stay up the next night, a Monday night, to stake things out. We agreed that we wouldn’t call the police unless they showed up a second time.

We went about our normal days, both went to work, came home, had dinner, watched some Netflix, and night came around. Brian sat in the front room, nestled in with a book next to a window with a street light. I’d told him how loud the truck was, so he figured he could just listen for it if they came by again.

I went to bed, even though I had trouble sleeping while wondering if they would drive by again and if they would do more than that.

&nbsp;

That morning, Brian told me that the truck hadn’t returned. 

I was relieved, and so was he. 

I had a day off, so he went to work and I did some chores around the house. I was going out to check the mail after lunch when I noticed a car I didn’t recognize sitting in front of a neighbor’s house. The car was off, but two people were sitting inside.

As I got up to the mailbox, I could see that they were talking and pointing at something in their laps. There was no way I could see what they were doing without getting closer, but my suspicions were raised anyway.

I called Brian, and he came home as soon as he could. Through the window, I checked on them every few minutes. They remained parked. 

Brian came home and took over watching our potential stalkers.

I asked if we should call the cops, but all Brian replied was “not yet.” It wasn’t the same truck, he reasoned, so we could just be making bad connections to the events.

Honestly, even looking back, I agree with his decision. We didn’t *know* anything. We just had some slight suspicions that might not mean anything. We had no way of knowing what was going to happen.

Eventually, they did leave. They drove off without us even noticing. One moment, we had checked out the window and the next they were gone.

I was again relieved. I thought we had made a mistake, I was *glad* we hadn’t called the cops over something so mundane.

&nbsp;

Over the next few days, I swore I caught sight of the same car or same people in different cars. It was such a weird feeling to get almost deja vu as you recognized someone driving, but in a different car than you had last seen them.

And the weirder part was the cars seemed to be on a rotation. Silver Honda, Ford truck, white work van, black Honda. Over and over, mixed and matched with drivers and order of appearance.

Once I thought I saw one of the cars pass by my work, but I doubted it almost immediately.

When I told Brian the pattern, he started to notice it too.

“I’m calling the cops,” he finally decided after watching the pattern for a week. They weren’t there every day, that we could tell, although we did have to work. 

&nbsp;

A patrol car pulled up behind the car while we were both home from work. One walked up to their car, and the other came to our front door.

I wasn’t happy about that, because it felt like tattling. 

*Here’s the people that called us on you, it’s their fault!* is what it felt like they were saying.

Brian answered the door at my request, and told the story. The officer noted everything down. I piped up from the living room when I needed to, but mostly I just stayed in the house. I tried to pay attention to the cop talking to the car’s occupants.

There wasn’t much I could glean from this far away except one thing. 

The two of them shook hands with the cop at the end.

The second officer sauntered back up to our door and gave his report.

The two were locals, they took this route to work and took their lunch breaks in the car there. They “didn’t think it would be a problem” and agreed to park somewhere else.

With that, the two officers wished us a good day and left.

Maybe I just couldn’t accept such a mundane explanation, but that handshake at the end infuriated me. For over a week I’d worried about them, but with a handshake it was all pushed under the rug.

I was *convinced* they were staking out our house, or one of our neighbor’s houses. I just couldn’t prove it.

Brian tried to sympathize, but I could tell he thought it was completely over and felt a little embarrassed at the decision to call the cops.

&nbsp;

One of the cars in the pattern drove by a few days later, and that set me on edge again. Brian was no help, convinced I had seen some other car, so I went to go grocery shopping on my own. He was pissing me off.

In the car, on my way to the store, Brian called my phone.

“They f\*\*\*ing *followed you*,” he said, out of breath.

My throat swelled up and I glanced in the rear-view mirror. I thought I could see one of the cars from the pattern, but they were two or three cars behind me. Was that them? Or coincidence?

 “I’m getting in the car and following too, but I need you to go to the police station and pull into their parking lot,” Brian explained. I could hear the sounds in the background confirming his words. The door slamming shut, the car starting.

I tried to think of where the police station was, and I told Brian as much. He reminded me of the maps app on my phone. Of course.

“When you get there, lock the doors and call 911 to tell them where you are. I’m coming right behind you.”

When we stopped the call, I tried to simultaneously drive and search for the police station address. My hands were shaking so hard I dropped my phone into my lap several times. I couldn’t do it. I started to tear up and hyperventilate.

Siri managed to pop up, interrupting my progress, and I tried to say “Siri, take me to the closest police station,” but I was crying so hard Siri couldn’t understand me.

That’s when a car had to swerve out of my way, blasting their horn the whole time. I knew I had to get off the road before I got in a wreck. That would be so much worse.

I ended up pulling into a Target and literally parked the car in the crosswalk in front of the doors. I didn’t want to park and have other parked cars block line of sight if they came up to my window. I was convinced now that these were my stalkers, they wanted to hurt me, and they were willing to do it in public.

Hands still trembling, I pulled out my phone and dialled Brian’s phone, to tell him where I’d parked so he could come get me.

The car I saw earlier entered the parking lot, and I froze. The phone was still ringing.

Someone honked at me, demanding that I move out of the way. I didn’t. 

“Are you there? What’s happening?” Brian asked, voice so quiet it sounded like it was coming from far away.

“I’m at Target,” I whispered, as if I was being sneaky. “Come quick, please, hurry.”

He kept talking, but my attention was drawn outside the car.

The car stalking me swung past, around my non-parking job, and swerved to block me in. The car behind me began trying to go around, but didn’t have enough room. I was fully boxed in. 

Two burly guys got out of the car in front of me. They were obviously staring at me. One of them pointed, and I flinched as if they’d taken a swing at me.

They marched up to my car and signaled for me to roll down the window.

I was right. They had no compunction about a public altercation. They didn’t give a shit.

My head was shaking, telling them that I refused to roll down my window. Brian was shouting into the phone, asking where I was and what was happening. I managed to utter that they were at my window, and I could hear him cursing.

I tried to put the car into drive and go around their car to leave, but one of them jumped in front and slammed his hands on the hood, shaking his head “no”.

Not wanting to get arrested for running a guy over with my car, I didn’t slam on the gas like I wanted to.

Finally, the guy next to my window pounded on it with a fist.

“Open your f\*\*\*ing window!!” He screamed, voice slightly muffled.

I still didn’t obey, so he growled—literally growled—and started shouting at me through the window.

“You called the cops on us, you f\*\*\*\*ing b\*\*\*\*!! It’s our *right* to follow you \*\*\*\*s around and make sure you don’t get an abortion! You can’t f\*\*\*\*ing stop us! I’m gonna sue you for trying to block our investigation! You’re not gonna kill babies on our watch you f\*\*\*\*ing \*\*\*\*!!”

He went on a complete tirade, people were stopping to watch the shouting. I just kept leaning further and further away from him, no where else to go.

Brian showed up unfortunately too late to prevent the confrontation. I watched him come running up to the guy and start shouting him down. I wish he’d tackled him instead. They got in a shouting match, with the other guy joining in from the front of my car.

The guy by my window took the first swing. He missed, but Brian took the opportunity to rush the guy, and they fell to the asphalt, grappling each other and wrestling for control. The guy in front of my car looked like he was hesitant to join in, but he yelled encouraging words to his buddy.

That’s when the cops rolled up. Some pedestrian must have called them or Brian had before he arrived. I was worried the cops would tase Brian for fighting, but they managed to break up the fight without weapons. 

The cops separated everyone, moved everyone’s cars to parking stalls, and talked to everyone individually.

I was bawling uncontrollably by that point, and the cop was getting frustrated with me while we talked.

At the end, they arrested both Brian and the guy who had been wrestling with him. I was furious, but I know better than to scream at injustice anymore. The guy who didn’t get arrested looked smug and shot me a threatening look as he left. Not that a police officer would take that into account.

I parked Brian’s car better, since he’d jumped out to rush over. Then I took my car to the police station, which I had to look up how to do, so I could figure out if I needed to pay bail or what.

&nbsp;

We’ve since talked to a lawyer. Brian is out on bail, which he helped with. The moment we got home, someone was on our doorstep. They served Brian with a civil lawsuit from the guy who he was fighting with. 

We read over the papers and couldn’t believe what we were reading. We didn’t think such a thing would even be *legal.* There was just no way, we *had* to be misunderstanding it.

We showed the papers to our lawyer and he explained it. Our initial reading wasn’t wrong.

The guy is suing us as aiding and abetting abortion providers by stopping him from being able to watch for abortions being conducted. You know, because he *we* got *him* arrested. He’s claiming that his time in jail and the assault are making it possible for abortions to be done that he *would have* been able to prevent if he were able to continue his “duties.”

And, as the lawyer has explained, we *have* to answer or we forfeit the lawsuit. That means court fees, lawyer fees, time spent with a lawyer discussing details, just a massive investment of time and money. All because this guy decided it was his “duty” to harass pregnant women and make sure they didn’t have an abortion or else he could collect a bounty for anyone who helped them.

&nbsp;

In the course of talking through all this with the lawyer, he asked if he could ask a very, very personal question. He asked me directly, not Brian. I told him he could.

He asked me if I was pregnant or expecting.

Before I could react, he added more. He also asked if I had received an email from any of our medical providers about our medical records being disclosed or stolen. The question was out of the blue and seemed completely unrelated to our case, but I answered honestly.

It was yes to both. I’m three months pregnant, and my OB/GYN sent me an email talking about exactly that situation.

Our lawyer asked me to pull up the email on my phone and show him, if I could find it. I did as he asked, and he skimmed it.

A month before this all started, I got an email and automated phone message from our OB/GYN office. They were reporting to us that our medical information may have been “involuntarily disclosed” because their building was broken into and their office was ransacked. Their file cabinets with medical records were broken open and dug through, and some records were missing. Several computers had also been stolen. The email and phone message said they were still working on figuring out whose records were stolen, but under HIPAA they had to report it to all their clients regardless.

The email outlined the other steps they were going through and said they were working with the federal government, state government, and other medical facilities to get everything sorted out. They even recommended that I move to a different OB/GYN, which I did.hi

I’ll never get over the pit in my stomach as our lawyer let out a heavy sigh and set his glasses on the table, shaking his head. 

Unofficial rumor from the county and state prosecutors, according to him, is that gangs of people have been breaking into medical facilities either with force or covertly and copying or stealing medical data on current pregnancies.

When our lawyer heard that rumor, he followed the trail of logic tying it to that recent law passed in our state. You know, the one where abortions are essentially banned in Texas? Hit national media? Made me question if I wanted to leave Texas for the first time in my life? That one.

The logic, according to him, would be to find people who know they are pregnant and in the early stages and follow them to try and catch them in the act of getting an abortion. Then sue everyone who was even remotely connected to that abortion. He and some other lawyers have already discussed this situation and are starting to see signs.

So far, we’re the fourth actual case he’s heard of so far that could be related to these rumors. The symptoms were the same. Stalking, harassment, an inevitable altercation, everything.

It has yet to hit the main press yet, but local news is starting to catch on. We’re right at the front of it. It hasn’t hit the state or national spotlight yet.

They’re clearly getting addresses for people to follow and make sure they don’t get abortions. That much is clear to me.

What my lawyer is worried about, and I don’t think he should have told me this because I’ve been basically hyperventilating ever since, is that this is an organized, concerted effort. The fact that we got served with a lawsuit the *day* after bail was paid means someone *other* than that guy was preparing it. The names on the lawsuit confirm that. There are six people named on our lawsuit.

And our lawyer checked. Seven other lawsuits have already been filed with their names. It’s just the start. The start of an avalanche about to terrorize a *lot* of people.

Is this where we are now? Is this it? What is starting?

I’m angry. I’m tired. I’m livid. I’m scared. I’m exhausted. I’m worried. I’m horrified.

This is where we live now? A place where things like this can happen to anyone? Where people who are so emboldened by their self-righteousness can inflict emotional, psychological, financial damage on someone?

The story ‘ranger…ranger’ takes place in a national park in USA…the park was very popular in the 90s but has been shut down due to many disappearances. Between ‘94 and ‘98 21 children and 17 adults disappeared…the US GOV blamed the disappearance on wild life and shut it down. The park wasn’t active until 2004 when people went there to see the urban legend. Since then 6 more deaths have occurred. In 2006 the US GOV formed an special division…the paranormal division, its main goal being understanding and researching the sick things that go on in that park. 

Very soon they discovered what it was…the walkers…creatures that in their base form looked like tall humanoids that have been severally dehydrated and starved. They can kill a person and use their corpse as a vessel. They are masters of imitating human speech and understanding the English language. That’s why members of the PD made a code before every call to confirm the person they are talking to is a human. ‘Ranger *2 second pause* Ranger’ 
The person on the receiving confirms their humanity by saying ‘Ranger ranger confirmed ranger ranger’
‘Ranger…Ranger’

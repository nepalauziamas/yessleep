I have no time for punctuation, so my apologies for the lack of them, i don’t know how to even start this and no one will believe me. I’ve tried everyone, mom dad brother, i even told my grandma for Gods sake. No one will believe me, I thought maybe this community would be more accepting of my current ‘situation’.


I think I should start by introducing myself; I’m James (fake name) and I’m a 22 year old male. 

I live in a dorm in uni and I have my roommate Liv (also fake name) who is 21 years old and a female. She had some strange habits which I choose to ignore most of the time, but 3 days ago was my last straw. This may be controversial but-although I feel guilty for saying so- she stinks, like everything about her stinks, her clothes, her hair, her sheets, even the fridge gets smelly right after she touches it , and what’s odd about this smell is that it isn’t you’re average sweaty-after-the-gym kind of sweaty, it’s a consistent-even after she showers- smell of sweat and rotting meat and bad breathe all combined and it never goes away, ever. What was weird was that she didn’t always smell like this, it was just sudden, woke up one day and bam she stinks.


It feels rude of me to tell her this so I keep it to myslef mostly, but she’s a very touchy women and it bothers me because whenever we are both in the dorm, she never misses the chance to share her putrid stench with me. Two weeks ago it got so bad I snapped, i said “Cant you understand the basics of human decency? I said you standing so close is making me uncomfortable and you won’t stop it, don’t make me do something I don’t want to do!” And she obliged, for two days.

After that she started staring at me, just staring, and it’s not an overly-exaggerated creepy stare with a grin and all, it’s just.. there. She stares right through me, I tried to justify it the first few times, but it kept getting weirder, she would twitch sometimes while staring, over time a grin started to appear, although subtle, it was still there, noticeable. I couldn’t confront her about it because it would just be unfair, I mean in what world was I allowed to tell her to stop twitching or smiling or staring, it just seemed unreasonable. 

Sometimes she would start humming to the song ‘it’s over’ by patti la salle. But it wouldn’t stop, it kept going, over and over and over, three days ago was when I snapped again, I got up at 2 am to get a snack and there she was, in the kitchen at 2 in the morning, and she was humming again, that same song, her head turned all the way to face me, she was staring the same way she always did, this time more intense, the more I looked, the more aggressive the humming got, her eyes looked as if they were about to bulge out of their sockets and they where as red as I’d ever seen them, there was no justifying it, something was seriously wrong, she used to talk a lot and after I yelled at her she just stopped talking all together. “Liv..?”I managed to say, “What’s happening?” Her humming hot so loud I could barley hear myself. A moment after I finished my question , she screamed, so loud it could break glass, she didn’t scream something in Particular she just, AHHHH’ed. 



What happend next is something that I cant believe was possible, she started bleeding out of her mouth, like vomit, but instead of vomit it was blood, this still seems bizarre to me but I just know that it was a lot of blood, like a lot a lot, I screamed too. Then her eyes just , fell, her eyes fell out  of their sockets and rolled right onto the floor and a faucet of blood leaked from her eyes, she fell to her knees and started to crawl, wide, i don’t know how to explain it but she stared to crawl with her legs spread really really unnaturally wide. She started crawling faster and faster and faster until she was about to reach me, I ran out side and locked the door. And I started sobbing.


 A girl from the next dorm came to me looking pissed until she saw my face, she helped me up and sat me down in her room as I tried to explain what was happening, but you can’t really explain that without sounding mentally ill so she called the cops.


They came and searched the house to find-NOTHING. The house was empty, i came with them to check and they were right, it was empty , she wasn’t in her room or in The kitchen, in fact even her things were gone. But here’s the kicker, her smell was there , i could tell that it was her smell from a mile away, it was awful and unmistakeable. Even the cops looked like they were about to be sick.I don’t remember  much after that, but yesterday, I got the news that was the scariest part of this whole story, they told me, that there is no one called Liv, well there was , and she apparently lived in my dorm and she was murdered, around 4 years ago. She was found in the kitchen cupboard years ago, as they were checking my house for an intruder they found her. She was in the exact same spot she was in when she was first found. Exactly  the same way she looked the first time she was found, I made them show me the corpse , and she looked and smelled exactly the same way she did that day in the kitchen, same black hair and the same face that was missing eyes. No one believed me when I told them she lived with me, when  I explained how she started acting strange the moment I noticed the way she smelled. No one believed me.Please, believe me.

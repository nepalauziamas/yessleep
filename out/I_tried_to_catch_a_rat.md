I’m moving to Uni this year, and I’ve set up with some mates in a house. We moved here earlier than usual, because Darren (the landlord) made us sign a 12 month lease and two flat mates are moving out in July. So on July 28th, I packed my stuff up and moved in. 


The first night was ok. I accidentally fell asleep on the sofa whilst watching the commonwealth games opening. The only problem was the sore back the next day. Night 2 was similar, although this time I passed out in my bed. I think it’s just because I’m really tired from the move, but yeah. 


Night 3. That was the first time I heard it. If anyone has had a pet, you know that sound they make when they paw on the door? Like the scratch that doesn’t sound scratchy? I thought I heard that. Not against the door though. It was sort of in the walls. Like *inside* the walls. Which I thought was really odd because these walls are paper thin, and when I asked my roommate Finley he said he couldn’t hear it. I thought that I was probably dreaming it and I left it alone for the day. 


But again, on night 4 I heard the scratch. At first I thought it was some kind of tree or bush against a window or something, but the oak in the garden doesn’t have long enough branches. So I called up Darren, and he said it was probably rats and he would come to check it out in the morning. 


When Darren got here we couldn’t find anything. There are no holes in the baseboards, and there aren’t vents or anything for rats to climb through. We put out some rat poison and a few traps though just in case, and that was it. 


Night five was scary. I couldn’t sleep at all, and the scratching was that loud it sounded like giggling. I got up at like 6 in the morning to check these fucking traps and there was nothing. The cheese from that night was still there. 


Night 6 was terrible. I couldn’t sleep again and the sound was crazy loud. I keep asking Kyle about it and he is still adamant he couldn’t hear it at all, so he must pass out really easily. When I finally got to sleep I had horrible dreams, like blurs of colours and that feeling when you are falling. But the weird bit was when I woke up, because it was the dead of night and I felt really uncomfortable. And I looked up and there was this thing? I don’t know but it was fucking ugly. Like ugly ugly. 


It looks like that teddy you got as a baby that was worn down and never washed and now looks like 4 strands of rope tied together. Like some kind of wool jumper thrown in the washing machine and it’s shrunk. Hideous. This thing is five inches tall and looks like a mashed up garden gnome, but it’s I guess like a… green? And furry? And it’s standing on my chest wiggling around? And it smells weird too, like fresh paint and chemicals. I thought I was still dreaming it but then it FUCKING BIT ME. HARD. I think it did anyway. I don’t think it has teeth. 


That bitch is fast btw. You know when you frighten a spider and it moves way too fast for its size? If it was human sized it could probably run at like 80kmh. It was like that. Fastest fucking green blur I’ve ever seen. And it jumped behind my desk, but I put my desk up basically 4 days ago and there wasn’t a hole or gap for it to go behind. 


So yesterday when I got up I checked the bite. It hasn’t bled, but it did break the skin. It doesn't look infected or anything, but I’m going to the hospital later today to check just in case. 


I wanted to catch this THING. No one comes into my room and bites me. It’s not going to be that easy. I set up a cardboard sheet and put glue all over it like the tree from the twits. If it came the last night it would probably come that night, and I wanted it dead. 


So I was laid in bed, eyes closed at around 2 in the morning and I was listening to the scratching. I HEARD THE FUCKING THING GIGGLE and then I felt a weight on my chest again. There the bitch was standing right in the trap. It got stuck quickly actually, and I managed to lift it up and get it into an empty Pringles tube I had lying around. I finally fucking caught it. 


And let me just say this thing is ugly. Like wtf? It’s green all over, even it’s eyes and there’s patches of fur missing on its back? I really don’t know how to describe it. 


Anyway yeah, sorry for the long read. I’m just really pissed off at this thing, and my arm hurts and I don’t know what’s going on. I’m so confused. I showed Finley the Pringles tube and he thought it looked like a sock, and I showed Jade, my other flat mate and Jack too. I’m hoping to show Darren and I’m taking it with me later today when I go to the hospital to get it checked out. 



EDIT: I found what it looks like. Those fire things who sing the song and their limbs come off from Labyrinth. They are orange though, and human sized. This is green? Anyway I’m in the hospital now and I’m waiting for it. 


EDIT 2: WTF IT ESCAPED? I BROUGHT IT TOO THE HOSPITAL AND I SHOWED THEM THE BIGHT AND THEY SAID IT WASNT AND ANIMAL BITW BUT THEN I SHOWED THEM THE TUBE WITH THE THING IN AND IT WAS GONE. THERE WAS A FUCKING GREEN SOCK AT THE BOTTOM I DONT OWN A GREEN SOCK 
 

Edit 4: I got out of the thing and I’m waiting for the results. But I checked the tub again and it’s there? I don’t know how it was a sock 


EdIT 5: THE THING IS STILL INSIDE THE TUBE AND IM IN BED AND I STILL HEAR THE SCRATCHING ITS IN THE FUCKING WALLS I WANT TO DIE 


edit 6.  theres more than one theres more than one theres more than one

I'm using a throwaway account because of the legal mess I could get into sharing this information. I would lose my job, and likely worse than that. But I have to tell someone. It will put my mind at ease, I hope. And it may save you if you ever see what I saw.

I work in a hospital. My position allows me access to chart notes of patients here. I'm going to share the nurse's notes here, then I'll try my best to retell about my experiences. Each clinical note will be headed by the date, time and name, as it’s relevant, but I’ve censored the names to protect everyone involved.


Before I get into things, I’m going to be changing some words due to privacy, plus some words or abbreviations that people outside of the medical field may not understand. I will put these things in [brackets].


It starts at 3 am on a thursday. I wasn’t working yet, but at 5pm I clocked in for an overnight. It was pretty normal at first, until I started hearing stories from coworkers of what had been going on. I’ll get into this later, though. It starts with the initial triage note, when police officers and local EMS bring in a man on a stretcher, handcuffed and strapped down. He was dressed like any other guy, in a casual t shirt and red track pants. 32 years old, had never been to our hospital so he wasn’t in our system. He never told us more than his name and date of birth.

Patient awoke suddenly screaming and thrashing, put back in restraints. Security cameras have seen the man with sunglasses walking hallways that are employee access only. Extra security has been called and the ED has been put on a secure lockdown. More police officers will be arriving shortly.


This is where I'll pick up the story as the clinical notes get very scattered from here. The event I'm going to describe happened over the course of 20 minutes.


It started with him screaming at exactly 3 am. I could hear him all the way down the hallway, but I wasn't allowed even close to the room. Shouting and screaming isn’t exactly out of place in an emergency room, especially psych, yet everyone in the whole department had become very visibly shaken and nervous. The air had thinned out and it almost became hard to breathe in there. We aren't a small hospital, but we're not a big one either. Nothing like this patient had ever been seen before.


Security saw the man with sunglasses on security cameras in 3 places, all exclusively employee access only. One of the places even I am not allowed. He wore pitch black shades, a circular black hat sort of similar to what the US navy sailors would wear. It was a dark, dark gray. So was his robe, a long, patterned piece of cloth stretching all the way to the floor so no part of his feet was visible. It was covered in ornate black designs but the security cameras are too low-resolution to really pick out any of it's finer details. How he was found in 3 places is completely unknown. Not just unknown, but impossible. No one could've done that. Security is blaming technical error but after hearing the patient's screams about not being safe, I can't believe that. Something different was *coming for him.*


At exactly 03:20 in the morning the screaming stopped. It all just ceased in an instant. A large flash of red light had been seen by some of my coworkers coming through the little windows in the doors of the patient's room. Light a deep red like a UV heat lamp. As my coworker said… a sinister red. After the light, the whole ED was quiet for a second, until people started to investigate what happened.


Three doctors, two nurses, three techs, four security guards. They were in the room with the flash of light and after it, they weren't. They weren't in any room, they had completely vanished. No trace of anyone left behind.


The patient was there, though. For the most part.  The body of the patient was there, all except the eyes. They had been removed with clean cuts to the eye stalks as if done by a surgeon.


Nothing special happened that day besides these events. It was pretty typical. But it just felt wrong to even be there. It was like I had to leave just so I could go clear my mind. I did some heavy drinking that night, I remember. They didn’t let me go back to work for 3 days. Our department closed and emergency patients were diverted to another nearby hospital. I still don’t know who was there for 3 days and what they were doing.


2 weeks later one of our nurses that went missing had been identified in a hospital in Nice, France. Their police had contacted our hospital after identifying her and finding out that she had been listed as a missing person. She had apparently been quite uncooperative for their staff. She died that night for unknown reasons. But that's all I ever heard about that. No one really mentions the whole thing around here. We just kind of go on with our lives, try not to think about it too hard. There's a plaque here with the names of the missing people. They all have had funerals, their families all know that they're not coming back. It's sad to me that they'll never know what became of them. Probably no one ever will. Whatever happened, I'm not sure I even want to know. It feels almost safer the less I know.


I'm just glad I wasn't in the room with the flash. All I'll say is that if you ever find a little stone, about 2 inches wide, spherical, and painted ornately as an eyeball, don't touch it. Don't go near it, just leave and don't go back to it. The less you see, the safer you are.

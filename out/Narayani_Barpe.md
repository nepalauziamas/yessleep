 *TW: child abuse, sexual harm*

&#x200B;

The soft clinking of anklets inches closer. A soft mournful howl starts to grow louder.

I wake up in cold sweat, heart pounding in fear. Judging by the silence, it must be past 3 AM.

Every fiber in my being wants to run up to *Amma* and hide, despite being a few months away from turning 21. Reluctantly, I snuggle back into the blanket, making sure that my feet are tucked in and start chanting the *Hanuman Chalisa*, hoping to fall asleep.

\~\~\~

“You had a nightmare again, didn’t you?” *Amma* says at breakfast. “I’ve told you not to watch horror movies at night, but no…”

I’ve long given up trying to make her understand that no matter what I do, I still have these haunting nightmares – the mournful howls of a woman, and the clinking of her anklets echoing in the silent night, growing closer and closer…

*Appa* comes over in his saffron robes, wishing us good morning. He applies a pinch of *vibhuti* on my forehead. The woodsy scent of the sacred ash has a reassuring effect, and he smiles in knowledge.

“There - no more nightmares for my little girl.” He says, smiling.

*Amma* grumbles on how I’m this close to being of marriageable age and yet continue to be pampered as we all have breakfast. *Appa*’s made it clear to all our nosy relatives that his only child will not marry unless she has experienced a few years of financial independence. Knowing *Amma*’s weakness to peer pressure, they continue to gang up on her, which in turn gets served on me.

\~\~\~

As I join the next class via Zoom and set it on mute after marking my attendance, *Amma* and I have our regular cup of 11AM green tea.

“I had a weird dream.” I say.

“When didn’t you have one?” She counters.

“It was dark and pouring.” I continue, undeterred. “I was hiding in a cave, wrapped in a blanket. I could hear someone chanting something, but I don’t remember what. I felt so scared, and cold. Then it turned into the regular screening – the howling, the anklets.”

I turn to her. “What do you think it means?”

“What movie did you conjure this from?” She says offhandedly, but her voice was laced with fear.

“Well, you always say dreams mean something. It’s the first time I’ve had a dream that wasn’t just spooky voices. If I knew what it meant, I wouldn’t be afraid of it anymore and lose sleep over it.”

She gives me a long look – one she does when deciding whether to tell me something. Just as I give up hope and think her answer would be the usual “Go ask your *Appa* about it.”, she says, “Alright – I’ll tell you what it means, but you better not tell your *Appa* about it. Not one word, got it?” 

\~\~\~

We settle down for lunch, and today, we don’t have the TV on.

“This happened when you were around nine or ten.” She says. “It was our first visit to your *Appa*’s hometown after you were born. Your *Ajja* and *Appa* never got along once he decided to work as an engineer and apply for a job in the city rather than taking over the farms. We had been trying so hard for another child once you were born – diets, fertility treatments, visiting every temple, mosque and church…” she laughed without humor. “I’m glad we’re past that point in life.”

“Anyway, one of the astrologers I visited told that we should visit the family deity and make a vow to offer whatever the deity asks for in exchange for a son. I contacted your *Ajja* to make the necessary arrangements so that we can visit the shrine during the *Kola* ritual, when the *darshana* *paatri* would channel the spirit of the Goddess *Narayani*, and we could place our request to Her through him. Your *Appa* was furious, but what I hadn’t expected was for him to be so… terrified.” She says, searching for the right word. “I don’t think ‘terrified’ would even cover it.”

“He was reluctant to go, as you would’ve guessed by now. Your *Ajja* and I persisted, though. I begged and pleaded, and the old man would call day and night, crying about how he had never seen his grandchild. Your *Appa* eventually gave in, and we decided to go to the village on your summer holidays for the week of the ritual. It was going to be your first overnight train ride, and you were so excited, telling all your friends about your upcoming summer visit to meet your grandpa.” She smiles wistfully.

“Your *Ajja* was over the moon. He had even booked an Ambassador to pick us up from the railway station. I was nervous as hell, meeting my in-laws for the first time since the wedding. I had dressed you in the finest clothes we could afford, and I was going on and on about how you needed to behave. Your father was of no help, anyway. The man looking for excuses to hightail it out of there. Your grandparents, however, were warm and caring people. They loved you the instant they laid their eyes on you.” She says, pointedly. “You have to know that.”

“The others, however,” she sighs, “Well, here’s where it gets rough. They always saw your father as a threat, that he would inherit all the property. Not that your father ever wanted it, let me tell you. He gave it away to them, even after your grandparents had bequeathed him a part of the ancestral property. They were happy that there was no male heir to challenge their rights. When they realized we were coming for the *Kola*, boy were they troubled.”

She begins again after we do the dishes. “I wonder if you still remember what the shrine looks like, but then again, you wouldn’t be asking me about this if you did. It’s a serene place – off the highways where the forest cover is still preserved. There’s even a small stream a few minutes away from the temple. The only few people who live nearby are the caretakers assigned from each family, who live in the nearby quarters. The shrine itself is plain, with enough space for three people to circumambulate. There’s also flat land in front of the shrine which is as wide as our apartment. Finally, there’s the *Guhe*.” 

She pauses and looks at the wall clock. “Isn’t it time for your afternoon classes? Attend your classes, and we’ll talk more in the evening.”

“But you *just* got to the interesting bit!” I protest. “The *Guhe* – that’s the cave, right? Did I go in there when we went there during the holidays? What happened?”

“Classes – now.” She says, ending the conversation

\~\~\~

Time passes by at a snail’s pace. I couldn’t wait for the classes to be over. 

When the last class done at 6PM, I shut down my laptop and wait for *Amma*’s TV serials to be done with.

“Well, then…” she says, turning off the TV. “Where were we?”

“You mentioned the *Guhe.*” I remind her.

“Ah, yes.” She says. “The *Guhe* is a small cave-like structure they built which sits at the other end of the flat land, facing the shrine. It’s where the spirits of past *darshana patri*s reside, and where animal sacrifices are held as part of the *Kola*. It’s also where a wild young woman stayed.”

“No one really knows who her parents were, where she stayed, or even her name. All that anyone knew was that the spirits of past *darshana patris* would possess her, and when that happened, she would sit at the mouth of the small cave and bang her hand drum, loudly proclaiming ’*Narayani Barpe!*’”.

*Amma* halts, mindful of her loud voice, and proceeds to repeat it again, in a lower faux baritone.

“Goddess *Narayani* is coming.” She says with a small smile. “That’s what it means. She was the only woman who could enter and leave the caves as she pleased – mainly because no one dared to mess with someone possessed by spirits. Women were encouraged to leave dresses, flowers, or ornaments at the mouth of the cave so that the spirits would carry their wishes to the Goddess. So, when we decided to visit the shrine a day before the *Kola*, I thought you should be the one to place the offerings at the entrance, since children are pure of heart and it’s believed that *Narayani* makes children’s wishes come true sooner. I know, it was a little manipulative of me, sending you there – but then I desperately wanted a son. All those nosy relatives were driving me insane, going on about how I hadn’t done my duty as a wife by not giving your *Appa* a son.”

“When your father wasn’t looking, I handed you the bag of offerings and told you to place it at the entrance and hurry back. Since you were being *you*, all my warnings went right over your head and you decided to barge right in because you wanted to meet the ‘cave lady’. Scared me to death, I’ll say.” Her hand flies to her neck, remembering the horror.

“When we rushed to the cave, we saw you trying to reason with the woman to take the bag, just like someone trying to feed a wild dog. Your *Ajja* diverted the woman’s attention while *Appa* led you away to safety. We remarked on how calm you were through it all. ‘She’s definitely *Narayani’s* special child.’, your *Ajja* said.”

“We were all too busy with the preparations for the *Kola*. Since it was our family’s turn to organize the ritual, we were busy with setting up the food and decorations. It wasn’t until we went off to sleep past midnight that we realized you were gone. Your *Ajja* gathered the villagers and sent out a search party with your *Appa*.”

She shudders, letting out a shaky breath. “They came back with you at the crack of dawn. Your *Ajja* was in tears as your father ordered me to pack up. Your father…”

*Amma*’s eyes well up with tears. She pauses, trying to regain composure.

“Your father wouldn’t let you go. He held you in his arms for the entirety of the bus ride back home. His face was a mixture of anger, fear, and determination. He wouldn’t even tell me what happened, saying he wanted to take you to a hospital back in the city. I was so scared. In my mind I had pretty much assumed the worst.”

Tears roll down *Amma*’s cheeks. Cold seep into my bones, drawing up to the same conclusions my mother had on the journey back home.

“He took you to a gynecologist who was a family friend – someone who would remain discreet. Fortunately, you weren’t raped. But you were dangerously close.” She says. “It was in the doctor’s waiting room that your father told me what had happened.”

“One of the servants had seen your father’s cousin and his friends take you out asleep, saying they were taking you to the doctor. One of the men in that group was the caretaker near the shrine. Once your father heard that bit, he raced to the shrine.” 

“It turns out there used to be an ancient ritual, where once every ten years, they would select an unmarried girl from one of the families of the village who hadn’t achieved puberty yet and would give her away to the temple in service of the Goddess. What should have been the sacrosanct position of an oracle soon turned into an excuse for unscrupulous perverts to feast upon little girls.” She goes on, anger simmering in her voice.

“Your father came to know of it when he was a teenager, when your *Ajja* took him to the ceremony. On the night before the *Kola*, all men who have attained puberty gather to witness the… *deflowering*… of the new oracle. Your father had compared it to a cult ceremony straight out of a horror movie. Apparently, the girl would be drugged with *bhaang*, dressed in the finest silk *saree* and gold jewelry and after hours of constants chants of ‘*Narayani Barpe*’ and drumbeats, she was deemed to have invoked Her spirit and the men would take turns to ‘receive Her blessings’.”

I shuddered. 

“That very ritual was the reason your father ran away from home when he was fourteen. He continued his studies thanks to a distant relative who had long ago left the village because of its beliefs, returning just once to complete our marriage ceremonies. Over the past decade, the village had seen a decline in prosperity – the fields wouldn’t yield good harvests, women were miscarrying, men weren’t finding good matches. The village decided that the current oracle was past her prime, and since you were the only girl child born into a family of the village, they persuaded the family to bring us – *you* – back. Your *Ajja* was dead set against the ritual, with his only grandchild on the line, but the relatives snuck you out when no one was looking.”

*Amma* heaved a sigh, face drawn long.

“It was the woman who saved you.” She said after a long pause. “Your father described the shrine grounds as a carnage. She was standing at the entrance of the cave, covered in blood and entrails, and holding a sickle like Goddess *Kali*. There were bodies strewn all over the shrine. Your father had nightmares of her slicing a police inspector’s neck and then buried her hands in the cut to tear it up wide open. Not one man who went there died peacefully that night.”

“Apparently there were all kinds of men there.” She says. “Irrespective of age, caste and religion, they all decided to come together to prey upon a little girl – united by their perverse *fucking* desires.” 

She looks at me with a sad, sardonic smile. “I shouldn’t swear – not a good influence on a girl of marriageable age – but then, that’s the big, bad world for you. I wonder sometimes who that young woman must have been. Was she loved and cared for? Did no one from her family stop these degraded animals from ruining her life? It took a madwoman to save you from the so-called ‘protectors’ of the village. No wonder your father never wanted to do anything with them.”

A long time passes as I try to wrestle with the growing turmoil of emotions within me – rage, sadness, horror. *Amma* breaks the silence.

“We stopped trying for another child after that.” She says. “Your father said that once he reached the shrine, the woman looked at him and brought you out, unconscious and wrapped in a stinking tattered blanket. ‘Safeguard my child.’ She said to your father, in front of the gathered crowd. ‘If you don’t want this village to be harmed again, this child, and all my children must thrive.’”

“What happened to the woman?” I ask.

“She was found dead a few days later.” *Amma* says. “No one’s sure how – maybe she took her own life, maybe someone else did.”  

After another long period of heavy silence, *Amma* awkwardly says, “Well, mystery solved now. A madwoman saved you from being raped. Your grandparents continued to apologize to your father till their dying breath. The shrine was closed, and the idols drowned in the sea.”

“Don’t tell your father about this.” She says, the stress clearly visible in the deep furrows in her forehead. “Once we realized you had no recollection of the night, your father started to heal. If he ever knows that you know, no good will ever come of it. The men who tried to hurt you are all dead, as well as the woman who saved you. The place now no longer exists, as well as the people tied to it.”

As she sits next to me and pulls me into a hug, she says, “It was all a bad dream, and it’s all that it ever will be.”

\~\~\~

Tonight, the dream is different.

I’m in front of the shrine, feeling strangely disoriented. Two women, who I vaguely recognize to be the aunties from *Ajja*’s house push bangles up on my wrists and grab my face to roughly apply makeup.

A group of men come and pull me away to the cave. I try to call for *Amma*, but my voice is weak even to my own ears.

They garland me and light an *aarti*. The chants of ‘*Narayani Barpe!*’ fill the air in sync with drumbeats. Two other men hold down my arms and legs to prevent me from getting up as they wave the *aarti* in my face.

After the *aarti* is passed across the group, one of the men turns back and proclaims something, making the others shout and cheer. Fear swells up in me as the man approaches me with a feverish gleam in his eyes.

“*Amma!*” I shriek, and the men descend upon me like a pack of hungry dogs.

I scream and scream as they paw at the *saree* too big for my frame and held together with loose knots. It easily gives way as I scramble into the cave. 

I feel a hand grip my ankle and pull me out. I desperately grab onto whatever I could find.

A loud growl startles both me and my captor. The cave lady staggers as she steps out of the cave, shaking her head after I had pulled on her matted hair. She wears a muddy dress, with a dirty tattered blanket slipping off her frail shoulders, revealing discolored bruises. Her glowing red eyes fall on my shivering body, and she roars, silencing the men. She grabs me by the arm with one hand, and brandishes a bloody, rusty sickle in the other.

The men look in shock and mutter nervously as she growls at them with bared teeth.

“*Narayani barpe…*” she growls.

She pushes me behind her, signaling to go back in the cave. I gingerly pick up the blanket now fallen to the ground.

I pull the blanket over my head, feeling dazed, disoriented, and desperately wishing for *Amma* and *Appa* to find me. I hear screams, cries, and distorted croaks, all while the woman continues to chant ‘*Narayani barpe*’ in her gravelly voice.

After what feels like an eternity, the world goes black. 

The soft clinking of anklets falls on my ears, and I feel a warm embrace as I am lifted off the ground and carried away.

“My special child.” Says the gravelly voice. “Fly away and thrive.”

\~\~\~

Whenever the soft clinking of anklets now graces my dreams, I now no longer fear it.

I realize now that the low moans are lullabies, soothing away my worries.

*Narayani barpe*, I hear the voice say to me. *Narayani is coming.*

*Swaagata*, I say. 

*Welcome, Goddess Narayani.*

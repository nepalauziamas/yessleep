Wishes are a feeling or expression of a strong desire or hope for something that is not easily attainable; they want something that cannot or probably will not happen.

That's how my life goes I wished for a lot of things and none of them have happened.

I've wished for better muscles.

I've wished for a girlfriend and other things.

But wishes never happen to me, and they never come true either.

In other words, my life stinks. It's even worse because of my sister. Instead of my mom waking me up, my sister does.

And the way she does it is by jumping on me until my back feels like it's going to break.

Did I mention she's only twelve years old and I'm sixteen? So imagine how I feel every day.

And then there are the bullies. Why do those jerks even exist in the first place?

I remembered that yesterday, one of those bullies put a baby doll head in my locker.

It freaked me out at first and made me jump in shock and horror. The whole thing made me feel stupid.

And even today, as I was sitting in the cafeteria eating lunch by myself, which happens a lot,

A guy came up to my table and smiled at me, which was a bit confusing for me.

" Hey Jimmy I wanted to give you something, "he said, holding out a sandwich.

" You wanted to give me a sandwich?" I asked, confused.

Before I could say no, the guy shoved it into my hands and I looked at him and he nodded.

I took a bite of it and nearly choked on it.

When I opened the sandwich, I noticed there was an alive worm in there. I hadn't bitten the worm, but I got the area around it.

I almost puked in front of the whole school, and then I excused myself before running out of the cafeteria, still tasting the worm in my mouth.

After that, the school day was over, and I decided to walk home. I mean, I didn't have anyone to sit with on the bus, so I just walked.

As I was walking, I was thinking about something I could do to turn the tables on everyone who was being a jerk to me.

Just then, I stopped in front of a store. It looked brand new but old and abandoned at the same time.

The werid wonder's, the sign above the door said. Thinking I had a few minutes to spare, I decided to check the place out.

As I walked into the store, something flew over my head and I ducked, gasping in shock.

I then headed to the front counter and noticed a woman with her back turned to me.

There was a black raven sitting on the corner of the front desk looking at me with sharp eyes.

"How may I assist you, young man?" the lady asked as she turned around.

"Um - I was wondering if I could buy something from you. I've never seen this shop before, "I said, grinning nervously."

Now that I was face-to-face with the woman, I noticed how different she looked from me.

Her hair was long and was black and gray. One of her eyes was clouded over, so it was all white.

She was wearing a dark robe, and she had dark red nails and dark red lips to match.

"Well, what would you like to buy?" She asked, grinning mysteriously at me.

I looked around the place, and then I noticed a necklace lying on the counter in front of me.

The necklace was shaped like a gold medal and had a good-sized green jewel in the middle of it.

" How much for that?" I asked, pointing at the necklace.

" For you it's free, but hear this warning: be careful what you wish for, young man," the lady said, grinning mysteriously at me again.

Without another word, I took the necklace and put it on before thanking the woman and heading out of her store.

I mumbled, "That was weird. I can't believe I had never seen the store before. "

I kept thinking about it till I realized I would have to see my sister at home.

You see, I look after my sister. She would get home after me, and I would have to look after her until Mom got home.

"I wish my sister would act more mature," I grumbled under my breath.

Suddenly, I stopped and looked down. I noticed the green jewel of my new necklace was glowing.

It didn't do that in the store, so why was it doing that now?

I headed home and a few minutes later, I got to the house and headed inside and looked around.

" Mom!" I shouted, hoping she would be home.

Just then, a young lady walked into the hallway. She looked just like my sister in every way.

She had red hair and blue eyes and was wearing the same thing my sister was wearing this morning.

" Hey Jimmy, how was school today?" She asked, grinning at me.

"Um-do I know you?" I asked, looking at the girl confused.

" It's my Rachel, you little werido," she said, grinning at me.

" But the last time you were twelve years old," I said, freaking out.

Rachel didn't say anything, she just patted me on the head and then headed off to somewhere else.

A few minutes later, Mom showed up, and then she started making dinner, and I thought it would be the perfect time to ask her what was going on.

"Mom, have you noticed anything weird about Rachel?" I asked to watch her.

" What are you talking about, Jimmy?" Mom inquired, her gaze fixed on me.

" Well mom, Rachel's older than me and this morning she was younger than me. She's supposed to be twelve, not however old she is now," I cried out.

"Honey, your sister has always been twenty-one. Did you forget that?" mom said, grinning.

My head began to hurt, and I dashed upstairs to my room, where I sighed softly and stared out the window, thinking.

I then rubbed my eyes when I noticed that there was a black raven sitting outside of my window.

It looked like the one I saw in the store I rubbed my eyes, but it was gone before I could see it closer.

Then at dinner, I kept looking at my sister, who was chatting with mom about driving to the mall after school tomorrow.

Then I went to my room and got ready for bed. When I heard a throat clearing, I looked up and noticed Rachel was standing there.

" Where did you get the necklace from?" She asked, pointing at the new necklace.

"Um-from a jewelry store, the person working there let me have it for free," I said, grinning nervously.

Then Rachel walked away and I sat on my bed wondering what was going to happen tomorrow and if I was dreaming this entire thing up.

The next morning, when I woke up, I couldn't stop thinking about yesterday.

But I got up and did everything I was supposed to do to get ready for school.

And instead of Mom driving me, Rachel told me she was going to drive me, which freaked me out.

" Why is this happening? What's going on?" I thought.

Anyways, Rachel dropped me off at school and I headed inside to my classroom where I was supposed to be learning, but that wasn't happening.

Because I knew that the necklace I was wearing had to be connected to what happened.

I mean, it had to be because right when I made my dumb wish, the necklace glowed.

And of course, I got in trouble because I was paying more attention to my thoughts than the class.

As I headed down the hall, I suddenly tripped on something and hit the ground, also breaking my nose in the process.

I looked up and saw the football jerk who gave me the worm sandwich yesterday. His name was Scott.

" Hey Jimmy, have a nice trip." He said, grinning at me.

I stood up, dusting myself off, and I was glaring at him, and he was laughing at me like a tiny baby.

"You know what, I wish something horrible would happen to you!" I snapped at him.

Then my necklace shone brighter, and Scott burst out laughing.

" I'm so scared. I can't wait to cream you in gym class," he snapped as he shoved me.

Then he walked away and I looked down at my necklace, realizing what I had done.

But I couldn't stop it now and then I headed to gym class wondering what was going to happen to Scott.

It turned out we were playing soccer and then Scott was going to be a goalie. I wanted to tell him not to, but he wouldn't listen to me.

Then it started. Everyone started kicking the ball around and chasing it. Luckily, I was on the sidelines watching.

Then it happened. A kid kicked the ball, and when Scott went to grab it, the ball hit him at sonic speed in the face.

He cried out in pain and fell to the ground on his knees, and then everyone ran over to him, including me.

When the coach got there, Scott took his hands off his face and everyone gasped.

Scott's nose was bleeding, and he actually had two of his teeth laying on the ground, and his mouth was bleeding a bit.

" What happened to him?" Someone asked.

" I'll tell you what happened. It's his fault!" Scott shouted, pointing at me.

" But he wasn't playing soccer. How is it his fault?" Someone else asked.

" When we were talking with each other in the hallway, he told me he wished something horrible would happen to me!" Scott shouted.

" But I didn't hit him in the face with the ball," I said, sounding annoyed.

Let's just say after that I got in trouble. I was going to have detention for two weeks. I didn't know what to do.

Then I realized what I had to do. If I bought that necklace from the store, I was going to take it back to the store.

So after school, I ran to the store, and when I got there, I stopped short and I nearly fainted.

The store wasn't there. In fact, nothing was there. It was just an empty space.

" What the heck, where's the store?" I cried out in anger.

Just then, I heard a loud squawking. When I looked up, I saw that a black raven was sitting on a streetlight and it was holding a piece of paper in its mouth.

Then the bird dropped the note in front of me and it fluttered to the ground, and then I bent down and I picked it up.

I unfolded the note and my eyes went wide in shock.

"I told you to be careful what you wish for, for now you are going to pay for your actions."

I looked up and noticed the raven was gone, and I shoved the note in my pocket.

I was right, it was the necklace, and then I had an idea of how I could get rid of it.

I was thinking maybe if I broke it or got rid of it, all the wishes would come true.

I headed to my room when I got home with a hammer, and then I took the necklace off, sitting it on the desk in my room.

I was going to break it If it was a necklace, it should break into a bunch of different pieces and everything should go back to the way it's supposed to go.

Then I raised the hammer ready to break it, then I slammed it down, and then I cried out in shock.

When I looked down, I realized I had hit my hand, which hurt like hell, and I grabbed it, groaning in agony.

I looked down again and noticed the necklace was still OK and now my hand was messing up.

"Ugh, I wish my hand was OK," I said out loud.

Suddenly, my hand started twitching and then, a few seconds later, it stopped hurting and felt normal.

I grabbed the necklace and looked at it, growling under my breath. I had to get rid of this thing.

But I couldn't because the store where I got it was closed. I'm sure if I threw it away, it would just show back up in my bedroom.

I didn't know what to do.

Maybe I could give it away to someone else I could wish for anything to turn back to normal, and then I could give the necklace to someone else.

The day after, I was standing in the hallway of the school and I was listening to kids talking about Scott.

They said his nose was broken and that those teeth weren't going to grow back in, but I didn't care about that because it had a plan.

I was looking around, wondering who I could give the necklace to, mostly looking at the girls.

But then I was wondering if I should tell them that it could make their wishes come true, but then decided not to because they probably wouldn't believe me.

"Man, I wish someone would die," I grumbled, thinking about the other jerks in my school.

Suddenly, there was a loud bang, and I then noticed a locker had just landed on a kid, and everyone else was screaming in fear.

I ran over and noticed the kid was laying under the locker. Their whole face were bleeding, and their eyes were dazed because they were dead, and I gasped in shock.

" What the hell did I do?" I cried out in my thoughts.

I then turned around and ran off down the hallway until I got to an empty space where no one was.

I slid to the floor, looking at the necklace that I had. I felt tears running down my face.

This necklace was running my life. I watched my wishes come true, but it was all twisted in a dark way.

Suddenly, a thought filled my head and I smiled. If I could wish for everything I wanted, this idea should work.

" I wish I had never gotten this necklace," I said, looking down at it.

I closed my eyes, breathing heavily, and then I jumped away and realized I was sitting in my bed.

I looked around, wondering what happened. I looked down and then noticed the necklace wasn't on me.

Then my bedroom door opened and Rachel, who was twelve again, rushed into my room and jumped onto my bed.

"  Good morning Jimmy!" She shouted, grinning at me.

Before she could react, I hugged her so tight she was very confused.

But an hour later, I was thinking about what had happened. I then stopped.

I noticed the kid who had been crushed by the locker and smiled at them. They were completely OK.

But then I noticed something else. It was Scott. He looked OK, but I couldn't pay attention to anything but the necklace he was wearing.

It was my necklace, the wishing one. He then walked away and I followed after him, noticing he was heading for the bathroom.

When I got in there, he turned around and glared at me with a dark look in his eyes.

" Why are you following me, creep?" He snapped at me.

I noticed his nose was completely fine and that he had all his teeth, and I looked at the necklace, which was indeed mine.

"Dude, where did you get that necklace?" I asked, pointing at it.

"Oh, I got it at a store yesterday; it's pretty cool, isn't it?" he grinned.

" Look dude, you don't want to make any wishes with that on," I explained to him.

" Um--why not?" Scott asked, sounding concerned.

" Because I had that necklace and when I made wishes it twisted them all, and if you make wishes it's going to twist them all." I was cut off when Scott held up his hand.

"Dude, I wish you would shut your mouth," Scott said to me.

" But dude please-" I was suddenly cut off.

I couldn't open my mouth again I touched my lips and felt something werid on them.

I turned around to look at the mirror and realized my lips had been wired shut and I screamed a muffled scream.

I looked at Scott, who looked worried at first, then he smiled.

" You know what people say, Jimmy, silence is golden," he said, grinning.

Then, without another word, Scott walked out of the bathroom, leaving me to deal with the problem I had now.

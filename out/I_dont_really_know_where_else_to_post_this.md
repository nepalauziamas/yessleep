I don’t really know where else to post this …. have you guys heard the story of those kids that were locked up by their own parents, they were chained up they are called the Turpin family, my mom lived on the same street as them she FaceTimed me and showed me all the neighbors outside, so many cops that day and it wasn’t usual, that was a very nice, calm & wealthy neighborhood . My mom and her wife said they never suspected anything they bought that house in 2012 and never had no issues, around Christmas time a lot of people go to that neighborhood for the crazy beautiful lights.

I live about 2 hours away from my mom, after that incident I tried to always keep an eye out for anything unusual going on in the neighborhood and be more aware of my surroundings. To protect others and myself.

I have a roommate named Xavier I met him in elementary we’ve been inseparable since then. He first alarmed me about our back neighbor when we first moved into this house. He thought it was weird that Mr.Brian was always in his living room , with the tv on but facing the street. I told him that Mr.Brian was old and he was probably retired and tv was maybe his only friend now.

Mr.Brian is socially awkward, even when we greet him to say Good morning when we take our dogs out for their morning piss and shit he’s awkward, avoids eye contact and goes back inside until we leave for work.

He’s an animal person as well, he has MANY cats and many dogs. We hadn’t seen Mr.Brian for many days his cats started climbing the fence to come to our yard and they were in our dogs food bowls, my roommate thought maybe Mr.Brian went on vacation… I called bullshit his animals would never be left alone without food and water.

On Sunday it made one full week since I last seen him, I called the cops to do a welfare check on him, what happened next blew my fucking mind. 

Mr.Brian isn’t Mr.Brian.. he’s a convicted murder he killed a hitchhiker in 1980 he served 25 years in prison moved to California and made a fake identity and a brand new fake life. His real name is Alfred. Alfred had kidnapped 2 prostitues and held them captive in his basement for 4 years… he went down to check on them and feed them, after 4 long years they managed to attack him and killed him with stabbing him 77 times in his body most of the punctures were on his face .. they accomplished it  with a broken screwdriver. Only one of them made it out alive the other died of dehydration. We never suspected this from Mr.Brian.

He was feeding them cat meat and dog meat the whole time they were locked up, he had sound proved the basement and he had a digit code to get in and out. I hope the victim gets the help she needs , screw Mr,Brian he can rot in hell. So sorry for all the animals he abused as well

Never under estimate your roommate when he warns you of a creepy neighbor,

Hello, my name is Akio, and I am 105 years old. I live in Japan, and I am one of the survivors of Hiroshima. I live a rather secluded life in the countryside, and rarely leave my cottage. I just can't stand living a normal life after what happened that horrible day. 

The date was the 6th of August, 1945. I woke up and my wife made me breakfast as usual. I took a few sips of my coffee and had a chat to my wife about the leaflets that were dropped onto the city a few days ago. They warned of some kind of American bombing and told us all to evacuate. However, very few people took it seriously and most shrugged it off as mere propaganda. To this day I still regret ignoring those leaflets. Shortly after finishing my breakfast, I left for work. I got into my car, and drove away from my house.

Work was only  10 minutes in the car, so I was always one of the early ones. I drove through the city, and onto one of the busy roads. Soon enough, I got stuck in a traffic jam. I cursed my luck, and patiently waited for the traffic jam to move. As I sighed and stared out the window in boredom, I noticed a small plane flying over. I didn't care at first, but when I saw a bomb drop out of it, a shiver went down my spine. I slowly opened my car door and got out.

Other people were doing the same, and they were all as scared as I was. Some stood still, while some fled. I was frozen in fear, as the bomb plummeted towards the surface. Suddenly, the bomb exploded high up in the air. A flash of light temporarily blinded me, and I felt an unimaginable shot of pain. it felt like my body was being impaled, burned, and electrocuted at the same time. I felt my skin sizzle and I collapsed onto the floor. I felt strange movement on my skin as the pain started to fade away. I eventually regained my vision, and everyone around me looked deformed.

Some had extra limbs, and others had glowing skin. The buildings and cars, however, were fine. Completely untouched. My skin continued to feel strange, and I felt and tingling sensation all over my body. I managed to get off the floor, and had a proper look around. I saw some dead people, but most were mutated. The tingling sensation soon ceased, and I tried to help some injured people. I saw somebody with some burns, and I consoled them.

About an hour later, soldiers filled the streets. I reunited with my wife, who managed to survive without any mutations. The next day, I was studied by a group of doctors. They were confused as to why I apparently had no mutations and no injuries. They ran some tests and one of them included electrocuting me. The electricity seemed to hover a centimetre above my skin, causing no harm at all. The doctors were baffled, and they tried to burn me the next test. However, similar to the electricity, it hovered a centimetre above my skin. The doctors were speechless, and handed me in to the army. They tried many things on me, such as shooting me, poisoning me, and stabbing me, but nothing worked. The bullets simply deflected off the forcefield around my skin. They eventually let me go, even more confused than the doctors.

I now knew I was immortal, and I didn't know what to make of it. I told my wife, and she was as confused as everybody else. About a week later, strange things started happening, and government officials visited the city. People were taken away to be studied and experimented on, and I was worried that the army would come back for me. I heard of the attack in Nagasaki, and heard of all the survivor stories. I was confused, because their experiences were nothing like mine. They spoke of large mushroom clouds and unimaginable destruction, but nothing about the mutations. I saw photos of the wasteland that once was Nagasaki, and there was nothing but scattered remains of buildings. I was even more confused, as there was barley any destruction in Hiroshima. 

The army presence only became larger, as explosives were being planted and buildings were being demolished. Me and my wife were worried, and were collected by the army to be evacuated. As we were driven away from the city, many bombs were detonated. More buildings were being deliberately demolished, and the city was beginning to look like Nagasaki.

During our evacuation, I met another survivor named Haruto. I had a conversation with him about my experience, and told him about my immortality. He was amazed, and told me about his experiences. He told me that he had to get his extra limb amputated, and that the hospital was overflowing with patients. He also told me his own theory about the current situation. He believes that the city is being demolished to cover up the mutations, and the government is trying their hardest to portray what happened in Hiroshima as what happened in Nagasaki. I believed his theory, but I was still confused as to why the government is demolishing the entire city just to cover up the mutations. 

Eventually, the military truck stopped and the soldiers let us out. We were the countryside, and I gathered my belongings from the truck with my wife. We were told that were going to stay in a temporary camp until permanent housing can get sorted out. All of us were still very confused, and were glad to finally have some rest. In the middle of the night, me and my wife were awoken by screams and gunshots. I took a peek out of my tent, and saw some mutated people attacking the soldiers. The soldiers were shooting them dead, but some mutants managed to tear open some tents and brutally kill the occupants. Screaming filled the camp, and I looked away in terror. My wife was panicking, and I tried to calm her down. Eventually, the gunshots and screaming ceased. The soldiers didn't bother to check on us, and we eventually drifted back to sleep.

The next day, soldiers brought everyone breakfast, and we got out of our tents to have walk around the camp. The soldiers seemed to be worried, and were talking to each other about something. They spoke with fear and dread, and I decided to eavesdrop on a soldier's conversation. It went like this:

Soldier 1: Hey, I'm very concerned about the current situation.

Soldier 2: Yeah, me too. Whatever the Americans dropped back in Hiroshima was pretty worrying. All these mutated people are too much to handle ! 

Soldier 1: I wonder why they are demolishing the city, I don't see why they would need to cover up only a few mutations.

Soldier 2: I think that we are unaware of most things that have happened in Hiroshima. I saw some other side effects, such as excessive growth of hair, hallucinations, and much more. And I think that rumour of  that immortal guy is true. One of my friends said he saw him with his own eyes !

Soldier 1: All of this is just too stressful and confusing. I'll talk to you later, ok ?

I was amazed, and I went back to my tent to tell my wife about what I heard. But, suddenly, I felt a stabbing pain in my back. Before I could react, I fell unconscious and everything around me went black.

 I opened my eyes, and I was on some sort of bed. A government official was standing over me, and greeted me as soon as I woke up. "Hello. As you know, you have recently gained immortality from a mutation. Because of this, we need you to agree to something." "Who are you, and where am I ?" I said, visibly scared. "Calm down. I am a government official, and we need you to agree to keep everything that has happened a complete secret." The government official said, in a serious voice. "Uhhh, ok ? When do I sign this agreement ?" I replied, staring at the official. "As soon as you can." replied the official. He then handed me a piece of paper and a pen. I signed it, and he smiled. "Good, now you can go. We have sorted out a cottage for you and your wife to stay in" 

I got up off the bed, and some soldiers gave me my belongings. I walked out of the building and I soon realised that I was in a military base. I was guided to the exit, and I saw my wife. She was relieved to see me, and we walked out of the military base and drove to our new home.

That is all I remember, and ever since I have grown more curious as to what exactly happened. Every time I  look on the internet, I just see images of mushroom clouds, destruction, and fake accounts of what happened. I know that I am one of the only true survivors that is still alive today, and soon I will be the only one. I do not fear telling you about this, as I am immortal and the government can't kill me. Everyday I wonder if the US still possesses that bomb. I hope that they have destroyed it, because the mutations I've seen are horrific.

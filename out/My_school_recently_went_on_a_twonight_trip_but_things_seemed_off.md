Last week,my class of 35 (19 boys and 16 girls), went on a two night long trip to an activity manor/hotel as part of leaving primary school. each dorm/room fitted 9/10 people,and each activity group held 7/8 people. We were also served breakfast,lunch and dinner for the 2.5 days we were there for.

The coach ride from our school to the manor was around 1 hour, and we had lunch upon arrival,before heading to our groups. We then went to our first two activities,which were a giant swing and high ropes. Later in the night, after dinner, we had a evening disco to round the night off. After goofing off and ding-dong-ditching eachother’s rooms, we headed inside our dorms which consisted of 5/6 bunk beds,and a bathroom. My dorm consisted of me,mason,James,Lenny,Jonathan,Bailey,and Frankie. We played games until around 10 at night when the lights went out. That’s when things got strange.

With our energy,and the tapping of the curtain on the window, we couldn’t sleep,and around an hour after lights out, we got an unexpected knock on our door from Will, from the boys dorm across from us, he seemed disturbed and came in,almost in a rush. He explained that his dorm (will,josh,Lewis,Isaac,Jamie and Tyler) were also goofing of before lights out,and the staff also called them to bed,but just now, Jamie looked out of their window, and saw a 7ft tall silhouette stood near the canoe like across the field, and alerted the others.

Will was instructed by Lewis to come in here to bring us over to look,but when we got there, we saw the 7ft shadow run towards the forest instantly.

The next morning, all we could talk about was the shadow, and apparently, our classes girls dorms could see it too.The next morning,the figure was all anyone could talk about.We discussed our theories,and I googled of any incidents at the manor. I found nothing…until.

A child, Who was not named,had drowned in the lake in the 90s, and now haunts the grounds for Jacob Sanderson,the boy who pushed her in to the lake,knowing she couldn’t swim.

She goes for any boy with blonde hair,and semi tanned skin,the perfect description……..of Josh.

And then I saw it,in the shadows it stood,motionless,staring at his head.

The evening came fast and it was campfire night,which was terror at least,as in the forest it was,where the shadow stood behind josh,behind the trees.

Night came down and it was horror movie like. Another knock from will,but this time,he was pale,and shaking with fear,this is what he said happened.

They were all laying in bed after lights out,and the bathroom door creaked open, so they turned on their torches, to find nothing,but upon turning them off,the shadow ran to Josh’s bunk in the darkness. He could feel it’s presence a mere millimetres away so he jumped out of bed into Jamie’s in fear,and was dragged away into the darkness of the bathroom,and he’s been missing ever since.

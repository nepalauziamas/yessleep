We moved to this house a little over a month ago. My parents had been wanting to move for over a year by that point, since the day my little sister drowned. She was only 8. Abby was playing down by the lake when I noticed she had left her teddy bear in the kitchen. She never went anywhere without that thing, so being the good big bro I am, I figured I would bring it to her. That is when I found her. Her pale lifeless body floating in that water with an odd serenity still haunts me. I have kept her bear close ever since.

My parents spent their entire life savings to move all the way across the country. They did not necessarily want to, but they just couldn't stay in our old town. This house was the only one within their price range, an old colonial house that has seen better days. We figured that was why it was so cheap. How wrong we were.

When we first arrived at our new home I walked around it, amazed by the sheer size of it, the autumn leaves crunching beneath my feet. At the back of the house was a small basement window barely an inch above the ground, dusty books covered with cobwebs prevented me from looking inside.

As I lay in bed trying to fall asleep on the first night, I heard a gentle knocking on my door. I make my way over there, still half asleep, I take a look at my alarm clock and notice the power has gone out. Moments before I open up the door the knocking stops, and where I expected my dad to be in need of help restoring the power, there was only darkness.

The next morning my dad said he would need me to hold the flashlight while he fixes the power, I have never exactly been a handyman, unlike him. The fuse box was in the basement, but try as we might, and we did, the door would not open. None of the keys would unlock it.

And all of the locksmiths we called were happy to take our business, until we mentioned our address. Suddenly they had too much work, or a family emergency, one was even less subtle and just hung up as soon as I mentioned my name. I guess word really did get around quickly in small towns such as these.

Mom returned from the store with propane tanks as suddenly the power came back on. Eventually we ended up having to call a locksmith from the city to come all the way out here, but he wouldn't have an opening for at least two weeks.

When I was brushing my teeth later that night, I noticed it for the first time. I dropped the tooth brush and held onto the sink so as to not fall. Behind me in the mirror was Abby. When I turned around there was no one there, but looking in the mirror once again, there she was.

Her dress, the same one she had been wearing that day, was soaking wet, as was her hair, and beneath her feet was a pool of water. The knocking from the night before came to mind and I

wondered if it had been her. While I thought this, she nodded. For the next two weeks I kept seeing her in reflective surfaces, and I was overjoyed, though she could not speak.

After the locksmith finally opened up the basement door, My dad and I walked down the old creaking stairs. The basement was pitch black, without any source of light. But with some flashlights we gazed upon the massive hoard of junk left behind by previous residents of this house.

Among them was a great big old mirror in which I saw Abby, as I had gotten used to by now. She seemed different though, her usual somewhat sad expression was now replaced with one of joy and the biggest smile I have ever seen. Neither my dad or my mom, who came in after us, seemed to be able to see her.

As sleep was eluding me later that night the gentle knocking soon returned and I made my way to the door once again, this time it did not cease as I approached. and when I opened the door, Abby stood there. I fell to my knees while crying and hugged my dead sister, her body was so cold and wet.

For a long time all I could say was her name over and over again, when I somewhat regained my senses I asked her if she needed to warm up. She said she did not feel the cold. It was her voice, just as I remembered it. Exactly as I remembered it. Moments later she was gone and all that had remained was a wet puddle where she had stood.

That takes us to today. My parents were both stuck at work all day, and as I was making myself some dinner when I heard footsteps coming from above. When I went to check it out, I heard someone running from the direction of my room. The second I set foot inside I notice Abby's bear is gone. I turn around and see a trail of a little girl's wet footsteps, and I figured she took the bear and is trying to play some sort of game with me.

I followed the footsteps downstairs past the kitchen into the hallway and they stopped before the basement door. I turned on the flashlight on my phone and made my way down the stairs again. As I walked through the maze of junk my phone's battery suddenly began acting up and my flashlight started failing on me. When I shined it onto the left wall just before it went out I saw the books blocking the window and when I took them down I heard an inhuman screech.

Scared half to death I turned around and saw a car sized monstrosity most like a spider, desperately trying to cover its eyes as it retreated back into the darkness. I ran out of the basement and back up the stairs holding one of the books as I made my escape, I lit it on fire and dropped it in the hallway, when I passed the kitchen I turned on the propane tanks. I was standing out in the backyard before I even realized it.

It did not take long. Police and firefighters are on their way, I hear the sirens in the distance. There's a good chance I'll either be sent to prison or a mental health facility. That is why I am typing this out on my phone, to get the word out there before they take it away. And just now, I watched my dead little sister bash open the basement window with her head. She wasn't wet anymore, her eyes were black, and vaguely spider like appendages were retreating into its human form. So, now you will understand why I burned our house down.

Unfortunately, it seems fire cannot kill it, and as it made its way to the woods I realized I had set it free.

 I am completely exhausted and drenched in warm gooey blood. My legs feel like they will give out any moment. All of me is sore and aches. Still, standing is better than sitting in this disgusting blood-soaked snow, and I know I need to move soon or I will freeze to death. 

Nothing will redeem the sin I just committed, I love her so much, she will always be with me, no matter what.
I know I'm going to hell. I have no doubt. I don't give two shits. I carry her limp body through the thick mounds of snow.

 I press my lips quickly to hers for a soft kiss, her jacket is also splattered with blood. It's the blood that saved her life, I'm sure of it, at least that's what I want to tell her.

 A trail of blood follows behind me, she's here with me. And she always will be. That means that there is no way I can ever fall out of her love, no way she ever could. No matter how much I try to hate her, or myself, I cannot fall out of her love.

 The sky darkens as it falls to night, I take a chunk a meat for myself and one for her, ill make she's eats, I always do. The meat is raw, cold, and in large chunks, but it will keep US alive. 

I lay her down on my lap, I kiss her Icey blue lips. She will always be apart of me. I want to say this, but there are no words that can explain my love for her.

The snow and darkness envelops us, and I will her to be safe in my arms. I need her to. I'm going to find OUR way of this mountain, for OUR sake. I need to make sure she's safe, that's all I want. That's all I need.

 As the sun begins to rise, the blizzard begins to die down. I realize I'm not as cold as I was, I'm not trapped anymore, and I find myself laughing. I see a village in the distance, as my laughing begins to fade I run towards it with her in my arms.

I'll find redemption. I'll find a way. I'll make things right. We'll be together, I'll make sure of it. Things can only go up from here.

One of the villagers see US covered in blood, they run towards us with the promise of help. They suddenly stop in pure horror. 

"What the fuck did you do?" The villager says while pointing to her missing chunks of flesh. 

“What do you mean? She’s dying, please help her.” I say erratically. I lay down her body, I feel her heartbeat, nothing. I begin panic, then start to preform CPR.

 My lips touch hers while I press down on her rips attempting to revive her cold body. Tears are rolling down my cheeks, the snowy floor burns my legs.

 I move my face up to hers and discover a chunk of her jaw missing, seemingly chewed off. I stare in shock as a look at the rest of her body. Chewed bloody chunks are spread everywhere. 

“What have I done?”

She will now always be apart of me.

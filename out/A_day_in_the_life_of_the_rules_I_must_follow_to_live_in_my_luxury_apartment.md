As the title says, I wanted to document my daily life, to show other people how I’m managing to get by and beat inflation.

I live in a luxury apartment, with a cash hemorrhaging stay at home job. A got a cat, a small dog, and as much introversion you can put in a person before it’s a disorder.

The trade off was the long, length list of almost repetitive rules they gave me in my lease.

“Is this really necessary?” I asked, expecting a joke. “Rule 59, showers should only be taken from 6am to 9am, as it will anger the drain monster? What does that even mean? No elaboration at all, just a vague threat? This can’t be legal!”

“Well, you don’t *have* to sign.” The landlord (more like parasite amirite guys) cooed, almost dangling the lease in front of me. “We have a waiting list, we’d be happy to give your indoor heated parking spot to someone else.”

“Wait, what?”

I live in Wisconsin, so they had me at a “heated parking spot.” I signed the lease, and read the list of rules again more carefully.

I laughed at first, it was a random assortment of rules that didn’t seem to make any sense. None of them fed into another, there was no story to see behind them, it felt like a list of cheap scary concepts written up as a prank for the new tenants, so I stuck it to the fridge, unpacked, and went to bed.

I listen to the rules now. Instead of giving you a dry list of random bullshit, I’ll just give you my daily schedule.

***4:20 am:*** The smell of marijuana wakes me up. I’m not sure where it comes from, maybe the vents? Never been a fan of the stuff, let alone the smell. If I try to stay in bed, the smell just gets stronger, so I get up to make it dissipate.

***5:40 am:*** There’s a knock at the door. If I ignore it, it turns into banging, so I answer. An elderly man stands outside, staring intently at me. “I’m trying to come home.” He says, everyday.

“Sorry Eugene, I reply, this isn’t your home anymore, you died in 1984, remember?” I gave him his offering; a piece of gum and an original haiku, composed that morning.

The strange rule complete, the old man wanders off, probably to repeat the process at one of my neighbors doors.

***7:00 am:*** Start up my computer. According to the rules, my router's name is “Satan” and my password is “Rulez”. I tried doing something funnier, but the search engine took off on its own, going to some…incriminating sites, so I caved and changed it immediately to avoid being on a list.

***8:00 am:*** Coffee and shower break. The coffee must be light roast, anything else summons the Mold, and I’d rather not spend another afternoon scraping it off the walls again.

The shower water cannot be hot. I tried using warm water my first night, and came out to strange symbols and phrases written in the fog on my mirror. I supposed I could turn the fan on higher, leave the door open, but reading “YOU WILL DIE ALONE AND AFRAID” once on my mirror was enough, cold showers from here on out.

***9:14 am:*** I put my earphones in before the children start to sing from the vents, lasting exactly 12 minutes. I just listen to podcasts to avoid hearing them (two bears one cave is pretty funny). One neighbor told me her husband listened to the children singing once, and she couldn’t find him after he crawled into the vents and started screaming.

Podcasts it is.

***9:45 am:*** I munch down a quick breakfast, just to keep my morning energy and focus on work. No red food is allowed, it just turns into blood as soon as you try to eat it, no matter what it is. Which is a shame, I always liked red apples, but warm flowing copper doesn’t taste good, so I made the switch to granny smith.

***10:10 am:*** I light the candles around the circle. The imp crawls out of the void, same time everyday. He tips his hat, I toss him some sunflower seeds, and he crawls back to wherever he lives, which I guess is a void under my apartment.

***11:09 am:*** The stomping on the roof begins. I’ve learned to just ignore it, maybe listen to another podcast or something. I went outside to look at what was doing it once, and now I’ve got weird gray streaks in my hair, so I’d learn to just pretend you don’t hear it.

***12:30 pm:*** I get a half an hour for my break. The television won’t work between the hours of noon to three, so I don’t have anything exciting to watch unless I use my laptop. I tried watching tv on it before, but only one channel appears on this station. The channel shows a man, tied up to the wall almost naked except for a loincloth, grinning maniacally and staring at the camera without blinking. A little boring if you ask me, I’m not sure if any of the other neighbors watch it.

***3:23 pm:*** I actually have a nice break from the rules until now. I look out the window, seeing the grinning, floating outline of eyes and a smile. It appears outside everyday. I walk to the window, opening the glass (but not the screen) and say “All hail Retyoproetly, the glowing face” before it winks and vanishes into the sunlight like mist. This one’s kinda nice because it’s so quick, I don’t even have to log out or anything.

***4:20 pm:*** Remember the smell of weed that wakes me up? Yeah, it comes back again. The landlord/parasite stopped by once and noticed the smell. I started to panic, but she didn’t seem phased, which is how I figured it happens in every apartment also. Maybe a stoner died here and this is how he haunts us?

***5:15 pm:*** With work all done, I get on my exercise bike, ignoring the vivid hallucinations that exercising in the apartment brings. They said not to do it, but again, it’s Wisconsin, you can't exactly take a walk for about half of the year. So I pedal as I ignore the screaming skeletons chained to my wall, pretend I don’t see the animals grinning at me from behind trees that aren’t really there, and tune out of the voices telling me to drink bleach or hang myself.

***6:00 pm:*** another shower, this time the cold water feels better.

***7:39 pm:*** Eat some cheap meal that’s easy to make because I’m too lazy to cook. I drop some of my mac and cheese down the sink so the Drain Monster doesn’t come nibble on my toes in the night. It kinda tickles, but also hurts a bit.

***8:00 pm:*** Usually crack open a beer. The only type of beer I cannot have in the apartment is Pabst blue ribbon. A buddy bought a six pack of pbr once, and the appreciation of a large white man in a wife beater drunkenly stumbled to him and beat the hell out of him.

Man the ghosts here kinda suck.

***9:15 pm:*** Between the beer and the day, I usually start to get ready for bed. I go into the guest room, which only appears between 9-10 pm, and say goodnight to the kids, who look up at me thankfully with black eyes. They all chant back “thanks” and lay down. As soon as I turn around, the room is gone.

***1:00 am:*** Get up in the middle of the night to let the dog in. No, I don’t have a dog, one shows up every night at this time, and if I don’t let it in and snuggle with me, it’ll break in and attack me. Easy choice, this one.

There’s many more, tons of arbitrary shit too tedious and stupid to list here.

“Every Thursday you must avoid speaking negatively about women, lest the dark woman come to you in the night”

“Once a month, the wolves will come knocking. Do not let them in, or you’ll join them.”

“If you get the feeling you aren’t alone in your apartment, do not panic. They will see you?”

Is it worth living here? I gave you a quick sample, but you can ask me for more details if you'd like, there's a rule for EVERYTHING here. It’s a great place overall, minus all the stupid rules and adjustments to my daily life.

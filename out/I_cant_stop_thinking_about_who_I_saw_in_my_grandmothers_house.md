I want to start this off by saying this happened years ago. I was around the age of 11, I think, and this took place on New Years/New Years eve. I was staying at my grandmothers because my mom was out on her annual work conference and my dad just didn't want to take care of me. It was just me and my grandmother (and her two dogs) in her slightly rural house. It was deep in the woods off of a small town. The road she lived on the be exact lead down to the docks, where a new years celebration was happening.

Now that you have all the important little details, I want to talk about my dilemma.

I keep scrolling through tiktok and seeing these post about "alternates". I know they are meant to just scare people, as I know they aren't real, but they always remind me of the Man I swear I saw in my Grandmothers house that night.

The two of us were sitting watching the new years ball drop on television, because that's all to really do at her place. We stayed up until maybe 12:20, but because I was still young she wanted me to go to bed. Around this time in my life, I had really bad separation anxiety and couldn't sleep along without panicking so I slept with her. 

Her room was on the other side of a LARGE one story house. This house was huge because, before my grandfathers death, they wanted to rent to potential boaters who like to stay in the area during the summer. This really isn't too important, but it can be scary when all the lights are off and you feel like you have to walk 1/4 of a mile to get to the kitchen.

I went to bed with my grandmother after she finished getting ready. I had been a bit nervous all day because this was one of my first trips without either of my parents. She fell asleep before me, I could tell because she snores. I didn't fall asleep too long after but had a really horrible nightmare. You know the type of dreams that feel like they lasted days? Yeah, that sort of dream but making it absolutely horrifying. 

The dream it's self was very off. The dream took place at my elementary school. My dream started off with me being on the playground with friends, but we were soon rushed inside when they saw a tall man watching us from the corner of the play ground on the "friend bench". The friend bench was used for people who were lonely and were looking for someone to play with.

Once we were inside, the school went into lockdown mode. Our teacher, Ms.M, was panicking but I was still hanging out with my friends Melissa and Rachel. Melissa and Rachel didn't seem to care about what was going on and were making jokes about it. The lockdown ended rather quickly after the police came and said "We couldn't find anyone here or in the forest"

My class, for whatever reason, decided to go back outside. When we were outside we found the tall man again, but this time he was with another girl. The girl had a large music box which she was cranking and singing to. The teacher didn't seem to notice him at first and he began talking to me in my dream. He said things like: "Come with me", "Why are you here?", "Do you need help?", etc. I didn't say much to him other than "I want to play with my friends". 

Soon after that happened, my teacher rushed us back into the school. This time the girl and the man stayed on the playground and the girl continued to crank the music box. The girl, herself, was very pretty and reminded me of the porcine dolls I had. She wouldn't move or talk. She would just be sitting somewhere cranking the box.

While we were in lockdown #2, and let me remind you this is still just my dream, the police never came. We were stuck in the building for days in my dream. The man, at some point, managed to enter the building and roamed the halls. The class was starting to get hungry so me, Melissa, and Rachel decided to go get some food. 

I somehow to manage to lose them in the hallway and I ran into the man again. This time he was really close to me. He had a face, just not one you could make out though being inches away. He wore a black suit and had extremely pale skin. He looked down at me, getting even closer, and I could see he had eyes. The kind of eyes that could stare through my soul. He touched me and that is when I wake up to the sound of the house alarms.

My grandmother house had alarms because one of her neighbors was crazy and on drugs. He'd tried to get in before, but we hadn't heard from him in years and assumed he was dead. 

As my eyes began to open, I was still next to my grandmother. I could hear a faint sound of music in the distance and saw someone in the hallway (There wasn't a door because it connected to my grandmothers office). I tried to tell my grandmother, but I felt like I must mute and couldn't make a single sound. The man, who I recognized was the one from my dreams, was staring at me. He was a good couple feet away, but it was undoubtedly him. I would know what he looked like- as he was only inches away from me in my dream.

He stood their standing and just watching me. I was crying, but still couldn't scream. He wasn't smiling from what I could tell. I turned my head, as it was the only part of my body I could move, towards the window. That's when I saw the girl.

She was staring back at me. She look concerned for me, but was still cranking and singing. Horrified and unsure what to do I look back into the hallway and he was gone. My grandmother was also gone. I turned back to the window and the girl was gone as well. Then I could move.

I got up and looked around and went searching for my grandmother. My grandmother ended up being in the bathroom. She was confused on why I was up so early and I asked her about the man in the house. She told me that "The alarm was never ringing, there was never a man". She had also mentioned that if there was a man her dogs would have started freaking out, because they hate men.

I my day continued on as normal, but nothing seemed right. I knew that man was there. I knew he wouldn't have a hard time running away or hiding because that's what he did in my dreams. I went home a few days later, but if I ever spend new years at my grandmothers that man appears.

He doesn't seem to do much and I honestly don't have any clue who he is. The girl stopped showing up though. I don't know why, but she just did. I don't have dreams about them anymore either, I just see the man right before I wake up on New Years Eve. 

Luckily for me, that house has been sold since last year. I feel like whatever he is, he will leave me alone now, but whenever I see those damn tiktoks I can still imagine him in the hallway to the bed room.

The events in this account happened between 2011-2012 in a suburb of Sacramento, California

It was the summer of 2011. I was a 21 year old man living in a cramped apartment with my friends and had a pretty wild lifestyle. One of my friends brought a new girlfriend to a party, we can call her Allison. We got to talking and it turned out that she lived alone in an apartment close by. Me, wanting a better living situation, decided it would be advantageous to steal this girl from my buddy and move in with her. That's exactly what I did. I had no idea that this decision was going to alter the course of my life forever. 

The energy in this girl's apartment was unreal. I noticed it from the very first time I walked in. It was like as soon as you walked through the door you felt yourself entering a new dimension. I was not the only person to feel this way, but Allison herself was oblivious to it. Being interested in the paranormal I surveyed the place in an attempt to find "hotspots" of activity. I found that the little closet in the bathroom containing the water-heater had an incredibly terrifying energy as well as the walk-in closet in the only bedroom. 

I worked full-time but this girl was unemployed living on government assistance and money from family. She would just stay home all day. In the beginning things were pretty normal but eventually I started coming home to find her sitting in this walk-in closet all alone. Door closed behind her and everything. Sometimes I would walk into the bedroom unnoticed and hear her talking in there. When I would open the door she would just look up at me with an innocent expression like "can I help you"? 

After telling some friends about the vibe in this apartment and my girlfriend's strange behaviour we decided to do a Ouija session there. We make a homemade spirit board on the back of a guitar with sharpee. Long story short we get all the classic responses one would hope for. The name John, the word murder and other creepy tidbits. We were drinking and taking it half-seriously. We decide to finish and a friend says we need to close the board with some hocus pocus. We decide not to just to be dicks even though we knew about the possible consequences and actually believed them. 

A few days go by with no real incidents besides a very noticeable increase in the heavy atmosphere in the bathroom. (I had stopped going into the bedroom closet at this point because the energy was already unbearable) Allison and I go to bed on what seems like a very normal evening and it is here that our story truly begins. 

It Is a dark and rainy night. We live on the second floor. A distant dim streetlight, flush with our window, is the only light. I have not yet fallen asleep but am just thinking with eyes closed as one does. I am calmed by the sound of the rain and my thoughts are pleasant. Despite this, my eyes suddenly shoot open. Instinctively I direct my gaze to the sketchy closet which lies in front of me off to the left. I become aware that there is a 3-dimensional shadow moving towards the bed from the open closet. I am laying on the side of the bed with the whole room to my left and she is sleeping on the side against a wall. I am not terrified or panicked as with sleep paralysis. I have in fact experienced sleep paralysis most of my life and this was not the same. I am completely vulnerable and basically just waiting for this thing to get close to me to see what happens. I am laying on my back head turned to the side looking straight as this entity as it is now  standing beside me. It extends a dark arm over me almost as a mother would do to comfort her child. I feel nothing as I am taken into a spiritual dimension. 

I have no body. I am blind, deaf, mute, unfeeling and yet have a complete understanding of my surroundings. There is nothing. Truly nothing. I am in a dimension where nothing exists besides my spirit and this shadow entity and I am instantly aware of this. We communicate with a sort of telepathy. I hear no spoken words, I simply become aware of what this thing is saying in a way more vivid, descriptive and concrete than human speech. I was also able to speak in this way. 

This creature's desire was almost comically simple. He wanted to have sex with my girlfriend. He explained that we could make a deal where he would basically "ride shotgun" in my body. He would have access to my thoughts and to my bodily systems and experience everything as I do but would under no circumstances control my actions. He listed some benifits i would have if I accepted. 

1: I would no longer have to eat, drink water or sleep in order to survive. 
2: I could become sexually irresistable to any female 
3: I could take as many drugs and drink as much booze as I wanted and by no means overdose or injure my body in any way. 

I accepted. 

Immediately I am returned to my room in a fully awake state. I am still laying on my back. From the light in the room I can tell that almost no time had passed. Needless to say I am wondering if it was all a dream. I am staring at the light being cast on the wall from outside when I see a humanlike shadow crawl across the entire outside of the window spiderman-style and dissappear. We live on the second floor. I am freaked out. I wake up Allison and say we are going to sleep on the floor in the living room. She begrudgingly agrees. We make a nest of blankets out there and I turn on the tv for some sound and light. 

I close my eyes and prepare to drift off into neverland and put this all behind me when I am startled by the feeling of hands all over my face and body. Not painful or attacking just like 10 people were pressing their hands on my skin simultaneously. I jump to my feet gasping. Allison wakes up and asks what is happening. I give the cliché "there is something weird going on in here". Immediately I walk down the hall and close the doors to the bedroom and bathroom. As soon as I return to the living room I hear a hefty thud coming from the bedroom. I look at Allison and she helpfully nods to let me know she heard it too and I'm not losing my mind. We sneak to the closed bedroom door and I press my ear to it. It's dead silence. I open the door and flick the lightswitch while still standing outside the room. We walk in together and it's just this surreal moment of instantly realizing what happened while at the same time just not being able to believe it. 

The only piece of furniture we had in the bedroom besides the bed was a tall, narrow and deceptively heavy bookshelf with a small tv on it. This bookshelf stood in a corner of the room opposite of the closet door. The bookshelf had somehow been moved along the wall clear across the room and was now resting against another wall behind the open closet door. We could see scrapes in the paint along the entire wall were it had been dragged. We turned and went to the living room. I said "get dressed, we are leaving". We left the apartment as quickly as we could without even turning the lights or the tv off. As I locked the front door curiosity got the best of me and I put my ear to the door to listen. Within mere seconds we heard crashing from all over the living room. Enough was enough, I didn't even want to know. We walked into the drizzle in the middle of the night and hopped in my truck. 

I drove just a little bit away from our small isolated apartment complex into a more residential area and parked on the side of the road. There we sat. No idea what to do or where to go. I honestly don't remember what we talked about but I remember the terror wore off and the mood gradually became lighter to the point were we started laughing about our situation and what was happening. The truck had been off for awhile and the windows were fogged up from all the breathing and talking, so it was not hard to notice when hand prints started appearing all over the windshield and side windows. Hell no. I started the truck and we drove about 20 miles to my workplace, parked there and just waited for the sun to rise.

I awoke to being baked alive in my truck by the California summer sun just in time to begin an inevitably interesting workday. I worked as a carpet cleaner so my day would consist of driving from house to house with a partner and cleaning carpets. The first person I met at work was my partner, Ted. Ted was a 53 year-old no-nonsense type of guy. He greeted me by pointing out that I look and smell like complete shit. I foolishly tried to explain the night I had just had and was completely written off like I was just trying to make excuses for being hungover. What did I expect? We load up some gear and hit the road in our work van. 

Our first customer lived way out in the farmland parts of Sacramento far away from the city about an hour drive. I remember Ted trying to make smalltalk and me just pretending to be interested. As we got closer I took out a turkey sandwich that Ted's wife had kindly prepared for me. I was starving and needed to eat it right then and there to be able to work. We drove slowly through various farms and I found myself completely entranced by the animals. I remember fantasizing about just ripping the cows apart with my bare hands and stuffing the raw flesh and organs into my mouth. I was so deep in this perverse fantasy that I didn't realize I had crushed my turkey sandwich into a gooey ball in my now mustard-stained fist. Ted gave me a look like... Well, like what you would I guess. 

As we drove down our customer's long driveway there were various animals of all kinds on both sides of the road. I noticed quickly that every, and I mean every, animal absolutely panicked as we drove by. Cows moo'd, horses neighed, sheep bleated and dogs barked. We knock on the customers door and are let inside. Immediately a golden retriever runs up to greet us but as soon as it gets close it jumps in the air and scurries away barking and crying. I swear it was the closest thing I've ever heard to a dog screaming. The owner apologized and said the dog is not normally like that. I myself am a huge dog lover and have never had a dog react to me like that before or since. We work. It's boring. We leave. The rest of the day goes by without anything memorable happening. 

I get off work and it occurs to me for the first time that Allison has just been here stuck in the parking lot in the burning heat waiting for me all day. We decide to drive back home, we don't really have a choice. I'm nervous as I unlock the door because I know that we heard stuff crashing all around before we left. It was more a question of how destroyed everything was going to be. We walk inside. The tv is still on as well as all the lights the way we left them. The only thing that was different was that there were aluminium cans littering the kitchen floor. We had a shopping basket on the kitchen counter full of cans for recycling. That is what made the crashing noise. It felt like a very small problem compared to what we had been imagining so we put them all back and went on with life. 

I slept like a baby that night. It felt like for the first time there was peace in the apartment. I woke up feeling refreshed and ready for another day at work. I got there and found out I would be working alone that day. I drive to my first spot and its an empty apartment. I have to talk with the apartment manager to get the key for the place. This is a high-end property and everyone who works in the management office is just your typical beautiful, snobby, too-hot-for-you type of girl. I walk in and I notice that these women just kind of stop what they are doing and just start watching me with hawk eyes. I talk to the main one and she is being uncharacteristically sweet and giggly with me like a little girl. I found this very strange. I get the keys and head out. It was then that I heard the voice of the shadow for the first time.

 My thoughts were suddenly intruded on by a clear voice just introducing itself. It explained that it had successfully merged with my body and that the contract was now effective. We would have constant communication with each other from that point foreward. We spent the entire rest of the day just talking to each other inside my head. I could ask it anything and it would answer. I asked if it was a man or a woman and it answered "neither but you can think of me as a man." I asked him how old he was and he answered "Ancient". I asked if he was a demon. He said "you can think of me that way" . I asked if he wanted to know anything about me and he said "it's unnecessary". I asked if the things he said during the agreement were true. "try tonight" he responded. "but don't forget about the girl". 

Now is a good time to explain the relationship I had with "the girl". This being my girlfriend Allison. I did not love her, not ever. I did not even like her. I did not find her particularly attractive and thought she was extremely stupid and annoying. I had basically been using her for a place to live. I continued my relationship with her solely to please this entity inside me. 

Now begins the part where it is impossible to be detailed. I can not list specific events in any logical order. The next 6 months can only be described as a catyclysmic downward spiral of insanity. The demonic presence inside me attracted certain things like a magnet. Without any effort on my part I found myself swimming in drugs and easy sex. Living the debaucherous life of a rockstar despite being a skinny blue-collar nobody. I didn't pay for anything. I stayed up for weeks at a time just drinking, smoking, screwing, dropping, eating shrooms literally whatever and I would just go to work like nothing happened. This went on for months with everything just getting bigger and more depraved every day. All my old friends who knew what I was doing broke contact with me and I couldn't have cared less. I was invincible and all I had to do was shag this girl every few days to maintain this status. As easy as that seemed, it was about to become the only thing I couldn't do. 

At a party I met a girl and fell instantly in love with her. It got to the point where I was barely coming home to my girlfriend anymore and just staying out with this new girl. This did not make my demonic partner happy. At first he gave somewhat polite reminders to go home and have sex with Allison but the less I did it the more irritated he would become. One night I was spending the night with the new girl on a couch in the woods. I decided that night that I would break up with Allison and never sleep with her again. We fell asleep together, me and my new girlfriend. 

I fell asleep as a healthy young man in his prime and woke up the next morning as a rail-thin husk of human being who could barely move. I felt 50 years older. This new girl litterally screamed when she saw me. She had to help me to sit up on the couch as I could not bend my back or legs at all and was in so much pain. I had no choice, I had to see my parents. 

When my mom saw me she just cried it was the first time she had seen me in a long time and I was clearly not doing well. Everything the cigarettes, booze, drugs sleepless nights etc. that this demon had been sheltering me from the consequences of rushed over my mind and body in a single night. He had left me, he was gone.

This was not the end of the story but i will end briefly. The demon existed outside of my body and continued following me around terrorizing me wherever I went. I was left with a collapsed psoas muscle and needed to go to extensive rehab to regain strength amd the use of my back and legs. Doctors were very confused by these injuries and could not understand how I could have sustained them. Life went on though and eventually I left to travel Europe. While in Stockholm, Sweden a random girl came up and asked if she could pray for my back injury. I had not said anything about a back injury to her. I allowed her to pray and my back instantly felt better than it had in years. This led to us having a relationship. 

One night the demon appeared to me at her apartment and terrified, she suggest that I pray to Jesus. I did this and the presence dissappeared immediately. 

The next time the demon attacked was a few months later and I decided to get baptised and since that day I have never heard from or seen it again. I am now married to this girl, living demon-free in Sweden and playing christian rock music. What a journey it has been.

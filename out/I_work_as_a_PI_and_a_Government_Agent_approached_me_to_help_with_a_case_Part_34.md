After the encounter with a ghost, it was a bit difficult to get back on my feet again. I could tell Nick felt worried about the aftermath of such a case. He started dropping by my apartment more often with small gifts, or food. No matter how much I assured him I felt fine, he would be at my door the next day with something in hand. What got me back into the office is he dropped of an entire bag of oranges. With way I could eat this many, I brought them in for Jimmy and Tippie. They’ve done just fine without their boss for a few days. Aside from a pile of paper work needed to still be filed, the office in running order.  

I met Jimmy outside the office just as she arrived. Someone also with her and she appeared a little flustered that I caught them together. The other person a very tall and thin man, a bit on the attractive side. His teeth a bit too sharp and his handshake strong when Jimmy introduced me as her boss. I guessed he could be a half breed like her. With a small hint of red on her face, she told me he was her new boyfriend. They would drive into the office together and he would walk to the bus stop to get to work after. I noticed right away she avoided saying his name. I offered a few oranges to the pair which they accepted. 

“If he has a weird name, I won’t laugh.” I promised. 

They both looked at each other nervous I may break my word. 

“My mother named me Tupperware. I suppose that’s not the worst name in the world, it’s the last name that gets everyone...” He started. When I didn’t react to his first name, he felt comfortable enough sharing his full name. “It’s Johnson.” 

My face twitched and it took everything in me not to laugh. My shoulders shook and hands trembled. I received permission to let it out if I wanted, but I shook my head and leaned over determined not to laugh in their faces. It was a good idea to get out of my apartment that day. Who knew getting over a mental scar was as easy as hearing a bad name? My muffled giggling fit easily forgiven. He preferred to use his last name, so Johnson gave us a wave so he could start heading to work. From the sounds of it he wasn’t very happy with his part time job. I told Jimmy I would pay him if he could help with the filing as another part time gig. She pretty glad by the offer. It would help him out a lot and they could see each other more often. 

I stayed doing regular jobs for once. Some creatures came into the office looking for some help, but most requests could be dealt with a trip to the corner store or digging around the box of treats I wisely stored beside the desk. 

It was a day that really helped me to get back into a normal frame of mind. After seeing how much I improved Nick was finally comfortable enough to bring me along for a case. A file just came through and he picked it up for us.  

“There has been an ongoing issue with supernatural creatures creating cults, or using humans to summon them to different worlds. The Corporation is able to investigate and cover up most of these events.” 

He stood by my apartment door explaining what we would be dealing with as I got ready. Our job to be in a ghost town as it were, in the middle of a desert. I needed to double check I brought along enough water and nearly forgot sunscreen. While he spoke I looked through my small closet trying to find a hat for the trip.  

“I don’t mean to derail you, but what’s with the shoes?” I asked when I noticed Nick a bit taller than he should be. 

He looked down at his shoes. The heels were higher than normal. It still a professional pair that went well with his suit, but a bit more feminine than usual.   

“My previous pair was damaged yesterday. These were the only ones on hand. They are what I did not wear on the Twin Lizard case.” 

He did buy a few outfits for that case. I never thought about what he did with the clothing that didn’t get ruined. And where the makeup ended up. I assume Nick gave it away. I’d hoped we never needed to dress him up for bait. If we did, he must have kept it all just in case.  

“That makes sense. What about this cult stuff?” I got us back on topic. 

I found a few old dusty hats to pick from. Nick humored me as I put one on him as he spoke, not really reacting to how I pulled his ponytail through the back to see how he looked in a baseball cap. 

“The town is empty. There have been signs of summoning, but a lack of creatures or humans. Our task is simply to take photos and clear the area. If we come across a creature, we are to call for backup due to this being a case with an unknown culprit behind the summoning.” 

Nick made no move to remove the hat. He would have kept it on for the entire case if I didn’t decide a baseball cap didn’t suit him. When I picked one out and was packed, we were ready to go. I wasn’t looking forward to being in a very hot desert looking for any traces a cult left behind. There wasn't even any guarantee that whatever was summoned left the area. At least this time we would have some backup if needed.  

A quick charm later and we stepped into an overly hot abandoned town looking like it belonged in a western. The main road only a handful of building ready to fall apart and bleached from the sun. At the end of the road stood the only modern buildings. One gift shop, and one small hotel for tourists. No one around from the entire place being closed off after the summoning was discovered. Nick started down the dusty road and I was having trouble keeping up with his long strides. He slowed down when he noticed his partner lagging behind.  

The summoning circle found inside the jailhouse earlier that day. There was cell above ground and below ground. Thankfully, what we were looking for waited in the below ground cell. It much cooler there. The walk short but I was already drenched in sweat by the time we arrived to the basement. The walls made of loose bricks and floor of simple packed dirt. Nick needed to light a lantern for us to see in the dim room. In the middle of the floor sat a circle with spell work drawn around it. A few other items left behind. Some claws, some candles. And some medal statues I didn’t know what they should represent. It smelled of mold and dried blood. I guessed the circle and spell work was drawn in what I hoped to be animal blood. 

In the middle of the circle sat something else. Two large and cracked open eggshells the size of ostrich eggs sat. Nick leaned over to pick one up. Going over it in his hands, he tried to figure out what it belonged to. Whatever hatched, long gone. 

I took over taking photos of everything I could, trying my best to get all the needed details. While I took the photos, I noticed some tracks in the dusty floor. Pointing them out to Nick, he got down low to look them over. A set of boot prints ran along side the strange dotted prints. As if whatever hatched from the eggs started following behind a person.  

“Any ideas on what this might be?” I asked after a long pause.  

“I am not certain. I would like to investigate a mine nearby to confirm my suspicions.” 

I did not like the sounds of being in an old abandoned mine. Caves freaked me out. Too many bad horror movies when I was younger tainted my idea of them. Nick straightened up and handed over my gun and holster he’d been holding onto until that point. If we saw something inside the cave, we were to leave and call for help. I still needed a weapon in case that wasn’t possible. The moment we reached the top of the stairs, my cell phone started to go off. Nick let me answer it. 

My sister called and tried to get a hold of me the entire time we were down in the jailhouse basement. It unprofessional taking a personal call while on a case, but Nick was fine with it. He said he would meet me by the gift shop to give me some privacy. My sister sounded frantic. Her car broke down and she needed to get into work in two days. Without any money to get the car fixed, she feared she would end up spending too much on cab fairs to get to work leaving them without grocery money for a week.  

I’ve been sending her money since I moved out. After accepting cases with Nick, I’d been sending her more. Most of what I earned went into a savings account to buy her a house when I got enough. She was raising two kids and I didn’t think a boyfriend currently in the picture. I promised her I would send her some extra money when I got done work. Thinking through my savings I decided then I could afford to just buy her a new car. Better than her trying to repair an old junk heap over and over again. With that sorted, I hung up and left to find Nick.  

He waited inside the empty gift shop looking at some lizard art for sale. If we had time after the case, we should really come back to buy him something. There also a wide variety of cowboy hats. We could not move on with the job unless I took a few photos of Nickie wearing different colored ones.  

“Was your phone call important?” He asked from under the brim of a glittery pink cowboy hat I’d placed on his head. 

“Sort of. My sister was having money issues so I told her I would send some over when I could.” I told him a little surprised how well he could pull off wearing anything in pink. 

I’ve never really spoken to him about my sister, or gone into details about why my family kicked me out. It all in the past and something I never thought important enough to sit down and explain. He never asked, just like I never asked about his previous partner. If it wasn’t for my sister, I would have been on the street. I lived with her for three years and finished school. Then we gotten into a huge fight and I moved out. I still loved her, and we spoke pretty often. She didn’t know about Nick though. He would be impossible to explain without going into what kind of work I was doing now. 

“You are a very responsible brother.” 

Nick’s answer made me a bit embarrassed. I didn’t feel as if I went out of my way for her. I just did what I could and it felt natural. Hell, at this point if Nick ever had money problems, I would do the same for him. Being a brother really did influence how I acted around a lot of people. Most girls I’ve met now were like my sisters I cared about very dearly and would do anything for if they asked.  

“It’s not really a hard thing to do.” I shrugged off his compliment.  

As I started towards the door, I noticed Nick wasn’t following. 

“Are we buying this?” He said pointing towards the hat. 

I let out a laugh. He far too easy going for his own good. He didn’t want the hat, but would wear it if I thought it looked good on him. I put it back and told him I would consider it after our job got done. I really needed to start planning what kind of costume I would force him to wear on Halloween now that I knew how easy it could be to dress up my partner.  

The hike to the mine felt brutal. The fun conversation at the gift shop was quickly forgotten as I became miserable in the heat. We needed to stop ever few feet so I could take sips of water. How anyone lived in a place like this was beyond me. Even wearing a t-shirt and shorts, I nearly got overheated by the time we reached the opening of the cave. At least the further we went into the darkness, the cooler it became. I even forgot about how creepy caves were. Nick led the way with a flashlight. Our footsteps echoing off the glittering walls. When I cooled down, I focused on how the stone appeared to sparkle faintly when the flashlight beam went over it. My knowledge on rocks pretty light. I thought any that sparkled might be worth something. That must not be the case if this mine became abandoned. 

I was unaware of what we may be looking for. Along the cave some ropes were set up to guide people through. They led into a main cavern. It opened up with a room of unlit lamps. Tours went through this place on occasion. Nick carried on, going to the end of the room and to an opening roped off. It covered with signs saying beyond that point was off limits. If someone disobeyed the signs, the tour company wasn’t responsible for any injuries. A sense of stress started to sink into my gut as I followed behind him deeper into the cave. 

I no longer had any idea of what we might come across. The small flashlight wasn’t enough to show the way through. My pack feeling heavier with each step. The pathway becoming tighter. After a while we needed to walk sideways to fit through and I needed to carry my pack in one hand. A sense of claustrophobia nearly over took my brain as the rocks dug into my back. I didn’t even think I was scared of tight spaces until that point. Nick must have noticed how stressed I got. In the dark, he reached out to take a hold of the hem of my shirt. His face looking forwards and as emotionless as ever. In the short few months we’ve been working together, Nick opened up a lot. It starting to be easy for him to do small gestures like this. I felt still utterly terrified on our cases, but I could handle that feeling while working with him. 

The small path opened up to an even larger space. So large the flashlight beam didn’t even reach the other side of the wall. My heart pounded from the fear of what lurked in the darkness. As I calmed my breathing, I could hear a noise. Something coming from that dark. A noise I’ve never heard before causing my fear levels to spike right back up. 

Nick carefully stepped forwards, finding a ledge. I followed him as we both looked down into the pitch black, the weak flashlight beam reflecting off of something moving below. As my eyes adjusted, I clued into what that sound was. It turned out to be countless legs moving. My stomach flipped as I watched so many long insect bodies squirming over each other. In that deep pit was an uncountable number of centipedes the size of house cats. All biting and trying to eat one another. I grabbed Nick’s arm not knowing what we should do next. Just as we took a step back ready to call for someone else to deal with this, a massive shape came tearing through the smaller insects. It also a centipede so large it could reach us if it stood up.  

Nick didn’t say anything. He didn’t need to. We both turned heel to leave the way we came. In one swift movement, he took my pack so I could fit inside the path quicker. Those insects must have heard us. All of those legs were moving closer and closer to us. As I moved, the rocks scraped against my back and chest. I heard them following us. That awful noise echoing through the darkness. My breathe caught and I nearly stopped in fear. My partner placed a hand on my shoulder to keep us going. I in front, him behind in case some of those insects caught up. My vision blurred as I forced my body forwards. We weren’t moving fast enough. Every second more and more of those things caught up. We were going to be eaten and it all my fault for being too slow. My brain swamped with fear, Nick needed to keep pushing on my shoulder to get us through the last stretch of the path. I stumbled forwards, scratching my exposed elbows and knees pretty badly. Nick slipped out behind still on his feet. He kicked at the few centipedes that caught up while grabbing my arm to lift me back up. 

We couldn’t risk using his sword in the cave. It would bring the entire place down on our heads. A rumbling came and from the sounds of things, the bigger creature was going to start trying to force itself through. A large centipede leapt up, digging its punchers into Nick’s arm. I raised my gun and shot it off him without a second thought. He looked shocked for a second that I could to get such a shot off in the dark. I wasn’t practicing for nothing.  

There far too many of them to take out. I ran with Nick at my heels. He would ensure none of the bugs caught up to his weaker scared to death partner. Instead of using his sword, he used the scabbard as a baseball bat, knocking any centipede that got close aside. The Orchestra going to be very upset that its beautiful scabbard being used so roughly. By some miracle we got out of the cave. Nick slowed down a little from tearing bugs off his suit. He let me keep running, giving us some distance before he drew his sword finally ready to take out the threat.  

With a few swings, he sent out shock waves slicing the bugs in half. It clearly a losing battle. More and more of them appeared swarming out of the cave entrance causing us to fall back to town. It was good we put distance between us and the cave. The ground shook, and an explosion came from near the cave’s entrance. Rocks flew, nearly landing on us and the bigger ones killing some centipedes that didn’t get out of the way.  

The larger insect we saw burst through into the sunlight. It started on the smaller ones, eating everyone in sight. That gave Nick enough time to call for back up. To our dismay, some could only come in about an hour. It was up to us to hold back this creature for so long. I almost thought we could do it. That hope was crushed when a second centipede the size of a building came crashing through the stone cave.  

I cursed and we made a run for it. We might be able to hide inside one of the buildings for a few minutes. The large centipedes focused on eating the smaller ones for now. We reached the saloon first. From the back windows we could keep an eye out into the desert looking for when those massive trouble makers would be coming our way. 

“I’ve forgotten the creature’s names, but I’ve read about them in my father’s journals. They come from a different world made of nothing. The pair are universe devourers. They produce off spring onto to eat them for strength. If they are not killed, they’ll continue eating everything until nothing is left.” Nick explained as we could hear the creatures rip across the sand looking for more food. 

Well, that was just great. We were up against something that ate an entire world armed with a gun and a grumpy sword. The black shapes twisting in the sunlight. I squinted to see what the pair was doing. As far as I could tell, they were digging their faces into the dirt. Were they eating it? How long would they eat sand before they got tired and went after a more tasty target?

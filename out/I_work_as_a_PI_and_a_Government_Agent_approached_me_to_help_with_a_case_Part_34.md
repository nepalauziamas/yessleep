After the encounter with the ghost it was a bit difficult to get back on my feet again. I could tell Nick was worried about the aftermath of such a case. He was dropping by my apartment more often with small gifts or food. No matter how much I assured him I was fine, he would be at my door the next day with something in hand. What got me back into the office was when he dropped off an entire bag of oranges. There was no way I could eat these many so I brought them in for Jimmy and Tippie. They’ve done just fine without their boss for a few days. Aside from a pile of paperwork that still needed to be filed, the office was in running order.  

I met Jimmy outside the office just as she was arriving. Someone was with her and she appeared a little flustered that I had caught them together. He was a very tall and thin man, a bit on the attractive side. His teeth were a bit too sharp and his handshake was strong when Jimmy introduced me as her boss. I guessed he was a half-breed like her. With a small hint of red on her face, she told me he was her new boyfriend. They would drive into the office together and he would walk to the bus stop to get to work after. I noticed right away she was avoiding saying his name. I offered a few oranges to the pair which they accepted. 

“If he has a weird name, I won’t laugh.” I promised. 

They both looked at each other, nervous I may break my word. 

“My mother named me Tupperware. I suppose that’s not the worst name in the world, it’s the last name that gets everyone...” He started. When I didn’t react to his first name, he felt comfortable enough sharing his full name. “It’s Johnson.” 

My face twitched and it took everything in me not to laugh. My shoulders shook and hands trembled. I was given permission to let it out if I wanted, but I shook my head and leaned over determined not to laugh in their faces. It was a good idea to get out of my apartment that day. Who would have known that the trick to getting over a mental scar was just hearing a bad name? My muffled giggling fit was forgiven. He preferred to use his last name, so Johnson waved goodbye as he started heading to work. From the sounds of it he wasn’t very happy with his part-time job. I told Jimmy I would pay him if he could help with the filing as another part time gig. She was pretty grateful for the offer. It would help him out a lot and they could see each other more often. 

I started doing regular jobs once more. Some creatures came into the office looking for some help, but most requests could be dealt with a trip to the corner store or by digging around the box of treats I wisely stored beside the desk. 

It was the type of day that really helped me to get back into a normal frame of mind. After seeing how much I had improved, Nick was finally comfortable enough to bring me along for a case. A file had just come through and he picked it up for us.  

“There has been an ongoing issue with supernatural creatures creating cults, or using humans to summon them to different worlds. The Corporation has been able to investigate and cover up most of these events.” 

He was standing by my door, explaining what we would be dealing with as I got ready. Our job was to go to a ghosttown in the middle of a desert. I needed to double-check that I had packed enough water, and realized I nearly forgot sunscreen. While he spoke, I was looking through my small closet trying to find a hat for the trip.  

“I don’t mean to derail you, but what’s with the shoes?” I asked, when I noticed Nick was a bit taller than he should be. 

He looked down at his shoes. The heels were higher than normal. It was still a professional pair that went well with his suit, but a bit more feminine than usual.   

“My previous pair was damaged yesterday. These were the only ones on hand. They are what I did not wear on the Twin Lizard case.” 

He did buy a few outfits for that case. I never thought about what he did with the clothing that didn’t get ruined. And where the makeup ended up. I always assumed Nick gave it away. I’d hoped we never needed to dress him up for bait again. I guessed he must have kept it all, just in case.  

“That makes sense. What about this cult stuff?” I got us back on topic. 

I found a few old dusty hats to pick from. Nick humored me as I put one on him as he spoke, not really reacting to how I was pulling his ponytail through the back to see how he looked in a baseball cap. 

“The town is empty. There have been signs of summoning, but there are no creatures or humans there. Our task is simply to take photos and clear the area. If we come across a creature, we are to call for backup due to this being a case with an unknown culprit behind the summoning.” 

Nick made no move to remove the hat. He would have kept it on for the entire case if I hadn’t decided a baseball cap didn’t suit him. When I finally picked one out and was packed, we were ready to go. I wasn’t looking forward to being in a very hot desert looking for any traces a cult might have left behind. There wasn't even any guarantee that whatever was summoned left the area. At least this time we would have some backup if needed.  

A quick charm later and we stepped into an overly hot and abandoned town that looked like it belonged in a western. The main road led to a handful of buildings that looked ready to fall apart and were bleached from the sun. At the end of the road stood a handful of modern buildings. A gift shop and a small hotel for tourists. No one was around due to the entire place being closed off after the summoning was discovered. Nick started down the dusty road and I was having trouble keeping up with his long strides. He slowed down when he noticed his partner was lagging behind.  

The summoning circle was found inside the jailhouse. There were cells above and below ground. Thankfully, what we were looking for was in the below-ground cell. It was much cooler there. The walk was short but I was already drenched in sweat by the time we arrived to the basement. The walls were made of loose bricks and the floor was simply packed dirt. Nick needed to light a lantern for us to see in the dim room. In the middle of the floor was a circle with spellwork drawn around it. A few other items  were left behind. Some clothes, some candles, and some metal statues that I didn’t know what they were supposed to represent. The place smelled of mold and dried blood. I guessed the circle and spellwork were drawn in what I could only hope was animal blood. 

In the middle of the circle we found something else. Two large and cracked open eggshells the size of ostrich eggs were left in place. Nick leaned over to pick one up. Going over it in his hands, he was trying to figure out what it belonged to. Whatever had hatched was long gone now. 

I took over taking photos of everything I could, trying my best to get all the needed details. While I took the photos, I noticed some tracks in the dusty floor. Pointing them out to Nick, he got down low to look them over. A set of bootprints ran alongside the strange dotted prints. As if whatever hatched from the eggs was following behind a person.  

“Any ideas on what this might be?” I asked after a long pause.  

“I am not certain. I would like to investigate a mine nearby to confirm my suspicions.” 

I did not like the sounds of being in an old abandoned mine. Caves freaked me out. Too many bad horror movies when I was younger tainted my concept of them. Nick straightened up and handed over my gun and holster he’d been holding onto until that point. If we saw something inside the cave, we were to leave and call for help. I still needed a weapon in case that wasn’t possible. The moment we reached the top of the stairs, my cell phone started to go off. Nick let me answer it. 

My sister was calling. She had tried to get a hold of me the entire time I was down in the jailhouse basement. It was unprofessional taking a personal call while on a case, but Nick was fine with it. He said he would meet me by the gift shop to give us some privacy. My sister was frantic. Her car broke down and she needed to get into work in two days. Without any money to get the car fixed, she feared she would end up spending too much on cab fares to get to work, leaving them without grocery money for a week.  

I’ve been sending her money since I moved out. After accepting cases with Nick, I’d been sending her more. Most of what I earned went into a savings account to buy her a house when I got enough. She was raising two kids and I didn’t think a boyfriend was in the picture. I promised her I would send her some extra money when I was done with work. I quickly went through my savings in my head, and I decided that I could afford to just buy her a new car. It was better than her trying to repair an old junk heap over and over again. With that sorted, I hung up and left to find Nick.  

He was inside the empty gift shop looking at some lizard art for sale. If we had time after the case, we should really come back to buy him something. There was also a wide variety of cowboy hats. We could not move on with the job unless I took a few photos of Nickie wearing different colored ones.  

“Was your phone call important?” He asked from under the brim of a glittery pink cowboy hat I’d placed on his head. 

“Sort of. My sister was having money issues so I told her I would send some over when I could.” I told him, a little surprised at how well he could pull off wearing anything in pink. 

I’ve never really spoken to him about my sister, or gone into details about why my family kicked me out. It all was in the past and something I never thought was important enough to sit down and explain. He never asked, just like I never asked about his previous partner. If it wasn’t for my sister, I would have been on the street. I lived with her for three years and finished school. Then we had gotten into a huge fight and I moved out. I still loved her, and we spoke pretty often. She didn’t know about Nick though. He would be impossible to explain without going into what kind of work I was doing now. 

“You are a very responsible brother.” 

Nick’s answer made me a bit embarrassed. I didn’t feel as if I was going out of my way for her. I was just doing what I could and it felt natural. Hell, at this point if Nick was having money problems, I would do the same for him. Being a brother really did influence how I acted around a lot of people. Most girls I’ve met now were like my sisters, and I cared about them very dearly and would do anything for them if they asked.  

“It’s not really a hard thing to do.” I shrugged off his compliment.  

As I started towards the door, I noticed Nick wasn’t following. 

“Are we buying this?” He said pointing towards the hat. 

I let out a laugh. He was far too easygoing for his own good. He didn’t want the hat, but would wear it if I thought it looked good on him. I put it back and told him I would consider it after our job was done. I really needed to start planning what kind of costume I was going to force him to wear on Halloween now that I knew how easy it was to dress up my partner.  

The hike to the mine was brutal. The fun conversation at the gift shop was quickly forgotten as I was miserable in the heat. We needed to stop ever few feet so I could take sips of water. How anyone lived in a place like this was beyond me. Even while wearing a t-shirt and shorts, I was overheated by the time we reached the opening of the cave. At least the further we went into the darkness, the cooler it became. I even forgot about how creepy caves were. Nick led the way with a flashlight. Our footsteps echoing off the glittering walls. When I cooled down, I focused on how the stone appeared to sparkle faintly when the flashlight beam went over it. My knowledge about rocks was pretty scarce. I thought any that sparkled were worth something. That must not be the case if this mine was abandoned. 

I was unaware of what we may be looking for. Along the cave were ropes set up to guide people through. They led into a main cavern. It opened up into a room with unlit lamps. Tours went through this place on occasion. Nick carried on, going to the end of the room and to an opening that was roped off. It was covered with signs that said going beyond that point was off limits. If someone disobeyed the signs, the tour company wasn’t liable for any injuries. A sense of stress started to sink into my gut as I followed behind him deeper into the cave. 

I no longer had any idea of what we might come across. The small flashlight wasn’t enough to show the way through. My pack was feeling heavier with each step. The pathway was becoming tighter. After a while we needed to walk sideways to fit through and I needed to carry my pack in one hand. A sense of claustrophobia nearly overtook my brain as the rocks dug into my back. I didn’t even think I was scared of tight spaces until that point. Nick must have noticed how stressed I was getting. In the dark, he reached out to take a hold of the hem of my shirt. His face was facing forward and was as emotionless as ever. In the short few months we’ve been working together, Nick had opened up a lot. It was starting to be easy for him to do small gestures like this. I was still utterly terrified on our cases, but I could handle that feeling if I was working with him. 

The small path opened up to an even larger space. So large that the flashlight beam didn’t even reach the other side of the wall. My heart pounded from the fear of what might be waiting for us in the darkness, along with how tight the passageway was to get there. As I calmed my breathing, I could hear a noise. Something was coming from that darkness. A noise I’ve never heard before was causing my fear levels to spike right back up. 

Nick carefully stepped forward, finding a ledge. I followed him as we both looked down into the pitch black, the weak flashlight beam reflecting off of something moving below. As my eyes adjusted, I clued into what that sound was. It was countless legs moving. My stomach flipped as I watched countless long insect bodies squirming over each other. In that deep pit were a huge number of centipedes the size of house cats. All biting and trying to eat one another. I grabbed Nick’s arm not knowing what we should do next. Just as we took a step back ready to call for someone else to deal with this, a massive shape came tearing through the smaller insects. It was also a centipede, but it was so large it could reach us if it stood up.  

Nick didn’t say anything. He didn’t need to. We both turned heel to leave the way we came. In one swift movement, he took my pack so I could fit inside the path quicker. Those insects must have heard us. All of those legs were moving closer and closer to us. As I moved, the rocks scraped against my back and chest. I heard them following us, with that awful noise echoing through the darkness. My breath caught and I nearly stopped in fear. My partner placed a hand on my shoulder to keep us going. I was in front, him behind me in case some of those insects caught up. My vision blurred as I forced my body forwards. We weren’t moving fast enough. Every second more and more of those things caught up. We were going to be eaten and it was all my fault for being too slow. My brain swamped with fear, Nick needed to keep pushing on my shoulder to get us through the last stretch of the path. I stumbled forwards, scratching my exposed elbows and knees pretty badly. Nick slipped out behind me, still on his feet. He was kicking at the few centipedes that caught up while grabbing my arm to lift me back up at the same time. 

We couldn’t risk using his sword in the cave. It would bring the entire place down on our heads. A rumbling came and from the sounds of things, the bigger creature was going to start trying to force itself through. A large centipede leapt up, digging its pincers into Nick’s arm. I raised my gun and shot it off him without a second thought. He looked shocked for a second that I was able to get such a shot off in the dark. I wasn’t practicing for nothing.  

There were far too many of them to take out. I ran, with Nick at my heels. He would ensure none of the bugs caught up to his weaker and scared-to-death partner. Instead of using his sword, he used the scabbard as a baseball bat, knocking any centipede that got too close aside. The Orchestra was going to be very upset that its beautiful scabbard was being used so roughly. By some miracle, we managed to get out of the cave. Nick was slowed down a little from having to tear bugs off his suit. He let me keep running, giving us some distance before he drew his sword, finally ready to take out the threat.  

With a few swings, he sent out shock waves slicing the bugs in half. It was a losing battle. More and more of them appeared, swarming out of the cave entrance causing us to fall back into town. It was good we had put a bit of distance between us and the cave. The ground shook, and there was an explosion from near the cave’s entrance. Rocks flew up, nearly landing on us while some of the bigger ones killed some centipedes that didn’t get out of the way.  

The larger insect we saw in the pit burst through into the sunlight. It started on the smaller ones, eating every one in sight. That gave Nick enough time to call for back up. To our dismay, some could only come in about an hour. It was up to us to hold back this creature for that long. I almost thought we could do it. That hope was crushed when a second centipede the size of a building came crashing through the stone cave.  

I cursed and we made a run for it. We might be able to hide inside one of the buildings for a few minutes. The large centipedes were focused on eating the smaller ones for now. We reached the saloon first. From the back windows we could keep an eye out into the desert keeping a lookout for when those massive troublemakers would be coming our way. 

“I’ve forgotten the creature’s names, but I’ve read about them in my father’s journals. They come from a different world made of nothing. The pair are universe devourers. They produce offspring just to eat them for strength. If they are not killed, they’ll continue eating everything until nothing is left.” Nick explained as we could hear the creatures rip across the sand looking for more food. 

Well, that was just great. We were up against something that could eat an entire world, armed with just a gun and a grumpy sword. The black shapes twisting in the sunlight. I squinted to see what the pair was doing. As far as I could tell, they were digging their faces into the dirt. Were they eating it? How long would they eat sand before they got tired and went after a more tasty target?

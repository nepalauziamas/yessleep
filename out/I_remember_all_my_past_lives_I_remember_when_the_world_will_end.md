It's been a while since I've tried to tell my story, so far nobody believed me but I feel like I'll have a chance now. The thing is, I was born with all my past memories, all my past lives. I remember them vividly like it was yesterday.

Some are short, only a few years before I died, some I lived for close to a century. The thing is, they're not all lives in the past. I have memories from having lived in the future, these are the memories that keep me up at night.

I've tried to give people warnings, to try and prevent what I saw. But so far nobody was willing to listen, and I'm starting to run out of time.

It's not the cliche you expect, no evil AI that takes over the world, not the world being destroyed through global warming, we didn't have enough time to do that in the end.

I remember it like it was yesterday, how could I forget? It all seemed like a normal day, a beautiful day. But it soon changed for the worst, in mere moments, the once blue sky turned black and faint stars filled the sky as the earth's atmosphere washed away. Just like that, all gas surrounding the earth was gone and we were exposed to the vacuum of space. I don't remember much after that, I was trying to gasp for air, to fill my empty lungs, but there was nothing left to breathe in. As everyone around started to collapse, I too fainted, suffocating in the depth of space.

My life flashed before my eyes, my childhood, my college years. I remembered watching an interview with a NASA scientist a few days ago on TV, where the scientist seemed to panic and frantically try to explain that the end of the world was coming. Seems like they were right in the end. I saw a tunnel of light, at the other end, a doctor's room, the sound of a baby crying. It was my crying.

I've spent this lifetime trying to research what will happen, and my best theory so far is a gamma-ray burst. Already on its way to hit earth as I type this, burning away the atmosphere in only a mere moment. My research so-far has landed me a job at NASA, allowing me to come up with an idea to try and prevent this. If we alter the earth's orbit, we can make the burst narrowly miss us.

I'm not sure how yet, and to be honest I don't know how long I have to figure it out. I wasn't that punctual in my last life, so I don't remember the date or even the exact year it was in. I'm only afraid it will happen in my lifetime.

I prepared a bunker just in case, an airtight chamber I can at least survive in. Although I'm honestly not sure if I want to delay the inevitable.

Anyways. I'm having an interview tomorrow, hopefully, I can warn everyone in time. And hopefully I won't need my bunker in the first place.

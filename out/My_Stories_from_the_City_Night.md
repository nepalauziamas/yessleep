After I left my office I would usually stay more time just to allow people that will go on my same route to the subway to get there so I could walk by myself. I didn't dislike them, it was just that I enjoy the quietness more and not having to come up with topics of conversation. After some time I started developing a small interest in following strangers, it was interesting to me to think about how many people we see on this streets and how all of them had their own full life, I enjoyed selecting someone at the entrance of the subway station and just follow them from a distance just to see in which station they would get out. Later I started to follow them all the way to the street they entered a building or a house.

I always had the idea that during the nighttime the strangest things could happen in your same street or even with your neighbors in the same building, kidnappings that no one reported, cult gatherings or just strange rituals, and even though I had always had the intention on maybe be more focused on things happening around me I never did much for this, until I read that news on the paper of how someone came out of the subway station out to a park and he decided to sit down in one of the benches, while he was there for no reason another person came to him with a steel bat and just hit him in the head until killing him, there was no relation and the aggressor was just labeled as a “crazy homeless person”, but I knew there was probably more to that, I kept thinking of maybe some sort of temporal possession could have happened, maybe that was happening all around us all the time.

I followed multiple people at night but never saw that much of anything. I enjoyed seeing them on the subway, peoples faces, you had the happy ones that were accompanied by someone else but you could also see the lonelier tired ones staring at nothing just wanting to get home and just starting a many hours journey. It was one of this I found interested to follow next, seemed like a 50 year old balding man, short with old clothes that was just sitting there in front of me, you could see his eyes looking at the floor, he did not acknowledge his surroundings much and just went on the journey, his mouth half open most of the time and had a sad look in his eyes, like if he was beaten by life, he got off on one of the stations I would normally not follow anyone because I thought it was a dangerous area but after a short moment of hesitation I decided to continue.The Sad man walked through 8 blocks until he approach his home, stopped to take his keys out and entered, I continue walking and saw his house, a very simple small house fabricated probably with cheap materials, just by looking it on the outside I could feel the inside , old and humid. I went back home.

&#x200B;

I didn't saw him again for the next days, I tried to be there at different times and switched between trains often but nothing, until finally I saw his same sad expression looking to the floor when, there was no reason anymore to look around to choose someone to follow, I had my target already, the subway was unusually empty for this hour, he was sitting and had a big carton box next to him. He stood up and required his both hands to carry the box, he got out in a different station that the other time, he was walking slowly because of the box so I had to keep my distance, he walked out of the station and there was already some old person in a black coat waiting for him, he delivered the box to him and the old man walked and put it in the back of a big SUV parked on the street, the sad man would just stay there like waiting to see if there was anything else needed from him and  as soon as the SUV drove away he returned to the station,

&#x200B;

What business did the Sad man have with these wealthy people?

&#x200B;

I kept following from a distance, he was now walking fast and he seemed to be in a hurry.

&#x200B;

As expected he got off in the same station as the first time and started walking through the lighted but still dangerous streets, he entered his home and as soon as he opened the door I ran to get to the door as fast as I could, I wanted to hear from outside the door anything that happened when he entered.I looked through his window, it looked mostly empty, no furniture, nothing in the walls, I could see an open door on the end of the empty room and some red light coming from there, At that moment I heard a violent sound that was the door opening in one movement and the Sad man coming out with a gun. I was on the floor and just saw this person there smiling with a gun pointed at me.

&#x200B;

He told me to go inside, he had this small smile in his face like when you finally kill that fly that was bothering you, I tried to explain to him that I was just following him out of curiosity and that I was nothing he had to worried about but he didn't pay any attention to me, he directed me all the way to the empty room with the red lighting, after entering the room I could see there where some stairs to some kind of basement, until now it had looked like a normal house but now it was like if the rest of the house was built with any kind of leftover material, I walked the flimsy wooden stairs, on the walls there was no construction so as soon as you went down you could see and smell the humid dirt that was surrounding you.

Here is where I do my work, he said and turn on the light in the basement.

&#x200B;

There was a big desk, all the floor was dirt and you could see big metal residues all over, he had some tools for cutting and bending steel and all around I could see this type of metal designs, sometimes you could distinguish animals, horns, wings, mouths and fangs just coming out from steel plaques, he tied my hands together and then to a chair and he sat in front of me behind his desk, the usual sad face was gone and you could see that he was afraid and ready to commit violence for self preservation, He believe that I was sent here to spy on him.

&#x200B;

Who sent you?, he asked in a low key voice, almost delicate, I tried to explain that I was just following him for fun, that I didn't know what was happening in here, he didn't believe anything I said so he kept asking me, at some point I realized he had believe me now, he believe I was there just by chance but that didn't meant He was going to let me go.

&#x200B;

A couple of hours later he returned and started taking pictures of me and left.

&#x200B;

There in the darkness I could hear not far away from me something moving, there was no noise coming from that area before, I couldn't see anything but because of the noise he made I could feel that it was something big, maybe a big dog or something even bigger, I would just hear chains move from one side of the room to another, I could hear steps but I was not sure, I tried not to make any noise, I was afraid that thing could eat me if it release itself.

&#x200B;

I could see the room upstairs if I turned my head up through the separations that where there between the wood floor, I saw someone came in, I could only see his shoes.The Sad man was very happy explaining how I just arrive out of nowhere and I heard him saying

&#x200B;

Like a christams gift

I was the gift, I could hear clearly the conversation and now I knew why he had taken pictures of me, he was selling me in some groups, probably for organ transplants, he mentioned that “The Doctor” was going to be here in the morning, I couldn't take the fear, I wanted to scream but I knew it was pointless, I was not going to leave that place.

&#x200B;

I fell asleep for some hours and wake up when the light of the sun came through the window and after that through the spaces between the wooden floors, the light came directly into my close eyes, I open them and realized that the room had a lot of light coming in and there just on the other side of the room standing as tall as the room , this big person just standing there with his hands and feet tied together with a chain that was attached to the wall, he had old clothes like he had been here for a lot of time,I could see his eyes, all black with no expression in his face.

&#x200B;

I heard the noise of the door opening and saw the Sad man coming in with a big smile on his face.

Dont worry, they will come soon for you.

He had a bucket with some disgusting food that he threw to the big man on the other side of the room. He started moving around trying to free himself but the Sad man would only smile knowing he was staying there.

&#x200B;

\- Don't make much noise, and don't scare my guests like you usually do.He said

&#x200B;

The big man took the bucket and just started to eat whatever was in there. I don't know how  he could do it, the stench of rotten food was unbearable in the basement. I tried talking with him, asking for help but he would stay still without making any movement most of the time.

The sad man came some hours later to pick the bucket, as soon as he got close enough the big man started to yell and move violently trying to free himself until the supporting wall came down, he still had his arms and feet tied in but he was big enough to just throw himself onto the sad man and kept trying breaking out, I could see how he put some much force into freeing his hands that he end up fracturing both hand, but this didn't seem to bother him, you could see the bones coming out of the open skin, he started beating the Sad man who was completely defenseless against such force, he shouted some weird phrases in a strange language expecting some behavior but it didint help at all, at some point he threw the Sad man across the room and landed over me, this broke my chair and I was able to get up and  run, the big man didint seem interested in me so I was able to run out of the basement, and then just when I was about to leave I saw it, the Sad man kept yelling this weird phrases and I saw how the big man just stopped, his body just felt to the floor and you could see the real body now, dead and useless.

The Sad man looked at me and I just started running out of the house, I could hear the steps up the basement, I kept running on the street, I could see people on the windows, they would usually close the curtains when I looked at them or got quickly into their homes when I passed them by, I finally got to the subway where I felt safe, there was a lot of people, I pushed myself into the train and kept looking around, I couldn't see the Sad man around so I thought that I was safe.

Now I keep looking around everyday when I go to the subway after work, I know I can just find him any day and don't know what would happen. I keep thinking about that day and all that happened, sometimes it feels like it was just a nightmare,He looked like any other person you could find in the subway, but something I can't stop thinking about was about what he delivered, what was the link between the Sad man and the person that received the box, by the clothes he was wearing and the car he got up to he seemed like a wealthy person, I always assumed things like this happens all around Us all the time, and I wanted to share my story because I have decided to look for the Wealthy man.

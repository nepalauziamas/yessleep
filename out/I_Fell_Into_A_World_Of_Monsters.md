 

When   I was about 16 years old, I used to walk around the streets of my  hometown late at night. It was an underprivileged town, located within a   mountain range that is covered with trees. Around this time, rumors  began floating around my town about creature sightings, but I never  believed them.

I imagined that   they were nothing more than fictitious stories, no different than the   BoogeyMan or BigFoot. That all changed one night in December. A blizzard  was howling and a thick fog hung in the air. To this day, I still don't   know why I thought it would be a good idea to travel into the woods,   alone

In the middle of the night. I   soon found myself lost, unable to find my way back. As I stumbled   about, I began to hear the faint sound of screeching. I thought I was   going crazy, but every step I took seemed to amplify the sounds,   regardless of what direction I wandered. Luckily, I happened upon an old   hunter's post that was built in a tree.

The   ladder seemed stable, so I climbed up into it. Sprawled out on the   floor was a map. Off in the corner was a box that seemed to only contain   junk. I looked around at the four walls and decided to stay here. This   humble abode would likely keep me from freezing to death, and it also   offered me momentary relief from the persisting sounds. I tried to   sleep, but it was impossible. The sounds haunted me until a new one was   added.

I began to hear scratching   near the ladder below. I looked through a crack in the floorboards and   witnessed the worst thing that I have ever seen. There was a  nightmarish  creature below. It was mostly white, with black splotches  scattered on  its skin. It was scratching at the ladder. The creature  was immediately aware of my presence. We locked eyes momentarily before  my legs became  paralyzed by the cold and fear. I tumbled to the floor.  My head almost  hit the box of junk in the corner. Using what strength I  had left, I  frantically began searching the box.

At   the bottom, I found a flare. I lit it with a lighter from my pocket  and  swung it downward at the creature through the opening. The creature  was  not fazed. It was only then, in the firelight, that I realized the   creature was not alone. Two more stood beside it. My fingers slowly   unwrapped from the flare and it fell below. I then heard blood-curdling   screams as the flare landed on one of them. That is the last thing that  I  remember before going unconscious. When I awoke, the creatures were   gone and the blizzard had cleared.

I   managed to find my way back home. When I had regained my strength, I   asked two of the hunters I knew if they had ever seen such a creature.   They both told me of similar stories ending the exact same way; a slow   loss of consciousness that made them believe it was just a nightmare.   Two years have passed since then and we plan to figure out what those   creatures were.

Part 2

I   want to thank you all for reading my last post. I'm currently planning   to go back into the woods with a couple of my friends that claim that   they experienced similar, strange occurrences. To update everyone on my   life, I am now 18 years old. I recently got my driver's license and I   have been making trips out to those woods. To say the least, these  trips  have been dangerous. There have been a number of recent missing  person  reports connected to those woods. There seems to be no pattern  regarding  who goes missing, as their ages, genders, and nationalities  always tend  to vary. Some of the individuals who go missing are  eventually found,  but they are never found alive. When their bodies  show up, they are  always stripped of their flesh and teeth. This makes  it hard to figure  out who they are.

I  guess that  they are usually identified by the size of their body, or  using DNA of  some sort. To be honest, my knowledge of forensics only  comes from shows  like CSI and Bones, so I don't really understand how  they do it.  Anyway, some of my experiences in the woods have been  gut-wrenching. I  was one of the first people to find a body out there.  It was a child of  maybe 5 or 6 years old. I haven't really been the  same since that day. I  have noticed that I am numb more often than not,  despite the fact that  this happened about a year ago. I still see that  small, broken body  every time I close my eyes... Maybe that's why I'm a  bit obsessed with  those woods. I plan on going back there to stop  whatever is hurting  these people. I'm not going alone this time. With  my mental state the  way it is, I doubt I would survive out there by  myself. Well, I'll keep  everyone posted on my journey. If I'm lucky, I  will still have service  out in the woods. Until next time, thanks for  reading.

Part 3

A   lot of crazy shit has happened since my last update. What I have seen   is enough to fuel my nightmares for the rest of my life. I think I am  in  over my head. This situation with the woods is bigger than I could  have  ever imagined. In my last post, I explained how I was going to go  back  into the woods with my friends to figure out what was going on.  That is  exactly what we did. I went with my friends, Mark and Leon.  Mark is 6'1.  He is a big, athletic guy that shares my passion for  hunting. He may be  the strongest man that I have ever met. Leon is far  more "laid back".  He's a hunter as well and has a knack for tracking.  More importantly,  he's a gun enthusiast. I thought it would be great  for him to come with  us since he is bound to be carrying some serious  firepower. I realize  now that we are three posts in and I have not  introduced myself yet. My  name is Hutch. I'm 5'10. I may not be as  strong as Mark, but I do have a  bit of muscle. I can handle myself in  most situations. Anyway, we spent  a while preparing ourselves before  going out into those woods. We  packed the basics: food, water, an extra  set of clothes, first aid, and  of course, weapons. Leon helped us with  the last one. He equipped us  each with an AR and three full magazines.  With the supplies we brought,  we had enough to survive a week or so  without returning. We made it to  the woods around noon and noticed that  there was a thick fog tangled  between the trees.

One  by one, we  went to each of the locations where we experienced strange  events in the  past. To our surprise, there was nothing out of the  ordinary to be  found. We began to get a bit discouraged until Mark  perked up and said,  "Maybe the things we're looking for are sleeping.  Didn't all of our  stories happen at night?" After a brief discussion,  Leon and I agreed.  Mark began to speak again, "They're probably  nocturnal." He then turned  to me. "Didn't you say the creatures you saw  ran away from the flare you  lit? Maybe they're afraid of the light."  Hearing him say this made me  realize how much of an idiot I am for not  realizing this already. I  nodded in agreement once more. We began  discussing locations where these  creatures could be hiding during the  day. I remembered overhearing a  few locals talking about this  tremendous cave that they stumbled upon  deep in the woods. Apparently,  they heard screams coming from inside of  it. They also mentioned  hearing the sound of a crying infant.

I   didn't pay much attention to the story when I first heard them talking   about it because there were a ton of rumors floating around after  these  strange occurrences began. Plenty of people were making up  stories, so  it was hard to determine which ones were real and which  ones weren't.  Regardless, I told Mark and Leon about the cave and they  agreed to check  it out. We had already been in the woods for about 7  hours and I could  hardly hide my annoyance with the situation. It took a  couple more  hours, but luckily we found the cave before it got too  dark. As we  walked to the entrance of the cave, we noticed the fog  became denser. It  seemed as though it was pouring from the mouth of the  cave. That's when  we heard it. It started out faint at first, but got  louder as we got  closer. We could hear a baby crying. We were all  nervous and hesitated  for a moment before taking another step. After  all, we were there to  keep anyone else from getting hurt. We slowly  peered into the entrance  of the cave. The crying was now painfully  ringing in our ears. Mark  pointed his flashlight into the cave. The  ground was littered with  teeth, many of which seemed human.

Mark   continued pointing his flashlight at different parts of the cave until   we saw something immense skitter by. With a shaking hand, Mark shined   the light toward the direction the creature had moved. To our terror,   his light illuminated a seven-foot-tall spider-like creature. It seemed   to have pieces of human skin stuck to its eight slender legs and body.   Despite this, it wasn't until I saw its face that I experienced true   fear for the first time in my life. It became clear to us that the   crying was not coming from an actual child. Instead, the spider's face   was that of a newborn baby, except for its mouth. The mouth opened   unnaturally wide, revealing row after row of jagged teeth that seemed to   jut out in all directions. The wailing sound never stopped. It simply   became louder as the mouth opened wider. I was mesmerized by the  opening  that seemed to go on forever between those abhorrent teeth. The   creature began to rush toward us. I only snapped out of my trance   because Leon opened fire. With a barrage of precisely aimed bullets, he   managed to shoot one of the creature's legs off before screaming,  "Shoot  its legs before it kills us!" Even injured, the creature was  swift. It  lunged at Mark and jabbed at his shoulder with one of its  many legs.

That  is when I opened  fire on the creature to get its attention. I aimed for  its face, which  seemed to slow it down for a moment before it charged  at me with its  mouth open wide. I lifted my gun to begin firing again.  Before I could,  something flew by my head and into the creature's mouth.  The creature  closed its many teeth around the object as I turned to see  where it  came from. Leon was standing behind me, looking as though he  had just  thrown something. He screamed, "Run!" Mark had already started  doing so  and the three of us went deeper into the cave as the sound of  an  explosion went off behind us. The crying stopped, but we kept running   until we were sure there was nothing behind us. We were all in shock   and collapsed on the floor. None of us said a word for what felt like   hours. Silently, we checked where Mark had been struck to make sure he   was okay. The silence was finally broken when Leon half-heartedly   muttered, "Good thing I packed a grenade." As dangerous as it was for   him to do so, I couldn't help but agree. We set up camp, ate a bit, and   barely spoke at all. I can't help but think that I still hear crawling   noises all around me. I'll update you guys again soon if I am still   alive to do so.

Part 4

I   have no clue where to begin. It seems as if my life is spiraling out  of  control and I am in front row seat to hell. I don't believe I'm even  on  earth anymore.

I ended up   breaking my phone and I'm forced to write In this leathered journal I   bought a year or two ago. I plan on telling about what is happening to   me. If I get hurt or even worst people will know what happened to us.

After   we destroyed that hellish creature we all collapsed from the lack of   strength all the energy from in our bodies left us. We all made sure we   were not all horribly injured Mark is luckily ok. The creature   thankfully didn't hurt him too bad probable some bruising to his   shoulder but besides that, he should be fine. Leon managed to come out   of the fight completely unharmed, lucky bastard.

I   confronted him about having a grenade which he just told me " Wasn't   thinking we were going to need to use it but it's a good thing I brought   it." I silently agreed with him even though I thought it was strange   that he just casually had a grenade but knowing Leon for a while I'm not   surprised.  
We all sat there for a couple of hours contemplating our life choices leading up to now.

The   fog creeping out from the cave didn't help the fear of what could lye   in it We stayed awake but while we were all sitting trying to rest I   heard a weird sound of rocks breaking above us and that wasn't the only   thing i noticed. Loud groaning started to echo around the cave.

"I shined my flashlight upwards"

The   light shined upon large humanoid looking spiders similar to the  massive  one we fought before but smaller. Hundreds of them were  beginning to  surround us. I managed to quickly tell Mark and Leon to  haul ass to try  to make an escape. We tried going towards the entrance  of the cave but  they surrounded it. We were forced back deeper into the  cave and the fog  began to thicken.

I  heard Mark  scream and I was soon to figure out why. We were focusing  on looking  behind us so we didn't see the hole coming up in front of  us. I and Leon  both fell into the hole the fog surrounding us  completely. We fell for  which seemed to be minutes the fear of feeling  like we were all going to  fall to our deaths caused us to all blackout.

I   awoke to find the fog was gone and that the air felt warmer. I looked   towards to were the entrance of the cave would be and I saw a bright   light. I walked towards it and looked out to see a world that doesn't   look like our own. I could hear whales and screams off in the distance.

It   was clear this wasn't the place we entered from. I am still completely   baffled to what the hell is going on. I saw creatures the size of   mountains began to rise out of the greenery in front of me. Their bodies   were shaped as if they were human and they began to just walk.

I   quickly ran back into the cave and I began this is where I am right   now. Writing in this stupid journal clearly lost in someplace that   appears to be some kind of hell.

Mark and Leon are starting to wake up.

I'll update this later -Hutch

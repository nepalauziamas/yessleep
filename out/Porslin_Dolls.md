I grew up on a farm in Gauteng South Africa. Growing up my mother had a big collection of porslin dolls which she inherited from her mother who died in 1999 a few months after i was born. My other grandmother also had a collection of porslin dolls.

My siter and I got 1 porslin doll each for our first birthdays. My siter never liked these dolls and alway ran past my moms dolls and told my mom that they were old, and if she ran past them they could not see her properly when she grew older she gave her doll to me.
I LOVED THEM!
I got a few more dolls for birthdays and christmas's i had atleast 30 by then.

When i was 16 my mother gave me her collection when she was renovating the home and said "they won't like being put away" and that i should have them instead. When i was 19 my other grandmother passed away aswell and left all her dolls to me. 

As my collection grew i placed them on my spare bed, which was in my room.

 My brothers hated being in my room and my youngest brother who is 10 years younger than me told me when he was 7 that he prefferd to watch movies in his room and not in my room, because the dolls were watching him, but said i could join him in his room but i couldnt bring the dolls.

My other brother who is 4 years younger than me said that he knew the dolls watched him, he could feel it. I on the other hand never felt that way, as i washed them weekley and did their laundry once a month. I fixed them up and bought new eyelashes and dresses when they needed it or started looking old.

In 2019 i moved in with my now fiancé, and kept the dolls in the livng room on the sofa. We got 2 dogs since we lived in a dangerous place and i was alone most days. I needed security. My dog slept in their own bed in the kitchen. Just outside my bedroom. 

My dogs never liked the living room so when i heard them in there at night i would get up to check, just to find them asleep not having moved, I know they didn't move because i cover them with a blanket at night and it would be difficult for them to cover them self in such a neat way. These sounds happend often. 

Whenever we made a movie night bed on the living room floor 
My Fiancé said that my dolls were unsetteling and i had to cover them up so the next day i moved them into the clothes cupbord in a diffrent room. The room next to ours.

That same day that i moved them, i fell asleep on the sofa. i heard the living room door open and i slightly opend my eyes to see if my fiancé was home or if my dogs were entering but there was nothing visable but i could feel the air thicken and i could hear my heart race and i couldn't move, instant panic set in. i felt like my chest was being crushed. It took all my strength and jumped free off the sofa to see nothing.i ran through the house confused and found nothing. 

A few weeks later my dogs both went missing while i was doing the shopping.

 my fiancé got me a cat for company amd to prove that i was just tired and stressed over the dogs being missing, and that there was a reasonable explination for the soumds. So being a horror movie fan i named the kittin Annabelle but to the suprise of my fiancé she only slept in bathroom on the washing it got so bad that i had to move all her things into the bathroom including food and water. 

My fiancé started hearing the weird things when i went to visit my mother for a weekend. Most nights after that we could hear the dolls cupbord open and slam shut but never found anything out of place. When ever i was home alone i could see shadows from the corner of my eye. Like people watching me but i could never see it directly and it was only for a breef second before it was gone.

8 months after my dog went missing i had enough and felt like i was going insane.

I told my mother about what happend and she said to leave the dolls outside and never wanted to speak of it again.

When we moved to a new apartment in 2021, i never brought the dolls into my house,  i left them in boxes in the garage and the strange happenings stopped and my cat walks freely everywhere in the apartment.

I could never get rid of them though. Sentimental value

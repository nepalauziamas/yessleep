I’m a grown man whose afraid of the dark. I know it sounds ridiculous but before you judge me let me tell you what happened. 

&#x200B;

I was seven and my household was fairly normal. Loving mother, stoic father. Looking back I was better off than most people then. But now, rife with tracks marks from the needles with bottles in my room you’d never have believed it. I just needed to be happy. Anything to let me fall asleep with some warmth in my chest. To go in the darkness without that thing to get me. 

&#x200B;

It was getting dark when I was young and my parents sent me off to bed. The two were still very much in love when I was younger. My father, back from his job with the Teamsters, was eager to get some alone time with his wife. I miss those days when they smiled. I haven’t seen them do so in a while. 

&#x200B;

So off I went, climbing up the stairs to my room. I threw on my pajamas and turned to hit the lights. On grabbing that nib of plastic a sense of dread came over me. I hated the dark then yet even so it felt like more than a child’s fear. Something seemed to watch me in the shadows when I slept. From The closet, under the bed, now it was the window of the second floor. In it there was nothing but that oaken branch cutting across the moon in the night sky. It swayed with a weight unnatural for its size, yet then again it was over a decade ago, should be a fainter memory. Even so the image of that room remains crystal in my mind. From hardwood floors all the way to the cotton throw blanket covered in moons and stars. 

&#x200B;

I breathed in and threw the switch. Afterwards I dove into my bed beneath the covers. After a moment curled in the safety of my blanket nothing had come for me so I peeked my head above. It was then I noticed I’d accidentally left the window open. I swore to myself, looking to the doorway ensuring I wasn’t heard. After gaining my courage again I crawled out of my bed, heading for the window. 

&#x200B;

A gust of wind came in as I tried to pull it shut, shoving me aside. As  I fell there was a a thump in my closet across the room. Between that and my already bristling nerves I cried out in fear, running for the door.

&#x200B;

Tumbling down the stairs I called out for my parents. The two hopped up from the couch, fixing their shirts with a face like their hands were caught in cookie jars. “What is it boy” My father to his credit wasn’t angry. He simply moved between me and mom as she made herself decent. He even had to stop himself from laughing.

&#x200B;

I was far too young and frightened to notice or care. “There's something in my room!” I pointed up the stairs begging my parents to come and look. 

&#x200B;

“Joseph” My mother opened her arms to which I ran as she embraced me. She stroked my hair as I cried, looking to my dad with eyes full of pity for her boy. “We should let him stay with us, just for tonight.” 

&#x200B;

My father stood there and thought for a moment, then shook his head. “No, he’s a big boy now. There's a time he has to learn. Come with me Joe, were facing this together.” 

&#x200B;

My mother agreed, letting me go with a gentle push to follow. After my father I went up the stairs and back into my room. 

&#x200B;

He turned on the light and sent me in. I looked around nervous as darkness still filled the closet. The light from the ceiling was an old swinging bulb hanging from a line. The house was by no means a hovel but it was definitely a fixer upper. Dad eyed both me and the closet and pointed. “Is that where you think the monster is?”

&#x200B;

I nodded, thinking he would go in and check yet instead he stepped out for a moment, returning with a flashlight. “Go on. I’m right behind you.”

&#x200B;

I took the torch, pointing it in the doorway as I inched closer. I swallowed hard as I stood within that doorway. Swinging the light around for the movement from before. Dad stood behind me looking in. “Looks like your monsters there.” 

&#x200B;

Upon further inspection it looked like he was right. An umbrella and a couple boxes fell from one of the upper shelves, its contents spilling across the floor. My dad squatted down, putting a calloused hand on my little shoulder. “Look son. Most of the things in the world, especially in America that you might run into; Raccoons, Mice, stray cats and dogs. Most of the time they’re the ones who are afraid of us, and rightly so. We’re the things that went bump in the night for them, not the other way around. So when something goes moving in the dark, whose the monster?”

&#x200B;

I hesitantly pointed a finger at myself. “Me?” 

&#x200B;

“That’s right. Now go look in there and give a big roar at whatever was it was. Like this.” To which he made a funny roar at the closet with his arms raised. “See, now you try.”

&#x200B;

I pulled my little arms up with my hands stretched like claws, roaring as best I could. My father laughed and roared again with me . “Good job son. Now who‘s the big bad monster in this room.”

&#x200B;

I giggled as I replied. “I am.”

&#x200B;

“You are. Now give me a hug. Its time for us all to go bed.” So he wrapped his arms around me with a squeeze. He shut the window I had missed, grabbing the light as I crawled back into bed.

&#x200B;

I turned around, curled in my blanket and waved. “Good night dad!” 

&#x200B;

“Good night son.” My father smiled and flipped the switch, off to be with his wife downstairs

&#x200B;

I rolled over to face the window, looking at the night sky. The moon shone its glow around me as I drifted off to sleep. 

&#x200B;

And that was when it happened.

&#x200B;

I awoke to the world around me yet unable to move. My body tingled with a numbness. That tingle was followed by the sense that my being wasn’t so much through my extremities, but seated in my eyes. Those eyes took in the world around me yet never moved, only remaining aware of what was in its view.

&#x200B;

Laying there, willing myself to sit with no avail I noticed it. The movement in the closet had returned. Now there were no boxes, but a stump of a foot entering the light. A squat, fat, and horrible ugly thing entered my room. Its eyes glowed in the moonlight above a snout as short and hideous as the rest of it. Beneath its trunk its yellowed skin and lips smirked like a hunter looking above a trap. Its hands were dancing in the darkness, rotating in the night air, weaving invisible thread around me as I lay there paralyzed.  Strange as it was, I was yet aware that this was no dream. 

&#x200B;

Fear crawled through my heart, watching it weave it’s spell in vulgar hands with ill intentions. My heart raced, screaming in my minds eye to move!

&#x200B;

That thing came ever closer, still twirling its hands and piggish arms about. The pot belly naked and brown like a boar wallowing in mire, moving ever closer. It pulled its hands around a thread invisible, moving its stumpy legs toward me. It was, small, fat, horrible and ugly, and it was coming for its prey. 

&#x200B;

It knew that I could see it. It knew that I knew and Its wicked grin had grew. It mirrored my displeasure with a joy sadistic as it came. The weight of that thing shifted my bed, pulling itself atop the covers. I felt its weight across my chest, standing above me as it glared with beady eyes. There it sat, crossing its stumpy legs above me, relaxed as one preparing  an easy lunch. I failed to scream as it rubbed its‘ hands for dinner.

&#x200B;

It thought that it would eat me. A little boy stolen by an ugly devil, thrown into the night for a stew. It and others dancing around a cauldron in the night. No. What it did was worse.

&#x200B;

Its jaw opened wide, stretching like rubber as its’ eyes glowed looking upwards. Its gaping maw faced me with its purple wriggling tongue as the darkness in its mouth swirled. That hole flickered with a light that I found magical, haunting, and a terror to my dreams. 

&#x200B;

It was dreams that I had saw. Hopes and happiness. A portal had swirled inside its mouth. Rolling in blueish hue as the veins of black spun thread inside its waves. Like driftwood in a storm images came and went within the folds. Nightmares from before running from a monster in a cave. The dream I’d one day be a firefighter. Memories of a child’s infancy and more. Other children s lives flickered like Polaroid stills, dissolving in it maw in sick digestion. 

&#x200B;

The portal was getting larger. Or perhaps I was going in. My consciousness felt those ripples growing larger, threatening to pull me in. My life and memories would leave me, abandoning a husk of a child with light no more inside. 

&#x200B;

It was then its’ trap had shut. Sitting there it watched me, eyes glaring as though it had been offended. Its trunk snorted with a ripple of its snout. Standing up it hopped off my bed. A wave of its hand opened my window and it hopped into the night.

&#x200B;

My parents came a moment later. “Everything alright in there. We heard a noise.” The two had found me laying there frozen with a face in terror and eyes weeping yet still unable to move. The first sensation returning I sobbed in clenched jaw, my mother holding me in the dark. 

&#x200B;

The happy boy they knew had died. No longer had I found joy in anything. Since the incident my therapist calls things like night terror and sleep paralysis, my mind seemed incapable of squeezing any joy. The pills did little and my parents did more. More fighting, more blaming of each other. My father took more trips at work, avoiding a trouble he didn’t know how to fix. My mother took to drinking, avoiding the boy who never made a smile. Decades passed and I wish I could be happy even now. That I could give them back the spark they had so warm between each other. Yet now that spark was gone , as sure as it died in me.

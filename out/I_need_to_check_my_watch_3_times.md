 I rolled out of my bed; my eyelids feel heavy like they were every morning. I made my way to the bathroom; I rubbed my eyes as I turned on the sink. I washed my face as I looked at myself in the mirror. I took in a deep breath as I started to remind myself, “If it looks out of place, look at your watch 3 times.” I kept reminding myself over and over as I got washed my face. I heard my wife’s voice calling me from our dining room. “Honey! Come on, your breakfast is going to get cold.” I looked back, outside the bathroom as I turned off the sink and walked out. “On my way, don’t wait for me,” I said as I made my way to the dining room, my wife already eating her own breakfast. “Oh, I wasn’t planning to.” She said giggling as I sat down, looking down at my breakfast, the usual eggs, and bacon.

I got up when I finished my breakfast, I went back to the bathroom to brush my teeth and get ready for work, grabbing my watch and looking at it for a couple of seconds before kissing my wife goodbye and leaving. I stood outside my house, filled with disgust as I saw a dead raccoon in our front yard. I gagged a bit seeing the poor animal’s insides out of its body. I took in a deep breath as I looked at my watch. It was 8 am. I looked back at the dead raccoon before looking back at my watch. 7:30 am. I let out a sigh of relief, still a bit disgusted by the view before getting into my car. “Remember. It’s just a hallucination.” I said as I sat in my car, gripping the driving wheel, looking back at the raccoon, and letting out a long sigh before driving off.

I arrived at my work, standing outside my car as I looked at the skyscraper where I worked, I walked in, clocked in, and began working like I was a zombie. Before I knew it, it was lunch break, I got up from my office and made my way to my favorite restaurant, it was in a mostly empty neighborhood, I’m not sure why, maybe the residents are all moving out for all I know, but my favorite restaurant is here, I can’t think of a better doner restaurant than this one. As I made my way, I was looking at some of the empty houses. Empty, Empty, Empty, Empty…? I stood there as I saw what looked like gray smoke inside one of the houses near the doner. I got closer to the house, walking slowly cautious as I was sure now it was gray smoke. I was able to see through the window and saw what looked like a fire inside the house. I panicked as I reached for my phone, about to call 911 as I stood there, doubting whether I should call it or not. Maybe it was a hallucination. I looked at my watch, 12 pm. I looked back at the first before quickly looking back at my watch. 12 pm. I looked away and then back at the watch one last time. 12 pm. I panicked as I realized it was a real fire. I called 911 to report it.

Hours passed, the fire was taken care of, and I didn’t get my lunch. I told my manager what happened, and she was nice enough to let me go home. I went back home, around 5 pm. I opened the door and walked inside. “Honey! You won’t believe what happened.” I said as I waited for a response, but nothing. I walked around as I called out for her, not finding her anywhere. The last place I didn’t look in was the basement. I couldn’t think of a reason for her being there, but it couldn’t hurt to try. I opened the basement door and made my way down the basement as I called for her name, my body freezing as I stood there, and my eyes were met with a horrifying view. It felt like someone stabbed my throat, my guts felt like they were crushed as I couldn’t let out a single view. My wife’s body hanging from a noose. This can’t be happening. I couldn’t think of a reason, I couldn’t think of anything as my wife’s body hanged there. I felt like my entire body was crushed in grief as I dropped to my knees.

I couldn’t think of anything. My brain felt like it shut off. This couldn’t be happening. I remembered something, this could be a hallucination, yea, that’s what it is. I hoped as I slowly lifted my hand, looking at the time. It was 5:10 pm. I looked away before looking back slowly, my heart felt heavy as I saw the time again. 5:10 pm. I felt like I would throw up as I looked away, this time I just couldn’t look back at the watch, my eyes filled with tears as I knew I had to. I slowly looked back at the watch, tears flooding my eyes as I laughed hysterically, I got up and ran out of the basement. It was 5:50 pm. It was tears of joy as I tried calling my wife. She didn’t pick up nor did I hear her phone ringing, but I couldn’t be happier to know something was a hallucination.

I felt exhausted, I just wanted to lay down, I gathered the strength to get up and made my way to our bed. I threw myself on the bed, I couldn’t stop crying. I let my eyes pour until I passed out on the bed. I don’t know how much time passed but when I woke up it was late. I got up from my bed and turned on the lights, realizing my wife still didn’t come back, I felt my heart became heavy as I grabbed my phone, realizing it was 2 am. I tried calling my wife, but she still didn’t pick up. I got worried as I made my way to the living room, calling my wife again as I walked around in the living room, but this time I was able to hear her phone ringing, I looked around until I realized it was coming from our backyard, I made my way to the glass door for our backyard, about to open it until I saw something. My heart sank as I stood there, my hand frozen on the door. I didn’t feel sadness, not happiness, not anxiety, nothing but pure fear. My wife was on the ground, missing her face, her stomach open, and being eaten by something. That **thing** wasn’t a human, not an animal, it was an abomination. It had no face, but it wore multiple people and animal faces including my wife. It had so many limbs that just weren’t possible to be on a single body. Human, goat, deer, and all kinds of animal limbs. They all looked broken yet it didn't seem to bother that **thing**. It stopped eating my wife, slowly raising what I can assume is its head, looking at me.

I wanted to bolt as far away as I could, but my legs were frozen in fear, my entire body frozen in fear. I was only able to move my eyes as I felt a new kind of fear I never felt before. I looked at it. My brain could only rationalize it as a hallucination. I refused to believe this thing is real, yet I couldn’t move my body out of fear. I moved my gaze to the watch on my hand. It was 2:24 am. I heard the voice of my wife saying “Honey!”, my gaze returned to that thing. It came closer. It didn’t make a single noise, yet this **thing** was able to get closer. My gaze returned to the watch, 2:24 am. My wife’s voice called out to me again, my gaze returning to that **thing**, it was standing outside the door. It could have killed me already if it wanted to, but it seemed like it wanted to toy with me. It must have been a hallucination. I looked back at the watch, hearing my wife’s voice again. It was 2:24 am. I realized what was going on, I gathered what little strength I had in me and bolted for the door, as I heard that thing breaking down the glass door, letting out a screech that tore my ears. I couldn’t go outside; it would just go after me there. I went for the basement, slamming the door and closing it. Now I’m sitting here alone. I can hear it breaking down the door. It won’t stop telling me to open the door with my wife’s voice.

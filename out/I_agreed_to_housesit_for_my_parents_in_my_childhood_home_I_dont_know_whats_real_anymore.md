[Last Night ](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/w46vbn/i_agreed_to_housesit_for_my_parents_in_my/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share)

 My dreams weren't as awful last night. Before I woke for the 5 AM feeding, I only remember one, and even that one is fuzzy.

I was a kid again and playing with Mr. Smiles, but this time his age was right. He had shorter, jet black hair still swept back into a sort of spiky puff. He still wore his odd outfit, but the lab coat was bright white, almost new.

I don't remember much of the dream, but I remember the end. Mr. Smiles sat down next to me and sighed. He pulled his goggles up to his forehead and tucked the plastic smile into his lab coat pocket. He looked at me with his one good eye, googly eyes still jiggling on his forehead, and his mouth strained into the closest thing to a smile I think I had ever seen on his face, even though the corners of his mouth were the only part of his face smiling.

"You know I love you kids. I did everything I could for you. I'll keep doing that as long as I can." The high pitched Mickey Mouse voice was gone now, his normal, raspy voice taking its place. It was a voice I was used to hearing him use with my dad, but never me, even as an adult it was always a funny voice, but not always Mickey.

I think I saw a tear quivering in the corner of his good eye, and he leaned over to ruffle my hair and kiss my forehead.

I woke up to my alarm actually feeling at peace. Mr. Smiles was terrifying in his own way, but he was always fun and he always looked out for us. I was a wreck when my parents told me he passed, but even moreso that I couldn't get to his funeral due to the pandemic. I can only imagine how my dad felt - Smiles was a bit older, but my dad had known him since before any of us were born. They were best friends in a way.

My warm fuzzy feeling didn't last.

I got up to feed the dogs, and while Ollie was asleep on the foot of my bed, Pork was nowhere to be seen.

My bedroom door was ajar.

So was the closet.

I prepared myself to be thrown back into the cycle of false awakenings and nightmares that had spun me around yesterday. I opened the closet.

It was a normal closet, no secret doors, no ghost clowns, no mirrors.

I walked into the hall outside my bedroom and thought for a second my brother must have gotten back in the middle of the night. The door to his childhood room was across the hall from mine and it was slightly open too. Then I looked around and turned back into my room.

Every door in the hallway was slightly ajar.

I had closed every door in the house the day before. This was like someone was toying with me. 

"Nobody plays with Mr. Smiles anymore." Rang through my head.

I wasn't about to go around the house unarmed, so I grabbed my tool belt and changed back into my dad's outfit from yesterday. It was a bit musty and I reminded myself to go collect a few outfits from his room later today.

I decided that for now, I would just close the doors as I passed them and would re-search the house when it was light out. The priority was finding Pork and getting her food and insulin.

I went back out of my room and called Pork's name. No response. I closed my brother's door. Grabbing the handle was oddly difficult. I realized my wrist was still puffy.
 
I turned left and walked past the stairway to close the door to my parents' room.

I went back down the stairs, leaving the other half of the upstairs rooms open. I would get them on my way back up.

I got to the kitchen and closed the pantry. I was glad at first to see the exterior doors and windows shut. The alarm was still armed. Then I realized that meant whoever decided to open the doors was still in the house. I felt like the Baby Bear coming home to discover someone ate my porridge and vandalized my furniture.

Two paths led out of the kitchen. Well 4 actually, but I wasn't going outside and I had just come down the stairs. I went through the arch to the dining room on the left.

Fortunately, there were very few interior doors downstairs. The house wasn't open-concept, but it opted for rustic, wood-framed arches with little carvings.

I chose the left side because it was the fastest way to the living room. The dogs had big beds in one half of the living room, and if Pork wasn't in with me, she would probably be in her bed there. I called out her name again and saw one of the cats dart across the arch in front of me.

I walked into the living room and there were plenty of dozing dogs, but none of them Pork.

Then I heard some muffled barking.

"Pork?" I called

"Bork!" Came her response. I traced the sound to a closed door on the back wall of the room. I guess not _all_ the doors were open. It was my dad's office.

I pulled out my hammer and opened the door. Pork borked at me again, alone in the room.

"Come on girl" I said.

She stood on the other side of my salt line and whimpered at me. I noticed the line was intact, but it looked like it had been broken and hastily pushed back together again. The room was oddly 5 degrees warmer than the rest of the house.

"Pork. Time to eat let's go" I patted my thigh and turned slightly to go.

She whimpered at me.

I tucked my hammer back into the belt and walked into the room to carry her out. My back already hurt at the thought, she was a bulldog mix and must have been 80 pounds.

She recoiled from me as I bent over and growled. I almost tripped and then as I shifted my right foot to keep my balance, I felt a sting of pain. I overcorrected and threw myself back, falling on my ass with a thud in the doorway.

Pork borked again cheerfully and trotted out of the room past me. I examined my foot and found a shard of glass the size of my pinky caught in the soft flesh of my foot's arch. I plucked it out and looked for something to staunch the bleeding.

There was a small towel on the corner of my dad's desk that looked like he used it to erase his whiteboard, due to the black smudges littering it. Not super hygienic, but better than leaving bloody footprints everywhere.

I grabbed it and sat in his chair to tie it around my foot. While I was sitting there, I glanced at his desk top and noticed a handheld mirror. Weird.

I picked up the mirror and examined myself in it, half expecting to see myself without a face again. Maybe this whole thing _was_ a dream after all.

My face was normal, but as I looked into it, I noticed a broken window on the wall behind me. I spun around to look, but it was still just a solid wall.

Maybe this is what my mom was talking about with the mirrors?

I didn't want to think about it anymore. I put the mirror back down and left the room, limping. Before I closed the door, I realized I had broken my salt line when I fell, and quickly pushed it back into a solid line.

It took me a good 10 minutes to get back up to my room, where Pork was waiting with Ollie.

I fed the dogs and went back to sleep. I wasn't even scared at this point, just so tired.

I woke up around 8 am and went about my morning routine. Some of you might be thinking that this many dogs with special needs would be too much to handle. Having not lived at home a while, I can understand that mindset, but when I got here, I was actually surprised to see so few animals.

When I was younger, me and my siblings would each have 2 or 3 pets of our own at any given time. My parents usually had more than all of our pets put together.

They had sheep, lizards, dogs, cats, rodents, fish, birds, you name it. For a time, we even hosted three wolf pups. My parents didn't care what types of animals they had, only the conditions under which they got them.

My parents rules were that the animals couldn't be from pet stores or breeders, only some sort of rescue, and that anything wild that could and should return to the wild would eventually do so.

We had to follow those rules for our pets, but they took it a step further and looked for the animals most at risk. 

The dogs they picked were from kill shelters, with medical conditions, or advanced age, or aspects of their appearance that made them less desirable for most people. Most of our dogs couldn't keep their tongues in their mouths due to removed, decayed teeth. 

My dad adopted dozens of pitbulls rescued from dog fighters and rehabilitated them, before finding them permanent homes. In most cases, those dogs did better in a home with one or two other dogs at most. Our house was a bit much, and the pits were kept somewhat isolated from our other pets while they were in rehab.

The sheep were bought when a meat farm was in financial straits, and we only ever used them for wool. My mom would knit sweaters as Christmas gifts.

My dad found the wolf pups when he was out hiking late one autumn. He heard them whimpering and howling from a few yards off the path and sat in the cold for five hours waiting for their mother to return. Then he went and scooped them up and brought them home.

We were all excited of course when they came back. We mostly weren't allowed near them, so my youngest brother, Zeke snuck into the barn they slept in one night the following autumn to play with them. One of them bit his pinky off, and the barn got a padlock on it the next morning.

I remember my dad sitting us down to talk after that. Zeke was so mad and called the wolves all sorts of names. He had landed on "monsters" at some point, and my dad flushed, calling all of us to sit down.

"Just because something is dangerous doesn't mean it is evil. Just because you don't think the same way as it does, doesn't make it a monster." He started "That mentality is why your mother and I do what we do. So many people see a pitt bull and see a scary monster. So many people would kill..." He tapered off and took a breath. Continuing more calmly "So many people get scared and would rather

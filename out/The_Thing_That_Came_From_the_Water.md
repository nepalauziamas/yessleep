  

I’ve come here to report my findings. I don’t know if what I have seen was real, but even now as I write this, it hasn’t gone away. I’m at my family’s beach house on the coast of a southern California college town. This was supposed to be my one week out of the year that I could escape my worries and the stresses of life. But it has turned into something much more horrifying. I might be on the brink of insanity, but I’m almost certain I am not.

Before this, I was on a stroll down the sands of the beach. Right now, it’s almost midnight. When I was out there, I could feel the cold sand beneath my bare feet. I was holding my slides in my hand while taking in the smell of the sea. The tide would pull towards me, and my feet would become drenched, but the water wasn’t cold. There was no moon out seemingly, and I was at peace. Pitch darkness and the absence of any other person gave me a feeling of liberty. I felt as if the world was mine and I was the only one existing on it. The only thing that took me out of this immersive state were the lights from the houses lining the beach a way off to my left, so I didn’t look at them.

Maybe fifteen minutes into my walk was where I saw it. Something in my path maybe ten yards ahead of me. I at first figured it was some driftwood or a length of seaweed, or some sea animal that washed up to shore as I knew often, they did. It seemed from where I was that it may have been five feet long, and not too wide. As I approached, it got larger, and I grew curious. Now maybe ten feet from the thing, it seemed to double in length. I assumed I didn’t see it’s true size because it was so dark, and I was far away at first. There was also now a rancid smell that I couldn’t ignore. At this point I assumed that it was probably something dead.

I had stopped for a minute to pull out my phone so I could use the flashlight. I had a few notifications that caught my eye but swiped them away after a few seconds. It was then, that I had been standing there for not 10 seconds, that I heard it. 

&#x200B;

A noise so terrible that I saw my vision go red while still looking at the screen of my phone. It was loud but the noise itself wasn’t meant to be. It was like a “hiss” from an aggroed cat but multiplied to levels unfathomable to human ears. After almost falling to the ground, I somehow still had my phone out, so I quickly tapped for the flashlight and what I saw was so unnatural, I may struggle to describe it. 

&#x200B;

The thing in front of me was not dead, it was moving towards me, now maybe just reaching a yard away from my feet. I was paralyzed at the horrible sight. This was no natural creature, as I had assumed, it was something terrible. It moved like a leech the size of an overgrown human, making that terrible noise as it grew ever closer. Three feet, then maybe two, and I snapped out of it. As I did so, I almost heaved at the pungent stench while slowly backing away from the thing. I still had my light on it and almost as if it knew I was about to escape it lifted it’s frontside closest to me and revealed what I can only assume was its face.

&#x200B;

What I saw was a nightmare. Three rows of stacked teeth on either side of it, but instead of having a top and bottom jaw, these rows of teeth were on the right and left. All were pointy and moving in unison. Three or more eyes were placed between each row of teeth and blinked at random. It seemed like it was too late, like doom was already upon me, but I was able to turn around and started racing home. 

&#x200B;

I could still here it behind me, in fact, it was almost keeping pace. I was slipping in the sand as I had dropped my shoes I was holding as soon as I began running. It was at the most a quarter mile back to my beach house, and this thing was going to follow me the whole way. The hissing was growing louder. I begged for someone to be outside, so I could realize this was just a dream. There was no one.

&#x200B;

I *did* make it, but just barely, I think. I slammed and locked the door then heard it almost immediately. Hissing, making its unnatural sound as I stood and stared at the door for a good-few minutes. I could see a liquid seeping from under the door that looked like a thick swamp water, and the smell came again with it. I finally vomited while struggling to keep my sight on the door. It was there and it wasn’t leaving. I thought about calling the authorities and that is when I started to think I was crazy. I must be dreaming or having a psychotic episode. There is no way this mutation chased me back to my house and stayed outside stalking me for what seemed like an eternity.

&#x200B;

I waited it out and the thing finally went away around dawn. I was watching it the whole night from the upstairs bedroom window. I don’t think I looked away I could see it breathing but in a weird pattern that didn’t look sustainable. I should have taken a picture, but I was so fixated that I never had the thought to. Who the hell would believe it anyway?  

&#x200B;

I’m delirious now as I’m writing this, and the sunlight is making me tired. I don’t want to sleep. I don’t even want to open my door. I don’t know what that thing was, but I don’t think I imagined it. I can still smell it. I have no one close to me to meet me here so I think I will just try and make it to my car outside. I’ll probably get a hotel or sleep in a parking lot. I’m still afraid it will find me. 

&#x200B;

That is all for now, I am so tired and will fall asleep sitting here before long. I’m going to leave now. I’m not staying here any longer.

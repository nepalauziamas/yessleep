Keeping a hand on my sidearm at all times, we pushed on. I didn’t even dare slap the bugs away trying to make a meal out of me. The further we went, the more the darkness fought against the torch light. I needed to stay on Gavin's heels to stay inside the light. He was also looking tense. Beads of sweat ran down his face, the man looking ready to attack at any moment.  

Squinting, I thought I say something beyond our light. A small dot of color. We slowly got closer and the color grew larger. It appeared to be a flickering light. A candle maybe. Hope filled my chest for a second. 

“Is that-?” I asked in a whisper. 

Something in the darkness reacted to my voice. A large claw came down on Gavin causing him to cry out in pain. It torn away his clothing and took parts of his chest with it. The torch was dropped and somehow, he managed to push me back and out of danger. I watched horrified on the ground from being shoved so hard I fell over my own feet. Gavin clutched at his bleeding chest and growled at whatever attacked a second before.  

“The hut is a bit ahead of us! Run towards the light!” He shouted over his shoulder. 

The claw came back into out light and he jumped back, causing his wounds to spill blood over the ground. I stood on trembling legs wanting to help. My gun was out without being aware I drew it.  

“I can’t leave you!” I said sternly. 

“Don’t be stupid! Just run! I’ll be fine!” 

His words were nearly cut off by the claw coming back. This time he grabbed a hold of it by the wrist, his fingers digging into the black scaled flesh. He did not, in fact, look fine. Even so, I needed to trust him. I couldn’t do anything else. I ran, leaving him behind with the torch. When I was a few feet away I realized that was what he was waiting for. He could not fight back unless I was out of the way. 

A roar along with the sounds of trees being torn from the Earth made me look at where Gavin once stood. From his form burst forth a massive creature. The man was not human but I never imagined what he truly was. Flames burst from the small torch to surround his true body, swirling dangerously. In felt the heat from where I stood. A giant tail came crashing through and knocked thin trees aside. In the middle of those glowing flames stood an albino alligator. He tore through the darkness, large whips of his tail nearly missing me as I fled. The creature could easily tear apart the Bayou if it wished.  

I ran away from the scene, towards he flickering light in the darkness. Tripping along I didn’t slow down. The battle I left echoed through the dark. No matter how much I pushed it felt like that small flicker of a candle wasn’t getting closer. A hand darted from the inky dark, grabbing a hold of my arm. I shook it off to keep running. When I nearly drowned, countless hands tried to take me down into the water. Now, they were trying to pull me into the never-ending darkness. They tore at my clothing, ripped and doing their best to keep me still. 

I wasn’t going to give up. I refuse. Catfish was going to die unless I kept running. He couldn’t save me this time and Gavin was busy with bigger threats. More and more of those hands grabbed as I pulled my body away. It felt like I was walking through molasses. And yet the candle light didn’t get any closer. The moment my body nearly gave up on its own, I slammed into something.  

Fumbling in the dark, my hands ran along the wall I was against to find it wasn't a wall, but a door. Finding the handle, I put everything I had left to push open the door and fell into a small hut. I collapsed to the wooden floor, unable to stay awake any longer. 

I woke up not knowing where I was or how long I’d been out for. Sitting up my head felt heavy and body throbbed in pain. I was in a small hut, candles burning for light and a fireplace on the far side of the room burning away. Instead of a spooky witches' hut I’d expected, the place was decorated in lace and soft pastel colors. Plush armchairs and couches looking like they were from the sixties sat. Tea sets lined the shelving. I slowly stood not knowing if I arrived in the right place. 

“Human, what brings you here?” 

A raspy voice made me jump. I grabbed for my weapon to find it missing. Those hands from before must have grabbed it. The voice belonged to a creature standing by the fire I was certain hadn’t been there before. It was a bit taller than myself. A cloak kept most of its face and form hidden but the long snout poking from under the fabric made it clear what the creature was. Clawed hands picked up a fire poker to move the embers around as I collected myself. I was staring at an upright alligator. A long tail came from under the cloak leaving drag marks on the dusty floor. 

“I... Catfish is hurt. I've come here for some help, uh, Miss...?” 

No one had told me this creatures name. All I knew was it was female. After poking the fire some more, she replaced the poker. Finally, she turned her half-hidden face in my direction.  

“Names hold power. You shall not learn mine. I may be able to help you. Are you aware there shall be a price for my assistance?” Her voice was low and hard to hear as if she didn’t speak often. 

“Anything to save him. Please, I can’t let Cat die.” 

It wasn’t wise to show how desperate I was but after everything I couldn’t hold it back. A soft sound almost like a laugh came from her as she walked over to a table holding countless teacups. 

“Things? I do not desire things. They are... Boring.” With those words she dropped the teacup letting it shatter on the floor. “But words, they are not. They hold power. They can amuse me. My price to save Catfish is simple. Answer my question. Why do you wish to save him?” 

As she spoke, she walked over until her snout almost touched my face. I felt myself start to sweat form stress. What did she mean? Why did anyone need a reason to want to save someone? It was just something people did without thinking. There had to be some sort of trap in this simple question. 

“He's a good kid. Of course I would want to save him.” I answered and it didn’t please her. 

“A kid? That creature is almost as old as the Bayou itself. But I suppose he never truly matured. But that is not your true answer. I ask again. Why do you wish to save him?” 

Things I wanted to forget started to creep in. The reasons for moving and leaving everything behind. The reasons why I changed my entire life and went somewhere I knew nothing about. This creature knew it was related to why I kept buying lunch for Catfish and why we still spent time with each other. I shook my head trying to banish the thoughts.  

“It just... There isn’t a reason.” I lied. 

She gave out a hiss. Backing away I felt words catch in my throat. I knew she was about to toss me out. Unless I said the truth Catfish wouldn’t be saved and yet admitting my shame was harder than fighting through the Bayou. I just wanted to forget everything. Yet it was my past that could save someone I cared about. I stood trying to speak. It was like a nightmare where I couldn’t even scream.  

“I...” That single word broke the damn and the rest flooded out. “I want to save him because my girlfriend miscarried and I'm scared I won’t have kids. She... never wanted any and yet it just happened. I didn’t know how badly I wanted to raise a child until we lost ours. For months I kept thinking of the possible outcomes of what it could have been and what never happened. My son or daughter died that day and... My girlfriend nearly did too. Christ, I’m such an awful person I cared more about not having a child more than her life. So, I moved thinking it would be better for her. When I saw Catfish I just... Felt as if he was the child I’d never met. I’m such a piece of shit. I want to save him because I’m using him as a replacement.” 

Tears came to my eyes and I kept my head down unable to meet the creature’s gaze. Admitting everything for the first time out loud hurt more than anything else in my life. Cutting an arm off would have hurt less. It was something I could never forgive myself for. Regardless of how I saw Catfish, he didn’t deserve to die because of my feelings. The creature let out another hiss but this time it sounded as if she was laughing.  

“You humans never cease to amuse me. Fine. Wait one second.” 

My head shot up chest feeling light hoping I’d heard her right. She shuffled around digging through cupboards and teapots. Finally, she found what she was looking for. She walked over to hand me a vial of clear liquid.  

“Pour some of this over his wound and make him drink the rest. Now hurry and get your disgusting alligator out form here. He's making the worst racket and I can’t stand it.” 

The thank you was stuck in my throat. Instead, I raised an eyebrow at the alligator comment. She waved a hand in a shooing motion. 

“I'm a crocodile. Do not confused me for those inept swamp creatures.” 

Even from all my stress, I almost laughed. Finally thanking here, I left the hut frightened of what I would see outside. What was outside was a sight I never would expect. The Bayou was brighter, looking like the sun just rose. In front of the hut was a trail of destruction. Deep grooves in the ground were water started seeping in. Trees torn apart or smoldering. In the middle of the mess stood Gavin looking perfectly fine.  

“I made a short cut back.” He announced.  

I was starting to think this guy was the scariest thing in the Bayou at that moment. I was thankful Catfish made friends with him. We wasted no time on small talk. Racing through the path Gavin opened up was found the boat much faster than expected. It was agony siting on the wooden seat as the boat floated along. Catfish was out there still hurt and I just wanted to get back to him as fast as possible.  

Finally, I saw him through the trees. I again got out of the boat to rush over to the boy. Vial in hand, mu heart sank when Catfish appeared even worse than before. Wasting no time, I lifted the blanket to get a, look at his wound for the first time. I nearly shut down at the gaping hole on his side. Steadying myself I did what I was told. Pouring the liquid over the wound made Catfish flinch showing he was still alive. Getting him to drink some was a bit of a task. After the vial was empty, I took him into my arms to wait. 

Gavin stayed on the boat, not even looking in our direction. He must feel guilty for Catfish getting hurt in the first place and couldn’t bring himself to go over to him. I wasn’t sure what I was waiting for. As I held the boy his wound healed when I wasn’t paying attention. He coughed a few times than sat up with his own strength. Looking around confused, his eyes landed on me alive but worn out. Unable to help himself, he crushed my ribs in a tight hug.

“I was worried you weren’t going to come back! Promised me to never do anything stupid like that again!” Catfish scolded.  

I hugged him back so thankful he was alive. Going through any kind of nightmare Bayou was well worth his life. His clothing torn he looked just as bad as I did. Giving him a proper look over, I noticed something different about the boy. It was hard to place. His freckles were toned down slightly and his mouth didn’t appear as wide as before.  

“It appears the one who kept me alive has a terrible sense of humor. Looks like I was healed but also turned into a human.” Catfish announced after looking himself over. 

“What? Why?” I asked shocked. 

“Well, I lied to you before when I said I was just a catfish. I’m... I was something else. But because human would not understand my form, I went with a name of something I resembled. The organ that was stolen is something humans do not have. So, if I’m human I would no longer be dying due to it missing.” 

My mouth dropped open as he spoke. It made sense in a way. But was it really easy to change what he was instead of just healing him? Or maybe that woman did it for a laugh.  

“What are you going to do now? I mean, can you live here with all these dangerous monsters around? Do you think Gavin can watch over you?”  

Catfish looked over at the man standing in the boat watching us before shaking his head.  

“I suppose. This will wear off and I’ll return to what I was before fully healed but... I don’t know how long it can take. There is a chance I’ll survive here until then but... it is a dangerous place. I guess I’ll just have to make it work.” 

He nearly died and yet Catfish didn’t look concerned. He gave a shrug not worried about his future. After all, we met because he was alright trying to eat from the garbage. He might be just fine being homeless but I couldn’t let that happen. 

“You can stay with me.” I told him. 

That startled him more than his near-death experience. Shaking his head, he was refusing because he was embarrassed rather than not wanting to take my offer. 

“I couldn’t...” He started shyly. 

“This is a selfish offer on my part.” I told him. I spent the next few minutes explaining to him what made me move in the first place and how I’d been using his company.  

I found the words easier to say a second time. I fully expected him to hate me or be disgusted over the truth of why I wanted him in my life. Instead, he gave a calm smile.  

“As long as you’re happy and don’t mind me taking up space then I would like to stay with you until I return to what I was before.” 

It was a mutual beneficial agreement. Catfish got food and shelter, and I could treat him like the child I wanted. It may be twisted and selfish on my part but he didn’t appear to care in the slightest. Gavin brought along the boat so we could get out of the Bayou. Catfish was sill exhausted so he fell asleep as the boat drifted along towards the dock. Staring at Gavin's back I felt a little guilty taking Catfish away. 

“Is this alright?” I asked the man. 

“As long as he’s happy, then it is.” 

We didn’t speak again until the boat bumped against the wooden dock. I lifted Catfish onto my back to carry him off the boat. Pausing I looked at Gavin who still stood in the boat giving me a cold stare. 

“You should go back home. You don’t belong in the Bayou.” I told him. 

His face twisted in a snarl at those words. For a moment, I thought he would attack.  

“I told you, I’m a monster. I do belong there.” He hissed in rage. 

“You kept the wedding ring.” I replied in a soft tone. 

His face fell then he turned it away looked distraught over that fact. He couldn’t hide the fact he loved the man he married. The relationship may have started out as revenge but it turned into something more than that. I wondered if his partner was hurting more now that he left. He walked back to the front of the boat and it started to drift away from the dock. 

“I’ll think about it.” Gavin said finally before he got too far away. 

I watched until he was out of sight before turning away to bring Catfish home. 

In the days after that event, I told my boss my nephew arrived and I was taking care of him for a while. Catfish would drop by the station to bring me lunch on days we didn’t go out. Everyone loved him. I wanted to put him in school but because he didn’t have any kind of paperwork that was impossible. Instead, we started on worksheets found online as homework.  

Neither of us know how long he would remain human for. It could be a year; it could be longer. Until he returned to the Bayou, I was glad to let him stay. 

A few months after taking in Catfish I walked into work and noticed something different. A small change that made me smile. Troy Gavin’s photo was taken down from the fallen officer wall. He might not have returned home, but at least now people knew he was still alive. It was a small step and I was proud of him.

Peter sighed as he sat down heavily. It had been a long night that he never signed up for, but his industry only guaranteed unpredictability.
He had a frozen meal in front of him, while his dog looked on in anticipation for some scraps. Peter was going to feed Nara her wet food when he was done, he was shaky like his blood sugar was low. Plus the dang lady had a full bowl of dry food, she just loved her wet food and table scraps above all else.


He gave her a good few pets and told her as much as he got comfortable in front of a device he had gotten not too long ago: a computer. It weighed a ton and looked like a mini TV. While booting it up with a loud click on the tower, it looked like the screens of video games he had as a kid, just a bit cleaner, with tons of numbers and things he would later learn about. Everyone he knew couldn't stop talking about computers, so he couldn't help himself when he found out he had gotten a rare holiday bonus. The managers were being generous this year.
He dialed up to the internet, trying to ignore the screeching hurting his ears, honing in on his excitement of connected to an internet forum he had just found maybe a week or two ago. He told himself not to get his hopes up, even those with the best internet connection still had it cut out at random, so he knew even if he did connect, his time could be limited.
When he discovered the website he couldn't believe that he was talking to people in other states, let alone countries.
He only knew English and some spotty swear words in other languages he had learned from coworkers, so communication could be limited, but it still gave him something to look forward to.
Comparing countries and customs, traditions and sharing as much as he learned.
The world was suddenly much bigger than he had ever thought.


His spacing out, letting his dinner get cold was suddenly interrupted by rapping at his door, it sounded like his neighbor, but usually it was a slow knock as she surely was trying to think of how to word the latest building gossip in the most dramatic way. Nara started losing her shit; she was no guard dog but when it came to loud noises, squirrels, and visitors, she was not afraid to be vocal or get hyper.
This was different. 

He sighed and groaned as he started to stand, looking longingly at his already cold shitty food and slow booting computer. 

He grumbled as the knocking grew louder and faster, and prepared himself as he flung the door open. 

She was insistent on STILL sharing all of the neighborhood gossip with him, even though he made it clear he was disinterested. But he had never walked away from her or shut the door in her face, as some as his younger, similar age neighbors had. He didn’t have the heart to, and he paid for it. 

Before the door was even open and he had started squeaking out a hello, she pushed past and squeezed into his hallway. 

She actually looked afraid, and he felt alarmed, trying to get her to make out intelligible sentences instead of the weird torrent of broken words she was letting out.


He finally differentiated some, like “Y2K” and “losing electricity”. 

He scoffed inwardly. He had heard about this and narrowed his eyes. 

His coworkers and the crappy crackpot news channels had been talking about this non stop for a few weeks. It was all bullshit to get people to panic, or maybe a ploy to get people to stay home on NYE so there were less problems for the city and the cops that night.


He counted to ten while taking deep breaths, took her gently by the shoulders, slowly guiding her out of his apartment back into the hallway, trying to be soothing as he told her it was a hoax and something to rile people up with. 

She sputtered and said that it was true, and he pointed out that they had won by riling her up. More than dramatic, she was stubborn and prideful. 

That seemed to calm her, or at least shut her up for a second. He didn’t hate her and hated seeing her worried, but she lived at her peephole and lived for talking about people, embellishing the truth. 

But he knew she was lonely and this apartment was her entire universe, so he didn’t revel too much in taking her down a notch. 

He just wanted peace and quiet, and this disheveled yippy lady was the opposite. 

He told her that he would knock if he heard anything else about this Y2K, but that she shouldn’t worry, and she seemed to finally calm down as she turned to shuffle down the hallway. 

God damn, he hated living under her microscope, but he couldn’t help but feel for her.


Finally he shut his door and headed back inside, sighing for the millionth time that night, but finally with a little relief. He had been herding Nara away from the neighbor and the door to the apartment hallway the whole time with his knee, and got her wet food served to hopefully settle her down. Nara loved running off her zoomies in the hallway, and strangely, the old neighbor usually seemed to love her, though Peter would have taken her for a cat lady. She was way too distracted tonight to dole out pets to Nara.


Heading back into the living room, he noticed he was finally connected. 

Some good luck on this stupid night.


He had been on the forum pretty frequently whenever he wasn’t disconnected and convinced himself to go to bed in disappointment after, even though he should have been hours previously. 

After nights of exploring it, chatting with a few people across the Untied States, he discovered a thread where people from different countries were sharing their cultures and what life was like for them where they lived. It fascinated him, and he quickly jumped onto the threads and even had been PMing people that he seemed to click with. Everyone seemed to have so many typos and weird things off, but the internet was new, he told himself he was just a stickler for grammar and spelling.


One he had been communicating with was a man that was named Troy, and based on their interactions, they seemed the same age or at least same generation, roughly. He never mentioned which country exactly he was from, Peter assumed it was the Untied States or a country pretty similar because their descriptions of their land and culture seemed so close. Peter was pretty much on there to learn about vastly different countries, it made the world seem bigger, and him and his simple problems seem more small. 

Nonetheless, Troy and him sometimes PMed back and forth about random things like food and funny things going on in the news. Troy told him about this show “Friends” that people were losing their minds over despite a long run already. Peter assumed that he just thought of the wrong word for “Pals”, people were losing their minds here over it too. The same with the movie Titan, though Troy had called it Titanic. 

The errors were starting to get to Peter because they were so close, but he was so excited to have someone new to talk to that he brushed it off. 

Troy didn’t seem to be online tonight, so he read a few posts about different cultures’ food and some of their mythology and societal customs, messaged a few other people he had been PMing with to say hi, and soon hit a wall and told himself how miserable he’d be in the morning if he didn’t get some sleep.


A few days later, Peter had one of his few rare days off. He groggily stumbled out of bed, deleted the four new messages off of his answering machine without listening to them, and heated up leftovers of an actual decent meal he had gotten half off at work. 

He had heard his phone ring faintly in a daze of sleep throughout the day, and knew it had to be a couple old friends and some family members he had been dodging for the better part of a year, no one else ever called his landline, aside from a boss needing a shift covered. He wasn’t in the mood for any of them.


He half shoveled food in his mouth as he clicked the button to turn on his computer. Maybe he’d search AskYeeves for the new music video he just saw on MTV. He kept his TV on most of the time for background noise, and heard a song that actually caught his ear. He didn’t catch the name, though, so it was going to be a bitch to hunt down, so he kept the TV on the same channel in case it played again.


He zoned into shitty commercials when the internet finally connected, and he pulled up AskYeeves, along with the forum he signed into most days of the week. 

He was distractingly trying to think of some line from the song when he got frustrated and switched to the forum, maybe a break would make it pop into his head randomly like an ear worm.


He saw a few messages in his private messages, so clicked over. Most were a few “friends” as he called them for simplicity, sending him recipes for food he expressed interest in, or suggestions of places he should go if he ever had enough money to travel, and a couple from Troy. 

He clicked on Troy’s message:


“Hey dude, have you heard about this Y2K thing? My uncle is making a big stink about it and I keep telling him it’s all bullshit, but his head is up his ass like usual. It’s all anyone can talk about, it’s so annoying. Plus it seems like everyone is on edge because of it. As if people aren’t already giant assholes in the first place. Haha. At least it will be over in about a week.”


Peter laughed to himself, they were really living similar lives. He sent back: 

“Yeah, my batshit neighbor was freaking out about it the other night. We’ve had electricity for how long? Nothing could wipe it out aside from tornadoes and shit like that! Plus there’s candles if it does go out. I’m sure some genius would get it back on in like a day.”


Troy seemed to be online because he instantly responded with:


“Yeah everyone thinks I’m weird because I think that it’s fake, but whatever. It’ll blow over and everyone will feel stupid” 

This made Peter feel better, even though there were plenty of people that didn’t believe it or were at least skeptical about it, but it was somehow more comforting to hear from a stranger.


He sent to Troy:


“Did you watch MTV at all today? I’m trying to find this song that I heard on there”


“You mean STV? The tail end right as I got home from work! If we’re thinking of the same one it was good”


Peter thought it was weird, but maybe the guy lived in Kanata or something.


“No, MTV! One of the most famous music channels in the world!”


No response from Troy. His internet must have cut out. Peter sighed and browsed for a bit before he got his work clothes ready before bed. 

He went to the kitchen to get some water and maybe a snack, and noticed a note that had been slid under his door. 

Some apartment crap, he thought to himself, but as he got closer it looked handwritten.


“The end is coming”, it said, in giant sloppy penmanship. 

Underneath, in smaller writing, it said, “Don’t say I didn’t warn you”


He was immediately livid. It had to be his neighbor. God, she was losing her shit. 

It was late, so he told himself he would deal with this tomorrow before his night shift.


That night he kept waking up every few hours, unable to get comfortable in bed. He tried opening his window to let the fresh night breeze in, meditation videos on youtube, turning his fan on full blast for white noise, but he only drifted off a little bit in between. 

Around 7am he finally fell into an actual sleep. 

Peters’ alarm started going off around 12pm. He swore and turned it off, and felt like he hadn’t gotten any sleep at all. 

All memories of the letter were gone as he stumbled around his kitchen and living room, making a sandwich and deleting more messages off of his answering machine. He must have slept through more calls. 

If it was his boss, he could talk to him when he showed up to work, he thought bitterly. There’s no way he was going to pull another double shift on the fly.

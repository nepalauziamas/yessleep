I hate my house, I should have never moved from the city. I hated the city too but at least there weren’t small scaly creatures running through the walls and torturing my dog. I have been stuck here for nearly two days with very limited communication to the outside world. The creatures took my phone, wallet and keys and no matter what I try I can’t break the windows. I have tried breaking them with everything, chairs, bricks, not even a sledgehammer would do the job. And there is like an invisible wall blocking all other exits. And the longer I am trapped the more aggressive the creatures seem to get.

The creatures are continuously crawling on the inside of the walls, they only come out to irritate me and they do a damn good job of it. I haven't seen them come out of anywhere or crawl into anywhere, I have seen their short slimy asses running around taking things.

Last night I made a pathetic attempt to sleep. I was sleeping for five minutes then I would stay awake for about two hours.Truth be told, I didn’t really want to sleep,  the only reason I stayed in bed was I believed that I needed the energy for the day ahead, and I felt guilty knowing that my dog was slowly getting ripped apart bit by bit in the very walls I was confined to. After what seemed like an eternity of rolling around inside of the bed feeling sorry for myself, I decided that I should make an attempt to retrieve my dog.

I slowly tiptoed all the way over to the garage quietly so I didn't to alert the creatures of my position in case they figure out what I am doing and try to stop me. I grabbed a hammer and a football helmet (for protection) and sat down in the hallway. And after about a half an hour I heard what I was waiting for, a soft cry coming from the kitchen walls. 

A sudden burst of energy overcame me and I took off like a supercar towards the noise, and once I had entered the kitchen I heard it again, it was the cry of my dog. I ran towards the sound and swung the back of the hammer with all my might towards the sound, making a hole in the plaster.  I repeated this again and again until there was a fist sized hole. I bent down and peered into my destruction and found an eye looking back. I was startled and jumped back, but then I realised that it was too small to belong to the creature, it was my dog. And just as I moved forwards to touch him, he disappeared. I could hear his helpless cries as he was pulled along the inside of the wall.

I felt sick, my heart was racing. They were teasing me and there was nothing I could do about it. I fell down and cried like a little girl for what felt like an eternity until I remembered something. Earlier I emailed the police but they didn’t come. I ran to the computer to find a message. “we dropped by but nobody was there. We will be back tomorrow at three.” How was this possible, I was physically unable to leave the house when they called, yet “nobody was there.” This was ridiculous, I wondered if the creatures did it or if it was something else. It was all so confusing.

I sat staring at my monitor trying to piece together  what has happened so far in hope of retrieving a clue of some sort on how to defeat them, for what felt like a thousand years before it hit me, and I don’t mean an idea. A book from the shelf above my head fell. Then another one fell. It wasn’t until the third one that I decide to look up. This proved to be a terrible idea as when I lifted my head I was greeted with a hardback copy of the shining. I then did what I should have done after the first book, I ran for the door. Just before I reached it, it slammed shut in my face. What happened next seems surreal.

I heard a noise coming from the bookshelf beside me, a loud creaking sound. I slowly turned my head painfully aware of what was to come. The shelf was tilted towards me, getting pushed by three little creatures. They were pushing with their feet on the shelf and their hands on the wall. But they weren’t long enough to make it fall over. I then saw something strange, the light seemed to be acting strange so I turned and looked at the bulb. The next part seemed to happen in slow motion and it seemed to be fit for a cartoon.

A creature was hanging on the bulb swinging wildly, and when he reached the desired momentum he released and flew towards the shelf like a drunken bird, before landing face first on the top of the shelf. Unfortunately for both of us, the shelf began to fall. The last thing I remember was us screaming simultaneously, before everything went black.

I awoke in an attic with a pulsing pain in my head. I slowly brought my hand up to my head and when I brought it back down it was covered in blood. I panicked and scrambled around the attic looking for something that I could place on my head to stop the blood. And in the process I found my phone, wallet and keys. And unfortunately my dog lay beside them, he wasn’t moving and relieved some severe injuries from them large eyed goblin faced freaks. I will get revenge but for now I am trying to call the police repeatedly but it doesn’t seem to be working. I guess I'm just stuck here until those creatures let me out. I hope it's soon.

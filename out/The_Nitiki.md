The Nitiki is a strange being, I'm not sure what it is, but it still terrifies me to this day. It's only appeared a few times over a few years, but I've noticed a pattern, it only appears the night before Halloween. The thing is, you'd think it's just some early trick-or-treater, but no, I don't even think it's human, and I know for a fact it's not normal. I think it sits at the top of the trees near my house, but I can't be sure because all I see are its glowing white eyes and its freakishly long legs that poke out from the sides.

Its face though, I can't even describe it, all I can say is that it has eyes and a mouth, the mouth goes "ear to ear" even though it doesn't have any ears as far as I can tell. another creepy thing about it is that it makes a sound, like a whisper, but I can hear it from about 100 feet away, but it sounds like it's saying "Nitiki" in the raspiest voice I've ever heard, like someone who's chain smoked for 50 years.

I haven't seen it during the day yet, and I hope to god that I don't, I don't even want to see this thing, to begin with. I have a few encounters, but they're all the same, I get home from work, I grab a drink and sit down, then I see it, it whispers to me, I feel an overwhelming sense of fear to the point where I almost have a "panic attack" (it's similar but not the same) and I've never felt that until the Nitiki came around. After that, I feel my chest becoming tight, but not just your regular tightness, this us up with heart attack tightness, then my vision goes blurry, I pass out, then I wake up and it's gone.

I haven't told my wife and probably will never tell her, she hasn't found out because she works late on that day and she's barely on her way home after the whole thing happened and I've already "recovered", so she has no idea that t's happening. I forgot to mention, don't whisper Nitiki, because you will see it too, and I know that because I told my friend about it and he said it in a joking way, like the creepy-yet-funny type of way if you know what I mean, and he started to see it too.

I know I shouldn't have told him about it, but I had to get it off my chest, and telling all of you helps as well, so thank you to all of you that are reading. This is off-topic but I've tried researching it online and through Reddit but I haven't found any leads whatsoever, so I think I might have discovered some type of cryptid. I guess it may be similar to the Rake, but the nitiki is much larger, and as far as I know, the Rake doesn't climb trees to the very top.

Every year it moves closer, I can kind of see more of it, but it's so dark that I can't make out anything other than what I've already mentioned, I live in rural Georgia so it gets really dark due to the lack of light pollution and whatnot. I've tried moving, but in this economy, houses are really expensive, and I'm not the richest man alive, so finding a house for me is hard, and I've lived in this house with my wife for around 10 years now and we've both made a lot of memories here, so it's hard to give it up.

I think it knows I've been writing about it, ever since I wrote the first letter, my health shot straight down, maybe it's a coincidence, but with my anxiety, it's hard to believe it's just a coincidence. I've had to call out of work a few times because I couldn't stop throwing up, one day it's just a cold, the other day I'm throwing up so hard I shit myself, it's bad. I've tried going to doctors, but they can't find out a reason why, they think my immune system might have had some type of stroke I think, or some type of long-term spasm to where it thinks I have an infection when I actually don't.

Ok so I just got back to my desk after taking a shower and the first two letters were sitting on my desk. I kept them in a safe that only I know the combination to, I think it's coming early this year. Fuck me, right?

1:30 am

I was about to go to bed but I heard a loud gasp, it was long too, like when you're about to hold your breath for a long time. I looked everywhere in my house but found nothing, and my wife is asleep, and she occasionally sleep talks but nothing like that.

September 29th, 2021

I had to go to the hospital, I was walking down the stairs and everything hit me at once, the headaches, chest tightness, everything, I passed out when I was at the top of the stairs and that ended up with me falling down an entire flight of stairs, I got a concussion and an intracranial hematoma, which means blood collects between the brain and the skull, and a few fractured bones but nothing other than that. I'm not sure why it was so bad though, I've fallen down these stairs plenty of times and all that happened was I got knocked out when I hit the floor. Maybe because I was unconscious but I don't know.

October is here! ugh

October 9th, 2021

I had to stay in the hospital for quite a bit, the hematoma is pretty serious and can be fatal, so... Also my health has gotten better, but I don't think it'll stay this way once I'm released from the hospital, which might be tomorrow hopefully, but not hopefully.

October 11th, 2021

I got released from the hospital, it's good to be home. Oh I can't wait for the 30th, fuck my life. seriously, what the fuck did I do to deserve this shit?

October 21st, 2021

Why is it that days go by fast when you really don't want them to? I hate the way time works. My health actually hasn't gotten worse, I think all the fluids and antibiotics I got helped recover my immune system in some way, so that's good

October 29th, 2021

Well, tomorrow's the night, if this is the last entry, just know that I'm dead. It was nice getting this off my chest, thank you for reading this far into it, I'm sorry if it's boring, I kind of ran out of things to write, and I've been working on a few other projects, so I haven't really had time to write. While I was in the hospital I didn't have any extra papers so I had to write on the back of the previous notes, and that means I had to save space so yeah. Just a big ol' shitty explanation.

Tonight's the night, my anxiety is flaring up so badly right now, sorry if my words seem choppy, I don't write well under stress. It's around 6pm right now and it's about to get dark. I requested today off so I had the whole day to worry, maybe that was a mistake.

**8:19 pm**

It's starting to get dark. I'm scared shitless. I can't take this anymore. Nothing's happened so far but I know it's about to. I'm going to my friend's house

**8:31 pm**

I'm at his house now. he's been helping me a lot and I'm so thankful he's here for me. I told my wife we were having a get-together at his house so she doesn't worry, she's been concerned about my nervousness, and I've always just told her that being sick makes me nervous, shitty lie, I know.

**9:01 pm**

It's been a boring minute, nothing much has happened and my anxiety has been dying down a little bit. Hopefully it knows I'm not here but again, I can't be sure.

**9:11 pm**

I saw it. I turned around and I saw it, for a split second, I don't know if I'm losing my mind or what.

**9:13 pm**

My friend's been gone for a while now, he said he had to use the bathroom, but it's been a long time since I last saw him.

**9:16 pm**

As I'm writing this, I cant feel breathing on my neck. I know it's not my friend, his breath isn't ice cold.

I’m 16 and live with my mom and sister, I have a very comfortable room, my closet is to the left of my bed, an art wall, and cool tapestry’s, I love it, however there’s one flaw that I just can’t get behind. Some of you may think it’s my closet, but it’s the attic door in the ceiling of my bedroom. 

Normally, I would have no problem with it, it’s simply the fact that it’s in my room.. with someone inside.

Every night all I can hear is shifting. Now I’ve never been able to look in there since I can’t reach, but I can just feel the presence.

It’s disturbing.

This isn’t a presence I want in my home, let alone by bedroom, as that’s where I sleep and change.

I don’t know if it’s human, I don’t know if it’s paranormal, but it’s a strong presence. Not a kind one. A deranged creature. Something that really creeps me out, is the fact that I know this isn’t impossible, I’ve heard numerous stories of people living in others attics. 

I know I’m not insane. My sister has a cat who walks in my room once in a while to hang out, usually school mornings as I’m switching my between different rooms. I was changing as the cat entered the room, he got comfortable on the edge of my bed.. until he heard the tiniest thud, he’s not the only one.

He flinched and looked up toward the attic door, while I looked at him. 

I heard it too

I knew I couldn’t be the only one to hear it, and I was right. There has to be something in there. 

If this …thing… is human, I’m not sure I can get rid of it without me or my family getting hurt. 


Update: I wasn’t planning on posting this, until last night. I woke up and saw this thing climbing out, I couldn’t help but sit up in my bed and scream, hoping someone would hear me. As it heard me scream bloody murder it quickly crawled back into my attic.

During that time I heard it’s scattering across the floor. But it didn’t sound like a regular 2 legs.. it sounded like 4. Whatever is inside of my attic, is walking on 4 legs, but I didn’t see an animal foot, I saw a human hand, a human arm, Human hair. 

My mom walked into my room, my sister flowed close behind, I tried to describe what I just saw, in hopes that they would believe me. Thankfully they were skeptical and willing to help me look. Due to genetics, my sister is 5’10, the tallest, so I grabbed the chair in
My room and she stood on it to open the attic door, she was unable to find the creature, but she could see visible signs of someone living there. For safety reasons I had 911 already on the phone. 

The dispatcher said this wasn’t the first time hearing something like this. I know it sounds crazy, so I’d understand if someone didn’t believe me. 

The police officers showed up and confirmed signs of someone living there. The smell was horrific, like decaying flesh. They got to the back corner of my attic and were faced with the source of the smell, but no creature. There were small dead animals, all torn to shreds.

I’m not sure how, but since then, I haven’t heard any shuffling

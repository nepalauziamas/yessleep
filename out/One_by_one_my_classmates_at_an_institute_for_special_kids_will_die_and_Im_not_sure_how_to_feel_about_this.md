I think I made a deal with the devil...

This guy... He's not human...

He's currently watching me in amusement as I'm typing this. I was trying to get this post hidden from him, but he found out anyway.

He always finds everything. I cannot hide anything. I cannot do anything but to obey him. I'm worthless... He insists I'm not, but the most affection he ever showed me, and anyone for that matter, is saying: "You're my favorite toy."

I've always known I was, but my current situation is just the pinnacle of this shithole I call my life.

I WANTED TO DESTROY THIS WHOLE WORLD! Do you understand?! I hated everything!

But my feelings regarding my life are irrelevant now. Everything is irrelevant. There's only him. He's laughing at my outburst, at me. He's a presence in my life that I'll never get rid off.

**Alicia retiens bien ce que je vais te dire. Je t'autorise à écrire notre histoire sur ce sub-reddit. Mais périodiquement je te prendrai ce téléphone et marquerai ce genre de message, avec cette police d'écriture. Tu as interdiction de les enlever, compris? Marque bien ta réponse à l'écris, j'en veux une trace indélébile.**

Oui... Je comprends.

**Parfait. Et vous; Amusez-vous à traduire ce que je dis si ça vous chante. De toute façon vous ne valez rien à mes yeux, et je suis celui à côté d'elle.** **À bon entendeur.**

So, based on this exchange, I guess you figured out we're both French. More specifically from Normandie. I'm called Alicia and... he wants to be called, T.A.0 It's just his real name stylized though. He's a weirdo on top of everything and since it sounds awful I won't be using it.

Well, I guess I should start from the beginning.

We're both from a certain center for underage troublemakers "Le Rêve Ensoleillé", or "The Sunny Dream" as you'd call it. That name is probably the most ironic thing about this place. I don't even know where it's located due to how they bring new kids each year: By forcefully taking them away from their home, their legal guardian, whoever it is, being an accomplice in this legalized kidnapping.

Honestly, I don't know if I'd blame our parents for sending us here. We're all pretty shitty people, minus those that are crippled with mental trouble or handicap, like Milo or Ambre, screw their guardians for abandonning them here.

...

No, you know what? Fuck them. I don't even know why I'm trying to find some form of justification. We're just teens, some more difficult than others, some shittier than others, but none of us deserved to be sent here.

At least that's what I can say when I'm away from them.

Because this place only brings the worst in us.

Personally, I come from a dirt-poor family. Not because my parents are jobless, or because we were dealt an unlucky hand. They just had a crippling issue with spending moneys and gambling. So we were always low on cash.

I claim guilty to some of this misery, because their poor management of money tainted me. I have a very hard time saving up anything, no matter how hard I try to keep it. Don't think I deserved to get basically left all on my own for my short life, as well as periodic beatings during their bad time. I think I still loved them before they sent me here though.

I don't even remember how many days, months or years have passed since I was sent to this institute. One day, I simply woke up here instead of my room because my food got drugged.

Now, why am I going on a tangent here? It's just to set the stage.

Imagine being into this very cramped and stressful place. One where everyone is at their worst point mentally, and the only possible down time at night. Then, out of nowhere, this girl arrives. She looks worse for wear, with rundown male clothes too big for her, a cap to hide most of her face, bandages all over her arms, and a putried smell comes from her.

That was me.

I was never one for hygiene but the money issue got so bad I was forbidden from ever using the bathroom for any reason other than absolute necessity. At least that's what they told me, but they were pretty clean to me. Even then, I had to spend most time in my room, locked, because my smell was nauseating, most of my deciduous teeth had rotten away, and I had to cut my hair myself because I couldn't bear to have this mass of dirt constantly entering into contact with my body.

The bandages are... not just for beating. My skin contracted pretty gross infections due to how filthy it was.

As for the male clothes, there's no real question to have. Do you really think they'd bother to buy dress or others stuff? Can't say I dislike wearing them though. I feel more confortable in jacket and pants than in a dress. At least the filth is hidden better with these.

Needless to say this made me the perfect target to steam off one's pent up frustration.

I... I'm sure most of these kids aren't bad. It's just the place that's horrible, and with my appearance...

**Tu peux arrêter de prendre leur défense. Tu peux leur dire si tu les détestes. Si tu me détestes.**

You were the worst offender. But unlike others you sought me out after, healed me emotionally and physically, helped me get cleaned up. Then you beat me up again with an even bigger smile on your face. You were enjoying yourself. That's why you're the devil incarnate. You just enjoy this madness. Beating me up to "harvest my hatred", that was just bullshit.

You never told me anything about your past. I don't know you. I don't know who you were before all of this. I just know what you became. A manipulator who has gathered the secrets of everyone here. Adults and children alike.

**Je n'ai jamais vraiment changé. J'ai juste enfin de quoi m'amuser.**

Why have I accepted the help of someone like you? I should have just fend off on my own. Maybe I would have died along the way, but it'd have been better than to serve someone like you. Every insults is better than helping you.

**Ne mens pas Alicia. Tu apprécies aussi ce qui se passe.**

...

Maybe.

Maybe I'm just as insane as you, I was just looking for an excuse to not go on a rampage.

This hatred of mine has never left after all, no matter how much I accuse you.

Yet...

You and your plans scare me so much. Why have you decided to kill our classmates?

Worst of all...

Why have I accepted as long as my hands were kept clean from all of this?

...

Who am I kidding? I'm as bad as Tao. Otherwise I wouldn't have ended up here.

During the biggest beatdown I received I tried to threaten him by saying I'd kill myself. I wanted to see him suffer through my death but he brought me back to my senses. Nobody would care about my demise here. Nobody is my friend here.

Originally, the reason I made this post in the first place was to seek help. But now I'm not sure if I want to saved at all. This feels all so foreign. Partaking in a murder, even indirectally, against someone who wronged you is peculiar, but I don't think I dislike it. It's like the first time I kissed that bastard despite despising him with all of my heart.

I feel love but mostly hate, I feel powerful, in-control, but mostly hate, and now I want more of it, untwisted by my past and experience. I want to destroy my roots so I can grow back a healthier person.

Tomorrow they'll find the first body, that of Maxwell Cunningham a star-gazer, and one of the genuinely nice kids. Tao was amadant about starting with the kind-hearted people so they don't have to suffer seeing what he has in store for the others. I'm scared of him when he's gleeful because his pitch black iris never reflects any light. He should look dead yet he's extremely expressive and never lie. What has he found on the others that truly deserves all that foreshadowing?

He's not the first to disappear, Lilian was pushed onto an incoming car, Florianne was locked somewhere. I don't know what happened. He never told me what he did to them. I'm sorry, I just needed to vent about these two. I know you guys have no idea about who they were. But they were "classmates" as you could call it. They were important.

Tonight I'll shut my eyes and enjoy this last peaceful night before utter chaos breaks onto this institute for abnormal kids.

Maybe this will continue, maybe not. There's always the possibility that I could die myself, or get arrested.

Just in case, I want to do two things in this post.

Firstly, thank you to anyone who took the time to read this introspection.

Secondly, I want to post the name and a small comment for the ones I dared to call "my classmates" at one point. I know it sounds stupid, but I want some form of hommage to remember them by. After all, our records got erased after being taken to "Le Rêve Ensoleillé", so this might be the last proof of their existence:

\-Maxwell Cunningham: A star-gazer that could spend the entire night just watching stars and thinking about them.  as a result he was always tired and butted head a lot with the staff. But at least the others liked him well enough. Our first victim together.

\-Lilian Caboche: He was extremely quiet and secluded. I think he was the previous "scapegoat" before I arrived. He's apparently already dead. Nobody bothered to look for him.

\-Floriane Ost: I don't remember anything about her, apart from her name. Pretty sure nobody does.

\-Marine Henry: A girl of extreme popularity. Apart from her gorgeous appearance, and slightly goth outfit, she has wits and is a hard-worker with a kind heart. At least that's how I see it... Tao wants to keep her around. I also remember the day she helped me out, but I was so scared I fled as soon as I got the chance.

\-Conrad Levis: He's from a rich family but was sent here after a major argument apparently. He's extremely rough around the edges, and often resorts to his fists. Recently though, he became protective of another girl.

\-Ambre des Flandres: The girl Conrad devoted himself to. She seems to suffer from crippling anxiety as well as agoraphobia and frequently got bossed around by the staff. Judging by her name, she probably came from another wealthy family like Conrad, so her behavior might be why she got sent here. She's lucky to have Conrad. Nobody bothered to look out for me, but that freak.

\-Jamie Woods: A scaredy cat. Still, he's one of the more violent teens around here. He got caught with a switchblade in his hoodie at least thrice just this month. Nobody knows what stresses him out, but he seems to be constantly on the lookout for something. Somebody heard him speak self-deprecating words for hours once.

\-Milo Yunova: The quietest kid in our group. He's also the only one that really bothers with the "schoolwork" we're given. He speaks using some kind of slate to write down what he feels, or well, draw how he feels would be a more appropriate description. While his lack of "normal" human behavior does make him unnerving, he's really not a bad fellow.

\-Khalid N'Bala: A guy with an edgy and twisted sense of humor. He's also a strong believer in luck and always carry with him some kind of penny, even simple button at times, just to do his daily flip. Nothing else really worth noting aart from the fact most people find him annoying.

\-Noé Voyageur: Alongside Milo, he's without a doubt the most "out there" of the bunch. He simply is obsessed with ships and travels. His mind always wander towards them. However, he's also perfectly willing to hit others or perform nasty tasks given to him by adults so he can be left alone. Unlike Milo who mostly stick with others like Jamie.

\-Clémentine Tombé: The self-proclaimed "Journalist" of the institute. Really, she's just looking to pry in the personal life of the entire school. She's frustrated at Tao and I because she has nothing on us.

\-Mathias Porto: The biggest brute of the institute.  Of course he was given one of the more important job as an "underage security officer".  I want to murder him.

\-Zéphyre Opium: The follower of Mathias. A kid that's always munching on some chewing gum to pass the stress and carries a baseball bat with him.

\-Sinclair Fry: A guy that's all about mediation. He tries to ease as much tension as possible all the time. It doesn't work. He mostly plays with his tarot deck when alone.

\-Ange Vatim and Gwenaëlle Larmoyant: I can't really tell them apart if not for their gender. They are book nerds and obnoxious people. Nothing is worth talking to them.

\-Ms.Goldenheart: Our teacher. She seems nice or disinterested. It's hard to tell. We don't have a lot of schoolwork after all.

\-Mr.Pom: The head of security. Tao says he has the "juiciest" info on him, but considering how creepy he can be... Both I mean...

\-Mr.Ensoleillé: The director. He created this hellscape for money and his own enjoyment. I can't believe anything else.

Obviously, there's other people in the facility but this is just our division. I couldn't be bothered to learn their name.

Like it's going to matter when this place...

Well... anyway.

Bye.

I think I'm a mess.

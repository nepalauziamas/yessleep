I wish I could tell you that things have gotten better. I wish I could say that, since the time I last wrote, I’ve managed to escape from all this and only Seth’s house will haunt my mind. The unfortunate truth though, is that I haven’t gotten free since that last post, and it’s apt to say that I might never be.

&#x200B;

We rode, Gil and I, through residential city streets. While we went, the battered black carapace of Gil’s vehicle began to flicker intermittently, as it transitioned between shadows cast by an ever setting sun. The light almost seemed eager to make itself scarce, and I gazed absentmindedly out the window at this point. Getting past the initial shock of my abduction left me weary. I decided to bide my time, in the hopes of an opportunity presenting itself for escape, and pursued a solely cognitive escape in the meantime. Just as I was beginning to drift, Gil broke the silence, bringing me out of my daydreams of freedom, and pulled me back into awareness of my state amongst the leather upholstery.

&#x200B;

“You aren’t going to ask?”

&#x200B;

I hesitated with my response, but ultimately gave him a word. “Ask?”

&#x200B;

“Where we’re going.”

&#x200B;

“I’m not sure that I want to know. If they’re all like Seth, and I really can’t help them like you say, then I’d like to be back on the train. I’m through with lingering here.”

&#x200B;

“Well that’s quite the shift.” Gil wryly exclaimed. “Not too long ago you were begging me to help him, to help you help him, and now you’re ready to leave Seth behind? What kind of a friend are you?”

&#x200B;

“A way better friend than you. I’d still be back there right now if you weren’t holding me prisoner.” My words carried a bite, but traveled in weariness towards him. I’d already spent all my strength at the onset of abduction.

&#x200B;

“I did it for your own good. You might think that you have some power, to go back, to fix Seth, to take him out of that house, but you can’t. All you can possibly do is look back on how you left him and wallow in it for the rest of your life. That’s all you’re good for.”

&#x200B;

“That’s not true. I’ll help him……. I’ll find a way to help him.” I mumbled through my words. The argument made me weary, and though I wanted to believe what I said, I don’t know that I did.

&#x200B;

“You definitely won’t help him, but keep up the fixation. It’ll make for common ground with Les.”

&#x200B;

“Les, We’re going to visit Les next?”

&#x200B;

Gil responded to my question with only a slight nod. We’d been friends for most of our lives, but Les and I really hit it off in college. Somehow, in spite of all the classes and exams, we grew closer through it all. Even when I was forced to brush off Gil during finals, Les was there, Les never left.

&#x200B;

We’d made a new friend in school too. Her name was Kate, and of all the people I met during that time, she lingers in my mind most vividly of all. Sometimes, in my mind's eye, I can still see her. Pale eyes by laugh lines that rested on a round face. She’d often carry a smile that was in response to something she’d said herself. She was clever, and knew it, but didn’t carry herself in a conceited way because of it. Her wit was her shield and she often used it to guard against the caustic comments that inevitably come from putting yourself out there. I often wonder where she is now.

&#x200B;

The car stopped. The sudden cease of motion pulled me from my thoughts and when I looked out the window I knew where we’d gone. It was the parking lot of my old college. There was something timeless about the place. The red stone buildings resting on green grassy grounds didn’t seem to have aged a day in my absence.

&#x200B;

“Les is still here?” I turned to Gil and asked.

&#x200B;

“He hasn’t been here the whole time since you left, but…… he always comes back here in the end.” Gils tone was a matter of fact as he said it.

&#x200B;

“Why? Why would he keep coming back here?” I asked this almost rhetorically, for I was sure I knew the answer.

&#x200B;

“You really have to make me say it?” There was that wryness again. “I think that we both know this is where he peaked.”

&#x200B;

We got out of the car and Gil motioned for us to start walking in the direction of the College Commons. I took a step away, thinking this might be my chance, and got ready to run. Gil saw, and said something to set me dead in my tracks.

&#x200B;

“I’d hate to tell her you left.”

&#x200B;

*No,* I thought. *Please not her too!* It was enough to put me back under his spell. I didn’t want to know, but I had to know.

&#x200B;

“Who?” My words traveled to him in a tremble.

&#x200B;

“Don’t ask a question when you already know the answer.” A confirmation granted without truly being given. Fueled by morbid determinism, I followed after Gil.

&#x200B;

Through the course of our walk we occasionally passed by groups of students, and the odd faculty member, as we went. I longed to cry out, to beg some of them to help me out of my situation, but each time I shot a glance, each time I tried to broach with a word, I was met with total indifference. Gil took notice after the first few attempts, and then went on to deliberately bump into one of them.

&#x200B;

They didn’t notice.

&#x200B;

This person, who’d been the victim of Gil’s sudden impulse, mildly recoiled from the superficial impact and mumbled something to themselves in frustration. What they did not do was ever acknowledge that he had been the source of the impact, or even look in Gil’s direction.

&#x200B;

“Just you and me pal.” The singular display of apathy, coupled with this casual remark from Gil, left me completely deflated.

&#x200B;

We reached the commons building. I, a husk, and Gil walked through the front doors and traversed across glossed stone floors. We weren’t the only ones to make an entry there. Many groups of students entered as well, and the countless feet that carried them created a harmony of rhythmic tapping. Countless conversations flowed there as well, and their multitude of contents blended together to make an almost comforting white noise. It was all such a familiar sensation and so it became like it had in the car then. I’d resigned myself to the whims of Gil, and so I mindlessly followed along behind him, while letting my mind be taken away by the familiar sensations that now surrounded me. If I let my mind wander, and lost touch with the present, I could trick myself into believing that this was just another of those many days I’d spent in class. In spite of their indifference those multitudes could still grant me some reprieve.

&#x200B;

Then the noises stopped, and for a moment, so did I.

&#x200B;

I looked around to get my bearings and It didn’t take me long to realize then that we’d ended up in the college library. It had become empty there, not like I’d remembered it, and though the facilities were still illuminated as though in operating hours, you might easily mistake the place for being closed. We walked then, through rows of bookshelves, past squared tables, and not a single student or faculty member, before we finally reached the only presence in the room.  It was in the furthest corner, there was a table there, with three chairs, and it occupied the space. Large and overwhelming, it had an aura that seemed to grab all of my attention. It was as if the presence were the only thing to be seen. It looked like a person.

&#x200B;

“Les!”

&#x200B;

Gil broke the silence. He seemed eager to begin whatever this situation held in store for us. It was a complete departure from how he’d been with Seth and I was taken with a touch of surprise.

&#x200B;

“Huh.” Les muttered from a large gaping maw. His attention seemed claimed by an object, a shining porcelain figure. From a tapered bottom it rose in two sets of undulating curves before coming to a point at its highest end. It sat in front of him on the table. As Les took note of Gil, only one of his eyes moved to look at him, the other remained on the figure.

&#x200B;

“I brought our little friend here to see you. Don’t you have something that you want to show him?” It was apt to refer to me as small, dwarfed between the two of them, I was like a crumb between rats.

&#x200B;

Les’s eyes lit up upon hearing Gil’s words, though their attentions remained asymmetrical. Filled with a newfound vigor his hulking block-like figure motioned for us to be seated. We did just as he asked.

&#x200B;

“You’re gonna love this.” He said, suddenly animated by excitement.

&#x200B;

“Love what?” I asked, while growing more uneasy with every moment. I was profoundly confused, and even more frustrated. Where was the friend I’d been  willing to wade into fire for?

&#x200B;

“It’s Kate!” He burst out with clumsy excitement and slid the porcelain figure closer to where I now sat.

&#x200B;

I leaned in to get a closer look at Les’s porcelain figure and tried to understand how he could associate it with Kate. The thing was simple, but eye catching. It held only the most fundamental of features of a human figure, of a woman's figure, and yet the more I looked the more I came to understand how he saw it as Kate. It was abhorrent how he’d chosen to represent her. Choosing features that were only superficial, and definitive of the most passing of glances, he’d chosen a representation that was devoid of her voice, of her identity, and it made my insides turn.

&#x200B;

“Is this some kind of joke to you?” I spat out, never taking my eyes off the thing.

&#x200B;

“No no no” Les responded with apparent confusion. “You don’t like it?”

&#x200B;

“It’s insulting to her, Les.” The tone of my retort was sullen. I had felt so ill then, and yet still I looked at it.

&#x200B;

“You just need to get closer. You’ll understand when you’re closer!” Les began to move then.

&#x200B;

The thing I remember most vividly was how fast he moved. You wouldn’t think that someone large enough to occupy your entire field of vision could be that fast, and yet he was. With one hand clasped around the figure he reached for my head. I instinctively tried to fall back, to get away from the table and out of that chair, but when I went to do so I found I’d been firmly embanked against the table. Somehow Gil had gotten behind me while we were talking and taken a handhold on my chair. I couldn’t move! Les got a hold of me then. With one hand behind my head, and the other on the figure’s bottom end, he pushed us closer. As the thing drew closer its narrow head threatened to breach my right eye. It continued its voyage, and at the moment in which it claimed all of my vision it made due on that threat.

&#x200B;

I screamed.

&#x200B;

There was an ache as I awoke. It demanded all my notice, cascading through the corners of my skull, as I awoke in that black carriage which had carried me through to so much carnage. I then panicked. Quivering in the thought of what I might find I reached up towards the eye that Les had marred.

&#x200B;

It was fine.

&#x200B;

I breathed an exasperated sigh of relief. I thought that perhaps it had all been a dream. I longed to believe that I had been asleep in the car since Seth’s house and that Gil had never lured me into that situation with the promise of seeing Kate.

&#x200B;

Kate.

&#x200B;

It was that thought that brought me to the morbid realization. The sudden onset of knowing that I had met with Les in that library, that I had been pinned to the side of the table as he stabbed out my eye. For as I scrolled through my memories, and found myself searching for the visage of Kate, I couldn’t find her. There was only that thing, that figure, that thing. Only through directly viewing pictures am I now able to see her face, and even then it quickly fades in moments. Her memory only carries murmurs, no words, and any of her character has been painted over by that Ivory reduction that now haunts my mind.

&#x200B;

Kate, if you ever read this, I’m sorry for how I’ve come to remember you.

&#x200B;

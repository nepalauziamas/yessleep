The others look from him, to me. And back.

I fumble for words as a cold gust of wind blows into the Outpost.

“You- you’re the replacement for Kristian?” I manage, and the other Adam raises an eyebrow.

“Kristian?” he replies.

“Kristian?” repeats another voice. A grizzled man pokes his head inside from around the corner. It’s Sokolov. Officer Sokolov, the same Russian Officer that led me here… when, exactly? A week ago, maybe? Feels like fucking months.

Everyone inside salutes, myself included, and the man returns it, bidding us to ease with a grunt and a wave.

Elena steps forwards and asks something of the man in Russian.

He replies and gestures from Adam, to me. I hear him mention Kristian’s name, and Elena sadly shakes her head with her response.

Sokolov sighs and looks to the ground. “Shame”, he says in English. “I will miss that one. A big loss”.

“Wait, Sir-” I cut in, stepping forwards down the corridor myself, “you didn’t know that Kristian was dead? Then, what’s Adam doing here?”

“Well, I’m here to replace *you*, man”, Adam says. “Turns out you were never supposed to be up here in the first place. I’m the one they wanted to send”.

“Jesus”, I reply, sucking some air in through my teeth.

“I knew nothing of Kristian til now”, Sokolov says, “I do not deal with this. If replacement requested then he will be here. I do not know where from. One of the others will be bringing them up, when available”. He points at me. “You. Smith. Duty over. Congratulations. Time to go”, and he half-turns, expecting me to follow

The others turn to look at me.

Charlie. April. Yuri. And Elena, all watching.

&#x200B;

…

&#x200B;

…I consider it, you know.

I consider going with Sokolov. I mean, why shouldn’t I?

I’ve done my time. I did my duty. I answered the call, when the call should never even have gone to me in the first place. It was all a fuck-up. A classic, logistical blunder. I mean, I had my suspicions, but I really thought that with something like this, the aboves would have been more careful.

I guess I was wrong.

But still.

I can’t just go. Not now. If I stay…

“…If I stay, Sir, then we have the six. The six required for the optimal running of the Outpost”. I turn to Elena. “That; right, isn’t it? Despite all this space… all these empty rooms… Six is the magic number. That’s what you said. Six defenders”.

Elena opens her mouth, hesitates, then cautiously agrees. She turns to Sokolov. “This is true Sir”, she says, then goes to say some more in Russian, and Sokolov regards her, then me, and then… he just shrugs.

“You want to stay? Stay. You were offered way home. Remember this”. He takes a step back, his coat rustling in the wind. “As I said, if you requested replacement for Kristian then they will be here within day, maybe two, maybe three. Weather depends. Good bye”.

We stand to attention and salute, and he nods one back, then away he goes. Turning on his heels and clattering back through the bones, scarcely giving them a second glance. He does call back over his shoulder though, one more time before he disappears into the haze:

“Shame about tower! Will inform Command. Hopefully fix by end of this quarter”.

And that’s that.

I can just about make out his silhouette, clambering over the little wall that surrounds the Outpost, and then he vanishes, leaving the six of us in the open gate of the Outpost.

&#x200B;

Adam Smith looks between us. Perhaps catching a glimpse of the exhaustion, the ever-flickering, quietly burning fear that now shimmers in all our eyes.

He looks down again to the bones. He swallows.

“So… would anyone care to explain this uh, ‘situation’ to a newbie like myself?” he asks, with a weak, dry laugh.

…No-one laughs with him, and the man is led grimly through the Outpost and into the hexagon.

&#x200B;

\*

&#x200B;

We sit in silence for as a while as Adam eats from a can of Russian meat-mush of some kind.

His chewing, and the occasional hiss of a pipe in the walls are the only sounds. Snow falls slowly and silently beyond the glass.

Adam keeps opening his mouth as if to speak, then deciding against it. Choosing instead to simply shovel in more meat-mush. Unsure if he actually wants any answers, or if he’d prefer to live for a little longer in blissful ignorance. At last he can stand it no longer, and he turns in his seat to face me.

“Adam, what’s going on man? What the hell happens here? Russians and Americans together? What’s the deal with that?”

&#x200B;

*Russians and Americans together.*

&#x200B;

Yes, that too was my first concern when I arrived here. I scarcely even consider this international anomaly at all now. Compared to the surreal, nightmareish nonsense that is thrown at us here on the regular… The fact that we’re working with the army of the Russian Federation barely even registers as a flicker in my thought processes.

“I’m gonna level with you man”, I tell him, breaking the unofficial seal my comrades and I have been keeping. “This place is dangerous. We fight demons here”.

Adam laughs, and as before, no-one joins him. I stare at him, blank-faced.

“You’re- you’re kidding right?” he asks. “Demons? Come on, man…”

“Are you religious, Adam?” I ask him. “I don’t think I’ve ever asked you before”.

“Well, no”, he says in response. “No not really”.

&#x200B;

*“You will be”*, April, Charlie and I all murmur in unison.

&#x200B;

“Demons? Is this a joke?” Adam stands up, angrily. “Stop fucking around! Do you have any idea what I had to go through to get here? Our helicopter nearly crashed in a damned storm!”

Elena herself rises to her feet. The other Adam is a little taller than myself, but she stands higher than even he, and I can feel the second-hand frost of her arctic glare, boring into this newcomer.

“*Amerikanets*”, she mutters, glancing over to Yuri.

…Yuri, however, says nothing. To my great interest, he simply looks down to the floor. I catch a fleeting scowl on Elena’s face. Maybe even a touch of… concern, perhaps…? But she lets it go.

&#x200B;

Adam takes a step back, awkwardly, and then strides over to me. He gets right up in my face, though I don’t flinch. “Adam!” he says, desperately. “Come on, what the hell is this? Demons? We’re not fighting demons, that’s a fucking joke. What are we DOING here?”

I pause.

“You know what. Maybe you’re right, Adam. Maybe we aren’t fighting *demons* at all. Perhaps you should be addressing your questions to Elena here instead”.

I look over to her, my gaze heavy, and I know that she can feel its weight.

&#x200B;

The snow falls, and the tension in the room tightens somewhat.

April stares at me. I can see her in the corner of my eye. Her lips remain sealed, but the meaning behind her paranoid expression is clear.

*Adam*, it says. *Are you sure about this? If we confront her directly , there might be no going back. We don’t know what she’s capable of.*

The blood in my body begins to chill considerably as Elena’s eyes bore back into mine.

Her mouth twitches, and it pulls that scar grotesquely across her cheek.

I stand up.

“Elena. It’s time to share with us what you’ve been hiding. I simply don’t know what we’re fighting, any more. I’m realizing that I never really did. Please, just tell us the truth. What are we fighting? Why have you dedicated yourself so wholeheartedly to this Outpost? Why six? Why six people only?”

“…And who *are* you?” April asks, in a quiet, almost imperceptible voice.

“I do not know what you are talking about”, Elena replies levelly. All eyes fixed on the woman as the wind blows with a sudden, renewed force beyond the walls. The snow is whipped into a frenzy.

&#x200B;

“We don’t have long to go til nightfall now, chaps”, Charlie mutters. He remains seated at the back of the room, but as with us all, his eyes are on Elena. “Elena, come on. You know something. It’s obvious. Just share with the group, and we can all move on”.

“…I don’t have time for this”, Elena mutters, and she turns to take her leave.

&#x200B;

…She finds herself blocked, however.

&#x200B;

Yuri, having risen from his seat, has stepped in her way. Blocking her path from the room.

“This is ridiculous”, she says, then points at Yuri and barks something in Russian.

Yuri shakes his head, his hands by his sides.

Elena scoffs and tries to go for another exit, and this time she is blocked by Charlie, likewise rising up from his seat to stand in her way.

“You people are CRAZY! We DEFEND OUTPOST! THAT IS OUR JOB!”

With a sudden, and surprising sob of anguish, Elena reaches down to her belt. To her gun, perhaps? Maybe not. But every single person in the room catches the motion, and before Elena’s hand reaches her waist, four weapons are drawn, cocked, and aimed directly at her.

&#x200B;

“Woah... Jesus… what the-” Adam begins, but his surprise is lost beneath the shouting.

&#x200B;

Elena’s face crackles with fury. It’s an almost palpable electricity, a current running between the six of us.

“Yuri!” she shouts into the man’s face, her forehead thudding against the butt of the rifle. “Let me pass! How could you do this to your own comrade?” Her words blur into Russian, rife with expletives.

Sweat buds on my forehead and leaks in little trickles down my neck. Elena swivels to face me and the sweat freezes against my skin. “Elena… stand down…” I mutter. “I’m sorry, I don’t want to shoot you, obviously-”

Elena strides towards me and I raise the gun higher, stumbling in retreat, shouting now: “ELENA, STOP. STOP NOW OR I WILL SHOOT”.

She hesitates. Bares her teeth at me.

“I do not know the answers. I know nothing. I guard Outpost. Like you all”.

Yuri tuts and shakes his head.

*“Bol'shiye sis'ki no malen'kiy mozg”*, he grunts under his breath.

Elena responds to this with a sharp 180; pulling back her fist, and smashing it into Yuri’s nose.

Blood splatters against the wall and Yuri scrambles backwards, shaking his rifle in Elena’s face and shouting at her in loud, very angry Russian. We’re all shouting again now, but Elena pays it no mind.

“You will not shoot me! All too soft! Need me to stay alive, regardless! KILL ME, AND ALL DIE!”

“WHY?” I ask her, pleading in my voice. “WHY Elena? Why do we need you to stay alive? What *are* you to this place?”

I lower my weapon with a sigh and slump back into my chair, running a hand through my hair, the tension trickling away. It’s pointless. Elena’s right. We’re not going to shoot her, and we all know it. “We’re putting our lives on the line. We came close to a total loss last night. The demons almost got what they wanted. Perhaps some of them *did*”. I turn to her. “But we don’t KNOW what they want. How can we effectively defend when we don’t know even this simple fact? It might be easier tonight with Adam, here… But… But WHY? Why is six better than five? Is it better than seven?”

Elena clenches her jaw, regards me.

…

“Come on, Elena… *Pozhaluysta*”.

*Please.*

&#x200B;

…

&#x200B;

The gears turn in Elena’s head as she rubs the bruise forming across her knuckles, then she too simply slumps down into a chair with a sigh, one directly opposite me.

Charlie and April cautiously lower their weapons, though Yuri does not.

Elena glances over to him, and shouts. Yuri mutters something to himself and reluctantly does as she says, lowering his weapon. He keeps it in his hands, however, and chooses to take a seat at a far distance.

“There are six needed to guard Outpost”, Elena begins wearily, her voice passionless. She sounds tired. So, so tired. “No more than six. Too many people here is like pouring blood into the sea. All those heartbeats. All those thoughts, feelings, fears… The Enemy comes like sharks”.

“They came like sharks last night”, Charlie says from his position. “And there were only five of us. So what happened? What changed?”

“They got themselves a taste of what it is they are after. Driven to bloodlust, I guess. They share a consciousness. You all saw it previous night. The shadow in mountains. The giant. The spirit of the… of the Enemy”. Elena wavers, then continues. “We suffered so greatly last night because we were without Kristian. Kristian specifically”.

“I don’t understand”, I murmur. “Why Kristian specifically? We’ll be okay tonight, right? We have the six. We have the new Adam”.

“Adam Smith”, Elena says, looking up at last to our newest member. “How was your childhood?”

He regards her. “I’m sorry?”

“Your childhood. Good or bad? Simple question”.

“Well, good, I guess. Pretty damned good. My parents were-”

“Yeah”, she says with a dismissive wave. “Didn’t ask for your life story”. She sighs. “Tonight will be hard. Kristian was good defender because he understood the truth of suffering. He and I were… we were good friends, I like to hope”.

Something shimmers in Elena’s eyes and she wipes them with the back of her bruised hand, half-turning away.

“My childhood was not good. It was bad. Very, very bad. I understand what it means to suffer when suffering was not deserved. More than most. Kristian understood this too. We were shields, he and I. Shields against the Enemy. The greater your understanding of suffering, the greater the strength of the Outpost. The greater the resistance to the demons”.

She looks around the room. “Yuri, I know childhood was not great. But was fine. And you. Westerners”. She looks from Charlie to April, to Adam, and to myself. “You do not know suffering in its purest form. Your use here is limited”.

I try to process this.

“But… I thought we had spiritual resistance, or whatever? The ley-lines…”

“The ley-lines are real. The supernatural resistance, real. That is why you are here. But even despite this, your use is limited”.

“So why don’t Command just send soldiers with shit childhoods, then?” April asks. “Why don’t our governments just send people with awful upbringing?”

“BECAUSE-” Elena cuts in, angrily. “They do not KNOW. NO-ONE KNOWS. Except *I* know. Kristian knew. And now all of you know too. And you must keep it a secret. You must. If I believe you intend to share this secret with anyone, I will kill you. I am not joking”. She looks between us, one by one.

“Why?” I ask. “Why is this secret so important to keep?”

“*Tupitsa”*, Elena sighs, shaking her head. “Think about it. Governments want to defend Outpost. What do you think Governments do if they know they can defend it more securely with soldiers who have suffered as children?”

I open my mouth, but say nothing.

Elena continues. “Government will *create* these soldiers. They already send soldiers from the ley-lines. If they know they will be better soldiers for having suffered, they will take them, and they will MAKE them suffer. And I will not allow this. Never. Never ever. No-one will suffer like I did. No-one will go through what I had to go through”.

“They wouldn’t…” April murmurs. “No government would do such a thing. I mean, the Russians might, but… but the American Government? No, they’d never do anything so cruel”.

&#x200B;

…

&#x200B;

Her words hang dead in the air.

&#x200B;

“…Wouldn’t they?” Elena mutters quietly, and darkly we consider this.

&#x200B;

“Alright…” I say slowly. “So… so *that* I suppose I can understand… but… the Enemy? They’re not demons, are they? They can’t be. There’s just no way. The more I think about it… We’re not battling the forces of Hell here, are we? But they RESPOND to the religious stuff! To the Christianity! Why? Why is that?”

*“Drevlian…”* Yuri grunts, scratching the stubble across his chin. “We fight Drevlian”.

&#x200B;

*The word on the wall of the cavern…*

*…This is what Yuri was researching in the archives…*

*What’s he talking about?*

&#x200B;

It’s an accusation. He waits for Elena to confirm his words, and at last, she does. She turns to look out of the window and she nods.

“Yes. The Drevlian. That’s what we are fighting. Not demons, but people. A race of people called the Drevlian. They were all destroyed, a thousand years ago. A name lost in time. They became slowly the ‘Drevils’… The ‘Devils’... And then, simply, ‘Demons’”.

“The Drevlian”, Charlie repeats. “Never head of them. And who the fuck might they be? And why do they want access to this building so bloody badly?”

Elena closes her eyes. She takes a slow, deep breath. And she tells us the story.

She tells us the story of the Drevlian, and of Olga of Kiev. The woman in the painting.

&#x200B;

\*

&#x200B;

The Drevlian were, so she says, an ancient race of people who lived in what is now western Russia, over a thousand years ago. Vaguely Slavic in ethnicity, with their own customs, stories, aspirations and anthems. Elena believes the song we hear across the mountains at night to be the song of the Drevlian people.

A man named Oleg of the Rus’ led the dominant nation in the region at the time, and the Drevlians, - amongst the other tribes and peoples of Eastern Europe, - were expected to pay tribute and swear to him their loyalty. An oath of service, in exchange for Oleg’s defenses.

Upon Oleg’s death, however, the Drevlian lords changed their minds. At a midnight council in the midst of a snowstorm, it was decided that they would abandon the other peoples and choose to immediately halt their tribute, and all promise of fealty.

Oleg’s successor was a man named Igor. Igor of Kiev. A man who made many mistakes, a man misguided… But a good man all the same. A man who did his best by his people.

Igor, unsure how to approach the Drevlians, initially sent an armed force up to their capital to demand what he was owed, and was met with indignation and verbal hostility, and he returned with a meagre tribute, far less than what was promised. Than what was *owed.*

Not wanting to escalate matters any further, Igor for his second attempt travelled north to the wintry home of the Drevlians himself, to speak to their leaders personally and to fix what he hoped was little more than a frayed thread of diplomacy.

Elena pauses for a moment as she reaches this part. She swallows and rubs her throat.

…And she tells us that the Drevlians saw the situation a little differently. They murdered Igor of Kiev, by tying his legs to two birch trees, the trunks bent and trembling and held in place with ropes and nets. Once Igor had been secured and the Drevlian lords had boasted the breaking of their oath, the nets and the ropes were released. The trees in all their might and power sprang back to their original, *opposite* positions, and Igor was promptly torn in two.

&#x200B;

…There are, apparently, accounts from those present that say they saw his bones burst right out from his body, though of course, there is no way to verify now if such was true.

&#x200B;

Igor’s death was felt across the region, but by no-one greater than his loving wife, *Olga.* Olga of Kiev. Olga of the Rus’. The woman depicted in the tower’s painting.

Whilst the Drevlians celebrated their freedom, Olga’s soul was twisted and burned into a driving force for vengeance. For revenge. For *justice.*

&#x200B;

The Drevlians, emboldened by their newfound freedom, gloated to Olga… and as the first female ruler of the Rus’ she was perceived as little more than a pliable weakling.

…The Drevlians were wrong.

They did not see.

They did not see the arctic fire that burned behind her eyes. They did not see the frost that formed with her every waking breath.

They did not see when the first train of their boastful ambassadors were buried alive. Scrabbling and scratching and screaming in the perpetual darkness.

They did not see when the second were tricked and trapped in a locked and burning building. Reduced to little more than charred and blackened bones.

And they did not see when Olga, acting the meek and weakened woman, requested an overdue funeral for her husband Igor, at the site of his death. Her request was granted, and as she wept for what was lost in the Drevlian capital, the Drevlians drank. Drunkenly, they plotted their plans for the future. They wagered on who would be the one to marry Olga of Kiev.

…And as the night progressed, they were slaughtered in their thousands. Olga’s Rus’ killed each and every noble, guard and soldier present, and the city was set ablaze.

&#x200B;

It was only then that the Drevlians began to see.

&#x200B;

Rus’ reinforcements from the south pushed north, and one by one the cities of the Drevlian were razed.

Every plea, every desperate request for peace and for surrender were met was little more than wind. Olga never ceased. She never stopped. Onwards, she marched with her soldiers. Driving the Drevlian ever back.

On one late day of this slaughter, Olga halted, and commanded her forces to wait. A message was sent out. The hearts of the embattled people leapt when at last, at long, long last, it seemed that Olga of Kiev would finally show them mercy. After all, their lords and nobles were all now dead… Buried or burned or slashed to pieces, and the last of the Drevlian people were besieged in the final city still standing. Their lone bastion.

&#x200B;

Olga, promising peace, demanded only one final tribute.

…Six birds.

…Just six.

Six birds from each household, as a promise of freedom and the war’s end.

The Drevlians were relieved and they gladly accepted, and the tribute of the great flock was swiftly made and delivered to Olga herself.

&#x200B;

…Olga had no intention of forgiving the Drevlian, however. As she stood amongst this host of birds, she commanded her solders to attach to each and every one a string of sulphur and rags of cloth.

Then when the sun set that day, the sulphur was set alight, and the birds were released.

The orange of the glow was said to shine in Olga’s eyes as the sky began to sparkle with a hundred thousand embers.

The birds did as Olga knew they would. They returned to their homes, to their nests, in the rafters and rooves of the houses and buildings of the Drevlians… and all at once the wood began to burst into flame. The city was a burning wreck within the hour, and there was nothing its inhabitants could do but run. To flee to the east.

&#x200B;

They were chased by Olga’s soldiers. For hundreds of miles, east, across the wastes.

And there, at the base of the Ural mountains when they could go no further, they banded together, the Drevlians, for one desperate final stand. They were the men still standing, they were women, they were children, they were elderly… They were not warriors or fighters. But they still numbered over a hundred-thousand. And in those final hours they all felt the end, and they all prepared to fight as only one backed into a corner truly can. They still had their hope.

&#x200B;

…Olga, however, did not *plan* to *fight.*

&#x200B;

She would not accept a single further drop of Rus’ blood being spilled for these *demons*, and so as the Drevlians were steadily encircled, it came to pass that she burst from the shadows behind them atop a rocky hill, her cross in hand and shining in the reflection of the fire her soldiers blazed in the darkness.

Her robes whipped about her body in the growing windstorm, and she stood defiant as she began to chant. As she raised that cross up high, and in the name of her God, she swore to tear the Drevlian souls right out from their bodies. To tear them to pieces, as they had torn apart her beloved. She roared with a power the Drevlians had not yet seen. Christianity was unknown to these people. They did not know the Cross. They were afraid of the strength of her conviction in this foreign, Abrahamic mysticism, and that in turn gave it a power unique to that moment of madness.

Whether God Himself was involved is not certain. Nor is the certainty of His existence. But on the Drevlian’s final day, it was *Olga’s* power, channelled through her cross, that led to the end of their story once and for all. Their souls were ripped from their bodies and cast out into the wastes as shadows. There would be no peace for the Drevlians. No eternal rest or slumber.

…Only suffering.

Endless, maddening suffering.

&#x200B;

The only material substance that was left of the Drevlian people were soulless bodies of a rock-like, chalky crust, and these husks were carried one by one way up through the cracks of the mountains, where they were sealed away in a dark, deep, near-unreachable cavern.

Olga made sure to carve into the cavern’s walls the nature of their crimes, with a warning that they would remain here for eternity with no rest, and no respite.

&#x200B;

\*

&#x200B;

…And there the story ends.

The scattered, twisted souls of the Drevlian eventually found their cavern, but the descendants of the Rus’ manned an eternal guard, the reason as to *why* gradually lost through the centuries.

An eternal guard, that had largely held off the attacks on the Outpost…

…Until now, that is

Until *me*, with a mistake as *idiotic* as a mix-up with *names.*

&#x200B;

Elena trails off, and we all stare off into space, taking in the gravity of this outrageous knowledge.

“…But… but what about the other Outposts?” I murmur, “Kristian said there was one in Australia… India… He said-”

“I know what he said”, Elena interrupts. “He said those things because that’s what I told him. I *lied.* There are no *other* outposts. There is this, and only this”.

*…There are no other outposts.*

&#x200B;

*So it’s just this one, then. Just us six, alone in the mountains.*

&#x200B;

“Adam and I were born in the same place”, I say out loud, giving voice to another thought that’s been nagging at me. “We were both born on the same ley line. Our supernatural resistance should be the same, no? So why has shit the fan only recently?”

Elena snorts. “I told you this at the beginning. You are not like the others. You are childish and immature. You simply have a dangerous personality. You are type to bring chaos and calamity wherever you go. You have not suffered, Adam, and are still too soft for this Outpost”.

*“On ne tak uzh plokh”,* Yuri mutters under his breath. Elena shoots him a look.

&#x200B;

… I think in that moment about my brother. About his death, ten years ago. I push aside the false voice that the demon… the *Drevlian…* eased into my head, and I remember my brother’s *true* voice. His presence. His *warmth….*

“…I’ve done my share of suffering, Elena”, I say quietly. “But thanks”.

Still. Maybe things *would* have been different if the correct Adam had been sent in my place. Maybe Kristian would still be alive. Maybe the tower would be undamaged. Maybe the cavern beneath us would still be sealed away.

…I guess we’ll never know, now.

&#x200B;

“So… so why the hell are we doing this?” April asks, pressing her palms against her eyes for a moment. “We’re stopping the Drevlian souls from reaching their bodies. I get that. But I still don’t understand WHY. Why don’t we just let them return? Let this whole thing end, be done with it once and for all? Then no-one will need to stay in the Outpost. It can be decommissioned”.

“For one simple reason”, Elena replies. “If a Drevlian soul returns to the body from which they were separated, they are flooded in an instant with a thousand years of hatred. Of bitter rage. Anguish. A being is not meant to exist for so long. Returned to material world they find themselves displaced. Out of sync. They are dangerous and violent and brimming with latent spiritual power. If Drevlians successfully enter the Outpost, breach cavern, and find bodies… That is over one-hundred thousand angry, mind-broken monsters released into world. Bloodshed will return. Cycle of hatred will continue”.

She rises to a stand, and I get the sense her speech is drawing to a close. It’s getting darker, anyway. Not much time left now. Night will be falling soon, and the new Adam still doesn’t really have a clue what’s going to happen.

“I stay here in this Outpost because my presence here is greatest shield Outpost could ever ask for. And second, to right the sins of the past. Olga’s fury, back then, caused terrible pain and trauma to this part of world. The story of the Drevlians is brutal, *sad*, complex… But if those souls return to the bodies, the terror unleashed on further innocents will be *zhelezo*…. iron in its brutality”.

&#x200B;

“But… but that’s not RIGHT…” April replies, standing up herself. “These people... The Drevlians… These are INNOCENTS that were… they were torn from their bodies, that’s what you said! Souls left suffering for a thousand years! It’s not RIGHT- Who are we to stand in the way of allowing them to return to their bodies? For a final chance of peace?”

“And there”, Elena says, raising her hand in a half-point, “is why I keep secret. Easier to battle demon, than Drevlian. Less moral-compass dilemma”.

&#x200B;

“Fucking hell…” Charlie says with a sigh. “This is some heavy, heavy shit. Jesus”.

&#x200B;

Something inside April snaps. She strides forwards and shouts directly into Elena’s face.

“ARE YOU *HER*, ELENA?” she says. “ARE YOU OLGA OF KIEV?”

&#x200B;

My first instinct is to snort with surprise. The question is ridiculous.

…But…

…But as the question settles into my mind…

I take another look at Elena.

I conjure up an image of the painting and I try to place them side by side.

&#x200B;

No… Surely not… Surely not…

&#x200B;

“You know everything about her”, April says, and I notice that she is trembling. “You look like the woman in the painting, though, she doesn’t have that scar… And- and you’ve been here for a long time, haven’t you, Elena. A long, long time. Decades, at the least. You’re Olga, and you’re trapped here now. Trapped in this Outpost in a web of your own making”.

Elena stares at April, and then… she laughs.

The sound is bright and clear, and we watch in shock and cautious amusement as she laughs and laughs and laughs, doubling over a little as she does so.

“You are kidding?” she says, her face displaying a grin I’ve never seen her wear before. “Joke? You think I am woman who died thousand years ago?”

April falters and takes a step back; she flushes. “But- well, I thought-”

“Americans are so funny. This is crazy”, Elena snorts and wipes the corner of her eye. “I am not Olga, April”.

April clenches her fists. She strides from the hexagon and into the little side-room she showed me several days ago. I hear her rummaging and the clatter of a something being knocked from the wall, and she returns a moment later with a framed photograph in her hand. I recognize it, as the one with ‘SGH 1987’ written on the back. I’d almost forgotten about it. She flips it, undoes the clips, and slides the picture out from the frame. She holds it up to Elena’s face.

“Explain this, then! You see what’s been written on the back of this picture? ‘SGH 1987’. WHO is ‘SGH’, and HOW is there a picture of you at this Outpost from 1987? You scarcely look any different at all! How is that possible?”

Elena’s grin fades from her face and she shakes her head with a sigh, her eyebrows furrowed. “This is sad, April. You are smarter than this”. She takes the photograph and points to the letters and numbers written there. “What does this say, April?”

“SGH”, April replies. “1987”.

Elena shakes her head. “No. Wrong. It says SGH, *i987.* This photo is not from decades ago. It was taken in 2015”.

April’s confidence trickles away. “What? But…”

“You know *Samsung Galaxy*, April? Samsung Galaxy tablets?”

“I… yeah, I guess…”

Elena thrusts the picture back into April’s hands. “This photo was taken with Samsung Galaxy. Samsung Galaxy *SGH i987.* This is brand of device. Not date or initials”.

April’s face burns bright red, and she chews her lip in thought.

&#x200B;

I too consider this development. The brand of the phone that took the picture? Is that all it was..? It seems almost… almost too *stupid* to be true.

But then again, what the hell do I know. Nothing, apparently. Not a damned thing.

&#x200B;

And regardless, thinking time is up, it would seem. The shadows deepen, and before long the sun will set. It’s time to get to our stations.

“What are we going to do about the tower?” I ask. “It’s weaponless, and we’ve broken the rule. No-one’s been in the thing for hours”.

“We have no choice but to abandon it”, Elena replies. “We will have to survive the night without it. Everyone to your stations. Adam Smith, you go with old Adam Smith. Defend the Outpost. Rule Number One. Do not allow Enemy into Outpost”.

&#x200B;

*Do not allow the Enemy into the Outpost.*

&#x200B;

And away she goes.

No-one tries to block her, this time. Still reeling from the info drops, heavy with the weight of our newfound knowledge, one by one we depart for our stations. April drops a small, shining silver cross into Adam’s hands before she goes. Charlie gives the man a nod and wishes him well. Yuri says nothing to anyone, vanishing silently down a corridor, bringing a cigarette up to his mouth before he disappears completely round a corner.

“Come on man”, I say to Adam. “I guess you’re with me tonight”. And so away we go, up and into the snow, to our station.

&#x200B;

Doing our duty.

&#x200B;

Manning the amalgamated weapons to keep away the intruders. The fire in the darkness. Keeping the Drevlians trapped in their eternal cycle of darkness, despair and destruction.

&#x200B;

Armed with Bibles, using these holy books as *weapons*… as Olga of Kiev did herself one thousand years ago.

&#x200B;

Defending the Outpost, as we are all tasked with doing. As Americans. As Russians. As soldiers.

&#x200B;

The sun sets.

&#x200B;

The anthem of the Drevlians begins to play; quietly at first, floating note by note across the mountains… as thoughts within thoughts swirl as a maelstrom across the turmoil of my mind.

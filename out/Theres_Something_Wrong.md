Hey Reddit, I'm making this post in hopes that I hear something from anyone. There's something wrong. Like I'm talking about it's been a full day without sunlight, my town is empty and the things in the streets have been screaming louder. I'm sorry, with no context that just sounds crazy. I think I may be getting ahead of myself, let me explain.

 I noticed something was wrong the moment after I struggled to grab my phone to silence the deafening screams of my alarm. The time on my phone said 6:30 but considering it was still pitch black outside and there was no sounds coming from the usual birds, traffic ect. there was no possible way it was 6:30 in the morning. It's early August, around here the day is usually started around 5. Knowing I had to be at work in the next 15 minutes I scrambled to get ready got dressed, grabbed my lunch and filled the dogs food bowl. Surprised I wasn't being pushed out of the way so somebody could eat I left the house and hopped in my car at 6:55. Pulling into the shop, the first thing I noticed was the fact there wasn't a single vehicle on the site. I drove around the back of the property and over by the small office behind the building. Still not a single person in sight. I summed it up to missing a meeting or not knowing it was a holiday and went on my way. 

 On the way home I decided to stop at the local grocery store, being a small rural town in the interior of British Columbia there had to be at least someone there to have a chat with about the darkness that still hasn't lifted off of the town at now 7:30 in the morning. Making a right hand turn into the parking lot I pull the car up to a parking spot and turn the engine off. With a Slam of my door I headed for the entrance and grabbed the handle. Locked. "Maybe I have to push" I thought to myself before pushing the handle in. Locked. Starting to get frustrated I came to the conclusion that I was just going to have to go home and waste the day playing video games. 

 As I turned around to head back to the car something caused me to stop dead in my tracks. Standing on the drivers side door was a women with her head down whimpering to herself. Calmly I asked "excuse me ma'am do you need help with something?" My voice must have scared her making her jump as if I had shouted in her ear. "Hey I don't mean to be rude but you're gonna have to move, if you need some help I can call an ambulance." I said with a stern but non threatening tone. The women started to lift her head revealing what I wish I could erase from my memory. The women looked like she had been crying for days, her eyes sunken in and leaking a dark thick substance. Her mouth curled into a hideous mournful scowl leaking that horrid slime.

 I began to step back quickly causing myself to fall backwards, scrambling away as she continued to step forwards. But I couldn't get away as fast as I would have preferred in that moment. The women then lunged on top of me while emitting a blood curdling wail, it sounded like the cry of a mother who just lost their child mixed with that of a beast. Something dark and primordial emanated from within her. I shoved my arm under her chin and shoved back, Her jaws snapping at me, hearing her sharp jagged teeth slam together inches from my face. I began by gabbing her by the shoulder  then throwing her off balance. I then shoved her off of me and ran for the car, throwing my door open I forced my way in and started her up. As I put it into drive and was speeding out of the parking lot, the broken crying women began to rise and limp towards the vehicle determined to make me her meal for the day. I sighed and relaxed into the seat, glad that whatever the fuck that was, was over. With the parking lot in my rearview and the women's shrieking getting more faint, I saw them. A handful of silhouettes crouched over a large mass, eating it... No, I didn't stop to check. My mother always taught me that sometimes ignorance is bliss. 

 I managed to get back to my street, I live in a quiet neighborhood so most of the time it was completely dead, I didn't see anyone for the last little bit so I think I should be safe. My phone's at 43% and the clock reads 10:07am. The weirdest part in all of this is I still can't find my dog. The only room I have yet to check is the basement but I can't tell if the whining and slow scratches on the door are from him or a visitor I shouldn't be letting in. My wife and kids are with her family a few towns away, I still haven't heard from her and she's not answering my calls. I've tried calling everyone but it just goes right to voicemail, I have full bars and my data is working fine. I've tried messaging people and even trying out the god forsaken oldie Omegle but nobody responds. 

 That brings us to now. It's currently 11:09pm I can hear shuffling and crying coming from outside of the house and now, I'm writing this to you, yet I don't even know if anyone will even see this. Please,  I pray that one of you is able to tell me what is going on. Is everything fine for you? Do you think it's safe to check the basement? What are those things? what ways should I try making contact with people? I need to try to get some sleep now, those.. things are starting to scream louder with every hour.

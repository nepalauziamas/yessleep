It was 1:13 pm and I was reading my new murder mystery book, I then got a text from my friend saying he found something awesome. I asked what it was and he told me it was an abandoned restaurant, seriously a abandoned restaurant I thought that was pretty dumb.

I asked why he was texting me and he said that he wanted me to come with him to spend the night there with him and who ever loses has to pay the winner $300. I thought it was dumb but then thought if I won I would get $300, I told him I was in and he told me to meet up with him by 8:00 pm.

I then went back to reading my book thinking what I would do with $300, that night I was getting ready to go grabbing my phone and some food and a blanket and pillow and put it in my bag. I then got in my car and left, I stopped for gas and started thinking maybe this was a dumb idea but then remembered I couldn't pass up on the money.

So I paid for the gas and left and in the car my brain kept telling me to turn back but I decided to keep going. I looked at my GPS making sure I was still going the right way, I eventually got there and when I looked out the place was really dark and looked run down. I got out and grabbed my stuff but didn't see my friend, I looked down at my phone and saw it was 8:12 and he told me to meet him at 8:00 but he wasn't here.

I called him but he didn't answer I was pretty confused was he gonna prank me or something. I thought I should leave but decided he chickened and if I stayed the night he had to pay me, I opened the door seeing was unlocked made me think Paul was already here. 

I pulled my phone out and turned on the flashlight to see, I saw a few cobwebs and dust everywhere from being left untouched for how long. I dusted off a chair and table and sat down and pulled out a soda from my bag to drink and decided to text my friend saying I was here. I then something fall in the background I was startled by it and decided to check it out having my light on to see.

I was in the back and saw a frying pan laying on the ground I picked it and put it back, I heard something move around I spun around it came from behind the pans. I slowly walked over with my light on the pile of pans I slowly moved them and a rat came running out. I dropped to the ground terrified, Phone flying out of my hand, I picked myself up and grabbed my phone, seeing it was just a rat calmed me down.

I went back out and sat down and checked my phone and Paul didn't reply back to me, I called him trying to get ahold of him one last time and then heard ringing and that's when I realized the ringing was coming from inside the restaurant. I dropped my phone in shock if  it's coming from in here that means Paul is here so he was pranking me.

I decided to follow the ringing tripping over stuff along the way with how dark it was and the light didn't help. I kept going until the ringing got closer and closer and I then noticed it laying on the floor ringing, I was confused if his phone was here where was he like who would leave there phone laying on the ground.

I then heard Paul's voice coming from behind the door "Carson is that you?" I was happy seeing he was here and was going to reply but I don't know why but the voice in the back of my head told me not too. I just slowly backed away while I heard Paul's voice keep calling out for me and he was getting angry every time I didn't reply. 

I then saw the door handle turn and quickly hid and with it being dark it helped me out as I saw the door open really slow, what I saw scares me, It was a bony creature all gray it looked like a mix of a human and dog and it had no nose. It was pretty tall and moved on all fours it picked up the phone and smelled it,I just kept quiet and made sure it didn't notice me.

It went back in the room and when I thought it was over and I could leave I was about to get up, but it then came back with something and  I then realized that it was Paul. That thing then started eating him, tearing into his skin and hearing the think crunching on his bones, I wanted to puke but I knew I needed to find a way out of there.

The creature looked back and started to talk "Carson you here?" ,It sounded like Paul it then crawled back into the room and closed the door. Now was my chance to escape I got up and bolted out of there, I was so close but then tripped over a chair leg I hot the floor with a loud bang, I froze and heard the door slam open and a loud scream "CARSON!" I got up continued running I got the door and got out slamming it behind me and proceeded to get in my car and drive off.

I never told anyone what happened that day and the police still haven't found Paul but I know they never will, I was going for a walk one day and got a call on my phone from Paul. I froze I answered and slowly put too my ear and said "Hello" I wanted to scream when I heard a raspy voice say "Carson!".

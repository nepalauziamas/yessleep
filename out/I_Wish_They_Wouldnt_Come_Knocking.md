The following has been transcribed from a note found in an abandoned residence.

….

I wish they wouldn't come knocking,
late at night when I'm sleeping. 
For when I wake in a terrified state 
I can hear them, knock, knock, knocking


I wrote that when I was… 10? Or maybe 11? Whatever age you are in grade 5. We had just finished our poetry unit in English class, and all had to write something. Most of my classmates wrote some cheesy bullshit about their parents or family; a couple even wrote about their playground crushes. Me? Well, I wrote about my personal torment. What kind of torment can a 10-year-old have? Why ghosts of the dead keeping you up at night, of course! 


Okay, okay. So I've gotta go back, like way back to when we first moved into our house.

My parents worked their asses off so they could finally buy our little family of four a home to call our own. No more paying rent to some lazy asshole who couldn’t be bothered to fix a fucking hole in our roof; I swear that guy would watch my mom through the window sometimes and... Sorry, I’m getting off-topic. The point is, we were all really excited to have a place to call our own. 


The pride my father had as he took us by the hand and led us through each room, he was simply gleaming. It was a raised bungalow with two bedrooms upstairs and an unfinished basement. If I’m being honest, as happy as I was to finally have our own space, I remember being a little upset with dear old Dad. You see, once we got to the house, he informed me that I would need to share a bedroom with my little sister until my room was finished. 




“Share a room with her?! No way!” I yelled at my father from across the room. “She will get into all my stuff and want me to play dolls with her. You said before I’d get my own room! This isn’t fair!” I spat as I stomped my way outside to sit in the car. Geez, looking back on this moment, I was such a fucking brat.


My parents left me alone in the car for a few minutes before my father came strolling out with his hands in his pockets while he looked down at the ground. I can’t imagine what must have been going through his mind after what I said; the personal triumph he felt must have been stripped away with my little outburst. He never showed it, though; my father was the most patient and kind-hearted man I ever knew. 


He opened the car door and knelt down to be at eye level with me as he spoke in a soft voice, “I promised you your room, and you’ll have it as soon as possible. There's a lot of work that needs to be done in the basement, but once I do that, you’ll have your own room and a rec room as well.” 


I quietly sighed to myself; I think even back then, I knew what a little brat I had just been. I turned and looked at my Father. “Yeah, that sounds really cool, Dad. Thank you, I’m sorry.” as I finished the half-assed apology, my Dad immediately picked me up out of the car, threw me over his shoulder, and carried me inside. At the same time, I laughed and screamed for him to let me go. 


We had pizza for dinner, spent the night playing games, and the following day Mom made pancakes! After that, we got to work unpacking; my dad finished the basement; I grew up in that house until I was eighteen, went to college, and got a great job. We all lived happily ever after the end! 


Aw, what a nice thought. Does it make for a better story? And they all lived…happily ever after. 


What? Can’t a guy live in fantasy while telling his life story? Ugh, fine. You’re no fun. 



It was a few weeks until my Dad had finished up my room in the basement; I can’t stress enough how excited I was to finally have my own space! My sister was a sweet girl, but a man just needs to be on his own sometimes, ya know? The day my Dad came to start moving my stuff downstairs was one of the best days ever! When I walked into the room, I was shocked at how awesome everything looked; he had painted the room just how I wanted it! The only thing left unfinished was the wall at the back of the room; it was an outside wall and was actually part of the house's foundation, so it was just concrete. It looked kind of cool unfinished like that, very modern.


I was so excited to run around my room, set my things up how I wanted them, and not worry about playing “tea time” anymore! We set my bed up in the corner of my room with the concrete wall at the head of my bed. 


“There's nothing but dirt on the outside side of this wall, buddy, so it might get a little cold at night.” my Dad said as he laid his hand flat on the wall. 



Of course, the first night in my new room was a little scary, seeing as I had never slept in a room alone before. My Mom came down to tuck me in, and I asked her to leave the light on; she told me that my Dad had installed a timer on it, so she set it for an hour and left me to sleep. I fell asleep after tossing and turning for a few minutes. After that first night, I slept great in my new room and would get up a little early to play every morning before my Mom called me upstairs for breakfast! 


The second week that I was living in that room, I decided to stay up late to finish playing a game I had borrowed from a friend. There is nothing like playing a game in a dark room with nothing but the screen's light, am I right? I struggled to keep my eyes open, so I turned off the game and got in bed. I was just about asleep when I heard a weird noise… 


Knock, knock, knock. 


The noise was quiet but deliberate. I looked around the room for a second before thinking it was just the pipes; my Dad had warned me I might hear some strange noises like that. My eyes grew heavy again, and just before I fell asleep, I heard the noise again… 

Knock, knock, knock. 


There was no mistaking it; there was a knocking sound coming from somewhere in my room. I jumped up, ran over to my light, and turned it on, only to find my room was empty and quiet. The knocking sound repeated several more times before I realized where it was coming from. The concrete wall behind my bed, and there was no doubt in my mind a person was making the noise.


Now, I was just a kid, but I had my pride. I wanted to run upstairs screaming for my parents, but I also didn’t want them to think their son was a big baby. I may not have been the brightest kid out there, but even I knew that a person couldn't be on the other side of that wall; after all, there was just dirt on the other side, right? 


I stood there, staring at the wall for hours until the knocking suddenly stopped. I cautiously walked up to the wall and pressed my ear up against it, feeling the cold concrete's sting. I couldn’t hear anything at all, and after a few seconds, I turned off my light and climbed back into bed. I didn’t know it at the time, but this would be the first night my torment would start. 


Every night for the next seven months, I would get woken up by that damn knocking. Without fail, I’d be fast asleep and would shoot up out of bed in a cold sweat to the sound of knocking just behind my head. I mentioned it to my parents so many times; my Dad was perplexed at what it might be and called in a few contractors. None of them had any answers aside from the house expanding. We ended up moving my bed across the room, but the damn knocking just got louder! 


It felt like I hadn’t gotten a good night's sleep in years! My school work was being affected, friends said I was acting different, hell even my teachers were concerned. Especially after that lovely little poem I wrote. My parents were at a loss, they tried sleeping in the room with me, but they never heard the sound. Only I heard it; I would wake up my Dad and point to the wall…but he never heard the knocking. He pressed his ears right up against the wall and never heard it. I thought I was losing it…so did my parents. Shortly after this, my parents decided to get me some professional help. 



Let me tell you, seeing a psychiatrist as a kid was one of the most awkward experiences of my short life. You’ve got to understand, I had a wonderful childhood before all this late-night knocking nonsense. This shrink asked me whether or not anyone was touching me or had ever made me feel uncomfortable. She was trying to piece together trauma that could be causing these issues, but there was nothing to piece together! I got so mad; how dare she even begin to accuse my parents of this kind of shit! We got nowhere after a few sessions, but she did diagnose me with night terrors. All that work, and the only answer she had to give us was fucking night terrors. 



So I kept waking up every night to that goddamn knocking. My parents finally decided to move me upstairs at the psychiatrist's recommendation, but it didn’t work. No matter where I slept, I could still hear the knocking. It didn’t make any sense, but then again, stuff like this never does, right? I didn’t want to have friends over; I fell even further behind in school, and let's just say my overall mood was less than stellar. I was tormented by whatever was knocking on the wall every night, and I was at the end of my rope. 


I needed it to stop; they needed to go away; I had to get some peace and quiet; I needed to get some fucking sleep! 



Finally, one night I had enough. I woke up the same as always, breathing heavily and in a cold sweat to the sound of the knocking. 

Knock, knock, knock. 


Jumping out of bed, I screamed as loud as possible, “LEAVE ME ALONE!” and slammed my fist against the wall. I instantly recoiled in pain for a second but returned to banging my hand against the wall, one, two, three, four, five times before I stopped. Then, there was silence. For the first time at night, the only sound in my room was my own breathing. It was so peaceful; I must have stood there just taking in the silence for an hour..before it was broken by a most gentle sound… 


Knock, Knock, Knock. 


I’m not sure what compelled me to answer…but I did. I walked up to the wall, placed my hand against it, and responded… 


Knock, Knock, Knock. 



There was nothing but silence, and I felt relief wash over me. I took a few deep breaths and turned to get back in bed. 


Suddenly, a new sound rang out through my room, cracking. 

I turned around and looked at the wall to see a large crack spreading throughout it; before I knew it, the crack was all the way up the wall, I screamed for my parents when the wall gave way, and tons of dirt fell onto the floor! 


The force of the wall giving way and the dirt piling into my room knocked me over, and some of the soil fell onto my legs. I could hear my parents upstairs yelling and heard footsteps coming down the stairs; tears welled up in my eyes as I looked on at the dirt. Very slowly, a decaying hand pushed its way out and grabbed ahold of me. Soon several more hands moved their way through the dirt and pulled decaying bodies out of the earth that had spilled into my room. 



There were several of them; they all looked at me before slowly moving towards the sound of my parents yelling. I couldn’t make a noise, not because I didn’t want to but because a cold, slick hand had grabbed me by the throat and was squeezing the life out of me. I looked upon the face of what I believe was once a man. His skin had almost all rotted off, but he had just enough left to smile at me as I heard my parent's blood-curdling screams. 


So, you probably have a few questions, I guess. Like what happened to my sister? Where did they come from? Why did all these undead people storm into your home and kill your family? What happened to you, and how the hell are you sharing this story with us?! Well, I’ll give you the short answers. 


I’m confident that my sister is very dead. I'm sure they did to her what they did to my parents, which, well, decaying dead people don’t like to see the fresh skin of living people.


As far as where they came from, well, they came from the dirt. Speciallicaly from my backyard and surrounding neighborhood. Years ago, this area used to be a cemetery. The greedy bastards in this town decided to “relocate the graves” and sell this area for development. The only thing is, they didn’t move the bodies; they just took their headstones. Just think, you’re enjoying your afterlife, and suddenly you’re awoken and don’t remember your name. They STOLE your goddamn name!  


Why did these dead do it? It's obvious, isn’t it? Revenge! They want revenge on everyone who disturbed their rest and stole their names from them. The lack of respect for the dead must be punished; we bought the house, making us guilty. 


Finally, what happened to little old me. Do you remember our friend missing most of the skin on his face? He dragged me by my throat into the dirt as I kicked and tried to scream. The last thing I saw was the bloody face of my father as he tried to reach out for me, right before one of my new undead friends tore the skin from his face. A very unpleasant thing to witness for a kid. 


So, now here we are. After the undead killed my family, they all returned to the dirt where we’ve been ever since. The only thing is, I can’t seem to die. It’s been years, and even though I can’t seem to breathe, I’ve yet to die. Sure my body has started to decay, but I’m still conscious of everything around me. I’ve grown up here in the dirt, surrounded by the undead who crave revenge. They speak to me, or at least they try to. It's hard to talk when you don’t have a tongue. 







I’m angry too, do you understand why? My life was stolen from me, but I don’t blame my new family; they needed to do what they felt was right, and I understand their pain. For now, I feel it too. I don’t remember my name, father's name, sister's name, mom’s name, or even my family name! It’s gone; I can feel the hole in my memory where this information used to be, making it harder to accept. It was stolen from me, just like my family's life, and it’s all too much to bear. But, what choice do I have? I’m stuck here in this eternal prison, and you wanna know who I blame for this? Do you?! 


I blame you. 


If you are reading this note I’ve left, understand that we blame you for the fate that has befallen us all because now you live in the town my family once called home. Maybe it's a terrible stroke of luck that you’ve wound up here; you scream that you had nothing to do with what happened to us! 


We don’t care.


 You will understand our pain; you will pay for the greed that disturbed our rest and stole our names.


We blame you. 


So, 


If late one night, you wake up screaming 
And can hear us knock, knock, knocking
Don’t be afraid, just answer us, friend
And give us our revenge

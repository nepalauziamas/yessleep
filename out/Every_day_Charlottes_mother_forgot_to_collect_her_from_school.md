“I’m sure she’s just driving and can’t answer her phone, she’ll be here any moment.”

I tapped my fingers on the desk and shot a pitiful smile at the little girl opposite me. It was a hollow promise. We’d already been sat there for so long it was starting to get dark outside.

I’d already sent my teaching assistant home. What was the good in both of us suffering?

This wasn’t new. Some days it was minutes but often it was hours; the only thing consistent about Charlotte’s mother was her ability to forget she had a daughter. 

Charlotte was a bright child and a pleasure to teach. I couldn’t understand why everything seemed to be so against her.

The other kids were cruel to her, leaving her out of games and group activities. I’d tried gentle, private words with kinder members of the class, encouraging them to include her. They all said no.

*They said she was a witch.*

Children can be evil. You really get to see that when you teach the little crotch goblins. They were eight years old and already ostracising someone weaker, even going so far as to infer she was some sort of monster. How cruel. 

It made me really sad. The poor girl just couldn’t catch a break. It was like no one wanted to be around her; she was a magnet forcing itself to the wrong end of another magnet. *She repelled.*

“It’s ok Miss Tackett. I know she isn’t coming.”

Charlotte stared blankly at the desk in front of her. She hadn’t bothered to put her coat on, she was that conditioned to expect being forgotten. Her legs swung lightly back and forth below it. 

“Of course she’s coming Charlotte, your mother loves you... she’s, uh, just very busy.”

That was a half lie. I couldn’t definitively prove that Charlotte’s mother loved her, and it certainly didn’t seem that way sometimes. She would arrive late but unconcerned, almost reluctant to collect her child.

She looked haggard and tired, more so each time I saw her. She often looked like she hadn’t slept in days. She was jumpy, anxious and irritable. It was obvious she needed help, that she was struggling.

I tried not to judge her but it was hard, I sat with her forgotten child every day after that bell rang. How tired do you have to be to forget a child? Your only child. 

And just like the other kids in the class, when Charlotte’s mother would finally arrive, she looked at her as if she were some kind of monster.

“She doesn’t love me.”

I felt my heart drop. They were words you never wanted to hear a child say about their mother. They should all feel loved. Valued. The worst part was that she didn’t even seem bothered, she was immune to it.

I remembered the time I’d tried to make a report to social services about Charlotte. My concerns seemed like nothing to them. The girl was fed, clean and always arrived on time. She wasn’t withdrawn from school and didn’t seem bothered by her lack of friends.

*”We can’t investigate a mother for lateness just because it irritates a school.”*

That was what the lady on the phone said to me. Then she hung up. I tried. I really did. I wanted so badly to help Charlotte but I didn’t know how to. I wasn’t irritated by sitting with her like the social worker inferred, I just knew there was more to it. I could feel it. 

“What makes you think that she doesn’t love you?” I asked, desperate to draw out something that could help me help her.

“She’s scared of me.”

“What do you mean she’s scared of you?”

“She locks her room when we get home and she doesn’t come out until it’s time to take me to school.” She answered nonchalantly, swinging her feet under the desk.

“Doesn’t she make you dinner?” 

“Of course Miss Tackett, she leaves it prepared on the kitchen side, all I have to do is eat it.”

I thought of what an isolating existence that must be. To have no one to talk to all day and then go home to silence. What did Charlotte mean her mother was scared? What was her mother doing in that room? 

“Does she have anyone in there with her?”

“No Miss Tackett, she just stays in her room. She says it’s the only way she’s safe.”

A lump started to form in my throat. If she only felt safe in her room then why didn’t she keep her daughter in there too? *What was wrong with this woman?*

“Why wouldn’t she be safe?” I asked, struggling to reel in my own curiosity. 

“Because I’m there. I told you she’s scared of me.”

Her words were jarring. It took me a few moments to compose myself. It was a baffling thought, that anyone could be frightened of such a sweet young child.

“Why wouldn’t she be safe with you? What does she think you’d do to her?”

“Because I’m a witch. She thinks I might hurt her.”

Charlotte continued swinging her legs under the desk, her vacant state resident on her face. It broke my heart. I started mentally preparing a lesson on the effects of bullying. 

She was so confused, she’s twisted up the cruel taunts and the abuse at home and started to consider herself a monster. It was devastating. 

“Charlotte you aren’t a witch. You can tell me if the other kids are mean to you... I’ll talk to them. Why do they call you that?”

I fought back tears. I’d thought that getting into teaching would be fun and fulfilling but pupils like Charlotte were haunting. They worked their way into your thoughts long after that bell had rung.

“Because I broke Stephanie’s arm, with my mind.”

I was taken aback at her answer. 

I remembered the incident she was referring to. It was early into the school year and Stephanie tripped on the playground. She broke her arm in two places, it was nasty. A few other kids started a rumour that Charlotte had used her witch powers to do it. 

They had all stopped standing near her outside after that, despite my protests and pleas. They’d hammered it in so hard that it was her fault that Charlotte started to believe it.

“Stephanie fell Charlotte. You didn’t do it.”

“I made her fall.” 

“*You don’t have witch powers!* The other kids are just mean.” I practically screamed, trying to contain my rage. 

That was unprofessional. I know. I shouldn’t have been discussing the other kids, and especially not my feelings on them, with the victim of their targeting. I couldn’t help it, I just wanted to see her smile.

The rhythm of her swinging legs ground to a halt and she turned to face me, vacant eyes locked with mine and suddenly not so vacant anymore.

*She laughed.*

It was like the sound of nails running across a chalkboard slowly, dragged out to prolong the torture. It wasn’t a child’s laugh. It was something mocking, awful. I felt the sudden urge to walk out of the classroom and leave. Like everyone else in her life already had.

I couldn’t explain where it came from. Had it come from her? Or did I imagine it. No. It must have been me. *She was a child.* I had to stop thinking like that.

“What if the other kids are right though, Miss Tackett?” She asked sweetly, following that awful laugh.

“They aren’t.” I shook my head and composed myself. Charlotte’s mother would be here soon and I could talk to her about her daughter. Make her see how serious the situation was. I could help. “There’s nothing wrong with you.”

Charlotte’s facial expression changed. She frowned, trying to process my words and what they meant to her. It didn’t take long but I could see her calculating. Trying to work out weather she believed me or not. Maybe I was finally getting through.

Then it happened. 

I felt a crunch. Out of nowhere I was struck by a steering pain in my arm. I felt parts of bone brush past each other as they snapped and jutted out of different point of flesh. I fell to the floor, screaming. 

“I never said there was, Miss Tackett. I like being a witch.” 

*She was doing this.* A child. It was her.

“Charlotte, please stop!” I begged. “Your mother will be here any moment, please.... please stop.” I pleaded, desperate for her to stop hurting me.

Her eyes weren’t so vacant anymore, they focused on me with laser precision, revelling in my realisation that I’d gotten it all so badly wrong. 

I thought about how terrified her mother must have been. About how I hadn’t listened to her classmates concerns. All I’d ever seen was a victim. I was so wrong.

She looked at me writhing on the floor in agony and she rolled her eyes. I felt my heart pounding so hard I thought it might burst through my flesh. 

“She’s not coming, Miss Tackett.” Charlotte stood up from behind the desk and took a step towards the classroom door. 

“What did you do!?” I panted, wondering if that poor, tired woman was out there. If she was in the car and it was all just a cruel trick.

The little girl flashed me one more sinister grin as she exited the room.

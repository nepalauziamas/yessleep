 

Me and a few friends left town for awhile to have fun, after awhile we decided to go back home to see our family and other friends, I kinda wish we hadn’t now but anyways when we got back to our town, we all had a odd feeling, like something was off, soon we found out that the feeling we had ended up being true.

Anthony: hey, Jacob doesn’t this just feel weird, I’ve had a bad feeling ever since we came back into town and everyone is looking at us weird, its kinda freaking me out

Jacob(Me): I have the same feeling as well, and the fact that they are looking at us like this, it seems that they aren’t themselves.

Mike: I have the same feeling as well, and them looking at me, its freaking me out as well.

We didn’t live in a town that had a lot of people, so we knew everyone, so after noticing that everyone were looking at us like we were outsiders was strange

Even when we went to our homes, even our families just looked at us like we were outsiders, they wouldn’t say anything either. Me and my friends decided to meet up as soon as possible, somewhere away from people.

Mike: guys even my family is looking at me like I'm an outsider

We talked for a while, we found out that all 3 of us had our families acting strange too, and their families wouldn’t talk to them either. I half jokingly said, what if they are being controlled by something, they looked at me, Anthony: do you think so? Mike: What could be controlling them?

I realized that it could actually be the reason, but who or what did this? Why did they choose our small town over many others, is it because they don’t want to be spotted?

I said, I-I don’t know, this whole situation is just creepy-

Before me or my friends could say anything else, a guy, stranger than everyone else came up to us and repeatedly kept saying sacrifice

This freaked us out even further, why was this guy saying sacrifice repeatedly and why was that the only thing he was saying

Then more people came and just attacked us for no reason, I don’t remember what happened during that all I can remember was that we were knocked out

When I woke up, I saw my friends tied up and still out cold, seemly no one was here, so I tried to break the ropes around my hands, no success, I tried to pull my hands from out of the ropes, it felt like the rope kinda loosened so I kept rubbing my hands back and forth to get loose, eventually I got loose, I was going to untie my friends but I heard something coming so I hid and hoping to god that they wouldn't do anything with my friends, they noticed I was missing, they started talking but I couldn’t hear anything they were saying, then suddenly they split up so fast that I didn’t notice at first, I waited after awhile, so they would be gone. I went back to my friends, untied them as fast as I could, they were still unconscious, I didn’t know what to do so I slapped one of their faces to see if that will wake him up, he slowly came too, so I did the same with my other friend, he thankfully woke up as well.

After telling them that they were tied up and that people were looking for me to capture me again, we got up and wanted to run, We noticed we were surrounded, being the idiots we were, we decided to run, we ran in opposite directions, I know that sounds stupid, even back then i realized it was stupid.

After awhile, I think I found what was doing all of this, how the fuck did we not notice this thing before, it was so fucking huge, eventually my friends somehow came to my area, they froze in place terrified, I don’t blame them that thing was the biggest creature that we’ve ever seen.

I looked over to Mike, I was horrified, whatever that thing was, it impaled Mike without any of us noticing.

Me and Anthony both yelled Mike as loud has we could, I told Anthony we have to get the fuck out of here.

Anthony: What about Mike!?

I told him, it's too late Anthony, he got impaled in the chest, there is no way he could survive that, we both started to run, this time we went in the same direction to stick together. I turned my head to check behind me

ANTHONY!

He looked at me then he looked behind him, As soon as he saw it attack, it was too late, I lost my 2 best friends, my family and everyone that day.

Thankfully I could escape in time, Although the entire time I didn’t run into anyone from the town while escaping, which confused me, they were looking for me, but the entire time I was running, I didn’t see one person.

Since then I have been getting therapy, although they don’t believe me, they never do, and I don’t think they ever will. Years later I still have nightmares seeing that creature and my friends dying.

I just wish I could have saved them…

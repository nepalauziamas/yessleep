3 days ago, I (23M) was going to the gym, looking for a spot to park my car. I found one close to the gym, but a driver was blocking it (They weren't parked, just sitting in their car). I tried flickering my car lights to get their attention, but to no avail, so, I got out of my car, walked to the driver's open window, and asked them (in what I recall to be a polite manner and a smiley face) if they could move a little so that I can park. The driver (a mid 20s girl with another in the passenger's seat) gave me a look, that broke me on the spot to a million pieces. She wasted no time rolling up her car window, while still giving me that look, a mixture of frightened, startled and disgusted of me, and immediately drove off the whole street, the kind of reaction I would have if Michael Myers or the Babadook pulled up to me.
I tried to shrug it off, but needless to say, I couldn't, had a terrible workout, and for the last 3 days was in an extreme state of depression. Whenever I did any activity that normally brought me any little pleasure (watching tv, playing video games, even eating,....etc), I immediately remembered her staring look, followed by a shiver down my spine and immediately depression kicked in hard.

I always tried to convince myself that maybe one day, I will find people who understand me, who would give me a chance. I'm a senior student, but for the past six years, all of my colleagues have labelled me as a creep or a wierdo or a loser (I persume) and refused to hang out with me. I saw I wasn't accepted by anyone and never understood why. I kept trying to tell myself that maybe I'm too good for this people, maybe I am destined to find better company as I grow up, maybe the escape from this prison, this opression, this mentally and spiritually crushing ordeal, will be worthwhile, but I can't keep lying to myself any longer. I am an outcast, and I don't know why, and I'm likely never going to find out. Wherever I go, whether it's a place I've been before, or somewhere new, whoever I meet, whether they're someone I've met before, or a new acquaintance, I have always been (and will more likely than not continue to be) shunned out, without ever knowing why. I decided to write this reddit post so that if it all comes crashing around me one day, and I decide to end it all, I don't want my family (parents and older brother) to think I couldn't handle the pressure of medical school, nor to think I was bullied or abused in any way. I want them to have peace, knowing that I gave up on life because of this, because I felt like I never fit, and every time I push myself or am pushed to try to fit in, a part of me breaks, untill, little by little nothing will be left of me.

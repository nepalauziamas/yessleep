So two weeks have been passed since these events and I still can't really believe this. 

I remember it started on a Monday at work. To elaborate a bit: I work as a software developer for a company and my job is basically just writing code, develop new features and try to make sure our applications are stable. The person in charge of my department just tells me what the customers want, does all the communications with them and then makes tickets containing all the info with what must be developed. With that said, there is no need to use my phone during working hours. That's also why I put my phone in 'Do Not Disturb'-mode, so I could 100% focus on my work.

So, everything looked fairly normal on that Monday. I got up, ate breakfast, took a shower, brushed my teeth, put on some clothes, et cetera, et cetera and then drove to work. Once arrived, I took a look at the tickets that were still open, grabbed a coffee and then got started. Some lines of code, coffees, lunch, more lines of code and coffees later: the workday ended. I wished my colleagues a nice evening and got in my car. 

Usually, before I start the engine I always take a brief look on my phone. I mostly go real quick through some messages of friends (mainly sending me memes), the news and do a quick Instagram-check ('till this date, I still don't know why I do that last one, but anyways...). 

I get rarely called. Very rarely. If it does happen, it's mostly my dad or my mom, letting me know they're not home and I have to take care of my own cooking. 

But that day it was ... quite different. So I took out my phone and saw all these missed calls from an unknown number. This person had called me for like 12 times, but they left no message on my voicemail. I was concerned. I was hesitating whether to call back. I have this slight fear of calling strangers - I think it's something typical for my generation, it seems like we prefer most of our distant communication through texts -. 

I did it anyway, my heart was pounding, I hope it wasn't something bad: like my parents or sister, friend or someone of my family that had an accident. They picked up the phone on the other line. My voice trembled, I put out a soft: 

"Hello?" 

I heard someone breathing heavily and an unidentifiable background noise. Suddenly a voice started speaking, it seemed like the low voice of an old man: 

\- "Steve Daws."

I responded: "No this isn't Steve Daws. I think you got the wrong number, sir". 

He answered: "Steve Daws... Steve Daws will be killed."

My heart started racing. I was totally panicking. I got this lump in my throat. 

The only thing I could answer back was: "What?" 

The person on the other line hung up the phone. 

I was shocked, it felt like every muscle in my body was trembling. I tried to calm myself. It must have been a prank call. It had to be. I couldn't let it rest however and without much thinking I called the number back. I had to know. I took a deep breath while the phone was internally ringing. It couldn't be real. It just couldn't. 

I got no answer, the line was broke. Immediately after, I called a third time. Now, I got the message that the number was no longer in use. 

I tried to remember every word, every detail in our short conversation. Steve Daws? The background noise... what was it all? 

I went on Facebook, went to my friends list and started filtering on the name 'Steve'. I got one result but his last name wasn't Daws or Dawes or any possible way you could spell 'Daws'. I looked for his profile, but there seemed to be no Steve Daws in my neighbourhood. I did the same for my Instagram, but there was no Steve Daws that followed me or a Steve Daws that I followed. I searched the name on Google Images, but didn't recognise anyone that I would've met in real life. I sat back in my seat, figured if I should call the police or not. I knew, however, that I couldn't provide them enough answers to investigate. I could only answer the first question they would probably ask me: "Who?", in the context of the possible victim. But after that... the W-fire of "What? When? Where?" ... it would stop for me. I just hadn't enough information and I feel like I would waste their time. 

Since it was getting pretty late, I decided to drive home and ask my parents for advice. When I told the bizarre story to my mom, she frowned, trying to interpret what I just told her. I asked her if she know a Steve Daws. She thought deeply. 

"No, I don't think I know a Steve Daws. Not that I know.", She said.

I also put the question to my father. Negative. He tried to comfort me, telling it was probably some new strategy of scammers to break into my bank account. 

To ease my mind, I took that for truth and tried not to think about it much longer for the rest of the day.

The next day I prepared myself for another day at work. When I arrived in the office  I told the story to one of my colleagues. He laughed at it, giving me the: "You should not be drinking while at work!". I didn't get into much further detail and just continued my work.  

The work day ended again, it was a Tuesday. I finished things up and made myself ready to drive home. Before I drove off, I took a look on my phone: missed calls. Again 12 times. The number was, however, different from the day before. I called back.  

"Who is this?", I said as soon as the phone was picked up. It was the same voice on the other line. 

\- "Ivy Stern." 

"Ivy Stern? But what happened to Steve Daws?" 

But the voice started talking again before I could finish my sentence:

\- "Ivy Stern... Ivy Stern will be killed."

I tried to keep him on the phone, but it was no use. He hung up the phone before I even could ask another question. 

I repeated my steps from the first time in search for Ivy Stern and my connection with her. I found nothing. Once again I drive home and told my parents the story. I told them I felt anxious and that I wanted to go to the police station and hand my phone in so they could investigate the matter. 

And that's what I did. The officer didn't want to take my phone, however, declaring that it was not a normal procedure, and advised me to pick up the phone immediately as soon as he or they would call again.

Reluctantly I went back home. The next day I turned off the 'Do Not Disturb'-mode. Nearing the end of the day my phone rang. Unknown number. I picked up immediately and went outside the office. 

"Hello?", I said. 

I heard a crackling noise. It sounded like a news broadcast from the local radio: 

"5 PM, news ..." 

The sound often dropped and I had to prick up my ears to understand the message: 

"... the neighbourhood is shocked by a murder on a young couple ...police are investigating the place... ... our reporter elaborates on the details"

The voice of the reporter took over: 

"The situation is horrendous...Of the couple, each have been stabbed 12 times...Police won't give much details but the casualties appear to be a man and a woman with the respective names of Steve Daws and Ivy Stern." After that, the call had ended again.

All went so fast. I don't remember much of what I did back then. According to my co-worker, I stumbled back into the office with - what he declared as - 'zombie'-eyes and was searching on my computer like a mad man, going through every online newspaper to see if what I heard was real. It sadly was. After that, I collapsed and they called an ambulance. They took me to the hospital, but I was allowed to return home the same night.

It's been a few days now since the events have passed. My boss told me to get some time off as he saw the news drove me insane. 

I sat down with the police a few times. I have told the story so much now, to so many people. 

Except here. 

I felt like it is the only way for me to cope with it. The police interrogated me in their attempt to solve the connection between the phone calls, the murders and me...  

For the people who are interested: I stopped receiving these strange phone calls since then. I tried to call the numbers back. Result? No longer in use. 

I told my boss I'll be at work again in a few days. I don't know if I'll ever be able to give it a place. If there was ever a chance that I would get rid of my telephobia, it certainly isn't anymore...

I arrived to a vacation home on Thursday, a small two bedroom cabin, deep into the woods of Denmark. Apon arrival, I looked at the two bedrooms and decided on the one I wanted. 

The cabin wasn't deserted in the woods, there were a few other houses around me, a neighborhood. I was house 23. The cabin had a small shed a couple feet away, housing a washing machine, a dryer, and two bikes. A female bike and a male bike. The female bike being green, and the male bike being black.

 I inspected the two bikes for any spider webs, and hopped on the green one, the tires felt quite flat. "What are you doing?" A voice behind me spoke, not in a way that made me seem caught for something, but a genuine question. I turn, my dad standing in the doorway, looking over my shoulder to the bikes. "Oh, nothing." I say, "I'm just looking at these two bikes." I move to the side so my dad can get a better look. "They look like they're in good shape, think you'll go on a bike ride?" My dad asks me. "Yea, I have to pump up the tires then I'll go." I respond, turning around and looking for a tire pump. "Want me to go with you? You don't know the place very well." My dad takes a step forward, picking up a laundry basket and opening the washing machine." "No thanks, I won't go far. I'm just going to clear my mind." I say, turning to him and smiling. 

Twenty minutes later, both tires are fully pumped and the seat adjusted to the correct height for me. I pull it outside, setting it on the grass. "Dad, I'm going for a bike ride now!" I shout into the house from outside. He doesn't respond, he probably didn't hear me. I start the bike and ride onto the road, we barely have any cars drive by, plus, there isn't a sidewalk to ride on anyways. 

I speed up the bike, going about five miles an hour, considerably slow, knowing how fast the bike can go. I saw a sign that told me where a small lake was, so I Headed that way. A couple of hills later, I saw the lake. It was beautiful, the water almost a gold color, due to the setting sun. The trees around it making it feel so secluded, so safe. But for some reason, I didn't feel safe. I felt a sense of dread, like I was being followed. I turned around, no one was behind me. I sigh, trying to feel relief, but I didn't. I kept pedaling, faster and faster, going the fastest I possibly could. 

I passed a sharp turn on the path that looped the lake, almost falling In. Out of the corner of my eyes I swear I saw someone walking towards me, I jumped off my bike, sprinting away. I was almost back home, I just needed to run up hill. I sprint faster, I start heading a second set of footsteps behind me, not running, but walking at almost an impossibly fast pace. The footsteps sound slow, but the noise is right behind me. I see the driveway that belongs to the small cabin that is mine. I try to speed up, failing because my legs are so tired. The footsteps get louder. I rush into the house and slam the door behind me, quickly locking it. "Dad!" I shout. Running to his bedroom. "Hey are you okay?" He stands up and walks towards me. "T-there w-was.. a-and I..." I stutter, trying to pull myself together. "There was someone following me." I say quietly.

5 days later, we arrived home. I write this in my bedroom, unpacking my clothes. Even though we're home, I still feel that awful sense of dread, of panic. As If I might just turn my head, or turn the corner, and see that person once again. So I turn my head, just to make sure.

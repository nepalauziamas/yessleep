Neon lights decorated the house of mirrors. Our reflections went on forever as we tried to find the right path. Ancaer found it hard to walk through the narrow pathway. The place had been built for children, not someone his size. The flashing lights and glowing carpet patterns made my head hurt right away. I needed to step in front of the larger man to turn a sharp corner. We were only a step away from each other, but a mirror shot up from the floor, right between us. I heard Ancaer roar and bang on the glass but it didn’t crack in the slightest; I also banged my shoulder against the glass trying to reach him. On the third slam, the mirror disappeared, causing me to tumble forward into a mirrored pathway.  

Standing up, I clutched the jacket to my shoulders and looked around, trying to find a way out. My breath caught when I saw the reflection looking back. The person in the mirror looked like I did before I started to transition. A small teenager with baggy clothing and short hair. Each mirror had different versions of myself in my teens. My chest started to hurt, looking at who I’d been so many years ago. I knew what this place wanted to do, but my reaction did not line up to the mental torment the Carnival wanted to inflict on me. When I saw an image of myself with the worst dye job ever, I snorted out a laugh. I’d forgotten what that cheap hair dye did to my hair. That was the last time I ever bothered dying my hair. The reflections started to flicker at my laughter, as if they were confused. I thought I saw an exit sign appear in the distance, so I carefully started to make my way over, not bothering to look at those past images of myself. The way out was blocked by another mirror. I stopped and pressed a hand against it trying to see if I could somehow get through. Another image of myself appeared and I felt my shoulders tense, seeing who I’d been. 

“You did nothing for Layla. If you were there, she would have been fine. If you had just checked in on her, she wouldn’t be the way she is.” The reflection said in a different voice than my current one. 

“I know.” I said, a regretful smile coming to my face. 

That wasn’t what the reflection wanted. The face twisted in a snarl trying to get under my skin.  

“She’ll never have her freedom again because of you!” It snapped back. 

“I’ll never forgive myself for not being able to help her sooner. But there isn’t anything else I can do now but accept it happened and do my best to support her kids.”  

If I hadn’t met Nick, I would not have had this sort of outlook. Without him, Layla would have turned into a full witch and most likely have eaten her children when suffering from withdrawals. I gave her money and funded her habit, but I never had any idea such a thing was happening. My goal had just been to help her in any way I could back then.  

“Are you fine with that? Moving on and leaving her behind? Cutting open a friend who cares about you to turn yourself into something else? Everything else doesn’t matter as long as you’re happy, isn’t that right?” The reflection taunted, and I shook my head. 

“I'm not going to cut open Nick. I don’t need to use his power to change my body to be male. It’s who I am without magic, the surgery is enough. Even if there are some people out there who won’t ever see me as a guy, who cares? Nick called me his brother. That’s all that matters.” 

I smiled, finally being able to accept myself. I thought I had before, but I still had doubts before becoming Nick’s partner. My body wasn’t what I felt like it should be just yet, but I liked how I looked. There was pride in everything I’d done to get this far and the work I’d put into it. All those hours worked, all the temp jobs and pulling extra shifts for the money for the first surgery were worth it. All the sacrifices I had made was in order for me to look in the mirror and like the image reflected back. 

“How dare you feel this way after everything you tossed aside! You could have had an easy time and yet you picked this life and had the nerve to complain about it!” The reflection shot back, trying anything at this point. 

I stood a bit shocked it had brought that up. I’d almost forgotten about all of that. My parents were well off. Practically rich. We had hired help and pure white carpets no one was allowed to walk on. My almost forgotten childhood memories of being inside that empty house, with only my sister sometimes spending time with me. Our parents easily could afford to buy us anything, causing me to never want anything. I never asked for presents, and when they gave me new game consoles, or bikes, I donated them. My sister might have turned out the way she did because of that lifestyle. I never thought I’d earned such a life and found myself asking our maids to teach me how to do chores. That mindset helped me to be able to handle myself when I got kicked out. 

Another laugh came bubbling up that I couldn’t hold back. I had totally forgotten about my early life, and had been jealous of how rich Nick is. It was as if I’d never lived that sort of life in the first place. 

The reflection stomped angrily at my laughter and started to change into something else. The form started to become covered by an inky darkness almost like oil. It shrank as if I stood in front of a child pulled from a tar pit. Carefully I reached out, finding I could put my hand through the mirror and touch the slick person who took a step back. Using the sleeve of the jacket, I started to clean away the oil so I could see somewhat of a face. 

“Your partner did the same thing...” A small soft voice came. 

“Is he alright?” I asked, finally showing the worried scared emotion the creature wanted. 

“His lack of memories is proving it difficult to cause him to break. However, if he is anything like yourself, I doubt there is anything I can do. I could kill you a thousand times and you would still press forward trying to reach him. I really dislike people like you.” 

I really didn’t know if this was good or bad news. Nick came in here to remember things. If his memories faded, that would hurt him more than facing his past. At least I knew I had a chance of reaching him. A rumbling in the distance caused the small creature to flinch and glare behind their shoulder. 

“The other one you brought is easily broken but strong. I’m tired of having him here. If you are able to reach them both and calm them down, I’ll let you all leave. “ 

Even though this creature had put us through so much, I almost wanted to hug it. I needed to decide if I should find Nick first, or Ancaer. Ancaer sounded closer but who knows what this place was truly like. The creature stepped aside, leaving the exit clear. I took a deep breath, readying myself to go forward. No matter what happened, I would support Nick and Ancaer so we could all leave together. 

I walked through the door and out into the main street with the line of games. I heard the sounds of them going off but didn’t spot anyone outside. The fog still lingered over the sky, blocking it out from view. I started down the row looking for danger, when I heard someone calling out for my attention. Turning, I saw Nick standing in one of the game booths. He looked unharmed. His long hair was tied back and he wore normal clothing instead of his suit. I hurried over, thankful to finally see him. 

“Do you want to play a few rounds? It’s five dollars for six shots.” He said, not noticing how concerned I looked. 

He placed an air rifle on the counter. Toys hung from the booth and some targets were set up a bit further back. I almost refused but decided to play along for the moment. Taking money from my wallet, I carefully put it down and picked up the rifle.  

“Are you ok Nickie?” I asked, hoping for a positive answer. 

For a moment he looked confused. His face cleared when he realized I just called him by his name. For some reason, he’d even forgotten that. When he spoke again his tone changed. Some people might not be able to tell the difference, but I heard the new emotion in his voice as if he’d become just a soft-spoken person. 

“Is that my name? For some reason I’d forgotten it... Which prize are you aiming for? I like the pink lion myself.” He said as he nodded towards a medium-sized lion plush. 

“I’ll win it for you.” I told him, and raised the rifle. 

I needed a few warm ups hitting the targets. When I reached into my wallet for more money, I found the bills from before had appeared back inside. The Carnival decided to go easy on us and refused to let me run out of chances to shoot. 

“You’re a good shot despite not going to the shooting range as often as you should.” Nick commented with his back turned to watch me knock over one target. 

“I can’t believe your just gave me a backhanded comment.” I played along as I lined up another shot. 

“It’s what brothers are for.” 

I nearly cried at that comment. His tone of voice and that little smile afterwards should have been easy for him if he didn't have is rough past. I wanted nothing more than him to have a normal life and a regular job. Not being forced to kill supernatural creatures or risk his life. I didn’t want him to consider himself as a tool and held back how his emotion subconsciously. I shook my head, not sure of where to start. 

“I told you to not come here, didn’t I?” Nick asked slowly as things started to come back. “I'm glad you did even though it might have been stupid. I don’t remember much, but I know you. It's nice to see you here Skyler.” 

If we kept talking, more might come back to him. I might not need Ancaer to tell us about Nick's past depending on how this went. I almost stopped shooting but he reminded me I had a few more chances left. After they were up, I paused, placing down more money on the counter. I wondered on what I should bring up first. 

“I was worried about you Snickerdoodle. I’ll help you get your memories back then we can leave with Ancaer.” I said, picking up the rifle again. 

“My old partner gave me nicknames too. You remind me a little of her. I wonder if I’d been selfish and used you a little. I did act selfish and come here, didn’t I?” He said with his arms crossed, trying to piece together where we were. 

“I was using you for some quick cash to start with so I think we’re even. I'm glad you remembered a little bit about her. Do you know what she called you? If she used any of my names I’ll be pissed.” I added with a small laugh. 

He kept thinking on the question when his face finally cleared. 

“I think it might have been-” 

“My little Marshmallow.” A new voice finished. 

I jumped a little when I saw a woman sitting on a stool next to me. Her face was blurry, making it impossible to see her features. But the rest of her was clear. Her long blond hair reached past her waist and was tied back, her suit jacket was open along with nearly half her dress shirt. She crossed her legs and laughed at our reactions. Her voice sounded so familiar and yet I couldn’t place it for a second. She had the same tone Nick used. But if this was what he remembered of Miki, then that made sense. I've stopped swearing so they might have started to talk like each other depending on how much time they spent together. She pulled out a cigarette and lit it only to have Nick scold her.  

“It’s not as if these are going to kill me. You still have shots left, right? Aren’t you going to win Marshmallow that lion?” She asked, and I nodded. 

At least he could remember this much of her without any terrible reactions. I didn’t know what to expect of his past partner, but not this. Her tone was even, but her shirt was open in such a flirty way that it put me off for a second. I started getting better at knocking down targets but needed more practice to get them all. 

“I came here because I wanted to see you again.” Nick said, looking over to his long dead partner. 

“Not just me, I think. Don’t you feel guilty being the cause of another loved one’s death? A certain alchemist maybe?” She offered. 

Nick shook his head, implying Miki was right, but he couldn’t remember anything about the man. Unlike her, there wasn’t anything left inside his head to bring up even a shadow of what he looked like. But I knew. Mage showed me what Alabaster looked like. I felt my heart skip a beat as I wondered if that would work. 

“I know what he looks like.” I offered. 

Nick’s head snapped up, a mixture of dread and hope on his face. He started to ask what his creator was like when another figure appeared on the other end of the booth. He stood in front of Miki across the counter, his face in a sad smile seeing Nick again. Even if this wasn’t real, his memories of their personalities made it real enough. Seeing Nick and Alabaster so close at the same time, I couldn’t help but notice how much alike they looked. Both of their faces fell from seeing each other again.  

“I never should have made you...” The man said in such a low tone I almost didn’t hear him. 

I tried shouting at him for such a comment to find my voice muted. I could only stand back and watch him say such terrible things about my partner, unable to support him. Nick didn’t appear affected by the comment. He just stood there with a blank look on his face, ready to listen.  

“You should keep shooting. Maybe winning that lion could change something. Should make him happy.” Miki suggested as she put out her cigarette on the rough wooden counter. 

Being able to do nothing else, I placed more money down and fired off another shot. My hands were shaking too much to hit the targets.  

“I killed so many of those other stones in my madness. I caused you to suffer so much, and I let myself be killed leaving you behind. I can never do anything to make you forgive me for such actions. A stone should never feel hatred and yet-” 

“I never hated you.” Nick corrected him, with a hint of tears in his voice. “None of the other stones hated you for their deaths. In the end, I brought back the one you wanted, making their lives mean something. It’s simply the nature of stones. We are tools and as long as we’re used, then we serve our purpose. But... the one I brought back killed you. You felt so guilty over the previous stones you let your life be taken. I felt angry you would just give up like that, but I... was angrier at myself for these feelings. After everything you did, I could never hate you. What kind of person does that make me...?” 

I nearly dropped the air rifle to leap over the counter to go over to him. Miki stood up and the faceless memory took a hold of my shoulder keeping me in one spot. My voice still wouldn’t come as I fought to talk to Nick. I wanted to tell him so many things in that moment. Alabaster listened with a distraught look on his face. Then he slowly started to change into something else. His cheeks hollowed out and his golden hair grew dull. He appeared like a corpse as he started walking towards Nick with a boney hand outstretched.  

“That makes you a stone, doesn’t it? A tool to be used. Something without any power of your own to protect what you care about. Your new partner is going to use you. And your new partner is going to die before you. Stones take forever to fade. Old age shall take him and then what are you going to do? Twist him into something else? Something inhuman? What are you going to do without him?” The creature asked, as he took short creaking steps forwards. 

I’d never through of that fact before. My stomach sank to the ground waiting for the answer. No matter what I did, Nick would end up alone. I was only human and no matter how much I wanted; I couldn’t stay with him forever. My death was an unchangeable outcome. My body froze, not only from the grim outlook, but by Miki holding me back. Alabaster got within arm’s reach, and I expected Nick to push him away... Instead, he reached out to pull the alchemist into a tight hug.  

“It’ll hurt but I’ll be able to handle it because I love him just as much as I loved you and Miki. I’m glad I had all of you regardless of how it ended, and I know I’ll be alright.” 

Pulling away, Nick gave the man the widest smile I’d ever seen. The memory of his father changed back into a healthy version of himself. His eyes filled with tears seeing a stone he considered as a son doing so much better long after he’d died. I hated the fact that Nick lost this man before they could have a real relationship.  

“You only have one target left. You should fire the last shot.” Miki whispered into my ear. 

I knew that one shot was the last thing I could do for him. Nick handled everything pretty much on his own leaving me to meet him on the other side with a small gift to make him feel slightly better. His past was no longer able to hold him down and force him to see himself as a tool. Nick could finally just be himself after years of feeling guilty for things that were out of his control. He looked over to meet my eyes and nodded silently, telling me he felt ready to leave. 

The last target fell over and the fog covered the area blocking me from my partner. I wasn’t concerned. I knew we could leave if I could just find Ancaer and get his issues figured out. He might be harder to handle because I really didn’t understand the man very well, let alone his past. When the fog cleared, I found myself standing on the outside of the house or mirrors. He’d never found the way out. Without a second thought, I charged inside trying to find him. 

The noise made it easy. I still bounced off some mirrors and nearly broke my nose on one. I followed his voice and him crashing around breaking mirrors. I turned a corner to see him in a cleared-out space after smashing so many, Ancaer's knuckles bloody from the effort. Each shard of mirror held countless eyes looking in Ancaer’s direction. His body had transformed into something that was practically a beast as he raged through, roaring at the eyes to stop looking at him. More mirrors sprang up and a shadow monster with red eyes looked back at him. I shouted his name but he couldn’t hear my voice over the sounds of him smashing anything that appeared in front of him.  

The image in the cracked mirror shifted to something that confused me. For a brief second it looked like a child’s drawing of a person with large red hair. The sight of the drawing set him off to the point he started to toss magic around. A red-hot blast shot out, taking apart the building. The glass pieces were picked up by the wind and shot back into my body. Some bounced off the jacket I still wore like a cloak but bigger pieces found my face and a nasty one went through my eyes, ending my life again. 

Dying really sucked. The pain felt more than anything I’d even gone through before. For a long time, I didn’t think I would wake back up. When I did, I sat up with tears in my eyes, convinced that I would remain dead, or die again. I gritted my teeth and pushed back my fears, refusing to give in.  

I stood up in what looked to be a war zone. The house of mirrors been destroyed and the game booths had been torn to pieces. I prayed Nick hadn’t gotten caught up in any of this. Ancaer roared off in the distance and I ran forward, knowing how dangerous it would be to get close to him. I easily caught up to him. He thrashed around, attacking other versions of himself. I shouted his name even though I knew he probably couldn’t hear me. His body got torn apart only for him to heal seconds later and start fighting again. Sheets of paper started to come from the foggy sky like snow. Each with that childish drawing fluttering around and making it hard to see. When one of the false Ancaers ripped a drawing, he snapped further.  

I spotted a figure off in a corner. The oil covered child that represented the Carnival stood between two booths. A smile appeared on their face and I started to get angry. They said we could all leave because they knew I wouldn’t have a chance to reach Ancaer. I refused to let them have their way. Ancaer needed to suck it up so we could get Nick home. 

I ignored the creature to run into the fight. Slipping on some paper I was nearly torn apart by a false Ancaer when a large leg blocked the attack. A head came down to bite the body in half and quickly spat it back out. 

“Do not harm my agent!!” The beast roared so loud it shook the ground. 

I looked up, seeing what Ancaer had turned into. His massive body looked like a bear fused with a lion. His front legs were skinnier than his stocky back legs. A long, flowing dark mane covered half his body. His fangs were almost as tall as myself. His orange glowing eyes didn’t look focused, but I still pressed against his side trying to talk him down. 

“You need to calm down! You’re just fighting against yourself!” I pleaded with him. 

The other false creatures started to shift and get closer to us. He focused on them and refused to listen to what I kept saying. He moved aside to attack the others, lost in rage.  

“Oh, come on!” I shouted after him getting frustrated. 

How did I get stuck with such a person? He quickly darted off to keep attacking. I didn’t think I could do anything to get him to stop. I didn’t have magic or any real power of my own. What I wanted the most was to punch him in the face, so I decided I would do just that. To get his attention, I ran towards a false version of him, causing it to turn towards me with claws ready. The real Ancaer started forward and I turned on my heel ready to put everything into a punch to his beast like face. A light started to appear from his mouth and he directed it towards the false version, unaware that the magic would also hit me. And yet, I still stayed on course. The light overtook my vision and I felt something snap as my fist came into contact with something solid. 

We were both blown back as the magic exploded outwards destroying more buildings. The sounds were overwhelming. My body kept flying back until it hit something hard causing all the air to leave my lungs. For a long while I couldn’t even open my eyes again.  

When I could move, I sat up, my whole body in pain. My arms refused to move and if I hadn’t been able to see my legs, I would think they'd been cut off. I never would have thought I could knock back powerful magic like Ancaer’s with just my willpower. It happened, but for a cost. I didn’t know how long it would take to recover from the attack. The fog filled in most of the space. Through the mist, I spotted a hobbling shape. Ancaer came into view and fell to his knees, unable to get any closer.  

“Did you punch me in the face?” He asked with a hoarse voice. 

“You earned it.” 

He fell to the ground and rolled on his back to look up. I didn’t think cancelling out his magic would hurt him this badly. At least he still stayed awake.  

“We need to find Nicolas...” He said finally. 

“I already found him. He's fine.” I said, causing him to relax a little. 

Since we were both stuck in one spot, I figured I would take a chance and ask some questions I’ve wanted answers to for a while. After seeing a faint memory of Miki, I needed to know something because I felt as if both Aberash and Ancaer lied about her death.  

“Why did Nick need to shoot his partner? I was told she went feral but she’s human, right? Humans don’t go feral...” I questioned.  

A long silence came between us as he considered the question. He still wanted to hide so many things, thinking it was for the best. 

“You went feral and bit Justice.” He answered back, almost making me laugh. “I wish you were his first partner. I never wanted him to be around her...” He added in a low tone.

That shocked me. From what I could tell, Miki had been a good person. Nick kept most of her things and cared about her so deeply, her death had caused him to see himself as something less than human. And yet Ancaer acted as if she’d done something unforgivable.  

“There is no reset button. We can deal with what happened. We just need to keep moving forwards, and get the hell out of here.” 

Exhaustion started to set in. I found myself struggling to stay awake. No matter how much I wanted to keep my eyes open I found my head nodding. I hadn't finished my job there yet. But my body refused to listen and I fell asleep. I felt my body getting lifted off the ground before I finally faded off into darkness. 

After an unknown period of time, I started to come to again and saw Nick first. He was holding onto the pink lion plush. He had his eyes closed but he looked fine. I got embarrassed when I realized Ancaer carried both of us as if we were children. I didn’t even think my father had ever carried me like this before. I soon fell asleep again for a while, or at least for as long as it took to walk out of the Carnival.  

Aberash took over holding me up. I found myself waking up while trying to stay on my feet as she spoke trying to see what happened inside. She assumed I would make it out with Nick but I had a feeling she doubted Ancaer would be with us. I saw Nick was also awake, standing on uneven legs with Ancaer carefully keeping him upright with one hand on his back. I accepted some kisses to my cheeks from Aberash but needed to go over to Nick to see how he felt. At least Aberash didn’t look offended when I walked away from her.  

When I walked over, Ancaer started to talk with her. Very quickly the conversation got heated. Nick could stand on his own and he started to appear stressed over the different language suddenly being shouted between the two. He held the lion closer, trying to figure out what to do. Aberash almost ripped out Ancaer’s throat over what he said to her, and Nick and I had no idea what it could possibly have been. Her necklaces started to change and cover her chest as if it started to become armor. I raised my hand, ready to get between the two. 

“I have a pink lion.” Nick said, cutting through the fight. 

They both paused, at a loss for words. Aberash returned to normal and Ancaer almost smiled. With a long sigh, Aberash forced a smile on her face. 

“I see that sweetie. Who got that for you?” She asked, focusing on Nick for the moment. 

“Ancaer.” I lied, throwing him under the bus. 

The taller man flushed, denial all over his face. He needed to walk away and pace so he wouldn’t get into a yelling fit again. It was worth it. Nick didn’t even have a chance to thank Ancaer for the plush. It appeared as if he didn’t really remember much of what happened inside the Carnival. Taking my hand, Aberash looked much calmer than before. 

“We’re thinking about letting everything be declassified. It'll take about three days to get everything organized though. Is that alright with you two?” She asked. 

I nodded along with Nick. I didn’t know why it would take so long just to tell us the real reason why Nick been forced to kill his partner. But I wanted to trust them. I loved Aberash and I found myself wanting to believe in Ancaer.  

“Are you alright with waiting for three days?” I asked Nick, still worried about putting things off. 

“It’s fine. I can wait.” He said. 

That regular tone of his voice stayed. He looked so tired and spoke so softly I'd been the only one able to hear him. I wonder how everyone else would react to his slight change. Aberash noticed how exhausted we looked and got started to get us home. I agreed to watch over Nick and head home with him. I’d already been pretty much staying with him for the past while. I only returned to my apartment to do laundry because I kept getting lost in the mansion. We returned home, unsure of how the day affected Nick. 

The moment we got back Mage came charging out the door, tackling Nick at the waist. He somehow knew something had happened. For a while he couldn’t tell where Nick had gone in the world and thought he died. All the effort of putting up an indifferent front came tumbling down as he could barely keep from sobbing while berating my partner for disappearing. When Nick started to pet his head and speak to him in a kind tone of voice, Mage snapped. He kept sobbing that Nick sounded perfect out of nowhere and he didn’t know how to deal with it. I needed to help carry him back into the house and onto a couch so Nick could get started on dinner. I wanted him to rest but he promised that a good meal was the only thing to make Mage feel better. He even let Mage hold the highly prized pink lion plush.  

It took hours to calm him down. We got him tucked into bed after he cried himself out after eating a large dinner. I'd never seen someone eat five whole pounds of pasta while sobbing before. I felt as tired as Mage had acted before he passed out in his food bowl. I stayed awake long enough to get changed and stood by the bedroom door that I’d been using for a while.  

“Are you sure you’re alright with all of this?” I asked once again, my voice cracking from the lack of energy. 

“I'm fine. I’ll take the next few days off. If you’re able, it would be nice to spend time with you for a bit.” He offered. 

Aside from doing cases and some odd days, we didn’t really spend time together lately. I did stay by his side as he recovered but we did find our time getting taken up by other things, so I decided could ignore my day job for a bit. Jimmy would need to forgive me for that. I was about to pass out on my feet when Nick spoke again. 

“I’d forgotten something.” 

I didn’t get a chance to ask what he meant before he walked over and pulled us into a hug.  

“This is embarrassing.” I told him, my face turning red. 

“You earned it. You did something stupid and came to get me and... I’m glad for that. I couldn’t remember anything, not even my own name and that felt so frightening, I didn’t know what to do until you arrived.” Nick said, refusing to let me go. 

As much as I wanted to keep the hug going and tell him how I would do anything for him, my brain and body just wanted to go into my comfy bed. I nearly fell asleep in his arms. He needed to help me across the large room and even tucked me in. I was out before my head even hit the pillow. 

My plan was to ditch my job for three days and hang out with Nickie. But first I needed to get some rest. We both did. In the middle of the night, I woke up to go to the washroom and nearly tripped over Nick. I’d forgotten about his habit of sleeping next to the bed instead of on it. At least he’d dragged a blanket over, so that was an improvement. When I finished the washroom trip, I came back and pulled my blankets off my bed along with the pillows just so I could sleep next to Nick. In the moment, I just felt happy to have him home and was completely unaware of what would be coming in the next three days.

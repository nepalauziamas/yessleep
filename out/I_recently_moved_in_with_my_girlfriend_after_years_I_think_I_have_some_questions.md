I never was a religious man, nor a spiritual man for that matter. So when I eventually moved out of my parents' basement and into my four year girlfriends’ apartment in a small city on the east coast, I really only thought one thing when I saw the eldritch horror paraphernalia strewn across her walls… ‘was she a horror buff without my knowing?’. “Wow, a lot of originality in your décor here Tiff, get it all from Spahn Ranch? Or do you just like garage sales”? I would chuckle as I felt the nudging elbow in my side, along with one of the expertly crafted retorts I often got when I gave her hell like this, “Oh ha ha, wise guy, an awful lot of talk coming from a guy who’s main aesthetic were the various fast food bags, and bottles of empty sodas you had collected over the week.” She had me there, when it came down to it I really had no room to talk shit, the most effort I had put into making a room out of that old basement was attempting to kill the rat who’d also made a home out of my basement, and now saying that i should mention that my ‘pet’ rat Carlos had been trying to reach my fingers in order to gnaw on them for the past half hour.  

As she closed the door, and walked further into the home I was blasted by a sudden charm in the air, and even Carlos seemed to calm down in his cage, settling into a low movement state as he stopped trying to bite me with a passion. “So, this is the place where the magic happens?” I would throw out, trying to match the new energy I felt around me, like if I had to describe it at the time, it felt like we were secluded from the rest of the world, safe, separate and serene, but almost like we were being watched over, cared for…

   “Well, I guess you could say that, but more or less this is where I bring victims under my spell”. I would feel my spine tingle, and my stomach would flip in my torso as I rendered the flirt coming my way, and as I put Carlos down I walked over to where she’d made her regal spot on the couch, her beautiful blonde hair spreading over the back of the couch like a field of golden wheat, laying down beside her, my head in her lap and my eyes falling into hers, the beautiful ocean of blue that held the worlds secrets, the ocean itself would have a hard time drawing a sailors gaze when she were around..  

“Well , you’ve got me, your trance worked, I give”. She would giggle as she began running her hands through my hair, and I began to find myself sinking, had I been this tired before hand? I found my focus on her eyes harder to resist as I began to dive further and further into the water, swimming deeper, deeper until the light of the world was lost on my eyes, I couldn’t see it, but there was something else there in the deep black hue of the abyss, a glow below men growing brighter from being barely noticeable, as I got closer, I forsook my need to breathe for this hue, but I couldn’t get closer, feeling myself suddenly gain the buoyancy needed to start catapulting from the water, I choked and nearly screamed as I remembered that long lost thought of breathing, the burn building in my chest before… I woke up, drenched in sweat, and laying beside a beautifully serene Tiffany, the lights off and the sun down...

What had happened in the past few hours?.. 

I relieved myself of the blankets as my naked body made it’s way to the large master bathroom of the apartment. Washing up before making my way out, looking around for my little enemy turned uneasy companion, setting out to feed the little scamp before turning in, my energy feeling low, however as I looked I just couldn’t find him or his cage anywhere at all, had she put him off somewhere as to not disturb my sudden sleep? I would have to ask her in the morning when she wakes up… 

any way, I can feel the call to sleep so I think I'll end this here. The reason I started writing this however is that I feel like a few of the weirdos on here can help me figure out what some of the items, and names scattered around the décor and items in this apartment, I mean there are things like daggers that look like you’d find them on a cult compound, paintings of terrible monsters I don’t recognize from the limited horror media I know, and just tons of dog, and cat food despite there being no pets in the apartment, and now that I write I can hear her turning in bed so I should get back, thank you for your time, and I hope some of you can get back to me with helpful information so I can surprise her with knowledge in her passion.

I drank my usual tea with peppermint on bed and closed my curtains and my room door. Now I'm in a deep sleep. The first thing I saw are unfamiliar people. Everyone is wearing war clothes as if they are going to fight for an upcoming war. But what war? I looked in the mirror and all I can see is me wearing solider clothes. I went to the crowd and everyone  was chatting about an upcoming war in a strange language. A handsome man wearing similar solider clothes as me looked at my eyes with a worrying face as if he knows me for years. I remember what he told me. "don't kill the king but run for your life and be our queen." he said those words and then he gave me a coin. The coin had a shape but I can't see it very well because it's all dusty and old. I put it in my pocket .

"you're not coming with me?." I said while holding his hand in worry. 

"don't worry, I came to deliver my message to you and now my rule is over." he said while smiling.

 "Will I ever see you again?"  I said
" Memento...Martius."  he said
I don't know how did I remember all these conversations between me and him. 

The man dissapeared into the crowd. I can remember the floor was like a chess board. I remember me standing in the front row covering a man people call him a king. This looks exactly like a chess game. I wispeard the solider standing next to me "what is going on?" and he replied "kill the king." but a solider is weak, I can't kill the king. 
also that's weird because the two soliders I met so far would reply to me in English but all of them they speak unfamiliar language.

They soliders gave me clue that it was like a chess war but in reality, it looks like a scary big war, I got scared and I ran to hide in the tress. while I was running, I hide in the nearst bushes. next to me there was a plant, I had  to remove it away from my sight to watch if someone is coming or not. but unfortunately this plant was dangerous and it caused my hand to turn red and became itching and burning. a solider found me and he shouted to me in this strange language. I had to go back to the battle.

We all did our moves just like a chess game. the only difference between my dream and chess was instead of playing with solid pieces, we played with humans. all of my solider friends died but only me  (pawn) was left with my king vs. the opponent (king). I finally became  the queen and the opponent king was checkmated. 

I remembered the young solider words. "be our queen" and now I checked the coin the solider gave me and it appears to be made of gold and it shows EID.MAR and a cap with two daggers. 

Its strange because the coin was so dusty at first but now it appear as if it's very new.

I woke up and my dream is all over. it's 6am and its all quiet. My hand were red, burning and had blisters. a skin rash, that's weird. I opened the curtains and my hands were shaking. I felt this dream as if it was real. I checked my pocket looking for a coin. but there was nothing. I remember every detail of this dream. I opened my laptop to search for the word the man told me.

 Memento= remember,  Martius=March

I also checked of the old coin and it appears to be a real coin, a very rare and expensive one. it has a very deep ancient historical  story. I wonder what the young handsome solider was trying to tell me, and why me??
he spoke to me in Latin. and until this day I wonder, what did he mean by remember January and why did he gave me this coin in my dream? who is this man? and why did I dream this weird dream?

I was so scared that I couldn't go back to sleep. many unanswered questions. I layed down on the coach, and i closed my eyes. the next thing I hear is footsteps of many people outside. I was in shock because these footsteps sound not normal. like footsteps of horses and people running. i opened my eyes, it was not the tv, I looked from the window, the footsteps sound was still there. I opened the door and suddenly there was no more sound. The door of my house slammed closing but that didn't scare me. what really scared me was the person coming from the forest. He wore solider clothes and he kept moving from the forest and moving towards me. but then suddenly he stopped. I took the key from the vase, opened the door, and I ran inside the house. my heart is racing ; I went under the bed blanket and closed my eyes. now comes the weird part. I checked the window if that solider is still standing. he was still standing there. 

My phone rang, i answered quickly but it wasn't my best friend, it was the voice of a man breathing heavily and saying (checkmate)

I dropped the phone on the ground, and under my feet was a note saying (15 44 BCE)

I was in a state of confusion, am I still dreaming?
I kept counting my fingers and blinking again and again to see if I'm awake or still dreaming. But it was all real.

The phone rang again, but I didn't answer. i felt as if I'm being watched. 

everything is over, no sound , no solider, i was scared to hold the phone. i tried to sleep but I can't. The only option was to drive to my best friend's house.

 I told my best friend about what happened but she didn't believe me. no one will ever belIve me. i even showed her my hand but she was convinced it was a bee sting.

i looked up the internet to know what's 15 44 BCE and it meant (march 15th 44 B.C.E the assassination of Julius Caesar)

everything was real, but why me? whats the message behind reminding me of this date. I was scared and couldn't sleep for a five days. I spend a whole month staying at my best friend's home.

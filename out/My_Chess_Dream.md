I drank my usual tea with peppermint on bed and closed my curtains and my room door. Now I'm in a deep sleep. The first thing I saw are unfamiliar people. Everyone is wearing war clothes as if they are going to fight for an upcoming war. But what war? I looked in the mirror and all I can see is me wearing solider clothes. I went to the crowd and everyone  was chatting about an upcoming war in a strange language. A handsome man wearing similar solider clothes as me looked at my eyes with a worrying face as if he knows me for years. I remember what he told me. "don't kill the king but run for your life and be our queen." he said those words and then he gave me a coin. The coin had a shape but I can't see it very well because it's all dusty and old. I put it in my pocket .

"you're not coming with me?." I said while holding his hand in worry. 

"don't worry, I came to deliver my message to you and now my rule is over." he said while smiling.

 "Will I ever see you again?"  I said
" Memento...Ianuarius."  he said
I don't know how did I remember all these conversations between me and him. 

The man dissapeared into the crowd. I can remember the floor was like a chess board. I remember me standing in the front row covering a man people call him a king. This looks exactly like a chess game. I wispeard the solider standing next to me "what is going on?" and he replied "kill the king." but a solider is weak, I can't kill the king. 

We all did our moves just like a chess game. the only difference between my dream and chess was instead of playing with solid pieces, we played with humans. all of my solider friends died but only me  (pawn) was left with my king vs. the opponent (king). I finally became  the queen and the opponent king was checkmated. 

I remembered the young solider words. "be our queen" and now I checked the coin the solider gave me and it appears to be made of gold and it shows EID.MAR and a cap with two daggers. 

Its strange because the coin was so dusty at first but now it appear as if it's very new.

I woke up and my dream is all over. it's 6am and its all quiet. i looked in the mirror and my face has a scratch. I opened the curtains and my hands were shaking. I felt this dream as if it was real. I checked my pocket looking for a coin. but there was nothing. I remember every detail of this dream. I opened my laptop to search for the word the man told me.
 Memento= remember,  Ianuarius=January 
I also checked of the old coin and it appears to be a real coin, a very rare and expensive one. it has a very deep ancient historical  story. I wonder what the young handsome solider was trying to tell me, and why me??
he spoke to me in Latin. and until this day I wonder, what did he mean by remember January and why did he gave me this coin in my dream? who is this man? and why did I dream this weird dream?

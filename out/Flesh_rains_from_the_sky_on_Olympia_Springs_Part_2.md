Once I could see the ambulances vanish in the distance I pulled my old pickup around the storage units and parked it beside the church. All of the lights were off inside the church and there was no sign of the reverend. My mind bounced around between trying to find Thomas and getting the hell out of there. Thomas had been a friend though. I knew I couldn’t leave him.

My keys jingled as I unlocked the chrome cross box in the bed of my truck. It took me a few minutes of shifting all the shit inside but I found my battered shotgun pressed up against the side. A floppy cardboard box of shells sat beneath it and I grabbed a handful, shoving them into my back pockets.

As I approached the doors at the front of the church the smell that usually flowed out of the coal chute filled the air. The ammonia was enough to make me retch and the copper was so thick it was like I was sucking on a damn penny. The stench only increased as I opened the doors and stepped inside.

The low sun made everything inside the old country church look like a bad horror movie. Cobwebs fluttered in a stifling breeze. Little rays of light filtered through the smudged windows illuminating the shabby carpet and splintering pews. Dogeared Bibles flopped over the racks in front of each seat.

I’d lived in this pissant town my entire life and I managed never to enter the church. When I was a kid my mother had driven me to a little Methodist chapel out in the country. The closest I had ever been to this place was making my disgusting deliveries to that fucking coal chute.

The boards creaked under my boots and I made my way beyond the altar and toward the door beside it. My clammy hands wrapped tightly around the shot and I kept it trained in front of me just in case old Packard decided to make an appearance. I’d never liked him but now I knew he was involved in some sinister shit.

Metal on metal squealed as I pushed the door open and poked my head inside. A desk sat in the corner piled with papers and a few books. No Bible though. Kind of weird for a pastor’s office.

In the opposite corner from the desk, I could see the iron banister of a spiral staircase. Packard reminded me of some kind of underground creature and the thought of his rathole hideaway almost made me chuckle.

I probably would have if that ungodly stench hadn’t continued to get worse.

Standing at the top of the stairs, I could see dancing flickers of light bouncing off the bottom floor’s brick wall. The air that came up from the basement was hot and putrid. My eyes watered and my stomach was rolling.

As quietly as I could I started to descend the stairs but the thud of my boots was still unsettlingly loud. I winced with each footfall. If Packard was down here there was almost no way the slimy bastard hadn’t heard me coming.

The ground was slick with moisture when I finally reached the basement floor. Thick red vines clung to the walls between the dim bulbs that flickered on and off erratically. It could have been a trick of the low light but it looked like throbbing, pale moss covered most of the walls.

Moisture squished below my boots as I continued down the hall, shotgun aimed ahead. I reached a 90-degree turn in the hallway and halted as I listened for any activity. A sing-song voice drifted down the corridor to me.

It was Packard.

“Eat, my lovelies!”

A wet plop followed the scrape of metal on concrete.

“There will be more soon.”

The wet sounds of chewing followed.

“A special treat for you today, master!”

I heard Packard grunting and the sound of something heavy sliding across the concrete floor.

“Someone tried to partake in your feast! But no! Reverend Packard has brought him here to pay for his crimes! This heretic shall sustain you all!”

I turned the corner and looked down the hall. Packard was pulling Thomas’ bloated body into the middle of a room covered in the slimy, pale moss. He dropped the sagging appendages he had used to pull him by and stepped back.

The moss began to shake and three slits opened revealing huge, jagged rows of teeth. Fat, lazy tongues dropped from inside the huge mouths and slithered onto the floor toward my friend. Thin tendrils of flesh at the tip of each tongue circled Thomas’s swollen appendages and began to rip him apart.

Oozing chunks of flesh were thrown into each of the mouths on the walls before the slithering tongues returned for another bite. Thomas had screamed for a moment but the rapid blood loss had killed him almost instantly. The monstrosities in the wall made quick work of the remains.

There had never been a furnace down here to burn the meat. Packard had never destroyed any of it. He was feeding these abominations that terrible gore than fell from the sky.

I started the retch loudly as I watched the terrible things devour my friend. Reverend Packard turned toward me and smiled. Even the slithering tongues seemed to orient themselves in my direction to acknowledge me.

“Jacob?” Packard questioned with glee. “You need to go home.”

“What the hell is this?” I barked at him in my best attempt at intimidation. “What the hell are you doing?”

“Feeding the masters, of course,” he replied gesturing toward the mouths in the walls. I could now clearly see that what I had taken for moss was grotesque flesh coating the walls. “Just like you’ve been doing all these years.”

“What the fuck are they?” I stammered. My shotgun was trained on Packard but shaking so hard I thought I might drop it.

“They are the first ones,” he said matter of factly. “The first ones to consume the gift all those years ago. I serve them and so do you. If we didn’t feed them then they would consume the town.”

I pulled the trigger and watched a red spray of blood cover the fleshy wall behind Packard. The fresh blood sent the mouthes into a frenzy and their slithering tongues ripped the crazy bastard apart. It wouldn’t bring back Thomas but it was as much justice as I could manage.

After the tongues had finished devouring Packard, they slithered in my direction. I turned and ran down the hallways, almost sliding and falling on the slick floor. The slithering sound behind me was getting closer as I neared the circular stairs.

Looking over my shoulder I saw that the writhing tongues had stopped at the turn in the corridor. They jutted and strained but were able to travel no further. I felt a bit of relief as I bounded up the stairs.

When I finally reached my old pickup truck I fumbled in the bed for the two cans of gas I kept in the back. Hurriedly I ran into the sanctuary and used the first canister to cover the aisles and the pews. I held my cigarette lighter to the carpet until the blaze danced to the alter.

Making my escape outside I headed to the old coal chute. Lifting the heavy lid I tipped the final can of gas into the black hole and dropped the container in. I put the flame of my lighter to the sides of the chute and the gas ignited trailing down into the flesh put.

The tongues spasmed as the flames licked against them and I slammed to cover closed.

I didn’t stick around to watch it burn. I just hauled ass back to my truck and headed home.

The city works crew all received termination letters the following week. I haven’t heard from anyone about whether or not they knew who had destroyed the church. It’s been three months now and no meat has fallen from the sky. 

I started working for the state highway department resurfacing roads. It’s been a bit to get used to having gone from not having to do much but it pays the bills. As a bonus, I still get to work outside which I’ve always enjoyed.

Things were looking up for a while. 

Until I saw the piece of meat fall onto the pavement in front of my house.

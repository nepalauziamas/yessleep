My name is Sindy. I found this computer in the CDC. I'm typing this out on a message board that's open. I've read the last post, and I think he is dead. I may have killed him trying to come inside, searching for some medicine. Sounds foolish but with all the pharmacies being overrun by “still walkers” and looters. I had to try my luck and found a few of the “cures” the scientist talked about. If this does reach anyone in the past then you should know a few rules before I tell you about the world. At least from my standpoint. 

Still walkers either roam or stop in their tracks and stare, hoping to catch someone looking at them so they can spread the virus. They only roam when they are hungry. It is a bad idea to travel into uncivilized locations such as forest, and other clearings with no food. They are essentially zombies in those locations due to their lack of food. Here are a few rules to follow.

Rule #1: Avoid Direct Eye contact

The virus is contracted when you look at a still walkers eyes. You can use anything from glasses, goggles, binoculars, scopes or thin see through materials. Don't take these off unless the space you are in is secure. Use phone recordings to look around corners and check for any looters or still walkers if you are not sure you are alone. 

Rule #2: The mirror test

This test is to make sure you are not infected. If your pupil widens and closes at a rapid speed. You are infected and there is only a small minuscule chance you are somewhat immune so prepare yourself. If you have partners or family, have one take off their eye protection and stare at a mirror. The rest observe for any abnormality. If they are clear then have the person put on their protection and hand over the mirror to another partner and do the same. 

Rule #3: Looting 

Looting is essential to survival and very hard to do with others. If there is plenty of food then still walkers, if hungry will mind their business and eat until sated. You can safely loot anywhere around the store as long as you don't enter their space. 

Rule #4: killing still walkers

These still walkers are not tough when they are sated.  They stand in place, a quick knife to the head will kill them. If they are hungry then you have to be careful. If you have a ranged firearm then you can use it to kill them but sound is dangerous. In a later rule ill explain. 

Rule #5: The real monsters

Looters and packs of humans have grown accustomed to this life and due to sheer numbers will have most high value areas cleared. A faction in Atlanta called the blinding eye is a dangerous one. They have a few members that have a sort of resistance to the infection only losing their mental state temporarily . The faction uses these people as “hounds”. They can't get more infected but can spread it. They usually fight to take your eye protection, their main goal is to infect you so that you don't put up a fight. Then when you are taken over by said infection. They follow your still walker form to your stash and kill you there. 

Rule #6: Sound

This is pretty simple, try to not make as much sound. Gunshots and tool sounds are a signal to others. You have gear.

Rule #7: camouflage 

This is a dangerous rule. But it's helped me overcome some tight spots. If you ditch your eye protection and stand still like them. No one can tell you apart. This is a double edged sword, if you stand in front of a skin walker or a “hound”. You are one of them now.

I think the infection only got this far because people were caught unaware. The infection is very easy to avoid but by the time anyone figured out the truth. It was too late. Remember these rules. I'm picking up my pack and moving our base here. I will have them tell you stories about their experiences, it could be therapeutic. I'll submit this and end on the same note each time. Beware of widened eyes.

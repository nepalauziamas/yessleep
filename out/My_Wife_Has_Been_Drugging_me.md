[Here's the previous story for anyone who missed it.](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/uvy52b/i_got_a_call_from_my_dead_daughter/)

“I’m writing this with the last drop of sanity that I left. Last time I spoke to you guys I had thought of taking my wife Irene in for a psych evaluation, However, today something weird happened. I saw her putting the pills that the hospital gave me for her headaches into my food. What the fuck?! I thought she stopped taking those meds years ago, I don’t think she was ever taking them, I think she's been dosing my food to drive me to insanity. I’m not such a tech guy but I found this application online that records any conversation, converts it into a transcript and emails it to whoever you want. I have given my password to the only friend I trust and have told him to upload the exact transcript to Reddit as an update and a goodbye to you guys if anything happens to me when I confront her”.

P1: Irene, how long have you  been drugging my food?

.

P2: Drugging? Oh you mean your antipsychotics?

.

P1: My antipsychotics STOP LYING TO ME, WHAT HAVE YOU BEEN PUTTING IN MY FOOD

.

P2: Honey, you need to calm down. You have Schizophrenia. The medicine I put in your food is to help with that.

.

P1: You’re lyingI took care of you for 10 years. Our daughter died. You were in a car crash don’t you remember?

.

P2: Honey, we never had a daughter, and I’m sick of hearing about this Maya for the past 10 years. Yes, I did have an accident and I was in the hospital,  but there was no Maya. You told the cops and the nurses about her but there was no one. 

.

P1: No you’re lying you know how I know because she told me She called and told me you killed her. 

.

P2: Wait, what? Repeat that to yourself, do you think it makes any sense? Your so-called dead daughter, who I apparently killed, called you and told you that? Listen I’m trying to help you, but you need to trust me

.

P1: Trust you? you’re hiding something, I’m perfectly sane and you can't make me think otherwise

.

P2: Sane? Like a couple nights ago, when you thought the devil was in our house?

.

P1: I heard you, you kept saying sold her soul, sold her soul. 

.

P2: Honey, I wasn't home, I left an attendant here with you remember? She called me and told me you keep talking to thin air.

.

P1: no no no no no you’re lying. 

P3: evr thng alright Ie….

.

P1: Who was that?!

.

P2: its nothing, you’re hearing things again

.

P1: What are you doing with a radio?

.

P2: Fuck! The pill, I can't believe I forgot

.

P2: Hey, Jason, I’m gonna need some help in here

.

P3: On my way…

.

P1: Who the hell is Ja OW, what the fuck did you inject me with

.

P1: I’m gonna fucking……get outta……I feel…..,what did you give me….

.

P3: Jesus Christ Irene, you forgot to give him today's dose didn’t you. You know how dangerous that is? What if he finds out we’ve been experimenting on him with this new drug. 

.

P1: Experiments, that's what they did to my mates in the war, those god damn nazis.

.

P3: Christ, you were never in the war. Just be careful Irene, you don’t want to have to kill another am I right, once is enough. 

.

P2: two you mean

.

.

. Battery LOW….

.

.

P3: Right sorry, forgot about that Maya girl. I mean she was onto you, there's nothing you could have done. The only thing you could have done was kill both of them and start again with him. It was smart you know, so called accident happens, woman survives but doesn't remember anything. I mean she didn’t survive but it was the perfect cover up to help you infiltrate. Shit, was I not supposed to say that?

.

P1: Maya…

.

P2: Don’t worry about it, he’ll forget soon enough. It’ll be straight back to the fantasy he’s been living in. I’m almost done with him anyway, I have more than enough data, I’ll kill him soon. 

P3: Alright, I’ll leave you to it, just be more careful now.

.

. Battery LOW….

.

.

.

P3: Oh, you should take that face off sometimes, I miss seeing the real you, Ada, you’ve had that face on for so long that you’re starting to think you’re actually Irene.

.

.

. Battery LOW….

.

.

P2: Leave Jason, you worry about your own experiments, oh and fix your face, it's peeling off.

.

P3: Alright Alrig….

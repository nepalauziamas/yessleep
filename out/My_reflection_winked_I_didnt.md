Don't know how much time I have; I'll keep it short.

T'was late-night. I was chilling in the bathroom reading, just as we all do. It was all well and splendid, until something caught my eye. 

My eyes flickered around, then came to a rest on the mirror. There, in the slivery frame, was the unmistakable figure of my reflection. 

Wtf? My heart raced as I scrambled to get my pants on and I leapt toward the mirror.

There it was, clear as day. Staring at me through the cool mirror-glass. My reflection.

It said something, but I couldn't hear. 

"...I can't hear you." I felt weird speaking aloud, but what else could I do?

It slapped a palm to its face, then left for a moment. I sank down on the vanity top, trying to convince myself that I wasn't going crazy. I could call someone, sure, but who would believe me? 

My reflection was back, having returned with paper and marker. Too stunned to speak, I ran to grab my own. On my way back, I grabbed a camera, just in case.

When I returned, it already had a messaged written.

**Hello.** It winked at me, smiling.

*Hi.*

It noticed the camera.

**Uh, could you not? Camera shy. Sorry**

*Sorry!*

**So you're Kat? The real one!**

*...yes, and who are you?*

**Your reflection! ;)**

*...you got a name, reflection?*

**Nope.**

*and you don't speak?*

**reflections don't talk, silly! ;)**

We "talked" for a bit, they seemed nice. Then, out of the blue:

**Hey, what's your world like? Can I see??**

*Yeah? Sure! How tho*

**Gimme a sec.**

She disappeared past the frame. I waited a while, and then she returned with a hammer.

**You might wanna stand back.**

I took a generous leap back. She swung the hammer, and the glass shattered.

My reflection climbed through, paper in hand. She handed the paper to me, still grinning.

**Oh Kat, how I've waited for this day. 

...to be honest, I quite envy you. You get to enjoy this happy life of free will, but I'm stuck here having to do whatever you want! Finally, I'm free!

...why I didn't do this earlier? I needed to be invited, see? And your confirmation was just what I needed.**

She winked again, her smile sickly sweet.

**...but there can't be two of us, can there?**

She looked at me expectantly, hammer in hand.

**Sorry.**

I took that as my cue to leave, and took off running out the door and down the stairs. I skidded through the living room to the front door, where I realised I left my keys upstairs. Drat.

Too late- she was already halfway down the stairs. 

I ran into the storeroom and locked the door behind me. So here I am now. I don't know what to do- she has a weapon and I'm absolute shit at fighting.

She's coming nearer- I don't have anywhere to go. Help! If anyone can get here, I'm at 13 Elmnhfdfjhfkafghhjii9‚Å∞

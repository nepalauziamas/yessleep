It was Amanda. She was hanging there, stripped completely naked with her mouth duct taped and her wrists tied behind her back. I retched and had to cover my mouth. Mara and Kendrick came running over. What’s going—“ she cut off abruptly to scream. 

Kendrick exclaimed “Dear God”, before also retching. “Dude we gotta get out of here!”

“What about her”, Mara cried, “We can’t just leave her here.”

“Better her than us!”

“What about Shauna?”

“Shauna”, Kendrick exclaimed, “*That’s* what you’re worried about? Look at Amanda. And didn’t you say that it was one of her little witch symbols on her sleeping bag? Look, I hate to say it, but I’m starting to think Tod might’ve been right. Either way, That’s gonna be us if we don’t get the fuck outta—“

“Guys, shut up”, I snapped, cutting him off. “You hear that?” It was faint, but I could hear something rustling in the trees around us. It was quick, whatever it was, and it sounded like it was darting back and forth from one tree to the next. 

“What, what is it”, Mara asked nervously.

“It’s coming from over there.” I pointed to the woods at our right. I could hear it again, seeming to close in from all around us. 

“Yeah I hear it too”, Kendrick said, shaking. “Come *on*, we gotta get outta here.”

“What about Amanda”, Mara asked, “We can’t just *leave* her here. And what about Shauna, she’s still—“

“What about *US*? Look, let’s get out of here. We can get help or something, just *PLEASE* can we go?”

“Alright, here’s what we’re gonna do”, I said, tossing Kendrick the keys to the minivan. The sounds were getting closer. “Mara, you and Kendrick head back to the van. As soon as you get down the mountain, find the police and have them send somebody out here.”

“What about you?”

“I’m gonna see if I can find Shauna.” Her eyes bugged out. “Look, I’ll be fine, just go.” 

I could tell she was about to try and protest, but Kendrick took her by the hand and began leading her back towards the entrance of the trail. The rustling was so close now that it felt like it was right on top of me. “Shauna”, I called out into the trees, “Shauna, is that you?”

Nothing. Just rustling, zipping from tree to tree all around me. That was when a shiver dropped down my spine, realizing it wasn’t just one thing or person in the woods. I was surrounded, and I couldn’t move. I noticed though, that right as they’d be right on me, where I’d actually be able to see them, they stopped and began sort of zipping around me instead of towards me. *”They’re circling me!”*

“Who’s there”, I finally managed to shout. There was no response and the sounds stopped. “Who are you, what do you want?” 

Silence. Having finally worked up enough courage to move, I very slowly stepped forward. “Who are you? What do you want with me and my friends?” I took another step forward, and another, slowly advancing to another of the trees behind the one Amanda was hanging from. “Why did you—“

I was cut off when I saw something shoot out from behind the tree and snag my throat, instantly tightening and suffocating me. I clawed frantically at it, but it was no use. The knot tightened around my throat as I felt myself being pulled towards the tree by it. I stumbled and fell, causing me to be dragged on my stomach to the tree.

My vision started clouding with every second the knot was around my throat, forcing the air right out of me. The last thing I saw was a figure step out from behind the tree, holding the other end of the rope, pulling it taut. The figure looked like a man, buck-ass nude and muscular, with a black executioner’s hood over his face and what looked like a noose around his own neck, dangling like a necklace.

This made me eyes go even bigger, not just from strangulation, but from pure terror. It was “The Hangman”! He was real! 

I would’ve screamed, had the noose not been choking me. As it was, I let out a strained wheezing before my vision went completely dark. Being perfectly honest, I actually thought I’d died right then and there.  

This was quickly thrown out the window when I awoke to what felt like a hot piece of metal being pressed into my side. I groaned in pain as my vision strained back to normal. Directly in front of me was a giant, bright orange light and I felt an immense heat blasting my face.

Looking down, I saw that I was naked with my wrists tied and hoisted above my head. Just above my left hip was a pentagram in the shape of a goat branded into my skin with that symbol from before on Amanda’s sleeping bag above it. I looked up to see more of them gathered around me; all nude with hoods over their faces and wearing noose necklaces. “Who are you”, I cried out weakly.

For a moment, they all just stood there, silently glaring at me through their hoods. Finally, one of them shouted, “In the name of The Hangman, Edmund Draco, God’s destroyer of the wicked and instrument of righteousness, we continue his good work by cleansing the Earth of vile creatures like you!”

“What?! What are you talking about?! Who is “Edmund Draco?!” My mind went back to what Shauna told me about “The Hangman” legend, how apparently he was once a witch hunter named “Draco”. *”Was this the same guy?”*

Then I remembered what she said about a crazy cult that lurked through these woods, snatching people they see as witches and killing them. “What do you want with me? I didn’t do anything, I’m not even a witch!”

“Aye”, said another voice, this one sounding like a young woman, “but Ye consort with a witch. Ye be in league with one a’ Lucifer’s whores!”

“What are you even talking about? I’m an *Atheist*! I don’t believe in *any* of that shit!” I heard a shocked gasp pass through the crowd. “Look, this fucking insane! Let me go!”

“You hear that”, called another, younger voice, this one sounding familiar. Too familiar. “He denounces God. He, of his own will, has testified to rejecting Christ. He’s in league with a witch, and thus, his soul is just as tainted! He must be cleansed!”

My eyes almost shot from my head. *”No... that isn’t...”* 

“Tod?!”

He then pulled off his hood, revealing his smirking face, still looking as devious as ever. My heart stopped abruptly. “What’re you—“

“Doing the lord’s work. We are ridding the land of the wickedness of witchcraft, just as he, The Great Hangman, did long ago!” He then gestured to the bonfire in front of me, the skeletal scarecrow from before looming down from behind the blaze. “We continue his good work!”

“You’re *insane!*”, I screamed at him, “You all are! You murdered Amanda, your *GIRLFRIEND!*”

His face instantly dropped his triumphant smirk and became cold, bitter. “Ex-girlfriend. Remember? She chose, like you, to side with the Devil! *HE’S* to blame, with his harlot familiar! *She* is responsible for her death!”

I started struggling, to no use. The rope tied around my wrists was tight, to the point where I began loosing feeling in them. “You do know there are people who’re gonna come looking for me, right? They’ll see what you’ve done, find all of you, and lock you up for life!”

His demented grin almost immediately returned full blast. “Oh really? And who would that be?” He then pointed towards the crowd to two of them dragging long ropes behind them. My blood was chilled once again when, coming towards the light of the bonfire, I saw that they were dragging the frightened and struggling bodies of Mara and Kendrick. 

“You mean them”, he chided, “others who’ve sided against God? You looked to *them* for aid?” He chuckled deviously before saying, “and that is why you have no hope. You have turned from the lord and embraced sinfulness! Thus, the lot of you must face the judgment of The Hangman!”

The two men then dragged Kendrick, who was wheezing intensely and clawing at the rope, in front of the fire. I started feebly struggling again. “Don’t you fuckin’ touch him, you freak!” 

He paid no attention. I watched as the two figures then forced him up to his feet in front of Tod, his body hanging limply in their arms. “Kendrick Ulrich”, Tod declared, his voice somehow starting to deepen, “You stand accused of consorting with a witch and being in league with servants of evil! How do you plead?”

To this, the crowd chanted “Guilty” in unison. Kendrick himself said nothing, only coughing and gasping for air like a hooked fish. “Guilty”, Tod declared, “You have been found guilty in the eyes of The Hangman for consorting with the devil! You attempt to play with fire, sell your soul to fire, and therefore”, he pointed to the bonfire, “it is by fire you must be cleansed!”

The two men began dragging Kendrick to the bonfire and tying the other end to a tree branch that hung above it. Kendrick tried squirming again, but the men were strong, clutching him with an iron vice grip. They then, after tying his hands behind his back, hoisted his body by the throat and dropped him to dangle over the flames. 

I could only watch, breathless and petrified, as my friend was slowly barbecued over the bonfire, dangling by his neck. He was engulfed by the flames in less than seconds. I still hear the screams— if you could even call it that— he made as he burned alive. It didn’t sound natural or even human at all, like if you mixed the whistling sound a tea kettle makes with the yowling of a cat, that’s what it sounded like. 

Through it all, Tod just watched with a grin on his face.  I felt my own body go limp with terror as Kendrick’s screams died with the rest of him. “You’re a *FREAK*, Tod”, I cried out in rage. “You’re an *ANIMAL!*”

He didn’t acknowledge me, instead instructing the two men dragging Mara along to bring her to the fire like with Kendrick. This sent my heart racing again. “No! Mara! Let her go!”

“Mara Edwards, You stand accused of consorting with a witch and being in league with servants of evil! How do you plead?”

Like with Kendrick, the crowd roared again, “Guilty!” I tried to yank my arms down from over my head with all the strength I had. Still, my hands weren’t going anywhere. Mara looked up at him, a look of hatred in her eyes, and spat in his face. “Go to Hell!”

Tod, his face enraged again, delivered a swift swipe across her left cheek. “You spit in my face”, he roared, “To Hell is where I will *personally* send you, back to where you belong, *SLUT*!” 

He jerked her by the rope around her neck over to the fire and tied her hands behind her back. “Mara”, I cried. “Mara!”

She looked up at me as Tod was tying the other end around the branch, readying to drop her into the fire. Her eyes were wide and sad and I saw her open her mouth, just faintly hearing her whisper “I love you Patrick”, before she was dropped over the flames.

I screamed and howled until my vocal chords essentially ripped open as Mara burned. It took even longer for her to die than Kendrick, forcing me to have to listen and watch even longer as she suffered. Eventually, it was silent again.

I hung limply in my restraints again. I had nothing left, no strength, no motivation, no *will* to try and fight anymore. This was it, I was next, and there wasn’t a damn thing I could do about it. I felt myself get jerked forward toward the fire by the rope around my neck. 

Tod began his speech again, “Patrick Reid, you stand accused of—“

“Freeze”, called a voice from the trees to my right. Tod and the crowd all snapped their heads in the direction of the voice. I looked over and immediately went slack jawed. It was the police! *”But how?”*

Tod looked just as baffled as me. The crowd slowly began backing away from that area of the woods. “All of you, on the ground, hands behind your heads,” the officer ordered, pistol trained at Tod. More officers then began emerging from the woods, guns drawn and aimed at the crowd.

No one made a move. They stood silently as the officers moved in closer. “They are the Devil’s servants”, Tod shouted, “They, too, have sided with the evil one!” He then pointed at the officer and declared “Seize them for judgement!”

The crowd went berserk again and leapt for the officers. Instantly, the sounds of gunshots filled the air and at least ten of them, including Tod himself, dropped dead. Seeing this, the remainder of them fled into the trees left of me, disappearing from sight almost immediately. 

The officers then moved into the area, covering it, with a few heading further in after the others who got away. I was speechless, baffled, awed. I was locked in a state of shock. I was alive!

I was just seconds away from being burned alive like my friends, but I was alive! I’d been saved! But the question then came back to me; *“How?”*

Where had they come from? Who called them? And how did they find me, deep in the woods?

While one of the officers was cutting me free, I asked him. “We got an anonymous call from someone who said they were a friend of yours”, he replied. “Apparently, they’d seen your little pal here dragging and hanging a girl’s body to a tree a little ways back. When we found the body, we were able to follow the racket going on leading here.”

*”Anonymous call?”* It didn’t take long before it hit me; *”Shauna! She’s still alive!”*

They led me out of the trail and back to my van. Sure enough, there was Shauna, waiting by the van with two other officers. She ran up and quickly snatched me into a bear hug. “Are you okay? I’m sorry I ran off like that, but I didn’t feel right. And when I saw later what Tod did...,” she stopped and looked around, “where’re the others?”

I gave her a grim expression, being two seconds from bursting into tears, and turned my head to the entrance of the trail. I didn’t need to say anything, she understood enough to immediately start tearing up herself. What I *did* manage to choke out was “Thank you.”

“Of course. You’re my friend and you always stood up for me. I just wished I could’ve been quicker with it. Maybe then...” She trailed off, looking towards the trail again. After that, Shauna hugged me tight before being escorted away by a police officer as the ambulance showed up and checked me out. Once that was all over with, I was finally allowed to go home, a couple of police cars following as escorts back to my house.

To say I didn’t sleep well that night is a *grave* understatement, and it’s not gotten any better since. I haven’t really felt comfortable leaving my house, save for the quick grocery run I made two days ago. I feel afraid to be around people now after what happened. 

I still kept occasional contact with Shauna.  It was actually her who convinced me to write this, both for comfort as well as a warning. See, it was about a week after this all happened that she texted me pictures of her grandmother’s old journal (apparently, she kept it for documenting her trips). In them, she actually has a detailed history of Grenview Pines — which, of course, would include, among a bunch of other, far more bizarre ghost stories — “The trail of the hanged whores”.

I spent hours reading, more or less, the same thing she’d told me about before. Back in the witch trials, Edmund Draco was a proclaimed “expert witch hunter” who’s M.O. was “the cleansing of the Earth from the plague of witchcraft”, to quote text. He was known to perform public executions in those woods where he’d drag “the devil’s whores”, as he constantly referred to them, and hang them over a blazing fire.

The text further explains that he had managed to amass his own little group of witch hunters who basically all but worshipped the guy and followed his every command. Eventually, it’s said that Draco managed to finally meet his match when he executed the head of a particular coven (I think they’re called the “Violet Sisterhood”, maybe. I can’t really remember), and the others managed to exact revenge by killing him one night in his sleep. 

It was said, though, that the Hangman’s spirit became tethered to the land, forever linked to that trail where he executed witches, forever bound to continuing his task and leading his ever-expanding cult in delivering the Earth from wickedness. Well, that’s what the journal said anyway. And clearly, Shauna and her grandmother weren’t the only ones who believed the legend.

Personally, I still don’t believe in the “Hangman’s ghost” or any shit like that. But, I do believe one thing; the second strongest fear, next to the unknown, is the power of belief. Belief, like what drove Shauna to run away that day, or like how people like Tod to devoted themselves to this supposed “mission of righteousness”. The power of belief is a power that should never be underestimated.

I also believe that a book should never be judged by its cover. Corny, I know, but I can’t lie and say that it doesn’t apply here. I’d known Tod (or THOUGHT I did) since high school. In all that time, I never once thought that he’d do the things he did. And with Grenview Pines itself, an absolutely beautiful place, I wouldn’t have thought that such horrible things happened and STILL happen there. At the same time, where he and Kendrick were quick to assume the worst from Shauna because she was Wiccan, she was the one who saved my life.

The last thing I’ll say is this; I believe in one other thing. They’re still out there, in the woods of Grenview Pines, still seeking to “rid the land of the wickedness of witchcraft, just as he, The Great Hangman, did long ago!”

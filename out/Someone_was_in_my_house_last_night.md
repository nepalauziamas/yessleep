So I’m pretty new to this but I’m assuming this is the sub where people go to explain the weird and startling things that occur to them right? I hope so because I really need some insight into a disturbing problem I keep having..

For several years I’ve been able to see, feel, and hear things that aren’t exactly digestible for your average Joe. I don’t feel comfortable saying something silly like “I’ve always been open to ghosts and they try to talk to me.” Or my personal favorite “I’ve been sensitive to the paranormal for as long as I can remember.” Lol. But you get the jest. 

Anyway, I live with my husband in a decent suburban home, tight nit neighbors and all that. We have loads of people walking or running around the trails, fishing in the pond nearby, or just biking around the block. It’s not uncommon to see several of your neighbors out and about.

One night of no special occasion I’m finishing my bedtime routine when I head towards the kitchen for a glass of water. The way our home is laid out, the long entry hallway is right in-between the kitchen and master bedroom so I walk past our glass front door all day moving from room to room. I’ve caught myself always glancing out the glass pane and checking the street to just see whats going on outside as I walk by. This time however I notice something different. 

A man is standing in the street, not walking or biking or talking to anyone, just standing there. Parallel with my front door. Not only is he just standing there not moving, he’s statuesque, blending in almost. If I hadn’t been looking for something out of the ordinary I wouldn’t have seen him. The strange part is he isn’t just standing still, he’s looking at me. Not at my front door but directly, painfully and obviously at me. His stare is so intense I drop my glass of water and in a panic, I reach down to clean up my mess. At this time my husband bolts to action by my side questioning if I’m okay and what happened? I didn’t want to worry him so I said “Oh I’m such a shithead you know me always breaking things.” His response? “This is why we can’t have nice things.” A knowing smirk on his face lets me know its just a little joke we say when the other has made a mistake or made a mess of something. I let out a giggle and smack his shoulder “I’ll grab the broom if you get some paper towels?” He obliged and we head to the bedroom.


I know what you’re thinking, “Why wouldn’t you tell the truth dumb ass??” Well I don’t want to bore you with our history but lets say, I’ve had a history of a particular person showing up to my home frequently and without invitation in the past. My husband is quiet protective and would have absolutely called the police and sprang to my rescue. “What the hell is wrong with that??” You say? Sometimes I can’t tell if the things I see are human or not, do with that what you will. If something isn’t alarming to me I avoid causing it further attention. Leave the poor cranky spirits alone they don’t have anything better to do.

Fast forward a few days and once again I’m finishing my bedtime routine. I slide my soft fuzzy slippers off and roll into bed. Obsessed with clean sheets and finding a cold spot for my feet I waller around and get cozy. It never takes long for me to fall asleep when I’m actively trying to fall asleep. A few sheep jumping across my eyelids and I was out for good.


A loud crash wakes me abruptly from my sleep. My eyes flash open, before I have the opportunity to glance around the room I notice there’s someone standing in front of me. There’s a man standing in front if me who isn’t my husband.

Fear. Gut wrenching, frozen in place, heart attack inducing fear impales me. I. Can. Not. Move. Who the fuck? Why.. what is this?? HELP!!! I’m screaming at the top of my lungs.. but only inside my mind. My actual mouth is firmly stitched shut. I can’t do anything except stare. The man inches closer, and closer and FUCKING CLOSER. 

He is now right in front of me and slowly, time reverses and plays forward as I still can’t move or do anything and he bends toward my face. HELLLLPPPP!!! 

I try screaming again but he same happens, I’m still frozen in my own fear. The face of the man is now visible, I can clearly see who he is, the man who was standing in the street a few days earlier. The man who had visited my home everyday for the last 4 days. The man I had desperately tried so hard to avoid, was in my house staring at me.

He opens his mouth to speak: “You’ve been avoiding me Lauren.” I say nothing, completely on the verge of full blown cardiac arrest. Heart palpitations increasing with every second that passes.  “I’ve been trying to speak with you about an increasingly important topic.” He replies to his own statement and backs away from the bed I’m still laying in.” 

Just then the beautiful angel that is my husband rushes into the bedroom, pure confusion crushed onto his brow, I watch as he’s assessing the room. Then, like the snap of a finger his confused expression shifts to anger. “Finally” I think to myself “Save me you beautiful asshole!”

My husband reaches for the strange man and .. .. shakes his hand..? ? ?

“Lauren why didn’t you tell me this guy was coming around practically stalking you??” 

I’m still in a state of shock/fear and can’t properly enunciate words. 

“You thought you’d keep his offer a secret from me? Do you have any idea how long I’ve been wanting

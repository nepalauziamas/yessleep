 It was a hike up a local mountain one weekend for closure. My mother had died only a few weeks before and it was her favorite mountain she ever climbed so I wanted to climb it too.

We used to go all across the Tetons and the Rockies, she would be scaling each and every summit you can imagine. But this one, she said, was special. 

The climb itself wasn’t very high, only about two thousand four hundred feet or so, what made it difficult was that the top of it extended high above the base like a spire, there were no trails or prebuilt ways to traverse it except for a few climbing clips left by previous climbers.

When I first got to the bottom of the sheer edge of the cliff I saw something strange. There was a decently large divot like something was dropped from the top.

Normally when you see something like this it’s a rock and you can plainly see either the whole rock in the middle or the chunks of rock that shot every which way when it hit the ground but no, none of that, just a crater in the ground a few feet from the cliff.

I chose to ignore it and began my climb, not realizing it meant anything of significance. I remember almost falling a few times, the cliff was extremely flat. In fact, at some points, there were barely any outcrops to grab onto. Despite all the different places I have been, this was easily the hardest climb I’d ever done. It was exhilarating. This had to be why mom loved it so much. 

Then, I got to the top. All that adrenaline all of the sudden gone. The top part was a circle, about a mile large but covered with thick forest so even though it was quite small you could not see from end to end.

I let out her ashes right at sunset. 

There was a semi-large clearing on top where I set up my camp and stayed for the night. 

I woke up in the middle of my sleep. It was the summer in rural Alaska so there was a faint midnight sun around, adjusting the regular pitch black of the night forest to a twilight.

After several minutes my ears were in tune to the thing that woke me up, a faint howling that sounded like it was coming from the other side of the top.

I listened for a few minutes, my ears perking up and alert, my heart thumping into my chest. The howls echoed around the mountain for a few more minutes before dying down again, like some kind of demonic siren.

This was exactly what mom had described, but still hearing it for the first time it was eerie and haunting. 

I blew down the embers of my fire and wrapped my blankets tighter so I could sleep, but just as I lay on my hastily-made tent, the howling started up again.

More incessant this time, like a lost pup that was whining for its mother. It reminded me of the pain that often went through my body in the lonely hours. 

The twilight had quickly passed, leaving the sky dark with a faint rainbow of an aurora borealis. The stars had come out, and a wind was whistling through my hair. Was that the howl? No it sounded too alive to merely be the wind. A full moon shone down on me, bright, but also tinted a violent crimson. Something about it felt different. 

It was a beautiful night, and would’ve been an amazing one if not for that howling that kept on shattering my thoughts. It was creeping closer and growing louder. Making me uneasy now as I tried to figure out what it could be. Mom had never described it like this. 

I gave up on sleep, my thoughts kept turning to whatever was howling on the other side. Could it be lost? Or hungry. Or angry. Yes, I thought. That was what I was feeling. This howl was one filled with rage. 

So I picked up some branches and tied them together and lit them on fire with my cigarette lighter. I looked toward the forest and the blistering cold as the howls seemed to surround me. 

I didn’t feel safe there anymore, so I began the trek to the other side of the mountain. 

The path on the other side was lined with thick trees and bushes, but it was surprisingly paved and well-kept. On the other end I saw a rough cave hacked out of rock. Something delicious was wafting out of it and after my meagre dinner of a few biscuits, my mouth watered.

I peered into the cave and saw a fire in the middle, casting wild shadows on the walls. An iron was suspended over the flames, swinging slowly from left to right. Beneath the embers was a few fillets of some sort of meat.

There was also a figure with its back facing me.

I froze, shocked to see that anyone else might be here on the mountain. Mom had said no one ever climbed it. 

It did not turn around, but I realised it was a lady with a black shawl over their head, making it impossible for me to see most of their face. 

I caught a glimpse of a smile as I realized she saw me, and before I could back away, she gestured for me to sit down and I did. I couldn’t take my eyes off the fire. It felt surreal to be there. 

She handed me a bowl of soup, and I took it—and it tasted so \*good\*. Just like the kind that mom used to make. Every drop of flavour was extracted from those bones, and it had a hint of sage and parsley and thyme.

“Thank you,” I told her. The woman didn’t respond and I kept staring into the fire. 

All of this felt like a dream as I heard the howls grow louder outside the cave. Like a roaring hurricane. 

I was dying to know what they were and for some reason I asked this stranger. Somehow I knew she had the answer. 

She smiled at me again— this time a toothless smile—and tugged me toward her,  to come closer. Up close I could see a tattoo on her forehead. A triangle with a red eye in the centre. It looked like she had made the markings herself, cut into her flesh to form this permanent scar. 

She did not have a face or nose, both seemed to be closed shut by other scars. 

Her voice was as soft as a breath of wind.

“\*The Morrighan is Angry tonight.\*”

“Wha…what is that…” 

The old woman wouldn’t answer my question, but instead smiled again and put a finger to her lips. The triangle on her forehead seemed to grow larger, encapsulating her face. The red eye glared at me and I saw… 

“You know the answer…”

Frustrated, I threw down the bowl and stormed outside to the ever-increasing howls. Then I realised why the howls were growing louder. Why they were roaring in my ears, louder than the ocean.

Transfixed by the red moon were three wolves. Their eyes wouldn’t leave the night sky. They were shaking like a leaf, and up close, I realised what had been bothering me about those howls.

They were intended to fill me with terror. They were searching for something, aware of my presence, I realized as they began to move down the base of the mountain toward the woods. 

They were forming a small pack, preparing to hunt. I turned back to the cave to warn the strange woman, but the entire rock face had vanished. I was alone now on this mountain, and the wolves were hunting me. 

Their howls got louder as they started to run toward me and I acted on pure instinct, grabbing my things and running toward the cliffs to begin climbing down. I could possibly lose them in the path below, I thought as I started to amble down the rock side. 

The howls were so loud, so intense that I couldn’t figure out where the wolves were at. Every once in a while I could see them snapping their jaws toward me, trying to grab at me like I was their next meal. 

My foot twisted and I fell and started to fall down into a steep canyon. The wolves followed. 

Their gleaming red eyes turned toward me as they covered the only way out of the canyon and I tried to push myself up, desperate to fight. 

Their howls made my ears burn as the wolves started to slowly advance and I searched for a rock or something to try and protect myself. 

As they howled louder, it seemed as though the wolves were meshing together; forming a single creature of pure unfiltered wrath. It was towering over me, snarling and snapping it’s massive mangled jaws as it loomed closer. 

Then I heard a single word amid the twisted flesh. It had the mouth of a man and spoke to me. 

“Confesssssss…” it howled as its massive claws ripped across my stomach. 

I fell backwards, the blood spewing from my body as I screamed and looked past the massive wolf. The woman was there at the top of the canyon, her eyes filled with sadness and anger. Disappointment. 

This time her face showed me exactly what I thought I saw. My mother. 

The wolf grabbed at my leg and I kicked and flailed, screaming to the moon what I had done. 

“I killed her!!! I killed my own mother!! Please!!! Please have mercy!” I shrieked. 

The entire mountain felt like it was howling. It shook and I closed my eyes, prepared to die for my sins. 

Then the howling stopped and the air was still. 

Slowly I opened my eyes, blood dripping down my forehead as I saw the shadows of the beast slinking off into the woods. 

I saw my mother standing above me at the threshold of the mountain. 

“I’m sorry,” I pleaded to her as I recalled all the times I had neglected her before she died. I had grown tired of seeing her sick. This was my fault now, my sins needed to be paid for. 

She was standing over me, the gleaming red eye judging me. Then she reached down and touched my scars. 

“I forgive you,” she whispered. 

Then she faded into the howls of the wind. 

I climbed down the rest of the way alone, grieving my sins and the mother that loved me no matter what I did to her.

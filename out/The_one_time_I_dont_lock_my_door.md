The one time I don’t lock my Damn door…


My bedroom is in the garage of my house because it it parents have four doors and wanted us each to have a room so our once three bedroom condo has been turned into a five bedroom condo. They built a wall about three quarters through the garage so I didn’t have to be right up against the garage door. On the wall they built they put in a door. 

I almost always had this door locked especially at night time because I convinced myself that something bad was going to happen if I didn’t. After about a year of me doing this my mom convinced me nothing was going to happen so one night I told myself I was not going to lock my door. 

I usually sleep facing my wall, without fail tonight I did this again. But on this particular night I felt like someone was watching me I scared myself into a cold sweat, I didn’t even want to turn around to see if my paranoia was right.. I fell asleep for about half an hour after staying awake until 11:00p.m. I heard a loud bang coming from the garage part of my room. It sounded like someone was trying to pry open my garage door to get into my room. 

I tried and tried to convince myself it was nothing, that I was just super paranoid about nothing. I decided to get out of my bed to fill up my water bottle and make myself feel better. I go upstairs, fill it up and dreadfully go back downstairs. I went into my room turned on the light and decided to make myself feel better by checking the garage. I thought “there will be nothing their so I’ll feel better”. 

I go over to the door leading to the actual garage and there was a tall shadowy figure lit up by just the streetlight. I froze. The man stood their saying absolutely nothing and not moving an inch. I finally get the balls to speak and say “what the fuck are you doi-“ the man runs down the street. I was almost glad he ran away because I would not been able to defend myself as a five foot tall small built teen. 

I slept in my brothers room because I didn’t feel safe sleeping in my own. 
Let’s just say from then on I kept my door locked no matter what anyone said. 

I only told my brother what happened. I didn’t want to tell anyone else what happened because they definitely would have not believed me but I had a super close relationship with my brother and he listened to and believed whatever I told him, no matter what’s I did I seemed to be the least credible person just by default. My brother believed me. 

The next day after that happened we went to Investigate the garage and we found a bag around the side of our house I opened up the bag while my brother watched. When I slid open the zipper I saw gloves when I took out the gloves I felt something sharp cut my hand. My hand was bleeding and I shined my phone flashlight in the bag. There was a large knife.. I could’ve only imagined what would’ve happened I wouldn’t have went to investigate the garage. I felt so sick I almost threw up.

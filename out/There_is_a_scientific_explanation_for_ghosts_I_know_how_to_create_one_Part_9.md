I lay on the floor until morning, when I heard Grandpa’s voice approaching from the hall. 

“Lacey? Why is the door open? I was sure I locked it. Hm. Getting absent-minded in my old age. Lacey? . . . Oh my God!”

I heard his footsteps running over to me. “Lacey, what happened?” he asked. “Look at this mattress, it's so old, it's falling apart. We'll have to get you a new one.”

He flipped over the mattress so I was lying on my back, still strapped to it.

“What happened? Did you try to escape? Silly girl.”

I wanted to kill him. But as he removed the mouthguard, I resolved to say what I’d practiced saying in my head since Walters had retreated. I spoke very deliberately. “I had a little accident last night. But I'm not seeing ghosts anymore. I'm better now. I'd very much like to go home.”

Grandpa chuckled to himself as he started to loosen my restraints. “Oh, Lacey. Sweetheart. Nice try. Listen. I feel a responsibility to cure you, and I'm going to do it. But we're still a long way off.”

I just stared stoically at the ceiling. There had to be a way out of here. There just had to be.

Then it hit me: Dad. Somehow, I had to contact Dad.

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

Cell phone technology was different back then. For one thing, my Nokia 5110 had a little antenna. And I thought if I could boost the power of that antenna, I might actually pick up a signal.

So I found a rake and some wire. I clipped the wire to the metal part of the rake, then bent the tines in opposite directions. I wound the wire around the handle of the rake, then connected the other end to the antenna on my phone, which I’d stripped of its rubber coating.

Then I opened my bedroom window just enough to slide the rake outside, moving it around, watching the stubborn “No Service” message on my cell phone’s screen.

All of a sudden, a series of lights came up on the screen. It had worked! I had a signal! 

I balanced the rake against the wall, went to my phone, and dialed. I heard ringing. It was working.

*Come on, Dad, pick up, pick up . . .*

I heard my Dad’s voice – his recorded voice. “Hi, you’ve reached Martin Scott . . .”

Shit. Voice mail. I didn’t know how long I would have this signal. His answering message had never seemed so long.

“Please leave your name, number, the time of your call, and a brief message at the sound of the beep, and I’ll get back to you as soon as I can.”

I got ready to leave a message.

“If you need to send me a fax . . .” Dad continued.

For fuck’s sake!

And that was when a bird, a stupid bird, decided to land on the rake. The rake then slid through the window, pulling my phone out of my hand, and out the window with it.

“Goddammit!” I exclaimed, as I watched the rake and my phone tumble down to the forest below.

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

I sat on my bed, feeling emotionally drained. I reached for my tape recorder, and pressed record. Here is that recording:

*July eighth. Lacey, you're stuck in a situation. That much is obvious. Now, the way I see it, you can either be a scared little girl like you've been your whole life, or you can try to figure a way out of this. What's it gonna be, Lacey? What's it gonna be?*

I turned the tape recorder off. I thought of that locked filing cabinet in the storage room. I decided I needed a crowbar.

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

I found said crowbar after a lengthy search in the basement (not somewhere I would be returning to after dark). I took it with me up to the storage room, jammed it against the lock on one of the filing cabinet drawers, and smashed down on it with the baseball bat. The lock popped off, satisfyingly. I opened the drawer to find hundreds of scraps of 16mm film, which I stuffed into a pillow case.

Then I smashed the lock off the second drawer. Inside were stacks and stacks of letters. I started flipping through them, and my jaw dropped. I couldn’t absorb what I was seeing, except as fragments of sentences from different letters:

*Dear Mom, It was great hearing from you as always. I can't believe what an exciting life you live! Mine is so dull by comparison . . . Dear Mom, First day of high school. Oh my God, it's like a whole different world . . . Dear Mom, I had to write you because I was watching the news, and it was so depressing it made me cry . . . I think there's this boy in school that might actually like me. Alert the media! . . . I still get really afraid when I go outside. The doctor gave me some pills, but they don't really help . . . Do you think we're ever going to talk or meet face to face? . . . Dear Mom. I'm sorry, but Dad's new girlfriend is a total bitch . . . Is anyone ever going to kiss me? Is anyone ever going to hold my hand? Honestly, sometimes I think I'm gonna die a virgin . . . I don't want to get too deep on you, but what religion are you? Do you believe in God? . . . Dear Mom, I finally got my period today. Am I supposed to feel like a woman now? I just feel gross . . . Please write back soon . . . write back when you get a chance . . . hope to hear from you soon . . . hugs and kisses . . . lots of love . . . Love, Lacey . . . Love, Lacey . . . Love, Lacey . . .*

I sank down to the ground, completely flabbergasted. I felt so betrayed. Why had my mother sent Grandpa all my letters? Had he asked her for them as some kind of psychological background research? They were meant for her eyes only! And they’d done this all behind my back? 

There was another explanation as well – one I didn’t really want to contemplate. But I had to at least eliminate it as a possibility. So I went into Grandpa’s study, and started ransacking his desk. Looking for something I didn’t want to find.

It only took me three drawers to find it: a pad of stationery from the Savoy Hotel in London. The city my Dad had gone to on a business trip. Barely able to breathe, I grabbed a pencil and started lightly shading the top page. Sure enough, imprinted handwriting from the previous sheet showed up in white. It was Mom’s most recent letter. 

But Mom hadn’t written it. Grandpa had.

I grabbed the pad and made a beeline for the kitchen, where Grandpa was sitting at the table, reading a newspaper. I said nothing, just slammed the pad down on the table in front of him. I stood waiting, silently, as Grandpa stared at the pad.

“You shouldn't be going through my things,” he said. “It's unfortunate you had to find out this way. Your father was going to tell you when we thought you were ready.”

“Tell me what?”

Grandpa sighed and looked me straight in the eye. “Your mother died in childbirth.”

Inside, a large part of me died. On the outside, I didn't even flinch. Just stared at him.

“She went into labor very early. There was no time to get her to the hospital. I had to deliver you here. We weren't properly equipped . . .” Grandpa choked up and trailed off.

“My mother's dead?” I said, flatly.

“When you started to ask questions as a child, your father didn't think you would understand. He didn't want to explain death to you. So he just told you your mother ‘went away.’ As time went on, the lie got bigger and bigger. You found out the Easter Bunny and Santa Claus weren't real. You never found out about your mother.”

I continued to stare at him, too stunned to speak.

“It was my idea to start writing the letters,” Grandpa continued. “From an early age, it was apparent that you had some developmental problems. You were very withdrawn and distant. I thought, from a psychological viewpoint, it would be beneficial for you to have a kind of fairy godmother figure. Someone you could confess things to. Like a kind of therapy. I set up a post office box in Paris, and had the letters redirected here. I wrote the replies myself. I tried to create the most fabulous, humorous, compassionate, understanding mother. Everybody's dream mother.”

I moved my mouth, trying to speak, but nothing would come out. When I finally did speak, it was in a dull, emotionless tone. “Those letters I wrote were about all my most private things. Nobody was supposed to read them except her.”

Grandpa looked pained. “Lacey, you have to believe, your father and I, we had only the best of intentions. My wife died when your mother was very young. I saw with my own eyes, that void, that lack of maternal influence, what it can do to a young girl. I was just trying to fill that void for you.”

My eyes started to flash with a deep, burning anger. “I thought she didn't want to meet me because she didn't think I was worth it. And you let me believe that.”

“I'm sorry, Lacey. I'm terribly, terribly sorry.”

I whirled around and stalked away, as Grandpa pounded his fist on the table in frustration.

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

Instead of dealing with all the ramifications of what had just been revealed to me – which might have caused me to jump out my window – I channeled my emotions, as I so often did, into a project.

I strung up a length of twine in my room, like a clothesline, and began the painstaking job of taking all the individual film scraps I’d found in the filing cabinet and pinning them up in order of their frame number.

Once that was done, I spliced them all together into one long strip, wound it onto a reel, and loaded the reel into my projector. I dimmed the lights and projected the film onto my bed sheet.

The familiar image of Dr. Woodley behind his desk appeared. The film was scratchy, and jumped a lot due to missing frames, but I was able to gather the gist.

“My name is Dr. Anson Woodley, and I am recording, for posterity, on film, the basic elements of certain theories I've been developing, particularly relating to an ongoing experiment of mine, which I am referring to as the Regeneration Project. The–”

The film skipped. Then we got back to the first clip I’d found.

“--furthermore, the Regeneration Project will demonstrate that what we've traditionally ascribed to myth and legend has a basis in scientific fact.”

The film skipped again. Woodley now had an empty cage on his desk.

“So far, various drowning techniques have created the closest thing to a perfect ghost, but we're still not quite there yet. Let's take a look at one of my more successful attempts. If you'll observe this mouse, which I drowned, it has a distinctive marking on its belly.” Woodley held up a white dead mouse, with a dark spot on its belly. “And here we have its ghost . . .”

Woodley reached into the empty cage. Presumably, he was taking out that mouse’s ghost, which looked identical to the dead one, but because the ghost didn’t show up on film, it looked like he was pantomiming everything. He must not have discovered this property of ghosts until he’d watched his own film.

“ . . . which you see has the same distinctive marking. Now, ideally they would weigh the same. But . . .”  Woodley produced a balance scale, placed the dead mouse on one platter, the invisible live one on the other. The dead mouse sunk down a few inches. “. . . the dead mouse is clearly heavier, so the perfect ghost has not been attained.”

The film skipped again.

“--theory that I have not yet been able to prove is this. The ideal situation for the creation of the perfect ghost would be for the subject to literally die of fear -- for them to become so frightened that their heart stops beating. In other words, a sudden, massive jolt of bio-electricity, followed by instant loss of life. The problem in proving this theory is that it would be very difficult to create such a situation, particularly with animals–-”

Another skip.

“-- raises numerous ethical questions, needless to say. I'm getting into areas where I must tread very carefully. It's not overstating things to say that my research is coming close to that which man has struggled to unlock for centuries: namely, the secret of eternal life.”

The film cut to black. But I’d noticed something in those last few frames. There was a mirror on the wall behind Woodley. In it, I could see part of the camera. I’d assumed Woodley had set up the camera himself and left it to run, but for a very brief moment the head of  a cameraman popped up. Someone was filming him. Grandpa hadn’t said anything about Woodley having an accomplice.

I replayed that part of the film several times, but the cameraman’s appearance was too brief for me to get a good look at his face. If I wanted to see his features, I’d have to remove the frame and examine it as a slide.

So I unspooled the film and held it up to the light, searching for the right spot. When I found the frame I wanted, I snipped it out with a pair of scissors.

My heart started to race when I noted the frame number: 301080. The same one that had been written on my mirror in steam. I knew I must be on the right track.

I stapled it into a cardboard slide frame, slipped the slide into my slide projector, and projected it onto the sheet. It was blurry. I focused it. I walked up close to the screen, where I could now clearly see the image of a young man reflected in the mirror. He seemed very familiar.

I rushed down to the living room, grabbed the old photo of Grandpa and Woodley off the mantle, and rushed back to my room to compare it. There was no doubt about it: the cameraman was a young Bruno Kessler. My grandfather.

The gears turned in my head. Grandpa’s story was that Woodley had pursued the Regeneration Project in secret. But there Grandpa was, filming Woodley, aware of the whole thing from the beginning. Why would he lie to me? What was he hiding? 

I thought back to my first morning at the house, when I’d seen the ghost at the breakfast table. Something had struck me as odd about Grandpa’s behavior at the time, but I hadn’t dwelled on it: he’d set the table for us, but then had slid his plate away from the ghost’s chair towards his own. He’d intended to sit in that chair, but then he’d changed his mind and chosen a different one. Why? 

Because he’d seen the ghost. 

This whole time, he’d been seeing all the ghosts. But he’d pretended not to.

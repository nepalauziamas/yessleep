This is a message to all survivors as of right now.

Please send help, we are running out of food. It has been 20 days since we have run out of rations.

This post is serving as a logbook of our days of hunger. We hope to reach salvation soon.

Days 1 - 6

Day 1

Hello. I am representing a small group of 30 survivors in a small outpost situated in a library basement in North California. We have recently ran out of rations. When the **event** happened, many of us rushed out of our homes with food and water in tow. Unfortunately, there is only so much a human being can carry. We still have a supply of water but it may start dwindling soon. No food though. We can't find any clean water sources due to the **event** as you know.

I'll keep updating as more things happen. I hope we are able to find uncontaminated food soon.

Day 3

Some people are getting antsy without food. C'mon it's only been 2 days! Still, we hope this doesn't have to go on for long. Cellular service is lapsing in my area right now, so it may be a few days till I update.

Day 5

Luckily, I've been able to get another entry in. Get this, we have found a passageway to a secret room down here. The way the basement is laid out makes it so that there is a long, open space with long stretches of bookshelves on either side. Tables and chairs are scattered around for people to sit down and read. On the south side of the open area is a portion of the wall that breaks away.

Someone else found it first. There was a small tunnel, big enough for an adult to crawl through, but small enough to make people extremely claustrophobic and uncomfortable. He showed it to the rest of us, and I volunteered to go in first.

I crawled through the musty tunnel. It was dark and brownish walls surrounded me. As I got further in, a foul, odious stench filled my nose. It felt as if my nose hairs were being burned off with acid. The walls almost seemed to get tighter. I wanted to turn back but the tunnel was too narrow.

Eventually, I came to a big, empty room. It was almost as big as the library basement. It had 4 pillars scattered around randomly (I don't know what the construction workers were thinking). Same brown walls though.\\

I made the trip back and told everyone about my discovery. We decided to leave it for tomorrow. My heart leaps at the thought of more living space. The library basement, while enough to fit 30 people, gets really crowded at times. Even if there was a narrow tunnel connecting us to the new room, I still think the room could be of good use.

I don't know, what do you guys think?

Day 6

An expedition of the tunnel was carried out by the original person who found it and some other person. **They didn't come back.** After 30 minutes (keep in mind it took me 15 minutes to travel there and back), we got worried. 3 more people crawled in. Luckily, they came back.

They said the room is still there, no signs of the first two people.

I'm hoping we're able to find the missing people soon. Something about this room is starting to give me the creeps. I will update soon.

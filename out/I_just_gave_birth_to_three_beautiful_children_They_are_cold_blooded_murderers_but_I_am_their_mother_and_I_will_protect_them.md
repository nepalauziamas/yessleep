So, the results were in.

I wasn’t bloated.

It wasn’t water-weight—or a food baby from the Chinese takeout I’d had the night before.

I was 100% pregnant.

Standing in front of my mirror, I awkwardly rubbed at my bulging belly. There were a lot of things going through my mind at that moment, but most of it was internal screaming. It couldn’t be real. 

Maybe I was hallucinating—maybe Sam had slipped hallucinogens in my hot cocoa.  Taking slow, deep breaths I struggled to assess the situation.  Last night, I went to bed with a normal sized stomach. and definitely not pregnant-- and somehow I had woken up looking like an inflatable beach ball.

My third trimester. 

That’s what Google said when I’d manically typed, “How do I know if I’m about go give birth?” It listed all the symptoms, which I was feeling. I felt sick to my stomach, I could barely stand up, and when I dared press my hand onto my belly, there was movement.

 I had kicking. 

This baby I didn’t even know I was pregnant with already getting ready to vacate through my cervix. After a while of freaking out, I wobbled out of my room to the bathroom at the end of the hall. It was a shared house, so questions would start flying—and I really didn’t need that. I made it very clear since starting college last September, and moving in with three other housemates, that I had every intention to travel once the world opened up, and children were definitely not on my radar. Especially at my age. 

Not just that.  I hated the idea of the endless screaming and staying up all night. I enjoyed my sleep—and not getting barfed on every two seconds by a mini-me who wasn’t even sentient yet.  “Be honest.” I said shakily. “What would you say if I told you I was pregnant? In a totally none-ironic way.”

My voice was barely a croak after spending half an hour barfing. I didn’t know if it was the shock or another symptom.

“Totally not ironic?”

I swallowed hard. Somehow, the more I stared at my it, the worse it looked. There was no way to hide it. I’m an averagely sized person, so I have mostly tight-fitting clothes. Not even my robe could hide my ginormous stomach. I wasn’t sure what to think. It was both horrifying and yet beautiful; the idea of a mini me inside me. But I had no idea how it come to fruition, because as far as I was concerned, until waking up several hours earlier, I had not been pregnant. 

I never had months to prepare, discussing baby names and decorating a room for a new life. I didn’t get to buy maternity clothes or have a baby shower or tell my parents.  I never had any of that. It was just there. This huge change in my life—a change which didn’t make sense because I was still technically a virgin. I had been sure at some point I wanted to have children, way later on in life when I had myself figured out. When I was financially stable. 

Not as a nineteen year old junior. “Yeah.”

My girlfriend Clara didn’t respond for a moment before she laughed, albeit a little shakily. “Wouldn’t that be… anatomically impossible?” I heard the hesitation in her tone, and part of splintered at the thought of her even getting that idea. “Unless…”

Slumping onto my bed, I instantly forget the weight I was carrying, almost tipping over.

“Wow.” Despite the situation, a smile curved on my lips, “You think I fucked a guy. That stings.”

“Well, how else are you going to get pregnant?” She teased.

“This is…” I bit my lip. “A hypothetical situation.”

Clara blew a raspberry. “So, you called me up at 9am to ask, hypothetically, what I’d say if you told me you were pregnant?”

“I guess.”

“Well, I’d cry for one. And hug your ass. Because we’d both be mommies. But… wouldn’t you have to get IVF—”

“Hypothetical, Clara.” I reminded her.

Clara chuckled. I could practically sense her excitement. “I’d laugh because you’d probably name our kid after a cartoon character, or the guy’s from X files.” She let out a mocking sigh, and that was enough to make everything better. Clara was enough. “Lainie, we are not calling our kid Fox. He’ll be bullied. And that goes for Gillian too. All X files characters are a nono.”

I swiped at my watery eyes. Baby talk was emotional, especially when my other half thought I was joking around.

“Buzzkill.”

“I am saving our future son!”

“Or daughter!” I laughed, sniffling. “And you can talk. You’ll name our kid Marceline, or Marshall Lee.”

Clara gasped. “Adventure Time is good! Plus, Marshal sounds so cute! Imagine a little Marshal crawling around!”

I groaned. “It sounds ancient. You just had a crush on the cartoon. Weirdo.”

“So what if I did? Cartoons can be attractive.”

“No, Clara.” I teased. “They’re not.”

We both laughed, and for a moment I could forget I was somehow spontaneously pregnant.

“What’s brought this on?” Clara asked. “What, did you get pregnant overnight?”

“That would require fucking a guy.” I rolled my eyes. “Last time I checked, it was only you.”

Clara hummed. “You did say Ben Thwaite’s was cute.”

“Yeah, the same way I find puppies cute!” Turning a certain angle didn’t help. It only made me look bigger. There was no way I could be in denial anymore. Exhaling out a breath, I patted my stomach. “Clara, I’ve gotta go. I feel kind of sick.” That wasn’t a lie. I felt hungry and nauseous at the same time, and it was driving me crazy. There was a bag of salted peanuts on my bedside table, and I grabbed a handful, stuffing them into my mouth. “I’ll call you later, okay?” I said through a mouthful.

“Are you okay?” Clara paused, “That was… a joke, right? About you being pregnant.”

“Of course!” I swallowed thickly. “Yeah. Just a stupid joke. I’ll call you later. My, uh—my phone’s dying.”

I didn’t wait for her to reply, before stabbing end call. I wasn’t sure I could control the conversation without bursting into tears. Being pregnant was weird. 

I felt like I was going to be sick, was starving, and wanted to hit something—all at the same time. I was experiencing a full trimester all at once.  I jumped up to attempt to find loose fitting clothing when a knock startled me. At first I froze up at the thought of Sam or Cassie bounding in unannounced. I had half a mind to try and find a hiding place. Before I could, though, a familiar voice, a southern twang, relaxed that coil of dread unravelling in my gut. “Elena?”

Nick. One year younger than me, and if I didn’t like girl’s I’d definitely be attracted to him. His personalty. 
Nick was the human embodiment of a golden retriever, with the strongest southern accent I’d ever heard. He hosted game nights often, and Clara joined. My other housemates were far less tolerable, preferring to make messes they refused to clean up and refuse to pay their side of rent. Wobbling back over to my bed, I sat down, grabbing my belly. God, I was starving. But I also felt sick. “Yeah?”

He knocked again. “Are you good? I heard you violently throwing up earlier. Did you eat Cassie’s casserole?”

The image of my housemates “casserole” from the night before made my stomach twist. That wasn’t food. It was science.

“No.” I answered, “No, I had takeout.”

“Oh, boy. Good luck with the food poisoning. That place is well known for intentionally poisoning students.”

“Thanks.”

He sighed. “How you holdin’ up in there? I can get you some water.”

I grabbed more nuts, piling them into my mouth. “I’m fine, Nick.” It took me three attempts to get back up, and each time was more painful. “I just woke up sick."

I dressed quickly, struggling out of the long t-shirt I wear for bed, and throwing on my baggiest sweater. Frowning at  a crumpled pair of jeans, I inwardly groaned. There was no way I’d be able to squeeze into them. “In fact,” I said, struggling through my closet, “You should probably stay away. I don’t want to give you this virus thing.”

“Oh shit.” I could hear him pressing his face into the door, his words muffled, “Do you have the C word?”

“C word?” I almost tripped over attempting to squeeze into leggings, “Nick, are you in elementary school?”

The boy snorted. “Sorry. My professor insists on us calling it “the C word” so it kinda stuck.”

Leggings weren’t going to work. Even my stretchy ones I wore for yoga that one time I went to the gym. Grabbing a black pair, I threw them to the back, focusing on my best shot, a pair of my mom’s jeans she insisted on me having when I moved in. “Yeah, It’s the C word.”  I lied. “I just took a test. So, steer clear from me, okay? I think it’s Obicran, or whatever it’s called.”

There was a pause, and I thought he’d left, before Nick let out a laugh.

“Do you mean Omicron?” Nick was starting to sound sceptical. “I don’t think vomiting is a symptom of the C word, Elena.”

I had a thinning patience at that point. “Well, it is.” I snapped. “Nicholas.” I leaved in a breath.

That’s what the movies said, right? I had to breathe in through my nose and out through my mouth. “Go away.”

“Oh, dude, you full-named me.” Nick said. “There’s got to be something wrong. You’d be zonked out in your bed if you were sick.” The door handle twitched, and I was caught off guard, stumbling back. 

I swore I’d locked it. I lunged forward to slam it shut in his face, but my body froze up, and I became all too aware I was far too pregnant to be doing death-defying leaps across my room. The door opened, and Nick’s head of brown curls poked in. Initially, he’d had this giant smile on his face, like poking his head into my room was comedic fucking genius.  

But then his eyes tracked the room, first, the pile of clothes on my floor, the bags of nuts spilled all over my pink bedspread, and then to me, standing in my bra and ill-fitting leggings which wouldn’t even fit around my hips. Nick’s expression turned kind of cartoonish, his eyes widening, lips twisting into a look of horror and then amazement, and then back to horror. 

Before he could speak, or start yelling, I managed to grab and yank him inside, slamming the door and locking it. Nick was speechless for a moment, seemingly trance-like. He tripped over one of my sneakers, but barely noticed. I waited for him to speak, but his eyes were glued to my very pregnant stomach.

“Wow.” He finally said, blowing out a breath. Nick dragged a hand through his own bedhead hair. “You swallowed Saturn.”

“Pregnant.” I corrected him.

Nick nodded, rubbing his eyes. “I can see that.” He whispered. “But aren’t you like—

“Yes!” The scream which had been clawing at my throat finally made an appearance. “That’s why this makes no sense!”

Nick frowned before situating himself in front of me and poking me in the gut. “I’ve heard about this kind of thing,” He muttered before slumping down on my bed. “There have been reports of women complaining of stomach-ache, and bam, they were pregnant the whole time.” 

His tone turned serious. “Some people don’t even know they’re pregnant, as crazy as that sounds. I read this article about a woman who didn’t even realise she was pregnant until she gave birth the same day.”

“I never had stomach-ache,” I hissed out, “Or cramps. I just woke up, and I’m pregnant!”

Standing was tiring me out. I sat next to him, rubbing at my gut. “This should be impossible.” I whispered.

“I’ll say.” Nick muttered. He turned to me. “So, you’ve never…”

“No!” I hissed. “It’s always just been Clara.”

“Uh-huh.” Nick’s lip curled into a smirk, his brow arching. “So, what, you’re the modern-day virgin Mary?”

I offered him a sickly smile. “I’m an atheist, but sure.”

Nick jumped up. “Okay.” He said. “Right. So, first, we need to get you some kind of check-up, right?”

“Right.” I said, taking deep breaths in and out. “Do you think I could… you know…” I trailed off.

Nick blinked at me. “I’m failing to understand the telepathic signals you’re sending me,” He chuckled. “Do I think… ”

“Do you think I might give birth today?” I whispered.

The idea of doing so terrified me. I hadn’t had time to prepare for the pain and trauma, I was just stuck with it.

Cocking his head, Nick shrugged. His expression softened, as he busied himself packing.

“We’re going to get you help, okay? You’re good, Elena.”

I followed him, but I could barely stand. Luckily, his arms were around me, stabling me. “Dude. Sit down. I’ll pack you a bag, and you can call Clara. I’ll drive you to the hospital, and we can figure this thing out, alright?” He grinned. “Breathe, Elena.”

I punched him in the shoulder with a hiss. “I am breathing!” Thinking about telling Clara about my situation twisted my gut. “For now, I won’t tell her.” I said. “Clara doesn’t need to know. She’s busy with exams, and her mom’s fucking overbearing.”

“Right. No Clara.” Nick said. “What about your mom?”

“Are you kidding?” I kicked my legs, frowning at my toes. “She’ll have heart failure.”

“Dad?”

“You know what my dad thinks about…certain things.” I made a face. I hadn’t spoken to him in a while.

“Good point.” Nick straightened up. “No offense, but your dad’s a total ass.”

The boy  was already a whirlwind speeding around my room and throwing anything he grabbed into my backpack.

“Nick.” I swatted at him when he leaned close to grab the bag of nuts. “You don’t need to pack my Switch.”

“Why?” He chuckled, stuffing in the console, and my snacks. “Who says you won’t be playing Pokémon while squeezing out a kid?”

Half an hour later, we were all packed, and I was hiding in the downstairs bathroom while my other housemates were clanging around in the kitchen. I’d managed to make it downstairs before any of them saw me—but it was a close call with Sam running to and from the upstairs bathroom, settling a bad hangover. 

I did what I could to make myself look mildly presentable, splashing water on my face. When Nick poked his head through the door, jangling his car-keys, we both mastered cloak-and-dagger ducking and half-running, before we made it out of the door, and onto the sidewalk where Nick’s car was parked. My housemate helped me into the back before diving into the front. 

“You okay?” He twisted around to flash me a reassuring smile, and I could only nod. The truth was, I didn’t feel well at all. I’m a hypochondriac anyway, so for most of the car-ride, I was googling everything I was feeling. 

When Nick took a sharp turn, something warm crept up my throat, and something… snapped. At least, that’s what it felt like. It felt like something had moved, snapped, come apart.

Pain. I remember pain, like lightning bolts racking my stomach.

“Fuck.” I wheezed out, my head slamming into warm leather.

“You okay?” Nick said, “It’s cool, we’re almost there. Traffic’s a bitch.”

He rolled up the window, leaning out. “Hey! I need you guys out of the road, stat! I got a pregnant girl in the back!”

“Nick.” I gritted out. His yelling was piercing my skull and slicing into my brain. “I think…”

Pushing out the words was tiring. “I think.”

I think…

My brain whirred.

What did I think?

My brain was intent on looking up this exact feeling, but more pain, explosive fucking pain which felt like my stomach was being ripped open. My phone slipped from my hands, and I started to panic, my chest squeezing. The words were in my mouth, but I wasn’t saying them. So many tangled words which suddenly didn’t make sense. Nothing made sense. Not the song on the radio garbled with static, or whatever Nick was saying. He might as well have been speaking a foreign language.

“Elena?” Nick’s voice was suddenly faded, like ocean waves. I was aware of the car taking another turn, and something was—wet. I could feel it underneath me.

It came fast, soaking my leggings and the seat. Black spots were dancing around my vision, blossoming and then shrinking, and I felt my hand subconsciously grasp at the seat. I felt wet warmth. And through fraying vision my fingers were bright red. The type of red which terrified me. The sight of it, scarlet everywhere, all over my fingers, all over my seat, and dripping down my legs, I screamed. But my scream didn’t hit the sound barrier. My vision wavered. For one moment it was in vivid clarity. Nick’s face was so close, and he was yelling something. The passenger door was open, and cool air was grazing the back of my neck. I remember his eyes wide with terror, lips twisted with the type of fear I didn’t think it existed. Before…. Darkness. At least, it was mostly darkness. 

I came back in flashes. One second my head was falling back against the backseat of Nick’s car, and then I was moving—rapidly moving—at what felt like lighting speed. I was seeing white. White everything; white ceiling, white walls, shadows looming over me wearing identical surgical masks. I didn’t even have time to feel panic. Nick was nowhere to be found, and when I blinked rapidly, the corridors were empty. 

There was just me. 

Just me, and the shadows, and multiple automatic doors I was being pushed through. The world seemed to bleed away once again while I was trying to focus on a shadow’s face, trying to pull an identity. I won’t say I remember giving birth because I didn’t. I’m still not entirely sure what happened. I just remember being in agony, screaming into a mask pressed over my face, and being told to breathe. 

But I couldn’t. And no matter how much I pushed, how much I screeched, nothing was happening. A prick in my arm sent me back into the dark, and when I finally resurfaced after a while of just floating, and not thinking, not feeling—nothing, I opened my eyes to a dimly lit room. 

I was sandwiched between a dozen pillows. I felt kind of high. When I peered over the blankets pinning me to the bed, I was staring at my very flat stomach. Panic struck. I was so out of it, I was confused. Brain  fog choked me. I hadn’t given birth. 

I remembered failing to push, and the nurse’s pricking me with a needle—despite me screaming at them not to. There had been so much pain, so much screaming and yelling and confusion. That’s when I felt it. That sensation that can’t be described unless you have children—an instinct I never thought I’d have. 

When I was younger, I scoffed when my mom told me I’d just… feel it once becoming a mother. And I’d know. There would be nothing to be scared of because I would instantly know what to do. 

I thought she was lying, or over exaggerating. But my mother was right. It was almost… territorial.  Knowing my baby was real, and they were somewhere in the room, I wanted to hold him, or her. 

I wanted to cradle my child in my arms and tell them they were safe. But when I tried to sit up, my head spinning, I couldn’t see my baby. I could see the tiny plastic crib and the blankets, but my baby wasn’t there. Every possible scenario flicked through my head, from my child being cared for by a nurse, to being kidnapped by a silhouette bleeding into the shadows. It was hard to fully take the room in. Everything was bathed in a colourful, almost hazy blur. Stiffening up, I scanned the room feverishly before a quiet laugh brought me out of my reverie.

“She’s totally out of it.”

“She will be, Mr Tanner,” A female murmur. "She’s on strong pain medication.”

“Over here, Elena.”

Nick’s voice. My gaze snapped to my left and then my right, and when I caught a shadow bleeding into reality, back to the left. My housemate was leaning against the wall, holding a bundle in his arms. 

Weirdly, my housemate was already a natural at handling a baby. Which confused me because he couldn’t hold a cat properly without it trying to scratch his eyes out. He looked exhausted, his eyes half lidded, a lazy smile on his lips, his clothes crumpled. Nick must have been sitting in the waiting area most of the day. 

Seeing the tiny lump pressed against his chest, I instinctively leaned forward to reach out for my baby, but Nick grinned and gestured to two other figures next to him. I barely noticed them. Two nurse’s also holding bundles of blankets. For a disorienting moment I was confused why they were holding my babies blankets, but then the blankets in their arms moved, and made soft sounds, and I let out a sharp hiss of swears which came out—because on anaesthetic you don’t have a filter. “No.” I said, and then I laughed hysterically. “Are you serious?” My voice was barely a whisper. “Three?!”

I wasn’t planning on telling the nurse’s about the spontaneous pregnancy—yet. But how the hell did I have three?

Is that why I was so big? Did that even matter? I never paid attention in health class.

To my relief, the nurse’s didn’t ask questions.

Questions I had no idea what to answer without getting myself locked up in a psych ward.

The nurse nearest to the door nodded with a smile. “Triplets.” She said, her expression sobering slightly. “Miss Field, due to certain circumstances, we had to go ahead and perform an emergency caesarean. You were losing far too much blood.”

I nodded dazedly. “Yeah.” I whispered, slurring my words. “I.. um…”

“You almost died, Elena. I didn’t know what to do. You weren’t responding, and I had to call an ambulance.” Nick said, before taking slow steps towards me and gently dropping the bundle into my arms. She was so warm and tiny, a mini-me staring up at me with wide eyes. I held each of them. I had two boys and one girl, and they were the most beautiful babies I’d ever seen. Bias, I know, because they were mine. But having them in my arms and whispering into their tiny locks of hair, everything made sense. 

The whole world made so much sense, and I was already seeing a life with me, Clara, and the three of them. When they were put back in their crib, Nick sat on the edge of the bed. “I’ve called Clara.” He said—and before I could speak, he sighed. “No, I haven’t told her. But you really need to figure out what you’re going to say. You can’t keep it from her.” He shrugged. “As crazy as this situation is, she’s the mom. And she’s gonna be pissed if you keep it from her.”

When the nurse’s left, I tried to sit up, but my body felt—weird. Light and floaty.

I wanted to talk to Nick about Clara, and my fear of her having a negative reaction, but all that came out of my mouth was:

“Names.” Collapsing back into the mountain of pillows, I sighed, pointing to the crib.

“Table.” I said, gesturing to one bundle. “Chair.” I pointed to the other, “And… Bruce.”

“Oh!” I didn’t notice a nurse had poked her head in to check on the babies. “Those names are… interesting.”

“She’s kidding.” Nick deadpanned. He plonked himself into one of the chairs beside the bed, throwing his legs over the armrest and tipping his head back. His gaze went to the ceiling. “Elena, if you name your children after furniture, I will disown you as a friend.” I laughed, my head still spinning around and around, but he lifted his head with a smirk. “I’m not joking.”

I shrugged, half aware my brain was trying to shut down again. I asked Nick and the nurse’s to bring them over to me again, and they did. “Fox.” I mumbled, pointing to the smallest one. The one who’s tiny face was hidden under the blanket. Because despite her protests, Clara said it was a cute name—when she was drunk. “Madeline.” I said. “And Ren.” Those names had both come up during our extended bay talk conversation. Clara loved the name Madeline, and Ren sounded pretty badass.

That’s the last thing I remember before I passed out again. I remember little Madeline’s eyes blinking open and staring at me. I slept for a while. I don’t know how long. I normally dream, but this time there was just oblivion which felt like I was stuck. Like something was holding me down. 

Reality hit me when I opened my eyes, realising something heavy was weighing down on my chest. Not just that. I couldn’t move. My hands were strapped down, and panic filled me like poison. I heard yelling, and the sounds of struggling—before clarity hit. Sunlight was streaming through the windows. Nick was leaning over me, struggling with the weight on my chest, and then—small fingernails grasping at my throat. “Elena!” Nick’s voice was a cry, and I struggled to process it. I struggled to process him trying to get his arms wrapped around a squirming lump bouncing on my chest and claw free my restrained wrists. “Hey!” Nick came close, his heavy breath in my face. “Shit! Are you awake?”

His voice was almost a sob. “Oh god, I thought you’d never wake up! Okay, listen to me. Something is… very wrong.”

Huh? That was all I could think. With my arms free, I sat up, blinking rapidly. My visceral reaction was to turn to my cradle to see my sleeping children. 

But to my shock, a little kid was sitting directly on my chest. It was a little boy, five or six years old, dark brown floppy hair and a wide grin. His arms were outstretched as if to hug me, but instead he clawed at my face. I resisted against pushing him off me, and turned my attention to Nick, who was stumbling around, drunkenly. There was something clinging to his back. No. I blinked rapidly.

A little blonde girl bouncing up and down, insisting on a piggy-back ride. The little girl was giggling, “Horsey!” she was yelling, and my housemate was struggling to pry her small hands from his neck.

“Elena, you’ve been drugged.” Nick hissed out, grappling with the little girl. “I mean, we have. They got me last night, and we’ve both been out for maybe half a day.” He yelped when the girl stuck her fingers in his back. “Ow! Jesus, that hurt!”

“You’re a horse!” The girl giggled.

“I told you, if you keep doing that I won’t lift you up.”

“Horsey!” The girl said, in a far more demanding tone. “Horsey, horsey, horsey!”

“Nick.” I finally said, my tongue felt bloated. I kept looking at the empty cradle, and my heart was racing.

“Where are my children?” The words felt so strange coming out of my mouth—but right. “Where are they—"

I trailed off when another kid ran in screaming, before diving onto my bed. Another little boy, this time with sandy coloured hair. I noticed something was very wrong with his hands. They shouldn’t have been red—dripping red. And there shouldn’t have been splatters down the light blue t-shirt and shorts he was wearing. But I didn’t speak because I couldn’t. Because my housemate  finally wrapped his arms around the little girl and lifted her into the air. She squealed in delight. His eyes flicked to me, and I noticed how pale he was. “Elena.” He spoke softly, pretending to soar the girl through the air. “Don’t freak out, okay?” 

His gaze kept flashing to the little boy down the door, the one leaning against the door with a grin, hands covered in red, folded across his chest. Nick was terrified. I saw it in his eyes, the overwhelming urge to run driving him into fight or flight.

But he stayed. He kept swinging around the little girl, even when she too had traces of red under her fingernails, and her smile was far too large. Unbelievably, every time I looked away from him, from the boy sitting on my chest, and the little blonde girl In Nick’s arms—their faces were rapidly changing, contorting. The blonde girl’s hair had already grown past her shoulders. If I focused on the little boy trying to scratch out my eyes, he was—growing. Rapidly. He was five when I first glimpsed him, and suddenly he looked almost six. Maybe even seven.  I shook my head, in denial. No, I wouldn’t believe it.

Even when reality was staring right at me.

“Where are my kids?” I said it again in a hysterical breath.

Nick blew out a breath. “Okay, Mads.” He settled the girl with a smile. “Uncle Nick is going to put you down, and you’re not going to start screaming. Okay?”

The girl frowned. “No.” she said. “No, I want to fly!”

Nick put her down anyway, and the girl jumped onto the bed, joining the boy.

Nick helped me out of bed, and he was trembling. “Okay, yeah, so there’s no real way to say it, so fuck it, I’m going to tear of the band-aid.” He sighed. “Your children are right here.” He pointed to the girl. “Madeline.” He moved onto the boy bouncing on the mattress, and then the other boy covered in red. “Ren is the one who tried to choke you multiple times while you were sleeping, and uh—Fox…”

He trailed off, exhaling out a breath. “Let’s just get out of here, okay? We can talk about your abnormally ageing children when we’re far away from here.”

Instead of freaking out, I nodded. My arms felt.. empty. I wanted to hold the babies I held last night, but they were gone. I did my best to gather them in front of me, and ignoring their ageing, which shouldn’t make sense, which was physically impossible, I still had that instinct to hold them, to protect them. When I wrapped my arms around them, Fox’s hands were wet and warm with red. I ignored that, settling them with a strained smile. 

“Okay.”


I stroked Madeline’s hair, ruffled Ren’s floppy fringe, which was growing into his eyes, and buttoned up Fox’s shirt. Nick must have taken care of their clothes. “I’m going to get you some help, okay?” I said softly. I let out a breath. “We’re going to go home, and we’re going to get this all sorted out.” To my surprise, the three of them understood what I was saying, nodding and smiling along. Madeline wrapped her arms around my neck, giggling into my hair. “There’s a surprise for you outside the door.” She said, “You’ll like it.”

Ren nodded. “Uh-huh! We did it before Uncle Nick woke up.”  He nodded to Nick. “Right, Uncle Nick?”

“Squashy.” Madeline giggled. “Squashy, squiggly bits.” She turned to Nick. “Did you like our present?”

Nick didn’t reply. He was all ready with the bags. “Elena.” He shot me a look. “Just look straight forward.”

He ducked so Madeline could jump onto his back, and Fox and Ren grabbed my hands.

“What?” Something ice-cold crept down my spine. “What are you talking about?”

He didn’t need to say anything. Ren led the way, dragging me to the door. He shot out his hand, and at first I thought he was reaching to pull it open, but he didn’t even touch it, and the door flew open violently, almost straight off of its hinges. 

I didn’t speak and followed my kids onto the hallway, which was dimly lit. It was silent, like I remembered when I was being taken into surgery. Taking a step forwards, I didn’t even realise I was barefoot until my bare soles grazed something… wet. Something which squished between my toes. I felt it squelch beneath me, and before I could react, Nick was grabbing my arm and yanking me forwards. 

“Just look forward.” He hissed out, and then to Madeline, who was getting too big to cling onto his back, “Mads, you’re choking me.” I didn’t look at my feet, or the mess on the ground. I didn’t look at the smears of red on the walls and on the floor. I just kept walking, squeezing my son’s hands tighter. By the time we were outside, and I was helping them into the car, my children were anatomically approaching ten years old. 

It was hard to take in, and I was sure at some point I was going to freak out. But I was in a state of autopilot, strapping them in and grasping their faces, turning them to look at me. They didn’t look sick. They looked like normal, healthy ten year olds—who had been born last night. 

When Nick jumped into the driver’s seat and started the car, I drank them in again. Madeline, squished against the window, staring out, her eyes wide with awe, Ren in the middle, kicking his legs with a smile, and Fox, drawing a smiley face in the condensation in the window. I tried to smile at Fox, and he smiled back, reached out and stroked my ponytail.

“Mom.” He said.

“Yeah?”

“Would you be mad if we killed you and Uncle Nick?”

His words sent my heart into my throat. I just smiled, pretended everything was fine, and turned around.

When I risked looking at Nick, his hands were trembling, grasping at the steering wheel.

“So, what happens when they reach our age?” He said, stamping on the gas. “Are you looking forward to them enrolling at our college tomorrow?”

I leaned back in my seat, swallowing hard. I didn’t know how to answer that.

“Or.” Nick was on the edge of hysterics. “When the police find out they massacred half of a hospital I don’t even fucking remember taking you to.”

“What?” I whispered.

“Yeah.” Nick’s gaze were stuck to the road, and I watched, baffled, as my children continued to age right in front of me. “That hospital was shady as fuck. It’s not our local, and I was freaking out too much with you almost dying to even realise.”

I shivered. “Ren.” I hissed out. “You… you saw what he did, right?”

Nick snorted. “Oh, you should have been awake when they were toddlers. Shit was fucking levitating, I thought I was high.” He gripped the wheel tighter. “Actually, no.. I was high. Because those bastards pricked me with a needle, drugging me. I woke up, cuffed to the chair, and you were restrained to the bed. Luckily, your children somehow snapped the cuffs.”

“Mom.” Madeline said from the back. “I’m hungry.”

Nick stuck his hand in the glove compartment and threw a pack of candy at the girl. “Knock yourself out, Mads.” He sent me a grin which was far too wide. 

“So! When are you going to admit you definitely did the dirty with an actual demon?” He cleared his throat, catching the kid’s frowns in the wing mirror. “Or, maybe it was Cassie’s casserole?  She put anything she could find in the kitchen in that thing. Including actual cleaning products. Now, that was creation. Not food. But creation.”

I didn’t reply to that. There was no way I could explain it without going fucking crazy.

By the time we were back at the house, the kid’s had gone through four packs of candy, and were anatomically twelve or thirteen years old. I couldn’t look at them. They didn’t look like my children anymore. They were growing too fast. Madeline was almost as tall as Nick, and Fox and Ren looked ready to go to middle school. When Nick opened the front door, Sam’s face was a jump-scare. He was scowling. As usual, he was high and in a shitty mood. My housemate took one look at the three kid’s hiding behind Nick and shook his head. 

“Nope.” He said. “No, man. I don’t want little brats in here.” His lips curved into a smirk, his gaze flicking to me. “Elena.” He said. “Please tell me you’re not babysitting literal fucking thirteen year olds.”

“Out of the way, Sam.” Nick said. “They’re my… cousins.”

“Nope.” Sam was adamant. “I’m cooking shit up in here, man. I don’t need snot nosed brats messing up my stuff.”

Madeline tugged on my jacket. I had done my best to tie up her hair with one of my scrunchies, but it needed a cut.

“Mom, why isn’t he letting us in?”

Sam’s eyes bugged out. “Mom?” He laughed. “Hold up. Am I missing something?”

I shoved past him, puling my kid’s with me. “Leave it, Sam.” I said. But we had only managed to get two steps into the hallway, before Cassie appeared in a blur of red hair. “No.” She stuck her tongue out at the kid’s. “No, this is a kid-free zone.” She folded her arms, glaring at Nick. “Are you guys insane? Where did you even find three..” She cocked her head, “How old are they?”

Madeline stepped in front of Cassie. “You’re mean.” She scowled at the girl.

Cassie scoffed. “Oh, I’m mean? Go home, kid. Shouldn’t you be at school?”

I watched Cassie’s mouth open to laugh, and I was sure it was going to—but then my daughter was reaching out. I thought she was going to slap my housemate, but her hand kept going, penetrating the girl’s chest. Cassie’s body jolted, like a puppet on strings. Her mouth was still open in a laugh, but it was too late to twist into a scream. Madeline retracted her hand with a grin, and squelched between her hands was something still moving, still humming, alive, red streaming between scarlet fingers. I remember stumbling back, throwing out my arms and trying to stop the other’s from following suit. 

But Sam was already flying into the wall, again and again, his body crumpling into a heap on the ground. Fox was on top of him, choking the breath from his lungs. Nick dragged me back, when Ren grabbed a paper weight and slammed it down on Sam’s head.

Gasping for breath, Ren sat back with a hiss. “Nice going.” He spat at Madeline, who dropped Cassie’s heart with a squeak.

“You gave us away!” He yelled, diving to his feet.

Fox jumped to his feet, swiping blood from his face. “No.” He hissed out. “No, we can fix this. We’re all good.”

“Right!” Madeline said, tripping over Cassie’s body. “We eliminated both targets, and now—” Her gaze flashed to me.

“Clean up.” She said.

I staggered back, half aware of Nick being cornered. I didn’t remember Fox picking up a knife, but I saw the glint of silver clenched between his fists. I saw it plunge inside of my housemate’s chest, and I couldn’t do anything. Nick let out a cry and hit the ground with a hiss, and my son’s were crouching in front of me, while Madeline was looming over Nick. They had reached the age of sixteen, or maybe seventeen. I wasn’t looking at my children anymore. I was looking at strangers.

“Thanks for the candy.” Fox jumped up, signalling to Madeline. “We’re out of here.”

Madeline nodded, shooting me a grin. “I didn’t kill Uncle Nick.” She said, pressing a finger to her lips. “Promise!”

“Wait.” When I tried to run after them, something stopped me, like a physical barrier in front of me.

“Where are you going?”

The three of them ignored me. When the door slammed shut, and their footsteps thundered down the steps, I remembered how to move. The barrier disappeared, and I crawled over to Nick, who was sitting against the wall, his hand pressed over his chest. When I checked it out, there was no blood, only the trauma of where the knife had gone through his shirt. But there was no wound. When I pressed my hands over where the knife had penetrated, I felt something, a weird wet liquid wet on his skin. It was clear blue with the texture of blood. Nick met my gaze, his expression twisted. “What the fuck is that?”

I shook my head, helping him up.

When I did though, and Nick stumbled, I could have sworn, just  for a second…he looked shorter.

I didn’t need to say anything, he already knew what I was thinking. I couldn’t let them get away. Whatever they were, human, or not, I still feel like I have to protect them. They are my children, after all. I would be a bad mom if I just let them go.

Nick heaved out a breath. No, I wasn’t seeing things. Nick’s face looked almost bloated, and he was.. shrinking.

“You’re kidding.” He said.

No, of course I wasn’t. Maybe this mother’s instinct is a curse in itself, but it’s like a weight on my chest.

If I don’t find them, I feel like I’ll stop breathing. I need to find them, regardless of them not wanting to be found.

Regardless of their rapid ageing.

So, that’s what I’m going to do.

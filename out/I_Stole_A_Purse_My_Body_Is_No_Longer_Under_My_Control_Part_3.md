During the rickety elevator ride to her apartment, Thys made a phone call. She spoke angrily to a tired man on the other end of the line in a language that I guessed was Arabic. When finished, she turned to me and smiled. 

“Your paperwork is on the way. I hope you like the name Mateo.” 

The elevator lurched to a stop, and my stomach lurched with it. I had to lean against the wall to make it to Thys’ door, and when I stepped into her pitch-black abode, I felt something plastic crunch beneath my feet. 

“A tarp.” Thys explained. “Helps with the cleanup. The windows are sealed and I can see in the dark, so you’ll need your own light source.” I was so drunk that all that made a kind of sense. I took out my phone, shook on the flashlight, and tried to ignore the reddish stains on the plastic under my feet. 

Thys’ house was like a museum of abandoned hobbies. She hustled me books stacked to ceiling in unsteady columns, walls of dusty instruments, a homemade PC surrounded by generations of electronics, and a room where a pale, bloodless girl was sitting for her portrait–forever. A half finished canvas depicted her corpse, posed nude on a red sofa. 

When Thys’ suggested I sleep on an identical couch, I shuddered to think what might have transpired on the fabric where I was about to lay my head. 

“Sleep.” Thys said simply, and whether it was the booze, exhaustion, or some kind of spell, I obeyed. I kicked off my shoes, climbed onto the antique sofa, and when I turned off my phone, the room was as dark as the other side of sleep. 

I woke to the sensation of thumbs pressing into my eyeballs. 

Not Thys’, or anyone else’s–

My own. 

If headaches could kill, I would have been dead. I was in too much agony to scream. 

*“Pardon me, but what the hell do you think you’re doing?!”*  the voice of K, the black worm that had burrowed into my brain, warbled and popped like a bad recording. With a sinking feeling, I realized that it had control of my hands. In the Café Louisiana, Thys had told me that once it started controlling my body, I was done for…

“Thys said–” I groaned.

*“--’Thys said’?!”* K cut me off with a burst of pain. *“Did it not occur to you that maybe, just* maybe, *the 400-year-old homicidal vampire might be lying? Toying with you, just to see what would happen?”* 

As K’s tirade continued, I realized that I could still move my hands…with a little effort. I still wasn’t convinced that Thys hadn’t been wrong, or lying. This might just mean that K’s “expansion” inside my brain was further along than I’d thought. 

It might just mean that I was running out of time. 

The doorbell rang–and I heard Thys crawl across the ceiling to answer it.

“Your documents are ready.” A voice in the darkness beside me whispered, only moments later. “Give my regards to your uninvited guest.” 

The apartment door stood open, casting light over the huge plastic tarp and the antique apartment. Thys was inviting me out. 

After the pitch-black apartment, the sun outside was blinding. 

*“I took the liberty of charging your phone and using your hands to buy our plane tickets.”* K informed me, sounding pleased with itself. *“Unfortunately, there wasn’t enough in your account to cover the cost of a next-day flight, so I also took out a few credit cards in your name.”* 

“You used my body while I slept?!” I groaned. As nightmarish as it was to think that K could take control of me the moment I drifted off, what he’d done to my bank account was no less horrifying. My stomach rumbled. A leftover kebab was the last thing I’d eaten, over a day ago before I’d started making the rounds of the metro and snatched that woman’s damned bag. 

*“You need sustenance.*” K commented. *“If I may make a recommendation, I’m partial to American-style breakfasts: black coffee, three slices of bacon, two eggs over easy, hashbrowns and pancakes with lots of maple syrup.”* At the moment, *anything* sounded good–and besides, I knew just the spot. It was where the hungover tourists gathered when they missed home, and it was a great place to blend in, hide out, or walk off with an unattended laptop. 

“I can make that work,” I grumbled, “but can we afford it?”

*“Of course we can. As long as you put it on your new credit card.”* 

An hour later, breakfasted and somewhat more awake, we were on a metro ride to the airport. I found myself instinctively sizing people up: the college student who’d left his billfold in his back pocket. The two elderly missionaries who weren’t watching their luggage. The backpacker with who kept her iPhone in a mesh compartment… 

*“Remember, we don’t want any more trouble than what we’ve already got.”* K warned.

“You’re reading my–” something suddenly occurred to me: *“you’re reading my thoughts?!”* I no longer had to speak with K to communicate with it. I thought about Thys’ warning and a chill ran down my spine. Soon, K wouldn’t have to wait until I fell asleep to do as it pleased with me. Soon…I would have no more control over myself than the passengers around me had over the metro we were riding in. I couldn’t help it; my eyes were back to scanning the wagon for easy marks. 

They settled on a familiar face.

If I hadn’t made eye contact with her, the woman who I’d robbed probably wouldn’t have noticed me. I remembered *her,* though: the feeling of sliding that bag off of her shoulder, the rush of smug satisfaction, the troubling weight and shape of it–then finding K wriggling around in the eye socket of the severed head inside. If I could, I would have taken it all back. 

But I didn’t have time for regrets. The woman whispered something into an earpiece and reached behind her back. I didn’t have to wonder what she was reaching for

*A weapon. To kill me.* 

It wasn’t easy to run in the stuffy, tight-packed metro. I collided with bags, barking dogs, and sweaty bodies; the more I tried to push my way through, the more resistance I faced. 

To make matters worse, the woman was *fast.* I thought *I* was good at weaving through a crowd, but that woman, she was something else–and unlike me, she wasn’t panicking. 

Those baby-blue eyes that had looked so innocent when I’d robbed her now looked like two cubes of ice–

And they were fixed on my neck like it was the most important thing in the world. 

As I rammed my way into the next wagon, I saw what the woman was holding: a knife, made out of something like glass, practically invisible to someone not looking for it.

She slithered through the packed wagon like a snake. I just couldn’t get away from her!

I bounced off of the belly of a chain-draped soccer hooligan. There were five of them, huge sunburned-pink mountains of flesh standing between me and my only escape.

“Just where you fink yer goin’, then?” the hooligan sneered.

“I, uh–” my eyes darted to the blue-and-white colors of his jersey. I felt my mouth move on its own. *“I just wanted to tell you that you’re a fat knob and FC Chelsea is garbage.”* 

K had spoken for me. With a roar, the big man flung me into the middle of his friends.

“HEY!” two security guards shouted. I could hear them running my way, but the hooligans’ off-brand sneakers were a lot closer. I curled up like a shrimp as they battered me. Passengers were screaming; the doors beeped open as the metro came to a halt. The guards grabbed my shoulders and dragged me out of the stomp-fest…and the icy-eyed woman slid her wicked glasslike dagger into her sleeve and faded into the crowd. 

*“What the hell was that?!”* I asked K, when we were finally out of the metro. 

*“I just saved both our lives!”* K reminded me, as I staggered over to a waiting taxi. I spent as much time looking behind me as in front, terrified that the icy-eyed woman would appear again. I could already imagine the sudden puncture, the cold out-take of air as she slid the dagger between my ribs…

“I’d hate to see the other guy,” the cab driver chucked. Only then did I realize the blood dribbling down from my mouth and nose. I checked the mirror. I looked like a walking corpse.

“Airport,” I groaned. As the cab cruised through the rainy streets, I nursed my injuries, double-checked my travel documents, and thought about the black worm inside my head. 

After all, if K could already seize control of my mouth at will…it was only a matter of [time.](https://www.reddit.com/r/beardify/comments/x843og/you_choose_the_story_what_is_the_pickpockets_next/)

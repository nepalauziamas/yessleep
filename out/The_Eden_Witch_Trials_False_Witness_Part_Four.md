[*I was pregnant.*](https://reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/xqskgv/the_eden_witch_trials_sabbath_part_three/)

I have selected the most pertinent passages from my great–(x16)–grandmother’s memoirs to illustrate the events of the Eden witch trials, during which she was one of many accused, tried, and convicted of practising witchcraft. My notes are in brackets.

*I did not know who the father was. Was it my husband? He* could *be the father. Yet there was a possibility that he was not. It was also possible that what I dreamed was not a dream at all. The Devil, conjured from Hell by witches, could have deposited his seed inside me. I was sickened by the thought. However, I could not dwell on it, as I needed to try my best to avoid suspicion from anyone, especially the afflicted girls.*

*The trials of the first three women accused of witchcraft were held concurrently in the beginning of May. Goody Jacobs, Goody Oliver, and Goody Williams each pleaded “Not Guilty.” Their accusers testified under oath about their sundry acts of witchcraft. Muttered curses, failed crops, and dead livestock. The trials lasted one day. The jury deliberated for an hour before they returned with the verdict of “Guilty.” The judge sentenced Goody Jacobs, Goody Oliver, and Goody Williams to death by hanging.*

*On the following night, I looked out of the window in the back before I went to bed, and I was startled when I saw Ann Pearson in our backyard, kneeling in my garden. What was she doing? She stood up, looked around, and walked away. After she left, I walked outside, and I entered my garden. Kneeling in the dirt, I saw seeds she had planted. The seeds looked ordinary, but I was wary. Why would she plant seeds in my garden? However, I could not draw attention to myself, particularly because of my condition, so I walked back inside, as if I saw nothing.*

*When I awoke in the morning, I saw the seeds had grown at an unnatural and unusual speed. They were already seedlings. By afternoon, they had started to flower. However, they were not the ordinary plants that I thought they were. Belladonna, cinquefoil, henbane, and monkshood. Not only were these plants toxic, I knew they were used in witchery, mixed with the fat of an unbaptised baby, to make the ointment with which witches anoint themselves to fly to their Sabbaths.*

*In the afternoon, I walked out of the house to my garden. I looked around to make sure no one was watching me, and I started to dig up the plants. Mary Hobbs and Tamsin Dane happened to pass by, and they saw what I was doing. I was destroying their works in progress. The girls looked away as if they saw nothing, and hurried along to their destination. I knew they were going to do something.*

*What frightened me most was not knowing exactly what they would do.*

*At the end of the last Sabbath meeting in May, Mary and Tamsin ran, screaming, into the meetinghouse. They were stuck with pins and needles all over their bodies, as if they were a witch’s poppets.*

*As Dr. Barnard removed the pins and needles, Mr. Pearson asked,* “Who did this to you?”

*Groaning in pain, the girls cried out,* “Betsy Noyes!”

*I could feel the colour drain from my face. Mr. Pearson and the congregation looked at Betsy. My oldest child, only ten years old. She started to cry as the authorities approached her. I tried to guard her with my body, but I was pushed out of the way by the Sheriff. She was detained as an accused witch, and taken away. John held me as I sobbed. My child. This was their revenge. They went after my child to get at me. John and I were denied permission to see our daughter, so he tended to Martha and John, Jr. at home, while I spent the night in a ditch near the jail to be near Betsy.*

*Betsy was examined publicly by the magistrates on the following day. She looked frightened, but she answered their questions as well as a child could.*

“What do you say to the charges brought against you by Mary Hobbs and Thomasin Dane?”

“I do not know what to say.”

“Are you innocent or guilty?”

*She hesitated. As she bit her lip out of nervousness, the afflicted girls accused her of forcing them to bite their own lips.*

“What do you say now, Ms. Noyes?”

*Tears trickling down her cheeks, she repeated,* “I do not know what to say.”

*The magistrate roared in response.*

“Are you innocent or are you guilty?”

*Terrified, Betsy cried,* “I am sorry. I have hurt them. I can see clearly now.”

*What was she doing?*

“You have confessed to witchcraft. Is that the truth?”

“Yes,” *Betsy cried.* “Yes, ’tis the truth.”

*She was lying. Betsy was no witch. Who had filled her head with such lies?*

“Who taught you the detestable art of witchcraft?” *The magistrate asked.*

*Betsy stammered as the magistrate looked at me.*

“My mother,” *Betsy answered.*

*I was in shock. Why would she accuse me of being a witch? Did the girls tell her to do so? Was* this *their revenge?*

*All of the afflicted girls cried out,* “Goody Noyes has sent her spectre to hurt us!”

*As the girls screamed in terror, I was detained by the authorities as an accused witch.*

*After they finished questioning Betsy, I was examined by the magistrates. I did not answer any of their many questions. Eventually, I taken to jail, chained in a cell with other accused witches. I was refused permission to see Betsy, who was being held in another cell.*

*On the following day, I was taken from my cell by the jailers, who delivered me to a jury of matrons in a room within the jail. I was not asked to undress. My clothes were stripped from my body. I was instructed to stand still as the women inspected my entire form. It was humiliating. One of the matrons exclaimed,* “She has a mark!”

*The matrons poked and prodded at a corner of my back, which I knew had a freckle on it.*

“’Tis the Devil’s mark.”

*The jury of matrons agreed that the freckle was my “Devil’s mark,” a mark from which the Devil would suck my blood. ’Twas not true, but they did not care.*

*As they continued to inspect my body, one of the matrons announced,* “Goody Noyes is pregnant.”

*Another one of the matrons asked,* “’Is this true?”

*I nodded my head. The matrons returned my clothes to me, and I put them back on. After I was returned to the chains in my cell, I was informed that my trial, as well as the trials of five other women and one man, were set for the following month.*

*’Twas around a week later. My cellmates and I were awoken early in the morning by the jailers, who unchained us, and led us out of our cells. What were they doing? Our hands and feet were shackled as we left the jail. As we started walking, I realised we were being led to Gallows Hill, a mound outside of Eden Village proper, where criminals and miscreants were hanged, and buried in the unconsecrated earth.*

*One of the jailers yelled,* “You shall see what comes to those who do not confess.”

*They were taking us to Gallows Hill to intimidate us into confessing ourselves as witches.*

“This is what becomes of those who do not repent.”

*We stopped in front of a large oak tree, on which rested a ladder. There were five nooses hanging from one of the largest branches of the tree. An ox–cart, carrying Goody Jacobs, Goody Oliver, Goody Williams, as well as two other women, was next to the tree. Goody Jacobs and Goody Williams went to their deaths without a word. However, Mr. Pearson was still imploring Goody Oliver to confess,* “Confess, and save your immortal soul.”

*Goody Oliver did not confess. She cried out from the ox–cart,* “Shut up!” *She was led from the ox–cart to the ladder.* “I am no witch. You know this to be true. And, by God, Reverend, you shall have my blood upon your head!” *Turned off the ladder, Goody Oliver died as she had lived.*

*As we watched the five bodies hanging from the tree, the women were cut down from the branch, and they were buried. No prayers. No markers. Nothing. It was as if they had never existed.*

*The trial of Alse Sheldon was held at the end of June, concurrently with the trials of four other women. The accused witches who were awaiting their own trials were taken, shackled, to the meetinghouse, as another form of intimidation to confess. Goody Sheldon pleaded “Not Guilty.” Her accusers testified under oath about her sundry acts of witchcraft. One of her accusers was Goody* [Mary] *Hubbard, who testified that her husband was stricken by a mysterious illness shortly after an argument with Goody Sheldon and her husband over property lines. John Hubbard died in a “fit of Convulsions” soon after he fell ill. However, there were villagers who came to Goody Sheldon’s defence. Goody* [Sarah] *Porter, Goody Hubbard’s sister–in–law, testified that her brother had “fits of Epilepsy” for years. Dr. Barnard did not testify, but he had previously determined John Hubbard’s death to have been caused by “epileptic Fits.” Her trial lasted three days. The jury deliberated for a day before they returned with their verdict.*

*“Not Guilty.”*

*Nearly deaf, Goody Sheldon was initially unaware that she had been found “Not Guilty.” There was a cry of joy from her husband and children.*

*However, screams soon erupted from the afflicted girls, who cried,* “Goody Sheldon has sent her spectre to us! She says she fooled the judge and jury! She commands us to sign the Devil’s book!” *The girls ran around the meetinghouse, purportedly avoiding Goody Sheldon’s spectre.*

*The judge led the jury into his chambers, and, after an hour of further deliberation, they returned to their places in the meetinghouse.*

*The judge asked,* “Do you have any questions for the accused?”

*The foreman of the jury nodded his head, and he asked a question of his own,* “Goody Sheldon, what did you mean when you said Goody Hobbs, who has confessed herself a witch, was ‘one of us?’”

*Goody Sheldon did not answer the question, which was probably because she did not hear it. Nevertheless, the jury was swayed.*

*The judge asked,* “Having reconsidered the evidence, how do you find?”

*The foreman of the jury answered,* “‘Guilty.’”

*To the horror of her family and friends, the judge sentenced Goody Sheldon to death by hanging.*

*There was a part of me that wanted to tell whomever would listen, the jailers, the judges, the elders of the church, anyone, that their pure and darling girls were nothing more than whores of the Devil. Goody Sheldon was innocent. Those girls were not. Yet I said nothing, because I knew that the authorities would not believe me.*

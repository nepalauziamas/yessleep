When I was nineteen, I put a lot of effort and practice into teaching myself how to pee into a bottle with proper precision and elegance. [When you live in Raw,](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/iodi9u/tales_from_a_small_town_i_know_the_secret_of_the/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) having a weak bladder can really screw you over in so many ways. Take me as an example. 

I don't know why, but I can't go an hour without running for the toilet somedays it seems. That's especially problematic when I need to take trips into the mountain range. Those are risky enough in themselves but one time, I ran into trouble for real. 

It was a warm late summer night and Donovan had told me to take a bag of leftover meat from the past week's meals into the mountains. There's a special spot there where we always dump some food every now and then in hopes of satisfying the monsters' hunger so they won't feel the need to come creeping into town again. Going there at night is of course not the safest thing to do, but during the day it's simply impossible due to the heat. We had already laid out a good portion of leftovers the week before that, so we all felt like it was alright for someone to set out.

I had volunteered for the task and Donovan had advised me to take one of the dogs with me. I of course chose Hades. He's the largest and strongest one and also my favorite. I love all of our dogs dearly and they definitely feel the same–I get along with most animals very well for some reason–but I've taken care of Hades since he was just a small puppy and unlike Eden, he's just stayed close to me ever since. 

So there I was with a smelly bag full of old food, my guard dog by my side and my earbuds in, starting on my little journey. I had taken a bottle of water since the heat would have me running risk of growing weak without a proper refreshment. Donovan had insisted I take a handgun, but to be honest, I'm not good at using these so I knew I'd simply be carrying it around with me as extra weight. I brought it with me, sure, but I left it in my handbag, hoping it'd go just like the other times and I wouldn't have to get it out at all.

I had refused to take a flashlight since it would only draw attention to me and I knew the way by heart already. The moon was bright enough to illuminate the path ahead of me and I was in no hurry. I was listening to some podcast, slowly climbing up the steep hills with Hades following close behind or, whenever the path was wide enough, right next to me. From time to time, he would rub his snout against my hand or sniff the bag, hoping to get a small treat himself. All in all, it was simply a nice little stroll to him. I myself was careful but relaxed. I had done this before, nothing had gone wrong then. The podcast was on quietly enough for me to clearly hear my own footsteps, which is a good measurement by the way if you ever want to listen to something without losing track of what happens around you.

We soon reached the large flat rock protruding from the ground. This is where the path ends and also where we dump our offerings. Everything beyond that point is completely inaccessible. Right beside the rock, a single dry but sturdy tree grows from a crack in the stone. It's surrounded by thick, green bushes that probably draw their health from whatever rain falls down there now and then. I looked around, then hung my handbag up on one of the branches of the old, shriveled tree next to the stone. This would take a while. I got out the water bottle and took a good swig from it. I placed it on the ground beside me before going to work.

I unloaded the bag from my shoulder, nudging Hades aside as he tried to shove his way closer to the meaty leftovers. He gave me an insulted grunt before finally trotting off, apparently keeping an eye out behind me. With some effort, I undid the knot Donovan had sealed the bag with and tried not to breathe in the smell as I dumped the food rests onto the stone. I stopped mid-motion when I heard a quiet whistling sound. Two notes, one high-pitched and the other low, following right after the first one. I held still and listened, but only silence came after. I still had my earbuds in so I shrugged it off, figuring it had been background noise from the podcast and continued spreading the offerings.

I didn't bother taking the bag with me, the scent would only attract the creatures. I simply dropped it on the ground and turned around, ready to return home only to find that my dog wasn't behind me anymore. My heart sank.

"Hades?" I called out, trying to keep my voice low. I took out my earbuds and crammed them into my pocket with my phone. "Hades!" I whistled through my teeth. No sound came back from the dark mountains. I couldn't even hear the clicking of his nails or the patting of his paws on the ground. My pulse quickened as I looked around frantically. The moon was bright enough for me to see my surroundings clearly, but I still couldn't spot him anywhere. Of course, I instantly suspected the worst. Suddenly wishing for the revolver, I turned to grab my handbag from the tree only to find that it had disappeared.

I searched the ground underneath the tree but it wasn't anywhere in sight. It hadn't fallen down, that much was for sure.

"Who's there?" I asked firmly into the darkness. Nobody answered.

The severity of my situation was starting to sink in. I was on my own in the mountains with nothing to defend myself with except my dog which was nowhere to be seen and a bottle of water which would probably not be of much help. Worse yet, by then I was certain that there was somebody else with me. I wasn't alone and in light of how dangerous this was, whoever was around had probably worse intentions than simply giving me a good scare.

Nothing like this had ever happened before, even though I felt like I'd done this about a hundred times. Standing out in the open all alone like this, I couldn't help but feel utterly exposed. I knew I had to get home as soon as possible, but there was no way I'd leave Hades behind. He had never run off before and usually, he would listen to me calling him without me once having to repeat myself. 

"Hades?" I whisper-shouted again, taking out my phone to use its flashlight. I tried to keep the beam as low as possible as I aimed it at the darker spots around me I couldn't see. This too yielded no results and I was slowly starting to panic. "Hades, heel!" Nothing. *Shit.*

In my mind, there was no way he could have ventured past the flat stone, so I turned my attention towards the row of bushes. After a bit of searching, I stumbled upon a small trail that had previously been obscured by the branches and leaves. The ground was sandy and dry in that spot, but I could make out a faint pawprint in the dirt. I knew I had to go after him. I hurriedly typed out a quick message to Siobhan, telling her I'd lost Hades and was looking for him in the mountains. I told her to send one of the men with a gun to the offering site and hoped that she'd read the text before anything worse could happen. 

I want to be clear here, waiting it out wasn't an option. It was only a matter of time until the smell of the meat would attract the creatures. I know I could have walked home and without my gun, it was probably the safer and smarter option anyways, but the thought of something happening to Hades was too much to bear. 

My first steps on the small trail were hesitant and unsteady. The thorns of the surrounding bushes were scraping my naked shins and ankles as I made my way through the thicket. Now and then I would stand still to whistle and quietly call out to Hades. All was silent at first until I suddenly heard him whimper. My heart jumped and I tried to pinpoint the direction the sound had come from, but to no avail. Taking a deep breath, I gathered my courage to speak up.

"Listen, this isn't funny. You can keep my handbag if you want, but give me back my dog!" I shouted. It came out louder than I had intended and I instantly regretted saying anything at all. 

And then I heard it. A low growl coming from right behind me. It wasn't Hades though. I slowly turned around. 

I don't think I've ever described the creatures from the mountains. I mentioned the one I saw in Foul but I already said back then that they aren't the same. Better late than never, I suppose. 

The creatures from the mountains come in a lot of variety. They always resemble certain animals, but it's never that exact thing. The one that stood before me right then was small, about the size of a wolf and of approximately the same physique. However it had no hair whatsoever and it's limbs looked oddly stretched out. Its head was probably the most noticeable about the beast. It had no lips, nothing covered its white gums and long, yellowed teeth. 

I backed off, stumbling and landing on my butt. It hurt but I tried not to wince. The creature's growl grew louder but it didn't make its move just yet. I slowly pushed myself off the ground and rose to my feet again, careful not to make eye contact. If it wouldn't see me as a threat, maybe it'd leave me alone. I stood there, staring at the bush behind the wolf, not daring to move. 

Suddenly, I could hear a loud rustling noise behind me. The wolf seemed to take this as its cue. It lunged forward, only to collide with something black and brown mid-air. I recognized him immediately. 

"Hades!" I called out. 

The dog responded with a bark as it overthrew the beast. For just a few seconds, the path was clear and I burst from my rigidity and shouted out to Hades once more. This time, he followed. The thing was still lying on the ground. Hades seemed to have wounded it. Fortunately, he didn't appear to be injured himself. Still, I could hear it howl and scramble to its feet in the background. We had no choice but to keep running.

Making our way down the gravel path as fast as we could was bad enough, but with the drumming of paws approaching from behind, my heart was beating like a sledgehammer. Finally spotted the familiar silhouette of a broad older man down at the foot of the hill. It was Donovan, seemingly holding a shotgun. Upon noticing me and Hades running towards, of course still followed by our merciless pursuer, he raised it and a shot rang out. I could hear the thing howl behind me, then a thump as it fell. 

I slowed down instantly. Gasping and panting, I stumbled into my father's arms. He gave me some words of comfort as he patted my back. He had placed his gun on the ground and was caressing Hades's head with his other hand.

"How'd you hit it at such a distance?" I asked upon pulling back. It was only then that I noticed the disturbed loon on his face. 

"I didn't. It just dropped dead."

I found my handbag hanging on the branch of one of our apple trees the next morning. 

Of course, this whole thing had nothing to do with the bottle-pee-story. That one is highly personal, I just thought it'd make for a good start into this.

My best friend, Louis, and I were out biking our usual paths through the woods like we did every Saturday of the summer. But this time, there was a new path that forked off from the other. 

It went into thick woods that we’d never explored because of the density of trees. 

But then, all of a sudden, there was a new bike trail. Louis and I decided to double back and check it out. 

The path was clear and wide for the first several hundred meters. But it started narrowing and more and more roots were taking over the trail. Just as we were about to turn back, we saw a clearing ahead. And something large hovering a dozen feet up.

As we got closer, it became clear we were looking at a treehouse. A very well put together one at that. It had a wooden, spiral staircase that led up to a wide, octagon shaped structure with cut-out windows. 

It was unlike anything I’d ever seen. 

Louis and I approached it cautiously, figuring there was someone or *someone’s* inside. Louis, who was the braver and more adventurous, called out loudly with a simple, “Hello?” 

There was no response. No voices or shifts in movement or floorboards creaking. It was empty.

Louis was off his bike first and moved closer to the treehouse. I joined him inspecting the impressive structure.

But that wasn’t close enough for Louis. And before I knew it, he was halfway up the spiral stairs.

And I was following. 

Inside, there was a wide open space. The walls were covered with shelves filled with books and photographs. There were clothes hanging from hooks and folded in dressers.

There were no people though. It was just Louis and I.

Louis noticed it first. I saw his eyes go wide as he looked around. The books, photographs and clothes became familiar. 

I approached one of the walls. 

I was in all of the photos. The books were the same ones that lined the shelves in my room. As were the clothes hanging from hooks and folded in dressers. 

On the other side of the treehouse, Louis was staring at his photos, books and clothes. 

We backed up into each other in the middle of the room. I was the first one to say it was time to leave, but Louis was already making his way to the trap-door down that led to the staircase. 

Only the trap-door was no longer there. 

It was on the opposite side of the room. We climbed down the staircase to where we left our bikes. 

But they were gone. 

They weren’t on the other side of the tree or tipped over nearby. 

They’d simply disappeared. Or been taken.  

This posed a serious problem because of how deep we were in the woods. Not only were we on an unknown path, but the afternoon sun had vanished. 

We did another look around, unbelieving that someone, somehow, had stolen our bikes while we were in the treehouse for all of two minutes. 

But that’s what it looked like happened. 

Still… we couldn’t explain the contents of the treehouse. And at the moment, we weren’t trying to. 

We started our way back down the trail on foot but it was winding and curving more than on the way in. It took us an hour to get back to the main path. 

It took us another half hour to get out of the park and back to the entrance. From there, we had to split up as we lived in different directions. We were both already late for dinner and knew our parents were going to be pissed, so we said our goodbyes and took off. 

It took me another forty five minutes to walk home. And when I finally got there… I saw something that shook me to my core.

My bike was chained up in its normal place along the side of our house. 

I walked up to it and inspected it. The chain was looped through the front wheel and spokes the same way I always did it. 

I started doubting whether or not I even brought it on the ride. If somehow I’d imagined everything. 

But as I walked past the dining room window on my way to the front door… I saw something more disturbing than the bike.

I saw *me*. 

I was sitting at the table with my family. Only… it wasn’t me. 

The version of me at the table looked like I’d been flipped. My hair was split and combed over on the right side as opposed to the left. And I was using my left hand to eat with my fork instead of my right. 

I watched the mirror version of me eating and interacting with my family. Smiling, laughing, talking. He fit in perfectly. Almost.

Then he locked eyes with me. And the smile disappeared. 

Only for a moment. But in that moment I saw hatred and anger. Then it was gone and he rejoined the conversation. 

I watched my mirror version stealthily slide his dinner knife into his sleeve as he laughed at one of my dad’s jokes.

I had a feeling the knife was for me. 

I had to get away from there.

I rushed over to my bike and unlocked the combo. I was at full speed heading down the street within seconds. 

Behind me, I heard the front door of my house open and shut. 

I didn’t turn back. 

I pedalled faster and ten minutes later, I was pulling up to Louis’. 

There, just like mine, was Louis’ bike, locked up along the side of his house in the same manner as always. 

I had a plan to go in and get Louis. He’d know what to do. 

Louis’ dad answered the door and invited me in. 

I noticed it immediately. 

Louis was sitting at the table with his family. Only he was different. The cleft lip he had scarred downward on the right. 

The Louis sitting at the table had a scar that went left. 

It was a mirror version of Louis. And no one in his family could tell. 

Between him and I, you can tell how little attention was paid to us. But we had big families. 

When Other Louis looked up and saw me, he knew I knew. I saw the same brief flash of hatred and anger take over his face. But it was shoved aside and replaced by a fake smile. 

I joined them at the table, and Louis’ mom brought me a plate. 

Outside, I saw movement in the window. It was me. Other Me. He was here. 

I felt trapped. I had nowhere to go.

Then I got an idea. 

Over the next few minutes, I gradually keeled over more and more and started rubbing my stomach. I asked if Louis’ dad could drive me home. He agreed. 

Outside as he walked me to the car, I turned and saw Other Me hiding along the siding of the house. Watching. 

The drive there became increasingly tense as I started to wonder if my family was okay. Who knew what those mirror versions of us would do?

But I got home and my family was okay. I kept up with the *pretending to be sick charade* and went upstairs to lay down. 

From my bedroom window, I watched Other Me outside pacing in the shadows. Soon after, he was joined by Other Louis.

I was trying to figure out a plan to make it through the night when something small crashed through my window. It wasn’t very loud and no one came to check on me so I guessed everyone downstairs didn’t hear.

I picked up the projectile, which turned out to be a rock, and found it wrapped in paper. There was a message written on the inside of it. 

*Come out by midnight. Or we come in and kill everyone.* 

It was 9 o’clock at that point. So I had three hours to figure it out. 

I went over the arsenal in the house. Which was none. My dad didn’t have a gun. Most of his tools were in the garage that was not attached to the house. 

I only had close combat weapons. 

Except… there *was* one thing. Just one. It popped in my mind and stuck. I knew it would work as a weapon or at least a distraction. 

I formed a plan. 

I’d come to the realization that Louis was dead, killed by this Other Louis. And my twin was trying to kill me to replace me for whatever purpose. 

Two things were clear. The first was they wanted me dead. The second was the only way to stop that, was to kill them first. 

With the idea I had, I waited until quarter to midnight before getting my supplies. With my secret weapon hidden inside one of my larger coats, I grabbed two knives from the kitchen. I planned to use them, but hoped I wouldn’t have to. If I even had it in me to do so. 

I went to the window and watched the two outside. They’d spent most of the night on opposing sides of the house, but would occasionally join each other on one end and talk. 

They were in the backyard. So I went to the front door, and took off down the street. 

I knew it wouldn’t be long before they saw me and started to chase me. But I just needed to get four blocks to the kids park nearby. Which would be the most empty place in the neighbourhood at this time of night. 

My secret weapon rubbed against my chest, but I kept going. As I passed the halfway point, I turned back to check.

They’d seen me. And they were in a full sprint to catch me. 

I had them beat though. I had just enough of a head start to turn into the park and find my way to the back courtyard. I ran towards the bathroom shelter and went into the boys room. 

I rushed to the far wall and pressed my back against it. I had the two knives in my jacket pocket, but it wasn’t time for them yet. 

My left hand moved inside my jacket, holding the handle of the secret weapon. 

The bathroom door kicked open and the twins burst in. They slowed when they saw me looking like a cornered mouse with nowhere to go. 

Other Me led the way, pulling the dinner knife from his sleeve. Closely over his shoulder, Other Louis did the same.

They moved in on me without a word spoken. 

My left hand tightened on the handle of my secret weapon, and I lifted my right arm, straightening it and pointing my hand at eye level to the attackers. 

Taped to the inside of my jacket, was our house’s fire extinguisher. My left handle held the clasp handle, and the hose looped through my sleeve, with the nozzle just exiting out from my cuff. 

Before the twins could stop, I squeezed the handle and held it down. 

The stream hit both of them directly in the face, mouth and eyes. I shifted to the side, continuing the spray, but wanting to keep my location moving. 

They both went down, clutching at their faces and screaming. 

But the screams didn’t sound like they came from human vocal cords. They were croaky and shrill at the same time. 

I wanted to move in on them with the knives I’d brought, but the fire extinguisher had done more than temporarily impair them. 

The fire extinguisher sputtered out, empty. The smoke that filled the bathroom began to settle. 

The twins were twitching, spasming out. Green foam was pouring from their mouths. It just kept coming. Their limbs started to stiffen. 

Then they started changing. 

Their skin was peeling away and the inside looked like bark. Strange roots and brambles sprouted up from underneath. 

The human form they once had disappeared as they transformed into something unrecognizable. A frightening and warped series of noughts and rotten bark covering lengths of branch. 

That was what they were underneath it all. 

  
  I left them as they were. Whoever found that mass of impossible growths in that park bathroom wouldn’t be able to tell what they were or used to be. Hopefully they ended up in a green bin. 

I never heard more about it. Of course, Louis went “missing.” And I knew he’d never be found. That was heartbreaking to deal with, watching his family search for him. I never even knew what happened to his body. 

Eventually I grew up. 

But I never forgot. Which is why I bring this all up now… 

My son and his best friends go on long bike trips through the woods. 

And when my son returned home this evening, the crooked central incisor on the left side of his upper jaw… was now on the right.

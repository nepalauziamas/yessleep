It was a normal day at the office, back in full swing after months of working from home. The ambience was buzzing with phone calls and the tapping of keyboards, but you could still hear my boss Glynn's roaring laughter coming from his private office (with the door closed). He had one of those obnoxiously loud voices that bellowed across the floor like an overacting thespian. 

I was wrapping up a sales call, big grin on my face as the commission alone would pay for my next holiday. Hanging up the phone I sat in smug silence, tilting back on my chair and resting my hands behind my head. I've never been one for showmanship. Some of the dicks on that floor were prone to a little desk dancing, or a high-five lap of the room when they closed a sale. It's cringe as fuck! 

No, I'm not a complete misery and yes, I am fun at parties. I've just never really fit in with the copy paste office type. 

Staring at the beige ceiling my mind carried me away to an exotic daydream. A white sandy beach and crystal clear ocean, cocktails made from fresh fruit that grew nearby, getting hot in a hammock with a handsome companion, a monotonous *BLEEP BLEEP* repeating over and over and over...

I snapped out of my trance. It was Glynn's extension. I rolled my eyes and decided it could wait, for all he knew I was on another line. But as I looked up his blinds were open and he was standing at his office window, staring at me. I quickly picked up the phone, nearly dropping it in my flustered state. 

"Glynn, what can I do for you?" 

My eyes moved away from his office, looking down at my desk to a doodle of a cat I'd drawn whilst on the previous call. 

"Dean!" he shouted down the phone like I was a friend he hadn't heard from in years. "Come see me, got something for ya." 

With that he hung up. I sighed and began mentally preparing myself for our interaction. One to one with Glynn was always a chore. I took a deep breath and walked to his office, opening the door and stepping inside. It smelt of cheap cologne with underlying body odour. He was so wretched. As per, his top lip was dotted with sweat, as were the receding patches of his hairline. His drooping cheeks were the constant red of a slapped ass. He was sitting at his desk looking down at his mobile phone. 

"Glynn?" I said, standing with my hands behind my back like a schoolboy in the headteacher's office. He carried on looking down. I could hear sickly-sweet music and various joyful sound effects. My best bet, he was playing Candy Crush or one of its rivals. 

"You fucking anyone at the moment?" he asked, not looking up. I bit my tongue and looked up, this was typical Glynn. I swear he must have had something over the directors because there's no way a fucking pig like that had a job under normal circumstances. I shook my head in disbelief. 

"Glynn, what do you want?" I said, not in the mood for his shit. 

"Just playing with ya'self, are ya?" He lifted one hand to give me the jerk-off gesture before erupting into deafening laughter. He put his phone on the desk. "Ah, ya know I'm just joshin' with ya. Lighten up ya big bender!" 

I smiled sarcastically. "You know you're a real piece of shit, don't you?" 

He chuckled. "Yeah. And just to prove it, here." 

He picked up a hefty file and threw it at my feet. I looked down; it was the Bramley account. 

"Right," I said, confused. "And?" 

"You're workin' overtime tonight fella," he smiled. "Potential discrepancies blah blah blah. You know the drill." 

I put a hand on my forehead, feeling a headache coming on. This was my punishment for starting the day on a high, it rarely lasts in this place. I looked at his large, round, sweaty red face, huge smile on his lips. Rage began to rise in my stomach and I just wanted to pounce, leap over his desk and... 

"Cheers Deano," he said, picking up his phone again. "On my desk tomorrow mornin', fella." 

I stood motionless for a while before bending down to pick up the file, the music playing from his phone plucking at my nerves.As I turned my head I noticed something under Glynn's desk. It was a baby's bottle with a rubber teet, and it looked like there was milk in it. Last time I checked this pig had no piglets, a blessing really. I found it highly unlikely someone would willingly fuck him. It was weird. 

"Fine," I said. "Unrelated, what's with the bottle?" I pointed under his desk. 

He looked up, visibly embarrassed. His cheeks turned an even darker shade crimson. It was novel seeing Glynn so uncomfortable as he usually had no self respect at all. 

"What are you talking about?" he said. I could see he was trying to flip the bottle with his feet to move it from view. 

"There's a baby's bottle under your desk." 

He squirmed in his seat, his discomfort was quite entertaining. He suddenly gave a fake look of amusement. 

"Oh, that. It's my nephew's. My sister visited and left it at mine, I'm taking it to her later. Anyway, piss off ya nosey bastard!" 

I nodded. It was a lie. That being said I really didn't care to learn the truth. I left his office and hurried back to my desk. As I sat down I discreetly looked over to Glynn's window. He was sitting still, his mouth covered by a hand. I'd never seen him look so contemplative, he looked almost human. He eventually stood up to close his blinds, briefly looking at me before he was hidden from sight. 

That evening I sat down for dinner with only my British Shorthair cat, Molly, for company. I was on the sofa with a plate of carbonara watching *Stranger Things*. Molly had a bowl of tuna and jumped up to join me when she'd finished, staring at my plate and licking her lips. 

"You greedy bitch," I laughed. She gently tapped the edge of my plate with her paw. I took a piece of bacon and held it out to her. It was gone instantly. I know it's a bad practice but I don't give a shit. My pet, my rules. 

"You want some s'getti, Molls?" I cut a piece of spaghetti and dangled it like a fishing line. She chomped it down like I used to chomp strawberry licorice as a kid.

"That's all you're getting fatty." I patted her on the head and finished my meal. 

It got to around 20:00 and I went to grab a beer from the fridge, which meant Molly would want a bowl a milk. As I picked up the milk bottle it reminded be of Glynn. My stomach dropped; I had totally forgotten to bring the Bramley file home with me. 

"Fuck!" I yelled into the kitchen. Molly started mewing and brushed against my legs. No beer for me, but I poured a small bowl of milk and set it on the floor. 

"Sorry Molls, gotta go 'cos daddy's boss is a cunt. Back soon."

I grabbed my keys and headed back to the office in my car. The building was mostly dark with a couple of lit windows here and there. I used my access card to get in the main door and waved at Jen, our security guard who was sitting at the front desk. 

"Evening Jen, you good?" 

She raised a hand and nodded. "Late one for you, Dean. Up to no good?" She laughed. 

I sighed. "Have to grab a file that his highness insists I work on tonight. Bloody forgot it, didn't I?" 

She chuckled. "No rest for the wicked as they say." 

"Yel! Underneath this handsome exterior I'm green and pointy!" I made claws with my hands. She laughed, it echoed around the empty reception hall and she covered her mouth like a naughty child. 

"Stop it, you," she said, trying to calm herself down. I called the lift and stepped inside, pressing floor 5. 

"See you shortly, my pretty," I said, followed by my best cackle. I could hear her howls of laughter getting quieter as I ascended. Jen was good people, she made me smile. 

The *ding* confirmed I had reached floor 5. There were a few dim safety lights on but that's it. I headed to my desk and grabbed the file, which I'd subconsciously covered with my morning's success paperwork and a film magazine. I sighed at the thought of having to sit up until the early hours, but at least at home I could have some Curtis Mayfield in the background. 

As I turned to leave I heard a muffled sound coming from Glynn's office. Turning back I noticed a soft glow emanating from behind the closed blinds. In hindsight I should have just left it, but curiosity got the better of me. I had to see why the hell Glynn was still in the office when he'd made me work extra from home this evening. 

With the Bramley file tucked under my arm, I approached the office. It was a corner office with glass walls, however the blinds covered the entire length of them. I could hear the faint sound of a lullaby. I suddenly got goosebumps all over my arms and a shiver ran down my spine. It reminded me of those horror films where the protagonist stumbles across the ghost of a child. But, I continued to investigate against my better judgement. 

On the closest side to me there was an ever so slight gap where two of the blinds had got caught up together. It was barely and inch, though it looked wide enough to peek inside. The music was clearer now, it was a familiar tune that I couldn't quite put my finger on. Something like *Twinkle Twinkle Little Star* or *Baa Baa Black Sheep*. 

I had to crouch as the gap was low down. Peering through, the first thing I noticed was the source of the glow. There was a large rabbit shaped nightlight sitting on a chair. As I shook my head in confusion I saw movement off to the side, then I almost stumbled backwards. 

Glynn was laying on his desk, naked apart from a large white nappy around his waist and a pink bonnet on his head. His jiggly body had a sweaty sheen to it. My free hand reached up to cover my mouth as I whispered *"What the fuck?"*. 

The music was coming from one of those crib mobiles that gently rotates as fluffy animals dangle. It was hanging from the ceiling over his head. He looked up at it as he drank from a teeted bottle, his legs occasionally kicking up in an excitable way. He was making stereotypical goo goo ga ga sounds. 

I was in need of eyebleach. As I prepared to leave as quietly as possible the music came to a stop, and Glynn dropped the bottle from his chubby fingers. He started to whimper and stretched out his arms as if to try and reach the mobile. His legs started to kick out more before he broke down into a full temper tantrum, screaming into his office. My blood ran cold. 

Then suddenly, silence. Like a switch. Glynn calmly sat up on the desk and reached up to the mobile, momentarily breaking character. As he started to wind up the mobile he looked in my direction, our eyes briefly meeting. I couldn’t tell if he could see me, but it was enough to make me almost shit myself.

I dropped the Bramley file and fell onto my ass. I could hear Glynn scurrying around inside. I panicked. The file was right there in front of me just within reach, but I was more focused on hiding. I launched myself backwards in a temporary crab position before flipping over and crawling down one of the aisles, taking sanctuary under a desk. I put my arms around my knees and pulled them to my chest, trying to remain still. 

After a few seconds I heard his office door open and the warm glow spread further onto the floor, his long shadow intimidating. I pressed my lips together and breathed as quietly as I could through my nose. His shadow shrunk as he bent down. He'd picked up the file. 

"Is that you, Dean?" he asked, not his usual bellowing self. The calmness of his voice was unnerving. I couldn't keep hiding, he knew it was me. I began to crawl out from under the desk, ready to embrace the awkwardness and swear myself to secrecy. 

"You'd best come out, Deano. I can be a nasty fucker when I throw my toys out of the pram." 

I paused on all fours; front half in the aisle, back half under the desk. Without warning there was a loud crash as something landed nearby, spilling various items of stationary into the aisle. A few sheets of paper glided through the air. I figured it was the Bramley file. I let out a gasp and crawled a little further, finding a different desk to hide under. I was breathing heavily, I couldn't control it.

Then I heard a rattle. A baby's toy rattle.

"Glynny no like this game," he said in a childish voice. My stomach dropped, it was disturbing on a whole new level. I could hear the rattle shaking as he moved across the floor.

"Glynny no like hide and seek." He sounded close to tears, like a child who can't have their way. Every so often I could hear the rattle slam on top of a desk, making me flinch. He was checking the desks one by one. 

"Dean is no fun," he said, his voice sounding closer to me. I looked across the office floor, I wasn't too far away from the doors to the staircase. 

"Dean is mean!" It was louder, frustrated. I took a few deep breaths and scrambled from under the desk, staying low and moving fast.

"DEAN IS MEAN!" He screamed through the office. I heard the rattle land somewhere off to my right, followed by the sounds of other objects hitting the floor. I felt on the verge of a panic attack. 

Just as I reached the door, I felt a sharp pain on the top of my head. I screamed out as a stapler landed by my side. I threw myself through the doors and ran as fast as I could down five flights of stairs. How I didn't trip and break my neck I'll never know. I could feel a cool wetness dripping down the side of my head as the wound bled out. 

I burst through the doors into reception and startled poor Jen. 

"What in the..." she started. "Hey, what happened to you?" 

My breathing was out of control. "Jen... we gotta go... come on..." I grabbed her arm but she pulled away. 

"Hang on a minute..." 

I ran for the front doors. "Please, Jen! Get out of here!" 

I felt bad but I couldn't hang around. My legs didn't stop until I got to my car. I put my foot down and drove until my heart began to beat at a more regular pace. 

Most of the night was spent in a diner drinking bad coffee, replaying the events. I had cleaned my head wound as best as I could with, ironically, baby wipes. I kept a packet in the glove box to wipe my hands after refuelling. I also had a baseball cap in the boot so I wouldn't look too disconcerting to the public. 

I was unsure whether or not it was a matter for the police. I mean, he had threatened and attacked me. So probably. But I just wanted to get home and sleep. I arrived back after midnight.

My flat door was ajar. The lock was broken and part of the wooden frame was damaged. Adrenaline pulsed through my veins. My trembling hand pushed the door open to reveal my hallway. My umbrella was leaning against the wall so I picked it up. Beggars can't be choosers; anything can be a weapon.

I crept down the hall listening for any movement. When I got to the kitchen I peeked inside the doorway. There was blood smeared across the floor tiles and splashed over the worktops. My eyes were wide with horror. I dropped the umbrella and ran inside, knowing exactly what I would find. 

Molly. He'd butchered my cat. 

"No!" I screamed, collapsing to the floor and scooping her into my arms. I closed my eyes as tears fell. I couldn't believe this was happening, it all could have been avoided if I'd only brought that fucking file home! I kissed the top of her head and placed her in her basket. 

"I'm sorry, Molls," I said, walking like a zombie through the living room. Taking my phone out of my pocket, I had every intention of calling the police. But I paused before dialing. There was a scrappy piece of paper sitting on my dining table. Written in blood: 

*bad kitty hurt glynny* 

My girl Molly had tried to fight that detestable cunt, rest her soul. I decided the police wouldn't cut it. Instead, I went to the closet and pulled out a driver from my dust covered golf bag. It was a very short lived hobby, but now it would come in handy. I was fully prepared to bust open Glynn's fat, sweaty, bonnet clad head.

I drove to his grand house just outside the city. His gated driveway was already open, but as I looked closer it had actually been damaged. Someone had driven through it, and by the state of Glynn's A8 parked on the flower bed I had a good idea who. 

I skidded to a halt and grabbed the golf club, stepping out of my car. His front door was slightly open and I pushed it hard, entering. 

"Where are you motherfucker?" I screamed out, looking around my immediate vicinity. The staircase was directly to my right, so I decided to check upstairs first. I got about halfway when I heard a sound from downstairs, like a muffled whimper. So I turned around and went back down.

I poked my head into the first room on the left, a large sitting room with an open fireplace. It was empty. 

"Glynn!" I shouted, walking down the hallway. I slammed the club onto the wooden floorboards, the vibrations hurt my hands. "Come out you cat murdering piece of shit!" 

As I got further down the hall I noticed something glistening under the dim lights. It was a small splash of blood, and right next to it was a tooth. An adult human tooth. It looked like a molar, wide with long, bloody roots. I crouched down. 

"Jesus fucking Christ," I said under my breath, unnerved. Then I spotted another. It was like some spin on Hansel & Gretel, I started following the trail of teeth until they led me to a swing door on the left of the hall. I could hear shuffling, and whining. I pressed the club against the door and swung it open. 

It was the kitchen, incredibly bright compared to the hallway. The first thing I noticed was a larger pool of blood on the light grey tiles, and about six teeth of different shapes and sizes. Then I heard the sound of something small and hard dropping on the floor, like a stone or a marble. 

I looked up. In the middle of the kitchen was a small island, and on the other side of it was Glynn. He had his back to me. The back of his head was covered by the bonnet, and he was still wearing the nappy. Patches of back hair clumped together from sweat. 

He was holding something to his mouth, he was breathing heavily and making guttural sounds from his throat. His arms quickly flung forward and I heard that sound again as something landed on the tiles. He was whimpering as he slowly lifted his hands back to his mouth. I grimaced.

"Turn around you sick fuck!" I said, holding up the club like a baseball bat. His body froze, then he slowly faced me. 

His chest and stomach were caked in blood, as well as his lower jaw. Fresh blood oozed from his chin and dripped like a leaking tap. There was a gash on one of his thighs, I assumed that's where my good girl Molly got him before he killed her. Inside his mouth was a pair of bloody pliers, and he was clamping them to one of his front teeth. From what I could see, it was one of his only remaining teeth. It was mostly just bloody gums.

I lowered the club and covered my mouth, feeling my stomach churn. Glynn stared at me in a nonchalant way, his hand shaking as he pulled and twisted the pliers. My nerves were shredded as I heard the metal pincers grind against enamel. His tooth became loose and his eyes narrowed a little. A deep gargling sound came from his throat, then an extended moan as the tooth began to leave his gums. I swear I could hear the strands of nerve endings *ping* as they could no longer hang on.

He dropped the tooth and his arms fell to his sides, more blood spilling from his lips as they trembled. He took deep breaths as he stared vacantly. Then he grinned wide, proudly displaying his toothless gums. My whole body went cold. 

He placed the pliers on the island then slowly turned, shuffling to the fridge. He bent down and opened the freezer door, then took out something blue. 

It was a teething ring. 

He brought it to his mouth, smiled, and closed his gums around it. His eyes rolled into the back of his head and he made childish, content noises. I was frozen to the spot, watching in morbid fascination. 

"Glynny feel better," he said, sliding down to the floor and suckling. 

I suddenly had no urge to bash his skull in and every urge to get the fuck out of his house. As I left the kitchen he sounded as happy as a pig in shit. 

I reported him as soon as I got home for assault, breaking and entering, and killing Molly. As it transpired, she wasn't the only victim. He had choked Jen to death with the rattle, she was found with it lodged in her throat.

The whole thing was swept under the rug. Upper management paid Jen's family for their silence, I was given a generous bonus and a promotion. Glynn was said to have left for 'personal reasons'. It eventually got out that he'd gone to prison, though no one else knew why.

Shockingly, he was deemed sane by several independent psychologists. I will never understand that. The mental images will forever be ingrained in my head. No amount of crystal clear waters and sex on the beach will ever stop me from picturing his bloody, gummy smile and that bonnet framing his chubby red face. 

One of the biggest injustices of the whole thing is that Glynn received government funded tooth implants. Those things are a luxury, and fucking expensive!

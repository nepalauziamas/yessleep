I thought they were just weird dreams at first. You know, just one of those instances where you have a vivid dream, one that you’d *swear* was real, only to wake up and say “Nope, none of that shit happened, go back to bed.” We’ve all had those, right?

I know *I* did anyways back in the day. Of course *they* were usually FAR more innocent and benign. A bit wacky, actually; like the one where I’m attending a comedy show, but with muppets being the comedians and the actual people taking their place as the ventriloquist dummies. This, though, is nothing like that, something I realized later on.

I think I was maybe 16 or 17 when it first happened. I remember it was a Friday night, I’d just gotten home from cheerleading at the football game. Everything had gone all nice and smooth like (even managing to get a little “under the bleachers time” with my crush at the time, Danny Rudd, after the game), and I was ending the night with a nice hot soak in the tub. My folks were out for the night, so I had the house to myself.

I remember feeling so relaxed, laying in the piping hot water, my head rested back and my eyes closed, that I was asleep before I even knew it. I guess that’s what really got to me at first, the fact that I didn’t *know* I was actually asleep. I just remember one minute, everything’s all fine, and the next, I’m seeing Danny being repeatedly stabbed.

It was abrupt. All of a sudden, I was seeing Danny, splayed out across the ground in a dark room, one I couldn’t make out any real features of, while a knife was being plunged into his chest over and over. Danny was convulsing violently, coughing up a fountain of blood. The last thing I saw was him slowly, shakily raise his arm, pleading for mercy as the knife came down again.

That’s when I started violently in the bathtub, almost springing straight to my feet. That caused me to slip and crack my head against the wall. I was fine, save obviously a *bitch* of a headache, but I was shaken up much worse with what’d just happened. It was almost 4:00 the next morning before I was able to actually fall asleep, constantly tossing and turning.

Every time I tried closing my eyes, I’d see Danny’s beaten, bloodied face, reaching out to me; to him, *WHOEVER* was holding the knife. See, that was another thing; I didn’t know exactly *what* it was I was seeing. In other words, I couldn’t tell if I’d just imagined it was *me* stabbing him, or if it was something else.

For the record, I’m NOT the kind of girl who’d fantasize some shit like that; getting my rocks off on killing my crush or anybody else for that matter. I wasn’t then, and I’m not now. I’m not a violent person, either (Hell, I’ve only gotten into fistfights and hair-snatching matches with my older sister, Megan). But then, what the hell *was* that?

At the time, I answered that question with the classic “Too much binging ‘Dateline’ late at night” excuse. I’d have probably stuck to that, too, except that the next morning, a breaking news report came on about a high school student being reported missing only a few hours ago. And, of course, who else’s photo and name appears but Danny’s.

*”... Witnesses say the missing boy, Daniel Preston Rudd, was last seen at a varsity football game at West Lincoln High. At this time, witnesses claim they didn’t remember seeing him leave. Authorities are continuing to search the area. If you’ve seen Daniel or have any leads as to his whereabouts, we urge you to please call and submit an anonymous tip at—“*

I turned the TV off. My stomach was cutting backflips. My heart was beating stupidly fast. *”Calm down.”* I told myself, *”He’s fine and you know it. He probably just went to the bar or something and got shit-faced and forgot to get one of his buddies to drive him home or something. Causing his mom, who just worries about everything, to call the police, thinking he’d been kidnapped or something. He’ll be fine.”* This managed to at least get me to slow down enough to breathe properly again. Still, though, I couldn’t stop thinking of the dream from last night.

Again, aside from how *real* it felt — that’s the only way I know to describe it; “real” — it was also just *completely* out of left field. And now this... Needless to say, my anxiety was well through the roof all day that day. I couldn't sit still, constantly pacing around wondering what could've happened to him. Not only that, but I was also in a frenzy wondering what, if *anything,* was I supposed to do. I felt like I was supposed to be out there, searching for him.

Finally, I worked up the belly to get up and start driving around, looking all around town for him. The first place I looked, naturally, was the school parking lot. The news said no one saw him leave. I drove into the parking lot and there it was, Danny's dad's Volkswagen, still parked in the middle of the student lot purposefully in between two of the parking spaces (something he thought made him look "cool").

Of course, there were cops there as well, and obviously, they weren't keen on the idea of me poking around there, either. Being the big badass bitch I *thought* I was back then, I told the officers exactly where they could shove it before attempting to run past them, only to be promptly caught and told to go back to my car and get off the campus or take a ride to the station with them, where they'd have to call Ma and Dad to have to come bail me out.

I relented and went back to my car, Flustered, making a point to flip them both barrels as I did. I was driving back home when it would happen again. This time, I knew for a fact that I'd not fallen asleep, either. This time, it was someone else from school; Sarah Keller, the captain of the cheerleading squad.

She was hanging upside down from the ceiling by her ankles, her hands tied behind her back. Just like Danny before, everything was dark aside from what looked like a single lamp that illuminated her suspended body. Her mouth was duct taped, too, muffling her screams as I saw the hand from before approach her with a power drill tightly clutched in it, pointing downward. *"What the hell?!"* I thought, my heart spiraling into yet another frenzy.

I watched the power drill then get plunged downward, straight down into... into...

*(Oh God)*

*In between her legs!*

I just briefly heard her muffled shrieks and saw a shower of blood as her body writhed before I was once again abruptly brought back to the real world. Because of this, I just narrowly avoided gift wrapping myself around a telephone pole by swerving into the ditch. For a moment, I just sat there, hyperventilating.

My entire body locked up, looking like a statue in the driver’s seat. My hands were locked so tight around the steering wheel that my knuckles were the color of a piece of paper by the time I’d even notice. My mind was locked in a three way tie between wanting to A, throw the car in reverse and start panic-searching for Sarah, B, put the car in reverse and book it straight back home and forget about all of this, hoping to *GOD* all the while that I really *was* just losing it here, or C, curl into a pathetic ball in my car and cry out of sheer hysteria (kinda what I was doing at that moment already).

In the end, I’d end up electing option B. Yeah, I *wanted* to know that my classmates were safe, but at the same time, how did I know they *actually* weren’t? Okay, yeah, Danny’s missing; but then again, that didn’t necessarily mean he’s in *danger*, right? Same thing with Sarah. *She* hadn’t been reported missing...

*Well, not yet...*

Like I said, I went straight home without anything else happening again. Regardless, I was still on edge the entire time. So much so that I didn't even wanna come out of my room the rest of the day. In fact, I couldn't even bring myself to get back up from my bed. My brain eventually became so overclocked with questions of "What, how, and *why* the fuck", that I ended up actually falling asleep simply form mental exhaustion. A "power reset", essentially.

At first, everything was fine (I guess); no vivid nightmares or any weird dreams. Actually, I didn't dream at all -- something that was typical for me. Suddenly, though, out of the fuckin' blue again, I saw a new one. This one was of my lab partner in Biology class, Francine Simmons. Already, despite being in what I thought -- no, what I *prayed* \-- was just some fucked to hell nightmare, I could feel my stomach start to turn over on itself. *"Dear God, no, please, not again, not another one!"*

This time, though, I faintly noticed two things to be different. The first was that the location was different. While I couldn't really tell with the other two, I still remember *their* killings taking place inn a dark room; like maybe a cellar or a basement or something. Not this one, though. Francine's was taking place *outside*. I still couldn't see *where* exactly because it was nighttime out, but I knew it was outside because of the trees that I saw surrounding the area of wherever this was apparently taking place; one of which Francine was tied to.

That brings me to the other thing that made this one different from the other two; the *way* in which it was being done. I'll say right now that this one sticks out to me a bit more than the other times, even now. She was nude, bruises and cuts covering just about every square inch of her body. She was also suspended in the air, similar to how Sarah was, only *she* was suspended off the ground by her wrists and neck and arranged in a crucifixion pose, her legs dangling freely down.

In the killer's hand was a wooden Louisville slugger. This made my heart stop. *"No... No, no, no, no, no..."*

Francine's eyes were glazed, yet still, I could see the cold panic in her eyes, flooding through them and filtering down the rest of her battered body as the killer approached with the bat. I could see tears flood her eyes, but she didn't move. She *couldn't* move, not even to struggle. About a foot and a half from her, I saw the bat swing swiftly, sending a crushing blow to Francine's stomach. Francine let out a strained, pitiful wheezing.

Through all of this, I was screaming at myself to make this end. To wake the fuck up and make this all be over. But I couldn't. I couldn't wake up. I couldn't make it stop. *I couldn't do ANYTHING except watch!*

***WHACK, WHACK, WHACK***

Francine's body began convulsing, writhing against her restraints. Her eyes went wide with each crash of the bat against her.

***WHACK, WHACK, WHACK***

She began heaving, struggling to gasp for air.

***WHACK, WHACK, WHACK***

This time, she was struck across her face, immediately dislocating her jaw. her lower jaw now hung limply to the right and I could hear her groan while still wheezing.

***WHACK, WHACK, WHACK, WHACK, WHACK, WHACK***

That was when I heard a sickening crack and her head dangled limp. Her body relaxed, hanging freely from the tree limb. She was gone.

That wasn't the end, though. Unlike with the other two, *this one* didn't just end with Francine passing. No, *this time*, it was taken a step further when the killer dropped the baseball bat and pulled out a bowie knife. I then watched as the knife was embedded to the hilt into the middle of Francine's chest and was dragged downward. At about the naval region, the knife was pulled out and reinserted, sliding across her stomach lengthways and intersecting with the first one to form a giant inverted cross in her body.

I saw the hands then dip one finger into the stream of blood that began running down from her naval and draw some sort of mark on her forehead. I didn’t get a chance to see what it was, though, before I was brought back to the real world. I was awakened to my mother shaking me awake. "SUSAN!" she cried. My eyes snapped open and I shot upright in my bed, hyperventilating again.

"Susan, Susan, calm down, breathe!" I couldn't. "Breathe," she repeated, "It's okay, honey. It's okay." I looked at her, gasping frantically. "I... I... But..." I stuttered. I didn't know what to say, what to do. I felt like my heart was less than two seconds from bursting. Every thought and emotion imaginable was sent zipping through my head, actually making me feel a bit dizzy. My eyes began burning with tears and soon, I was huddled in my mother's arms, crying like I was 5 years old again.

She just held me. "Shh... It's okay..." she said softly, "What happened?"

"I don't know..." I bawled. "Sh-she... She was *beaten to death*!" Her eyebrows raised in confusion.

"She?"

"Yeah, Francine Simmons. She was hanging from a tree and--" I was interrupted by a knock from the front door. Mom got up and went to answer the door, leaving me on my bed, quivering. I sat rigid, stiff; cycling through (or at least *ATTEMPTING* to cycle through) all of the questions worming in and out of my head simultaneously. The first, and I guess the biggest, being what the fuck was even going on?

Who *was* this person and why were they doing this? Why was *I* seeing it? *HOW* was I seeing it? Actually, I take back what I said about "What's going on?" being the biggest question. Thinking on it again, I think my *biggest* question at the time was if what I was seeing was even real, or if I really was just suffering from the worst, most vivid and fucked up nightmares I'd ever had in my entire life. I think, even then, a part of me was sitting there on my bed, praying to *GOD* that really was the case. That none of this was real, and that maybe I just needed a psychiatrist or something, *right?*

Well, of all my burning questions, this was the only one I got an answer for almost immediately. "Susan?" my mother called out from the living room. Slowly, I broke from my entropy and shambled from my bed out into the living room. In the living room, standing in the doorway, was Mom and two police officers. I froze at the threshold where the hallway meets the living room. My heart was immediately sent into a tailspin. *"What the... what's going on? Why are the cops here?"*

"Susan, honey," Mom asked, sounding pretty nervous, if not shaken, herself. "These two gentlemen say they need to speak to you." I didn't move. I just stood, my knees shaking violently.

“Miss, we just need to ask a few questions about where you were last night.” One of the officers stated.

“Wh-What do you mean? I was here at home.”

The other officer piped up, sounding like he was eager — a little *too* much so. “Anybody able to vouch for that?”

“N-no.” My teeth clenched. I looked to Mom, who looked more and more anxious herself by the second, and added, “But I promise, I was!”

The first officer nodded. His face remained concentrated. I wasn’t sure whether his silence meant he was *actually* believing me, or if he was just letting me *think* he did. At any rate, I couldn’t just sit there and continue being interrogated anymore and *NOT* at least know what the hell for.

“What’s going on?” I asked. “Did something happen?”

“When was the last time you saw Daniel Rudd?” He asked, his eyes narrowed. I could tell he was gauging me.

“Last night, at the Varsity football game.”

“Did you see him leave?” I shook my head in response. “Did you know of anybody else he may’ve been with at the game?”

“No. He was alone.” His eyebrow raised at me. I’d answered wrong — to him, anyways.

“Really? *No one else at all?*” he asked, now sounding very much accusatory.

“Yes!” I exclaimed, “He wasn’t with anyone else last night, at least not that *I* saw.”

“Okay, what’s this about?” Mom chimed in finally.

“An eyewitness said they saw your daughter with Daniel around the time of his disappearance.” He then looked at me. “And that little stunt of yours earlier at the schoolhouse makes me believe there’s more to the situation that you might not be tellin’ us here.”

“Like what?” I asked defensively. The hothead partner chimed in again.

“Like where you’ve got him.” He then narrowed his eyes at me, “Let me guess, you dumped his body in the cafeteria at the schoolhouse where we found him, and then, when you realized we’d be there, you decided to come in lookin’ all like a big shot so you could draw our eyes off ya, right?”

“What?!” my mother exclaimed, “What the fuck are you talking about?!”

“That’s enough.” Ordered the other officer. He tossed his keys to his partner and ordered him to go wait in the car before turning back to us. “I apologize for that, Ma’am. Kid’s just out of training; still hasn’t gotten out of the “shoot first, ask questions later” phase.”

“Apologies accepted, but I think it’s time you left.” Mom said, noticeably irritated. I could tell from her clenched teeth that it was everything she could do to not absolutely lose it with the officer.

He nodded his head respectfully at her. “I understand, Ma’am, but I would like to ask that you keep in touch.” He handed Mom a card before then turning to me. “And you, young lady, might wanna be careful. While my partner was out of line with the way he spoke to you, he *does* have one point. It doesn’t look good to go tryin’ to impede an investigation like that.”

“Ahem”, Mom said to him, gesturing toward the door. He nodded toward her again and was turning to leave when I stopped him.

“Wait!” He stopped and turned back to me.

“I-is it true? You actually... you actually found him?” My breathing became heavy again. *”If so, then that means...”*

His face stiffened and he nodded toward Mom and said “Keep in touch.” After that, he finally left. My mouth dropped.

Mom came over and wrapped her arms around me. “Are you okay?” She asked tenderly as she could, a hint of aggravation still not having dissipated. I just stared forward, unable to even make eye contact with her. “Susan?”

I snapped and looked to her. “Uh... Yeah... um... fuck, I don’t know...” My head was spinning far too quick for me to keep up.

“Honey, what were they talking about with you being at the schoolhouse today?” I sighed and told her the truth; that I was trying to look for him after I’d seen on the news that he was missing. Obviously, I didn’t mention the whole “I saw him get stabbed to death while in the bathtub” part. Not only did I know she wouldn’t believe that, but I still wasn’t sure I did, either; despite being all but directly told that it was true.

She just hugged me close, "I'm sorry, honey. It's gonna be okay." I just stood there, stiff in my mother's arms for what felt like hours. I don't really know whether it was because of the shock that I'd just been told that my crush was found murdered, the fact that I'd *seen* it happening (but didn't, or *couldn't* do anything about it), or the fact that, deep down, a part of me knew that it wasn't long before I'd hear the same thing happening with Sarah and Francine, but my head went completely blank.

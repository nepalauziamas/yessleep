Hello. Bless you!

&#x200B;

I am father George Baka, the exorcist. I am would not call myself famous, but many people in Romania know me in the ”underground”. I have tried to keep it low and just do my work, not to get public exposure, although I have had some small, rare, local media appearances in the past. One of them made me an acquaintance of Ruxandra, the lady who not just allowed me to publish some of my experience on her blog, but she also insisted that I do it. She became one of my spiritual daughters (meaning I am her confessor now).

&#x200B;

You see, I have a long experience dealing with the supernatural. Not just exorcisms. Even the story I want to share in here it is not about exorcisms, mostly, but about ghosts/the dead. I have exorcism stories to share, many of them. Not all of them are spectacular, some are just mystical, so to say, and they are about suffering that occurred on a long term, unspectacular, and in silence. Real life looks different like you see in movies like ”The Exorcist”, that are the work of Hollywood. But, indeed, there were certain situations where things go really massive and scary even in manifestation, and those could be a base for some movie, even if I am not sure if that would be such a good idea, to make movies upon those. Who knows what will happen and what the evil spirits would do if those movies would be made. But I would like to start with this story, then share some others, including of actual exorcisms.

&#x200B;

I first started sharing of these stories in the graveyard of the parish I held in a village in the Ialomița county, in south-east Romania, with one of two of my spiritual daughters, during a series of nights spend there. Ruxandra, who is an independent journalist, former news reporter, really wanted that those things should become known to the world. I admit, there is so much I know, so much I remember and I have few people I could actually say and, as old age is upon me, they shall get lost, if not published, one way or the other. I admit some readers may not enjoy the perspective of a priest on certain things, but this is who I am, so this is the way I can express myself.

&#x200B;

I shall start by sharing the context of how I started to become a story teller of my own recently, by explaining the context first. You can read the stories even if you did not know much of the background, if you want to get things shorter and go on reading, so I can tell you this is the story of the other spiritual daughter of mine, Helena, a special vampire lady who returned to faith after a long time and a lot of torment. But, if you would like to get to know the background of all this better, you can read the story of Helena shared by Ruxandra in here [https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/vzxear/helena\_of\_obor\_part\_1/](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/vzxear/helena_of_obor_part_1/) .

&#x200B;

I am a parish priest in a village in the plains of southern Romania, in the Ialomita county, not very far from the capital city of Romania, Bucharest, but not very close either. This village has, like most villages, one level buildings mostly, and the church is pretty small itself, and the graveyard is next to it.

&#x200B;

The idea of sharing the stories came on the first of a late summer night. You see, Helena, as an Orthodox Christian, needs to take part of the Holy Liturgy, the Mass, the Eucharist Sacrament. But, due to her nature, being a creature of the night, what some will call a monster, she would cause fear and who knows what else if she showed up in church, this is why I decided to perform the Holy Liturgy after midnight, outside Sunday, usually Wednesday night, for her. Another reason for this would be that Helena receives Holy Communion, to keep her predator needs in check. She can survive in sunlight, unlike Hollywood vampires, but she does not likes it too much. The week night allowed us to be as discrete as possible as well.

&#x200B;

Ruxandra drove Helena on the first night, as they both live in Bucharest. Things went well and, after the Mass ended, we went to the graveyard to enjoy the food cooked by Helena for the special night of her being reinstated as a full member of the Orthodox church. I have to admit that she cooked some interesting vegan food, as she wants to keep her nature controlled better, she has a good taste for spices, as I have not eaten anything like that lately. The most interesting was the round bread with dried linden leaves.  Ruxandra asked: ”Why linden? Is this an old recipe?” ”Oh no. I read online about an advice that was given by some  nun from Russia that, in the end days, to eat dried linden leafs, as end times famine will get us. So, if that is true, linden should be a very nourishing element, so I added it. Not just for nourishment, but to get use to it.”  She made me laugh: ” ”I do not know about that, but I can tell you it tastes funny. And interesting. Russian have their own spiritual attitude, sometimes they can get some ideas that are just... off. And sometimes, like anywhere in the Orthodox world, some fake things may be promoted out of piety without discerning. Linden can not harm you, indeed, but who knows what you can ”eat”, if you are not careful. Of course, I meant eating spiritually and mentally. So, at least take things with a grain of salt. You know what I mean?” Helena nodded her head.

&#x200B;

Ruxandra said: ”It is a bit like a herbal medicine, your bread. I assume you have experience with some form of traditional healing.” Helena answered: ”Healing, not too much. I lived around people who had little interest in healing, more into harming.” Ruxandra added: ”You said you were a powerful witch.” ”I was.” answered Helena, ”I knew and practiced things by the age of 30 that most witches would never dream off.” Ruxandra asked: ”While you slept in the ground, in the coffin, for 90 years, were you conscious?” ”I would say no.” replied Helena, it was like a long, long sleep, then you wake up and have only very small fragments of dreams. Very small.” Ruxandra added: ”Being born in 1912, you still look young, like you were in your early 30ties.” I added: ”She is in her early 30ties. She is immortal, she does not age beyond a certain point, as it seems. And those 90 years of sleep probably do not count much, psychologically and spiritually, so she is close in age to you, early 30ties. Both of you seem like daughters to me, you know, as I lived far more then any of you...” As I smiled at them, perhaps Helena would have blushed, if she were human and mortal.

&#x200B;

We kept eating in silence, as both of them looked at the graves around us. Ruxandra started, a bit cheeky: ”I am thinking: Who knows what is the state of the people buried around us. Who is truly dead from in here, I would not be surprised at all if a grave would open and somebody would come out. I would be scared, but not surprised.” She made me laugh again: ”You know, that might just happen, as I already witness not just one grave opening...” Ruxandra was a little startled. Even Helena looked surprised. I continued: ”I saw not just one grave opening. Probably what happened that night would have scared even Helena.” Now they really looked at me with a little wonder... ” Ruxandra almost whispered: ”It happened in this... graveyard”? ”Oh no, but it could have been.” A few seconds of silence, as the ladies looked at me with interest. So I decided to tell them the story:

&#x200B;

I was a young priest back then, in a village, in another region of the country. My mother, who lived with me, in our native village, died of cancer after a long struggle. As you can imagine, it was harsh on me, on my father etc.  I will not get into details. What I can tell you is that had a feeling, one afternoon, as I was out, to go her grave. I have not my epitrachelion on me, or any book, I entered and went to the grave. It was a late afternoon, the graveyard was deserted, so I sat on a bench near the grave, alone with my thoughts, just with some small prayers. I remember my mother, my life, all came to me, as I sat on the grass. You see, rural graveyards like this one are pretty picturesque, humbly, unlike those found in the city. They gave a feeling of peace that is not present in the city. This graveyard was also very clean, even if it was not very well kept. I listened to the birds, looked at the grass and weeds I fell asleep, probably nobody noticed I was there and night came. Oh! How I wished I would have been able to speak to my mother one last time... I started thinking what would I tell her, how would I tell her... A few hours have passed without realizing and I drifted into sleep.

&#x200B;

I woke up pretty late, I took me a few seconds, after waking up, to realize where I were and why I was there. There were no mobile phones back then, to be called or to call someone. Only a few candles illuminated the graveyard, as I managed to get up and look around. Something strange was in the air, in the ground. I tried to look around, to see the way out, but I could not find it. My mother„s grave was pretty deep inside the graveyard, closer to the edge opposite to the one that held the gate, and there was only one gate, I tried to brace myself and go towards the gate, on the shortest route possible. I felt a small fear in the back of my mind, but did my best to dismiss it. As I was walking, I started to hear a small rustle in the end of the alley, followed by a creek. Stone creek. Most people would think what I thought then, at a grave being opened. I dismissed the thought as silly, but I still needed to careful, it could have been a wild animal who managed to get into graveyard, or some criminal hiding. So, I decided to turn back and get into another alley. The creek was heard again, but louder, in the back. As I entered the other alley, I heard another creek, in my left. This was already getting weird and, semi-conscious, I peeked with my peripheral vision where the first creek was heard.

&#x200B;

I saw a figure, so to say, of an man dressed in an old, raggy suit, with a hat, like men use to wear up to the 1970ties. His eyes were pretty sunken, his face elongated, somehow, he looked off. Both like and unlike a person you would see with your own eyes. He looked consumed by something terrible from inside, something made me tremble just by looking at him. Those sunken eyes hung on to me like meat hooks on the meat, in an unnatural or unearthly way, I shall say. All about him seemed unearthly, not just in nature, but in intensity. He reached his hand in my direction and opened his mouth, starting to shout something incredibly desperate and piercing, something that I could not understand and that felt like it had the power to overwhelm me. I knew very well, in a second, that he was dead.

&#x200B;

As you can imagine, I started to run in a direction away from him. I looked in the back at him and towards the other creek, and soon I saw him and an old woman, dressed in old fashioned clothes who looked and felt similar to him coming from behind him towards me, shouting words that I could not comprehend. I started to hear one, two, three stone creeks from other sides, not very close, this time, but in different parts of the graveyard then the first two. I started to pray and breathe heavily, as I switched direction again. I thought came to my mind then: ”Do not panic! Do not lose it! If you do, you have no chance.”

&#x200B;

Now I know very clearly that a Christian or a person shall never panic. Why? Fear is put by God in our souls, in order to keep present in reality and react according to it. It is an instinct that is crucial not just for our physical survival, but also for our spiritual survival and well being. But, you see, our souls are not limited to emotions. Our souls are also rationality and will. Love, hate are part of will, not of emotions, of instincts, although most people nowadays tend to to consider them emotions, because both seem to be ”irrational”. Emotions are our temporary tool for facing reality, they do not have the profound and like changing role of love, that is a manifestation of the will, even if both are not „cold rationality”. Will is made not to repress, but to harness both rationality and emotion to its use, not just to surpass the false conflict between them, but to make them work together and use them to become stronger, one through the other. So fear, as an emotion, if it is not harnessed by the will, it can grow in quantity, not quality, and take over the soul, the mind, like a chaotic storm that destroys, instead of saving. This is why we should not, as much as possible, panic, preferable never. Panic destroys the capacity to react. Panic is not fear itself, it is a degenerate form of fear. Fear used by will, alongside reason, in a way, can actually became stronger, like other emotions, if kept in check, but be stronger for our own benefit.

&#x200B;

Indeed, when you do not see way any out and things seem to get desperate, it is easy to succumb to panic. Like it was starting for me. My actions became chaotic then, what I had in mind was to escape the contact with any of the dead.

&#x200B;

Suddenly, in front of me, another dead woman appeared, whose presence I could not associate with any creek. She looked like deep frozen, thin and like cracking, as she reached both her arms towards me and started to shout. This shout was even worse then the rest. This got harder and harder to bare, as the consumption I saw, heard and felt in the dead was growing, on many dimensions. I jumped from the alley and started running on top of graves. At some point, I stumbled upon a rock and felt over a grave.

&#x200B;

The grave was covered by soil and weeds, not by a stone plate, and that made my landing much easier. It did not hurt much, but my cassock was already pretty damaged by this point. I had a few seconds to asses my situation, as the thought of just hiding was pretty strong. Yet, I knew that, most likely, they shall find me and, besides that, at one point, one could came out from close to me or even from directly underneath me. I was praying in a desperate manner and I thought to myself that, perhaps, I need to accept whatever God wanted from me, if this was happening.

&#x200B;

You may wonder now: Why didn„t I perceived them as dead people and not demons or demonic manifestations? I am not sure how to tell you, I was feeling pretty strong and clear they were spirits of the dead. I know, those feelings can de deceitful, especially when fright takes over. I thought about it but, in a way, it mattered to me more, in those moments, to get away from them, instead of analyzing their nature. I looked at the fine grains of soil under my eyes and the dandelion that grew close to the base of and old, wooden cross, in the warm, clear, summer night. I took a deep breath and started to run again.

&#x200B;

I kept running, above graves, alleys, I started to recognize locations I have been before, and that was pretty bad news, of course. I knew I was loosing sense of direction, that my chances of escaping grew slimmer, as I was loosing control but, even so, a part of me remained conscious to end, unconquered by loose fear. Creeks were heard more and more, more and more dead people were shouting and coming towards me. It became clear that they were all around me and that I was running in circles by now. Actually, I was running in a spiral inward and, I ran into a smaller and smaller space, as they became more and more in number.

In a way, it felt like the end of Tetris game session, as you get closer and closer to the upper end, there little you can do, the capacity to harness fear and use rationality gets weaker and weaker. And you know it too well. I felt a little dizzy due to circle running, I fought to pray ceaselessly, not just to get help, but to keep my mind hanging on and not lose it. Where were they cornering me to? Soon, it became clear or most graves shall open, if not all. As I was running, there was less and less space between them, I ran even at two meters distance, between two of them. It was less then a minute they will get me where they wanted.

&#x200B;

The crowd of spirits got me close to a grave, eventually, as I was completely surrounded. I had only about two graves of space besides me. I stopped, it was the end. They stopped in their tracks as well and, as I was hyperventilating, I looked around. They kept shouting, like almost deafening me. On the grave, there was a spirit. She was my mother, standing on top of her grave. She appeared twisted of the same consumption I saw in others, like she was broken, distorted, a unbelievable burden was on her. She looked somewhat blackened, somewhat burned, in some unearthly way. As our eyes met, she started to shout. This time, I knew what she was shouting.

&#x200B;

”Help me, my son! You a priest, help me! Holy Liturgy, Sarindar, Parastas! Help me! Help us!” Then, the shouts and cries of the other spirits became intelligible. They said the same things: ”You are a priest! Help me! Help us! Holy Liturgy, Sarindar, Parastas.” A huge sadness and burden came over me, from them. I felt on my knees, then on my hands. I dropped my head towards the ground and I started to cry. You see, I am not a type of man to cry easily. Even when I was young I cried very rarely. I was not crying of my loss, of my pain, but of my mothers pain. Of the pain of all the people, of all the real people around me. I knew now for sure those were not demons or demonic manifestations, but real people. Dead people, but real people. Like a mountain was building up over me, on top of my back, overwhelming, yet not crushing me. They became quiet. I do not know how much I cried, there could have been seconds, minutes, perhaps an entire hour...

&#x200B;

A rustle, a wind came over the graveyard, engulfed it, strong, yet gentle as I looked to the ground. Soon, the rustle and the wind dissipated, I felt my burden becoming distant and all the graveyard became silent.

&#x200B;

When I, eventually, had the power to come up, all seemed normal. No spirit, no opened grave. Nothing. I might have considered a dream, if my cassock would not have been so severely damaged and if the pain of the struggle would not have been still felt in my muscles and bones. Bracing myself, I went fast towards the gate, fast, but not running. Fright was still on me, but not terror. I reached the gate pretty fast. I found it locked, being late at night. I took my cassock off, as it was pretty damaged as well, put it, more or less, around my neck, and went over the gate.

&#x200B;

My wife was worried, of course, when she saw me in the state I was. I did my best to calm her down, I told her I need to wash and rest, that everything is ok, that I shall tell in the morning. I slept a little, but it was enough to feel refreshed. She was scared, of course, of what I told her. After a few hours, I went back to the graveyard with a notebook and wrote down, from the crosses and tombstones as many names as I could. I started a Sarindar and did my best, for 40 days, to perform Holy Liturgy daily and call them on there as many of them as I could.

&#x200B;

You see, ladies, dead people can not work their salvation, like living people do. Including yourself, Helena, are alive, even if I considered yourself dead most of your life. When we are alive, we can fight our way to salvation and to sanctity. But, once we are dead, we can not. But, as Orthodox Christians, we know that the living can fight for the dead. God, in His infinite love for us granted this to us. For any Orthodox Christian we can call them on the Holy Liturgy, so that Christ sacrifices Himself for them and comes to the as the Holy Communion. And, with each Liturgy, if they are down, they come a little more up, until they can escape Hell completely. And the best for them is the Sarindar, the 40 Holy Liturgies, 40 days in a raw, to be called in. We also have the Parastas, that is not just a memorial service, we pray for them and give charity for them, and this helps them. Even the smallest prayer from the heart matters. Why should we let ourselves overwhelmed with grief, when we can fight for them. Bringing flowers on their graves does not help them, condolences does not help them, but the things I talked about does. Let us convert our grief into fuel for fight. If we truly love them, still, we shall fight for them.

&#x200B;

You might say now: ”Ok, but what about those who are already in Heaven?” Do not worry, if they are in Heaven, they you know what you do for them, they will be touched and pray for you. Usually, we have no certainty if someone is in Hell or in Heaven, precisely because we do not know what that was in their hearts and their life, to the smallest pieces. This is why we need to fight, regardless. Out of love.

&#x200B;

And so, I concluded the story.

&#x200B;

Helena was silent, looking at the ground, lost in her thoughts. Ruxandra was seemed thoughtful too, as she looked over my shoulder. Then, she looked at me and said: ”But isn„t it known that most hautings, most manifestation of spirits are demonic?” ”Indeed, they are.” I replied. ”You know why? Because the spirits of the dead in the hands of God. They can not go around and wonder wherever, whenever they like, on Earth. For them Heaven or Hell is the location. Yet, sometimes, like it was in my case, it may happen that they are allowed to get in touch with the living. But it needs to be a very strong reason for this. A sense in their presence. In their manifestation. Only when I had my ears open to understand what they wanted, I was sure this was not demonic. Would demons ask for help, like this? I think not. Yet, there are many situation when we are unsure. In that case, we need prayer, help from a priest or a spiritually advanced Christian and patience. Of course, sometimes, in desperate situations, like it was my own, you need to pray and trust The Lord, when you see nothing else you could do.”

&#x200B;

The ladies remained silent, as Ruxandra took Helena„ hand. Helena took Ruxandra„s hand in her both hands and caressed it. I smiled and went on: ”You know what I started to do after I finished the 40 Liturgies, the Sarindar?” They looked at me anxious. ”From time to time, I went to the graveyard and spend the night there. So I that I shall always remember that night and what I am suppose to do, as a priest of Christ. That behind the crosses, tombstones monuments, even behind those graves that have neither of those, are real people. Real people that need our help, that they shall ask it as much as they could. And they we can help them.”

&#x200B;

Ruxandra was about to cry, it seems. She did not but, instead, took a sip of water. She gave a sigh. After a few moments of silence, I smiled and continued: ”And, after a while, something else happened. Do you want to know?” ”Yes, father, we do” answered Helena, with her child curiosity. ”Ok then, I shall tell you that too.” And so I started the second story. I shall be back with it as well.

&#x200B;

My second story, in here [https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/xn5x5j/fragments\_from\_the\_diary\_of\_an\_exorcist\_episode\_2/](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/xn5x5j/fragments_from_the_diary_of_an_exorcist_episode_2/)

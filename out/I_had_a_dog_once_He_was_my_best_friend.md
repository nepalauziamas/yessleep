Mocha… 

He was my dog.  He was a lab mix, great friend, amazing to talk to, extremely responsive, and extremely smart. We got him when I was around 17, and I played with him so much, took him for walks, fed him nice food, gave him pieces of my steak at dinner time.

But then I met my girlfriend. My girlfriend was probably the hottest girl in the class, or at least, in my opinion. She was… Exquisite. She had long, brown hair, but she always tied it up in a pony tail. She loved flannel shirts, always unbuttoned two from the top so that a little cleavage would show, tight jeans, and boy, was she fiery. 

Ever since we got together, I hadn’t paid much attention to Mocha. I wouldn’t take him for walks a lot, so my parents or my brother would have to, and I started sharing my steaks with my girlfriend. I kind of forgot about him for a while. 

About a year later, I noticed that Mocha wasn’t feeling too great. He was vomiting, going potty inside the house which he never does, so we drove him to the vet and left him there.

A week later, we went to pick him up and he seemed like his puppy self again; bouncing off the walls, licking me, my parents, everyone. I guess the vets did their job. We brought him home, and I had begun to hang out with him more. I would take him out for walks, but my girlfriend would never join us. I would give him pieces of my steak, take him to the park and play with the frisbee, but again, my girlfriend would never join us. 

Then my dog went missing.

I ran in my room, and asked my girlfriend.

“Babe, have you seen Mocha?”

“No, sorry.”

“Well, can you help me look?”

“Yeah, just give me a second to finish this paper."

I ran down the stairs.

“Mom! Have you seen Mocha?”

“Mocha? What’s wrong with him, he was just in the back this morning!”

“Well he’s not there now. I think he must’ve gotten scared or something…”

“Alright. Grab my car keys.”

My mother, father and I got in the car and went looking for him. We searched, and searched for about three hours, but no sign of him. We asked neighbors, we contacted the police, but they weren’t much help either. 

“Mom, what are we going to do…”

I was sobbing. My best friend had run away from home, and there was no sign of finding him. I had no hope of finding him. There was no hope.

“It’s okay. Sooner or later, we’ll find him.”

We drove home, and I went back to my room. My girlfriend wasn’t there anymore, I guess she got tired of waiting. 

I laid down on my bed, and looked up at the ceiling.

Mocha’s collar was there, a note, and a napkin stained red, taped to the ceiling.

I stood up, and pulled everything down, and looked at the note.

*You should pay more attention to me, not the dog. Is the dog human? Can the dog hug you, or make out with you? Can you marry the dog? No. You know what you can do with them though...*

*He was delicious.*  

*I hope that you will pay more attention to me now.*

*I love you,*

*Chloe*

I'm going to go kill her now.

Wish me luck.

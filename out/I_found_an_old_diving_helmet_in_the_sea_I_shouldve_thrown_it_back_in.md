The hull of the boat made a rhythmic thudding sound as it bounced up and down over the choppy waves. This, paired with the noisy growl of the outboard motor, broke the tranquil silence that the ocean is supposed to provide. The gentle wind mixed with the spray of the salty water, creating a fine mist that showered my face. The blue surface that the boat floated atop spread out for much further than I was able to see. 

The dinghy was probably far too small to travel out as far as I had, but the further away from civilization, the more content I was. There is nothing better than being alone in the ocean, with nothing around you but the expansive blue water, and the occasional bird flying overhead. I find that the only things you need to enjoy life are a boat, a fishing rod, some sunscreen and enough supplies to survive the day. I had all of those, and so, life was good. 

I twisted the throttle and the engine gave one final burst of speed before I shut it off. The boat continued to float forwards for a moment before coming to a complete standstill. I had travelled out far enough that I was away from any other living person, but hoped that I was just above plenty of living fish. I grasped my fishing rod and plucked a small worm out of my cooler filled with bait. I attached the wriggling invertebrate onto the glistening hook and cast the line out into the wobbling sea.

The line hit the ocean and ripples shot outwards from the impact. The hook then sunk down, travelling closer to the ocean floor. I then had no choice but to wait for some aquatic creature to be fooled into thinking the worm was its next meal. Time seems to slow down when waiting for a fish to attach itself to the line, which provided me with a moment to truly relax. The usual fast paced nature of life is forgotten, and my mind can reside in a place of peace and beauty. 

The calm thoughts within my head are suddenly dispelled when I feel something tug at the end of my line. I sprung into action and began to wind the rod, bringing whatever was attached closer towards the surface. The metal rod was bending, creating an arched shape, and the fishing line was taut, so I was certain that a very large fish was hooked on the end of it. I was determined to reel this fish in, and hoped that it would be good eating that would provide me with food for the following few days.

I kept winding the reel handle, which was starting a tense battle between fishermen and fish. The more I wound the line in, the more the rod would curve. The skirmish continued for a while, but I fought hard to gain the upper hand. I could feel that the line was almost completely reeled in and, with a final burst of strength, I pulled the hook up to the surface of the ocean. I expected to see a flailing fish emerge from the water, but what came up out of the sea was a dull gold colour, and looked metallic.

Confused, I continued to pull this object closer towards me to get a better view of it. As it drew closer, I made out what it was. It was an old diving helmet. The kind that early ocean explorers used to wear whilst on their nautical adventures. I pulled the helmet up over the side of the dinghy, and the first thing I noticed was the weight of it. It looked to be made of solid copper, and it now made sense as to why I struggled for as long as I did to bring it in. 

As I inspected the outer surface of the helmet, I instantly noticed a rather large dent along the right hand side of its curved top. It looked as if it had been bashed in with an immense amount of force. The rest of the diving helmet appeared to still be intact, despite sitting on the ocean floor for probably over a hundred years. 

I stared into the round glass that was situated at the front of the helmet. I could see through into its interior, which looked completely black and empty. I then saw myself reflecting off of the glass and, just for a second, I caught a glimpse of something sitting behind me. I turned around sharply to see what it was, but I quickly came to realise that I was still alone on the boat. Relief washed over me, and I turned back around to look at the helmet once more. 

As I looked back at the gold headpiece, I started to feel an urge overtake my body. I felt the overwhelming desire to place the helmet onto my own head. I slowly lifted it upwards, struggling with the weight of it, and slid it over the top of my head. Once It was balanced on my shoulders, I peered through the pane of glass that separated me and the outside world. The glass gave my vision a greenish tinge that made me feel like I was looking underwater. I swiveled my head around, looking towards the back of the boat. That's when I saw it again.

It was clear this time. Sitting at the stern was a man. He was equipped with a full, old fashioned deep sea diving suit, but he was missing his helmet. He was soaking wet, with droplets falling from his shaved head and long moustache. On the right side of the man's head, streaks of blood were pouring from a nasty gash. The diver was shivering and water was leaking from his canvas suit. He was mumbling to himself but it was hard to decipher what he was saying. 

When I saw him, I jumped backwards in the boat, frightened by what I saw. It was impossible for someone to now be sitting inside of my boat that was floating in the middle of the ocean. I stared at him, shocked to see another living soul sitting within the dinghy. I noticed his bluish hue, which I would've attributed to the glass on the helmet, but it looked more as if it was the colour of his skin. 

I quickly ripped the helmet off of my head, to get a better look at the man that was now accompanying me. As I pulled the watertight head covering off my shoulders and over my head, the man disappeared. Where he was sitting was now empty. I was now even more confused. I slid the helmet back over my head, and the man was across from me once again. This time that he appeared, I also noticed that he was crying and sobbing, all the while still mumbling. 

I didn't know what was causing me to see the man. I knew that it wasn't some sort of electronic screen inside the helmet because it had been submerged in water. I didn't think that he was an illusion that my mind was fooling me with. No logical explanation could explain why I was seeing him. My mind then wandered into the possibility that this was a supernatural occurrence. Maybe he was a ghostly apparition of a poor soul lost at sea.

I looked at the soaking and whimpering diver, both afraid and curious as to why he was manifesting in front of me. Possibly a warning, or even a lost spirit trying to catch a ride back to the shore and away from their watery grave. 

I continued to stare, and noticed that he never once looked up at me. He might've not even known I was present. The longer I watched on, the more my attention turned to the strange words he was muttering to himself. Due to the helmet that encased my head, it was hard to make out exactly what he was saying, but he was repeating the same few sentences over and over again. After listening for a while, I managed to decode what he was mumbling.

"Black ink…..a thousand fish…..I can't…..I can't swim away….black ink…a thousand fish…I can't… I can't swim away….".

He repeated the same phrases continuously, not speaking to anyone in particular, just talking to himself. I was listening though, and I wasn't entirely sure as to what he meant, I had a strong feeling that it was important.

I was just about to call out to the diver, in the hopes that he would actually respond to me, when I saw a dark shadow surrounding the dinghy. The blackness loomed underneath the boat and it stretched out for many metres in every direction. It looked like the shadow of a creature much bigger than anything that had been discovered in the ocean before. I let out a small screech of horror, as whatever this was, would easily be able to devour the boat, and take me along with it. 

The diver appeared to not have noticed the dark shadow, and continued to mutter and cry. I called out to him, trying to gain his attention. He just sat still, unmoving apart from his body shaking from the sobbing. I didn't know what else to do, and went to reach out for the pull cord to start the small outboard motor attached to the boat. As I outstretched my arm to reach the engine, I saw something float to the surface. When I looked at what it was, I saw that a single dead fish now floated atop the water. 

Before I had time to react, another lifeless fish emerged from beneath the surface. Then another three popped up from underneath the waves. I then watched in horror as countless more dead fish arose to the surface and floated on the water, like pieces of cereal floating in a bowl of milk. It appeared as if thousands of the dead aquatic animals were now rising to the surface, and then it all made sense. The black ink. A thousand dead fishes. It was exactly what the diver had been mumbling about. 

This was all some vision that was being caused by me putting on the helmet. I believed that it was this man's way of showing me how he died. He was killed by some unknown beast from the deep. The thought that there was actually some undiscovered creature lurking below the surface was frightening enough, but to see it through the vision was even more terrifying. I had seen enough, and so took the helmet off once again. 

I expected the inky water to dissipate and for the deceased fish to disappear, but they were still visible, even outside of the helmet. I felt a scream get caught in my throat and I slightly choked on it. The diver was an apparition that appeared because of the helmet, but everything else was not. The black ink. The thousand dead fishes. Everything he said was true. 

I didn't know what to do, but something was coming for me. Something that lived within the deep water of the ocean. I had no option but to start the engine and attempt to drive the dinghy away from the spot and out of the black water. I reached for the pull cord and yanked it as hard as I could. The engine made a rumbling sound but it didn't start. I pulled the cord again, the engine rumbled and then ticked over. It had started, and so I twisted the throttle and the boat began to move, shooting ink black water out the back of the motor. 

I pushed the engine as fast as I could, which still might've not been fast enough. The black sea seemed to stretch out further than I had first anticipated. I was fearful for my life, fearful that a large underwater beast would emerge and attack me at any moment. I kept the boat moving forward, racing back to the safety of dry land. The dead fish lay in my path, bouncing off the hull of the boat and I streaked through the water. 

I kept my head facing forward, not wanting to look behind me, and definitely not below me. The engine whirred as I pushed it to its limits. I could now see the edge of the dark, murky water and the sweet relief of blue, clean water was ahead of me. I kept travelling and made it past the blackness. I was out of the dark water, but I still hadn't escaped danger yet. 

I kept waiting to see the wondrous sight of land, and soon enough, it appeared before me. I could see other, small fishing boats that were smart and stayed close to the shoreline. I kept moving towards them, wanting to rejoin them and actually find relief in being around other people. The boat pushed onwards, and soon enough I was back among the other amateur fishermen. I was out of the ocean depths, and I hoped, away from danger. 

I summoned enough courage to peer back out towards the deep sea, and as I did, I could've sworn I saw something emerge from the water and then slip back into its depths. I saw a long, slithery tentacle like up out of the water for just a second before disappearing once more. It was bigger than any octopus or squid that has been discovered before.

I don't know exactly what it was that hunted me, but I don't think it was something that is known to the human race. Another mysterious creature that lurks within the world's oceans. 

I also am unsure as to why the helmet showed me the vision of the old deep sea diver. Maybe it was a warning, or possibly, the helmet called out and summoned the creature of the deep.

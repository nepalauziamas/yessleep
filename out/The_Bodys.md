It had started as a normal day, I was a freshman at new Hemsworth highschool which was one of the biggest highschools in the area. Growing up I was a very smart child having skipped two grades during middle school. In grade seven i was diagnosed with severe depression and was taken out of school for the year, and while I was away the criculum had changed which ment I had to reapet grade seven again. Because I was still a year younger than everyone I got picked on quite alot which caused me to be extremely happy when going on to highschool. I had a plan to tell everyone I was older than I actually was which wouldn't be hard to get away with since I'm quite tall for my age. 

The teachers had seen my success in elementary school so they put me in the gifted class for student who had the highest grades out of everyone. The gifted class was located in a small building about a minute walk from the main building, and right dead smack in the middle of the path there was a huge oak tree that was easily taller then the three story highschool. 

The little building had 2 classrooms and a bathroom with the classrooms being the one upstairs for kids with disabilities and the one in the basement for my class, the bathroom was located up stairs with the disability classroom to make it easier for kids in wheelchairs to access.Â  I had been in this classroom doing acceptably well while being a year younger than everyone, the teachers often praised me for my well doing and that made me really happy. 

I had woken up in a tired and depressed mood not wanting to go to for the first time in forever, though my parents being nieve wanted me to go to school thinking that it would be all good once I came home. I went to school that day and I obviously wasn't in the right mindset so I had fallen asleep in class and the teacher just let me. I woke up around lunch time and everyone had already eaten since our lunch was at 11:00 not 12:00, being upset that I had missed eating I had asked to go to the bathroom to wash my face and try and calm down. 

I was walking to the bathroom when I had a weird gut feeling, my stomach churned and something felt off. Like I had said I wasn't in the right mindset so I thought that it was just my body playing tricks on my, I walked into the bathroom but stopped dead in my tracks in the doorway. I dropped my bag. 

There in one of the stalls, was a pair of feet levitating above the ground. Weary I instinctively raised my head though I wish I hadn't. A girl around my age was hanging by her neck, her mouth and eyes wide open and blacked out with black ooze dripping from them. 

I screamed out of pure fear and terror but my screams were cut short and everytime I screamed they could not be heard. I ran trying to escape the building and go outside, but I spotted one of my classmates, Lucas, and ran up to him while he was filling his water bottle to tell him about what i saw. Still he didn't believe me, I collapsed trying to stop him from walking to the bathroom nevertheless, it was too late. He had seen for himself what was hanging there. 

Just then my teacher had run out of the classroom all of my classmates walking just behind her confused on what was going on. At this point I was in tears as I watched my teacher run to the other classroom with the disabled kids which was just beside the bathroom, on her way to the other classroom she pulled Lucas out of the way and shut the bathroom door and then proceeded to tell the other teacher what was going on. 

One of my classmates noticed my state and helped me up and told me that my teacher had gotten a call from the principal and told us to evacuate the building. And I realized that my teacher had gone to the other classroom to tell them since there is not phone in there. My classmates helped me and Lucas out of the building since we were so traumatized at what we had witnessed. 

as we left we saw that there was about 2000 kids outside, I was confused since our school had around 3000 kids but I was to panicked to think straight, I saw my friends huddled up and I managed to walk over to them asking what happend. They had told me that a girl went to the bathroom and had gone missing, the teacher made an announcement for all the staff to come to the gymnasium where then the teacher had found out that the other staff members were also missing a couple students. They then decided to form a search party to find the missing students, and search all the bathrooms at the same time. Though my friends said they didn't know what happend after that since the teachers wouldn't tell them anymore, I already knew that what they had found is what me and Lucas had also seen. 

I was thinking to myself about if all these kids had planned to commit suicide at the same time but i remebered an important detail that made me sure that this wasnt suicide, the rope that the girl was hanging from wasnt attached to anything almost as if it was going straight through the roof, almost as if soemone had done this to them. 

I realized that my backpack had been left in front of the bathroom, and for some odd reason I wanted to retrieve it. I asked my friends If they would come with me becuase I was scared to go alone incase something would jump out at me, and understandably my friends didn't wish to join me becuase they didn't want to know what was going on. I had a strange feeling that made me really want my backpack so I asked another girl, Lucy if she would come with me. Lucy said she was curious to find out what was going on so she agreed to come join me on this adventure. We made it about halfway to the school till I had saw something drip onto the pavement infront of me, it was thick, thicker than blood. I ntoiced the color, black. I looked up and saw something that would traumatize me for the rest of my life. Up in the tree were around 700 kids hanging by there necks, all with the same look on there faces as the girl in the bathroom.

The trip to my new home--well, “old”, technically--was uneventful, thankfully. I arrived at the old home of my grandfather for the first time since before his coma. Before I drove there, his lawyer, a man by the name of Carlos Ramirez, gave me two envelopes left by my grandfather, not to be opened until I came of age. He said that one held a set of keys to the estate, the other contained information on my inheritance. Something was a bit strange about Mr. Ramirez, though. I didn't “hear” any thoughts escaping his mind, not even when I broke my rule and tried to subtly reach him. In fact, it felt like I was being barred from his mind. He didn’t make any outward reaction, but on the way out, I did hear a voice in my mind say, *Read the letter before you open the chest in the attic.*

I didn't reply, mostly because I was surprised by hearing someone talk directly into my mind since the attack by the lady in the green dress (my grandmother). It wasn’t nearly as invasive, though; as cryptic as his instructions were, it just felt like the words had entered my mind as easily as mail through a door’s mail slot. 

It looked just as I remembered: a little farmhouse, rustic yet comfortable in design. After unlocking the door, I took a step inside, and immediately, my senses were hit with an overwhelming, bittersweet wave of nostalgia. I used to play here during summers. I used to walk in the nearby woods, my grandfather telling me all sorts of things about the fauna and flora. I used to laugh at my Grandad swearing openly in front of me, much to my parents’ chagrin. It was like I stepped back in time, but something was missing.

Or rather, some*one.*

I didn't realize that I was crying until I felt a few tears run down my cheeks. I wiped them away quickly. There wasn't time for that right now; I needed to learn about what exactly my grandfather had hidden. 

I sat down at the old kitchen table and opened the first envelope, which contained a few sheets of paper with an all-too-familiar messy handwriting on them. I’ll go ahead and transcribe my Grandad’s words here.

*Hey, Little Cub,*

*I know that by now, you're too old for me to call you that. If you're reading this, I’ve kicked it, and you’ve probably started to hear weird shit in your mind. To cut to the chase, kiddo, you’ve got a gift, or a curse, depending on how you look at it. You’re what’s known as an “Indigo Child”, or just “Indigo.” We can read people’s minds, move things, and even send our minds outside our bodies, and that's just scratching the surface. You’ll probably notice I said “we”, and that's because there are others like us. Some have powers that they aren't aware of, others use their powers more subtly. There are even some damn famous people who are Indigos. That's not the important part, though. That isn't why Carlos gave this letter to you. He gave this letter to you because your grandmother has woken up, and is looking for you, or she’s already found you. Now you need to go up to the attic, look for the trunk in the corner, and use the key to unlock it. I know you're confused, kid. I know all of this is crazy for you, but you’ll have better answers than I can give when you see what’s in the trunk. I’m sorry I can’t give a better explanation than that, but hopefully, it’ll make more sense when you’ve read it. Love you, Little Cub.*

*-Grandad Jeremy*

Again, tears threatened to spill out at the use of the childhood nickname, but I blinked them back and looked at the keys, then at the attic. Inhaling the musty air in determination, I went up to the door, opened it, then searched the surprisingly clean attic for the trunk. I felt it before I saw it. Much like how I could hear people’s thoughts, I felt the contents of the trunk call to me. Going over to it on autopilot, I knelt to examine it. There was nothing special about it: just a normal, brown trunk covered in dust. Unlocking it, I saw it: the book I had never seen but remembered from my grandmother's memories. 

It was a leather-bound book with the two words: “Indigo Blood.” 

I reached in to pick it up. All of a sudden, I felt all sorts of things flowing into me. Words, images, memories, entire lives, including their deaths--it was as though many different people’s minds had all been “stitched” together as one enormous consciousness, and I was being assimilated as well. It felt like an eternity, though it was really only a moment, but eventually, I was able to pull myself back into the real world, panting heavily from the experience. Without opening it, I understood the book’s purpose. This contained all of the information about Indigos one would ever need, including names and entire histories. What's more, it somehow “updated” itself; when an Indigo was born, they were added to it, along with their deeds. This wasn’t what prompted me to take the book and immediately flee, however.

During the “assimilation”, I happened to see an image of the house from the outside, at that very moment. 

I didn't see anyone or anything as I peeled out of the driveway and back to my apartment, but I felt them. It wasn’t my grandmother, but it was definitely someone who wished me harm. I’m in my apartment now, hoping to be able to read the book’s contents more coherently. I can’t help but continue looking out the window, however. Whoever the Indigo was that was watching me, it makes me certain that I now have more to worry about than my grandmother.

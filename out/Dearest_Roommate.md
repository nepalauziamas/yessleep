It was Wednesday.  I had worked a full nine hours, taken a thirty minute bus ride, and finally arrived home.

“Hey Penelope,” I called out, taking off my shoes.  The sun was setting.

When she didn’t run up to me I took a look around and noticed something odd.  It was a bright blue piece of paper on my kitchen table.  It was folded in thirds.  I picked it up and realized it was a note.

The note read:

“Dearest Roommate, it was a pleasure spending time in your residence.  I took a lovely nap in your bed and a luxurious bubble bath in your tub.  Your robe is very soft.  I was also able to feed your kitty, but I don’t know her name.  Would you be so kind as to share her name with me for next time?  Overall, I found this visit to be very enjoyable and I am looking forward to staying with you again.”

My hand went to my pocket immediately, feeling for my pocket knife.  “Hello?”  I tried to sound confident and unafraid.  “Is someone here?”

My call was greeted by a happy chirping.  My cat, Penelope, sauntered out of the bedroom.  The little bell on her collar jingled happily.  I rescued Penelope four years ago when she was three.  She was an overweight, black fuzzball with little sprinklings of white around her face.  Now she was exactly the same, except with the addition of a collar and a forever home.  It was so nice to have her with me.  Living alone was hard.

And now I found this note.

I scooped up Penelope and called the police.  I wasn’t going to mess around with someone coming into my house.

I lived in a small townhouse with a shared entrance with the neighbors.  An officer took about twenty minutes to look around the place, examining the windows and doors.  The other officer looked at the note.

“Do you know of anyone who would want to enter your residence?”

“No.”  Penelope pressed her head against my leg.

The officer held the note like it was garbage.  “Do you think…you could have written the note?”

“Excuse me?”  I felt my cheeks start to burn.

“Sometimes, people, when they feel lonely-”

“I don’t feel lonely.”  My fists closed.  “Someone broke into my place.”

She smiled a sharp, pitying smile.  “Ma’am, there are no signs of forced entry.  The neighbors did not see anything out of the ordinary.  You yourself told us that nothing is missing.  Why would someone come into your home to sleep in your bed?”

“I don’t know!  But someone did!”

The other officer came out of the bedroom with my journal.  He opened it to reveal the bright blue pages.  “Ma’am, is this yours?”

I walked over and snatched it out of his hand.  “Yes.  It’s my journal.  They obviously tore a page out of it.  That doesn’t mean I-”

“Ma’am, please calm down.”  The female officer looked like she was holding back from laughing.  “We will make a report.  If you notice anything missing, or see anyone, please feel free to call us again.”  She dropped the note and let it fall unceremoniously onto the table.

Tears pulled at my eyes, but I blinked them away.  “That’s it?”

“What else do you want us to do?”  She turned her back to me and walked out.

The other officer lowered his head.  “I’m sorry.  We really can’t do anything else.”

“It’s okay,” I whispered, probably more for myself than for him.

“Do you want me to keep the note, for evidence?”

“No.  I’ll keep it.  Thanks.”

He left with a little nod, closing the door behind him.  I locked it, pressing against the wood.

I know what happened.  It’s the same thing that keeps happening.  No one ever believes me.  Something happens and it never leaves you.  It follows you closer than a shadow.  But darker, more insidious.  You lose your friends.  Your family.  You are more alone than you have ever been.

I didn’t sleep.  I couldn’t.  I could barely even sit on the bed.  Everything looked normal, but I could feel the presence of whoever entered my home.  Everything was tainted.  Penelope did not have this problem.  She slept soundly, purring in her sleep.

When the sun rose, I got ready for work.  I slipped on my shoes and bid Penelope goodbye.  I triple checked that I locked my door.

The day passed thickly.  I felt like I was just sitting, staring out the window.  I watched people go about their business.  I heard small conversations.  But I was in my own little world.  Was Penelope okay?  Was the intruder there with her?  Were they touching my things?

Time went by both sickenly slow and ridiculously fast.  Before I knew it I was back on the bus, almost home.  I debated getting a hotel room, but I didn’t have the money for that.  Reluctantly, I unlocked the door.

“Penelope?”  I cringed at how weak my voice sounded.  I had barely closed the door behind me when I spotted a new note, this time on the couch.  Same blue paper.  Same chill in my stomach.  Penelope was lying on the couch next to it, almost as if she were protecting it.  She raised her head and yawned.

The note read:

“Dearest Roommate, are you angry with me?  You did not have to call the police.  I would never hurt you or the kitty.  I still don’t know her name.  I am going to call her Vargin, as she reminds me of a friend I used to know back in Belarus.  I did not sleep this time around.  I am a little upset with you.  I just sat on the couch and watched some television.  I fed Vargin as well.  I hope you will refrain from calling the police this time.  I am not a thief.  I would like to keep enjoying our home.  See you tomorrow.”

I crumpled the note, tears burning my eyes.  Penelope stretched, letting out some concerned chirps.  I threw the paper on the ground.  What was I supposed to do?

My phone started to ring and I nearly fell over.  “Hello?”

“Hi honey.  How are you doing?”

“Hi mom.”  I tried to control my voice.  “I’m fine.”

“How is the job hunt going?”

I took a breath.  “It’s okay.”

She sighed.  It was a sigh I knew well.  A disappointed sigh.  My theme song.  “Have you been applying?  Laurel said she saw you at a cafe staring at the window the other day.  She said you didn’t even have your computer.”

“Laurel should mind her fucking business.”

“Language!”

I slumped onto the couch.  “Mom, I’m tired.  Can I talk to you later?”

She paused.  “Did you call the cops yesterday?”

I groaned.  “Did they call you?  How the hell is that legal?”

“Because we are all worried about you!  Are you feeling bad again?  Maybe you should come back home.”

“I am only feeling bad because a fucking stranger broke into my house.  They are leaving me notes and feeding my cat.  What the hell am I supposed to do?”

“I am driving over there.”

“Mom, no.  I don’t need you.”

“Yes you do.  It’s happening again.”

“I’m hanging up.  Don’t come here.”  I hung up.  My heart was pounding.  She would never let me move on.  She would never let me forget.

Penelope crawled onto my lap.  Her steady breathing and soft purrs helped me to breathe normally again.  I stroked her back.  At least I had one person who was there for me.  I was glad my mom lived a few states away.  She tried calling back but I turned my phone off.  I closed my eyes and took a deep breath.

No one understood me.  No one believed me.  I was alone.

Penelope licked my hand as if she could read my thoughts.  “Not alone,” I whispered, enjoying the rough texture of her tongue.

I tried to stay awake again, walking to the door and checking that I locked it.  But sometime after midnight I passed out from exhaustion.  I must have also forgotten to turn my phone on for my alarm because I woke up after ten.

“Fuck!”  I threw on some clothes.  I was so late.  I didn’t even remember to check the house before I left.  I don’t know if I fed Penelope, I’m ashamed to say.  I just ran out the door to the bus stop.

I got to the cafe around eleven.  The barista smiled at me.  “The usual?”

“Yes, please.”  I took out a ten and handed it over.  He gave me my change and my coffee.

I went to my usual table but found someone else sitting there.  I stood awkwardly.  There were plenty of other tables, but this one was mine.  I stood for a few minutes before I was noticed.  The person took out their headphones and looked at me.  “Do you need something?”

“That’s my table,” I said quietly.

They squinted.  “Your table?”

“Yes.  This is where I sit and do my work.”

“There are literally like ten tables right there-”

“This one is mine,” I insisted.

They looked around confused.  The barista appeared behind me.  He said, “Hey, sorry about that.  If you are able to move to another table I can give you another latte on the house.”

The person shrugged and gathered their things.  They picked the table furthest away from me.  The barista narrowed his eyes.  “You can’t keep doing this.  This table isn’t just yours.”

“Thanks,” I said dismissively, sitting down.  He sighed and walked away.  My theme song.

I stared out the window.  This was my place.  This was my work.  I studied the parking lot, businesses across the street, cars, and people walking by.  My coffee went cold, like it always did.  I barely touched it.  

The hours languished on.  People whispered behind me, talked about their lives, ordered drinks…it was like I didn’t exist.  I both loved and hated that feeling.  I left a little later than usual, to make up for my lateness that morning.  There was a new barista working when I left.  She didn’t meet my eye-line as I walked out the door.

The bus ride was long and loud.  An older man sat next to me.  He stared at me for a while before saying, “Bad day?”

I didn’t respond.

He leaned back.  “You should smile.”

“You should mind your fucking business.”

His eyes got wide and he mumbled an apology before switching seats.  I pulled the cord and got off a few stops early.  I would walk.

I got home before it was dark.  I unlocked the door and let it swing open.  I expected a note, so it wasn’t a surprise.  The surprise was that it was hanging from the ceiling.  Hanging by some thin rope, from a large nail I had ever seen before, was the blue paper.  It was still folded in thirds.

The note read:

“Dearest Roommate, I am very disappointed in you.  Not only did you forget to feed Vargin this morning, but you also lied to your mother.  We don’t like liars in this house.  I had to take drastic action.  I am sure you will understand.  See you soon.”

I started to sweat.  My hand went to my phone to call the police but I realized they wouldn’t do anything.  No one would believe me.  I had to get out of this house.

“Penelope?”

No response.

“Penelope, come here.”

Nothing.

My stomach sank.  Penelope always came when I called her.  I could feel something was wrong.  I heard my mom’s voice in my head, “It’s your fault.  It’s always your fault.  You lie, you trick yourself, and then bad things happen.”  I looked in the bedroom, even under the bed.  She wasn’t there.

I kept saying her name over and over.  Tears flooded my face.  I was frantic.  My heart pounded in my ears.  And then I realized there was a knocking on my door.

I didn’t move.  The knocking stopped for a moment.  I was about to relax when it started again, louder this time.  I sprang into action.  I grabbed the largest knife I could find and ran into the bathroom, hiding behind the door.  The stranger took my cat.  Who knows what they did to her.  And now they were back to finish the job.

I held my breath as I heard the lock turn.  That’s how they got into my house!  The door opened.  I could hear their footsteps getting closer.

This was the moment that I was done.  Done being the one at fault.  Done being the odd one, the troublemaker.  Done being told I made it all up.  I was taking things into my own hands.  I screamed the loudest I ever have, raising the knife, and bolted out of the bathroom.

My mom screamed when she saw me.  I was so surprised I almost fell backward.  The knife tumbled out of my hand.

“What are you doing?” she demanded.

“I thought you were the intruder!”

“There is no intruder!”  It felt like she was towering over me.  “You have always thought that someone was in the house and there never was.  You deluded yourself into this fantasy where everyone is out to get you.  No one is out to get you!  No one is-”

A loud crack echoed in the living room.

My mom’s head turned sideways, impossibly so.  Her mouth hung open, eyes white.  She toppled over onto the carpet into a pile of arms and legs.  My lungs felt like they weren’t working.  This couldn’t be real.

Behind her stood Penelope, who chirped happily.

I fell to my knees and looked at my mom.  Her neck was snapped.  There was no blood, no wound.  Just a face turned too far back.

“This is her fault, you know.”

I looked behind me and saw a figure.  It was barely a person, blinking in and out of view.  But every so often I could see a woman.  She was old and naked, breasts sagging.  Her hair was white and straw-like.  She smiled a toothy grin.

“She should have believed you,” she said in a thick accent.  “We could have avoided all of this niepryjemnasc.”  She floated through me towards Penelope, who began to purr.  She reached down her non-existent hand and patted her gently.  “Vargin and I are quite fond of each other.  I am thinking of making this my forever home.”

I backed up, knocking my head into the wall.  I had no voice to scream with.

“Don’t worry about the body,” she cooed, still petting Penelope.  “Vargin will make quick work of it.”

As if understanding what was said, Penelope began devouring the body.  It was not the motions of a normal cat.  Her mouth opened unnaturally wide, digging her teeth into my mom’s flesh and ripping.  She seemed to enjoy it.  As if she’s had it before.  I wondered what this intruder had been feeding her.

“Dearest Roommate,” the woman said softly, hovering just above the ground.  “Don’t cry.”

The tears were falling without consent.  She touched my cheek and I smelled a deep, old scent.  “But she…was my mom.”

“I am your mom now,” she whispered, and kissed my forehead with her cracked lips.

And with her kiss I slept soundly, free of dreams.

What happened next: (Coming soon)

**I think I have anatidaephobia.**

I remember the laughs I had when I learned there was a fear of a duck always watching you.  I practically laughed *so hard* that my face became red. My friend, Emily, made a remark about how it's not funny, because people actually suffer from that fear. I just laughed harder and started making duck noises, which prompted her to double down laughing also.

It was all fun and games. Key word: WAS.

I used to love ducks. I had stuffed ducks in my room for decoration, I used to draw ducks all the time. They weren't my *favorite* animal, but I at least *liked* them.

Not anymore.

I think it was in July when I first started noticing it. I didn't pay much attention at first.

If I remember correctly, I was eating ice cream with some friends. It was Emily, her boyfriend James, and my boyfriend, Jackson. Jackson was *amazing*. He was polite, funny, sweet, and he was such a nerd. Exactly my type. He was easy on the eyes, too.

He was amazing. Key word: WAS.

Anyways, ice cream. I got strawberry in a cone, paid for by Jackson, of course. It was great.

Then, I saw something in the corner of my eye. A white blob behind the trashcan. I pointed it out to Jackson, and we investigated.

It was a duck.

I thought it was cute when I saw it. Jackson tried to coax it over, even throwing a piece of his ice cream cone at it. The duck didn't flinch at the action. It just stood there. I don't think it registered at the time, but now that I recall it, I think it was looking at me. The way I remember it, its eyes were unnatural. They were gray. I remarked to Jackson about it, but he didn't seem to hear me.

That day went on as normal, and I didn't think about the duck for a while. I think it was a week before it was brought to my memory.

This time, it was just me and Emily. We were out shopping, and I saw it.

The duck.

It was just... *standing* there, in a dark corner. Gray eyes, white feathers.

Watching me.

I pointed to it, and prodded Emily to look.

"Emily, do you see that? Its that duck from last week!" She turned her head, and so did I. But the duck was gone. May finger dropped, and I shook my head. "It was there!" I ran to the corner, peeking around it, but no duck was present. It had just *disappeared.*

I tried to shake the thought off for the rest of the day. For a little while, it worked. But not for long.

The next time I saw it, I was alone.

I was walking home from a late dinner at a fast food place. It was rainy, and the sky was gray, but something *white* stood out from all the grayness. It was standing there, watching me, with its haunting, gray eyes. This was when it started to get to me.

So I tried to chase the duck off. I ran towards it at full speed,

*but it didn't move a muscle.*

I stopped short of running into it. It must seem dumb - a 5'1 girl terrified of a 20" duck. Comical. But I was quivering in fear at those gray eyes, staring up at me without fear. Unblinking. Intimidating me into submission.

So naturally, I ran.

I knew I had to get away from it, or else I'd keep being bothered by it. Hoping that distance would solve my problems, I ran. Before I turned the corner, I looked behind myself. The duck had vanished.

I continued my trek home. As I got to my apartment building, I felt queasy from running. My head was dizzy, and I needed more than anything to lie down.

Then, I noticed it in the bushes.

Contrasting all the darkness was the glint of a gray eye. Upon inspection, the duck was sitting in the bush.

Watching me.

At the time I was still not sure whether I was sane or not, so I went into my apartment, hoping all would go back to normal.

About a month later, I still hadn't seen the duck again. I went over to Jackson's house for some chill time, and he got me a gift. I hadn't mentioned the duck thing to him yet, because I thought he'd be weirded out by it. Not that I thought he wouldn't believe me - he would. He was the most supportive person on earth. I just didn't want him worrying.

But then, I opened the gift.

It was a stuffed duck.

I hated to see the glee on his face as he watched me open it. "I know you love ducks, and after we saw that one earlier, I just thought I'd get you one. You seemed to love it so much." He spoke, beaming.

I loved him so much.

I smiled, but I had a lump in my throat. I couldn't lie anymore. Well, it wasn't lying, it was just not telling him everything. Still, he had to know. So I told him everything. I remember how he held me as I began to cry, and how we burned the duck plushie he got. We went out for ice cream instead to get away, and all was well.

Key word: WAS.

Until it wasn't.

This next part is hard to explain.

One night soon after that, I had a dream about the duck. It was just staring at me. I woke up with a start, and decided to head over to Jackson's. I knocked, and he didn't answer, so I guessed he was asleep, so I let myself in.

What I saw was the most terrifying thing I've ever heard of.

Jackson was lying on the floor, dead. He had a gash ripped out of his neck, and a few other small one in different areas. His eyes were gone. He was gone. My boyfriend was gone.

Beside him was it. The duck. The demon of my dreams. But that's not the worst part.

The duck had flesh hanging from its bill. *Human* flesh. *Jackson's* flesh.

Beside the duck was something familiar. Familiar, but blackened, and disfigured.

*The stuffed duck.*

Meanwhile, after observing all this, I saw the icing on the cake.

The duck's eyes were directly staring at me, and it had a maddened look in those gray hues. I screamed, but I didn't run. If I remember correctly, I shouted at the duck. I yelled loud enough to be heard, but no one came. "I hate you!" I shouted. "I HATE YOU!" Even louder. I threw my shoe at the duck, doing all I could to *make it move.* But the shoe deflected off of the duck's face. It didn't move an inch, until...

It nibbled on the skin in into mouth.

My stomach churned. I wanted to vomit, but I couldn't stop looking at the duck. If I did, I knew if would disappear. So, I sat down, and I cried. Right in front of the duck, right beside the torn apart body of my beloved. I decided to be bold.

I reached for the stuffed duck. It was all I had left, I needed it back. No matter what it symbolized.

But then, a sharp pain shot through my hand. Blood splattered everywhere. The duck had lunged at my hand and ripped off some skin, then ate it, inches from my face. Then, it just stared at me.

I still had the duck plush in my bleeding hand. I was wailing and screaming in the duck's face, but it didn't move. It stood. It watched. It stared.

I couldn't take it any longer. So, I ran.

I ran all the way home, locked the doors, and cried. I didn't know what else to do. I had no one else. My parents had disowned me for moving away, my friends were all out of town, and my boyfriend...

WAS EATEN BY A DUCK.

I cried until I threw up in the bathroom. The pain I felt that night was immeasurable to any other.

Who could I tell? Who would believe me? Only Jackson did, and he died for it.

\*\*\*

A month later, I had moved out of my apartment and into a rental house in a different state. I couldn't stay in that spot anymore. I had nothing to lose. Emily was getting married and had no time for me, so I just had to get away.

I did keep up with the news on Jackson's death. Police, FBI, and the whole shebang couldn't figure out what had happened.

*But I knew.*

All was normal for that whole month. I was used to my new place, had made a friend or two, and was working on my health with a councilor.

All was normal. Key word: WAS.

That night I couldn't sleep. I tossed and turned in my bed, and finally grabbed my phone to try and occupy myself. But after a moment, I felt something.

FEAR.

Fear that it was watching me. Then I looked up, almost like my eyes knew where to go.

*The window.*

*It was staring at me through the window.*

I screamed the most bloodcurdling scream almost ever.

I slammed the curtains shut, barred the window and door with any furniture I could find, and sat in my floor rocking back and forth, clutching my knees.

I knew I couldn't stay there forever.

Feeling sick to my stomach, I peeked through the curtains. No duck.

It's been three days since that night, and I'm isolating myself in my apartment indefinitely. I slept some last night, but I don't think I'll be doing that again soon.

EDIT: I  found duck poop in my bathtub.

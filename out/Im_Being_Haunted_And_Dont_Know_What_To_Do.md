I know the title isn't very intriguing but please hear me out.

I would like to say that my parents are separated and I am staying with my dad for the summer, otherwise I'd be with my mom.

I am also in high school.

So as I was saying, I'm pretty sure my dad's house is haunted. I can't remember when it started but it's been a few years. My dad's house is a 2 story house, you walk in and there are 2 sets of stairs, one that leads upstairs the other leads downstairs. 

A little background information: A few years ago at my little brothers birthday party (I was with my mom), my dad and stepmom came down with my little sister. They told me a story about something that had happened before they had come down. Basically, my stepmoms mother bought my sister a Raggedy Anne doll. It seemed like a completely normal doll at first but some things started happening. My sister would leave it in one place when she went to sleep and she'd wake up and it'd be in another.

One day my parents went into my sisters room and the doll was gone. They searched all over the house for it but couldn't find it.
They gave up and stopped looking for it but they claimed to see it around the house sometimes. They'd see it in the corner of their eyes and then when they'd look over, the doll would be gone.

I've always been into horror movies and I was sure they were just trying to scare me. I thought to myself "This is just like a horror movie and those aren't real." Then a few months later I went up to their house for the summer. And then I believed them.

I was around 10 at the time, I was laying in bed trying to sleep and I heard something coming from under my bed. Mind you, it couldnâ€™t have been any animals as we only have a cat and we got him recently, we didn't have any pets at the time that this part of the story takes place. I got curious and looked under my bed, not seeing anything. When I got back up, I was terrified st the sight of the doll on my bed. It was staring right at me. As a 10 year old child, it was frightening. I ran out of my room and down to my parents room, trying to wake them up. They were really tired and just shooed my away without listening to me.

I slowly crept back up the stairs to my room, when I got in there it was gone. Tears were streaming down my face as i crawled into bed and hid under the covers. I somehow fell asleep around 20 minutes later. I tried to tell them when I woke up the next morning but they said it was a bad dream. That confused me as they had been seeing the doll too.

Now, 4 years later, I haven't seen the doll since, but other stuff has been happening. We're still in the same house. The things that have been happening are small, things falling and moving from place to place. Except for a few days ago. I was heading down stairs whilst yelling at my brother because he was being a pest, and I saw something scurry into the laundry room (where our other fridge/freezer is located). 'Oh, it's just your cat'  you might say but no. My parents bedroom is also in the basement and they leave their door open (they're at work, little sis is at daycare, it's just me and my little brother), and the cat was laying on their bed, sleeping.

I slowly walked into the laundry room and the only thing that I saw was missing portion of the wall, from floor to ceiling, just thinner than a door. A person or creature could easily fit in there. I could easily fit in there, all I have to do is squeeze past the washer and dryer. 'Oh, it might have just been a rat or a squirrel or raccoon or something'. Trust me, it wasn't. It was big and human like. My brother was upstairs so it wasn't him. The thing looked like a sort of dog/human type creature, it was on all fours like a dog but it was extremely thin and had a head similar to a humans.

I quickly grabbed a bottled water and sprinted out of the laundry room and up the stairs.

Yesterday, I went downstairs to grab one of those small bags of chips. I grabbed more than one so I didn't have to go back down there, knowing that I'd want another one. Although, on of the bags was opened slightly. I know I might be overreacting and it could have been a coincidence but after I ate them, not caring that the bag was opened, I noticed that they tasted weird. A few minutes later I got a headache. Not just a normal headache, like a migraine. I took some medicine but it didn't help. I spent the rest of the day feeling sick. I then woke up in the middle of the night.

When I woke up, I saw it. It's blank eyes staring at me from the foot of the bed. It's thin body looking twisted and contorted... I tried screaming but I couldn't. I was unable to, my body wouldn't let me. I could taste blood at the back of my throat but I was frozen with fear. It took a step closer, putting one of it's... hands(?) on my bed. I stared at it as hot tears formed in my eyes. It put it's other front limb up on my bed. It slowly continued climbing onto my bed until it loomed over me, staring down at me. I was finally able to move so I scrambled out from under it and fell to the ground. When I looked up at my bed, it was gone.

Around an hour ago, I finally worked up the courage to go back downstairs. I heard something rustling in the gap in the laundry room. I grabbed some food from the freezer and ran up the stairs again. I don't want to go back down again. I'm scared. I'm still here for a little over a month and I know I can't avoid it for that long. I also know If I try to tell people they won't believe me. I don't know. 

I hate this house.

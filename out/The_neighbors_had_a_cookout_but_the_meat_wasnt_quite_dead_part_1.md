There used to be an immigrant family living in the house on the right. They moved out a few months ago, and now there's a young couple renting the place. They're very outgoing, recently inviting my housemate, Harrison, and me to a barbeque. He was busy, so I brought my friend Thiago instead. We sat out on the unused driveway between our houses drinking beer and chatting with our neighbors' friends. The couple had set up a TV so that we could watch the basketball game, too. Pleasant evening, especially considering how warm the weather is getting.

"Hon," said Greta. Greta was German and had met Aiden when studying abroad in Texas. She was cooking the sausages and burger patties on the grill while he mixed the salad. They looked like a healthy couple to me.

"What is it?" said Aiden.

"There's something wrong with the meat," she said.

I was sitting facing away from the grill but turned when she said that. "I'm good with a grill," I said. "Anything I can help with?" Even as I said it, I suspected that whatever was wrong was not something I could fix. Greta's voice sounded shaky, and she was backing away from the grill.

One of the burger patties exploded. Yes, exploded. Partially cooked meat splattered everywhere, some of it landing on Greta. She cried out and grabbed a handful of napkins to wipe it off her face. Aiden leapt forward, slamming the hood on the grill down and turning off the heat. I've seen food catch fire once or twice, but never detonate.

"Jesus, are you okay?" asked Thiago, springing out of his folding chair. Aiden leaned close to her face. The meat was only on her face for a second, but if it was hot off the grill, it might be able to burn her. I looked at the raw patties sitting on a plate next to the grill. They just sat there like dead animals do. I've flirted with going vegetarian a few times, but chorizo is just too good.

"What the hell happened?" asked Eli. He was a few years older than we were, a friend Greta and Aiden had made when they were in school. His wife Jasmine lifted the hood on the grill a crack and peeked inside, slamming it down immediately.

"The other patties are moving, too," she said.

"Where the hell did you get those?" I asked.

"Same market we always do," said Aiden. "We go there all the time, never anything like this."

Jasmine was holding the lid of the grill down, but something inside exploded, causing the hood to lift up an inch or two. "The heat must, like, activate them or something," I said. "The raw patties aren't moving."

"Maybe we should spray the ones on the grill with water," said Thiago. He raced to the front of the house and came back holding a hose. Aiden and Greta didn't have much of a yard, but they had a hose, and if heat caused the meat to, I don't know, mutate, maybe water would make them stop exploding.

Greta and Aiden looked at each other. "You knew," she said. Aiden looked shocked. One of the other patties on the grill exploded, causing Jasmine to almost lose her grip on the hood. I grabbed it and leaned against it as well. There were at least three or four more patties on the grill. I wanted this threat neutralized, whatever it was.

"Guys," said Eli. He was staring at the table that had all the side dishes on it. The basketball game was still playing but no one was paying attention to that anymore. "Did somebody eat all the casserole?"

"No," Thiago and I said at the same time. We could see from where we stood that the dish was empty. The tinfoil that had covered it lay on the ground and the food inside was no longer there. Actually, some of it was. The pasta and veggies were still there, strewn about the table and on the ground as if the meat inside had simply crawled out. A trail of pasta and veggies led from the table with the side dishes around the back of the house.

"Where the fuck is it going?" I asked.

"First things first," said Thiago. He stood in front of the grill holding the hose by the spray nozzle. "Ready?" he said.

Jasmine and I looked at each other and nodded. We lifted the hood and Thiago sprayed the remaining meat on the grill. It was pulsing like something was about to burst out of it. As the water drenched the patties and sausages, they all slowly stopped pulsing and became inanimate. I was considering going vegetarian more seriously than ever.

"So the water slows them down," I said.

"The meat in the casserole," said Thiago. "Did you get it from the same market?" Aiden nodded.

"I don't get it," said Jasmine. "The meat on the grill exploded. But the stuff in the casserole...crawled away?"

"It's the heat," said Greta. "It must be just the right amount. The heat on the grill is too much for them, but the oven was just right to make it come to life."

"You don't sound all that shocked by this," I asked. "Have you had this problem before?"

Greta glared daggers at Aiden. He could barely meet her gaze. "I didn't know," he said. "I swear I didn't know."

"What is this?" I said. "What are you talking about?"

Aiden looked at his shoes. "There's a guy at the meat counter, always says he can get me the best cuts. He doesn't put it in the display case. He says it's just for the best customers. Another time I bought that stuff from him and it made me sick. She told me not to do it again. But it tastes good. Like, really, really good. It's smooth and it's tender and goes down your throat like--"

"That's enough," said Greta. "We have to find where the meat from the casserole went. Maybe we can drown it since it doesn't like water." She picked up the cooler that had all the drinks in it. It was small, but there should be enough ice in there to do some damage to the sentient meat. "You guys with me?"

"I have my Glock in the car," said Eli. "You guys think--"

"I think that would do more harm than good," said Greta. "There's kids in this neighborhood. I think we should find other ways to fight it."

"Hey," I said to Aiden. He was hanging back from the group and looking almost catatonic. I waved my hand in his face. Normally that would be rude, but the circumstances were rather extreme. "We'll figure out blame later," I said. "Right now, we need to find where it went."

"I got you," said Aiden, meeting my gaze. He was still having a hard time looking at his girlfriend. She had told me a month ago that they were having some problems. In a way, she reminds me of my  fianc√©e, who is out of town but bonded very quickly with Greta the one time we hung out with her and Aiden. Aiden can be very funny but sometimes he seems withdrawn. A couple of times I've noticed him just sitting on his front porch and staring into the middle distance, like a soldier with PTSD or something. As for Greta, she's headstrong. Maybe a little too headstrong.

The six of us crept towards the back of the house and rounded the corner. A trail of pasta and cooked veggies led across the tiny yard and up to the house to the right of Aiden and Greta's. A friendly Filipino family lived there. They had two young children. I hadn't talked to them all that much, but one time the father knocked on my door just to ask me if I wanted to go for a hike with him and his family. I've heard that in the Midwest people go around introducing themselves to new neighbors, but we've lived near each other for a year now. Maybe they thought Harrison and I were a couple, but that's neither here nor there. What matters is that one of their windows was broken, and as the six of us came closer, we could see that there were bits of food hanging from the shards of broken glass.

"Oh fuck," said Greta. Inside the house, a child screamed. The six of us charged for the backdoor. Actually, five of us. Eli ran. I think he was going for the Glock after all. But Thiago and Jasmine rushed forward with speed I didn't know they had. Aiden and I were right behind them, with Greta still carrying the cooler. I had no idea what the meat was doing to the kids in there, but if that stuff could make Aiden sick, it could probably do a lot worse to a small [child](https://www.reddit.com/user/_Cu_Chulainn17).

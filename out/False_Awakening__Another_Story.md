Some years ago I had a dream where I was at work, but everything was just little bit different. The setup of the environment was somewhat off, the faces of people were somewhat off and I could tell something is not right. It was as if everything was the same, but at the same time, nothing was the same and it felt really scary. In my dream I talked with some coworkers and mentioned something along the lines of "I don't belong here, this is is some kind of a parallel universe." but I was quickly dismissed and laughed off.

Then I wake up (in my dream) and I'm in my room, there is faint light illuminating from the computer that's not turned off and I fall back into sleep (while still sleeping again).

I am back at my workplace and the same thing with things not being as they should be are the same, although different events are taking place. I somehow know I don't belong there and I'm starting to feel scared as to how this happened and what am I going to do.

Then I wake up for a second time (still in my dream) and it's the same setup - dim light illuminating from the computer that is not turned off, but now there is a new addition - there is someone across the room being crouched on my coffee table facing in the opposite direction. I get scared and start getting up, and as I do that, the person crouched on my coffee table starts turning around, it appears to be a some pretty woman with a slightly dark skin in her late 20s - early 30s wearing a red hoodie (with the hood up) and appears to has a black hoodie underneath and she's grinning at me as if she is glad she scared me. She looks normal, nothing scary about her appearance. As I'm getting up and she's turning around I shout (still in my dream) "Who the fuck are you?".

And at that point I finally woke up for real and the situation was the same - dim light from the computer that wasn't turned off, but at least nobody standing on my coffee table. I was 28 at the time and after that I had to sleep with the lights on and computer playing documentaries for a week.

Apparently my post was deleted, because it did not feature the minimum of five hundred words. So for that reason I am going to share another story where I had a creepy dream and was unable to sleep for a number of days.

I was walking home and was at one intersection near my home, it was February and there was some leftover snow. There was a pack of friendly stray dogs walking behind me and as I was walking and moving my hands, one of my hands touched a dog's wet nose. I was crossing the street at intersection when out of the blue, a woman wearing a black dress and a hat that looked like a chimney, which started from her neck and there was a hole for her face appeared. I looked at her and she had no face, she started shouting "Stop lying." and after I looked at her I kept on going, but she started chasing after me and I suddenly felt as if I was moving thought a fluid like gel and she wasn't affected by it and was about to catch me and before she did I woke up.

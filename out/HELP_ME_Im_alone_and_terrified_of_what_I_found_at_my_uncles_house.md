I woke up that morning to my phone ringing.

Barely awake, I slapped the buzzing phone on my nightstand as I struggled to answer the call.

“Hey Mom.”

“Hi Honey.” 

“Whats.. What’s going on?” 

“We’re you still asleep?”

“No. Of course not,” I replied as I sat up. “Did you need something?”

“I just got off the phone with your Aunt Jan. Do you remember your Uncle Charlie? Well, he’s not exactly your uncle, he’s my step brother. *Was* my step brother. Always had a few screws loose after his time in the service. We kind of lost touch over the years.”

I racked my brain and did remember him coming around one Christmas when I was a kid. He’d argued with my dad and we hadn’t seen him at any family gatherings since then.

“Yeah, sort of. He came to Christmas one year.”

“Oh yes, right. Well turns out Charlie has been holed up in this old house out in Nebraska for years, doing god knows what. He really declined in the last few years.” 

I knew the word “declined” in that sentence was code for “his drug and alcohol abuse spiraled out of control,” but I didn’t comment. We all have our demons.

“Anyway, turns out a neighbor found him last week. He’d been dead for some time.”

“Wow. That’s awful.”

“It’s horrible. I feel so ashamed that I let so much time go by without talking to him. No one seems to really know much about him anymore. He apparently kept to himself out there.”

“What was he doing in Nebraska, anyway? Everyone else is so close to home.” Home being Chicago.

“He inherited it from some relative on his dad’s side I think.” There was a pause. “Actually, that’s what I’m calling you about.”

“What?” 

“The house. Someone has to deal with it. Clean it up, get rid of the stuff. Get the property ready to sell. Apparently he doesn’t have any other relatives, except us. So the estate is reverting back to Jan and I. And I was wondering.. If you might be interested in doing it?”

I felt strangely emotionless. There was always a catch. 

“Why would I want to do that? I’m in the middle of graduate school. I’m in *Tampa,* for God’s sake.”

I know you’re in the middle of your thesis honey, but this could really help you. You could live there rent free. I know you’ve been struggling to pay your rent. And with covid, you aren’t even going to class right now. You’re just online. Who knows how long this could last.”

I felt my face get hot. I was embarrassed and resented that she knew how much I struggled to make ends meet.

She was encouraged by my silence. “Besides, if you help Jan and I out with this, we’ve decided to give you a portion of the estate sale proceedings. 30%. With the farmland, it should be more than enough to cover your student loans and give you a nice nest egg.”

It was tempting. I did some rough math in my head. It might even be worth it. And a nice, quiet space to work might be just what I needed to get my thesis finished.

I sighed. “Why aren’t you all going?” 

“I can’t. I’m busy with mom. And you know Jan has health problems. There’s not much she could do even if she did go out there. It would really mean a lot to us if you helped.”

“I’ll think about it,” I said as I hung up. 

But that was a lie- I’d already made up my mind. As much as I hated to admit it, Florida was expensive. This deal was too good to pass up for a broke college student. I stretched, and got out of bed.

 It was time to find my suitcase.

A few weeks later I found myself driving through a flat wasteland of cornfields, not a car in sight. I’d surprised myself with how easy it had been to say goodbye to my friends for the summer, sublease my apartment, and put all of my things in storage. 

This was really going to be an adjustment. Sure, I was an introvert- but being alone 24/7 wasn’t going to be easy either. Still, I was thrilled to be out of my apartment chasing new horizons. The road trip alone had been worth it. I loved watching the landscape change from coastal towns to pine forest and finally to plains.

And then there was the elephant in the room. I didn’t want to admit it, but I was burnt out from grad school. I had been working so hard. *So* hard. And then when covid hit it was like everything came unglued. I had no motivation. Fuck the data, fuck the charts. I didn’t even want to open my computer anymore. But I knew that putting it off was only going to hurt me in the long run. So when mom called, I knew this was my chance to get my shit together and finish my thesis.

“GPS SIGNAL LOST,” my phone blared suddenly, startling me. I glanced down at it in the cupholder. “Fuck,” I muttered. The complete lack of decent cell coverage out here was an absolute travesty. I punched a few buttons on my phone. I had to be close.

And suddenly, I was there.

I saw it from a distance first, and I immediately knew this was it. A massive white frame farm house lurched up out of the surrounding cornfields. In the front yard two aging silver maples towered over the front porch, providing ample shade. It was a big house, built for a large family.

But it didn’t look like any large family had lived there in a while- or anyone else who cared for it. The yard was overgrown, the paint was peeling, and some of the wood looked rotten. And that was just the exterior. 

*Can’t wait to see the inside,* I thought, my heart sinking. *What have I signed up for?*

I wheeled into the gravel driveway and shut off the car, listening to the engine ping as it cooled down. I got out and stretched, taking in a deep breath of fresh country air. 

I circled the house before going inside. In the back there was another porch and a small tool shed. The yard ended abruptly in corn stalks. *Not much to see back here,* I thought. I walked back to the front and bravely marched up the front steps. Using the key left under the doormat, I opened the shaky screen door and let myself in.

The stench hit me like a freight train. I nearly gagged. *Something has to be dead in here.* I made my way into the dim interior, hand over mouth. I ripped the curtains back on the nearest window. Sunlight illuminated a room full of hideous dirty brown carpet and mismatched furniture. I struggled with the window until it finally opened with a shriek. Weak, hot air drifted in from outside. I went around the room, opening the other windows.

The closer I got to the kitchen the stronger the odor became. *Oh crap. The fridge must be full of food.* I propped open the back door and then bravely opened the fridge. 

My stomach flip flopped at the rancid smell that wafted out. Piles of old bologna and cheese covered in soft green fur sat next to a bloated milk jug. A multitude of tiny black insects (*maggots?)* squirmed on old take out containers, and something that had maybe once been fruit was a soggy, juicy blob.

*Fuck this,* I thought, as I took a few quick steps out the back door. That smell was overwhelming, Jesus. I'd have to go nuclear on this place. I marched back to my car where I'd stashed my cleaning supplies. I masked up and then returned to the house armed with contractor bags and rubber gloves. Methodically I moved around the kitchen, filling bag after bag with rancid leftovers and moldy bread until nothing remained except a few cans of soup. 

I spent several hours deep cleaning the kitchen before assessing the rest of the home. At one time, it had truly been a lovely house but years of neglect had left it dated and dingy. Whatever my uncle was, he clearly didn't like to clean much. 

I picked the smallest and least used of the bedrooms for myself. It had a musty, shut up sort of aroma and faded blue wallpaper that was peeling at the seams. Exhausted, I flopped on the bed. *Ugh, even this is musty,* I thought, after taking a deep breath near the quilt. Sighing, I got up, stripped the bed and went around to the other bedrooms doing the same. I marched downstairs with the giant sheet ball and crammed it into the washing machine. *Well, if nothing else, at least I’ll have someplace clean to sleep. And let’s not forget it’s rent-free!*

By 6PM I needed a break. I made a peanut butter sandwich and went outside to sit on the front porch. I sat in an old creaky chair and quietly watched the cornfields across the road blow in the breeze. 

I picked up my cell phone. “Mom?”

“Hey honey. Just calling to check on you and see how things are going.”

“So far so good. I made it here earlier this morning. I’ve been cleaning for hours. You should have seen the fridge. It was a nightmare.”

“Gross. I can imagine. Listen, I just want to tell you that your Aunt and I really appreciate you taking care of this. This is no small favor you’re doing for us. Everything you do, no matter how small, helps us out in the long run.”

“I know Mom. I don’t mind. I needed a change of scenery for the summer anyway.”

“Well, Ok sweetie, I just wanted to check in. Let me know how things are going.”

“Sure Mom. Talk to you later.”

I hung up the phone. New plan of action: Each day I would work on the house in the mornings and school in the evenings. I’d go room by room, tossing the junk, setting aside valuables, and deep cleaning.

If I worked hard and stayed busy, I wouldn’t think about how alone I was, out here in this ocean of corn. The nearest town was nearly twenty miles back up the road.

And if I worked *really* hard, I would be tired every evening. Tired enough that I could fall asleep easily in a house where someone *died.* Not just died, but *rotted.*

Before I knew it, a week had passed. A week of waking up, making coffee, hauling trash out and scrubbing, making a light dinner and taking some time for my thesis. I was pleased with myself for actually writing a few pages.

The house progressed much more slowly. It was low on valuables and high on trash. Piles of magazines and old newspapers filled the corners. They were heavy to move and made me cough from dust. Worthless clutter filled the shelves and boxes lined the floor. All of it went into the garbage. Mom had arranged for a dumpster to be brought by, thank God. I have no clue what I would have done without it. So far, I’d only found one shoebox of old jewelry and watches that I thought could be worth pawning.

My first visitor arrived as I was dragging a Victorian chair with a broken leg and busted seat out the front door. An old, creamy white Cadillac pulled into the gravel drive. I could tell it was old because it was square. I paused, surprised to see someone. I’d been out here for days without seeing a soul.

An older, clean cut gentleman stepped out of the car and walked up to me. I leaned on the saggy chair. 

“Hi there,” I ventured.

“Hey neighbor,” he replied as he walked up. “How’s cleanin’ this place out goin’ for ya?”

“Fine,” I wasn’t sure what to say. “Big mess.”

“You by yourself out here doing all this work?”

He phrased it pleasantly enough, but the question always made me uncomfortable. There’s really no good way to tell a strange man that you’re alone.

“My mom’s coming down later this week.”

He nodded. “Well the reason I stopped by is that I’m an antiques dealer. Have you come across anything valuable or that you’d like to sell? I thought I’d stop since you’re clearin’ out.”

I thought about it, and shrugged. “There’s a lot of older furniture but it’s not in good shape. I did come across some jewelry, are you interested in that?”

“Sure, I’ll take a look.” 

“Wait here, I’ll be back.” 

I fetched the shoebox from upstairs and brought it back to the porch. He opened the box and poked around.

“$750 for the whole box.” 

I was shocked. I hadn’t expected to get a fraction of that from a pawn shop. 

“Sold,” I said, smiling. 

He grinned, and pulled a roll of cash from his pocket. As he paid me, he handed me a card with his phone number. “You call me if you find anything else.” I waved from the porch as he returned to his car and drove off.

*Well that was unexpected,* I thought, fingering the money. But maybe not. I had noticed a lot of the furniture that I sat out by the road was gone the next day. I was fine with people taking it- one less thing for me to deal with. Later that week another man in a red pickup truck offered me $25 for a set of chairs. I took it, and was happy to see them go. *Maybe stopping to buy someone’s trash is just a country thing,* I thought.

*It’s not so bad out here,* I thought as I sat on the porch later that evening. It was peaceful. Private.

But there was one thing I didn’t like- the corn.

I stared across the road at the endless sea of cornstalks. The corn made me feel closed in, claustrophobic. Like it could be hiding anything- or anyone. I had the uneasy feeling that something was watching me. *You're being stupid,* I thought. But the feeling remained.

The house was unsettling too. The house was quiet- *too* quiet. It creaked and groaned like any other house, but the lack of TV, road traffic, and other people made it seem even emptier than it was. I called my mom every day just to hear her voice. Then I would work on my dumb thesis paper, forcing myself to type each excruciating word instead of think about how alone I was.

The first night I slept here I was on edge listening to the wind rustle the trees and the house creak. I tried not to think about my uncle’s dead, decaying body. I didn’t sleep much.

After that, I took matters into my own hands. I’d spotted Uncle Charlie’s liquor stash under the sink on that first day. I found a strong nightcap of bourbon was enough to give me eight hours of deep sleep.

The booze stash wasn’t the only thing I found. I’d unearthed several baggies of coke in one of the nightstands, and numerous pill bottles- just evidence that he’d been there. But the house seemed to have very few personal items of his, aside from the clothes in the closet. 

Until I found the keys.

As I’d worked my way through the house I found several sets of keys. The first set were door keys, and they opened the front and back doors- duplicates of the ones I had.

The second set opened the tool shed in the backyard. I groaned when I saw all the stuff in there I would have to go through.

But the third set was different. They were small keys- not for doors. I kept them around on the kitchen counter for a few days, wondering what they unlocked every time I passed by. I suspected they went to a tool box or something.

So when I spotted the filing cabinet in the back of the third bedroom I thought maybe I was in luck. 

Sure enough, the keys unlocked it. I was expecting a ream of old tax returns, water bills, maybe some important documents.

It was just shoeboxes. Puzzled, I opened the top one. They were filled with Polaroids. I sat the box down and picked up a handful, grimy with age. I was shocked. They were nudes- *all* of them. "Freaky," I murmured. 

These were some of the first interesting- and personal- items I'd found. I sat down and thumbed through them. It felt voyeuristic. Some of the people were tied up or in handcuffs. *Who are all these people?*

I pulled out all the shoeboxes. Some of them were just snapshots- I sat those aside. I finally pulled out the last box and opened it.

It was filled with Polaroids too. But these were different. I frowned as I looked at them before dumping them on the ground and spreading them out. 

The Polaroids showed people, mostly women, bound, gagged, blindfolded, and naked. I moved them around on the floor, grouping them. There were a few shots of each person- A "before" and an "after." The “afters” showed them slumped over, or face down, bloody or in pools of blood. Some of them were mutilated beyond recognition.

My heart raced. I’d clearly stumbled upon something I wasn’t supposed to see. Something dangerous. *Who were these people? Was my uncle… killing people out here? In this house?* My hands shook as I picked up a few shots and scrutinized them. My eyes grew wide. Many of the shots showed dingy brown carpet that looked extremely familiar. I kept flipping through them. One showed a woman facedown on a bed in a room with blue wallpaper. 

The blue wallpaper in *my room.*

 My chest grew tight. People had spent their last moments in the room *I was sleeping in*.

"What the fuck," I hissed through my teeth.

I grabbed the first box of snapshots I had glanced at. Maybe there were more. I rifled through the box for a minute until one photo stopped me cold. I pulled it out. I was having trouble breathing.

It was a snapshot of a man. I knew this man- apparently he was my uncle. But that's not where I recognized him from.

The photo clearly depicted a younger version of the man in the Cadillac. The man who bought the jewelry. The jewelry that had likely belonged to his victims. 

My mind raced. I felt like I was having a panic attack. This was bad. *HE SAW YOU, HE KNOWS YOU'RE HERE, HE KNOWS YOU'RE ALONE,* my brain screamed.

I don't know who's body the neighbor found on the floor. I guess it was more decayed than I'd imagined. Unrecognizable. And for all I know, it wasn’t a “neighbor” that “found” him at all. 

What I do know is my uncle's still out there. Still hunting. Still killing. And I could be next.

I'm scared and I don't know what to do. I know I should call the police, but my instincts tell me to grab my stuff and run before he comes back here and sees what I’ve found.

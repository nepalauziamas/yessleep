I wasn’t sure if people would want to hear about my job some more. I’m glad they do. Before I tell you guys what happened yesterday, I’d like to clarify a few things. 

Not every human gets a demon, every demon gets a human. The chances that you’ll take something home is low. Sometimes there isn’t a possibility at all if the pet chooses one of the actors. 

There are 6 levels of "danger," with 6 being the *I’m not getting home without a near heart-stopping even*t level. I typically handle level 2s and 3s. It isn’t until I read it’s a level 5 or 6 that I start to worry. The boss promises nothing will happen to me in the house while he’s there. I’m not sure how much of that I believe. 

Regarding the woman who shows up, she did return according to one of the actors. He saw her down the road as he drove in. There was no mistaking it was her, except she came walking. Granted, it’s only two miles away from the nearby city, but it’s a dirt road mostly. You get off the highway and turn onto a dirt road for most of the trip. 

He told the boss once he got in. The boss left shortly after and told me he’d be back soon. He returned just before the group going through finished their trip. I don’t know what happened, and he told me not to worry about it. 

I think I should be. 

Onto what I originally was going to share- yesterday I had to work two shifts. Normally, I come in at 10:30 AM to help set up and ensure all the doors are functioning. To clarify, we don’t have an "artifact" (which is seeming more like meaningless, random objects nowadays) in every room. I set *one* object in a room for the day. Whether or not the demon chooses a person in that group is up to the pet. From my time being here, it’s always gone by the third group. That’s what my boss has told me, at least. He’s the one who can sense when it has left.

On average, we have seven groups come through. The demon is let out (or allowed out) when the first group arrives. It can choose a human from that group, or simply not. The lights and doors are cut and shut off for effect, and to disguise it leaving the object. Sometimes they break. 

My day ends at 5:30 PM before the next group goes. That is when my co-worker arrives and does their own checking of the system. Yesterday, however, my co-worker did not come in. 

Well, she did, but not into the room I’m stationed in (we call it the cave because of the lack of light). To get to the cave, you enter the break room and open the door to the right of the round table. The actors have started using the break room as a place to get ready or touch up because they don’t like being in the back house. Boss has asked they stop using the break room as a changing room, but they refuse. I can’t use the restroom out there without getting some makeup they left on the sink on me. There’s nothing like seeing bloody fingerprints on the sink and then getting it on my white shirt. 

I would love not to have to sit in the cave for hours on end and have a house instead. I’m not friends with any of the actors as most are new, but I think I’ll ask why they aren’t keen on being back there. The last actors had no problem with that. 

But as I was saying, my co-worker comes in and starts rambling about how it’s messed up to scare the other employees. I had just left the cave when she started accusing one of the actors of chasing her back into one of the rooms. And what room was it? My favorite of them all! The baby’s room. 

She was doing a final check on the cameras to make sure all of the guests from the last group were out. We’ve had a few people try to stay overnight, so she does this every time she has the second shift. 

On the camera, she noticed a man open the closet door and get in. She radioed for one of the actors ( who is security in disguise), but he wasn’t answering. It’s midnight, she’s ready to go home and was not about to let this man keep her any longer. So she went upstairs and marched into the room. Of course, there was no man in the closet, which pissed her off even more. Now she was going to go find security and have them deal with it. 

She left the room and only got halfway down the hall when the actor she was currently mad at left the room. In her words, "he crawled out of the f-ing room and f-ing stared at me." He was on all fours, his body facing the wall in front of him, and his head was turned in her direction. 

If he had done this to me, I would have gotten startled. I would have even been scared if he crawled toward me while he repeated my name as he had done to her. 

He claims he had not done that and the other actors backed him up. Once the last group has left the house, all actors are free to return to the back house. Like I said earlier, they don’t like the back house but were forced to go back there by the boss. He was not a fan of having them crowd the break room, and neither was I. 

However, she was adamant he was there, and he crawled toward her at an alarming rate. In my last post, I said the doors can only be locked and unlocked from the cave. Even if she closed the door, it would not lock. She re-entered the room and closed it, using her body to keep it closed. She said she yelled at him to stop messing around like that and all she wanted was to go home. "He" laughed at her and kept trying to open the door, going as far as slamming his body against it to try and get it to open. She’s balling her eyes out and yelling at him to stop and for the other people in the house to make him stop. 

It was no longer than five minutes before it all went quiet. No more banging on the door or laughing but just her cries. 

She waited another five minutes before opening the door and checking to see if he was gone. The doors that were once open were now all closed. She was scared he was in one of the rooms waiting for her, so she booked it down the hall and stairs. 

Once inside the cave, she grabbed her stuff and ran out. 

Now she was standing in front of us, telling us this while looking scared. She was employed after I was, and I was the one who taught her how to work the controls, when she had to do what, what to do when the doors wouldn’t lock or unlock, and how to shut the system down. Out of everyone there, she was the one I felt closest with despite barely seeing much of her. Knowing what she experienced made me offer to cover her shift. Yeah, I was tired, but she looked petrified. 

I take the first shift, and she takes the second. This is what works best for both of our schedules. The part-time worker occasionally comes in, so our shifts are shorter. 

While she went home, I returned to the cave and finished with the rest of the groups. I could hear the actors talking but didn’t feel like talking with them. I’m not saying I believe they’re pulling some sick prank on the employees who have been there the longest, but that isn’t *not* a possibility either. Another option is that whatever came after her was supposed to leave long before closing time but didn’t. 

I seriously hope that’s not the case. I have the second shift today.

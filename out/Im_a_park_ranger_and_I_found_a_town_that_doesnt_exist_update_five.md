I followed Irene back to her house in Hungry Horse. I was hoping to kill her, but right as I was about to enter through a window in the basement I heard her say, “You dumbasses ready yet? We just need five more humans and I’ll be powerful enough to open another hellgate, I want to open the next one in Canada!”

I backed away looking in through a window on the bottom floor, and I saw about twenty of the townspeople gathered inside.

That’s when I turned and ran. I ran as fast as I could, dialing John’s number as I crossed Hungry Horse’s border back into Yellowstone.

John answered his phone almost immediately.

"Where are you?" He asked.

I ignored his question and asked one of my own instead.

"Are there any people camping in Yellowstone tonight?” I asked.

"I'm not sure, why?" He asked.

"Irene only needs to take five more people before she can create another town! And she’s got a group together to go out and find some!” I said.

He swore under his breath.

"How big is the group?” I asked.

"About twenty." He said.

"Alright. Listen, I have a plan. We need to stop her before she can take more people, are there any people camping close to Hungry Horse?" I questioned him.

"There's a bunch camping anround Old Faithful." He said.

"How far away are we from them?” I asked.

"I don't know exactly, its hard to tell how far away anything is in Montana at night, but they should be within half an hour or less." He answered.

"Alright. Listen, I have a plan. Can you get to the campground before midnight?" I asked.

"Yeah, I can be there in thirty minutes." He answered.

"Good, get your gear together, and meet me at Glacier. Don't forget to bring your guns!" I ordered.

"Roger that, see you at Glacier." He said.

I hung up the phone and stared at it for several seconds before dialing Oxbloods number.

"Ah Samu-" I cut him off.

"No time! I need you to send a team out to the campground at Glacier!” I told him.

"Alright, I'll have a team heading out as soon as possible." He answered.

I hung up the phone as I began to run faster than any human has ever run before. I thought about Irene and how close she was to opening another hellgate. I was filled with rage knowing that I might die trying to stop her, but I couldn't think about that now. I needed to focus on what I was doing. If Irene opened another gate, who knows what will happen.

The moon was slowly rising into the sky, casting long shadows across the ground. The air was cold, the temperature dropping as I ran. I could hear the sounds of the wolves chasing their prey somewhere nearby. As I ran towards the campground near Glacier I could smell smoke emanating from the campground. I shivered at the familiar scent and continued to run.

As I got closer to Glacier, I noticed the campground was packed full of tents and RVs. I started hearing gunshots and screams. I looked around frantically for A.R.C operatives, but it didn't appear that they were here yet. There was a large fire burning in the middle of the campground. It looked like someone had set it.

I kept running, weaving between the tents, until I found a tent that was completely shredded on one side and engulfed in flames.

There was a body inside, it was completely mangled. I could barely make out any details of the person's face. There was no way of telling what race or sex the corpse was. But whoever this person was, they definitely weren't a friend of Irene's.

I looked around the campground again and saw nothing but chaos. People were screaming, crying, and running away from Irenes monsters as John fought them off.

Suddenly I heard the sound of a helicopter, I looked up at the night sky and saw an A.R.C helicopters swooping in. It hovered over the middle of the campground, their lights shining brightly.

"A.R.C! Come on, hurry!" I yelled.

I was still a few hundred feet away from the fight when I saw one of those… things, jump onto the roof of an RV, and launch itself at the helicopter. It smashed through the cockpit window and tore the pilot out of her seat. I watched helplessly as the helicopter careened out of control, crashing into the last section of the campground that wasn’t blocked by Irene’s people. The helicopter exploded, sending debris everywhere and causing panic amongst the remaining campers.

I took off running, making my way towards the center of the campground where John and his men were fighting the creatures. He kept them at bay, but they were slowly overwhelming him. That’s when Irene grabbed him by the throat and lifted him off the ground, her face inches from his, her long red nails glistening in the moonlight.

"What do you think you're doing?" She growled.

John struggled to speak. "Why are you doing this? What do you want?" He wheezed.

She leaned in closer and brought her lips to John’s ear.

“What do I want?” She whispered, then pushed him back, sending him flying into the dirt. “I want your world.” She yelled. She pointed at John and the campers. “And nothing you can do will stop me!” She roared with laughter. She stepped forward and placed her foot on John's neck. “Now you’re going to watch as my people slaughter every single person you were trying to protect!”

My vision went red and I let out the loudest, most visceral roar I’ve ever heard. The fighting instantly stopped as everyone winced and covered their ears. Everyone but Irene that is. Irene turned and snarled at me. 

“Hey AssButt!” I sneered at her.

Well looks like I’m fighting Irene I thought to myself. 

If I don’t update you guys within forty-eight hours I probably lost the fight. Wish me luck I really could use it.

 After being cheated on, all I wanted to do was hide. I didn’t need a girls night out. I didn’t need a self-care routine, and certainly I was not in need of any pity from my friends and family. I wanted to be alone, just for one day at least, to gather my thoughts and prepare myself mentally to move forward. Four years together is quite some time, not a life-waster though. I am no cry baby to get all depressed about it. Everyone thought I would.

Having all that in mind, I booked a cabin in the woods on one of those slow-vacation booking sites. It was called „Closer to Heaven” - minimalist, far away from society, barely functioning internet, very weak cell phone service, but a big and luxurious bathroom. Perfect.

I got there on Thursday evening - beautiful little wooden paradise in the middle of forest clearing. The owners, Mike and Elle, drove me from the nearest town to the exact location and showed me around. They were a nice, elderly couple, looking rather tired. I was kind of expecting someone rich who just lives out of renting out expensive wooden cabins to city rats like myself. I found their appearance strange, even intimidating, because of their weirdly greasy hair, stained clothes and very dark fingertips. 

\- So, do you live close by, or… - I asked the lady, while her husband was preparing wood for the chimney. Her eyes were wide open, and when she looked at me, she looked terrified.

\- Oh. No. We live far away - she made a gesture towards a path through the woods. - You know… - Elle lowered her voice, peeping at her husband, as if to check if he hadn’t listened to our conversation. - I think you should stick to the clearing. Steer clear of the deep woods. I know, it limits you, but there’s…

\- Honey! - Her husband’s strong voice made me jump. I got chills running down my spine. - Why are you scaring guests again?

Mike put his hands on Elle’s shoulders and she shivered slightly, before putting on the worst, the most abused smile I have ever seen.

\- You are right, sweetie - she said calmly. - It’s a true paradise. I was being silly.

\- We think you’re going to love it here. It brings people closer to heaven - he added.

\- I like the forest clearing best- Elle grabbed my arm with lots of strength, still smiling widely. - I really hate all the nasty bugs that are hidden in deep woods - I froze until Mike took her hand away from mine. He told us that it was time to leave me and let me rest. 

After an awkward goodbye ceremony, they head out to their car, leaving me here alone for 5 days with food to last me two weeks. I got scared by Elle’s antics, not gonna lie - at first, that is. But the poor woman seemed generally unwell. I still had my own messed up head and broken heart to deal with. In the next few days, I may even look for some nasty bugs Elle warned me about.

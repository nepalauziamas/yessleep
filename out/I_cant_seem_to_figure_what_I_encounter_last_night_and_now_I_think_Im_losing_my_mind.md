   For some back story, sometimes when I can’t sleep I go sit out back at the family graveyard. I know it’s not like this everywhere, but here in Chestnut Mound, Tennessee you’re allowed to bury your family right on your property. My family has owned this land for generations and there are 2 family cemeteries here. 

   One of the cemeteries is more recent, this is the one where I usually hang out.  It is well maintained and all the graves have nicely upkept grave houses.  Then there is one that is much older a few hundred feet behind the newer one. The old grave houses have mostly rotted away and the headstones have faded to a point where they cannot be read anymore, it’s separated from the other cemetery by a row of trees. I don’t keep the old one up as much as I should because I don’t really know who’s in those graves and they’re so old and dilapidated it would be a lot of time and money I don’t have to restore them. 

   Anyways, while I was out at the new cemetery I heard crying coming from the old one. It sounded like a man, and like a very real man, not faint or ghastly at all. Peaking through the tree line I couldn’t see much, but I saw a glowing light like maybe that of a candle. There shouldn’t be any other people in this lot, its private property so I am a little put off by seeing someonethere, but I’m not the only descendant of the people buried there, maybe he is older, maybe he knew them amd can tell me about them. 

   I always carry the old pistol my papaw gave me when I’m out in the wooded areas of these hills just in case I wander into some wildlife that would rather make lunch than friends; so I wasn’t too frightened by the idea of approaching the man I heard, but when I came through the treeline I felt my heart fall into my kneecaps as I was frozen by fear and confusion. He - it wasn’t a man. Hunkered over, scavanging through one the graves under an old decrepit gravehouse was a creature like I’ve never witnessed before. 
  
   It looked like a coyote, but was humanoid like a werewolf. It looked emaciated and mangy, it’s head was mostly skeletal with barely any skin left. When it turned to face me I realized what I had seen earlier was not a candle but the orange glow of the creatures eyes. I could still hear the crying only it didn’t seem to be coming from the coyote thing. It raised one of its paws to its mouth revealing long, sharp, boney finger like claws. 

   When I tried to move it screeched out loudly at me, making a sound like it was being torn limb for limb. I considered shooting it, but it didn’t move toward me yet, and I didn’t want it to because I had no idea how fast it was. It just stared at me a while before slowly moving on to digging through another forgotten grave. When it was no longer looking at me anymore I ran as fast as I could back to my house and locked all my doors. I’m still not sure what that was.  

   When I was a little kid my mamaw, a very traditional Melungeon woman, said that we make gravehouses to protect deceased loved ones from a creature that devours lost souls. She called it a D'gogwa.  She said they come from humans who are cursed by their unforgivable actions like cannibalism, rape, slavery, etc. They are cursed to roam the earth, with an insatiable hunger, looking for souls to eat up. Was what I saw a D'gogwa? Were the cries coming from it or the soul it was eating? I’m thinking it’s time to clean up those old graves and give them new houses.

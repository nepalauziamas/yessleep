A house that was being built in our quiet neighborhood had collapsed when a sinkhole formed seemingly overnight and swallowed it. Things had seemed to have been going smoothly with the construction. I would know, my father was in charge of it, and now he had a near million dollar mess to clean up six doors down from our home. 

For the past week, my father had been coming home irritated and exhausted from the day’s work. But yesterday was different- he came home quiet and withdrawn. It was not something I'd seen often, he was scared. 

Of course, he’d never open up about how he was feeling. It was a trait of desperate stoicism that honestly had caused a strain in my parent’s marriage a few times. I tried prying about what had spooked my dad but I got nothing but grunts and other inaudible noises indicating he didn't want to talk about it. 

I was stubborn, I pried and pried and eventually I got an answer…

“There’s something dangerous nobody warned me about at the site, ok!?” he blurted out. 

I think getting even that touch of emotion off of his chest made him feel better. He sighed, and continued. 

“There were holes in the foundation, and I saw something that shouldn’t be there.” 

“What did you see in the holes, pops?” I tried to spur the conversation more.

“I can’t explain it, and I won't. Shit, I doubt even the police would believe me if I filed a report. Now, get to bed, you got work in the morning” he ended the conversation and went to the bathroom. I wasn’t going to interrogate him there. I took the hint, I got what I wanted. I was going to investigate the site myself, and see what could scare the nearly fearless man that is my father. 

Sneaking out of the house late at night while my parents were still up was not an option. They were too alert and fairly light sleepers. However, doing morning shifts at the coffee shop nearby meant that I would be up in the early hours, and even if they did wake up they’d assume it was for work. I had a hard time sleeping with the anticipation of my plan, but I managed to get at least four hours in.

My phone’s alarm woke me up- 4:30AM, an hour before I’d normally be up. Everything was business as usual, except I snagged a powerful but small flashlight that my father kept in the house. If holes in the foundation of a larger house are anything like some of the caves i’ve hiked in, then my phone’s flashlight wouldn’t be strong enough. 

I made it to the house, or what was left of it anyways. Not much remained besides the foundation. I scaled the site fence, making an effort to keep it quiet. 

The sinkhole wasn’t insanely deep, and there were enough uneven clumps of dirt, foundation, and rebar to properly climb up and down the hole. I wonder if my father took the same way down? 

I reached the bottom, where there was a few inches of water that soaked my shoes. Frustrated, I swung my bag to my front so I could change into my work shoes, the more expendable ones. 

That's when I heard it.

A scratching sound, like something dragging a stick against some bricks. It produced a small echo as well. I forgot about my shoes and went into high alert. I’d be kicking myself if this mysterious noise was just a rat or something.

I shone the powerful  flashlight in the direction of the noise. 

A hole in the foundation, though calling it a hole was an understatement. This hole was a tunnel roughly six feet tall. The scratching sound persisted, but slowly grew more quiet. I deduced whatever was making the noise was moving further down the tunnel.

Too stubborn and prideful to turn back, I quickly checked the time and realized I had more time to spare than I had thought. I could pursue the noise, see what it was, and get the fuck out of there and to the boring coffee shop without anyone noticing. 

Carefully I crept down the tunnel, flashlight in tow. It was cold and the air was stale and dusty. I threw on an extra jacket that I packed in my bag for good measure. Much of the tunnel’s walls became dirt and rocks. I was truly underground. I could hear the scratching sound slowly get louder– I was getting closer to it. 

I neared a corner where I spotted what I can only describe as a rat’s tail quickly slink around the bend of the tunnel. It seemed a bit big for a rat, maybe it was a possum’s? Frustrated thinking my hunch was just a rodent I picked my pace up and darted around the corner. It seemed like the tunnel stretched deep down. I sighed, inhaling a pungent smell. I was expecting to see a family of possums or rats or something and then I would leave and go about my day. 

Boy was I wrong.

I heard a shriek while my flashlight was down. The scratching had stopped, too. Annoyed but desperate for clarity, I raised my flashlight to peer down the tunnel and immediately jolted back.

Maybe fifteen feet away, stood a humanoid figure. It was larger than me, but not by much. Attached to its rear was the ratty tail I saw going around the corner. It was naked but covered in a peach fuzz type of hair. It turned around to face me, and I saw the beady eyes, large rat ears, and crooked, large teeth. It began violently scratching at the wall as it shrieked again and I spotted with the flashlight more pairs of beady eyes that reflected the light.

Much farther away than the first monster, but these ones were crawling on the ceiling of the tunnel. They shrieked in unison towards me. The closest one dropped on all fours and also crawled towards me.

I booked it out of there, thankfully not a long distance. These things were in pursuit, and I felt a clawed hand clutch my jacket. I tugged away and toppled into the old foundation of the house. I was back outside. Preparing to get mauled by a family of rat-creatures, I let out a scream as I flailed around to get up from the mess of rebar and mud. The cold air hit my back, this thing had torn a hole in my jacket. 

I took a quick glance as I scrambled out of the sinkhole. These creatures didn’t exit their tunnel, instead the main one was chewing on the chunk of my jacket that it had tornout. I saw their beady eyes glaring at me as they slowly crept back into their tunnel. 

Shaken, I managed to get into work on time, covered in filth. I had to play off the fact that I was spelunking a rat tunnel, and made up a bullshit excuse as to why I was so dirty and dazed. My manager sent me home, out of concern, not irritation. 

I know why my dad is scared of that site now. I sure as hell don’t want him going back to it, and I don’t think he’ll have to if he contracts the job out to some other unlucky soul. Hopefully they didn’t attack him, seeing those things was frightening enough.

Unfortunately, someone else may encounter them soon: Two doors down from the site, [a sinkhole had begun to swallow the resident's garage](https://www.reddit.com/user/ThrowAwaytheCJ).

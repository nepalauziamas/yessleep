Me and my friends used to explore abandoned or supposedly haunted houses in the city. We were all pretty into that type of stuff, we thought it'd be really cool to go through a run down or "ghost filled" house. This particular story was a little while back when I was about 16 and my friends Jake and Anne were both 15. We found out about an abandoned apartment building by one of our friends, once we did we got our things together and headed to it.

When we would explore places we usually took walkie talkies, flashlights, a crowbar, and a knife each just in case. Once I packed all my things I headed outside where Jake and Anne were waiting on their bikes, "Took ya' long enough Xan." Jake said. I went over and got on my bike, "Can it, you got the address?" I replied. "Yup, how about we get going?" Anne answered. We all started peddling down the street to head to the apartment.

&#x200B;

"So what's the story behind the place?" I asked my friends as we rode our bikes. "The place was built in the 70s but kept getting lawsuits because it wasn't up to the right standards. Eventually it got shut down, the town hasn't had the chance to get rid of it." Anne told me. "Over a dozen people were injured from the shitty maintenance and two ended up dying." Jake reported. "Sounds like fun." I chuckled. It didn't take us long to reach the apartment and once we did we looked it up and down.

&#x200B;

The apartment looked old and withered, having boarded up windows and a boarded up door preventing entry. The other windows looked smashed or dirty enough for you not to be able to see through them. "Jesus, I think this is the shittiest place we've seen yet." Jake chuckled as he handed me the crowbar he brought. "Let's get this over with, I don't like the vibe of this place." Anne advised. We went up to the door where I used the crowbar to pry off the boards, once they were off the door practically swung open. We all took our flashlights out and turned them on before heading into the decrepit apartment. "Well this isn't much better." I groaned.

&#x200B;

On the inside of the apartment in the lobby were tossed over chairs, holes in both the floor and ceiling, and there was spray paint almost everywhere. "Not the most inviting environment." Anne commented. We spread out to look around the lobby with me going behind the main desk. I opened one of the drawers with a loud creak and found a family of cockroaches crawling around some keys, making me shiver. I closed the drawer and went back to meet back up with my friends. "Let's check out the floors." Jake pitched.

&#x200B;

We found the stairs leading up and carefully went up them to the first floor. "Jake you check out this floor, we're gonna' head up to the others." I told Jake. "Sounds good to me, keep your walkies on." Jake replied. We continued heading up the stairs to the next floor, "You okay checking out the third floor on your own?" Anne asked me jokingly. "I think I can handle myself." I chuckled. Anne went into the second floor leaving me to head up to the final floor. I turned my flashlight on as the third floor was darker than the others, it looked like there weren't any windows to let in any light. "Creep city." I shuttered.

&#x200B;

I started looking through the rooms, least the ones I could get into, to find anything worthwhile. As I was looking around and walking down the hall I saw something on the floor and shined my light on it.  I was staring at a fresh trail of blood, leading down the hall and around the corner. I grabbed my walkie talking and pressed down the button, "Hey guys, I just found something really fucking freaky." I reported. "What is it?" Anne asked. "A trail of blood, what should I do?" I told them. "Follow it, maybe somebody needs help." Jake answered. "That doesn't exactly sound like a good idea." Anne advised. "Neither does coming to an abandoned apartment where two people died but we're here." Jake retorted. "I'm just gonna' follow it, keep your walkies handy." I told my two friends before putting away my walkie talkie.

&#x200B;

I headed down the hall to follow the blood, the whole time my hair was standing up on my arms. The walls looked like they were about to fall apart with holes in them along with peeling wallpaper. I turned down the hall and saw something disgusting, on the floor in the blood trail were pieces of entrails. I was beginning to sweat and shake as I kept following the blood trail to the end of the hall. I turned into a room and saw the most horrifying sight. There looked to be a homeless man on top of a woman, he was shoveling the organs of the woman into his mouth using a knife. Pieces of organs fell from the man's mouth like he'd been starving and this woman was his first meal in ages.

&#x200B;

My light alerted the man and he looked at me, I quickly took my knife out and swung it open. "Y-you stay the fuck back!" I shouted out with my voice shaking in fear. The man got up and then ran at me, I quickly ran off down the hallway to get away. I didn't get far before I slipped on the blood and fell face first onto the ground. Before I could get up the man chasing me got on top of me and bit down into my shoulder that was covered by a jacket that thankfully protected me, however it didn't protect my left side from being stabbed. I screamed out in pain and instinctively elbowed the man off of me. I turned around and slashed at the man's face to get him away, allowing me to get up and run down the hall. I grabbed my walkie and pressed down the button, "Guys we need to get out, now!" I shouted into the walkie.

&#x200B;

Thankfully I reunited with my friends downstairs where we ran out of the apartment, pushing the door we came through closed. I doubled over on the ground as I held my heavily bleeding wound, "Come on, let's get him to my house. My dad can fix him up." Jake said. I managed to get on my bike and pedal away to Jake's house. Once we were there I got patched up, we then called the cops and I told them what happened. The police searched the building but only found the body of the woman. I don't know why the man was doing what he did, maybe from drugs or just desperation, but what I saw that night will forever stick with me and I will never explore abandoned buildings ever again.

Ever since I was
little, I wanted that fairytale ending. To love and grow old with
somebody, and after a long life peacefully go together to whatever lied
next. I was lucky enough to get most of that. I got fifty wonderful
years with Ethan, and it all went by so quick that before either of us knew it,
it was almost over.

And I thought I was prepared for
this part. I thought I would be okay. But it turned out so much worse than I
could have ever thought.

I never thought death would have
so much… dying. Slowly and painfully, I watched my husband wither away into
a husk of his former self. It started with his frustration trying to pick
up his glasses. Then when he couldn’t get up the stairs. His body would
get a little worse each day, until eventually I realized he could not even
muster the goodnight kiss I looked forward to every night. And one day I found
myself trapped in this hospital at his side, just prolonging the inevitable. 

I am beyond selfish. I had so
many chances to stop his pain. But even as those burning eyes begged me to
let him go, I still kept on for hope that he would get better. I ignored
his anguished groans and those endless tears like a monster. I just didn’t
want to be alone. 

If only the doctors hadn’t given
in to me staying overnight. The endless drone of the heart monitor
tortured us. And that howling wind that never stopped pounding the
window. It mocked me. I stared with desperate eyes at Ethan, fearing if I
looked away even for a second, he would be gone. But I was tired, and my
eyes began to flutter on their own anyway.

Just a little after I drifted off,
I awoke to a soft pattern of footsteps coming closer. The door creaked
open to reveal a large and bearded man.

“Well, this is obviously the
Harpers.” The man said with a nervous chuckle, adjusting his crooked
glasses. “I’m Dr. Puffer. I usually work the nights so you don’t know me,
but I heard you were staying and this may be the only chance I get. Can we
talk? I have something I think we’ll all like very much.”

I so badly needed a break from my
racing thoughts that I tolerated… well, whatever on Earth happened in that next
half-hour. I expected him to eventually crack and laugh at this insane joke
he spewed, but he just kept going. Paper after paper of this science
fiction, and his smile just grew wider and his voice more excited. It was
only after the fifteenth one did I manage to catch him between breaths.

“There’s no- no way you can be
serious about this. This is-”

“I know.” Dr. Puffer sighed. “When
I started this as a side project everyone called me crazy too. But it’s real.
Made possible by decades of research and some very unfortunate…
trial-and-error. You’ll both be linked to a sort of… realm of mind to experience
together. It’ll all be to your liking, and when you’re both done, it fades
out. Acts just like a dream. I admit this is still new and my team needs
to work out some kinks, but the benefits greatly outweigh…”

My swelling tears caused Dr.
Puffer to trail off. No rational part of me could believe a word, but
everything in me wanted it to be true. He tried to comfort me by putting
his hand on my shoulder, which I could only return by trying to kill him with
daggers in my eyes alone. We just stared at each other for a while, stuck at
a standstill. Dr. Puffer cracked first.

“Look, I know you’ll have to make
a difficult decision soon. No one has eyes like that otherwise. You
feel cheated. But with this, you both at least can- “

“And what do you know about us!?”
I hissed at him, finally slapping his hand away. “How can you know
what I’m going through? You can’t expect me to believe any of this!”

Dr. Puffer remained calm, but his
smile faded, and his voice turned somewhat stern.

“Well, I know a little. My mom
passed away like this too, and all I wanted in the world was to spend one last
good day with her. But I couldn’t. I just helplessly watched her slip away in a
cold room like this. I can’t help her now, but I can still help someone else. I
thought you’d be like me and want to take any chance to get you both some closure.
Or was I wrong?”

In my younger days I would’ve
given him what for, but at my age I had to settle for shooing and casting him
down the hallway. As he was halfway down, he suddenly turned and called to
me.

“I can only give you a day to
decide! When you’re ready, you have my card!”

My eyebrows furrowed. “Your
card? You never gave me- “

Sure enough, there was something
poking me from the side. The black and gold lettering on Dr. Puffer’s card
was hard to focus on, the letters seeming to shift and move around on their
own. And just for a moment, I swear it said something else. I wanted
to ask Dr. Puffer about it, but by the time I raised my head, he had already
vanished.

Back in my chair, I twirled the
card, somehow filled with even greater dread than before. I spent the next few
hours darting my eyes from the card to Ethan and back. 

“Why couldn’t this have been
you?” I practically cursed at Ethan. “You were always better with the
decisions. Why am I here?”

The cold morning finally arrived
after that sleepless night. I looked out, the wind dying just enough to allow
me to gather my thoughts. The ensuing snowfall was calm. Peaceful.

With a sigh, I dialed Dr.
Puffer’s number.

To say the fear of what was to
come made me want to curl up and hide away would be an understatement, and the
endless paperwork and health checks did not help. With the arguing I heard
behind closed doors, this looked as unknown for them too. But that same
damn hope kept me pushing forward with it as the day came closer.

When I was finally allowed to
come into Ethan’s room, I was taken aback by the gigantic metal beast that now
breathed beside him. Each sputter from it threatened to scrape the ceiling,
and each rattle to have it tumble down to the floor and take us all out with
it. Bulbs and gadgets scattered all around it, someone feverishly typing
away at a computer in its center. They would so often glance to the two
white helmets connected. One already on Ethan, and the other waiting for
me on a makeshift bed at his side.

With a shaking body I laid down,
looking over to my husband one last time as they strapped the helmet on. I
squeezed his hand as tight as I could. 

I hoped my pounding heart would
kill me before that metal beast ever got a chance to. What if that monster
actually did? Or worse, what if it didn’t finish me off? No, no! I
can't do this!

But just as I was about to call
it off, Dr. Puffer grabbed my other hand. He beamed a bright smile at me,
almost to the point of looking devilish. 

“I know you’re scared. But you
will see your husband again. I promise. And just in advance… thank you.”

Before I got the chance to ask
him what he meant, a loud bang filled the room. The beast’s breath turned
to a lion’s roar. An almost unbearable weight forced my eyes to
shut. But even if they reopened, I knew they would not see the hospital
room anymore. I was somewhere else now, spinning and falling to somewhere
very far away.

My time in this endless spinning
space felt like an eternity, until suddenly I was caught in a stream. It
was warm, taking me someplace even warmer.

I floated down, as if from thousands
of feet in the air. Piece by piece the world came into view. Even being blinded
by that orange light I somehow just knew where I was. I could feel the
music, the air, the warmth. It was the ballroom from our wedding.

And those footsteps running
toward me! I would know those from anywhere. I fell into his arms and
hugged him as tightly as I could. He was the first thing I saw
clearly. And he looked just as good as on our wedding day.

“I can’t- can’t believe…” I tried
to stammer out. “Are you… real?”

He laughed. “Was wondering the
same thing ‘bout you. Guess we’ll have to take each other’s word for
it. Should we dance? Looks like the floor’s all ours.”

I could feel my heart’s pain thaw
away with each step and laugh we made. I couldn’t see them, but the
orchestra always knew exactly what to play as we danced for hours. I knew
it was all just… well, wherever “where” was, but it felt as real as
anything. I almost forgot I wasn’t really young with him again until he
suddenly stopped and stared at me with a worried look in his eyes.

“You trust me, right?” he softly
whispered in my ear, as if someone could hear us.

“Of course.”

“Good. You need to leave after
this song.”

I stared in disbelief. “What?! Why?”

“I don’t know. It’s just a
feeling. When the light goes, so does the way out.”

I hadn’t even noticed the orange
sunset had begun to dim away. 

“Well, I really wouldn’t mind
being stuck here with you.” I said coyly.

“No, it won’t be- please, just
listen for a second.”

And eerily enough, I now could
hear it too. A dull breath just over the music, panting and… snarling? My
heart sank at the idea of leaving Ethan, but now even more at the idea of
staying here too.

“W-will you at least see me out?”
I tried to mutter through tears.

“Of course.”

I hoped with everything I had
that the violin’s last note would play forever, but the room fell silent like a
thousand thorns. Even as we ran to those doors with all our might, I
couldn’t take my eyes off him for even a second. I hugged him as we
reached the door. I gave him one last smile and twisted the handle.

But the door was locked.

Ethan and I desperately tried to twist the
handle harder and harder and even try to kick the door down, but it wouldn’t
budge. Panic began to overwhelm us.

“Oh my god, we’re too late!” Ethan cried with
more terror than I’d ever heard from him.

“Too late for what?” I found myself shouting
with the same intensity.  

“Oh my God! Oh my god! Grab- “

In that next moment the ballroom was consumed
in darkness before being painted in a dark red light. A large and hairy
hand grabbed around my neck, and with the strength of a giant it pulled me
back, slamming me into a wall on the other side. The pain of that felt so real.
I thrashed around trying to wake up, but I was trapped in the unrelenting grip,
tightening until I could barely breathe. I cried out to Ethan, then to Dr.
Puffer, then to anyone.

I managed to kick my way loose enough to make a
dash to the exit. The doors were getting closer, but whatever grabbed me was
also close behind too. I begged my body to go faster but it was like
moving through mud. Each clicking and pained breath from that monster just
getting louder and louder. The smell of something rotten and putrid started
to assault me.

With a final lunge I had managed to scrape the
handle with my fingertips, but it was too late. The hand had caught up to me,
this time dragging me up thousands of feet into the air and turning me around
to face it. The stench of its breath was unbearable.

And there, was the most terrifying thing I have
ever seen.

My entire view was surrounded by a singular
gigantic and coarse face, stretching around me. With every blink more
maggots seeped out from its pitch-black eye sockets. Half of its face had
rotted away. Huge, awful worms feasted off that decaying flesh, and what
wasn’t being devoured left to slowly slide off. Every detail of that
monster just burned its way into me.  

With every cry I gave it only tightened its
grip, tilting its head back and forth as if curious of what I was
doing. And finally, after hours, maybe days of its endless staring did it
finally do something. It spat at me this disgusting black goo. It
quickly spread over my body, paralyzing me. It finally dropped me, and I
braced for the hard tile.

But I landed on something soft
instead. The goo burned away to show snowfall. Relentless, brutal
snowfall of a blizzard. It chilled colder than anything on Earth. The
screaming wind threatened to break my eardrums. The only thing to walk
towards in any direction was a faint orange glow. 

That glow belonged to a lantern hanging from a
curved and long-dead tree. And underneath that tree was a skeleton
huddling up to a small fire. The skeleton’s head suddenly jerked to
look up and down at me, even with nothing to actually see me with. And as
if amused by my terrified expression, bellowed in laughter.

“W-where is this?” I shuddered through
chattering teeth. “W-where’s Ethan?”

 

“’Where’s Ethan?’” the skeleton
croaked in a hoarse voice. “Well, where’s anyone? Who’s below us? Who’s in this
tree here? Does the ‘where’ matter anyway?”

“Am…Is this hell?”

The skeleton looked back to the
fire with a small chuckle. “Hell. What a nice thought. It doesn’t really have a
name, but I like to call this land The Last Place. Everything dies twice. First
the body, and then when you all come here, everything else. Every cell, animal,
all kings and peasants of the worlds end the exact way: crushed and pounded
into the snow. You’re not long due for here either. In fact, I can tell you
exactly when- “

“Please!” I begged, not wanting
to hear that next part. “I need to get out of here! There was some creature
chasing after me- “

“Ah, you’ve met Eater! My friend
that helps move things along. Refuses to do its job with me, though. Not sure
why. It probably didn’t know what to do with you, since you still got your
shimmer and all. But… I have a feeling it’s made up its mind by now.”

The ground began to rumble with a
pattern of thunderous footsteps. Even through the impossibly thick fog I could
see that thing towering over us and coming closer.

“Is- is there any way out?!” I
sobbed through tears.

The skeleton wheezed another
laugh. “Plenty! But where’s ‘your’ out? This tree has many roots. I could help
point you in the right direction, if you have anything from your world.”

I could only think of one thing.
To my shock, Dr. Puffer’s card was in my pocket. The skeleton peered over it.

“This is quite hard to read. Even
the letterings confused on what it wants to say. I think you want to go… yes,
North. Go north as far as you can and let them do their job.”

“Who’s ‘they’?”

“Them, of course!”

With one last howl, the skeleton
and the fire vanished into the wind.

Each step felt like hell on its
own, but I could do nothing but trudge on. Patches of my skin turned blue and
peeled away until I could see muscle and even bone. But I still kept going,
going until my legs finally collapsed into the snow. I didn’t even bother
crying for help this time. Somehow, I knew it would be pointless. Anything
would be pointless. The wind would never stop, that thing would never stop
coming closer. All I could do was wait. Anything else would just be prolonging
the inevitable. 

But just moments before it caught
up, something reached from below and tightened around me. As if the ground
turned liquid it dragged me below for miles. But I didn’t feel scared. The
touch felt familiar. Almost like… well, I’ll never know for sure. 

The falling and spinning took
over me again. I was coming home.

I never thought I would be so
happy to hear that heart monitor again. Or how a bed could feel so warm. My
eyes fluttered open and in tearful relief I saw the hospital’s ceiling again.
Whatever that was, was over.

I looked over to see my husband,
but no one was there. I tried to get up, but my body wouldn’t move. No matter
how hard I thrashed I could only move my head.

And then you came into view. And
I cried.

I don’t believe a word you’ve or
they’ve said. Dr. Puffer and that damn machine are real. Something went wrong
and you’re all trying to hide something. You look like Ethan, but you’re not
him. He’s at the hospital or ballroom or wherever the hell-

You’re lying! All of you are
lying! It was real! I didn’t suffer for it not to be! You’re… just… my eyes are
so heavy. I’m falling. I’m so tired.

…

Thank God, you’re asleep again. I
can never get used to it, no matter how many times you yell at me. Maybe next
time you wake up, I can show this to you as proof. Would you believe me then?

I wish you could enjoy this
summer evening. The air’s warm and the crickets are chirping. Always was your
favorite season. And at least you’re getting closer with the names. Ethan’s not
far off from Edan.

I’m still trying to figure out
how you know what Dr. Caffer’s card looks like though. You haven’t seen it
before. Almost makes me wonder… well. It won’t matter soon. There’re no dream
machines here. I can only make one choice for you, and I’ll have to make it
very soon. 

You look so beautiful there,
Sleeping Beauty. Please never wake up.

[Goodnight.] (https://www.reddit.com/r/HectorHoltz/)

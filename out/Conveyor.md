I have a great job at a pork processing plant. I make $65 an hour with full benefits. When I say full, I mean everything than can be covered, is, 100%. The only weird thing about the hiring process was how thick the non-disclosure agreement I had to sign was. Without even the turn of a page I signed excitedly.


The work is extremely easy. All I do is sit in front of a conveyer belt covered in pig parts, watch for and pick out anything that isn't pig meat. The things I pick out are usually teeth, hooves, chunks of hair and sometimes pieces of metal that I assume are pieces of the machinery used to chop up the pigs, one time I found what looked like a huge thumb with a little hoof on the end. The pig must have had a weird mutation.


It's kind of gross, it literally stinks and is far from glamourous. For what they're paying me I would put up with much worse. Lately the objects I've been pulling from the pile have gotten stranger.


It started with things like pieces of cloth with print on them, clearly pieces of clothing. My theory was confirmed the other day when I found a half t-shirt. It wasn't a normal t-shirt, it appeared to be tailored for someone with a very oddly shaped body. It was very wide and the arms stuck out of the front of the shirt instead of the sides. 


One day I found a diamond ring with a gold band. It was a very large diamond and the band was enormous. We aren't supposed to take anything out of the plant but I slipped it in my pocket and made a quick $2000 at my local pawn shop. The perks of this job are endless.


The item that compelled me to travel up the conveyor, was the baby rattle. It was small and white with a cartoon human face on it. A really creepy human face, smiling like a clown with no makeup. I had no idea how it had ended up in the pig parts but it didn't sit well with me, as I'm sure it wouldn't with most. I felt compelled to learn more, not knowing what I'd do with the information once I had it.


I asked to be transferred to the midnight shift. I told them it would just work better with my kid's schedule. I didn't have a kid. if I was going learn more, I figured the lax atmosphere of midnights was when I was going to get my chance. My superiors seemed excited to have a volunteer.


The line didn't run on midnights. I was mostly responsible for cleaning the machines and plant around them. It was miserable, disgusting work and I was always wet but the transfer to midnights also came with an extra $5 an hour so, it I did it with a smile.


I after months of working hard, I gained the trust of the mangers on the floor. Most nights I didn't even talk to them. There was always a manager meeting from 5am to 6 or 630 on Monday morning. Time my supervisor took to nap. I decided this was the perfect time to slip away and investigate. 


I found that if I pushed a mop around and mopped whenever a manager came around, no one even saw me. I started my shift at eleven on Sunday night and planned to get some answers.


I finished all of the work that was expected in about 3 hours. 5am rolls around and start pushing the mop towards the truth. I slowly clean my way toward the origin of the pig parts. I reach the hole in the wall. Next to the hole was a door that required a key card but since the belt wasn't moving, I just climbed through the black plastic flaps to the other side.


I was in a simple, small room with white walls apart from the brick wall directly in front. The hole the belt came from isn't just a hole. Its Rectangular, about 8 feet by 4 feet. The hole's edges seemed to shifting and had a red glow like it was extremely hot, it wasn't. It looked like someone had removed one brick from the wall and stretched out the hole with what seemed to be, for lack of better understanding, magic.


I was terrified but I was in it now, may as well dive all the way in. I took a deep breath like I was about to jump into a pool and climbed through the hole. The other side could have been the mirror image of the keycard guarded room I'd just crawled from. 


The air is thinner here, yet every breath seems to provide something extra that I couldn't put my finger on. It was almost like breathing was easier. Each half lung worth two full breaths. It felt good.


I continue up the conveyer through a tunnel that leaves me in complete darkness. It's too dark, I am starting to panic, I follow light ahead. I reach the end. I emerge into a factory much like mine but it's completely automated. Robot arms with pincers, long saws and blades like swords. 


Everything had an arctic hue. Like colors were missing. The whole world was just different shades of blue. Must be manager meeting time here too. I walk along the conveyor but don't see a single employee. I turn the corner.  What lies just around it comes into sudden, razor-sharp focus. 


The conveyer leads to large metal catwalk that overlooks a giant room, 20-foot-high steel walls with impossibly sharp spikes in a hedgerow on the peaks, surrounded the football field sized cage.


The room was filled with squealing pigs, no, screaming. They were standing upright, pounding on the walls with their hooves, helping each other to try and fail to get over the wall. They are wearing cloths...they are begging for their lives...in English. 


I filter out the roar of the crowd and can pick out some of the moans.


"Please God let us out!"


"I have a family! Please don't do this!"


"I'm too young to die!" Which isn't true, it's a self-defeating expression. If you're alive, you can die. Death doesn't care.


That's when I notice the piglets... It's toddlers and babies in among the pig people. 


I haven't failed to see that the floor was looked like it opened, a jagged line that looked like interconnected metal teeth zig-zagged down the center of the enclosure. It was black but I knew it was blood in the demon's craw.


I try to scream...even my vocal cords are paralyzed. My brains connection to my body... ex...perien...cing terr...ible L.....ag...


One of the pigmen spots me. 


He points and shouts.


"hork, hey! Look at the hork!"


The piggs start to turn and notice me.


"Hork!" 


"Hork! hork! HORK!" 


"Hork pig! Hork pig!"


"Look! it's wearing clothes!"


I see the pigg's oddly shaped t-shirts . Every neuron in my brain was alight simultaneously in sparkler-like fashion. I was short circuiting. it came rushing in to all of my senses like a waterfall.


These were the pigs we were processing...


I still can't walk but I'm slowly regaining the ability. I can move but so slowly, every second feels like an hour. 


"Hork! Hork! HORK! HORK!" every pigg was now chanting in unison. The pace of the chant slowly increasing. I can hear them slamming their bodies, full force into the steel walls, they stomp their feet on the trap door that supports them, perhaps the last door they'll ever pass through. The chanting that was now accompanied by frantic squealing.


I was now running back up the path of the conveyor at full speed. Navigating the same path that had taken minutes, mere minutes ago. Now feels like it a multi-day journey. I reach the tunnel, hesitate for half a second and dive in. I crawl through the tunnel as fast as any human ever has and it hurts. Every part of me is being bruised. I know and feel what I am doing, I do not care. 


After a lifetime in the tunnel, I explode out and take a huge lungful of air, it feels amazing, I'm calmer somehow. I dive almost flawlessly through the hole into the key card room but something cuts me. Blood is dripping down my sleeve. I can't stop, I force myself to ignore it. 


The size of the glowing, stretched out hole in the brick wall is smaller now. I have to suck in my stomach and squeeze through. I feel the top of the hole oscillating up and down rapidly on my back, threatening to crush me. Its like it's communicating that it could kill me instantly if the mood struck.


I poke my head through the black flaps. I'm back in my processing plant. The colors are bright again and I choke on the air. I hack like a lifelong smoker. I melt over the side of the conveyer, tears soaking my face. I make it back to my mop. Guided solely by instinct I whip out the mop, without wringing it out and start mopping in one continuous circle while muttering to myself.


"I'm ok, you're ok, ok, you're ok, ya, ok"


I mop until my thoughts are comprehensive again. It felt like days later but the clock says minutes. I roll my mop back to where I started. My supervisor was just waking up.


"You get everything done?" He asked in his annoying fake tough guy voice.


I am still vibrating with fear, I want to run but to be honest, I haven't decided if this is a deal breaker.


"Yuh-yes sir, um...sir could I cut out a little early? I...uh...shit my pants" I had to get out and you can't really not let someone leave immediately when you hear that.


"Yea...yea, get the hell out of here, have a good weekend" 


I leave, fast, rapidly, at dizzying speeds. I make it to my car, slam the door and scream at the top of my lungs, many times, for about an hour.


I sit in my car breathing the horrid ocean of gases this side calls air and wondered what else lay through the hole in the brick wall.


I didn't know what else to do so I typed it out.


I'm sure I'll lose my job for posting this. 


For the first time since signing it, I wonder what the non-disclosure agreement contains.

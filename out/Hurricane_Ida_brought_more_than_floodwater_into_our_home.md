My husband and I are originally from North Carolina, but in 2016, we moved from Boone to a small city in Louisiana. Our new home was located in a subdivision on the very edge of Lafourche Parish. We had headed south because Paul, my husband, was offered a new position that would pay two-thirds more than his previous job offered.

The transition for us was a bit rocky at first, between heading to a new state neither of us had been to and leaving our other family members behind. But after I found a new school to work at and getting to know our neighbors, we finally felt like we belonged. Seven months after we arrived in Louisiana, we discovered I was seven weeks pregnant with our first child, who I gave birth to in late 2017. It was a boy, who we decided to name Robert in honor of Paul’s great-grandfather.

For the next four years, everything was going smoothly. Even during the early days of the pandemic, we managed to make it by, thanks in large part to both of our jobs (Paul as an engineer and me as a middle school teacher) having a somewhat smooth transition to remote work. It wasn’t until August of 2021 that we were hit with a blow that we couldn’t overcome.

Hurricane Ida touched down in Louisiana and destroyed many subdivisions, including ours. We received photos of our home after the brunt of the hurricane had long passed, and it was heartbreaking to see. The roof had completely collapsed, several of the walls had fallen over and many of our possessions were strewn about or completely gone.

Prior to the hurricane touching down, we had evacuated to Dallas, Texas. Paul’s sister, her husband and two daughters welcomed us into their home with open arms, something I’m forever grateful for. We stayed with them for the next four months. Paul was able to work online, again due to the pandemic. My school had also suffered extensive damage, remaining closed physically until December. Once it reopened, we headed back to our city. We then stayed in a small apartment for the next six months as we waited for our home to be completed.

It wasn’t until four weeks ago we got the news we’d been anxiously waiting for: our home had been restored, as were all the other houses in the neighborhood. We moved back in a week later. Upon stepping back into our home, I actually cried tears of joy. After being displaced for nearly a year, it felt so good to be back home.

But that happiness has long dissipated, and it was replaced with worriedness and horror.

It was the third day since we’d moved back in. Paul had long returned to working in his office, while I stayed home as an online tutor over the summer. During the school year, Robby would attend a daycare, but since I had the summers off, he’d stay home with me.

I was at my desk, tutoring a teenager in algebra, while Robby was in his room down the hall. From the sounds of it, he was playing with his action figures while talking to his imaginary friends. This wasn’t too abnormal for him. Although he had friends at his daycare and in the neighborhood, he still had his collection of imaginary friends that he’d entertain himself with. Paul and I never had a problem with it, so we’d leave him be.

At one point during the tutoring session, my student was silently attempting to answer a couple of problems I had made. While waiting, I decided to listen in on Robby’s “conversation.”

“Leonardo is better,” Robby said. There was then a five second window of silence, which I could tell was Robby waiting for an answer from his imaginary friend.

“Donatello? He’s boring, though,” he then said. I laughed; I guessed he and his friend were having a debate on which ninja turtle was better.

“What about Michelangelo?” Robby then asked. “Do you think he’s cool?”

“I think he’s funny,” a new voice said.

I immediately sat up in my chair upon hearing that. At first, I thought maybe Robby was answering his own question by speaking in a different voice. Testing that theory, I told my student to wait for a minute while I slowly walked down the hallway.

“I do, too,” Robby said. “I like him and Leonardo. But I don’t like Raphael. I think he is a bit mean.”

“Really?” the voice said. “What makes you say that?”

I poked my head inside the door after hearing that, only to find Robby sitting on his floor, his TMNT action figures in front of him.

“What, momma?” Robby asked.

“Who was talking to you?” I asked him.

“Timmy,” Robby said with a smile. “He’s my new friend.”

“That wasn’t you talking in a different voice?” I then asked.

“No, momma,” he said.

“Robby, you know what me and your dad have told you about lying,” I said.

“I’m not lying, momma,” Robby said. “Timmy was the one talking to me. He was asking why I think Raphael is mean.”

I just looked at him, his eyes pleading for me to believe me. As his mother, I can tell pretty well when he is lying to me. I wasn’t seeing it this time.

“Please, believe me,” Robby said.

“I believe you,” I said before looking over across from him. “Is Timmy still here?”

Robby then turned his head to the left, back at where I was looking.

“No, he left,” he said. “I think you scared him.”

I chuckled at that. “Well, tell him I didn’t mean to and that I am sorry.”

With that, I walked back to my desk. However, I couldn’t focus for the rest of the session. I knew that voice couldn’t have been Robby’s. The pitch was far too off for him to imitate it, at least compared to the other times he’d imitate voices of TV characters and whatnot. I made a mental note to tell Paul about it when he got home.

The next day came with no issues. But the following day, things got weirder. I was at my desk reading some emails when I heard Robby talking again. This time, I immediately got up from my computer and stood just outside his slightly-opened door. Robby was asking someone questions, with silence following for about five to ten seconds after each one.

“Where’s New Orleans?”

“Is it fun?”

“There’s a roller coaster?” That’s so cool!”

“I’m not big enough then.”

“I’m only four.”

“I wish I could be a big kid right now.”

“My birthday is in December.”

“I don’t know. Maybe a new scooter or some WWE toys.”

It was after this question that silence filled the room for about thirty seconds. Thinking he was done talking, I began walking back toward my desk. But after taking only a few steps, I heard him speak again.

“Who are you?”

I stopped and turned around. From my new angle, I could see Robby’s mirror sitting in the corner of the room. From the reflection, I could see Robby craning his neck up, looking over to the opposite corner of the room near his TV.

“Why do you look so angry?”

I tiptoed back to his door and continued listening.

“I…I don’t want to make you mad. I’m sorry. Please stop yelling, it’s scaring me.”

I immediately opened his door, opening it so fast that I actually caused Robby to jump. I looked at him and noticed he was beginning to cry.

“Robby, what happened?” I asked as I knelt down next to him, my mama bear instincts instantly kicking in.

“Tommy and I were playing when an angry lady showed up,” he said. “She began to yell at me when Timmy didn’t want to go with her. He said he didn’t know her.”

“Is she still here?” I asked him while wiping a tear off his cheek.

“No, she and Timmy are gone now,” he said while sniffling.

I pulled Robby into a hug, rubbing his little back to calm him down. Knowing my son, I knew what could cheer him up.

“You know what?” I began to say. “I am really hungry. Do you want to go get McDonald’s?”

“Yes!” Robby exclaimed, his eyes lighting up with joy.

“I thought you would,” I said. “Come on.”

Paul got home around 5 p.m., and after he changed out of his work clothes, I told him about what had happened with Robby earlier.

“Good Lord,” Paul said. “Robby’s barely scared of stuff to begin with. Whatever character he imagined must have been terrifying.”

“I don’t know,” I said. “After hearing that voice on Wednesday, I’m starting to think it isn’t imaginary at all.”

“Well, what could the alternative be?” Paul then asked. “A ghost?”

While Paul was a relative agnost, I was born and raised as a Catholic. The possibility of ghosts, demons and spirits have always seemed legitimate to me. Paul, on the other hand, was a complete skeptic, believing anything paranormal could be explained away by science, weather, etc.

“I hope not,” I said.

“Look, Robby’s probably just playing make-believe again,” Paul said. “The little guy’s got a very imaginative brain. We can keep an eye out, but I doubt anything worse will happen to him.”

I just nodded, knowing Paul wasn’t going to take it very seriously (he’s just like that). As I started walking toward the kitchen to start making dinner, Paul called out to me.

“Heck, I don’t even think Robby can decide on a name for his friend yet,” he said.

“What do you mean?” I then asked.

“You said the friend he was talking to on Wednesday was named Timmy,” he responded, sticking his head out into the hallway to face me. “But today, he said his name was Tommy.”

“Oh, that’s right,” I said. Between the craziness of the day, the name change had completely

The next day was a Saturday. Paul went to the grocery store, with Robby tagging along. This meant I had the whole house to myself. I decided to take the opportunity to clean our bedrooms now that the other two were out of the house. Knowing Robby’s room would take the longest to clean, I chose to start there.

Eventually, I made my way over to his little table, where he would play with Legos and draw on construction and loose leaf paper with crayons. After putting his crayons back in the box, I noticed a partially-covered paper with drawings on it. Curious, I picked it up, revealing [this.](https://imgur.com/a/ryFxjEx)

All the blood running through my veins instantly froze. I can’t explain why, but the drawing literally filled me with a feeling of horror that I had never felt before. All it was was a child’s drawing, yet it utterly scared me upon seeing it.

I must have stared at the damn thing for nearly a minute, taking in every miniscule detail. After finally snapping out of my trance, I reached for my phone to call Paul. But just as I was pressing Paul’s contact, I saw one of Robby’s toys sitting on his shelf, that I had just placed there, fly off and nearly hit me in the leg.

I let out a small scream as I jumped back and ran out of the room. I waited in the living room, the TV on full blast as some sort of distraction, until Paul and Robby got home. After putting everything up, I showed Paul the note and explained what happened.

“It didn’t fall?” Paul asked.

“No, it was literally thrown at me,” I said. “Paul, there’s something in this house and it may be starting to scare Robby.”

“Okay, okay,” he responded. “Look, even though I don’t believe in ghosts or that crap, I believe you. If anything, I am more concerned by how creepy these drawings are, especially the angry lady. Let’s talk to Robby first and then we can figure out the next step.”

“Yes, dad?” Robby then asked from behind us.

“What, buddy?” Paul responded.

“You said my name,” Robby said.

“Oh, oh,” Paul said as he grabbed the drawing from me. “Mom and I were just talking about what you drew. It looks like you actually have two friends here. Is that correct?”

“Yes,” he said. “I thought it was just one friend, but Timmy doesn’t have that scratch on his face like Tommy does.”

“Scratch?” I asked.

“He has a scratch on his cheek,” Robby said as he approached us. “It’s right there.”

He pointed to Tommy’s face, and that’s when Paul and I noticed the brown marking next to his eye. Paul chuckled as he noticed.

“That would probably be a birthmark, Robby,” he said. “Not everyone has one, but it seems Tommy does. Now what about the Angry Lady? What are those red marks on her?”

“I think it’s polka dots on her dress,” he said. “But she also has those dots on her arms and legs.”

“When did you draw this?” I then asked.

“This morning,” Robby said. “I was gonna show it to Timmy and Tommy, but I am scared the Angry Lady will see it and get more angry.”

“I doubt she will,” Paul said. “But, in the meantime, let us know if you see her. If she tries to scare you, Mom and I will scare her even worse. Because no one messes with our little man.”

Paul said that last statement as he began tickling Robby’s stomach, causing Robby to laugh. Paul then picked him up and brought him to his room, all the while Robby was still laughing. I remained where I was, wondering how to address this. Yes, it was possible that Robby could be imagining most of this. But between the voice I heard and the toy that nearly hit me, I decided to play safe. I went into my desk drawer and grabbed a small crucifix and a bottle of holy water before walking over to Robby’s room.

“What are you doing, momma?” Robby asked as Paul placed him on his bed.

“I am going to bless your room so that this angry lady doesn’t come back,” I said. “That way, you and Timmy and Tommy can continue to play with one another.”

I put the crucifix atop his door frame and blessed the walls with the holy water. I then said a quick Our Father, asking God for his protection over Robby. Paul followed me out of the room after I made my way out into the hallway.

“I hope this works,” I said.

“I think it will, Lillian,” he said as he wrapped his arm around my shoulder. “We’ll just have to keep an eye out on him.”

Paul then kissed me on the forehead as I hugged him.

The next four days went by without a hitch, the only thing out of the ordinary being Robby talking to Timmy or Tommy, sometimes both. It wasn’t until last Monday that things began to act up again.

It was about 9 p.m., and Robby was already asleep in his room. Paul and I were out in the living room, me on my laptop at the table and Paul on the couch walking baseball. We had been discussing some mundane topic when Paul did a double take toward our laundry room.

“Robby?” he said.

From my spot at the table, I couldn’t see the laundry room. I looked back at Paul, who was staring off into the room. From my angle, I could see the corner of his eyes. I watched as his eyes went from confusion, to shock, to anger. Before I could ask what was wrong, we both heard manic footsteps make their way to the laundry room, a child’s giggling coming with each step.

Paul immediately got up from the couch and made chase, with me following suit. He flicked on the laundry room light as he began looking around the room for something, or rather, someone.

“Where did he go?” Paul said as he looked behind the machines. “I know you’re hiding in here, Robby. You better come out before you get into more trouble.”

“What’s going on?” we heard come from behind me. We both turned to see Robby, rubbing the sleep out of his eyes.

Paul practically did a double take between Robby and the laundry room. I was still very confused about what had just happened.

“That wasn’t you who came in here?” Paul then asked.

“No,” Robby said. “You woke me up.”

The realization hit me as Paul’s eyes grew in concern.

“Okay,” he said. “I’m not angry at you, buddy. But go back to your room and go to sleep.”

“Yes, dad,” he said before turning back around. We watched him turn the corner into the hallway and out of our view. Once we heard the door close, I turned to Paul.

“That couldn’t have been him,” Paul said. “But I know what I saw.”

“What did you see?” I asked him desperately.

Paul took a minute to regain his composure before sighing.

“I saw what I thought was Robby walking toward the laundry room. He then turned to look at me, and we both stared at each other for a few seconds. Then, he gave me the middle finger before running into the laundry room.”

“Oh my god,” I said as I began to feel faint. “This can’t be happening, this can’t be happening.”

Paul wrapped his arms around me to calm myself down. I then went for my holy water and practically splashed it all around the house. I didn’t want to think our house was haunted, but at this point, Paul was now doubting that all of this was imaginary.

I couldn’t sleep that night, anticipating someone’s laughter coming from the dark hallway or a toy being thrown into our room. But thankfully, nothing happened. In fact, nothing happened for a decent bit of time. Early yesterday morning, before it got too hot, I went outside and began doing work in the garden.

“Howdy, Lily,” Louis shouted to me from his mailbox.

Louis was our next door neighbor. He was a Cajun man, maybe about 50 to 60 years old, who was incredibly wealthy. However, he was very frugal with his lifestyle, choosing to live in a two-story home in our lower-to-middle class neighborhood. He was married to a much younger woman, Gabriela, who we knew married him for one reason only.

“Hey, Louis,” I said.

“How’s the kid doing?” he asked, his thick accent emphasizing his words.

“He’s doing well,” I said. “However, I think his imaginary friends aren’t, well, imaginary anymore.”

Louis gave me an inquisitive look before asking, “What makes you say that?”

I gave a brief synopsis on the events of the past week and a half, and to my surprise, Louis chuckled.

“Yeah, we got them spirits all around these parts,” he said. “As long it ain’t one of them Voodoo ghosts, you should be fine.”

I won’t lie, the thought of a bad spirit inhabiting our home made me feel nauseous.

“Sorry, didn’t mean to scare ya,” Louis said, probably noticing the look of fear on my face. “Y’all’ll be fine.”

“I hope so,” I said. “How has Gabriela been? The last time I talked to her was before Ida.”

“She’s…uh…doing okay,” he responded, his smile disappearing. Before I could ask about it any further, he said goodbye and walked back inside his mansion-like house. I figured they may have separated, since they fought all the time prior to the hurricane. But it wasn’t my business, so I quickly forgot about it.

What I didn’t forget, however, was the idea of our home being inhabited by bad spirits. I told Paul about it, but he seemed incredulous on the Voodoo aspect of it.

“Honestly, at this point I think we are fine now,” Paul said. “Nothing’s happened in several days. I guess blessing the house worked for you.”

“I hope so,” I said. “I’m just praying it isn’t a demon or something to that effect.”

“If it was, it would have destroyed the house and harmed us,” Paul responded. “But everything has been relatively minor.”

He did have a point. Although the voice, the flying object and the shadow has been creepy, it hadn’t escalated to a more threatening level. Still, I feared that point would be reached soon.

And I couldn’t have been more correct in that assessment.

About thirty minutes later, I hopped in the shower. Our shower has a frosted glass door, which makes everything on the other side of the door blurry, regardless of what side you’re on. I take ridiculous long showers, like 20 to 30 minutes. It is mainly a therapeutic thing for me, allowing me to detox from stuff going on in life.

About 15 minutes after I started showering, I heard the bathroom door open.

“What’s up, Paul?” I asked.

No response, though I could hear footsteps approaching the shower.

“Paul?” I asked again, this time louder.

Again, no response. I turned the water off, and despite the warm air remaining in the shower, I felt all my hairs stand on end. I turned to my left, toward the glass door. That’s when I saw the outline of a person standing just beyond the pane of glass, their hand pressed against it.

“Paul?” I asked again, but now far more shakily.

Not even a second later, the glass door swung open. I screamed and pressed myself against the back wall, anticipating this spirit, or serial killer, or whatever it was, grabbing me out of the shower. But instead, I heard laughing. I opened my eyes to see Paul.

“You asshole!” I screamed as I pushed him away from me. “Why would you do that?”

“I thought it would be funny,” Paul said. “But I guess I went a little overboard with it.”

“I mean, after all of the shit we dealt with this past week and a half,” I said. “That was so messed up of you to do.”

“I know,” he said, wiping the tears from his eyes. “I’m sorry.”

“Leave me alone,” I said, not finding the situation any bit comical. I closed the shower door. Paul then began to walk out of our bedroom, but as he did, I heard someone shout at him from beyond the door. Paul then screamed in shock, only to be met by a laughing Robby.

“Yeah, show him what it’s like, Robby,” I said as I began to laugh.

Despite how horrible what he did was, I quickly got over Paul’s prank. The rest of the night was routine. We ate dinner and did our own things. Before long, it was time for bed. We tucked in Robby before Paul and I hopped into our bed.

Paul sleeps like a ton of bricks, but I am a very light sleeper. It takes very little noise to wake me up. But at 1:00 a.m., I heard something that jolted both of us awake.

It was Robby screaming at the top of his lungs.

Paul and I fumbled our way out of the bed and down the hall. We bursted into Robby’s room as if it was on fire, with me flicking the light on. Robby was seated up in his bed now crying.

“What happened?!” Paul practically yelled.

“I…I couldn’t move,” Robby said, gasping for breath between his words. “I felt frozen.”

“What did?” Paul said.

“The thing sitting on my bed,” he said. “I had a bad dream, and when I woke up, it was staring at me. I tried to move, but I was stuck to my bed. It then disappeared and I screamed.”

Paul and I wrapped Robby into a hug in an attempt to calm him down. We asked him if he wanted to sleep in our bed, to which he quickly said yes. Robby fell back asleep within ten minutes, but Paul and I kept tossing and turning, both of us rather shaken up by the incident. I mean, I think any parent who had just heard their kid scream in the middle of the night would feel the same way.

Eventually, I fell back asleep. However, I woke up at around 3 a.m. feeling really thirsty. I began to get out of the bed, but as I got to a sitting position, I saw it.

Standing at the foot of our bed was a child-sized shadow, staring directly at us. In my half-asleep stage, I thought it was Robby, but when I noticed Robby fast asleep next to me, I looked back toward the shadow, to which it responded by laughing.

I screamed, waking both Robby and Paul up. The shadow ran out of the room and down the hall. Amid the chaos, Paul saw it and chased after it. I just curled up into a ball and began crying, Robby joining me from the scariness of it all.

Paul didn’t find anyone, but we ended up calling the police to be safe. The police did an entire sweep of our house, including the attic and the crawlspace under the house, but they found nothing. We told them what happened and even some of the stuff that had happened prior. They were skeptical of the paranormal stuff but reassured us that no one, at least alive, was in the house.

We didn’t sleep for the rest of the night. We have Robby and I’s priest coming to cleanse the house tomorrow. I am scared to go to sleep tonight. I think we all are, honestly.

I have no idea where this could have all come from. Our home was not haunted or anything prior to the hurricane. But whatever this is came in with the water, and I will not stop until this thing is unable to hurt my family anymore.

I’ll update in a few days. Stay safe, everyone.

**UPDATE:** Robby came up to Paul and I while we were talking with a piece of paper.

“This is what I saw on my bed last night,” Robby said as he showed us [this.](https://imgur.com/a/aEEkgW8)

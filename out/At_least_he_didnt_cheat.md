My husband of 7 years came home yesterday from a work trip. Lately I’ve been really stressed out from work and our sex life isn’t what it once was. He gives me a bottle of water with what I think is some lemonade power in it. It tastes disgusting.


“What is that?!” I ask.


 “It’s this weight loss drink that ——- is drinking to lose weight. I thought you might like to try it and if you liked it I could get her to order you some.”


 “It’s bitter and tastes awful!” I scrunch my face up. My husband laughs and brushes it off. I don’t have to drink it if I don’t like it, it was just a thought.


“Later that day we drove up to the camp to relax and spend the weekend together. We had a great time! I finally finished reading my book. The weekend ends all too quickly, but after finishing my book, I am definitely looking forward to getting home and being in our own bed tonight. 


We get home and unpack our things. While we are unpacking, I find a long thick curly black hair in his truck. Definitely not mine considering my hair is cut very short, is thin, and blonde. I ask him who it belongs to. 


 “Ah come on baby! Don’t be like that! It must have been from ——-! His girlfriend came to the hotel and spent the night with him. It must have fallen off of him and into the truck when we were driving home.”


Okay. I knew this guy was riding with him and yeah I guess it’s possible that could explain it. I let it go.


We unpack. We clean house. We eat dinner and retire to the bedroom to watch our favorite show.


I’m getting excited because my book definitely put me in the mood and I’m ready to have sex.


 “Hey, check your nightstand! I put a gift in there for you.” Hubs says with a wink.


Excitedly I go to check my nightstand. I find a pack of sex pills. The kind you find at the sex store. Except… something is off. The pack is already opened. This coupled with the hair raises suspicions.


 “Why is it already open?” I ask.


 “Oh I opened it to look at the pills.” He responds. 


My lie detectors are ringing at this point and I’m very suspicious that he did cheat on me. I read the package. It says that there are 6 pills in the pack so if there are 6, he must be telling the truth. I don’t want to jump to conclusions, but that’s a weird reason to open a package of sex pills.


I pour out the contents and begin to count in my head. One. Two. Three. Four... Five. Only five. My stomach lurches as reality sets in and images of my husband fucking someone else begin to wash over me like a cold wave of shock.


 “If you were only looking at them then why are there only 5 pills. This is a 6 pack. Where is the sixth pill?” I ask with some hostility.


 “I must have dropped one.” Lie.


I am beyond words. I can’t compute what to say to him. It is so glaringly obvious that he cheated on me. He can’t look me in the eye. That’s not only a sign of guilt, but his tell when he is lying. I don’t want to fight. Our fourth anniversary is only 3 days from now. I get out of bed and go to sit on the couch.


What is my next move going to be? I am so angry! How could he do this to me?! How could he be so selfish! I sit brooding on the couch. I hear him getting up to come talk to me. I can’t imagine how this conversation is about to go.


 “I don’t want to talk to you. I don’t want to argue.” I say before he even sets foot in the room.


 “I didn’t cheat on you!” He seems adamant but again he can’t look at me. He is hiding something.


 “You are lying to me! You can’t even look at me when you say this! All of these things add up and make perfect sense! What explanation could there possibly be?” I demand.


 “Im not cheating on you! I can’t believe you would think I would cheat on you after how long we have been together! I would never throw away our relationship like that! You know my parents got divorced and that I never want that to happen between us! Please believe me!” He pleads.


I scoff. “I don’t trust you! The hair, the open pack, the missing pill, the blatant lies. You’re going to have to do better than that!” 


 “I don’t know how that hair got into the truck! I swear!”


 “And the missing pill?”


 “I put it in your water yesterday okay?”


I close my mouth. Stunned. I wait for an explanation.


 “I bought the pills on my way home and when I got home, I poured one into your drink and tried to pass it off as something else.”


 “You tried to drug me?!?”


“I wouldn’t call it that. It’s all natural stuff and I did it to get you in the mood. I was hoping you would drink it and you would get horny enough to want to have sex. I thought it would be cute to see you squirm on the way up to the camp.”


“So you tried to daterape drug me?!?”


“It’s not a daterape drug!”


“But the intent is the same! To put me in a state where you would get sex!”


He scoffs. “Quit being dramatic. It’s not the same thing! And I want an apology! How dare you try to accuse me of cheating!”


It’s been 2 hours now. I’m laying beside my husband of almost 4 years. I’m laying next to someone who admits to trying to drug me against my knowledge. Still completely in shock. Wondering… where do we go from here?

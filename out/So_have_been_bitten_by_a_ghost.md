Went to my grandma's grave today, to give her flowers and her favorite candies, it reminds me of the time where i visited her and was graced with her warm comforting and child like personality which inspired me to not kill myself.

Oh yes, if it wasn't for her, I would be gone, so I owe Alot to her.

Back to the grave yard, as I was unpacking some candies, so I could it eat with grandma, a child suddenly appeared to the side of my peripheral vision.

She was sitting 5 feet beside me, dirty greyish skin, messy and long black hair, and a suspiciously clean white fucking dress!

Want some candy?

The child slowly turned her head at me. Black eyes, and with an intense grin.

I'm not stupid or supernaturally illiterate... So I started kicking it with my loud desperate screams. All my efforts literally went through her.

Then it bit me, hard, right in my leg... And I couldn't do anything about it... what can you do when a smoke bites you? So I screamed like a bitch.

It's a monster disguised as a child and I'm a child disguised as an adult. I Tried chucking candies at it, then flowers, then dirt.

I'm like  gazelle stuck in a croc's jaw.

I started praying to the Christian God, Jesus Christ... And it didn't work.

So I started praying to all gods, from all the religions that I'm aware of.  But nothing is answering my desperate calls for help.

Maybe I'm looking at this from the wrong direction, maybe there's a scientific explanation for this phenomena. But what could explain this demonic looking child that I can't get rid off?

Don't get me wrong, I'm in utter agony while it's tearing my flesh apart and burrowing into my bone. But I need to think of some form of solution.

It grinned like it knows what I'm trying to think. And I felt like something is literally pulling away my energy, like my soul.

Religion failed me and here I am, thinking that my soul is being sucked. I need science to help me.

So I diagnosed myself as mentally ill...and just needed to relax... That didn't work.

Nothing can save you. 

I can't believe that it spoke...

So umm, why the fuck are you doing this to me?!!!

It pulled my toenail at light speed in response to my question.

I want you suffer, I want you to suffer, I want you to suffer.

That sounded familiar to me... Then it dawned on me. This is my fucking grandma!!!

You're too fucking slow you stupid fucking cunt! Then she disappears. With it my wound is gone too.

The thing about my grandma is that she's not just a warm and child like person.. she's also a fucking cunt, she loves pranking the shit out of me, love's to joke around and be vulgar, and I honestly loved those parts about of her.

And that part where I immediately knew she was my grandma after she told me "I want you to suffer" is basically what me and my grandma would repeatedly say to scare the shit out of people when we're pranking people over the phone.

So here I am, traumatized and I hope that she would endlessly giggle herself in the afterlife, while burning In hell.

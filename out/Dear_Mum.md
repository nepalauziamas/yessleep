Dear mum, i know it has been a year since i last spoke to you and i'm really sorry about that but i want to talk to you about something else. Last night, i heard Melissa's radio playing reggae music next door, but she left weeks ago, why would it be playing when nobody is around? I also think she either forgot to pack it or just left it there for some reason. 

I know i sound like a crazy woman but it's true! The music went on all night and i couldn't get any sleep. I have to go to work now, i'll update you if anything else happens.

Dear mum, her radio is playing again but only that, i can also faintly smell weed from the vents. You probably Melissa Gibson, right? How i hated that fat-ass hippie! Everyday, she would blast her stupid music while i was working and every-goddamn-time when i knock on her door to tell her to turn down the music, she would always answer without any pants on! Funny thing about this smell situation, she would also smoke weed and my god, the smell of it nauseates me! She even tried to offer me some once to "lower down my stress", but she can shove that stuff up her ass! I'm glad she's gone, i just couldn't stand her anymore!

Dear mum, sorry about the last email, i couldn't control frustrations. The situation is getting worse, i took a bath yesterday and i swear to god, when i opened my eyes, Melissa was in the tub with me. She looked different, she was nude and had stab wounds all over her body, she also had this scowling face staring at me. I jumped out of the tub as soon as i saw her, but when i got out, she was gone. I'm not seeing things, mum! I don't need help, i'm distressed, that's all.

Dear mum, it's three days, three fucking days since i couldn't leave my bedroom? Melissa... she's in my apartment, she's in the mirrors, she's behind me, she's FUCKING EVERYWHERE! My bedroom was the only safe place here, and i'm slowly starving. I keep my door locked at all times, i don't care if i was fired from work due to me being absent all day, i just don't know what to do.

Dear mum, this may be my last email... she found a way to get inside my room...she's staring at me through the windows while i'm typing this. I must confess; Remember when i said that Melissa left weeks ago? That was a lie, i murdered her. I stabbed her eighteen times in the chest with a kitchen knife, she bled to death. I then stripped her nude and dumped her body in the lake just across the apartment. Why did i do it? You probably already know why. The police are on their way now, Melissa is getting closer towards me... to you mum, i'm very sorry i did all this. to you Melissa, i'm also sorry... please don't kill me. 

News Reporter: Sally Baker, the 23-year-old woman who killed 31-year-old Melissa Gibson was found dead in her apartment. She had stripped nude and stabbed multiple times, just like what she did to Melissa. When the police showed up, not only did they find her body, they also found the sentence "I just wanted us to be friends" on the well, written in Sally's blood.

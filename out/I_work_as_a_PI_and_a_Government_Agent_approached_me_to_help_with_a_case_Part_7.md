Nick’s voice startled me. I shot back up feeling as if I was just waking from a dream. The child was still there proving it was real. I didn’t even notice Nick’s posture for a moment, I was still star struck from seeing the beautiful tree in the middle of the room. He looked stiff and had Eel extended in his hand. I was confused as to why he looked so tense.

“What’s going on?” I asked slowly, my head still feeling foggy.

“That child is the cause of this infection. The Hunters created the disease from its blood. They were unable to make a cure so I must finish the job I arrived here to do.” He said in a voice that sounded so cold it hurt my chest.

A sound from my side made me turn. The child somehow melted the glass while Nick was speaking. They made a hole just large enough to climb out of. I really should have been afraid. Instead, when the small creature nearly fell out of the hole, I caught it. The little one with the silver hair felt so light and perfect in my arms. I’ve never really liked kids, but whatever this creature was, it was different.

“What are you implying?” I asked bringing the child closer trying to protect them.

“I’ve told you before. I am an Executioner. I was tasked to wiped out the infection and the cause.” Nick said no longer looking or even sounding like himself.

“Nicolas, it’s just a kid!” I protested.

When he took a step forward, his sword at his side, I stepped back until I bumped against the glass. The child wrapped their arms around my neck appearing frightened of Nick. I just couldn’t believe what he was saying. It was not this child’s fault others turned their blood into something deadly. It just wasn’t right to kill them because there was a chance someone else would twist a part of their blood again to make a weapon.

“Please, just stop for a second. I can’t let you hurt an innocent child. It’s just not right. Just, let’s just figure something out.” I pleaded only to have Nick approach further. 

The sound of his slow steps echoed through the room. A feeling rose into my throat. One I've never felt before. It was something that went beyond fear and into sudden guilt. When he started to raise Eel, my body also moved. My hand acted on its own. I reached for my handgun, the metal feeling ice cold. When Nick fully raised his sword, I also drew my weapon. In reflex, I was pointing it towards him and holding the child tighter with my other arm. The agent froze and I lowered my gun, horrified over what I had just done. I’d just pointed a gun at Nick. I knew I could never bring myself to fire but that didn’t change what I just did. This man swore to protect me and took me despite all my faults and this was how I repaid him. I choked out and apologized, feeling as if I could never say the right words to be forgiven. Nick’s face was a blank slate of ice not even reacting to the incident.

 I jumped when the door on the other side of the room opened. Two men came through, both wearing suits and without any bulbs on their chest. They looked like they were our backup. Nick lowered his sword before they spotted him.

“We’re Team Two. It looks like you have done most of the job already. What else is left for us to help with?” The taller agent with black hair asked.

Just as Nick was going to reply, another sound made us all jump. A vent cover in the ceiling came crashing down along with what had pushed it off. A terrible crack echoed as a body slammed into the white tile floor. If they hadn’t been dead from the infection, the fall would have killed them. The body was broken at impossible angles and a bulb was sticking from its chest. The person had tried to get away and hid in the air vents but was infected anyway. I watched as the body started to decompose.

Nick bolted trying to reach the body before it was too late. Instead of the bulb dying with it’s host, it was draining it before they both died in the next few seconds. The bulb grew to a bright red until it finally opened into a beautiful blood red flower. Red spores burst out and covered the room before any of us could stop it. I held my breath, but I knew I’d already inhaled some spores. My mind was a blank and numb with fear. These spores were the airborne version of the infection. Through the red air I thought I saw Nick look over his shoulder at me, his eyes wide with fear.

We should have all died in that room. It was a small miracle we didn’t. The child I was still holding shook their head and silver dust came floating out, overtaking the red in the air. When my lungs burned and my vision started to fade, I gasped and breathed in the silver air. I waited for the infection to take over.

Then nothing happened.

The two new agents looked as if they both had a heart attack but were fine. Nick’s expression returned to a normal blank one. I still couldn’t believe I was alive. The Hunters that made the infection and died because of it somehow never knew the cure was the child. Either the child never cared enough to save them, or was never in a position to do so.

Eel was collapsed back and Nick went over to the two agents to explain what was going on. As they spoke, I held the small creature that saved us, but found it impossible to look over at Nick after what happened between us. I expected to be sent home now that a cure was discovered but instead, I was told to follow the agents. I was being brought to an office belonging to The Corporation.

I never saw what the outside of the office looked like or where it was located. Two doors were connected so I stepped right out of the Hunters lab and into the office. With some persuasion, the child was taken from my arms. They promised I could see the little one later and nothing was going to happen to them. We both appeared displeased with the separation but accepted it.

I was led down hallway after hallway. Wherever Nick ended up, they never told me. I was led to a door with the name Ancaer set into the polished wood in gold lettering. When my guide left, I knocked on the door unaware of what to expect.

 A gruff voice told me to enter. Inside was a grand office. Bookshelves with countless and well organized volumes lined the wall. A large, dark wood desk sat next to the back of the room. There were even a set of small couches and a coffee table in the middle of the room. It looked like a rich man’s lounge room right down to the plush carpet. A man stood behind the desk and I immediately disliked him.

He was tall (at least seven feet), and made of muscle. His suit looked ridiculous on his frame but he was the type of person no one would say that to his face. Long reddish hair circled his neck like a mane. It was clear from his clawed hands and sharp teeth this man was not human. I took my time walking across the room and to the chair in front of his desk.

 He scowled at me, displeased, and the feeling was mutual.

“So, you’re the one who Nicolas has been running around with. What a small thing you are. Human as well. How useless.” His voice was so deep it was almost hard to hear what he was saying.

 “I’m sorry, but who are you again?” I asked not liking his tone.

 “Nicolas’ boss and the highest ranking agent in this sector. You should watch your attitude. I was the one who approved the cases you participated in. If you wish to continue, we need to make this more official.”

I kept my opinions to myself as he tossed a stack of papers in front of me. A pen followed them and rolled off his desk making it so I needed to pick it up. I still stayed silent as I started to read the first few sentences.

 “You are not becoming and agent.” Ancaer explained. “This is just giving you permission to partner with Nicolas with very minor cases. If you die on one of these, your family shall get a lump sum. Very low considering you’re not even a contract worker. As far as I can tell, you're just a cheerleader. On the sidelines looking pretty but not actually doing a damn thing.”

Rage started to bubble in my stomach. I kept it down as I flipped through the papers. They pretty much said what he had just explained. Most of the text was explaining the many ways an agent could die and how they were all covered for the life insurance deal. Agents didn’t even need to pay into it. Due to the fact so few even had families or anyone after they died, The Corporation could easily cover a massive payout on the rare occasion it happened without having to collect for it. The forms were simple and I filled them out, signing where needed. I tossed the papers back on his desk, the pen rolling forward but not quite off the desk. I was still impressed by it trying to roll towards freedom. Ancaer didn’t even touch the papers. He looked disgusted over the fact I was even in his office.

“If there isn’t anything else, I would like to get back home. Me and my partner had a long night.” I said getting ready to stand up from the very stiff chair I was in.

The man looked down, his face twisted and large sharp teeth exposed.

 “I can tell why Nicolas picked you. He was always making the mistake of taking in fragile feminine strays.” He spat out, keeping his voice low but filled with hate.

 I’ve never been so angry in my life. I saw red and shot to my feet before I even knew what I was doing. This man could crush me with his pinkie and yet I still acted. Neither of us did something we regretted because a voice from the doorway made us stop.

 “Mr. West? Could you come with me please?” A pleasant voice asked.

I looked over to see a tall dark-skinned woman smiling in my direction. She was wearing a lab coat and her name tag was too far away for me to read.

“Aberash, how many times have I told you to knock before you enter my office?” Ancaer said at the newcomer, his voice practically a growl. He may dislike me, but he hated her.

 “And how many times have I told you I’m more important than you? You may be able to knock over brick buildings but you can’t think yourself out of a paper bag. This company needs brains, not brawn. So Ancaer, ever so kindly, and I mean this from the bottom of my heart, shut the fuck up.”

My mouth dropped open. I looked from one to the other. Aberash was smiling and Ancaer grinding his teeth. I was waved over come by Aberash, so I quickly crossed the room to leave with her. She still smiled as she slammed the door behind us. The moment it was closed, we could hear the large man starting to tear apart his furniture in a rage. At least it wasn’t one of us.

“God, he’s such a raging dick.” Aberash said with her hands on her hips.

She looked down at me with a wink. Golden bulky necklaces clanked when she moved and they stood out against her nearly pitch-black skin. Her hair was shaved very close to her skull and golden bulky earrings dangled under her ears, looking perfect against her skin tone. I would never admit this out loud in fear of embarrassment, but she was the most beautiful woman I’d ever seen, and I fell in love with her the moment she spoke.

"Yeah, he seems like he has issues. Anyway, did you need me for something?” I asked as she started to guide me down the hallway and away from the noisy office.

“Nah, not really. I figured you wouldn’t want to be stuck with that man for too long. But since I have you, do you want to hang out with the kid you guys brought back for a little while?”

We quickened our pace. I was glad I could see the child again so soon. Inside the office was a day care, or a place where agents could drop off their children if they had any. There were two children there, the one we found in the lab was now dressed in real clothing and playing with some toys. The moment they saw me, I was tackled by the two kids. I gladly sat down with them as Aberash explained what they had decided on.

They would find a family to adopt the child and would refuse to let the Hunters have access to it. The poor little thing didn’t even have a name. The Corporation wasn’t certain of what species they child was. Aberash was the one who gave it a quick check up and found, as far as she could tell, that the mystery child didn’t have a gender. I was given the option of naming the child squirming happily in my arms.

 “Do you think Luna is too girly of a name?” I asked as I brushed my fingers through the silver threads of hair.

 I was given a smile showing how much Aberash liked the name. It was decided that I could see Luna whenever I wanted and I was given a number to reach my new crush if needed. I wanted to stay a little longer but I was kindly kicked out. The kids needed to sleep and I also had a long day to think about and needed to decompress.

The next few days after that case were torture. Nick hadn't replied to any of my texts. We didn’t get a chance to talk after everything that happened. I feared he hated me. I didn’t care about losing a well-paying job. I didn’t even notice the payment for the last case for a while. I found it impossible to sleep or eat much as I tried to get in contact with my partner.

Finally, Nick sent me a message asking to meet in the park briefly before he went on a case, as the job was too dangerous to take me along. Him wanting to talk was a good sign. The stress nearly kept me in the house. I sucked it up and was ready to face whatever he rightfully felt.

I spotted him and waved. When he turned around and waved back, I gasped at the sight of his face. Half of it was bruised and swollen. His hand was wrapped in bandages. I didn’t understand how he was so injured and still wore a neutral expression.

 “Snickers, what on Earth happened?” I asked, another forbidden nickname slipping out.

 At first, Nick wasn’t aware I was speaking to him. He looked around to see who Snickers was before he realized.

 “I was slightly injured during a training program.” He explained as if it wasn’t a big deal.

 “Can’t you like, heal yourself really fast? Did this just happen?”

“Express healing takes up triple the energy. It's not worth it. This shall heal in a few days." Nick replied, waving off my concern.

Aside from his bruises he looked normal. Or well, as normal as Nick could be. I stood, feeling guilty because of how I acted in our last case. I wasn’t sure how to bring it up so I went right for it.

 “I wanted to apologize to you. What I did... It was pretty unforgivable.” I said as my voice started to choke up.

 I waited for a response, each second my chest getting tighter and more painful.

 “What are you talking about?” Nick asked in an even voice.

 I stared at his face trying to read his expression. He truly appeared to not know what I was feeling so guilty over. He either didn’t notice I’d raised my gun at him while protecting Luna, or he didn’t care.

“Nick, I pointed a gun at you! We are supposed to be a team and yet I...” I trailed off unable to even look at him.

 “It’s fine. If I killed the child when we first saw them, we may both be dead by now. That child held the cure and-”

 “That’s not the point!” I snapped.

People in the park looked in our direction and I felt my face flush. When I calmed down a little Nick spoke again.

“I need a partner like you. Sometimes I need to be told I’m doing the wrong thing and it’s hard to stand up to someone you care about. I respect that you stood your ground and did something that got my attention to stop me.”

I just couldn’t believe this guy. He really wasn’t human because there wasn’t another person of the same species as me that was so damn nice. I fought down any further disagreement, knowing Nick would just dismiss it.

 “You need to stop being so damn understanding.” I told him.

A hint of a smile flickered on my face. He let my words run through his head a few times before he responded.

“I never thought anyone would ever call me understanding. When it comes to interacting with people. I don't know what’s going on most of the time.”

 I laughed. I couldn’t help it. I don’t know why I was ever worried or thought Nick could hate me. He couldn’t hate anyone. He just didn’t have any sort of negative emotions in him. Rustling around in his pocket he pulled out his pink flip phone with all the charms. I thought he was going to make a call, but instead he started to remove one of the charms from the collection. It was a plastic ruby that glittered in the sunlight. A trinket, but still pretty.

“Here, I wanted to give you this. It was my old partner’s favorite.”

He only spoke after I had taken it. If I had known who it had belonged to, I wouldn’t have taken such an important thing. Such a small object felt heavy in my hands.

“I can’t-” I started.

What made me stop and accept the gift was that Nick smiled. It was the smallest smile I’ve ever seen, but still a smile. I clutched the fake ruby in my hand, understanding how important it was.

“She would have gotten along with you. It’s the reason why I called you for the second case. You may not be able to see it now, but I do need you. So please, keep working with me.”

There was no way I could ever refuse him when he asked so sincerely. No matter what, Nick would see some positive qualities in myself that I couldn’t. To pay him back for still wanting me as his partner, I swore I would work harder. He expected me to just show up but now I needed to put forth a hundred percent into every case he brought me on. I may still have some self-doubts, but I couldn’t let them hold me back. His phone started to ring and he turned away to answer it. By the sound of things, he was late for a dangerous job.

“When you get back, please dig around and find us a case to finish. I want to keep working hard on solving these smaller jobs with you.” 

I thought I saw Nick smile again, but it might have been a trick of the light. He promised another case in the future, but couldn’t give me a time frame. No matter when he called again, and no matter what kind of job, I would be waiting for him. Until then, I needed to sign up for some self defense courses… Or at the very least start jogging to get into shape.

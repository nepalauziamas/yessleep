Me and my sister Cassidy stood in front of our mother’s casket. Even though she was a bit weird sometimes, she was a nice person. 

However Cassidy didn’t even care about our mom’s death nor was looking forward to her funeral. She was always like this so I wasn’t surprised.

When we went to hear our mother’s will being read, we were both told that she had left behind two pairs of diamond earrings. 

I nor Cassidy didn’t know what the earrings were for specifically, but we decided to appreciate the gift our mother left for us, and we both parted our ways.

But a few things started happening that changed my life. One time I missed the local MTA bus, so I had to wait for another bus to come. The next morning I had soon discovered that the bus I had missed before was in an accident.

Apparently the driver had suffered from a sudden heart attack. There were only about 10 injured and 4 dead. I felt horrible about those who were involved, but also pretty lucky.

And that was just the first incident that happened. There were multiple times where I would escape a catastrophe only to find out about it after it happened. I looked at the diamond earrings, I thought of them as good luck charms my mother left for me and Cassidy.

Until one month later, I had received a text from Cassidy, telling me to meet me at a apartment. I don’t as a little hesitant, but I decided to go. I got to the apartment and texted Cassidy.

**M: Hey, I’m at the entrance, what floor are you on?**

**C: 4th floor. Room 413**

I walked in, went into the elevator and walked through the 4th floor until I found Cassidy’s room. I knocked on the door, and she opened it. When I opened it, I got as shocked.

Cassidy looked extremely skinny, it looked like she had starved herself. Her bones were thin, her hair was a mess, and she looked extremely weak and fragile.

I went in, and Cassidy closed the door and locked it. I felt so uncomfortable during that moment. There were so many red flags that were showing during that very moment. But I tried to ignore them.

Until I saw the knife in her hand. “Cassidy… what are you…” my voice paused for a moment “What are you planning…”

Cassidy then started to speak in a hoarse voice. “Mom cursed me. She used these stupid earrings to curse me and now I can’t get them off of me…”

I looked at her eyes. They were bloodshot, and were full of rage. I took a step back. “SHE DID THIS. OUR MOTHER DID THIS TO ME” Cassidy screamed at the top of her lungs, her grip on the knife tightened.

That’s when she lunged at me, tackling me onto the ground as I screamed. We wrestled on the floor as Cassidy desperately tried to plunge the knife into any part of my body, probably hoping to get to my heart.

She raised the knife up, and quickly sliced my arm as I held it up in the air to sorta shield myself. That’s when I noticed. The earrings, Cassidy’s earrings. They were glowing. They turned red and as Cassidy smiled with glee about to take me out, she starting groaning.

She fell backwards onto the floor and started gagging as her body started to twist and turn. Her body started to become thinner and her bones started to become smaller.

I stared in disbelief as the sister I once known had the energy sucked out of her, and absorbed whole. I stood there as my arm bleed. I quickly rushed to bandage it and managed to do just that.

I got out of there shortly after. I looked at the diamond earrings my mom gave to me and my former sister. I remember her saying a phrase when I was young.

I think it went like “The gods of karma will always punish mortals in their own way.” Guess she was right after all. Rest In Peace, mom.

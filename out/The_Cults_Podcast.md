Never ever will I ever listen to the Sullivanians Podcast, and you shouldn’t as well.

Back during lockdown I was into horror and the occult. It was lockdown so I had lots of free time. I also browsed the dark web. It wasn’t as bad as you would think. It was mostly just weird stuff, with a little illegal activity, and information on the occult. 

I opened the tour browser on my laptop, and set my van to be in Norfolk, UK, as it was my most favorite place to set the VPN as of its haunted history. 

I opened the dark web, and then I got to scrolling. It was about 3 am when I almost got off until I came across a podcast…that started downloading by itself. 

It was called the Sullivanians Podcast. I was thinking it was some sort of virus so I didn’t open it, but it opened by itself.

Then it played.

It was the most horrible noises I’ve ever heard, then it started talking to me. 
“Alex Sulllivian.” It said in a creepy voice.
“We found you.” Then it closed. 
“That’s it” I thought. Then I heard a notification on my phone. It was an intruder alert, at the back door. I unlocked the safe in my bedroom and grabbed my 9mm Hand gun, and loaded it up, I put an extra magazine On my belt, just in case. 

I went to check the cameras and what I saw scared me. I saw people in dark robes, with blood red splotches, that looked fresh.

Then there head snapped and jolted to look at the camera, then I saw the mask, almost covered by the pointy hoods, the mask were terrifying, worse than anything I had ever seen on the dark web. It looked like the mask that a cult would wear. 

Then I put 2 and 2 together. The cultish clothes and the name Sullivanians, it was a podcast that told the cult where you were, through the dark web, I looked at the window and saw a figure in the window, just a shadow covered by blinds. I knew what it was. Then I looked back at the live camera footage. They were gone, with the door open.

I heard knocking on the bedroom door that got louder and louder same with tapping on the window. I wasn’t going down without a fight, so I’m typing this as the knocking started, now the door is breaking I cock back my gun getting ready to fire, then the window and door broke. 

They rushed in and I fired hitting 6 I went to reload, but I felt a needle hit my neck. I dropped, then everything went black.

I woke back up with my handgun gone, and my phone gone. Then I got my bearings and saw a pentagram on the floor, and bars around me. Then candles lit at the pints the star made in the pentagram. I tried to move but I was spread eagle and tied up with chains.

My chest was exposed and bleeding a little. Then I heard walking to the cell. I saw them. The dark robes with blood splotches, and the mask with pointy hats.

The person in the front unlocked the cell and everyone pored in. Then they started chanting.

“Oh Sathanas, please respect the offering of human flesh.” The chanting continued and got louder and louder. Then the leader took a kitchen knife out of his robe and said finally.

“Accept the offering of human flesh and his soul so we can prevail!” The he took the knife up, and brought it down on my chest. 

I screamed and then I realized to late I was  on deaths door.

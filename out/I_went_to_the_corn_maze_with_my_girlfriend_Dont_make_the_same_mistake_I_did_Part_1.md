It's that time of the year that the annual corn maze in my town is being set up. I used to go there every year with my family as a child, and I still continue that tradition today as a 20 year old college student. We were planning to go on the 22nd, but there had been a flu spreading around my younger sister's high school and she had brought it home to the rest of my family. The only reason I hadn't gotten it too was because I lived miles away in a college dorm. They would've rescheduled, but the corn maze only stayed open through Halloween and they didn't think they'd get better in time. But they still wanted me to go, which is why they suggested I ask my girlfriend, Tina, to come with me. I asked her on the 20th, and she immediately said yes. I knew she would, considering the fact that Halloween is her favorite holiday and she loves everything related to it.

I left my last class on Friday at around 3:30 p.m. and texted Tina to make sure she was still up for going on Saturday. She texted back quickly and confirmed. We made plans to leave our dorms around 8:30 p.m. so we could get there by 9:00. The place was open till midnight, so we'd have plenty of time to go through the maze and hang out there.

We ended up arriving at the corn maze at around 9:05, and Tina insisted we go through the maze right away. I didn't really have any plans on exactly what we were gonna do, so I followed her. Before we went in, a large man in a brown uniform stopped us. He looked me dead in the eyes for a moment before speaking.

"You have 15 minutes to make it out. Or else."

I had no idea what he meant, but I figured he was just in character and trying to scare us. I gave the strange guy a quick nod and walked past him. After several minutes of walking, I began joking with Tina about how I wanted to grab one of the ears of corn and just eat it right there while we were still going. I hadn't eaten anything before we left, and I was starving. I had nothing but a plastic water bottle stuffed in my pocket. We walked for another five minutes or so before we saw some strange movements through the corn. I peeked through and saw a thin black cloud of smoke lingering in the air. It disappeared within seconds, but it was still creepy. I checked the time on my phone. 9:25. We had entered the maze at 9:10, which meant our 15 minutes was up. But I wasn't afraid. I figured the worst that would happen would be a costumed person chasing us with a fake chainsaw. But what would soon come to be was far, far worse.

The first strange event occurred only a minute or so after our 15 minutes expired. We saw the corn in front of us rustling a bit, before a massive spider jumped out in front of us. Probably a tarantula. It crawled towards me at full force, getting about a foot up my leg before I kicked it off. I tried running backwards away from it, but the damn thing wouldn't give up. I kicked it some more before finally getting it on its back. I was able to aggressively stomp it into the dirt several times before it stopped squirming. I poked it a few more times with my shoe to be sure, and it was dead.

The occurrences only got stranger from there. Tina and I heard loud thunder rolling directly above us. When we looked up, all we saw was a black void where the sky used to be. No clouds, no stars, no airplanes. Even the moon was nowhere to be found. It took me a moment to take notice, but the darkness had begun to creep downward from the void. I was soon unable to see the trees in the distance. Eventually, I could only see several yards ahead of me. And mere moments later, it had entirely fallen. I was completely blind. I took out my phone, and the light barely did anything. I turned on my phone's flashlight, but it hardly illuminated a few inches in front of me. I carefully crept through the maze, holding Tina's hand the entire way so I wouldn't lose her in the darkness. After what felt like an eternity, I couldn't have moved more than twenty yards. I began moving slightly faster when I felt a strange feeling. It was similar to goosebumps, but it wasn't. It felt like there were dull claws gently scratching me all over. This strange feeling was accompanied by a third pair of footsteps, behind Tina. I began walking even faster, starting to jog a bit. The footsteps sped up with us. I then escalated to a full sprint. The feeling got worse, and I was sweating bullets at this point. It felt like bugs were crawling all over my face, but I never stopped. That was, until Tina was pulled out of my grasp from behind. I instantly turned around, running even faster than before in the direction of my girlfriend. I tripped on a small rock and flew into the ground at full speed, banging my head and falling unconscious.

I woke up an unknown amount of time later. The darkness was gone, and so was Tina. I walked in the direction that she had been dragged in, praying that she was still there. After making several turns, I saw her. Lying on the ground, mangled. All of her limbs were broken, and she had hundreds of scratches and lacerations all over her body. I kneeled down in front of her body, feeling her wrist for a pulse. All I felt was cold, clammy skin. I looked down at my hands and knees, still bloody and raw from the fall. I wasn't going to give up. I had done so much to survive this godforsaken warped reality, and I needed to make it out alive. For Tina.

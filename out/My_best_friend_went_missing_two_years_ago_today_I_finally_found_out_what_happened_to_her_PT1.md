I pressed the heels of my hands into my eyes, pushing until red spots exploded across my vision. This migraine was killing me.

A beam of warm sunlight tumbled lazily through my half-open curtains. I looked up and watched, mesmerized, as the fabric expanded like a pair of giant lungs, heaving every few seconds when the late-summer breeze halfheartedly picked up, before falling back into it's own pattern.

The soft ambiance was shattered like hot glass dropped in snow as my phone rang.

I groaned, feeling like my head was suddenly full of bricks, and propped myself up on an elbow. I reached over, grabbing the damn thing as it vibrated a third time, and I think I stopped breathing.

It...couldn't be. I was dreaming. I read, and re-read, the contact name. It took a few seconds of blank staring before  I realized I should answer.

My hand shook as I swiped the *accept* icon. 

"Hello?" I praised the steadiness of my own voice, even as I could feel all the colour drain from my cheeks. 

"O-Jay?" 

The acid in my stomach curdled like spoiled milk. What kind of sick, cruel trick was this? 

I swallowed down the questions-and some choice words-fighting to escape my throat. 

"Yeah, that's me." I said, barley processing the words as they came from my mouth.

"Oh, thank God. Ok, I really need to talk to you. I know, you probably have a billion questions, and I promise I'll explain *everything* soon. But right now, I...need your help."

I'd *love* to say I refused.

I stood outside the house, staring down at my phone. This was the address. I looked over my shoulder at the sinking sun, it'd be dark by the time I left. I hated driving at night.

The house was nice, if modest; a cozy little flat with slanted roofs and a sky blue paint job. Definitely the kind of place she'd have bought.

I walked up the concrete steps and, after a moment of hesitation, kocked at the mahogany door. The sound of someone walking forward reached my ears just before the door opened with a sound of locks clicking, and a woman stood in the frame.

She'd changed. Not a lot, but enough to give me a moment of mind bending vertigo. Her golden-blonde hair had darkened-whether with time or dye, I wasn't sure-nearly to black, the eyes staring back at me were no longer indecisively gray, but ice blue. She was taller too; nearly reaching my height while I used to tower over her, 
and the glasses were gone. That was all I had time to notice before she jumped up, throwing her arms around my neck.

It was brief, and she quickly backed away. I could have sworn she cast a wary glance around before standing aside and beckoning me in.

I shouldn't have followed her inside, I should have seen the warnings, but I didn't.

The inside was even more her style, open concept with only the bare essentials. I'd barley sat down on one of the wooden barstools when she started speaking.

"Last week was my eighteenth." She stated, like that explained everything.

"Ok?"

"Which means I'm now-legally, at least-an adult, and my...parents," the way she said made it sound like an insult "are no longer my guardians. That's going to be important."

There was something off about the way she spoke.

"I don't have much time, Jay. And neither do you."

"What the Hell do you mean?"

Her eyes went wide. "What do you think?"

"I *think* that you went missing, and were declared dead, two years ago, then reached out to me out of the fucking blue." I felt something boiling in my gut. She just stared at me, mouth half open.

"Jay," she said slowly "I didn't go missing."

"I'm pretty fucking sure you did." 

"No, I didn't." She laughed harshly. "I *died.*"

 

The leaves crunched underneath his feet, the fall air was crisp, his nose turning redder as he walked down the stone path. His collar was flipped up, the wool pulled tight against his neck. His Oxfords clicked as he strolled underneath the Oak trees, and he shoved his hands deeper into his pockets, feeling the ends of his fingers growing numb.  
 

To Marwen there was a certain beauty to the leaves having already turned, the greens starting to fall off the branches, the browns littering the ground. In times past, he loved the heat of the summer, the sun bearing down on his skin, but things changed after the seizure.  
 

No one really knew what brought it on. His sister had witnessed the harrowing sight, as she rushed to his aid, dropping to her knees beside him. Fortunately, she had learned first aid in the Army, so she instinctively knew to turn him on his side. His every muscle ached, his eyes felt like they were burning behind his skull. His emotions were not reigned in; he was tearing up for no apparent reason. His mind reeled... he couldn’t get his thoughts to connect. It was as if all his awareness and memories were right in front of him, but the neurons just couldn’t link up.  
 

His sister peered deep into his eyes after the seizure. Four minutes and nineteen seconds after the first moment.. the moment the first muscle spasmed, there was a noticeable shift. She chalked it up to him coming back to reality. The glaze over his eyes went away, his slurred speech began to form into coherent sentences, and he finally smiled. Oh how she longed to see that smile.  
 

He did great for quite a long time after the seizure. He seemed to be happier, and more welcoming to strangers. Some of his insecurities went away, as did most of his fear. His sister didn’t mind this at all, because life was great for the two of them. They were getting along better, and he was holding down a steady job... so no one noticed the first subtle change.  
 

She first saw it when the changes became more apparent. It all started when the leaves switched from green to ambers, reds, and yellows. The more they fell from branch to ground, the more her brother’s personality shifted. He would sit for an hour at a time, just staring out the window, beholding the ordinary wonders of the great outdoors, but only when it was cold and dead.  
 

The strangeness was the way he didn’t want to watch the songbirds, as the springtime sunbeams streamed through the foliage, gifting its life-giving warmth to the flowers below. He was far more interested in watching the ravens picking up pieces from the snowy ground. Everyone would move around outside, each of them with their own tasks- much like those ravens.  
 

In times past, he would walk outside, wearing shorts and a tee shirt, and walk in the beauty of God’s splendor and glory, but now his interests had shifted to gray skies, and bare trees. A smile adorned his face. At second glance, it appeared to be more of an unnatural smile. People still didn’t seem to notice much.  
 

Marwen was enjoying the day, walking down the boardwalk, far above rocky outcrops by the sea. Even though his island was often covered in fog, and many called it gloomy, he loved to watch the waves slam against the rocks.  
 

The water was near freezing, but it still looked absolutely glorious to him. Sometimes he would think what it would be like to throw himself over the railing, into the icy blackness below. He could imagine the water seizing up ever muscle in his body, and the feeling of losing all feeling. He closed his eyes.  
 

He looked around, his mind filled with memories- memories of places that he wasn’t even certain that he had ever been. The only time that he had a strong sense of that, was directly after the seizure. He opened his eyes to a worrying sight: himself lying on the ground. His muscles ached. He had blood on his clothes, likely due to some kind of the injury when he fell. His mouth felt like saw dust, he couldn’t even swallow... not even able to muster the slightest bit of moisture. Straining for something, he once more attempted some form of a gulp, but all that accomplished was endowing him with a tickle at the back of his throat.  
 

He erupted into a coughing fit, razors slicing down his throat, as every movement scratched its claws into his esophagus. He yearned for water; he needed something to wet his parched mouth, something to moisten his dry lips.  
 

His sister knelt beside him, her eyes were wet with tears. He tried his best to ask what had happened, but in his pitiful state, all he could muster was a grunt. His sister smiled with compassion, a look that he wasn’t accustomed to seeing, especially when adorning a tired soldier’s face. She touched a cold glass of water to his lips, and he let it wash over his face. He didn’t care if it ran down his shirt, he just needed something.. anything.  
 

His heavy breathing slowed, and color came to his pallid face. His sister smiled and brushed the hair out of his face. Being older than him, she treated him almost more like a mother, but he didn’t mind. Matter of fact, the love that she showed, was so genuine, so pure that he felt safe with her. He knew that with her, no harm would befall him. Together they were strong, and he needed her strength, now more than ever.  
 

After some time, he was sat down in a nice office. The overstuffed leather chair squeaked as he shifted his gaze towards a beautiful bay window that had looked to to be recently installed. He could smell the fresh lumber and glue. The walls were beautiful mahogany, as was the heavy desk he sat in front of, unsure of where it’s occupant was. The soft lights relaxed his addled mind, and the electric storm’s symptoms seemed to be dissipating.  
 

He looked outside. He looked back to the office. He looked out the window again. He couldn’t formulate a reasonable explanation. The sun was out, and the leaves had somehow transported themselves back to their initial home on the thriving branches. He watched Cardinals, Blue Jays, and Sparrows flitting across his field of vision. A hummingbird floated in front of the window, its wings beat faster than any man’s eye could detect.  
 

He sighed, then breathed in deep, feeling his lungs fill with oxygen. He firmly closed his eyes, took another deep breath, then tried to fire his already exhausted synapses. Like a rusty old locomotive, the wheels slowly started to turn.  
 

Suddenly, as a bolt of lightning, Marwen remembered. He had spent a few months in the hospital, and he had just left speaking with psychiatrist, hence the beautiful office. The staff told him that it was normal procedure for someone with any type of potential brain injury.  
 

He was back in his room, the smell of antiseptic all over, he pulled his thick green hospital blanket up to his neck . His sister walked in, the same understanding look on her face, and he noticed the way her eyebrows arched when she was doing her best to watch after someone other than herself.  
 

A tall doctor with a white coat, dark hair, and piercing blue eyes, followed her into the room. He seemed to share the same concern that Marwen’s sister had.  
 

He sat beside Marwen’s bed. His long fingers clutched a brochure. Marwen realized that it was a pamphlet for a long term care facility. It was clear that he had come to that realization, because as soon as he had gotten a good look at the paper, he jumped out of the bed.  
 

His IV ripped out, pulling some skin off with it, and sending a trail of fresh blood rolling down his arm. For the first time in his life, he had scared his sister. He looked at her, and smiled. She was cowering back in her chair, the sudden ordeal had caused her to freeze up. He knelt down, and felt his knees hit the cold hospital floor, as he was simply wearing his hospital gown.  
 

The doctor was obviously taken aback. He started to scan the room, as if he was assessing the situation.  
 

Marwen couldn’t figure out why his outburst had terrified them so. He obviously had expected them to be startled, but as he held his sister’s hand, and tried to comfort her with a look, she still looked like she was frozen into place.  
 

She pulled out a picture... a picture of her visiting her brother during the winter time- the very time that he couldn’t remember. She showed photo after photo, and in each one, he was catatonic. Memory after memory, and he hadn’t even been in the land of the living long enough to remember it.  
 

He told himself that this must be a trick, he figured that he couldn’t have lost that kind of time. It must have been a mistake. His sister kept mumbling something about how he wasn’t ready, and the doctor was still in shock. Marwen noticed that his hand was getting closer to the call button, so Marwen jumped up, to pull the doctor’s hand away.  
 

The world slowed down, and it started move as if watching reality through a very slow moving fan- the world seem to be strobing, albeit very slow. He wasn’t in control. This was simply a movie.. a fever dream. He saw the doctor reach, then the next view was Marwen jumping up, then some type of struggle. This part surprised Marwen, because he had never been in a fight in his entire life, but his mind was suddenly turned to fight-or-flight mode, and it appeared that he was doing a little of both.  
 

The next time his mind strobed, he looked down at bloody hands. The next time, he looked back at the doorway, with the tall doctor lying in a pool of his own blood, his lifeless eyes seemed to stare through Marwen.  
 

He didn’t know what he had done, or why he had done it, but at this point it was done. He wanted to stay, and explain. After all, could that mayhem really have been caused by his hands? Marwen put that out of his mind as he ran.  
 

The next thing he knew, he was back in the hospital... or was this a different one? He looked up from the bed that he was lying on, and saw his sister. He didn’t see that same look of concern, but now it had changed into an expression that Marwen had never seen before. He called out, and tried to sit up. His sister didn’t move, and his hands felt tight. He looked down and witnessed something he hoped was just a bad nightmare: his wrists were tied to the bed.  
 

He squinted his eyes and looked at his sister again. Why was she dressed in formal clothes?There seemed to be other shapes moving around her, but he wasn’t able to make out who they were. Why was there glass separating them? Why were there police officers on the other side? Then it hit him: he was in a maximum security prison. His heart sank as he realized that the nightmare of killing a man had been no nightmare at all.  
 

Marwen pulled his wrist again, thinking that he may be able to run, but as he turned his head as far as he could, he realized he was in an extremely secure room.  
 

He sighed, resigned to his fate. A heavy metal door creaked open, and he could hear multiple footsteps.  
 

A doctor walked up, this time a short and stout man. He placed a new IV in his arm, and started to check a few things on his new patient. The second set of footsteps had been a police officer. He didn’t do anything except for stand there.  
 

Marwen couldn’t figure out why they thought he was so incredibly dangerous. Yes, he had killed a man, but he had apparently not been in his right mind, and they don’t send a simple murderer to a maximum security prison... this was a place for the Hannibal Lecters of the world... not him!  
 

The door opened, and his sister walked in. He could hear the doctor mention how this was highly irregular, but he would allow it. She walked up to the wall in front of him, and taped a photo of a beautiful gloomy day, directly to the wall in front of Marwen, grabbed his hand, smiled, and walked back out.  
 

As she was walking out, he caught a sentence that made his mind reel...  
 

“I wish the treatment would have worked. You spent all your money to cure your brother, but after killing his 4th doctor, and escaping his 8th institution, it just couldn’t go on. I’m sorry.’  
 

He couldn’t think straight. He looked over at his sister, her eyes welling up with tears. Then he turned his head straight again, and looked at the picture of the beautiful autumn day. The last thing he saw was a picture of himself and his sister... standing under a beautiful tree of ambers, reds, and yellows, as the lethal concoction spread through his veins.

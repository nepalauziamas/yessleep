For a moment I saw only darkness, no sound, I could imagine myself in the cold arms of death, was this the end, would my pain finally end?

I didn't have time to enjoy such silence, because moments later I could hear the annoying sound of the alarm clock ringing, I managed to get the blood in my body to heat up with the anger I felt, but it shouldn't cause noise. As usual, I just calmly got out of bed, turned off the alarm clock, and looked at the calendar.

August 13th, as usual.

It's been a long time since I stopped counting the days, it seems like an eternity since I last found something new, it's incredibly boring. I considered going back to sleep, I had no reason to wake up anyway, no matter what I do I won't change my situation. But it would be even more monotonous to go back to sleep.

With that thought, I decided that I should start my day, with the little energy I had I got out of bed and opened the closet to change, I could smell the faint smell of bacon in the air, a smell that used to make me feel hungry but now it just makes me feel nauseous.

I looked in the mirror, my hair was messy, and my shirt was dirty and full of holes, although on my face I look well rested and happy, it wouldn't be hard to tell in my cold eyes that I'd been tired for a long time.

"..." Yeah, I was fine enough like that, there's no reason to be beatiful when you're stuck in a time loop, when I finished staring at myself I headed for the door, staring at her and questioning if my decisions were right, maybe i should go back to sleep? I don't know if I had the courage to start today.

Anyway, there's no reason for me to stress, it won't help at all, instead...

"Good morning Alice" I heard the same greeting when I opened the door, my boyfriend looked with the same usual smile, the same annoying smile as always, he was sitting eating breakfast, I forced myself to smile back "You should put these clothes to wash, they are dirty."

"No" I replied sitting down in the chair, I hesitated immediately realizing how quiet and cold my answer was and I looked at his face, it had been very cold, that's not how I would normally act "Ah, I'm lazy, I promise I will put something cleaner after eating, I just want to have a coffee to wake up before" I replied this time in a more kind way, he sighed and went back to eating, the smell of bacon was even stronger now. I felt like i was gonna throw up

"You better change soon, let's go out right after eating" He said while continuing to eat, I clenched my fists angrily, the same irritating phrase, no matter how different I tried to make this morning be, it always said the same things.

Don't get me wrong, I don't feel angry at the way he talks, but I'm already annoyed to hear the same annoying words coming from his mouth, like a broken radio, trying to hide my anger I just smile sweetly at him, picking up the knife and grabbing the bacon 

"Oh, don't worry, I won't forget, I was in a hurry to get up because I was hungry."

He looked at me and decided to stop talking, seeing that I had no intention of changing at the moment. Actually I wasn't hungry, and I had no reason to change, I had no intention of leaving the house today, I just wanted to get out of bed soon.

The days had been extremely boring lately, the same television show, the same radio broadcast, the same monotonous conversations, the same smiles, the same tears, there was no way for me to entertain myself, everything was extremely monotonous, however, the many loops ago...I killed my boyfriend

"It's very cold today, isn't it? But I like cold more than hot anyway." When he finished eating, he got up and took the plate to the kitchen sink, washing the plate and the cup he used. When I finished eating I got up, not bothering to bring the plate and glass with me, and went to him "Mm? What is this face, did you have a nightmare?"

"I heard a strange sound coming from the living room window" I said in a tired voice "Could you check for me?"

We were in an apartment on the tenth floor of a building, he immediately looked at me confused when I said that, there was no reason for me to have heard any sound coming from the window.

"It must have been just a bird, don't be afraid" He immediately put the plate on the shelf, following me as I walked towards the living room window, the only window in the apartment that was able to be opened. Iwatched him as he stuck his head out and looked around. "See, there's nothing here."

Before he could react, I pulled his legs up, he gasped and I got a glimpse of his panicked face before he fell to his death, I heard his scream which became more and more silent the deeper he fell, and finally stopping when he hit the ground. I approached and looked down, seeing his body motionless on the asphalt floor, death must have been instantaneous.

"..."

I started a habit of killing him every day since then, looking for new ways to end his life. It was a little scary actually, remembering the first day I had to wake up in the morning to greet him after he died, I was panicking and my heart was beating fast, I almost wasn't able to open the door, scared to see him again.

However, I'm used to it, after so many rough days, there's nothing that affects me. There's no reason for me to feel scared or sad, because I know the next day he'll be in the morning, with the same irritating smile, alive and well. Sometimes I'm afraid that one day I'll wake up and he won't be there anymore.

But it does not matter...

I approached the window, and without hesitation, I jumped, the cold winter air hitting my face, I felt butterflies in my stomach as my body lowered itself to the ground.

There's no reason for me to feel this way, instead of feeling scared, I should focus on making these monotonous days more interesting.

I felt extreme pain in every part of my body, but before I could process this pain, the world around me immediately turned black.

And again, there I was, in my bed this morning, on the 13th of August.

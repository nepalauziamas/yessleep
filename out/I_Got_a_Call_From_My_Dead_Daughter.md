My daughter died 10 years ago today, on *23rd May 2012*. Around that time everyone watched 2012 and speculated the world would end. The world survived, however, my life turned upside down when I lost my one and only daughter. It used to be just my wife, daughter and I, in a small suburban town. Her name was Maya, she was just about to turn 18 and head out for college but things took a turn for the worst. Maya and my wife Irene, were going out shopping to buy clothes and small decorations for her dorm room. It was a Sunday, so I was home from work, waiting for both of them to come home. I received a  call from the hospital that my wife was in due to a car crash. 

I ran over to the hospital to find just my wife Irene and no sign of my daughter. The paramedics told me that my wife lost control of the car and it smashed into an electricity pole and she had hit her head hard, so she won’t remember much. I asked the paramedics about my daughter to which they replied that, Irene was the only one in the car, I panicked and persistently told the doctors that my daughter was with her and they must have missed something but all they said was, “I know you’re in shock and you’re worried but your daughter was not in the car, maybe you’re wife dropped her off somewhere before the accident”. Maybe they were right, I called Maya’s cell but the call didn't go through.

During this time my wife regained consciousness and I ran over to see how she was doing. I asked her how she was feeling but she looked at me like she’s never seen me before in her life. “Irene, where's Maya?”. Irene with vessels in her eyes completely red, stared at me and said, “whose Maya? And who are you?.” The doctors came in and told me once again that she's hit her head and she won’t remember a thing. Irene was safe in the hospital but I kept getting more and more worried about Maya. Where could she be? Why can’t I reach her by phone? I couldn’t report it to the police as it hadn’t been  24 hours yet. I waited at the hospital for the doctors to discharge my wife, all while constantly ringing Maya, I called her 2 closest friends, but they also said the last thing Maya told them was that she was going shopping with her mother. 

After 24 hours had passed, I reported my daughter missing to the police, and they said they already had a car at the crash site and didn't find anyone else. They told me to take my wife back home and take care of her and if they found any new evidence they would contact me themselves. 

I went back to the hospital and the doctors said they would discharge my wife as she didn't have any life threatening injuries, they said she would start remembering herself, and gave me medication for any headaches she may have. I took my wife home and ever since, I have been taking care of her. She started remembering my name and her basic everyday life but she never once remembered anything about that night. 10 years later, she still doesn’t remember, and I’m assuming the police file on this case has been closed as well.

On the night of 23rd May 2022, as I write this, I received a phone call but the number didn't show up. I picked up the phone and from the other end there was loud static, loud enough for me to suddenly move the phone away from my ear. Behind the static was a girl's voice and what it said shocked me. “Hello? Dad?I don’t…..have…… time but….. to leave….. don’t…… for me, ……dead,.....mom……killed……me”. It was Maya on the other end, I’m sure of it, it sounded just like her.. My dead daughter just called me and told me that my wife killed her. She’s sleeping soundly in the other room. I don’t know what to make of it. Does Irene really not remember or is she faking it? Did my wife murder my daughter? If so, I’ve been living with my daughters murderer for the past 10 years. Maybe I should confront her, I hear her, she's awake and calling for me, I’m gonna do it, I’m gonna confront her, If I don’t respond, send help….

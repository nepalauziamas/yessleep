I was washing my hair with bar soap while pissing in the shower when I really considered how shitty my life had become.

I couldn’t afford both soap *and* shampoo, so I had to improvise. And sneaking into my college’s gym when I *probably* shouldn’t have been there meant time was of the essence, so I didn’t have the luxury of lounging around at the urinal.

Dirty clothes can be used as a towel, which is clever trick I learned while trying to save money on towels.

It doesn’t feel so clever upon remembering that you’re out of quarters (and therefore out of clean clothes) when your dirty garments are now dripping wet, and you have to race out of the gym with an unpleasantly warm and moist asscrack. 

I would have done a nude air-dry after getting home, but “home” was the back seat of my car this week. I really didn’t want to explain to the cops a *second* time that I wasn’t masturbating in my blue-green Toyota Corolla, but was just trying to get a breeze on my taint. 

I had to focus on making it to the next week; my buddy Tony said that I could crash on his floor for a few days, which is fucking awesome. Not only does he have a second towel that doubles as a blanket, but he also has an overlooked jar of mayonnaise, which means breakfast every day.

I freaked out when someone knocked on my window, because I always freak out when someone wakes me up while I’m sleeping in my car. Cops and meth heads both want money, and I’m not able to provide for either one, so things usually end up poorly. 

This guy was neither. With a black fedora and a black trench coat flanking a long, gray face, he would have been goth chic if he weren’t thirty years past teenagerhood.

*Knock knock knock* “Raymond Salach?” he called through the glass.

I always keep my car window rolled up. I used to leave it open a crack so that I could breathe, but some asshole slid a coathanger through the gap one time and unlocked the door, leaving me with a broken nose so that he could steal nineteen dimes and thirteen pennies from my dash.

I looked around blearily. Was I wearing pants? Yes, they were the same ones I’d put on yesterday after the shower. I realized this because the crotch always dries last when your clothes get wet, and that reality jolted me awake.

I sat upright and focused. This guy could easily be a threat; I had to play it cool, letting him know that I was intelligent enough to be aware of my surroundings, while also confident and cunning enough to use every hidden advantage to my benefit.

“Who the fuck are you?” I asked him stupidly. 

“Call me Advocatus,” he smiled without happiness. “Why don’t you roll down your window so that we can chat? Or, better yet, why don’t you come on out of the car?”

It didn’t seem like a great idea. But I was already wearing pants, so I figured the day had started well enough for me to take my chances. 

I climbed out of the car and remembered that my key was inside as I was closing it. I didn’t scream or yell; I just sighed and leaned against the door, feeling very forgotten.

“Mr. Salach, I’m here to tell you that you have not been forgotten,” he explained in a deep, nasally voice as he folded his hands over his briefcase handle.

I really didn’t know how to play this. Part of me wished that I had Tony’s mayonnaise, because it had expired four weeks earlier and really had a kick that got my mind running in the morning.

“If you think I haven’t been forgotten, then you’ve got the wrong Raymond Salach,” I mumbled as I rubbed my eyes.

“The wrong Raymond Salach who lives in a 1999 Toyota Corolla?” he asked with one brow raised.

“Yes…” I answered uncomfortably, trying to make myself appear very small.

“The wrong Raymond Salach from Brunswick, Maine, who is currently attending Bowdoin College on an academic scholarship that doesn’t cover the housing he hasn’t been able to afford since both of his parents died in a car crash last year?” Advocatus pressed calmly.

“Um. Yes. Must be.” I really, really wish I hadn’t left my keys in my car. I wanted to escape. 

I tried to think about where I might go. 

That’s when I decided to stay put. 

“Look, man. I don’t know what you want from me. My scholarship runs through the end of the semester, and then I’ll have nothing left to my name. I realize it might be against the law to sleep in my car, but I’m trying to avoid affecting anyone who might be offended by my presence. I’m just trying to hang on until I can’t.” I sighed and fell into a squat.

“That’s great. You must not know about your great Aunt Mary, to whom you’re the only living relative. You just inherited her mansion.” He opened his briefcase and handed me a folder.

“Oh,” I said as I took it from him. “And you’re sure that I’m… the correct Raymond Salach in a 1999 blue-green Toyota Corolla?” 
Mr. Advocatus slowly looked up the street, then turned and looked down the other way. “Tell you what. If a second one of you comes along, you two can split the inheritance evenly.”

*

I looked down at the mansion nestled up against the Androscoggin River. It somehow settled warmly into the surrounding environs while sharply declaring its carefully planned New England starkness to all who passed by.

Which wasn’t that many. This was a luxury retreat, free from all unpleasant trappings like traffic or other people.

“So this is the house,” I asked Mr. Advocatus incredulously. “It’s just… mine?”

“Well, you have to pay an inheritance tax. Fortunately, the trust fund covers that amount, with exactly enough left over earmarked for twenty years’ worth of property tax,” he explained matter-of-factly.

“Ah,” I responded.

“Yes, it’s a beautiful house,” he continued as he pulled a sheet of paper out of his briefcase. “You just have to follow this list of rules.”

“Oh, god *damn* it,” I shot back. “Are you kidding me? I *knew* there was a catch. Is this house supposed to be haunted? Is that it? Will bad things happen if I break one of the rules?” I was breathing heavily, so I forced myself to calm down. “Look, I’m – I’m sorry. It’s just a lot, you know?”

Mr. Advocatus held his unaffected smile, the paper ready for me to take as it wafted gently in the breeze. Honestly, it seemed like a dumbass idea to accept the list.

I took the list. “Is this everything?” I asked, still incredulous. “I can just – move in?”

“It’s all yours, Mr. Salach,” Advocatus responded. “Enjoy your new home.”

I nodded, then turned and dazedly walked toward the front lawn.

“Mr. Salach!” 

This had to be another catch. I turned around to face him.

He tossed me the Corolla keys. “Follow the rules. Things may surprise you.”

I thought that claiming the biggest bedroom would make me happiest, but it just highlighted how few possessions I had when a pile of books and dirty clothes fought against the emptiness. 

But I’d already hauled a stack of logs to the fireplace and dragged a mattress into the otherwise barren room, so I decided to settle in. 

It was dark by then; I started a fire and huddled close. 

Do you know what you imagine is nearby when nothing is nearby?

Everything.

The emptiness of the room grew large as I huddled closer to the fire, realizing for the first time that I had no idea if I even had central heat or electricity.

There was a lot that I didn’t know about this house. 

Why did a closet on the third story need a lock on the outside? What was the purpose of a window that led straight to an interior brick chimney? 

Why did it take three times as long to walk through the house as it did to walk around its perimeter?

My eyes wandered to my pocket.

I’d dismissed it at first, but where else did I have to turn?

I slowly unfolded the list of rules, holding it close to the crackling fire so that I could read it more clearly.

-----------

**Rules for Hill Street House**

1 – Never light a fire after dark.

2 – Knock on every door of the second story at least once a day. That keeps curious hands on the other side.

3 – Avoid the blue room at the end of the third floor hall. If you must go in, keep your eyes pointed downward the entire time, no matter what you hear. 

4 – Always sleep with your bedroom door closed. If you close it but hear footsteps in the room before falling asleep, then it entered well before you got a chance to shut it out.

Nope. I folded that shit up without reading the rest and set it aside. 

I don’t do this haunting shit. Mostly because I’m a skeptic, and the part that isn’t skeptical wants nothing to do with any such nonsense, so I figured dear Aunt Mary could take her rules into heaven or hell with her.

I still closed the door, though. 

And I put out the fire. 

Then I went to bed, because this day had been wild enough for an entire year, and I wanted to enjoy my mansion without giving myself a heart attack. 

The room was much quieter than I was used to as I tried to fall asleep. And it was much darker without streetlights illuminating the inside of my car while I drifted off. 

That, of course, let my imagination play tricks on me. 

The settling of an old wooden house sounded just like footsteps. 

Especially when they were so rhythmic. Like they were walking toward me.

It was particularly difficult to ignore the fact that they came at regular intervals.

I wrapped my arms around my ears and closed my eyes. 

*Creak. Step. Creak. Step.*

I really wish I hadn’t started that fire.

*Creak. Step.*

Or ignored the rules.

*Creak*

I should have known this house came with a cost. 

The air pressure changed just slightly, as though someone were standing over me. I kept my eyes closed despite the darkness. 

Fear is nothing but imagination run amok. Right?

I could dismiss minor sensory overreactions.

I could *not* dismiss the pressure that descended onto the edge of my mattress, which felt exactly like a man sitting down by my side.

The pressure moved toward me, my heart racing.

It felt like two hands crawling along the bed, once placed in front of the other as it got nearer and nearer.

I didn’t move.

Cold air caressed my face in the exact cadence of human breath.

I had to move.

I opened my eyes to total darkness, but I knew it was there. 

“Look, I realize that I didn’t put out the fire, or shut the door, or whatever it was that you expected me to do, because I only read part of the damn list and ignored the rest. But here’s the thing – I’m going to be in a scary place no matter what, whether it’s people or ghosts of people haunting me. So I have to ask: do you have a body?”

Something huffed, and a burst of cold air rushed over my face. 

“Okay, I’m going to assume you don’t. So what are you going to do to me that a meth head couldn’t? Or, more importantly, what kinds of things can a meth head pull off that are simply impossible for an entity with no body?”

Silence.

“Right. So here’s the thing – you might be scary, but you’re dead, and this is my house now.” My heart was beating hard enough to threaten my eardrums. “So we’re all going to have to learn to coexist. Because whatever crazy shit you have in store is worth the cost of rent, which is *nothing.* Get it?” 

I was panting in fear, but determined to finish.

A light burst of air whispered past my ear; I could have sworn it was confused.

“Bitch, it means that now *I’m* haunting *you.*” I dropped back down to the mattress and wrapped my arms around my ears once more. “So learn to live with it, or what ever it is you do. Tomorrow we can draft a *new* list of rules, because things are going to be different around here. [Good night](https://www.facebook.com/P-F-McGrail-181784199029462/).”

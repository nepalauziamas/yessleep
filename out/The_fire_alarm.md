It’s dark so I turn on the bedside lamp and it takes a little while for my eyes to adjust to the bright yellow light. When I can see again I realize that the time is 02:04, the noise sounds even louder now. I walk over to the living room and I’m trying to localize the constant ringing, it takes a while and then I finally notice that it is the fire alarm. I take it down from the ceiling and take a seat on my leather couch. I can't find a button to turn it off so I take out the battery. The sound stops and I’m off to bed again, but just as I’m about to close the bedroom door it starts, it’s even louder now than before. Walking back to the living room I feel a chill going through my spine, I remember that I turned off the floor lamp because it was too bright but now it’s on again. Maybe I didn’t turn it off or maybe I turned it back on before going back to bed? Anyway the alarm keeps ringing and I cut the cords in hope that it would work, but it doesn't. There’s a knocking on my door but I didn’t hear anyone walk around outside, my house has gravel in front of it so you can hear when someone walks up to the house. I walk to the door to look through my peepinghole but nobody's there, maybe I heard wrong. Walking back to the living room I grab my hammer that’s laying on a shelf from when I was hanging it up. The fire alarm is laying on my living room table, I put it under a thin pillow and start hammering it. The alarm stops and there are little plastic bits all over the table.

The house is quiet and I’m finally laying in my bed, as I’m closing my eyes I hear it. The ringing is back, but the fire alarm is demolished. God why is this happening? Well I get upset and take all the little bits and throw it in the trash can outside. Now maybe I can get some sleep, but first I need a glass of water. As I’m filling up my glass I hear knocking on the front door again, but it’s not a regular knock it sounds like the knocking is moving all around the door. I take a knife and walk to the hallway. There is no one there, but.. no? It can’t be, or could it? I hear the ringning.

I’m hiding in my bathroom, the knife in one hand and my phone in the other. There’s no signal, I always have signal in the house. The knocking has moved to the bathroom door and the ringing is louder. \*ding\* I get a notification, “How dare you throw me away? I AM THE OWNER OF YOU and YOU throw ME away? How do you like it now, hiding in the bathroom alone with no one to help. I will never stop.” The knocking is everywhere, I can’t think, I’m writing this at 02:36 and hoping that it gets posted. Sometimes the connection comes back and I think, no I pray to a god i don’t believe in that this gets out. DO NOT throw away your alarms.

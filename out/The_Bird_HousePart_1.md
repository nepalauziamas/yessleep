  

This kid named Ethan dialed 911 at 1:42 AM claiming there were people on the ground floor of his house. He claimed his parents were at a restaurant and he hadn’t heard anyone enter. The dispatcher told him to stay on the phone while he sent some people to search the building.

We got there in 12 minutes. (I drive fast when there’s home invasion involved.) The dispatcher told Ethan to come to the front door, however, he refused, since he could still hear people downstairs. The doors where locked, and it took us a few minutes to get in. 

I immediately went upstairs, while the others searched the building, to make sure Ethan was still on the second floor and found him crying in the corner of his room.

„Hey there. The police are searching the building. I’ll stay up here to make sure you’re safe, Okay?” No response. He continued sobbing in the corner.

„Are you okay? Can you hear me?” The sobbing stopped.

„Uhhh.. Yeah, yeah. I’m fine.”

„Do you feel nauseous?”

„No. I’m fine…” His voice sounded far more monotone this time.

„The dispatcher probably asked you this, but when did the noises start?”

„A few minutes before I called the police. I heard this… Dragging noise, and people started muttering downstairs.”

I left the room and sat in a chair in the hallway, waiting for the others to finish searching. I waited for a few minutes until Keith, one of my coworkers, approached me.

„We’ve searched the entire ground floor. There’s nothing here. We’re still going to check the basement just to be safe.”

We called Ethans parents and left after searching the basement. We all assumed it would end here.

Of course, this could be explained. A nine-year-old, home alone at 2 AM could have experienced sleep paralysis, had nightmares, or maybe mistook birds outside for voices, so most of us were shocked when we received a call the next day, at exactly 1:42 AM. It was Ethan again, sounding far more distraught this time, begging us to send someone immediately. We did exactly that.

This time, the dispatcher claimed he could hear banging and unintelligible speech in the background, confirming Ethans claims, and to the dispatchers surprise, he hung up a few minutes into the call.

We arrived to see the buildings driveway butchered. The concrete was split in half and covered with concerningly deep cracks. Some of us were able to reach the building and break in.

There was no one there. Ethan was sitting on the couch this time, crying silently as he stared at the kitchen. He refused to speak, or even react to any questions. The only information we were able to get out of him, was that his parents had, once again, left and hadn’t returned yet.

We tried calling them again, and this time, they answered. We explained that Ethan had called 911 after they had left, and that a potential home invasion had occurred. They were understandably horrified after hearing this, and told us they would be back shortly.

They arrived 5 minutes later, so we left the building, except this time, we decided to keep an eye on the house for the night, ready to go back the second we saw something sketchy.

We parked close to the house in an unmarked car and waited.

At around 3 AM, we saw a man, who I recognized to be Ethans father, leave the building, screaming into his phone. Before we could even open the doors, we got a call from the dispatcher.

„They called 911 again. That guy who just returned to his house just called us saying his family had been eaten-„

„Eaten? He *specifically* said „eaten”?”

„Yeah. He did. I couldn’t get him to elaborate. I think he may have smashed the phone.”

I looked up to see what looked seemed to be glass shards on the road.

„Yeah, he did. If there’s still intruders in there, we may need backup.”

Another call interrupted the conversation. 

„Oh shit! These things killed everyone in the building. Get in here immediately!”

I, alongside a few of my coworkers smashed in the door of the building, only to see a mangled corpse propped up in the doorway. We were all thinking the same thing at this point:

*What the shit is this?*

We proceeded inside the building and entered the living room, only to hear mumbling coming from the kitchen. The door was locked, so we all proceeded, pointing our guns at the door. 

„Hello?”

No answer.

„Open the door immediately, and exit the room.”

The mumbling continued.

„If you refuse to leave the room, we will break down the door.”

Still no reaction. We broke down the door, pointing our guns at the middle of the room.

We all stopped, lowered our weapons and stared at the table in the middle of the room. Ethans slightly decomposing corpse lay on the table, watched from across the room by a crouching man wearing an oversized blue robe with his face fully concealed. 

On the table, alongside Ethan stood two morbidly oversized birds with feathers the exact same shade of blue as the mans cloak. 

They stared at us in complete silence, until the man spoke.

„Food”.

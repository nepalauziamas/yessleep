Level One

So you have found yourself in a place you've never seen before. You walk down a singular repeating street with the same similar-looking homes. Do not worry the place you are in we call  Uncanny Valley. There are no entities that inhabit it. Feel free to check the homes for food and water, the plumbing in the homes, or the water doesn't work but you will find electricity is still running. You should be able to charge your phone freely.

Take a breather, you are seeing this post because you have entered Pandora's Box or you have just stumbled upon it by accident, all I know is that anyone that posts from Pandora's Box can all see it right away. Do not question it just be grateful. There is not much to say about what Pandora's Box , other than that we all have entered here without memory of doing so.  There is one thing that's going to be hard to stomach. Since you've entered Pandora's Box it is unlikely you will be able to leave but there is a possibility.

Staying in Uncanny Valley might be good for anyone who are afraid to fight for their life, or deal with the harsh reality ahead. There are many levels within Pandora's Box, some good, some bad, and some downright terrible. Try not to worry too much because I will be telling you how to prolong your inevitable doom.

There are many ways to leave Uncanny Valley which is good for new people. You will find chalk outlines of doors placed on various walls where a room should be inside of the homes. These doors open up in a pattern. Every 5 homes to the right and every 8 on the left, It is unclear why this is the way things happen to be, It is assumed that anyone who is running this place wants to you enter the next level unprepared. Thankfully enough you have this post to know that this isn't a good idea!

Do not press up against these outlines or it will open up to level Two. I will go into detail about level two later. First, you will need to get supplies ready refer to this checklist of things you are going to need.

* A Weapon
* Clothes/armor
* Food/water
* A Tent
* camping supplies (Sleeping Bag, cooking ware, and fire starters)
* A Hiking Bag
* If you are lucky a bike or scooter

Do not be worried about the items on this list. The homes are likely to have them except for a bike or scooter. Those are rare but have been reported to be seen. I'm going to assume though that you didn't find one but on the other hand the rest of the items are easily able to be acquired. The homes are built like a suburb you must have been able to tell. So go around and search until you find all the items. Tents can be usually found in a garage along with the camping supplies you will need. A weapon on the other hand you will not be able to find without building one, you will need more than a kitchen knife to get done with level 2, so you will need to craft one. I would recommend making a spiked shield and any kind of weapon you can make for offensive attacks.

You can find metal trashcans all along the road so grab one of the lids and drill some nails into it. You can find the supplies to build your weapons in the garage of any of the homes. Next, you will need to acquire some form of an offensive weapon. I'd recommend sawing of a table leg to a chair in one of the homes or if you are lucky remove the most durable pipe you can find from under one of the sinks or the basement of the homes. These are just recommendations, but you will need to make sure you find something that you are going to be good with. Take a couple of days if you want to practice with the weapon of your choosing.

Once you have gained some form of experience from practice, you will need some form of armor. Try to find helmets, arm pads, and duct tape. You will want to tape a flashlight to your helmet to be able to see or if you are lucky use a headlamp.  The next thing you want to do before entering level 2 is tape up your arms and legs, to prevent injuries from biting. Anywhere that can be exposed to teeth latching onto your skin is something you are going to want to cover up. The beings that reside on level 2 rely on biting and scratching a lot of the time but some may have a weapon so please do be careful.

When leaving level 1, try to be respectful to the next person who enters Uncanny valley. If you have created of home base please give some sort of sign and leave a note with steps on what to do in case someone doesn't have a phone. After all of this and you are ready to risk your life, you may push on one of the chalk doorways.

You will notice that on the other side will most likely be a swamp. Enter with caution, if you see anything on the side leave that doorway and try another. Once you have found a way through assess your surroundings and try to make a base of operations. You are going to be there for a while Doorways are not as frequent as level 1.

For now, I'm going to leave you alone to figure stuff out by yourself for a bit but I will update with another post later. Remember all the stuff I have told you. There is no going back to level one. Quick tips though, do not go towards the yellow eyes. Stay on high alert instead and do not go towards any sounds of pleads for help. I can assure you that there are definitely people in trouble but the creatures attacking them will not stop for a second to think about if they should attack you. They just will.

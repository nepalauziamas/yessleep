Another   missing person’s case. This time, a family. Traveling by van. It’s  been  a week or so since I went snooping outside, and you’d better  believe I  got grilled by my friends about that night, and again by my  mother when  she saw my face.

It  was getting  hard dealing with the questions and accusations of my  friends, but even  harder walking on eggshells around grandma and trying  to keep mom from  worrying. So, on yet another morning, I resigned  myself to suffer my  friends again—after all, Gil, at least, wasn’t so  bad.

“Here  she comes!” Danny  hopped off the bench. I steeled myself for his usual  barrage of  accusations, but the excitement on his face was different  this time.

“Bout time,” Gil said, cool as ever, cool as the grey cloudy sky overhead. Had it ever been blue since we got here?

Russ and Sarah said nothing, but stared at me for a moment, then looked to Gil.

“What’s up guys?”

“Do you want to see something real cool?” Gil asked.

\*\*\*

The   walk took us the better part of an hour, an fairly far out of town.  Out  this way, instead of suburbs, rolling hills of green and gold grass   awaited us, and sandwiched between those hills every so often, a house   large enough to see from a great distance. We made our way past  scenery  like this for awhile, until we came to a set of hills that had  no  house—only the charred remains of one.

There   was a rusty gate, locked of course, that barred us for the property.  We  found a rock and a stick and let ourselves in. The overgrown yard   reminded me of Grandma’s but it was much larger and more dense. I almost   lost my flip flops more than once. Eventually, we got up to the ruins.   At this point, all that remained were the partial walls of the front,   little more than stones scorched black from the fire-along with the   timbers that had not entirely burnt up.

“What is this place?”

“Don’t you know anything?” Sarah asked. “[Some rich guy burned down his mansion a few weeks ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/ugk9ot/my_good_for_nothing_dad_passed_away_the/).”

“That’s not what I heard,” Russ cut in. “I heard it was a demon.”“Demons aren’t real.”“But witches are?”

Gil chuckled.

All   that was left was the ground floor- buts and pieces of furniture that   hadn’t quite burned up. It was cool to look at, for a bit, anyway. The   footprint of the house, and the bits of wall that still stood, made it   clear it had been big.

“Hey guys,” Russ said. “I found something.”

We shuffled toward the back of the ruins, where Russ stood, staring down at something--

Stairing,   more accurately; what was left of the flight descended into the earth;   the gray light of day illuminated part of the basement. It was pretty   dark otherwise, but there was a particular curve that was darker even   than the shadow.

“What is that?”

We   picked our way down the decrepit staircase, into a burnt, soot filled   basement. It became clearer now what we were looking at.

The remains of a pentagram, smudged across the floor in blood.

No one said anything, and we all avoided each other’s eyes. Only Gil stared intently at the circle, his face unreadable.

“I don’t like this,” Sarah said.-

Had dolls once lined this basement, too?

Whatever   had been in the basement, wasn’t. the checkered floor was smudged and   dirty, partially covered with debris from the level above. The  pentagram  dominated the space- three quarters of it remained, only the  part under  the collapsed upper layers had been worn away by exposure.

We   poked about in the basement, everyone trying, and failing, to ignore   it. In fact, Gil stared at it openly, intently, even as we shuffled   around. As I was glancing back at him, my foot hit something hard, metal   by the sound of clattering it made as it bounced away from me.

“Hey guys!” I called. “I found something!”

It   had rolled into a darker corner of the basement, and as I realized   this, fear and curiosity battled it out. I looked back to my friends,   who all looked at me expectantly. I’d never hear the end of ‘chicken’ or   ‘wuss’ if I didn’t retrieve whatever it was, and I reasoned nothing  was  scarier than Grandma’s basement—or Grandma herself whenever she  caught  me snooping around. Into the dark, then.

For   one wild instant, I imagined it- Grandma waiting in the dark corner to   grab me by my cheek and scold me, drag me all the way home.

But   no, in the darkness was a small bronze urn. It spun listlessly as I   approached it. I picked it up, surprised at how heavy it was—how hot.

“What is it?” Russ asked, suspicion on his face.

I   carried it back toward them. “It’s an urn.” I showed it to them, and   Danny snatched it up right away, shoving his little face against the   opening.

“There’s nothing in here,” he said. After a moment, he pulled back, and we all had a laugh at the black ring around his face.

“What?”

“Nevermind that,” Gil said. He looked to all of us in turn, saving me for last. Suddenly, I felt as hot as the urn had.

“Let’s finish it.”

“Finish..?” Sarah pondered. “You don’t mean—”

Gil dispelled the sentence with a wave toward the missing part of the pentagram.

Sarah,   Danny, Russ and I all looked to the missing piece. We looked to each   other. Our decision was unanimous; the question now was who would say so   to Gil.

Three pairs of eyes bored into me.

Sighing, I looked to Gil. He hunched over the circle, his back to me.

“I don’t know, Gil-” I said, looking to the others for support.

“It feels like maybe we should leave it alone,” Danny added. In the dimness of the basement, he looked mousier than ever.

“Is   that what you two think?” Gil asked, turning on Russ and Sarah. He   stood up and started to pace. Overhead, from at least what we could see   in the basement, the cloud roiled restlessly.

“Nothing cool ever happens in this town, and now we have this-” here, he gestured to the circle—“And you all are scared?”

“It’s blood,” Russ protested.

“So?”   Gil pressed. He started crawling around on his hands and knees. Then,   he lifted something- a piece of charcoal, likely the remains of part of   the rafters.

“Use this.”

No one took it.

“Well? Come on then!”

Once again, all eyes fell on me.

“She’s the witch,” Sarah mumbled.

I   could feel hot tears stinging the corners of my eyes. Everything was   getting tingly and I couldn’t breathe. I glanced to the stairs; no one   was actively blocking me, but if I ran, would they stop me?

I looked back to find Gil stalking toward me, charcoal outstretched. He flashed that cool, collected smile as he approached me.

“Well c’mon, witch,” he said playfully.

It just wasn’t the same for me.

\*\*\*

It  was getting dark when I finished. Had it taken me that long?

&#x200B;

Most of the circle was complete when we arrived; I didn't have much to fill in, and yet now it was nearly night and I couldn't even remember finishing the pentagram. One moment, Gil was handing me the charcoal, and the next, we were climbing out of the basement. Everything in between?

Gone.

I tried, and failed, to piece everything together. I started with what had happened as soon as we entered the basement. Everything was clear in my mind then. As I thought further along, my head began to throb. In fact, the closer I got to Gil's insistence that we fill it in, the hazier things got, and the more my head hurt. In the end, I couldn't recall what had happened, and just trying to remember brought on a massive headache. It sucked, but as long as I didn't think too much about the gap, the throbbing was bearable.

The only proof of what had happened? Ugly black stains darkening my palms. My hands smelled so foul, like I'd been writing with sulfur instead. Just looking at them made me uncomfortable; somehow, it felt wet and sticky, and a little warm...I wiped my hands on my shorts, but it didn't do any good. My hands were no less dirty, sticky, and smelly, and now I'd smeared the same gunk on my clothes.

Whatever. Just another part of a day gone sour. A headache and being filthy were nothing new, and not nearly the worst result of our little adventure.

No one said it, in fact, no one said anything, but it was time to go home. We moved as briskly as we could, but  it didn’t matter;  at this point, we were all going to be in trouble, no matter how quickly we hustled.

Dealing with the whispers was a little harder.

At first, I thought it was the gang talking about me. I had noticed how they all huddled together, Russ, Sarah, and Danny, walking just a little further ahead, not looking back.  But the more I listened, the more I realized the voices didn't sound anything like them. Not them.... not Gil.

For the most part, my friends looked absolutely miserable. And yet the voices--very quiet voices, almost excited, chattering over each other. If I could make anything out--

*Thank you.*

The sort of gratitude that should have been comforting, but it picked at me instead. It was the only 'positive' of the night.

Still, worse:

Worse than the silent walk home,

Worse than the awkward, stiff goodbyes,

the way my friends wouldn't even look at me....

Gil.

Even in the twilight, with the sun rapidly disappearing over the horizon, it was hard to miss the wild grin plastered all over his  face.

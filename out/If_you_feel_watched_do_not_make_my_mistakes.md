After years of torment because I thought I was being watched I tried to find out why I felt that .

Keep in mind that I am more like a scared cat not a brave dog

So first I went to the therapist but he didn't find anything wrong with my brain . But after that method not working , I finally saw it , in the corner of my laptop screen , a distorsioned figure that it seemed familiar.

After that I went to the church to ask for a priest to exorcise "the thing" but here things started to go downhill . 

After paying a considerable sum to the priest I convinced him to exorcise my house . But when he was about to finish he exploded in to pieces and the figure appeared but I ran outside the house and went to my friend to stay a little

So when  things calmed I tried to decipher this thing's face ... It was my dead grandpa . But ... my family cremated him . I went at my family's house to see it's remains ..... They were not there.

My grandpa always hated me and after I tried to "kill" him after he died .... He is coming for me .

I begun to prepare buying all the crucifixs and buckets upon buckets of holy water

He was here , I will make him rest forever ... Too bad .... My ...... Grandpa ...... Was ..... More ....... Powerful

He made one small mistake . Keeping me alive to continue the torment .

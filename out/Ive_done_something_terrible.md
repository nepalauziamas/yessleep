I’m sitting in the asylum right now, waiting for further instruction. I’m not sure I’ll make it. The doctors have allowed me 4 minutes to call or text somebody, so if my family sees this, I’m sorry.. if that’s even enough….

What happened I can never forgive myself, it’s so traumatizing I can barely think about it without shaking aggressively.. my fingers tremble as I type this alone.

It was a normal Sunday at Dairy Queen, me and my two friends Angela and Frank were working at the counter.

It wasn’t too busy, as our restaurant happens to be on the edge of town.

Around 2:42 P.M., Angela and Frank go on break, and immediately these group of girls come in, there were four of them from very diverse races and cultures, now, they sit down.

They converse and laugh like a normal high-school group of girls, not knowing in a few minutes their lives will be destroyed and their dreams for anything left in life will be crushed like when a kid jumps on a fallen leaf.

Once their finally ready to order, this one short girl with brown hair and hazel eyes, we’re going to call her “May” comes up and politely orders a vanilla cone. A single, plain, vanilla cone.

I find it odd no other girl orders a treat, but I brush it off and make the cone for the sweet girl.

As the cone finishes, she sighs, almost a raspy tone coming out as she exhales.

I hand the cone to her, but before she is able to grip the cone, my arm suddenly impulses, and the ice cream cone smashes into her chest.

I don’t have a history of alien-hand syndrome or neurological issues in my ancestry, but as soon as the ice cream hits her chest, she stumbles back, and her chest begins to almost, melt?

She lets out an ear-piercing scream as her chest mulitates and bubbles, leaving her chest open, muscles, nerves, tendons, and everything showing in main sight.

I tremble in shock, trying to stay conscious as my vision blackens from the corners of my eyes. 

The girl falls forward, gasping for breath, and I look towards the table where her friends were. They’re gone. Disappeared out of thin air.
 
Suddenly voices ring in my head, whispering, taunting, and mocking me. By now the girls lungs are exposed, and I hurl on the ground below me as I fall to my knees.

I shake, and she pulls towards me, with her bones of fingers where the ice cream spilled.

She grabs me, pulling right to her, and an immense, unexplainable pain pulls on every joint in my body.

I try to move, I try to scream, but nothing comes out. Tears stream out of my eyes, and her eyes stream black tears onto my back as I kneel still on the ground.

A burning pain fills my back, but it slowly turns into a peaceful sensation. Maybe this madness will end…. Maybe I’ll finally be free….

But as soon as it started, it’s finished. I’m curled up in a ball on the ground, crying and violently trembling as Angela shakes me back into reality, and Frank calls 911.

It seems I had fallen on the ground, and got covered in blood as I thrashed around, but there were no signs of injuries on me, meaning the blood couldn’t be mine….

It also doesn’t explain the scars and black teardrops left on my back..

Haha, it may seem silly but it’s real. ITS REAL. And it’s just the beginning, why doesn’t anyone believe me? Why am I locked up in this dirty, gross, hell of an asylum?
 
Wait, what’s that sound echoing from under the bed….?

The original story I published can be found here https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/qb1ri2/i_am_hunter_m_stop_believing_in_cryptids/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share

It's been a long time since I've been able to write to you all once more. My apologies, I was waiting for approval from the Organization I work for, as well as recovering from recent jobs. The approval process went much better than expected, I have been cleared to disclose to you all more information and stories than I could have ever hoped for. The Organization exists solely to prevent the creation of more, and new, cryptids, so I suppose it only makes sense that they would like to be as transparent as reason allows with the people at large, the people who believe.

To reiterate once more, the goal of these stories is to explain to you the process of the creation of cryptids, as I did in my original message and story to you all, and to prevent it from happening anymore. Understanding something and knowing it to be true is not the same as belief, and the Organization hopes that by letting you all know what really happens, and why it happens, that it will cease to happen.

A brief synopsis for those who have forgotten, or those who don't know; humans have a strong power in their belief of something. Belief in something, whether real or not, can create something new, or drastically alter something already existing. The more people who believe something, especially when the details are the same, the more likely, and the more powerful, the manifestation will be.

So the Organization I work for hopes that bringing light to this fact, and bringing light to the fact that cryptids do exist, and are a direct byproduct of humanity's existence and beliefs, that it will counteract it, causing belief to be reality, and the unknown to be known. This may not entirely make sense to some of you, but the Organization has been around for... a long time. Turning belief into knowledge is one of the only ways they've found to counteract this manifestation phenomenon present in our species.

The origins of the Organization date back to far, far before modern civilization, and have adapted to many different beliefs and superstitions, as well as recurring popular culture beliefs surrounding creatures and their weaknesses. I'm not at liberty to disclose all of the nitty gritty details, but think B.C., and you'll around the ballpark for our origins.

Now the belief-manifestation curse of humanity isn't always a bad thing. In fact, sometimes it can be used as a boon, or even a weapon. An unfortunate, yet fortunate, byproduct of mutation, evolution, and adaptation is the production of entities like us, but so foreign they're almost alien. One of these mutants, or evolutionary branches, or however you choose to see them, are known as the Slate.

Slate are creatures very similar to humans, except they are both literally thoughtless and emotionless, hence the name Slate. The Slate do have one very useful attribute though; they are powerful vessels for thought and belief. For some reason we don't quite understand, Slate have an exceptional manifestation capability. Slate are the absolute most important thing to the organization.

Just a few Slate can perform manifestation at a rate one would expect to see if **thousands** of regular humans were to believe in something. So we.. utilize that. Look, I don't necessarily agree with the manner we treat Slates but I do recognize the unfortunate necessity to utilizing them. Although, they do live like Kings when we find them, and for the rest of their natural born lives.. though they don't understand it necessarily.

All of the Hunters have unnatural lifespans, durability, and basically live their lives as enhanced humans, by utilizing Slate. This is where we run into the limitations of Slate though. While their manifestation rate is off the charts, when it comes to very specific things, such as giving a human unnatural speed, durability, lifespan, etc. their efficacy is reduced compared to a regular human. Our lifespans aren't thousands of years or anything, our durability isn't super hero level, and our speed isn't comparable to a Speedster. We are simply humans, but a  bit more.

Slate are also used to strengthen and reinforce superstition, existing beliefs, and, to a degree, maintain current superstitions and beliefs that work in the Hunters favor. Many cryptids being weak to silver, having vulnerability to light, you get the gist. They can also be used to imbue weapons with.. well I suppose most of you would call them enchantments or something of the like, but not quite in the way you think. An unnaturally sharp edge, unnatural durability, unnaturally light weight while maintaining its strength, that kind of thing.

However there is a downside to the Slate. A severe one. Contact with anything created through human belief, even their own (for example; cryptids, deities, "enchanted" weapons) is impossible. Any contact with, I suppose you'd call them anomalies, causes a Slate to become a Void.

Voids are similar to the Slate, being that they are derived from them, except Void seek to rectify their thought- and emotion-less existence, by any means necessary.

Void outbreaks are rare, and low in number, but always classified as an immediate, urgent threat to not only all personnel on-site, and the facility itself, but all life on Earth. Voids seek to gain their higher level of sentience through the devouring of human souls, but just as their name implies, it is impossible. The emptiness inside of a Slate, and subsequently a Void, can only be temporarily filled, and only from an outside source. Nothing from within, whether they devour it or not, can sustain their minds, personality, or emotion, so they will go on consuming every living sentient creature on Earth until only they remain, and then eventually they will fade out themselves, leaving nothing behind.

I've only ever been witness to one Void outbreak, and I hope it's the last I'll ever be a part of for the next 80 or so years I have left to live, unless one of those damned cryptids or even a Void takes me out first.

The day had mostly started like any other I'd been given a job, it was to take care of an unknown winged cryptid sighting in Saudi Arabia; a story in and of itself, but for another time. As I'd finished packing my personal belongings and had begun to pack the gear I was expecting to need for the trip and choose a partner to come along with me, as it was a Goliath class cryptid from the description, possibly greater, the lights in the facility went dark. I stared up in wonder, as power outages never happen to the facility, and the lights only turn off under one circumstance. "Shit." I muttered, grabbing my spear from the case I had just stored it in to transport with me to Saudi Arabia. Shortly after, the red emergency lights came on, and a blaring alarm sounded all across the facility. 

The facility Majoris came on over the intercom and began to announce the cause of the alarm: "Attention all on-site Hunters, there has been a Void outbreak. Attention all on-site Hunters, there has been a Void outbreak. All Hunters report to the Slate holding area to deal with the threat. All jobs are to be put on hold until the threat has been eliminated. This is a priority assignment, to be dealt with immediately." The Majoris sounded calm, as if instead of ringing the death knell for some of us, and those who had already been consumed, he was reading off a script for a fucking infomercial. But I suppose higher ups have to remain calm even in crises..

I sprinted as hard and fast as my legs could take me, a considerable clip that would make Olympic athletes blush mind you, but even still feared I might be top laye to save another life. The facility I'd been staying at the time was in a less populated area of the United States, so they Organization deemed that this facility could be made bigger, since it wouldn't have many people to draw the attention of.

I made my way past the site's researchers and guard personnel, as the throng moved away from the Slate holding area, towards a safe house designed for on-site threats. As I sprinted down the labyrinthine corridors, I was joined by 2 other Hunters that rounded a corner I had passed, not yet blooded. Not yet given their name, and initial. One of them ran down the hall with a pole arm in his possession, a Halberd of some kind, I couldn't quite tell the design given the urgency and speed with which we all moved. The other carried a specialized high-power rifle, more akin to a cannon than a gun, that could only be wielded by a Hunter. I was familiar with that one, my best friend had carried one just like it.

No words were spoken, we all knew our duty, and that our lives were at stake. We arrived at the Slate holding area shortly after grouping up together, and we slowed to a painfully slow walk, as we had seen obvious evidence of a major fight having taken place in our area. A few of the red emergency lights overhead had been shattered, and left flickering or dead completely. We all readied our weapons for a surprise attack and formed up, with myself in the lead, the unblooded Hunter with the Halberd behind me, and the one with the almost-cannon taking up the rear a few paces behind.

I lead us through the hallway as we searched the rooms nearby, some were untouched except for signs of someone dropping everything to run. Some... had lifeless bodies with pure-white eyes and pale skin. Their soul had already been devoured. There was nothing we could do for them, except for come back after the mission to give them a proper burial.

After examining the 5th or so room in the hallway leading to the holding area, we came together, all confused as the other "Where the hell could the Voids have gone? We couldn't have missed them on our way here, and there are obvious signs they've been in the area." I asked the other Hunters.
"Well what if they turned back for some reason M? What if they somehow detected another living person back towards the holding area and turned back to go after em?" Asked the one with the Halberd
"This area should have been the first evacuated. All the people in this block should be evacuated.. or dead. The only way there could be someone back there is if..."
A loud droning noise, some sort of electronic screeching noise could be heard from down the hallway towards the holding area, followed by 1, 2, then 3 gunshots.

"Someone snuck past the Voids as a distraction.. Come on!" I said, sprinting out of the room we'd investigated, past the other 2 Hunters as fast as I could, followed quickly by the pair. The hall leading to the holding area was long and straight, a direct contrast to the labyrinthine corridors of the rest of the facility, on purpose. It was exactly just in case a Void outbreak occurred.

Three more gunshots resounded in the hallway, closer this time, much closer as we approached the research lab near the Slate holding cells. The gunshots sounded as though they were coming from within. I begged my body to allow my legs to pump faster, faster dammit! I heard a horrific scream as we were nearing the door to the research lab.

I burst through the door just in time to witness the Voids pinning the man down, their jaws unhinged and agape. These horrific creatures were mockeries of humans and Slate both. Expressionless, jet-black eyes, mangled yellow teeth, flat skin and bone where a nose should be, deathly pale skin, starting to turn a sickly yellow and begin to tan like leather as they consumed the man's soul, skin so wrapped to the bone it looked like an old man who'd lived far, far beyond his time, and nails like talons, but cracked and caked in a sticky black substance. The worst part was the absolute darkness, void of anything, that was their mouths. A noise like the coarse, sighing winds of some ancient desert escaped from their mouths as they sucked the man's soul from his body. White mist poured out of the man's eyes and parts of his extremities, and from the direct center of his torso, and into the waiting maws of the abyss that were the Voids.

I let Primal fury take over as I released a call to war to my fellow Hunters, hoping it would be enough to waylay their fear.. my fear as well. It worked, the one with the Halberd charged as I began to run at the three Voids standing over the man's almost lifeless body, and the one with the rifle let loose a round from his rifle as he entered the room that almost deafened me with its blast as it whizzed by my ear. One of the Voids staggered as they all simultaneously turned to stare at our approaching war party.

I made it to the group of Voids first, narrowly dodging a swipe from the decrepit-looking, yet inhumanly fast creature. I made my way behind it as I stepped through its claw swipe, managing to thrust my spear into what you would estimate to be its Achilles' tendon, and it fell to the ground as expected. I attempted the coup dé grâce on the fallen Void, but another stepped in to attempt to grapple me.

I managed to bring my spear to bear against it, and it grabbed the shaft of my spear instead of my arms as it intended. I struggled with the mighty creature, until it pinned me against a wall, pushing me into the corner. It forced me there, and began to open its maw to try and devour my soul as well.

I tried to wrench myself free, but made very little progress against it. I thought I might have been done for, until the Hunter with the halberd came to my aid. He positioned the reverse spike beneath its feet, sweeping its leg from underneath it. It lost balance, and I was able to wrench my spear free and throw the Void to the ground. Its landing jarred it, stunning it long enough for us to thrust both the head of my spear and the forward spike of his halberd into the Void's head.

As we smote the one, another shot rang out almost deafeningly loud, and we turned in time to see the one I had severed the Achilles' tendon of have its head explode into shards of bone and flesh.. as well as to have the final Void successfully swipe the Halberd wielding Hunter across the eye, and down his face.

He screamed in what could only be extreme agony, as the sticky black substance gave their claws an acid-like reaction to human flesh. He might live, but for the time being he'd be incapacitated. I knew the only shot we had for any of us to make it out if this alive would be to get a lucky stab at its head, or give the rifle-bearing Hunter time to line up a shot.

I didn't think, I didn't have time to, I swung my spear from the side in the hopes the Void would dodge, trying more to keep it at bay than to harm it. It dodges most of my attacks, and attempted a few of its own, connecting one across my shoulder and attempting to go for the head after. I ducked in time to avoid having my head taken off and exploded forward, spear outstretched and impaling the creature. I screamed as I charged forward with every ounce of strength I could muster, as well as from the pain.

The back of the creature hit the wall with a thing and the terrible crunch of steel as my spear pierced the wall. I'd impaled it and stuck it to the wall, and after it recovered, the Void tried to take another swipe at me. I had no other choice but to hop back, letting go of the spear. It grabbed the shaft of the spear and attempted to wrench it out of its gut, and as I saw the spear slowly begin to slide out, I dropped to the deck. "NOW!"

Another earsplitting round was fired, the crunching of bone was heard and I could see the Void's legs go limp. I breathed a sigh of relief and allowed myself a moment of rest. The halberd-wielding Hunter moaned weakly from the pain and loss of his eye, even in his passed out state. The other unblooded Hunter ran to him and began trying to administer what first aid he could for the Hunter.

After a moment, I got up and wrenched my spear from the wall and corpse of the Void. "Continue to treat his wounds as best you can. Try to stabilize him, I'll go and try to get a medic." I said, running out of the lab and trying to fish my communicator out of my pocket.

I pulled out the small oblong device and tapped it twice, it chimed. I held it near to my lips and spoke; "Sector clear, sector clear. One researcher gave his life to attract the Voids to one area and protect the rest of the facility." After a moment, the hallway went dark again, and the regular lights came on and the alarm ceased. "Four confirmed casualties," I continued to speak into the small communicator, "One Hunter severely injured, requires immediate medical attention. He is in a critical state and cannot be currently moved."

Shortly after that, a medical squad rendezvoused with me at the intersection where I first encountered the two young Hunters. I lead them back to the research lab and after they stabilized him, I assisted in bring him back to the medical ward. I knew that shortly after these events, the Hunter with the rifle-cannon would be named, and sent on missions as a support-class Hunter, and he'd be a damn fine one at that. If the halberd-wielding Hunter survived, he'd be named and able to take on missions as well. I'd make sure of it.

Towards the end of that day, after being treated for my shoulder wound and putting away my trusty weapon, I decided I'd help with the gathering and burial of the casualties of the day's Void outbreak. After helping gather the body of the researcher who'd sacrificed himself to lure the Voids back to him and given his life so that no others than him and three others would die, I felt he'd deserved more than everybody's respects, he'd deserved honors, and to go down in the memory of everyone at the facility. I told the medical personnel who'd taken him away that I'd like to do a speech in his honor before they buried him, and they agreed to hold off until I got there.

Something strange happened before I left the Slate holding area though. One of the Slates came out into the hallway. He turned his head to look at me, and he smiled. "I am happy you took care of that nasty business, Hunter M." A Slate.. happy? "What are you talking about? You're a Slate, you.. you shouldn't even know how to smile, or what happiness is.." He nodded his head in affirmation and his smile slowly faded to a neutral expression. 
"Well, then, I guess I'm not a Slate. But I'm not a Void either, otherwise I'd be clawing at your throat right now, wouldn't I?" The strange Slate responded.
"Well then what the hell are you? The only thing I know of other than humans that are like you are Slates and Voids.." I said in confusion, dumbstruck by the appearance of this.. entity.
"I suppose I must be something entirely new."

This was the first documented appearance of the Godfeared.

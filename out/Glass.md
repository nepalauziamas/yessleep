I was on a ledge looking down, 50 stories and more. I had no idea at first how I’d gotten there.

Behind me, glass.

It was like I’d gone outside a window of a skyscraper and was out on the ledge. I thought maybe it was one of those buildings where the exteriors were practically all glass.

My mind raced. I tried to remember if I’d been at a party and taken something I shouldn’t have.

The ground, far, far below—it was too dark, too expansive, to be a city street. What appeared to be concrete, but not concrete at all, stretched far and wide. Off in the distant fuzz of shadows and greater dark, there was something like a gigantic railing.

My stomach was heaving all the time. I had a foot or more past the length of my shoes for the ledge. It did not seem like enough.

The ledge appeared to be made of wood, painted white.

When I risked glancing behind me, *through the glass*, there was what I can only describe as an enormous kitchen. The lighting fixture hanging above the table had to be as big as a house. The table itself was several football fields.

But it wasn’t a kitchen blown up, or myself shrunk. It was a kitchen without really being the kind of kitchen we would know, if that makes any sense. These weren’t like the designs you or I might see on Earth. I can’t describe it. Imagine seeing rustic or retro—or any one of our decorating styles—for the very first time. It was a style unlike anything I’d seen.

It made me afraid to glimpse whatever occupied the house. I was worried they might happen to walk into the kitchen, and I was certain whatever it was wouldn’t simply be giant and human.

Closer, something started to move. It was approaching me along the glass. *Sticking* to it. Something big. The vibrations told me it was coming.

My attention whipped to another thing buzzing along in the dark, as loud as an airplane engine. It was flying towards the glass.

It must’ve been attracted to the light.

Abruptly the buzzing was cut off, and right after came a loud, damp squishiness. There was a chomping that came to me as noisily as if it were in my own mouth. It vibrated from the glass into my bones.

About a minute passed. Then the thing *sticking to the glass* was on the move again. It had gotten so close that I could hear the stick and unstick, probably of its feet. The sound was nauseating, as if my vertigo weren’t enough.

It stopped.

I looked around the surface of the glass. Desperately. Then my eyes settled on large bulges above and to the side of me. I hadn’t seen it before because that was not an easy angle for me on that ledge, and because the thing wasn’t exactly lit up by the kitchen light from behind the glass. Better yet, maybe it hadn’t been close enough before.

This thing was the size of a hill with two smaller hills protruding from it. It was like a frog sticking to the glass. But it also *wasn’t*. Its eyes were larger proportionally than a frog’s, the mouth was too wide and curling upwards into a grin that spiraled around the entirety of the snout. What was more, teeth drooped out from the lips. It had teeth in abundance that tilted this way and that, and yet they looked strangely . . . human.

It seemed the creature, whatever it was, had chosen this spot because of light from the kitchen. The light through the glass was attracting . . . insects . . . or something. The frog-thing was sticking to the window in wait, so that it could prey upon them.

Then I remembered having moved toward a light myself. It came back to me. I’d been urban exploring an old subway system underground. There had been a light with no noise, what couldn’t have been a train. I had moved towards that light, cautiously, along the walls of the tunnel.

When the light had gotten really bright, and *hot*, there’d been a sharp crack in my ears and head, like a rifle going off. I think I must’ve lost consciousness.

And then I was here.

Now I was waiting. I waited motionless for hundreds or thousands of heartbeats or so until—

Facing my direction, the frog-thing’s weird mouth opened slightly. Something wet, pink, and round showed. I wondered how far its tongue could stretch. That creature must’ve been at least 200 yards away sticking to the glass, but it really was *big*.

I kept reminding myself that the ledge of wood I was on along the lower exterior of that bizarre kitchen door window was enough room. As long as I leaned backward against the glass, I wouldn’t pitch forward, I told myself.

But even that safety couldn’t be enough. I imagined it, the long pink tongue whipping out lightning fast and sticking me, pulling my skin and muscle and the rest of my body sliding across the glass towards a very large mouth.

I moved sideways as fast as I could. My left foot slipped. I was looking directly down at my shoe hanging over the plunge. I leaned more against the glass, but it was too suddenly. My back started to slide down, squeaking like a dishcloth; my hips moved forward on their own.

Frantic, I lowered my centered of gravity, ground both shoes into the ledge, and squatted.

My heart was beating too fast. My vision got a little dark before returning. I was on the verge off passing out.

The large creature stirred.

I edged along, sure there was no way I could outpace it, or its tongue, until my left hand scraped along a groove.

It was a crack in the glass.

Something slapped next to me, hard, out of nowhere. I shook in place, screaming, doing all I could to keep my balance. I heard a slurping, slipping noise as it dragged itself away. The tongue. It had struck and missed.

I shuffled like mad closer to the crack. It was big, because the window I was edging along was massive, but I didn’t know at first if I could fit into it.

That would only be a temporary escape, if it *was* big enough, but anything seemed better than letting myself be eaten by that frog creature.

I tried first an arm. Success. Then my shoulder, success, but my torso got stuck in the crack.

Something slammed into my other arm, huge and wet and terrible. It ripped my skin off like an old band aid. I screamed, struggling, moving myself in jerks. Trying to get deeper into the crack. The glass tore at my clothes and pulled additional skin away. I was bleeding in more places than I could tell.

Then one big push, with lots of pain, and I was into the crack.

I’d been getting ready to wait out my death sentence, but immediately I fell back into the tunnel. I was in that old subway system again. The light at the end of the tunnel receded to a pinprick. Vanished. It was just myself, the glow of my flashlight on the ground, and my backpack with gear. And a whole lot of pain and blood.

It’s the kind of experience that I’ll never get past. It should not have happened. Oh, I’d like nothing more than to pretend it was me falling and hitting my head. The problem with that is the injuries. Medical records don’t lie.

I’ve been reading a lot about parallel universes and such. I’m postulating here, but I wonder if some chemical in the glass—or maybe a cleaning agent used on it—charged that gigantic kitchen door window somehow, making a portal. Maybe you had to be *inside* the glass to access it. I wonder about that concussive rifle noise I thought I heard while approaching the light. Sometimes it reminds me of a glacier breaking, though I’d never heard such a thing before, or of a gigantic piece of glass cracking as it touched our world.

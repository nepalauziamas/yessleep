This story I've heard from my dad. When my dad was in grade 11/12, he heard it from the victim of this story. It happened a long time ago in a Bangladeshi village.

Let's call the victim X. X was in his thirties, well built, very strong & well known in his village. He was a very good wrestler (kustigir) & the best in his village. One summer day he was in his family owned chickpeas field guarding those harvest from the crop thieves. He was there all day & planned to stay there all night. Anyway, night came. He had taken some foods with him but he already ate those for his lunch. And it felt like a long time ago & he became extremely hungry. His cousin (let's call him Y, was a 4/5th grader) was supposed to bring him food in the afternoon/evening but it's already night time & there was no sign of him. It was haat baar (in the village areas, there are 2/3 days reserved for haat bar where sellers from many areas bring a lot of different items including foods/garments/toys etc to sell. Haat bar is normally a very busy day for the villagers, kinda like a mini fair). Anyway, X then became literally hangry. He was staying inside the hut which had a barely lit lamp. He suddenly noticed that someone was coming towards his hut. He asked if that person is Y bcause it's already dark outside & hard to see. Y came near & replied hmmm. X then asked if Y brought foods with him. Y again said hmm. Then Y said very rudely that he wanna wrestle with X. X then became furious. All he wanted was his dinner & this kid Y wants to wrestle with him now! X said first dinner then other things. X told Y' "Bring your 2 elder brothers & I would fight against those two. I don't have time to wrestle with a kid." But Y heavily insisted. He would wrestle with X and wouldn't take no for an answer. X said he would slap the shit outta Y but Y was very determined. X finally agreed & the wrestling match began.

X & Y were wrestling & X noticed that Y was quite strong. But he thought Y was still a kid so no biggie. X then noticed that Y's body was different. He was hairy & bad odor was emitting from his body. Whatever! X wouldn't back down & continued fighting. They were both strong & evenly matched and the match continued. One time X almost won, other time Y. X had enough & wanted to slam Y hard by holding Y's legs. He caught Y's one leg & then noticed that he couldn't find the other leg, Y didn't have the other leg! Then he realized everything. That Y was not the real Y. It's not even human, it's a Pishach/Pishachas (supernatural entity, in Islamic belief, they are lower groups of djinns, has bad odor & normally lives in dirty places). He lost all his will and strength to fight. He became scared sh*t. Fake Y then punched & slammed him hard. All was lost but suddenly X saw a bright light. A well lit hurricane lamp was coming towards them. Fake Y let him go & said in a deep horrendous voice that he actually planned to kill X & wanted to show him who was the powerhouse but fate interrupted & he then vanished. 

After that, X saw that it was Y, the real Y. X was angry at Y. Y said because of the haat bar, he was at the haat bazaar. That's why he was late. And when he was coming towards X's hut, he heard a lot of noises coming from there & saw someone was fighting someone. He thought X caught a thief & was probably beating them. The places where X & fake Y were wrestling, was literally demolished. X was heavily injured & collapsed. After the whole thing, X became ill. After getting better, he unfortunately never got his previous strength back. He became skinny. As I already mentioned, he was well known for his body & strength. But when my dad saw him after that incident, he looked like a ghost of his former self. He then told what happened to him. And that's the story.

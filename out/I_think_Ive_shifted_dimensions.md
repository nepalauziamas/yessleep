Have you ever heard of those stories about scientists who can travel through dimensions and meet another version of themselves? 
Well I don't think the story that will follow is so much so but sure. It also may seem confusing since I don't think I have the right words to explain it.

Firstly I want to say that I've always been very fascinated by the concept of dreams, time traveling, space shifting, even tho the people around me would constantly tell me that those are just interesting stories to put kids to sleep.
I also don't do very well in school and I am a fairly lazy person so when I found out about the possibilities of "lucid dreaming" I just had to try it. 

For months I would learn to control my dreams , I would start with something simple, like dreaming that I'm taking my dogs for a walk until I could change the directions at will. Then I would imagine dialogues with my friends where I could control what they're saying , this went on for months and there were times when I would sleep up to 16 hours per day. My mom became worried but I told her not to , that i was just extra tired from school. I didn't tell her about the lucid dreaming part because she told me numerous time about how dangerous dreams are, but I didn't believe it. 
What bad could happen? It's like living a second Life honestly. The life I always wanted, I am the popular and pretty girl at school I get perfect grades and I get laid every night , what's so scary about that?

Well that week felt weird... Everything seemed unreal around me even after a woke up, like I was hallucinating even tho I was wide awake. And when time came that I would to to sleep just couldn't... I've never had insomnia before and sure as hell it was tiring. For the next 3 days it would be like this, I've already started to miss my second Life.
On the fourth day tho the second I put my head on the pillow it's like my body  fainted . I could see around me but I couldn't move, at first I thought it would be my first experience with those sleep paralysis demons but in five minutes was off to sleep.

I was so happy I could finally dream but when I tried to move..I couldn't I thought that the days I haven't been sleeping caused this but then I woke up, no, not in real life, in the dream. 

I was dreaming that I was laying down suddenly I woke up to my alarm clock, then a person came into my room, it would have been obviously my mom since she's the only other person in the house.
Wait..

Is that me?


It was the longest dream I've ever had. 

It lasted years.

No, not dream, nightmare. The worst nightmare.

It was my like my life but better in some ways and horrible in others. Firstly my mom and dad never divorced and my twin sister never died at birth. I got better grades and I had more friends. Life outside my home was actually very good, school was easy and everyone loved me. But when i came home it was a different story. 

My "family" was weird.

My mom's job wasn't at a bank anymore, she was a scientist working for the government. My dad was an engineer also working for them. I almost didn't believe it at first until they showed me their labs in the basement.
I looked the same, with the face of my mom but the color palate of dad, my sister the opposite. 
My mom and dad were always busy with their jobs and I was all alone with my sister.

I've always wondered how it is to have a sibling.
Well mine wasn't normal. 
I don't know how to express this...it's like she wasn't human, I mean she could walk talk eat and everything but there were moments when she was umm gliching.. if I can call it that...
One time she fell down the stares really bad , I wasn't in the kitchen and saw how when she fell her hand moved in a very weird abnormal way, I was terrified and wanted to ran to her an call and ambulance but her face stopped me.
It's like she didn't fell the paint at all, her face was blank and her eyes lifeless and with a fast movement her hand went back to normal.

From that day on I got a weird sensation from her, I started analysing her much closer. 

She was not human. 


Her skin was unnaturally white and it doesn't matter how close I looked I couldn't spot her pores or body hair not even veins. I lived in a house with that think for years, her hair and nails never grow, she doesn't sweat, is too fast and strong,her eyes are abnormally big and I've ever seen anyone eat so much so fast with out puking. 
I was also the only one in the house not allowed in the basement.


Everything fells so real I barely remember my old life anymore-
What the hell is going on?! I've tried telling my parents but to no avail it's like they ignore how weird she is.. since I told them I catch her staring at me from behind the corners from time to time, I've also never seen her sleep so I feel her stare every night since we share a room.




I have a suspicion but I have to be sure I need to go into the basement, I think I'll do it tonight, yes , my family is visiting grandma  maybe I can act sick and stay home.

But still, this is all a dream right? I just have to wait and wake up right? This feels to real...I am starting to forget my first life please sent help I will never dream again please..




I promise...

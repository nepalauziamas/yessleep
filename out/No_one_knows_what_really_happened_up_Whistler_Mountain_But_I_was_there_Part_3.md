[[Part 1]](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/wzqzy7/no_one_knows_what_really_happened_up_whistler/) -- Three bodies found in a remote log cabin, a gun lying beside them that hadn’t been fired. The police, the courts, the local media, all baffled. **But I was there.**

[[Part 2]](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/x1g44c/no_one_knows_what_really_happened_up_whistler/?) -- Where the killer weaved their twisted web.

Every creaking floorboard, every rustling leaf. I wonder if it’s the killer. Have they found me again?

The fear weakens my hold on this vessel. She will win the battle for control soon. But I have to share what I heard, what I saw.

*

They were still talking in the forest, sitting on their tree stumps. I was there too, not that they could see me.

Rose: "Millions? There are millions of dollars at stake tonight? How … because of what’s in the van?"

Chopper: "I ain’t tellin’ you that, Rose. The less you know the safer you are. From me and from others."

She took a deep breath and looked Chopper in the eye.

Rose: "I don’t believe you have it in you to hurt me, Chopper. I don’t think you’re a bad person. I think you’re a good person that lost his way."

Chopper said nothing to that.

Rose: "Is that gun even loaded?"

Chopper: "… No …"

Rose: "Chopper, let’s stop this stupid hostage pretence so I can help you. Tell me, what’s in the van?"

Chopper: "I can't, Rose."

Rose: "Well you can at least tell me what’s gone wrong because something obviously has. Why else would you need to invade a holiday cabin you only just found out about? Why don’t you start by explaining the problem that forced you to come up here?"

Chopper: "You won't be able to help, Rose."

Rose: "You won’t know that until you tell me. And even if I can’t help, talking a problem over with someone, that can be helpful in its own right."

Chopper was silent.

Rose: "Come on, Chopper. Let me help you. Tell me what’s going on."

Chopper: "Aww heck. I’m collecting two halves of a single shipment. Once I have them both my job is to deliver them to a buyer."

Rose: "And this shipment is what’s in the van?"

Chopper: "No, that’s the problem. I only have one half of the shipment. Where I was parked up when you called, I was waiting there for another driver to arrive with the second half of the shipment so we could load it into my minivan."

Rose: "But he never arrived?"

Chopper: "That’s right. It was way past time when you called over the CB. I was worried something had happened to the other driver, so I was tryna come up with a new plan. Word spreads. If someone worse than the likes of me had got to the other driver, or the cops had caught up with him, they might be coming for me next. But you said your cabin was secluded and hidden. A good place for me to lie low and figure out my next move."

Rose: "And have you figured it out?"

Chopper: "No."

Rose: "Then let's work it out together. Why can’t you just drive to the buyer? Explain that the other guy never turned up with the second half of the shipment?"

Chopper: "Rose, the people in my line of work, you don’t just turn up with only half of what they’re expecting. It wouldn’t end well for me."

Rose: "Okay, is there any way you can track down the second half of the shipment? Contact someone else involved to see what happened to the other driver?"

Chopper: "It don’t work like that. We’re all independent and there are certain steps involved to keep the buyer separate from the heist."

Rose: "The shipment came from a heist?"

Chopper: "Heck, I really don’t—"

Rose: "We want the same thing, Chopper. You want to figure this out and be on your way, I want that too. Let’s get you your money so you can leave and be with Lori."

Chopper: "You – you really want to help me?"

Rose: "Yes. And if you tell me everything, I might just be able to."

Chopper nodded.

Chopper: "Heist was a museum bust. Van is full of paintings, gemstones, stuff like that. When he got nearby the other driver was supposed to call for ‘Chopper’ over the CB, say he’d come from the ‘Blue Hen State’. I had to answer ‘Never been but I hear the burgers are great.’"

Rose: "Then what?"

Chopper: "Then we were supposed to meet up and load his half of the merchandise into my van. After that, I was supposed to drive the full shipment to the buyer and collect payment."

Rose: "And who is the buyer? Where are they?"

Chopper: "I don’t know the buyer’s real name. Alias is ‘Thane’. I was supposed to deliver the shipment to him by noon tomorrow; an abandoned airfield forty miles up the interstate."

Rose: "Okay, so we still have plenty of time. It’s not even midnight. But we won’t solve anything by sitting out here. We need to go back to the cabin. We should be by the radio in case the other driver calls. He might have been held up, he might be calling for you right now."

Chopper: "But Michael …"

Rose: "Don’t worry about Michael. When he comes back I’ll explain everything to him. I want to help you, I want to help you get back to Lori."

Chopper: "I …"

Rose: "Just promise me you’ll head straight to Lori when this is all over. Promise me that you’ll tell her you’re sorry and that you’re going straight for good."

Chopper: "You got yourself a deal, ma’am. I promise."

Rose: "Let’s get back to the cabin. We’ll check the radio and go from there."

And with that they headed back towards the cabin. A final, terrible mistake.

The cabin was exactly as they left it.

Chopper: "Is the cabin door unlocked?"

Rose: "Yep."

Chopper walked in and sniffed the air.

Chopper: "Funny smell in here."

Rose: "It’s an old place. The radio room is just past the bookshelf, first door on the right."

Chopper stepped into the radio room, and his jaw dropped.

Chopper: "What in God’s name?"

Behind him, the click of a gun’s hammer.

Rose: "You’re a rank amateur, Chopper. Safe to say the gun I stashed behind the Bible is definitely loaded."

Chopper: "Who – who are these dead people?"

Chopper was pointing at my corpse, at Michael’s corpse right beside it. 

Fake Rose: "The couple that were holidaying when I got here, the real Rose and Michael."

Chopper: "But – but you said—"

Fake Rose: "I said I was a poor, lovesick tourist. And you fell for it."

Chopper: "But why would you lie to me?"

Fake Rose: "Because the other driver died before I could get everything I needed to know out of him."

Chopper: "You killed the other driver?"

Fake Rose: "Sooner than I wanted to. The fat idiot bled out before he could tell me exactly where and when he was meeting you, never told me the buyer’s name and location either. He did manage to tell me that you were called Chopper though. You might be interested to know that his last words were ‘*Chopper … radio waves … Whistler Mountain*’. Whistler Mountain is a big place but he had a CB radio with him. I knew coming here and searching for ‘Chopper’ over the airwaves was my best chance of finding you."

Chopper: "But why would you kill the real Rose and Michael?"

Fake Rose: "I needed a way to lure you to me. I knew when your contact didn’t turn up that you’d be panicking, so I looked for a likely safehouse around Whistler Mountain. Waving a secluded cabin in front of you was a sure-fire way to entice you in. Men so often lack the imagination to come up with anything beyond what’s put on a plate in front of them. I’m not complaining though. Now I have both shipments, the name and location of the buyer, even a delivery van."

Chopper: "But everything we talked about … Lori …"

Fake Rose: "Lori is better off without you, Chopper. Surely after tonight’s incompetence that’s obvious?"

Chopper: "No, please …"

Fake Rose: "Over and out, Chopper."

The woman pretending to be me fired, Chopper crumpled to the floor.

Then the woman took the van and fled.

And that's how I ended up dead in a log cabin between the corpses of my fiancé and a man I'd never met.

They say the dead linger when they have unfinished business. They took my body away, but my essence remained. The police, local reporters, even kids looking for cheap thrills; all of them came and went, but I remained trapped on this mountain for years. I wanted the world to know what had happened, but I had no voice, no form.

Then came the girl. A True Crime obsessive, she was attracted to the cabin by the grizzly tales circulating the nearby towns. She has the Gift, the Sight, just like I did growing up. I pounced.

I'll release my vessel soon. After I've burned the cabin to the ground, of course. No need for me to linger, I feel my passing coming on. Like a heavy fever finally lifting.

My only regret, that evil woman is still out there.

And she has my name.

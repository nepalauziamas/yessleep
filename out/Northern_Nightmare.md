I look at my compass, it keeps spinning and spinning, the magnetic pull in the area must be too strong. I look at my 3 friends, 2 were playing in the misty water, the other reading a book. I sit down and open my backpack, pulling out my phone, it won’t turn on. I try my flashlight and radio, but they don’t work either.

I continue to dig through my bag, trying to find something to help us. I see a bright light in the corner of my eye, and hear the screams of 2 of my friends. I jump up and turn towards the beach, their bodies float above the water. I run down, getting close to the water. My other friend yells, “DON’T TOUCH THE WATER!!”

I stop, and look back at my friend, wait what!? I look down and see his body lay where I had heard him just warn me. I look around, it’s getting darker. I run back to my backpack grabbing my flashlight, quickly remembering nothing works. I hug my backpack close in pure confusion, hoping this will end. It’s pitch black and I can no longer feel the grass below me. 

Suddenly a light appears, I stare at it. It starts circling around me. It becomes a figure, tall, skinny, long arms. I just stare petrified as it stands in front of me, the light now a dim gray. It bends down, then snatches my hand. I scream, but I don’t hear it.

A giant compass appears in front of me, spinning like mine from earlier. I try to touch it, it’s just a hologram. The compass becomes solid before I had time to take my hand out. I look around me, my hand now stuck in this compass. 

I see several small lights in the distance, getting closer. I try to run from the lights, but I can’t free my hand. I see the pointer on the compass, now moving slow, coming toward my hand. Even at its slow speed, it’ll chop off my hand! I tug away, still failing to get my hand out. I remember I still have my flashlight in my left hand. I put the flashlight to the side of my right hand to try and save myself. When the giant pointer hits the flashlight it short circuits and my hand is thrown out!

I look back at the lights, their about 10 meters away now, I swing my backpack over my shoulder and start running. I look back but the lights aren’t getting any farther away, infact, their getting closer! I trip on myself, my elbow hit the ground, CRACK! I try to get up, but my right arm is in intense pain. I watch the lights get closer, I can’t just sit around! I hold my right arm, and get myself back on my feet. 

I start running, the searing pain in my arm getting worse with every step. I slow to a walk and look back behind me. The Light! It touches me, I blink, and I’m back on the hill. I hear humming, fog surrounds me. I look down at my arm, I can’t do anything about it right now.

I walk to the edge of the cliff where the beach and water was earlier. The humming gets louder. I look down, if I jump, will I survive? I’ve already broken my arm, I don’t want to lose my life too. I grab a rock and throw it over the edge, I hear it softly hit the sand. I cautiously jump down, giving a sigh of relief when my feet hit the sand.

I walk a few steps, and I nearly trip over something. I look down, right there lay my best friends body! I look closer, there’s a huge hole where his heart should be. I look at my hands, there’s dry blood all over them. He was laying right next to the water, I look into the water, my Flashlight!

It had definitely short circuited, but it was floating in the water. I reach down to grab it, but a hand touched mine, I immediately freaked out! I looked farther down the arm, there my other 2 friends floated dead in the water. 

“None of this makes sense..” I whisper as a tear runs down my face. I hear police sirens, someone touches my shoulder, but I shake off his grip. There’s so much noise, but I can’t make out any of it. Everything goes black.

I wake up in a bed, a bunch of machines hooked up to me. I try to ask a nurse what’s going on, but she doesn’t answer, she just exits the room. I take a moment to just think for a second. The hole in my friend, the flashlight in the water. It hits me. “I killed them, didn’t I!?” I yell out.

It’s been a month, and everyones still denying my theory, but I was the only one there that evening. If anyone knows what happened that night, it’s me.

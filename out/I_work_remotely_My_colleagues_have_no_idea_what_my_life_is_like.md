 I work for a small, fully remote marketing consultancy. There’s nine of us in all. We help people sell things online; bottles of kombucha, jogging pants, customized neck pillows. The kind of stuff where 90% of the value comes from how it’s sold. A lot of my job is writing. There’s emails, pitches, copywriting, reports to explain the changes to the copywriting, powerpoints with big wedges of text and dense bullet points. 

I applied for the job with a false CV. Seven years working as a chef after high school, then a degree in marketing, one year interning at Proctor and Gamble, three years with Nestle in their branding department. I never felt bad for lying. The truth is, anyone can do a job like mine. All you have to do is string a sentence together and smile in a meeting.

We’re a small team and we spend a lot of time talking to each other. Over texts, in the morning standups. Personal stuff inevitably comes up. My colleagues think I’m married to a woman named Heather and that I have a three year old named Cole. We all live in a three bedroom Victorian house not far from a park. I’ve told them I’m into hiking, indie music, expensive beer, and DIY. My parents are both alive and live in the next city over, and I have a baby sister in Canada, who’s kind of a wild child. Sometimes I have to bail her out of trouble. Most of the time when we talk about weekend plans it’ll be me taking Cole out for some kind of activity or sneaking off for a date with my partner. 

Those are all lies. The truth is, I spend almost all my free time digging a hole.

I’ve been digging the hole for eight months now. It’s in my yard. It’s about two meters wide and several yards deep. There’s a simple pulley system with a big rubber bucket that I use to empty out the dirt. When the bucket is full I pull the rubber handles together and attach it to a carabiner which is tied to the rope by a figure eight knot, and then I haul it up. At the top of the pulley the rope runs through a device which locks when it’s weighted on one end. That’s what keeps the bucket from falling. Once it’s at the top I climb up and empty the bucket. Then I lower it and start again.

My hole is a few yards deep now, so I use a ladder I bought on facebook marketplace to get to the bottom. Digging is tougher than it was at the start. I don’t use electric tools which makes rock a challenge. All I have is a shovel and a pick. It's slow going. Whenever I get discouraged I think about those guys in alcatraz digging through the concrete with paperclips or whatever. Or chinese water torture, where all these little drips slowly make a tunnel in somebody’s skull and kills them. That’s what I am to my yard, in my mind. I’m a drop of water falling again and again. I start digging as soon as I clock off, and when I get too tired to dig any more I go inside and get drunk. While I drink I watch YouTube videos, long ones about random stuff, and eat cold ready meals. I don’t have any kitchenware aside from a kettle. 

The thing about alcohol is that you need more as time goes on. It’s like all drugs in that way I guess. I used to drink strong cider but lately I’ve moved on to rum. That’s the least nasty-tasting spirit I think. With ice it’s about okay. And I can have maybe four or five shots of that and it’s enough for me to sleep untill my alarm clock wakes me up at 08:50 and I log on to slack. 

I pay a woman I’ve never met $150 to rent this place. I also pay for premium wifi, 910Mbps download speed. Food is ordered in weekly online.  All in all my expenses come to less then $400 a month. My job pays $2500 a month after tax. The money just sits in my account.

The house is very bare. For some reason the front door is nailed shut so the only way in is to slip around, past the empty lot next door and go through the yard. There’s a wire fence I keep padlocked but nobody ever bothers me. This part of town is too empty to be dangerous. On video calls I have to blur the background, or else there would be questions. The walls are unpainted and there’s a fair bit of exposed wiring. One time I forgot to add blur while on a Zoom call with our designer Laura. I told her we were getting some renovations done. My house is a fixer-upper, I said, AKA a craphole. But who can aford to buy a decent house these days? She laughed. Laura's always laughing.

At first my backstory was pretty basic, but I got into it more over time, adding little details. Me and Heather got married impulsively and settled on a dorky double barrelled name, Glenn-Richmond. My coworkers tease me that I sound like an aristocrat. I use google to keep track of what Cole should be doing, reading about normal behaviors for a toddler of his age. He throws tantrums now, runs up and down the stairs screaming. My boss Rob has kids, so he can sympathize. He offers me tips.

Ever since I joined at the start of the year we’ve been chatting about doing a company meet up. I figured it was just one of those things people just talk about, but a couple weeks ago they actually booked it in. Dinner for nine at a hotel in the city. They asked if I could come and I said yes without thinking. Heather had painting class that night, but it was cool. I could hire a babysitter. 

The supermarket where I get my food does clothes as well, so I ordered jeans and a button up shirt. There’s no shower here so I just padded down with a wet cloth and some dish soap, then put on the new clothes, which just about fit. The bus ride was two and a half hours. I stared out the window.

It wasn’t too weird. The conversation didn’t flow as easily as it does online, but it never felt awkward. Everyone got a bit drunk. They teased me more about the surname. Laura kissed me on the cheek. Rob asked if he could see a picture of Cole, so I scrolled a couple pages deep into google images and showed him a smiling toddler in a bathtub. He said Cole has my nose. 

When I got home I was in a bit of a daze. Overwhelmed, I guess. It was nearly dawn. My body couldn’t process all the new stuff it had seen after so many months of the same routine. I came in through the back gate and stepped right into the open hole. 

If the hole was wider it might not have been so bad. I could have turned and landed on my side. But it funneled me down and the first thing to hit the bottom was my feet.  

I knew it was a bad fall, and for a while I was too scared to look. I lay there breathing through my teeth, eyes closed. When I finally looked I saw my shin bone was poking out the top of my thigh. Then I went to sleep for a bit. After my sleep I had enough energy to try and climb out, but the pain got worse every time I tried to move. It took the rest of the night to drag myself out of there.

Sunday happened after. I don’t remember what I did. Then Monday morning came, last Monday. I told them my webcam is broken and I can only do voice calls. I don’t know what I look like, but it’s probably bad enough to raise the alarm. Even speaking is tough. I’m struggling to sound normal. I’ve told them Cole is keeping me awake and I’m tired and a bit sick. 

It’s Thursday now and I keep slipping in and out. I haven't gotten up from my desk in four days. The pain comes in waves. The leg sticks underneath the table like a dead thing. My colleagues keeping urging me to take time off, but I can’t do it. Without digging this is all I have. I guess it's all I've had for a while. I just want to be part of the team. I want to do a good job. Nobody is going to find me here, but that’s okay. I don’t want to be found.

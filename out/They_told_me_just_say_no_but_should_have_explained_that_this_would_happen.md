“Just fucking show it to me.” My voice trembled, but *not* knowing was worse.

The two men in white lab coats looked at each other. Their faces matched their attire.

Then one of them started the recording.

My face laughed into the camera, a glob of drool dangling from my lower lip. “The schnozzberries taste like… *schnozzberries!*” I squealed before ripping off peals of raucous laughter. “Ooo-oooh,” I cooed, mouth in a wide circle as I gazed at what was in my hand.

“No,” I whispered.

The recorded version of me lifted a hunting knife and stared at it hungrily.

“*No*,” I breathed, barely audible.

The camera turned to face the man holding it. A hollow-cheeked man with sallow skin, round spectacles, and no hair grinned back.

“Not him,” I choked, waves of fear and vomit clutching my stomach. “Oh God, please say he didn’t operate on me.”

On camera, I stuck the knife into my mouth. Then I pressed against the inside of my cheek, the point protruding beneath my skin and I forced it outward. With a burst of blood, the knife tip poked through. I slid it toward my lips, my cheek tearing open like the film on old pudding. Red flesh blossomed beneath as I ran a straight line to my mouth, ripping through the lips. A flap of skin flopped down like cold cuts, revealing clean, white teeth over exposed gums.

I watched as I moved the blade to my nose. Slicing through one nostril, I exposed rubbery cartilage to the world. With swift strokes, I diced my left side. It looked like chunks of heirloom mushroom as it crumbled out of sight. My right nostril went the same way, disappearing into bite-sized pieces. 

“This is why-” gasped one of the doctors, “it is very ill-advised to mix lysergic acid diethylamide – ah, ‘LSD,’ that is – with psilocybin mushrooms, especially while under the effects of cocaine.”

No one said another word as we all focused on the monitor.

The image of me on screen pressed the blade onto the bridge of my nose and pushed. The shaking in my arm made very clear just how hard I was working as I pressed the weapon through my nose like it was a Christmas ham. With a gentle sawing motion, I worked my way through the entire appendage. I was rewarded with a  *clunk* as it fell off my face.

I watched, horrified, as I popped the nose into my mouth and chewed, rolling it over my tongue in delight. It was both soft and crunchy; I heard the distinct sound of my incisors cracking as my jaw worked its magic.

After that was done, I stuck out my tongue.

The tongue is mostly muscle on the inside. The first layers are pinkish, but so many blood vessels were ruptured after a few strokes that I could only see a brownish-purple cross section.

When I was done, I held the severed tongue in my hand. It twitched like a dying fish.

Then I flung it across the room.

“We never did find the tongue,” the second doctor confessed.

My ears were next. Have you ever cut through a stick of butter? There’s just enough resistance to give a satisfying feeling at the end when the greasy knife slides a final time and pops through the other side.

That’s exactly what it’s like to watch your ear get cut off. 

My left ear wasn’t as clean, because I’m right-handed. I laughed when the knife accidentally ran through my ear, only severing the top half. My cheek flap jiggled as I giggled. My teeth were exposed. 

Then I grabbed my eyelid. You can pull them back from your cornea with a satisfying little *pop* sound. Do it right now. I promise it’s safe.

Sliding the blade into the gap, I pressed upward.

It is so fucking odd to see a knife poking out from the inside of your eyelid.

I swiped both eyelids out and placed them into my mouth. It seemed that I was trying to chew them, but with no tongue, it was a bloody failure.

Eventually, they dripped out of my exposed cheek. 

I didn’t seem to notice. 

I took each eyebrow off with a single swipe, cutting off the underlying flesh and leaving a raw, exposed, red space that looked like my gums. The removed brows had the appearance of furry caterpillars. I rubbed them lovingly against my lone intact cheek.

“Please tell me this is the end,” I croaked. 

It wasn’t the end. Hovering the tip above my right eye, my hand was uncharacteristically steady.

“No,” I whispered.

The vitreous humor is a clear, colorless fluid. I learned this as I watched the knife tip pressing against my pupil, praying that each semi-second was the last, always disappointed. My eyeball bent like a squeezed water balloon, receding greatly before the final pop. Fluid leaked down my intact cheek, dripping with a viscosity somewhere between water and Jell-O. It shook has I laughed.

“Is this why you only unbandaged one eye, but left the rest of my face wrapped up?” I asked, my voice shaking.

The robed men looked at each other in fear.

“He’s been chasing me for years. I swore to myself that he would never find me. I’ve been running from fear nonstop, but he finally…” My empty socket burned as it struggled fruitlessly to make tears. “I regret asking to see this. I’m done. Please, just leave me alone,” I heaved, too damaged even to cry properly.

The second man took a deep breath before speaking.

“Does this mean you don’t want to watch the twenty-minute segment on what you did to [your genitals](https://www.facebook.com/P-F-McGrail-181784199029462/)?”

A Note From The Man Who Lived in my Attic


I was moving out of my garage when I found an envelope on top one of the boxes that I was going to pick up and going to move to my UHaul truck and the note read:

Hello I’m not going to give you my name but I will tell you what I do. I live inside your attic and after all 5 years of me living in your attic you have never found me. I have been watching you and observing everything that you have done the last few years. I have learned a lot about you like your daily routine and your habits that you have. Like for example as soon as you wake up you take a shower, then you get dressed, then you brush your teeth, then you eat breakfast (which doesn’t make any sense to me) but still I know that you do it. That’s just the first steps of your daily routine that you do every morning. 

Aside from watching your every move I have also taken very good care of you (Did you know that you have left the stove on 5 different times when you have left the house?) Every Time you have left the stove on and then you left I have always turned it off for you. Did you ever notice that your food has never expired? That's because of me. Every time you go out I check the house for things that need to be taken care of everytime a item of food or drink goes missing I replace it for you. Did you also notice that all of your clothes are clean and that they are always folded and put away. That was because of me. Notice how every time you “think” you forgot something like doing the dishes before you go to bed. I did them while you were sound asleep. I do all of these things.

Like I said, I take very good care of you. After watching you all of these years and watching you become dependent on me taking care of you has made me sad to see you go. So goodbye 

Sincerely, The Man Who Lived in Your Attic

Readind this honestly shocked me to me core because this was the creepiest thing I had ever read because. He was watching my every move. Thank god I was moving because he was watching my every move and supposedly taking care of me. 

Then I flipped the note over and there was a P.S.. The P.S note read:

P.S I also wanted to tell you that I will be kepping me eye on you. I will try my best to still take care of you.

When I read this I was terrified because I didn’t know if he was watching right now or if  we will follow me to my new house and just the thought of that terrified me. So yeah I’m scared and I mean am I the one to blame? Or would you be scared too?

*“That story wasn’t even a little bit scary Jason.”* 

Anne sighed disappointingly as she held her knees to her chest, she was smirking at me whilst sitting atop her pink duvet.

*“****Can you just shut up and go to sleep****?”* I responded frustratedly, my attempts to scare my sister into obedience had failed yet again.

She’s only 9.

I know, *“How hard could it be to scare a 9 year old?”*

Anne was that little girl who always had an answer for everything. A developing quirk in which I’ve grown to despise. 

I grumble about it but I should’ve learnt my lesson by now. Anne had grown up sharper than most kids her age as she quickly became something of a rational thinker. 

I remember when she was 4, and my childish attempts to scare her, it was purely for my own amusement. It never worked. It was like she had always known that there was no such thing as monsters that hid under the bed or within her wardrobe. 

She easily saw through my futile attempts whilst I was always left feeling more and more inferior. At 6 years old Anne could effortlessly convert my ghosts and ghouls back into whatever they really were. Just a few boxes, clothes and old toys.

But for all her back-chat and ever increasing IQ I had an ace up my sleeve. 

*I was older.*

I’ve not long turned 15. This meant that when our parents were out for the night which they often were, it was me who was in charge. It was ***ME*** who had the final say.

**“*****I don’t want to have to come up here again!*****”**

I raised my voice whilst attempting to imitate our father, however my own delivery didn’t generate the same effect or response. I didn’t allow Anne a chance to say another word, I knew very well just how much she loved to get the last word in. I guess it must’ve made her feel like she’d won that particular argument or something. 

I wanted to snub out her idea of victory so I quickly flicked off her bedroom light. Making a swift exit before pulling the door closed behind me. 

“Goodnight.” I spoke without affection.

I didn’t feel bad about it either as she’d been a pain in the ass all day. By this point I had just about enough of her behaviour.

These babysitting duties have started to really grind me down, it’s not like my parents couldn’t afford a professional. They just stuck with the easiest option whilst saving themselves a few extra pennies in the process. After all, they knew I had nowhere else to be on a school night.

*“Try harder next time ok?!”* I heard Anne yell sarcastically after me though her voice was muffled by the door. Much to my annoyance she’d claimed the last word after all.

*“Stupid kid.”* I muttered through gritted teeth as I headed back downstairs. 

On the way down I gave myself a good mental kicking. Why am I so crap at telling scary stories? An old memory then sparked up from when I was a kid, I remembered the many weekends away camping we had as a family. 

Walking down those stairs was like walking down memory lane for me. The first few old pictures at the top were of just the three of us long before Anne arrived. I took the time to observe each one individually as they hung in wooden frames along the stairwell. 

A feeling of sadness and longing for better times stabbed at my heart. Everything seemed so much simpler back then I thought, as I continued to explore my memory bank. I could recall our Father’s kind smile, but that’s now been extracted and replaced with a foul temperament. I’ve put the blame for years on his bank job and it’s got progressively worse since he had that big promotion. 

My eyes then glazed over a singular, beautiful photo of my Mother. Back then she had all the time in the world for me but now seemingly only has eyes for Anne.

I stopped at the bottom step as my gaze was drawn to a picture of the three of us around a campfire. Father must’ve taken this photo as he wasn’t sitting huddled with us. I think I was around 8 at the time which made Anne 2. 

It then dawned on me that I tried telling my first ever scary story that night, though it ended up falling short of the mark. This should’ve been a sure sign for me to quit then and there but I never did. I could feel myself frowning as the stern voice of my father replayed itself in my head:

*“The ending of that story was as soft as the marshmallows we’re toasting Jason.”*

I exhaled as I slid a heel off the bottom step before making my way into the living room.

***“I’ll show them.”*** I thought to myself as I angrily skipped through the television channels whilst my teenage mind swarmed with emotions. I claimed a shallow victory in stuffing my face with mine and Anne’s left over pizza. 

*“I’ll think of something Anne, just you wait.”* Making a promise to myself.

In the morning breakfast came and went much like it usually did. I hated sitting at the table whilst having to listen to my father comment about the rising stock shares or how overcast the weather looked that day. Or watch as my mother fussed with Anne’s breakfast as she’d take that extra special care in arranging the fruit on her smiling pancakes. 

Then there was me hastily shovelling a bowl of frosted flakes into my mouth, I wanted to be on my way just that little bit sooner. I tried to ignore the subtle aggravations of my sister as she went above and beyond to get my attention from across the table. I managed to obscure her annoying face behind my cereal box but it was the flicking of her legs as she tried to kick me from under the table that prompted me to snap at her. 

*"Stop that!"*

My parents paid little mind to this as my father continued to read his broadsheet newspaper whilst mother now started on the dishes. Anne was simply immune to any punishment as she rarely did anything wrong in their eyes. 

*“She’s a sweetheart, leave her alone Jason.”* or “*Stop picking on your sister, Jason…*” 

To top it all off it was my job to walk Anne to her school but I always made sure to keep a few paces ahead of her. I was thankful that our schools weren’t far, perhaps a 10 minute walk at most. Our neighbourhood was close to them both although we had to walk by a couple of fields that were visible from the back of our house. Beyond that was a large forested area that linked to a neighbouring town a couple of mile or so over. 

Despite giving me grief all morning Anne still waved me off as she skipped merrily through her school gates. She seemed content in the ruining of yet another of my mornings. 

*“See you later bum-face!”* Anne suddenly shouted as she smirked from behind the school fence. I turned with a frown to watch as she soon ran off giggling with her friends.

I had a response, I honestly did. But it just came to me just that little bit too late. Anne was already out of earshot. So I just sighed as I swallowed my words, I popped the collar on my coat as I continued on down the path. My gaze remained on the floor as I trod upon fallen, crisp leaves. That was a sure enough sign that autumn was now in full swing. 

Whilst I walked the remainder of my way to my school I took the opportunity to think more on my ‘scariest story yet’. What could I tell Anne to get her finally shaking in her boots? I had imagined for a long, long time about what a victory that’d be. What I didn’t imagine however, was to be greeted on this dreary, wet morning by two words -

*“… Good morning.*” 

My train of thought was disturbed as I heard the mysterious voice coming from across the road. I didn’t stop however as I was already late for school. Though I did glance across the street as I moved, I noticed what looked to be a homeless man standing slightly obscured beside a lonely tree. 

*“Sorry I don’t have any change.”* 

I hastily replied with the first thing that came to mind though my tone sounded a lot less friendlier. It was a lie of course but the whole thing about this man standing half obscured behind a spindly tree just instantly gave me the creeps. 

The stranger went on to say something else but by that time I was too far away to make any sense of it. He continued to stand there ominously watching me move steadily out of view.

As I turned down the next street I only then registered the hairs prickling on the back of my neck. Something was definitely off about that guy but I wouldn’t let it ruin my day any further.

It was more than likely just another person down on their luck looking to strike up conversation with any random passersby. He's most probably just looking to exchange pleasantries for some pocket change, I thought. 

I soon met up with two of my friends James and Luke just outside the school. 

*“Ready for another day in hell?”* Luke commented, his freckle dotted face forming a smirk. James was just finishing off a slice of toast. 

*“Urgh, let’s get this over with.”* I replied before dragging my feet to the first of many classes.

I spent the majority of my day floating in and out of lessons whilst I thought about little else but the need for revenge upon my turd of a sister. It was when I was sitting in my science class that I began to really nail some ideas, I’d frantically jot them down as they sprang to mind within my old notebook. 

The notebook was my creative outlet of every failed story and creation, I had recorded hundreds of entries between those two black covers. It was the entire collection of my works starting from way back in my youth.

My pen marked a full stop as I’d take a minute to relax my throbbing hand whilst reviewing what I’d written so far. I’d squint whilst using the tip of my pen to guide my way through the massive splurge of words I’d scribbled upon the pages.

I wanted nothing more than to just come up with something good, I wanted something I could use against Anne. But at the same time I wanted it today and I wanted it quickly but I soon realised that this mindset came at a high price. 

*“This is shit!”* 

I exclaimed without thinking about where I was. The class all turned at once to stare at me including my friends. My teacher Mr Pomfret furrowed his brow looking most displeased. I think it’d been more about the fact I’d just interrupted another one of his boring slide shows on photosynthesis. The shouting of a swear word however must’ve come a close second as I wound up having to stay behind during lunch to catch up on what I’d missed.

*“I want pages 12 to 15 completed out of your workbook by the time I come back, Jason.”* Mr Pomfret said as he readied a stack of papers for the photocopier, he left shortly after.

I looked through the window as I watched my fellow classmates enjoy their bout of freedom on the playground. I turned in my chair to see Luke and James waiting down behind the music block for me. That was always our place to have a cheeky smoke or to chill whilst we ate our lunches and bantered with one another. 

Though I was startled when I noticed something else familiar too, it was almost missable near the furthest end of the playground. 

It was the man from earlier that day. It at least looked like him from my one and only glance. I watched as he sat atop an old tree stump, it was situated between a few dotted trees just on the opposite side of the school fence. 

*He was watching the children play, his eyes frighteningly wide.*

A thought sprung to mind and I instinctively felt the need to run and fetch Mr Pomfret. But to my surprise I instead found myself leaning in closer, I started to pay him a lot more attention now than I had done this morning. Nobody had yet to have seen him, and I hadn’t seen anyone try to move him on either.

My hand fidgeted with my pen as a thought then sprung to mind. Admittedly I didn’t ponder on it for long before deciding to go ahead with it. I looked around once more for any sign of my teacher before flipping open my notebook to a fresh blank page. 

I then started to draw the man. 

I didn’t want to draw him exactly as he looked, I wanted to exaggerate his peculiar appearance as best I could. My newly sketched image will then become the foundations of my new story. 

I smiled to myself as I went about my drawing, I was feeling optimistic about this one.

*“This is going to be great.”* I muttered, sticking my tongue out in concentration.

Though a thought did linger in the back of my mind as I continued to sketch the lurker beyond the fence. 

Was it wrong what I was doing? Should I have just gone to tell someone a man was watching the playground? Absolutely, I’m not a complete idiot. This guy is more than likely sitting there with something sinister on his agenda.

But just to look at him gave me the chills I required for a solid piece of fiction, I **needed** to capture his essence. The very air about this man screamed a horror writer's dream. I felt frustrated at myself for not giving him a proper glance earlier. But I now sat here with both the time and the means to illustrate him fully.

After I’d completed something of a caricature of ‘the watcher’, I instantly thought of a rather simplistic name for him. A name that retained a certain air of mystery about him.

**“The Stump Man”** I spoke proudly whilst writing it above my horrific sketch. 

I had the image now I just needed the story to go with it. I felt a smirk creep into the corner of my mouth as I laid down my pen, it was a job well done.

I glanced back up to the man beyond the fence only to find him gone. I stood up abruptly at that as I placed my hands against the window whilst surveying the outside perimeter. I felt like a prison warden overseeing a yard of unruly inmates. 

I was struck with surprise to notice he’d carefully slunk down the line of fence and was now talking directly with James and Luke. They were still tucked away behind the music block, both of them completely concealed from the view of the on duty teacher. 

I couldn’t make out what was being said but the exchange wasn’t long. The man gestured loosely with his slender, grubby hands before the boys laughed him out of there, they seemed to dismiss him entirely as they’d walk off. The man however didn’t look very happy at all, he’d remain there glaring at them with his hands wrenched against the bars of the fence. 

After another scalding from Mr Pomfret and a less than engaging English lesson later, I finished school for another day.

It was common for me and James to walk back some of the way together as he lived not far from my sister's school. So we said our farewells to Luke at the gates before setting off. 

*“Mate, what was up with that weird guy I saw you and Luke talk with earlier?”* I dove straight into it whilst kicking a pile of leaves. 

*“Oh him? You saw that huh? Silly sod tried to take us for fools, he wanted to know if we wanted to explore something he’d found in the woods after school. He was adamant we’d find it ‘cool’, but he’d only take us if we really wanted to go.”* James chuckled at that as he casually shook his head.

*“Bloody nonce, hangin around the school-…”* \- *“That’s brilliant!”* I cut James off whilst thumbling to produce my notebook from my school bag. James looked utterly perplexed as he’d witness me scramble to find the right page before scribbling down a couple of sentences. 

*“What the hell are you writing?”* James said as he’d lean in over my shoulder to see what all the fuss was about. 

 ***“The… Stump Man?”*** He spoke with a hint of intrigue. 

*“You’re using* ***THAT*** *guy as a basis for another story, really Jason?”* He sounded slightly aggravated before adding *“That creep really needs putting away before he does some real damage!”*

*“Yeah I know, I know! But what I’ve got now will make for my scariest story yet! You’ll see! I’ll see you tomorrow.”* I insisted as we went our separate ways, Jason was still holding on to a frown.

My creation of ***‘The Stump Man’*** felt close enough to reality, it felt relatable enough to get the better of Anne this time. And I was excited about that.

It’s only a Thursday but that somehow meant another date night in our household. 

*“Try and buy something other than pizza tonight, you got it?”* My father said, extending his arm out coldly to hand me a crisp £20 note. 

*“Well maybe if you cooked for once?”* I muttered as I slipped the money into my back pocket. 

*“Don’t be a smart arse with me boy.”* My father spoke, as if the truth was quite bothersome for him, he returned fire with a light clip around my ear with the flat of his palm. It sent a mild ringing sensation through my skull. 

Down the hall a much softer voice was heard, *“Try and buy something with a little green on it for Anne please!”* It was my mother, she was fussing yet again with her hair and makeup in the hallway mirror. 

***“The taxi is out the front, Brenda!”*** 

My father called out as he brushed past me towards the front door, he collected his heavy coat and wallet without so much as a *“Goodnight.”*

My mother placed her red lipstick within her purse before giving Anne a hug and kiss goodnight, Anne was already standing ready in her favourite unicorn pyjamas. 

*“I love you, we’ll be back around 22:00 ok darling?”* she said before turning to me with a quick peck. Both of us now saddled with a faint red smudge on our foreheads.

*“I want Anne in bed and asleep by 20:00 no later, do you hear me Jason?”* She added, her voice always seemed that little bit sterner when talking to me. 

*“20:00 on the dot.”* I replied, glancing past my mother towards Anne, she was rubbing the loving mark off her forehead whilst glaring back at me from the bottom step.  

*“Wonderful.”* Her smile was fleeting as she pulled her slender frame through the arm holes of her leather jacket. She’d blow us a kiss whilst both me and Anne caught another whiff of her potent, flowery perfume. At that she finally pulled the front door shut before promptly locking it from the outside. 

*“I want pizza for dinner!”* 

Anne demanded as soon as we were alone, she poked her head once more between the railings of the stairs. 

*“No way!”* I scoffed as I looked up at her, *“I always chose, besides, I’m the one with the money. I think I’ll order us some fried chicken instead!”* I laughed knowing how much Anne hated the stuff.

I flexed the £20 note out in front of her, smirking as I pinched it carefully between my fingers. I looked wholly satisfied whilst Anne seemed utterly distraught. 

*“You’re such a bum-face, looser!”* She shouted whilst throwing a tantrum as if she was 3 again. I heard her exhale sharply whilst doing her best to stomp up the entirety of the stairs. 

I could hear her persistence as Anne continued trying her very best to annoy me. I knew she wanted to arouse my anger as she blared out her crappy music and made stupid noises from within her bedroom. 

*“You’ll have to try harder than that!”* I’d call up to her, whether she heard me or not. I then made my way into the living room feeling rather content with how my evening was shaping up. 

Dinner started out a success for me at least as I watched with a smirk as Anne touched nothing but her small portion of fries. She’d been poking her pieces of fried chicken around her plate for a good 10 minutes now. 

*“Stop being a sissy and try abit, you might actually like it!”* I teased, being less than playful as I peeled a piece of fried skin from a drumstick. I then began to dangle it around her now horrified face, I watched as her eyes widened whilst her disgust became prominent.

***“STOP IT JASON!”*** 

Anne squealed as she suddenly leapt nimbly from her chair, she ran quickly out of the dining room and down the hallway. I was still in hot pursuit as I continued to chase her, I didn’t want to let her off so quickly. My hand was still waving that dripping piece of chicken skin near the back of her ginger head and I had no intention of letting up. 

I did eventually however, as I was stopped abruptly when Anne also took a pause herself. From where I stood she was now about halfway down the entrance hall. 

Her eyes glanced back at me before flashing a tinge of green, a spell of mischief to be sure. I watched as she positioned her dainty hands around an expensive looking vase. The blue and red vase was our grandmothers, gifted between generations as an heirloom of sorts. It’s by far our father’s favourite decoration in this entire house. It stood proudly upon a white plinth whilst immaculate in its presentation.

*“Don’t you do it Anne!”* I blurted out as my voice was unable to cover my worry.

*“That’s too far!”* I called out again as the feeling of being powerless washed over me. 

*“... Oops!”*

Anne didn’t even hesitate as she single handedly sentenced me to an unrivalled scalding from our father. I knew they’d never have believed that *she* could’ve done this after all. I just watched whilst my eyes widened as Anne shoved the pristine object from the platform. 

I let out a voiceless cry, I watched it in slow motion as it plummeted towards the hard floor. A loud crash was heard as both of us winced in unison, we saw pieces of it scatter upon impact. 

***“Anne!”*** I yelled, I felt as if I had turned a shade of red myself. My blood boiled as I gripped her arm tightly, she protested and struggled as I stormed her up the stairs. *“You’re hurting me, Jason!”* she whimpered as I pushed her into her room. 

*“I’m sorry ok! I’ll tell mum and dad it was me!”* Her voice was now trembling, she’d never seen me this angry before.

But I didn’t care for her pleas as I marched to my bedroom and picked up my notebook, I didn’t think two ways about it at this point. I returned to her but to my surprise Anne was already sitting up under her duvet, she attempted to appease me by putting herself to bed early. 

*“What’s that?”* She’d ask with a tone of worry mixed with intrigue, her hand pointing at my notebook. Silently I flipped it open, I used my thumb to skim the pages before jabbing a finger down upon the one I wanted, then I began.

*“Have you ever heard of …****The Stump Man?****”*

Though my voice is still heavy with anger, I'd always try to add a certain flair to my story telling.

Anne simply shook her head, she’d scoot back towards her pillows as she’d watch me, her eyes peeking a little above her duvet. 

*“I don’t want to hear one of your scary stories tonight, I just want to go to sleep.”* She spoke as her voice became little more than a whisper.

*“He lives not far from here, in fact he’s just out there… In those woods.”* I’d continue whilst moving around the room. I’d throw back her spotty curtains, exposing her bedroom to the darkness of the fields that lay just beyond our garden.

*“Jason please, stop it, I - I’ll go straight to sleep.”* Anne continued, now clutching tight her purple teddy bear as she’d follow my gaze out the window.

*“Under a rotten old tree stump… That’s where he lives you see. He crawls out in search of his next victim to snatch with his long gangly arms!”* I’d go on to say, my reading was passionate, I felt the hard work starting to pay off.

*“But the thing is about The Stump Man-...” -* ***“JASON, PLEASE!”*** Anne shouted, she’d cut me off mid-sentence. My sister was clearly disturbed enough to shorten my efforts and gladly put herself to bed. I was finally winning. I quickly reminded myself of the utter disaster this little turd had made for me downstairs, so I pressed my finger to the line I’d last started before continuing regardless.

*“But the thing about The Stump Man is, he only skulks where he’s wanted… And he’ll only come creeping around… If he’s summoned. And he’s particularly fond of naughty children.”*

I’d move towards the window again as my hand pulled down the handle. I’d proceed to swing the window wide open. I could hear Anne begin to quietly sob, she hadn’t long pulled her duvet completely over her head to mask her obvious fear. Though I felt no shame in it, I’d waited for this day, it was the day I’d be able to deliver a little payback of my own. 

And I had every intention to finish what I started.

***“Oh, STUMP MAN!”***

I called for the monster across the fields and through the forest beyond. I utilised my script word for word. I expressed to my fullest potential the playful yet stern call, the same call that I’d practised religiously on my walk home from school that day. 

*I wanted it to sound perfect.*

I slowly crept away from the window, carefully moving around the bed as I knelt down by the side of the pink mound of bedding that was my sister.

*“He’d have heard that one especially… Don’t you think so?”* I seemed to have transformed my voice for that particular part into something truly disturbing.

I stood up again, pausing at the constant sound of crying now coming from beneath the duvet. I’d come too far to stop now, though admittedly I’d missed a whole chunk of what I wanted to say. In that particular moment I became annoyed at myself for letting Anne shelter away so quickly into my story. 

I sighed at that whilst speeding up to my grand finale, I’d bring my hand to the page that harboured the monstrous picture from my notebook. I’d tear it out before placing it thoughtfully on Anne’s nightstand, the menacing visage of ‘The Stump Man’ now aglow from her white rainbow light.

*“Sleep tight.”* 

I’d whisper as my payback was now complete. Turning I left her bedroom. 

This was my victory march and it was hailed by the sound of Anne's terrified sobbing.

The feeling was short lived, as I spent the rest of the night cleaning up the mess downstairs. I was a little more than nervous for how this’ll all play out when my parents return. I went to bed early as I was hoping they wouldn’t confront me about it until the morning. Anne’s room was deadly quiet as I walked past but I smiled to myself at that, it truly was a pleasant change.

I hardly had time to dream that night before I was awoken by a soft noise coming from the foot of my bed. 

*“... Jason, I-I’m scared.”*

I was startled suddenly awake, my vision blurred as I leant across to flick on my bedside light. The small darkened spectre standing at the bottom of my bed became highlighted, it was revealed to be Anne, her eyes red and puffy from excessive crying. She was clutching her purple teddy bear close to her chest.

*“... P-please, please can I sleep in with you? Mother and Father aren’t home yet.”*

I groaned at that, squinting as I looked at my alarm clock reading 22:30. I sighed, my parents were indeed late home *again*. But what seemed to have bothered me more was my subsiding dislike for my sibling, I figured it must’ve nulled slightly in my sleep. 

*“Urgh, what’s up? Is this about The Stump Man thing? That’s just a story, Anne, I made that all up to finally scare you silly, just go back to sleep…”*

I murmured as I turned over to face away from her. Hoping she got the message but it turned out to be quite the opposite. She moved up next to me before crawling over my covers as she made her way into the opposite side of my bed. 

I protested with my eyes still half closed but to my own surprise I allowed it. She wasn’t big afterall, in fact it was her chunky purple teddy bear that took up more room.

*“Anne, this isn’t funny. We've got school tomorrow and I need to sleep…”* 

I mumbled half asleep as I shifted to turn back around and away from her. I then leant across to turn off my bedside light.

*“... I don’t want to sleep in my room tonight.”*

I didn’t respond, instead I settled back down before closing my eyes. Minutes must’ve passed as I had almost fallen back into a peaceful sleep. When Anne finally whispered again, and what she said sent a cold spell down my spine.

*“... It’s The Stump Man, he’s… H-he’s outside, he’s in the garden by the back fence.”*

*“... What did you say?”* I spoke, my eyes now wide open, my brow furrowed in clear confusion. I tilted my head back towards her, Anne now obscured once more in the dark.

*“... H-he just waved at me though, as if he was asking me to come down, he looked at me with his big yellow eyes and long arms, just like your drawing. I shut the window and came straight in here, p-please don’t be mad at me.”*

*“I’m not mad, I’m-... Just… Just go to sleep, Anne.”* 

I insisted as if trying to mask my own growing concerns as I mentaly re-traced the actions I made of locking down the house before bedtime. I felt secure enough in my routine though Anne’s never been like this before, *ever*. 

She didn’t speak to me again after that, it turns out she had fallen asleep with her feet entangled with mine, despite my attempts to pry them apart during the night. I stayed awake for a while longer as I was entirely perplexed by what she told me. 

A thought crossed my mind that this was perhaps the start of something new, I thought it was actually the makings of an apology from Anne for what she had done tonight. I then spared a lasting thought about what I did to her in return, I felt that forgotten pang of guilt echo in my heart.

*“Tomorrow is a new day.”* I thought to myself before finally closing my eyes.

***“Jason, get down here now!”***

I awoke just before my alarm as I yawned and stretched out a small kink in my back. It was my mother, she was calling me from downstairs. And by her voice she didn’t sound pleased at all. I looked around to find myself alone, Anne must’ve already left for breakfast. 

*“You’ll have some explaining to do to your father when he gets home tonight.”* Mother stated as she placed a bowl of cereal in front of me. 

*“We’re absolutely livid with you. Do you know how old that vase was? Well, do you?”* She’d continue to scowl whilst hastily preparing Anne’s lunchbox. 

That’s when I finally noticed Anne, she’d never been so quiet before in all her life. She looked almost statue-like as she’d sit there staring blankly at the table. 

*“I-... I’m sorry mother.”* I replied without genuine thought as my concern fell ultimately upon my sister. 

*“Eat up darling.”* My mother spoke as her tone returned to normal, she didn’t seem to notice the obvious change as she gently placed her favourite pancakes out in front of her.

*“Now I’ve got to pop out to do some shopping so you’ll have to see yourselves off to school today!”* Mother shouted down the hall as she grabbed her handbag and keys. She entered the kitchen once more only to swiftly peck Anne upon the side of her head. I’d received a glare in passing as she soon made her way out the front door.

*“I saw him again.”* Anne finally spoke as she’d lift her gaze from her plate to me.

*“The Stump Man?”* I responded with my mouth half full with cereal. 

*“You need to let that go, Anne. He isn’t real, it’s just a made up story-...” - “He is real. He was standing behind our tree in the garden. I saw him when I went to brush my teeth… He waved at me again.”* 

I stopped eating, and before long I found myself standing by the back door. I didn’t know what to think as I peered out into our dismal garden. I looked for a long time, I wanted to see what she was seeing. However I didn’t, I didn't see any sign of anyone.

I walked side by side with Anne on the way into school, much to my surprise she even grasped for my hand as we walked past the fields. To my even greater surprise… I let her. 

*“Will you walk home with me today?”* Anne asked as we stopped for a moment outside her school gates.

*“Don’t you want to walk home with your friends?”* I replied, though I tried not to sound too enforcing.

*“No. I’ll be waiting for you, please don’t be late.”* Her voice sounded scared as her eyes moved between me and the surrounding area. I followed her gaze but saw nothing between the quiet road and trees.

*“Ok, I’ll be here.”* I promised her before letting out an audible grunt as Anne rushed into my stomach for a hug. 

*“Thank you, I’m… I’m sorry for being mean to you all the time.”*

*“That’s… That’s ok. I’m sorry for being mean too. I’ll see you later, ok?”*

I then watched as she walked off into her school, she turned to wave at me again before heading inside. She’d missed the bell today for the first time in her schooling career. 

I smiled slightly at that. 

*Unaware that this was the last time I’d ever see her again.*

I rushed home from school after her teacher sent out a distress call, one of their pupils had been reported missing around lunchtime. Police were already at our house long before I got there, my stomach dropped as it became painfully obvious that the girl who was missing was Anne. 

My little sister.

I saw Father trying to console Mother at the dinner table, they were surrounded by two officers insisting on any information on the possible whereabouts of their daughter. 

But little did they know I already had all the information they needed. I've had it since yesterday when I first heard him say "Good morning…" 

I should've said something, Jason was right... 

But, I needed the scariest story… Didn’t I?

The police never did find out what happened to my sister, she’d simply vanished without any leads or trace.

But I knew exactly where she was… She was in the nearby forest under an old rotten stump.

She was snatched by ***The Stump Man***.

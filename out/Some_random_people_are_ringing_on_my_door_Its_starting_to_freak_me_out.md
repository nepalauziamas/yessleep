I searched the whole internet and tried to convince the police, no one is believing me I have no idea what to do. I know you will believe me. I moved in with my wife few week ago. Me and my wife are really short with money and the house was really cheap so we took the house. The owners told us NOT TO OPEN doors after 12:00 PM. We asked why but they didn't gave us a reason so we let it go. 

On our first night someone rang the bell “Who is it?” *no responde* my wife told me to not open the door, I didn't. And that was going on and on for week. *Ring* . This time I was so pissed off that I went and opened the door. My wife shouted from the other room that I shouldn’t do that but I did anyway. I regretted that deeply. A kid with no eyes looked at me. “Help me” she said. “What the fuck?. DIANA a little girl with weird eyes is here come please”. My wife came I looked at her “ Honey some child-“. “Why did you call me?”. “There’s this kid an-“ “But honey there’s no one”. I stood there frozen as a fish. I looked slowly at the direction at the child. There was no one. “ “But a child just standing there right in front of my eyes and she was asking for help”.  “ Do you have a cold, maybe you should skip work tomorrow and go to bed “. I didn't believe what just happened but I went back to sleep. 

The next day I saw a note that said “never call your wife again”. She wasn't at home so I couldn’t ask her. “Maybe she is teasing me?”. I brushed it off. At that moment my phone rang. “ Hello, how was the first night?” , “ It was really good, “ I said. It wasn't. My wife's work finished and she still didn't come home. *Ring* “Who is it”, “It’s me darling”. My wife never calls me like that. “Coming” at that moment my phone rings . New message from Diana. I opened my phone and my wife said “ I will come in 30 min “.  I stoped, I was standing there frozen. “ Open the damn door it’s freezing out here “. I checked on the eyehole. It was my wife but it wasn't her. I called my wife and asked “hey where are you” “ coming home, I will be there for 10 min “ “Can you pls go to buy something in the restaurant “ “Uhh sure bye”. I wasn’t actually hungry, I just wanted to get rid of my “wife” at the door. “I checked through eyehole to see was my “wife” was still there. She wasn’t. “Thank god she is gone”. It was 1 am when my wife came home. “Hi honey” “ Hi where’s the food” “What food….Oh that food the restaurant was closed sorry” “It’s fine anyway I wasn’t hungry”. The next day I got up kissed my wife on the cheek while she was a sleep and went downstairs. The police was in front of the house. I went to check what was happening. “ Maybe a dog ran away?” I thought. I asked what was wrong. “ Hello, what is happening? “ “ Hello, can I speak to your wife ?” “Yes sure she is upstairs” 


“Sir your wife was killed last night”.

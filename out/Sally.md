My mother has a story about me as a child that she tells every chance she gets. I don't remember it, but this is how she tells it.  When I was about 4 or 5 years old, I had an imaginary friend named Sally, and she and I were inseparable.  Everything that I had, she had to have one too. If I was eating dinner, she needed a plate the same as me. If I was drinking juice, she needed a cup. If I was coloring, she needed a paper and crayons. We were best friends.

Slowly, my mom started to notice some weird things about this, but always chalked it up to me being a kid. The first time she got really creeped out, we were driving, and made a turn. I got very upset at that point and started crying. My mother asked me what was wrong, and I told her that I didn't want to die on the bridge like Sally.

Obviously, this scared my mother. There was no bridge on the street where we were going anymore, but she did know that there used to be. And I was very young, nobody around me had ever died before, she didn't even know how I knew the word die. But eventually, she had to assume it was something I'd heard at school.

Sally continued to stay by my side. My family would still give me two of everything, one for me, one for her. However, this was clearly inconvenient, and one day my mother was running late and only got one cup of juice to bring on the car ride with us. When she handed it to me, I asked for Sally's juice, and she said Sally couldn't have one today, and went to sit in the front seat. As she climbed in, my cup flew from the passenger back seat toward her, hardly missed her, and then landed on the ground and rolled under the car.

My mother assumed I was being a brat and went to grab the cup from under the car so that we could leave. As she reached down, I said, singsongily, "I wouldn't do that if I was youuuu." When my mother asked me why, I responded "Because if you do, Sally's gonna run you over." My mom says she then got back in the car, put it in park, quickly grabbed the cup, and we left. I never said another word about it.

A few days later, she was talking to my Godfather who was in the army. They had been friends since they were kids and bonded over practicing witchcraft together as teenagers. She ended up telling him about Sally and how I had been scaring her. After hearing about what happened in the car, he cut her off. He told her to go in the boxes of stuff she was holding for him while he served, find his black bible, and burn it. She did as he said, and I never mentioned Sally again.

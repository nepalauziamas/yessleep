Last year I was driving across the country by myself.  My job had transferred me recently, and I had six weeks to scout out a new house before I was packed up and stuck in temporary housing instead of a place of my choosing.  So I took a week off from work to drive out and find a place.

I’d been happy about the trip at first—it was kind of a vacation/roadtrip after all, and while I was nervous about moving to a different part of the country, I was kind of excited too.  While I enjoyed driving, I’d never gone further that a few hundred miles in any one direction.  Silly as it might sound, I felt a little like an explorer heading into an uncharted land.

That feeling lasted most of the first day, but by the third it had begun wearing thin.  I was seeing some cool scenery and interesting spots along the way, but I had very limited time to enjoy them before I had to get back on the road.  And the road itself?  Well, most of it was boring to the point of putting me to sleep.

And that’s where the real problem first started.  I’d decided to push on down the interstate until I got to a place that looked like it had better hotels than the places I’d slept the last couple of nights, and before I knew it I was drowsing in and out of sleep.  Not full sleep—I wasn’t running off the road or anything, not yet anyway—but that heavy-lidded hypnosis that slowly clouds your brain as you watch your car eat mile after featureless mile.  I’d run through my supply of caffeine and I wasn’t sure how far I was from the next gas station or rest stop.  My phone had acted like I should have come up on one a few miles back, but there’d been no exit or signs that I could tell.

Or maybe I’d just missed them.  I was getting to the point where I was having to shake myself awake, and while I hated the idea of getting out on the interstate shoulder, I may not have a choice if I didn’t find a place to stop soon.  I was still debating a good place to stop and do some jumping jacks when I saw a rusty green sign.

*Last Rest Stop 1 mile*

Slapping my face and blinking, I sped up a little.  I could get there and use the bathroom, walk around, maybe even get something out of the vending machine if it didn’t look too suspect.  I felt myself starting to drift again, but then the ramp appeared and I was turning down into a patch of shadows.

This was the right place, wasn’t it?

It seemed so—no, it must be, because there was another rest stop sign.  I just wasn’t used to rest stops being so far back from the road and so poorly lit.  I took the long, winding off-ramp around a curling stand of hardwoods and saw the first of the lights.  I slowed and stared for a second.  It really was just hidden back here, and even with the clusters of lights across the parking lot and on the buildings themselves, I had the thought that it was losing the fight against the dark and that when another old light or two burned out, the night would pour in.

Laughing to myself, I started toward the front of the parking lot.  That was so stupid.  It was a rest stop, so it wasn’t necessarily the safest place ever, but I probably had a greater risk of getting herpes from a toilet seat than I did getting robbed or “the night pouring in”.  What did that even mean?  I really needed some coffee or candy or...

Did someone just run behind that dumpster?

Slowing to a crawl, I squinted out at where I thought I’d seen movement.  Nothing.  Just my tired imagination probably, though I did feel a bit more nervous now at the idea of getting out of the car.  Glancing around the parking lot again only confirmed I was the only one there.  At least that I could see.

Irritation began to well up as I glanced at the dash clock.  It was ten minutes to midnight at a rest stop in the middle of nowhere.  Of *course* it was empty.  Besides, I needed to pee and get something to eat if possible.  Walk around and wake up or I’d have bigger problems than jumping at shadows like some scared little kid.

Grumbling to myself, I parked up at the sidewalk that led to the small cluster of buildings and got out.  The air was cold here, way colder than I remembered it being when I’d stopped for gas three hours earlier.  Then again, what did I know about how cold it got at night in this part of the country?  Forcing myself forward, I studied the structures I was approaching in the dim, flickering lights of the parking lot.

There were three buildings in all—three rectangles facing each other and connected by a shared covered walkway between them.  The right was the men’s bathroom, the left was women’s.  In the middle was a visitor’s center of some kind, and through the front windows I could see the glow of vending machines against the back wall.  Okay, cool.  First piss, then snacks.

Going into the men’s bathroom, I felt a stab of fear as I went around the first turn of the dogleg wall that led into the main area with the urinals and stalls.  An image of someone lurking around the corner waiting to pounce on me with knives or teeth flashed in my mind and I pushed it away.  I was being an idiot.  Entering the bathroom, I saw no sign of anyone.  It was just a normal public bathroom, if a bit darker and dirtier than most I’d visited.

Still, I found myself veering away from the urinals and going to the last stall instead.  I knew it was because I didn’t want my back exposed to the entrance while I used a urinal, but I didn’t chastise myself too much as I slid home the bolt on the flimsy particle board door and

“Help me, please.”

I sucked in a breath as I instinctively backed against the far wall of the stall.  The voice had been a soft and feminine whisper shot through with desperation and fear.  And it had been close.  As close as the next stall over.  Every muscle tense, I made myself whisper a reply.

“Hello?”

“Can you help me?  We…we’re all in danger.”

I was moving from startled to scared now, but I forced myself to focus.  If there really was an emergency or something, I needed to keep my head straight and figure out how I could help.  “What’s going on?”

I heard a slight shift of movement on the other side of the door.  “He’s after me and my brother.  We thought we’d left him behind, but he followed us all the way here.  Me and M…My brother got separated.”

“I…uh…okay.  I can call 911, just a second.”  I reached into my pocket even as I remembered I’d left my phone on its stand in the car.  “Shit, I don’t have it with me.”

A slight pause and then:  “It doesn’t matter.  Phones don’t work good when he’s around anyway.  We just…you said you have a car?”

“Well yeah, I mean sure.  I can go get help or…”  I found myself hesitating.  I didn’t pick up hitchhikers or let strangers into my car generally, but was I really going to leave her behind while I “went for help” miles away or tried to call 911?  This was all weird, and I didn’t know what she meant by phones not working around this guy, *and* I hadn’t even seen her yet, but still, I had to help her and her brother if I could, didn’t I?  Swallowing, I went on.  “Or let’s just find your brother if we can and get out of here.  Get to a police station or call someone when we can.  Okay?”

“Yeah, thank…thank you for not just leaving us here.”

I smiled weakly at the stall door.  “Sure, of course not.”  Undoing the bolt slowly, I opened the door a crack and peered out.  No sign of anyone out there, and while my heart was pounding out of my chest and there was maybe some kind of horror movie killer out there, I knew waiting to step out wouldn’t help anything either.  As I left the stall, I heard the bolt slide away in the one next to me and I tensed again.  What if this was all a trick?  A way of robbing people at rest stops or something by having some girl play a damsel in distress?

But no, she was stepping out now—a woman just a little younger than me.  She gave me a timid smile before glancing around like I had when I’d come out a moment before.  I was struck by several things at once—she was beautiful, the thick patch of scar tissue that ran up from her neck across her left cheek and up across her shaved scalp somehow only highlighting the delicate perfection of her features rather than lessening them.  Also, she was wearing a massive yellow raincoat that swallowed her, the hood of the thing making her face seem ethereal floating in its pool of shadows.  And finally, this wasn’t some joke or trick.  She really was terrified.

Blood thundering in my ears, I held out my hand.

“Come on.  Let’s find your brother and get out of [here.”](https://redd.it/9ndww5)

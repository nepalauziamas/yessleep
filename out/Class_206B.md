I got a letter in my mail about my new school, it had a bus pass with my name and address on it however, it also came with this small paper that was titled “Rules” I opened it I already knew what was in it since the title was pretty obvious, I looked at the paper expecting to see normal rules like “ do not chew gum in class” but instead I found rules that were *odd* I was confused reading the rules 

Hello, I’m your principle Mr. Lawrence and I welcome you into your new school, I am very exited to meet you tomorrow however you must read a few of our first week rules. This rules are different that any other weeks rules. 

Rule 1: Do NOT talk to anyone but the teachers. If you see a man on the stairs do NOT reply to him.

Rule 2: As soon as you enter the building go to the bathroom, there on the corner you will find a small paper with your classes for the day, you should look at the same corner everyday for the first week.

Rule 3: at 12:45 PM lunch will be served, if you are a minute late or a minute early you will NOT get food

Rule 4: Lunch will look like a salad with mashed potatoes do NOT eat the mashed potatoes.

Rule 5: if anyone offers you a drink do NOT drink it as the drink isn’t for you, you’re gonna need it later.

Rule 6: check the clock every 30 minutes if the clock didn’t change RUN.

Rule 7: if you hear anyone scream help RUN, because if you heard them they definitely heard you.

Good luck 

What the hell? What type of sick prank is this???? Why the hell would they do a prank like this? I had so many question but I didn’t have any answers. The next day I went into the bathroom at school since I forgot to use it, however there was a paper on the corner “huh? I guess they take their pranks seriously” I picked up the paper the paper said which classes I should go to the first class said * Class 204B* I knew that was on the second floor. I looked at the clock 9:12
My first class started at 9:15 I was going to be late. I rushed to where the stairs were at but there was a man on the stairs who said a weird deep voice “ the stairs are closed kid go use the elevator” oh we have an elevator? I thought. I rushed to the try to find the elevator but it wasn’t anywhere. 9:24 I finally found it I got in, I found room 204 really quick since it was next to the elevator as soon as I got out of the elevator there was an announcement: * Lockdown this is NOT a drill find the safest place to hide-* what? A lockdown? There wasn’t anywhere I could hide. I know the principle said to never go to another classroom but there’s a f*ucking lockdown? I rushed to room 206 “Who are you?” Said a kid “oh sorry my name is Ma-“ I broke the rule. I wasn’t supposed to talk to the kids. All of the people in the classroom looked at me with a blank stare they looked… dead

I am not of your time, but hail from a period of your far-flung and almost entirely forgotten past. A fiend, a black-hearted nightmare murdered my finally, and fled here via a hastily conjured temporal portal—to this weird and wondrous time of metal and industry. I tracked him to a place called “Missouri”, where he had presumably planned to conduct his ultra-wicked diablerie and unsanctioned sorceries unrivaled—for I know that such arts have long since faded from *pedestrian* use among your kind with the extinction of the magically blessed.  

This is a report of my terrifying battle against my infinitely nefarious nemesis, who came here not alone, but accompanied by a silver-scaled, nebulously winged wyrm. The rider, what you may call an “elf”, acquired and tamed the beast in its infancy; teaching it some rudimentary yet potent form of black magic. It was this magic that allowed the beast to sprout fleetingly tangible wings, in abominable defiance of its ordinarily wingless species. Together, they sought to wreak havoc and untold atrocities upon the oblivious citizens of your mundane time—but I, seeking vengeance and having a stout heart for justice, was not prepared to let that happen.  

For the sake of convenience, my story begins mid-pursuit.  

Brilliant shafts of lightning danced across the field, occasionally obliterating one of the wretched and bent trees scattered throughout. The air—once light and easily respirable—quickly became suffused with a heavy black smoke, and the sky darkened as if with the sudden onset of night. Wandering through the newly risen murk, I tried to spot the sylvan terror, hoping to catch him off guard before he could pilot his baneful wyrm toward me. I’d seen the demon a few moments before, silently weaving with deft, serpentine motions through the blasted field, avoiding lightning as if engaged in some unspoken dance with the sky itself.  

Lightning strikes, furious and bright, barely served to illumine the path ahead of me, and several times I had to wait for successive strikes just to plot a course of a few feet. As the air grew thicker and breathing became harder, I wondered if I should just give up; if I should turn around, and hope to find my way back through the smoldering gloom. But something innate, an inborn mantle of responsibility, kept me from turning back. I knew, deep down, that I had to finish things: had to stop that elven deviant from inflicting more harm upon innocents. How I’d do that, I didn’t know. I knew only that upon sighting him, I would give my opening attack my all—and hope that it would be enough. I’d traded blows with him before, on land, in a forest of our time. But the presence of his draconic steed—that ageless, ophidian nightmare—changed things. I’d never be able to deal any significant damage to such a formidable beast of legend.  

Unwinding my maiden-given scarf from my neck and winding it around my face, I pushed on, preserving what I could of my lungs against the acrid, stinging smoke. Small embers intermittently assisted in guiding me; the smoldering remains of once great growths, cowed and bent by time, and blasted to ruin by lightning. I’d never seen any space of land so utterly razed by nature, and figured that the lightning’s intensity was preternatural; manifested not of any natural atmospheric activity, but called forth with unprecedented violence by some master of elemental chaos. My quarry had doubtlessly invoked demons or specters of air and night to aid him in his campaign of chaos.  

A shape, elongated and dark, passed by overhead, and I hunched down—hoping that the soaring fiend hadn’t seen me. My opponent's vision would be obscured by the smoke as much as mine was, but the wyrm, with its superior senses, probably had no trouble in seeing through the dense smoke. It also had undoubtedly been reared amidst a similar environment; some perpetually volcanic region wherein smoke and flame were as common as rain and snow are here. It would probably take a great deal of darkness—if not pitch-blackness—to fully obstruct its hyper-acute and many-eyed sight.  

Remaining still, and even—perhaps needlessly—holding my breath, I waited and watched; tracking the beast’s snakish motions as it passed through the air, leaving small currents in its wake. It was admittedly mesmerizing, watching it effortlessly weave in and out of harm’s way, curling around the columnal shafts of light as they sped landward. The resultant flash and destruction of their landfall added a darkly beautiful grandeur to the whole display; and had I not needed to remain alert for my own safety, I might’ve carried on for hours—watching this mythic creature gracefully defy one of nature’s most powerful exhibitions. 

Nimbly, the beast swooped low, this time coming to face me—and my fascination was promptly replaced with horror as I realized it had spotted me. I stood and readied myself, unsheathing my only weapon in the process: a priest-blessed Kukri. I’d never used the blade before, but had practiced with it for countless hours, and was confident that I could at least inflict considerable—if not fatal—harm against the black-hooded rider.  

But as the wyrm drew nearer, gliding silently above the lightning-scorched earth, panic bloomed within my chest. I had heard stories of it, had seen crude drawings and carving depicting its monstrous visage and lethality—but to see it in person, to face its raw, animal malignance, was something else entirely. My body trembled, and though I raised the blade in preparation to strike, I felt no sense of fortitude; as if my vitality and hardihood had been drained from me by its piercing, quintuply-eyed gaze.  

And then the thing was upon me.  

In any other circumstances, I would’ve been swept up in its massive jaws and summarily devoured, or stricken down by its elven rider, who wielded a savage polearm of some kind. But just as the great draconic fiend was about to clench its jaws around my waist, lightning struck its back—nearly severing one of its massive, sorcerously-wrought wings. The lightning-loosed appendage crumpled and stiffened, and the beast involuntarily swerved at the last moment; colliding with the Earth and sliding several feet to my right. Its rider was flung from atop its back, landing even farther away.  

Knowing that the wyrm was not permanently felled and would rise again—perhaps even more ferocious than before—I quickly capitalized on the providential opportunity and ran to the unseated rider. Before he could stand and ready himself or call for the assistance of his eldritch steed, I leapt and plunged my kukri into his chest; and like a fiend cast into a scope of heavenly light, the elfin terror let out a wild, agonized scream; and then lay still upon the blackened Earth. A moment later, his body began to boil thickly and repugnantly. And after only seconds, all that remained were his black cowl and robes.  

It was finished, I had finally slain the devil who’d killed my family. Now I had only the unwholesome beast with which to contend.  

Turning, I came to face a truly horrific and entirely unexpected sight: the beast was in the process of tearing away its own blasted wing. It had risen to stand upon its hindlegs, aping the posture of a man. With one hand braced against a thigh to steady itself, it gripped the wounded wing with the other; attempting to pry it loose from the resilient connective tissue. Bewildered and horrified, I was unable to move, unable to do anything beyond watch this darkly marveling moment of self-mutilation.  

Finally, coeval with a brilliant flash of lightning in the distance, the beast wrenched the wing from its back. The resultant roar of pain was deafening, out-sounding the lightning’s belated thunder-clap. Still standing in an uncannily bipedal fashion, the wyrm then held aloft the severed limb, and as if on cue, a bolt of lightning struck it. The wing was set ablaze, and the wyrm brought it down level with its chest, gripping the bloody stump with its other hand.  

This image—the beast’s eerily warrior-like stature—instantly chilled my blood, and freed my mind of any delusions regarding a possible triumph against the horror. It had ripped free its crippled wing so that it could use it as a *flaming weapon*—broad, lightning-lit, and axe-like.  

Another flash of lightning showed an indescribably Hadean visage, snarling abominably but also bearing the faintest hint of a victorious sneer. It knew that it had won, that there was no way I’d be able to contend with it now.  

Petrified, tired, partially deafened from the incessant meteorological violence, I stood and awaited my fate; preferring to face it head-on rather than try and flee only to be cut down mid-flight. I remembered the saying, “Why run? You’ll only die tired.” and let out a short, sardonic laugh. Perhaps thinking that I was mocking its makeshift weaponry, the beast let out a smoldering puff of smoke from its broad nostrils, and raised the weapon high above its head—meaning to bring it crashing down upon me in a fiery strike.  

that was when I saw, for the first time, the football-sized hole in its chest.  

The cavity was natural, red-rimmed and pinkly fleshed, not something that had been made by an injury; and I quickly surmised that it was an orifice of some kind—perhaps related to its primary, levitation-like mode of flight. No longer wanting to die without offering some kind of struggle, I picked up the elf’s discarded polearm, drew it back, and tossed it toward the chest-hole - just as the blazing wing-axe came swooping down. 

My preternatural luck was in still effect: the polearm flew spear-like right into the cavity, and the beast shrieked madly, as if pierced in a vital spot. Its strike was diverted, landing a few feet astray of my body.  

Still, the impact against the ground sent me tumbling to my knees, and the outburst of flames nearly burned away my flesh. But I was, thankfully, otherwise unharmed. The beast, however, had not been so lucky, and flailed wildly before me; dropping its wing-axe and clawing frantically at its torso. But the weapon had gone deep into its body, irretrievably propelled therein, or involuntarily suctioned in place by the orifice itself. Regardless, the beast’s clawing only served to further injure it; and before long its chest was a mess of bloody tatters.  

With a defeated, pitifully weak whimper, it fell backwards onto its remaining wings.  

Fatefully drawn there by the deeply embedded weapon—or maybe even guided there by Empyrean hands—a bolt of lightning shot down from the darkly lit heavens, striking the beast in its ragged chest. There was no bestial cry of pain or shock—it simply died that instant; the lightning exploding most of its body, sending scales and even molten gore in every direction.  

A moment later, its steaming body underwent the same rapid decomposition its rider had undergone; leaving only a massive, oily stain upon the already pitch-black earth. For a brief moment, I marveled at how so much mass could simply disappear, and then turned around. I had fortuitously come away from an impossible battle unscathed, and was tired. As the weather raged overhead, I sheathed my kukri and started on my way back home.

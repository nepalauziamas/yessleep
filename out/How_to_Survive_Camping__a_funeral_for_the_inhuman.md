I run a private campground.  It’s mostly forest and open field, but here’s a handful of houses that belong to my family.  There is also a graveyard.  It is surrounded by a wooden fence and ‘no trespassing’ signs to keep the campers out.  Only members of my family are buried there, but after [one of the musicians was thrown through my window](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/lf32km/how_to_survive_camping_old_habits_die_hard/), I felt it only right to make an exception.

If you’re new here, you should really [start at the beginning](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/clp5h4/how_to_survive_camping/), and if you’re totally lost, [this might help](https://www.reddit.com/r/goatvalleycampgrounds/comments/fz6a1d/how_to_survive_camping_index/).

The family graveyard was started because the town whispered that our family was tainted by the evil we associated with.  This was before even Mattias’s time, but those sentiments echoed through the generations.  We stand apart from the good, decent (hah) folk of the town, aloof and rejected because of the company we keep.  The touch of the inhuman rests upon us, they whisper.  Stained with evil from our proximity to evil.  Those rumors persist even now, though in less hostile ways.  The tradition of using the family graveyard remains.

We’ve had our share of funerals on this land.  My parents’ funeral was held here, such as it was.  There was no ceremony.  No viewing of the body.  My mother had died gruesomely and there was hardly anything left of my father to look at.  The extended family gathered and we put their casket in the ground - a single casket, for the both of them - and then we filled the grave up again.  There weren't a lot of people talking.  My aunt and uncle stayed close to me and kept most of the well-wishers away.  I didn’t need to hear what a tragedy it was, that I’d lost my parents so young.  I already knew.  I knew all too well.

And then that was it.  We buried the dead and then we moved on.  Or tried to, at least.

I heard my mother’s side of the family held their own funeral.  A small gathering at the church.  I didn’t attend.

We buried my aunt and uncle much the same way.  Sometimes I feel our grieving never ends.  It just pauses for a few years or more, until the land claims another life.  I wonder if it will be different, when this land is fully ancient and I’ve installed as benign a ruler as I can.  Perhaps our long watch will end and we can finally feel our sorrow in full.

There was another funeral, the day after the musician was thrown through my window.  I wanted to return its body to the dancers, but I could not find them.  And worse, the body was decomposing.  Rapidly.  I’d wrapped the body tightly in a tarp and left it outside, as the cold would preserve it while I searched.  When I returned for lunch, I found the tarp had flattened and a noxious bile was leaking out the edges.  I pressed on the tarp, gently, and even the bones felt spongy.  There wasn’t a lot of time before the body collapsed entirely.

It didn’t feel right, just letting that happen.  We try to burn the creatures we kill.  It’s not just a way to dispose of the corpse.  My father believed it was the last dignity we could afford them.  He tried to impress that upon me as a child, but it never really took.  Standing there in the cold and the snow and staring at the musician that had saved my life and paid for it with its own, I think I understood better.  I couldn’t let it simply rot away.  But nor did I have the time to locate the dancers.

I would bury it myself.  And perhaps to console my conscience, I would give it the most revered burial I could.

I called up the nearby farming supply store and rented a small backhoe.  Tore out part of the graveyard fence to get it in and then ripped up enough frozen dirt to make a six foot deep grave in the middle of an especially cold winter.

While I was doing all of this, Bryan came around.  He’s been doing as I asked and staying out of the deep woods.  He asked what I was doing and then went away for a bit and came back with a coffin assembled out of scrap lumber.  Then the old sheriff drove up, having been notified by a phone call from Bryan.

And the three of us had a funeral.

There wasn’t much said.  Bryan and I struggled to drag the coffin all the way from the house to the grave once the musician was inside.  We didn’t let the old sheriff help, on account of his leg.  We were worn out and panting by the time we got it down into the grave and none of us wanted to talk.  We just stood there, staring down into the hole, and the old sheriff passed a flask around.  When we’d all had a drink, he poured the rest of it into the grave, letting it splatter on the uneven wood casket.

I felt I should say something.  I cleared my throat uncomfortably.

“Thanks,” I said.  “For saving my life.”

And that was it.  I filled the hole back up, Bryan helped me stomp the dirt down, and we put the fence back.  Then we all went our separate ways.

A few days later, the old sheriff returned.  He brought with him a wooden grave marker, heavily sealed to survive the weather.  No name, just a date of death and some floral patterns decorating the top.  His wife made it, he said.  She’d recently taken up wood burning.  I could put it up in the spring when the ground softened.

Then he cleared his throat uncomfortably and said he was also here on official business.  I suggested we move to my office.  This was going to be an unpleasant conversation and I did not want to ruin the times he came over for coffee and we sat at the kitchen table and talked.  He followed me, reluctantly, for I think merely moving us to the office was enough to indicate that I already knew what he was here for.

“The police found a body,” he said as he settled himself in front of the desk.  “It was in an unusual state.”

“Completely drained of blood?”

He raised an eyebrow.  I sighed.

“It’s Beau.”

I told him what happened.  How he emptied his cup killing the thorns and how I’d taken him off the campground to refill it.  Blood forcibly taken and all.  I was concerned for my staff, I explained, and didn’t want him to attack one of them.  I’d hoped he’d find someone aggravating, as he had in the past, and terrorize them a bit and leave with the blood he needed.

“But you knew this might end up with someone dead?” he asked.

“I knew.”

He sighed and looked away.  His gaze settled on the blank spot on the wall, where my parents had hoped my diploma would someday hang.

“I don’t know what to say to you right now,” he said softly.  “I’d hoped… you’d be better than your parents.  I guess not.”

“What else do I do?” I asked wildly.  “I need Beau’s help.  I don’t know what those thorns were doing to my land - or to the fairy.  They haven’t attacked the fomorian yet and that worries me.  Think about what may happen if the fomorian wins!”

He was quiet for a long moment.

“The town is going to hold you responsible,” he finally said.

“Fine.  I *am* responsible.  I don’t deny that.  But I have *never* seen any of them offering to help out here.  The only time I’m dragged in front of that town hall is to accuse me.”

Not that I’ve ever asked for help.  But there’s bad blood there and the old sheriff knows it.  Sometimes I think that’s why he’s always been sympathetic to my family, because his position allowed him to be here to help us when no one else would.

“In centuries past the towns had to have a hangman,” he sighed.  “No one liked the hangman, though he was considered essential.”

He pushed his chair back and stood.

“I guess your family is our hangman.”

“What will you tell them?”

“The truth.  And I’ll make sure they understand how desperately you need any help you can get right now, or the town will face an evil beyond anything we’ve experienced before.  But Kate, I need you to do one thing for me.”

He named it.  I couldn’t answer him and he didn’t demand a response.  He just took his coat and left.

He asked that when this was all done, that I consider Beau.  That I consider what he was, what he did, and decide if he should be added to my list.

The list of creatures I intend to kill.

I didn’t want to tell him that it might be unnecessary.  The fomorian’s threat hung heavy over my head.

The next day I went into the deep woods to look for Beau.  I didn’t dare summon him.  Perhaps the fomorian was watching the house, knowing that I might do so.  It felt like a reasonable precaution, considering the circumstances.  If I were in the deep woods, however, he could choose whether it was safe to approach me or not.

I didn’t find Beau.  Instead, the dancers found me.

They came up from behind.  I turned and waited for them, as initially they were grouped close together and I could not see what they carried.  They were somber, dressed in black with veils over their heads and faces.  Mourning the loss of their musician.  I felt I should at least offer my condolences and explain where I’d buried the body.

I didn’t get a chance.  The procession drew to a halt as it came close.  The lead dancer held up a finger when I made to speak, indicating that I should be silent.    She sidled up beside me and looped her arm through mine.  Like we were friends.  Bemused, I let her escort me to the group, assuming this was some kind of mourning ritual and I was being included.

Unfortunately, I was correct.

If I’d known what *role* they wanted me to take, I might not have waited for them on the road.

The group parted to reveal what they’d been carrying in the middle of all of them.  A coffin.  Constructed of wood and covered in rainbow glitter.  It sat on the ground, presumably because the dancers carrying it wanted a short reprieve, and I crept closer to inspect it out of curiosity.  One of them kicked the lid off so I could look inside.

Empty.  The interior was covered in glitter as well and I had to admire their dedication.

Well, I admired it for a couple seconds, at least, until two of the dancers shoved me from behind.  My shins caught against the side and I went down face-first - directly into the open coffin.  The glitter dug into my palms as I tried to catch myself, but a lid slammed down on my back before I could push myself out again.  I pounded on the bottom, the sides, and kicked my heels against the lid, but nothing gave.  Then it lurched, swayed, and I braced myself on the sides, heart pounding at the sudden movement.

The swaying settled into a rhythm.  They were carrying it.  And all around me I heard noise - crying, wailing.  Sobs.  A raucous commotion, utterly unlike the silent and grim funerals my family held.  The dancers seemed determined to let the entire campsite know of their loss.

The longer it went on, the more panicked I grew.  This was not my first time being trapped in a grave, but it was certainly the more claustrophobic of the two occurrences.  I closed my eyes and tried to imagine I was elsewhere, that it didn’t matter that there was only an inch or two of clearance around my entire body.  I told myself that I was safe in my own bed, that the wailing I heard was that of the little girl.  Whatever trick of the mind I could conjure to stave off the screaming panic that hovered at the edge of my thoughts.

I couldn’t focus entirely on staying calm, however.  What if they intended to bury me alive?  Or worse - and I began to break into a cold sweat at this thought - turn me into a replacement musician.  The harvesters came to my mind, them and their cursed raincoats.  Perhaps they weren’t the only creatures around here that could replenish their ranks.  I ran my fingers along the seam, searching for a weak point.  The glitter stung as it dug into the skin under my fingernails.  I found nothing.  I twisted, trying to find a better position so I could leverage an elbow or *something* to smash against the lid of the coffin.  It dipped to one side, swaying like a boat in a storm as the dancers carrying it struggled to adjust to my shifting body weight.  I seized on this idea.  Maybe I could force them to drop it.  I twisted again, slamming my shoulder against the opposite side.

“You’re making this hard to carry, Kate,” a familiar voice said from just outside the wooden box.

The former sheriff.

“Uh, do you know if they’re going to… kill me?” I asked.

He just laughed.  It’s not a reassuring response, but I felt somewhat mollified by his presence nonetheless.  The former sheriff was no longer fully human, but I hope that he’s retained enough of it to not let me die needlessly.  He’s tried to save me from them before.

I stopped struggling.  The only thing it was really accomplishing was bringing glitter raining down all over me, anyway.  Eventually, the coffin was gently lowered to stable ground.  I let out a slow breath, trying to loosen my muscles, waiting to see what would happen next.

The coffin lid was pried off.  It landed heavily on the ground.  I rolled over, struggling to lever myself up over the sides.  The lead dancer stood at the foot of the coffin, holding out a hand to help me up.  I stared at it suspiciously for a moment.

“Surely you want out before we bury it?” she asked.

That got me moving.  I clasped my hand in hers and she hoisted me free.  I glanced around while I vainly tried to brush glitter off my jacket.  I was *covered* in it and if you’re wondering, yes, I’m finding it all over the house now.

We were in the dancer’s favorite clearing.  The largest one, near the steepest hill that we’d used to take the wagon away from the children.  They’d dug a grave close by where the bonfire usually goes, in which they were preparing to bury an empty coffin.

“I’m sorry about not returning the musician’s body,” I said unsteadily.  “I didn’t know what else to do with it.”

“Oh that’s nothing to apologize for.  You buried it according to your own customs and that it *had* a funeral is all that matters.  This is just us having a bit of fun is all.”

Fun.  Right.

I watched them lower the coffin into the pit.  I still didn’t know what I was doing here, but at least I wasn’t going to be buried alive.  The old sheriff helped, but he didn’t pay me any special attention.  I was okay with that.  We were never friends, anyway.

“Ah, good, our other guest is here,” the lead dancer said, turning to face the edge of the clearing.  “We can conduct our business before the ceremony.”

Beau had just arrived.  He stepped out from between the trees and crossed the clearing as the dancers arranged themselves opposite him.  I felt uneasy, like I was watching a supernatural showdown forming up.  It was clear from the expression on Beau’s face that he wasn’t pleased to be here, and considering how rarely he showed emotion, that was certainly saying something.  His lips were thin with distaste and his eyes were narrowed, his brow furrowed.

“We’re all in agreement, then?” the lead dancer asked neatly.  “Something has to be done about the fomorian?”

“But the fairy-” I began.

“Is taking too long.”  She was curt with her interruption.  “They are not able to kill the fomorian yet and so they’re biding their time, waiting for the right opportunity.  It’s a stalemate and perhaps that is acceptable for them, but *we* are suffering for it.  So are you, yes?”

I nodded.  Yes.  This was a problem all of us faced.  I felt a thrill of excitement in my veins.  This wasn’t just a funeral.  The inhuman entities were convening a war council of their own and I had been invited.

“You’re trapped here just as Beau is,” I said on a hunch.  “You have to stop the fomorian because you can’t leave.”

“Nor would we want to leave, even if we could.  It’s nice here.”

No one had any solid plans on how to kill the fomorian.  The lead dancer and Beau avoided that topic and I suspect they too are waiting on the fairy to make their move.  But in the meantime, they would do what they could to mitigate the damage and keep the land from falling into the fomorian’s sway.  Keeping the thorns at bay would be Beau’s responsibility.  I requested that perhaps we think of a way to stop them from being sown at all, so that Beau didn’t need to refill his cup so often.

“That’s not possible,” the lead dancer replied sharply.  “None of us are up to the task of standing against the fomorian.  It is what it is and you must accept that.”

The curse of the inhuman, being subject to the rules of their world.  And the only weapon of humanity, to be able to dream a world different than what it is.  It wouldn’t occur to them to defy the natural order in which the fomorian was more powerful than they.  Still, I didn’t pursue that any further.  They’d already lost one of their musicians aiding me.

The dancers would help keep track of the fomorian’s movements.  They weren’t being targeted by it like Beau was.  The musician’s death was a singular retribution for a specific action.

And as for me… well, they didn’t actually know what to do with me yet.  I felt a little offended.

“Just… go be... *you* at the fomorian,” she finally said in exasperation.  “It seems to work well.”

This wasn’t the only outcome of the meeting, of course.  I brought up some suggestions, inquiring about other uses of the stone in particular.  Neither Beau nor the dancers seemed willing to give it up.  The stone was their defense against the thorns and those were their primary concern.  I also got the impression that Beau and the dancers don’t get along and the fact they were speaking to each other at all was a significant first step.

Also, the meeting was adjourned early.

A whistle came from the tree canopy.  Beau and I pivoted to look, but I saw nothing.  I wondered if it was one of the musicians, recalling how easily the one had scaled the tree when rescuing me.

“It’s coming,” the lead dancer said tersely.  “Bad luck, I suppose.  Or it’s hunting you.”

She nodded at Beau.  He inclined his head softly in respect and stepped backwards.

“It is time to go, then.  Thank you for the warning.”

He turned and walked swiftly away.  No sooner had he stepped out of the clearing and back into the woods than the lead dancer rounded on me.

“You can’t be here either,” she said.

“Sure, I’m leaving too.  Just point me in the opposite direction of the fomorian.”

“Oh no.  That won’t work.  You’re human.  You’re slow and you’re *far* too noisy.  Get in the coffin.”

“What?”

“Coffin!  Hide!”

Her panicked tone got me moving.  I dropped into the pit and hastily lay down inside the beglittered coffin.  Two of the dancers dropped the lid down on top of it and the darkness swallowed me up.  I held very still, breathing shallowly, as the ground shook with the fomorian’s approach.

The voices were muted at first.  The lead dancer, speaking in a conciliatory and subservient tone.  Then the fomorian’s rumbling voice, clearly audible through the wood of the coffin.

“You wouldn’t defy me, would you?”

“Of course not,” the lead dancer replied in a clear, smooth voice.

Could inhuman things lie to other inhuman things?  Was it only humans that compelled them to speak something close to the truth?  I felt a flicker of hope that maybe we’d get out of this alive.

A moment of silence.  Then, the startled cry of the lead dancer, echoed swiftly by her followers.  The clearing went still and quiet again, save for the sound of plaintive choking from the lead dancer.  I balled my hands into fists, my nails biting into my palms, seething in helpless rage.

I guess they *can* lie to each other, but it’s not very effective.

There was the sound of a body hitting the ground.

“I’ll ask again.  You wouldn’t defy me, would you?”

I strained to listen, trying to hear what was being said over the beating of my own heart.

“N-no.”  She coughed.  “I wouldn’t dare.”

“But you *did* dare.”

The ground shook.  I held my breath.  It was coming closer.  For a moment, nothing - and then -

The coffin snapped all around me.  I threw up my arms with a cry, shielding myself from the shrapnel as sunlight came streaming in.  Then a shadow covered me as the fomorian’s hand pressed past the shattered wood and wrapped its fingers around my chest.  It lifted me up, the debris of the coffin sliding away and falling back into the pit.  It held me in midair, dangling like a doll, and ponderously turned to face the dancers.  It held me aloft for them all to see.

Beneath me the dancers were all on their knees.  The lead dancer had a hand to her throat where I could see bruises already forming from where the fomorian had choked her.

“This one is mine,” it growled.

It shook me, hard enough to send my head spinning and to rattle my teeth against each other.  I clung desperately to the creature’s bony hand, feeling like I was about to be torn apart by the violent movement.

“I was going to kill her on sight, but then she angered me, and now that will no longer suffice.  I will destroy everything she cares about first.  Until then-”

It released me and I landed in a heap on the ground, wheezing in pain from the impact.  I struggled to pull my legs underneath me, to at least drag myself to my knees.

“-she is not to be touched.  Do you understand?”

“Of course.”

The lead dancer was careful to keep her gaze on the ground.  She did not look at either me or the fomorian.

It turned and limped away.  The trees creaked and cracked as it forced its way through them.  No one in the clearing moved or even spoke until the trembling of the ground under its footsteps stilled entirely.  Only then did the lead dancer give a sigh of relief.

“Lucky us that it thought we were trying to kill you instead of conspiring together,” she sighed.

“Lucky me that it wants me to suffer first,” I replied.

We both sat there for a moment, contemplating how close we’d each come to death.  Finally, I tentatively asked if this meant the alliance was off.  After all, it seemed the fomorian was willing to go after them for any suspected defiance.  The dancer only laughed.

“What did we do when you tried to drive us out?” she demanded.

“Uh, you dragged me from my house and forced me to dance until I collapsed.”

“*Exactly.*”

I guess it’s all fun and games until someone threatens their party, and then the knives come out.  Good to know.

“Still,” the dancer said thoughtfully.  “We’ll have to be careful when we interact with Beau, since we’re also under watch by the fomorian.”

“Beau?”

“We have little to do with each other and no reason to help one another.  A condition of this… alliance… was that we use his fledgling name.”

“He’s *such* a bastard,” I muttered.

The lead dancer nodded sagely in agreement.

“That he is.”

There was no other reason for me to stay, after that.  The dancers had a funeral to hold, even if they were burying the shattered remains of an empty coffin.  And I had to go stand in the shower for however many hours it took to get all the glitter out of my hair.  Before I went, however, I decided to seize the opportunity to ask a question that’s been bothering me for many, many years now.

“Hey, since we’ve got a working relationship now, can I ask you something?” I said.  “What… are you?”

She seemed perplexed by my question.

“We’re dancers,” she said.  “We heal people.”

“And the people you kill?”

“We heal them too.”

I remembered the former sheriff, dousing a camper with gasoline.  He'd said some people don't want to be cured.

In some cultures, dancing is used as a cure from affliction.  But if the affliction is in the soul, a flaw of character, then I suppose death is a remedy of sorts.

“Would you kill me, if I were not marked for death by the beast?” I asked.

She looked me straight in the eyes.

“Do you really want to know the answer to that?”

Her tone was sharp.  A warning.  My voice faltered and she gave me a thin smile.

“No.  You don’t.”  And she walked away.

I’m a campground manager.  At one point, Beau said that I have a weak will.  I don’t think the dancer refused to answer because I wouldn’t like what I heard.  She refused to answer because I was afraid that she would.  I would rather be left wondering than bear the weight of knowing for certain what kind of person I am.  Both answers are dangerous.  One invites complacency.  The other; self-hatred.

Maybe someday I’ll be strong enough to know.  Maybe when this is all over.  For now, I don’t have the luxury of self-doubt or introspection.

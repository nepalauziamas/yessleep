[PART ONE OF TWO](https://www.reddit.com/r/DrCreepensVault/comments/u2ptnm/obsession_a_dark_and_unsettling_psychological/)

*‘That special night.’*

I was already on the bus when Dennis sat down a few seats in front of me, and he was right on time as always. The aroma from his recent portion of chips pervaded my nostrils as it filtered from his old puffer jacket. I watched him from the corner of my eye, and my heart was steady, poised. It never missed a beat. His body language had most definitely altered. Something about the way he moved was all wrong. He was restless throughout the entire bus journey, and it seemed like something was quite obviously playing on his mind. I began to sense fear in him. As I said before, I was tuned in. But there was something else festering between the scent of his cheap aftershave and the vinegar from his chips. It was potent, and I could almost taste it. It was like an old, well-used sock, saturated in thick oily sweat. I knew it came from him, and it satisfied me with an intensity I hadn’t felt before. A broad grin stretched across my face, and a slight murmur left my lips. The noise of the bus as it rocked and groaned was just enough to cover my rising excitement. The more I breathed in this new scent, the more aroused I became, and I had to close my eyes and bite my tongue for fear of screaming out in ecstasy.

I almost misjudged the stop and had to quickly stand up to follow Dennis as he departed the bus. Stepping out onto the street as the doors closed behind me, I decided to sit on a bench to ponder my next manoeuvre. Something had wriggled into my mind from out of the night. A wild certainty, which I can only describe as that moment of fight or flight. As though I was standing on a cliff edge, ready to jump into the unknown. My senses heightened to a new level, and it felt as though the world was closing in tight around me. Nervous energy bubbled within me like acid, and I could taste the metallic hint of my blood as I gritted my teeth together.

The bus pulled away with a hiss, and I watched Dennis from my peripheral vision. Now, usually, he would head straight across the street towards the park, but this time, he hesitated. It was as though he couldn't decide whether to make the journey through the darkened park or avoid it altogether. I prayed for the former. 

Choosing neither option, it seemed, he suddenly turned towards a pub that faced the park from the other side of the road. It was a pub he had frequented once or twice before, for little more than a soft drink at the bar before he continued his journey home. Initially, I panicked but soon realised that his need for refreshment would give me some extra time to hide in the park and quietly await his presence. I had conscientiously planned everything out, as always, so I was ready for the moment to present itself.

*‘Tonight was the night’.*

I waited until he was deep inside the bar before deciding it would be too much of a wasted opportunity not to try and see how close I could get to him. To stand near him in the bar, without him noticing me. You must understand, I wanted to relish this moment.

Various scents, some fresh and others musk, permeated my lungs as I entered the pub. To keep my burning desires at bay, I had practised deep breathing techniques, which I employed to control my creeping desires. Perfume and aftershaves sprayed heavily over casual clothing did little to mask the smell of smoke and piss, which intensified as I approached the bar. I could see Dennis through the busy crowd ordering his drink. I had never seen him with any friends—something else we both had in common. So I had little concern that he would engage in conversation with anyone. As I approached him, I gazed at the back of his head and dared him to look around and see me. I wanted him to acknowledge somehow the potent mixture of rage and excitement I exuded. He stirred a little but didn’t turn in my direction. If such a thing as telepathy existed, he would have left that bar immediately and headed straight to the police. 

I planned to position myself next to him at the bar and order a drink of my own. I wanted to stand beside him and enjoy my drink without glancing in his direction as I marked my territory. More importantly, I wanted him to notice my blazing aura and recognise it later when we met for the first and final time, flesh to flesh. Choking back a giggle, I continued my approach.

Dennis quietly sipped his drink as I manoeuvred into position beside him. I ordered myself a small coke which was more for a prop than anything else to help me blend in. But in his presence, and as the blood rushed furiously through my body, I began to feel lightheaded and nauseous, so the cold and sweet drink was a welcome respite to my condition.

We stood side by side at the bar as though companions. The ambience of the pub was undisturbed by the unseen certainty that exuded from us both as we drank. Groups of friends engaged in murmured conversation as frantic bar staff rushed around to keep the thirsty clientele happy. And there I stood, exactly where I wanted to be, poised and ready, soaking in the nourishment that exuded from Dennis Palmer's pores. I sucked the scent of his aftershave deep into my lungs which caused my heart to pump with absolute ferocity. Fresh and minty, but not enough to mask the underlying smoky and meaty odour which oozed from his unlaundered clothing and decaying breath. I trembled violently with anticipation, and my body shivered, which caused me to panic for a moment. Part of me wanted Dennis to accept his fate, but at the same time, I didn’t wish him to become aware of my rising, undoubtedly palpable excitement. I didn’t want to give the entire game away, you see. But he continued to gaze straight ahead, only occasionally lifting his glass lazily to his mouth to take a sip. It began to frustrate me. It perplexed me even. Here I was, his executioner, standing right beside him with the sickle, and he didn't even have the curiosity to acknowledge me?

‘*Flesh is just flesh.’*

My rage became laced with searing adrenaline, and I had to take a few deep breaths to compose myself. I decided to try and force my sly plan into Dennis's subconscious one last time, just to give him an echo of a chance. I wanted him to be scared, and I craved to smell the depths of his fear. I yearned to feel and taste the life escaping him, and that's when I decided to use my bare hands to kill him later instead of using the hammer I had hidden in the park. I wanted to feel the energy leaving him as I bathed in the warm flavours of his demise. To fill my entire body with the poison of his terror would satisfy me immensely. I compelled him to sense those thoughts, but he remained absolutely and deathly still. There might as well have been a brick wall between us, just like the one which offered me a sanctuary to listen to the pleasing sounds of pain and fear from my neighbour several months earlier. Unluckily for Dennis, however, he had no such wall to hide behind. 

I shook my head mockingly before deciding it was time to leave the bar. It was time to get ready. I finished my drink before glancing back at Dennis, who remained utterly unphased in his ignorance. Locked in his little world, he was oblivious to the reality unfolding around him. I scowled as a mixture of compulsion and delirium hit my brain like a generous shot of cheap whiskey.

'Just you wait,’ I murmured under my breath on departure from the vibrant climate of the bar to the quiet stillness of the night outside. My breath misted as it met the cold, but inside I burned like a furnace. Every fibre in my being was crammed full of an unrelenting and menacing rage for Dennis Palmer. The warm trembling excitement from earlier was hidden underneath this new layer of poised and frenzied wrath. 

‘*How dare he not acknowledge me?’*

The street was still and partially vacant outside. From across the road, the pitch blackness of the park looked terminally uninviting to the sparse amount of people who went about their business. No one seemed encouraged to consider wandering through at this hour of the night. Paranoia was hidden in the darkness for many, but I felt more alive than ever underneath its veil. I didn’t want to waste another moment, so I quickly jogged across the road and went straight through the open gate between the surrounding hedgerows.

The park swallowed me under a protective cloak of darkness that denied entry to the weak beams of the surrounding streetlights. High trees blotted out all but occasional stray headlights from the passing cars; the murmurs of their engines a dull white noise from within the enclosure of thick trees and dense bushes. Deep in the park by the lake was my destination. Far enough away from the buzz of the residential areas, it was perfect for what I had planned. I could feel a warm glow of excitement battling it out with the unrelenting rage in my stomach. It was a curious sensation. One I can sincerely recommend.

I knew every inch of the park by heart. The lake was deep in the centre of the public gardens, and there were numerous bushes amongst the tree lines to hide in. I headed towards a tall and thick tree that commanded the area across from the lake. The tree loomed over several bushes basking under its deep shadow—a prime position for me to await my prey. I crouched low and looked back in the direction of the pub.

Dennis would be arriving soon, and I remained deathly still. It was essential to stay relaxed and maintain control. I had even rehearsed my crouching position so that I wouldn't get stiff joints; that would slow me down. No, I was conditioned for this. I was calibrated right into this moment. The park itself was masked in silence as though fearful of uttering even the slightest breath. Only an occasional shuffling of the nocturnal wildlife disturbed the evening. 

*I waited.* 

From a short distance away, careful footsteps whispered in the darkness. It was like shambling at first, but then I could sense a presence that was trying its hardest not to be heard in the tranquillity of the evening. Someone approached stealthily but deliberately. Closing my eyes, I focussed on the sounds of the footfall, and the fire in my belly told me that Dennis Palmer was nearing my position. I knew the pace of his walk, and I could also recognise the rhythm of his breathing. The night was impenetrable beside the lake, but I had the advantage. My eyes were conditioned to this darkness, and I had the element of surprise.

As Dennis continued his approach, I remained perfectly still, my breathing slow, measured and steady. Dennis was only a few metres from where I crouched, and I poised like a coiled spring ready to go off. I decided to let him walk a little bit past me before I would make my move. I wanted to smell those unlaundered clothes under a mask of cheap aftershave and the sweat draining from his pores just one last time before I acted.

The smell of his fragrance eventually hit my lungs with aromatic citrus notes. A smile stretched across my cheeks, and my body shuddered. But it was the scent of his unwashed and disgusting body that caused me to become frenzied. Bloodlust consumed me as a red mist flashed in front of my eyes. Inebriated with previously unimaginable fury, I moved quickly and aggressively. My furious onslaught must have been deafening. Saliva dripped from my open mouth as I snarled and lashed out at Dennis, knocking him to the floor as he crunched awkwardly underneath my body. My hands repeatedly crashed violently onto his face, and his pathetic and useless resistance fuelled my rage even further. Slapping his feeble arms to one side, I clasped my hands tightly around his throat.

His slim neck pulsed and strained under my fierce grip, and I could finally smell his fear. That beautiful unspoiled scent. It hit me hard and deep in the lungs, making me convulse. Faeces, piss, and body odour drained from his pores as his dying wretched body purged itself in retaliation. Dennis weakly lashed out with his arms as he tried to grab at me, but his efforts were useless. My eyes stretched wide enough to tear at the edges as I clamped down harder, using my body weight as leverage. His struggle weakened further, and his arms fell limply beside him. My jaw tightened with such a ferocity that it felt as though my teeth would snap, and my hands seemed to have grown more prominent as his neck tightened under my crunching grip. I worked with such an enhanced power that I could feel my fingers connect at both sides of his pitiful neck as I squeezed and squeezed and squeezed. 

I cannot say how long I remained there, throttling his lifeless throat before I finally began to release my grip. I was far too dizzy and high on the fumes of his demise to worry, and at that moment, I wasn’t concerned about getting caught. It was as though I just wanted someone to find us tangled up in that horrific scene. But not, of course, to seek validation; I just wanted the moment to be authentic. As I stood above my victim, I smiled proudly, taking a huge breath to recharge my lungs. Immense satisfaction coursed throughout my pumping veins and a warm sweat seeped from every aperture in my body as I absorbed the fruits of my labour. From my loins, that familiar and welcome arousal pulsated against my jeans. I didn’t even need to unfasten my trousers to relieve the tension, and my body shuddered in absolute ecstasy.

The corpse of Dennis Palmer lay at my feet as though nothing more than a darkened shadow. The dim glow of the moon seemed reluctant to venture anywhere near us and chose instead to remain impartially distant from the wrath I had just inflicted. My heartbeat eventually began to slow down, and at that moment, I suddenly began to feel strangely exposed. An icy cold seemed to have sneaked up on me without warning, and the warmth from my recent exertion swiftly faded away. 

*Paranoia?* 

A creeping and reaching sensation then caused the hair on my back to prickle as if in response to static. I glanced around in panic at the surrounding area. A bold silence filled the night, and my eyes observed nothing more than the stark formality of the darkened and uninhabited park. Other than Dennis lying dead at my feet, I was alone, but I began to notice something that profoundly unsettled me. My eyes widened in response to a slight movement from just below one of the trees back towards the entrance. Something unnatural stirred in the shadows underneath that tree. Something that’s presence filled me with a severe and choking terror. As I watched in horror, the gloom seemed to swirl for a few moments before transforming into a more human-looking form. Whatever it was, it stood utterly and defiantly still as it gazed in my direction.

I relaxed slightly, realising that I was entirely bathed in the shade of the trees and therefore hidden from prying eyes. Even if I could be seen, maybe this unwelcome figure was just as fearful of my shadow as I was of its. But then it occurred to me, how long had it been standing there for? What if it had been watching me this whole time? Quietly and carefully, I stepped back behind the hedge and gazed back to where it stood. I couldn’t see it from where I crouched, but I knew it to be still there. Menacing eyes penetrated the silence without care for the darkness I tried to hide within. I sensed the sudden arrival of imminent doom as a voice inside me started to bellow.

'*Just run. Get out of here, now!*’

After killing Dennis, my original plan was to simply pull my hood up and jog back to the train station where I had stashed a change of clothes in an old bag. After changing my clothes, I would board the next train as though nothing had happened. The last train of the evening. A plan I had deliberated over meticulously for months. However, that was all before I was faced with the possibility of a witness. Checking my watch, I only had fifteen minutes until my train. I had to vacate the scene imminently. 

I noticed the dull sound of cars passing outside the park grounds behind me, which brought me back to the reality of the situation. It didn't matter if someone was indeed watching from nearby. That was the least of my worries. I had to run.

Easing out from where I crouched, I re-joined the path before glancing back in the direction of my watcher. To my horror, it was still there, but this time it stood closer and much taller. Like any rational person in such a situation, I panicked, and for the first time, I was consumed with real and abject fear. I spun around and sprinted as hard and fast as possible from that place. I raced under the trees and through those park gardens as though my life depended on it. Avoiding the main entrance, I crossed over the grass towards some railings hidden behind a thicket of bushes. Turning my head one last time before I climbed the fence, my heart almost stopped. The shadow had followed me, but it stood entirely still upon my gaze. Almost as though it was convinced, I hadn’t yet seen it. But I had.

Reaching up and over the fence, I vaulted over to land heavily on the pavement below. The street was empty in both directions, but I could hear the distant murmur of approaching cars, so I quickly crossed the road and headed into a side street before anyone could see me. I ran and ran and ran, continuing around several corners before my muscles began to burn. It wasn’t until I slowed my pace to catch my breath that I noticed a cold breeze tickling my neck, which compelled me to turn around. 

Something lurked at the corner of the street I had just departed. My heart froze as I recognised it as the presence that had followed me through the park. Once again, it stopped confrontationally upon my gaze, but it was no longer just a faceless shadow. A streetlight from above illuminated its form and what I saw caused a jolt of screaming fear to blaze throughout my body as though I had been struck by lightning. The twisted face of Dennis Palmer grinned at me from under the streetlight with absolute malice protruding from his eyes. His face contorted terribly under the yellow glow from above.

I had been watching him for months. I knew how he moved. I knew the clothes he wore. But it just couldn't be. I had killed him in the park. So, what the hell was this? This just had to be my imagination. 

Eventually, I managed to turn away from that madness, and I didn’t stop running until I reached the train station. Tears ran down my face, and my insides burned like coals on a furnace. Eventually slowing to a fast stride, I swiftly entered the toilet and immediately threw up into one of the sinks. Checking my watch, I realised that I had only a few more minutes until my train. I was hesitant to waste any more time, so I made for the cubicle and stepped up onto the cistern. Reaching inside the ceiling panel, I carefully removed my bag. After quickly changing into the clean outfit I had prepared months earlier, I packed away my discarded clothing and placed the bag over my shoulder.

Seconds later, I departed the toilet and headed straight for a seat that I knew to be safe from any cameras in the station. I rechecked my watch. The train would be arriving at any moment. I forced a wry smile; I would be home soon, and it would be as though none of this had ever happened. I just had to relax, and soon all of this would be over. 

As I tried to control my breathing, I could sense its threatening eyes gazing at me from the entrance to the station, but I could not turn in the direction of their stare. I would not. I couldn't bear to see the eyes of Dennis Palmer staring back at me again. Instead, I tried to brush off this notion as fanciful. It just couldn’t be real. Dennis Palmer lay dead in the park. This had to have been a figment of my imagination. *Or maybe it was his ghost?* My heart boomed in my chest like a bass drum. No matter how I tried to relax and control my breathing, his presence remained steadfast and utterly menacing. I could feel him glowering at me, and it occurred to me then that I was the one being stalked. Sweat trickled down my back as the long sinewy fingers of fear tickled my tingling skin.

*Deep breaths in and deep breaths out.*

The train finally approached, and I felt a surge of elation as it slowed to a halt right in front of me. I moved slowly enough to keep an eye on any sudden motion from my pursuer, whose eyes watched me with every step, but it didn’t seem encouraged to follow. Instead, it remained just out of sight, and it wasn’t until I was seated that I decided to glance in its direction to confirm if it was still there.

The train doors closed, but my eyes never left the threatening gaze of Dennis Palmer, who watched me, and the train pulling out of the station. 

In just over an hour, I was back outside my house, and suddenly everything seemed surreal, as though I had been dreaming. Maybe killing Dennis had allowed me access to a twisted dimension. One that I was not yet conditioned enough to endure or comprehend. I dumped my bag of discarded clothing stealthily in one of the neighbour’s bins before entering my front door and finally closing the night outside and behind me. 

Slumping against the door, I went back over every detail from the past few hours. Although shaken quite considerably at being followed, I couldn’t help but feel proud of my achievements. A smile broadened across my face as I re-lived the events at the park, and I chuckled as my mind then wandered back to the vivid memory of the alterations heard from through the wall. Like my neighbour, I had ventured into the unknown to a previously unexplored dimension, so of course, there would be consequences. I looked down at my hands. Hands that had recently strangled the life out of Dennis Palmer. Or had they? Somehow, it all just didn’t seem real.

‘*What happened has happened; there is no turning back now.'*

When my neighbour was arrested for the murder of his wife, her body was carried into an ambulance as I watched. He was now spending the rest of his life in prison for his actions. But at least he knew that it was all real. For my closure, I just needed the corpse of Dennis Palmer to be found because that would confirm that whatever followed me was merely a figment of my imagination. That would make things authentic to me, and that would help balance my fractured mind. This would be all over the news soon, and I could watch everything from the comfort of my own home, protected once more by the concrete walls from the world on the other side. 

It had been a very long and exhausting day, but the work was now done, and I needed to keep things together. I stood up and noticed how weak and drained my body felt. Stretching my arms above my head, I yawned hard and decided that it was time to get some sleep. I couldn’t wait to close my eyes and face whatever vivid dreams lay in store. Grinning wildly, I skipped along the hallway into the bathroom and switched on the light.

A scream immediately stuck in my throat like stubborn vomit that wouldn't shift. At the same time, a sharp gasp came from the face in the mirror as I stared into its manic and terrifying pale blue eyes. Immediately panicking, I lifted my hand to my face to try and conceal the reflection, just for a moment, before slowly sliding my fingers down and past my eyes. 

*‘Oh, dear God, no!’*

Dennis Palmer gazed back defiantly from the mirror in front of me. His smile stretched widely from cheek to cheek, and I completely lost control. I smashed the mirror with my fists until my hands were bloody, and the broken remnants just stared back at me stubbornly from below. His terrible face leered at me from every shard of glass. Dennis Palmer's face, not mine. But how could this be? He grinned at me from every broken fragment scattered on the toilet floor, and his laugh bellowed triumphantly in my ears. 

Within that moment, everything became clear. I had not just opened the door to whatever lurks behind the veil of existence; I had wandered into unknown realms. This experience was merely a symptom of the aftermath and the effect of exposure to this uncharted void. It was all simply too much for my unacclimatised mind to comprehend. My now broken mind, fractured just like the mirror on the floor. I closed my eyes and focussed on my deep breathing exercises, and that's when the answer presented itself. If I couldn't see what was before me, it couldn't make me go crazy.

I used the longest shard of glass to pierce my eyes. The pain was staggering, and I passed out several times before finishing my brutal operation. Blood seeped and squirted from my sockets as I continued to dig the glass in and around to scoop out as much tissue and sinew as possible until I could see no more. And then, with absolute bliss, I retired into a deep and glorious sleep.

I laugh in delight as my recollection now comes to an end. Alone in the darkness of the quiet and peaceful night, my body trembles as I ponder my absolute stroke of genius. The pain is excruciating, but I smile proudly at my achievement. To think of something so precarious just proves how conditioned I now am. And even though I can still smell the faint odour of Dennis and sense his foul presence, I would never again feel his gaze upon me. It would drive him mad to know this, wouldn’t it?

*‘But not me, oh no, not me.’* 

I destroyed my own eyes to prevent myself from going mad. Would a mad person even consider doing that? I think not.

You see, I am not mad.

[DTL 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/v92k7a/it_escaped_1/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=mweb)

It's been a couple hours since my last DTL. We found out that as we were running, one of the armed men had tripped. The entity had caught up to him and ripped him to shreds. We hadn't found out until we heard screams of pain and terror, followed by the loud defeaning screech. Once we had gotten into the van, we immediately drove off. I've conversed with the armed men in the vehicle and learned they are part of a new division in our organization called the "Armed Tactical Forces" (ATF), with their set designation as ATF-24 "Personnelle Recovery".

As we were chatting and driving, we heard the loud screech again. We immediately got out of the vehicle and hid in nearby bushes. We watched as the entity arrived at the van and ripped it in half, eating both halves in one huge chomp. I was able to make out at least 243 sharp and pointed teeth, all made out of a diamond-titanium alloy. The tips were coated with a dark red liquid, dripping down the teeth to the base. I presumed this was blood.

"A-A-Achoo!"

Someone sneezed, I don't know who. The entity quickly turns around and reaches into a bush, pulling out Sj≈çu. I could only watch in terror as the creature picked him up, ripping his limbs off one by one, devouring him. His screams and cries of pain and horror, silenced. One of the ATF units had managed to save an RPG from the van before hiding. He immediately stood up and fired it at the creature. It looked like it had made a dent, it shattered the point of impact into pieces that fell on the floor, leaving a hole in the side of it's jaw. All of a sudden, something unexpected happened. The hole just repaired itself, and the pieces that fell of became smaller versions of the entity. The entity and it's tiny devilish clones turned to the man. The tiny ones were able to extend out claws as they ran towards the man, tearing into him and ripping him apart bit by bit.

"I just don't get it, how did it get out? How and why does it exist? Is this the end for us?" was all I could think about. Quietly, I backed out of the bush to try and escape. I heard a branch snap, and then I spotted the creatures turning around. I knew this was the end for me, there's nothing I can do now. That was before I heard something else, the sound of a helicopter whirring. They let down a ladder for me and immediately brought me up. We were able to escape before the creatures caught up. They brought the helicopter down at a refuel station. The medics on the helicopter attended to me. I haven't slept in the past day due to these events. They assured me I could sleep now, we'd be in the air for the next couple days. I ended up sleeping through the next 3 days. When I woke up, I was greeted in an odd room by a robotic voice with a friendly, "Hello." I asked where I was, and the door opened. I appeared to be in some highly advanced facility or something. I looked out the window, expecting to see total chaos or find out the building was underground, but instead I was in the middle of space.

Shocked, I roamed the space building in hopes to find someone. I heard chatter as I approached a room, so I knocked on the door and was granted permission to enter. In front of me stood 4 figures in black and white. They had the same name of the organization I worked for, with an added title of "Overseering Administration". I assumed they knew something about what the hell was going on back at Earth, all I got was a couple stares. I then showed them some footage from Earth of the entity I was researching. They each looked visibly panicked, their faces turning whiter than a ghost. I was asked to head back to my sleeping quarters. I have no clue as to what their plans are going to be, though I hope it is one that will save the planet from this deadly entity. I'm heading back to sleep, ending DTL #2.

And here we go again. Just like I remember. Always the same: me and my sister...me and my sister up on that rooftop. Just another building to explore, another building to remember, right? Only with the exception that I didn't know that after all this time, I would still remember. Why? Why does this scene always replay in my mind? As far as I can think, nothing special occurred that day. It must have been another boring Sunday.

Then, there is the fight. I was fighting with that girl...and my sister was fighting with that boy. That's how far I've managed to go. Voices, screams, guilt. Everything black. I can't remember anything after that. I've tried, I've tried really hard and I don't know what will happen if I continue to dig into this hole. Everyone seems to keep supporting me and for what? I'm okay. I am okay and I'm sick of their ''you're strong'' and ''how are you feeling?''. We are fine. We don't need their sympathy. Neither he nor I. 

That fight never left me. Who were they? Why am I questioning things that I don't know the answers to? Is there something I'm missing? Did we even know them? I can still picture their bodies, but their faces are always blurry. No matter how hard I push myself. They must be just random kids we had met. There is no other way. I don't like meeting new people, and neither does my sister. I'm comfortable with the friends I have now, I really am. We are a small group and we don't need anyone else, and my sister and I definitely didn't want company that day at that goddamn building. Sometimes I look at myself and my deeply buried feelings. And what are they? The urge to cry and break and to find out the answer for everything I'm uncertain of. I just can't get that scene out of my head.

It's just that I keep hoping to make some sense of the madness that I went through, so I visited that building again. When I saw it for the second time, it felt unrealistically familiar but not in a good way. I was having glimpses of a day that I didn't want to remember, and to be honest I wanted to leave. I don't know what got into me. I forgot what I was doing there. As soon as I made my first step, my phone rang. For a moment, I exited the whole 'eating my brain to find answers' thing and I picked it up. It was George. ''Where are you?'' ''I'm back here'', I said. ''I can't anymore...I need to get this over with''. He of course told me to stay put and that he was coming here with the other two to help me with it. He's just as bonkers as me. As much as I love him and trust him as a friend, I couldn't wait for him. He would just gonna take too long. "I'm going inside" I thought. For the first time after a while, I truly felt sure for myself, making that decision, and then came a ''safety'' feeling, but it was quickly gone and replaced with carelessness.

I didn't care how many kicks that door would take to open. I kicked it three times and it wouldn't budge. I tried one more and it opened. "Finally" I shouted, exhausted. Immediately after that, a very strange smell surrounded me. I couldn't figure out where it was coming from, or why it was there, but I hated it. It was making me puke. I ignored the feeling and walked inside. Just as I did, I heard some noises. They were loud and clear: "what is this place?" "I don't know but it looks awesome!"

I swear to god that second voice was sounding a lot like my sister when she was young. Funny. I let out a muffled giggle. A melancholic feeling came over me and my anxiety kicked in. After that, I heard two different voices with a much more unrecognizable tone coming from upstairs. One was high-pitched and the other not so much. It was like there was a dialogue going on. I felt chills down my spine. 

I put out my phone and used its flashlight. I saw the stairs. They were old and dusty. I put my foot on one of them and then a cracking was heard. For a moment I thought maybe I didn't want to go up. My heart kept beating faster and faster "maybe it isn't safe",  "maybe I don't belong here". I threw the thoughts away and I proceeded. I was seeing the other end. There was a closed door. With each step I took, I heard another voice. This time even more vivid. "what if this isn't a good idea?" "this is the best thing ever!" "what if there are other kids?" "so what? Don't you want to make friends?". My heart was going crazy. I'm going nuts if that voice was not my silly little sister always pushing me to try new things, always wanting somewhere to go, something to see. I gathered some courage and yelled, "Lucy? Is that you?". I waited for a little, hoping she would answer, hoping she would come out and tell me that it was all just a prank. Nothing. Out of desperation, I opened the door.

I found myself on a rooftop. The rooftop. The sunlight hit my face as I closed the flashlight. I walked a bit just so I can see the whole thing. It was exactly like my head would picture it. Just like I remember the first time I was there. I examined it a bit more and the voices continued, this time coming from all around me: "and who are you?" this one was light, I'm pretty sure I hadn't heard it before. "I'm Lucy, this is my brother Tom" "wow this is what you call brother? he looks more like a broken mop with that hair" "let it go Emma" that one was a bit deeper. I suddenly felt nauseous. The voices wouldn't stop. "let me show you how you can make him into a proper brother" "tell her to let him go now big guy or I'm gonna-". The voices were more intense coming from the edge of the rooftop. The more I approached the edge, the more I felt like I was gonna break. Pictures and glimpses of the fight took control of me. The girls. The punches. The shoves. "It was not my fault." thoughts were coming straight from the subconscious. "We weren't a part of this". I was living the same unsolvable puzzle that has been ripping me apart ever since it happened. I was finally here. I had the key but I could not find the door. Curses, screams, and two loud thumps. All together. It was like I was going to erupt, but I was so close to figuring it all out.

My stream of thoughts abruptly stopped as I heard the loudest and most live sound I've heard that day which was a car horn. The moment I heard it the nausea feeling vanished. So did all the voices. I looked down and was a car standing there as if It was waiting for someone. "It's George," I thought. I ran down the stairs as fast as possible with tears in my eyes, wishing I would have never come up here. It was indeed George's car and he had the others too. The moment I saw him I felt warm and safe. Sometimes I feel like he is the only one along with the others that connected with me. When you live in a world where everything seems dangerous and like It's gonna come after you, you need that kind of connection. I feel especially close to George. I opened the driver's door and hugged him, explained everything to him and we cried together. He often reminds me that I'm not alone in this. It's like he feels it too. The void eating him inside. After all, It's always me and him. That is what's keeping me going. I greeted the others and sat next to the driver's seat. "Please let's go home," I told him. He nodded and drove off.

Later, we put on some music. "Lonely Boy" by The Black Keys. It was our favorite. We sang it all together and it felt good, it made me feel a little better. I could hear the girls' laugh from the back seats. Then they started talking to each other, though I could not make out what they were saying. It must be the music I thought. Their voices only grew louder and louder like they were fighting about something. I started feeling dizzy. "Everything alright back there Lucy?" George asked. "Just leave him alone!" yelled Lucy. Now they were talking louder than ever to the point that we were hearing screaming. Panicking, George took some sharp turns and a big thump was heard. My vision was blurry and I could barely make out a tree and smoke in front of me. I turned my head and saw what I believed to be a knocked-out George. I shook him but he didn't respond. I turned all the way back to check on the girls and I was shocked to see nothing. I know I couldn't see well but I swear I saw no one. I tried to get up from the seat but I couldn't, it hurt too much. Everything turned a dark purple, then black.

I remember waking up in a hospital. The moment I woke up I tried to figure out what had happened. I checked my phone which was sitting next to me. Missed calls from my mom, my dad, and George's parents. I opened it and tried to call someone. My most recent call was from my sister so I chose that one. It didn't ring. It didn't make a sound. So I tried Emma. Again, nothing. I was desperate. But mostly sad and mad at myself that it all made sense. After all this time. I tried one last time to make a call, and I called George. It rang. He didn't answer but I felt a big relief. I don't care about talking to the girls anymore. I'm tired of the feeling that I'm constantly pretending. It sickens me. Deep down, I know the truth. I just want to feel that it was not our fault.

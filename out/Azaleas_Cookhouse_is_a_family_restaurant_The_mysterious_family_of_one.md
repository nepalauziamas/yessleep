The comfort of my home did little to calm my nerves. 

The doors were locked, but the damage had been done. Silva was watching. He’d been watching for God knows how long, tracking myself and my closest loved ones in order to ensure everything was kept in the ‘family’. The photos were a clever insurance policy: a weapon to wield if things went south. Now I was stuck under his thumb with my real family within his crosshairs. 

What a difference a day could make. Not even 24 hours ago, I was just a lowly server. Now I was sitting in the dark, trawling through the shady corners of the internet. Hunched over my laptop in my pajamas, I scrolled through my internet tabs, each one more incriminating than the next:

* Where do I buy a burner phone?
* How do you know you're being stalked?
* How much jail time for the possession of a dead body?

Maybe the police would believe my story. Maybe if I showed them where the bodies were, maybe if I could get my hands on the security footage, this could all end. I could go back to living a normal life.

But maybe they wouldn't. 

And who was I kidding? Life was never going back to normal. For the brief moments that I managed to doze off, all I saw were the cloudy eyes of the victims. They will never let me sleep. Every shadowy corner was a threat concealing one of Silva's henchmen, every creak from the floorboards made me jolt. Nothing felt safe as night faded away. 

A hint of amber broke through a gray arc of cloud before the harsh reality set in: I wasn't going to figure this out alone. I needed to talk to someone, someone I trusted to keep quiet. Someone who had information that I didn't. Someone hiding a secret as dark as my own. 

Someone I think I *loved*, as fucked up as that was.

It was an impossible thing to explain. The cold hard facts were there: I stared into her husband's lifeless eyes, I carried out her children’s limp bodies. And yet here I was, still in love. The Paulina I knew was warm, inviting, and full of heart. I had known that woman for years. Despite my apprehension about that evening, I still held out hope that there was something I didn't understand.

When the sun rose and the songbirds chirped their familiar chorus, I got up from my heaps of blankets and ran a hot shower. After breakfast, I made my way over to Paulina’s house. The usual characters were moseying around outside: Moe from across the street was firing up his lawnmower, the purr from the engine overtaking the songbirds tunes. Debbie was putzing around her front yard with her little cockapoo on-leash. I only made it a few steps past my driveway before I noticed that she had company—parked beside the red minivan was an empty squad car. 

*Shit.*

I switched gears, darting towards Debbie, the self proclaimed “eclectic” neighbor on our block. We stood on the sidewalk outside of her aquamarine painted home, the rainbow pinwheel lawn ornaments stabbed into her lawn at seemingly random locations. I dove into some polite conversation, all the while keeping my attention on Paulina’s home. Ten minutes of chit-chat went by with no movement from her residence.

I casually asked, “Any idea what's going on at Paulina’s place?” 

“No idea,” a hint of a smirk emerging on her face. She couldn't resist the delectable piece of gossip. “You know,” she said, her voice now a breathy whisper, “I think there’s some trouble in paradise…”

“What do you mean by that?” I pried. Debbie was basically our neighborhood watch. At her age, there wasn't much else for her to do. 

“Oh,” she remarked, “I always knew that Keith was trouble. Coming home at all hours of the night with that obnoxiously loud exhaust.” She tugged on Romeo's leash, his nose deep in a pile of his own droppings. “You know, I’ve seen him with another gal. A dark haired girl. A trashy thing with tattoos.”  

This was all news to me. I paused to take it in, petting Romeo on the head. “That is awful, really awful. But that’s far from a crime, Debbie.”

“You know, I wouldn't be surprised if he hit her.”

 “Debbie…”I groaned. 

She doubled down, “He’s got a temper on him, that's all. I’ve seen him toss rocks at poor Romeo when he was barking. He thought I wasn't looking, but I was.”

My stomach churned knowing we were speaking about someone who was murdered. While Debbie continued her rambling about other neighbors' deplorable acts, out of the corner of my eye I saw two cops walk out of Paulina’s house. 

“I’ve got to grab the mail, Deb. Nice chatting with you.” I waved goodbye as the vehicle rolled out of the cul-de-sac.

I waited outside of Moody’s Backroom, underneath the humming neon sign, wondering if I was making a big mistake.

A murderer and her accomplice enter a bar.

 It all feels like one bad joke, and something tells me I won’t be around to hear the punch line.

Moody’s Backroom is not like Azalea’s. It’s a roof and four walls with a couple of kegs. It’s got a flashing neon sign that you could spot from outer space. There are signs promoting their daily food and drink specials on every street corner in the neighborhood. This is a place begging for service, anybody's service.

How I got here is still a whirlwind. On Saturday, I retreated back to my house and opted to stay in. I figured Paulina had too much heat on her to risk any interaction. I was out of luck and out of time. But as fate would have it, Paulina spotted me on Sunday on my way back from a morning jog. I was hoping the endorphins would help clear my head, but all it did was leave me exhausted. I couldn't resist her wave and in a moment I found myself standing on her porch. She had a strawberry lemonade in hand and a smile across her face. Her hair sparkled in the sunlight, she looked radiant given the circumstances. We chatted for a bit as I tussled with my attraction to her and the reality of our situations. She extended another offer to grab a drink and in a helpless, sudden reflex, I said yes. The brain was no match for the heart.

Once she arrived she gave me a hug and we grabbed a seat in plain view of the VLT’s. We people-watched, chatting about the weather and the news. We discussed her vacation plans to Mexico and her current projects at work. Our first round is casual like this, like an awkward first date. Paulina’s hair is in a messy bun, but her appearance is far from disheveled. She’s wearing a boat neck sweater, silver hoop earrings, and a pair of Levi’s jeans. This is what I imagined a night out with her to be like. This is the Paulina that I know.

Two rounds in, the conversation starts to get more personal. Paulina asks about my history, so I told her about my divorce and how my dating life has been. I have her full attention, I can see the interest in her eyes. I really don't know what else to ask her at this point, so I just keep going on about myself. 

Three drinks in and the alcohol has washed away all of the nervous energy. We are floating through conversation with light-hearted, friendly banter. She’s playfully patting my arm when I decide it’s finally time to chip away at her fortress of secrets. The liquid courage, it’s running foolishly through my system, so I start to ask the bold questions, the questions I’ve been dying to ask all night.

“How are you doing, Paulina?”

She looks puzzled, as she sips her Mai Tai through a straw. “What's wrong with you?” she jokes. “ I’m doing good… how about you?”

I lean in, my voice falling to a gentle whisper, “No, I mean how are you *really* doing?”

She puts her drink down and cocks her head to the side.

“How is everything with the family?”

She pauses, stirring her drink. “Oh, they’re doing well, ”she says. “That does remind me though, I should check in with Keith.” She pulls out her cell phone as I place my hand on her arm. 

“Paulina, *I know*.”

Her eyebrows are raised. 

I lean in closer across the table, “Yesterday, at the restaurant. The cop car this morning.”

 I can see the color slowly draining from her face. Her eyes are moist now, they glisten under the pendant light above us. For a moment, there is a pause. The truth hangs in the air.

“I don't know what you’re talking about,” she says, sinking in her seat. The shift of energy in the room is now palpable. 

“I’m sorry. It's too soon…” I sigh. “I just need to know…”

She glances at the exit and grabs her purse.

“Wait, Paulina,” I beg. “Hear me out for a second. *Please*.”

She stands up. I follow suit, reaching for her shoulder.

“Paulina,” I shout. “I won't say anything. I swear.”

The bell above the exit door jingles as it swings shut behind her.

After paying the tab, I drove home, knowing that I shouldn't. I’m tiptoeing the line of sobriety with an empty stomach. The hard liquor and dark thoughts swirl around inside of me in a noxious concoction. I scream as I pound the wheel.

*You fuck up.*

*You idiot.*

It’s a short route home through residential streets. The cookie-cutter homes are blurs of color as I drive past. Besides the parked cars, the roads are empty, the sidewalks bare. 

In my rearview, I noticed a black SUV behind me. It turns left when I turn left down Teton road. I think I’m overreacting, so I test my theory and take another left into a nearby cul-de-sac. The vehicle follows me in a loop past the row of two-story homes. My chest begins to tighten. My only thought is that I can't go home. So I keep driving down Citadel road. Citadel Crescent. Citadel Circle. Leaving the community, I head down Mckenzie boulevard with the SUV on my tail.

Eventually, I will have to stop. I just don't know where to go.

My heart is beating so strongly that I feel it in my skull. I figure the safest place is somewhere public, so I decide to pull into the Southside strip mall. The Walmart parking lot isn't exactly packed— there are some scattered RVs and late-night shoppers, but it’s the best option available. 

I park near a row of cars and wait. The SUV pulls up beside me. The tint on the passenger side window is too opaque to see through, I only hear the opening and slamming of the driver side door.

“Get out of the car,“ the voice screams.

The glow from the lamp post reveals a curly-haired woman. Both arms are covered in an elaborate sleeve of tattoos - two colorful gardens of fully bloomed flowers in an elaborate water-mark style.

I roll down the window a fraction of an inch and yell back, “Why are you following me you psycho?”

“Who the hell are you? And what are you doing with Paulina?”

I rolled down the window a little more and now I notice the distinct characteristics of her face: dark brown hair, ice-blue eyes. Her prominent nose. Her tall stature. She was sitting at the table next to ours, and up-close she looked incredibly familiar. The resemblance is uncanny.

“Calm down for a second, ” I said, stepping out of my vehicle. “No reason to get all worked up. We are just friends.”

“Bullshit,” she hissed. “You know something. I can feel it.”

By now a small crowd of shoppers are enjoying the show, their hands are gripping plastic bags full of groceries, their carts abandoned in the middle of the road. 

With a sudden eruption, the dark-haired woman that could only be Keith’s sister shouts back to the crowd:

 “I’m calling the cops.”

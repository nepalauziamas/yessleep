I grew up in Gate City Virginia, just off route 58 and recently returned after a stressful few years in New York mostly flipping burgers. At first, it was all normal, everyone was happy to see me and i unpacked at my mom's place, even saw some friends from high school, and i thought it'd be fun to explore the nearby wood, maybe get a sunset picture or two. I was alone exept for the family dog, which was a healthy and strong German Shepherd, some binoculars and my camera. After about twenty minutes I got to the clearing i was planning to take pictures from and sat down on a rock nearby. Looking back now, for how still i was, i should have noticed the lack of birds and overall noise, exept for the occasional hoof sounds. When the sun began to set I took some pictures, angling the camera to catch the trees in the shot, when all of a sudden the air changed. It was as if someone had removed any humidity from the air and replaced it with pure fear. I felt my neck hairs stand on end. At first I tricked myself into believing it was just the change in atmosphere due to the lack of light, until i checked the photos...

There, just beyond the clearing was a deer. I was amazed at how i caught it in frame until i looked up. The trees weren't that short. They would have easily towered over any normal deer. I started to panic. I swear I could feel someone breathing onto my neck, but I dared not turn around. I remember the primal instinct that took over me at that point, all i could come out with was "Shit." 

It was getting dark.
Really fucking dark.
And I was lost, I was too busy panicking about the photos that I walked the wrong way. I wasn't home, I was in the middle of a forest.

And then i heard it.

click, click, click, click

It was horrifying, like bones snapping and cracking, but also like a piercing whistle that broke the stale air. I didn't want to go home now. Because it was behind me.
Slowly, I turned around, acting strong, trying to intimidate what i could only assume was a hell deer.

It was there.

Unphazed by my discovery, the deer stood tall, everything about it just off. Its eyes were different, forward facing, like a predators, and i could have sworn there was an extra one. Its neck, just a bit longer than usual. Its mouth an agape maw like a coyote or a dog...

Thats when i realized. My family dog was gone. He hadn't even made a noise to alert me and i was so distracted.. shit.

I brought myself to look at it fully, not just its face, and i realized its legs. The front two legs were covered in gore, aswell as most of its hide. And the back two... it was standing upright, like a human.

I didn't care anymore. I booked it in one direction and i heard that deathly clicking peirce the air. Closely following were the loud and fast stomps of its hooves, its blood dripping wet on the ground. I think it must have been going pretty fast cause i heard the thump
of it hitting a tree, thats probably the only reason im alive 
I saw the lights of my town and screamed loudly for help. I could hear it getting closer, and fast. I managed to get through the gate to the woods in time and shut it fast. 

I didn't look back after that.



The next day i packed my bags and said my goodbyes. No way was i spending the summer here with THAT after me.

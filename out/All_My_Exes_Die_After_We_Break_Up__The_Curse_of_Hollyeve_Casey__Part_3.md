The intensity of Hollyeve’s newfound presence in my life scared me. I decided it was best to back off, at least for a while. 

I successfully kept Hollyeve out of my life for almost a year when I received a message from Casey on Reddit.

Casey was unlike the other Hollyeve informants - younger, brighter and unbroken. He was actually still in high school and it was unclear if he was intentionally goth or if he was just pale and wore dark clothes.

Hollyeve showed up at his school on the first day of school. He was drawn to her immediately. It was like someone had cooked up a fellow odd, semi-goth, who struggled to make conversation, and dropped her into his little rural town along the rugged northern California coast. Like Colin, his hometown was in the same county I grew up in.  

Casey and Hollyeve started a quiet romance. They ate lunch together. Two weirdos in the back of the lunchroom. They walked home together. Two weirdos who happily cut through the cemetery to get home quicker. They listened to ambient music in his room alone. 

They would make out for hours in his room. Never worrying about whether his casino-addicted parents would come home. Casey would then walk Hollyeve home to a dark house on the edge of town. They would share a kiss and then she’d slink away. Never inviting him in. 

One night as they stood there in her driveway - he told her he loved her. 

The phrase seemed to startle her. She froze up and stared at him for an awkward 10 seconds. 

Eventually, she kissed him. 

*Then he never saw her again.* 

Casey asked around at school. No one knew anything about her. The school office had no record of a student by that name. 

He went to her house and walked up close. Knocked on the door. It appeared to be abandoned. *Had he never actually watched her walk in?* 

Casey started Googling Hollyeve and quickly came across the subreddit about her curse. 

It took him a long time to absorb everything, but it also started to make sense. It seemed all of the people on the Sub who ran into Hollyeve were on the rural coast of northern California and it seemed to span over the course of 20 years.

I was the only one who responded to Casey’s message. I noted it seemed like things had gone quiet on the Hollyeve front. It may have been in response to Hollyeve suddenly getting stronger not long before. 

I told Casey about the origin story of Hollyeve and Colin and their false, broken love. 

Casey then dropped a bombshell. She had found some actual information online about Hollyeve as a teenage girl and she tracked down Hollyeve’s mom, Kelly, and had met with her. 

Casey earned Kelly’s trust and got her to share even more about the manipulation of Colin and how it broke Hollyeve’s heart and spirit. The poor young girl really thought they were in love and when you are 13, you think everything that happens to you is the rest of your life. 

Kelly also explained what happened to Hollyeve that Colin would only hint at. 

Kelly wasn’t sure how it started, and she didn’t want to believe that Hollyeve started it herself, but Hollyeve’s house nearly burnt down the night Colin broke up with her. Hollyeve never got out.

They found something Hollyeve wore next to where her body was - a silver necklace that was half of a heart. Kelly was able to remember Hollyeve had started wearing it a few weeks before. She had asked about it and Hollyeve had said it was from a boy, and he had the other half. 

Kelly had Hollyeve’s half of the heart necklace. She didn’t know where the other half was. 

I felt like we suddenly had an incredible clue…and a potential solution. 

*Could we solve the Curse if we could get the other half of the heart necklace back?* 

We had to track down Colin. 

Colin wouldn’t respond to any of my messages. I worried he might be dead. Casey and I had to sleuth hard online and turn into private investigators just to track him down. 

We were both determined. I wanted to finally be able to find my true love and Casey wanted to get some closure with his first true love. 

We eventually found him. 

Colin lived alone in a nice part of San Francisco. He seemed unemployed and the only thing in his life which appeared to be any kind of obligation was walking to the strip clubs on Broadway every night. 

Casey and I caught him coming out of one late one night. 

Colin lived like a ghost haunting a nearly empty studio apartment. All he had was a mattress on the floor and a face which looked like it was about 60, even though I knew he was in his 30s. 

“I’m just trying to have nothing, so maybe then she will leave me alone. There’s nothing left to strip from me,” Colin explained. 

I already knew Colin’s past romantic struggles because of Hollyeve. I didn’t know that she was otherwise still affecting him personally. 

“I don’t know what happened. Suddenly I can’t get rid of her,” Colin lamented. “I’ve noticed that if I keep a low profile and live as little life as possible, that she comes around less though.”

I agreed, something seemed to be going on with Hollyeve recently. Something was making her more aggressive and changing her M.O.

Colin thought she could sense someone was close to unraveling her curse - solving the riddle. That she was getting desperate and angry, feeling herself slipping away and lashing out. 

“What’s with going to strip clubs every night?” Casey asked, beating me to my question, which I thought was much more important at this point. 

Colin’s face instantly got guilty. He struggled to get words out suddenly. 

“If I pass it on…it’s better,” Colin mumbled. 

“What?” Casey and I asked at the same time. 

“It’s easiest if I can pass on Hollyeve to someone who she can attach to romantically, even if it’s completely fake and for money. Then I can keep her at bay. At least for a night. I have no other choice,” Colin explained. 

“So then Hollyeve gets attached to these poor women who give you lap dances? But she leaves you alone?” Casey asked Colin. 

Colin looked long into our eyes and I was taken back by how tired he looked. He looked like a man who hadn’t had a good night of sleep in years. 

“You know you’re not going to beat this, right?” Colin asked us. 

Neither of us answered. 

“She’s not a person, she’s not a spirit, she’s a virus, and humans never beat viruses. Ever. She doesn’t die. She just gets passed around and then comes back again like a cold,” Colin said. 

Again, no response from Casey or me. 

“You’ll never be able to figure out where Hollyeve starts and ends because “it” might not even be her. My family might be even more fucked up than her’s was. Maybe she got it from me? We break people and they break us. That’s all it is,” Colin rambled. 

“Do you have the other part of this?” Casey cut off Colin and showed him the half heart necklace. 

Colin flinched at the sight of the jewelry. I did as well. Casey hadn’t told me he had gotten the necklace from Hollyeve’s mom. 

“Where…did you get that?” Colin asked, suddenly taking on the posture and demeanor of Golum from Lord of the Rings when he sees His Precious. 

“Where’s your half of the necklace?” Casey asked, sternly.

—

Colin kept the other half of the heart necklace in a drawer by his bed. He agreed to take it back to Hollyeve’s old bedroom with us that night. 

He didn’t think that would work though. He had always had that necklace. Hollyeve could have taken it back anytime. 

He would try though. We gave him no choice. We drove him up the coast in the middle of the night. Kelly had told Casey that a chunk of Hollyeve’s childhood home still existed, deep in overgrown woods. Again, Casey didn’t reveal this information to me until we were on the way there. 

I used the drive to take some time and question Colin. *Why had Colin even reached out to me on Reddit in the first place?*

He dismissed it away quickly. He would go through periods where he wanted to solve the curse and he thought I might be onto something. He changed his mind after he shared his story with me and nothing changed. 

We made it to Hollyeve’s half burned down old home a bit before daybreak, in the darkest hours of the night, in the middle of a cold rainstorm. 

Colin told us Hollyeve’s room looked to still be there - up a steep staircase. We thought Colin was following us. *We were wrong.* 

We got to the top of the stairs and looked down to the bottom where we saw the flash of a knife in the shallow light of the darkened space. We watched as Colin slowly drew that knife up to his neck. 

“She’s here,” Colin said softly.

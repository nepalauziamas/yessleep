&#x200B;

I brought up what I mentioned in my last post to Carl and Nick.  We discussed it over breakfast, cereal to be specific.  Carl was having Captain Crunch and Nick Honey Bunches Of Oats With Almonds.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"Are you sure?" Carl asked me.

&#x200B;

"Yeah," Nick said, "it was pretty hectic. You could've just thought you heard one talk."

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

A bowl of untouched Cinnamon Toast Crunch was sitting in front of me. That morning, I didn't have a strong appetite. Closing my eyes, I rubbed my forehead with the tips of my index and middle fingers and sighed.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"I thought about that, believe me, but I just can't convince myself it didn't happen."

&#x200B;

"But I didn't hear anything," Nick pointed out.

&#x200B;

"What about Stevenson?" Carl asked.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

He was in the basement working on some blueprints that he said would help us.  He came up to put his plate in the sink so I asked him if he heard what I did.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“You did too?” he replied in bewilderment. “I thought it was just me.”

&#x200B;

“Aw hell, this complicates things,” Carl groaned.

&#x200B;

“How?” Stevenson asked him.

&#x200B;

“How?”  Because if the card trees are enslaved somehow then killing them would basically be murder.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Stevenson pursed his lips.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“We can’t worry about that,” he said. “We need to focus on making sure our goals are achieved.”

“Of course, the guy who works at a torture facility would say that,” I chimed in, causing him to glare at me.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“If they find us again, they’ll either kill us or take us to god only knows where,” he snapped. “The way I see it, either it’s us or them.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Admittedly, he made a good point. That said, I don’t think we have it in us to flat-out kill someone in cold blood. Anytime we have taken lives has always been in self-defense or by accident. We’ve never been in a situation like this and if this is Inde's doing, he’s playing dirty.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“The blueprints I'm making are going to be for a weapon that will help us test rune combinations more efficiently."

&#x200B;

"How will it work?" Nick inquired.

&#x200B;

"I was thinking of something along the lines of a turret, but we'll have to see. Now, if you'll excuse me I'll be getting back to my work."

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

He left the dining room and went back down to the basement, leaving us in annoyed silence.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"Great, guess we'll have to become murderers then," I said and then absentmindedly shoved a spoon full of now soggy cereal into my mouth.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Carl was lost in thought.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"Maybe not," he told me.

&#x200B;

"What do you mean?" I replied, wiping some milk off my face with my sleeve.

&#x200B;

"When was the last time you visited the library?"

&#x200B;

"Not since before we left. What are you getting at?"

&#x200B;

"What if there's something there that can help us?"

&#x200B;

"If that's the case, why didn't Alice tell anyone?"

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

She was the librarian of our town and responsible for hand-copying journals of runes our town's settlers left. If not for her, we would've been helpless against the monsters that used to be here. Speaking of, it is odd that the card trees are the only ones we've seen. I guess they killed or took the others.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"It wouldn't have been like her to withhold information that could save people," I continued, "unless…"

&#x200B;

"Unless she was one of the first people taken."

&#x200B;

"But surely Blue's goons would've searched there."

&#x200B;

"I don't know. Between trying to keep everyone here and dealing with creatures, they may have overlooked it," Nick pointed out.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

He and Carl took bites of their cereals.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"I guess it couldn't hurt to take a look around. What do you guys say we head over there after breakfast?”

&#x200B;

“Sounds good,” Carl replied.

&#x200B;

“What about Stevenson?” Nick asked.

&#x200B;

“I mean, we can see if he feels like coming along I guess,” I said.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Shortly later, Nick and I were waiting outside. I sat leaning back against Carl’s car. I glanced up at the sky, mentally noting that it was pretty cloudy. The front door opened and out stepped Carl.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Stevenson said he’d fine here,” he told us.

&#x200B;

“Is it safe to leave him alone?” I asked.

&#x200B;

“I’m sure it’ll be alright. He just wants to work on his blueprints, but I’m bringing the radio with us just in case.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Whenever I got punished, my parents would hide my video games in the woods so reading was all I could do for fun. I read a lot and the place I did it the most was the library. Nobody would try to mess with me there so I could get lost in a good book without having to worry about interruptions. Seeing the library building again after all this time sent a mixture of nostalgia and guilt through me. It wasn’t only from being away for so long either.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

It was from thinking about just how much I’d neglected to visit it over the years. Sure, I’d deliver there for Formaggio’s. However, after graduation going there solely for recreation occurred less and less. Between work and taking care of my parents’  home, the closest I’d get would be the occasional chat with Alice. Speaking of whom, of all the people who were taken first, we were surprised she was among them.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

The library is so quiet nothing ever bothers to attack it so how the card trees even thought to was a question that would require us reviewing the security cam footage to solve. When we parked and got out, I stared at it at those windows that almost made me feel like I was making eye contact with a giant face.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Pete, you alright?”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I turned to Nick.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Yeah, it’s just that it’s been a while. You know?”

&#x200B;

“I think so.”

&#x200B;

“Then let's get inside,” Carl said and then went ahead of us.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Oddly enough, the front entrance was completely fine, not a crack in or scratch on the doors.  Carl picked the lock to get them open and we went inside. While it did feel good to experience that soothing quiet again, something about it was also undeniably eerie.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“When was the last time you came here?” I whispered to Carl.

&#x200B;

“A few years, but I did talk with Alice in my shop sometimes,” he whispered back.

&#x200B;

“Why are we whispering?” Nick also whispered.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I was about to answer when I realized I didn’t actually know why we were.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Force of habit?” I said after a brief moment, letting my voice go from whispering to talking low.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Even if we were the only ones there, talking any louder than that still felt almost sacrilegious. It’s like getting drunk at a funeral. You just don’t do it. We made our way to the front desk, figuring that would be the best place to search first. What we were looking for, we didn’t know yet. Then I remembered something.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Wait a minute,” I said. “Didn’t Alice have a book here?”

&#x200B;

“Pete, we’re in a library.,” Carl pointed out. “There are a lot of books.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I rolled my eyes.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“I know that. What I mean is there was another one she showed us. You know, the one she said belonged to the settlers?”

&#x200B;

“Oh yeah,” he exclaimed to which I shushed him. “Sorry, but yeah I remember.”

&#x200B;

“Mind filling me in here?” Carl asked.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

We did so.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Hang on,” he said. “Zohl had a book like that too. Didn’t he?”

&#x200B;

“I completely forgot about that,” I said, surprised.

&#x200B;

“Yeah, me too,” Nick added. “Too bad we haven’t seen him.”

&#x200B;

“Well, let’s see if we can’t find that book,” Carl told us.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Searching the desk yielded no results.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Maybe she took it home with her?” Nick said.

&#x200B;

“Maybe," I replied, "but let's keep looking.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

We knew things would be pretty dim inside, being without power and all so we brought along some flashlights. Actually, dark would be a more accurate description. The only other light coming in was through the windows and most of it was getting blocked out by taller trees. Our flashlight beams swept around, illuminating books shelves whose contents were coated in dust.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“I think I see something,” Nick said, shining his flashlight past some cobwebs.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Some books were on the floor. Investigating showed us a pile as if someone had raked them off the shelves. My grip on my flashlight tightened. The hairs on my arms were beginning to stand. Looking further confirmed our fears. We didn’t know what was worse, the smear of blood on the carpet or the nail marks on the wood flooring that lead to the open back exit.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Pete, are you okay?” Carl asked.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I was trembling while staring at the site before us. It wasn’t only due to fear. I dug my nails into my palms. At the same time, there was a familiar pressure building behind my forehead. This ceased when Nick touching my shoulder brought me back to my senses.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Your hands,” he told me.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I glanced down and noticed blood trickling from my palms. I looked back up to the visibly concerned faces of Carl and Nick.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Sorry,” I said, “it’s just that…”

&#x200B;

“We know,” Carl replied. “Why don’t you go cool off for a bit? We’ll keep looking.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I let out a deep breath.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Okay,” I told him while nodding.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

He and Nick went out the back to keep searching. I stayed in and paced around. Every so often I’d run my fingers over the books, coating them in their dust. So many I’d read from adventure to fantasy to horror. For someone who was more of a loner back then,  they’d bring me comfort.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I smiled upon seeing the Stephen King books. I read his work a lot back then. Oftentimes, due to my shitty behavior, they’d be my only source of entertainment. As I was reminiscing, my foot hit something. I cast my eyes downward to see part of a book sticking out from under the shelves. Picking it up revealed that it was none other than the one we were searching for.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Guys, I found it,” I yelled out to them after  I ran out the back exit to them with it in hand.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Carl and Nick who were crouching over something turned to look at me and I waved it at them.

“Hey, you found it,” Nick exclaimed.

&#x200B;

“Yeah, did you guys find something too?”

&#x200B;

“Take a look,” Carl replied.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

They stepped aside and I could now see on the ground what appeared to be some kind of pen or at least something pen-shaped wedged in the concrete’s crack. Surrounding it were some symbols drawn with white chalk that were similar to the runes on buildings in our town. However, I didn’t recognize these and they were nearly encompassed by a black chalk circle. I say nearly because it was incomplete.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Whoever had done it only got halfway before being dragged off as indicated by how it skewed off into a random line. The library has an awning to provide shade during outside reading which explains how no rain was able to damage the illustration.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Who do you think did this?” I asked.

&#x200B;

“Well, it couldn’t have been Alice,” Carl said, “and it seems to have been done in a rush which means it was most likely done at night.”

&#x200B;

“Maybe Stevenson knows something?” Nick suggested.

&#x200B;

“He might,” Carl told him. “We’ll ask him later, though. I think we should keep looking around.”

&#x200B;

“I’ll head back inside then in case we missed something,” I replied.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

While I was doing that, they were searching other areas around the building. I came back to the blood on the floor. I hadn’t noticed it before part of it seemed unusual. I knelt down and got closer to it. Part of the stain almost looked like a letter. I shined my flashlight on it and confirmed that it was.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

In fact, it appeared to be an uppercase B. My heart raced as I thought it may be some kind of message Alice was trying to leave behind. Unfortunately, I couldn’t make out anything else. Mentally, I cursed the fact the carpet wasn’t a lighter color. Then I got an idea. By running my finger over it, I was able to trace what the letters were supposed to be. It spelled out the word “ink”.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

This confused me. Granted, being dragged by the legs while you’re bleeding doesn’t exactly allow time to write a well-thought-out message. Still, I was stumped. What did ink have to do with anything? A light noise interrupted my thoughts.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*Drip. drip. Drip.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Panic bubbled within me.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*How could we have forgotten about the damn rain?*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Rushing outside, I turned to see Carl and Nick already running in my direction.  I glanced at the woods. Much to my dismay, I could already see some movement among the trees. It appeared the rain rule also applied to the card trees. A quick aside, while creatures in our town don’t usually come out during the day, stormy weather is the exception and that was the case here.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Some of them were already trying to move toward us when we went back inside. Our plan was to head out the main exit to Carl’s car. More card trees at the front changed this.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Oh hell,” Carl muttered.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

The only place we could think of to hide was under the front desk. Shortly later, windows were shattered as they broke in. Now the place was crawling with them while were cramped in our hiding spot. When we talked we made sure to adhere to the library rules.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Why didn’t you park closer?” Nick whispered to Carl.

&#x200B;

“It’s not that far,” he replied.

&#x200B;

“It’s on the other side of the parking lot.”

&#x200B;

“Well, I didn’t think about it, okay? You could’ve told me to”

&#x200B;

“Argue about that later,” I told them. “Right now, we need a way out of here and fast.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I flinched as books that were raked off shelves thudded to the floor. They sounded close and it was only a matter of time before they made their way to where we were.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“You’re right,” Carl said. “We need a distraction.”

&#x200B;

“Isn’t there a coffee mug on the desk?” Nick asked.

&#x200B;

“That should do it, but we need to make sure they aren’t looking over here first.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I was the one who checked. Slowly, I peeked over the desk, making sure to be extra careful. The place was crawling with card trees now and having them that close was making me sweat. Fortunately, none were staring over here. I grabbed the mug and chucked it as hard as I could.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

That training we did back at Ivan’s place paid off because I was able to hit the wall on the other side of the library, causing the mug to shatter. This drew the card trees’ attention who made their way to the sound, allowing us to start sneaking away. I’m proud to say we almost made it to the exit when the radio clipped to Carl’s pants began to crackle.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Guys, come in please,” Stevenson’s urgent voice spoke from it.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

My blood chilled. I felt like a skydiver whose parachute just jammed. We turned and now the card trees were fixated on us.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“God damn it,” I yelled. “Run.”

&#x200B;

We sprinted to the car all the while dozens of limbs were trying to snag us and Stevenson was still screaming at us. Carl hit the button on his keys to unlock the doors. He yanked the driver’s side open while we got in the back. Nick went in first and I was about to when one of those things yanked me back by my shirt.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Pete,” Carl and Nick yelled in unison.

&#x200B;

“Fuck,” I said, thrashing to get free.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

It was dragging me away so there was only one way out. With some wriggling, I was able to slip out of my shirt and therefore, its grasp. Since it was a little high up, the land was a bit painful. I wouldn’t notice it until later, though. I was only focused on us getting the hell away. I dove into the car and as Carl was speeding off some card trees’ branches shot forward, busting in the driver’s window and the one next to me.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

He screamed a string of obscenities when this happened and some even managed to damage his windshield as he was swerving around them. We booked it out of town since they were currently roaming it. When we felt safe enough, we stopped to get out and brush the glass away. As it turns out, bare skin and broken glass have never been on good terms. I had to pick out shards all while it was still raining.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Carl was assessing the damage, trying to see if only the glass was damaged when Stevenson spoke again.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Why won’t you pick up?” he pleaded.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Carl was understandably pissed and I honestly thought he was going to smash the radio on the ground. Instead, he yanked it from his pocket and hit the button to respond.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Finally, I’ve been trying to reach you for…”

&#x200B;

“Shut the fuck up.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Carl’s booming voice carried across the road.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Excuse me?” Stevenson replied, offended. “You need to listen.”

&#x200B;

“No, you listen. Do you have any idea of what we just went through because of your dumb ass?”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Carl explained what happened to him as I continued getting glass out of my body. The car had a first aid kit in the trunk which Nick used to help me up as Stevenson responded.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“It’s  not like I knew it would be bad timing,” he said defensively, “and you haven’t even let me explain what I’m currently dealing with.”

&#x200B;

“Fine, let’s hear it then.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Similar to our situation, Stevenson found himself caught in the rain with Card trees after him.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Something killed them,” he said.

&#x200B;

“What?”

&#x200B;

“It killed them. Hell, it tore them apart.”

&#x200B;

“What could have done it to them?”

&#x200B;

“I have no idea, but I don’t want to find out. I don’t think it saw me so I’m safe for now. Christ, do you know I heard it laughing earlier?”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Carl grunted in annoyance.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Did you see it?” he asked.

&#x200B;

“Only a glimpse. It was pretty far away.”

&#x200B;

“Well, just stay put then. We can’t exactly head back right now so you’ll have to be on your own for the night?”

&#x200B;

“With that thing out there? Are you kidding me?”

&#x200B;

“Nope, good luck.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Stevenson began cursing so Carl shut off the radio.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“You all patched up?” he asked me.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Gauze pads and band-aids were applied to my cuts. I thought with all the pain I’d experienced hydrogen peroxide wouldn’t hurt that much. As it turned out, I  was, in a manner of speaking, painfully wrong.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“As much as I can be,” I replied to Carl, “ so what now?”

&#x200B;

“I got a little cash on me. Let’s find a place to crash for the night.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

We found a motel. The guy at the desk was naturally curious upon seeing both a shirtless man with cuts all over his body and a busted car outside.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“What happened to you guys?” he asked.

&#x200B;

“Long day,” Carl replied, placing some money on the desk.

&#x200B;

“That’ll do it.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

The man handed him a key card and we headed to our room. That brings me to now. There was also a laptop in the trunk belonging to Carl’s friend, Ivan. Actually, the car is really his as well. He said Carl could use it.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Speaking of which, it’s in desperate need of repairs. Anyway, I’m typing this up using the motel’s wifi. Earlier, Carl ran to the gas station across the street and got some hotdogs and drinks. Something about convenience store hotdogs hit different and it's not only the way they cook them either. It's as if you can somehow taste the overall atmosphere in them.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

At the very least, I'm glad I don't have to sleep on an empty stomach. On that note, I should get some shuteye.  When we see Stevenson, I might smack him upside the head again only this time it won’t be an accident, but for now, [I’ll](https://www.reddit.com/r/StoriesFromRose/) say [good night.](https://twitter.com/RoseBlack2222)

For a little bit of backstory: I am a 20 year old dude, unemployed, single, and hopeless. Against most stereotypes regarding people in my own condition, I am an avid reader. To be fair, I really only read sci-fi and fantasy books, but I digress.

I did always find some sort of comfort in books, even since early childhood. It began with harmless children's books, but later expanded to larger chapter books that I could, and often did, get lost in for hours without cease. I guess it was just a great way for me to escape, for me to find attachment to somebody and "live" with them, fictional or not. 

It makes me laugh now, reminiscing on memories of my parents quite literally hiding my books from me to get me to socialize. I would often squabble back and forth with them. They could never grasp the fact that I didn't want attention or relationships from real people. I could find them solely in my books. 

This condition continued into my teenage years, then eventually my early adulthood. Although, I did pick up on some social skills and can down hold a conversation of my own. I ventured into many different genres, ranging from Percy Jackson fantasy-type books to more serious "adulty" books if you will. These being motivational or financial success books.

Now that you understand my situation slightly better, I need to share with you my problem. Three weeks ago today I noticed something that made me shiver, and still does. I was doing my nightly reading when I realized something very out of place. In the dead center of the paragraph I was reading was, in the same font and size, but all caps and colored red: "1 MONTH." I was startled to say the least, but chalked it up to some pesky 14 year old writing something stupid in a book at the store. I continued skimming the pages and nothing else was off about that night. 

In fact, the rest of that week was, for the most part, pretty calm. I read just as much as I normally did and was able to complete the novel with no more problems of this "timer." I headed to the bookstore the day after completing the book. I browsed and finally landed on a certain novel which I thought I would enjoy. I ended up skimming through and decided it would be entertaining, so I decided to purchase it.

That very night I noticed it again. "3 WEEKS," I did make note that the time was 1 week less. This piece of information is critical because it was exactly one week, to the day, that I had seen the "1 MONTH" marking in my last novel.

I do have to admit that I was truly scared at this point. I know a grand total of zero teenagers who would inconvenience themselves to this extent just to startle someone. What if this "timer" actually meant something? I couldn't help but wonder. 

This curiosity prompted me to go back to the bookstore and purchase something completely out of my taste, just to see if this was in every book in the store. I decided on some random Japanese manga. I have admittedly gone through a manga phase, but it was very brief and years ago. I rationalized that if someone was pranking me by putting this into books that I read, they wouldn't put it in some book that I wouldn't read. 

When I arrived home, I swiftly unlocked the door and ran quickly to my room. I unwrapped my newly purchased book and flipped the pages. I was beginning to feel a sense of relief when I was halfway through and hadn't noticed anything yet. Then, there it was. "20 DAYS." I couldn't help but shiver realizing that instead of months it had now turned into days. 

The realization hit me right then and there. This wasn't an elaborate prank anymore. This was something bigger than that.

This continued. I had gone back to that same book store 3 times since then. Each time I purchased a completely different genre of book. I feel so sorry for the poor old lady that always checked me out. She must've though I was losing my mind. She was right.

The timer now says 5 days. I have checked every day since then. And, without fail. I am able to find it. I have begun to go crazy over this. As each day passes I feel more hopeless, more empty. I do not know what this means. I don't know what will happen to me. I can't take this anymore. 

I have just decided, while writing this, that I will wait. I need the closure. The last month has been torture for me. I can't endure that and then end up not knowing. I haven't mentioned this to anyone yet. I still feel glimpses of hope every once in a while. I feel that something like this is impossible. This couldn't really happen. No way this could happen. This is impossible. Please. Someone tell me this is impossible. Tell me what is happening to me. 

Help me.

If I am not back here in exactly 5 days, then it is fair to assume the worst.

Anyone ever had a 'dream' so real that you're not quite sure if you're actually dreaming or if everything is actually happening?
 Like being in a state of sleep paralysis but being completely mobile and aware. Creeping figures and uneasy feelings?

Well this is the first of a dozen or two experiences I've had with the trenchcoat man.

I've always been what some people would describe as 'spiritually inclined'. I'm more sensitive to the paranormal and spirits etc than the average person.

The first night that he visited me, I struggled to get to sleep. An eerie feeling hung like a fog in my room and I couldn't help but toss and turn.
After hours, I finally managed to get to sleep. Not that it lasted long. I was woken up by the quiet creeking of my bedroom door, my whole left side achey from lying on it funny. It took me a few seconds to realise what the sound actually was and just froze as soon as I saw him. I could physically move if I had wanted to but I stupidly thought it would leave me alone if it thought I was still asleep. 

Peering around my door was a black figure. My room was almost pitch black, the only light was a small blue one radiating from my charger port.
Even still, he was so much darker. Like nothing I've ever seen, I can't even explain it.
Edging on 7ft tall, dressed in an almost floor length trenchcoat and a bowler hat. I didn't know how to process any of it.

He swiftly made his way closer to me. I closed my eyes in the hopes that if I opened them again, it would all be over. His footsteps just continued to get closer.
My eyes still shut, I could feel the heaviness of the air around him.
Still lying on my left side, too scared to move, he leans over the edge of my bed. His face so close to me that I could feel the heavy, raspy breathing against my ear.

I tried so hard to fight the urge to open my eyes but, although still terrified, impulse and curiosity took over.
I turned my head slightly to find him still inches away from my face. Looking at him, I could see little to no defining features. He had no mouth, no nose and his eyes were just sockets, somehow darker than he already was. Although he had no facial features, the muscle definition of where they should have been was still there.

Now aware of the fact that I was fully awake, his heavy breathing came to a sudden stop. He started leaning upright again. His facial muscles contorting into what I can only imagine to be a sinister smile. If he had a mouth to do so.
As he stood towering over me, I was on the verge of tears, tempted to shout for him to leave me alone.
Before I knew it, he was leaning back over me, closer than before. Despite not having a mouth he whispered in my ear,
"the bodies are in the foundation".

Confused and scared, I froze up yet again.
He suddenly swung himself back upright. Twisting his head to look around him, staring at my bedroom door. The air around us becoming heavier than it previously was. He looked back at me and although he was terrifying in himself, he seemed scared. His gaze darting around the room as if looking for something.
I closed my eyes, yet again hoping this would all dissappear.
As he let out a maniacl laugh I opened my eyes back up to find him gone.
Nothing but the uneasy, heavy feeling lingered in my room.

This was only my first experience with him and to this day, I can never determine whether I'm dreaming or not whenever he visits.
All I know is that it always feels so real but not in a lucid dream kind of way and I still can't sleep on my left side unless someone else is there with me.

I'd love to hear if anyone else has had any experiences similar to this!
I'd like to know what's going on and why it's happening.

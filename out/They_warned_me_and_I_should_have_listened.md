When I moved into this new neighborhood, everyone always subtly (and not-so-subtly) warned me not to go into the woods. I always assumed it was because of hunters, and I thought nothing of it and ignored their warnings. 

I never liked the outdoors that much anyways. Over the next week of my unpacking, I met a few people from around there. However, everyone always seemed a little off. Like they were trying to warn me of something but couldn't tell me.

 One night, I was in the kitchen making tea when I saw a dog running into the woods. I've always had a soft spot for animals, and in a moment of quick thinking, I dashed out the door after the dog. I chased it for a while before getting tired and losing it. I knew I didn't have the energy to look anymore and decided to go home. 

I started to lazily drag myself back to the house, disappointed I didn't catch up to the dog. I took about five steps before sensing something was watching me. I tried to ignore it, but when I saw a glimpse of white cloth and long matted black hair, I sprinted to the house. 
As I got closer, I could see the reflection of the horrid creature behind me in the window. I tripped over a stone and scrambled to get up. It was catching up to me.

 My heart raced. I kept running. My feet felt like they were dashing over embers. I knew I had to get away. 
The house wasn't that far away. I just had to make it there, and I'd be fine. It couldn't get in without entreating me first. 
As I came upon the house, I could hear its mud-caked gown dragging along the leaves as it tried to catch up to me. I burst through the door and quickly shut it. I look through the window and see its gaunt figure, standing at my door, looking down. It bent down, reaching for the floor. I remembered something. I have a doormat that says come in. 

I raced for the bathroom door and grabbed the cabinet door. As I squeeze into it and sigh with respite, I hear it break through the front door. I gasped and held my breath. That's when it slinked down the hall. 
It reached the bathroom and crept through the doorway. I can see its gaping countenance looking around. Why would I go out into those woods even after everyone told me not to? I quietly tilted back, not to make a sound. 

The monster had a menacing mien. Tall and thin with deep, hollowed-out eye sockets. Its muddy white gown lay draped over its grey, washed-out, paper-like skin. Its black plume halo float above its wretched head, circling it like a symbol of death. It spoke not a word and hummed not a sound, only crawling throughout the house, wrought gashes in the walls, ripping the pictures to shreds. 

Soon the inhuman sounds surceased, and I heard it leave. I climbed out of the cabinet and saw all the slashes on the walls, the destroyed furniture, and the busted front door. I started to weep. 

As I turned away from the door, I saw a silky black feather flitting to the ground. I picked it up and set it on the only undisturbed shelf. That week I moved out. I'm writing this from my new house in the city. Everyone is acting weird and avoiding my house, and I'm not sure why.

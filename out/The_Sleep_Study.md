   “So, Jesse. What brings you to us today?”

&#x200B;

I don’t know why, but I expected Dr. Charlie Donaruma to be different, somehow. I don’t know, cold, maybe? I expected a man in his 60s with a stoic, serious expression on his face. The sort of expression that belonged on a man telling you that you had 6 months to live. Honestly, it had just made me all the more nervous about my appointment. But then again, I’ve never done well around doctors or nurses.

&#x200B;

Look, I’ll admit it. I’m a complete chickenshit when it comes to doctors. I don’t like them. All the poking and prodding just freaks me the hell out! But my girlfriend had been concerned about my breathing at night… Or lack thereof, and my Dad had previously gone to them, so he told me to do the same. After a few months of procrastinating, I figured I might as well man up and just go. 

&#x200B;

Contrary to my expectations though, Dr. Donaruma had a warm smile and gentle voice that helped set me at ease. Her curly blonde hair was done up in a large, slightly messy bun. She had a warm, comforting smile, a gentle, almost soothing voice and perhaps most obvious, she wasn’t a man in his 60s with a stoic, serious expression and grave demeanor. She’d come into the room with a friendly ‘Hi!’ and a little wave before introducing herself and upon speaking to her, I already felt as if I were talking to a friend I’d known for years.

&#x200B;

  “It’s my breathing when I’m asleep. My girlfriend’s been telling me for a while that I tend to stop breathing during the night. Then I start gasping for air.”

  “I see. And you haven’t noticed this yourself, right?”  
   “No. Not at all.”

  “Alright. Do you snore?”

 “Yeah… She… Um… kinda complains about that too…”

&#x200B;

Dr. Donaruma offered a comforting smile.

  “Nothing to be embarrassed about.” She assured me. “No need to be self-conscious here. Trust me, I’ve seen everything. Now, let’s talk about the quality of your sleep… How do you feel when you wake up? Rested? Still tired?”

  “Um, depends on the day, I guess?” I said, “Still tired, usually.”

  “I see. So you’re not getting restful sleep, then. Okay.” 

&#x200B;

She jotted something down on her notepad before smiling at me again.

  “Okay…” She said again, “Well. I should ask. Have you ever done a sleep study before? Do you know how it goes?”

  “Nope.”

  “Well, let me walk you through it. Come on!”

&#x200B;

Dr. Donaruma opened her office door and waved me out. I followed her into the hallway and down towards one of the several bedrooms that lined it. I could see some people sitting in a couple of them but didn’t get a good look at them as she spoke.

&#x200B;

  “So, we’ll provide you with pajamas and everything. Just make sure to return them before you leave or there is a charge… Although I don’t see why you’d want them, they’re not exactly stylish.” She laughed at her own joke as we stopped in front of one of the bedrooms. There was a queen sized bed with plain white sheets against one wall and a small chair against another. Otherwise, the room seemed mostly empty.

&#x200B;

  “I’ll get Abby and Bea to help me get you set up. Then all you need to do is try and get some sleep!”

  “Do people usually have a lot of trouble sleeping here?” I asked.

  “Sometimes.” He admitted, “It’s weird being away from home, I know. They’re used to their partner in their bed or their own familiar surroundings. It’s okay if you don’t sleep through the night! Just rest, try to sleep, and do your best. You’d be surprised how much information we can get from your best. If you can’t get back to sleep, let someone know and we can unhook you and send you back home. If you don’t feel rested enough to drive, we can also call a taxi for you.”

&#x200B;

That actually sounded a little comforting. I honestly hadn’t been sure if I’d even be able to get any sleep. Sure, I was kinda tired… But sleeping in a strange bed, hooked up to all sorts of weird equipment just seemed like it’d be too distracting.

&#x200B;

Dr. Donaruma left me to get changed into the pajamas. She was right. They didn’t look nice and they weren’t exactly comfortable. I’m a bit of a bigger guy, so most clothes don’t fit me. I’m not just talking about my weight either. Sure. I need to shed some pounds and I could absolutely stand to live a healthier life. But there’s no diet in the world to make you shorter. Even if I’d been slim and sexy though, those pajamas would still not have been flattering. 

&#x200B;

About ten minutes or so after I got dressed into my pajamas, a nurse came in. She was kinda cute, with reddish hair and a charming smile. She didn’t say much, but her nametag read ‘Abby’.

&#x200B;

She walked me through the nodes they’d be setting up as she started gluing them to my body. Nodes on my shoulders, nodes on my legs, on my chest and a whole fuckton of them on my head. They even had a tube just under my nose to monitor my breathing. The sticky substance they used to adhere them to me seeped into my hair and I didn’t like the way it felt, but otherwise I almost felt okay.

&#x200B;

  “Do you need anything to help you sleep?” She offered, “I can get you a pill.”

  “Yeah… That’d be nice, actually.” I said. The nurse offered me a warm smile before taking off and coming back with a cup of water and a small cup with a sleeping pill in it.

&#x200B;

When she left again, Dr. Donaruma came in. 

  “How are you feeling?” She asked, “Feeling cozy?”

  “About as much as I can.” I said, “So, do I need to keep this stuff on all night?”

  “I’m afraid so… But don’t worry. It’s just for tonight. Anyways. I’m going to go into the next room to do a few tests. You’ll hear my voice over the intercom in a little bit. Then, either Abby or Bea will come in and get you a blanket and some pillows to help you get settled. Then, all you need to do is sleep. If you need to use the bathroom, you let one of us know. There’s a button by your bed you can push. We’ll get you unplugged and plugged back in. Or if you want to stay up, there’s a TV in the next room. Some people like to watch it for a bit before they sleep.”

  “I should be good.” I said, “One of your nurses, Abby gave me something.”

  “Oh, perfect! Well, we’ll be done in a bit and you can sleep!”

&#x200B;

She offered one more parting smile before she left and headed into the next room.

&#x200B;

I lay down on the bed. I was starting to feel the drowsiness come on, and wondered if maybe I’d be able to doze off after all… When Dr. Donaruma started giving her instructions, I barely heard some of them. At her request, I lifted my arms, rolled over and tried a few different positions for her to calibrate. Then, she left me to my rest.

&#x200B;

A different nurse, Bea came in a few minutes later with a pillow and a blanket. They weren’t comfortable but they were enough, and as I settled into bed I started to think that maybe this wouldn’t be so bad… I didn’t think I’d fall asleep so fast, but I guess the sleeping pills really did their work. 

&#x200B;

I woke up groggy, uncomfortable and disoriented. My brain was foggy… I wasn’t sure where I was. The cold nodes pressed against my skin were strange. I almost tugged at them before remembering… I opened my eyes before trying to move my arm. No luck.

&#x200B;

My arm wouldn’t move. 

&#x200B;

I felt a slight stab of panic, but it was dulled by how out of it I was. Maybe this was just a dream? I tried to move my fingers. Still no luck. I lay motionless on the bed for a while, before closing my eyes and trying to go back to sleep. I was still groggy and out of it… I knew I was supposed to be here. But I didn’t know much else, and sleep called to me.

&#x200B;

I’m not entirely sure how long my eyes were closed. Maybe I did go back to sleep. It was hard to say…

&#x200B;

But when I opened my eyes again, I saw that the door to my room was open. I stared at it, looking at the light spilling in from the hallway.

&#x200B;

Two figures approached me, barely more than shadows in my blurry vision. I felt the bed shift as one of them climbed in with me, gently rolling me onto my back. I caught a glimpse of her face.

&#x200B;

I knew this woman… Where had I seen her before…

&#x200B;

I remembered! She was the one who’d brought me my blankets! Now she peeled them off my body and lifted my sleeves.

&#x200B;

From the corner of my eye, I noticed the other figure doing something to my arm. She was feeling around, as if looking for a vein. Then, she swabbed it down and reached for a needle.

&#x200B;

I felt a primal stab of panic that woke me up. Maybe it’s childish of me, but I really didn’t want to get a needle! I thought there wouldn’t be any bloodwork? But she just put that needle in my arm. My body didn’t respond.

&#x200B;

I was still immobilized… My muscles didn’t move. As she started to draw blood, all I could do was watch with wide eyed terror and tell myself that this was normal. I was half right… This was the most normal part of what they did…

&#x200B;

I watched as the nurse at my arm, Abby, filled up a bag with my blood… She worked quietly, never really bothering to look at me. It made what she did feel almost professional. When the first bag was full, she just wordlessly hooked me up to a second one.

&#x200B;

I felt myself tensing up at the thought of having more of my blood taken… I already felt so weak…The nurse on top of me, Bea just watched me throughout the ordeal.

&#x200B;

  “That the last one?” I heard her ask.

  “Yes. Let’s not take too much. There’s still others.”

  “Of course… How about a taste to tide us over though?”

Abby looked up, cracking a small smile.

  “Just a little one… Don’t bite too deep. Let’s not hurt him too much.”

&#x200B;

Bea just chuckled and leaned in towards me. I could hear her taking a deep inhale as her face pressed against my neck.

  “Succulent…” She purred, before undoing my pajamas. I didn’t know what she was about to do… But then. I felt it.

The pressure from a bite. 

No. Worse than a bite. A bite shouldn’t have hurt that bad! This felt like she tore into my skin!

&#x200B;

Bea let out a satisfied sigh as I felt her lapping up my blood. Her warm tongue ran over my wound as she drank down a few mouthfuls of it before pulling away.

  “Oh, this one is delicious! Abby, try some!”

Abby was nearly done with the second bag and held up a finger. She finished her work, before taking the needle out of me. Then, she rolled up my sleeve until it was just below the shoulder.

I braced myself for the pain of a second bite. This one didn’t hurt as bad… That didn’t seem like a good thing.

&#x200B;

As they drank my blood, I lay there in silent horror… Praying to whatever God was listening that this ordeal would end soon. Bea brought her mouth back down to my neck to swallow more mouthfuls of my blood… And that proved to be more than I could take.

&#x200B;

My vision faded. I felt so weak… So light. I slipped away into unconsciousness quietly, with neither of my tormentors realizing I was ever aware of it.

&#x200B;

I wasn’t sure if I’d wake up the next morning… But I did. When I woke up, I still felt weak. My body still felt light and uneasy. It was like being drunk, but so much worse.

&#x200B;

A few moments after I woke, my door opened and I flinched, fearing what I’d see… The nurse who came in wasn’t Abby or Bea. It was someone else. Someone I didn’t recognize.

  “Wake up call!” She said sweetly, “We’ll send someone in to disconnect you shortly, then you’re free to go!”

I almost started crying.

&#x200B;

Another nurse came in later just as promised. She unhooked me from the machines and as she worked, Dr. Donaruma came in. She still wore a sunny smile and looked just as upbeat as she had last night.

&#x200B;

  “Good morning, Jesse!” She said, “Sleep alright?”

  “Y-yeah…” I murmured. The second my arm was free. I looked at the spot where the needle had been.

The mark was faint… But it was there.

  “D-did you guys do bloodwork last night?” I asked, my voice still shaking.

&#x200B;

Dr. Donaruma frowned.

  “Bloodwork? We don’t do bloodwork here.”

I felt my weak heart flutter anxiously.

  “You don’t…” I repeated.

&#x200B;

Dr. Donaruma drew nearer to me. I saw her eyes flicker down towards the mark on my arm… She seemed to look at something near my shoulder too. She reached out a gentle hand to pull the neckline of my pajamas aside.

  “What’s that…?” She murmured, “That happen last night? Could be they put the equipment on too rough…”

&#x200B;

Her tone was difficult to read… But it didn’t sound so sure of what she was saying. She sounded like she was making up some sort of excuse. The way her brow furrowed told me more than she ever probably would. She didn’t look confused… She looked disturbed.

&#x200B;

I knew she saw something in that wound… Some meaning in it. Maybe she knew what happened?

  “It hurts…” I murmured, “Christ…”

  “It looks like it does. Let me get you some gauze. We’ll get that treated before you go.”

She offered a weak smile before turning to leave. But I had one more question.

  “What about the bloodwork?”

&#x200B;

Dr. Donaruma paused by the door.

  “Oh… A dream, probably. The medication we give can cause some weird ones… Especially if you wake up in the night. It’s a side effect…” She paused, before asking: “Abby gave you that, right? Or was it Bea?”

  “One of them… Abby I think. Speaking of which, where are they…”

  “Gone home for the morning, I’m afraid. They’re only here overnight. I’ll talk to them about how rough they put the nodes on…”

With that, she left.

&#x200B;

The new nurse was the one who dressed the wounds on my shoulder and arm… She said they were just ‘scratches’. But I’ve seen the wounds at home now… They don’t look like scratches. They look like bites.

&#x200B;

I don’t think it was ‘just a dream’ I had that night at the sleep study. I don’t think Dr. Donaruma believed that either… I think she was just explaining it away. But despite that, whatever happened that night, I don’t think she was in on it…

&#x200B;

They found Abby’s body in Lake Ontario last week. I haven’t heard anything about Bea, but she wasn’t there when I went in for my followup appointment with Dr. Donaruma. She didn’t seem so upbeat when I saw her last. Her tone was quieter, more reserved. She smiled less and when she did smile, it seemed more forced…

&#x200B;

I don’t know what she did, or if she did anything… [But something tells me that she’s dealt with the issue.](https://www.reddit.com/r/HeadOfSpectre/)

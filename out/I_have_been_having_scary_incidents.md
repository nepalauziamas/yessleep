To start off, let me give you a bit of a family history. My mother has two sisters, both younger than her. The three, along with my maternal grandparents lived in the outcast part of the city, before getting married. Now, my maternal grandfather has a younger brother. He has married two times. I was not yet born to see his first wife unfortunately, but I have heard plenty of her. 

She loved her husband, like any other wife with a caring husband did. She was sweet and affectionate, and loved my mother the most, making her dolls, feeding her when she was young etc. She ofcourse loved the other two as well. She was loved by the family a lot. 

But unfortunately, fate had other plans. She was diagnosed with a disease, and was bedridden. After a few weeks, she even passed away. In the house where my maternal grandparents now live in. Upon her death, my grandfather's brother (lets call him younger grandpa) was greatly shook.

A few years after that incident, my younger grandpa remarried. She is pretty and kind. Just like the previous wife. She makes sure to bring us gifts whenever we (me and my sister) visit. She was exactly like the previous wife, which I think angered her. 

The previous wife's soul was not at peace. She had a growing fire of vengeance and anger in her. She wanted revenge. But she was trapped in the house. She could not get out. So I think she decided to take revenge on my maternal grandfather. 

He has been having small incidents, involving seeing a shadow figure, hearing something uncanny, feeling weird and dreadful at random times, especially in the night. He is a man of science, hence, he was sceptical, and he is always able to come up with logical reasonings to these. But what happened recently, had no logical explanation. 

My maternal grandmother is more of a housewife, so she is rarely out of the house. But that day, I think she went somewhere out to visit someone. My grandfather is outside most of the time. So ofcourse, that day, the house was empty. Both of them had the keys for the house, as it was locked from outside. 

My grandfather arrived when it was evening. Now, he was on the main path, when he saw something. If you were to stand on the path infront of the house, you could see the inside a bit from the window. He saw that the room was dark, and there was this woman in a bun who walked into the worship room. Thinking my grandmother was home, he walked in through the gate and crossed the huge garden my grandma was so proud of. But strangely, the door was still locked from outside. That was weird. Wasn't she supposed to open it and get in? 

My grandfather decided not to pay it any heed. He unlocked and got in. He switched the lights of the house, but there was no sign of my grandmother. At that point, he was sure he was seeing things. So, he went into the kitchen to fix himself a snack. He opened the cupboard, took out a packet of puffed rice and turned around for a bowl. Now, the cupboard's door was open. He was also feeling a bit cold, and that familiar feeling of dread was back. He felt like he was being watched. He turned around. And no sooner did he, than a glass jar fell from the cupboard and broke. And just like that, all that chillness and dread was gone. As if nothing had went wrong in the first place. My grandfather had just stared at the broken piece of glass infront of him, and it sure dragged the sleep out of him. 


And what does all this have to do with me? Let me tell you this as well. My aunts, that is, my mother's sisters, have faced similar situations to my grandfather, involving seeing a shadow figure of a woman. My mother never did, and claimed that she requested my younger grandpa's first wife to not to show herself to my mother. So maybe thats why she never saw her. But I think I did. This is why. 

When I was in 6th grade, I used to stay alone with my sister A LOT. Having two working parents, We had to grow up a lot sooner. It was an evening, around 7:30 PM. I remember sitting and doing my maths sums peacefully (if that didn't involve almost ripping my hair out because of the hard sums, that is). My sister had went downstairs to fetch a book or something. So I was alone. For a few moments. Now, I was sitting in the living room, on a spot which allowed you to have a look into a part of the kitchen. Bored from all the sums, I looked infront of me at the dark kitchen. For a split second, I am VERY SURE of seeing this apparition  of a woman in a white dress and long black hair. Her face was VERY blurry, and the bottom part of her body was flowy and not visible, almost. I had started howling. And by howling, I mean it. I was screaming while crying, and I was sure I'd call the neighbours. My sister came running up, inquiring me about what's wrong. But I could not comprehend coherent words. And then I pointed at the kitchen, all the while blabbering rubbish. She was a 7th grader. And what do you expect from a 7th grader who is home alone when her sister starts crying claiming she had seen something? She got scared as well, and we both ran down. When my parents got home, We ranted everything to them. They didn't seem to believe me, but I KNOW what I saw. That incident gives me the chills everytime. But that's not the end to this. 


I had also been smelling this strange smell of a ladies perfume, in a certain part of the house. And it's quite often. At first, I thought it was one of the pedestrians', the smell carried by the wind, but that would mean the smell should be everywhere. It was always uncanny to me. And even more so when my sister recently came up to me, saying that she smelled the exact same smell in our new house, while the lights flickered. 

Recently, I had this weird dream. It was the strangest dream ever. I was walking down the basement of some old rundown, when I saw this woman at the foot of the stairs. And guess what? She had a white gown on and a bun. 

Exactly like the woman my grandfather saw. 

I had walked down and past her. She had a really sombre face on, and didn't seem to notice me. I continued walking forward, all the while keeping an eye on her. Suddenly, I heard this noise infront of me. Looking forward, I stopped. I vividly remember the horrific face of my younger grandpa's recent wife, chasing me down the hallway. I turned back to run up the stairs, just to see the lady in white gown cry tears of blood with her mouth open. I had ran up the stairs, and on looking down, I had seen both the women staring up at me from the foot of the stairs. It felt more like a nightmare. 

Nothing much happened after I moved into this new house, except for that nightmare and my sister's experience. But I am sure there is no end to this. I have been told I have quite an active imagination, and that whatever my mind pictures, I see it infront of me. But none of these felt like a hallucination. None of these.

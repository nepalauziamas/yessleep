The first name I gave him was [here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/xecqj2/theres_a_creature_living_in_my_walls_and_i_dont/)  This is how I came up with the second:

&#x200B;

My gums turn to sandpaper, my tongue swelling in my mouth. I can’t handle him tonight. I can’t give him another name and do this to someone else. I won’t. I’ll—

There’s a knock at the door. “N-Nick? Are you awake?”

*Piper.* 

My heart thrashes as the door creaks open. She can’t come in here, not *now.* 

Not with *him* here.

But, in more than a year, he’s only ever talked to me, never Piper, and she needs me right now. I can feel the panic radiating off of her. Can hear it trembling in her ten-year-old voice.

“Hey there. You okay?” I ask.

“Can I sleep with you tonight?”

“Of course. Get in here.” I lift the sheets and pat the bed. She used to sleep with me all the time when she was little, slipping into my room clutching her teddy bear while complaining about nightmares. But I knew that was a lie. She came in when the fighting got too rough, back when Dad would lose his temper with Mom, and the snap of his voice would pour through the house like dull claps of thunder.

I drape an arm around her as she slides in next to me and realize she’s shivering. 

“What’s the matter? You have a bad dream or something?”

She shakes her head, a length of her hair tickling my chin.

“What then?”

“It was—” She shudders, lets out a sob. 

“Go on. You can tell me. You know that, right?”

She nods, going quiet for a long moment before she says, “It was Dad. He was in my room again.”

I stiffen, every wasted muscle in my body snapping taut. My throat glues itself shut as I run a hand over her head and soothe her until her breathing evens out. Then, I lie there wide awake and think of Mom lying dead-eyed on the bathroom floor, a storm of pills scattered around her lifeless fingers like fallen snowflakes. I think of the hem of her sweater hiked up just enough for me to see the purple patch of stomach peeking through, and the fist-sized bruises near her hip. 

Dad always liked to keep his handiwork hidden. 

I lie cardboard-stiff for hours, waiting…

And waiting… 

Staring at the wall. Unable to sleep, willing him to appear.

Near three a.m., I finally catch a flicker of movement above my headrest, that familiar serriform grin bubbling to the surface. A wallpaper talon extends from the wall, dipping gently to twirl a lock of Piper’s hair.

“I like this one. Is this to be my gift? Is this to be my next name?”

“No,” I reply, trying to steady my voice. “No, not her.” *Never her.* “Someone else. I have your name.”

\#

In the morning, I wake Piper and have her wheel me into the kitchen, which has been outfitted for me—the one thing Dad’s done right since we moved in. I make us a breakfast of scrambled eggs with sausage and orange juice and strawberry jam toast just like Mom used to. I even draw a smiley-face sunshine on Piper’s napkin as I set the table.

It doesn’t help. 

We eat in silence, Piper barely touching her food—just pushing it around her plate while glancing at Dad’s bedroom door off the kitchen like she expects it to burst open at any moment. 

She stands a few minutes before the bus arrives and dons her backpack. As she turns to leave, I take hold of her arm and say, “Piper, that stuff with Dad, it’s never going to happen again. Ever. You don’t have to worry about him anymore, okay?”

Her eyes wilt, her lips pressing together in a thin line. She suddenly looks so like Mom with her chocolate-brown hair and her soft bubble of a nose, it hurts. 

“Piper, I promise.”

She gives me a quick nod, her eyes flicking to her feet, and I can tell she doesn’t believe me. 

After she leaves, after I tell her how much I love her, I stare at Dad’s door for the longest time, my fingers vice-gripping the armrests of my wheelchair until my forearms feel like blocks of cement. Finally, after an hour, I roll over to knock once, twice, three times.

“Hello?”

I expect to hear his graveled voice telling me to fuck off, for him to yell at me to go away like he does every morning when I wake him up for my ride to school. 

But no response comes.

Hesitantly, I turn the knob and roll into his room. Dust motes clutter the air, the carpet scattered with piles of dirty laundry: grease-stained tee-shirts intermixed with a bunch of torn jeans and crumpled polos.

An empty bottle of Jack Daniels lies cockeyed on his dresser, the room reeking like he hasn’t opened a window in weeks. 

“Dad?” I say, wheeling toward the bed.

And even though I can make out his form beneath the blankets, there’s no answer. He just lies there motionless.

I call out again. More silence. 

The last time I woke him from a whiskey-soaked bender, I got a black eye for my trouble—which is why I brace myself as I reach out and give his comforter a tug. It rustles down over something thin and fibrous, the sound like that of a grocery sack tearing. Only, what I find beneath is no grocery sack. 

It’s wallpaper. Miles of it.

The ugly brown and yellow striped stuff like on the walls of his room, winding from beneath his bed and running up and around his arms, his torso and legs. It covers his skull and forms a cup over his mouth. A long black stain leaks down the wall above his headboard, and his head is angled back toward it in a sick fashion that makes me think he saw it coming…whatever it was.

I find a crease in the wallpaper near his chest and take hold of it. Sprinkles of sand shiver through as I pull, streams of grit spilling onto the bed and scattering to the floor. I know I should stop, that I should turn and wheel myself out of the room, but I can’t, my fingers working away as beads of sweat erupt across my forehead, my back. And then I’m ripping the wallpaper off in chunks, tearing into it like a toddler on Christmas morning who’s anxious for his shiny new toy. Except what I find beneath is anything but shiny. All that’s left of him is a pile of bones half-buried in sand, no flesh, no organs.

Nausea churns through my intestines, and I nearly retch, but somehow I manage to keep ripping and tearing, uncovering the remains of a pitted femur and the small bones of his wrist. 

His skull. 

It’s bleached white, the eye sockets two black pits of tar peeking through all the matted grit.

After a while, I don’t know how long, I turn and roll out of the room. Drifts of sand crunch beneath my wheels, my stomach spasming with disgust mixed with a sick satisfaction that it’s finally over. Piper never has to worry about him again.

*Piper.* It hits me like a brick to the face. The Wallpaper Man won’t stop without a third name, and I know who he wants. 

The thought sends waves of gooseflesh rippling down my arms. It can’t happen, and I won’t let it. I have his final name. I’ve had it all along.

I think I need to give him my own...

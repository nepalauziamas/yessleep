This is how it started… 

We have this neighbour who moved here recently, a stocky, 64 year old German man (Mr. Meyers) and I started to exchange small talk with him when we passed him while I was walking my 5-year-old son home from school. 

We did this for around a month, him sometimes walking with us as we went, and then it started to get weird. He was asking questions like:
‘How old is your son?’
‘Do you go out often, and who looks after your son?’ 
‘Is your husband usually home?’

I mean, these questions aren’t overly creepy but enough for me to try to avoid him when I can. Then he started to walk with my son and I to school, saying he was seeing his sister who lived nearby. Then, he would start walking home with us too. 

After two months this was normal. Mr. Meyers was kind of like a friend, he was nice and I had gotten used to his awkward social quirks and random questions, brushing them off each time. 

So I invited him for tea one day after school and he gratefully accepted. He was weirdly obsessed with my son, all he wanted to do was play with him, talk to him and talk to me about him. I thought it was cute. I thought it was cute…

He came round loads after that and had quite a bond with my son, my boy would even ask me when Mr. Meyers would next come round. 

Mr. Meyers constantly offered to look after him, with I kindly refused as I still felt kind of shifty about it. 

Last week, my son was in bed when I heard him saying, ‘hello! Come play, come play!’ 
When I came up I asked him why he was saying that and he said, ‘Mr. Meyers! He was waving at me and shouting for me! He wanted to play.’ 
I looked outside his window and in the darkness saw a figure running down the street. Now, it was ten at night, something fishy was going on. 

We walked a different route home from school after that, and to, but that didn’t stop him. This still makes me sick to the stomach. 

I leave my boy’s window open in the summer and when me and my hubby go to bed I shut it. I was staying up watching a movie and heard noise from his room so I headed upstairs and  a figure was standing there in the dark. 

‘Mr Meyers!!’ My son shouted, and I almost passed out, I froze on the spot as the figure clambered out the window. I stood there for about five minutes until my husband came to see what was up.

We called the police, he hasn’t been in his house for a week and we haven’t seen him at all. But yesterday my son said in the morning, ‘Mr. Meyers wants to play again!’ 
I asked him how often he sees him and he replied with, ‘Well, sometimes I see him outside the gates at school and sometimes at night time! He’s so funny!’ 

The police still can’t find him and I still can’t sleep. I lie in my sons bed next to him all night.

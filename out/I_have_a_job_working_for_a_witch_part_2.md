It's the witch's assistant again, Deacon. My last post ended pretty abruptly so I figured I owe you guys an update. I had to go because when I was in the middle of writing my last post when Blair gave me another assignment. By the way, one of you asked why Blair did what she'd done when we first met. The answer is simple. She wanted to. You ever read Macbeth? Yeah, most witches are like that. There's not really a logical reason why they do anything. They're just looking for entertainment and do mostly everything out of impulse. Blair told me it was something about witchcraft corrupting the soul or some shit. There's no such thing as a nice witch. Blair is alright but I doubt she'd care if I turned up missing…


Speaking of which I should probably clarify what I exactly do for Blair. I kill shit for her. Witches are very powerful beings but sometimes their hexes and their curses just don't cut it when they wanna get even with someone. When that's the case they send their 'assistants' to do their dirty work for them. In the supernatural community we are known as 'reapers'. Every competent witch has one and we do what they tell us. In return we're paid very, very handsomely and are given everything we could possibly need for work.


Speaking of work I'll tell you guys about what I've been up to since my last post. I've been in this line of work for a few years now. I'm now 25 and I'm not the same guy I was when I was 16. I'm very well built. My job requires me to be in shape and Blair made it clear that either I'd get shit done or I'd die. Not by her hands…but from the assignments themselves. I can bench about 500 pounds and I can run the 30 meter sprint in just over 3 seconds. I'm usually equipped with military grade hardware and have whatever bullshit Blair gives me. Sometimes it's just bullets that are blessed by a witch doctor and sometimes its a wooden knife with dead man's blood on it.


When I'd just gotten done with my last post Blair informed me that I'd be hunting another witch. This was…odd and very dangerous even by my standards


"Hey, handsome~ I've got another job for you~


Blair's words oozed darkness and temptation…like she was a crossroads demon wanting to make a deal for my soul. With a heavy sigh I'd turn to look at her


"What is it-"


I stopped, realizing Blair wasn't standing in my doorway where I'd heard her…I then felt a cold hand touch my shoulder…it's grip soft but clearly intended to seem sudden. I jumped up and turned around


"Damnit, Blair! I told you not to do that!"


Blair had a shit eating grin on her face as she stood behind my chair…she knew just how to push my buttons. I kill demons, wendigos and even an angel once for a living but even she knew how to get me jumpy. 


"Oh come on~ Just messing around with my favorite boy scout~ I've got some work for you."


Blair handed me the same black folder she made for me with every assignment. It was solid black with a red stamp that was in the shape of a pentagram with a giant 'B' in the center. The file itself had the strong smell of brimstone, so strong it made me almost want to throw up the first few times I had smelled it. As I opened it my eyes widened…this was a fucking suicide mission. Blair wanted me to go after a witch that had gone crazy from messing with forces from beyond their control.


"Blair…you've got to be kidding me. How in the fuck am I supposed to kill a witch? What about their reaper?


I'd only questioned Blair a few times and everytime I did she gave me that same damn look of amusement, like she was amused by my ignorance. She'd place her cold hand on my cheek and stare into my eyes with her same black, featureless eyes…my entire body shivered and I couldn't move. Blair would then pat my cheek as she noticed my discomfort


"Their reaper is dead, Deek and they're far to gone to cast any harmful spell…they're just like any other beast I send you to put down. Now be a good boy, strap on your boosts, and get down to Alabama to take care of it. Make sure you use fire."


With that Blair's body disappeared with a puff of black smoke and I was left alone once again…


"Fuck…"


I whispered under my breath, beginning to pack the next day. The trip down to Alabama was uneventful. I stopped at a few hotels, ate when I was hungry, and slept when I was tired. 


When I finally got down to Alabama I made my way over to the witches lair…of course it was some decrepit ass house in the woods…the worst part however were the scare crows. All around the house were these…scarecrows, each with different clothes and a disgusting smell of death and rot (I later figured out these were basically voodoo dolls). I made my way past a few and I made my way to the front door and kicked it in. As I stepped in I heard shuffling from upstairs and before I knew it a pale, naked woman ran down on all fours and pounced at me. She had no hair on her body and I'm not joking when I said she was pale. I'm talking snow colored. Her teeth were also uncomfortably white… I couldn't react in time and it bit my fucking foot. I had steel toe boots so I was fine but the thing just kept biting down, making an almost feral growling noise…


"Hey! You little shit! Cut it out I'll blow your damn head off!"


To my surprise…the thing actually did stop. It stopped growling and looked up at me. It was still biting my boot but it wasn't biting nearly as hard. But get this, the damn thing started looking at my boot and then back at me over and over again…no fucking way…it was trying to decide if I was bluffing. 


"I'm not joking. You better fuckin not!"


As I said this out of what seemed to be spite the damn thing started to bite down again and jerk, like it was trying to tear my boots in half. Being the rational one here I grabbed my side arm, a trusty 9mm handgun. I unloaded 2 rounds into it's skull and it fucking grabbed my leg and through me across the room and into what seemed to be a living room. I landed hard onto a coffee table smashed straight through the glass. I'd cut my arm pretty bad and I  know have a 4 inch piece of glass in my shoulder


"Agh…You little bastard…"


I winced and noticed my handgun was gone. I must've let it go when I was thrown…meanwhile the thing that had thrown was spazzing out and writhing on the ground


"A̴̔̂̐̆̚͠ǵ̶̢̧̨̭̼̥̮̪̹̲̱͉͎͇̥̬͑̓̍̎̈́͋͋ͅg̸̀̽͋̃͋̉̀ḡ̸̓̑̆͊͌͛͘͠g̸͂͐ģ̵̧̨̙͖̯̫̻͚͕̜̤̱̤͕̳̬̗͕̔̃͝ḩ̸̡̧̹̺͖̼̪͚̳̹̩̩̮̺̖͈̖̗̪͈̹̖̀̋͝͠h R̷̾̇̎̇̀̽͝A̷̧̨̻̬̤̣͇̳͓͔͈̪̬͈̼͍̙̭̖̜̯͈̗̞͔̘̗̼͕͈͈̱̗͉̣̐̅͑͊͊̔̋̀͘ͅH̵̡̨̧̧̛̥̱̲̻̰̩͈̖̲̬̺̩̠̼̟̫̩͔̘̜͈̠̰͎̏̓̈́̏̌̅̇͜͜͝H̵̎̓͂͛̆̒̍͌́͒̀̕͝H̴̤̼͖̬̥̬̟͎̘̐̃̈͛̋̍̚H̵̨̡̛̛͈̩̲̹̠̠̱͙̩̜̥͇̮̦͕̠̹̰̙̤̮̪͎͓̗̤̥͈̥̝̻̹̣͙͙̘̠̾͂̈̏͋̍͜͝ͅH̷̛̊̒͑͗͋̀̾̈̿̀̑́̀͑H̸̊̈́́̎̉͒̍̅̈́̄̐͘" 




This thing sounded demonic…it's groans sounded like the groans of 3 different people and as I got back up, it'd run at me again and launched itself into me like a missle. I felt its skull crack one of my ribs as I flew out of the house. This place was pretty rotted so it wasn't a surprise that my weight sent me straight through a wall and back onto the front lawn. As I hit the ground inlet out a groan…


"What the fuck is that thing…"


Usually the shit I hunt is…well scary. This thing just seemed to be short of a few chromosomes and needed to attend church. I got up and and limped back to my car as I heard the thing freaking the fuck out inside the house. It was like when you stuff a scared cat in a box…I could hear the damn thing jumping up and down off the walls and basically trashing the place. I stuck my arm into the back seat of my car and pulled out my shotgun. This thing was a beast. It was the top of the line custom made 12 gauge that was currently loaded with dragon breath rounds. Now look…I'd never actually shot these before and the only knowledge I had on them was that you get to use them in black ops 1 for a single mission but HOLY SHIT these things were awesome. I went back into the house and when that little freak charged me again I blew it's face apart with a single round. Yeah, no matter how tough you are dragon breath rounds with fuck you up.


"I told you I'd blow your head off! You fucker!"


I yelled, feeling pretty damn good besides the rib…but then I remembered…I was here to kill a witch. When I realized that I was pretty much alone in this house I looked down at the now headless body…


"No…Surely not…"


I said, smirking a little. I'd use the shotgun, making the thing's body roll over by using the gun like a stick…


"So much for a suicide mission."


the thing definitely was female…and crazy as shit. I decided that this was the only thing out here so it had to be…I picked up the body and took it outside. I then used some of those smelly scarecrows to make a burn pile. I like to do viking burials for some of the creatures I kill…the ones that used to be human. As the sun went down I poured some gas on the pile and lit a match…it was nice. There wasn't a sound out here. Not even crickets. I learned against the hood of my car and took a swig out of the flask I always had on me as lake shore drive started to play over my radio. It was at that point I noticed Blair was leaning on the hood as well right next to me


"Ah! Damnit Blair stop doing tha-!"


I jumped a little but stopped…Blair was just staring at the burn pile with a look on her face I'd never quite seen on her before. She looked…sad. I would go back to a more relaxed posture


"You knew her…"


I said in a more sympathetic tone than I'd meant to. Blair seemed to appreciate it though and she'd smile for a second, not looking at me but instead staring into the blaze


"My sister."


Blair said in a softer tone than how she usually spoke. I was speechless…I turned back to the pile and kind of felt bad. I'd silently offer my flask to her and she accepted, grabbing it and drinking about half of my Jack Daniels.


"Only an idiot like you would drink this crap…Thanks, deek…I appreciate it..."


Blair rarely ever called me by my actual name...I could tell this was hurting a lot more then she let on... But after saying that she gave me what she considered payment for this mission. A hug. I probably would've argued with her about that but…I can't exactly yell at her for not paying me to kill her sister. Plus I think the hug was for her more than me. I graciously accepted and hugged her back…Blair asked me to leave after that. I didn't argue and I left her out there in the woods. As I drove away I couldn't help but think how shitty this job is…but then my phone buzzed. '1 new message from: Angel❤️' 


"No fucking way."

My husband locked me in the spare bedroom hours ago. I was lying on the couch in the living room, reading, when he called out for me. I found him in the spare room and when I walked in, he pushed past me and locked the door. 

I thought he was pranking me or joking around but he said, “it’s safe in here. Do not make a sound. I’m not kidding Grace. When you hear this knock, it’s safe to come out. If the door unlocks but you don’t hear that knock, do not open the door.” Then he knocked a special knock. 

“Repeat it, so I know you know it,” he called. 

“What the hell is going on? Jack this isn’t funny. You better let me out right now,” I shouted, banging on the door. 

“Do the goddamn knock Grace. Do not make a sound. I’m serious. I’ll tell you when it’s safe. I love you.” 

I’d never heard him sound so aggressive. I repeated his knock, and then I heard him walk away. 

I paced the room. I was worried but I trusted Jack. I sat by the door for awhile hoping I’d hear something but there was only silence. I looked out the window afterwards, but all I could see was the house next to ours, and not much else. 

I decided to take a nap to pass the time. I wasn’t sure when Jack would be back and I was getting restless. Eventually I fell asleep and I dreamt that I was chained to the bed and that I was being watched. I woke up in a sweat. 

I was tempted to call out to Jack but I could hear a noise. I walked over to the door slowly and could very clearly hear heavy breathing coming from right outside the door. I tried to look through the crack under the door and saw a dark shadow. 

Suddenly I could hear knocks on the door. It wasn’t the same special knock that Jack had done. The knocks got louder and louder and soon it sounded like someone slamming their whole body against the door. 

I covered my mouth just in case, but I didn’t scream. I looked around the room for something I could use as a weapon, but the spare room is scarcely decorated. I picked up the lamp, hoping it’d suffice. 

The knocks/slams eventually stopped and the house again became silent other than my heavy breathing. I stood at the door ready with my lamp for what felt like eternity. 

The footsteps started a long time later. First they were moving so quickly and quietly, but then the became slow and loud. With every heavy thud, they were getting louder and louder. Closer and closer. 

Whoever was there unlocked the door. Then I heard the knock. Jack’s special knock. “You can come out now Grace.”

It didn’t sound like Jack though. It sounded like someone mimicking Jack. 

I didn’t dare speak. I stood there, clutching my lamp, holding my breath, saying a silent prayer. 

“YOU CAN COME OUT NOW GRACE!” The voice yelled over and over, piercing my ears. And then again, the silence. 

Every so often I can hear the sound of chains. And every so often the footsteps approach the door and do Jack’s special knock, and I’m told I can come out. The mimic is getting closer and closer to the sound of my Jack, but I know it’s not him. I know it’s not safe.

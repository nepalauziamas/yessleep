I got my new phone. More cameras than I knew what to do with originally. Until, that is, I learned of one of the really great features of those cameras. I can zoom out to 16x!!! The most surprising thing is how clear the picture is at that distance. You can even see small details from well across the street.

I wouldn't at all consider myself a Peeping-Tom, but curiosity and wonder got the better of me.

The house im in is across the street from a really nice apartment complex. Every apartment has a big balcony and large windows. Because it was only this house and a few others across the street, the people who lived there had a tendency to leave their curtains open all day and night. So...you can probably see where this is going.

One apartment in particular caught my eye. It was what I assumed to be (correctly now that I know more) was your typical young, white, straight couple. From what I could see they had a well stocked kitchen. I saw aLe Creuset cast iron skillet among their cookware, several brand name products clearly visible by their labels (though I was very surprised how many carbohydrates were in Ben and Jerry's pints of ice cream (42 grams per serving, they should cut back!) and even some very expensive makeup brands according to what a Google search revealed. The detail really was incredible on this new phone. All in all, I got a decently well off vibe from them.

So I watched through my camera. 

I watched as the man kept answering the phone, getting visibly angry, then hanging up. All in the span of a few moments. 

I watched as he received letters. I knew what they all said.  There were to many to tell about, but the gist was that his girlfriend had been seeing another man. They had some serious arguments. He looked angry, and she looked confused and upset.

Her emotions went all over the place as the fights became more frequent. I saw her fluxuate between angry, sad, and confused. Though...after a while it was mostly just sad. 

It got pretty bad for a while. I watched him act friendly when they were together, but alone...he was like a jealous rage monster. It got to the point where any time I saw her in the kitchen and him in the bedroom at night, he would be reading all the messages sent from her phone.

It only took a week before he found evidence of her cheating on him. I watched as he confronted her. She denied it. He hit her. She threw him out. 

 Let me tell you, she looked like a total wreck. As I  watched her cry herself to exhaustion, it was clear to me that this whole situation had emotionally taken its toll on her.


Why am I sharing this story? Because it's finally time for her to meet me for  the first time and I just had to tell someone. It was just going to be a pretty typical one-and-done, but the moment I first used that zoom feature I knew that it was going to be different. With a clarity of purpose I had rarely experienced before I knew the potential of this.


I mean, it really is great how detailed camera phones have gotten. Being able see every inch of someone's home in that quality opened my eyes to just how often people leave their doors unlocked. Yes, tonight was one of those lucky nights. After all my hard work and all the time I've already spent there over the last  few weeks I'm excited to finally move in!!!

Hmm...I wonder if the people across the street leave their curtains open all day and night?

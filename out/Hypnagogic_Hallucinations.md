Before I start, let me explain what a hypnagogic hallucination is. This is a type of hallucination that occurs as you’re falling asleep. As said by Google they can be visual, auditory, or sensory in nature or all three at the same time. 

Now you may be wondering…why is there a question mark? Well that’s where this story gets interesting because I’m not sure if this is hypnagogic or paranormal. 

About 9 months ago I was just casually sitting around. For a little more context, I lived with my parents at the time and was a few months pregnant, which is irrelevant, but I often had naps. My parents house was built in 2003 and we moved in after it was finished being built. We were the first people to live in that home. The neighbourhood was new as well, as the area used to just be fields. 

As I was saying, I was laying around the house and my dad came up the stairs and told me an event that happened that he thought was strange. My dad isn’t one to be spooked and often times recommends me horror movies or shows to watch. So he explained to me this…

As he was falling asleep for his nap, he heard someone whisper in his ear his name. He said it was so clear and such a chilling voice that he sat straight up. The voice sounded female, but sounded raspy. 

I laughed and jokingly said maybe he was being haunted. Obviously I was making a joke because given the history of our house there wasn’t anything that would make me think it could be haunted. 

Fast forward a couple more months and I was laying on the couch in the living room. For context this couch is different than the one my dad was napping on, and for more context both these couches were bought new, not used. As I was laying on the couch and falling asleep I heard a woman whisper in my ear my name. I instantly shot up and looked to my left which is the ear I heard the whisper in. Nothing was there…but nothing could’ve been there because this couch was placed against a wall, and laying on my back would put my left side to the back of the couch.

I laid back down, convincing myself that my mind was playing tricks on me because I was in that stage of almost being asleep but still awake. 

Not even a minute later I smelt something. I opened my eyes again and felt this sense of calmness. I recognized the smell. It was floral, but so faint that it wasn’t overwhelming. It took me a minute but I realized how I recognized the scent.

Once many years ago I was at my aunts house and I had been playing with this scarf made up of very thin material. My aunt ended up letting me take it home with me when my mom picked me up. I loved that thing and I slept with it that night because it smelled just like my aunt, who I had a very close relationship with. When I woke up the next morning I was completely covered in hives. My parents were convinced I was allergic to the perfume that was on the scarf and took it away from me.

The scent that came across me after I heard the whisper was that scent. My aunt passed away many years ago though, before I even started high school. I am now done college. 

I actually stood up and walked around the house, trying to figure out where the scent was coming from. I never found anything. I was home alone as well so nobody was burning any candles or spraying anything scented. I couldn’t nap after this so I instead just watched some YouTube. 

Nothing else happened.

Fast forward to a couple months before my baby was due, I was packing my stuff up into boxes because I was moving out into my own apartment. As I was packing up my closet I found a piece of clothing that was not mine. It was a thin white sheet, small enough to sit over my shoulders or around my neck. So thin you could see through it like a veil. I realized that THIS was the scared I thought my parents took away many years ago. 

I instinctively raised it up to my face and smelt it, but it no longer smelled of my aunt’s perfume.

So…was the experience I had just a hypnagogic hallucination? 

Or was that scarf I no longer knew existed, acting as a way for my aunt to still be present?

"God damn it stupid machine! please fucking work for once. Ancient piece of shit!" Is how it sounded before I started typing this message out. Now I get that you might be a little bit confused right now but you shouldn't! Everything is fine here. Now I'm not sure which date or even year it is for you, I was planning on hitting this around 8PM on the 20th of June 2022, hopefully I've hit it right. if not, tough shit. Who am I joking? I know this went through at the right time. I mean, it was me!

Now as you've probably already figured out I made it ha-ha! I invented time travel! Suck it Einstein! Alright It might have been a bit of a road there and not as "fluent" as you'd like but hey fuck you, you didn't invent it! I make the rules! So, it's pretty damn simple now you press a button and then \*poof\* you're where you want? Isn't that cool?

Alright there is more to it then that, now time travel isn't exactly viable yet and I've only managed to send messages back in time so far, which you're reading right now. So that's pretty cool I guess. Now it's been pretty chill since we last spoke, it feels like forever! Now for me it's been almost 30 years but for you it's only been a few hours, a day ish? right? Anyway, you guys might want to know how this even happened and let me tell you. So Miranda, She's... well dead. Now Miranda happened to be a very good friend of mine so I was saddened by this to be honest so I will not speak about this any further because if I do, I know I would have stopped it. Now you all have some questions about the future so let me answer some of them for you!

To begin with, games. Yes, most of the questions were actually about games and I have 2 things to say about it. First of all, Nerd. Second of all, You've jinxed it. So Half life 3. No no that's not happening. They teased it to get some funding then the developers cashed out and ran with the cash. GTA VI actually happened but it was delayed out the window and the game was mostly shit to be honest. They decided to link GTA online between GTA VI and GTA V So it was basically the same game. Kinda sad.

There were also some "worries" about me going back in time and making them not exist. Now how important that would be or not does not really interest me, all I can say about it is simple. Watch your back. I might go back just to smack you to make you be on edge again. Now jokes aside let me tell you about the development of the "Trans-Time-Script" . Now this was my genius idea, hopefully you all got the joke, you know "Transcript" and "Time" cause it's time travel. Yeah you get it. Man, I've gotten older. I remember how my younger self hated that joke. Therefore, I had to do it again. Now the development of this has been kept in secret as part of the deal with Miranda when I got this damn job. Now I've been officially dead ever since that day I took that job, everyone thinks I got killed in a gas explosion at my warehouse. both me and Miranda thought this was a genius idea and it just so happened to be just that. So you see I have had a grand time up until this very moment actually. Cause I've been trying to send this message probably around a million times by now over the whole development phase. So if this is the one that went through, whoop whoop!

Let me tell you about this apparatus, this thing looks like an old PC from the 90's with a built in screen. it has what we call a "FDR" or Flux-disc Reader. now these Flux-discs are amazing I'm telling you. They're about the same size as a microchip but can fit up to 1 petabyte of storage so far. Now these discs are what I use to send this message, they're all different from each other and is also one of my own little inventions. This machine doesn't have a keyboard though it only has a screen that shows the information you need and nothing more. So you can't really browse the internet through it nor can you really do anything with it besides that. It's not that exciting looking at it like that but trust me, it's pretty dope.

So today's story comes as a warning rather than a brag about time travel. You see Only one of these messages came through out of the thousands that I sent out. Now we got a response and it wasn't from me. This is how it read:

**Log entry NR:C14WT3R76509**

***Hello? is...is there anyone there? if you can hear me please help me. I've been stuck here for centuries. Please help. Fuck I should of never agreed to this shit. fuck!***

**Transmission ended...**

Now this really had me spooked up. Who the fuck would even know about this thing besides me? I'm the only one that knows about this. The others in the team don't know what we do here, they mostly do calculations without knowing what the end goal is. So you see why this had me spooked but this wasn't the creepiest part. I got this message a few days ago too.

**Log entry NR:C14WT3R76510**

***Come on you fucking idiot. It's me Big Red, can you please fucking help me I'm going insane in here!***

**Transmission ended....**

Now this really made me scared shitless. So you see, I'm Big Red. It's what my dad always used to call me when I was well, officially alive. But you see, Big Red is what I usually want to call myself on the internet or in other "Anonymous" situations...

"Fuck me" I said out loud in my office when I read this the first time.

You see, there's a few options to what has actually happened and none of them is good. Now these are my two hypotheses that I think are equally likely or well I guess unlikely.

Hypothesis 1:

The first hypothesis is that I've managed to make a time loop of sorts when trying to send out these messages. So basically when you send something back in time, what you actually do is that you "Create" an exact copy of that time line, so everything is identical from start to finish on this line besides this exact little thing. That one of the time lines managed to receive a message and the other didn't. Now this means basically that we split time in 2 which could result in one of them getting tangled. Now if the one where I have successfully invented the "Trans-Time-Script" gets tangled up it could create an infinite loop where time repeats the exact same over and over again while the person in the loop keeps living the same moments. the body doesn't deteriorate or anything but the mind remembers everything. Almost like groundhog day, you know that old movie from 1993 with Bill Murray and Andie MacDowell? Perhaps not. Anyway, this would result in that the other me of sorts would try to contact out of this loop to try to get it resolved not knowing how to. Now some of you might know the issue here. If that Me doesn't know how to, why would I think that this me could? Point proven.

Hypothesis 2:

Now the second hypothesis is actually pretty simple. I've managed to contact myself but from the future where I've perhaps been able to invent human travel through time. If this is the case I've made a grave mistake and probably gotten myself in a messed up time paradox. If that happens, Tough luck me.

Now that second option would be, well, tragic... for me. Now the second hypothesis is more likely in my Unprofessional opinion? But I guess It's exactly the same probability to be. The only thing that's certain is that I wish to be in the timeline where it works out and not the timeline where...Well you know.

So Paul this is for you... Don't mess with time. You don't know the precautions on what you're about to do. You're messing with forces that you know nothing about. Even to this day you still don't know shit. When you start messing with time, you start messing with existence , the only reason why I still do this is because of Miranda. Well, the only reason why we're still doing this is because of Miranda. You'll understand one day, when you're older.

Now to you readers. If you ever find yourself in a situation where you have the option to travel in time or mess with things you get a bad feeling about. Listen to that bad fucking feeling alright? Those feelings dude, are the things that keep you alive dumb-ass, that's the feelings that is carved into your DNA to keep you out of danger.

Also before I forget Paul, Don't listen to the man with the umb...

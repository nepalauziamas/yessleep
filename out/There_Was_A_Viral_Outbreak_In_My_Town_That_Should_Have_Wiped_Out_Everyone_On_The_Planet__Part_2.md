The fever rocked my body. I’d never felt so hot, like I was on fire inside and out. Jules got me into the shower and blasted the cold water. I laid in the tub, hyperventilating. As tears overwhelmed Jules, she put her face in her hands. This was all too much. For both of us.

Then the sobbing and tears changed, almost imperceptibly. But it continued to shift. Like a staticky TV channel coming into reception. It wasn’t crying anymore. It was laughter. 

Slowly, Jules started pulling her hands away from her face. It wasn’t her face anymore. It was like a child… but old and twisted. Broken and rearranged like a real-life Dr. Seuss character. Her lips pulled back into a giant smile, and her teeth began to elongate. No… they were falling out. Being pushed out by larger, sharper teeth. Her lower jaw unhinged and extended down, revealing rows of other, sharper teeth and a deep, black chasm of a throat.

The frightening child stood up, looking down at me in the tub. I wanted to get up and out, but I had dream legs, and nothing was working. I managed to grab the shower curtain just as the child jumped down on me, and blocked her. 

I felt my legs get their strength back, and I flipped the body off me. I shot up and out of the bathroom. Footsteps followed me out into the hall and I ran into the bedroom. I slammed the door shut, but when I turned back… I wasn’t in Jules and my bedroom. 

I was in my childhood basement. 

The lone, finicky light bulb overhead twitched on and off. Just like it always used to. My eyes stayed away from the back corner of the basement, but I could *just see* something poking out of the shadows. 

The two, silver protective bars that made up the cage at the front of a football helmet. My heart turned into a machine gun. The rest of me was paralyzed. 

The helmet. My dad’s old high school football helmet. A fear that had long been forgotten, suddenly overwhelmed me with a horrifying nostalgia. 

The helmet shifted. Something moved it. Something inside it. 

Then… buzzing. So faint at first. But it grew louder. The helmet vibrated with the sound. I heard wings begin to hum. I knew what was in there, and took off for the stairs up. I got halfway up before they began to elongate, stretching upward into infinity. 

The stairs below me shifted into a ramp, and my legs went out. I managed to catch myself and pressed my legs and arms against the opposing walls, preventing myself from sliding down. 

Below, the helmet rolled past the staircase, buzzing emanating from it. The buzzing stopped. 

In the shadows, I heard what sounded like hands on the cement floor. Slapping skin, hitting the ground as they move something forward. 

The child with the lower jaw came into view now, crouched down on all fours like a wild animal about to attack. The lower jaw hung only inches from the ground. The upper part of her face was alternating between the demented child… and Jules’. 

The words, “My baby’s hungry,” croaked out from the open cavern of her mouth. Then she darted up the flat stairs towards me, still on all fours. Within seconds, she was overtop of me, her jaw about to clamp down around my head. 

Then everything disappeared, and I was back in our apartment. I was on the floor of the bathroom, and Jules was performing CPR on me. I felt like my lungs had been used to run back to back marathons and my heart had been in a paint shaker. I was jittery and panicked, my eyes darting around the room, looking for predators. 

But none came. The first wave was over, and I barely made it through. It felt exactly like Rick had said. And with that, the frightening realization that Jules was likely going to have it now too. And with the baby in her belly. 

It couldn’t have been more than a minute later when Jules keeled over, gently rubbing her temples. The migraine had started. I watched as the chills swept across her body. Then the fever. Then, for a moment, she seemed lucid and fine. She said she felt better.

But then… she started to talk to someone in the corner of the room. It wasn’t a language though. It sounded like she’d forgotten how to speak. Something similar had been happening over the last few weeks though. She’d called it pregnancy brain, and said her mind would get foggy sometimes when she was trying to think of a word. 

This was different. This was gibberish. And frightened gibberish, at that. Jules stood up in bed and screamed into the corner in fear. I tried to calm her down but she jumped off the bed and ran into the hallway. 

I chased after her and found her in the kitchen. She was rifling through the utensils drawer and found a pair of scissors. She had the pointed end at her belly, and was yelling at someone behind me. I froze, afraid to move and cause her to panic. 

She didn’t seem to see me, so I moved in slowly, planning to somehow get the scissors from her hand. I was almost at her, when her attention turned from over my shoulder, to right in my eyes. She pulled the scissors away, raising them above her head, and slashing at me with them. I managed to catch her wrist, and twist it until she dropped the shears. 

I grabbed her other wrist and pulled her down, carefully, being mindful of the baby. I held Jules tight as she squirmed against me, trying to get away. Slowly, her fighting eased. I felt her body going limp. Her breathing slowed. Then she shuddered and came to. 

She was back. Awake. 

Jules was trembling. Whatever she’d seen, had shaken her to the core. I carried her to the couch and we got as comfortable as we could. 

A scream from one of the apartments above us broke the momentary serenity. Then another scream, somewhere on the floors below. There was banging on the walls, the floors and the ceiling. We could hear fighting. More screams. Cries for help. 

They all slowly faded away… and silence returned. 

Time had passed quickly. I didn’t realize it, but the first wave had been far longer than the hallucination I remembered. I tried to prepare myself for the next wave. Wondering what the hell it was going to come after me with. After all, it’d found my childhood fear of my parent’s basement. The football helmet. And the moth inside it. I was only 8 when it happened, but it felt like a defining moment. 

I’d been playing in my parents basement, when I stumbled upon my father’s old high school football helmet. I slid it over my head and strapped it on. What I didn’t know, was there was a baby moth inside it. 

The tiny creature panicked and ended up flying into my ear. It crept further in as I thrashed about, trying to pull off the helmet but the strap clip jammed. It was stuck on my head. I pulled and pulled, but it wasn’t budging. And the whole time, all I could hear, was the humming and attempted buzzing of the moth as it kept going deeper. 

My mom found me screaming and took me to the hospital. The little insect had burrowed in so deep, I had to get it surgically removed. The buzzing and humming haunted me for months. I had nightmares about the moth laying eggs in my brain. My parents kept telling me it was a baby, and couldn’t carry any eggs yet. But I didn’t believe them. 

Thinking back on it - remembering the details - made me more afraid of the virus and what it would find in my psyche. My memory raced through the minefield that was my past. Not just being a cop, which I’d done for half a decade and had seen horrible things that became new fears. But all kinds of things from my teenage years. Childhood.  

Jules nuzzled her head under my chin. For a second, I forgot about the world and enjoyed the moment. But like everything else, it couldn’t last. 

I felt that lightning bolt of pain streak through the centre of my head. I curled forward, rubbing my temples. Knowing it was about to all start again. The chills creeped in as the migraine eventually dissipated. The chills were colder this time. Somehow, I could see my own breath, like the air in my lungs was frosted. 

But that quickly melted away as the fever was tagged in. It felt like I was sitting in a bonfire in the middle of the Sahara desert wearing ten fur coats while pouring gasoline on myself. It lasted what felt like an hour. 

Then it too was gone. And Jules helped me get from the cold shower back to the couch. Not a moment after I hit the couch, a lone scream pierced out from one of the floors above. It was from a child. I asked Jules if she heard it, but she’d disappeared. Only the distant echo of her voice remained.  

I wasn’t in our apartment anymore. I was back in the junior high school. I was sitting in a classroom chair, one of those small ones with a tiny desk attached. I was surrounded by bodies. Students, stacked high and formed into a tightly packed maze. It was a horrific sight. I realized I was the same age as these kids. Twelve, maybe thirteen. 

A tune whistled out from somewhere in the maze. *Pop Goes The Weasel*. I couldn’t tell where it was coming from. Then another whistle joined in, but this one was from a different direction. They harmonized together. A low hum joined in… buzzing…

The only thing I could think of doing, was the only thing I’d ever been taught about mazes. Which was the “wall follower” rule. It was simple enough. If you put your right hand on the wall and walk, it will eventually lead you to the exit. I had to learn this the hard way when I was a kid. 

I’d gotten lost in a corn maze at a Halloween fair in the country. It wasn’t supposed to be for kids, but I’d wandered in and wasn’t found for over an hour. I was terrified when they pulled me out. I thought there were things amongst the corn stalks. Creatures coming for me. 

The virus had found that memory, that fear, and seized on it. 

I wouldn’t put my hand on the wall of bodies, but held it out close to it and started off through the maze. The whistling was further off now, but the two were sounding closer together, like they’d found each other. 

I kept going. 

The maze pathway led me out of the class and into a gymnasium. Smoke hung in the air, reeking of cordite from the gunfire. There were bodies hanging from the rafters above. It was dark, but I could tell… they were the teachers. 

Crying was coming from somewhere in the middle of the maze, my legs leading me towards it. Everything felt like it had that surreal, constantly forward moving momentum that dreams always carry. Like whether you’re walking or standing still, you’re basically on a conveyor belt to wherever your subconscious is taking you next. 

My right hand was still stretched out to the wall of bodies, and tiny hands were brushing against it as I passed. The pathway grew narrower and taller as I got closer to the crying.  

I heard rustling above and looked up. The teachers were now lowering down from the rafters and into the maze with me. They were joining in with the whistling from the boys, causing a loud echo through the gym. 

I tried to pick up my pace, but had no control over it. The whistling was overwhelming, and mixed in with it, I could hear the children’s ringtones joining. Humming and buzzing came from the sides of the walls and there was movement amongst the stacked up bodies.

I turned a corner and found myself in a dead end. But I wasn’t alone. There was a little girl there. I recognized her immediately. 

It was Jules. I’d seen pictures of her as a child, not that I needed to to identify her. She had that same face, just fifteen years younger. She asked if I was here to save her. I said I was, but didn’t know how to. She took my hand, and told me just being there was enough. 

The whistling and ringtones got closer. Jules led me back down the path we just came, but there was now a fork in the lane, leading off to the left. The sounds were coming from the path to the right, so we went left. 

The maze led us out of the gymnasium… and into a large room with an indoor pool. It was the Crestview Community Centre. I remembered it from my childhood. I’d taken swimming lessons here and nearly drowned. 

Before I could ask her why she took me here, Young Jules grasped my hand tighter and pulled me over the edge. We were both fully submerged, her pulling me down to the bottom. But I managed to break free from her grip and swam to the surface.  

Then I saw them… pouring in through the entrance. All the dead students and teachers surged into the pool. Coming for me. I tried to swim away, but the water was thick and my body felt like dead weight. I wasn’t moving. Hands grasped every part of me as the bodies swarmed me, pulling me down into the now blood-filled pool. The last thing I saw before going under, were the two shooters standing at the edge of the pool, laughing. Their hands were out in front of them, in the same “handcuff me, officer” gesture.

Dozens, hundreds of hands pulling me to the bottom of the pool, which I couldn’t even see anymore. It felt like we were in the ocean. It was impossible to fight against. But I kept kicking and punching and thrashing against them. I kept thinking of Jules, back home on the couch, waiting for me to wake back up. 

Their grips became weaker as I continued to fight back. I felt myself getting closer to the surface, pushing through bodies and pulling away from their hands. 

Just as my breath was about to run out, I burst through the surface.

And shot up beside Jules on the couch, gasping for air. She was still under, trembling and with fresh vomit dripping from her mouth and chin down her chest. I wiped the vomit away and tried to clear her throat, but there were no obstructions. Her airways were open, breathing fast but unimpeded. 

I didn’t know what to do. All I could think was to pull her close, hand in hand, and rub both over her belly.

The trembling got worse. Heavier. Jules felt like she was starting to seizure. Her head shook back in violent jerks and then…

She froze. Head back. Mid scream. Her chest wasn’t moving up or down from breaths. 

Jules gasped forward, nearly falling into the coffee table but I caught her. 

Jules was awake. She was alive. We both were. Before she managed to catch her breath, she was sobbing. A terribly sad weep. I couldn’t imagine what she’d just seen. Been shown. She’s a triage nurse, after all, and had been one for longer than I’d been a cop. I only heard some of the more filtered stories, and they were absolute horror shows. 

But I didn’t want to think about those. I wanted to clear my mind of anything the virus could use. 

We got up, rehydrated, and did a small clean up. Which felt unnecessary now and more a point of attempted orderliness than anything.

There were another three hours until dawn. We figured that meant the next wave was gonna hit soon. Which also meant… we’d be coming out of it to the sun rising. 

We really didn’t have much time. We decided we didn’t want to be found on the couch… if we didn’t make it. Jules put on her wedding dress, ripping the sides so it could fit over her pregnant belly. I put on the tux I wore. I moved the TV into the bedroom, and we put on a movie we both grew up watching. 

The Princess Bride. 

We laughed at the same jokes at the same times. We always did. It was *our* movie. 

I thought about last week. How difficult things had been. How afraid I was. It all felt so small now. I was making deals with any God that was listening, to let us get through this, and I’d be grateful for every breath I took afterwards. 

And with that, the wedding scene started. Only the characters weren’t in a Church. 

They were in the junior high school hallway. The audience members were the children and teachers, racked with bullet holes. The Princess and Westley were now the two shooters.  

A ground-shaking migraine, a frozen chill, and a scorching fever tore through my body at the same time, exploding in waves through my muscles. It was unbearable, like the virus had saved everything up to unleash on me at once. 

The TV screen began to expand, covering the entire wall and pushing towards us on the bed. Jules was beginning to seizure, blood streaming from her nose. I tried to grab her, but she sunk into the bed and disappeared. The TV screen absorbed the entire room, which was now the school hallway.

I was alone now. Rain drops started falling. A massive storm cloud replaced the ceiling, now much higher than twenty feet above. Bolts of electricity fired through it, lighting up shadows of creatures inside resembling large, frightening insects. Moths. 

Buzzing overtook the thunder as the rain came down in sheets. I started to run. Slipping and sliding along the blood and rain slicked tiling. The hallway was extending, and it was adding more doorways as it was. I saw horrific memories of all my old traumas coming back.

There were monsters from comics I’d read and movies I’d seen as a kid. The old, petrified tree in my neighbours yard that I used to think would swoop down and grab me if I ever walked by it alone. Swarms of large insects and carnivorous moths. The virus had found them all. I felt like I was in a car, whipping past memories and fears.

As I sprinted past the doors, they began spilling out behind me like some sick, twisted clown car full of nightmares. My terrors chased me, gaining in numbers with every door. I realized my whole life was one big fear. I felt everything behind me getting closer and larger as I was shrinking down to nothing. 

The hallway stopped expanding, and suddenly the far-end rushed back towards me. On the wall speeding ahead, was a lone door I recognized. It was the office of our OB/GYN’s. 

I didn’t care. I rushed in and slammed the door.

Red moonlight poured in from the windows. I could see Jules in the chair to the right, the one she always sat in. She wasn’t pregnant, and had her face in her hands, bawling. But she wasn’t alone. 

I was beside her, in the chair to the right. But it wasn’t me. It was like a real-life mannequin version of me. Plasticky, shiny, almost waxy. I was grinning from ear to ear. An uncomfortable truth pulsed through me. One I kept locked away, deep down, even from myself. But it was out now. And my biggest fear revealed itself. 

I hadn’t wanted Jules to give birth. 

There was a time when I did. A time I’d looked forward to it. Fantasized about being *‘dad.*’ But now… I was different. I didn’t think I could protect Jules, or anyone else. 

I’d been growing pessimistic since before the shooting happened… but after it, all I could see was our kid in that school. Blown apart for no reason by some maniac they didn’t even know. The attack had all been so pointless. I guess that’s why the shooters did it. To hurt everyone by hurting the most vulnerable. To hurt our futures. And they’d made me question mine. 

It was worse than fear though. It had guilt twisted in through it. Because it was what Jules and I had wanted. And now, I felt like I couldn’t be anything other than a massive disappointment. A colossal failure. 

The wax figure’s grin grew larger and the smiling shooter’s face flooded my mind. I could tell he enjoyed the feeling I had, and realized it was making him stronger. Every acceptance of it would make him larger and me smaller. 

Jules screamed out and fell off the chair, clutching her belly. I ran to her side, trying to help. Her stomach was flat, but there was movement under the skin. Then it ballooned outwards, like a rapid growth pregnancy. Jules was crying in pain as she went to full term size in seconds. The outline of something rigid and boney was shifting under her skin as it expanded outwards. Jules stopped screaming and went limp. She was gone. 

But the movement inside her kept shifting. Then… it was humming. A buzzing from inside. A sharp proboscis pierced the skin, and tore down the side of Jules’ belly. A second proboscis poked up, revealing the frightening face of a moth, though its mouth was filled with the sharp, jagged teeth of other, larger creatures. 

The plastic version of me started laughing. Bellowing out from behind me. It was the happiest he’d ever been. 

Anger burned through me. I grabbed the chair Jules had been sitting in and slammed it down on the moth. Jules’ stomach caved inward as I rained down blows, turning the moth into a disgusting, pulpy mess.

As I destroyed the creature, I realized the anger driving me and flowing through my arms was because… I did want the baby. I was scared I wouldn’t stack up to the challenge, but I wanted to be her dad. I was reminded of all the positive daydreams I had of having a baby, a child, with Jules. What we’d do together and how we’d learn and grow. 

The moth stopped moving. Everything went quiet. I looked down at Jules… and felt air leave the room. My heart stopped and rose into my throat. 

We were back in our apartment. The sun had risen high in the sky now and filled the living room with light. I was standing over Jules, holding one of the stools from the kitchen. 

Jules’ stomach was a horrifying sight. It was an open cavity now, the remnants of the pregnancy, now destroyed from a vicious beating. From me. The bloody aftermath dripped from the stool in sickening plops. I dropped the stool, in a daze now, unbelieving of what I’d done. I couldn’t cry or think. I could barely breathe. 

I couldn’t come to terms with what I’d committed and my mind fractured into millions of acidic thorns. I felt like literal poison. Toxic. A breeze passed through the apartment and I noticed the window open. It seemed to beckon me. I couldn’t imagine carrying on after this, so I walked towards the window, and climbed up on the ledge. 

The town was calm. It didn’t look like anyone else was awake yet. Or… maybe I was it. Rick had said it was an 80% death rate. Maybe it was even more than that. Maybe I’d been the only survivor.

I didn’t care. My world was different now, and I didn’t want to live in it. I shifted on the ledge, leaning forward and felt gravity taking over. Just as my hand left the window frame… a cold, clammy grip latched onto my wrist, pulling me back into the apartment.  

I landed on the ground hard and felt air fill my lungs like I hadn’t breathed in hours. The light in the apartment changed. The soft glow of the morning sun was just passing between the buildings in the distance, filling the room with warmth. It was dawn. 

And Jules was standing over me. She was alive, though looked like she’d had a hell of a night. Her belly looked perfectly healthy and untouched. She bent down and hugged me. 

I realized I was awake now. Really awake. There were no more fears or hallucinations. No more facing the past. We’d both made it. We cried together for what felt like an hour. 

Two days later, the bolts were removed from our doors and the hazmats arrived again. All surviving tenants of the building were now immune and cleared to leave. Jules and I were the only ones. 

Jules was bombarded with pressure waves and we were rushed to the hospital. We were examined and she gave birth in quarantine to our beautiful, healthy daughter. In the weeks that followed, there was a change between us. The ground below our feet felt more stable. Everyday issues felt so small and easy to overcome. Jules and I had gone to war together, and come back closer than before. I felt my courage and strength grow every day. And I know Jules did too. Whatever she experienced, she overcame it, same as I did. 

We still don’t know what happened that weekend. We signed NDA’s and received a small sum of hush money. The mainstream media were feeding talking points about a natural gas leak in the subway that caused hallucinations and deaths. But we know that’s not true. We know something leaked out and destroyed most of our small town, and the government somehow contained and hid it.

Hopefully, nothing like it ever leaks out again.

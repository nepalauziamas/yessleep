I run a private campground and I’m starting to feel like the world is out to get me.  Obviously the inhuman things on this campground are, but I’m starting to feel like fate has looked at me in particular and said ah yes, let’s go after this one.  It wasn’t my fault that [the fomorian stomped on the children’s wagon](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/kc5xd2/how_to_survive_camping_im_glad_im_not_the_only/).  I mean, sure, I *was* taking it away from them but that was because they were losing wagon privileges.  I didn’t intend to destroy it right in front of them out of spite.

Okay, I did plan to destroy it, but not right then and there.

But I guess the tendency to blame me for things that aren’t fully my fault extends beyond the town locals.

Or the children, petulant in their anger and unable to do any harm to the real culprit, are lashing out at the next best thing.

Me.

Anyway, if you’re new here, you should really [start at the beginning](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/clp5h4/how_to_survive_camping/) and if you’re totally lost, [this might help](https://www.reddit.com/r/goatvalleycampgrounds/comments/fz6a1d/how_to_survive_camping_index/).

I think all the stress is starting to get to me.  I’ve been forgetting things.  Knocking things over.  Just this week I spilled coffee on my laptop.  I’m sure it’s still a perfectly good laptop, other than smelling like burnt coffee, being unable to login, and it’s stuck on a perpetual shutdown/reboot cycle.

Yeah.  This is fine.  I don’t need to add a new laptop to the list of things I need to buy when the camp’s income picks back up again, right?  I’m sure it’ll start working soon.  This is all fine.

At least I’ve got the desktop to type this up on.

Early this week I was getting ready for bed when I realized there was something amiss.  I meandered from room to room, hoping to jog my memory as to what it was.  Did I forget to do something *else*?  Why did I feel so unsettled all of a sudden?  Then, at the doorway to my bedroom, I realized what it was.

The house was quiet.  I couldn’t hear the little girl weeping.

I went to the bedroom window and drew back the curtain.  The little girl was staring in at me.  Her face was pressed against the window pane, her nose squashed white against the glass.  I admit that I was expecting *something*, but this still startled me.  I swore at her a little while my heart pounded ferociously in my chest.  I don’t like being startled.

“Make them go away,” she whispered once I regained my composure.

“Make *who* go away?”

“I don’t like other children.  Make them leave.”

I went to the back door and turned the exterior flood lights on.  At the edge of the yard, out by the fence, I saw a row of glittering eyes set in round, intent faces.  The children slunk away into the dark as soon as I saw them, stepping backwards out of reach of the light.

“They’re gone,” I sighed.

I was tired and in no mood to deal with the insecurities of the entity that killed my mother *and* my aunt.  I left the light on, more to keep her from waking me up again than out of any real desire to help her.  However, my attempt to purchase some peace was in vain, for I’d barely laid back down when the little girl was at the window again, demanding that I make the children go away.

I rolled over, putting my back towards the window, and replied that they weren’t doing anything other than standing there and she’d just have to deal with it.  I didn’t have a way to banish them, after all, and I certainly wasn’t going to risk my neck on her behalf.

This was clearly the wrong answer.  The little girl began to wail.  She screamed at me through the window, demanding I *do* something about the children.  She beat her fists on the glass, first a steady, even blow with both hands and then it dissolved into a frantic pounding, one fist after the other.  I sat bolt upright at that, staring in horror at the glass and waiting to see if it would break.  My body was poised to flee.  But the glass held and gave no sign of even cracking.  I watched it for a good ten minutes to assure myself of this, and all the while the little girl continued to sob and scream, throwing herself against the side of the house and slamming her palms against the window.

This continued all night.  I covered my head with my pillow, I put in earplugs, and hoped in vain that she’d stop her tantrum at some point.  I’ve never been so relieved for the arrival of the beast at dawn.

Callous?  Of course.  But these things aren’t human and it is a mistake to ascribe human qualities to them.  Around here, mistakes are often fatal.

Still, I admit I was disturbed when I pulled back the curtains after the morning sun had banished the beast with its prey.  There was blood on the window.  Splattered droplets, long streaks dragging across the glass.  And handprints.  Bloody handprints.

I wiped it off before leaving to make my morning round around the campsite.  It’d snowed overnight and while it wasn’t deep, it was a fluffy, wet snow and I wanted to make sure no branches had come down on anything important.

I hadn’t even reached the end of the road leading to my house before I saw something that made me stop.  It seemed that the little girl had her reasons for insisting I drive off the children, though I’m still not sure what I could have actually done to chase them away.

The children had spent the night causing mischief.

They’d dug up the family graveyard.  The *entire* graveyard.  It’s not a big one, but there’s still generations of my family buried there, and they pulled every casket up out of the ground and dumped the remains out.  Bones were jumbled together.  Whatever fluids were left over from decomposition were thankfully hidden by a layer of fresh snow, but the stench lingered.  I didn’t even try to clean it up.  I just called up the funeral home and told the owner I had a problem and he brought some staff over to take care of it.  Only charged a token amount.  I think he felt sorry for me, having the bodies of all my relatives - including my own parents - strewn across the ground like that.

And I went back to my house and cried for a bit and then when I was done feeling sorry for myself, I got mad.

This was *personal* now.

I said earlier that we shouldn’t ascribe human qualities to these inhuman things.  Do not pity the little girl because she has the appearance and behavior of a child.  These are superficial traits.  Better to think of them as camouflage, than to believe this is what she actually is.

The children, however… I wonder if they occupy a middle ground, similar to the former sheriff.  If my theory is correct, then they were once children.  Very young children, perhaps, as they would have died before being baptized.  Their souls were swept up by the inhuman undercurrent and transformed into something else, the mischievous and cruel parts of childhood stretched over the frame of their unformed personalities.  We should not mistake them for children in the ordinary sense, but at their core, they were once human children.

I went into the forest.  I felt malevolent eyes on me as soon as I entered the scant shade afforded by the barren branches.  The children were watching and the weight of their anger dogged my heels as I turned the four-wheeler around and got off.  My heart was racing with adrenaline.  The children escalated.  I’ve seen that before.  They start out with humiliating and painful pranks before they start killing people.  This is what Beau told me, back when I first started writing these posts.  It feels like another lifetime, like another Kate was writing them.

“You need to come out,” I said sternly to the empty air.  “What you did to the graveyard was very very bad.”

Sullenly, the children crept out of the woods.  They arrayed themselves in front of me, dressed in shorts and t-shirts, sandals or sneakers on their feet.  One was even barefoot.  They glared at the ground between us, refusing to meet my eyes.  I may not be familiar with children but I could at least recognize the look they furtively gave me when they thought I wouldn’t catch them at it.  Resentful children, angry at being scolded.

“You can’t go digging up the graveyard, you understand?” I said firmly, channeling my best mom voice.

It’s… probably not that good of a mom voice.  Honestly it’s the voice I use on Bryan’s dogs when they’ve dug up the horse graves at the edge of the field.

“You don’t let us have any fun around here,” one said resentfully.

Okay, yes, that is absolutely true.  I wasn’t about to admit to that, though.

“If I let you have fun sometimes, will you promise to not kill or maim anyone?”

Silence for a moment.  A couple of them kicked at the snow and one picked her nose.

“That’s no fun though,” the nose-picker finally said.

“Well sometimes we have to play nicely with others in order to play at all.”

I went for my trump card.

“I’ll give you a new wagon if you promise to behave,” I told them.  “No killing or maiming people.”

More sullen silence.  I pressed them, feeling like I was close to an agreement.  It’s something I learned in my negotiations class, when I screwed over a few classmates during mock negotiations and made everyone dread being assigned as my partner.  If you’ve got someone that you know to be a push-over, you can goad them into an agreement.

“You’re not our mother,” one finally muttered.

Of course, that strategy relies on the other person *actually* being a push-over.  I didn’t like that class very much, if I’m being completely honest.  We moved quickly on to “integrative negotiations” which is more about cooperative negotiating and it turns out I’m kind of bad at that.

“I’m the campground manager,” I said with a confidence I didn’t actually feel, struggling to maintain my position of superior authority.

They considered this and then their expressions turned ugly.  A nasty, pinched look, and five heads swiveled to focus unerringly on me.

“So if we get rid of you,” another said, “we can do what we want?”

“No, that’s not how this works,” I said, but the idea was in their head and nothing I said mattered.

They took a few deliberate steps towards me.  Not the nervous, faltering footsteps of someone uncertain as to whether they want to commit, but the slow and subtle advance of a cat readying itself to pounce on its prey.  I didn’t back up and I didn’t run.  Not yet.  I didn’t want to put my back to them, not when there was another option.

It was time to move to plan B.

The world is not entirely cruel.  There are ways to save these transformed souls.  Holy water had infuriated them, but that is a weapon.  I would try something else.

Rusalki can sometimes be turned back to humans by dropping a cross around the afflicted person’s neck.  I hoped that the same practice applied here.  In my back pocket I had a number of necklaces I’d bought for just this reason.

I pulled one out and let the chain dangle, concealing the cross in my hand.  I stepped towards the advancing children, talking nonsense to keep them distracted from what I held.  Something about how this wasn’t going to solve the problem, there’d just be a new camp manager, I dunno.  Then, as soon as one was within range, I reached out and dropped the chain over their head, letting the cross fall to land on their chest.

As easy as that.

The children halted.  The one I’d collared glanced down to stare at the necklace resting against his shirt.  Then he glanced back up at me and his eyes narrowed.

“Uh,” I said tentatively, taking a step backwards now, “do you… feel *better*?”

“You’re trying to get rid of us!” he spat.

“Trying to help you, actually, but yes, that too.”

Look, no reason to keep lying now that the game was up.

I turned and ran.  Behind me came the enraged shrieks of the children, inhuman cries that sounded like the screams of a dying animal.  I didn’t get far before a hand closed around my ankle and jerked backwards.  I went down hard, landing on my chest and narrowly getting an arm in front of me to keep from smashing my face on the dirt.  The snow soaked into the front of my jeans and I rolled to the side, just as one of the children seized my ankles and began to drag me along the ground.

The remaining children surrounded my prone body.  They were different.  More feral.  Leaner and their limbs seemed longer, their faces more pinched, and every single one of their teeth were sharp.  They leered at me with shark grins, and reached for me, dirty and broken fingernails glinting like knives.

I kicked wildly, trying to land a good blow in on the one that held my ankle.  My attempts missed as the child whooped and ran, dragging me along behind them, and their companions ran along beside me, scooping to pick up handfuls of snow and packing it into tight balls of ice which they hurled at my face.

“Campground manager!” they shrieked over and over again as a taunt.

Then we were at the top of the hill, the one they’d come racing down on their wagon that one last time.  The child holding my ankle heaved and I went over the brink, sliding on the snow, and even though I splayed my limbs and tried to slow my descent, the snow was too accommodating.  Too slick.  I slid down backwards the entire way, finally coming to a halt with my back soaked and the world spinning around me.

And the children… the children weren’t done yet.  They raced down the hill on all fours, laughing maniacally as they came.  I scrambled for my feet.  I knew how their pranks ended and it seemed they were ready to start out by killing me.

I drew my knife and as the first of the children came racing towards me, I drove the point towards the side of its chest.

It jumped into the air like a cat that’d been startled before the point could even touch its clothing.  It twisted, stretching long arms to touch the ground, and then it sprang away from me and my weapon before it even landed again.  I braced myself for further attacks, instinctively falling into a stance I’d learned by mimicking Beau.  My breath came in thick white clouds in the cold air and I warily surveilled the children.

They glanced at each other, at my knife, and like that, they melted away.  The threat of direct violence was enough to drive them back and then they were slipping into the trees, scuttering backwards to disappear, with their evil stares fixed on me the entire time.  I couldn’t keep track of where they went.  It was like they stepped sideways behind a tree trunk and were gone.  I cautiously returned to the four-wheeler and sheathed my knife as I got on.  I drove straight back to the house.

This wasn’t over.

That night, I leaned against the wall beside the window and apologized to the little girl.  It wouldn’t make a difference to her but I think… I needed to apologize to myself.  For being unable to stop the children from digging up the family graveyard.  From being unable to stop them from scattering the bones of my family across the ground like meaningless debris.  I told the little girl that I was sorry, that I didn’t know how to drive the children off and I didn’t know how to stop them.

When I was done speaking, the little girl began to cry once more, as she does every night.  And I, troubled and afflicted with guilt, found that I couldn’t sleep.  I spent the night in my office instead, searching for answers.

In the morning, Beau came around.  Knife practice has been exciting with the snow.  I’ve only busted my ass a few times by slipping.  This time, he seemed reluctant to engage.  There was something on his mind.  I waited.

“You have a problem,” he said, glancing out at the woods as he spoke.

“The children?”

He nodded slightly.  I sucked at my teeth, considering what to say next.  I’ve got a theory about his lack of useful information.  If it hurts him to interact with humanity, then the best way to get help from him is to limit how much he has to say.  If I do all the theorizing and he only has to confirm which of my guesses is correct, then perhaps it’ll be an easier arrangement for both of us.

Of course, I had to pose my questions carefully, because he also has a tendency to get annoyed when I’m being dumb (by his judgement) and refuse to acknowledge my existence.

I suppose that’s fair.  There’s no creature in folklore that will just answer everything you want it to with no conditions.  It’s just not a thing they do.

Beau, as if sensing my intention, spoke before I could.

“You’re more of an expert than I am,” he warned me.  “I understand my world in a way you cannot, but it is an instinctual knowledge, and you may not have the words for me to express it with.”

He could not confirm what the children were, not in terms I would recognize.  I hastily scrapped my mental list of questions and instead focused on only one, a question that would play to Beau’s strengths as the campground gossip.  After all, he does seem to know quite a bit about the relationships between creatures on this land.

I asked him if Perchta was coming.

He said she was and that was all I needed to know.

I’m a campground manager.  I deal with creatures that are often of deceitful or dual natures, that speak things that have many meanings.  Perchta is among them, as she rewards some and punishes others, two sides of the same coin.  I wonder if what she told me last year - that I could save all of them - wasn’t as simple as it sounded.  If it wasn’t just a condemnation of how I ran my campground, a refutation of my rules and my false sense of justice, but also an invitation.

Because Perchta is said to lead a wild hunt of her own and among her followers are the souls of unbaptized children.

It’s time to give the children to a new mother. [\[x\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/goatvalleycampgrounds/)

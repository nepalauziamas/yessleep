For centuries we as humans have always wanted to take control of the environment that god had put us on. We always felt that it was our destiny to contain the vast intellect of all of the great lakes, mountains, and everywhere in between. Our dream was to collectively understand and witness the myths that we manifested firsthand so that we could bestow upon our great grand-children the great gifts that we thought were hiding in the unknown. However, in our blinding adventures to seek out the treasures of our world, we have only discovered that the world we live in is built upon the bottom of Pandora's box.

&#x200B;

At least that's what I discovered. I discovered something a long time ago that would forever begin my downward spiral into the awareness of Human triviality.

&#x200B;

You shall not know me by my name, as this story will introduce myself just fine, nor shall you know the real name of the Canadian Yukon town I live in. Let's just give my hometown the name: "Stolid" for the sake of this story. Now Stolid in the 80s was having a major issue concerning the general well-being of the populous. People were demanding that the mayor attempt to contact nearby law-enforcement bodies about the growing number of missing people, and since the town was pretty small even for middle-of-nowhere standards, people believed that if something wasn't done soon then the whole place would end up being a ghost town.

&#x200B;

Where do I fit into this? Well, not anywhere significant to say the least. I was just your average black-smith joe who sold tools to local arborists in Stolid, and other neighboring towns. As much as I didn't want to get into any kind of trouble with the hot-takes going on here, however, I couldn't help but feel slightly vulnerable to whatever forces might be lurking behind our backs in this god-forsaken place. So of course I would always bring a few teeny-little weapons with me wherever I traveled just to feel somewhat safe. I should've known though that a luger and a swiss army knife isn't necessarily a one-man army against the ever-looming idea of god becoming weak as man.

&#x200B;

I learned that the hard way though on the 4th of December in, you guessed it, 1988.

&#x200B;

That night was probably the single most tumultuous night in Stolid history. 3 more people were supposedly reported missing, and people had begun sparking up so much turmoil that they even lit a single car on fire, how ragingly passionate of them! Of course, I made the mistake of going into the center of town where most of the chaos was in the first place to buy a few parts for my job. I also just happened to be in a huge hurry to deliver a few things to a client of mine in a nearby town. Hey, at least I got to hear the stress-relieving sounds of several bullet shots at town hall in the process.

&#x200B;

However, I don't remember this night for whatever the hell was happening in Stolid. I'm pretty sure you and I both know where this is going. After leaving the center of that mess I headed back to my house where I prepared for my 30-mile trip in my decrepit little AMC Pacer to whoever I was selling my shit to that night.

&#x200B;

It was about 8 degrees above zero when I went outside to put everything in the back of my car. As I walked up to the driver-side door, I couldn't help but just take in the atmosphere of the night that surrounded me. The soft icy breeze stroking me like an owner does to a pet, the snow surrounding me with imaginative heat, and the moon peering through the cold clouds to shine her fluorescence onto me, a light that cemented my existence to relativity. It should've been yet another moment that brought true comfort to me, yet something still felt off, and I was about to drive headlong into the void that I felt during that moment.

&#x200B;

Now forgive me for alienating you from my mindset, but unless there isn't enough moonlight, I almost never turn on my headlights during the night. There are rarely any other cars that travel by here anyways, and I always thought to myself that I could see perfectly fine without using those stupid lights, they barely even worked on my car anyways.

&#x200B;

I spent what felt like 20 minutes driving on worn-out, icy asphalt roads. The engine hummed with eyebags in its soul, and the suspension creaked more than the floorboards of a haunted mansion down the endless amount of imperfections in the road, but it never bothered me. It had been doing that for god knows how long at that point. What bothered me though was that in front of me, lying on the road that I had been traveling down ever since I was 16, was a fallen tree. So doing what any sane person would, I decided to head back a few yards and travel down the forboding dirt trail that branched off the road.

&#x200B;

Despite being completely surrounded by wilderness, the moon was still illuminating the environment. I could still see clearly as I was heading down that dirt path. I recall my car slipping a few times on that path, but I never lost my control of it. I assumed that I would be on that trail for a while, and thus my consciousness was beginning to make me feel drowsy. I kept on driving down the trail, but I knew that soon I wasn't going to stay awake for much longer. As I was nearly about to lose myself, however, the entire car jolted to a halt.

&#x200B;

Somehow the weather was much different than I had first interpreted it. The moonlight was gone, and it had begun snowing, all of which I failed to notice somehow. Either that or I somehow fell asleep while driving. Soon I shook myself awake and reached for the keys to turn the car back on.

&#x200B;

That's...when I saw it though.

&#x200B;

Although my eyes had been long adjusted to the darkness at that point, it was still very dark outside, and the snow didn't really help either. Yet, despite that, I jolted back in my seat when I managed to notice the silhouette of something hanging in the trees to my right.

&#x200B;

An Arachnid, the size of my car, hung itself above me with a predatorial silence. I sat there unblinking for what felt like 15 seconds, all without the spider moving once. Eventually though, I slowly moved forward to turn on the headlights of my car. With my eyes still on the spider, I very gently wrapped my fingers around the headlight switch and tugged with a mighty clench to activate the high beams. I thought it would help me see it better, that it would be beneficial to my survival, but those weren't headlights that I turned on, they were the signal.

&#x200B;

The spider launched itself from the trees and instantly clamped on top of the car with its abdomen smashing the windshield. I can still remember the ear-piercing screams that emanated from my soul at that moment, a soul that was still pure with emotion and feelings. What an innocent little child I was. Within a moment I got the car into gear and swung it back down the trail, forcing that suck-a-doodle doo of an engine to scream like a banshee in agony even then though the spider stayed clenched to the top of my car.

&#x200B;

I could hear the spider pounding its needle-like arms at the glass, the abdomen was spitting out webs onto the windshield as if it wasn't hard enough to see out of it with the damage it had done. And that's another thing, with the headlights on I could now very clearly see that there were webs just about all over the trees around me. The snow was clinging onto the webs, making them even more visible if the shine from my lights didn't make them so enough.

&#x200B;

I was still racing headlong down the trail with the great panic-induced fear pushing me forwards to what I thought could be salvation. My consciousness had created a sphere of energy that attempted to hold in an aura of pre-conceived human feelings and wisdom and separate me from the pure unknown naturalism that shattered the man-made vessel which I had bestowed myself. With the single ounce of thought that I had left under the blindness of panic that I had built up, I slammed on the brakes, causing the spider to finally fall off of my barrier. Soon, however, the spider regained its bearing and came face to face with those piercing-red eyes against my cross-eyed lemon.

&#x200B;

It was at that moment that I realized that this was the ultimate determination of my fate. A fate that would embody itself as the sheer forces of unconquered nature. I could've just sat there and let the spider tear apart my barrier and eat me up like the yoke of an egg. I could've done what pretty much embodied the true laws that governed humanity's insignificant place in this world that was set into action by our apathetic gods.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**The luger......my wrathful gateway between man, and god.**

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I grabbed, holstered, and fired the un-godly invention with a precision that felt gifted. The bullet, within the span of incomprehensible milliseconds, thrashed its way, untampered, through my windshield, and executed the actions of tethering god-like entities straight in between the eyes of my first Luger Spider.

&#x200B;

Ever since that night I have forever freed myself from the hopeless fleeing cries of man, and I have resurrected myself as the tamer of our nightmares, I have since then studied, and classified the creatures our gods didn't want us to have knowledge of, for I have been rewarded a position on this planet that stands above human-comprehension, and I have placed my throne as their tyrannical lord. The luger spiders are little more than the mistakes of the hell that resides within the mantle. A hidden hell that, fun fact, the Soviets tried and failed to reach.

&#x200B;

The government doesn't want us to know what kind of monstrosities are happening in the town of Stolid in the present day. They don't want you to know that Luger Spiders (classified by scientists as Acanthogactus rexarus), has wiped out the population of Stolid ever since 1993, and it has become little more than a fortress for their un-thinking state of hive-mind. Finally, they don't want you to know that they have been fighting this species ever since 1993 with specially designed flame-throwers, and are beginning to run out of ideas on how to properly exterminate the entire species.

Pour les myopes, à travers le brouillard, **Dieu doit être un monstre.**

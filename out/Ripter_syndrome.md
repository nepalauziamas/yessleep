Like all stories, I suppose I should start at the beginning. My name's Perry Kiers, I'm 37 years old, work in education and usability (weird combo, I know), and I like hard rock and big band jazz. I enjoy playing darts, co-operative games, and playing rounders. Oh, and I'm married. Though... I suppose I might as well not be. 

Sorry, I suppose that's not really the beginning at all. Let me try again...

My wife, Alice, and I had been married for five years when the troubles started. Now, I don't believe in the supernatural per se, at least not rationally. Having studied psychology as part of my educational programme, I do however believe in the power of the psyche to create incredibly elaborate traps for itself to get lost in. I suppose the closest thing I can come to think of the paranormal is how an otherwise seemingly healthy brain starts to put itself through impossible puzzles and challenges, without having any real motivation for doing so.

I want to make it perfectly clear right now that my wife had no history of mental illness, no abuse, no need to "hide" or compensate for things in her life in her psyche. Hell, it took me almost a year before I ever even heard of Ripter syndrome. Have you? I'm not surprised if you haven't, it seems it's incredibly rare, and not considered an actual disease. The similarities between cases are too much like one another for it to be a coincidence, however. But once again, I suppose I'm not really starting from the beginning...

Alice worked with children with learning disabilities, aged ten to sixteen. She was very patient and, quite honestly, put me to shame in her ability to explain things in easy-to-understand ways. She was, in my belief, also gorgeous, funny, intelligent, curious and all in all a very good person. 

I think I remember the first instance of the Ripter syndrome rearing its ugly head. We'd been cuddling a bit on the couch on a Friday evening after dinner, watching some easy-to-digest movie or another. She got up, telling me she was going send a couple of work emails before bed, kissed me, and walked upstairs. To my surprise, it took less than five minutes for her to come down again and sidle up against me. She seemed a bit perturbed by something, but I shrugged it off.

"Done already, hon?"

"No, I think the computer's broken. There's something weird going on with the screen. A big line or tear or something straight across."

I groaned in my mind. A broken monitor, while not a huge expense, is still annoying as hell. Especially considering it wasn't that old. 

I didn't think any more of it until the next morning. I got up first, as I usually do, letting her sleep in. Figuring to get a head start, I went and turned on the stationary in our joint work room to see if I could see what's wrong, and how big an issue it was. Considering Alice got no work done, I figured it was big. 

But fiddle as I might, I couldn't find anything wrong with it. Chalking it up to a graphics glitch or similar, I made a mental note of cleaning the inside of the chassi, and went to make breakfast.

Apparently, the effects of Ripter syndrome are compounded over time, so it starts out slow, then accelerates exponentially. The next "incident", if you can even call it that, didn't happen until... I don't know, four months later? We were once again on the couch, cuddling and watching a movie. She's got her arm up behind my back, absently playing with the hair on the back of my head. She often does this, and I love it, but this time, after fiddling around a bit, she would repeat the same motion; a downward stroke with two fingers, then a swipe right-left, then left-right, as if covering up the downward stroke. Rinse and repeat. At first I didn't react to it, but after she'd been doing it for a good ten or fifteen minutes, I got curious.

"Hon, why're you combing the same spot over and over?"

"What do you mean?"

She looked at me in askance, apparently not understanding the question.

"Well, you've been sort of... combing over the same spot on the back of my head for about a quarter of an hour now. Do I have something in my hair?"

"Oh, no, no... I just... I think you have like... a straight patch where you're losing a bit of hair."

"A... straight patch?"

"Yeah, like a line."

Untangling myself from her, I felt around on the back of my head, but couldn't find any area where the hair was thinner.

"You sure?"

"Yeah", she said, touching me on the back of the head again. A pause, a bit of fiddling, then "Huh. I can't feel it anymore. I must have imagined it."

"... yeah, I suppose."

It struck me as weird, but hell, we're entitled to that, aren't we?

Next time was a couple of months later, after which things started accelerating. I came home early one day to see her at the dinner table, dejectedly looking down into what looked like a barely touched lunch. At first she didn't react when I called out to her, so I went up to her, gave her a hug and a kiss and asked what was wrong.

"Oh, hey Perry. Nothing, I just... I went down to the bookstore to return that book I bought last week, because it was damaged during printing or something, and the clerk told me I was just imagining things and that there was nothing wrong. I pointed it out to her, and she started telling me I was nuts and that this was my problem. I asked to talk to her manager about it, and she started calling me crazy and foul things, and to get out of the store. It was just so sudden, it completely killed my mood... the kids are out for a sports day today, so I went home early."

I spoke gently to her as I hugged her again, nuzzling her wonderful, curly chestnut hair.

"It's okay hon, try not to let it get to you. People like that are horrible, and they're just trying to drag you down with them. Tell you what, why don't we go to the movies tonight, eat out, and just forget about this, and I'll take it down to the store first thing Monday?"

She smiled then, that lovely, warm smile, and kissed me. I think that was the last time I saw that smile as it should be.

Come Monday, I went down to the store, intending to... well, to be honest, I went there intending to start trouble. You don't yell at my wife and get away with it. Not my gentle, loving Alice. Turns out, the clerk at the store and her manager had a different story to tell.

They told me Alice had come in complaining that there was a crease or tear in the book, that must have happened during printing, and demanded a new book. The clerk, per procedure, checked the book before intending to dispose of it, but was confused when she couldn't find anything wrong with it. Asking my wife about it, Alice had told the clerk that "it's right there, page 32 to 84!". 

So naturally, I opened the book myself, and... well, okay, I hadn't actually checked it before. But flipping through the pages, I couldn't find a single thing wrong with it. The clerk's manager continued the story, saying that when the clerk prompted Alice, my wife had gotten angry and raised her voice, causing the manager to come over. Alice had told them that they were swindlers, and that the book was obviously defective, and that they just wouldn't take responsibility. The argument had devolved from there, Alice insisting that the pages were somehow torn or marked, and them denying it. Eventually, the manager had lost it and told Alice she was crazy, and to leave the store. She seemed remorseful about it, and I wasn't too happy with it, but seeing as how there wasn't anything wrong with the book...

I asked them if they would replace it for me, just to settle my wife's mind and mine, and the manager agreed. I think she just wanted to put it behind her. So did I... as it turns out, that was a futile hope.

After this, I forget in which order things happened. All I can say is, things started getting worse. She threw away a store-bought salad when we were out walking, because someone had "obviously dug around in it, looking for something in the middle". I came home one day to half the lawn being mowed so deep there was almost no grass left. Alice said there was a furrow in the grass that looked horrible, so she cut until the grass was of equal length, so it wouldn't look weird. I got an ominous feeling after that, compounded by several other small, but significant events. Always with the tears, furrows, lines and rips.

About two years after the first event, things started getting really bad. I came home to the house smelling of smoke, and went upstairs to find Alice having ironed a shirt so hard she'd burned her way through it and into the ironing board beneath. She didn't seem to realise the damage she was doing, and insisted she was just "trying to iron out a stubborn crease". 

Later that same week, the police brought her home. The story they told me was that she'd been chucking books at the manager down at the bookstore, claiming they were all "faulty" and "torn". The manager, recognising my wife, had told the police she wouldn't press charges if I agreed to get her some help. What else could I do?

But she resisted efforts to get better, claiming she was fine, that it was somehow just a big conspiracy against her, trying to cover up the imperfections and mistakes all over the world, people ruining things (like our lawn), to try and get to her. About a week after the book incident, I came to her having wrecked her laptop, our stationary computer, and the smartpad, claiming they had pixelated grooves in them. 

Another week with lots of small events, all with the same fixation, and I come home to the police ringing on the door again, this time, without my wife. Turns out she'd tried ironing out a crease in the suit jacket belonging to a father of one of her students. While he was wearing it. With a baseball bat. 

Apparently he hadn't gotten badly hurt, just some bruises, but she'd been taken in to an emergency psych ward, raving about peoples' blindness to the tears and grooves everywhere. When I got there, they wouldn't let me see her, saying she was violent. I stayed outside all night, but come morning I forced myself to go home and get some rest. I don't think I slept for more than two or three hours, but when I woke up and called, they'd transferred her to a high-security psych ward for psychotic and violent behaviour. I drove there and they let me see her, for a short while.

At first, she was calm, expressing concern for the state of my clothes and hair, and saying I should get some sleep. She quickly got herself worked up talking about everyday things, however, and soon she was screaming at me, accusing me of abandoning her and refusing to see what she sees, that I was just a cog in the great conspiracy against her and those like her. In the end, they had to sedate her and drag her away. That was the last time I saw her.

She wouldn't let me see her anymore after that. But the last thing she said got me thinking... others like her. So I started doing research on the symptoms, and after about a week, I came across something called the Ripter syndrome.

Apparently, people suffering from Ripter are somehow trapped in a mind maze wherein they start seeing "flaws" in things. It's not really flaws, per se, as some people see everything as broken or imperfect. People suffering from the Ripter syndrome keep seeing jagged or straight tears, often beginning in books, texts or artwork with repeating patterns. As if, hidden in the information of letters, there's a rip in what should be, and what is. I can't exactly explain it, since I've never suffered from it myself, but that's supposedly what it is. Ripter gets progressively worse, until the people suffering from it start seeing these things everywhere. Always IN something though; it's not just overlaid over their entire environment. They fixate on small things; a    supposed crease, a tear, a furrow, a groove, a shallow indentation. Always in the form of a uneven-edged tear    or line. Supposedly, it often happens to people with no history or predeliction for mental health issues. And as I    said before, it apparently starts small, then gets progressively worse over time, until they become violent    and paranoid. Apparently, from what little I've been able to gather, there's been no cases of people getting better.    They've had to be hospitalised for the rest of their lives. I haven't seen my wife since then, more than two years    ago now. I never divorced her, and I haven't dated since. My life moves on, but I just can't forget that fixated mania,    the preoccupation with rips in information. It just seems to bizarre. The weirdest thing about Ripter syndrome is that    there's no mention of it existing prior to the digital age (which is why saying that the people suffering from it are    hospitalised for the rest of their lives may be a bit premature). It also seems that almost all of the cases have    never heard of others suffering from the disease, or read about it, but they still tend to refer to themselves as one    of many. That may just be the paranoid psychosis talking, but it just makes me wonder... what the hell causes a healthy mind to develop such a weird fixation? Could you really tell yourself, if it happened to you?

I guess this isn't really very paranormal, or supernatural in any way. I just wanted to share my story about how a loving, caring woman turned into a paranoid psychotic, for seemingly no reason. I mourn her, though she's still alive, and I wish I could help, both her and others like her. But the mind is a devious thing, inventing ideas and seeing patterns where there are none. I wonder what a rip in text (not a page, text) would even look like?

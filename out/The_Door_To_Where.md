"Henry Jacobson?" A voice called over the intercom. "That's me" I heard. to my left I watched as a middle aged man in a business suit stood and made his way down the aisle to the door at the front of the room just as so many had before him. The waiting room was large, about the size of an auditorium, with several rows of seats. I sat maybe a dozen rows away from the front. The room was lit by tube lights that lined the ceiling, the white walls and white linoleum floor gave the room the appearance of a large hospital waiting room. I did find it peculiar that there were no windows, and the only doors were the ones the man had just exited through, and one which more people entered through at the other end.


      My thoughts were cut off by the screaming. "No please!!! No I'm begging you don't do this!!! I can't!!!" The screaming was cut off by the slamming of a door somewhere beyond the walls. I've heard this before. Not all people that have gone through the door screamed, but most of them had. Come to think of it, I couldn't tell you how many before me had entered the room, I can't tell you how I got here, I can't tell you how I feel, in fact I didn't feel much of anything, not happiness, nor sadness, I was emotionally numb. The only things I could feel were that where I came from before this room was a bad place, and the dread of what I might find beyond the door when my name is called.


      I looked around and studied the faces of the countless people around me, all of them seemingly in the same state of confusion as I was. To my right sat a man who looked to be in his late 20s, about my age. Again, I couldn't tell you how long he'd been there. He sat quietly with his head slightly tilted, seemingly in deep thought.


      Again my thoughts were interupted by a voice over the intercom. "Chris Williams." I scanned the room until I saw a man pass me making his way down the aisle. He had a look of anticipation on his face. I waited with baited breath as he opened the door. Nothing could be seen through the open door as it was too dark. I waited for the screams, though this time there weren't any. The situation seemed more and more confusing by the minute, however long a minute was.


      The man beside me broke the silence. "Do you have any idea what is going on?" It startled me for a moment, I couldn't remember how long it had been since the last time I'd heard anyone speak directly to me. "I don't know." I said. "This whole thing feels like a never ending stupor." He looked at me with a defeated expression as if he was struggling to make sense of it, eventually he sighed and stared ahead again.


      I waited with the same disposition, until a few moments later when another name was called. Somewhere near the front a withered older woman reluctantly walked toward the door and entered. It didn't take long before the screaming started. "Noooo!!!! I can't do it!!! Please don't send me there!!!! No!!!!!" She shrieked and wailed, until the slamming of a door once again echoed throughout the waiting room.


     I waited silently for what could have been hours or days, time seemed to crawl as I anticipated my own name being called. Countless people were lured into the room, countless people were heard as whatever was on the other side of the mysterious door took them screaming to an unknown destination.


     "Richard Stanton" called the voice on the intercom. I surveyed the rows of people, to my surprise and dismay the man next to me stood, he looked at me with terror in his eyes, the dread obviously consuming him to his core. I could only look back at him with empathy, Seeing the terror in his eyes I couldn't articulate the necessary words to provide any solace. 


     He turned and walked slowly toward the door as slowly as he possibly could. I could visibly see his hands trembling. Finally he opened it. After the door closed behind him I contemplated what I would hear, if I would hear him scream, or what it would mean if I heard nothing. Then it started. It started as a slow building wail and eventually peaked into the terrified shriek and pleading I'd heard countless times. I heard the sound of feet rapidly scrambling back down the hall before the door opened, and a hand reached around desperately trying to hold on for dear life as something pulled him.


   "Pleeeeeaaaase, let me go!!!!!" He screamed. His hand clutched the knob on the outside for dear life as his arm was being crushed between the door. I couldn't bring myself to do anything, I was completely entrenched in fear. Finally with a sudden jerk, Richard was dragged away, the door shutting behind him. Just like before the screams were cutoff by the familiar slam of another door, echoing throughout the room.


     I could only put my face in my hands, repeating the same questions in my mind. "What is this place, how did I get here, where will I go, where did I come from?". These thoughts continued as more and more names were called, I tried my best to drown out the screams but to no avail. The only feeling aside from my confusion was fear, and it was building


    "Alex Miller" my eyes snapped open… it took me what seemed like forever to register what I'd just heard.

My mind felt like it was glitching in angst. It was my turn. My thoughts went haywire as I anticipated what was behind that door. The faces around me became a blur as I made my way down the aisle. With trepidation I reached for the knob and opened the door.


    I was met with a dark hallway, almost pitch black. The only visibility was provided from a room at the end of the long hallway. I slowly made my way down the hall. What came into view was a figure standing at the far end of the small room. The walls and floor were the same as the ones in the waiting room. 


   As I approached the room I was able to make out the details of the figure, it was a man in a black suit and tie. His expression was blank, it gave off an aura of indifference. He stared at me as I stopped a few feet away from him. I wanted to speak, I wanted to demand answers but I couldn't muster the courage.



  "Do you know where you are?" He asked, without a trace of emotion. I could only shake my head no.

"Do you know who you are?" I paused momentarily, "Alex Miller" I forced myself to say.

"Do you know why you're here?" I grew more nervous with every question, terrified of the answers I might find. I shook my head.

His emotionless eyes burrowed into mine, digging into my every thought, my every emotion. My entire life.


    Suddenly my mind was filled with memories, the place I came from, the person I was, and it was all wrong. It felt like it was the most wretched place anything could possibly exist in, a place that would make oblivion sound like paradise. I remembered everything from the moment I entered the nightmare, everything I did wrong to the time I left the terrifying place, to the moment I ended up here.


"Last question." He said as I stood petrified.

A smile widened across his face, a sickening grin of pure malice.

"Do you know where you're going?" 


     I was suddenly aware of a door to my right, and to my left was a doorway that was pitch black…. Oblivion. I started to tremble in terror.

"Please!!!!" I screamed. "I'm begging you don't do this to me!!!" Slowly the door to my right opened, as the man's smile grew wider than humanly possible.

"Don't send me back pleeeeeaaaase!!!!! Send me into oblivion!!!! I can't do this again please!!!!!" I pleaded and sobbed as I was gripped by something unseen, forcefully guiding me to my brand new nightmare called life. Then the door slammed behind me.

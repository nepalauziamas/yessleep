It might seem like a cold and cruel thing to admit…but I didn’t cry at my grandfather’s funeral. I mean, I hadn’t seen him in person or spoken to him since I was five years old, and six entire years had passed since then.

Now, I’m not trying to make excuses for myself, but isn’t it a bit much to expect a small child to cry over someone they have not seen in over half a decade?

To an adult, that might’ve been a negligible amount of time, but to a growing kid like me, even a month seemed like forever.

Needless to say, I didn’t attend the main service, as my parents were too embarrassed by me for not shedding a single tear for him.

While the adults emptied their eyes out on a small hill, I stayed in my grandparents’ house. I made it a point to explore every one of its corridors before everyone came back for the meal.

After a series of bathrooms, bedrooms, libraries, and more bathrooms, bedrooms and libraries, I found myself infected with a stubborn boredom that wouldn’t go away, despite the many interesting things that I did come across.

But alas, a young lad such as myself felt no entertainment from reading a first edition copy of “David Copperfield” or awe from gazing upon a vast rifle collection in a room full of stuffed animal heads.

Anyhow, I told you this so that you can have some context as to why I found myself sitting in a large old sofa chair in my grandparents’ living room, trying to remember just what the hell I had done with him.

I remembered some bits and pieces here and there of a vague old man smiling and handing me things as well as holding my hand while we walked, but nothing really stood out .

I kept searching deep into my subconscious, wanting to find a reason to cry…but in the end, I came up empty.

I was about to get up and leave to get an early serving of food, but it was at that moment that an old woman walked in out of nowhere.

She too was dressed in funeral attire but I just couldn’t remember seeing her anywhere in the crowd of people that clamored over my late grandfather’s casket.

The woman, with eyes as bleak and dark as coal, took one look at me, and her entire gaze seemed to brighten in a flash.

“David?” she asked, and I realized at that very awkward moment (for me) that I was talking to my grandmother, whom I had also not seen and talked to for over half a decade.

I’ll spare you the mandatory pleasantries and the doting, as it is not relevant.

What is relevant is the last thing that she ever told and did for me.

She beckoned me to her room upstairs and took me to a dark walk-in closet. It felt like an underground mine to me – a spacious room plastered with dress after dress and suit after suit.

The next thing that I know, she gives me this old shoe box, the most unremarkable thing you can lay your eyes on.

She gave it to me and said that it was my grandfather’s last will, something that he wanted only me to have.

I have to say that I didn’t even bother to open it even after me, my older sister, and my parents returned home.

Everyone was too caught up in their grief to notice the plain shoe box under my armpit.

So, what do you think happened next? Did my curiosity get the best of me and I opened the box, unwittingly unleashing a terrible curse free? Did I take it out back to burn it because of repressed grief? Was I curious about what was inside the box?

Nope (to all three).

I tossed it to the back of my closet and forgot about it for nearly a decade.

Even now, I remember it like it was yesterday.

I was packing all my things, preparing to go to the college of my dreams, when I came across the old box shoe box at the back of my closet that I had forgotten about completely.

The memories that I wrote above flooded back, and a sense of guilt washed over me, not so much for not having shed a single tear, but more so that I hadn’t honored my grandfather’s wishes.

It was because of this that I decided to finally open that old thing, the dust on top of the lid sliding off like frozen sleet when I did that. Inside the box, I found some very interesting contents.

There were four tapes in total, and an old (and I do mean old) tape player.

I was quite fascinated with what I saw and, not really expecting anything, I connected my more modern headphones to the dilapidated Walkman, put the cassette marked “#0” in, and pressed what I correctly assumed to be the “PLAY” button.

The following is a transcript of what was recorded on that Tape.:

&#x200B;

*\*BACKGROUND NOISE\**

*“Hello hello, testing one two one two. Uhh……Hello David \*LOUD COUGHING\* this…this is your grandfather speaking \*SOFT COUGH”. If you have received this, it means that I'm gone. I don’t know when or where you are listening to this.*

*I know I do not have long in this world, and this is why you now find yourself in this situation. Before I leave for good and end up in hell where I belong, I \*LONG FIT OF COUGHING\* I-I want to make sure that you, at the very least, become aware of the crimes that I have committed.”*

&#x200B;

The sound of my chair creaking loudly as I sat back echoed throughout my room, momentarily resonating with my mind and temporarily suspending my thoughts.

*What in the hell is he talking about?*

My curiosity was now peaked to say the least.

I had nothing to do for the rest of the day, as I had finished all of my work, and my parents were off somewhere.

I picked up the tape marked “#1” and put it in the Walkman.

&#x200B;

The name “ROSANNE” was written in bold Sharpie on it.

&#x200B;

*“In my day, David, things were much more boring than they are now. This was around the summer of 1963. I was barely ten years old, and I never had anything to do. We had a television, but animated cartoons didn’t exist yet, let alone computers or even video games like your generation has now. At most, you’d get a sitcom of sorts, but that always failed to capture my interest. It was too…adult, so to speak. There wasn’t anything explicit like how its common today. The entire American population would’ve crucified the entire network if that happened. It’s just that I could never relate to any of the jokes or situations that would be presented on such shows.*

*Newspaper cartoons weren’t any better.*

*You had “PEANUTS” which did admittedly hold my interest, but that interest would soon dissipate after a mere two minutes of re-reading it.*

*Don’t even get me started on books. There were no children’s books. There were either books that were read to my two-year-old brother, or books that my parents enjoyed to read, and I, meanwhile, enjoyed neither.*

*So, what do you think little old me did for entertainment during that age of stone?*

*Well, in my home town of Fulkron, Maine, there was only one place I could go.*

*It didn’t require money like the comic book store, so I could go there as often as I wanted to.*

*Deep in the woods between Fulkron and its neighboring town – Kanterville – there lay a massive reservoir with a small stream that gradually fattened into a decently-sized river. I’d tried to follow the river for fun a few times, but I was never very athletic, so I would already be exhausted after a mere 10 minutes of jogging. Instead, I preferred skipping rocks on the calm and serene surface of that clear, clear lake, and admiring all that it held. It was so clear that you could see all the way to the bottom, and I would gaze down from a tree I’d climb and just admire it until sunset.*

*I was an odd child, to say the least.*

*I never did swim in it as it was far, far too cold.*

*Admiring it from afar was enough for me.*

*Sometimes, even my best friend Rosanne would join.*

*\*PAUSE\**

*She herself was a girl from Kanterville, and she too enjoyed the lake. That is how we met in the first place.*

*Now…as I record this…I realize that I had grown to love her.*

*Who wouldn’t?*

*Ten-year-old me, as much as he had been indoctrinated by his peers to despise girls my age, still fell head-over-heels in love, but I wasn’t smart enough or experienced enough to realize it when I should’ve. Even now I remember how her hair crept down her back and how her laughter gently caressed the surface of the water, and how her presence made my heart flutter like the wings of a butterfly.*

*She would always talk about so many interesting things because she was so much smarter than me, and I enjoyed every word of it, even though I never really understood most of it.*

*I would have been content with living like that for the rest of the time that God had allotted to me…but alas, that is sadly not the case.*

*You see…our sanctuary was breached.*

*One day, a group of boys from the sixth grade came to the lake.*

*They were loud.*

*They were obnoxious.*

*And so on.*

*They destroyed the peace and tranquility of the place, and that angered me.*

*I confronted them, and they beat the living shit of me.*

*I was short for my age, and their constitutions had increased from puberty.*

*I didn’t stand a damn chance, even though I tried.*

*But that’s not why what happened happened.*

*No.*

*As I lay bleeding on the hard gravel, Rosanne came to my rescue. She stood between me and the bullies and told them off.*

*I still remember seeing her standing in front of me like an indomitable superhero.*

*But then those bullies showed me that she wasn’t an indomitable superhero.*

*Did they rape her?*

*Did they kill her?*

*Of course not.*

*We were just children.*

*I realize that now...too late...*

*They slapped her around just like they’d slapped me, and soon she too fell on the ground.*

*I felt one last surge of adrenaline and charged at the bastards, but the leader, a shit who must’ve weighed about two hundred pounds, slapped me once more, this time with all of his might, and I was out cold.*

*When I came too, the sun was  setting, and I only woke up because Rosanne was gently shaking me.*

*Our injuries were light in hindsight, but they hurt like hell.*

*She left, heading back to her house, but I didn’t leave.*

*I stood there, in front of that lake, until the sun barely peeked out of the mountains.*

*I washed my bloody face,terrified by the thought of what my father would do.*

*Each shot of cold water did nothing to quell down the rage I felt in myself..*

*In fact...it was like gasoline.*

*It fueled the fire inside of me.*

*My anger was building up.*

*Like the steam in a pressure cooker.*

*Or in a nuclear reactor, if I’m being honest.*

*It felt like I was paper being crumpled into a ball from the inside.*

*It just kept building and building and building.*

*I thought I could resist it, fight it, suppress it, but then I remembered how they'd slapped Rosanne and...*

*…*

*I sneezed.*

*I…sneezed…*

*Just when I thought my heart would implode of my eyes would cry blood or I’d vomit, I, instead, had the urge to sneeze and sneeze I did.*

*I sneezed the most powerful sneeze of my life – a large glob of snot landing right on the surface of the lake.*

*And just like that…my anger was gone.*

*As thought I had sneezed it out.*

*I went home and…I…slept.*

*I didn’t have a clue about what the hell I had just done.*

*I just slept in my  bed, blissfully ignorant of what I had unleashed.*

*The next day, I was back up there, but Rosanne was nowhere to be found.*

*I feared that she had abandoned me and the lake.*

*I remember feeling sad, my face covered in band aids that my mother put on me after I’d lied to her that I’d just hit a particularly sharp branch while coming home.*

*She thought he'd done...but said nothing.*

*But there I was, back again in that place, and waiting for her to arrive.*

*But as I waited, I noticed something peculiar.*

*I thought I saw a small wave.*

*But in truth, it looked just like the fin of a shark I’d seen in an encyclopedia.*

*I rubbed my eyes and honed my gaze, but saw nothing in that perfectly clear water.*

*Still, I couldn't help but feel uneasy.*

*But I was suddenly interrupted by the rude arrival of those little shits that had beaten me and Rosanne the other day.*

*I was angry.*

*I wanted to hurt them.*

*But again, I was reduced to a pathetic pulp on the ground.*

*As I lay there, my face wet with blood, I thought I saw the fin again, just peeking out of the water, like an extension of it, before disappearing again.*

*I saw them walking away and laughing on the edge of the lake, and then…it happened in an instant.*

*A massive wave sprung up from the serene lake, one that looked exactly like a shark made of water.*

*In the brief moment before it collided with them, its liquid maw clamping itself around them wide open, I expected them to be soaked, but instead, the gigantic monster bit down and dragged them into the lake. I crawled near the edge, the gravel below shredding my knees in the process, and I bore witness to everything through the clear water.*

*I saw no shark.*

*Only them swimming around for dear life, trying to go up, but then an invisible jaw seemed to bite down on them, blood rising up to the surface like chimney smoke. They were all picked off one by one, and I saw the horrifying sight of their bodies – their viscera – collecting in what I assumed was a stomach.*

*I ran and I cried all the way back home, and I stayed underneath my covers all day long.*

*I just lay there; the memories of those kids being chewed like grapes playing over and over in my mind until I fell asleep.*

*Suffice it to say, I did not sleep peacefully.*

*The next day, and to this day I’m still not sure how…I found the courage to return.*

*There, I found Rosanne, eating a sandwich all by her lonesome.*

*She too had a few band-aids on her face just like me, and we locked eyes.*

*I don’t think I will ever forget how much her face brightened in that moment…or how red my cheeks became.*

*Any fear I had melted away right at that moment.*

*I hurriedly told her that there was a shark made out of water in the lake, and to prove it, I took her sandwich and threw it in there.*

*In less than a moment, a great watery maw shot up and consumed the wet sandwich in an instant.*

*Childhood really is amazing.*

*We were facing something as terrifying as can be, and yet all it did was excite us.*

*But when I told her about how it had eaten the kids that had done us in so badly, I still vividly remember how her face creased, and her laughter seemed to go away.*

*We talked about it, and…somehow…we decided to kill it.*

*We went through all of the usual ideas. Harpoons and fishing, mostly, as well as the mandatory holy water, but then Rosanne proposed and idea which, at the time, I thought was absolutely genius.*

*She said we should lead the shark so that it would fall into a damn and be shredded to bits by it. I’d  once been to a hydrodam, and remembered staring in awe at the water gushing out of it from the reservoir it held behind. In my mind, that monster stood no chance against the countless propellers and turbines inside a dam, and Rosanne agreed.*

*I pulled out a piece of paper I had in my pocket along with an old crayon. Rosanne drew a rough map, showing me that the small river that flowed out of the lake led straight to a dam overlooking Kanterville.*

*I didn’t need any more convincing.*

*None.*

*The next day, we were up at the crack of dawn and met at the lake, each with a bucket of chum dangling off our tiny hands.*

*We got to work almost immediately, inflating the raft I had brought from home.*

*After it had fully inflated, we carried it all the way to the edge of the lake where the river flowed out.*

*We each got into the raft, holding onto a nearby branch so that it wouldn't float away.*

*I picked a handful of chum and chucked it at the lake.*

*Immediately, I saw a small wave approaching, and that is when we both let go of the branch.*

*Another handful of chum was all that was needed.*

*Soon, it was a game of cat and mouse. I would throw handful after handful out onto the river and the monster gladly followed. We’d try to keep a safe distance, but there were some close calls where we had to throw chum behind it so that it would go back and eat it, giving us enough time to get far enough away.*

*We were getting close.*

*The water was speeding up.*

*I could feel it. Just like we’d planned, the shark was following us steadily.*

*It was just too easy.*

*Eventually, we were running low on chum, and by the time we saw the edge of waterfall that fed the dam water, we were all out.*

*\*LONG PAUSE\**

*Our plan was to step on land and continue throwing chum into the water until the shark would fall down the waterfall. We’d reasoned that the falling water would keep it in.*

*\*PAUSE\**

*Now…we didn’t have any more bait to use.*

*The shark started to turn around and…honestly…I wasn’t too bothered by it. My brain still hadn’t fully developed yet, so I couldn’t comprehend just how dangerous that thing was, ergo why I was in such a hurry to find a plan for luring it back.*

*I was ready to call it quits, but Rosanne…*

*\*LONGEST PAUSE\**

*Rosanne…she jumped straight into the water, kicking and screaming to get its attention.*

*It worked.*

*The shark’s attention diverted to her, just as she fell off the water fall.*

*I screamed for Rosanne*

*I can only imagine now what she must’ve been thinking, how worried she must’ve been for her friends and family and strangers who could unknowingly walk into the lake.*

*She was doing it for them.*

*And for me.*

*I…was a coward.*

*Rosanne had gone over the waterfall and I ran over to the edge of the cliff that overlooked it.*

*It was a massive, massive reservoir, at least ten times bigger than the lake, and I saw Rosanne falling down, becoming a small pink speck that went under.*

*I was so focused by her that I failed to notice the shark as it launched itself besides me down the waterfall, dropping down much like a nuclear warhead.*

*What happened next is…something I will remember for the rest of my life.*

*You see…David…We’d made a mistake.*

*The dam we’d trapped the shark in wasn’t a hydrodam. It was just a regular dam that only kept water at bay.*

*The shark was only trapped.*

*At least, that’s what I thought.*

*Rosanne had come back up and had moved closer and closer to the dam wall, and I saw a small ladder stuck to it.*

*I was ecstatic.*

*Rosanne would escape!*

*But little did I know that the shark truly wasn’t done yet.*

*You see, when it entered the large reservoir of the dam, it started to collect water and grow in size, increasing exponentially as it ascended toward the surface.*

*The shark that was once as big as a bus was now as big as a fucking Boeing-747, if not more.*

*Its maw could’ve swallowed my house in its entirety, and Rosanne was not match for it.*

*But when it engulfed Rosanne, it had such angled momentum that it launched itself into the air like a dolphin.*

*It went over the edge of the dam.*

*I saw it all from where I stood.*

*I saw that gigantic, humongous shark composed entirety of water going over that fucking wall, nearly all the water of the dam gone, being dragged behind it like a long wedding dress.*

*But that wasn’t the worst part.*

*No, David.*

*You want to know what the worst part of it all was?*

*It was the realization I had later, when I grew older and remembered this.*

*The memory I had suppressed for so long came back.*

*I remembered seeing Rosanne floating in its crystal-clear body, and when I remembered this, I fell to my knees.*

*I wonder how she felt…*

*How did she feel having a front view seat view to the gigantic wave falling down like a tsunami on her hometown of Kanterville?*

*\*PAUSE\**

*Everyone said that it was a land slide that caused it.*

*Can you believe it?*

*I had seen it.*

*I’d seen that ghastly creature descending upon the small innocent town like a punishment from God, a merciless tsunami that leveled and washed everything away.*

*There were people that raved about it, people who had survived, but they had all either gone mad or were dismissed.*

*People who deserved no harm, or any such thing had died.*

*All gone, like ants washed away with a hose.*

*And you know what?*

*It was me.*

*It was all my fault.*

*It’s all my fault that those people and their possible descendants will never walk on this world.*

*I am not seeking forgiveness.*

*That won’t take away my curse.*

*Just closure…however small that might be.*

*I just wish I could have told Rosanne how I truly felt when I could've.*

*I feel like that would've made me less sad.*

*Isn't that selfish, my dear Grandson?*

*An entire town wiped out...and all I can think about is a silly old childhood crush...”*

*\*RECORDER TURNS OFF\**

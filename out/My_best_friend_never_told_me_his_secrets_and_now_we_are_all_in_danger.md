When I was younger, my parents split up. I ended up with my Dad, and we had a lot of fun. He was genuinely a nice parent, and I was really lucky. For a short while, at least. When I was around 11, I began to bleed from my ear, on a regular basis. Like nosebleeds, I could tell when they would happen. And boy, did they. My record was 30 in one month. As a side effect, I walked around with red-stained ears. This obviously did little to help my social life, and I was mocked relentlessly.

Things got worse. When I turned 12, the ear bleeds stopped, and so did all hearing in my ears. My dad and I saw every doctor we could. To no avail. When we tried hearing aids, they didn't work. Somehow, I still couldn't hear. I ended up learning sign language, which me and my dad still sometimes use. Things got better, however. For about 2 hours.

When I turned 13, I regained all hearing. However, my ear bleeds returned. When I turned 14, my ear bleeds stopped, and so did my hearing. On and on this cycle repeated...

Years later, I found out why. If it didn't leave me trembling to my very core, I wouldn't be sitting here with you, Doctor.

I'll jump right in. When I was 18, I left for college. My first year of college would be gracefully without stained ears. During my first year, I met another deaf kid. He was older than me by 2 years, but we hit it off. We made friends and hung out a lot. He knew what I was going through, and that helped. Everything ended in May. One night, we got together to celebrate his 21st birthday. He got hammered. So did I. But I remember everything clearly. His eyes glazed over. He looked at me with cold, dead eyes, then threw himself out of the window. I rushed to the windowsill, reaching out as I knew it would be too late.

 He hit the ground at a high velocity and broke many bones. When he was taken to the hospital, he jumped out of the window again. This time, it killed him. Police ruled it off as suicide, though they had an autopsy done as standard protocol. The autopsy was done in secret and the reports were transported away. 

2 days ago, it was the day before my 21st birthday, and my request to see the files finally came through. I was driven in a black SUV to a non-discreet building. Government officials sat me down in a gray, cold chair, and a man with a shitty toupee told me that I only get to see the files due to my relation with the victim. He slid the files across the table, and what I read shocked me.

>!FILE: \[REDACTED\]\_SUICIDE
Patient: A1
Medical History:
Age 11: Ear bleeding
Age 12: Hearing Loss
Age 13: Ear bleeding
Age 14: Hearing Loss!<  


On it went.  My best friend had never told me. But the file wasn't finished.  


>!Age 21: On his Birthday, Patient A1 committed suicide, passing the parasite onto the witness. 
Suggested Quarantine Measures:
Eliminate at all costs. If the parasite spreads, humanity will be destroyed.!<

I looked up from the file warily, breath shortening. The 4 men in the room registered that I had read all that I needed to read, and they pointed their guns at me. But just before they were about to shoot, a strange look came over their eyes. The men all had red eyes, so imagine my confusion when they turned blue. The men shuddered, then put their guns down. They blankly stared, allowing me to leave. I got in my car and drove off as fast as possible.

When I got home, the news started. From the 4 men, the parasite jumped. 4 became 45 became 1000 became 7,735,865,935. All those people... just mindless piles of rotting flesh.

You know, I'm very glad that we are having this chat, Doctor. It's great to have such small things, now that that's the only thing still alive anymore. I miss the old days. I have some guesses as to what my part in all this was. I think the parasite was waiting. Waiting for the time to strike, for when it had found the right person. I guess that was me. When it activated, I still dont know why I was spared from becoming a heap of flesh. Oh, well. After I've finished talking to your corpse, Doctor, I might just go for a walk. Pick up some rubble, maybe. Find some food, any food that's left. I suppose I should go. I'll bring you back something later.

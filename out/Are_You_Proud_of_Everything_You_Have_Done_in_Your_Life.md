A guy reached for my coffee cup before me, holding it away as he asked, "Are you proud of everything you have done in your life?"

I stared at him in offense, my lip curled at his pale, hairless face. "That's mine, freak."

He handed it to me. "Are you?"

"Fuck you," I snapped, snatching it out of his long, boney fingers.

I walked out of the coffee shop, scoffing at that freak's audacity as I took a sip. The last thing I needed was a philosophical weirdo stealing my time, patience, and coffee when I was in a hurry.

Hustling back to my office building, I wrinkled my nose at the crumpled pile of drug addicts on the side of the sidewalk. This city was going to shit. After crossing the street, I frowned at another group of collapsed druggies. One of them was on his back, and he looked eerily like my college roommate. 

Coincidence. Creepy coincidence. They all looked the same, these addicts.

A screech of tires drew my attention away from the vagrants, and I turned around just in time to see a car hit an old, homeless man. The hobo bounced off the hood and crashed to the ground, his bones cracking as he landed in a heap. Moaning, he reached out to the driver for help as blood dripped down his busted face … and the driver ran him over. I gasped as the hobo rolled beneath the wheels, his brain squirting out of his crushed skull as the car zoomed away.

Coincidence. Creepy coincidence.

I jumped as something tugged at my pants, and I kicked away one of the addict's hands in disgust. She rolled on her back with a hoarse groan, and I froze at the sight of the mole on her gaunt face. My college friend had one in the exact same spot. The addict peeked through her eyelids. She has the same eye color too. Coincidence. Creepy coincidence. It had to be. Her cracked lips opened, but before she could utter a word, whatever life she had left faded from her glazed eyes.

Before I could react, a commotion pushed me aside as a gaggle of officers escorted a woman out of a residential building beside me. Was she … my former supervisor? It couldn't be. Coincidence. Just a creepy coincidence. Her husband was running after them, an infant in his hands, both of them crying. The woman kept tearfully proclaiming she was innocent, but I didn't see what happened next as a second screech made me jump and turn around.

I stared in disbelief as another car bounced a homeless man off its hood before mashing him beneath its wheels and speeding off. A chill crept beneath my skin as I watched the hobo's brain ooze. This wasn't a coincidence anymore. What was happening? 

My pulse racing, I turned to see if the police had noticed the accident, only to realize the chaos had multiplied. Every building door around me had erupted with cops, pleading hubbies, wailing babies, and tearful declarations of innocence from an overly familiar woman. Vehicles zoomed down the street, flinging bums left and right before running them over. Uncomfortably familiar addicts lurched and stumbled from every corner, collapsing at my feet.

With my terrified heart drumming, I backed away, only to scream as I bumped into someone. I whipped around, and my wide eyes landed on the pale, hairless face of the freak from the coffee shop.

"Are you proud of everything you have done in your life?" he asked, expressionless.

"Who are you! What's going on?" I yelled, trying to stifle the fear in my trembling voice.

"Are you?"

I flinched as another car's tires screeched. "Who the hell are you! What do you want?"

"I want to know if you are proud of everything you have done in your life. And I want the truth. For the truth will set you free."

I froze at his choice of words. "What … what are you? An angel?"

"Answer my question first."

"No … no I'm not proud of everything I've done," I said, my tight breaths jagged as I kicked away the vagrants clawing at my legs. "I regret … I regret dealing drugs. I regret the hit and run. I regret getting my supervisor fired."

"No you don't."

I gulped as I tried to hold his dry, emotionless gaze. "Yes … yes I do."

"No, you don't. Tell me the truth."

I frowned in frustrated distress, my breaths accelerating. "Is … is this a test?"

"Yes. And the truth is the only correct answer."

I jerked away from a crawling addict who looked like my freshman year lab partner. "O … okay." I winced in tense resignation. "I … I'm an ambitious person."

"That is a good start."

"I … I was a drug dealer in college. I started selling to my friends, then branched out. I was a bit pushy, but that's how I made a ton, and yes, I'm proud of that. I don't have student loans because of that. And it's not my fault they died. I took drugs too, but I knew my limits. I didn't let anyone push me."

I gawked as the throng of addicts moaning around me vanished. "H-how … ?"

"Go on," he said, unfazed.

Desperate for answers, I decided to continue giving him what he wanted. "After graduating, I got my job off pure talent, but I couldn't advance because my supervisor suspected I was spying for the competition. She was right, so I had two reasons to get rid of her. I planted drugs in her office on her sick day and tattled to the CEO. He fired her, called the cops, and gave me her job. So, yea, I'm proud I managed to save my ass and advance in the company."

I stumbled as cops shoved me aside, a baby's screams making me wince as the father rushed by, begging for his wife's release. "I know this scene looks bad, but she worked twenty-four seven, barely even saw her husband and kid, so it's not like they'd be lost without her. They had a nanny and her husband worked too. And she was just recently released. Her reputation got shaky, but it's not like I ruined her life."

Just like the addicts, the groups of cops, supervisors, husbands, and babies vanished before my stunned eyes. 

"Go on," he said.

I glanced at the latest mangled hobo. "At my promotion party, I drank more than I should have, and I hit a homeless man while driving home. He was still alive, asking me for help, but I wasn't about to lose everything I worked hard on for someone useless no one cared about. I did him a favor and put him out of his misery. And yes, I'm proud I got away with it. My life is worth more than his."

Just like the others, the bodies and zooming cars disappeared, leaving the strange man and me standing alone in a quiet, empty city.

"Anything else?" he asked.

I shook my head, then I frowned and shook it again as wooziness took over. "Wuz hapin?" I asked, my words slurring as I stumbled against the wall.

"Perhaps it was your coffee."

I looked at him in terror. "Waya puninit?*

"The same thing you put in Drew's drink."

My labored heart dropped. "I hadda annidote!" I mumbled in a frenzy as I slumped to the ground. "I wannit gradidude an twust! I'm pwoud I found away to get inna inner circle. No one got pemenely hurt!"

I gasped as my head cleared, and I scrambled upright on shaky legs. "Please, please tell me what you are." I looked around at the vacant, motionless city, my suspicions culminating in dread. "Am … am I dead? Was this a test to see if I make it to heaven? Did I pass?"

"You did pass, but you will not be going to heaven."

His words tore through my remaining composure and I fell to my knees. "You said the truth would set me free! I don't belong in hell! All the stuff I did, it's survival of the fittest, we're all fighting to get ahead in life! So many put themselves first to gain power and money! Why not me? Everyone should be doing that! It's the game of life! All I did was take what God gave me and use it to survive in His world! That isn't a sin!"

"There is no heaven."

I stared, blindsided. "What?"

"There is no heaven. No hell. At least, not in the way you know them. And you are not dead."

"But … then … what … what are you? What was this test?"

"I am here to recruit you."

"Recruit me?"

"A war is coming. We are building an army."

"A war?" Fear rippled down my spine as I got back to my feet. "Where? Against who?"

"You will know these details if you accept."

"But are you the good guys?"

"Does it matter? You mentioned survival of the fittest. Accepting this offer would be to your advantage."

"Why me?"

"It will be a dirty war. We are recruiting the most ruthless, opportunistic, and unscrupulous of beings. Do you accept?"

"What if I say no?"

"Your memory will be wiped and you will return to your life, to ultimately die when the war begins."

I gulped. "And if I say yes?"

"You will come with me to begin your training."

My eyes scanned the empty streets, uncertainty and desire winding through my flustered mind. "May I be allowed a day to sort out a few things? "

"That can be arranged."

…

This is my final message to all you weak, righteous losers out there thinking you're doing the right thing, enjoy perishing in a war you'll never survive. The meek won't be inheriting the earth, the ruthless will.

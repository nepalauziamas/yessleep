The soft hum of the AC is the only thing that can be heard. In a dimly lit room, I’m completely alone in bed, under a warm cozy blanket. I lay on my side, facing the wall, with tightly shut eyes and paralyzed with fear. I hold my breath, not having the guts to move because I can feel their eerie stare on me. “I am alone, I am alone”, these words loop in my head in a useless effort to comfort myself. But am I really?

By now, I am shaking uncontrollably and breathing becomes impossible to do. Even if I try my best to make sure to never see them, I can feel their presence getting closer and closer.

They are here, all five of them. Their bodies are freakishly lanky and dark, with long and pointy fingers. All of them idling in their usual spots.

In the window I can see one of them pressed up against the glass, blocking the light from the street lamps outside. He has his hands pressed up to the glass next to his head, staring into the hellish place that has become of my bedroom. 

There are two in the corner, one standing near the door and staring, while the other is crouched under the desk, holding it’s knees to his chest, bending it’s body in an uncomfortably unnatural way. 

When I look up, there is one who likes to crawl at unnervingly high speeds across the ceiling. Tonight it stays still, only watching me from above in its uncanny spiderman position.

Another one stands tall at the foot of the bed, hunched over me with its back against the ceiling. It’s long boney arms reaching down to touch me with its long cold fingers, as if traces over my skin. The sensation feels so real, my mind begins to race with doubt of everything I once knew. How can they be real? 

All I can do is lay there, completely helpless and petrified. My cries fill the room and go unheard. I know there’s more of them, watching in the dark. The urge to scream is strong but when I try, no sound comes out of your mouth, only desperate breaths. I can try to hide under the blanket, and I can try to look away, but they will never leave. They are always there, watching and tormenting me. Their precense is a forever taunting reminder of how fucked up I really am.  

This is my life now. The creatures that live in my head haunt me everyday. My psychiatrist gave me some new pills, she said these would make my hallucinations stop. The last ones didn’t work, the ones before that didn’t either. My medicine cabinet is starting to fill up with failed attempts at maintaining my sanity. 

No amount of pills seems to make them go away. Every night before when I go to bed, they’re there. They watch me, touch me, and terrify me. And now I can’t sleep.

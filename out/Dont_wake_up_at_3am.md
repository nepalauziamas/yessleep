I know most people are going to think i just had a bad dream, but this experience was 100% real, and it still haunts me to this day.

It was mid summer and i had just finished my junior year of highschool, and now that i was 18, i moved back in with my dad and started working part time to help with bills. Since it was July, i hadn't yet gone back to school and i had a taken a few days off from work to relax and spend some time with the family. My dad had gone up north fishing for a few days so i had the house to myself for the weekend. After a day full of lounging around and gaming, i decide to call it a night and plopped myself onto my bed before conking out completely. I finally woke back up some time later, and unsure of the time, glanced over at my digital alarm clock. 3:04 am, it read.

 My room was dark and quiet, with the only light source being the alarm clock. Not sure as to why i had awoken at such an odd hour, i sat up in bed and rubbed the sleep out of my eyes, wanting to get a better view of my surroundings, i reached for my phone and clicked on the flashlight app. Once the room was partially illuminated, i saw something that sent a chill down my spine: my bedroom door was open. I always close my door when i go to bed, so i know i wasn't the one who left it open, and my dad wasn't home at the time either. Not sure of how it happened, i crawled out of bed to close it, and as i reached my hand for the doorknob, i was instantly hit with a wave of terror. My skin started to crawl, my stomach was in a knot, my throat tightened up, and my heart started racing. Every fiber of my being was telling me that i wasn't alone, that something was out there, and that touching my door was a death sentence.

 I tried to peer out into the living room, but it was pitch black, and i saw nothing, then i turned my ear to listen for any sounds, but heard nothing. Whatever lurked out there could be neither seen nor heard, and it only served to intensify my already massive feeling of dread. So, following my gut feeling, i slowly sauntered back to my bed, crawled under the covers, and shut my eyes tight. I laid there for what felt like an eternity, afraid, afraid of whatever that thing was, wondering if it was going to come for me, or if it was waiting for me to come out. Before long, i drifted back to sleep. I awoke the following morning to discover my bedroom door properly shut again. My dad got home from his fishing trip sometime that afternoon and i asked him if he'd seen anything strange outside the house, he said that he hadn't, but then he asked me a question that still echoes in my mind to this day: "Why'd you leave the front door unlocked?"

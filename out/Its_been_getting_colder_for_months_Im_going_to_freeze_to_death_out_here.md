Gosh, my mind is so cooked I cant even remember the year this started but I can recall the month. Here we go.

Back in mid April from however long ago it was. The News channels began reporting of a slight breeze all across the U.S. It wasn't super unusual, due to the increase of poor weather, I was listening to the news on my freshly bought 80's mobile home in a raggedy old trailer park. It smelled of old cigarettes' and week old thanksgiving ham. I had to scrape together whatever earnings I could find from my low education McDonald's job.

My job was something I can only describe as nightmarish. Flipping burgers made me come home smelling like a dog that had only been showered once every 5 years. It was horrid, I hated it. It made me very depressed, although my savings weren't enough for therapy.

I had been tuning into the news for weeks at that point seeing as they only described the "Breeze" as Perpetual and it never seemed to go away. In late April to early May, it became close to fall weather even so much as to the trees dying and people beginning to wear jackets, that wasn't the weirdest thing either. Reports of this perpetual cold had shown up in Europe. I had originally brushed this off as normal until I realized how similar it was all around the world.

I was very creeped out upon hearing this news, I had begin seeing people rush to stores to assumedly buy materials for the storm ahead. I followed in their footsteps, buying anything I could find such as, food, tents cooking kits, and generally just any supply.

As life moved on and the months progressed. It had become colder, to the point where it began to snow and icicle's began forming on the sharp edges of buildings just as a cold winter would.

I had finally realized how severe this was, although it was to late. It was September and I was going to go to a relatives house to check on them and make sure she was okay, I walked out of my house with my screen door struggling to open due to the ice that had formed on the hinges. Finally I had managed to break the door open and get to my car, as I walked to my car I could see my breath as clear as day. I don't know if it were the cold or something else but as I saw my breath I had a chill creep down my spine. Afterwards I opened the driver side door to my car, my cold hands shook as I struggled to put the key into the hole.

It took 4 tries of constant "Chugga-Chugging"  before my car started. I instantly turned the heat on as I wiped the icicles off of my small moustache. I stomped on the gas pedal and began my way to my relatives house. I felt a sharp stinging pain in my hands, although I didn't care. As I was carefully making my way down the street until I saw a pair of feet hanging out of a dumpster. I stopped and aimed my gaze towards them then I had realized the town I once grew up in had become a shell, a ghost of its former self. I couldn't find a single soul for miles as I continued my way.

After hours of driving I had finally found the relatives house in the middle of nowhere. It was late at night and her car wasn't there I'm not to sure why that didn't drive me away but I ruffled around for a key until I remembered she kept one in her back shed just in case. I went back there and my heart sank, I saw her curled into a fetal position on her side she seemed blue in the damp moonlight which lit her corpse.

I wanted to vomit, her skin was stuck to the cold concrete floor. I ran to my car and drove off as fast as I could.

I finally ran out of gas in a desert like area. It was covered in snow, I scanned the early morning roads as I had observed a small quaint little gas station, I had slammed the brake to my car almost hitting my head on the steering wheel I then turned the car off, took some supplies, took my laptop and made my way into the gas station.

This is were I am now writing to whoever in the world might see this as we all to freeze to death out here.

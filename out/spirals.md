 

There she was, a beautiful young lady; she made headlines in her community;

the youngest hijabi millionaire, a woman with power, intelligence, and beauty.

&#x200B;

Though her parents were no match for what she made for herself.

She was to be forced to marry her cousin,

&#x200B;

*: “This wealth cannot be given to some man of no morals.”*

&#x200B;

She despised them but never once showed an ounce of disrespect.  After her Medical School rotations, she is to be in the middle east, as signed in the contract.

&#x200B;

*: “MOTHER!  she cried.  What good is a life without free will!  I don’t want to marry!”*

&#x200B;

*: “It’s For the best, Get us out of this mess, and let us leave your father in peace! “*

&#x200B;

She may look perfect from the outside, but she was suffering,

Suffering from an abusive father; What she did was never enough; the degrees, The money, and everyone she helped over the years never raised an eyebrow.

He was the definition of a narcist, a sick man; you can tell by the way he snickers and the comments uttered in his mouth; that man is nothing but a psychopath.

&#x200B;

She dreaded the last day of her rotations, But the news reached the family before she thought.

&#x200B;

*: “Pack your bags; we have a wedding to catch.” He said with a disgusting grin.*

&#x200B;

The Arab Airplane ride was bumpy, Kids were crying, and people were yelling, it was very humid, and the 11-hour flight started to smell.

&#x200B;

*: “Why are you crying?!” He snapped.*

&#x200B;

*: “It’s just a headache.” she sniffed.*

&#x200B;

*: “It will be over soon, wipe those tears; no one wants an ugly bride.”*

&#x200B;

The rumbling became heavier.

&#x200B;

*^(“It’s just turbulence,”)* she repeated to herself.

&#x200B;

”**creeeeeeeckkkkk**”

&#x200B;

She hugged herself, wishing that would do some benefit for a good landing.  You can see the terrifying look on everyone’s face.  In a matter of seconds, everyone went silent.  But there was a noise she couldn’t seem to understand. 

It appeared to be from a distance.

It’s the pilot, but what was he saying!

&#x200B;

All she could hear was hearts beating as her eyes blinked slowly.  Her tears are now running down more than ever.  She turned her head ever so slightly, and her heart felt like it fell to the pits of the earth.  There was a fire outside her airplane window!  She’s in shock!

&#x200B;

**BOOM**!

&#x200B;

It was a crash.  The plane crashed!

&#x200B;

People gathered in agony; legs were ripped off, and body parts were thrown miles away.  Screams were unbearable, and kids were vomiting from fear. 

&#x200B;

*“HELP ME”!*  He yelled, with a leg half torn. 

*“WHAT GOOD OF A DOCTOR ARE YOU?  DON’T JUST STAND THERE; FIX THIS MESS”!*

&#x200B;

She was furious even in this kind of situation.  His pride was bigger than himself.  She had the power now.  She was in control! 

Her future lies within these very moments; should she help this psychopath of a man or help herself!

“*GET FUCKEN GOING, HELP ME!”* He shouted in terror.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Part 2 soon?

“Lacey! Lacey”

I took my hands off my face. Grandpa was crouching over me with concern. The screaming man was gone. Everyone was gone. There was only Grandpa.

“What’s the matter?” he asked. “Are you all right?”

I hugged him suddenly, tightly, and began to sob. “Grandpa, I want to get out of this house. I want to go home. Right now. I want to get out.”

Grandpa patted my back. “There, there. Okay. It’s all right. Everything’s all right.”

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

I sat on the couch, sullenly. I’d just spilled my guts to Grandpa, telling him about every single unusual thing that had happened since I’d arrived. Suzie, the mice, the two women, all the naked maimed people, and the worst of them all – the screaming man. Grandpa had listened patiently, but hadn’t validated anything I’d said. Instead, he’d just left the room, promising to return.

Grandpa returned, pushing a TV stand into my view. He pushed "play" on a VCR.  An image popped up on the screen: the hall outside my bedroom. It was black and white, with no sound.

My eyes widened excitedly, and I sat up straight on the couch. “My tape!” I’d totally forgotten about my surveillance system. “You can see now! You can see everything! Just watch.”

Grandpa and I watched as, on screen, I came running out of the bathroom.

“There! Watch, you're gonna see . . .”

But my heart sank as I watched myself on screen, screaming silently, running back and forth from invisible predators.

“What?” was the only word I could muster.

On-screen Lacey cowered against a wall. On-screen Grandpa emerged and consoled her. Watching this was surreal. At no point was there any sign of any other people.

“That's impossible,” I declared.

Grandpa stopped the tape.

I leaned back on the couch, a stubborn expression on my face. “They don't turn up in photos,” I said. “I guess they don't turn up on video either.”

“I thought the folklore was that ghosts *only* turn up in photos.”

“Well, the folklore's wrong,” I snapped.

“Lacey,” Grandpa said. His tone was carefully controlled, and I’m sure highly practiced to not seem condescending. It irritated me nonetheless. “Might I suggest that there's another possibility here?”

“What, that I'm crazy?”

“Not crazy. We don't say crazy. Crazy is for rock stars and car salesmen.” His sense of humor was grating all of a sudden. He sat down on his chair across from me and clasped his hands. "Let me suggest something to you, and I am not saying this is the way it is, period, end of story, I am just suggesting one possible scenario. Okay? I think all of us, we think we need a mother.”

I rolled my eyes. “Oh, here we go.”

“No, listen to me. I think all of us, we think we need a mother. Why? To protect us. To keep us safe. So what happens if we don't have a mother? Hmm? Maybe we -- what is the word . . . compensate. Overcompensate. Maybe we overcompensate to make ourselves feel safe. Like maybe we don't even want to go outside. Hmm? Because inside is safe. Like the womb we came out of. Before it left us and went away. Does that make sense? Or am I babbling like an old man?”

I shrugged grumpily. Of course it made sense. The psychological math was almost too neat.

“And then imagine maybe there is another part of our brain,” Grandpa continued. “which says, if I am in danger, then maybe my mother will come to me. If I am in mortal danger, then she will have to come to me because that is what mothers do, goddammit, and she will have no choice. So our brain, it is very clever, it creates danger out of nothing. It shows us ghosts and goblins and monsters under the bed, when really there is nothing there. What does this sound like to you? Does it sound like it could be true?”

I’d had enough. “Look, this place is haunted!” I shouted at him. “Okay? It's haunted! I know you psychologists always try to say it's all about the parents. But this is not about my mom. I hardly even think about my mom. She's like a non-part of my life.”

“Really?”

“Yes.” I was lying, and he knew it. “It's like, how can I miss someone I've never even known?”

Grandpa rewound the tape and pressed "play" again. We watched myself on screen, fleeing from invisible foes. Why was he making me watch this again? It was humiliating.

“It's just . . .” I started thinking about my mother. Then I voiced something I’d never voiced to anyone. “You'd think she might have called me. At least once during my entire life, she might have picked up the phone and . . .” My throat felt thick, and I couldn’t continue.

“That was part of the agreement between her and your father.”

“I know. But hasn't she been, like, tempted to break the rules? I mean, isn't she even curious to hear what I sound like?”

Grandpa was silent. He just let me spill.

“It's kinda funny,” I said, though it wasn’t funny at all. “The letters I write her, I put like ten times more effort into those than I do for any kind of schoolwork. And the photos I send her, my god, it's like I'm a model and I'm trying to get into a fashion magazine. I'm all like, look how frigging fabulous I turned out, Mom. Even without you.”

My eyes start to well up.

“And I can't help thinking,” I continued, “that maybe if I was a little bit smarter or funnier or prettier, that maybe she'd actually wanna meet me. You know, maybe she'd be, I dunno, like proud of me or something.” I finally broke down and sobbed. 

Grandpa rushed to me and embraced me.

“Why doesn't she want to meet me?” I bawled. “I'm her own daughter.”

Grandpa kept hugging me and telling me everything was all right and okay. Then he broke apart from me and wiped some tears from my cheek. “Do you believe me now that the ghosts are all in your head?” he asked.

“I don't know. I'm so confused. They seemed so real.”

“Do you allow for the possibility that they're all in your head?”

I nodded.

“Good,” Grandpa said. “That's a good start.”

He gave me a handkerchief, which was such an old man thing, but at least it was clean. I blew my nose as he sat back in his chair.

“You know what we just had? We had a breakthrough.” He hit his palm with his fist. “Pow! We broke through like that.”

I laughed.

“We are going to get through this, Lacey,” Grandpa said, serious again. “You and me together. But you have to stay in the house and face this stuff face-on. If you leave, it's just going to get worse.”

“But I'm scared.”

“I know. Here is what I want you to do. Next time you see a ghost, I want you to close your eyes and tell yourself, ‘It's not real. It's all in my head. When I open my eyes, it will be gone.’”

I snorted. “That's your big advice?” I said, obnoxiously. “I've been doing that already.”

“And? Does it work?”

I had to admit he had me there, and I was a little ashamed by my previous dismissiveness. “Well. Actually. Sometimes. Yeah.”

“Well, then. Will you keep trying it, Lacey? Will you stay in the house?”

I pondered this question. I know it probably seems insane that I didn’t demand to get as far away from that house as possible. Threaten a hunger strike, do whatever it took. There were two reasons I didn’t. One, Grandpa had genuinely sowed the seeds of doubt as to whether the supernatural things I’d been experiencing were real; and if they were in my head, I knew he was the only one who could help me. Two, it was no easy feat to transport me elsewhere, and wherever that might be, I would need a guardian. Dad would’ve likely had to cut his Japan business trip short, take a short-notice flight back to Canada, and drive me back to Minnesota. I didn’t want to do that to him. I was sick of being a burden to people. 

So my answer to Grandpa’s question was, “Okay.”

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

Later that day, while Grandpa was out hunting, I was standing at the counter, making my lunch. I’d already poured myself a glass of milk, and put it on a tray along with an apple. I took a loaf of bread (one Grandpa had baked himself) out of the breadbox, and put it on a cutting board. Then I pulled what I thought was a bread knife from the knife stand. But it was actually a meat cleaver. I froze, the knife half-slid out of its slot. I instantly recognized it as the one the screaming man had wielded, had raised above his head to split me in two. I tried to remember if I’d seen Grandpa using that knife to make dinner. That would explain how my mind could have conjured it into the hands of an imaginary monster. I decided, for my own peace of mind, that that must have been the case.

I made a ham sandwich, then took my lunch up to my room, where I ate the sandwich while finishing up a project. I was making slides out of some 35mm color-reversal film I’d developed myself. I liked projecting my photos – mostly indoor still lifes, self-portraits, portraits of Dad, or images taken through window panes – onto walls or bedsheets. Anything that could make my tiny world seem bigger. The work involved carefully cutting each individual frame from the strip of film, stapling it into a cardboard frame, and placing it into my slide projector for later viewing. 

I was startled by a knock on my window, and was surprised to see Suzie, the girl who’d talked to me outside the car, crouched on the sill. 

“Hi, Lacey,” she said, her voice muffled by the window pane. “Can you let me in?”

I closed my eyes and recited the mantra Grandpa had taught me. “You're not real. You're in my head. When I open my eyes, you will be gone.” I opened my eyes. Suzie was not gone.

“Please?” she said.

“Just one more minute!” I shouted. I grabbed the Polaroid and snapped a picture of Suzie. She rolled her eyes as I waited for the photo to develop. “Sorry!” I shouted again, feeling like an idiot.

The photo developed, showing Suzie’s annoyed face peering through the window, a hint of my own reflection overlaying it.

“Okay, I guess you’re real!” I said, unlatching the window and retreating to the far end of the room.

“Thanks for taking my photograph,” Suzie said as she clambered inside. “You just stole my soul.”

“Oh my God,” I said, immediately feeling flushed. “I'm so sorry. I didn't know.”

“I'm kidding.”

“Oh.” I felt stupid and white. But I appreciated that Suzie had already picked up enough of my condition to immediately close the window behind her, without comment, allowing me to relax. While also taking the piss out of me.

I handed her the photo. “Here. You can have this.”

Suzie looked at it, critically. “Not even my good side.”

“How'd you get up here?” I wondered.

“Drainpipe.”

I suddenly realized this was an opportunity for information gathering. “Suzie. When I saw you earlier, and you said be careful. What did you mean by that?”

Suzie looks at her closely. “You've been seeing spirits, haven't you?”

“Spirits?” I asked. “What do you mean, spirits?”

“Ghosts,” she deadpanned.

Finally, someone had said it. I didn’t know if I was more relieved or terrified. “There are ghosts around here?”

Suzie nodded. “Long time ago, bunch of Indians fought a bunch of white men right on this land. They got slaughtered.”

“The Indians?”

“That's generally how things went, yeah.”

“Right. Sorry.” I felt flushed again.

“Almost a whole tribe. Gone in one day. That kind of violence, it changes a place. Makes it different.”

“You mean haunted.”

Suzie nodded. “Ever since then, you kill something around here . . . it doesn't stay dead.”

I mulled this over. On the one hand, she was validating my experiences. On the other hand, it could all be nonsense. I decided to press further. This is what I gathered were the rules of the ghosts, according to Suzie:

\- They came out at night, mostly. That's when they were strongest.

\- Whether they were good or bad depended on what they were when they were alive.

\-  She wasn’t sure if they could hurt you. Her brother said one came after him once, but it passed right through him like it was made of smoke.

\- You coudn’t kill them. The only thing that could kill a spirit was another spirit.

“Can we stop talking about this?” Suzie said, finally.

“Sorry.” I felt bad. Suzie had probably dropped by looking for a connection to another girl who was at least somewhere around her own age. Instead, I’d just pumped her for details about myths to satisfy my curiosity about what were likely my own hallucinations. 

Suzie, who’d been studying me for a bit, removed a necklace from her neck and handed it to me. “Here. Take this.”

“What is it?” I asked, examining what appeared to be a face carved out of wood, with a little piece of feather attached.

“It's supposed to ward off evil spirits. Don't know if it works. But I think you need it more than me.”

“Oh. Thanks.”

“I’m gonna open the window again.”

I retreated, appreciating the warning. Suzie slipped one leg out.

“Wait,” I said, suddenly. “My grandpa put out a lot of bear traps around here. So be careful.”

“I'm not worried,” Suzie replied. “No offense, but white people can't hunt for shit.” With that, she disappeared out the window.

I stared at the talisman in my hand. It was tempting to take everything Suzie said at face value, to put that thing around my neck, and hope that it worked in staving off the ghosts. But that would be buying into a world where ghosts were real. It would be going against everything my trusted grandfather had told me. And I wasn’t ready to do that. So I tossed the talisman towards a wicker garbage basket in the corner. It didn’t really register at the time, but I missed the basket, and the talisman landed against the wall.

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

Later that day, I sat on the living room couch reading a book Dad had brought back from London for me earlier that year called *Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone*. Believe it or not, I wasn’t that into it, and my attention kept drifting.

Suddenly, my eyes narrowed at something I hadn’t noticed before: a ceramic cat on the mantelpiece. A tabby cat.

*Tabby.* The word I’d seen written in steam on the bathroom mirror.

I put down the book, got up, and walked over to the fireplace. I picked up the cat curiously, turning it around in my hands. A clinking sound emerged from within. I looked at the bottom, where there was a plastic plug. I pulled out the plug, and shook the cat until something fell out into my hand.

A key. I knew immediately what it was for.

Moments later, I stood in front of the one locked door in the house. I inserted the key in the lock. Sure enough, it fit. I unlocked the door, and opened it, a little apprehensive about what lay behind it. 

It was dark inside, only barely illuminated when I flicked on a smudged overhead light. It was a small room, filled to the bursting point with bookshelves. Each shelf was lined with old binders. I went over to a shelf. These binders each had a number written on the spine, as well as, “RP. Dr. Anson Woodley.” I pulled out a binder at random and opened it. It was filled with indecipherable charts and graphs, plus pages and pages of illegible handwriting. Dr. Anson Woodley needed to work on his penmanship. 

I closed the binder, put it back, and moved on to another shelf, pulling down another binder marked, “Patient Profiles.” Each page in this one had a photograph of a patient, their name, and some brief descriptive keywords.

One of the pages depicted a young, sad-looking woman. The name on top read, "BENNINGS, SARAH." One of the keywords was, "CHILD KILLER."

I flipped to another page, and frowned in vague recognition. I thought maybe, possibly, the picture resembled the young, wolfish man who’d appeared to me briefly when I’d first arrived in the house. But of course that would be impossible. His name was, "SHELDON, MARK." Two keywords were, "SERIAL RAPIST" and "MESSIAH COMPLEX."

I shuddered and flipped the page. My eyes widened and I nearly dropped the binder. There was no mistaking who this person was. His name read, "WALTERS, JACOB." Two keywords were "BERSERKER” and "MASS MURDERER." His screams echoed in my head.

I slammed the binder shut and shoved it back on the shelf. I held my head in my hands.

*No. It's not him. It's not possible. That would make everything real.*

I shoved the thought away and regained some composure. I caught sight of a small, two-drawer filing cabinet in the corner. I walked over to it and tried the drawers. Both were locked. I was about to leave, when I noticed something on the floor. A scrap of 16mm film.

Now we were talking.

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

If you couldn’t guess that I owned a 16mm projector that I’d brought with me, you haven’t been paying attention. The film scrap was too short, however, so I had to sandwich it between two lengths of blank, white film called leader. I hung a bedsheet up on the wall as a screen, fed the film into my projector, and turned it on.

The white leader unspooled for a while, then all of a sudden, there was a brief, grainy, black-and-white shot of a man I recognized from the framed photo on the coffee table: Dr. Anson Woodley, Grandpa’s late partner. Woodley stood behind a desk, addressing the camera. He spoke one sentence, or a fragment of a sentence.

“Furthermore, the Regeneration Project will demonstrate that what we've traditionally ascribed to myth and legend has a basis in scientific fact.”

I immediately rewound the film and played the clip again. There was something odd about the image that I couldn’t put my finger on. I rewound the clip a second time.

Just then, Grandpa appeared at the doorway. “Look what I’ve got.” He produced a very wet and very dead rabbit. “Supper!” He made the rabbit’s head move, as if it was talking. “What's up, Doc?”

Woodley appeared on the screen again. “Furthermore, the Regeneration Project will demonstrate that what we've traditionally ascribed to myth and legend has a basis in scientific fact.”

Grandpa stared at the screen, then at me. “What are you doing?” he demanded. “Where did you find that?”

“Behind my desk,” I lied. “Grandpa. What the hell is the Regeneration Project?”

Grandpa sighed. His shoulders slumped in defeat. “Looks like I'm gonna have to tell you a few things, huh?”

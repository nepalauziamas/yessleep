  Many years ago, I sold my son’s soul to the devil. 

Plenty of dreadful things have happened, or rather, he has caused to happen since then, but this is not his story. 

This is my story, of how I made that deal. I feel if you know why I did it, you will understand and forgive me. 

It all started on a Saturday night, and like many evil things, it was prompted by teenage stupidity. It was a cold winter evening, and my son had gone out, leaving me to my own devices since earlier that day. Being a single mom and lone parent for most of his life, I didn’t have much of a life outside him, and my days mostly revolved his comings and goings. I was waiting for him to come home to have supper together, and maybe watch the latest episode of Breaking Bad with him- I watched that terrible show about terrible men doing terrible things to bond better with him and have something to talk about.

My mobile dinged. 

*Mom I got invited to Bailey’s party pls pls I wanna go*

I smiled bitterly at the text. Another long lonely Saturday evening for me. There was no point in refusing him- even if I had the heart to refuse my boy anything, he would probably just sneak off anyway.

*-Ok picking u up 11:30 no drinking drugs!*

\-*Tks mom luv u*

\-*I love u too*

I texted back pointlessly. My last text remained unread. I leaned back in the couch and thought hopelessly about watching or eating something by myself. 

The simple fact was I hated being alone in the evenings -old fears and memories and paranoias came flooding back. The creaks of the pipes and walls were magnified, and I became uneasy and restless. I remember thing I should probably look at my old dating profile but I felt too hopeless to even start. 

That night, it seemed as if the creaks were louder than ever. I found myself staring at the wall, which actually appeared to be shaking. Was there an earthquake? My fanciful fears gave way to sharp stabbing pangs of horror as the walls of my living room seemed to shimmer and open up. 

A long skinny black-clad leg appeared to step out, and in a split a second, a man with a Cheshire cat smile and blank eyes stood before me. “Hello Samira”. 

I can remember his shining teeth and sharp mouth as clearly as if his face was before me right now. 

The wall stopped heaving.

I stared at him, unable to speak. Fear had paralysed me. 

“I’ve come to take you.”

I shook my head.

He stretched out his hand. “Come along my dear. It won’t be as bad as you fear.”

I found my tongue. “No!” I gasped. “Please. I have to be here- for my son. I’m all he has- he’s only sixteen. I have to care for him!”

“Oh, you silly poor woman. Why do you think I’m here?”

I refused to believe. I couldn’t- he couldn’t have. 

“Sad but true my dear. He sold your soul for a party invite. Anyway, you shouldn’t worry. Lily here will take of him.” He snapped his fingers, and woman figure with a demon face flickered into visibility. Flames licked around her face, and her eyes glared yellow and fierce. My fear of this being was far sharper, for some reason, than of her master with his blank eyes. 

“Lily you stupid cunt, your face!” he snapped. Lily flickered again, and suddenly I was staring at my lookalike- a perfect replica of myself, down to the last perfect detail of my mom’s old necklace around the neck and the smudged faded eyeliner of the day. My already-intense fear became stained with creeped-out weirdness and I felt like throwing up. 

“See? Lily can take perfect care of him.” Lily-Samira grinned, showing sharp glowing white teeth.

I was desperate. I couldn’t leave my son alone with this hell-creature.

“Please no- I’ll make a deal with you! A better deal! Tell me what you’d like” I begged.

He raised his eyebrows high and his cat grin grew even wider, the edges of his lips extending beyond his face. “Oh my goodness, how delicious. Let me see. Actually I know exactly what I want. You realise, the sad truth is even in hell, men’s souls are valued more than yours, especially a fresh young man such as your delectable son. And especially compared to that of a jaded old hag, if you’ll pardon me for pointing out the obvious, such as yourself. So, his soul for yours?”

I paused. Lily growled softly- an odd sound coming from my lips.

“She- she will leave?”

He threw his head back and roared with laughter. “Lily you are so unwanted, my poor bitch! Why does no one want you around?” He snapped his fingers and my doppelganger vanished. “There you go. No Lily. Just you and your precious son- but his soul is mine.”

I nodded wordlessly.

“Excellent my dear! Well, I’ll leave you to enjoy the rest of your Saturday evening- I heard there is an excellent party at Bailey’s place and I might pop in.” There was a long pause. 

I stared at the demonic being.

“Is it that? Don’t I need to sign something?” 

“What! Somebody has been watching too much Supernatural! No my dear, you word is good enough for me, paper and pen are so last century.” He pushed his face forward to mine, and I saw the tiny pinpoints of fire dancing in the blank eyes. I shrank back. 

“It’s not like you can get out of it anyway”. He turned and stepped back into the wavy wall. 

I was alone. I was sweating and breathing hard. I collapsed backward into the couch.

I have never seen him again.  

Now, you now understand why I couldn’t leave him with Lily. Now that you know how it happened, you see I had no other choice. I know he has done terrible things, but it’s really not his fault, and I have been with him, protecting him every step of the way.

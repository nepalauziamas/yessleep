So this all started about a week ago. I found a dingy old painting behind my residential building and i have always been into classical art but this one seemed cool because it had a spin on it. Like a realism thing of a rabbit mask set onto a table with a candlelight shining on it.

First day when i woke up i remember this musty smell coming from my room which wasnt usually there. The second day there was actual mould around the painting which i tried to clean with some acid and other cleaning supplies but it made it worse i guess? Because the next day the mould patch was even bigger. I kept trying to clean it up but it just came back worse every time.

I tried to show it to a friend from college but when she came to my room she didn't see any mould or notice any musty smell, but she did say she liked the painting.

For some reason i can't remember the dreams of the past few days but i do remember that i knew what happened in my dreams before today. I even tried throwing the painting away but it just showed up on the wall again after i woke up. So i wanted to start writing in a journal to remember what happends since i think it is messing with my memories

Last night in my dream i found myself stumbling across a forrest. It was pitch black and i couldn't see two feet in front of me. I recall the same musty smell that was in my room. I walked around the woods for what seemeed like hours before i bumped into an old cabin. I went inside and found a torch and some notes.

What really weirded me out was that it was my handwriting. "Do not open the door" and "Please ignore the scraping sounds". the moment i finished reading the last part i heard it. The scraping was so loud that i felt it in my bones and organs. Then i saw two piercing yellow eyes peering at me through the window staring daggers into me.

I heard 3 knocks at the door. It didnt appear to want to try opening the door so i tried to make myself as quiet as possible and i put out my torch untill i heard whatever that was walking away. I lit my torch back up and noticed a small basement hatch.

As soon as i opened the hatch the most nauseating smell of putrefaction hit my nostrils. As i was not going outside wherever that, Thing, was, against my better judgment i went down the ladder and looked around.

I found myself. With my guts splayed open on the ground.

I woke up and The mould has completely covered the wall where the painting is hanged.

I don't even know what to do anymore. I havent gotten hurt in real life yet and the mould doesnt seem to be a health hazard. How should i proceed?

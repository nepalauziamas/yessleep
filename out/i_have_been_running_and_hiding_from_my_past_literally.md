i have been running from my past, literally.
my mother died in a plane crash a few years back, i think. why i say this? youll see. she was on a flight out to england (from australia) when her plane crashed intoa forest. there were 2 survivors of the crash which was the 2nd pilot and one of the flight attendants. this crash happened around a year back. everyday had been hard without her but in the past few months ive been coping better. for some closure me and my father visited the same area where the plane crash was. we imagined what life would be like if she survived, we heard some rustling in the bushes and thought nothing of it be thats normal in a fucking forest. then i get a text from my mother. what the fuck, i am thinking. her number is supposed to be disabled but i still have her contact saved. i brush it off thinking someone is using that number now and just typed in the wrong number, i dont open the message, my dad later checks my phone for the time and sees
the notification that i didnt open. text from mum. "What the fuck?" he says "open it" silent i open the message
"hi bee," that was a nickname my mum used when i was little.

Someone steps out if the bushes and says "hi bee."
HOLY FUCKING SHIT DAD R U SEEING THIS?
my dad is nowhere to be seen, i turn over to mum and see him gagged and tied to a tree.
"bee, im sorry" Mum pulls out a knife anf starts chasing
me. thats how im here, running from my past.
I start running as fast as i can with mum tailing behind me with a knife.
I never thought this day would happen, how is my dead mum chasing me with a knife.
She catches up to me and pins me down to a tree, she drops the knife to the ground. 
“Im sorry bee” she says, 
“This answers nothing, where have you been all these years?”
She chokes me until i pass out. I wake up in an unknown underground mining tunnel sitting in the centre of what looks to be a pentagram carved into the rocky dirt floor. Tied up surrounded by dimly lit candles my mother and a group of people approach me speaking a foriegn language. They walk away and i move closer to the candles to melt and burn the ropes off my hands to try and escape and call for help. It works. I get up and run through the tunnels of the mineshaft until i find a room full of bodies, i have an idea, i sit in the corner of the room to disguise myself, i can find help and if i hear someone approaching ill turn my face and disguise myself amongst the bodies. Down the halls i hear them speaking english, 
“he’s gone”
“Oh no we have to catch him”
I think to myself, if they have the option to speak another language without me listening to what theyre saying why dont they? Did they expect me to do this? Will they find me? My mum knew me better than anyone and i wouldnt be surprised if she predicted me to do this. help.

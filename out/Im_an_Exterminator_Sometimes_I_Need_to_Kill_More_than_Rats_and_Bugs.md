It takes a special kind of person to become an exterminator.  

I was reminded of this again as I stared into the pitch-black basement tunnel, dusty cobwebs hanging down from the ceiling.  The darkness was so thick I could taste it - or maybe that was the asbestos.  

Typically the asylum maintenance people took care of pest control for the old mental hospital on their own.  It was unusual for them to call in outside help.  This problem must have been beyond their abilities, I thought to myself.  

“They’ve been coming from down that way.  The big ones are almost the size of cats.  I've never seen anything like it.”

The young, pimple-faced security guard was just exaggerating, I thought.  Probably, anyways.  

“I’m gonna need you to come down there with me.  I don't have a key for the doors.”

“Nuh uh.  I'm not going in there.  Not with all those rats runnin’ round.”

“You don’t have a choice.  I need to get inside.  You’re the security guard.  You want me to tell your boss that you’re refusing to do your job?”

“Guy, I get paid eight dollars an hour,” he said, pulling a key off the big ring he had attached to his belt.  “Here’s the grand master key.  Give it back to me when you're done.  I'll be upstairs in the office.”

“Thanks a lot.”

He walked off, ignoring my sarcasm and leaving me alone in the dark, mildew-stinking basement.  

I turned on my flashlight and began to venture down the ancient corridor.  Pushing my way past the curtains of cobwebs, I walked deeper and deeper into the darkness, the smell getting worse with each step.  

What was that stench, I wondered.  

Spiders were soon crawling on my skin and in my hair, up my sleeves and down my back.  I tried to contain my terror and brushed them off of me as best as I could, but there were always more.  Soon I felt them biting me beneath my clothes as I invaded deeper and deeper into their territory.  

The spiders were so distracting that I didn’t even notice at first when the rats started swarming past.  Just a couple at the start, then a half dozen at a time, until soon they were moving around me in a fleshy, hairy herd.  The warmth of them radiated from the floor and I moved as quickly as I could through the swelling midst of them.  There were hundreds, perhaps thousands of rats.  I’d never seen so many in one place.

The door up ahead was locked with a thick steel chain and a padlock from a century ago, but that wasn’t stopping the rats.  In the glow of my flashlight I saw them moving through a hole they had made in the baseboards, after chewing through it like acid.  They streamed through this gap like flowing water.    

With shaking hands I pulled out the key which I had tucked into my front pocket.  I inserted it into the lock and turned it with an effort.  The lock was rusted to the point of almost being seized.  After a great deal of jiggling and desperate pounding against the door with my shoulder, it creaked open.  

Inside was another long corridor, stretching off into the darkness.  Rats were squeaking and fighting amongst themselves, running around on the floor, and I saw that the security guard had been telling the truth - some of them were the size of small cats.  I just hoped they weren’t hungry enough to take a bite of me.  

This hallway stretched mind-bendingly off into the far distance.  I couldn’t believe how big this place was.  The old mental hospital had been built nearly two hundred years prior, and it was massive.  It was also rumored to be haunted, but I had more tangible things to worry about than ghosts at that moment.  

The rats were a constant presence as I forced myself to go deeper into the darkness.  A large part of me wanted to go back, to say this was too much for me, but another part said no, this was my job and it was up to me to get this done.  I could only imagine the Yelp! reviews and what they would say about an exterminator too scared of rats to exterminate them.    

But the smell…  The smell was almost too much to bear as I trudged closer and closer to the unknown source of it.  Something told me if I could find the source of that smell, I’d find what was causing the rat problem.  I anticipated a leak leading into the municipal sewer system, but I never expected what I ended up discovering.  

There was a small gap in the left side of the tunnel up ahead, I noticed.  And the rats were pouring out of this space and into the larger corridor where I was standing.  I tried to push against the side of the gap and found it slid open further.  It was a secret doorway!  

The sliding door was covered in textured paint which made it match the walls around it exactly.  I pushed it open and stepped inside.  

Rats were nearly up to my knees at this point, many of them climbing on top of one another.  I used my flashlight to bat them off of me as some tried to crawl up my legs, one getting almost to my neck.  I tried to stop myself from panicking but I could feel my heart pounding and I was beginning to wonder what the hell I had been thinking going down there alone.  

The tunnel led downwards, heading deeper and deeper below ground.  It appeared to be crude and dug by hand, without using sophisticated equipment.  There was no lighting, and the ground was filled with potholes and ruts which I repeatedly tripped over.  I imagined falling face-down in the midst of all those rats and squirmed at the thought.  

Eventually, after several long minutes of descending deeper and deeper downwards, the space opened up before me and I saw I was in a large hidden cave system beneath the hospital.  I braced myself as I followed the trail of rats and saw a cluster of them in the darkness up ahead.  

With stilted steps I went forward to examine the source of the asylum’s rat problem.  I couldn’t help but wonder if the management of the hospital knew about this underground cave system beneath the place, or if it was a secret even to them.  But one thing was for sure - somebody had made this secret tunnel leading down to this cavern.  And the person using the hidden passage these days was doing so with some terrible purposes in mind.  

As I drew closer to the horde of rats, the terrible smell I had noticed earlier began to grow stronger, to the point of being almost unbearable.  I pulled my shirt up over my face and shone the flashlight beam towards the source of that horrible odor.  

There was a pit with at least a dozen dead bodies in it, each of them in varying states of decomposition.  The rats were crawling over the faces of men and women, eating their skin and pulling off scraps of flesh from their necks and ears, lips and eyelids.  The eyeballs were already missing from each of the bodies, as if those were the choicest morsels and the rats had decided to eat them first.  

With growing concern, I saw a few of them were wearing serviceman uniforms - plumbers, electricians, carpenters, and more than one exterminator.  

I spun around just as the familiar security guard was sneaking up behind me with a hammer.  He swung it hard at my face, but he wasn’t anticipating my quick response.  

Dodging out of the way, I saw his eyes were full of rage, focused intently on me.  He looked savage and angry as he took a swing at me with his hammer, then another, and another, each time just barely missing as I ducked out of the way.  He grazed me once on the shoulder, though, nearly crippling me despite the fleeting impact.  

The kid was young and he was quick, but he was filled with anger, and it was making him sloppy and careless.  Each time he missed, I could see his outrage growing, his face getting redder, his eyes more and more manic.  And with that came a slipshod lack of focus as he fell further and further away with each strike.

I realized I only had one chance to fight back, since I was without a weapon.  My mind formulated a plan as I circled back around towards the pit filled with dead bodies.  

With my back to it, I slowed down, acting tired.  Then, as he came at me, I pretended to be surprised at having backed myself into a corner.  He attacked and at the very last second I dodged away, kicking him in the back as he went off balance.  His eyes went wide with surprise, having missed wildly with his attack.  

The security guard who had lured me down there went flying into the pit of rats and dead bodies, spinning and turning in the air as he landed so that he was looking up at me.  A moment later, the vermin swarmed him.  It was like piranhas smelling blood in the water - as soon as they saw the fresh meat they began to feast on his flesh as he screamed.

I slowly backed away, watching carefully to make sure he didn’t chase after me, but within a few moments the screams began to turn into bubbling gurgles and a wheezing death rattle.  Soon after that I heard nothing at all, and it was silent except for the sounds of rats eating the man as I retreated back the way I’d entered.  

The rats were swarming back towards the caverns, I saw with pleasant surprise as I made my way up towards the entrance of the caves.

Finally back in the basement, I stood watching as the rats’ numbers began to thin, their masses returning to their home in the cave system after smelling the fresh meat.

After the last ones had gone back through the secret door, I closed it shut and heard it lock securely in place.  The hidden tunnel was once again disguised to blend in perfectly with the basement wall, tucked away in the derelict hallway that no one ever visits anymore.  

Not only that, but I had solved the rat problem.

Like I said before, it takes a special kind of person to be an exterminator.  It’s not for everyone.  And some people just don’t have what it [takes.](https://www.reddit.com/r/JGcreepypastas/comments/raq7ay/all_stories_20212022/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share)

I knew there was no way that I could have seen him, but I could swear I saw my old dog, Blue, standing by the fence of Sanders Farm.

&#x200B;

I work out of town, the town I grew up in is pretty tiny, and I have to pass Sanders Farm anytime I come home from work. Sanders Farm has been a landmark since before I was born, and it grows most of the produce for the town. Hershal Sanders runs a very successful produce stand in town and sells crops to grocery stores all over the state. He's a bit of a local celebrity. He seems to be the only person in town doing well for himself besides Cotton's Antiques.

&#x200B;

He also owned the farm my parents were supposed to have dropped Blue off at when I was a kid.

&#x200B;

Blue had been a good dog, a great companion for a kid my age, but maybe a little too rambunctious for my parents liking. He had been a mutt with pointed ears, a thick coat of soft brown fur, and a pair of inquisitive green eyes that never seemed to get tired of darting around for something to chase or catch. I had loved him, but for two adults in a small house, we lived in an apartment at the time, it must have been a nightmare.

&#x200B;

The day he bitt Tommy was probably one of the worst I remember, so it was indelibly etched into my memory.

&#x200B;

Tommy was a lot older than my friends or me. He was twelve, and we all lived in fear of him. Whenever he strode onto the little playground, five foot eight and broad through the chest, we all usually left to go play at someone's house. Unfortunately, on that day, I was playing alone on the basketball court and didn't have time to escape. I'd been practicing shooting baskets. Next year, I wanted to join the elementary school basketball group, so I wanted to get good when Tommy came striding up. Blue was panting about good-naturedly but looked up when he was Tommy coming. He was always alone, never having any chums to pal around with, which should have been a red flag for any adult watching.

&#x200B;

Even the most brutal of children have someone to pal around with, but Tommy was too anti-social and stupid mean for even the other bullies to accept. 

&#x200B;

"Whatcha doin, sissy?" He asked, dragging out one of the limited insults he reserved for the "sissies" of "babies."

I told him I was shooting baskets and he just sneered like that was the silliest thing he'd ever heard.

&#x200B;

"That's not how you get better, stupid. Why don't you play me one on one? That'll get you better quicker."

&#x200B;

I agreed, thinking maybe he had decided to be a little friendlier.

&#x200B;

Nothing could've been further from the truth.

&#x200B;

The game started out with him taking the ball from me and scoring point after point. I was smaller than him, so it was easy for him to steal the ball from me and rack up points while I stumbled around it. After a little while, I started developing some strategies to get around him, and I started making some points of my own. Before I knew it, we were nearly tied, and this was unacceptable to Tommy. The game had been dirty before, but now it was downright brutal.

&#x200B;

The first time he pushed me, I heard Blue growling warning.

&#x200B;

The second time he pushed me, I heard Blue snarl at him.

&#x200B;

On the third time, his fist coming out to crack me in the side of the head, I heard him yell as Blue sank his teeth into Tommy's backside.

&#x200B;

Tommy cried out, Telling me to get my dog off of him. I was shocked. I had never seen Blue bite anyone. He hung onto the back of his pants, worrying at him, as Tommy ran off the blacktop towards his house. He let him go as his sneakers left the court, and I laughed about it then, Blue grinning as he came back to rub against my hand.

&#x200B;

When the police arrived at my house later that day, I didn't think it was so funny.

&#x200B;

They told us that Tommy's parents had reported a dog bite. Specifically, they had reported that Blue had bitten their son, and now the police had come to take him away. I told them my side of the story, all the while clutching Blue around the neck, but it didn't seem to make a difference to them. A dog had bit, and now he had to be put down. I think dad saw that I was getting really upset because he agreed to take Blue to the police station and said he wouldn't let them put him to sleep unless I got to say goodbye. This soothed me a little, but I was still pretty upset as I watched my dog walk away for the last time.

&#x200B;

It was already nighttime when dad came back, but he seemed a little happier. He told me that he had come to an understanding with the police officers, and they had let him drop Blue off at Sanders Farm. Dad said that Mr. Sanders usually took in trouble dogs, or dogs that were going to be put down, and let them work as farm dogs. That way, Blue could live there, and he wouldn't have to be put to sleep.

&#x200B;

"He'll have all kinds of room to run around, much more room than this little apartment, and he'll be happy."

&#x200B;

I was ecstatic. I was sad that Blue couldn't live with us anymore, but at least the police wouldn't have to put him to sleep. I asked dad if we could go visit him some time to see how he was doing, and dad said we would see. I went to bed that night and dreamed about Blue as he ran and ran on the farm, herding sheep and running off crows and enjoying his life now that he had a lot of space to play in.

&#x200B;

I asked dad a few more times if we could go see Blue, but it never seemed to be a good time. Dad always said things like that we didn't want to distract him while he was at work, or we didn't want to make it hard for him to settle in by reminding him of his old family. I understood these things, they made sense, but I really wanted to see Blue again. I remember asking a handful of times, but my attention span was pretty limited like most kids. I got a new game console that year for Christmas. I had made the basketball team, so I had practice almost every day. I was getting ready to go to middle school and was a little worried about that. After a while, I just sort of forgot about Blue. I never really forgot about him. I still thought about him sometimes, vaguely, but I just stopped asking to go see him. Eventually, I stopped thinking about him.

&#x200B;

When I saw him in the field, I hadn't honestly thought about Blue in years.

&#x200B;

I was heading to dinner with my parents after work, so I figured I would let them know what I had seen.

&#x200B;

They might like knowing that Blue was okay and that he was still living a good life.

&#x200B;

Mom opened the door for me when I knocked and invited me to help finish fixing dinner. As I chopped vegetables for a salad, I told her what I had seen. She didn't seem to understand. The chunk of the knife seemed soothing to me as I cut vegetables, and I told her that I had seen Blue running around the farm where we had left him. She still seemed a little confused, not really understanding what I was talking about, and when dad came in, I told him as well.

&#x200B;

Dad didn't seem confused at all.

&#x200B;

Quite the contrary, he looked a little scared.

&#x200B;

"You saw Blue in Sanders Field? "

&#x200B;

"Yeah, just where you said you dropped him off. He looked really happy. He was just running around, chasing birds and living his best life. He looked up when I drove past and almost seemed to recognize me. I thought that I might go out there and visit him, see if he still…."

&#x200B;

"Kid, "Dad said, cutting me off, "that's impossible. "

&#x200B;

"I guess you're right," I said, thinking it over as I talked about it, "Blue would have to be something like 20 years old by now. Maybe it's one of his puppies; it looks just like him. I might stop by anyway, see if maybe Mr. Sanders will sell me one of his puppies. It would be nice to have a reminder around the apartment of old Blue."

&#x200B;

My dad sat down heavily, which made me look over at him with real worry. He seemed like he was debating something or maybe having difficulty accepting something. I was worried that he might've had a heart attack for a minute. He had one last year, and his heart hadn't exactly been stable after that.

&#x200B;

Instead, he just looked up at me like he might've seen a ghost or something.

&#x200B;

"That's not possible because Blue is dead. "

&#x200B;

I looked at him in shock, "How do you know? Did Mr. Sanders tell you when he…"

&#x200B;

"He didn't have to. Blue died the night I took him to the police station. We put him down. "

&#x200B;

My head spun a little. Had he been lying to me the whole time? Dad had told me he had taken Blue to the farm. He had stuck by it until I eventually forgot. Had he just been telling me a lie to stop me from being upset? Why had he told me he was taking Blue to the farm at all?

&#x200B;

"Sit down. I think it's time I tell you the truth. It's the truth you may have to face yourself one day, so it's best you hear it now. "

&#x200B;

I sat down, keeping a close eye on my old man, who suddenly seemed less trustworthy than he had a few minutes ago.

&#x200B;

"People in this town always say that they're taking their dogs to the farm. It's been a tradition for at least as long as I can remember. My own dad told me that he was taking my dog, Scout, to Sanders farm when he got too old and sick. He said that Scout could run and play there for as long as he wanted, and the country air would do him some good. My daddy had never lied to me before, at least not that I knew of, and I was happy that Scout could live somewhere where he could get better. He was old and very sick, and I wasn't quite ready to lose him yet. Daddy said that we could visit him, but we never did. Eventually, just like you, I kind of forgot about him and went on with my life."

&#x200B;

I sat in silence, not sure what to make of all this. So grandad had lied as well, but this seemed to be a generational lie. Why did so many people use Sanders Farm as a place to leave their dogs? Was it a convenient lie, or was there more to it?

&#x200B;

"Why did you lie to me?" I asked, still not happy about being misled.

&#x200B;

"Because I knew that Blue was going to be killed, and I knew that you weren't ready to lose him. Taking him to the farm was just something people tell kids around here. I'd imagine that you have lots of friends who've had their dogs taken to Sanders Farm over the years."

&#x200B;

"But why? What's the point of it?"

&#x200B;

Dad seemed to think about this, weighing his options, before settling on, "You'll understand when you're older; when you have kids of your own. Sanders Farm is an important place in this community for many reasons, some of them not quite known even to the people who use it."

&#x200B;

I didn't end up staying for dinner. 

&#x200B;

I left, despite my mother's protests, and drove home. 

&#x200B;

I don't know why, but I was just so irrationally mad about being lied to. I realized, of course, that my parents had lied like this before. I'd lived with the Easter Bunny, the Tooth Fairy, Santa Clause, and even a monster that lived in the basement named Mr. Jiles, who would get you if you came downstairs after bedtime. These all turned out to be fake, of course. They were lies they told, but they were told gently and only to add magic to my childhood or keep me from doing foolish things. I could understand those lies, but not this one. This one felt different.

&#x200B;

This one felt personal.

&#x200B;

I flopped onto the couch when I came home, and John paused his game as he glanced over at me.

&#x200B;

"What's wrong, babe? You look upset."

&#x200B;

"It's nothing." I lied, looking away, before finally spilling the whole sad story. I was in tears by the end, my boyfriend holding my hand and patting me gently. He'd grown up here too and had known my parents only slightly less time than I had. He often gave me some perspective on what was going on and was my voice of reason in many things. 

&#x200B;

"I'm sure your dad had a good reason. He's a good man, and I don't feel like he would lie to you for no reason. He probably just wanted to protect you; you were like eight, after all."

&#x200B;

He slid his thumbs over the backs of my hands like I liked, and I smiled as I bent forward to kiss his forehead. 

&#x200B;

"Thanks, hun. You always know just what to say."

&#x200B;

John grinned through his beard and reached for his controller again, boyfriendly duties now complete.

&#x200B;

"'Sides, it's not all that weird if you think about it."

&#x200B;

I cocked an eye at him, "What do you mean?" 

&#x200B;

"Well, that's where my dad took Russel after he got hit by a car. He told me he took him to Mr. Sanders Farm so he could get better, but I guess he never did."

&#x200B;

That gave me pause. John had basically told me the same story my dad had, and it was a little too similar to be a coincidence. As John went back to rolling and smashing anything that wandered into his field of vision, I opened up my phone and sent a text to my friend Matt. Matt and I had been friends nearly as long as John and I, and I trusted him as much as I trusted my boyfriend.

&#x200B;

"Hey Matt, just wondering if you've ever heard your parents say they were taking one of your pets to Sanders Farm? Just curious, trying to settle a bet."

&#x200B;

The last bit would really hook him; he seemed to like making John look dumb by proving him wrong.

&#x200B;

I watched John play Elden Ring for a few minutes before my phone buzzed, and I picked it up to see his reply.

&#x200B;

"Wow, that's weird. Ya, my dad took Snoopy there after he got too old to walk. I haven't thought of that in forever. That's trippy."  

&#x200B;

I thanked him and sent a text to Jane, a friend from work. Jane lived in the next town over, but Khine was still only about twenty miles from my hometown. I was wondering if this was just a regional thing or if it extended farther than our little burg.

&#x200B;

Janet sent back a string of question marks and asked why I would need to know something so weird?

&#x200B;

I told her that it was to settle a bet too, and she told me she'd never had a dog get taken to Sanders Farm.

&#x200B;

"We always just buried them in the backyard."

&#x200B;

Okay, so maybe it wasn't particularly far-reaching.

&#x200B;

For the next few hours, as John cursed and growled at the maddening boss he was trying to beat, I sent text after Facebook message after Twitter message and everything in between to old school friends and people I knew from town to ask them if they'd lost dogs too. John's story about Russel had made me realize this was bigger than just my family, and I wanted to know how far exactly. 

&#x200B;

Of the ten people I got responses from, six said their parents had told them they were taking a dog to Sanders Farm. One friend only had cats growing up, and it appeared that they didn't get to go live happily with Farmer Sanders. The other two had never been allowed to have pets, so they never had anything to lose. The one person whose dog hadn't gone to Sander's Farm had escaped while the family was on vacation, so the dog's whereabouts were never discovered. 

&#x200B;

The findings weren't conclusive, but they were pretty damn close.

&#x200B;

Close enough that as John and I climbed into bed that night, I had already decided that I was going to make a stop on the way home from work tomorrow.

&#x200B;

The plume of dirt that spewed up behind me as I drove up the long driveway to Sander Farm was the only bell the old farmer seemed to need.

&#x200B;

He was waiting for me on the porch with a glass of tea, and a weathered old smile spread across his sunburnt face.

&#x200B;

"Afternoon, kid. What can I do for you?"

&#x200B;

We shook hands as I introduced myself, and he handed me the glass of tea as I explained why I was there.

&#x200B;

Mr. Sanders nodded, asking if I'd like to come inside. He didn't seem surprised by the question at all. Quite the contrary, it was as if he'd been waiting for me to come and ask it all this time. I told him that I thought I'd rather sit on the porch and discuss it, and he nodded as he took a seat in one of the old rockers, indicating that I should take the other.

&#x200B;

"Every now and then, someone puts two and two together and realizes that everyone brings their dog to Sanders Farm. It's not a new concept. People have been doing it since before the Great Depression. I can't tell you how long it's been going on, but I can tell you how it started if you'd like to hear."

&#x200B;

I nodded, and he began his story.

&#x200B;

"The first dog to be brought here wasn't really brought at all. His name was Gip, and he was my friend. He was just a pup when I heard him crying one afternoon. He'd gotten himself stuck in a trap, and his pack had deserted him, probably thinking he was done for. He was just a little half-starved thing, but he growled at me as I came to get him loose. Turned out I didn't have to do too much. The trap had nearly taken his front paw off, and he was bleeding out. It seemed a shame to let him die, so I held him down and tied his foot off with a handkerchief. He struggled a lot, snapping and snarling as I tried to stop the bleeding, but eventually, he quieted down as the blood oozed out of him, and he became less coherent. I scooped him up and took him back home, cutting the little bit of skin that held his paw on and dressing it as best I could."

&#x200B;

"I was afraid he had died for a little while, but when I heard him come to with a snarl and snuffly howl, I knew he'd likely recover."

&#x200B;

He smiled as he remembered it, likely thinking of the little wolf pup as he tried to act twice his size. 

&#x200B;

"We started out slowly, but eventually, I earned his trust. His paw would never grow back, but he managed to teach himself to walk with three legs. I had done a good enough job of cleaning it up that it didn't get infected, and after a few months, the lack of a paw didn't slow him down. He couldn't return to his pack. I'm not sure if he ever tried. Gip was my dog, though, and I loved him."

&#x200B;

His smile became sad, and I felt we were about to come to the part of the story where he lost that friend.

&#x200B;

"We lived together for about twelve years, both of us growing old as the seasons passed. Gip's gate was slower, and his joints creaked when he walked, but he was still always willing to walk with me while I did my work. It was a good thing he did too, or I wouldn't be here to tell this tale today.

&#x200B;

 I was in my late forties when we stumbled upon a bear one day. He had decided to bed down in my corn crib, and when I went down to check my stores, he woke up and charged me. Gip got between us. He was never far from my side and gave me time to get my rifle. I put the bear down as the three-legged wolf kept him from attacking me, but the damage was done. Gip had been slashed a dozen times, and I sat with him as he lay bleeding on the dirt floor of my storehouse."

&#x200B;

Mr. Sanders got a far-off look as he watched the sun sink, seeing far-off days as the sunset over his crops.

&#x200B;

"I buried him in the field, the place he loved the most. I had built him a house, put him a ratty blanket on the porch, but he seemed to love sleeping amongst the swaying corn plants and amidst the dirt of the field. I buried him there, thinking that he might nourish the crops as his spirit lay content, but I could never have foreseen what would happen."

&#x200B;

"I heard a loud barking that night, a barking that sounded like Gips. I rushed out with my rifle and found him smiling and barking at the edge of the field, good as new. Behind him, though, the crops had grown four times as plentiful. Corn, beans, squash, potatoes, and everything else I grew in those days had sprung up overnight, flabbergasted. Gip looked at me as though to say, "Thanks for a good life," and then he dove back into the field, and I never saw him again. That was how it started."

&#x200B;

"What started?" I asked, feeling my skin prickle.

&#x200B;

"The crops came in, and I brought my wares to the nearest market. I made enough money to build a new barn, buy a new horse, and eat like a king that winter. There had been enough food to stuff my storehouse, and the excess I'd taken to market was more like a normal yield from any other year. The next year I planted as I had every year, and old Gip brought in another bountiful harvest. I bought more land, made plans to plant my orchard, and began to think about buying cattle and sheep. I even thought about becoming some kind of land baron in this underdeveloped part of the country. The next two years were just as fine, but I was in for a surprise."

&#x200B;

He coughed a little and asked me if I'd go get him a glass of tea from the kitchen. I obliged, moving into the house and taking a glass from the cabinet as I moved to the battered old fridge. I refilled my own as I poured the cold tea into the new glass. I was suddenly very thirsty, and my throat felt dry as a bone.

When I brought it back to him, he thanked me before taking a long sip.

&#x200B;

"After four years of amazing yields, the fifth year was a disappointment. The crops did well, as well as they ever had before Gip died, but the bounty was nowhere to be seen. I had just begun planting my fruit trees and just started making inquiries about livestock. I worried that I wouldn't be able to afford any of the plans I'd been making and that the temporary success might just slip through my fingers. The next year was much the same, but I had noticed a small decline in the quality of my produce. There had been no blight, no insects to speak of, but the crops seemed weaker, more feeble this year. I began to panic. What would I do if the fields stopped making? What could I do if the vegetables stopped coming? I tried different things that spring to rejuvenate the fields. I bought tonics from a traveling man, put down fertilizer, and tried increasing the water I gave to the fields. The fertilizing, however, had made me remember that I had used something very different to fertilize the land four years ago. It made me wonder if doing so again might revitalize the fields again."

&#x200B;

The sun was sinking lower now, the firey ring just over the tops of the corn as they waved merrily.

&#x200B;

"And so I set out to find a proper sacrifice for the land, something to bring it back again. I tried forest animals first. Gip had been of the forest, after all, but to no avail. I tried strays from the nearby town, but they did nothing. In my desperation, I'm ashamed to say that I bought and killed animals from the local stable man, even going so far as to buy and slaughter a horse, but they did little to rejuvenate my crops. Then, one evening, as I came home from the market with my pathetic yield, I nearly struck a child as he came bounding into the road. The dog with him, just an average mutt, pushed him out of the way, and as my tires crunched over the loyal hound. I heard the boy cry out in despair, cradling the dying dog in his arms, its back clearly broken. I wasted no time, though. I took the dog from him, driving away quickly as the father came rushing out to see what all the fuss was about."

&#x200B;

The setting sun cut fire lines across his eyes, and the sting must have been uncomfortable, if not eye-watering.

&#x200B;

Mr. Sanders seemed not to notice.

&#x200B;

"He was dead by the time I arrived home, and I buried him in the field as I had with Gip. The crops came back, the land thrived, and I think that was when I first realized what the land wanted. The old dog had been loved, just as Gip had been loved, and that love seemed to nourish the land. From that day on, I seemed to always have my eyes peeled for dogs. The sick ones could sometimes be taken off the owner's hands, but I have been known to buy them from struggling families, as well. As the years went by and the town grew, so to did my prosperity. I was soon one of the largest farms in the region, my produce sold at every General Store and Market for miles around. I've seen the horse replaced by the automobile, seen the carts that came to get my goods replaced by trucks, and all the while, my fields continued to put out more of the crops I needed to grow. Ah, but there was a price, and the price has become quite steep over the years."

&#x200B;

I was still mulling over what he had said, and when he paused to drain the dregs from his glass, I asked the question that had been wavering on the edge of my mind.

&#x200B;

"Mr. Sanders, how old are you?"

&#x200B;

Mr. Sanders fixed me with a mischievous grin, and it took years off him.

&#x200B;

"Just starting to put it together, huh? I was born in eighteen fifteen. I bought this land in eighteen forty-five. The year I buried Gip, I was forty-five, and I have stayed that age ever since. Despite having more crops than I know what to do with, the land also grants me life for my sacrifice. I cannot explain why, and I can't explain how, but I keep living so long as the land thrives."

&#x200B;

I wanted to deny what he was saying, but I could find no argument against it. The man looked old, sun-weathered, but not ancient. How had he managed to keep from being noticed? If he had really owned this farm for so long, how had no one seen?"

&#x200B;

"As my farm grew, so too did the town. The market thrived, the people prospered, and thus began the agreement. I had grown tired of finding my own sacrifices, and so I made them a deal. They would bring me their dogs, those who were sick or those too old to carry on, and I would continue to make the town flourish. By that time, I was making a sacrifice once a month. Today, I make a sacrifice once a day. Before too much longer, I fear that it will become unmanageable, and the farm will fail."

&#x200B;

I said nothing, just sitting and staring, wishing I could believe this man was crazy.

&#x200B;

"I suppose that wouldn't be too bad. I've grown tired of living and making sacrifices, and maybe it's finally time to rest. Nothing lasts forever, after all. Not even immortality." he said, grinning.

&#x200B;

The grin made his face look skeletal, his true age shining through at last.

&#x200B;

I thanked him for the tea, thanked him for the story, and stood up shakily.

&#x200B;

"Take care of yourself, kid, and don't worry. Ole Blue is as happy as any other dog here. You did what you could for him, and now he's at rest where no one can hurt him ever again."

&#x200B;

I nodded dumbly, my legs shivering as I walked down the stairs and to my car. As I climbed in, I thought I saw a familiar brown snout as it poked from a row of corn plants. My hand froze halfway to the ignition. He was grinning at me, looking out through the corn and panting happily. It was as if he had come back one last time to say goodbye, and as we locked eyes, he slid slowly back into the field.

&#x200B;

Since then, I've driven by that farm once a day, but I've never seen Blue again.

&#x200B;

I do worry about what will happen to all those ghosts if something should happen to Sanders Farm. The crops have begun to look a little different lately, less healthy and more like plants that are rotting from the inside. If the vegetables die, if the farm fails, then what will happen to all the spirits that call the land their home?

&#x200B;

There was a sign next to the dirt road today that said: "For Sale by Owner."

&#x200B;

I suppose, soon, we may very well find out.

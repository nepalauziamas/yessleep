I grew up in Connecticut on the poor end of Hartford. Most of the people I knew in school, whether they dropped out or actually graduated, ended up stuck here, living in some shitty apartment where they could barely afford food and rent, let alone a vehicle or means to escape the city. The sense of entrapment led to existential desperation. 

I know people who aren't from the city don't really understand. They'll tell you that if you keep your nose out of trouble, work hard and save money you can escape. It sounds easy enough when you put it like that, but the reality is that it takes a little more  just the prospect of escape to mentally survive day-to-day life in a slummy neighborhood making minimum wage. 

The mental toll that it takes gnaws away at you over time. It's a bleak hellscape of trash in the streets, shitty apartments with rats and roaches, dingey lighting, broken heat, bad air conditioning, and everyone treats you like shit because of where you're from and how you dress.

I endear any of you to try living like that without succumbing to the temptation to blow your money on some dumb shit just to make life a little more tolerable. 

For some people this was collecting the latest sneakers. I never understood dropping $400 on shoes you can't even wear, but if that's your thing, you do you. 

For others it was hard drugs; crack, cocaine, heroine. Meth was making its way in, along with some of the party drugs like E. 

Personally, I found my escape in liquor and weed, and occasionally I would bum some Percocets, but I never got too carried away with opiates. That shit always scared me. I lost too many friends to ODs, and with fentanyl on the rise, I refused to touch anything that wasn't prescription grade. No home brew bullshit for me. 

I tell you this to explain what got me to the point in life where this story takes place, because you'd have to be a total fuck up to do what I did. 

I have done some bad shit. Shit that I deserve to go to jail for. Probably worse. I'm sure there's a place in hell waiting for me. 

This is the story of the day I reached my limit.

I had been working cart return at the nearby ShopRite for about 3 years since I dropped out and my mom kicked me out for smoking weed, and I was just barely getting by. My landlord hiked my rent so I had started looking for an additional source of income. I wasn't ready to cut into my weed and alcohol budget to afford food. 

After putting in some applications and asking around, my buddy Marco got me some late night, weekend shifts at one of the corner stores. 

It was sketchy, you know the kind of place, there are grates on the windows, except for the ones that are just boarded over. There was a glass divider between the cash register and the customer (And this was before the days of covid.) I was never sure if it was bulletproof, but I didn't want to find out.

I had been working pretty steady there for about 2 or 3 months when Marco came by one night and asked me how I was getting by. I was honest with him, working 7 days a week was pretty shitty and my sleep schedule was all over the place switching from nights on the weekend to working days during the week, and the extra income wasn't really making it all worth it. 

He asked me if I wanted to start making some real cash, the kind that can change your life. 

Of course, I told him yes. How could I say no to an offer like that? 

Marco picked me up after my shift at ShopRite Monday night and drove me to this apartment, out on the edge of my area, where things start to get a little nicer. We parked down one of the side streets where the street lights were burnt out, and there was a ton of trash in the road; plastic bags, broken glass, used diapers, the usual shit. 

He brought me across the rear parking lot and to the back of the building, then called inside. A few minutes went by and a guy shows up at the door and lets us in. We walked up to the fourth floor, and went to the apartment at the end of the hall. The guy with us unlocked the door and ushered us in. He hadn't said a word the entire time. 

Marco turned to me and just told me to let him do the talking. 

The inside of the apartment was pretty nice for the area. Leather couches, glass coffee table, stainless appliances, the works. There were a lot of storage bins around and one of the rooms had a padlock on it, which I thought was a bit weird. 

We were walked to the living room which had a view out back and access to the fire escape, and a guy was sitting on the couch smoking weed. He had a pretty expensive looking sweat suit on with matching sneakers, a big gold chain, bald head with a goatee. 

Another guy was sitting in a recliner, greased back, spiky black hair, stubbly face, black wife beater and oversized blue jeans tucked into Tims. He was chopping coke with a razor on the glass coffee table. 

The guy in the sweat suit didn't even look at us, just kept dragging on his blunt and blowing it up towards the ceiling. 

The guy chopping coke ignored us while he finished, hit his line and stood up. It was like something straight out of Hollywood. 

He came over to Marco and greeted him, Marco called him Angel. They bumped shoulders and Marco introduced me as his friend, told him I'm trustworthy and trying to bring home some extra cash. He told him which corner store I work at, the hours, etc. 

Angel asked me if I'd ever sold drugs. I told him no, since I didn't think selling some of my extra weed to friends would count for shit in their world. 

Angel told me he was going to give me a shot on Marco's good word, but if I fucked up or fucked them over, it was my ass that was going to get beat. I got pretty nervous at this point. He was fired up and I hadn't even done anything wrong yet. Seemed ready to beat my ass for a fuck up I hadn't even made yet. 

He turned to the guy on the couch and said, "Alex, give him the shit."

Alex got up and handed me what at the time was a shocking amount of weed to me.

Angel told me they were going to start putting the word out to clients that they could pick it up at my gas station during my shifts, and I was supposed to handle the sales.

He said they never do direct business out of the apartment because it puts too many eyes on them. 

My buddy Marco must have had it in pretty good to get me in there. I was nervous as hell, but excited to make some real cash. 

I was pretty freaked out about the whole idea at first, but Marco told me he'd been doing the same thing for years and it's all been going fine. All I had to do was keep my mouth shut and avoid any interactions with the police. He gave me some advice on how to hide it, transport it, make everything seem real casual, how to package it with other purchases to hide it from cameras, all that. 

That weekend I would have people randomly show up through the night. There was a code word, or rather a sentence, to let me know they were there to buy weed. They'd ask me if I had any sparkling water and I'd tell them we're all out of San pellegrino, but we have some other stuff. Then they would ask for a scratch ticket. I'd hide the weed under the ticket when I did the handoff. 

About halfway through the second weekend I ran out of weed and reached out to Marco to let him know.

Marco picked me up on Monday again and brought me by the guys to get some more merchandise.

I gave Angel all the money from selling the weed, and he counted to make sure I didn't try to screw them over. 

Angel explained to me that the weed was just a trust test to see if I could do the job, and they wanted to give me a chance to try pushing some real stuff. 

They set me up with some crack and acid along with some more weed. They handed me my cut of the earnings which was only $50, but they said if I keep it up I will get a bigger cut next time.

At the time, an extra $50 to just do what I had already been doing was a lot of money. It was easy and other than constantly being paranoid the police were going to show up and catch me slinging drugs, it was well worth it, especially with the hope of more money in the pipeline. 

For the next year I continually sold more and harder shit, and I started pulling in some really good money.

I ended up quitting my job at ShopRite and picking up extra nights at the corner store.

At this point I was pretty well acquainted with Alex and Angel.

Angel, in complete contradiction of his name was a total Hot Head, and I always had to walk on eggshells around him. One time I made the mistake of joking about sneaking a couple of Percocets on the job like a kid at McDonald's stealing fries and he gave me a black eye in return. 

Alex on the other hand was even scarier. He was just Stone Cold and emotionless. There is something about him where you knew if you did the wrong thing he wouldn't hesitate to have you fucked up. 

You might think my biggest fear was getting caught by the police, but it was actually the fear of fucking up and getting on Alex's bad side.

The thing is, I never actually saw Alex do anything, but he had a reputation, and there were stories. 

I don't know if it was true, but I heard a story about a guy who raised his own prices and was skimming off the top without telling them. 

When Alex caught wind, he didn't say anything. He told the dude he'd been doing a great job and he wanted to take him out to celebrate. They took the dude out, got him good and drunk, drove him to a bridge over the river, cut his Achilles tendons with a pair of branch clippers and dropped him 20 feet into the river.

I never fucked around with those guys again, it was always straight business, drugs sold, money made, pay off and discussing what my inventory will be, and pricing which fluctuated periodically. 

Somewhere along the line they got nervous and moved all their transactions out of the apartment. I'd meet up with them or some of the guys they know in spots around town to do the handoff. I started seeing Alex and Angel a whole lot less, but I was kinda glad. 

After about a year and a half, I had made some pretty good money, I picked up a car and got my driver's license.

Marco came by the gas station one night and told me the guys want to offer me a chance at something bigger. I'd really earned their trust and they needed someone who could follow directions, and drive. 

The risk would only be a little bit higher but the payoff would be huge. 

The way they explained it, all I had to do was grab a U-Haul truck and drive it to a specific location to pick up some cargo. After I got the cargo they would tell me where to go with it.

At no point was I to know what the cargo was. The truck would be locked by the people who loaded it, and only the people that received it on the other end would have the other key.

While I was pretty happy with how things had been going, and the low level of risk, they flashed some dollar signs at me that I couldn't resist. 

And beside that, there's an implication that when someone in this business offers you an opportunity, you have to take it, or there could be consequences. 

I told them it was a deal, so the next week I grabbed a U-Haul, just like they had asked, and late that night, I drove it out to the location they gave me, which turned out to be some rundown warehouse in one of the old industrial parks. A big, red brick building with lots of broken or boarded up windows and loading docks, and a fence around it. 

When I pulled around back there were a couple guys waiting for me. They guided me as I backed the truck up to a loading dock. The one on the driver's side knocked on my window and motion for me to roll it down.

Once I did, he waved a gun at me and said stay in the truck and keep my eyes forward.

I heard the door to the truck slide open, then feet stomping around inside of it. About 2 minutes went by, then the door was closed and locked.

The guy by the driver side window gave me directions on a piece of paper. He told me to take the truck to that location and burn the directions when I was done. He said when I got there it would be the same business; stay in the truck and keep my eyes forward. 

He told me not to try fucking around with the cargo unless I wanted to catch a bullet. I had no intention of finding out. 

I followed the directions and found myself pulling out of the city and onto the Berlin turnpike heading south. 

Now if you aren't from around here, you may not know about the Berlin turnpike. It might as well be a highway with traffic lights on it. Big road, people drive fast on it. It's a straight shot south of Hartford toward New Haven.

Right outside the city there's a lot of stores and restaurants, the usual stuff for suburbanites and yuppies to go blow money on. 

As you go further down, the stores and restaurants give way to motels. Dozens and dozens of motels  When I say motels, it's probably exactly what you think. Dimly lit, set back from the road on hills or behind trees. They're all run down, shady looking establishments that you couldn't pay me to sleep at.

The Berlin turnpike has a long history of being used from criminal activities and drug / human trafficking. 

At this point it wasn't a huge surprise that I was out here carrying what was probably a fuckload of coke, or maybe some guns. 

I was looking for one motel in particular as described on the paper. I was about 15 minutes down the road when I spotted it on the left and pulled in. 

Once again, there were two guys waiting outside by a car smoking. 

When I pulled up they motioned for me to back up to one of the doors. 

Once I put it in park and shut off the truck, the guys folded in my mirrors and again, I got the reminder to keep my eyes forward and stay in the truck. 

A couple minutes went by, footsteps in the back, the door closed, and they waved me off. 

I returned the U-Haul, and the next day Marco gave me a call and told me where to head for my payment. 

Five hundred for that one drop off. I couldn't believe it. I had no idea what I was carrying but it had to be pretty good for that kind of dough, and I was comped for the U-Haul cost. 

I only got called about once a month to do it, but I was making some serious extra cash off it. 

It was probably good it wasn't done too often, or it might have gotten suspicious. I rotated U-Haul locations and used some other truck rental services just to mix things up. 

Things were going great, until one day. 

It was pretty routine, I backed in at the motel, shut the truck down, and the two dudes flipped my mirrors so I couldn't see out back. 

I was sitting in the truck, and as usual, it was really quiet, we were hidden from the road here, and it was probably 2 am, so not much traffic noise. 

The footsteps got up in the back of the truck, they were moving around, and that's when I heard it. 

A woman's scream from the back of the truck. 

I instinctively looked to the mirror, but all I saw was the guy standing there outside. 

He gave me a sour looking and reminded me to mind my fucking business and keep my eyes forward. 

I could feel sweat on my forehead, cold chills down my neck.

I didn't sign up to be transporting people. I thought I was just moving drugs, maybe guns at the worst. 

But fucking living, breathing human women?

The door shut and the guy told me to get the fuck out of here and I that I didn't hear shit. 

I drove back, dropped off the U-Haul and didn't sleep all night. I ended up drinking and popping Percocets all day to calm me down. 

Finally I called Marco and asked him to come over. I told him the whole story. 

Marco grabbed me by the shoulders. He said, "Listen man, I swear to you I had no idea they were into that kind of shit. But listen, you cannot say anything to anyone, do you understand? And you absolutely cannot just back out now. They'll think you're going to get cold feet and go to the cops. 

Don't be a hero, they'll kill you before you get anything done, and if not you, someone else will do it anyway. 

Just keep your head down, do the job for a bit longer and I'll see if I can find a way to get you moved to something different." 

I was so grateful to Marco, but I was sick knowing I'd have to do it again, some unknown number of times. 

For the rest of the month, I barely slept. I kept having dreams of being in the truck. I pull over to the side of the road, go around back because I have to save this woman in it. I can hear her screaming, but I can't get the back door open. I'm fighting with the lock. I find some bolt cutters and cut it open, and the inside is just filled with dead bodies, skin turning green, covered in flies and maggots. 

I would wake up sick and puking. 

For the first time, I was tempted to dip into my supply, but I knew I couldn't start fucking up now. I knew too much, they wouldn't hesitate to drop me in the river. 

So I started drinking at work too; hiding a bottle behind the counter, filling water bottles with vodka, whatever it took to kill the thoughts. Being alone at night in a deserted corner store, you just think, and think and think with no distractions except when the customers come through. 

Marco would come by occasionally to check on me. I could tell by his demeanor I wasn't looking good. He reassured me that he was trying to find me a way out.

As the next month's delivery drew closer, I got worse. I wasn't really sleeping at all at this point. I barely ate, and was blowing all my cash on alcohol, cigarettes, weed, etc. trying to escape. 

The night finally came for the next delivery and I think I just detached. I felt numb, like a spectator watching some horrific movie unfold before my eyes as I got to the truck rental place and grabbed the U-Haul. 

I parked it and waited for night to fall while trying not to drink any more. I didn't need to get pulled over for driving drunk with some tied up woman or women in the back. 

But I also didn't want to feel or think anything anymore. The guilt was eating away at me. Maybe if I got caught, I could explain my situation to the police. Maybe I'd get witness protection? Maybe they'd give me a light sentence for helping bring down a criminal, human trafficking operation? 

Night came and I got in the U-Haul and drove it out to the warehouse. They loaded the truck again, guys with guns on both sides of me. 

I drove to another motel on the Berlin Turnpike, a different one. They rotated it every month to avoid suspicions. 

I got there, backed in. Two guys with guns. I parked. I listen to them in the back, unloading the cargo. I pray it's not a human this time. 

The guy on the driver's side looks up at me and says, "Remember, not a god damn word." And flashes his gun. 

The door to the truck is shut, and I drive off. 

Weeks go by, Marco keeps telling me he's trying, but nothing happens.

Next month comes. I do another delivery.

I'm such a fucking horrible coward. I just kept doing it.

The third time, I barely felt alive. I was so strung out from lack of sleep and drugs, nothing even felt real anymore. I popped a bunch of caffeine pills to stay awake and drive straight. My heart was hammering so hard, I felt like I was going to die. 

Drive to the warehouse, I pick up the cargo. Guys with guns. I leave, drive to the turnpike. I pull into the motel parking lot. Guys with guns. The cargo is unloaded. 

But this time, I decided to do something a little different. I don't really know why, it was just this building sense that I needed to break the cycle. That I couldn't do this again. 

I drove down the road to the next motel and parked in the parking lot. 

I didn't really have a plan… I just had to do something. I had to know more. 

I got out of the truck and headed down the street to the motel where the dropoff happened. 

If you're on the Berlin Turnpike headed south in the area with all the motels, the left side is uphill, and the right side is down into a valley. 

This particular motel was down the hill to the right, set against a large patch of woods. 

I found a spot between the street lights and headed down the hill, using the trees for cover, until I reached the motel. 

I headed around the back, sticking to the woods, until I had line of sight on the door where the dropoff had happened. 

I was going over the drop off in my head, trying to figure out which room I had done the drop to when a light went on in one of the windows. 

I could see people moving around inside from the shadows on the curtain. There were some raised voices I could faintly hear from the distance. 
 
I couldn't stop asking myself what the fuck I was doing. Maybe I just needed closure? I couldn't do anything.  I had no plan. I had a phone. I could call them in, but then what? They would know it's me. If the police didn't protect me, I would definitely be killed. 

I had no idea how big this was, what if the police were paid off? Once you reach human trafficking levels of crime, it's a whole new level of bad. 

It was late September and I remember it was cold as shit. I hadn't worn a jacket, and the wind was picking up. It must have been three in the morning at this point. The light from the moon was pretty damn bright because I could see my way into the woods pretty well without a light, maybe it was full? Not really sure. 

I remember sitting there with my cellphone in my hand, just staring at it. I kept thinking, I could just make one call. I was shaking, sweating, imagining all the ways this could end my life. But I couldn't keep doing this. 

I ended up behind a tree throwing up, trying to keep quiet, and that's when I heard a door open. 

Looking back at the motel, I could see people walking out of the door. 

There were three men, and between them was a woman wearing a long, white robe. By the way she was walking, it looked like her hands were bound, and the muffled noises she made suggested she was gagged. 

If there was room for my heart to sink lower, it would have. This must be the girl I drove here tonight. I was crying at this point, and shaking. I wanted to hurt myself; to punish myself for getting involved in this, and hurting this girl.

There was a car nearby, it must have been theirs. I knew if I could just get the plates, maybe I could call it in and save her? 

I tried to see it through the trees, but it was too dark and far away. I started slowly moving forward to get a better view of the plates. 

They had the girl on some kind of rope leash and were pulling her long. 

They got to the car, but to my surprise, they kept going past it, heading into the woods to my south. 

They clicked on some flashlights and walked right into the trees. 

I figured there must be some kind of hand off to another part of the chain, whatever you call it when they take people and sell them to another group. It made sense to meet in the woods at night, I guess? 

I started following them at a distance. I was fucked up, but lucid enough to know to only walk when they did so they couldn't hear me crunching along through the woods. I was thankful for the increasingly loud wind covering my steps as well. 

I think we walked about a quarter mile into the woods (I could be wrong, I'm from the city and any amount of woods feels like a lot) until we came to a clearing. 

They took the rope that was tied to her hands which they had been using to pull her along like a dog on a leash and tied her off to a tree, her hands up above her head. 

One of the guys stepped out of the group with a book, opened it and began reading what sounded like a prayer, but I didn't understand the language. Could have been Spanish, but at the distance and with the wind it wasn't easy to tell. All I remember was a distinctly prayer-like cadence, with the rising and falling of his voice. 

He finished, closed his book, then the four men turned and left.

The woman was frantically pulling at the rope, struggling to break free. She was crying and sobbing, sniffling and choking. 

I started to think this was my chance, maybe I could save her? 

If this is some kind of drop off, or exchange, how long would it be until the pickup happened? Were they waiting nearby to come take her when the others left? 

Was she just being held out here? That wouldn't make that much sense, too dangerous to leave prisoners outside, right? 

Or would it be a bit before whoever wanted her came by to get her? 

Once I was certain the four men had gone, I started moving closer to the edge of the clearing, hoping I could see well enough to tell if anyone was coming. 

The girl was probably about eighty to one hundred feet away from me, and I was right on the edge of the clearing. 

My arms were shredded from pushing through thorns, but I was so flooded with adrenaline I barely noticed it. 

The wind had picked up even harder, constant, and very cold. 

I was pretty confident at this point no one was immediately coming to claim her. I started making my way around the edge of the clearing, when I suddenly got this uncomfortable feeling, like someone was watching me. I can't describe it, the hair just stood up on the back of my neck, and I felt cold chills. 

I dropped down low, and started looking around. I was sure whoever she was left for had come to pick her up. I just knew, somehow. 

I couldn't see anything but the dark woods, a field of long grass, fading off into darkness. There were lights off in the distance to the east, from buildings down the side streets probably. 

But then I noticed two of the lights moved a little, then sort of… blinked? 

I was confused, I mean, I was pretty fucked up from not sleeping, and all kinds of drugs the last few months. It wouldn't be the first time I hallucinated some weird shit. 

But no, it definitely looked like two eyes, like when you can see a cat's eyes in the dark. 

But they were too high up. 

I don't mean too high for a cat.

I mean they were like seven, maybe eight feet off the ground if not more. 

Something really didn't feel right, I just froze, unable to move at this point. I never understood people who froze out of fear, because that's just not what happens to me. I get like… hyper focused, and I just act. I HAVE to act. 

That didn't happen. 

I just froze up. 

My legs went stiff and my arms were limp. Breathing got really hard all of a sudden, like my ribs were too small for my lungs. 

I heard a weird noise, like a rattling, rasping inhale on the wind. It was sort of pig like, but not. Then there was whooping noises that were softer after. 

The shiny eyes dropped down lower to the ground, just above the grass, and started moving across the clearing toward myself and the girl. 

I kept hearing that weird, raspy inhale, followed by whooping. 

The girl had clearly seen it too. She started struggling and screaming into her gag. I felt awful; I wanted to help, but I was still in such a deep state of panic, I couldn't do shit. 

I looked to her, then back to the field and I couldn't see the eyes anymore. 

I was terrified, not knowing where this thing had gone. 

But I knew what I had to do. If I was going to live with myself, if I was ever going to look at myself in the mirror again, or feel like a human being who had any chance of redemption, I had to get her free.

I sprinted across the field to where the girl was tied up to the tree. She was clearly shocked to see me, and seeing another strange man was not helping her fright at all. 

I tried telling her I’m going to get her out of there, which seemed to calm her down a bit. She was breathing quickly and sobbing. Her white robe was absolutely soaked in sweat, and I’m pretty sure she had pissed herself. I would have done the same in her position. 

The knots were tied really tight and they had wet them. I was shaking like crazy, it was too dark to see what I was doing, and I didn’t have anything on me to help pull them out. Even if I did, I wasn’t thinking straight. Maybe I could have used the keys to the U-haul which were in my pocket, I don’t know, I didn’t think of that at the time. 

I just kept tugging at these knots, but they wouldn’t come free. All her pulling and fighting seemed to have just made them worse. I was cursing under my breath when I heard it again. 

A rasping inhale, then whooping.

I stopped and looked around behind me. This time I saw two sets of eyes, instead of just the one, and they were even closer. 

At this point I could roughly make out a dark shape moving through the tall grass, almost cat-like, but also kind of like a human had dropped down on all fours and started walking on outstretched hands. 

The girl was full-on freaking out at this point and pulling hard on the rope, which was NOT helping me in freeing her. Her eyes were wide, and red from crying, and she kept staring over my shoulder at the things in the field. 

The sounds were growing louder; the rasping breath, followed by the whooping noises, and I had not made any progress with the knot. 

Call me whatever you want; I deserve it and you'd be right. I'm a fucking coward and I know it. 

I turned to the girl and just apologized over and over, tears in my eyes.

She was shaking her head. I could tell she was trying to say no and beg me through her gag. She started crying hysterically, and I couldn’t take it. There was nothing else I could do. 

I dashed into the woods behind her, and started running back toward the motel. 

I got a bit into the woods and looked back behind me. Whatever the thing was, I saw it "stand" next to the girl, and bite the ropes off from the tree. It dropped back onto all fours, then disappeared into the long grass, dragging the girl behind it. 

Her gag must have come loose, because as I turned and ran, I could hear her screams as she was carried off into the dark, cutting in and out as she was dragged over rocks, sticks and bumps, turning from fear to pain. 

I took off straight back toward the motel. I had seen two sets of eyes, and I don't know if I was followed, or for how far. I never looked back after that, just ran. I didn't even care if the guys at the motel heard me, I ran into the parking lot where I had dropped the girl off, and out onto the road, then down the street, back to the next motel and right up to my U-Haul. 

I tried to get my key in the door of the U-haul, and dropped them. I was fucking shaking so hard, and my eyes were blurry from crying. I parked with the driver’s side away from the street so I barely had any light. 

I kept freaking out and looking around me, I dropped the keys again, scratched the hell out of the door, and started cursing. I was crying and shaking the entire time, and like the pathetic coward I am, pissed myself. 

As soon as I got inside the truck, I locked the door. I could barely get the key in the ignition, I was shaking so bad. 

I drove back to Hartford, went to my place, got all the shit that I could quickly throw in the U-Haul; all my cash, and I left. 

In the next few days, Marco and Angel tried calling me on my cell but I was too scared to answer. 

I ended up ditching it and getting a new phone. 

I moved down south and got a new job, saved up and changed my name as soon as I could. 

To this day, I still drink almost non stop. I don't do drugs as often as I used to, back to mostly just weed. 

But I feel like the biggest piece of shit on earth because I didn’t save her, and I never told anyone, so there’s been more since. 

I'm a fucking coward. I could have gone to the police or something. 

I don't even know if this is still going on. It might be pointless to report it now. Angel and Alex could have been caught, or left the state for all I know, so I'd just be turning myself in for nothing. 

Judge me however you want, but I never meant for this to happen. 

But the worst thing of all is that I still have no idea what the fuck those things in the woods were, or why these guys were leaving girls out there for them. 

That shit is just out there, living right next to people working and living in that area. 

Where else are they? 

And why doesn't anyone else seem to know anything about them? 

Nothing feels real anymore. I wish I could go back to just working ShopRite and being an ignorant piece of shit, instead of a drug dealer and accomplice to human trafficking and murder. 

I wish I didn't know about those things. 

And mostly, I wish I could have saved her.

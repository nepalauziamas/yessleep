This is the biggest mistake I've ever made. 

I live in a small town, most people know each other here and get along. I go to the community school here and have made quite a few friends here. 

It was a Sunday afternoon, the sun was up shining bright. Me and my friends decided to go biking, we went for about two hours before finally stopping at the flower field. 

Laying down there and having fun, it was all going so well. Until we spotted IT. 

It was a huge house, it had cobwebs around it and looked pretty old. It looked like nobody had lived there for years. 

One of them jokingly said "I bet someone's been murdered there". A chill went down my spine. I can't stand horror of any type and get easily scared. 

Another one of them said to me " I'll give you $10 if you go check out that house" . They knew I was scared of this stuff. I didn't wanna embarrass myself for being a scaredy cat and I earn out of this deal. "Deal" I said and went in. 

As soon as I entered , the floor started making weird noises. It was really dark so I turned on my flashlight. I checked out the house and nothing seemed wrong with it. The only place left to check was the basement so I went in. 

I was welcomed by a very bad smell, it smelled like something died. I thought it's probably a mouse and went inside. That's when I saw the horrifying site, there was blood and human body parts everywhere.I almost vomited. Trying to process what I was seeing. 

There were footsteps and screams from above. I quickly hid inside one of the cabinets. A man was dragging a woman forcefully inside the basement. The woman begged for mercy but the man didn't listen. He chopped her with an axe, again and again and again. 

I was shivering with fear at this point. I didn't know what to do , the woman was murdered right before my eyes. 

"Who's there?" The man asked before moving towards the cabinet. I knew he had found me and made run for the door. The man chased me and screamed "YOU WON'T BE ABLE TO ESCAPE, ALL WITNESSES WILL BE KILLED"

I finally got out of the house , saw my friends and started sobbing. I told them everything I saw and they called the police. In about 20 minutes police arrived. They went in. They came out and said there was nothing in the basement. 

I insisted that what I saw was real. One of the police officers asked "do you know what happened in this house 3 years ago?". "No" we replied. "Apparently a man used to get people into his basement then kill them with an axe and sold their body parts. We found the bodies 3 years ago in that basement but the man still hasn't been found"  the police officer said. 

I went home, trying to make out what really happened. What did I really see? To freshen up my mind, I went to take a shower. As I was in the middle of the shower a familiar voice said from behind "didn't I tell you? All witnesses will be killed".

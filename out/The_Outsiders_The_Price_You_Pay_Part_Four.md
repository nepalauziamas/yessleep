“Hey, are you Tommy?”

I was twenty yards back from Janie, trying to seem nonchalant while she called to the young man opening boxes with a box cutter.  Just to look at him you might think he was harmless enough—early twenties, a bit doughy, with love handles spilling over his khakis and the soft edges of youth and fat giving him a baby face.  When he looked around startled at her greeting, you might be fooled into thinking he was just a kid that was flustered at the approach of a striking young woman.

But looking closer, there was a tension about him.  An uneasy, wire-tight awareness that made me doubt that we’d really snuck up on him at all.  His movements, his expression, it was all a little too precise for a sudden surprise while he was opening boxes at his job.  Tommy shouldn’t have been expecting two strangers to approach him at the back loading dock of the grocery store, and maybe he hadn’t been, but his uneasy, aw shucks smile as he brushed off his pants and asked Janie how he could help her?  I was watching someone who was always on guard pretending they were not.  More than that, he didn’t even ask how she knew his name.  Instead, he tried to focus on finding out what she wanted before he gave away too much.

I glanced back at his shirt and pants.  The pants were ill-fitting, but clean and even pressed.  A young guy working at a local grocery store was pressing his pants?  Maybe he couldn’t afford new ones that fit better, but why would he take such care with the pants and let the shirt be so loose and wrinkled and sloppy?

Because the shirt was for the world.  The obvious sign that he was worthy of ignoring, that he could just be written off as a fat, sloppy kid who stocked shelves for a living.  The pants?  They were his private joke, a window into who he really was, a window that the world would never bother to look through.  A secret just for him.

One of many, I suspected.  Because unless I was mistaken, this bright and precise young man had participated in the murder of more than a dozen people over the last few years.

The thought made my heart pick up slightly and I had to force myself to not draw closer in case he tried something with Janie.  It was very unlikely, and I’d agreed to her logic that she would be more likely to draw him out than I would, but it didn’t stop me from watching his every movement as he stepped closer and Janie explained that her and her grandfather were new to the area and, well, she thought she knew him from some online forums and chat rooms.  He’d paled at that, but she was already smoothing it over, telling him in low tones that we were there to help him.  That we understood some of what was going on and knew it wasn’t his fault.  That he just needed to talk to us so we could make it stop.

There was a moment where I thought he might fight or try to run.  He was looking at me more than her now, and I had the distinct idea he was sizing me up for either option or both.  Little did he know that Janie had a needle ready if he decided to be uncooperative, and I could close the distance between us faster than my appearance might belie.

In the end, it didn’t matter.  His face crumpled in on itself as he began to cry, and when Janie put a hand on his big shoulder, he didn’t flinch away.  Walking closer, I patted his back as I started steering him toward the two picnic tables set up at the back edge of the parking lot for employees to eat lunch.  “It’s okay, Tommy.  Like she said, we’re here to help.”

He looked up at me, a mixture of anger and incredulity on his face, but when he spoke, it was only a soft whisper.  “There’s no fucking helping it, mister.  He won’t let me stop.  S-She won’t either.”  We were to the tables now, and he sat down, but I could already see his words calcifying inside him.  He was preparing to shut down, and once he did, there was no telling what it might take to get him talking again.

Smiling, I sat down next to him, the long blade of my pocket-knife pressed against his inner thigh before he knew it was there.  When he did, his face went red as he made a confused and frightened chuffing sound like you might hear from a startled goat.  *This* was him genuinely surprised.

“Hush, none of that.  I have no real desire to hurt you, Tommy, despite what you’ve done.  But you don’t have the time or the luxury to lie to me or be uncooperative.  You’re going to tell me what you’ve been doing with the people you carry to the cave and why.  Or I’ll open your femoral artery and some co-worker will wander back here to have a break and find your exsanquinated corpse instead.  Am I being clear?”

His cheeks were wet with tears as he gave a trembling nod.  “Yes, s-sir.”

“And you believe me that I will do it?”

He met my eyes then, just for a second before glancing away.  “Oh, I know you would.”

Swallowing, I patted his arm with my free hand.  “Good.  Then this should be quick and painless.  Why do you bind and carry people to Mystery Cave?”

He let out a small choking noise that might have been a laugh.  “Because she wants me too.  She’s in my head, and she tells me she wants tribute, even though I haven’t *asked* for any fucking thing in years.”  Tommy shook his head, seemingly oblivious to us or the knife now.  “It never stops.”

Janie took a step forward.  “What is *she*, Tommy?”

He looked up at her, clearly and honestly afraid.  “I don’t know.  A monster.  An alien?  I know what she wants from me and what Dylan has told me, that’s all.”

I raised an eyebrow.  “Dylan?  Tell us about Dylan.”

Tommy shrugged.  “Dylan Matthews.  He’s the one that told me about the cave.  Took me to her.  He owns the land, and he knows her well.  Uses me to keep her satisfied with new people, though by the time I figured that out, it was too late.”  He started crying harder.  “I thought he was my friend.  B-but he tricked me.”

Janie came around the table and rubbed his back.  “It’s okay, Tommy.  We all get used and tricked sometimes.”

He offered her a tear-stained smile.  “Really?  Did you ever cause someone’s death?  Because I’m pretty sure all those people I’m abducting wind up de-“

“I did.”

Tommy stopped and blinked, meeting Janie’s eyes.  “You did what?”

Sighing, Janie moved back to the other side of the table.  “My twin brother was my best friend.  And because of my mistakes, because I got used and tricked, he wound up being murdered.  Torn open.  And I was the one that found him.”

He shook his head, his expression genuinely sad.  “I’m sorry.  That’s…that’s really shitty.  But it’s not the same.  I’m responsible for these people.  I may not kill them myself, but I know they don’t come back from that cave.  I’ve checked over the years, and none of them ever do.  I’d say it was just Dylan coming behind me and getting them, but…”  Tommy puffed out a long breath.  “I’ve seen it before.  Mystery.  That’s what Dylan calls it.  It…it’s why I don’t stop.  Or tell the police.  I’m afraid of him, but I’m terrified of the thing in the cave.”

A young woman came out a door near the loading dock, brown sack in tow.  Raising my free hand, I gave her a wave.  “Sorry to hog the tables, dear.  Could you give us just a few more minutes?”

Frowning, the girl gave a slight wave back and went inside.  As the door closed, I focused back on Tommy.  “How do you do it?  How do you get them?”

The young man blushed slightly, and I felt a stab of repulsion at the flicker of excitement I saw as he looked through his memories.  “Usually a needle.  Dylan gives me something that knocks them out fairly quick.  They can still move for the first couple of minutes, but it doesn’t take long for them to be dead weight.”  He frowned.  “They sometimes wake up again before we reach the Cave, though.  I hate to hear that.  It makes me feel so bad.”

I pressed the knife tighter against his leg.  “I told you, no lying.”

There was a bit of anger in his eyes when he looked at me this time.  “Okay, I don’t mind it.  It…it excites me.”  He lowered his gaze.  “But fuck, I don’t want it to, you know?  I know what I’m doing is evil.  And I swear I want to stop.  I just can’t.”

Janie leaned across the table and patted his hand.  “We can help with that.  But what else can you…”

The door to the store opened again, and this time a thin man in a short-sleeved white shirt and blue tie came out onto the dock.  “Tom, what’re you doing?  They’re waiting for you to load the pallets.  And Sasha said you were out here just sitting around when your lunch break isn’t for another two hours.”  He frowned at me and then Janie.  “And who are your friends?”

Standing up, I slipped the knife into my palm as I smiled at the man.  “This is all my fault, sir.  Me and my granddaughter are family friends of young Tom here, and we were so excited when we got into town we just had to pay him a visit.  I’m sure you understand.”

The man gave a thin smile and nod.  “Sure, sure.  Tom is a good worker.  Just…if you folks could wrap it up soon.  We need him back to work.”

“Certainly.  We’re about to go.”  When the manager was gone, I looked down at Tommy.  “You’re going to write down where this Dylan lives.  Who else lives there.  The layout of the hou…”

“He’s alone.”

“Dylan Matthews lives alone?”

He nodded with a frown.  “Yeah, but I mean he’s always alone.  I don’t think he has anybody except for me.  And her.”

I glanced at Janie and saw the same unease in her expression that I felt in my own.  We needed to know more, but this wasn’t the place to do it.  I looked back at Tommy.  “Listen, we appreciate you telling us this stuff.  We have more questions though.  What time do you get off work?”

“Um, six, but…I don’t want to talk about it any more.  If they find out…she may already know, and if she does, he will soon.”

Janie stood, looking down at him with the commanding gaze of a queen who expected to be obeyed.  “This isn’t about what you want, Tommy.  This is about the people you’ve hurt.  And stopping anyone else from being hurt.  Or do you want more blood on your hands?”

He gave a small shudder as his shoulders slumped.  “No.  I…no, I don’t.”

She favored him with a small smile as she laid down a piece of paper on the table between them.  “Then write down your number.  We’ll contact you and finish talking somewhere more private, okay?”

Nodding numbly, he took a pen out of his shirt pocket and scribbled down a number.  Janie picked it up and dialed it immediately, and a moment later we heard a buzz coming from his pants pocket.  She grinned at him.  “Good.”

We spent the afternoon riding around town.  We weren’t ready to visit Matthews yet, but I did want to get a better idea of the place.  It seemed oddly normal, and while looks are frequently deceiving, Janie agreed with me that there was nothing overtly strange or sinister about anything we came across.  Maybe it really was limited to Tommy and this Dylan, which would make things easier, especially if we got done with Tommy before Dylan knew we were coming.

Janie called at seven to set up a time to meet, but the phone just rang and went to voicemail.  She was about to try again when the number called her back.  She turned on the speaker as she held the phone between us.  

“Tommy?  You there?”

“Who is this?”  This wasn’t Tommy.  It was a much older and deeper voice.  My first thought was Dylan, but it could be anyone.  Janie leaned forward slightly as she responded.

“My name is Janie.  I’m a friend of Tommy’s.  Who are you?”

“I’m Deputy John Roundtree with the Tulset County Sheriff’s Office.  I…Ma’am, I’m sorry to tell you this, but I’m afraid your friend is…well, he’s gone.”

“Gone?  Gone where?”

The man’s voice was higher and more nervous now.  [“Dead, I mean.  I mean I think…we think he killed himself in his car about an hour ago.”](https://redd.it/9ndww5)

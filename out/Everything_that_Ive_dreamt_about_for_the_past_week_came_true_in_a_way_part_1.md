I know it sounds stupid, but please believe me. 

It all started exactly one week ago, I was browsing through Reddit at 10 pm, as i thought to myself, *I should get to bed,* but, me being my usual stupid self, stayed awake. 

A couple minutes later, my friend Josh called me on Discord. I got up to grab a Red bull and joined the call. 

"Hello?" I say. He doesn't answer.

He messages me, saying that his mic isnt working, but he says he has to tell me something. He tells me that last night he had a dream about his sister Lyla coming to his house, and after they make coffees and begin talking, she faints and falls on the floor. He calls the ambulance, and he said he can't remember what happened after that. The dream was very vivid, apparently. 

He then said that today, his sister came to visit him. Just like the dream. She fainted on the ground. Just like the dream. He called the ambulance, who came and done CPR on his sister. They told him that she had had a heart attack, and she had blacked out. Josh said he was speechless. He couldnt even talk. His dream had become reality. The ambulance took Lyla to hospital and Josh sat on his porch until he decided to call me.

And that was when I woke up.

I jolted awake, the dream was so realistic I was actually sweating. I lied in bed for half an hour, just thinking about the dream. Something about it... It just felt so *real*. I reluctantly got up and made some toast, watching TV as I ate breakfast. 

The day basically went as usual. It was a Saturday, so i didn't have work. I stayed home and binged Jeffrey Dahmer on Netflix, since my playstation was broken so I couldn't play video games. Then, that night, I was watching YouTube videos on my phone when Josh called on Discord. At 10.03 pm. Just like my dream last night. Palms sweating, I joined the call. 

His mic was broken.

He messages me, saying that last night he had a dream. About his sister. Fainting. Him calling the ambulance. I almost jumped out of my seat. My forehead was sweating as I put my hands on the back of my neck. I look over at my phone - I see his messages about how his dream came true, and his sister having a heart attack, about her going to the hospital. 

I prayed to wake up now, right now. But this time it wasn't a dream. It was real. Very real. I couldn't believe it.

My dream also came true. 

I go back over to my phone. Usually I would be skeptical, but my dream last night somehow contradicts that. Somehow. 

I message him, 'Bro... I had a dream last night as well. That you told me this story. At the exact same time.'

He messages back, 'This isn't time for fucking jokes. My sister is in the hospital. And you think it's all a joke?'

His Discord status switches from online to offline straight away. I facepalm. I mean, if it happened to him, then what makes him think it couldn't've happened to me either? I switch off my phone and think, *It was probably just a coincidence.* 

But if I said I actually thought that, I would be lying. It can't have been a coincidence. I sit my phone on my bedside table and try to sleep. But I can't. My mind was filled with thoughts. But, eventually I was grasped by the hands of sleep, and it took over my body.

That night, I had a dream that I ws drivinn through the bush, the direction that I would usually go when visiting my Grandpa. 

My Grandpa raised me as a kid, so he was basically a father to me. I didn't know it was dream at the time obviously, but it felt way too real again. I can recall the exact song that was playing, and the exact clothes I was wearing.

 A few minutes later, I arrived at my Grandpas house, but 4 trucks were outside. Big, black trucks. I leaped out of my car, and sprinted towards the open door, that is covered in gunshot marks. 

"Grandpa!" I yell. 

"Who's there?!" I hear someone yell back. But it wasn't Grandpa. Then, as i sprint into the kitchen, a man in fully black clothes and a mask appears. He holds a pistol up to me, but I shove past him, into the loungeroom. Then I see Grandpa tied to a chair, and another black clothed man holding a shotgun to his head. As soon as he sees me, he shoots Grandpa right in the face.

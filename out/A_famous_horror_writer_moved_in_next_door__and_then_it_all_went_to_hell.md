Sometimes it isn’t obvious precisely where and when everything went wrong. This isn’t one of those times. It all started when he moved here, when *they* moved into the house next door.

It rained the day they came. And not your run of the mill - don’t forget your umbrella or you might ruin your hairdo - rain. It lashed down for 36 hours straight. Sheets of rain so full and heavy they bounced off the road. 

When it rains like that - and it does from time to time up here - the road in and out of town floods. A couple of minutes inland the road dips down to a small bridge over the creek. On days like these the bridge and a stone’s throw of road either side are underwater.

We knew he was coming even though he tried to keep the sale a secret. Fans had a habit of taking photos outside the house he bought when he first made it big. He sold that house years ago and people still go there. In small communities there are no secrets and a best selling horror writer moving to town was the biggest news we’d ever had. And what’s more - he’d bought the house next to ours. 

But until the man himself materialises, you don’t quite believe it. You wait in a state of suspended disbelief, waiting for the first confirmed sighting of the man promised to appear.

“He won’t be coming today.” Lisa didn’t need to look outside. We had listened to the rain beat against the window all day. The bridge has to be underwater and the road impassable.

“Then who is this?”

Out the kitchen window a white mini van pulled into the driveway of the house next door. Lisa trotted over to join me at the window. The fence obscured all but the roof of the van. The driver’s side door opened. A man wearing a black raincoat pulled the hood over his head as he exited.

“Is it him?”

“Shhhh.” 

“How did they even get over the bridge?”

The man in the coat paused and turned his head to our kitchen window. We instinctively ducked and then giggled like children.

“Do you think he saw us?” I said.

“Maybe. We should go an introduce ourselves.”

“In this? We’ll get soaked. And so will they. Wait until the rain stops.”

The rain kept on into the evening. I woke in the early hours of the morning and rose to relieve myself. After the cistern finished filling I stopped and looked up. Silence. The drumming of the rain had stopped. I pulled back the curtains in the kitchen. The sky was full dark, but by the light of the kitchen I could see the air was clear of rain.

The fence between our house and next door tapers down at the front before terminating halfway up the driveway. Out by the road, illuminated by a sensor light perched on the carport roof, stood a lone man in a black raincoat. He turned and, seeing the light from my kitchen window, waved. 

Does he want me to go out there?

I grabbed my raincoat hanging by the door and slipped on a pair of flip-flops. I paused behind the closed door for a beat before swinging it open with a flourish. I approached, my head tilted to the side in the universal sign of ’I’m not sure if this is what I should be doing’, but by the light I saw a smile and a full set of teeth.

“Howdy neighbour,” he said.

It was him. I knew what he looked like, most people did. He’d been on late night talk shows and had made cameos in some of the movies made from his books. And now here he was, a real life celebrity in the flesh.

For the purposes of this story I am calling him Harry, but this is not his real name. All names have been changed and at the end you will see why.

“I saw you standing out here.”

“Woke up from a dream and heard the rain had stopped. Came out for a look.”

“Not much to see by night. In the morning you’ll see the ocean through the trees.”

“Harry.” He held out a hand and I took it. Harry was taller than I had expected with angular thin limbs. You think of writers as small pudgy creatures, hobbits who work underground in their hovels. He had a good couple of inches on me. His face was young for his age but he had the unmistakable rounded belly that comes as a package deal with advanced years. 

“Nick.”

“Does it always rain like this?”

“No.”

“Maybe we brought it with us.” He looked at me sideways and smiled. 

“Most of the time it’s paradise. We were surprised to hear you bought the place though. There’s not much to our small town.”

“You assume I had a choice in the matter.” His grin broke into a laugh. 

“You’ll like it here. It’s a great place to live. I wouldn’t be anywhere else.” My cheeks flushed red. I felt as a kid showing off a toy to a stranger. 

“I look forward to seeing more of it when the sun comes up.”

We passed ten seconds of awkward silence before Harry clicked his tongue and started up again.

“I might turn back in. Drop by tomorrow with your wife and we’ll do all the formalities. Nice to meet you Nick.” He turned and I looked out into the darkness until I heard the snap of his screen door closing and I went back to bed.

When I woke Lisa was already up. She scrubbed a coffee mug that on any other day she’d leave on the sink for later. 

“Have you seen them yet?”

Her head snapped around. “I’m not spying.”

“Then what are you doing?”

She upended the mug and placed it on the sink. She turned her back to the window and crossed her arms. “I’m allowed to be a little nosy.”

“I met him last night.”

“Who?”

“Harry.”

“When?”

There was a knock at the door. It was Harry. A collared shirt, shorts, and sandals had replaced the black coat. 

“Hope I’m not disturbing,” he said.

“Not at all.”

“Katie and I thought we’d head out for breakfast, our stuff is still packed away in boxes, and given you’re a local I thought you could recommend a place.”

“Sure. We like a cafe on the main street, you can’t miss it, it’s painted blue and white.”

“What’s it called?”

“The Blue and White Cafe.”

He smiled and half turned. “You wouldn’t want to join us would you?”

Lisa stepped across from the kitchen and stood beside me in front of the open door. “We’d love to,” she said.

The Blue and White Cafe has a fenced in garden area out the back populated with wooden tables shaded by white umbrellas. The waiter led us to a table. 

Harry picked up a menu. “Feel free to give us your recommendations.”

We ate and the cafe filled up. Word spread around town until people had to be turned away at the counter. Everyone gave us, or rather Harry, sideways glances, but he paid them no mind. I guessed he was used to it.

The sun climbed and the air warmed. After Harry cleaned his plate of the ham and cheese omelette he leaned back in his chair and linked his fingers behind his head. 

“I think we’ll like it here,” he said.

Katie shifted on the bench to stay out of the sun. I shuffled over to give her more room. She smiled and touched my arm. 

“Thank you dear,” she said.

After the waiter cleared the plates, Lisa leaned down and fished a book out of her handbag. It was thick as a phonebook. The cover was black and bore demonic eyes and the author’s name in huge white letters across the top. 

Lisa said, “I don’t want to be that person, but would you sign my copy?”

She held up the book in one hand expectantly and in the other she held a pen at the ready.

“Lisa come on,” I said. “Don’t be a bother. They just got here.”

Harry smiled and took the book. “It’s not a bother. Always happy to meet fans. Have you read any of my books Nick?”

I hadn’t and felt my face turn read. I shook my head. 

“I have seen some of the movies though,” I said - and immediately regretted.

“Some of them good and some of them bad.” Harry busied himself scribbling on the first page of the book.

“Where do you get your ideas?” Lisa said.

Harry grinned. “Always the first question and the least useful. I don’t find my ideas, they find me. And so any advice on the matter is of no help to anyone who isn’t me.”

“What about Rex?” I said. 

“Rex, the rabid canine from the woods who ravages a small town? That is a true story.”

“Really?” My voice came out high pitched and child-like.

“A version of it at least. A wild dog attacked some kids a few towns over when I was much younger than I am now. I took an artist’s liberty with the details.”

Harry handed Lisa her book back. She thanked him and Harry lowered his head in a bow.

I pointed to the book and said, “What is this one about?”

Lisa and Harry started to answer at the same time. Harry held up his palms. 

“I’ll let Lisa tell it,” he said.

Lisa cleared her throat. “Now that I have the floor. The story follows a man under the spell of a demon. His job is to find new victims for the demon. But the trick is, the demon can only devour a soul if the soul truly believes the demon is real. But, the demon can’t show himself, not properly at least, so he relies on the man to tell stories about the demon and he waits for the one who truly believes. This true believer, they are so convinced the demon is real, that they will first dream about it and then, with the image in their head, will see a reflection of the demon in a mirror or the water or a shop window even. This is what allows the demon to manifest and devour the victim.”

“Based on a true story?” I said.

Harry showed us his palms and laughed.

Harry and Katie went to explore the town and we walked home. The cloudless sky made the rain from the day previous a distant memory. A light breeze blew in off the ocean and rustled the palm trees lining the esplanade. 

Once inside I opened a window to let in the breeze. Lisa took the book from her bag and opened to the first page and ran her fingers over the scribbles left by Harry. She smiled.

“Everyone in town will have one of those soon,” I said.

“Yes, but I’m the first. I’m going to sit out back and read.”

“You think it’s true?”

“What?”

“About his books being based on true events?”

She shrugged. “Maybe.”

Lisa took a wide-brimmed hat from the counter and slid on her sunglasses and stepped out to the backyard. I followed her with my eyes. She never read out the back. Perhaps she wanted Harry to see her reading his book. I chuckled and turned on the television. 

We didn’t see or hear anything from next door until the evening. Lisa’s skin had turned a shade of red in the sun waiting for them until she packed it in. Harry and Katie turned on the stereo and the sounds of the seventies floated through the open window. 

“They’re giving themselves a soundtrack to unpack to,” I said. Lisa handed me another washed plate to dry.

“Probably.”

“You think they’re a little weird?”

“What makes you say that?”

“I don’t find my ideas, they find me.”

“It’s probably a standard response to a question he’s heard a million times. Moves the conversation onto something else. I think they’re lovely.”

“I didn’t realize you were such a fan until today.”

“Give it a rest. They seem nice and they seem genuine. Given how much money they have it’s a rare thing.”

“Why did they buy that place, with all the money they have?”

“Wealthy people can want for simple things.”

“Seems strange. When I spoke to Harry last night he told me he didn’t have much choice in the matter.”

“Buying the house?”

“Buying the house and moving here.”

“Maybe it’s what Katie wanted. Sometimes it’s nice to give your wife what she wants.” Lisa shot me a sideways smile.

“But why here?”

“Stop being mister suspicious.”

We finished the dishes and shut the curtains.

Lisa woke me during the night. She tossed and turned and kicked her legs. She babbled like a frightened child. I placed a hand on her stomach and her body went stiff and she let out a shriek. Her eyes jolted open and she sat upright in bed panting. I turned on the light and put my hand on her shoulder, which rose and fell as she took in deep breaths.

“What’s the matter?”

She looked at me with unblinking wide eyes. “I had a bad dream.”

“Do you want to talk about it?”

“No, it’s silly. You’ll laugh.”

“I promise I won’t.”

“I’m going to the bathroom.” 

She rose and disappeared behind the door. I lay back in bed. I picked up the book with the black cover from the top of Lisa’s bedside drawer and read what Harry had written. ’Hope the nightmares aren’t too scary, Harry’. Something he’s written a thousand times I guessed.

Lisa’s footsteps sounded in the hall and I put the book back. She climbed back into bed and pulled the sheet high and over her ears. 

“Are you ok?”

“I’m fine.”

I turned out the light.

Lisa was asleep when I rose and left for work. I endured a good hour of questions and comments from my colleagues about our new neighbours. I didn’t have much to tell them, and that was the truth. Disappointed they dropped the subject and we went back to business as usual. And that’s how it goes in small towns.

When I arrived home Lisa’s car was in the driveway. Strange, I always beat her home from work. I opened the door and Lisa jumped up from the couch and threw her arms around me.

“Why are you home?”

“I called in sick.”

“What’s wrong?”

She pulled back from me and wiped her red and swollen eyes. 

“It’s silly,” she said.

I set my backpack down on the stool beside the counter. I looked across the living room with my hands on my hips. There was a bed sheet hanging over the mirror on the far wall. 

“Why is there a sheet hanging on the mirror?”

“I told you it’s silly.”

“Tell me anyway.”

“I dreamed of it last night. The nightmare.”

“Dreamed of what?”

“The demon. I saw it.”

“That isn’t real. It’s just a story.”

“I know how it sounds. But it’s still there.”

“Where?”

“In my head. It’s hard to describe but I can still see it. Even now I’m awake. I feel it too. It’s in my head and it wants to get out. It’s real.”

“This is absurd. It’s only a story.”

Outside a car door slammed. It was from next door. I looked out the kitchen window and Harry’s bobbing head disappeared into the house. 

“I’m going to sort this out,” I said.

I pushed open the door and marched next door. I banged my fist on the screen door. Harry answered.

“Nick, what can I do for you?” He opened the door as he spoke.

“Can I borrow you for five minutes? It’s Lisa.”

“Well sure.” Harry closed the door behind him. “What’s the matter?”

“I’ll show you.”

Lisa sat on the couch and held a scrunched tissue to her nose. I sat beside her and motioned for Harry to sit in the chair opposite. Lisa covered her face with her hands and shook her head.

“Oh god,” she said.

“She had a nightmare last night,” I said. “She saw the demon from your book.”

Harry leaned back in the chair and smiled. “I see.”

“Can you tell her it’s just a story.”

“It’s true that it’s a story.”

“Tell her it’s fiction.”

“As I told you Nick, sometimes there’s a truth behind the veil of fiction.”

I shot Harry a glance that said ’come on man, work with me here’. 

“Tell her you are not a demon master or whatever it is in the book.”

“Lisa honey, look at me.” Harry put his hand to his chest. “I am not a demon master.”

Lisa sobbed. “This is so embarrassing.”

“It isn’t,” Harry said. “I’m plagued by nightmares and sometimes I too believe them to be real. How do you think it is I can write the way I do? It’s natural. Take down the sheet over the mirror.”

Lisa forced a smile.

“Thanks Harry,” I said.

“Any time.” He slapped his bare knees and stood and showed himself out.

I squeezed Lisa’s shoulders and rose from the couch and grabbed the sheet hanging over the mirror.

“No,” Lisa said. “Leave it. Just for now.”

I shook my head.

“Please,” she said.

I relented and left it hanging.

That night the nightmares returned. Lisa cried out in her sleep and thrashed her arms and her whole body shook. Her smooth skin prickled and her hair turned wet from sweat. When she woke she gave a wail and wept. I turned on the lamp and held her until she calmed. 

“It’s still there,” she said.

We lay awake until the sky brightened and she finally closed her eyes. Not long after my alarm sounded. 

“You have to get up,” she said without opening her eyes.

“I don’t have to. We can stay here.”

“We can’t stay here forever.”

She was right. This couldn’t go on. The idea of this demon had infiltrated her subconscious and there it would stay until something changed. A house full of covered mirrors wasn’t going to help. 

“Maybe you should get out of town,” I said. “Skip work again and go for a drive and see your parents. Stay there if you have to. Get away from this house and the writer next door.”

“Maybe you’re right.” 

We rose and dressed. We ate silently before the shrouded mirror. Lisa packed a bag and put on a fake smile. I hugged her and told her it would be fine. And I believed it would be. Stories of monsters and demons are just that - stories. I was starting to think Harry got off on making people believe what he wrote bore some truth. Maybe that was his thing.

I kissed Lisa and she took her bag to the car. I went for a final bathroom break and was halfway through when I heard the screaming followed by the sounding of the car horn and more screaming. I ran outside. Lisa was in the driver’s seat of her car, seatbelt on and frozen in place. I opened the car door and waved my hand in front of her open eyes but they didn’t flinch. Her face was pale. Her mouth was wide open. She felt cold. Her muscles were stiff. I felt for a pulse, but there was none. 

“Lisa, talk to me Lisa.”

I came back to her eyes, wide and unmoving. I followed her gaze. She was looking in the rear vision mirror. I looked in the back seat but there was only her bag. 

Harry and Katie had heard the commotion and came running. 

“Call an ambulance,” I said.

Harry dashed back inside. Katie stood by the fence frozen in place just as Lisa was.

The doctor said it was a heart attack. Her heart exploded in her chest. But she was so young, and so healthy I reasoned. The doctor raised his eyebrows. Sometimes it just happens.

That was bullshit. Whatever happened had something to do with them. Harry and Katie. The couple next door. The writer next door.

I drove home from the hospital clenching the steering wheel so hard my fingers ached. I pulled into my driveway but went straight to their house. I banged on the door. Harry answered. He opened the door and I ripped it open and pushed past him.

“Tell me what happened,” I said.

“Nick you’re upset. Is Lisa ok?”

“No she isn’t ok. You killed her. I know you did. You put this in her head.”

“Nick I was here when it happened, not out there.”

“You did it with your words and your suggestions.”

“He didn’t do it.” The voice came from behind. I turned and there was Katie, sat on the couch. “No man can be a demon master. Men are too weak. They lose control too easily.”

“You,” I said.

“Dear, the demon does all the work. I am merely a vessel through which he travels and rests and sleeps. I find him prey when he gets hungry. And when he gets hungry, I get hungry.”

“It’s your fault.”

“I have no say in the matter, I never have.”

“I’m going to the police.”

“And what will you tell them? Your wife is dead, but it won’t be death by demon on the death certificate will it? What did they say at the hospital?”

“Heart attack.”

“And heart attack it will stay. Talk of demons and bad dreams and mirrors won’t get you far. You’ll be a grieving husband looking for answers. Clutching at straws. They will dismiss you, or lock you up, or both.”

She was right. What did I have? The doctor had said a heart attack and that’s the way it was. 

Katie smiled. “If you don’t mind it’s getting late dear and we need some rest. It has been a big day for us all. There is a lot to digest.”

I looked at Harry. He avoided my eyes. I turned and stomped out of the house. When I reached the door Katie called after me.

“Sweet dreams dear.”

Alone in my kitchen I reached up to the high cabinet and pulled down a bottle of vodka. I didn’t bother with a glass. It burned my throat going down. I shut my eyes. They hurt too. Everything hurt. In the darkness created by my closed eyelids I saw it. The glowing eyes of the demon.

I slammed the bottle on the kitchen table and went to our bedroom. The book lay atop the bedside drawers where Lisa had left it. Harry’s name in bright white letters. The black form of the demon below with its red unblinking eyes. I picked up the book and ripped off the cover. I tore it to shreds. I turned the naked book in my hands and read the inscription Harry wrote on the first page. I tore that out too and turned it to confetti. 

I fell asleep on the couch. I had vivid dreams. Dreams of Lisa. Of our wedding day and of walks by the beach, the waves lapping against our bare feet. Her smile and her eyes. Her frozen eyes fixed on the rear vision mirror in terror.

Then it came. The demon. Black body and fire-red eyes. Long limbs ending in claws. A grotesque misshapen face. Exactly what I imagined a demon to look like and perhaps that was the point. It snarled. It drooled. It beckoned for me to make it real. 

I woke in the dark. I turned on the light. There was a circle of sweat on the couch left by my head. I shivered.

I saw it still and felt it still. The demon was lodged in my head. It was as Lisa had described it.

I looked up at the big mirror on the living room wall, still covered by the sheet. What was in my head needed only one more thing to become real, to manifest itself and claim my soul. A glance in a mirror and it had me.

How could I get through the rest of my life without looking in a mirror? Or the reflection off a shop window, or in the ocean? Impossible. 

Or maybe there was a way. I stood and stumbled. The bottle of vodka lodged in my head beside the demon. I went to the kitchen and opened the top drawer. I took out a knife and held the tip before my right eye. It would hurt, sure, but if I stabbed and gouged I’d never again look in a mirror. 

The knife trembled. I imagined the pain shooting through my eye and into my brain. The blood gushing from the open wound down my cheek. I hesitated.

I looked up. I hadn’t closed the kitchen curtains. Out by the road stood a figure. It was Harry, looking out into the darkness. Did he once dream of the demon? Was it Katie who had saved him - some dark bargain?

I shut the curtains. I picked up the knife. I put the tip back next to my eye. My hand shook. 

I closed my eyes. I turned the room black. And there it was still. The demon prowling in the darkness, its red eyes somehow looking into mine. Even if I am blind, it will still be there. I will live a life of darkness except for those evil red orbs. 

What would be worse? A life spent blind and with this thing inside my head, or to look in a mirror and end it now. But maybe I can offer it something? Harry must have, or Katie. I cut a deal. Or maybe I have nothing it wants except my soul. 

I opened my laptop and turned up the brightness so there could be no reflections and came here to tell my story. The knife sits beside the mouse. I don’t know what to do.

I'm a 15 year old girl and I have started to nothice that my phone has the internet access to a parallel universe. I think. 

I have never liked the idea of multiple universes but this may just be the only explanation.

Please hear me out. I grew up in a kinda poor household. Though we had phones and a tv we didn't really spend much time on the internet. Meaning that when I grew older and finally managed to get my hands on a smartphone I didn't really want to get off the net.

Now here's the plottwist.

I looked at the American news about abortion being banned and I was really mad about it beacuse who do they think they are. Right? So I went up to my mom and told her that I also want to go and protest and she just looked at me like I had gotten insane.
"Amy, what are you talking about? There's no abortions being banned. Are you pregnant?"

I was ofcourse confused and went outside anyways to look at it myself. Indeed. There were no people protesting at the court house. But when I looked down at my phone. It had that same date it had today on the live that showed millions of people protesting on the same spot that I was standing on. 
I checked my settings and date settings to see if anything had gotten wrong but nope. Everything was fine.
I went to the local libary to use the internet there and compare it to my phone's. 
I looked up the Johnny Depp's and Amber's case and it didn't exist. 
I looked up the climate change and it also didn't exist.
I looked up our current president on my phone's internet and she didn't exist.

I was completly about to lose my mind. My phone is somehow linked to internet that dosen't even exist.
Since I never had any friends and my parents only had one old phone in the house to call to that they both used. I had never really used the call feature on my smartphone. So I asked asked a random handsome boy who was reading a book for his phonenumber. He gave it to me for my surprise. Must be my decent looks.
I called to it on my phone but his phone didn't ring.

He looked over my shoulder. That was when the phone was being picked up. It was his voice. But he wasn't on the phone.

"Hello?"

I stayed quiet. His eyes widened. Can't say mine didn't. I called the parallel universe boy.

"Hello? I'm gonna hang up. Is this a prank? Hallooo???"

The boy wispered to my ear on my left. "Freaky"

I nodded.

The other boy on the other side hung up and now I felt how fast my heart had started beating.

"What the hell?"

The boy asked me. I explained everything to him and to my surprise he was more intrested than scrared. Still pretty afraid though. We have a portal to the other universe. In the form of a phone.
The boy's name was Stanley. He was reading a sience book before and his favorite colour was gray. 

After we had done few more tests on my phone's internet and the library's internet police showed up and we hid behind the shelves. We overheard them talking about "unidentified weaponry" that was supposed to be in this libary. Well. I knew exactly what it was. Stan knew it too. It was my phone in that white phonecase.

I'm posting this from my phone so anyone atleast knows this story. Ofcourse it dosen't matter but I feel so lonely. I'm stuck in a universe that seemingly has been a lie all along. The universe that you live in is yeah, fucked up but atleast that's the universe where my parents aren't poor and the internet that I know has always been here. Listen to this. We don't even have minecraft in my universe. 

I don't know how but. I'm on my way. I will find this universe no matter where you are. Starting with this post.

Peace out âœŒ Amy Frida Illagers

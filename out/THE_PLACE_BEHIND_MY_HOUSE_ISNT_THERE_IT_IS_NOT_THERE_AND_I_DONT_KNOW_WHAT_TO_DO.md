I was always an imaginative kid but what I found out today will forever change the way I think 

I've never thought about looking at family photos before but I did today and honestly, I don't think I can ever think or act the same. 

I live on a quiet estate with about twenty houses up and down the round, it's always been a friendly place where kids would play out, neighbors would get along, and the field behind my house was always the perfect place for teenagers to get wasted, have laughs and enjoy themselves it was something everyone that grew up there did and a lot of my friends also came to the estate to you know get wasted and crash at my place .

But a few years back me and my friends were blasting music and drinking a lot we were all past the point of being sober when one the girls let's call her Ava decided to jump into the small pond and everything was fine and we all thoroughly enjoyed it but that's when she started threatening us saying she was going to kill us if we didn't carry on jumping in it was so strange the way she changed so quickly I think as soon as this happened we all clicked from being unable to stand to stone cold sober it was so scary but I took the lead by punching her to the ground punchering her lungs and ripping out her vocal cords and dropping her into the deep parts of the pong where I knew something would get her down there but the next day I and four friends went down to the pond and found her body pushed onto the side of the pond we could barely see who it even was something else had got Ava and it wasn't us we planned on burying her in a wooded area and that went on for miles we started digging a grave for our darling Ava, dumping her body inside and filling her grave. 

Up well anyways today I was looking through this family album book filled with photos of our family and I seen Ava in one of the pictures I felt seriously nostalgic and decided to go back to the place me and my friends buried her four years ago and dug her body up at the time we were all around 14 I'm now 18 and didn't know how deep a grave really needed to be and she wasn’t there i started shitting myself panicking thinking to myself what am i going to do i rang the four friends that i hadn’t spoken to since the incident pretty self explanatory why but we all gathered round to see her body gone and later found out that after we buried the body one of the older ones in the group took her body to his house stuffed it preserved it patched up her body and kept it in his house where it still was and we later found out he was arrested after a neighbour came round and found the doll stuffed in the basement slowly rotting away.

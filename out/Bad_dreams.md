“How long have you been having this issue, Michael?”

I stared at Dr. Mills across the coffee table and thought deeply.

“My whole life I guess, I don’t know.” I shrugged my shoulders and stared at the table.

“Not dreaming in and of itself is no cause for concern Michael. it can be simple things like not getting enough REM sleep or bigger things like sleep apnea.” Dr. Mills scribbled on his pad for a minute and I let the silence rule for a little longer.

“I’ve had a full physical and a sleep study doctor,” I told him just a suggestion of aggravation in my voice.

“Oh, and what did the doctor tell you?” Dr. Mills scribbled more in his little notepad, I don’t know why but that sound made me want to snap his pen.

“They told me I’m healthy, no sleep apnea, and I entered REM sleep as I should.” I felt stupid sitting here talking about this. I didn’t even want to do this.

“So a completely healthy 30-year-old male with no sleep issues, no prior traumatic events, and no recent head injuries correct?” Dr. Mills stared down his rimless glasses at me.

“Yeah,” I answered dejectedly 

“Why are you here Michael?”

“I wake up drenched in sweat and…”

“And what Michael?” Dr. Mills is leaning forward now pen and paper forgotten on his side table.

“And I scream so loud I’ve had the cops called more than once! I’ve had to move three times in the last year because of noise complaints and I’ve paid more than enough for medical bills for damage to my throat I just want to know why doctor!”

Dr. Mills reclined in his seat and stared at me until I got myself back under control. He picked his notebook back up and I could see him writing “psychotic” and “danger to society” over and over again. He had no right to judge me I just wanted to know what was wrong with me and what scared me so much in my sleep. 

“Michael this is a safe place you can express your frustrations and anxieties here openly as long as you keep it to a safe level.”

“Okay, I can do that.” Dr. Mills smiled at me and put his notebook away again. He sat forward, steepled his fingers, and breathed deeply. 

“We don’t have much time left Michael so I want to pinpoint exactly what it is that you want to accomplish here.” 

“I want to be normal again doctor how hard is that to understand!” I clenched my fist and stared into his eyes he returned my gaze and kept on smiling.

“I want you to hypnotize me, I want you to ask about repressed memories, I want you to help me fix this!” I slapped the side of my head for emphasis. Dr. Mills got up and paced around the room touching some of his Knick knacks and came to a stop behind me. He placed a hand on both of my shoulders and took a deep breath exhaling slowly.

“Michael if I fixed you I’d starve.” He patted my shoulders and walked back towards the window.

“I’m sure you will find other clients my measly $100 isn’t enough going to bankrupt you.” I laughed nervously at his demeanor and fidgeted in my seat.

“Money means nothing to me, Michael what do you remember?” 

“I told you earlier I don’t remember any of the dreams..” Dr. Mills cut me off abruptly.

“About today Michael what do you remember from today specifically?” He finally turned around and stared at me intently. I noticed when he turned to face me his features had changed his face had taken on a grey sheen and tusks had formed at the side of his mouth.

“I ….. I don’t know.” I stuttered and pushed myself deeper into the couch. I remember the cops being called, the moving, and there’s something else at the edge of my mind that’s just not coming. 

“I remember it well Michael. I was starving Michael.” He drew out the last few words to emphasize his statement. His tusks were growing longer and his mouth had elongated stretching itself into a trunk.

“This country is sick Michael did you know that? Used to my kind, we would go around the nation helping people guarding people young and old alike. We were revered as GODS MICHAEL!”

He strode forward and shoved me deeper into the couch tusks grazing my cheeks.

“Then your kind started getting sick and we tried so hard to help you we tried to help all of you, but you starved us! You started taking pills that forced you into sleep that took away your ability to dream and I watched my brothers DIE MICHAEL!” He was spitting with rage his body slowly morphing away from the calm doctor he had been. Now two huge bear paws were bearing down on my shoulders.

“I thought we would die, Michael then you came along. You and your failed suicide attempt brought you to me, they placed you on watch and I latched on. I waited so long for them to release you and even longer for you to stop taking the medicine.”

He eased his weight off of me and lumbered back towards his chair.

“I am a Baku Michael I feed off your dreams and I keep evil far from you. Demons fear me but don’t worry I can’t harm you humans. I do however need to eat to exist and while I can’t harm you physically I’ve been around for millennia and I will ensure your nightmares produce enough sustenance to sustain me and my brethren for as long as I can.” 

He glanced at the clock, no longer any semblance of the doctor remained only a chimera of elephant and bear. 

“I’m afraid we are out of time Michael let us begin our session.”

I woke up drenched in sweat, my throat was on fire, and a loud knocking came from my front door. I opened it to see a shining badge and a very angry officer.

“Got a noise complaint from this apartment.”

I tried to answer him but all that came out was a whisper. He stared at me and a half-grin broke out on his face tusks showing from each corner of his mouth.

“Bad dreams again Michael?”

The house looked normal enough at the viewing. There wasn't any history of serial killers or rumours of ghosts, and the real estate agent mentioned that while the owner had died, it was in hospice and their son was putting it on the market since he lived in a different province. 

I asked about all this because I honestly couldn't believe that the house could be selling for that price in this market in that neighbourhood. I honestly wasn't expecting to own a house anytime soon, but I'd recently inherited as well; my brother had no kids and though we weren't close it turns out he'd put me in his will. It wasn’t a ton, truthfully, but enough so that when my landlord hadn’t gotten my broken window fixed and it was three months in and this wasn’t the first time, well, I thought I might see if there was anything I could actually buy. 

I asked around, but the only thing anyone could say about it was that the previous owner had built it himself, though inspections said it was fine. It turns out I had been looking too hard at the house and not enough at the owner.

Since making the offer but before moving in, I tried to dig up anything I could find out about it, but there's not much. What I did find was an old article from when it was built, and that was what sent me down the rabbit-hole.

"**Famous architect, Nathan R. R. Richardson, designs and builds dream house.**"

"*Looking at Richardson, you'd think that the soft-spoken man was a local and you would be mostly right. He hasn't been back in town for twenty years. Born and raised in - -, Richardson moved to Toronto to go to university, became an architect and quickly became well-regarded in his field.*"

It goes on like this, but out of curiosity I looked up his buildings. I thought, if he really was a famous architect, then why was his house on the market for less zeroes than it was worth and not double? 

Since the article was written, every single one of his buildings has been caught in a disaster. He was internationally famous and apparently had really terrible luck. One of the houses he built was in one of the States down south, destroyed in a hurricane, for example. House fires, forest fires, flooding, arson, earthquakes. One of the storefronts he built was even run into by a bus.

I asked for another inspection, wondering if he was actually just a bad architect whose buildings didn’t stand the test of time. Everything came back okayed. 

Maybe that's why it was so cheap. Nothing wrong with the house before I bought it, but his buildings were cursed. I didn’t really want to believe in curses, I’d already put in an offer, and the landlord’s daughter had started to learn the violin, so I dismissed the whole idea. I could tell my friends about living in a cursed house and laugh it off, no big deal.

I moved in with embarrassingly few boxes and only basic furniture, though the house had surprisingly come semi-furnished too. Apparently the architect/owner had commissioned some custom furniture and his son insisted that they stay with the house and hey, I wasn't going to pass them up.

The house isn’t big. From what I read, Richardson had built it after he had divorced his wife, so it was a bachelor’s pad bungalow. Two bedrooms, a master and a guest, and two bathrooms - one en-suite and one general with an attached, if broken and not working sauna. I figured maybe one day I'd get it fixed. 

The house was built in the seventies and you can tell by the wood paneling, the oranges and browns and nature-themed patterns. It had that musty smell of old people and dust. The guy had done a pretty good job with upkeep, though, and wasn’t a smoker, so it was still holding up. Anything that had been renovated had been done in the same style.

First night there, most of my stuff was still packed in boxes. My friends who had helped me move had finished their pizza and left, and I was truly left alone in my new house. I had never owned a house before, and I was hyper-aware of how quiet it was. I figured it was the lack of badly practiced violin.

The first problem was small, but gross. I was brushing my teeth before bed and water wouldn’t come out of the sink. No matter how much I twisted and turned the knobs, nothing. Then, finally, liquid came out. Thick and viscous, a deep dark brown. I left it and used a water bottle to rinse instead and passed out almost immediately.

In the morning I tested the sink, the water was still bad so I called a plumber. Plumber gets there, tests the sink and the water comes out crystal clear. She didn't even do anything. To be thorough, she checks everything else out but can't find any other problems. The only thing that kept me from being so embarrassed I could die was that the sludge was still coating the bathroom sink. The plumber said it was probably just some gunk stuck in the pipes that got washed out.

After she left, I had some cold leftover pizza, which made me think that I really needed to go grocery shopping. So I did. 

When I put the groceries away in the fridge it was fine. Not to be paranoid, but there's no way that architect built the appliances. They're safe. Thankfully, since I do not want to know what might have happened with the oven. Not that I was thinking that at the time. 

It's when I tried to put the foods away in the pantry that I ran into problems. All the shelves were tilted just downwards enough that nothing would stay on them. At this point, I'm still thinking it's new house problems so I go through my boxes, find my toolbox and come back to fix the shelves. 

I put a level on a shelf and… there was nothing wrong. They were perfectly flat, not tilted at all. I hadn't touched them. I checked the shelves, found nothing wrong there either. I checked the supports, but they were built into the wall.

I swear they had been tilted before that. I was completely sober, I don't do drugs anymore, I SWEAR those shelves had been tilted. I was confused at this point, wondering if it was an optical illusion or a me-problem. 

Still, the shelves were fine so I put the food away. Closed the door to the pantry and not a second later I heard crashes and clangs of cans and boxes. I opened the door immediately and all the food was on the floor. I checked the shelves again. They were still level. 

This is when I started to get that thick feeling of fear in the back of my throat.

I put the food on the counter. A couple boxes of spaghetti had been crushed by soup cans, and some of the cans were dented, but otherwise they were fine. 

I was not fine. I wondered if someone was in the house playing a prank on me, but the pantry wasn't that big and of course only had the one door. There was no way someone could have gotten in there.

I'm creeped out, so I tweeted about what happened and people were telling me that my house is haunted. It didn't make sense, though. I mean, aside from the fact that I don't believe in ghosts, nobody had died in the house. It was literally built for one person who didn't even die in it. I don't know, can people haunt long distance?

Soon, more things went wrong. Anything that was a new appliance or I brang with me was fine, but anything that was original to the house had some sort of problem with it. The pantry shelves weren't the first ones to drop things when my back was turned. Clothes hung up in the closet would be dumped, hangers and all. I don't even know how that would work. 

So one of those furniture pieces designed for the house, perfectly tucked into the small living room, was this couch and chair matching set. They were both upholstered with the same patterned fabric patterned with yellow roses. Brown for the vines and thorns, pale green for the leaves, on a pale orange. Somehow the colours weren't faded at all.

I was exhausted at this point and just wanted to sit down for a moment, even if the couch dumped me off. That's not what happened. 

It felt like I had sat down on a rose bush, thorns and all. I yelped like a dog and jumped off. My hands where I touched the couch were bleeding from dozens of small pricks. Let's just say that everywhere else that touched the couch were the same, if you can follow me. 

I called a friend, Kamil, who lived nearby. It was a Sunday, he was free. Kamil put bandaids on where I couldn't reach on my upper back. He saw them. They were real. 

When we tentatively tested the couch, we couldn't find anything wrong with them. No thorns. No nails or needles either, just that damned patterned fabric. 

Kamil asked like three times if I was sure that I hadn't sat down in the garden, up until I practically dragged him outside to show him that the most dangerous plants still growing in the yard were daylilies and too-long grass. Not a single rose bush or thistle.

Kamil listened as I described everything so far. He was like, "It sounds haunted."

I was like, "no way, man, it can't be."

One google search on his phone later which didn't bring up any proof that the house had been built on a graveyard or something, he said, "I dunno, man, maybe the house just hates you."

Kamil's a good guy and so of  course he invited me to stay at his place the night but the guy has two kids and his uncle living there. I didn't want to put him out. 

I joked that I should be good, the mattress was mine and I'd sleep on my stomach. He told me to text him if I needed to else but I told him I was going to be fine. 

This probably isn't going to be a surprise, but I was not fine. 

I had spent all day unpacking and didn't have the energy to cook, plus my hands were covered in bandaids. I ordered Chinese, because I felt like I didn't want to leave my stuff there alone. I wasn't even sure if the house would let me back inside. 

I didn't feel like sitting down but was too tired to stand so I laid on the living room carpet and waited for my food. 

Thick, seventies shag carpet. Thick little strands. I felt a tickling along my arms. I don't really remember when I realized that it was crawling all over me. Thick strands like awful artificial caterpillars crawling along my skin and sliding into my clothes. 

I leapt off the floor and saw the entire carpet writhing beneath me, carpet crawling up my legs. I immediately started trying to bat it all off me in a panic, and I could feel one trying to get into my ear when the doorbell rang. 

Everything immediately retreated.

The doorbell rang again. 

Flustered, I opened it. The delivery guy opened his mouth and stared at me, before swallowing whatever he was going to say. I look down at myself and my clothes are covered in thin orange fuzz. 

"Sorry, I uh. I can't find my lint brush."

I gave him a fifty and told him to keep the change. My order had been around twenty bucks, so that wasn't very smart of me but in my defense I was a bit flustered. 

I took the food, figured my stuff wasn’t more important than my life, grabbed a change of clothes and stayed the night in the closest motel that had vacancies.

 The next day I went to the library for hours, researching what I could. I pulled carpet fuzz out of my hair and asked a librarian if they could see it too, and she deadpan told me “Yes,” with zero elaboration or questions.

It didn’t stop me from questioning myself though. It nagged at me like an itch. Did that really happen? What was I supposed to do about the house? I had taken a couple days off work to move in, but I needed to go back in. At the very least, I needed a change of clothes. 

So I went back.

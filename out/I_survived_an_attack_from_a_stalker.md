I don't particularly appreciate saying this story due to reliving all of the memories in the process, but it needs to be said somewhereâ€”first, a background summary. I'll try and keep this short, but I might get carried away.

Nearly three years ago, when I was 17, my family was running extremely low on money, and due to this couldn't pay the necessary bills to live nicely. The bills I can remember not being able to be delivered were the water bills and power bills, but there might've been others that I'm forgetting.

Due to this, I had to get a job, which was a little out of my 'comfort zone' since I was so noticeably comfortable with just staying at home. I never left the house much, only to go to school and other mandatory places, and I never went on runs or walks because I didn't like being in the heat for too long (the cold was always my favorite type of weather, and I lived in an area that was unbearably hot most of the time. I also live in a heavily wooded area, so the only time I would walk was out in the forest due to the occasional breeze from the wind.)

I applied to a local KFC near a park with a pretty extensive trail system. My main reasons were because my best friends also worked there, and I heard from them that the pay was decent (considering I probably didn't have to do much.) Also, thinking there were way bigger fast-food joints in my area, no one really went to the KFC, so around $14 an hour for just cooking maybe five batches of chicken was good in my eyes and could at least help with some of the bills.

About a week after I finished training, we got a call from someone, but they were silent. Absolutely nothing but radio static on the other end. Eventually, when we asked if they were going to be there at any time, they said in a whispery voice: "*you'll know it's me when I get there.*" We tried to get them to say when they'd be there, but we didn't get an answer, and the caller hung up. The entire staff was pretty confused except for one of my best friends, saying it was probably a prank call since some high school kids liked to do that around my area.

Taking my friend's words into consideration, I started believing them too. So, we continued our shift, and people forgot about the call. I didn't. For some reason, the call made me feel uneasy and, even though I believed it to be a prank, it still scared me for some reason.

We all left when the day was over, and no one brought up the call. When I was getting in my car, I saw someone across the street sitting on a bench and immediately got up, walked to the park near the KFC, and entered one of the many trails. I immediately left due to an overwhelming sense of unease.

A few months go by without incident. I had my 18th birthday party, went on a road trip with my family to the mountains in another state, and overall had a nice time. When I gained enough money, I decided to move out of the house and into an apartment a few hours away since I didn't want to be too far away from my past home.

After about a month of unpacking and settling in, I got a call from my friend who still worked at KFC. They said the person had called again, this time without saying anything, only tapping on the other side of the phone. This brought back memories of the first call, and another sense of unease set in due to living on my own.

I couldn't sleep that night thinking that the caller was still there, even though it could logistically be a prank. 

Days turn into weeks, weeks turn into months, and at that point, it had been five months without incident. No thinking about the caller, no, nothing. Just a normal life. But every time I thought it was gone, something would just happen again.

When I was trying to sleep one night during a storm, I heard very, VERY faint tapping on my window. It sounded like the glass creaking, but I knew it wasn't. I didn't turn over to the window or even open my eyes for the longest time. When something is in my presence that I'm terrified of, I'm not going to run up to it or confront it; I'm an average human, and I don't want to get myself killed. 

After what seemed like 50 years, I slowly rolled over to see what it was, and I saw him for the first time. Him? I don't know what to call it. At the window was probably a 6ft or 7ft figure with his back arched directly into the window. It was wearing all black with absolutely no sign of revealing skin anywhere. The only thing showing was its "face." I don't know if it was due to the weird blue coloration of the sky at the time due to the rain or if it was actually blue. However, it was wearing either a blue mask with dull eyes, no nose or mouth, or the one I still don't like thinking about, was that being its actual face, a really, really fucked up and deformed face. 

We stared at each other for ages. I was too stunned to move, and it seemed like the thing was mocking me in a way; it stopped moving and slowly turned its head towards me like it was either confused or just making fun of the fact I was scared. 

I stared intensely at it and noticed eventually that it didn't look like it was even getting wet from the rain; it looked like it was just photoshopped or edited into the scenery. It slowly moved the arm it was using to tap on the glass down near its side. 

It slowly walked to the side and disappeared from my point of view, but I was frozen in place. What the fuck just happened. What even was that? But it clicked. The tapping. That was the caller from several months prior. I slowly turned back around and quickly got out my phone to text everyone I was close with what had just happened. It was around when I was texting my dad when I heard a strange rolling sound coming from extremely close to me. But it hit me extremely fast.

I didn't lock the fucking window.

I suddenly turned around and saw it crawling into my room. I quickly got up and at least tried to intimidate it with the closest thing I could harm it with. But it did not react. When it fully got into my room, it just stared at me. I yelled at it to say what it wanted, but it didn't answer. 

It lunged towards me suddenly and pulled my wrist backward extremely fast, breaking it and making me drop the item I was holding. I yelled out in pain and mustered up all the strength I could to kick it in the chest. It stumbled back but charged at me again. It seemed everything I thought I could do; I couldn't do. 

It grabbed my other wrist and tried to break that one too, but I snapped back and tried to run. The last thing I remember was my head being grabbed and slammed against my door. I woke up the following day in the hospital. My right hand was broken, and my left hand had two broken fingers, even though I had no memory of that. My nose was also broken. I learned that by sneezing and all that came out was blood, not to mention the immense amount of pain that happened.

I got out the same day with all the necessary things I had to have with my injuries, but I couldn't go back to my house-not with that thing knowing where I live. I stayed at a friend's house the following week and returned to my home. Nothing was moved. Hell, nothing even looked like anything happened. The window didn't seem touched; no blood was there, absolutely nothing. 

But, on my bedside table, there was a piece of paper with very frantic writing on it.

"*You knew it was me when I got here.*"

I moved out and haven't seen or heard anything since. I still can't explain what that was or what even happened, but I regret not sharing this sooner. I just need to say this in case anyone sees this thing or anything similar to it. 

I hope no one sees it, ever again. At least not like I did.

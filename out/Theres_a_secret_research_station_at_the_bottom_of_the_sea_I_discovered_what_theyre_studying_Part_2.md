**DAY THREE**

Alexandra had refused to tell me anything last night. Instead, she’d sent us all back to our separate sleeping quarters with strict orders to stay silent about what had happened, while she consulted mission control. They would decide whether to send another submersible to shuttle us from the Nereus and back onto dry land.

Exhaustion dragged at my limbs as I went through my morning routine. I’d spent the night tossing and turning, Katie’s words a drumbeat in my head: *the doorway is open...and I don’t know how to close it.* Despite how often I’d turned them over in my mind, I still didn’t know what she’d meant. And every time I closed my eyes, guilt gnawed at my stomach with sharp cannibal teeth. I should’ve insisted that Katie accompany me to the sick bay. Maybe if I had done that, she would still be alive right now.

A furtive knock on the door interrupted my thoughts and I frowned, striding over to it. A woman stood on the other side. She had short, spiky purple hair and a huge tattoo of a sparrow on her right forearm. “I’m Rose. Can I come inside?” She kept glancing around nervously, as though afraid that someone might spot her here with me.

I hesitated, memories of last night flooding me. I’d witnessed an unprompted murder only hours before. Why should I let a complete stranger enter my room?

As though reading my mind, Rose added, “I came to you because I heard you were there when Katie died. If you tell me what she said to you, I’ll tell you the real reason we’re all here. How about it? Quid pro quo?”

Alexandra had made it clear that everyone on the Nereus operated on a “need to know” basis. I didn’t *need* to know what the scientists were studying, so I didn’t. She didn’t think that anyone else needed to know what Katie’s last words had been either, and she’d be livid if she found out Rose had asked me. But I couldn’t deny that I did badly want to know what Katie had meant, especially since I was stuck here for the next six months.

“Hold on,” I told Rose. I shut the door and started digging through my duffel bag. It didn’t take long to unearth my keychain. It had a range of swiss army knives on the other end of it; they looked ridiculously tiny and flimsy, but any kind of weapon was better than none. I slipped it into my pocket and opened the door again. Rose bolted into my room.

“Thanks. If Alexandra knew I was here, she’d string me up faster than you can say ‘non-disclosure agreement.’ Ha. Um...you’re probably wondering why I’m asking you instead of Ben. He won’t talk to me. I think he blames me for all this. And I heard that Jon...” She faltered, swallowing hard. “Jon is dead. So, please tell me. What did Katie say to you?”

“She said, ‘The doorway is open, and I don’t know how to close it. It’s inside.’ What did she mean by that?”

“Fuck.” Rose ran her hands through her hair until it stood up in all directions and started pacing up and down the narrow aisle between the two sets of bunk beds. “Fuck, fuck, fuck. I knew it was a bad idea to come back here.”

I snagged her arm as she tried to move past me. “Hey. What did Katie mean?”

Rose stayed silent for a moment. Finally, she murmured, “It’s easier if I show you. Follow me.” When I didn’t move, she rolled her eyes at me. “I promise I’m not going to go all *American Psycho* on you, okay? If you want to know what’s going on, then follow me.”

I slipped one hand into my jacket pocket, squeezing the cold, reassuring metal of the keychain, and nodded at her. She didn’t waste any time; she led me straight through the main lock and up the ramp, into a confusing labyrinth of hallways. In theory, the Nereus was modular, which meant that it could be taken apart and then reassembled with upgraded tech; in practice, that had apparently been too costly or too time-consuming, because they’d just added on more and more sections to it without taking anything out. The hallways looped around each other, intersected at random intervals, and occasionally doubled back. I quickly became lost as we took one dizzying turn after the other, but Rose never faltered.

We ended up in front of a pod I’d never seen before. Rose stopped with her arms crossed. “It goes without saying that you can’t tell anyone else about this. They wouldn’t believe you, anyway. I can hardly believe it myself, and I’m the one who found it.” She smiled humorlessly and waited for my nod before sliding the door open.

The inside of the pod resembled an office cubicle: a long, narrow desk bordered every side, and huge stacks of paper had been scattered on it. The space was so cramped that only one person could sit down in the office chair, while the walls bristled with computer monitors, although all of them were dark except for two. One of them showed a graph of some sort that I didn’t understand, and the other seemed to be a live feed of something underwater. Rose jerked her head impatiently, and I went inside.

“That’s what we’re studying,” she said, her voice low and hushed as she pointed at the left-hand computer monitor. “We found it at the bottom of the ocean, in the deepest point of the trench. 9,780 meters deep.”

I frowned and leaned closer to it, until the tip of my nose nearly touched the screen. The image on the screen was blurry, but I thought I could see five standing stones arranged in a rough circle, each one equidistant from the other. They were roughly the same height, although they all tapered off at the top. The sight of them tugged free a memory of the time my friends and I had driven from Cambridge to Stonehenge. It’d taken us two and a half hours, and it’d been a huge letdown: we’d walked around the standing stones for ten minutes and then headed back.

*This* was the reason for all the secrecy on the Nereus? A pile of rocks?

Still baffled, I said slowly, “So, you’re studying...a monument?”

“No. It’s not a monument.” Rose held my gaze as she spoke the next few words, her dark brown eyes intent on mine. “It’s a doorway. To an alternate dimension.”

\*\*\*\*

I walked towards the sick bay, so occupied with what Rose had told me that I barely noticed the door had been left open. I’d asked her how they’d discovered it was an alternate dimension, and she’d launched into a scientific explanation that had sailed straight over my head; I was only able to follow every one word in ten. The gist of it was that this alternate dimension was within spitting distance of ours, and that stepping into the space within the stones brought you there. I’d asked Rose whether Katie had been right--whether something from that other world could have come through the doorway and onto our station.

“One time, we sent an ROV to collect some samples, right? As soon as it crossed into the space within the stones--BAM! It disappeared. The tether was severed and all the cameras went out. But it went through and we never saw it again. So, if something can go through from *our* end...” She ended in an eloquent shrug.

It sounded crazy. It *was* crazy. This kind of thing didn’t happen outside of science fiction novels. I wanted to get out of here. Now. I forced myself to take a deep breath, shoving away the thin tendrils of panic that kept trying to worm their way into my brain. *Stop it, Cordelia*, I told myself. *Focus*. I wasn’t getting off this station without Alexandra’s say so; I had to concentrate on what I could control. And right now, that meant looking through Katie’s medical file and searching for any clues that could explain her behavior.

I settled down onto my office chair and started going through the clutter of paperwork. It was amazing how much of a mess I’d managed to make yesterday morning. But as the minutes ticked by, I still couldn’t find Katie’s medical file or anyone else’s. I frowned, drumming my fingers against the desk. I remembered hearing Katie’s scream and running out of the room, leaving everything on the desk. So, where the hell were the files?

A soft, high-pitched giggle broke the silence. I looked up just in time to see a flash of grey and red move past the doorway of the sick bay. “Hello?” I called. “Who’s there?” No response...but that giggle had sounded familiar. Awfully familiar. My mouth went dry with dread. “Is anyone there?”

“I’m over here, Cordelia.”

Katie. Katie’s voice. My internal temperature plummeted twenty degrees, and I hastily covered my eyes, as though I’d regressed back to childhood. If you can’t see the bad thing, it’ll go away. No, no, no. This was just an auditory hallucination, one borne of stress and sleep deprivation. If I thought I could hear her giggling, that was just the hum of the generators on the Nereus. If I thought I could hear stealthy rustling noises, as though she was taking huge steps on her tiptoes, then I was wrong. Dead was dead. People didn’t come back as ghosts or things that went bump in the night. I kept my hands over my eyes until my breathing had slowed to its natural pace. Until the fear had retreated, and I started to feel like an idiot.

I opened my eyes--*and Katie was right beside me, oh my god, she was really here*, her face lowered to mine. I screamed as a fresh wave of blood spilled down from her empty eye sockets, as the corners of her mouth pulled back into a bestial snarl of hatred. She spoke in an inhuman, grating voice. “*You let me die. Just like you let Riley die. Admit it.*” The carrion stink of her breath wafted towards me, horribly pungent. Horribly *real*.

I tried to push myself away from the desk and stand up at the same time; the end result was that I fell over. The fall knocked the wind out of me, and I remained still, trying desperately to draw in a breath of air. For a sickening moment, I thought I wouldn’t be able to. That I’d lie there until Katie rounded the desk and closed her hands around my neck--

I shot up to my feet. The sick bay was empty. I took a couple of steps forward, stunned. Had I just *imagined* all of that? Through the half-open door of the sick bay, I caught a flash of movement, there and gone. When I ventured outside, Katie stood there, waiting for me. She was miraculously unharmed and whole, the same bubbly woman I’d met yesterday in the kitchen. “Come on,” she said brightly, almost breathless with excitement. “I need to show you something! Something you’ll really like!”

My fear retreated, swallowed by the all-consuming guilt that had been my constant companion since the day Riley had killed himself. Katie was right: I had failed them both. In the months leading up to his death, it had never occurred to me that Riley was spending more and more time lying in bed, unable to muster up the energy to complete simple tasks, much less go to work. I paid no attention to the fact that his temper was shorter, that it’d been months since he’d stepped out of the house to go fishing. No, I was too wrapped up in my own tedious bullshit, and I didn’t realize that Riley was drowning, not waving, until it was too late to matter anymore.

Katie walked away from me, and I ran after her on legs that felt like numb stilts. I needed to catch up with her; I needed to make her understand how sorry I was. But no matter how quickly I ran, Katie always remained far ahead of me, out of reach. I chased her through the main lock and entry lock, until we arrived at the submersible docking station. “It’s through there,” she said, pointing at the airlock.

The synapses in my brain fired sluggishly, unable to make sense of what was happening. I knelt down to the airlock. Another red-orange rust stain covered the upper portion of the hatch. As I touched it, the rust pulsed under my hand: a heart, alive and aware. It started to inch up my arm, enveloping me. I couldn’t retreat, not even as it sank into my eyes--my nose--my mouth--coating the inside of my throat until I choked on it. Indescribable agony filled me and my surroundings blurred together, the colors running and melting, a kaleidoscope of fiery butterflies swarming m--

Someone yanked me away and unceremoniously dumped me to the ground. I looked up to find Ben standing over me, two red spots high on his cheeks. He was breathing as harshly as though he’d just run a marathon. “What is *wrong* with you?” he seethed.

I took in the flickering lights and white walls. It was the Nereus, just as it always had been. I was sitting in the compartment that held the submersible docking station, except a destructive tornado had descended on the room. Every single one of the ROVs, AUVs, and submersibles docked here had either been destroyed or set loose, and the gear used to tune them up had been bashed into tiny metal pieces.

Ben continued, “You were trying to open the airlock. You *do* realize that you would’ve died quickly and painfully the second you stepped out, right? And why the hell would you destroy the submersibles? Do you have any idea how much they cost? Each one is worth millions of dollars!”

I stared back at him, stunned. In the month leading up to my stay at the Nereus, I’d once looked up what would happen to a human being if they stepped into the depths of the ocean without any protective gear on. Severe hypothermia, inability to breathe--but worse than that, the pressure of the ocean would push in their body and cause any space filled with air to collapse, including their lungs. And even if they could get air somehow, they’d undergo nitrogen narcosis and suffocate from the inside out.

If what Ben said was true, then he’d just saved my life. Terror crept over me like a shroud, and I scrambled up, my clothes drenched with sweat and sticking to me. “I didn’t do anything to the submersibles!” A horrible thought struck me. “Wait. Rose told me about the doorway. Is it possible that whatever came through the doorway can make us see things? Do things?”

Regardless of Ben’s answer, I was almost certain that something on the Nereus had led me here...toyed with me...and nearly tricked me into a gruesome death. *But isn’t that what you deserve?* whispered a voice in my head that I couldn’t be sure was mine.

“Rose said that?” He scrubbed at his face with a hand. “I shouldn’t even be telling you this, but we don’t know that anything’s gone through the doorway at all.”

“Katie thought so. That’s what she told me before she died. ‘It’s inside.’”

“Katie wasn’t in her right mind! She kept going on about how two of the stones were broken, how they would go missing every time she looked away from the monitor. She spent all her spare time there. We should’ve known that she needed to get back to the surface. I--I should’ve known.”

Before I could respond, a siren began to ring throughout the Nereus, a loud, mournful wail that drilled straight into my eardrums and set my teeth on edge. It was the sound of plague, death, misery. “What’s wrong? What does it mean?”

“Our primary systems have gone offline! We must’ve shifted to our secondary systems. But that makes no sense, the Proteus should have...” He broke into a run, and I followed close on his heels, praying that the siren was a false alarm. It already felt as though I’d been trapped on the Nereus for three years instead of three days.

“How long will the secondary systems provide us with power?”

“We’ll have at least 24 hours of power, high pressure, and oxygen and carbon dioxide removal, but we need to get in contact with mission control immediately!”

Without warning, the siren stopped, leaving blessed silence in its wake. But before I could huff out a sigh of relief, the lights turned off as well. I stopped in my tracks, narrowly avoiding colliding with Ben. The darkness was absolute. There was a loud metallic clatter as he knocked something over. “The lights should be back on in a few minutes.” He sounded as if he was trying to convince himself more than me.

I shuffled after Ben at a snail’s pace, one hand placed against the wall to keep track of where I was going. Why the hell weren’t the lights back on yet? It’d been longer than five minutes. I reminded myself not to panic; even if mission control didn’t realize something had gone wrong, Proteus would. In fact, they’d probably send a submersible to collect us later today. In only a few hours, we would be out of the Nereus, and I’d never come back here again.

Right on cue, the lights flickered back on. Ben hurried through the entry lock and came to a sudden halt. I did collide with him this time, sending him staggering forward a step. Written beside the kitchen pod, in huge scraggly letters that trailed off at the bottom, as though the writer had been struggling to keep their hand steady, was the following message: *in the walls i see you leave me alone*

“Is that blood?” Ben said, sounding revolted. But we both knew the answer. The dark red words screamed at me accusingly. Unable to help myself, I glanced over my shoulder as we made our way to the kitchen pod. The back of my neck tingled with the unmistakable sense that someone was watching us from the shadowy hallways.

As Ben opened the door, he said, “The comm--” and then I lost the rest of it as someone knocked me over. They shoved me hard enough that the kitchen counter dug into my stomach with bruising force, and my head slammed against the wall. Bright stars filled my vision, and I cried out. Freezing cold hands closed around my throat. I clawed at them, but their fingers were like iron bars, relentlessly squeezing tighter and tighter. *The keychain, get the keychain knife!* I fumbled for it; dropped it. Grey wings unfolded over my vision.

“Ellen! Stop!” I heard Ben yell.

Suddenly, the immense weight against my back disappeared. I spun around, one hand to my bruised throat as I gasped in one breath of air after another. Ben had pulled Ellen off of me; she attacked him with her hands curled into claws and a mindless whine trapped in the back of her throat. When he caught her wrists, she simply surged forward, snapping at him like a feral animal. She was only half his size, but Ben fell back under the onslaught.

I reached for the closest object at hand--a long metal cylinder--and staggered towards them. Incredibly, Ellen was breaking free of Ben’s hold. She went for his eyes, and he managed to turn his head so that her nails raked down the side of his neck instead. As I approached them, Ben’s eyes flicked towards me, and Ellen began to turn--but not quick enough. I brought the cylinder down hard, and she crumpled to the ground.

I checked Ellen’s breathing and pulse. She moaned, already stirring. I hadn’t knocked her out, just stunned her. I gently rolled her onto her back and looked around for something to restrain her with.

That was when I saw Rose, sitting cross-legged underneath the sink. It struck me as an odd place to sit, but I spared it only a passing thought. All my concentration was focused on her because...I swallowed hard. Because she’d disemboweled herself with one of the kitchen knives. As we watched, Rose removed another section of her small intestine through the vertical slit down her lower abdomen, until the smooth, dark pink folds plopped into her lap. Then, she cut it into tiny pieces, and promptly popped one into her mouth. She chewed daintily, her brow furrowed in concentration, as though she was contemplating the taste.

Behind me, Ben vomited into the trash can. I walked towards her, my hands held up in a placating gesture. The immediate risk was whether Rose had damaged any vascular structures; if she’d ruptured her liver, she’d bleed out in ten to twenty minutes. I had to stabilize Rose until we could get her to a surgeon.

“Rose, can you please put down the knife?” I asked, trying to make eye contact and look at the knife at the same time. I expected her to ignore me, but she slowly turned to me.

“What’s going on?”

I sank down on my heels, careful to telegraph my every movement ahead of time. “Rose, you need to trust me, okay? I want you to hand me the knife.”

She blinked at me and obediently held out the knife. But before I could take it, she clamped her other hand over mine with surprising strength. I winced, fighting the urge to back away. If I looked away now, if I showed any sign of fear, I had no doubt that she would stab me. She said urgently, “Katie showed me. It’s inside us already and we can’t leave. It won’t let us. It *made* me do this to myself!” Her voice was growing louder, frantic.

“No, we *will* leave. It’s going to be alright, I promise.” I waited for her to say more, but she released me and slumped back. She’d passed out. “Ben--can you help me pull her out?” I needed to determine exactly why she’d passed out, and if she was bleeding from anywhere else.

But Ben didn’t move. He was staring at the communications panels, his mouth pressed down into a thin, flat line. For the first time, I noticed that they were a smoking, sparking ruin. Most of the dials had been twisted off, while the center of all of the panels had been gouged open, the wires torn out and left in a tangled mess on the floor.

“She’s destroyed our communications,” he said, sounding dazed. “We don’t have any other way to get in contact with mission control. We’re completely cut off from the outside world. And without any functioning submersibles...[there’s no way we can leave the Nereus within the next 24 hours.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Certain_Emergency122/)”

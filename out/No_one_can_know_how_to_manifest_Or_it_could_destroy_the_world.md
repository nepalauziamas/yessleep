I need to come clean. 

Im an average guy or I could say below average. If you were to ask me how my life was like I’d say the same four things. Wake up, eat, work, sleep, and repeat. I dont do much with my life. Except when I’m grocery shopping or running other errands. I live alone, don’t really have much contact with my family, don’t really have any friends. I have a few “acquaintances” I could say. But other than that I waste my free time doing nothing. I was 24 and when I tell people this they always seem surprised because I’m so young and should be full of energy and be adventurous. Im adventurous… in my daydreams. 

I daydream a lot. Maybe way more than normal people should. It’s entertaining honestly. I daydream about good stuff and sometimes some dark stuff like hurting criminals. And honestly I could say that I’m basically a loser. But one day as I was scrolling through social media I see a post that the CIA released declassified articles about manifestation and electromagnetic currents or something like that. Comments flooding the post saying of course manifesting is real and that it all makes sense. I’m sure you’re familiar with comments like “Yesss manifest that A+ on the test” or “let’s manifest good vibes.” I could go on. And sometimes I would jokingly say it out loud to myself before heading into work, “Manifesting a good day today.” Anyways, since I had nothing to do and it was my day off I went into a rabbit hole digging very deep into the subject of manifesting. It was all pretty interesting and honestly I don’t see the need of learning manifestation personally because I’m content with my life at the time but decided to try it out more thoroughly because what could go wrong. 

It has been a few weeks later and nothing really happened. Same daily life as usual. Expect for a few coincidences when I manifested a small raise at my job and petting a random cat. I started small and obvious and even though I was kinda surprised of the minimal events, I figured it could still be a coincidence. Possibilities of those happening isn’t low. But regardless I still continued to manifest minor things. Couple more weeks and still not very much. I tried different “mindsets” and then decided to try feelings. Use emotion and feelings. But then I give up on it and completely forgot about it or so I thought. 

A week later an article came out about a criminal who killed a woman and her child in a drunk driving accident. I start to feel angry. I get emotional when I see stuff like this so I don’t read the whole thing. That night I daydreamed or more like night dreamed like I usually do and I imagine that man getting ran over brutally. Hundred different scenarios. 

Couple days after I find out he got bailed out and he only had to serve probation. I became furious but not surprised. And started daydreaming about his demise. I was heading to work and a lot of people are surrounding the TV. I wonder what’s going on and I see the breaking news. The man was ran over by a semi. As surprised as I was, all I could think about was good riddance. Everything was normal until I started feeling depressed when I found out my dad passed away. He was actually the only person I genuinely looked up to and felt horrible for not keeping in touch with him. I started to self loathe when I looked through all the messages he sent me although I never responded back. And then my world starts falling apart. 

Couple years passed by and it was hell. I lost my job due to covid, my car kept breaking down a like every month, my electronics weren’t receiving much signal for some reason, everything to a minor inconvenience to becoming close to homelessness struggling to pay bills. Since I lost my job I didn’t even have health insurance and there were a couple times I needed to go to urgent care because there were days I felt so sick that I thought I was going to die. And new jobs I applied for didn’t offer any benefits. 

While in bed I just wished to not exist anymore or for just the world to end. I was thinking so much negative thoughts. Anger and void filled me for those long 2 years. I was out of touch with the world. 

Last week I received an email from a new job I applied to and gave me a date and time for an interview. Job rejections to horrible minimum wage jobs, I was a little hopeful. Then I remembered about the manifesting thing and laughed to myself and figured why not try it out again. And guess what? I got the job! And at a good wage too. Higher than my first job. Everything finally started to look good again. And I became more positive and accepting my dad’s death. Then my phone finally starts working better again. No more lag or weak signals. And I decided to start fresh and move on. 

Then I see the news. Catastrophes all over the world. Yes they happen all the time but these… I daydreamed about these. And then I see an article that an asteroid that was suppose to be on its way to earth missed its trajectory and passed us. My heart sunk. I never stopped manifesting. And remembered I daydreamed about a pandemic that I didn’t think twice about. Millions of people dead. Millions injured. Floodings, fires, droughts, pandemics… what have I done? 

The entire day I tried to manifest getting rid of my manifestation. I can’t handle knowing something like this. This is too much responsibility. Especially when my mind is filled with dark thoughts. 

I’m sorry. I’ve currently stopped daydreaming. I’ve come up with tons of distractions to focus in the moment. Even though there’s nothing more I’d love to do than making every bad persons life miserable, I keep it to a minimal. Giving karma back to the assholes I think about. 

If this falls into the wrong hands, we could all be doomed. I wish I could say much more but I can’t risk it. There’s a specific feeling you need to feel in order to manifest. I still feel it and I can’t stop feeling it. It’s like I cant explain it but I can at the same time almost like you’re

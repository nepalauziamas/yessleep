JJ had Vader in a chokehold, his legs kicking as he attempted to break free. He was cramming a kitchen knife down the dogs throat, twisting it around as blood pooled in his mouth and poured out the sides. 

As he retracted the knife, Vader spat blood across the kitchen floor as he attempted to bark, the life fading from him.

“OH, MY GOD! JJ!” I bellowed in terror before he could plunge the knife back in.

His head whipped around towards me, the dog still in his clutch and the bloodied knife in his grip. I wanted to run over, grab the knife and smack him to the ground.

But I couldn’t, I couldn’t move as if I was locked to the ground. I just couldn’t believe what I was seeing.

“What?! What happ— Oh, my god!” My husband cried as he barreled downstairs.

He rushed past me, ripped the knife from his hands, slammed it on the counter, and then lifted the dog into his arms. He looked down, tears welling in his eyes as Vader attempted to whimper, his wriggling slowing. 

He lifted his head, shifting his gaze towards JJ. His eyes ignited as if he was about to tear our son to pieces.

“… WHAT HAVE YOU DONE?! WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU?! WHAT IS *WRONG* WITH YOU?!”

JJ’s head darted back and forth between us, before he took his notepad and pencil out of his pocket.

“He wouldn’t stop talking.”

My husband and I turned to each other, terror in my eyes and fury in his. We locked JJ in his room and told him not to move till we got back. 

We flew to the vet, hoping that they could do something to save him. When we got there, it was too late. The doctors told us the incisions and internal bleeding were too bad, and his lungs were filling with blood. 

The only option was to mercifully put him down. There wasn’t even much time to say goodbye.

The ride home was dead silent, and I knew this feeling all too well. I felt like I did back in that moment, after I heard the word that changed everything. Back in that waiting room, that limbo. 

I just couldn’t make any sense of it. We never exposed him to any violence. I thought maybe that’s why, maybe we made him inhumane by shielding him from the outside world. 

Maybe he was just inherently psychopathic, that he emerged from the ground as evil. I had no idea. All I knew was that this was still our son, and we had to do something about it.

When we arrived back home, my husband slammed the front door behind him and stomped upstairs, not a word said. I already knew it was up to me to talk to JJ about this.

I entered JJ’s room. He was tucked under his blanket, patiently waiting. His head lifted as I walked in, my cheeks stained with tears. 

I slowly walked over and sat down; I didn’t even know how to describe what he had done.

Suddenly, he grabbed his notepad and began writing.

“Where is Vader?”

I held back more tears, the knot in my throat tightening.

“Vader… isn’t coming back.”

He continued to write.

“Why? Where did he go?”

I thought of ways to make this an easy blow. I knew of parents that would describe death to their kids as “they’re in a better place now.” 

And I wanted to do that, but this was beyond explanation or discipline. This was beyond a smack or a bite.

“You… You hurt him. You hurt him very badly. And… because of that… he’s no longer with us.”

He began writing again.

“Where did he go? I want to say sorry. Why can’t he come back?”

I had to turn away, a tear streaming down my face.

*Because you killed him. You fucking killed him.*

I quickly wiped the tear and turned back around.

“I’m sorry, bug. But he’s never coming back, he can’t. He’s gone forever.”

He lowered his head, the notepad and pencil loose in his grip. Then, he nodded, but I don’t think he actually understood.

“Alright, it’s time for bed.”

Suddenly, another tear snuck out of my ducts, and JJ leaned forward and wiped it away with his little thumb.

I smiled, looking down as I let out a mix of a giggle and a cry. I wiped the rest away myself, sniffled, and then kissed his forehead.

“Goodnight, bug.”

I turned off the light on the way out. As I made my way upstairs, I heard the faint sound of yanking zippers. As I opened our bedroom door, I saw my husband packing a suitcase. He didn’t even think to stop upon hearing me enter.

“What are you doing… ?”

“I have to go.”

“Wh- What? Go? Go *where?*”

“I don’t know. My parents, my sisters’, I- I don’t know. All I know is, I have to go.” He began cramming stuff into a duffel bag.

“What the fuck are you talking about? Are you *leaving me?* Is this it?”

He didn’t answer, didn’t even look up at me, just continued packing.

“Scott, look at me.” He continued to ignore me. “LOOK AT ME!”

“What— No, no! I’m not leaving you! I’m leaving *him!*”

“Him-… JJ?”

His silence was the answer.

“I- I get that was scary, but we-“

“We *what,* Jen?! What else is there to do?! That is not a *child!* That isn’t *our* child!”

“Don’t say that… yes he is!” I shook my head, tears welling again.

“Open your fucking eyes, Jen!” He pleaded, rushing over to me and meeting me eye-to-eye.

“I don’t feel safe here! He murdered our fucking dog!”

“He didn’t know-“

“Do you really believe that? Honestly, do you believe that? He bites, he smacks, and he kills. This is textbook fucking serial killer— a person is next!”

“Jesus, Scott! He’s not going to kill somebody!”

“And how do you know that?” He asked sternly, his gaze piercing into mine.

I swallowed roughly, tears streaming down my cheeks.

“Exactly… exactly.”

He returned to the bed and continued packing.

“So, what? You’re just gonna run off? Abandon me?”

“No, I’ll come back— once he’s gone.”

“That’s not fair…”

“Not *fair?!* What’s not fair is this— this *prison* you’ve locked me in!”

“Prison?!”

“Yes! This house has been a fucking prison ever since that… abomination came into our lives!”

“He’s not a—“

“My *God,* would you stop defending him! He can do no wrong in your eyes! And—…”

“And what, Scott? Just say it…”

He turned to me, a blend of scorn and despair in his eyes.

“… And that’s probably how he ended up this way.”

For a moment, I could do nothing but stare back, tears streaming down my face.

“… You’re gonna put all of this on me? As if you were a great fucking example?”

“I *TRIED!*”

“I DID, TOO!”

My face crumbled with tears, my knees buckling beneath me. We both broke into sobs, standing across the room from each other.

“I DIDN’T WANT THIS! I NEVER WANTED THIS!” I bellowed.

He rushed over and took me in his arms, my head on his shoulder as he caressed the back of my head.

“I just wanted a baby… I wanted that life with you…”

“I know… I know…”

“Please… don’t go… I need you…” I pleaded with a whimper, tears soaking into his shirt.

He fell silent as I gripped him tighter.

“Please…”

“… Okay. Okay, I won’t go.”

I pulled away, our teary eyes meeting.

“… But something has to change.”

I nodded, wiping away the tears.

“I know… I know…”

“This is—… This is our son. And he needs help.”

A part of my aching heart warmed to hear him finally say it.

“But what do we do?”

“We’ll figure it out, okay? We always do.”

I nodded again, laying my head against his chest.

“I love you so much, I hope you know that. I never wanted to leave.”

“I know…”

Later that night, after he fell asleep, I wanted to do some research. I had left my laptop downstairs, but on the way out, I yelped as I suddenly saw JJ standing down the hallway.

“Jesus… ! What are you still doing up, bug? It’s way past your bedtime!”

But he just stood there and stared, leaving an unnerved feeling under my skin.

“C’mon, let’s get back to bed.”

I put my hand on his back and walked him downstairs. I wondered how long he was there and if he had heard anything. 

As I was tucking him into bed, he suddenly grabbed his notepad and began writing. I thought he was going to say goodnight or something, until he turned it around.

“What’s an abomenayshun?”

Fuck. He heard. I thought to myself.

“… Nothing, JJ. It’s nothing. You have to go to bed now.”

He began writing again, but this time I took the pad and paper from his hands and placed them on his nightstand.

“I said bedtime. Now.”

He stared at me for a moment, as he had never really heard this tone from me. He then laid down and turned over, facing the wall away from me. 

My instincts wanted to say sorry and hold him tight, but maybe my husband was right. Maybe a part of this is my fault.

Before going back up, I grabbed my laptop and made my way upstairs. My husband was already asleep, so I gently crawled into bed and opened up the computer. As the typing cursor flashed on the browser, my fingers trembled above the keys.

“How do I know if my child is a psychopath?”

Upon hitting enter, dozens of articles popped up about early signs of psychopathy. I sunk my teeth into a handful, trying to see if I could match up traits to JJ. 

He lined up with symptoms of violence, but he was honest and remoreseful. He wanted to apologize for what he had done to Vader.

My brain was cramped as I tried to put him in a box. I thought maybe “sociopath,” but that didn’t fully line up either. I pinched and rubbed my temples as I mind-numbigly scrolled from article to article. Eventually, I needed to stop or else I would’ve thrown up at the sight.

Everything seemed to point at therapy, to nip it in the bud while you can. I just didn’t know how to explain him to a therapist, we’d have to lie. But it needed to be done, I had to figure it out.

The next day, I talked with my husband and we agreed to start searching for child therapists. We needed the right one to help with JJ’s violent tendencies. 

We thought maybe we could tell them that the pumpkin is a mask and he prefers to keep it on; something weird that kids would do.

As we searched, it was nearing Halloween again. On the eve, I was up in the morning with my husband as he was getting ready for work.

“They said they’re gonna keep me late tonight, I might not be back till tomorrow,” he said as he fastened his tie.

“What? But our tradition, babe.” I frowned.

“I know… They really need me at the office.”

I stood up and hung my arms around his neck as he stood in the mirror.

“I’m gonna miss you.”

“I’m gonna miss you, too.” He brushed down the wrinkles of his shirt. “Alright, I gotta run. Love you,” he turned and kissed me.

“Love you, too.”

I watched with a weak smile as he flew out the door. I then walked downstairs and saw JJ at the kitchen table doodling.

“Hey, bug. Didn’t think you’d be up so early.”

He looked up at me before putting the crayons down and picking up his notepad.

“Breakfast.”

“You want breakfast? Sure, bud. Pancakes or waffles?”

“Waffles.”

“Good choice.” I smiled.

I popped the waffles in the toaster and poured him a glass of orange juice while he waited. As I placed it down in front of him, I peeked at what he was drawing. I smiled warmly as I saw he was drawing our family. 

“Me,” “Mommy,” and… “Scott.” 

My brows furrowed as I turned to him.

“No, JJ, that’s Dad. You call him Daddy.” I tapped on the paper.

He looked at me before turning back to the paper and scribbling it out, writing “Daddy” underneath instead. I smiled before stepping away, the waffles had already popped out of the toaster.

Later that day, I was in the garage digging through dusty boxes to find our Halloween decorations. As I pilfered around, JJ appeared in the doorway.

“Hey, bug. Wanna help me pick out Halloween decorations?”

He nodded and trotted over, wrapping his hands around the edges of the box as he peeked into it.

“We have these creepy spiders, these skulls, and— oh, look!” I lifted a fake pumpkin. “It’s you!”

He stomped his feet in excitement, wagging his hands.

“You wanna put this one out?”

He nodded.

“Okay, you got it.” I smiled.

He’s been good recently, life’s been good. The incident with Vader still left a restlessness in our souls, but we could only move forward. I believed he was going to get better, I needed to.

That night, to celebrate the eve, I bought a bag of candy corn and told JJ we could watch a movie. I wanted to avoid anything with violence, so I chose “Casper,” a childhood favorite of mine. 

As we watched the movie, I watched him toss the candy corn into the void of his mouth. I still didn’t fully know if he could eat or if he merely wanted to mimic, but either way, he enjoyed it and that was enough for me.

After the movie ended, I tucked him into bed and gave him a kiss. I turned towards the clock and realized it was past 12.

“Goodnight, bug. Happy Halloween.”

He snuggled under the covers as I turned the light out, closing the door behind me. The next morning, I woke up with an internal sigh as I saw our bed was still empty. 

I usually never sleep alone, so the gap next to me felt like a void. I figured he’d be back in the middle of the night; it was odd that they kept him till the next morning.

Must’ve been important, I thought.

I yawned as I dragged my tired feed downstairs, JJ still seemingly asleep. I brewed a cup of coffee that I wanted to inject directly into my veins before I crashed onto the couch and turned the TV on. 

My husband's long absence irked me, so I lifted my phone and began typing.

“Hey. They really got you locked up on Halloween?”

After a few minutes, no reply. I pursed my lips, tapping my nails against my phone. I was sure he was probably fine, but it was still an itch I couldn’t scratch. They’ve never kept him this long. 

I waited a few more minutes, but still no reply. I decided to call but was met with his voicemail. I thought maybe he was still driving home— bad Halloween traffic or something.

Later, JJ eventually woke up, and he emerged from his room with no pajamas on, just his underwear.

“Good morning, happy Halloween! Is that your costume?” I giggled.

He paused for a moment before nodding.

“Did you stain your pj’s? It’s okay if you did, I can throw them in the wash.”

He took another pause before nodding again.

“Okay. You want breakfast?”

He nodded faster this time. I groaned as I stood up and made my way to the kitchen. Before I opened the fridge, I noticed a post-it note stuck to the door.

“Went out to my sister’s. Be back soon. Love you.”

I furrowed my brows as I read it.

*His sister’s? When has he gone to his sister’s for Halloween?*

I brushed it off, assuming that she probably needed help with putting decorations on the roof. Until I noticed the handwriting. I unstuck the note and held it closer, analyzing the words. It looked like my husband's handwriting… almost. 

As if somebody who had seen him write before attempted to forge it. But he probably came home late into the AM, got no sleep, and wrote the note quickly. I didn’t think it was anything to look too deeply into.

I turned back to JJ, who I realized was staring at me.

“… Sorry, bug. I’ll get started on your breakfast.”

I opened the fridge and pulled out a carton of eggs, a puzzled expression still on my face. After making JJ’s breakfast, I grabbed my phone off the coffee table and texted my sister-in-law.

“Hey, Gina. Is Scott still there? He left a note but I haven’t been able to get in touch.”

I anxiously tapped my screen till I saw the responding text bubble.

“I’m sorry? Scott wasn’t here. Did he say he was?”

Suddenly, everything felt like it had gone mute. I stared at the text over and over again to make sure I was reading it correctly. My first thought was that he was cheating on me. 

Our sex life has been practically extinct since my diagnosis, I wouldn’t be surprised if he ended up looking somewhere else to “fulfill his needs.” 

But why lie and say you’re at your sister’s? He had to have known I’d ask. He’s not stupid enough for such a flimsy alibi.

Then, I looked up at JJ, who was still shoveling scrambled eggs into his mouth. I thought… No, it couldn’t be. My husband was a grown man and JJ was a child, it wasn’t possible. He wouldn’t hurt his own father… Right?

I didn’t know what to think or how to feel, so I waited. As the sun began to set, the trick-or-treaters were out like a tidal wave. And I was growing anxious by the minute, to the point that I was ready to call the police.

I stood by the window, chewing apart my fingernails as I waited to see him pull up, walk through the door and apologize for being so late.

Suddenly, JJ appeared next to me, putting his hands on the window. He began pointing at the trick-or-treaters.

“I’m sorry, bug. You can join them when you’re older.”

He turned to me and cupped his hands.

“… You wanna hand out candy again?”

He nodded pleadingly.

I thought about it for a moment, and how it went last time. But to my own fault, I wasn’t supervising him.

“Okay… You can hand out candy— but, I’m gonna sit outside with you and you’re going to behave. Okay?”

He nodded excitedly.

“Alright, wait here for a minute. I have to go grab the bucket from the garage.”

Suddenly, as I went to step away, he grabbed onto the back of my shirt.

“What’s up? Do you need something?”

He didn’t grab his notepad, just stared up at me.

“Are you hungry?”

He nodded quickly.

“Alright, I’ll whip you something up. Let me just grab the bucket first, okay?”

Then, he gripped tighter as I tried to walk away.

“You’re not starving, bug,” I laughed. “I promise I’ll make you something, Mommy just needs to do this real quick.”

But he wouldn’t let go.

“JJ, stop. This isn’t funny.”

He refused to budge. I ripped my shirt from his grip and walked away, confusion painting my expression. As I opened the garage door, the confusion on my face began to twist. My husbands car was in the garage.

He… came home?

As I got closer to the car, I peeked through the backseat window. My eyes widened as my blood ran cold; there was a bloodied hacksaw laying on the backseat— it was from my husbands tool rack. Then, I shifted my gaze toward the driver's seat, realizing he was there. I could see the shoulder of his shirt, but not much else.

“Scott… ?”

I slowly walked over as my body tremored. Then, I backed away till I hit the wall, clamping my mouth to contain the scream of terror as I saw his headless body in the driver's seat.

“Oh, my… God!” I squeezed out of my tightened throat.

I couldn’t believe what I was seeing, I nearly fainted. Suddenly, I turned my head and saw JJ had entered the garage. I stared at him in horror, like the abomination my husband had said he was.

“… WHAT DID YOU *DO?!* WHAT’S WRONG WITH YOU?!”

I trembled as I watched him take out his notepad and begin writing.

“You asked for help with decorating. Now Daddy isn’t frowning anymore.”

Then, I heard gasps of awe from outside. I ran past JJ and towards the front door.

“Oh, my god!” “It looks so real!” I heard from out on the porch.

I swung the door open, seeing my neighbor and her two kids kneeled, staring at something.

“Wow, Jen! You really went all out this year! How much did this cost?!”

I walked out and had to contain my horror as I saw my husband's decapitated head on our front porch. His eyes were gouged out, his nose sliced off in favor of a triangular hole, and a jagged smile cut from ear to ear. JJ had turned him into a Jack-O-Lantern.

“I- Uh- Yeah, it was definitely a dent,” I laughed awkwardly. “Scott really wanted it, though. Thought it’d be hilarious.”

My nerves fried as they leaned closely— I was terrified they’d realize it was actually him.

“I’m sorry about the candy, I was… just getting the bucket.”

Suddenly, JJ appeared in the doorway holding a bucket of candy.

“And who’s this little cutie?!”

“… My nephew, JJ! My sister-in-law just dropped him off, I have this little monster for the day.” I laughed painfully again.

“Well, aren’t you the cutest little pumpkin!”

He stared blankly back at her, the bucket still in his hands.

“He’s not much of a talker,” I whispered.

“Ah, well, I hope you two have a good Halloween!”

“Don’t forget your candy!” I exclaimed, looking down at JJ who extended the bowl toward them.

The two kids dipped their hands into the bucket and dropped a handful into their bags.

“And what do we say?”

“Thank you,” they said simultaneously.

“Happy Halloween!”

As they trotted off, my smile fell and my stomach churned. JJ walked towards the step and sat down, the bucket still in his hand. He turned his head to me and patted the empty spot next to him. I stared at him for a moment, I could tell there was fear in my eyes. 

Yet I sat next to him anyway. I set next to him and handed out candy for the rest of the night because a part of me still loved my son. A part of me that I just couldn’t seem to lose.

When the night ended, I threw up in the kitchen sink, tears pouring down my face. All I could think was that he was right, my husband was right the entire time. And he had to pay for it because I refused to believe. 

I loved my son, and now I had to kill him.

After I finished puking my guts out, I wiped my lips and washed my hands. Then, I turned around, jolting where I stood as I realized JJ was behind me. He lifted his notepad and began writing.

“What’s wrong?”

I almost laughed at the question. Everything was wrong, and I needed to end it. I smiled weakly as I slowly approached him. 

I kneeled down, getting one last look at his face. All I wanted was a child, and now I’m going to lose mine. Or maybe I already had.

“… Nothing’s wrong, bug. It’s bedtime.”

Then, I slowly lifted my trembling hands and wrapped them around his throat. I squeezed tightly, the notepad slipping from his grip as he reached to desperately grab at my arms, his legs flailing.

“It’s bedtime…” I cried with a breathless whimper.

I continued to tighten my grip, his skin blushing red. My face crumbled as tears soaked my cheeks. But it needed to be done. 

After what felt like an eternity, his flailing slowed to a stop, and he went limp in my grasp. I instantly let out a bloodcurdling wail, taking him into my arms and holding him tight.

“My JJ… My bug…” I sobbed.

My husband was gone, JJ was gone, and I felt unwhole again. 

I looked down at his lifeless body in my arms and thought of what my husband had said— that he was pitch-black inside. 

And if I wanted any form of closure… I had to know. I had to know what exactly my son was, because I didn’t know who he was anymore. I wondered if I ever did.

So I stood up, laid his body on the ground, and went to the kitchen. I opened the drawer and grabbed a knife, watching it shake in my grip. I hovered over his body with hesitance, but I needed to know. I kneeled down and rested his head on my thigh. 

As I raised the blade, I held my breath, before sinking it into his head. I let out trembling breaths as I sawed the knife through, cutting a circle around the stem. 

When I finished, I retracted it and dropped it next to me. I closed my eyes and took a deep breath, before pinching the stem and pulling it off. I leaned over and looked inside.

And there was… nothing. 

It was like a normal pumpkin, filled with stringy orange bits and seeds. No eyes, no throat— *nothing.* 

Then, I began to laugh. At first, giggling slipped past my lips before I dissolved into psychotic laughter. I dropped my back to the floor and rolled around, my gut cramping as I couldn’t stop. I just couldn’t believe it, I felt insane. 

At that moment, it felt like I hadn’t left the doctor's office. 

That I was still in that waiting room. 

That limbo.

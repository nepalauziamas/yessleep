Our monthly stroll by the mall was the only thing that ever gave me a sense of normalcy in my former life.

Mom would dreamily and slowly walk by every store, contemplating the lives she would never get close to live. We watched brand new toys, shiny bracelets and a world of silk and wonder – a world that would never exist for people in our social standing.

It took me a while to understand that the trips were for her own sake, not mine.

*“Your daughter could be a model, you know?”*

The smiling man approached us when we were having our ritualistic ice cream – we couldn’t afford anything there but the once-a-month sweet treat.

I’ll admit I have unique looks. My hair was always jet-black, even as a child, contrasting with pale complexion and emerald eyes. I had, indeed, fantasized about being a model when I grew up, after seeing so many advertisements in the mall, all of them containing huge images of stunning ladies, surrounded by perfume bottles and jewelry, and dressed in daydreams.

*“My husband… he…”* Mom started to shyly answer, but the man cut her off. He probably went through that dozens of times.

*“Why don’t I give you my card and you call me after Dad allows it?”*

His smile grew wider. So wide you could see something underneath, but as a 7-years-old, I couldn’t pinpoint what.

She agreed.

That night, I pretended to sleep and overheard them.

*“How much did he offer you, Janet?”* dad asked, aggressively as usual.

*“N-nothing”* she stuttered. In his presence, she always did.

He slammed his huge hands against the counter.

*“You’re lying! I know how those things work!”*

*“I-I swear, Bradley. He just told me to call”.*

*“So call him, dammit!”*

*“Just like that?”*

*“What do you want me to say? We can’t afford it anymore. I’m not even sure the damn prick is mine. You used to be quite the whore”.*

*“I-I just had one other boyfriend before you, Brad”*, her voice now sounded teary and hurt.

It took me a few years to understand what he meant. The bastard. I looked exactly like him.

They fell silent, so silent that I could hear dad sipping from his bottle. Mom dared speaking.

*“So you want to give her away?”*

Another slam.

*“Don’t be dumb. Who’s talking about giving? We’re selling it”.*

*“But you know they probably will…”*

*“That’s none of my fucking business, Janet”.*

\*\*\*

The next morning, Mom asked me to wear my favorite dress and pack my best clothes. It was easy because I didn’t have many that could be considered good.

*“Where are we going, mom?”*

*“Modeling”*, she answered in a rushed tone, her smile faltering. *“We’ll see that nice gentleman from yesterday”.*

We took the bus because dad didn’t let her drive – said she was too dumb for it. He, on the other hand, was almost always too wasted to control a wheel. Our decadent Chevrolet Vega sat in the garage collecting dust.

Dad made sure to be there to see that mom didn’t hide any money from him. He didn’t let her work, so he knew that if she handled the transaction alone, he would probably never see her again.

Everything was quick. The gentleman was named Mr. Carson, and his slightly chubby hand gave my parents a firm handshake, then handed me a lollipop. He took a few pictures of me, said everything was good, and gave my parents the money; it seemed to be more than they expected.

*“Damn, if that’s the price we should make a new one”*, dad exclaimed, his yellowed fangs opening up in a smile for the first time in years.

Mom bit her lip and buried her face on her only coat, a beaten-up pinkish parka.

She stroked my hair, tearing up silently, and we parted ways.

Mr. Carson took me to his house. His car was brand new and he let me pick the song. The drive was so different from the ones with my parents; the songs were always filled with screams: dad cursing at the other drivers, Mom begging him to not pick a fight, him telling her to shut up. If he was in a really bad mood, he would lock me in my room and leave me without dinner because I was breathing too loud or couldn’t hold back my tears while they fought.

The place was a suburban, generic middle-class house, white picket-fence style. It was gorgeous for a humble girl like me. He parked.

*“What we’ll do now, Mr. Carson?”* I asked, afraid he would hit me for being snoopy.

*“Please, call me Ted. I’m taking you to your room. Soon it will be lunchtime, but I have a task for you first”*, I looked at him obediently. *“I left a videotape in your room’s TV. Please watch it and, during lunch, act like the girl you’ll see. Got it?”*

*“Sure, Ted!”* I was overjoyed my room had a TV.

I diligently watched the tape, then after around two hours Ted took me downstairs to have a light lunch, consisting of sandwiches and soda. I did my best to imitate the girl.

*“You’ve done well, Delilah. This is your name now, got it?”*

I nodded. I don’t remember the name I had before.

*“I’ll put on another tape for you, but you can use the afternoon to relax too. Take a nap if you want. You’ll have a lot of tasks tonight”*, he said, taking me back upstairs.

That night, while I prepared for dinner, I was confident in my skills. Ted left me a brand new change of clothes, and told me dress up nicely; it was a special occasion.

On the dining room, stood an older woman. She was beautiful, and looked remarkably like me. Her eyes sparked up when she saw me, wearing a pretty tutu dress.

*“Delilah!”* she hugged me tightly then, still not letting go, stared at Ted. *“How did you do it? They’re almost identical”.*

*“I was lucky”.*

Over dinner, they explained to me why I was there.

Ted and Laura had a daughter named Delilah who died at 15. It was a painfully silly death; she insisted to go to a pool party and drowned. Most people around were drunk teenagers – too drunk to help.

Their world was destroyed; they couldn’t accept losing their only child, the light of their life. She was such a good girl, and now she was gone by such a stupid reason. So they decided to look for a new one – a girl that looked like the original Delilah and could mimic her demeanor.

They were so good to me. Laura loved me to bits, and Ted spoiled me rotten. I was a true princess, living a make-believe life. I went to a great school, we had amazing family trips together, my toys and clothes were always the best, the trendiest, the coolest.

It was easy to become their perfect daughter once I practiced a little. Delilah never had to beg for a cup of water or be trapped inside a dark closet because she was listening to the TV too loud. As long as I learned everything about the original Delilah and could act like I was her, the world was mine.

Until I turned 12.

Ted and Laura said they needed to talk with me. I was ready to be send back home, to the horrible, hopeless life I had before.

*“You know, Delilah… our other Delilah was perfect, but she had a serious problem”*, Laura started.

*“She grew up. She grew apart from us. If she never insisted on making her own decisions, on going to that damn party, she would still be here with us”* Ted was grinding his teeth. *“We can’t let that happen to you”.*

I admit I thought they would kill me to preserve my youth and innocence. But Ted had other plans.

*“Your father is a very good scientist. He can fix you”.*

I consented, still unsure of what needed to be fixed. But I wanted to be with them, and I want them to be happy.

The three of us went to the basement and Ted wired me to his machines.

*“You’ll be young forever, my Delilah”.*

*“Let’s hope it works this time”*, Laura added, uneasily.

The last thing I remember before being hit by a bolt of endless pain was understanding that there were other surrogate Delilahs before me.

\*\*\*

I thought I would never speak again from the pain.

I felt my bones shattering into a million pieces and reforming back all wrong; rinse and repeat.

My body was an endless puzzle consisting of a billion pieces that nothing could put back together. My limbs literally swam in a pool of despair – metallic despair. It was my own blood.

I was nothing but a pile of organic matter for days. I was as much a daughter as I was a guinea pig. Floating, infinitely floating in his lab fluids.

Until somehow everything was assembled again.

I woke up in my bed. Both Laura and Ted were by my side.

There was a sharp pain in the back of my neck, but other than that, nothing at all. They kissed my hair, begged for forgiveness and asked how I was.

I was, as crazy as it sounds, fine. The hours of infinite aching were distant now, almost like they happened to someone else.

I ran my fingers through my neck and felt something different there. I asked if they could see anything. Ted gasped.

*“It’s a new bone”.*

The new bone was small, but shaped like a thorn. It prickled my finger, but didn’t really hurt me.

Two years went by. While the other girls my age were quickly growing up in height and shape, I never fully developed into a teenager. It was clear that something was different with me.

Ted and Laura were overjoyed to notice I was still childish in mindset and looks. It had worked, after all.

I didn’t mind it. Maybe puberty was nice to others, but not to most; a lot of my classmates had awful breaks of acne, and talked in irregular, weird tones of voice. One girl even had a boob way bigger than the other. I was happy being a child instead of a train wreck.

Others weren’t so happy.

*“Why the hell your looks don’t change? Are you a fucking witch?”*

It was Sandy, the tallest girl in class. She was a troublemaker, and she had picked me as a target because I was too short and my skin was too clear.

I just tried to unleash my arm from her, I swear. I don’t like fighting. But I ended up crumbling her ulna and radius.

It happened in an instant and it was so crazy. I merely grabbed her wrist and felt everything inside collapsing.

Sandy cried desperately, her arm swelling and looking like rubber, while shards of bones erupted from the skin. It was nauseating seeing what was left of her bloody mass of bones.

Nobody understood what happened, and everyone ruled out as impossible that such a small girl could cause this damage to a strong and tall bully. The school nurse called the hospital while saying that Sandy must have fallen in a weird way.

That day, I felt the thorn-like structure in my neck burning like crazy. When I told Ted, he took me to the lab to perform a few tests.

“It appears that, as a side-effect, you became extremely strong” he said, after a few hours.

“But why I didn’t crumble anything else before?” I asked.

“How did you feel when this girl Sandy tried to pick a fight with you?”

“Very annoyed”.

“Well, then your strength is probably triggered by negative emotions”.

I considered the information for a few seconds. It made sense; my life was so perfect that, ever since I underwent the procedure to stay young forever, I never had a bad experience – or, at least, not the kind that would make me easily break something as sturdy as a human bone.

A few weeks after we discovered my superhuman-angry-strength, I finally understood that dad thought he was selling me to prostitution – and he was totally okay with it.

After hurting my mother in ways I’ll never know and understand, after hitting me and starving me over nothing, he thought that handing a 7-years-old – his only daughter – to an unknown man was perfectly normal; if she was going to be sexually enslaved, it was none of his business.

This thought made me feel very annoyed.

I just rang the doorbell of my former home[.](https://www.reddit.com/r/PPoisoningTales)

Who would believe that a teenager too small for her age could turn a grown man’s limbs to dust?

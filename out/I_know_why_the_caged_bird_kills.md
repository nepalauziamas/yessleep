I first started sharing my story yesterday in the post titled [Feathers in the Attic](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/vngwif/feathers_in_the_attic/). Be sure to read that one before you dive into this second part of my nightmare. Thank you!

*Welcome to Sparrow Mental Healing Center*

They never thought to change the sign. The white paint is flakey, worn. The wooden post looks like a stick of rotting driftwood. My heart is stone as I drive past it, following the gravel path to the parking lot. I try not to think about the iron gates and barbed wire fence.

I park, get out, walk over to the main entrance. It’s a four-story hospital building, much in need of a fresh coat of paint. My anxieties bubble as I step inside the foyer, childhood memories flooding my thoughts. It all looks exactly the same. The linoleum floors, fluorescent lights, the wooden reception island in the middle of the room.

“Can I help you?”

I snap out of it.

Despite the similarities, a lot has changed since my last visit. The desks are lined with modern computers, tablets. The girl behind the desk is about my age, young and fresh faced. Her name tag reads ‘Elaine’.

“Hello, my name is Ava Fugler. I am here to see my sister, Robin Fugler.”

The young receptionist types something into the computer in front of her, brows furrowed at the screen as the middle-of-nowhere internet struggles to load the database.

“Ah, there we go,” Elaine gives me a smile, “She’s on the second floor of the recovery wing. Room 208. Looks like today is the first day she’s accepting visitors.”

I already know this because Robin’s doctor called early this morning. I’ve been staying at a motel, drinking myself half to death every night. It’s the only thing that stops the memories of my childhood, my town, my father’s house. I’m surprised I answered the phone at all. I’ve been ignoring Jonah’s calls.

Elaine gestures to the stairs. I nod and walk toward them, trying to remain steady as my hungover brain shakes the world around me. I turn the corner, and grab onto the railing to steady myself. I want to throw up.

A tall, faded figure flickers before me, climbing these same stairs, dressed in a white robe. My sister, small in this memory but still recognizably herself, tugs at the figure’s sleeve, whining some childish nonsense as the figure pats the top of her head gently.

“Are you okay?” It’s Elaine, she’s got her hand on my shoulder, batting a pamphlet at my head, “Do you need me to call you a doctor?”

“No,” I sputter, standing up straight, “I’m sorry. I’m just a little hungover.”

“Oh,” a flash of judgement before the receptionist smoothes her features and takes a step back, “Are you sure you should be seeing your sister in that condition?”

“Yeah,” I say, turning to take the stairs on my own.

The second floor hall is eerie, quiet. There is no bustle of nurses, medical equipment beeping, no utensil trays jangling. Just doors with numbers. Again, memories tug on the fringes of reality, threatening to pull me in deep. I can remember my father marching down a hall just like this one, cursing under his breath, pulling me along with a force entirely unnecessary, considering how small I was.

I collect myself enough to find room 208 and enter.

A sense of relief washes over as I see my sister sit up to greet me with a small smile. Gone is the zombie glaze of an abandoned stranger. That first rush of relief is followed by guilt at the fact that I didn’t notice all this a week before.

“Can you believe we’re back here?” I ask the wallpaper to my left as I sit down on the other end of the private room.

“I’m surprised you seem to remember it at all,” Robin’s voice is weak, but so uniquely hers I want to cry. Ever heard a voice that feels like home? Not the damaged home you grew up in, but the fantasy one you escaped to when things got rough? That’s what it’s like. God, how I’ve missed her.

“I remember everyone telling me something was wrong with mom’s head, which was why she couldn’t come home with us. Why she had to stay at this awful place. And then she disappeared and all talk of her was forbidden, so I still don’t know what the hell that was about. Especially given what we know about dad now.”

I say it all in one breath and my throat stings from exertion.

I have a proper look at Robin then, trying not to see traces of my mother in her place. My memories seem forgiving, and I just see a very thin, very tired looking girl. Robin sits with her knees at her chin, like she did as a kid, wrapping her arms around herself for comfort. A deep thought process pulls her brows together.

“Ava, I really don’t know much more than you do,” she beckons me closer and I walk over to sit on the edge of her gurney bed, “I can’t really explain everything that has happened since you left, or all that happened at night when you were still here. My memories are hazy and it seems like I’ve got a dose of ma’s old illness.”

“That doesn’t seem right,” I shake my head, feeling my gut wrench at her words, “Given what we know about dad, about our house. I just can’t believe she was really crazy. And I don’t think you are either.”

“I’d like to think you’re right, Ava,” Robin gives a tiny shrug, “But what do we even know about ma and pa? Nothing good. Nothing but damage.”

I stay for another hour, making the type of small talk we have used our whole lives to cope with our circumstances. There is a lot to confront, to discuss, but I don’t know how to face it. I’ve been trying to drink it away. Observing a blur of a world as you throw up in your bathtub is somehow easier than asking Robin the real questions.

What happened to her in that house, in that aviary?

What did our father do to our mother?

Why does our childhood home turn into a house of horrors every time the sun goes down?

The birds. I don’t even know how to formulate this question, but they’re everywhere. They’re in our names, in our old back yard, and now they’ve manifested in reality, or our version of it.

I’m five minutes out from my hometown when my phone buzzes for the millionth time. Poor Jonah. I don’t know how to answer, what to say. I’m not okay, but I don’t need his input right now.

I drive into the motel parking lot and cross the street to get to the liquor store. I appreciate the cashier’s lack of caring as they see me enter for the tenth time that week. I go over to the vodka aisle and stare at all the labels. I don’t know anything about booze, but I always buy the brand my father drank. It’s a sick little joke I have going with myself, one of the only things to make me laugh - or at least smirk - these days.

Today is different. As much as I want to forget, I know I need answers.

I leave the store feeling like I stole something because I didn’t buy anything. The cashier doesn’t bat an eye, they’ve probably seen the alcoholic limbo one too many times to care. I cross the street and get back in my car. I start the engine and drive along the familiar roads that lead back home.

It is late afternoon, which should put me at ease. It’s not night, after all. Still, the weather doesn’t help.  It’s raining a dull, heavy sort of rain, and the rental’s windshield wipers struggle to keep up. As the world in front of me grows hazy from the weather, familiar prickles run up and down my temples. I notice the hairs on my arms rise, and try to convince myself it’s the cold.

I park as far away as I can, which makes zero sense for a quick getaway, but lets me conjure an artificial sense of security. My thoughts race. What am I looking to find here? The bird in the aviary? Some sort of monster in the attic? It’s all so ridiculous. I imagine trying to explain all of this to Jonah and cringe.

I start with the tangible. The real world stuff. I move through the quiet entrance hall, up the littered stairs, and slowly make way to the end of the hall. I stand in front of the door to my father’s room, somewhat in stupor. My limbs still hold the childish fear I had of this man, of his dwelling. In my short life, I don’t ever remember going inside this room, and not just because I wasn’t allowed to.

My breath stills as I push the door open.

I struggle to release it as I walk inside. There is no boogeyman, no blood dripping off the walls, no smashed bottles, no wreckage. Countless dirty footprints form in the dust circles on the floor. These must be from the cops who were here to investigate my mother's murder case. If there is anything to find, they surely would have done it by now.

Why am I even here?

I look up from the floor, willing my eyes to find more signs of life. This place is the most stripped down, basic bedroom I have ever seen in my life. A single bed with brown sheets, some slippers, a cupboard, a writing table. No pictures on the walls. No curtains on the tiny window.

I still can’t calm down. Blood rushes to my head, and I realize I probably should have hydrated better. I feel miserable, terrified by default. It is always the same with this house. I give myself due pause for self pity before moving on.

I walk over to my father’s writing table and pull the old wicker basket chair out. I sit down and start going through the empty drawers. Dust patterns reveal a myriad of missing objects. Notebooks, letters, books, stationary - all taken by the cops. I shut the middle drawer and prepare to move on to the last one when I hear a thud upstairs.

My entire body tenses. Ignoring the drumming song inside my chest, I stare up at the thin ceiling that separates me from the attic. I let a good five minutes pass as I inspect the yellowing cracks.

Nothing.

I pull out the last drawer to the sound of another thud, louder this time, right above my head. Although my body has broken out in cold sweat, I try to focus on the task at hand. This last drawer is similarly empty, but something is off. I run a finger over the dust as another two thuds circle overhead. It now sounds like the footsteps of a very large, very heavy person walking right above me.

I pull back to inspect the table, trying to latch on to a gut feeling my thoughts haven't quite caught up to. I look at the drawer sizes. The last one is a deep drawer, designed for hoop folders. I look at it again, and it is definitely deeper than the other two, but maybe not quite as deep as it should be.

I keep darting my eyes back and forth, trying to measure the drawers as the room starts to grow dark. I could’ve sworn it was only three o’clock when I arrived, but it seems that time has sped up to welcome an early sunset for my benefit. Above my head, the footsteps are joined by a very gentle, very quiet flutter of wings. A warning. No. A command to leave, but I am not finished.

Not yet.

I lean over to inspect the bottom of the last drawer. The edges line up perfectly, but I am convinced there is a false bottom. As I scramble to figure it out, the house grows darker and louder all around me. I think of my poor sister living here for years on her own, of the impact it had on her sanity, and my vision clouds over in tears.

If there is a false bottom it doesn’t let up. I consider going downstairs to fetch a kitchen knife, but the derelict state of the ground floor and the approach of darkness make it a little more than I can handle.

Instead, I run over to the doorway and try to flip the lights on, only half-hoping the old bulb above will work. It doesn’t. If I don’t get a move on, I will be trapped in a pitch black house with nothing but an unreliable phone light for company.

I  walk back to the writing table, my anger rising. Fuck my father. Fuck this house. Why the fuck am I here? I kick the bottom drawer in exasperation and feel the underside move.

All hell breaks loose as I dive to the floor, pushing up the bottom board to find my father’s secrets. The wings have long ceased to be flutters, and are now a storm of violent beatings, just like the ones Robin and I received at the hands of the man that lived inside this room. The monster who hurt those closest to him, who kept secrets in hidden drawer compartments.

It is pitch black now and the air grows so thick and hot that I can barely breathe. My fiddling fingers are intuitive, meticulous in their work. The same blood that runs through his veins, runs through mine. His damage is my damage. His secrets are my secrets, and nothing can stop me now.

Finally, I manage to tilt the board and a light thump indicates an object dropping to the floor. Blind but agile, my hands find and grab it. Without a second’s hesitation, I get up from the floor and turn to run from the house.

My stomach sinks as a flickering light turns on in the hallway as I reach the doorway. Above my head, the footsteps and wings begin to die down as the house falls entirely silent. A small whimper escapes my throat as I realize the dangers of the invisible, the quiet.

I need to run, but my legs are slow and jumpy as I creep through the hallway. The familiar doors of my childhood stand ominously ajar, giving me glimpses of blackhole rooms. I try to focus on moving straight ahead, but my body seems to be regressing to that of an infant.

Eventually, I reach the head of the stairs, willing myself to dash down, to get to safety. As I am about to take the first step in my descent, I hear a low laugh echo from the direction of my [childhood bedroom](https://www.reddit.com/r/peculi_Dar/comments/vnkyf3/feathers_in_the_attic_series_hub/).

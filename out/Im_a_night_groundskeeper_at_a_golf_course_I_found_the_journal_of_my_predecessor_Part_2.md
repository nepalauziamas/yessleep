Hey guys I’m back! Sad to say I’m not dead yet, though I have been taking some time off to be with the family. I would fill you guys in on that, but I know the boring mundanities of my everyday life aren’t what you guys are here for.

I have to say, that last entry was a doozy. Suffice to say I didn’t get much sleep after that shift. I did, however, start to wonder about what he had said towards the end. The part about running away like back when he was a child getting chased by imaginary monsters up the basement steps.

In the moments I was reading it and more than a few after, I was scared. I felt the same sensation of fear and anxiety in the same way he had described it. Though, when I got home I started thinking. We run up the stairs fast just to get away from the darkness that we ourselves created. 

We were the ones to switch off the light thus allowing darkness to seep in. Then, like children, we seek shelter from the very monsters we’ve let loose. Even though it was us that paved the way for them to invade our thoughts and minds. 

I thought back to when I was a kid and was faced with that same dilemma. I thought I was a clever child so I did what I think most of us would have had the idea to do some time or another. Just keep the light on. Just don’t touch the light switch and the monsters would be kept at bay. I wouldn’t have to release them and in turn be frightened up the stairs.

This worked for sometime. That is until I found out that I wasn’t always in control of whether the monsters would be at my mind's gate or not. Sometimes, I wonder if I ever was. 

That day I learned that the light switch had about as much power as I did. That is to say, none in the least. That was the day that the light bulb burnt out.

Now, I’m not sure exactly what I’m trying to say or even why I’m writing this to you guys. Maybe it’s a metaphor for life haha! More likely just an old man trying to make sense of something he hasn’t felt since he was a child. 

Anyway, let's get into the meat and potatoes of the post. This next entry is written as follows:

*I listened to the tape last night back at my place. It took me a few hours to find any pawn shop or thrift store that still had tape players on hand. I ended up finding one at the old Radio Shack across town. Talk about a blast from the past huh.*

*The tape was mostly the sounds of animals yelping and screaming. It sounded like they were being tortured or ripped apart even. It was chilling to say the least, especially since the only animal I’ve ever seen actually die right in front of me was at the zoo when they shot that gorilla.*

*I wanted to turn the damn thing off, but something told me I had to push through and finish it. About a minute in I could hear a deep breathy singing coming from far away. I couldn’t make out the words just yet. The animal's shrieks stopped on a dime as whoever was singing got closer to the tape recorder.*

*“Tra la la la, Tra la la la*

*Chop the wood to light the fire!”*

*I didn’t recognize the voice. What I did recognize was the utter enjoyment he had as he sang. I could hear the smile in his voice as he bellowed out the words of his strange tune. All of a sudden the tape came alive with the sounds of the forest, but it was all so very wrong.*

*Birds no longer chirped. They now shrieked in long and dissonant wails. The wind no longer whistled. Its soft song was now a raspy howl followed by the rough sounds of the trees it picked up. No longer rustling in the wind, no, they were full on fighting with wet and visceral punches assaulting my ears with every second the tape went on. The whole ensemble encapsulated me in a cacophony of the macabre.*

*I wanted to cover my ears. I wanted to run. I wanted to take that damn tape recording and slam it against the wall, the mere thought of the small electronic parts showering the table that I sat brought me a small comfort. I did none of this however. I needed to hear the rest until the very last of it.*

*Before I knew it the tape went silent and I was left alone with a ringing in my ears. I reached for the tape recorder until I heard a deep voice freeze me into place.*

*“You wouldn’t want to do that, Fry.” The voice said.*

*It was the same voice that sang that ghostly tune only moments earlier. Though now not from the mere playback device that sat on the table in front of me. I could feel his breath on the back of my neck.*

*“W-who are you?” I managed to spit out.*

*“Haha, I am the one who sings and I have a job for you, Fry.”*

*“I’m currently already employed and not looking to take on any extra hours, sorry.” I said in the most polite voice I could muster.*

*“Unfortunately for you, I must insist!” He hissed.*

*“You see, you have a spectacular baritone.” I could feel a sharp appendage tap my chest just over my heart.*

*“Hell, I think you might have the making to be my new first chair!” He bellowed.*

*I could see what looked like a long sharpened tree branch pull away from my chest and poise itself to strike. Just before it could I did the only thing I could think of doing. I went for the tape recorder and pressed the stop button just before whatever that was could sink its hands into my chest.*

*I fell out of my chair and on the floor. I frantically started looking around. My eyes searched for that thing that had been behind me. After I was sure I was again alone I got back up to find a small note laying on the table. Beside it was an old school pocket watch.*

*I picked up the watch and took a closer look. It looked to be gold and adorned with what I could only describe as runes of some sort. There were three buttons on the side of the watch all of which had different jewels attached. The leftmost was the same gold as the watch itself. The one in the center was a ruby. The one to the right of that was an emerald.*

*I put the watch back on the table and grabbed the note. It read as follows:*

*This trinket will help you. It is all I can provide for now and it should be enough. Find the woodsman. For you are now marked. He shall help mend what has been broken and cut away what has been affixed to you. Do not delay.*

*I crumpled the paper up and threw it away. Find the woodsman? More like find a new fucking job. I’m done. No more.*

*I grabbed my cell and punched in my boss's number. Whoever wrote that letter was right about one thing, I damn sure wasn't going to delay. I brought the phone up to my ear and my blood ran cold when I realized what I was hearing on the other end. It was that same damn song and the same voice singing it.* 

*I slammed the phone down on the floor, but I could still hear that damn singing. I started stomping on the phone trying to get it to stop. It took me only a few more stomps to realize that the singing wasn’t coming from the phone. It was coming from me.*

I leaned back in the squeaky office chair that had been my second home while I was at this damn job. I couldn’t believe what I had just read. It all seemed too much to be anything near real. I just wasn’t sure. I sure as shit wasn’t gonna go hunting for ghosts while I was here that's for certain.

I was curious though. I wondered what had happened to this guy. Fry I think he had written. Maybe I could do some light snooping around that. Maybe not.

After only an hour or two I found my eyes getting heavy and I let myself drift off to sleep. I was awoken by a bright light in my eyes and loud banging coming from the window.

“Sleeping on the job aye!” Levin called out.

“Just resting my eyes, sir.” I said lazily.

“Well perk up Martin. We’ve gotta job needs doing tonight.” He said with a grin on his face.

Now, Levin was my boss. He was a bit irritating to say the least. His excited and bombastic personality didn’t really fit his withered and old body. The man looked to be about 50, but he moved and talked like a 20 year old. I’m not sure how he moved as swiftly as he did with that prosthetic leg he wore. I wanted to ask him about it, but I couldn’t really find the words whenever I saw him.

Him being here was odd though. In all the time I’ve worked here Levin hasn’t as much as answered my calls much less pop up with more work for me to do. I wondered what could possibly need his attention, let alone mine, at this hour of the night.

“Whadya need man? The course is all closed and I’ve already done my rounds.” I said.

“Just come with me alright. I’ll tell ya on the way.”

Annoyed, I got up and started following Levin back down to hole 18. He walked a lot slower than usual though. He scanned the ground with his flashlight back and forth like he was looking for something.

“Well? You said you'd tell me on the way. What are we doing out here by the lonely hole anyway?” I asked.

I could see Levin steal a quick glance in my direction. Sorta like he was surprised at what I said.

“Just out here to scare some animals back into the woods. That’s all. No big deal.” Levin said.

“What time is it anyway man? It should only be about an hour or two until the course opens. Let the day shift deal with it.”

“Ahh, quit your whining. See it’s not even past 4 yet.”

Levin pulled out a watch from his pocket and shoved it in my face. I stared in disbelief at what I saw. I was looking at the exact same watch that Fry had described in his journal. All the way down to the multi-color gemstones.

“Nice watch.” Was all I could muster.

“Thanks, it was a gift.” 

“From who?” I asked.

“Doesn’t matter anymore.”

We finally made it to hole 18 and rounded the corner to get into the maintenance building. Levin told me he’d just be a minute and that I should wait outside. So I took a seat on the steps and thought about that watch. What are the odds that Fry would have described the same exact one in his journal. 

A bunny hopped in front of me while I was deep in thought. I could only see his left side but it looked to be a cotton tail. There was something familiar about it. Seeing the rabbit brought back memories of going hunting with my dad. I remember how excited I was to get my first kill. How sad I was when I realized I had only winged it. Not enough to kill, but not enough for it to go on living either.

I remember my dad telling me to be a man and finish what I had started. I took the rabbit in my arms and pulled out my knife. I could feel the weak thrusts of its hind legs as it tried to find footing on my arm. The soft wheeze as it took in labored breaths. The look of complete fear and surprise just as I plunged the knife deep into its throat.

The look! The eyes! That’s what's so damn familiar about it. I stood up as soon as I realized and just as I did the rabbit turned away from me exposing its right side. The side with the holes. Rotten with decay and pussed filled gray matter oozing from its head. I’m not sure how the damn thing was still alive with damn near half its body just… gone like that.

Another rabbit joined alongside it. Then a squirrel. Then a fox. Soon there were all manner of woodland creatures all in different stages of decay and death. It was safe to say I was beginning to believe what I had been reading.

I took a step back up the steps and bumped into someone. I nearly jumped out of my skin as I turned around to face them. It was Levin, he was grinning, and holding a shotgun.

“What's the matter Martin? You never seen a rabbit before?” Levin said as he took aim past me.

He let off shot after shot at the animals. None of which even acknowledge that he was killing them one after the other. They all just kind of stood there in some sort of trance. I just took a step behind Levin and let him do his thing.

After it was all said and done. Levin put the shotgun back into the maintenance building and began picking up the dead animals.

“What the hell was that?” I asked.

“Well Martin, it looks like you've just earned yourself a fine raise.”

Levin took out a wad of cash and threw it at me. I caught it and thumbed through it. It had to have been $20,000 in that stack alone.

“This’ll be the easiest six figure job you ever had. Just keep your mouth shut and do as you're told and it’s cake.” Levin pulled the sack of dead animals over his shoulder and began to walk back to the security booth.

“Oh, and keep reading that journal. Hopefully it’ll do a better job helping you then it did me.” He said, shaking his prosthetic leg as he walked away.

Levin told me to take the rest of the night off and made it home without incident. I tried pressing him for more info, but he just shook his head and said now wasn’t the time.

So I sit here and type this out. One tab on this site, the other on all the overdue bills, collections, and credit card debt I have. Imagine that everything paid with even more money on the way. I couldn’t pass this up. Even if I did die out there to whatever lurks on those 18 holes. I know I could at least pass it on to my kids.

With the journal I could maybe even get ahead of it all and stay safe and out of the way. Hopefully I could get more answers out of Levin if I ever see his ass again. For now I’ll keep you guys posted. I’m sure the next few entries of the journal will have more answers to my questions and maybe just a few of yours.

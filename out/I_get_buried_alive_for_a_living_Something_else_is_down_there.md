You ever wonder how those funeral homes stay open?

You know the type: faded signs out front, called something like Bartholomew & Sons, only staffed by three pale old men in ill-fitted black suits, open 364 days a year in a town of about 1,000.

They’ll tell you funerals are expensive. That they only need a few to pay the bills.

*Bullshit.*

There’s a reason all these tiny funeral homes can stay open, and I’m going to tell you.

Listen close. I’ll only say this once:

They call themselves the Next of Kin, and I’d say they have a hand in around 75% of funeral homes across the USA, Canada and the UK - whether that’s franchising, operating or major shareholders in. For every backwater funeral home you see, that’ll spin some tale about how they’re self-made and family-owned, there are hundreds of backroom meetings, money changing hands, men and women coming at strange times of the night to deliver coffins, crucifixes, embalming fluid.

In short, they’re everywhere.

Secrecy is preferred: no one wants their loved one's funeral run by a multinational corporation.

I’m telling you this for a good reason, because the job that I do only makes sense if you understand the broader context. You might not know about the Next of Kin, but Wall Street does, and a lot of important people have invested a *lot* of money in the corporation.

They have a reputation to uphold.

And so, if any scandals erupt around the world of funerals, coffins, you name it, their shares tank. All it takes is one horror story; one mother slips into a coma, gets identified as dead, then bitterly claws their way out the coffin and to the surface. Imagine the headlines. Imagine all that shaky, handheld footage going viral.

So that’s my job. They bury me in a coffin, and give me 2 hours to get out. I’m like a crash-dummy, but for coffins.

Anytime a new model comes out it’s my job to, well, take it for a spin.

But the past few burials, something has felt *wrong.* It started with a model they called the  *NOK: VENEER-225.*

It seems standard procedure to start, I have my usual equipment: a lighter, a help button, a hairpin. I insist on finishing my cigarette as I’m sat in the coffin, as the mechanical arm slowly moves it over the hole. Jake calls me an asshole, tells me that it’ll kill me. I look at the coffin: we both grin. Then, as per usual, I lie down, getting myself comfortable, and wait.

It takes about 10 minutes all in all; the lid, the earth heaped on top. I wait for a while, taking my time to breathe deep, mentally telling myself that this is not permanent, that worst comes to the worst there’s an easy way out. I go through this process each time, running through the motions of reassurance, making sure that I know that this isn’t forever. It’s my way of talking my body out of a panic, of making sure that whatever happens, my unconscious doesn’t kick into overdrive and leave me with a panic attack.

Then it’s the checklist: I push each corner of the lid, work the hinges with the hairpin, kick the sides as best I can. Nothing. I’m about to carry out the last few parts, and then let the guys know on the surface that this one’s secure, when I hear something. Something far off, I think, but large. You get used to the noises down here pretty quick: rats, moles, huge beetles, mice. There’s a sort of frenzied patter, their little legs working the dirt, and then a moment of silence, they assess the situation, whiskers or antennae twitch, and then they start again. Sometimes they’ll bump against the sides of the coffin, readjusting their course before moving on.

But something about this is different.

Now this might just be my brain getting overactive since I’m buried 6 foot deep in the pitch black, but whatever it is, it feels like it’s *looking* for something. And not in the same way animals hunt. There’s a seeming randomness to animals movements: something frantic to it, the tunnels they dig aren’t based off any blueprints, they’re shaky and curved and strange. But whatever this is, it’s moving with almost mathematical precision.

I can hear it clearly. Sound carries surprisingly well underground.

There is a shift, and then four scrapes, as if whatever this thing is is moving to a new location, and extending in several directions before moving. As if it’s intelligent, plotting a route. Looking for *something.*

I’ve still got things to do: the knee-test, the thump, hinge lock - but whatever it is seems to be getting closer. And it’s big. Bigger than a rabbit or a rat, you can tell by the sound of the earth shifting around it, like rainfall, rocks and dirt pouring into new space.

I press the button.

From the moment you press the button, until the moment you’re taken up, there are about 10 minutes. For the digger to move all that dirt, and the arm to pick you up, you’ve got to brace yourself for the reality that you will not see daylight, no matter how much you want, no matter how close you are to losing it, for ten minutes.

That’s what they tell you. Have your panic attack once you’re out, they say. Don’t have it on company time.

And so that’s how long I have to wait, hearing this strange, precise creature move around in the earth near me, shifting, *searching.* When they find me I’m covered in sweat, and have to take a moment to breathe once I’m out.

Jake says I look like I’ve seen a ghost. I tell him to go fuck himself.

*NOK: VENEER-229*

There it is again. Even though we’re miles from the last burial site. That scratching, the clawing. The seeming *thought* behind it all.

It makes its way towards me, I’m sure. And I swear, I swear, that this time I can almost *hear* its fingers. That’s what I’m sure they are. Long, desperate fingers.

&#x200B;

*NOK: POLY-C; 23*

I’m spending less and less time underground now. I run through the checklist as quickly as possible. I’ve still got to go down, I have rent to pay, medical bills, debts. Even before I’m done I press the button, desperate to get out, the air in the coffins becomes stifling and too hot, and I swear that whatever that thing is, it’s looking for me.

Nothing else makes a noise when it’s around. As if they’re scared. As they’ve already run away.

And it’s working it’s way through the tightly packed earth, through the silt and the shit and the roots, it’s taking it’s time.

It’s in no rush.

Time works differently underground.

*NOK: WOOD-127a*

This time I’m not quite fast enough. I don’t hear it for a while once I’m down, but that doesn’t do much to relax me. The coffin’s a little smaller than I’m used to, and I feel my neck twinge: the beginnings of a cramp. I’m trying to work into a position where my knees can be used to lever the bottom half of the lid off when I hear it.

That shift, the sound of multiple fingers working their way through soil.

It’s been waiting.

It’s adapted. Changed tactics: instead of just aimlessly moving around it’s waited at the place it left off, for what must be days on end, for me to be dropped back in.

It starts moving again, and this time it’s so close I swear to God I can hear it fucking breathing, these wet and ragged breaths that somehow echo from the material of the coffin so they’re all around me, filling up every single inch of air with the sound.

I’m hammering the button now, hoping that the more I press it the more that the people on the surface will realise that this is serious, that something’s wrong, but I’ve no way of knowing.

Then another noise echoes in the dark.

It’s not just the shifting of soil, but a *tap.*

One at first.

It waits. Studying my response.

Then three, in a slow and certain succession:

*tap  -  tap  -  tap*

I swallow. I can hear my throat contract, the sound of my heart hammering my ribs, and I am suddenly aware of the dense weight of the earth above me, all pushing down and onto the lid of the coffin, stones and roots and seeds all pressed so tightly together I can hardly breathe.

*tap - tap - tap*

It’s getting faster now. It knows it’s found the right thing, knows it’s found whatever it’s been looking for. I’m trying as hard as I can not to cry, not to scream or shout or just bang my forehead against the lid until it knocks me unconscious.

*tap-tap-tap-tap-tap*

Now it’s breath is speeding up, excited, gurgling, and I feel as if it’s pushing its face, or whatever it has that counts as a face, against the side, and that it’s breathing me in, my scent, my sweat, my fear. Not just tapping now but smooth sounds, the noise of someone running their hand along the side, searching for a weak point, an opening, a hinge. The sound of someone scratching the wood, pressing their weight against it.

In between the movements, there’s something stranger: a faint, whispered melody. It’s haunting, lilting; reminding me of the nursery rhymes my mother used to sing: soft and sad and beautiful. This half-singing, half-humming is getting louder with each moment, and I can’t make out any words but just the melody, that loops over and over on itself, as if whatever it is knows I can hear and-

It doesn't just sound like one voice anymore, but dozens, all half-singing the same tune, soft and ominous and building to something and-

It finds the hinge and I can hear it testing the metal, the thin scratching, and just as I’m about to scream, to completely lose my mind, I hear the familiar rhythm of the digger.

They’re here.

They find my face wet with tears, shaking.

Jesus, Jake says, what the fuck happened?

He offers me water. My hands are shaking too much to drink it, I shake my head.

I see his eyes go wide, and I turn around.

The side of the coffin facing us is covered in deep scratch marks, that have stripped the varnish from the wood and left pale stripes.

But that’s not what makes me feel as if I’m going to be sick. No, it’s what the scratch marks *say.*

There, carved into the wood of the coffin:

I need help.

I really don’t know where to start. I have to be quick, I don’t know what’ll happen if she finds out but I need you guys help. I don’t know what to do and I’m freaking out. It started a few days or weeks ago, I think? I came upon this TikTok video about a girl whose sister apparently is a psychopath and how they need help, it was crazy, like why would someone post a video instead of calling the police or something but I was curious. I know my curiosity will kill me someday. So I decided to check the account that time and I found out it wasn’t the first video the person posted, but what amused me the most was that she had the same interests as my sister which could happen, I know.

 Anyways, I followed the account before moving on to the next, and I was actually starting to  forget about it when I saw another upload. Her parents were apparently called into school because her sister brought a knife? Like wtf. And it was weird that my parents were also called the day before that day because Stacy, my little sister, cheated on a test, well at least that’s what they told me. It was still quite weird tho, so I showed it to my other sister, Kayla after. In which she replied that the account was really her. At that point I was already creeped out. She led me to Stacy’s room and under the bed was a knife. I couldn’t believe it, why would I believe my sister is a psychopath? 

But anyways, the next few days up until yesterday, I avoided my little sister like a plague, I know she didn’t deserve it, she was 10 for God sakes! But, if it really was true, which my older sister said it was, I couldn’t take any chances. My sister acted normally right after, like nothing happened, LIKE SHE JUST DIDN'T SHOW ME MY BABY SIS WAS A PSYCHO. I almost thought it was a dream and I would’ve thought that way if only I didn’t hear  Stacy and my parents talking. I couldn’t hear it clearly but I did hear, knife, hurt, harm and Kayla.

 I didn’t understand at that time, I wish I didn’t understand it now. Right now, It’s just me and Kayla, my parents are gone. And just a while ago, Kayla asked me to go to her room and find her notebook. When I came inside, there were clothes everywhere! But it was fine I guess until  I came upon this cloth that was bundled with something and curiosity sucks but I opened it, and there inside was a knife with blood in it.

I don’t know what to do. I am currently locked inside my room. I don’t know if she found out or not but I’m scared. What if I get hurt? What if I’m next. Afterall, I just received a call… Stacy’s dead.

Why, WHY! WHY DID THAT BITCH- never mind. It doesn’t matter. It’s all in the past. I mean not really, but seconds ago is still the past, am I wrong? But how did it turn out like this? Please spare some minutes and listen to what I have to say. This dilemma is... well yea.

We met in middle school. Classmates. At first glance, I fell in love. I guess it's what they call love at first sight. The window was open and the wind was gently brushing her long blond hair. The rays of sun reflected onto her pale and clear skin. Her dimples showed clearly as she smiled while talking to her friends. What an Angel. I came in the middle of the first year since my family had just moved to this town. So me sitting there, a stranger creepily staring at her seemed rather odd in the eyes of others. She turned her head and looked me in the eye. Took me a few seconds to even realize the situation I was in, thanks to her blue gemstones as eyes. I remember how she slightly tilted her head and raised one eyebrow since I wouldn't stop staring, probably smiling like a fool as well.

“Who are you?” Her soft voice brought me back to reality, and it made me blush rose red. Just as I was about to stutter out my answer, the teacher walked inside and I hurriedly stood up and went into the back of the classroom, straightened my back and looked forward. I wasn’t confident enough to look at her again. I heard some giggles coming from her direction, but I didn’t dare to look if it was actually her. That was our first meeting. Throughout middle school, we became close, really close. We didn't start dating until the summer break after middle school ended right before high school, but there were rumors already around even in middle school, since we were inseparable. We also lived really close to each other, basically neighbors. So after a while, even our parents became close. They were so delighted when we began dating. 

High school was different. Kids were older, to some degree more mature but also trying so much more to be cool, especially boys. I described her as an Angel, right? Well, I could be the opposite. I was a loser, a nobody, but I tried my hardest to live up to my name as her partner. So in high school, this pretty Angel of mine got a lot of attention and questions to why I was her spouse and not anyone else. Her answer was always the same.

“He was made for me, and no one else could replace him.” I trusted her. I knew boys drooled over her, but she would never do anything to them. There weren't any problems in my case with girls. No other girl other than my Angel wanted to be with me. The only problems were the boys, especially one guy that was interested in my Angel. 

Unbeknownst to my Angel's knowledge he bullied me, both physically and verbally. Telling me she's his and whatnot. He never hit me in the face, always on the body, so that she could never tell I was getting bullied unless I deliberately showed my wounds to her. I was scared to tell her. I wanted to, but I didn’t want to seem like a loser. Someone who couldn’t stand up for himself. There were times when she saw a few of my bruises, but I always came up with excuses, and they always seemed to work out. This spiral repeated itself for a long time. 

After we graduated from high school, we were still together. Nothing much changed other than my body stopped aching all day. She knew nothing. I had faked it so well, I could almost become an actor at this point.

We enrolled into the same college, to finally get away from high school and hopefully forget those years, at least in my case. Maybe she had a good time. But college is when it all started. At first we made a lot of friends. I was finally accepted for who I was, and people accepted we were dating. No trouble and no glances. It was all perfect.

But we all know that when you reach the highest highs, there is only one way to go and that's down. My parents passed away during the second semester of college. Which hit me hard. My Angel being there for me wasn’t enough for my satisfaction. Which it should’ve. I was just stupid and ignorant. So I went out drinking, alone. She always had to pick me up and drag me home. I never felt sorry. I was a loser. I can't change. Everything I do brings her down. It’s just who I am. 

We fought and fought, and my excuse was always I needed to drink my sorrows away and that I was never going to change since this is who I was. Someone that didn’t live up to my Angel's expectations. In the beginning, she always screamed and begged me to stop. But then even the lectures came to an end and she let me do whatever I wanted. Which I hated. I wanted her to help me, to stop me. I wanted her to lift me up. I needed her. It just made everything in my head worse and I drank even more and made even more mistakes. I got into a lot of fights. Hospital visits became a normal occasion. But there was one time where it became especially bad, which almost cost me my life thanks to a stranger pulling a knife on me. Fucking prick. It was the last time I went out drinking. Seeing my Angel's face in the hospital that day made me cry. I realized I’d been stupid. I tried to change. 

I had been on the top and now reached rock bottom. And now the only way was up. But if the last top had been a mountain, this top was only a hill, nothing could compare to what it used to be. We didn’t go out as much on dates together; we weren't as touchy as before. Sex was never an option. We stood each other close but took as much distance as possible without it feeling forced. This went on for some months and I was tired of it. I confronted her and tried talking things out. To make everything go back to normal. But all she did was cry. 

“Angel, please. Remember how it used to be! When everything was perfect! When everything seemed dark and void around me, you’ve always been there for me. We can go back!”

“Love is like a shooting star. The glance, the realization, the excitement, the wishing, and finally the passing. We had our first glance in middle school and we realized we were perfect not only as best friends but also as lovers. The excitement we felt during our relationship was stellar. The wishing comes from the wishes we both wanted in our relationship. We both fulfilled them. And now the passing, the excitement we once had is gone, the wish I wanted you to hold throughout our relationship has vanished. And I now want to look for another shooting star to grant me a wish.” My mind went blank after she told me that. I had nothing to say back. 

That night, she just stood up and left. We didn't have any contact for days, weeks. I had no reason to. I know what she said was real. Her intent was real. I had fucked up. But I couldn’t give up. I was still living in the past. Holding onto the memories we used to have. The happiness we once had and can still have if we work things out. But I wanted her to have some time to cool off before I spoke to her again. I had fucked up and I admitted that, so giving her time was the last thing I could do. 

But then, that night. I was taking a night walk in the cold winter on the outskirts of the town. As I saw a car parked strangely in some parking lot in the forest. First of all, it was around 2am in the morning, and for a car to be parked here at this time with its lights on was suspicious enough. I could catch a glance in the windows of the car and there were people inside, fucking… It couldn’t be real. It's freezing cold and it’s clearly visible from the road!? Even though it may not be that populated at night, there is still a chance. Psychos. Who are these people? I was curious. I gently walked towards the car to get a better glance. 

An Angel and a devil. My Angel. I would recognize her anywhere. Her naked back pressed up against the window, and as she slid down her eyes met mine. Behind her thrusted my high school bully with a grin as he noticed me watching on the opposite side of the glass. I fled the scene. It couldn’t be real. No, no NO! Anything, anyone but him. I just ran that day. Kept running. The memories, the happiness I once felt, everything just flashed in front of my eyes and vanished into thin air. I bawled my eyes out and didn’t even think of any directions to go. I just kept running away from everything. I felt my phone vibrating but I didn’t care. The snow began falling and the surrounding scenery turned white. 

A while later, I finally stopped and sat down and just cried on the ground. My face had become frozen since tears didn’t stop running. I was pathetic, a loser. I lost her; I lost to the bully. I let him win because I was stupid enough to let her go of my grasp. Eventually, I trudged through the snow home in despair.

Outside my apartment complex I saw her, waiting. I sneered and ignored her but she pleaded. 

“Please let me explain. Wait!” She grabbed a hold of my coat but I pushed her away. I could hear her sobs but I didn’t care. No, I did. She is still my Angel. Stopped and turned my head slightly in her direction.

“I thought we could reconcile. I still had hope. I had the memories of our past be the living embodiment of hope in my life. You ruined it all. I have nothing.” I screamed at her while sobbing between each and other word.  

“Stop holding onto the past! Move on. A relationship can't be based on memories. What point is there to date if the spark isn't there or can’t be reignited? It’s no different from dating a diary from the past. Let me go, and find someone who can regain your hope.” I clenched my fist hearing her words. She knew nothing.

“Why… Why him Angel? Why did you fuck the devil himself. Why did you taint your holiness with that wretched man?! The man who tortured me throughout high school. Hit me behind the school, bruised my whole body, tainted my name just because he wanted you for himself. Why did it have to be him?” 

“What do you mean, you never told me this?” I sprint towards her and grabbed her by the collar, not hard, but enough to push her into the wall behind her and force her to look me in the eye. 

“I didn’t want to be a burden. I didn’t want to be a loser in your eyes. I tried my best to be perfect for you.” Tears fell down her chin and I let go of my grip. 

“No matter what you could’ve done in the past, have done in the past, and can do in the future, wouldn’t have changed the fact you were always perfect in my eyes. The only problem was yourself. You were never perfect enough for your own satisfaction. You can’t love someone who doesn’t even love themselves. And you don’t love me anymore. You love the idea of my past self. No matter what you do from now on, I will cheer you on, and I will always love you. I’m sorry.” She stomped out into the dark night and disappeared soon after. I had nothing to think of. It was all blank in my head. Hearing her words kind of made me wake up. I needed someone to tell me the truth other than myself. She was right. I just walked into my room and fell asleep. Dreaming on how I should improve. 

But now I am here, at the present. A week after. Holding her again. She’s still warm. But drenched in blood. In front of me, a half naked body of a devil with a knife drilled into his chest. He’s not dead. My body shivers in fear while leaking sweat. The bully, the devil's body wiggles lightly, trying its best to do anything to stay alive while he choked on his own blood. I watched the devil take his last breath in front of my eyes as his soul departed down into hell. His body now lifeless.

Fuck, fuck what was going on! I look down at my angel. Her eyes closed and blood dripping from her mouth. The moonlight reflects onto her pale skin while her blond hair had turned into shades of red. The knife cut across her throat, still leaking blood. I wanted to see her gemstones one last time so I tried lifting her closed eye sockets. I jump a little in place, seeing her eyes rolled up into her head. I, I had been furious. I had thought back to what she had said a week ago but it made little sense! She can't be with the fucking devil I had to do something about it! So I went to his place, he opened the door and I stabbed him. Yes, it was my bad I was a little impulsive but she was my Angel! But her witnessing that made her do it herself. Why, it was not supposed to go this way! She held the knife to her throat and I went down on my knees.

"No, don't do it, please! We can go back. I know we can!"

“As long as I am a part of your life, you will never change. I'm doing this for your sake. I'm sorry.” That’s what she said before she ended it. Why did she do it? Why did she close out her own life? I sat there on my knees shaking as her body turned into a rag doll and fell to the round. Holding her knows my tears mixes with her blood as I try to shake her to life softly. I'm terrified. What is a world without my Angel? It's nothing! I hate her, I hate her, I HATE HER.

 Thinking back to moments ago I pick up the knife on the floor and stab her countless times out of raw anger! But after a few seconds realize what I'm doing and stop. I hug her while bawling out my eyes. I'm scared. No, I don't. I don't hate or blame her at all. It’s my fault. I was finally trying to change myself to become a man she could respect, but I still can’t. I’m still a loser. No one will love me as well as you did, Angel. Oh Angel. 

I leave her on the ground and stand up to watch myself in the mirror. Face and body scarlet red. The only thing glowing is my eyes as the moonlight reflected onto them. I'm looking at a monster. I fear myself. I breathe heavily and take a step backwards and hit her cabinet in the back. I scare myself doing that and drop the knife onto the ground. I just stare at it while shaking constantly. I sit down and hug my knees, rocking back and forth. Not losing sight of the knife. Clouds covered the moon and it suddenly became pitch black. I'm scared, I'm alone. The fragments of her words echo in my head and they are becoming louder and louder. But then I reach an epiphany. Maybe it's the solution. I laugh to myself as I dry the tears and pick up the knife.

Do I deserve to die, or do I deserve a second chance? A monster like me, can even I change? A life without my angel doesn’t sound like a life at all. But meeting my Angel where she originally belongs sounds fun. I hope she lives up to her expectations if I decide to cut my throat as well. I do hope God can forgive me and leave a spot for me in heaven, so that I can meet her again.

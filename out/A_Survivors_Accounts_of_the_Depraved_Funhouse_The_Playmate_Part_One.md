If there's anything I've learned, anything at all, in the [past year since I began telling my story](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/n7g6ra/a_survivors_accounts_of_the_depraved_funhouse_the/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3), it's this; memory is a cruel thing. Memory is what robbed me of sleep -- what *still* robs me of sleep. I still see everything. Memory continues to fuel my never ending night terrors. The memories of ma and dad, of Liza, Derek...

(*The balloon...)*

The thing is, it all leads back to those damn clowns; to HappyWorld. They say memory allows us to cherish life. To remember the good times and learn from the bad. Well, *I* say that's a fuckin' load. It was memory that costed me everything. Now, it's that memory that's brought me here today to finish what I started last year.

I'm sorry, you're probably confused. I needed to vent for a moment. Understand that I said what I did, however, because it's true. I mentioned that that summer wasn't the last time I'd see HappyWorld, and that it would royally fuck my life in even worse ways than I could've imagined. The catch, it didn't have to be that way. I *could've* forgotten it a long time ago. Could've moved on, told myself it never happened; that HappyWorld never existed.

Memory, I guess, is one of those things you hear about "having a mind of it's own". It'll happen to you whether you want it or not. Violating, I guess you could call it. What's even more ironic, though, I can actually remember the time in my life where I *was* free. Where I *DIDN'T* remember HappyWorld.

*A time where I could've moved on...*

That moment, if I had to go back, started just six months after that day at HappyWorld. By that point in time, everybody had long given up their search for Derek. In fact, funny enough (in a sick sort of way, obviously), I can actually tell you the slow progression of how the people of the small town in Tennessee just began to give up and fade Derek into obscurity. Three months, they searched for him via large search parties. Both authorities and locals alike pitched in, roving the streets almost constantly for a kid that only I knew wasn't coming back. The fourth month, the search parties started dying down and they instead resorted to plastering his face on the backs of the milk cartons. It was at the end of the fourth month, bleeding into that fifth, everyone finally seemed to accept that Derek wasn't coming back. That was the point where we held a memorial for him.

I remember it being held in the state park. I can remember how cold it was that day. The sun shined on, but all anybody there could feel was a bitter cold breeze. Not that many people actually came, though. It was me, my folks, what was *left* of the Cromwells, as well as Ray and Corey. *You'll be here when he's gone, but not when he would've needed you?* I remember thinking bitterly.

A picture of a younger Derek stood in place inside a large floral wreath frame in the center of the park in front of a large marble globe that stood in front of three circular concrete steps. Derek's father was the first to say something in his memory, briefly reminiscing about the times they spent bonding over classic monster movies. Liza went next. "I'll miss you, you big dork... wherever you are."

I still remember looking into her beautiful blue eyes when she said that and immediately feeling like my heart had just been smashed with a hammer. I'd have broken down into tears, had everything that happened in HappyWorld not scarred me to the point where I couldn't even cry anymore. When it was my turn, though, I walked up to his picture and placed a pack of blueberry PopTarts in front of it, painfully picturing that day outside the Blockbuster.

*"Great minds think alike, I suppose..."* I could hear myself say this again as I placed the PopTarts down and closed my eyes. *(I couldn't even look his photo in the eyes...)*

"See you around, dude..." My voice shook as I bid my last goodbye to my friend. My friend who wouldn't ever properly be laid to rest. *(I still see his eyes, begging for me to run. I should've ran...)*

As I walked away from the shrine, I looked over to see Liza burying her face in her parent's arms. It pained me to watch her. I remember because I knew that she still held hope that Derek was still alive. That he'd come home. For at least five months by that time, she'd held onto that hope -- clung to it, even -- and because of that, I couldn't help but to feel my heart break.

*You're gonna have to tell her...* Of course, how was I supposed to even do that? What the hell was I supposed to say?

Of course, certain of what to say or not, I knew damn well I wasn't going to be able to live with myself if I just sat quiet and continued to try hiding the truth from her. In the end, I'd decided to walk over to the Cromwell's house. If nothing else, I figured I might could be a shoulder to cry on. *(As if I could even get THAT right...)*

The walk through the neighborhood, trying to search blindly for her house was just as cold and quiet as the rest of the day had been at the park. I still wondered *what* exactly I was supposed to say to her. I was scared and wished I could've given myself a little more time, or at least a better understanding of what to say or do when I came across her sitting on the front porch of her house. She was wearing a bright purple sweater with sleeves that were way too long and blue jeans and appeared to be drawing in a sketchbook.

"H-Hey Liza." She shot a startled glance at me, eyes wide *(Just like how Derek's were...)*. "Oh, uh... S-Sorry, heh, heh... Didn't mean to scare you. I, uh, just wanted to see how you were doing." Without a word, she just very weakly shrugged her shoulders and went back to her sketchbook. I was about to just leave her alone and head back home, figuring maybe that just wasn't the time, when I noticed the small stack of posters and comic books laying next to her. Getting a better look, I saw they were classic Universal monster movie posters and those vintage horror comic books from the 50s and 60s in a stack next to her. "These posters are awesome, where'd you get 'em?"

"Oh..." she said, barely glancing at them before going back to her sketching. "Derek collected them. He *loved* this shit." She went quiet again and I decided to sift through the stack myself.

I remember how amazed I was at the different posters and comics he had. Everything from the classic *"Frankenstein meets the Wolfman"* to *"The Fly"* and even *"The Creature from the Black Lagoon"*. "That one was always his favorite. That, and the wolf guy." She chuckled softly and I continued to look throgh the comic collection until one made the blood drain from my face and freeze over. The cover depicted a giant clown monster with six long tentacles grabbing a couple of frightened kids and hoisting them in the air, ready to drop them into it's giant, cavernous maw with jagged piranha teeth.

"When it's finished, I wanna hang it up in his room. Sort of a cool "Welcome home" present, you know?" I heard her say this, but I wasn't paying any attention. My thoughts were hopelessly trapped on the comic -- the horrific reminder of the Hell I'd lost my friend to. Hesitantly, I began thumbing through the pages; dropping the book in horror at a part where a wizard is shown summoning the clown monstrosity.

*"Unto thee in the burning lake beneath..."* I could hear -- and in a way *feel* \-- the Amazing Beliar's voice followed swiftly by Derek's screams.

"You okay, Linus?" I could hear Liza ask. Her voice sounded distant, like it was calling from the top of a mountain. My head snapped over to see Liza staring at me with a worried expression. "What's up?" I could feel the sting of tears beginning to well up in my eyes as I just looked at her, my face completely pale.

"What's wrong?" Liza urged.

*You know you have to tell her.*

But how? How was I supposed to explain to her that I watched Derek get murdered -- no, worse yet, *sacrificed* \-- by a group of satanic clowns?

"L-Liza..." I croaked out. I desperately tried to force myself to just spit it out already.

"What?" she pressed. My tongue froze up and a weird sort of croaking sound came out of my mouth. "Damn it, what's going on?! This isn't funny, Linus! This is exactly what you did when Derek went missing!"

*Tell her the truth!*

That's when, for the first time in the five months since that day in HappyWorld, I actually broke into full-blown tears again. "Fine then, don't tell me!" she huffed as she began collecting the materials together and getting up to go inside. "You know what, don't even bother trying to ever--"

"The blood..." I spat out finally, cutting her off. "It was his."

"What? What're you talking about?" I closed my eyes and drew a deep breath.

"Derek isn't coming home. The blood that was all over me... was his!" Immediately, the horrid memories of HappyWorld came crashing back to me in a merciless barrage. The white corridor, the epileptic vacuum room, the sacrificial altar, the pile of children's corpses, Derek's elongated torture, *everything!* Tears were now running freely and damn near uncontrollable by this point as Derek's murder mentally rewound itself, taunting me on an endless loop.

"I... I... I tried to save him, Liza. But... They-they killed him!"

"This isn't cool! That's sick for you to joke about. I thought you were his friend." I could hear the fear seeping through her denial. The fear that she knew what I was telling her was the truth. The truth that she wasn't ready to accept.

"They made me watch, Liza!" I blubbered. "They made me watch while they tortured him! I tried... I tried, but I couldn't save him!"

I felt the sharp sting of a slap across my right cheek. "All this time..." she said, venom practically dripping from her lips now. "All this time, you *knew?!* How could you?!" I had no words for her. She was right. I'd kept the truth from her for almost half a year and just sat and let her believe in the lie that Derek might come back. *"I HATE YOU!"* she screamed before running inside and slamming the door behind her and leaving me to stand alone on her porch.

I stood there for about five minutes, staring at the comic I'd dropped. *I'm so sorry, Liza...* I thought before burying myself in my palms. How could I have done this? How could I have put her, this sweet, adorable little girl, under so much pain and misery? How could I have kept the truth from her, as well as basically everybody else, for so long? I felt like *I* was the one that took everything away from her and her family. *(The worst part, though, I've realized only nowadays, that neither of us had truly lost everything of value to us. Just enough to make us think it was as bad as it could ever get.)*

*Ching, ching*

The sounds caused me to look up from my hands. Riding by the house on a bicycle was what looked to be this tall, lanky woman with cherry red hair tied in pigtails hanging down the sides of her head and wearing overalls. For a moment, I seriously almost thought I was looking at the Wendy's mascot on a bicycle. She chimed the bell again and turned to face me, smiling. *What the...*

Then my blood ran cold when I saw her pasty white face with the read teardrop designs around her eyes that connected to the corners of her crayon red lips. *No! No, no, no, no... No, th-this can't...* I watched as the woman on the bike giggled while waving at me and speeding off. That was when I quickly started walking away from the Cromwell house, looking anxiously over my shoulders every 2 seconds to see if I was being followed. Sure enough, I had managed to make it halfway back the way I came going to my house when I heard the bicycle bell ring again, this time coming *towards me* from down the street to the left of me.

That was when all-out fight-or-flight kicked in and I started booking it down the street on the right. I just kept running further and further into the neighborhood. The whole time, I could hear the repeated *ching* of the bicycle right behind me, accompanied by the high pitched girly giggling. Suddenly, my ankles rolled mid-run, causing me to faceplant on the asphault.

Immediately, I felt a searing pain coming from my nose and could feel something warm and wet running down my face. *Fuck, I think it's broken!* I began to panic as I instantly curled into a ball, cradling my nose in agony. I peered from my hands to see if the bicycle clown was still coming after me. Oddly -- yet fortunately -- there was no sign of her, not even the chiming of the bell. I began to try and pick myself up off the ground when I felt shooting pains coming from my kneecaps.

Rolling up my pantlegs, I saw that my knees had been scraped raw, to the point where even the cool breeze touching them was causing extreme sharp pains to shoot throughout my body. Gritting my teeth and with sharp breaths, I worked my way up to my feet and and began slowly trying to limp towards where I thought I'd entered the neighborhood from. I silently thanked God or whatever forces that were watching over me that the bicycle clown was gone because I'd have had no chance in Hell of outrunning her at that moment.

The bad news was, now I was lost and had no slue as to how or where I entered from. On top of that, pain was now exploding throughout my body, barely even allowing me to keep my eyes open without immediately wincing in pain. I persevered for about another 10 minutes or so before the pain became too much and I had to stop and sit down again. Looking around, I could see the sun going down fast. I tried to get back up but the stabbing pain I immediately felt all over quickly put an end to that.

I just sat there holding my busted nose, which throbbed every second, and started to wonder how I was gonna make it home. "You okay there, dude?"

I snapped my head around to see one of the neighborhood kids on their front porch. I tried one last time to get myself back to my feet, unsuccessfully. "What happened?" I heard the kid call out to me. I saw him start heading in my direction. As he got closer, I saw that it was Ray.

"Hey, I remember you." he said, stopping about half a foot away from me. "You were the kid from the park, right? The one with the PopTarts?" He walked up and reached his hand down to me. I just groaned in response as I took his hand and painfully pulled myself up again. "Easy there, bud. You live near here?"

"Y-Yeah... why?" I asked, breathing sharply from the aches in my knees.

"Who were you running from?" I looked at him nervously. I wasn't sure whether I could actually tell him or not about the clown. *Would he even believe me?* Before I could come up with some lame-ass bluff, I heard the chiming of a bicycle bell in the distance.

*"Fuck!"* I whispered louder than I'd meant to, allowing Ray to overhear.

"What dude? What is it?" But I was already limping away as fast I could. I got *maybe* five feet from where I'd been before the, now excruciating pain in my knees ended up getting the better of me yet again. "Whoa, dude, wait up!" He ran over to me and threw my arm over his shoulder.

"Let me go, she's after me!" I cried, panic overridong any logical reasoning.

"Who?!"

"Her!" I pointed behind me where the oncoming chimes of the bicycle bell grew ever closer.

"You mean my brother?" he asked, looking and sounding completely bewildered.

"Your brother?" I snapped my head around to look back behind me. Sure enough -- no clown. Instead, it was this tall, punker dude with long, dyed blood red hair wearing a black tank-top and skin tight black pants with a chain that hung down from his right pocket. I looked at Ray absolutely dumbfounded. "B-But sh-she was after me..."

"Come on, man, let's get you inside. Need to get you bandaged up before you bleed out in my front yard." As we continued towards his house, him basically carrying my ass every step of the way, I continued looking over my shoulder, still convinced the clown was somewhere nearby. "You got a name?" I snapped my head back in his direction.

"Huh? Oh, uh, Linus Davies. And you are?" I asked, despite still remembering him from that day at Blockbuster.

"Raymond. But you can just call me "Ray". That's what all my friends do."

*Like the one you abandoned...*

Of course, I didn't actually voice this to him. No, instead, I just stayed quiet until we got up to the front door when I asked him where his folks were. "They're out. Won't be back for another couple of days. They work for the hospital across town as nurses. It's just you, me, and Reggie over there, and he's barely ever around anyway."

When we got inside, he guided me over to the living room couch. "Wait here, I'll get some ointments and bandages." I sat down on the couch, clutching my busted nose, which was throbbing horribly by this point. I looked out the window. The sun was almost gone completely, leaving just barely any light in the sky at all. *God, Ma's gonna kill me.*

I was basically simulating that conversation in my head already. *"Oh my God where were you?!"* and *"You had me worried SICK!"* And I'd have almost been willing to bet money she'd have used Derek's disappearance to fuel her anxiety. The worst part was, what could I have told her.

Somehow, I felt the whole *"Yeah, Ma, see, I was being chased by a psycho clown on a bicycle"* schtick wouldn't have gone over real well. *(Why did I have to be a coward? She deserved the truth... She always did.)*

"Alright, hold still." Ray's voice snapped me back to the present as he brought over some gauze and peroxide wipes. "Fair warning, this may sting a bit." He placed the wipe to my raw, bloody kneecap and began dabbing and wiping around it. The pain caused me to inhale sharply. "Sorry." he said as sympathetically as he could.

"It's fine." I replied through gritted teeth.

"So uh... Linus, you never did answer my question from earlier." I looked at him, confusion mixing with the discomfort.

"Huh? What do you mean?" I asked.

"About the park. You were there, weren't you? With the PopTarts?"

"Yeah, why?" He shrugged and kept cleaning the wounds.

"It's just that I've never seen you around and I was wondering how you'd have known Derek." I told him then about the day at the Blockbuster five months before, about me and him bonding over HappyWorld and "The Amazing Beliar". "Ahh... So he got you hyped about that, too, huh? He was *always* on about that, 'The Amazing Beliar'." I just stayed quiet as he continued.

"I never got it. I mean, it was cool the first few times we went, but after a while, it just kind of got old, you know? I honestly don't even think "The Amazing Beliar was ever real. But Derek still did, so I just figured I'd go along with it. Here, pinch your nose and hold your head down." He bandaged my nose and handed me a tissue to hold up my nostril to stop the bleeding. "I'd like to think he's still out there, still just searching for him, you know?"

"He's not..." The words jumped from my mouth quicker than I could realize I'd said anything.

"What do you mean?"

I'd said too much, and now I was going to have to bite the bullet for the second time that day. "I mean that he's not "Still out there". He's... He's not coming back..." Before any more could be said, however, the sound of glass being shattered caused the both of us to jolt in panic. "The fuck?!" Ray shouted as he went over to where the sound came from. I followed him and saw that someone had thrown a brick through the window.

"Hey!" Ray shouted out the window, "I'm calling the cops!" Looking out the window, I very nearly went into shock when I saw the clown on the bicycle in the middle of the street, giggling and twiddling her fingers at us before speeding off.

"I-It's... It's *her!*" I stammered, heart hammering away at my chest.

"What?"

"The person I was telling you was after me. It's her!" Seeing the panic building on my face, Ray told me to stay put while he got the police on the phone. While Ray was on the phone, I looked down at the brick on the floor amidst the sea of shattered glass. Hesitantly, I picked up the projectile to find an envelope with the hauntingly familiar red smile on the front tied to it. My hands shook violently as I untied the envelope and opened it. I nearly had a heart attack when I saw what was inside.

It was a photo of me and Liza on her front porch. The demented red clown face had been drawn over her face in red marker. On the back of the photo was a message.

***"I spy with my little eyes, a piggy and his little playmate. Now WE'RE gonna have some playtime with her!"***

My mind immediately, and forcefully, took me back to that dark room. I even felt my right cheek, imagining the Amazing Beliar's smile as he stroked my face with his sledgehammer.

*"Do you care for this boy's life?"*

*"Would you like that, piggy? Would you like a balloon?"*

That was what finally broke me and I ran to the closest trash can and puked until I couldn't anymore.

"Whoa, you okay there, dude?" Ray asked, appearing suddenly beside me, causing me to jump and snap my head in his direction from the trash can. I just stood there, giving him that stare that this shit was urgent.

"They're... They're... They're after Liza!"

"What're you talking about? *Who's* after Liza?" I just held up the photo. His eyes widened. "What the fuck, dude?" He looked at me, confused. "Who are these people? What do they want with you and Liza?"

"I... I don't know." I lied. I was too freaked out in that moment to care enough about a guilty conscience. More than this, I was far more worried about the very real danger Liza might've been in. "We have to get to her before they do!" I cried, attempting to make a mad dash for the door.

Ray put his hand on my shoulder, stopping me dead. "Whoa there, dude, it's getting dark out there. You won't be able to see where you're going." Unfortunately, he *did* kind of have a bit of a point. Never even mind the fact that I *still* had no way of knowing how to even get out of the neighborhood.

Of course, next to none of that was registering in my mind in that moment. "Well I can't just sit here. What if they've already got her?"

*What good would it even do if you DID get to her first? It'd have been just like Derek and you know it...*

"Calm down, okay?" he said. "The cops are on their way. Just show them the picture and tell them about the stalker on the bicycle." For a good couple of minutes, I just stared at Ray, quivering and spiraling as I tried to compose my thoughts that were racing through my mind.

*I can't just sit here and do nothing. I HAVE to help her!* This was countered by the devil on my shoulder. *You mean like how you "helped" Derek?*

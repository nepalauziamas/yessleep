I have worked in the Atton Tower Hotel in Belo Horizonte since I was 16 until it was shutdown in 2015. For some reason, at least since 1992, floor 17 has been sealed and employees were prohibited from even talking about it. It’s scheduled for demolition next week. I needed to know what was in floor 17, so yesterday I broke into the building to discover. Ok, I didn’t exactly break into the building. I still have one of the master keys.

But if I knew what I’d find, I would have stayed home. The floor was filled with a terrible odor, there was dirt, dust and rats everywhere. All doors were locked with chains, all windows barred and covered with false, painted panels. There were claw marks and old blood-marks in all roofs, doors, and walls. But the worst thing were the skeletons. Jesus, there were so many of them. Their clothes were all ripped to shreds, and their bones had bite marks.

There was, however, a door that wasn’t barred, but wide open. Inside, there was a fully-clothed skeleton, holding a revolver in his bony fingers, and a hand-written note lied on his lap:

“I don’t have much time. My name is Jason Thames, I was visiting Minas Gerais with my wife and kids. We were exploring one of the old gold mines near Barbacena, and my family ran into an off-limits section. The mine collapsed, we had to call the SAR team. The kids were wounded but alive, we took them to the best local hospital, in Belo Horizonte, we were waiting here for them to get better.

But, something is wrong. Wrong with this place. I think something was with us that day when the cave collapsed. I think it followed us. No, not followed us. It mimics us. I only recently thought about it, I was in denial… Oh God, the section of the mines collapsed, and both my kids had fractures in their skulls, but my wife was intact! 

This thing has been with me for two weeks, I slept with it, had lunch and dinner with it, let my children alone in the hospital with it! And no, I’m not crazy. They called me. A body was found in the cave. Her body, wearing no clothes. Now I understand why they ran away. The thing used my voice to call them! 

And for the last few days, things have been messed-up in the hotel. Guests are disappearing. Everyday the police comes. I always say we never left the room.

This monster, it does something to your brain, it controls you. I will not lie to the police no longer, saying “she” was with me. I hear it slaughtering the guests and lie to myself. Not anymore. I just called the reception, told them. Shit, “she’s” returning. Tell my kids we loved them.”

Below the previous text, there was another one:

“Aguyje chemosãso haguére, 
rocheháta vokoiete,
mborayhu, Anhangá”

I was going to translate it, but I heard my son calling me in the kitchen just now. I thought he was traveling to São Paulo, maybe he came back early. I’ll go check on him and then I’ll look for the translation.

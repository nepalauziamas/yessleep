Now let me start with that I do not believe in the supernatural whatsoever but I have a very strange story from when I was around 14, plus minus one year or two.

I was invited to my friends birthday party along with our usual circle of friends of around seven or eight people. We were meeting at his house and had a few light drinks. Yes, we were too young for alcohol but we were rebellious teens. You know the kind. Our parents knew that we would be spending the night at his place.

This went on till well into the night. Since it was summer we decided to go for a walk. We were all living in a relative rural area of Germany, spread around a few smaller towns. So we decided to go for a walk on the fields, which were about a five minutes away from my friends house.

When we reached the fields we sat down on the road there. I should add that it's not allowed to drive on this road if you do have no buissines at the fields. So basically only the farmers were allowed to drive on them and that late at night there was no reason for a car to be there, so it was save to sit down.

We had our drinks with us and kept drinking, though we weren't drunk.

The road had an intersection about 20 meteres from us. Behind us was the industrial district of the town and further on the left of us were houses. All of the fields around us were covered by corn.

All of a sudden we noticed a huge figure walking down the path towards the intersection, or rather crossroads towards us from the left. The figure was very bony, at least 2.5 meters (8.2 feet) tall, wearing a cloak, a crown and had a trident in it's hand. We could only see it's silhouette but the head just looked like a skull with very pointy teeth as if they were also made from bone. It walked in a very strange matter, leaning on the trident like it was a walking stick and the mouth was opening and closing while it walked.

[Here is a quick drawing I made up in paint to approximate the scene.](https://imgur.com/a/ug9A7iA)

We got up and started running for our lives, scared shitless. While running I was pretty sure I saw a yellow orb flying next to us and then dissapearing. It looked like a solid mass of energy with particles flying around it. I remember telling the others about it but can't remember what they said about it.

So far it all sounds very paranormal and no, I don't think it was. I am convinced it was a guy in a costume on stilts and the orb was just a figment of a teenagers imagination.

That being said, after our circle of friends drifted apart we didn't really keep in contact for many years but last year a good friend of mine turned 30 and I was invited to her party. This was when I met the friend from back then whos birthday it was 15+ years ago. We got to talking and I asked him if he remembered that night and bet you, he did. He developed into a very esoteric guy and other than me he was convinced that it was some demon or something we saw back then and he remembered the orb as well, describing it in detail the same way I remembered it and I mean the exact same way.

As an up and coming scientist I know it wasn't anything paranormal but still, the hair on my neck stood up straight.

I don't know what that dude was doing out there in the fields late at night, dressed like Lucifer himself but if he is reading this... Let's never, ever meet again.

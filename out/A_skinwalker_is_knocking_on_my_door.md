I am writing this now as a call for help, I am desperate and I don't know what to do.

   My name is Michael,  I own a dairy farm in the great plains, near a navajo reservation ,along with my brother. The farm was built by our parents before we were born and it was passed down to us after their death. It's a pretty big farm, it has 2 barns , a well and a house , where we spend most of our free time, although I've always dreaded this place, because it's the place where our parents died, or at least where they were found.My parents died when we were both 19, their bodies were found mutilated in the well, there was nothing stolen or destroyed,  if not for the blood trail leading to the well we would've never found them
 The case was passed as a murder, but they never had any suspects, and me and my brother were too ravaged by the event to think about it.

   Years passed and we forgot about the event, well until 2 weeks ago. We were gathering food for the cows using an old tractor, it was pretty dark but we didn't use it's headlights because the battery was too old and couldn't stand them being on for very long. As I was loading up the food I heard my mom's voice calling for me from behind some bushes: ,, Michael, it's been too long come to me" , but it sounded weird, as if it was spoken through an old radio. I was terrified, I looked at my brother  and he was as white as snow. I whispered to him to turn on the headlights in the direction of the voice . What laid before our eyes made my knees weak, it was a coyote,  but it's eyes were pitch black and it was standing on it's back legs. I jumped in the tractor and we noped our way out of there as fast as we could.


  We arrived at the house and locked the door, that's the moment when I passed out. I woke up in the middle of the night, I thought all that just happened was a dream but then I saw my brother telling me to stay quiet and pointing his shotgun at the door. Then I heard it again: ,, Michael,  come Here my dear". Then it started to knock softly on the door, that didn't last for very long though. The knocking turned into banging,  then my brother started looking through the window at that thing. It realized we were looking at it and it let out the most horrific screech I've ever heard, before it ran off.

An hour later it started again, the voice and the  knocking.  I've searched it up on the internet and I learned they are called skinwalkers,evil Navajo men that sold their soul. Calling their name supposedly attracts them, I hope writing it doesn't trigger them. My brother wants to go outside and face it, I'm afraid we won't see the light of day again, please help us

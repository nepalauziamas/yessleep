This all started when me and my dog pulled into a town off the road to get snacks. As we got into town it looked very worn down. I couldn’t even tell if anyone lived in this town. We wandered around for a bit. From what I gathered there wasn’t much to this town only have 8 buildings, a diner, a school, and a hospital. The other buildings were just houses. The school doors were boarded shut and the building looked like it hadn’t been in use for awhile. Same with the hospital and the houses all boarded shut, but the diner looked in almost perfect condition. I decided that was our best best into getting helped so I walked inside my dog trailing behind. The inside looked just as good as the outside but no one was inside to greet us. I walked back outside and as turned around to look at the restaurant again it’s appearance had changed. It looked just like the hospital and school all run down and not in use. I was seriously freaked out now and decided to leave this place. Me and my dog tried to leave but as we got to the exit my visions went dark and I passed out. 

I woke up right next to my dog trying to remember what happened. We both got up and walked to the exit again. Maybe I was just dreaming about trying to leave the first time but as we got to the exit the same thing happened as the first time. Over the next three hours I tried leaving over and over again but I had no luck. The only luck I had at this point was my phone was still working and did have service but when I tried to make a call no matter who it was it went straight to voicemail. As well as when I tried to use some of the apps on my phone they wouldn’t work. One of the apps that did work was the maps apps. I tried to see where I was on the map but when I looked the area I was in was apparently all woods. Not a single house or anything was to be seen anywhere near the area I was. It’s almost like the area I was, was teasing me trying to tell me I had no chance of escaping. My mind was racing, what have I gotten myself into. I tried to leave again running to the exit my dog by my side but was met with the same fate as before waking up in the middle of the town. However though something had changed, the diner from before has been restored back to its pristine condition.

“Fuck it.” I said walking into the diner. Something was different though this time, the smell of fresh food lingered in the air and in the corner of the restaurant was a man eating a meal. I hesitated at first but chose to walk over to him. 

“Excuse me sir.” I said tapping him on the shoulder. I startled him and he jumped up from his seat. 

“Who the hell are you!” The man exclaimed.” 

“Woah calm down. I’m sorry to startle you. You are the first person I have seen in hours and I need answers.” 

“It’s my apologies, I can’t recall the last time i’ve seen someone out here.” The man said. 

“What is this place?” 

“It might be best you grab a seat. I got a lot of explaining to do here.” 

I did as the man said letting my dog jump onto a seat next to me then sitting down myself. 

“Son i’m sorry to have you end up here, but you are shit out of luck I have to say.” 

“What do you mean are you saying there is no way out?” I asked. 

“Let me tell you a little about this place. 11 years ago me and my friends set out on a road trip we took the scenic route even though the scenic route was just some farmland. About halfway to our destination our car broke down. We all decided to walk to this town here. When we got here it was all worn down just like it is now and not single person was here. We tried to leave but to no such luck as we all passed out and ended up back in the town. Over the next couple hours we kept trying and trying but never were we able to make it back to our car. My friends and I after trying for so long to leave decided to break into one of the houses. That’s where we stayed for the night. Also you may be worrying about the diner here but if you are lucky enough you can catch it when it looks all nice and there will always be food stocked in the back. There is something you will come to notice about this place, it’s always night no matter what. But you must pay attention to the time. Things can go very wrong if you aren’t looking at the time.” The man then checked his watch and then looked up at me and said “Oh shit. It looks likes it time. You must follow me now!” He ran out of the building and I followed. We jumped through the back window on his house. 

The man was waiting for me by the window. 4 chairs were placed down by the window. I grabbed a seat in one and looked out the window.

“See son that’s why you gotta be inside.” The man said looking out the window.

Outside was a group of people. They looked like they were in some sort of cult. All wearing black robes with the same symbol on them. Of course it wasn’t a friendly symbol it was an upside down cross. 

“Those people outside are ruthless. You know how I mentioned I had friends. On the second night we were here we weren’t familiar with the place. We had all been outside when they showed up. They took one of my friends into the woods and the other they had slit his throat. The one they took with them to the woods is one of them now. Every time I look out this window I can see him.”

“You said you had another friend. What happened to him?” I asked

“The woods around here are a very dangerous place. Me and him wandered into the woods looking for answers and the only thing I came out with was another dead friend. No matter what time it is they are always lurking in the woods.”

There was a loud from outside this startled my dog causing him to bark.

“Shut the thing up before they catch us. I’m not gonna get caught because of your stupid dog.” 

I tried to calm him as best I could but he’s always been this way. Once something gets him going he doesn’t stop. 

Me and the man looked out the window but the cult was gone. Instead of being in the middle of the town they were at our door. **Bang** **Bang** **Bang**. It sound like they were trying to break down the door.

“We gotta hurry up and get out of here.” The man said flying down the stairs. He jumped out the window and just as I was about to follow I noticed from the corner of my eye one of them. The cult member jumped onto the man and another one popped out and helped grab the man dragging him into the woods. I knew I had to act fast or I would be joining him. I ran upstairs again turning into the bathroom of the house. I was hoping that the cult would think that the man was the only one in the house. Right as I got into my spot I heard the door get kicked down. I knew it was a matter of time before the caught me. One of them began to walk up the stairs.

Step. Step. Step. Step. Step.

Oh no I think they found me.

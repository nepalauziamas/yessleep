 

This has been happening ever since I was a little boy. I remember coming home from school on my 8th birthday. The iPhone 2 had just come out and it was the only thing that I wanted at that time period. I was sitting in the dining room, eating my cereal, when my parents walked in. Holding a box, they wished me a happy birthday and asked me to open it. 

Excited for whatever I’m about to see, I open the box in a hurry. There it was, the “new and improved” iPhone 2 that I was dying to have for the past months. Out of pure happiness, I hug both my parents for giving me the one thing I wanted the most.

2 weeks after I got the phone, I got a phone call…

Confused, I put the phone up to my ear. “Hello?”

\-Silence-

Just as I’m about to hang up, it speaks

*“Blue”*

The phone hangs up

I was obviously naive, as I was very young, so I figured people got random calls like that all the time. I moved on with my day. The next morning I went to school. My class was doing some type of fun Lab where we would play educational games against each other to win a prize.

We get down to the final 2 people, me and some other kid, we’re gonna call him Mike. The teacher had two cups, one red, one blue, and me and Mike had to pick the cup we thought had the ring under it. If we both get it right, we both acquire the ring and 5 dollars, if we get it wrong, we don't. We can either lose together, win together, I win, or he wins.

I liked this class, because it taught us all the possibilities in life. We either fall together, rise together, or experience the unfair parts of life. Sometimes, the other person wins, and you lose. Simple.

He picks red, and usually, I would choose the same option the other kid picked so that I don't lose by myself, but something told me to listen. Follow the voice that called me on the phone. I don’t know why I thought the phone call was relevant to this situation, but I felt it in my soul. So, I picked the blue cup.

After I got my prize, let’s just say, I’ve always listened to what the voice told me.

Years later, I’m now an adult, and most of my greatest life accomplishments were because of those strange calls I get everyday. Since this has been happening almost my entire life, I have a lot of experience with this “superpower” (what my family calls it.) For one, no matter if my data plan is active or not, the voice can still call me; And no matter how many times I switch phones, it’s still able to contact me. I can confidently say that this will be with me for the rest of my life.

But, it can be a bit perplex sometimes. As you can tell from my first experience, sometimes it gives me advice that’s not too descriptive. It can also give me advice on things that are not too important; At Least not important to me personally. That can get a little bit annoying. But hey, I’m still grateful.

Other than that, this anomaly has been a part of my life since childhood and I grew to like it more and more everyday. Sometimes, I feel as though the topics it shares with me is honestly above any person on this Earth. As if one day, It’ll teach me the meaning of life itself. For example, one night, it finally called for its daily routine. It told me, “At the end of the universe, it stops, but sometimes, it keeps going.” To be honest, I had no idea what this meant, and I’ve never forgotten about it. But, it has to mean something. I’ll figure it out one day.

However, that’s just a small chunk of it. Lately, these calls have been getting pretty weird (er). I don’t know how to explain it, it feels as if they changed from simple life tips, to warnings.

This has been happening almost everyday for the past 3 weeks, and I’m trying to figure out what went wrong. What's happening to me? 

The first time this happened, I was getting dressed for a family get-together, when the voice finally called. It said, *“It follows.”* I got the chills. This had to be one of the weirdest calls I've gotten from it yet. Nonetheless, I still finished getting ready to leave. As I drove in the dark, most likely close to about 9 pm, I started to feel paranoid. Anxiety fills my body. Somebody’s following me. He’s watching me. **THEY** are watching me.

I vaguely remember this one truck following me the entire time. I used the technique where I just hit a large number of right turns the entire time. Just as I thought, they were still behind me. I’ve lived with the voice long enough to know that this isn’t some mere coincidence. This was what it was warning me about. That entire night, I simply drove around, listening to music, passing the police station multiple times. I completely missed the family gathering.

After this, the only “advice” I ever gotten from this anomaly has been nothing but warnings.

***“Don’t sleep”, “Take it off”, “Close the curtains”, “Don’t listen”.*** These are just 20% of the calls that I get. If I didn’t have this thing with me at this point, would I even be alive? Or is it causing the trouble. At this point, there’s nothing I can do but trust it. Besides, isn’t this technically just my childhood friend? Jokes aside, I need answers.

Yesterday, I got my daily call from the voice. *“{36 xxxxxxx St}”* The address it gave me was not too far from my house, so I planned to drive over there hoping answers would be given. But, what if it’s telling me to avoid it? What if there’s danger? These are highly likely, but I have to know. I need answers for my life long plethora of mysteries regarding this “voice.”

10 minutes and I’m there. The exact dress this anomaly told me about. I wasted no time and hopped straight out of my car. First thing I noticed was the look. A very rundown one story house, I could tell it was abandoned. I put my phone straight into my pocket and head inside.

Weird vibes, dusty everything, no lighting, I was immediately uncomfortable. I walked inside a room, looked as if it was a bedroom, and spotted a piece of paper. It looked fairly new and weirdly out of place. I remind myself to come back to it after I search the rest of the room. The room seemed to belong to a child, old toys and teddy bears everywhere, and a pretty small bed.

Nothing too out of place, I go back to the paper. I pick it up, blow the little bits of dust off of it, and read it.

***“You are not alone.”***

I panic. Looking around, I started to consider that the call was telling me to avoid this place instead of going right into it. I drop the paper, and leave the room. As I tried to navigate through the house, I felt horrible, as if eyes were on me the entire time, enjoying my fear. As I run through what felt like a maze, I hear something. It sounded like footsteps. Panicked, I hide.

*“Step, step, step, step.”*

The sound gets closer and closer. I felt as if my life was over right then and there. But something snapped, my fight or flight started to kick in, and I fled. Running for dear life, I bust through the old creaky door leading directly outside and to my car. As my jittery hands shook the entire time, I desperately tried to start my car. The whole time I felt as time was ticking, and that something was getting closer and closer.

Finally, my car started. I’ve never driven so fast in my life. The entire car ride felt as if I was running from someone, holding onto a single inch of life.

When I finally got home, I made sure all of my doors were locked, windows sealed shut, and the house was completely empty. I locked myself in my room, nervous to even step one foot out of my room, thinking about that house.

After 2 hours in my room, I decided to write this, just in case I don’t make it. But I know myself, I’m going to find the answers I’m looking for; Whether I like it or not.

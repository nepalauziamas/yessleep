i’m a 19 year old female that lives in a high populated city, every year me and my family go down into the countryside to see my grandparents we’ve done this from since i was around 8. i’ve never really believed in paranormal things you know the usual ghosts and spirits but i usually played along with my families beliefs in there sightings until this happened i finally found some sense in it. 

So it was the same time every year for us to go up to my grandparents (4th of November) and i seriously couldn’t shake the feeling on the car drive there , which is about two hours that something was wrong not just wrong but like as we got closer i felt sick and my stomach was turning, i really couldn’t shake the feeling and i mentioned it to my mom who also said she felt a bit off but it might just be motion sickness, i’ve never ever had motion sickness so i knew something wasn’t right. 

As soon as we got there we all hugged kissed the usual as what you do when you haven’t seen your grandparents in exactly a year but i really noticed changes in them like the slight off putting things like the way there eyes were spaced out and their nose looked different but it was the same changes in both of there faces i put it down to old age and asked my sister 23 if she noticed anything she said the same thing i did and we moved past it. After about a week of being there me my sister and two brothers all went into the woods and looked for random things and my little brother was looking for ghosts as he liked to do , when i saw out of the corner of my eye and bearing in mind i wouldn’t of even noticed if it didn’t look so recognisable but there was my grandpa staring at me from behind a tree as if he was spying on me which he’s never ever like that and wouldn’t do something like this but his face had changed again but not just the little things he was completely different but i knew it was him if you get what i mean. I bolted so fast i didn’t even look back but there he was stood in the kitchen acting like nothing happened i asked him if he went into the woods and he looked confused and his face was like it was when got there no changes only the slight eye separation and nose but why was it like that in the woods. 

My brothers and sisters returned and we all had dinner and watched a film together mid  way through my grandad as per usual needed to use the restroom so we paused the film and as soon as he came back i noticed he looked the exact same as he did in the woods it was like he’d been swapped out and was a different person he came back asking what film we were watching i instantly knew it wasn’t him but i played it off and said i was tired and going to bed but then around 3:50 i could hear someone or something walking around and scoring the walls i panicked and ran out nothing there ,went back into my room and then it happened again i went to check nothing again , i panicked like heart in my throat panicked i tried to sleep but i couldn’t until i saw sunlight which usually means grandma should wake up in about five minutes i hoped and prayed for that five minutes and it felt like hours until i heard the bedroom door open to find my grandad smiling , again he looked normal what was going on why had i noticed it why had no one else i told myself this was the last day , we’re going home tonight and after what felt like years we packed up and left.

 My mum and dad dropped me off at my apartment but from when i got out of the car to when i got into my apartment i felt like i was being watched it was so strong that whatever it was could burn holes through me i couldn’t handle it i walked and walked and walked around the city until the feeling had left and i went back into my apartment the same feeling but this time it was making noise footsteps making floorboards creak so right now i’m locked in my bedroom writing this hoping it’s not the last thing i do write something can someone tell me what to do.

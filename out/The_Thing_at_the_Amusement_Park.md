I can’t believe what I just saw. I work nights as security at an abandoned amusement park. I will not disclose the park as I still work there. Most nights it is very quiet but last night was something different.

I am still shaking thinking about what I saw. It started like every other night shift, I come in and sit in the security booth near the gate with my coworker. One of use must do a perimeter sweep every two hours. We usually alternate who goes for each. It was about 3 am when my coworker said I should get going to do my sweep. I didn’t think much of it as I have done it hundreds of times. 

I get up and start to walk the perimeter. Keep in mind that this park isn’t small either. It would take use usually 45 minutes to walk the security path around the park. I as about halfway through my walk around when I hear this scream. It wasn’t like a scream that someone was in danger more of a scream like people are on a roller coaster. I thought to myself, *Did I hear that?* I ignored it thinking it was the wind and my mind decided to be paranoid.

I heard it again.

This time it was a little louder and sounded Identical to the one before. 

I radioed to my coworker. “Hey, are you hearing these screams?”

Coworker: “No. You better not be messing with me.”

Me: “No I’m not, I am hearing screams like people are riding a rollercoaster.”

As I am talking to my coworker, I look up to the main roller coaster we have. 

It is very dark so I can barely see the top of the lift hill when I notice this figure. It looks like a person, but it seems to be a bit too tall though. This figure seemed to be about the size of a normal person if they were standing next to me.

I radio my coworker again. “Hey can you look at >!Redacted!<?”

Coworker: “Yeah but I thought you could see since you work here. Hey what the fuck is that?”

Me: “I have no fucking clue; it looks like a person.”

Then I heard it again. That same scream, but this time I saw that thing look like it was howling. 

Coworker: “What the hell is it doing?”

Me: “I heard that scream again. I’m going to head back to the booth.”

I start making my way back as this thing keeps screaming. I occasionally look back at this roller coaster and notice it moving down the ride. Not by the lift hill but by the supports. 

When I get back to the booth my coworker start asking me what fully happened. After I explain to him what I saw from my perspective I look at the rollercoaster and notice it is completely gone and think to myself, *did it go away? Where is it? Is it looking for me?*

I look at the shops closer to the booth and notice something in one of them. It is dark so it is hard to see into them, but something felt off about it. I look a little harder and notice something glowing. 

It was two faint blue dots in this building about 12 or so feet in the air. These shops were decently big with about 15-foot openings for the now shattered windows.

Then I hear it again, that scream.

Coworker: “Is that the scream?”

I swallow my spit and mutter a “Yea…”

Then I see it, this creature I can only describe as being tall and boney, standing in the middle of the main walkway. It had no hair, nor did it have any facial feature other than eyes that I could see.

I scream: “This is private property, leave or you will be escorted away.”

I didn’t plan on getting near this thing. It just stood there staring at us. Then it happened, its jaw seemed to unhinge, and that scream happened but this time more blood curdling. 

Coworker: “So, you going to escort him out?”

Me: “What the hell do you think. I ain’t going anywhere near that thing.”

Coworker: “Where is it going?”

It starts to wonder off and we decide to call our supervisor.

Our supervisor wouldn’t believe us and told us to quit being afraid of the dark. AS far as that thing goes. It was like it disappeared for the night. None of our coworkers have seen this thing before and we haven’t heard of anyone who said they heard those screams last night. I seriously don’t know what that thing was, nor do I plan on trying to find out. 

All I know is I don’t know if I can work security there anymore. I work again tonight and will keep an update if this thing or whatever it should be called comes back.

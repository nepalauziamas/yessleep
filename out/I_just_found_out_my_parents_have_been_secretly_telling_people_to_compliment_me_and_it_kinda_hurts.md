I had only been a deacon for six months when Elder Michael announced I'd be leading the scared ceremony that spring. In the front pews, my parents beamed as he beckoned me up on stage. Around them, islanders rose to their feet, cheering ferociously.

But as I stood there, absorbing that applause, a moist sickness slid up my throat.

The poor bastards really had no idea…

The news came as no great surprise to our congregation; one year earlier, the Elder barely made it back in time *and* took pneumonia afterward. He spent six weeks at the infirmary, completely debilitated, and didn’t lead another full sermon until mid-October. He needed a replacement. A protégé.

The morning of the ceremony, I made my trousers watertight with plastic bags. A chaffing, Westerly wind kept the ocean higher than expected.

“Don’t hang about,” was the Elder’s parting advice. “Remember, this is a matter of faith. Don’t listen to those *fisherman*”—you could hear the disdain drip off every syllable—“who tell you they can read the tide.”

I started off from the beach long before sunrise, carrying the tribute across Pilgrim’s Bay. Less than twenty yards out the water rose to ankle-level and a powerful gale drowned out Michael’s prayers despite him bellowing at the very top of his lungs, like he did in church seven days a week.

Up ahead lay the Holy Isle, my destination. Silhouetted against a bright, full moon, there stood an outline of a ruined monastery and castle. I hesitated, which, in retrospect, only made things worse.

The elder’s voice played in my mind, as though carrying all the way from the shore. “Think of how proud this will make your parents, Ross. Not to mention dear Katie. Such a blessing to have a brother she can look up to.”

Even with all my apprehension, the voyage took less than fifteen minutes. The isle was little more than a bed of rock with a flat, grassy knoll in the center. Nobody had lived there since before the iron age.

A bumpy dirt trail brought me from the coast to the mouth of the skeletal castle. There, I stood rooted to the spot, listening to the structure creak and shiver, until a voice, hoarse with age, called out from the darkness.

"Don’t hang about, that chills bad enough to freeze the piss in your bladder.”

An old fella with steel rimmed spectacles and fisherman’s overalls stepped through an arched doorway.

“Lyle,” I said, the tightness in my chest easing.

He ratcheted coughs for several seconds, his face pale and washed out except for the cheeks, which had gone red from the piercing cold. “C’mon, lad. Best get a move on.”

Within seconds he had disappeared back into the darkened archway.

“Can’t we go around?” I yelled, my voice echoing off stone walls.

“Fastest way is through.”

He always did have a direct manner.

By then my arms and core ached with fatigue, so I slung the tribute over my left shoulder and followed Lyle through a series of choked corridors. With every turn, noises rang out from the gloom: scattering stones, whispers that may or may not have been the breeze. My knees began to wobble, I couldn't help it. Every turn might have brought us face to face with...*them*.

“How you feeling?” Lyle asked without looking back, like somehow he sensed my apprehension.

“Fine,” I muttered. He stayed quiet until, finally, I sighed and said, “A little guilty.”

That was the understatement of the year. In truth, a persistent, black terror had hung over me since the announcement. Anytime a fellow islander paid for my drinks at the bar or refused my money down by the market, that terror surged up, making it difficult to breathe. Making me dizzy.

My family and friends unanimously agreed I was doing a great thing, a *wonderful* thing. At the street corner, they'd slap me on the back and call me a hero. Of course, none of them—except perhaps my sweet, loving parents—knew about the doubt and apprehension secretly plaguing me. Maybe that's why they secretly asked the islanders to shower me with compliments and praise, further pressuring me into completing the ritual. All that despite the circumstances.

Just goes to show how brainwashed they really were, I guess...

In a large room without a ceiling, stray beams of moonlight pierced the clouds overhead. As though encouraging me to fulfil my duty, one fell upon a stone altar in the centre of the space. Passing it, I felt an odd warmth. A bizarre comforting sensation, like when you scraped your knee as a child and your mother cradled your head against her chest, lulling the injury away. I shook it off and continued through a door at the far side of the room, and the instant I did, shadows in the corner of my eye seemed to swell. Invisible arms, or perhaps claws, reached out and caressed the hairs along the back of my neck, making themselves known.

Voices—either something unseen or part of my subconscious, I'm still not sure which—spoke from behind the cover of darkness. *Turn back. Complete the ceremony, and all will be forgiven…*

My stomach went up and down in giddy heaves. It wasn't too late, I could still go ahead with the ceremony. Didn't all deacons get those 'first time' jitters? Wasn’t this a perfectly natural reaction? No need to condemn my loved ones over a little performance anxiety…

My feet became rooted to the spot; I suddenly couldn’t budge a single inch. The weight over my shoulder doubled, tripled. How much longer until low tide? Should I throw myself at the mercy of the others and beg forgiveness?

As if reading my thoughts, Lyle stopped, faced me, and said, “We’ve time yet.”

“You sure?” I stammered, my breath steaming up.

“You don’t spend thirty years on the waves without developing a nose for these things.”

I suppressed those wicked thoughts, hating myself for even contemplating the idea. Quickly I followed him through the door, along another passageway, and outside.

About 100 or so yards ahead, a fishing boat bobbed up and down, crying out each time a strong wave made it bump against black rocks. Lyle had set out a lantern on the pebble beach to mark its position.

The old man lit a cigarette and smoked it as we walked. “You got a plan worked out?”

“Yeah. I’ll find work as a fisherman, maybe rent a little apartment while we adjust to life on the mainland.”

“Makes sense. You had a real talent for it. I was sorry to see you quit.”

I hesitated a moment. “How about you?”

“We’ll see,” he answered vaguely, his eyes briefly flicking toward the tribute. “That bastard saw you off I take it?”

I nodded. Up ahead, a large wave broke apart against the coast and sprayed foam everywhere.

Lyle said, “Probably still standing there reading the scriptures. It’s a shame, I’d love to see his face when he realizes you’re not coming back.”

Previously ours had been a mentor-mentee relationship, which prevented me from speaking of personal matters. All that got jettisoned out those past few weeks, though, so I said, “Heard you two had some history.”

He smiled, wrinkles forming at the corners of his eyes. “Who told you that?”

“People talk. It’s a small island.”

“What did you hear?”

“That you quit after your first—” The subject made my throat seize up, and my voice trailed off. “Anyway, Dad wasn’t happy when I went to work for you. Said the church comes above all else and that—”

“—that I disgraced the entire island,” Lyle finished, sarcastically. He reached into his jacket pocket and pulled out a photo of a smiling girl, probably seven or eight. My sister’s age.

“Your daughter?” I asked.

He nodded. “Abbey. Always knew that slimeball Michael selected her just to spite me, and this,”—he gestured at the tribute—“confirms it. Can’t be a coincidence. Broke my wife so it did. Don’t blame her for holding it against me all those years.” I detected a bitterness in his voice.

We climbed down over slippery, moss-covered rocks toward the pebble beach and then into the freezing water. As we approached the side of Lyle’s boat, the head of a golden retriever popped up over the stern.

“Ross, you remember Bella,” Lyle said casually, simultaneously untying the rope hitched around a flat, jagged rock. The dog gave a friendly bark.

With a little awkward manoeuvring I carried the tribute up onto the deck where I threw a heavy, green blanket around it. Then I scratched Bella behind the ear.

Still waist deep in the water, Lyle said, “Listen, I’ve got a favour to ask.”

“Anything.”

“Need you to take care of Bella for me. Not allergic, are you?”

“No, I’m n—wait…what do you mean?”

“The old girl can’t look out for herself.” He reached up and patted the dog's head. “A cat would be all right alone, but I dread to think what’d happen to her.”

“Why can’t you take care of her yourself?”

“’Cause I’m not going with you.”

Unable to find the right words, I simply said, “Lyle…”

He silenced me with a raise of his gloved hand. Those tired eyes studied me a while. “Time's nearly up; you best be heading off.”

“But you can’t stay here. What about your—” I didn’t know how to finish that sentence, which he got a kick out of. If anybody cared about him, he never would have offered his help in the first place.

“You could make a fresh start on the mainland,” I said, after a pause.

“Nothing for me on the mainland, kid.”

I looked from the tribute to Lyle, speechless. What else was there to say?

After he pushed the boat out, he gave it a slap and said, “Now get your skates on, time’s nearly up.”

Anxious about delaying any further, I gave him a parting salute, went over to the cockpit, positioned myself behind the wheel, and then set off, cutting through waves at cruising speed.

Bella ran to the stern and barked at her waving master, who went and sat on a rock and rolled up one final cigarette.

To the East, that first sliver of sunlight peaked out over the horizon. Now the tide had finally reached its lowest point.

364 days a year, the Holy Isle was completely inaccessible, but now, Pilgrim’s Road had become an exposed trail teaming with bladder weed and seashells. The isle and my home island were now linked together, and this year’s tribute had not been paid.

Bella lowered herself to the deck, front paws covering her eyes, moments before a hideous, inhuman scream rang out. I glanced back at the isle, where a thick storm cloud spiraled out of the castle, cut across the beach in the blink of an eye, hovered beside Lyle for several seconds, and then created a vortex encasing him.

It was the *others*, hundreds of them, clambering over each other. Countless bony arms reached out of the swirling darkness at my mentor's skull, and then all he could do was gasp for air like a drowning man as they clawed his face and chest, tearing off long strips of flesh, ripping out patches of grey hair, scalp still attached. Here and there, I spotted translucent faces. Among them, features resembling those of the girl in Lyle’s photo.

Within seconds his skull had been completely obliterated; a thick sheet of blood ran down his chest and exposed brain matter glistened under those first morning sunbeams. When the others finally finished exacting their retribution, he toppled forward and quickly vanished, taken by the water.

That entity regarded me with malice—or perhaps I imagined that part—before swimming through the air back inside the castle, toward the other side of the isle where it made for Pilgrim’s Bay.

Soon there were screams and distant cries, carried toward me from the far-off shore by the wind, loud enough that the boat engine seemed to lower its voice.

As I turned away, my hands would not stop shaking. My stomach heaved up and down every time I pictured the islanders waking up to discover what I’d done. Or hadn't done, rather.

Just as the isle disappeared beyond the horizon, the tribute began to stir. I killed the engine, letting us float peacefully on the back of a few limp waves.

Water splattered up on deck as Bella licked Katie’s face, an act that quickly brought her back to the world of the living.

Leaning close to her, I said, “Relax. I’m here. Everything’s going to be okay.”

She sat up shivering, her cheeks red as if smacked, her pupils large and dilated. I pulled the blanket further around her chest and rubbed her arms.

“Ross?” she said, her voice tired and groggy. “Where are we?”

“We’re on a boat.”

“Why are we on a boat?”

“Because we’re going on a trip, you and me.”

Bella barked. “Oh, sorry. And Bella.”

I watched my sister struggle to process this information. She later told me the events of that morning didn’t feel real—that she thought she dreamed it all.

I threw an arm around her waist and carried her toward the wheel, beside me.

Already half asleep again, she yawned, nested her head against my chest, and said, “Where are we going?”

“To the mainland,” I answered.

“I always wanted to go there,” she said lazily, eyelids drooping shut. Bella placed her head on Katie’s lap.

To the East, that first slivof sunlight peaked out over the horizon. Now the tide had finally reached its lowest point.ief, and then set a course for our new home.s

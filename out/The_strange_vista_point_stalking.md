One night, back when I lived in a car with my husband and two dogs, some strange shit happened to my husband and I. 

It had been at least eight nights since I'd been able to sleep well, so I was pretty damn tired and grouchy. As I lay down in the makeshift bed in the back of the car that night, I pretty much immediately started falling asleep. Since it was almost midnight, it was pretty quiet at the Vista Point by then. 

Just as I was barely starting to dream, there was an urgent shaking to my shoulder. Loudly, I startled awake and demanded "what?" Upon doing that though, I opened my eyes and quickly realized that our car was illuminated in a very bright light. Since it was a popular Vista Point, it wasn't that unusual to see other vehicles with people pulled over beside you. Plus, it was dark so the light was necessary. 

By then, I heard this strange male voice saying "sorry, I just thought maybe you needed some light since your car was so dark over there is all." My husband immediately responded with "no thanks man, we're actually going to sleep that's why we have it so dark over here." For a few seconds, I heard only silence, until the stranger answered with "well, what if I needed more light or something?" An odd thing of him to ask, seeing as how, he was the one with the bright light, which he was pointing at our car! 

So I spoke up, finally replying with "we don't have any good lights." The stranger simply replied "oh." So once again, I rolled my eyes, hard that time, putting my headphone back into my ear and I rolled back over once again, to try to sleep. I noticed the bright light that the guy had on our car quickly turned off and then I heard his vehicle start up and pull out of there. So naturally after that, I started to drift drift off to dreamland once again. 

To my great dismay, not even 20 minutes later, I got another, more frantic feeling shake to my shoulder. That time though, I was getting pretty pissed off, so I set up and glared at my husband and angrily hissed out a "what?!" Through clenched teeth. "They're back and they're walking around out there" he said with panic creeping into his tone. So I again, pulled the headphone out of my ear and listened for a second. I did hear footballs on the blacktop as I kept listening, though I noticed that the footsteps sounded like they were headed to one of the two RVs that were also parked there for the night. The two RV Vehicles were parked directly across the circle of a Vista Point from us. 

Seriously pissed off at that point, I hissed to my husband, "I'm pretty damn sure that it's just someone going back to one of the two RVs after going pee or whatever, now please just let me go back to freaking sleep!" I guess now would be the time to illiterate on the layout of said Vista Point. It's basically a large cul-de-sac that overlooks a large man-made Reservoir. In fact, it's the sixth largest in my state. It also happens to be the location of one of the Cary Stayner murders, Aka, the Yosemite serial killer. Anyways, people often trek across the large cul-de-sac in order to use the bathroom so to speak. 

On the freaking real though, yet again, not even 10 minutes later this time, another freaking shake on my shoulder! That time, I just sat up and yelled pretty loud "what the hell now?" My husband began to whisper to me in a panic, "another car just pulled up and when it did, two guys came out of the RVs and met up with the dude in the car." I tried to angrily cut in, but my husband interrupted me with "they were talking and then all three of them looked over towards our car then they started walking towards us with their flashlights on, but then they turned them off when they were about halfway to our car." 

Since I still had one of my headphones in, I didn't quite catch all of what he said at the time. So, now I should also tell you that, I'm the kind of person who when being woken up, I get pretty pissed, pretty quick. So, I kind of lost my s*** on my poor husband, and I started basically yelling at him. My husband respond by hissing at me to either get up front so he can start loading the car back up, or to stay where I was in the back and he would pretty much just pile shit on top of me. I yelled some more, but I did eventually get up front. 

Thankfully, we got out of there safely. My husband told me on our way out that the first dude with the bright light on her car, had a huge hunting knife strapped to his waist! My husband also told me that when I started yelling after being startled awake several times, that all three guys turned around and slowly dispersed. We'll never know if the incidents were related, but that's one hell of a coincidence that those three guys were coming at our car less than 20 minutes later don't you think? So, creepy vista point stalkers, let's not meet ever again.

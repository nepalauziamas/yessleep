There is something wrong with the banks of the world because I used to work in one.

This started when I was working in Beecham's Bank located in the United Kingdom, and its existence is almost legendary. 

The bank itself was founded by John Beecham in the early 19th century who was a successful financier and entrepreneur.

However, there was a disturbing side to him nobody talks about that being he was a member of the Society of Financial Preservation, a group of bankers, merchants, and descendants of the original conspirators in the Gunpowder Plot who escaped to the New World only to come back more successful than ever.

Also, I heard they were involved with the Salem witch trials and escaped back to England under the guise of Catholics to avoid persecution.

This was a wild rumor and I was told over and over again but didn't believe it until my research discovered something more sinister was going on.

The following is so dreadful that I even doubt existence sometimes but I'll do my best to explain what happened to me at Beecham's Bank.

I was working at my desk one day and a lady came in and asked me if she could open a vault deep in the basement area but something was off about her.

She had a grin on her face and bloodshot eyes that looked like it was caused by insomnia. 

Then she introduced herself as Mrs. Crenshaw and has been waiting to open a vault of her late husband Mr. Crenshaw. 

Mrs. Crenshaw looked like she was in her late forties and early fifties with long gray hair, cold eyes, and smelled of old perfume.

Then Mrs. Crenshaw said, "I am trying to get access to paper documents that my late husband left me in his will at the bank" and then grinned intensely. 

I asked for her ID and information about the documents and gave Mrs. Crenshaw the key to open the vault as a shadowy figure ran across the hallway but didn't notice it at the time. 

The figure was picked up later by a security camera and it was the catalyst of what happened next.

But this was not the only terrifying thing about this whole ordeal and I am still debating going to the authorities even if it makes me look like a lunatic so be it.

Then Mrs. Crenshaw left around closing time which was 5:30 p.m. and I was there alone inspecting the rest of the vaults and heard a scratching sound coming from a locked room.

I shouted, "Hello, we are closed for the night and will open back up at 9 a.m. please return in the morning!" and didn't hear a thing until a few minutes later.

This time I heard a growling sound coming from the same room that was supposed to be locked and thought it was the pipes making weird noises.

Then I turned on my flashlight and saw it, a tall skinny pale creature with glowing red eyes, a disfigured face like a wolf, and rows of sharp teeth it had claws the size of daggers on each hand.

My body froze in terror as it growled at me ready to take down its prey which was, unfortunately, me.

I slowly backed up to the corner waiting for the beast out of hell to finish what it started.

But I was surprised that the lights suddenly came on and the beast retreated into the dark corridor.

What I saw next still gives me nightmares to this day, a pile of human skeletal remains where the creature retreated after shining my flashlight in the dark was neatly separated with bones in one pile and skulls in the other.

Also, I saw 19th-century Victorian clothes belonging to men and women, especially the poor people who couldn't afford the payments on time, and assumed that they were sent down here to meet their deaths.

I was furious and scared at the same time at the thought this is how they treated people who were part of the lower class and practically starving to death only to be killed by the bank.

Then I heard a voice saying, "Now you know the terrible secret we can't let you leave now!" and it came from Mrs. Crenshaw who is just standing there staring at me holding up some papers.

I picked up a fire hydrant and threatened her if she didn't let me leave peacefully and then heard a growling sound behind her. 

She looked back and turned pale as Mrs. Crenshaw mumbled to herself as the monster picked her up by the neck and tossed her across the room. 

I hurried out of the basement of the bank as a huge iron door slammed in the back of me and locked on its own.

Then I heard screaming and growling coming from the other side and a pool of blood was coming from the bottom of the door and everything went blank.

The next thing I remember was waking up in a hospital bed with a nurse next to me and saying, "You are finally awake!" with an astonishing look on her face.

Then I asked, "What happened to my arm and leg?" trying to make sense of the situation.

She said, "You were in a very terrible accident and rushed to the hospital!" while she was changing my dressings. 

The news reporter on the television came on and said, "We have breaking news there was a robbery that went wrong at Beecham's Bank in Leeds there is at least one person dead and one missing!" and I felt a chill go down my spine knowing who they were referring to.

When I saw that surveillance footage aired on the news report my heart jumped out of my chest as the creature was making its way down the old corridor. 

But everybody chalked it up as being a homeless man who committed a heinous act of murder and is still on the run to this day.

I told the police what happened and they took my statement but didn't hear anything else about it until months later.

Mrs. Crenshaw had an affair with a young man who supposedly murdered her husband for life insurance, and when she refused to pay him the man killed her as well.

But I know the truth end it will haunt me for the rest of my life because the bank was shut down for a while but then reopened under new management keeping the old name Beecham's Bank.

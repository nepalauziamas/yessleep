[Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/ul0upc/the_mimic_an_urban_legend/)

Last night's sleep was harsh. I kept seeing it in the shadows and in my dreams, chasing and taunting me. I'm crossing the state right now. Hopefully, it stops following me and all of this is just a fever dream.

If you ever find any video or photo of the Mimic, or even a sketch of it, don't look at it. No matter what, don't look at it. Forget about what I said last time. Do not search for a solution because there is not one and even if there is one, it's not worth the risk.

But before anything happens to me, I need to tell everyone about the truth. I need to tell everyone what had actually happened to Matthew that night.

Video 2 (October 28th 2021):

The video started just like the first one. It was just as blurry, but this time it didn't take Matthew much time to start talking.

"It's true. I saw it."

His voice sounded weak, and I could tell he was frightened. He took a long pause before continuing.

"Today was Mike's birthday. I went to his party, and we just played video games for most of the time. I guess it was a nice way to help me get my mind off that thing we found yesterday. For the majority of the day, Frank was just watching us play, so I asked if he could get me a glass of coke, and he didn't oblige."

He took a deep sigh, before he continued.

"When Frank came back and handed the glass of coke to me... I saw something behind him. It was behind his shoulder, hiding. I could only make out the face. I think it was grinning, I couldn't really tell, but once I blinked, it was gone. I told Frank about this, but he just laughed at me and suggested that I should get a proper night's rest. "

I took a second to think about the last sentence. What if all of this was just because of lack of sleep? I haven't had proper sleep this entire week, and what if that is causing me to see all this stuff.

"He's probably right. I should stop thinking about this and just try to sleep tonight. Maybe tomorrow it'll be gone, but I'm scared... what if it doesn't go away? Gosh, I don't know what to do. I feel like I'm going crazy, but I thought I still had time. Well, if you're watching this, don't ever try to find out anything about this entity... and I think it would be better for you, if you just stop here. If I do make more videos, do not watch them. If you find this camera, throw it in the garbage after destroying it. I don't want anyone else to know about the Mimic."

I could've never written this story, if I just followed what Matthew and, and I may have never known what were in the next three videos, but I couldn't let his death go by like that. He wasn't murdered that night by burglars. Something else happened, and maybe I can bring him back. Maybe he's still alive, and I can destroy the Mimic once and for all.

"Alright, I think that's enough for today."

He took the camera into his hands and ended the video.

Video 3 (October 29th 2021):

The video started out blurry like the last ones, and I could only see a small part of Matthew's face, which was illuminated by a small tube light in the room.

"I'm not crazy. All of this is real, but now I wish *I am* crazy."

His voice sounded startled, and it seemed like something happened from the last video. He took a sigh before he continued.

"I saw it everywhere. All around me. I can even see it right now, in the shadows where it tries to stay, hidden. I see it hunching over me when I'm on the bed, trying to sleep. That's the only time it comes out of the shadows, and that's the only time I've ever seen its face apart from the party, but now I have a clear visual of it. It looked like a human, buts its face was all wrong. It was completely black with large colourless eyes. Its teeth were large and sharp, and it wasn't grinning anymore. It was laughing... like it won."

The confidence is his voice began to descend and the tension in me grew, waiting for what he would say next.

"They called me today. We all met at Frank's house. We didn't have the same energy as before. We were just teenagers and we were scared. We couldn't tell this to any adult. They won't believe us."

He put the camera down and walked towards the window.

"All of us would've been playing some random video game, if we never found that diary. I thought the Mimic would just go after me because I kept thinking about it, but all my friends see it now. If you're still watching this... just stop. I'm not even asking anymore, I'm pleading you to stop. I don't want anyone else to face the same fate as us."

He walked back towards the camera and held it to his face. Tears were streaming down his checks and fear was evident through his eyes.

"This video isn't meant to be watched by you. It was a video made for me. My mom said that just talking about it would help out with my depression. I just wanted to talk it out. I didn't want it to end up with an entity following me everywhere. Alright, I'll see you tomorrow, if I still survive."

The video ended.

The video wasn't meant to be seen by me or anyone. This entire time, he was just talking with the camera. He didn't want anyone to see it and even if anyone did, he wanted them to stop. I should've respected his privacy, but I didn't. I had to know what happened to Matthew.

What if he didn't die? When the police found him, he was disembowelled. They never identified whose body it was, but they guessed it was Matthew's because Mary claimed so, but what if it wasn't. What if Matthew somehow survived. I needed answers. I wanted Mary to know the truth of what happened that night. If Matthew is alive, then maybe even her husband might be alive as well.

I pressed on the next video as fast as I could.

Video 4 (October 30th 2021):

The video started out like the other ones. It was the second to the last video. Matthew was sitting this time, rather than lying on his bed. He looked into the camera with a tired face.

"Gosh, how did I even get here? A god-damn diary ruined our lives."

As he was speaking I saw something in the background, behind him within the shadows. I could only make out 2 round balls in the shadows, but I just thought it was because the camera was not able to pick it up properly.

"The rest of the diary wasn't readable, it seemed like gibberish and the handwriting was different. Mohammad took the diary home. His grandfather knew the language in which it was apparently written in it. His grandfather translated it and told Mohammad what was in it. Back in the 4th century, there was this entity that was roaming around in a town, killing anyone who would see it. It would mimic whoever it would kill and lure more victims by mimicking their loved ones. Eventually, the entity was sealed by a group of monks in a glass jar, saving the town's people. However, a couple centuries ago, the jar broke and the entity escaped. That town which it haunted is now the town I live in. The diary had instructions on how to seal it, but the pages got stained with a red pigment and were unreadable."

Matthew took a deep sigh. All of his hope was lost, and his was ready to face the wrath of the thing.

"The only way to avoid it, is to not look at a photo, video and drawing of it. We saw a drawing of it in the diary, so it attached itself onto us.  If you ever find this diary, burn it."

He showed the diary to the camera. It was an old brown, rugged diary. It was a miracle that it was still intact.

"All of us are going to die, but we had to try to stop it. I tried to put salt all around the house, held the cross in front of it and began to read lines from the bible. It didn't budge. It just stood in the shadows, smiling at me. I don't think there's a point anymore. You can't reverse your actions. This is why I'm warning you. This was never meant to be discovered by us, but we... came across it on accident."

He began to break down and couldn't stop crying.

"If anything happens to me, and you're watching this, please tell my mom that I love her. I really do. And... tell her I'm sorry."

Matthew put his hand over the camera and the video ended.

Video 5 (October 31st 2021):

The video started out with Matthew's face in view. He was hiding. His face was illuminated by the yellow tube light in his room. He was hiding under his bed. He was looking at the small opening between the door and the wall and listening closely to the loud sounds from the other rooms. It sounded like dishes were crashing, and there were occasional shrieks coming from the lower floor. It wasn't until 5 minutes into the video that he said a word.

"It came inside."

He didn't say another word for a couple of minutes. All I heard was him sobbing and trying to mutter something, but it wasn't clear. Eventually, the noise from the other room diminished and was gone. He gained the courage to get up on his feet and slowly opened the door of his room. He peeked through it and through the camera, I was able to see nothing. It was just his house. It seemed normal. He slowly moved downstairs, towards the kitchen. I tried to make out what he was showing the camera, but it was hard to see anything due to how blurry and grainy everything was. It took a couple of seconds for the camera to focus, but once it did, I was able to see it...

I saw the Mimic.

It was standing there. Towards the end of the kitchen with its back facing the camera. It was atleast 6  feet and entirely black. It had a human body, but just seemed... unreal. The floor was filled with broken plates and cutlery. Everything was quiet, until I began hearing a noise from it.

It was laughing like a maniac. I could see its head moving. It seemed so unnatural. And then it stopped. Everything went quiet again.

"I've been waiting a long time, Matthew."

My heart dropped. The thing spoke.

The thing's head snapped at a 180Â° angle. Its face was all messed up, black face, red pigment around its mouth and sharp teeth that were visible through its grin.

Matthew made a run for it as that thing chased him. I could hear its footsteps pounding the floor. He ran all around the house with that thing behind him, occasioanlly banging into the tables spersed through the rooms. He was eventually able to loose the thing, but it was still close. He got into his parents' room and closed the door behind him. He turned around to look at his parents who were lying still on the bed. He walked towards the bed with the camera in his hand. There was no light in the room and the camera could barely pick up anything. He pulled down the blanket over his dad. There was blood all over his dad's face and his throat was slit. He covered his mouth as he let out a shriek. He looked at his mom who was still under the sheets. He ran out of the room, fearing that his mom must have faced the same death.

He ran back to his room and locked the door. He went back to his hiding spot and began to sob. He tried to be as quiet as possible, but it was imossible for him to hold back his emotions.

"I just want to wake up, please. Just please let me just wake up."

He stayed there for a few minutes until he reached out for his phone which was on the ground in front of him. He called his friends, but they didn't answer it. He lost of his hope.

He was going to face the same fate as his dad.

"I think it got to them before me. They're all dead... and its all because we read some stupid diary!"

I could feel the rage in his voice. He was tired of all of this. He lost his friends, his dad... and now he would face his demise just like them.

He put his phone in his pocket and let out a tried sigh.

"I hope... I can just sleep and never wake up soon."

He remained in the same place, under the bed for a minutes and thats when the footsteps started. There was something coming towards his room. He remained as silent as he could. Something was shuffling through the rooms and checking all of 'em. Suddenly, there was a loud bang and the door and his door broke open, followed by the sounds of laboured breathing by the person who got in.

"Matthew! Where are you?"

It was Mary's voice. The concern and affection she had for Matthew was evident through her voice. She looked around the room and opened the closet door, trying to desperately look for him. Matthew stayed under the bed and tried to not even let out a breath. He knew it was his mom, but something was holding him back...

He accidently let out a breath and Mary suddenly stopped moving. She walked towards the bed and stood in front of it. The camera could only capture her feet, while the rest of her body was not visible.

Matthew tried to move to the other side of the wall, farther from his mother.

She didn't move for a couple of seconds, but then I heard her body crack...

Her complete body hunched over and her head twisted, staring into the camera with a grin.

"I've been trying to find you Matthew."

It was the Mimic.

Matthew began to scream as it lunged towards him.

"No! Please fu-"

The Mimic hit the camera and the video ended.

I got up from the couch. None of this seemed like reality anymore. I wanted this all to be a dream, but it wasn't.

How would any of this look like a burgulary? I tried to connect the dots, but nothing worked.

I walked towards the suitcase and placed it on a table. I searched for the zip and reluctantly opened it. The suitcase was filled with plastic bags that were sealed from both ends and some red liquid smeared all over it. I took out the first bag. I couldn't clearly see what was inside it. I turned it around and saw what looked like hair. The hair was covering something. It was covering a face. I tried to move the hair aside and once I finally did, I regretted doing it.

It was fucking Mary's head.

I threw up in the sink for a good twenty minutes, until I went back to the suitcase. All the plastic bags had Mary's body parts in it.

All these months, I was talking to the god damn Mimic.

I tried to get ahold of my life, but it was impossible. I had no idea what to do. It didn't make sense. I just saw Mary a few hours ago and now I'm looking at her body.

The Mimic killed the entire family. It mascarred all of them. I looked back at the clock and when I did I could swear I saw something at the corner of my eye. I thought my mind was playing tricks, but after watching the videos, I don't know what to think.

I put the bag containing her head back into the suitcase and closed it. I took the camera and put it in the sink. I took out a alochol bottle which was on the kitchen counter and poured it all over the camera. I took out the lighter in pocket and lit the camera. I watched as it burned in the sink and I began packing my stuff. I had to get out before the cops somehow got to know about the body and before... the Mimic kills me.

I packed all my stuff and began to get out throught the front door, when I heard something behind me.

*"Are you leaving me here?"*

I turned around. Nothing. There was nothing there.

I was becoming crazy. I couldn't let that happen. I can't let the Mimic win. I need to get out of here. I need to get away from the Mimic. Maybe if I can just get out of the city, the Mimic won't follow me. Maybe I can survive and warn people about it.

I don't know if I gonna survie,  but if I do. I'll try to tell you guys. I'll make everyone know what happened to Matthew. I won't let it win this time.

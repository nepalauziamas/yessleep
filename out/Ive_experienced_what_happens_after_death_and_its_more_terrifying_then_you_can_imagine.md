When I was 15 I was a typical rebel child. I was in that stage where I never listened to my parents and always got in trouble. I never did drugs or smoked but I didn’t pay attention in school and went out almost every night, it didn’t matter if my parents allowed me too or not. They almost never even knew I was gone. I hung out with much older kids, most were addicted to drugs. I don’t know why I acted like that and most of the time regretted after but that never stopped me from doing it again and again.

I think it was the thrill that got me, the feeling that I was on top of the world. That I could do anything and everything at the same time.

But then I got into a bad car accident, it was just a random Tuesday night. I wanted to go to a concert but my parents wouldn’t allow it, saying that the concert was dangerous and that the time it started was too late especially on a school night. Of course I didn’t listen. I stormed to my room and slammed my door shut, I knew they wouldn’t bother me, knowing I was angry. Then when it was late into the night I took my dad's car keys and sneaked out. I've done it before but it was still as nerve-racking as the first time. I don’t know what happened after but one second I was on the road and the next I crashed.

I felt pain burst into every part of my body and I felt blood dripping from my head. I wasn’t completely sure what was happening and what had happened. But then a wave of tiredness fell over me. I felt my eyes close and then darkness…

When I “woke up” I was in complete darkness. It was just black, so dark couldn’t see my hands when I looked down. I heard voices though, they were faint but they were there. These voices sounded desperate, screaming and begging but no words could be made out in the cacophony of pleas, they chilled me to my bone. At first I just stood there in a daze, I had no idea what was going on. Then I remembered that I had been in my dad's car and got into an accident. The next thing I noticed was that I felt no pain, no tiredness, basically I felt nothing like I was supposed to feel after an accident like that.

At first I thought I was dreaming but my dreams were never like this. Never so vivid and when I dreamed I never knew I was dreaming.

So I crossed that opinion out, the next one I thought of was that I had been kidnapped or put into a prank show of some kind. So I screamed my lungs out, I thought the voices would respond but they didn’t. I felt something touch me, it was cold and bony, the one single touch felt as if I had been burned, and this made my fear explode. I started to run, I ran for what felt like forever. I didn’t feel tired so I just kept running. I ran for a while but then I just stopped because I saw nothing, there was nothing, just darkness and the voices. I was confused and afraid, I felt there was something was watching me but I couldn’t see through the darkness. I didn’t know where I was and that was when my mind began to go mad. 

I broke down, it felt strange to break down and during my breakdown the voice never stopped, not once. After it I tried to sleep but no matter how hard I tried I couldn’t. It then came to me how strange it was that I didn’t feel tired at all after all that running. I wasn’t someone who could run long distances, I was the type to walk breathing up stairs and at the top of them I was  hard. I felt stranded and I was. It was just me, my mind and the voices in this empty pit of darkness. 

I stayed sitting in the darkness for what felt like hours, or maybe even days. I couldn’t tell what time it was as there was no sun here, no way to tell time. There was nothing. This is when I begin to lose all hope of getting out. The voices were still there and occasionally I would feel as if something had touched me. Something that felt like a hand. This sent chills up my spine. It would happen every so often and when the thing touched me it always felt as if I was being burned. Whenever this happened I just ran.

Then I saw a light, it was small but it was there. I got up quickly chasing after that light, I don't know how long I ran for but eventually I reached the lights. The closer I was to the light the louder the voices got. When I was just about to step through, something stopped me. It was a hand, it grabbed me, then thousands of hands appeared grabbing onto me. Trying to drag me away from the light. I struggled as hard as I could but there were so many hands.

They slowly pulled me away from the light. These voices were so loud as if they were screaming into my ear. Some begged for me to stay, others yelled demanding I did. They were all so terrible and didn’t let go of me. I struggled and struggled but when I was finally about to give up something pushed me. It pushed me towards the light instead of trying to keep me back in the darkness.

I whispered a thanks before finally running into the light and when I did, I opened my eyes, really opened them. I was in a hospital. I could tell by the machines and the needles connected to me. I was so tired that I closed my eyes again, this time falling asleep into a real dream. When I woke up my parents were there. When I saw them I started sobbing uncontrollably, they must’ve thought I really regretted what I did. They had no idea how right they were.

When I got better they told me about the car accident and how I was deemed dead for minutes and then just came back. I realized that the empty pit of darkness I was in was what would happen after death and time there worked differently than here. My parents were so worried about me and after that accident I completely changed. 

It’s been almost 2 years since that accident, I’m 17 now, and though my parents would never admit it I know they were glad the accident happened because after I changed. I got my life together, I began doing well in school, stopped going out so much, started hanging out with kids my own age, and spent more time with my parents. Of course I miss my old reckless ways sometimes but I love my life now. I never told anyone about what happened, they wouldn’t believe me even if I did. They probably say it was a bad dream and maybe it was.

Though I have begun fearing death more than the normal person at least. Sometimes I’m afraid to step out of my house, afraid to do anything reckless. My friends sometimes joke about how much I have changed. But what I fear really isn’t death but what happens after it. As when I was deemed died for minutes, it felt like hours or even days had passed in the darkness. I remember the hands the horror I felt when they latched onto me. I know now what waits for me after death and that’s what scares me the most…

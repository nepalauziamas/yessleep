I don’t know where else to post this, if I tell anyone they will think I’m crazy and I can’t risk that. I’m hiding in my wardrobe writing this, if anything happens to me this is my story.

So a few months ago I moved into a new house. It’s in the middle of the woods so quite creepy and no neighbors for at least 5miles. 

The first week went well nothing out of the ordinary just working and coming home late to my dogs sleeping on the couches. Normal right?

Week 2 Tuesday, I came home about 10pm and decided to make dinner for myself and feeds the dogs. While I’m microwaving yesterday’s leftovers, I see something crawling in the corridor that wasn’t my dogs. It resembled something of a spider but human size and instead of 8 it’s had 4legs. It was as if it was a human crawling around in a weird position. The only way I can describe it is it sticking it legs out and bending then like a spider, and arms in front of its head.

My dogs begin barking and growling and chasing it under the stairwell. I just assumed I am seeing things and go back to tending to my dinner. 
I couldn’t help but take a quick glance back and I saw it stand up to open the basement door.

It was about 6,2 and had black thin hair only going up to it’s ears. It wasn’t wearing anything but it wasn’t human it did have Normal “parts” it was a thin torso, long arms, long legs and a thin head. 

As any SANE person I take my dogs out in the car and drive to my sisters to “visit” my sleeping nieces. I must of driven for about an hour until I Calmed down and processed what I saw, I can’t drive back at least not alone. 
 

I stayed with my sister overnight and decided to take a day of work to show her and my nieces the house. My youngest niece is 7 and she brought her favorite Barbie toy . 

When they left I realize that she left the Barbie and decided to leave it on the table in the living  room. I went to bed and in the morning it disappeared. Eh the dogs probably got to it.

Friday, the toy turned up by the basement door it’s legs and arms contorted in the position that the creature I saw on Thursday weird right. Well I thought nothing of it I’m just going to walk my two lurchers 

When I came home I saw through the curtains higher up bright green eyes just like large cat eyes. When it saw me it’s head bounced back and I’m not sure what it was and where it went 

Nothing happened until 2months later it’s was about 12:30 at night I’m trying to sleep and I hear a muffled crying noise almost like a groan of pain
Coming from downstairs I just ignored it and went to bed probably a fox or something. 

After that night it became a regular occurrence 
Up until now 
Friday 29 of July it’s 11:56 pm 
I’m currently hiding in my wardrobe while my dogs are outside. 

I came home made dinner and made my way past the stairwell into the front room. It was in the front room just stirring there staring out the window. Before entering I took a step back into the hallway to go back to the kitchen and open the back door for my dogs. The time was 10:01 I was literally so shocked and went into panic mode. I’m not sure why I didn’t run out the door into my car, when I’m stressed I don’t think straight. I ran to my room and hid in my bed.

It was crying again… I decided that the dogs will go out to find help or something I don’t know but their best chance is being free. I blocked up my door with my bedside table and took my blanket into my wardrobe

**Ding**

*Huh?*

**Ding**

*What the—*

**Ding**

I put the pillow over my head and went back to sleep. *They can wait. Probably fuckin’ Kate again with a damn booty call or some shit. Doesn’t she ever get enough?*

**Ding**

I groaned, still ignoring the phone. *I swear to God, I will flush it down the toilet if it doesn’t SHUT THE FU—*

**VVE, VVE, VVE**

*”Crazy train”* starts blaring from my phone. *Great, how am I supposed to ignore THAT?* By either a miracle or the grace of God, whoever the jackass was that decided it’d be appropriate to harass me over the phone at fucking 4 in the morning — *on a work night* — hung up before the first guitar riff ended. *Guess it wasn’t THAT important after all.*

That’s what I thought anyways. Yet, here I am, unable to sleep because of what happened. How I hate irony, especially over something so trivial. What I wouldn’t have given now to have just sucked it up and answered that goddamn phone.

It was Thursday morning last week that I got those texts and phone call. When I woke up again, at around I’d say 6:15 like usual, that was when I looked at the texts. They were from my uncle Don. I hadn’t seen or heard from him in years, not since our last family cookout about two or three years back, when I remember he, my father, and grandfather all got into a heated argument about... something.

I never knew what it was then, nor did I ever bother to ask. All I knew was, it was enough to both drive uncle Don away from the family almost entirely, as well as put my father into an especially bad mood for a few days after (of course, it wasn’t like he was ever one to really be in a “good mood” anyway). And from that day, no one in my family would ever talk about him or bring him up.

Then I saw the texts that morning. There were three of them, all misspelled, too, like he might’ve been in a hurry when he was typing them.

**— “Jak, ples!”**

**— “[DONT EVR GO HOME!](https://www.psychotoxin.com/?fbclid=IwAR3-rwRLKgt6B-fF8UHHdPL0307jiuOIW8TzjE7HQ08B1EawDDhWwb-PqtE)”**

**— “The truth will kill U!”**

Obviously, my first thought with this was *What the hell?* I’d known Uncle Don to be a bit of an oddball, but this seemed different. Somehow, I felt like I just knew these texts were genuine. He was panicking about *something*. But what?

I looked at my voicemail. Sure enough, he’d actually left a message. I clicked on it to play the message. It was hard to hear, sounding like there was some kind of interference on the other end.

*”Jack! Answer your phone, please!”* The message seems to pause for a moment, hearing only the static. When Uncle Don came back, he was shouting. *”Stay away from the house, Jack! It looks like me! It's coming for me, it’s too late! Stay away from home, while you still...”*

The audio faded into complete white noise after that and continues for the last thirty seconds of the message. I immediately tried calling him then. Straight to voicemail, though. Both times. The second time, I left a message of my own, telling him to call me as soon as he got it. I didn’t hear back, though, and it was an entire day later before I ever found out why.

It was the next morning, early. I'd been woken up to a knock at my door. Groaning, I shambled out of bed and went to answer. The knocking at the door was persistent, too. I hated when people did that.

Peeping through the door, I saw that it was my sister, Lisa. She was in tears. *Oh God, he did it again, didn't he? Damn it, I thought she'd finally gotten rid of that rat bastard.* I could feel every muscle in me tense up as I gripped the doorknob. I was ready to throw the door open, embrace her as tight and close to me as possible, and demand the she tell me where that shit-heel boyfriend of hers, Francis, was. Another half-round of knocks sounded before I finally did open the door.

"Oh God, Lana, are you okay?" I asked desperately. She sniffled. I pulled her close and said "Shhh, it's okay... It's okay." She sobbed in my arms for another minute before I gestured for her to come inside to talk about it. I'd have asked her the million dollar question right there on my porch if I wasn't still in my fuckin' boxers.

Inside, I sat Lana down on the couch. I gave her another minute to clear herself up when she finally spoke. "Jack, Don... Uncle Don, he's... Oh god, he's dead, Jack." My eyes widened.

"What?" I exclaimed. "When?"

She sniffed, "Two days ago. They found him yesterday, though, after a neighbor reported screaming."

*Two days ago...* My heart sank. *B-but that was when...*

I looked at my phone. Up until then, I'd simply put the whole thing out of mind. I figured, if anything, I'd have gotten a call from him calling the while thing a hoax. "Wh-What happened?"

"God, it was awful. Have you not seen the news?" I shook my head. Following the night he'd tried to call me, I hadn't managed to do much other than work. "They found him all over the place, Jack."

"You mean like a break-in?" She shook her head wildly.

"I don't know. They didn't tell me anything. All I know is somebody killed him, Jack." I hugged her again and offered to make some breakfast. She declined, though, saying she had to go. She left and I was alone in my living room again.

*Murdered?* I wondered. I spent the next hour and a half or so trying to think of just *who* the hell would want uncle Don dead like that. I remembered him being the kind of guy to want to keep to himself most of the time. The guy didn't have many friends, sure, but I didn't think he'd made any real *enemies*, either. I mean, other than pissing off Dad and grandpa, but they wouldn't have wanted him *dead*, would they?

I knew it wouldn't have been grandpa. He passed two years back. That'd leave Dad, then. Of course, I wasn't real set on the idea, though. I mean, again, it wasn't like he *hated* the guy. Even still, though, he was the only one that could tell me why he and grandpa shunned him for so long. I decided then to call up Dad, seeing if he'd want to meet somewhere for breakfast that morning.

We ended up meeting at the Diner just across the street from the big shopping mall on the other end of town at around 11:00 that morning. I arrived early, with him only being about five minutes behind me. "Hey Jack." He said, smiling and pulling me in for a hug. "How've you been?"

"I've uh... I've been okay." I replied, anxious to dive right in to the matter at hand. He sat down and the waitress came for drink orders. I ordered a large sweet tea while he got a cup of coffee; black, the only way he and grandpa would've drank it. "So what's got you giving me a ring?"

I took a gulp of my tea and asked "You heard about Uncle Don?" His smile instantly fell. I took another swig of tea while he did the same with his coffee. Another moment passed between us in an awkward silence.

"Yeah." he said finally, in an annoyed tone.

"Has anyone said anything about how it might've happened? Any ideas of who it was, maybe?" He scoffed dryly.

"No, don't really reckon they have."

"Lana told me they think it might've been a break-in."

"Not likely. The way my brother loved his guns, if anybody *was* damn stupid enough to try breaking in his house, I'd find it more likely it'd be the *other guy* they carried out of there on a gurney." He had a point there. Like most "bad uncles" you'd hear about, Uncle Don was very much an outdoorsman. I remember the times he'd take me and Lana hiking through the different mountain trails up in Grenview Pines. I also knew, at least when he still kept at least minimal contact with the family, that he'd go up there about every fall or so to take a holiday, usually to go hunting for deer, which he'd then bring over for Thanksgiving dinner that year. Christmas, too, if we were lucky.

Point is, the man could shoot, and loved to do it. Therefore, like Dad said, robbery was ruled out of the equation for me. "Dad..." I began hesitantly. Dad looked up, clearly not comfortable with this conversation. To a degree, I almost wish I had just left it all there. "What happened between you two? I mean, you two used to be cool with each other. What happened at that family cookout?"

This was when he stared coldly, intently, at me. I felt the urge to try walking back the question, but I didn't. I persisted. "Dad, what happened between you and Uncle Don?"

"Son, I'm not in the mood for this right now, okay? let's drop the subject now, please."

"But Dad, What if it has something to do with what happened?" He raised his eyebrow at me in alarm.

"What do you mean?" he asked.

"Well what if whoever did this was a part of whatever turned you two on each other in the first place?" He slowly shook his head.

"No son," he said, sighing in utter annoyance, "It wasn't nobody that had anything to do with that. There wasn't anybody else involved in that. Not that *I'd* have known of anyhow."

"What do you mean? What are you talking about, involved with *what?*" I stopped when he slammed his coffee mug down, eyeing me like a lunatic.

"I said enough!" he growled. I shrank back down in my seat. "There's a damn good reason we stopped talking to each other, Jack. Our family's had enough to deal with without that son of a bitch carrying on the way he was, okay? And I hate that this happened, but damn it, I'm not getting sucked back into that shit again!"

*"Again?"* I wondered, raising my eyebrows at him in confusion. I'd have probably pressed the question, had he not made it perfectly clear by that point that he was in absolutely no mood to continue the conversation. The waitress came back again and we ordered our food. I guess whatever it was between him and my uncle was enough for him to basically ruin his appetite, too, because he only ordered a slice of cheesecake with a small bowl of ice cream. We ate in a very tense silence and when he was finished, he silently got up, flung a $20 bill on the table and walked out of the diner without another word.

I guess that, funny enough, was what ended up ruining *my* appetite and I ended up not even finishing my own plate of sausage and eggs. After paying and leaving the diner, I got in my car and was about to just head back home when I got another idea instead. I figured, if I was going to get any kind of answers as to what happened, I'd need to go to his house, myself. Of course, there was the immediate drawback to this idea, being that I was explicitly warned to stay away.

At the same time, though, why? Just what was it that made the old family house so dangerous? I grew up in that house, and I couldn't remember anything horrible about it. But then, what was it that he was warning me about? *"It looks like me?" what does THAT mean? And what did Dad know about it?*

All of these questions continued mounting higher and higher until I eventually caved and decided to make the 45 minute to an hour journey to the old family home. The whole way there, all I could think about was what uncle Don kept repeating through the phone. *"The truth will kill you!"*

*What truth?*

It had just gotten on 12:30 when I pulled into the driveway of the old family home in the backroads of Kings Mtn. The house sat there, surrounded on all sides by trees from the surrounding woods, looking every bit as quiet as I remembered it being. It looked every bit as old as I figured it would, too. It'd been the same house that, not only my father and uncle had grown up in, but where my grandparents had as well. The paint, which used to be a sort of beige, now faded into a more piss-yellow looking color. From where I was standing, I could see a few places where the window frames were cracked, with the one on the left side having an entire chunk missing from its bottom corner.

Aside from that, though, it looked to me like it should. Nothing overtly wrong, you know? Just a normal house in the Kings Mtn. woods. Old as hell, but normal. I got out of the car and made my way to the house.

*"Jack!"*

I stopped. turning my head, I looked to see... nothing. I looked back for at least a minute before turning and continuing on to the house. *Must've been the wind,* I thought. Listening close, though, I realized the wind was quiet, too. Not even the leaves rustled on the nearby trees. Like I said, completely silent. Calm. Peaceful.

I walked to the porch. beneath my feet, the old wood creaked loudly. I could feel them starting to give way beneath me. If I wasn't careful, the wood was for sure going to snap under my weight. I tried peeking through the window, but there was furniture or something blocking both of them. I went to open the door then.

*"Jacky-boy..."*

I stopped again. *What the hell?* I looked back again. Nothing.

*But I heard that... I know I did...*

I stood for another good ten or fifteen minutes, looking everywhere. But there was absolutely nothing around, save the trees. I closed my eyes and muttered under my breath, *"There's nothing there..."*

Taking a deep breath, I opened my eyes and turned the door knob. The door took a bit of effort, but I was able to force it open. When I did, I ended up going into a small coughing fit from all the dust that'd been kicked up. Inside, it was dark; the electricity obviously having *long* since stopped working. Pulling out my phone, I clicked my flashlight on and began to walk around.

Like the outside, everything *inside* looked perfectly normal as well, barring of course the collection of dust and cobwebs everywhere. I went around the ground level of the house, revisiting all the old rooms; one of which used to actually be mine. Every room still looked the same, like nothing had ever been moved or renovated since I moved out when I was 18. Hell, I even saw the old Metallica poster I had hanging on the wall just above my bedpost. As well as this, I even spotted some of the old family photos still hanging on the wall, along with all the old furniture.

In short, the place hadn't been touched, despite being vacant for years. I found this odd. Wouldn't a realty company or something have come and at least *tried* to renovate? Also, how come neither mom, Lana, dad, or grandpa or uncle Don, who'd lived with us during that time -- like I said, close-knit family until the incident at the barbecue -- took any of their old belongings with them? The more I stood there, walking through that old house, the more I wondered if there was more to the falling-out with Uncle Don than I could've guessed, which obviously wasn't much, considering I didn't actually *know* what sparked the proverbial "powder keg". Still, though, I just had the feeling that it wasn't just standard fare family feud bullshit, either.

*What truth was he talking about?*

I decided then to go checking around the upstairs level. The stairs groaned as I stepped up each one of them, trying to be as gentle as possible. Admittedly, the creaking, mixing with the overall quiet stillness of the place DID start to kind of get to me a bit. You know, that feeling you get when you know you're completely alone, yet somehow you feel like you aren't. Like *something* or *someone* is there with you, somehow lingering just outside your line of sight, your blind spots? Cheesy, sure, but if you were there, you'd understand what I mean.

Every room upstairs was the same as the ones below; still the way I remembered them looking back in the day, portraits, knick-knacks and all, still in the exact same place. Maybe I should clarify something; when I say the place looked the same or like it hadn't been touched since my family moved out, I don't mean that it looked cluttered or that things were strewn about, OR that everything had been neatly set. The rooms looked somewhere in between cluttered and organized. Basically, it looked like there were *supposed* to be people living there -- only without the people.

Needless to say, this raised a mountain of questions with me; starting with why. Why had the house not been touched in... God knows how long, at least since the year after I moved out, when they ended up following me down to Dallas? Why did everything still *look* like people lived here when they hadn't? Why hadn't the realty company tried to sell it to anybody else? *Hell, did THEY even know it was empty?*

*Why did Uncle Don want me to stay away from this place?* That brought up another question to me. If there *was* something wrong with this place, something that apparently drove my folks to literally just pick up and leave like that, and if he knew what it was, why did he go back to the house?

All of these questions kept leading me back two things. First was the repeated question of what the hell happened at that family barbecue, and the second was if there really *was* something about that house, then what was it and how could it "kill me"? Deep down, I knew that these, Uncle Don's murder, as well as his cutting off from the family, and Dad's disapproval of any mentioning of him were all connected somehow. The only question then, was how.

I also knew that, while me and Lana were growing up, there wasn't any mention or any way of letting on about anything bad. Unfortunately, that meant she wasn't likely to know anything, either. Not about the house itself, that is. Maybe though, I figured, it was worth a shot asking if she'd have known why Dad and Uncle Don fell out. I figured, if she *did* have any clues on that, then at least she could answer *that* question for me. More help than Dad was, anyways. I took out my phone and dialed Lana's number. It rang for the better part of a minute.

*"Jack..."*

I looked around again. *What the hell is that? Where's it coming fro--*

"Hello?" Lana's voice snapped me back into focus.

"Uh, Lana, hey... Listen, you doing anything right now?" I continued looking around the upstairs hallway. Nothing was there. *Then who was that saying my name?*

"Jack, you there?" I heard her ask.

"Yeah, I'm here, I asked what you were doing right--"

"Jack? Hello, can you hear me? Something's going on on one of our ends, I can't hear anything. Everything's all fuzzy." I frowned.

*Fuzzy?* I walked down the stairs to the living room. "How about now?"

"Okay, I can hear you a little bit now. What's going on?"

*"Come on down and pull up a chair, Jacky boy..."*

I whirled around on my heels. Nothing. Just an empty kitchen.

"Jack, hello?"

"Oh, uh, yeah, um... What're you doing right now?"

"I just got off work for the day. I'm on my way to Burger King to grab a quick bite from drive-thru before--"

"Wait, uh..." I paused for a moment, looking around. *Who's speaking to me?* "C-Can I meet you there?"

"Um... Sure. Jack, is everything okay?"

"Y-Yeah, everything's..."

*"Come join us for dinner, Jack... You've been gone so long, Mama's making something special."*

Every joint in my body locked up. That sounded like Uncle Don. It was the same thing he'd used to tell me and Lana when I used to come back home from playing outside all day when I was a kid.

"U-Uncle Don?" I muttered softly, shuddering as I stepped toward the kitchen.

"What?" I was snapped back to Lana's voice again.

"Huh?"

"You said something, then you trailed off. Seriously, is everything okay? You're starting worry me a little here."

I shook my head. "Yeah... Yeah, everything's fine. You're talking about the B.K. there on Rhodell Ave., right?"

"Yeah."

"'Kay, listen, go ahead on inside. I'll meet you there. I need to talk to you about something."

"O-Okay..." I heard her say hesitantly.

"I'll explain everything when I get there. Just sit tight, I'm about 15 minutes awa--"

*"Come down to the basement, Jack. There's somethin' there you should see..."*

I lowered the phone and ran into the kitchen. "Where are you? Come out, now!"

"What?" Lana asked over the phone. I almost didn't notice. I *hadn't* noticed I'd actually said it out loud.

"N-Nothing. I'll meet you at Burger King in 15. Love you."

"Wait, Jack--" I hung up before she could go any further. For another minute, I stood there in the middle of the kitchen.

*"Come on down, Jacky-boy... You should see this."*

*See what?* I was stuck between the urge to want to follow the voice downstairs and wanting to run out of there, screaming like I was in a cartoon. Who was there, and why did it sound almost exactly like my Uncle?

*"The truth will kill you, Jack! don't ever go back home!"* The voicemail continued cycling through my head on repeat. *"It looks like me! It's coming for me!"*

That brought back a third element to all of this to join the two I mentioned earlier. Whoever it was that he was talking about; he, too must have some sort of connection to what happened at the family Barbecue. Which also means Dad and grandpa had at least *some* kind of knowledge or connection with them as well. One more question I'd have to try getting from Lana, I supposed.

*How much COULD she actually have known? Could SHE have actually known Uncle Don's killer?*

I slowly backed my way back out of the kitchen and made my way out to the front door. Before I left, I gave one last glance back to the living room. Everything was dark. Old and dusty. Quiet.

*"The truth will kill you, Jack!"*

I closed the door and ran over and hopped into my car, taking off and making a beeline for Burger King. I ended up pulling up around 5 minutes later than I told Lana. I checked my phone, checking to see if she'd tried texting me that she wasn't waiting any longer. Fortunately, she hadn't.

I went inside and found her chewing on a chicken sandwich and a small fry. "Hey, sorry I'm late."

"Oh, you're fine." She said, taking a sip of her large Pepsi. "I hope you don't mind." She gestured towards her food.

"Oh no, you're fine." I replied, anxious. "Listen, there's some things I need to ask you about." She looked at me, urging me to go on as she took another bite of her food. "You remember the Family Barbecue three years ago?" She swallowed before pausing for a moment to think.

"Not expressly." she replied. "I mean, I remember we were all there. It was the week leading to your 23rd birthday party, and everyone was all happy and excited for that. I remember that was also the last time I saw Uncle Don."

I swallowed and asked, "Lana, do you have any idea why Uncle Don stopped showing up to family gatherings?" She paused for another moment before shaking her head.

"Not really. I mean, he and the old man kind of got into it, I remember."

"What about?" She looked at me confused. "The argument, You have any clue as to what it was about?" Again, she shook her head.

"I mean, I remember hearing them start raising their voices at each other a bit and, at least from what *I* could see, it almost looked to me like they were gonna start trading licks before granddad stepped in and broke the two up. After that, I just remember Uncle Don leaving without another word."

"You didn't happen to hear anything that was said, do you?"

"Not really. Well, I think I heard something about something or somebody in the basement of the old house. Yeah, something about Uncle Don seeing something in the old basement. Couldn't hear *what* though. That was the last time I'd seen Uncle Don before... Well..." She looked down at her sandwich like she was unsure she wanted to finish it anymore.

"He never tried to reach out to you?" I asked. She looked back up at me, raising her eyebrow in confusion again.

"No." she answered worriedly. "Jack, seriously, what's going on? You've been anxious ever since the phone call. What happened?" I sighed.

I opened my mouth to speak, but stopped. I could hear *"Crazy Train"* playing in my pocket. I gestured to Lana to wait a moment before taking my phone out. It was a call from Dad. I got up and walked outside and answered. "Hello? Da--"

"Jack!" Dad's voice shouted. My heart immediately jumped into my throat. "Jack, it's after me!"

"Dad, what's going on?!" I could tell from his voice that he was panicking. Something was wrong.

"Jack, you have to get out of here! Right now, you have to get out of town and--". his words were cut off when he let out a bloodcurdling shriek before being abruptly silenced.

"Dad?! *DAD?!"*

"You left, Jack..." This voice was different. It wasn't Dad's. It was the voice from earlier in the house; Uncle Don's voice. "You left before the the reunion, Jack. It'd *really* mean a lot to the folks if you'd come. Lana, too. We want the *whole* family."

My joints were frozen stiff. My blood felt like it'd frozen solid inside my body. Dad was in trouble. *Who is this, and why does he sound just like Uncle Don?*

"So come on home, Jack. We'll all be waitin' for you. Even the old man, here." The call ended after that. I tried calling the number back, trying to talk to the person again, but it cut to voicemail all three times I tried. It was clear, I had to go back to the house again. I went back inside strode back to the table. Lana looked up at me, worried.

"Jack, is everything okay? Who was--"

"We have to go." I said, cutting her off.

"Wh-What happened?"

"It's Dad, he's in trouble, look we have to go, now!"

"Wait, what do you mean, what kind of trouble?" I looked at her, trying to signal to her that now *really* wasn't the time for questions. Not only because Dad was in danger, but because I, myself, was just as fucking clueless. She reached out to me and said, "Jack, please. tell me what's going on."

I retracted. "Look, here's what happened; the night Uncle Don was killed, he tried to reach out to me." I pulled out my phone and brought up the text messages. "He was trying to tell me something about the old house, something about some "truth" or something, I don't know. I went there and I didn't see anything, but now, somebody or something from there has Dad, okay? There, now *come on!*"

She stared in shock at the phone. I reached out and grabbed her arm to lead her out. "Wait, where're we even going?"

I looked at her, anxiety plastered all across my face, and replied, "Home."

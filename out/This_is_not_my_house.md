So to keep this brief have you ever had a feeling something was off, but there's no reason why? Well leading up to my realization that was the feeling I've been having. 

I woke up one afternoon from a nap and although I couldn't pin point anything out of place everything felt off. I waited for my husband to get home which he did with pizza. He got my favorite but I just felt sick after. He asked what was up and I honestly couldn't give an explanation other than feeling off. He shrugged it off and said I may have had a vivid dream I just didn't remember. 

We went to bed and I went about my routine in the morning. When I got to work the feeling was even more intense. I recognize everything and everyone. I can even remember how things came to be. But it's like non of it was real. 

Because it wasn't. I figured it out nearly a month in when I realized everyone's smile was too wide. And the spots on the wall keep growing. My cats hiss when the mail comes even though they loved the mailman before the nap. They even hiss at hubby. 

But now I'm not so sure hubby is hubby. Because they were his cats originally. But now they won't let him pet them. 

The spots on the wall are starting to multiply now. It started off with 2 which became 5 then 12 then 27 now there are too many to count. They flow into each other making it nearly impossible to see where one ends and the next begins. 

Am I loosing it? Or am i the last normal human? 

The cats are gone. Hubby said they had rabies and bit him. The state of his arm is horrendous. Shredded and bitten. A fight had surely broken out between him and the cats. I know they're probably dead but I can't help but hope they're alright. 

The spots are growing still. At certain angles I catch a reflection but when I move back to look it's gone. Something's watching. 

The scratches and bite marks on hubby look weird and he doesn't physically react to any pain from them. They don't look like cat shaped bites and the puss isn't a good sign. 

The walls are watching. Listening. Whispering. 

The scratches are moving. Not like changing spots but physically moving. Wriggling. Writhing. The bite marks are worse. I can't help but gag. They're black as the night with maggots like the scratches. I think I saw bone. 

The walls are talking.

I've kept my head down most of the time. The smiles hurt my eyes. I also keep airpods in cause the voices hurt my ears. 

The walls are screaming. 

I need to get out this is not my house.

Hubby seems to be looking at me weird. Like I'm a wild animal in his house. 

He grabbed me. Pulled me close and tried to strangle me. I bit into his rotten arm hard. He let go and I grabbed the knife. 

Whatever he was he's dead now. 

They think I did it out of insanity or malice. Called me an insane killer wife. I'm awaiting my trial. Finally free from the screaming walls that were watching me. I still faintly here them like an echo in my ears. 

Now I understand what they were saying. 

"Get out this is not your house"

But the shocking part. It's my voice, but I'm not saying it to me. I was saying it to him. Am I really insane?

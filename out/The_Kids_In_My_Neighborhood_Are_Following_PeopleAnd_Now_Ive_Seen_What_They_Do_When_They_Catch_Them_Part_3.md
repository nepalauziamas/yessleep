“What’s your name?” I asked the teenager in my passenger seat. It took him a minute to respond, but then again, he’d just been almost jumped by a crowd of silent kids and been rescued by an old man with a revolver. His shock made perfect sense to me. My heart was pounding and my damned arthritic hands ached from gripping the gun.

“Cayden.” He finally sighed. “Cayden Cooper. I appreciate your help back there, Mr….?”

“Hall. But please, call me Rich.” I shook his hand.

We’d driven away from the park and the weird kids lurking in its shadows. In the headlights of oncoming cars, I got a better view of Cayden Cooper. What I saw led me to believe that this hadn’t been his first run-in with the Silent Kids (as I’d started calling them). He had a faded bruise on the side of his face…the kind you get from being punched in the mouth. Other than that, though, he was a handsome kid. Pam and I were never able to have kids or grandkids, but if we had, I reckoned they might look a little like Cayden–stupid haircut and all.

“I’m gonna drop you off at home, Cayden.” I told the kid, “but I did you a pretty solid favor back there, and I think it’s fair to ask one in return. I just wanna know what’s going on around here.”

“You won’t be able to stop it. The teachers couldn’t. The police can’t either.” Cayden kept peering out the windows–looking, no doubt, for more groups like the one that had tried to jump him.

“That kid with the earring. I thought I recognized him. Who is he?”

“Brett Halloran. The mayor’s son. All of this started with him. *Look*.”

I pulled to a stop in an empty church parking lot. Cayden took out his phone. He showed me a grainy video of a high school football field at night. The wobbly camera zoomed in on a group of kids, led by Brett, surrounding a football player. The football player looked like he was made of solid muscle, but the grass stains on his knees and sweat on his forehead told me that he was exhausted from practice–and there were a *lot* of the silent kids. When they grabbed him, he closed his eyes like he knew what was coming. Brett held a screen up to his face, and the others…*they peeled his eyelids open.* A glowing red light lit up from the screen. I’m sure that football player would have screamed…if the silent kids hadn’t been holding his jaw shut. The longer he was forced to watch whatever was on that screen, the less he struggled…although I could see what looked like tears streaming down his cheeks. When the red glow from Brett’s phone blinked off, the football player rose jerkily and stood among the rest of them.

There was a sudden scuffling sound, a hastily whispered *“aw shit!”*–and every slack-jawed, mannequin-like teenager started sprinting at the person holding the camera. The rest of the recording was just shaky footage of a person running through trees, and then…*nothing.*

“My best friend Liandra uploaded that video. She hasn’t been at school since.”

“What do you think–”

“*Drive!”* Cayden shouted.

A kid in a white baseball cap stood at the edge of the parking lot. He had raised his phone in the air, and its screen lit up with a freakish red light.

In the foggy field behind him, I saw the red glow of dozens more.

We’d been found.

I jammed the car into gear, swerving around kids as they mobbed us. One slammed a rock into the passenger-side window, cracking the glass but not breaking it.

I turned onto the empty street, and the dark shapes of the silent kids disappeared into the fog. We’d almost made it to the highway when I heard it: a *thwapthwapthwap* sound from the rear right side of the car.

“Cayden,” I asked, “do you know how to change a tire?”

There was nothing but fog and pine trees along the state route. Headlights zoomed by occasionally, but no one stopped…and I couldn’t blame them. There weren’t any of the silent kids around…*unless they were hiding in the  trees*. I stood watch and whispered instructions to Cayden while he did the real work.

“I guess we're even,” Cayden grunted when he finished tightening the last lug nut, and I had to agree: I would've never been able to put on the donut tire myself. He’d saved my ass, but we only had about fifty miles on the spare. Wherever we went, we had to make it count–and the silent kids knew where both of us lived. “Isn’t there anybody you can call?” Cayden asked.

Sad truth was, there wasn’t. My family and close friends had moved on or died a long time ago. All I really had left was…

*Neighbors.*

I called Austin Wang, my next-door neighbor, first. Someone picked up, but there was only dead air on the other side.

“Hello? Austin?” More silence, and then–*click.*

I felt a pang of worry when I saw Sammy’s name in my contacts. *It couldn’t hurt to try…*

She picked up on the seventh ring.

“H-hello?” she whispered.

“Sam!” I gasped. “It’s Rich! Where are you? Are you alright?”

“They were already in the house…” she murmured “...when you came. I didn’t want you to get hurt. I fought them off and got away, but…”

“Where are you now?! My car’s on its last legs…”

“My Uncle Hugh’s hunting cabin.” She gave me an address and some directions.

“Got it.” Cayden showed me the location that he’d already pulled up on his phone.

“It’s off of a dirt forest road in the middle of nowhere, so be careful not to get lost.”

Sammy’s warning echoed in my ears as I pulled back onto the state route and drove Cayden and myself toward safety...*or so I hoped...*

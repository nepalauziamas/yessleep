Me and my girlfriend bought a house 2 months ago and since then we've remodeled the place and moved in. It was a beautiful 2 story house with 1 master bedroom and 1 guest room after I converted our laundry room.

We decided to play hide and seek as something to help is settle in and I was going to hide first, I rushed up the stairs and saw the hall closet, simple and predictable but it was only the first round so I hurried in before my girlfriend finished counting.

I waited another 30 seconds and then I heard my girlfriend shout "READY OR NOT" I heard her walk around and 2 minutes in she had already walked past me 4 times.

After another minute I decided to get comfortable and take out my phone to browse reddit and twitter for another 15 minutes. I then heard my girlfriend frustratedly say "where are you".

Another boring 10 minutes go by and I'm asking myself "how has it taken her so long to find me", then she starts texting me.

Gf:Where are you?

Me:Not saying.

Gf:I give up you win now tell me where you are.

Me:No :p

Gf:What do you mean no.

Me:I'm on the second floor.

Gf:I've searched the entire second floor.

Me:You clearly didn't search hard enough.

For another 2 minutes I hear her furiously walking up and down the hallway and opening doors trying to find me, then she starts texting me again.

Gf:I told you to tell me where you are not give me a hint.

Me:If you dont find me in the next 5 minutes I'll tell you EXACTLY where I am.

Gf:Why are you prolonging this.

Me:Its only the first round its supposed to be easy.

Gf:Well it's not ðŸ˜¡.

Me:5 minutes.

I was prolonging it to get back at her for the prank she pulled when we were looking for a house. she came up to me and said she already bought a house she thought we'd both like under my account, she then proceeded to show me this small camper that was on sale at wish for $20,000. 

She didn't reveal it to me until after I called my bank to tell them about the purchase under my account.

For another 5 minutes I hear nothing accept the tv downstairs "shes probably waiting for time to run out"

That 5 minute mark hit and she once again texts me 

Gf:It's been 5 minutes.

Me:I'm in the second floor hallway closet.

Gf:Nice try wise guy.

Me:What do you mean.

Gf:I painted that entire hallway and I know for a fact that theres no hallway closet.

Me:You're clearly wrong.

I look up at the closet door about to reveal myself and I look in shock, the doors gone.

Gf:YOU LYING TURD.

Me:I'm stuck in the closet.

Gf:YOU'RE IN THE GUEST BATHROOM.

I remodelled that entire room to change it from a laundry room to a guest room and I know for a FACT that theres no guest bathroom.

I loaded the last of my grocery bags into the trunk of my car, I slammed the trunk shut, and began to make my way to the cart return. 
I walked back and before I could enter my car I noticed this small slip of paper, sticking on my windshield. 
I plucked the paper out from underneath my windshield wiper and read it

**805-555-5555**

My cell phone number?

I got chills down my back. 

I got in my car and locked the doors, checked the back seat real quick, and stared at the note. 

I didn’t recognize the handwriting

What was more terrifying was the small smiley face under the number. 

I looked around the mostly empty parking lot, but there was nobody close to my car. A few people loading groceries or heading into the store, but nobody near my car…

I drove home, scared and confused. 

After unloading my groceries and making dinner, I was able to calm down. 
I thought maybe it was a prank,
I teach down at the loacal high school, it was Halloween, tons of the children have my number, this made sense to me. 

Then my phone started to ring. 

**unidentified caller**

I started to feel uneasy again.

I picked up the phone, and answered the call 

“Hello?”

**gurgling**

“Who is this?”

**more gurgling**

“I’m hanging up! Don’t call me again” 

**”tomorrow”**

“What?”

**”call…. Tomorrow”**

The caller hung up 

I was scared and confused. 

I tried to block the number but when I went to my call log it wasn’t even there? 

I locked all my doors and went to sleep, or at least tried to. 


The next morning I was making breakfast, getting ready for my day when my phone rang again

**unidentified caller**

I felt nervous, and decided not to answer. 

It began ringing again. 

And again. 

Then my landline started ringing too,which I never even use, it just came with my internet. 

I finally picked up the phone. 

**answer… first time**

“Who are you?!”

**call… tomorrow”**

They hung up. 

I was starting to get scared. Tomorrow I will go to the police for sure, I packed a bag and double checked the locks on my doors and windows before bed. 

I grabbed my bag and made my way to the police station. 

When I arrived I explained the situation and they said it was probably a kid from the school I worked at, like I had originally thought. They put a bug on my landline and cellphone and told me next time they called we would trace them, and to attempt to keep them on the phone. 

When I got home they called me. 

**”been gone all day?”*

“Yes. I have, why do you keep calling?”


**”police.. can’t save”**

How did they know about the police??

“What do you want with me? Why are you calling?”

**gurgling**

“Hello?”

**want to… breathe**

“What? What does that mean?”

**”need… lungs.. need… you”**

They hung up. 

I called the sheriff after and asked if he got the call. He said he recorded all of it but when they played it back it was all gurgling noises on the other end… they couldn’t understand a thing the person on the phone said. I was in shock. As I could hear them mostly clear. He said he would keep a patrol car outside my home and we would look into it in the morning. 

The patrol car out front gave me some comfort to sleep. 

In the morning there was 3 police cars outside my home. I Ran outside to see what was going on. There was crime scene tape, and an ambulance as well, the sheriff saw me coming outside and ran to me. 

“Jane, stay there!” 

I stopped at the end of my driveway. 
I saw it. 

The policeman in the patrol car….
There was blood everywhere,
It painted the inside of his windshield.

“What happened…?” I asked
“We don’t know yet, it may or may not have to do with the caller… for now it might be best if you stayed with a friend.” He said

I agreed and went inside to pack my bags. 

My coworker Sarah agreed to let me stay in her home while she was on vacation, I grabbed her spare key from under the mat and let myself in. 

When Jen’s house phone started to ring. 

I was hesitant. 
What if it was him?

I let the machine get it

BEEP

**gurling**

**”jane”**

**gurgling**

**”coming”**

**gurgling**

**”find… Jane”**

I started crying

I called the sheriff and told him what happened immediately. He came over and we made a plan on what to do, I would leave town as soon as I could, he spent the night at Sarah’s home with me to make sure I was safe. 

In the morning he left for work, and I made plans to stay at a hotel outside of town. 

Right after the sheriff rang, Sarah’s phone rang again. 

I knew this was wrong, we unplugged her landline. I check it and it was still unplugged, chills ran around my body. 
The machine picked it up again. 

BEEP

**gurgling**

**”see you”**

My blood ran cold.

tap. tap. tap. 

I turned around, to where the sound was…
At the back window was..
Me?

It looked exactly like me,
Completely wet,
With a very wide mouth, smiling. 

Whatever it was kept tapping the window. 

I was terrified. 

“GO AWAY!” 

I screamed. 

It opened its mouth, and water starting falling out. 

**gurgling**

**”need… you”**

“WHY?!”

**”my… lungs”**

That’s the last thing I remember. 

I’ve been stuck here ever since, it’s cold, dark, wet… I can barley breathe. Every time I talk, water passes through my throat… everyone down here looks like that thing that dragged me down here.. even I am starting to look like them… please send help…

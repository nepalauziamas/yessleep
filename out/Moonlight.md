I have lived in a small hunting town for as long as I can remember. Growing up, my father always took me out hunting, and we really bonded over it. My favorite trips we used to take were at night, where we would hide in the bushes deep in the woods, but the moon always found a way to creep through the branches and find us. Even now, after my father’s passing, the moonlight has been beautiful to me, and I still go hunting in the exact bushes we always went to together. 

Eventually, after my mother passed away as well, I had to move and find my own place. I found this beautiful cottage deep in the woods not too far from where I grew up. I always have loved how the moon casts an amazing glow on my backyard. It isn’t much, but it’s enough for me to see all of the nocturnal animals come out for the night. Something about the moonlight has always made me feel at peace, has helped me sleep at night.

A few nights ago, I began noticing something rather peculiar in my backyard. It was a lone deer, that just stands there and doesn’t move. Its antlers are all bent and awkward, but I can’t see any other features. Its silhouette just stands there, motionless. While it is a little strange, the real kicker is that it seems to be getting closer to my back porch every single night. I never thought anything of it, just a strange deer with strange behavior. 

Eventually however, it started to gradually increase how close it was getting to my back porch. It was still completely motionless, just staring into the nothingness of the night. I did begin to notice the that the moonlight refracted off of its antlers in a very strange way…almost like the antlers were made of some kind of aluminum. I assumed it was the way I was looking at it strange or it was the angle, but a part of me was thinking the antlers were fake.

The next day is what changed everything for me. I looked outside, and it was on my back porch. I turned on the backlight and I saw this very crude imitation of a deer. In the dark it seemed exact, in the light it was this strange amalgamation of different animal hides, and aluminum antlers. I yelled to try to get rid of it, and it remained motionless. I ran downstairs to lock the back door and close the curtain but when I went to lock the door, it was on its hind legs, its face pressed against the glass of the back door…its eyes completely human and the moonlight refracting off the antlers. 

I panicked, pounding on the glass thinking it was some sort of strange monster-like creature until it started breathing heavily onto the glass, causing it to fog. It removed its front hoof, revealing a hand. I realized that this “thing” was a man in a costume. A sick, disgusting costume. It began to write in the breath it put on the window the simple phrase, “In the moonlight I become the hunter”.

I yelled, closed the curtains and called the police. They took what felt like years to show up, and when they did they found nothing out of the ordinary, and they told me everything was safe. To this day I haven’t seen that thing again…and I hope I never do. I still have no idea what it could’ve wanted from me…but I assume because I’m a hunter, it wants me gone. While the moonlight is beautiful always remember, it can reveal things you never wish to see.

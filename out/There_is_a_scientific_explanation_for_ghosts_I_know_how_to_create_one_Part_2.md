It started when I was an infant, Grandpa always said. Apparently, I was perfectly serene indoors, only to start wailing like a pint-sized banshee the moment I breathed outside air. Doctors were puzzled, generally hoping it was something that would go away when I got older. 

Instead it got worse. By sixth grade, I had to cut my school year short and switch to home-schooling, because I would literally faint if I went outdoors. By ninth grade, I was being written up in medical journals: no one had ever seen a case of agoraphobia so acute. 

Throughout this time, Grandpa, a psychiatrist of some international repute, would visit intermittently. He did what he could to help, treating me with a mixture of love and clinical interest. He always took my condition more seriously than the local doctors, and would prescribe protective measures that Dad and I initially found too onerous: shatter-proof windows, for example. He was the first to predict that my condition would eventually become life-threatening. He was right.  

My sole case of teenage rebellion, an attempted escape at age fifteen, resulted in immediate anaphylactic shock. Going outside was no longer just scary. It could kill me.

This was a time, mind you, when most people still used the internet for e-mail only. Social media was years away, and kids had yet to discover AIM. I was isolated and lonely. Sad as it was, Dad and Grandpa were my only friends. As such, it was entirely predictable, Grandpa said, that I would start to hallucinate people to fill the void. I would have conversations with my mother,  with Sophia Mackenzie from sixth grade, with Dawson of *Creek* fame. Grandpa called it an advanced form of imaginary friends.

All of which is to explain why seeing that strange man sitting on the chair was only about a five out of ten on the freakout scale, and why Dad and Grandpa weren’t overly alarmed when I explained to them why I’d yelped. I didn’t tell them what kind of person I’d hallucinated, because I’d never conjured someone so overtly threatening before. That part was weird. But the whole thing wasn’t entirely unprecedented.

Dad and I said our goodbyes. We were each trying to hold it together so the other wouldn’t cry, and we were more or less successful. This would be the longest we’d ever been apart.

“I’ll see you in two months, okay?” he said, kissing me on the forehead.

“Okay,” I replied, my voice cracking a little.

Grandpa walked Dad out, and I heard them talking in the foyer.

“Take good care of her, all right?” my Dad pleaded.

“You know I will.”

I heard the front door open and close, then Grandpa returned to the living room, taking a seat in the spot previously occupied by my imaginary predator.

“So,” he said, in his slightly broken English. “Now we are completed with the tender farewells.”

I smiled.

“The boy your daughter wants to marry, you are supposed to find all sorts of things wrong with him,” Grandpa continued. “But I could find nothing wrong with your father. That little bastard. That was only thing wrong with him, is that there was nothing wrong with him.”

I giggled. Grandpa had always had a knack for making me laugh, his humor evolving smartly from peek-a-boo to puns to the best pop culture references he could manage.

“And what about your mother, has she written you lately?”

The smile abruptly left my face. “No,” I said, sulkily. “Not lately.”

My mother had abandoned Dad and I when I was a baby. I wasn’t exactly sure what had happened, but it was enough that Dad didn’t want her to be part of my life at all. No visits, no phone calls. At some point, there had been a negotiation that permitted her to exchange letters with me. That’s right: snail mail. It was already an archaic practice by 1998, although not unheard of like it is now. There were few things that gave me as much joy in life as a letter from Mom.   

“Don't worry. I told her to write you here,” Grandpa assured me. “If she doesn't, she will get a spanking.”

And just like that, levity returned to my face.

After dinner – surprisingly delicious venison – Grandpa walked me up a set of winding stairs. 

“You know, it's really a shame you can't go outside,” Grandpa said, stating the obvious. “The scenery is spectacular. The forest, the lake. My partner chose this location very deliberately. He felt being close to nature could heal even the most troubled mind.”

I didn’t know much about the psychiatric institute Grandpa and his late partner, Dr. Anson Woodley, used to run out of this place. But Grandpa always described their patients as “troubled.” I knew the place had mostly sat empty since Grandpa retired, that the Ojibwe reserve had recently made a claim to the land, and that the whole creaky old building was set to be demolished in the fall.

“I haven't practiced psychotherapy in over ten years,” Grandpa continued. “Let's hope for your sake it's just like riding a bicycle. I’m thinking we can have our sessions in the mornings. In the afternoon I usually go into town or go hunting. In fact, I just set out a bunch of bear traps. I am trying to catch the papa bear!”

We reached the second-floor landing, and started to make our way down a long hallway. I involuntarily shivered, though it wasn’t cold. Nothing about this house inspired confidence. Seemingly every floorboard creaked and there was a near-constant whistle of wind finding its way through cracks.

“In the meanwhile, I don't know what you can do to amuse yourself. I don't have much. There's no telephone.”

“And no cell phone coverage,” I said, remembering how my Nokia had lost signal as we’d left civilization behind. 

“Nope. I have TV, but we only get a couple of channels.”

Grandpa sounded a little embarrassed, like he was letting me down, so I tried to make him feel better. “It’s okay, Grandpa, I have my AV equipment.”

“Oh, right. Well, everyone has a hobby, I suppose.”

“I also like jogging. Indoor jogging, obviously.”

“Oh, really? Want me to get you a treadmill?”

“No, I'll just go around the house. I like moving. If you don't mind.”

We finally reached the end of the hallway. Grandpa opened a door and led me into what was to be my bedroom. Despite my overall misgivings about the house, I had to admit this room was pretty cool. It was much more spacious than my room at home. There was an antique bed, dresser, and desk. A curtain covered a large, east-facing window, and there was a built-in closet. I felt a pang in my heart when I saw all my stuff – some of it quite heavy – that Dad must have brought up while I napped.

“Now, I wanted you to have your own bathroom, so you're kind of isolated in the house,” Grandpa said. “I'm way at the other end. Is that okay? You won't get scared?

“No,” I replied, naively. “That's one phobia I don't have."

Grandpa laughed. “Good one. Okay, good night. We'll talk tomorrow, okay?”

After he’d left me alone, and as I was unpacking my audio-visual equipment – a tape recorder, a video camera, various microphones – I noticed an odd sight in one of the room’s corners. 

There were several mousetraps set up close together, each baited with a piece of cheese. And there were at least a dozen mice crawling all over them. I’d never been queasy about vermin – honestly any kind of company was better than none – but I wondered why the mice weren’t setting off the traps. As I approached them, they scattered, emitting panicked squeaks.

I knelt down to inspect the traps, which had all been carefully baited with cheese. Completely untouched cheese. Why hadn’t the mice eaten any of it, and why hadn’t the traps gone off? Were the mechanisms not sensitive enough?

I noticed a feather duster leaning against the wall, and plucked a feather from it. I let the feather float down slowly, until it hit one of the traps--

SNAP! SNAP! SNAP! SNAP! SNAP!

They all went off in a chain reaction. Obviously they worked perfectly fine.

So what the hell was up with those mice?

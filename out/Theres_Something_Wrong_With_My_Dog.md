Ever since my dog, Bailey, had puppies. There was always one that was...peculiar.

They'd bark at nothing and whimper at an empty corner. I thought this pup had some sort of issue. But things have been getting worse.


To give you a bit of context. My dog. Bailey (6 female) had puppies that were in no way planned. She is a very active dog and we only noticed when she, quite literally,  had the puppies already. She is a very good sheep dog.
We kept 3 of her puppies. The other 2 were sold to great homes.


'Casper' was the name of the smallest. He was originally sold to a woman who couldn't keep him. She had never informed us she had another old dog and that dog took a chunk out of Capser. The dog bit him so badly, infact, that he had to be microchiped again.
Casper has a very light blue eye and a brown eye. His eyelashes are brown and white aswell. He is a strange dog.

The dogs we originally planned on keeping (with our own three other dogs) were Oddball, ChatCho and Clover.

We gave Casper to another woman after that. He stayed at that house for 3 months before they gave him back. Every weird excuse in the book. We eventually decided on keeping Casper.

Here's where things get strange, we'd come home to no dogs. We would spend hours calling them and nothing. Than they'd appear out of the blue where we had looked.

We thought they'd been getting out some way. Even the neighbors who worked from home and loved being nosey couldn't figure out where they'd go. They said one second they'd seen them. And the next they wouldn't. 

Another strange thing going on was that our cats went missing. Sylvester,  my old, sweet, cat went missing last week and hasn't returned. I do admit I was quite upset with that.

Casper had been bringing bones to the door. Like a sacrifice. A pile of dead flies sat on my window still.

Then it was out turtles. But they stay inside. How did they just disappear? I asked my family to no evail.

Casper has been acting strange too, though. He howls at night. I've never heard a dog howl like that before. 
I had a dog for 19 years and 10 months and he never howled like that. I fostered puppies and I've never heard that howl.

I wasn't too nervous until the missing posters and the blood curdling screams came at night. I think that's what scared me the most.

First it was pets, the it was children,  then adults. It was a mess. 

Last night I was at my breaking point. I sat out on the decking drinking a point when I saw a piece of paper.
It's windy around Ireland at this time so it twisted and fluttered around. I spent a few minutes trying to catch it before I had gotten it in my hands. Ugh. I hated when the neighbors littered in our property. 


I unfolded the sheet to uncover a missing poster. But, there was something wrong with it. The name was MY name. The clothes I was last seen in were the clothes I have on. The time I was last seen was five minutes ago. 

Was this a hoax? Was this some kind of sick joke? 

I called the dogs into the decking, incase they were injured aswell. You'd never know what those damn neighbors are up to these days.

But only Casper came running. 
With blood covering his mouth, the moonlight shined as I spotted his long sharp teeth. I finally accepted my faith.

I woke up in a sweat. Was this all a dream? I awoke in a strange place. Like my house. But ever so different. The walls weren't painted that colour. Where they? I wiped the sleep from my eyes and promptly trotted down the stairs. My heart sunk as I looked out the door.  I finally found my cat. And the turtles. And the missing people..

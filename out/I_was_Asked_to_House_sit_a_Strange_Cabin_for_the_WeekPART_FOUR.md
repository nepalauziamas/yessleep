“Let me in! Please, something is out there. It's coming!” I heard the voice of the old man screaming from the other side of the door. He was pounding and stomping, begging me for help. 

“You’re just- just another illusion. You aren’t real! None of it is real.” I choked out, half convinced that it was another hallucination. 

“God dammit, let me in, it’s going to kill us all. Open up the fucking door!” The old man responded with even more desperation than before.

“There's nothing out there! It isn’t real…just ignore it.” I reminded myself.

“Open up the door right now you miserable fucking worm.” His voice seemed to crack with every other word, distorting into a near guttural drawl. The pounding became less chaotic and eventually turned into a single knock, repeating on a loop for what seemed like forever. He just knocked over and over on the door, each time getting progressively getting louder and louder. 

“I don’t want to die out here! Please, just let me in already, God damn you!” The voice assumed a scared tone that seemed to be the polar opposite of how he had just sounded. The knocking subsided for a moment, then he spoke. What happened after that haunts me still to this day.

“Let…me…in.” He said with a powerful force in his tone. His voice echoed throughout the room, bouncing endlessly off of every wall. It began to sound like pure disembodied static with every reverberation.

“Agh! Stop…How are you- how are you doing that?” I struggled to speak against the overwhelming barrage of sound that seemed to deafen me more and more every second.

Then suddenly, all the sound in the room disappeared. I had never heard a silence quite like that before. There wasn’t a single peep in the house to be heard. Not a squeak of the floorboards, a rustling against the windows, not even the sound of my own words seemed to make it through the quiet emptiness. Well, except for one thing, the knocking. One after the other, knock after knock. It was all I could hear, almost as if nothing else existed beyond the sound behind the door. It started to become  hypnotic as I followed the unchanging tempo. 

Knock, silence, knock, silence. 

There was a perfect consistency. My mind began to become clouded, and I lost the ability to think straight. That door was the only thing that existed. I needed to open it and let the old man in. I started to walk forward. However, I realized what was happening and snapped out of the spell for just long enough to remember something. I just prayed that it would work. I decided to continue moving and slowly approached the door. Each step was torture as I neared what was surely an unknown being intent on killing me. 
Knock, silence, knock. 

I placed my hand up and extended my forearm. 

Knock, silence, knock. 

I lifted my wrist 

Knock, silence, knock.

I sent it back down upon the wood. The sound of me hitting the door transcended the deep quiet. 

Knock, silence, nothing. 

I waited for that alluring knock to return, but there wasn’t anything. For a while, everything appeared to be back to normal. I could hear the sound of the wind beginning to roar outside once again. Even the ambiguous creaking noises that always seemed to permeate within older homes made their presence known to me, but still yet, I had a feeling that I wasn’t in the clear. I didn’t dare venture out of that room, which seemed to be protecting me from the creature. If my only option for staying alive meant being held up in a cushy bedroom for the week, I was okay with that, but I wasn’t ready to accept my fate without at least trying to get some help first.

I pulled out my phone and attempted to contact the police but the signal was extremely weak. Eventually, I was able to get a call to go through but something was terrifyingly wrong. It was as if there were 30 different people who had picked up the call simultaneously. I heard them all at the same time, asking me the same question almost verbatim. The overlap of their voices sounded like a high school assembly, and I couldn’t focus on any single voice no matter how hard I tried. After several failed attempts to get even a single word out, I eventually just hung up the phone and decided that I would text one of my friends for help instead.

Me: I don’t know how to explain exactly what’s going on but I’m in trouble. Please call the police right now. I’m at the cabin I told you about. Get back to me ASAP!

For the first few minutes I didn’t receive a reply. I sat eagerly awaiting my friend's response, hoping that I would be able to get the hell out of there. However, when he finally texted me back, a wave of messages flooded my phone. There were almost 20 messages from different contacts, all with the same name and number as my friend. The barrage of notifications startled me so badly that I accidentally dropped my phone. The moment it made contact with the hard wooden floor the screen shattered. To make matters worse, the impact of the phone caused the backcase to fall off, forcing the battery to release, which sent it sliding all the way through the underside of the door and into the hallway.

“Well, fuck!” I exclaimed. Now I was stranded with no lifeline, and I had no way to know whether or not that thing was still lurking on the other side of the door, so running out didn’t seem like an option at the time. I sat there and weighed my options for a while, and eventually, I concluded that I would have to smash through the window if I wanted to escape. I didn’t really know the best way to go about that, as I didn’t wanna have to crawl across the broken glass that would surely be left over. However, there weren't many alternatives. 

I picked up a blunt object from off one the shelves and told myself that I was just gonna have to take my chances with the shattered pieces. I lifted it above my head and charged the window, slamming the object into it. The window cracked and tiny pieces of it shattered off the frame. I lifted the object and bashed it into the glass once more, causing it to completely shatter. The frame was outlined by spikes of leftover glass that I would have to pass. Using a mixture of quick thinking and common sense I figured that I could just use the object to scrape the shards off. After clearing the ledge of anything that could stab or slice me, I climbed through the window and dropped myself down below as quickly as possible. 

The moment my foot hit the grass, a deathly shriek echoed from within the house. It could only be compared to the sound of chalk scraping against a blackboard, except amplified one hundredfold, and backed by a resonance of which resembled the deep grumbles of a bellowing bear. Somehow it knew that I had escaped, and it was angry. Not looking to be caught by the monster that was stalking me, I made off with the blunt object in hand, ready to defend myself at any moment, though I assumed it wouldn’t do much if I got ambushed by whatever that damned creature was. I just tried to keep my mind focused on sustaining my footing so I wouldn't trip. There couldn’t be anything more embarrassing than dying like an idiot in a horror movie. 

I ran for about 20 seconds then stopped to look around and examine my surroundings. In doing this I realized that I had totally run in the wrong direction. I wasn’t thinking about it when I made my escape, but the bedroom window actually faced the backside of the cabin. If I kept going this way I would quickly find myself stranded and lost deep within the thick forest, which didn’t seem like a much better fate than what I’d get with the mimicking creature. 

The way I saw it, there were only two options. I could turn back and sneak my way to the car, or I could make a run for it and ditch the car altogether. Either way, I knew my chances of survival were slim at best, but continuing the way I was going now would be a guaranteed death sentence. I decided that the best strategy would be to bolt for the car and drive it to the nearest police station. However, I didn’t know where that was, and I also didn’t feel comfortable driving in that prison-on-wheels long enough for the creature to somehow manifest itself in my back seat. I’ve seen enough films to know that monsters have a way of appearing when you least expect it, and that would definitely be one encounter that I wouldn’t be able to sneak away from. Unfortunately, the car was my best shot at escape, so I would just have to suck it up and keep moving. 

I assumed a crouching position and began to sneak back. The creature didn’t seem to know where I was yet, which gave me the element of surprise. I made it to the backside of the cabin relatively unscathed, and began sneaking around to the front. I peered my head over the corner and saw nothing, yet I heard that scream once more. It was louder and angrier before, but I couldn’t tell where it was coming from. Well, not at first. As the sound faded away, the direction became more clear. It was on top of the cabin. 

I immediately stepped back and grasped the wall as tightly as possible. When I was sure that my body was completely obscured I began to slide myself slowly across the house. I inched closer and closer to the front with every small step. My heart was racing and my head was going a million miles a minute, but I had to get through it. The closer I got to the car, the faster my heart raced, and the more I began to panic. I feared that any moment the thing would appear and kill me in some horrific way. Then I heard the monster begin crawling across the roof, presumably scanning the area for me. It sounded like heavy boots were hitting concrete, and there was something animalistic about it as well, something…savage.

I made it to the last edge of the house, and I could see my car begin to appear from the approaching corner. I would have to make a run for it and break my cover if I wanted to reach it. I knew that the second I left the soffit I would be spotted by that thing, so I had to be as fast as possible. I dashed out of my spot and began to run. As I predicted, the creature spotted me instantly, and it prepared to pounce on me from the roof. That’s when I saw what it truly looked like.

It was a grey, ghoulish figure with a long, wide mouth that literally extended from ear to ear, or at least what appeared to be ears. They were really just long, pointed slabs of flesh. The monster’s eyes and mouth were nothing more than amorphous black shapes that held no static position, just a general area where they resided upon its scrawny face. The shape of its head was almost vampiric, and It had disturbingly long arms with even longer fingers that it used to run on all fours across the roof. 

Somehow I was able to make it to the door. I quickly gripped the latch and ripped it open, throwing myself head first into the front seat and closing the door behind me. As I finally rested within my spot, I looked out the windows and scanned all around me. There was nothing. This should have made me feel better but it just caused my heart to beat even faster. 

I reacted by checking the backseat for any intruders, but they were empty. Then I turned my head back around and tried to check the area one last time, but I was interrupted as the creature slammed onto the top of my car, causing the roof to nearly collapse onto my head. All the car windows exploded as It began violently rebounding onto the vehicle. The force of the being alone was enough to cause my car to shake back and forth in every direction. It was like my car was being rammed by a gathering of small trucks. 

“What the fuck do you want? Why are you doing this to me?” I cried out to the beast with exasperation in my voice. It let out a wicked laugh before responding.

“We know you hold the eyes! I must erase you. I must devour you.” The creature snarled with a voracious tone that sounded insatiable. 

“I’ll have your eyes, and then I think I’ll have your delicious flesh.” He followed up before I could even respond.

“I don’t know what the hell you’re talking about, God dammit! Just go away!” I screamed.

“You have no domain over the wild. You can’t just rid yourself of me now! You gave up that privilege when you abandoned your pathetic sanctuary!” It barked with confidence and then released an evil chuckle, while continuing to thrash my car around. 

I was able to hear every word of the creature with perfect clarity, despite its persistent pounding upon the roof of my vehicle. However, the pounding eventually stopped. I assumed that the creature gave up on its futile attempt to break through my car, and was just gonna climb through one of the available windows, but I was wrong. I sat there frozen in silence for a total of three seconds before noticing the light now pouring in from above me. I knew exactly what that meant, and I didn’t dare lift my head, but I wasn’t really given a choice. 

Before I could even put my hand to the door, I felt the creature's long fingers grasp the top of my head. They were sharper than I expected, and dug into the top of my flesh. With its large hand, the creature pulled my head up, forcing me to witness its head poking through the hole in the roof. It was staring down at me with dark smoke inexplicably fuming from its eyes, and black liquid drooling from its mouth and onto my face. 

I felt its hot breath clouding around my face as it stared me down, the warmth alone being enough to dry the sweat from my forehead. I couldn’t speak, I couldn’t even let out a yell. I was absolutely frozen in fear and shock. How? How could it break the roof of a car like that? That can’t be possible. It just can’t be fucking possible. 

“No, please. Keep writhing, keep shouting. When they scream it makes it better.” The creature was mocking me, as if it had done this same thing a hundred times before. I was meaningless to it.

“Your eyes really are so special. Most aren’t as clear as yours, sightseer. All the more reason to erase you!” It stated presumptuously.

“I-I don’t know what you-” 

“What you know or don’t know is inconsequential to me, sightseer. Those who usurp knowledge forbidden to them must pay a price.” 

The creature kept mentioning something about my eyes, and referring to me with that strange name. I had no clue what it meant and I didn’t really have the ability to care either. I just wanted to find a way to get the fuck out of there with my life and at least two functional limbs intact. The creature tightened its grasp on me further, digging its fingers even deeper into my flesh. Blood was now beginning to flow down the sides of my head, partially blinding me from the terror above. Then suddenly, the thing lifted me with unbelievable strength, pulling me out through the top of the car. My body was cut all over from the metal edges of the hole. 

It held me with one arm and lifted me just above its head, and started choking me. I tried to speak but everything just came out as gargled screams. My last ditch effort consisted of me using the blunt object I had somehow been able to hold onto throughout the ongoing struggle, and repeatedly bashing the monster across the head with it. It didn’t seem to be working at first, but the adrenaline flowing through my blood kept me adamant. I swung in the same space harder and harder, and eventually blood began to spurt from the left side of its face. Even as I began to black out from its hold, I was almost sure that I could save myself. Over and over, I smashed the object into that same area, and it began to concave. 

The beast let out a shriek that caused my ears to ring like sirens. I screamed in response, and my fear began to be replaced by an unrelenting anger. The monster replied by squeezing even tighter around my neck, nearly penetrating my throat. Now my body was weakening every second, adrenaline or not, the feeling in my arms started to dissipate and I began careening violently with every strike. I took my other hand and lifted it with every ounce of strength I could muster, and with the last bit of energy left to my disposal, I shoved my hand into its eye. I had no way of knowing if that would do anything, but I had to try. 

The monster recoiled in absolute pain from my attack and dropped me. I fell flat on my shoulder, and a jagged piece of metal impaled my shoulder. I cried in agony as I tried to lift myself from the spike but it wouldn’t budge. While I was struggling to escape, the monster had stumbled back and tumbled off from the roof of the car, falling head first onto the pavement.

It began muttering out phrases in a language I couldn’t understand and twitching erratically, though the pain might’ve just been so intense that I couldn’t comprehend whatever it was saying. Regardless, the being seemed to be moaning and whaling, which meant that it could be hurt, and if it could be hurt, it could be killed. However, I knew that being able to kill something, and having the ability to kill something were two completely different things. I still wasn’t able to pull my shoulder off from the spike. If the creature didn’t finish me off now, my injuries would. 

“Y-You…cowardly fool. Treacherous, insipid creature!” The being insulted me with malice in its voice. I knew that the moment the creature regained its footing, I was dead. 

There I lay there, with a spike protruding from my shoulder, and blood pouring from nearly every orifice of my body. It was clear that I was gonna die, but I just couldn’t let go. I just couldn’t stop clinging onto life. My vision began to blur and my head grew lighter and lighter, then from out of nowhere, a distorted voice called out to me from my mind.

“Kid, you’re on the horizon of a crossover event. We’re coming to rescue you now! Stay where you are and cover your eyes.” The mysterious voice channeled through my mind like a phone call. However, before I could process what it had even said, a blast of pure light struck down from the sky, producing a shockwave so strong and bright that I had to shield my eyes. When the eruption ceased, an orb of light concentrated around the blast zone, and from it came three strange men…

To be continued…

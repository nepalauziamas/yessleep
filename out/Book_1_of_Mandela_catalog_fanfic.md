the alternates, alternates are an anomalous alien like species that arrived in earth and mimic humans, they are like your fake clones, stages of alterna the alternates started dying, according to the TTT the alternates can’t die, they can shift dimensions or they can be stuck in a dimension they can’t leave, but they can die. There has been a large amount of reports of humans disappearing or being killed, they are all marked as alternate deaths. The alternates are also invading the human world in large quantities it’s up to the government, the military, and the TTT to deal with them. Beyond the Alternates this world has many other kinks and wrenches thrown into the works, through almost all of these the main character only has one power, and that power is the power to travel through dimensions. And he’s not even really a main character, he’s not the main character of the main series, he’s not the main character of the sequel series, he’s not the main character of the spin-off series. As of right nowtes, stage 0, the Alternates are indistinguishable from the original human, stage 1 alternates start looking and sounding slightly different and retain different memories, stage 2 alternates start having non human characteristics like pointy ears or lack of facial features also includes elongation of heads and other body parts, stage 3 alternates at these stages are very aggressive and the characteristics described in stage 2 are more apparent the stages go from 0-7 and their are thought to be more anyways stage 4, all human characteristics are lost and alternates begin showing their original form before transformation, Between 2008 and 2009 three dimensional alternates appeared, they are usually more powerful then the original, they are more aggressive, they can shift dimensions, they can die, and they can control matter in ways that would normally be impossible. At stage 5, alternates have complete control over their body and are basically immortals

Harry Crow is not a stage 5 alternate, he’s a stage 0 alternate, he has average human features, he can’t die, he can’t shift. He’s basically a regular human being.

In the backround arguing is audible “ he was gone” in the radio astronomers agree that the event is the first interruption of their radio signals, no one knows why this event happened.

Harry runs home he’s late for a meeting, he enters a shop filled with emergency supplies, there are strands of black latice lining the wall, Harry approaches the bar and pays a man for a drink, “You’re late,” said a tall man in a long coat, he had his face covered by a hood, “Sorry, I-” “It doesn’t matter, we’re almost there,” said the man, “there’s been an incident,” Harry’s face turned serious “tell me,” the man with the hood leaned in close and said,” the TTT, they’re on the move…”

To be continued…Jamie we need to say all the stages so the people know what to expect these aliens are scary and I think they are coming now” a person possessed by the TTT invaded the studio, with a demented smile on their face, they were about to throw a grenade at one of the workers. Harry’s eyes widened and he screamed “NO!” and everything seemed to move in slow motion. He was running faster then he had ever run, he grabbed the worker and ran away. Harry landed a few feet away and turned around. The worker’s face revealed thankfulness and shock. The building exploded, scorching a few pieces of the bank building. Harry fell to the ground and thought, what the hell did I just do?

“So it has begun,” the man with the hood said, “they’ve started taking over the world”

“But how?” Harry asked

The man with the hood said, “I don’t know. This world is full of mysteries.”

“

The hooded man is revealed to be Harry’s alternate who decided to leave the TTT and join the humans.

Harry’s eyes widened, a sudden fear crept over him, and he looked up to the sky. many, many stars were out. He counted them all and counted again. Something wasn’t right. “Wait,” he said to himself, “there should be a million stars,” but there were just thousands. He felt a pang of fear in his stomach. He finally knew what was going on. The alternates were coming.

Like I said before, the alternates are on the move.

The reason the stars were out was because the alternates, who are like fake clones of the humans, needed starlight to power themselves.

But they aren’t the only ones who are out and about, another alien race is revealed called the “Bivost”.

The Bivost was somehow able to convert humans into zombies in their sleep and help the alternates, they can’t just do that to my family what the hell said Harry the Bivost just sent a message to the humans

In the message, it said that the humans had a “tiny” amount of time to surrender or there will be consequences.

Harry, after seeing this message, decided to take a stand against the aliens themselves. He said to himself, “I have to warn everyone…”

Harry started getting up, but before he could get up, he heard a loud screech of a car alarm, shrill, high pitched, like a never ending sound. He looked around. Car alarms started going off, “What the hell?” he thought. His car alarm went off, and it was even louder. He heard a screech, and looked at his neighbors car, it was glowing red from the inside out. Harry ran home, and saw a giant ball of red fire coming straight at him. He thought, this is it, this is how I’ll die, I am sorry family Harry thought but wait then Harry’s alternate came and rescued him to a bunker at an undisclosed location, they where safe for now

“The Alternates have gained control,” the man said to Harry

Harry couldn’t believe his ears, what did he mean “control”?

“You mean they’ve gained power over their hosts?” Harry asked

“No,” the man said, “they’ve gained control over themselves.”

and with that Harry saw a true invasion of the alternates and the Bivost, he saw them all walking on the streets, and taking over the city, and the military, and the protestors, and the city lights, and the police, and even the local government, and the president, and the president’s cabinet.

The world would be doomed.

Everyone was scared, Harry’s alternate stared at him. He made some sort of gesture and Harry understood, Harry followed him down to the bunker where he was going to strap

The man reveals the rest of the stages their are in fact more that 0-7 their are 0-10 and the hooded man was stage 9 yet he was not aggressive? So many questions swirling in Harry’s mind where left unanswered at this moment.

There was a noise, it sounded like a firework, but the noise rumbled and continued going off. A man standing in the room with Harry, opposite the hooded man, exploded.

This was the beginning of a war.

The Alternates and the Bivost were persecuting everyone. The Bivost held the humans hostage with the Alternates, and the Alternates were in control of the Bivost because they were in control of the humans.

The Alternates are far superior to humans, and the Bivost aren’t to shabby themselves.

The Alternates, working together with the Bivost, had control of the entire world.

All the while, while they moved forward, Harry was driving his car down the highway, listening to a podcast he had been listening to for the past week.

He was listening to a man talking about how the world was the center of a giant alien WAIT said Harry trying not to attract more alternates, remember how the news said they can die? That means we still have a chance to save our planet from these sick bastards, all the car alarms went off.

Harry swerved his car and saw a dozen cars, all with their alarms going off. The Alternates came and pressed a button on the cars and they all exploded. Harry swerved and swerved again, avoiding the explosions, but his car was destroyed in the fighting. Harry tried forcing an alternate out of his car, but he was too strong. Harry was stuck. Harry noticed he was surrounded by Alternates, and a Bivost. There was no way to escape. He was going to die. And then, all of a sudden, a black car crashed into the Alternates. Harry was knocked unconscious.

When Harry woke up, he found himself in this bunker. He wasn’t sure how he got there or who brought him there. He was just so happy to be alive.

The hooded man and the alternate who drove to the bunker were the ones who brought him here. For the next few weeks the army came to the bunker and said they managed to kill the alternate who invaded Harry’s car

“They’re coming for us” said a man who was in the bunker

“What?” Harry asked

“Soon they’ll be knocking on our door” the man said.

“How do you know this?” Harry asked

“There was a vision,” the man said, “a vision of our deaths”

“Why would they want us?” Harry asked

“Because we’re the only ones who know what’s going on, “ the man said, “and they want to keep it a secret”

“So what do we do?” Harry asked

“There’s nothing we can do” the man said

“We can’t just sit here and wait for them to come!” said Harry

“

Harry reveals that he knows a good species of aliens called myroses they could help in the battle of alternates and Harry claims all we must do is tame them and earth is saved! Harry spins around in his rolling chair and is delighted by his own idea The Alternates started attacking the bunker. The Alternates focused on one side of the bunker, and blew it up. Harry and the other humans in the bunker ran to the other side.

“We should leave,” Harry said

“Where will we go?” asked the hooded man

“We’ll go to the base,” said Harry

“Where is the base?” asked one of the humans

“I’m not sure,” said Harry

“We can’t go to the base,” said the hooded man

“Why not?” asked Harry

“Because it’s here,” said the hooded man

“What?” asked Harry

The hooded man took off his hood and revealed himself to be a Myros. Harry recognized his species, Harry then said WAIT A MINUTE I THOUGHT YOU WHERE AN ALTERNATE, the hooded man says I lied... and I am sorry the hooded man was shot by a bullet.... the body of the hooded man started to melt and crawled back together, then formed into a blackish red blob that was once the hooded man.

A man started to scream and was shot by a gun when the blob died the blackish redness was flushed out of the man and the man turned back to normal.

Harry was so focused on the blob that it wasn’t until someone yelled that he looked up and saw a man with a gun with a silencer on it, and then he realized that he was on a spaceship. He was in space.

He was in a space ship.

Harry didn’t know what to do. “Kill them!” ordered the Myros. Then the Myros pulled out a gun and started shooting.

One of the humans quickly grabbed a gun and started shooting.

Harry grabbed a gun and started shooting.The hooded man said he was named Jack and Harry orders Jack to call the other Myroses to save them the Alternates outside the bunker started to stop attacking. The bunker fell silent.

“What’s going on?” asked Harry

“They’re retreating,” said Jack

“Why?” asked Harry

“They’ve seen what I’m planning,” said Jack

“What are you planning?” asked Harry

“I’m going to launch a nuclear missile at the moon,” said Jack

“Why?” asked Harry

“It’s the only way to destroy the Alternates,” said Jack

“But it will kill everyone!” Harry said

“They’re too busy controlling the people and the society,” said Jack, “they won’t be able to fight against it.”

Jack says he knows an earth like planet, Harry disagrees WHAT ABOUT... all we learned on our solar system is going to waste and NASA will be nothing but just a few nothing meaning stray letters in this alphabet but Jack says, what about all the new places our countries could colonize, alternates need food to and they will die out if we evacuate to this planet, Jack reveals the planet to be Elysium there was a loud, ugly noise. They were being watched.

They were being watched by an Alternates. He was the same one who had attacked Harry on his car.

The Alternates, who had been watching them since they entered the bunker, didn’t like it that the humans were planning to destroy the moon.

The Alternates threatened them, and Jack, Harry and the other humans didn’t know what to do.

Jack then pulled out a gun, and shot the Alternates.

Then the Alternates attached themselves to Jack’s body.

The Alternates, having latched themselves onto Jack’s body, were so powerful that Jack wasn’t able to fight against them.

Eventually Jack would be assimilated.

“Quick,” said Harry, “there’s a space ship. Let’s go!” Then Harry and the humans exit to Elysium... to be continued

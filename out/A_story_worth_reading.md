"I know there are people who will not believe me when I say that I see and feel things. No it's not a hallucination or anything, I really did experience things." I said to my friend who is sitting just right beside me, in the empty classroom wanting me to share my experience.

***Alright...Let me tell you about my experience.***

For example, at one point, I was doing my work, only to feel a burning sensation from the left of my shoulder horizontally across to my right shoulder. It burns so bad, I couldn't explain it, neither can I touch it because it hurts. Then after that subsided, the second round of burning started to occur, this time around, it was on my arm. Now that I could actually see it, I can clearly describe to you what it was, my friend. 

*Three distinct red lines on my pale skin,* it stings, but not as much as on my back. It makes you wonder, what I just felt on my back, could it be some sort of larger scratch marks? 

You know, things like this have been a common occurrence. I hear voices that were so clear, that I thought it was coming from the videos that I am watching, but what's odd about it, was the videos that I was watching, are nothing but shots of churros being fried. Those words, I remember them to this day. "Why did you do this to me?" ***He*** said. It also doesn't help with the fact that, before the voices, I was in the bathroom, you know, doing my thing, only to see a figure's face, covered with dirt wrapped in linen, which made it look like a bunny, standing at my right shoulder. 

"This classroom...is the place that made me experience these kinds of things," I added on with a big sigh, only to see the shock on my dear friend's face. Without me saying much of a goodbye, my dear friend left pretty much immediately. What I didn't get to add, was that I too have also seen human silhouette reflections as they walk past those computers. All of it is in broad daylight, these experiences have proven to me, that things do appear in daylight and not just nightlight. It's probably my fault too...I was watching Ghost Adventures in class before my scratches occurred...Is it really so, that those things could travel through the screen?

This is just a part of it all, I have yet to tell her about my in-home experience yet. Damn...maybe next time for her. Often, whenever this topic of 'experience' arrives, I would think about my other past experiences. One of them always tends to come up, that experience, that happened in my own home. 

***Let's see...***

It's just a usual night, me sleeping in my own room, the way that my room was designed, was as such that my window is placed on the front-right of my bed. So late at night, I would open my eyes, to the silhouette of the window railings and I could see soft nightlight, coming into the room. Nothing out of the ordinary, until I started to blink rapidly, and STOP. I stopped blinking because I see...***him***...I see an obvious silhouette of a man holding a staff-like rod, standing at the window. Those window railings were covered by the silhouette, so I knew, it was real. Though I don't see his eyes, I knew, he was standing there looking at me. I blinked once more, and it disappears. 

....Unexplainable...I still think about it to this day...

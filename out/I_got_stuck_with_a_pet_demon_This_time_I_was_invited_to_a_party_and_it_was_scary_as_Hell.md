Yeah, you read that right. If it wasn’t for your downpour of love and appreciation towards Fluffy, then Satan wouldn’t have sent me the e-mail he did. 

Before that, let me thank each and every one of you for your support in [the previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/k98gc0/i_got_stuck_with_a_pet_demon_do_you_know_how/). I think you were right about Fluffy, he did try to protect me from that shithead Gary and he did a hell of a good job if you ask me. So thank you for your lovely comments!

And sorry I was gone for so long. I was down there you know, so I needed a lot of rest after that.

I do want to wish you all Happy Holidays!

Anyway, let’s get down to it.

From: [Satan666@xxxxx.hell](mailto:Satan666@xxxxx.hell) (gotta hide the guy’s e-mail address, sorry.)

*Heya Johnny!* 

*Holy shit, dude! I read your post on that Reddit thing and I saw that everyone loved Fluffy. Some people even wanted to hear more about him. How cool is that?* 

*I’ll give them just what they want!* 

*Awesome stuff! Actually one of my kids posts on the Internet too. He calls them ‘memes’? I don’t what they are but they all laugh at them. Might do one of these accounts to tell my stories. I sure have a lot of them. Or I’ll just hire you to do it. I can give you… say $6.66/100 words for starters? Hehehe…*

*Boy, do I have to tell you the one when I got pissed drunk with a bunch of rockstars! Oh, man, they almost had me not gonna lie. I think they had three or four livers each, cuz they were drinking like there was no tomorrow. Of course, I was possessing one of them so they technically didn’t know who I really was.*

*\[ALL ABOARD! HAHAHAHA!\]*

*Maybe some other time. We have more pressing matters, Johnny lad!*

*Fluffy seems to miss you too so I was thinking that, since Christmas is coming, I should invite you to our Annual Hellmas Party.* 

*Yeah, yeah, I know. But I love giving and receiving presents so there’s that.* 

*You get to spend some time with Fluffy, you’ll definitely want to get a tattoo at my shop, I have some of the best artists in the world. I mean, ‘worlds’. There are many worlds, you know? You live on Earth, I have Hell, then He has Heaven (yuck), there’s another place called Frozen Limbo, and many more. You’ll get to know some of them during your lifetime if you hadn’t already.* 

*Well, except Earth, duh. You already know that one.*

*So, I figured you might want to come here and if all goes well, you’ll get a once in a lifetime special present at the end of your challenge. I mean, your stay. ;)*

*I won’t be seeing you until the very end. Boy, let me tell ya, it’s gonna be hard. But hey, not many people get to write about actually going to hell, party with Satan, and then live to tell the tale, amirite?* 

*So, there’s a secret passage that I kinda opened especially for you so that you can come here. There’s gonna be a car picking you up and drive you there. Don’t ask questions to the driver, he doesn’t like to talk. Anyways you like Hellrraries? Hehe, instead of the little horse, I modified it with my face on it and added a neat horny spoiler.* 

*HORNY! Get it? HAHAHA! :))*

*Oh, boy. Sorry, man. But my own jokes crack me up every time! I got another one.*

*What goes in through one ear, exits through the other but stays in your head? A PICKAXE.*

*I’m gasping for air right now. That was a good one, right?! Anywho, do you have a leather jacket and some chains for your pants? If not, go and buy some.* 

*I know I told you that you’re not fit yet to get here but I was meaning not fit for living here. Like for eternity, you know? You can come for a short visit.*

*P.S. Can you buy some more meat from the place you bought it last time? Fluffy loved it. You can leave it in the car. The driver will bring it.*

*P.S.S. There’s gonna be someone waiting for you there, Jonathan. You won’t have to travel alone. Oh… and I don’t like that black metal shit too! I’m more of a heavy metal guy myself, you’ll see it when you get here.*

*It’s gonna be hella fun! I’ll be waiting for you, Jonathan.*

*Yours truly,*

*Sa†an*

My hands started shaking as I was about to face yet another supernatural event. The first one was terrifying alright but this one? I thought this one would a million times scarier.

So, if I got it straight… I was supposed to cruise my way to hell through the unknown depths of the earth and if I was lucky enough to stay alive I would party with Satan?

I was pissed and scared as hell but deep down I knew that I had to go and I didn’t want to know the repercussions of my failure to arrive in Hell.

Phew. That was a lot to take in. I didn't really know why he picked me for whatever it was he was doing but that was the situation. I had to comply or else I would have died. Surely died. I knew I had to go, no matter what. I didn’t want to piss the big guy downstairs. After all, he paid my mortgage. He kept his word.

Don’t get me wrong. I didn’t think he was my friend. We all know Satan always liked to play games.

Maybe I was being subjected to a very bad cosmic joke. Hell if I knew.

After I bought the meats, I went back home and that’s when I saw Satan’s pimped ride. Damn, it was awesome. The car was painted a bright red, it had tinted windows, the actual spoiler had horns on its extremities and the hood was customized to show Satan’s head, smiling and winking.

I gotta admit, it was the coolest car I’d ever seen.

The meats could’ve gotten spoiled on the way, I thought. I had a small icebox in the house, so I put them inside and then in the trunk. 

Thing was that I had a leather jacket and chains because I was in a band at the time. Probably the best band you’d never heard of… good times. 

Oh, right before leaving I remembered that Satan said he likes receiving gifts so I got him a t-shirt with my band, Dreams of Black. Don’t google it, you won’t find anything.

I got dressed and went to the car.

“Name’s Big T, pleased to meet ya. Buckle up, I love speeding. And shut the hell up,” the large bald man said. He looked like a bodybuilder who ate three other bodybuilders.

Definitely not a guy you’d want to piss off, so I decided to keep my mouth shut. 

We got to the local cave attraction called The Mouth of Inferno. It was called like that because it looked like a monster’s mouth filled with crooked rock teeth, and we used to make fun that it was the entrance to Hell. It was a place for teenagers to hang out, drink beer, smoke cigarettes, and listen to heavy metal. 

Guess the joke was on me, right?!

Before driving off, Big T told me to be careful on my way there, there’s a lot of horrors lurking in the darkness and on the path to the center of the earth, where Hell was. My eyes widened and my heart rose in my throat as if it wanted to jump through my mouth and run to a place I could never find it again.

I entered the cave and I saw that it was not the same as the last time I went there. I knew with certainty that in front of me should have been a wall but instead, I found a black door with a red knob. 

I opened it and in front of me stood a descending spiraling staircase with lit torches on the walls. I heard a distant howl and I figured I should take a leak before starting my journey. I didn’t want fear to overcome come and…

Remember what happened with Gary, right? Top a small bladder with being scared shitless and you have the perfect recipe for pissing your pants.

The stairs seemed neverending but still, I kept going even if my bones were shaking with uncontrollable fear, one that I hadn’t ever felt in my life. The air was damp and the bats hanging from the ceiling seemed to watch my every move, studying every little thing about me. I accidentally dropped the torch from my hands (I figured I shouldn’t use my phone’s flashlight) and that’s when I saw the bats swarming and flying over me, making those specific high-pitched sounds that sure added to the ominous surroundings. 

After finally finishing descending the stairs, I suddenly felt a sense of dread taking over me as I was facing a dark, long, and wide corridor. Shadows were dancing on the walls, and as sweat started trickling down my temples I heard something charging towards me, howling, barking, enraged to get me.

I closed my eyes and was prepared to embrace the end. My pitiful life was coming to its final stages.  From the darkness, a creature threw a bone that landed at my feet. Still not sure what it was, still trembling with fear, I threw the bone back and didn’t know what to expect.

Then I heard a loud growl and the creature started growling in the darkness as it started stampeding towards me.

Soon I was knocked over by who other than Fluffy, who started licking my face, he was barking excitedly while saliva dripped from his mouth and onto my face. Wagging his orange-lit tail, he turned around on his back and I gave him a belly rub.

“Hey there, Fluffy! Nice to see you again. But, oh boy, you scared me really bad…” I told the purple pet demon.

I felt safer because he was with me but of course I was still scared of him. I mean, what if he lost his shit? I remembered I even packed some milk so I asked him if he wanted some. He barked once and I saw the spikes coming out from his back and the flame surrounding his tail.

I still was at a crossroads because I didn’t know what I had to do to get to Hell. What was it like? Was it a place full of lava where the restless screams and dying dreams of the sinners who got there echoed in the halls of eternity? Was it a wasteland where every sinner had to suffer the same things they got there for? 

I trembled upon thinking that. I knew I had to be careful and to get there in one piece. 

Thus my journey started. Through that dark corridor, I felt eyes watching me as the skin on my neck was raising. Fluffy was ever vigilant and I had no doubt that he was trying to protect me. Still, I was afraid of him like I said before. 

Here’s a [drawing](https://www.reddit.com/r/PostMortem33/comments/kftjlc/heres_fluffy_maybe_this_will_quench_your_thirst/) of him as some of you wanted to know how he looked like. 

The torches on the walls flickered on and I heard a large shriek coming from behind me. Fluffy jumped on me, putting me to the ground, and then instantly jumped back in the air ripping the creature’s throat open. 

Heart pounding in my chest like the final gong of my life was beaten repeatedly, I laid eyes upon the horrible beast. It seemed like a hybrid between a giant and a mutated pterodactyl. Fluffy tore its wings apart and ripped its legs from its body, leaving it in a pool of black gooey liquid which was probably its blood. He then tried to make me stand up faster, probably saying that it was just the beginning of those types of things.

I dusted my jeans and jacket off and this time I noticed I didn’t piss myself with fear and so I went on with Fluffy by my side. He seemed ever so focused, trying to act as my protector for this journey. 

I was in another section of the darkened corridor where the walls were decorated with marble and stone statues which… were alive. Their eyes were glowing a bright red and I ran for cover thinking I was to be attacked yet again.

I don’t know how to explain it better but they seemed to be made of live flesh. Squishing sounds came from their constant neck movements that were twisting and turning while their eyes were watching me.

The corridor suddenly was engulfed in a thick mist and soon after I saw the silhouette small man in the distance.

As he approached I realized he was not a man but a red imp who had a black three-eyed goat by his side. 

Curiously enough, the goat started speaking and not him. Or he was speaking through the goat, I didn’t know nor did I care. He told me he can grant me three wishes, whatever I wanted I could have. Whatever my heart ever desired, it could all be mine. Money, properties, beautiful women, you know the whole deal. I just had to do two things; answer one of his riddles and give him a portion of my soul.

If I’d refused, then I just had to put some coins in his metal cup. He said that meant he could get to feed the goat and I, for helping him, was blessed with good luck for my journey. 

I’ve heard things like this. I know what happened to the people who made deals with devils like that. They died early after they rose to fame, they lived lavish lives, and so on.

It wasn’t the time for me yet. I was not stupid or greedy, so I refused. I had other stuff to take care of.

I saw the hatred in the imp’s eyes and, while the three-eyed goat let out a shriek, I thought they’d both rip me to shreds. Fluffy let a growl to make them understand I was not to be touched, I thought. Still, I think Fluffy enjoyed seeing me scared. Maybe he was feeding on that too. Like his dark spiritual food.

The face of that imp will be forever tattooed on my mind and his hateful eyes when I refused him will haunt my dreams for nights to come.

I tossed some change in his mug and kept on walking, sweat coming down my temples as my heart drummed inside my chest and if it had a voice, it would’ve said “Why do you always put me through this?”. The answer to that would’ve been that it was not a choice, it simply had to happen for me to keep on living.

The corridor ended and a red door with a black knob. appeared in front of me I slowly opened it and I saw a long street passing through a very hot desert.

I walked for a few minutes and I saw buildings lying in ruins on each side of the street. Soon after a sign pointing forward said “Hell ahead, distance 6,66 miles”.

I began asking myself if from the dunes giant worms would emerge to eat me whole and to end my existence there and then. Shivers went down my spine upon that thought. I kept on walking, stopping from time to time to drink water and give Fluffy some milk too.

I finally arrived in Hell. To be honest I kinda expected it to look different.

It was just a big stadium with a large lit neon sign saying “HELL ARENA”.

I entered it and I saw tens of thousands of creatures dancing and partying. Devils, goth-emo vampires, werewolves wearing leather jackets with metal bands patches sewn on them, you name it. There were even humans there, those high-profile rich ass executives.

They had a fair going on with games and mulled wine. Christmas carols were blasting through the speakers. There was a lady who saw me, she gifted me a pair of socks with Satan’s head printed all over and in the center, the question “Have you hailed Satan today?” was printed.

Scary and cringy at the same time.

Someone accidentally bumped into me. A devil with long black horns and flaming eyes looked at me, “Hey, watch it asshole. We barely started the party and you’re pissed drunk already or what?” he said, sipping on a can of beer.

Of course, I instantly froze with fear but kept on walking. To where I didn’t know.

I felt fingers tapping my shoulder and I turned around to see a… let’s say, man. A man with pale red skin, full sleeves tattoed on both of his arms that were glowing a bright golden hue, and two small smoking horns. He smiled and I saw that his lateral incisors were sharp, resembling those of a predator. 

His pupils dilated and he smiled at me.

“You made it Johnny boy! Hell yeah! Get it? HELL YEAH?! HEHEHE”, the Red Guy said.

“Yeah, I guess I did. I was almost killed by a giant mutated pterodactyl bat by the way. Luckily this bad boy here saved me in time,” I said while petting Fluffy on the head. He wagged his tail and started barking.

“He’s a fuckin’ legend, ain’t he?” Satan asked. “Listen, we have a bit of a problem, my man. In two hours my band’s playing and that stupid lead guitar player of mine got high this morning and he thinks he’s on an island sipping Marguerita's with 1,000 hot devil women. He can’t play for shit. You’re up for it, aren’t ya?”

“I…. I don’t know. I think so,” I said, an uncontrollable fear coursing through my body.

He told me I’ll do just fine. He handed me the concert setlist (I’ll post in the comments, do check it out please) and the dude had amazing music taste for sure. He liked heavy music. Real heavy music. 

I asked him if this was Hell I was in to which he shook his head, telling me that this is just the festive part of it. If he showed me how Hell really looked like, I would’ve lost my mind. 

He then took me to the bar. We started doing tequila shots. I felt hands caressing my face. I turned around and I saw two devil women giggling and motioning me to go upstairs with them but sex was the last thing on my mind then. 

Especially with devil women. Seriously.

Satan started laughing and told me to calm down a bit, to stop being scared. 

“Alright, Johnny. Enough with the drinking. Let’s get you a tattoo done at my shop really quick. It’ll heal on the spot but it will hurt like Hell. HURT LIKE HELL, get it? Hahaha!” he told while I forced a smile. 

I was in a constant mood of shitting my pants. I mean I pissed them before…. Shat them I had never, so it would’ve been a first.

I went to “The Flaming Horns Gallery” where I saw a man with scales on his face and his tongue split in two. 

“Heya, Tommy! Can you hook my man up with a cool sleeve, make it really metal, you know? Put in on my tab, it’s my gift to him.” Satan asked the tattoo artist.

“Say no more, fam, I gotchu,” he replied.

Yikes, his way of talking was a bit cliche, don’t you think?

Tommy took out a scalpel from the drawer and started carving my skin. The pain was unbearable and my screams probably were heard even back on Earth. I felt like I was about to lose consciousness. Satan was laughing so hard and Fluffy was just wagging his tail, barking and playing with a tennis ball.

Tommy told me it was almost over and then he spread a golden paint all over it and the pain stopped.

Five minutes after that, I had a full sleeve with flames, skulls, guitars, microphones, and all sorts of metal music references. The pain stopped and the red ink which was my blood has dried off. 

It started glowing golden exactly like Satan’s. 

“Ain’t you gonna say thanks, Johnny lad?” he said, smirking.

I thanked him for the “gift” and then he said that the show was about to start so we had to meet with the other band members.

While nearing the stage, I heard a voice on the speakers.

“Show will start in fifteen minutes. The legendary band playing today is none other than The Hellfire Bastards, ladies and gents. You don’t want to miss this one. The show is sold-out and the attendance is 66,666. Have fun, everyone!”

So I was playing with Hellfire Bastards. Cool band name.

We got backstage and Satan introduced me to the other members. Satan was on vocals, a guy with a flaming skull was on rhythm guitar, a gorgeous devil woman was playing bass, while an old guy with long grey hair and four arms was supposed to blast the drums. Each of us had nicknames attached.

Hellfire Bastards were:

VOCALS: Satan “Fallen Angel” Fuckinson

LEAD GUITAR: Johnny “The Hero” Crimson (that’s me)

RHYTHM GUITAR: BILLY “FLAMES” DAVIS

BASS: LILITH “DIVA SATANICA” FUENTES

DRUMS: ROCKY “MADBLASTER” SMITH

We took the stage after the intro ended. Started blasting the songs, my guitar was practically playing by itself, lighting coming out of it filling me with unimaginable power. Satan was a powerhouse on vocals, sounding almost identical to the original singers. Madblaster was killing those blast beats, while Diva Satanica had a mesmerizing stage presence. Flames was headbanging like crazy during every song.

The cheering of the crowd, the roar, the applause fueled my body and mind. Mosh pits were happening almost on every song and plastic glasses of beer were flying off randomly in the crowd.

Humans, devils, werewolves, vampires, and other hellish creatures were partying like crazy, getting drunk, and having fun altogether.

Talking about harmony, right?!

At one point I saw Gary’s head used as a stage prop. He was mumbling “Black Metal is shit” while Satan poured gasoline on it and set it on fire.

How ironic. 

End of the concert. Fireworks started and Satan took on the mic, “THANK YOU SO MUCH, YOU HAVE BEEN FANTASTIC! GIVE IF IT FOR THE WHOLE BAND, ESPECIALLY FOR OUR GUEST TODAY JOHNNY “THE HERO” CRIMSON!” he said while the crowd was ecstatic.

That was an absolute banger I have to tell you that. 

Yes, it was absolutely terrifying seeing all those creatures and being in that arena, even playing that show. But I felt an intense energy while playing live and that was what kept going. If you’ve ever played in a band, you know the feeling.

After the concert, we had some burgers and steaks and drank beer. 

Satan told me the arena would close and everyone would go back to their regular lives. He told me that there were actually some rich guys from Earth who attend the show every year. Some of them didn’t have many years left on the contract with him and they’ll join him in Hell soon permanently.

They were probably the ones I saw earlier when I got there.

“Johnny boy, it was a blast. You need to loosen up, these things will toughen you up. Stop being so scared all the time, Jesus Christ… I mean… Nevermind,” he said, sighing.

He then told me that I need to take Fluffy with me, he liked it the first time. Satan told me that we should do something fun, maybe go to an amusement park he had on Earth.

Before leaving, I handed him his present, my band’s t-shirt to which he thanked me and said that he has faith in us to be big someday!

He then showed me another entrance in hell, I took the stairs and got back to the cave in approximately two minutes. Yeah, thanks Satan.

Big T was waiting for me there, I got Fluffy in the car and I went back home.

I had to think about how I could take Fluffy to the amusement park… 

This adventure seemed to never end. Scared was too light of a word to use on how I was feeling

Anyway, I’ll tell the story next time, this is getting long already.

I poured myself a glass of Satan whisky and relaxed. 

[It was the best-damned whisky I ever had.](https://www.reddit.com/r/PostMortem33/comments/gpnh5h/story_masterpost/)

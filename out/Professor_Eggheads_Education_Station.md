I have a tendency of stumbling into places where I don’t belong. I can’t help it. I’m just a curious fella. When I was in my teens my curiosity manifested itself through trips to abandoned factories and shortcuts through finely manicured lawns. After a broken leg and a couple of trips in a squad car my curiosity was tempered, but I would still get my kicks by squeezing myself into social events I wasn’t invited to. I thought that sneaking into wrap parties and the occasional housewarming would be a significantly safer alternative than urban exploration.

I thought wrong.

It was a bit after ten and there was a light drizzle in the air. Originally I was meant to be grabbing a couple of drinks with a friend I haven’t seen for a long time but through stifled yawns and complaints about not getting enough sleep in med school they brought the night to a premature close. The night was still young and I was still too sober. I roamed the streets and searched for trouble I could get myself into.

A group of freshers, maybe a year or two younger than me, stood outside of an apartment and spoke in drunken whispers that weren’t meant to attract the attention of the neighbors. Some of them smoked like regular addicts, some puffed on their cigarettes as if they were cigars, but they all smoked. I asked for a light and soon enough was chatting with the tipsy crowd. 

Their night was going fantastic, the drinks were strong and the music was groovy. The only real issue was that there was no balcony at the apartment so all the smokers had to go down five flights of stairs whenever they were to satisfy their craving. I told them about the time my friend and I snuck into an abandoned munitions factory and about how we had to climb up to the roof to feel safe lighting up. A very drunk member of the group who was severely underdressed for the weather kept on asking me if I wasn’t scared sneaking around an old building. I offered her my jacket and said the only thing I was scared of was lighting up a smoke around the smell of gunpowder. 

The real smokers had another cigarette and those just trying it out shivered. When the group headed back inside of the apartment I followed. By the sounds of it all of them had met just a week or two prior, but I still got the gentlest of highs sneaking myself into their midsts.The underdressed girl fumbled off my jacket and asked me if I was also a part of the film and television society. Obviously I was, I said, why else would I be at their party?

A mountain of shoes that reeked of sweat sat right in front of the door but once we threw our coats on the coat pile the scent of the party became distinctly liquor based. I made my way to the closest gathering of drinks and poured myself a poor man’s tequila sunrise. The whole gathering had the unmistakable ambience of a fresher’s party, deafeningly loud in general but quiet in corners. For a while I drank and floated around the different conversation circles, listening to people passionately recommend foreign TV series. The conversation wasn’t particularly fascinating but the rain had picked up outside and it was nice to be around people. At some point a neighbor frantically buzzed on the door and insisted that it was late and that the music should be turned down. Within three songs someone had grown enamored enough with the tunes to blast them back to full volume. I had taken two vodka shots with a red faced boy who looked straight out of highschool. I found myself dancing along with the music, it wasn’t particularly good but the alcohol was catching up with me. I poured myself another tequila and juice and made my way towards the kitchen to see if there was anything else floating around the party. The moment my feet touched tile I stopped dancing.

The atmosphere in the kitchen was radically different from the rest of the house party. No drug stuff was happening, no one was milling around the water tap or fridge. Instead, two middle aged men and an elderly woman sat at the table. All three of them were oval in terms of body shape and wore what looked like labcoats over their large bodies. Their skin was unhealthy to the point of grayness and their eyes were a pinkish yellow. Exhaustion and something more nefarious seemed to have completely drained them of life but the old woman managed a faint smile when I entered the kitchen.

‘Excited for the tape?’ she croaked in my general direction.

‘Yes,’ I said, turning away from the trio, ‘Very excited.’

I gathered my thoughts, refilled my drink and slunk to the part of the party that didn’t make me uncomfortable. There was a couple more buzzes at the door but the volume of the music didn’t change. Moving through the clumps of conversation I managed to find out that the gathering was held for the premiere of some *tape*. Apparently the strange grouping in the kitchen were the first to arrive at the party. No one had proper details, most folks just came along because of the free booze. Drunkenly, though, people were getting excited about this mysterious *tape*. I must admit that I too found myself somewhat excited to see what this *tape* was. I found myself getting drunk too. I was enjoying the anticipation.

Then I bumped into a locked door. 

I had drank enough to get lost on my way to the bathroom. I found the line shortly after, but the thought had stuck with me. I was drunk at a party full of drunk strangers and there was a locked door. While I waited to use the bathroom I kept on thumbing the two bent paper clips in my pocket. After I finally managed to empty my bladder I went back to the door.

No one was watching and it didn’t take long. I picked the lock and went into the place where I wasn’t meant to be.

The moment the door closed behind me the party simmered down into nothing but the throbbing base of the music. I stood in a large bedroom with a couch and an old television in the center of the room. The air smelled like fresh sheets. Outside the rain had turned violent, right by the window a fire-escape shimmered and creaked beneath the wind of the storm. Just to prove to myself how comfortable was I stretched my legs on the couch, then I strolled around to the bed and explored how soft it is. There was an iPhone on the dresser. Out of pure instinct, I snagged it. For a moment I questioned the impulse, but then I just made sure the phone was off and looked around the room for other valuables. I found nothing of worth in the bedside drawers and I was going to move on to the desk, but then I heard the door open. I slid under the bed like my life dependent on it.

Immediately, to calm my heartbeat, I started comparing my current predicament to almost getting caught in an old Soviet munitions factory. The heavy footfalls I heard were scarier than any post-Soviet security guard.

‘Soon, soon, so very soon,’ gurgled one of the men from the kitchen, ‘We will see it all so very soon.’

‘Patience, friend,’ rasped the other, ‘If science has taught us anything, it is patience.’

The two heavy men walked by the bed and the scent of popcorn followed. My breath struggled against the layer of dust at my nose. I did my best to focus on the smell of food.

The door to the party opened, letting in a torrent of music ‘Are the snacks prepared?’ the shrill woman asked.

‘Yes,’ one of the grey men replied. ‘It is almost time.’

The door closed. The steady heart beat of bass went on for a couple more pumps but then went quiet. The old woman was directing the group towards the bedroom with high pitched screams. Fully aware of the two strange men a couple feet away from me I rolled to my side to avoid sneezing. Through a mirror I could see the television and one of the oval men. His arms were disproportionately stubby to his body and his fingers squirmed with excitement.

‘I can’t wait,’ he gurgled at his partner.

‘You will,’ he gurgled back.

Then, the door opened and the room started to fill with drunk teenagers. Occasionally someone would yell about how excited they were to see the tape but the old woman quickly shushed them. I was still stuck beneath the bed, but the anticipation was getting to me. We were all drunk and young and a rowdy madness simmered in that room. The crowd amplified the legend of the tape and the booze gave it edge. By the time the old lady waddled in front of the television, even though there must’ve been at least thirty of us in the room, everyone went silent.

‘Thank you for coming to this meeting of the film and television society. It is now time for the *tape*.’ The old woman’s words provoked a drunken whisper that spread throughout the room. She shushed it with the authority of a schoolteacher. ‘You are not to speak during the playing of the tape. If you do, however, feel like laughing — that is permitted. This tape is meant to amuse and delight and educate. Now, with no further comments I present to you — *Professor Egghead’s Education Station*.’

A university lecture hall flickered onto the screen. The hall had the attendance of a non-mandatory class and from the few students that were there most of them looked asleep. A couple, however, had their laptops open and were furiously typing up notes.

‘I, uh, I seemed to have lost my words.’ The lecturer was a short man with a scruffy goatee. Sweat was gathering on top of his bald head and his eyes darted back and forth between the unenthused crowd. ‘I knew I was meant to say something but — Just give me a moment. Just let me find my place.’ He spoke in a near whisper, but the microphone attached to his collar boomed his mumblings with an echo. Magnified above him loomed a powerpoint presentation. The nervous lecturer cycled through the slides, looking for something.

Back in the audience seats the napping students started to wake up. The moment their eyes open they would grab their laptops and start furiously typing notes. No one in the lecture hall looked comfortable.

‘Ah. Yes. The cat.’ The lecturer breathed out a sigh of relief that hissed in the speakers above. A slide titled the *Copenhagen Interpretation* was projected on the wall. Beneath the title there was a picture of a film reel with a cat. The first three frames featured a simple picture of the cat but then the reel split into two sources. The cat was alive in the first and dead in the second one. ‘Okay, so we have the cat outside of the box. No, wait. The cat is inside of the box but the box is — I don’t think I can do this.’

The students continued furiously typing their notes. Beneath the clattering of the keyboards and the lecturer’s labored breathing another sound arose — the applause of a studio audience.

‘I can’t. Please. I can’t do this. I can’t do this anymore,’ The lecturer pleaded with the students, ‘Please, if we all work together…’ His words fell on deaf ears. The students kept on typing their notes and the applause kept on getting louder. The bald man looked up at the powerpoint presentation and wept. ‘The cat is in the box. The cat is not in the box. The box is — I can’t. I can’t do this anymore. I give up.’

The doors flew open and a nightmare leapt into the lecture hall. ‘I AM PROFESSOR EGGHEAD! THE EMPEROR OF ALL UNIVERSITIES, THE HEADMASTER OF ALL KNOWLEDGE!’ the creature screamed in an unearthly falsetto. ‘I AM PROFESSOR EGGHEAD AND THIS MAN IS AN IMPOSTOR!’

This Professor Egghead looked much like the gray skinned strangers I met in the kitchen, but where their bodies were misshapen with weight his was completely inhuman. He was shaped like an egg — an egg with a horribly tired face with diseased eyes and sharp teeth. A labcoat stretched across his malproportioned body and he gripped a large colorful mallet in his stubby fingers.

‘Please, I beg of you, I don’t want to do this anymore. I have a family,’ the lecturer begged. ‘Just let me go. Let all of us go. We have done this for long eno—’

The egghead’s mallet looked like something out of a cartoon but it met the lecturer’s forehead with the bluntness of a snuff film. Within three savage hits the lecturer no longer had a face. The studio audience found this show of brutality to be absolutely hilarious. The students in the lecture hall were terrified. They stopped typing. The whole lecture hall stared on in horror as the egg-shaped nightmare continued to assault the teacher. ‘I HAVE UNTHRONED THIS FALSE PROPHET!’ The egghead screamed victoriously, sending thick chunks of spittle across the room. ‘LOOK AT ME! I AM THE TEACHER NOW!’

The students on the television started to type again. The drunk freshers in the bedroom began to grow uneasy. For a moment my view of the television screen was obstructed by figures moving in the darkness of the mirror. A couple of the drunk teenagers had seen enough of *the* *tape* and wanted out. The moment that they started to move a series of *boo*s came from the audience

‘YOU THERE! SIT BACK DOWN!’ the egghead screamed from the television. The drunk freshers trying to move through the room stopped. ‘YES! YOU THERE IN THE DARKNESS. GO BACK TO WHERE YOU WERE. I AM THE ACADEMIC EQUIVALENT OF A BARON! YOU WILL NOT DISRESPECT ME DURING MY OWN LECTURE! SIT DOWN!’

A deafening round of applause came from the television. The figures in the darkness sat back down where they were, I once again had full view of the television. A pair of bloodshot eyes stared back at the camera, but something felt off. It felt like the egghead was looking specifically at *me*. As if out of instinct, my eyes drifted to the dusty floor.

‘GOOD.’ The creature’s voice softened. ‘NOW THAT EVERYONE IS SEATED AND TAKING NOTES IT IS TIME TO INTRODUCE YOU TO THE FIELD WHICH I HOLD DOMINION OVER — SCIENCE!’

‘THERE HAVE BEEN LIES PRINTED IN THE PRESS ABOUT MY KINGDOM. PROPAGANDA BY ENEMIES BOTH FOREIGN AND DOMESTIC MEANT TO INSTILL A FALSE SENSE OF SECURITY. BEING A SCIENTIST IS NOT *COOL*. BEING A SCIENTIST IS NOT *FUN*. BEING A SCIENTIST IS NOT *REWARDING*. TO SUBMIT YOUR BODY TO SCIENCE IS TO STARE INTO THE UNKNOWN AND SURRENDER ALL HOPE.’

The studio audience praised Professor Egghead’s monolog with a round of applause. The person sitting on top of the bed that I was hiding under shifted uncomfortably. I found myself watching the television once more. There was something horribly wrong with the egg-head creature and I kept on wanting to look away, but I’m a curious fella. I couldn’t help myself.

Professor Egghead had taken over the powerpoint presentation. The title of the slide was ‘LIES ABOUT SCIENCE’ and featured pictures of smiling scientists and lab technicians. Professor Egghead stared at the cheery pictures as if they were an affront to God. He spat at the wall, leaving behind a sliding splatter of milky brown.

‘DO NOT BELIEVE THE MEDIA. SCIENCE IS *SUFFERING*. SCIENCE IS *PAIN!* TO ILLUSTRATE MY POINT I WILL PRESENT A PICTURE WE CANNOT COMPREHEND.’ Ceremonially, the egghead extended the powerpoint controller and pressed his stubby finger on the next slide button.

The whole room of freshers erupted in screams. I averted my eyes as soon as I could but even the mere glimpse of what was on the screen made me stifle a cry of my own. I stared at the floor and tried to clear my mind yet the afterimage remained — a mess of inhuman eyes and strands of flesh and arteries. The rest of the room continued screaming, the freshers were trying to escape but something was in their way. 

‘YES! YES! THIS IS THE SOUND OF SCIENCE!’ the egghead screamed from the television, ‘THIS IS THE MUSIC OF RESEARCH! WE DO NOT KNOW WHAT THIS IS! WE FEAR IT! WE SHOULD FEAR IT! SCIENCE IS NOT *COOL*!’

A banging broom from below joined the screaming of the freshers. The bedroom door remained closed. I dug myself further beneath the bed to avoid a stampede. I kept my eyes to the floor to avoid going insane.

‘NOW YOU UNDERSTAND! NOW YOU ARE ONE WITH SCIENCE! IT IS TIME! IT IS TIME FOR THE INDUCTION INTO THE FINAL UNIVERSITY!’

The studio audience cheered from the television. The screams of the freshers grew and grew. All I could smell was gunpowder. Someone was standing on top of the bed yelling at people to break the window. The girl who I lent my jacket to had fallen on the floor not far from me. Beneath the stampede she couldn’t get out. The world existed in complete deafening chaos. 

And then, it stopped.

Everything had suddenly gone silent. All I could hear was a gentle static buzz from the television. The jacket girl was gone. Everyone was gone. Outside, the fire escape gently creaked in the wind. I tried to keep my eyes glued to the floor, I tried waiting it all out, but eventually I couldn’t help but satisfy my curiosity. I looked towards the mirror and stifled another scream.

The lecture hall on the television was now full. Among the note-taking students sat drunk and underdressed and terrified freshers. The camera focused on their scared faces. The studio audience reacted with joyous laughter. Among the hall full of scared youth the gray skins from the kitchen sat. They were all beaming with unbridled joy.

‘IS THERE ANYONE MISSING IN ATTENDANCE?’ Professor Egghead screamed, ‘NO ONE IS HIDING FROM THEIR RESEARCH DUTIES, ARE THEY?’

The moment the egghead looked into the camera I forced my face back to the floor. ‘HELLO? IS SOMEONE MISSING?’ the egg said softly. ‘AH WELL. IF SOMEONE IS MISSING THEY WILL BE FOUND EVENTUALLY. THEY ARE ALWAYS FOUND. IN THE WORLD OF RESEARCH THERE ARE ONLY ENTRYWAYS. THERE ARE NO EXITS. NO ONE CAN ESCAPE THE COMPANY OF PROFESSOR EGGHEAD.’

The studio audience rewarded this with another round of applause, but the clapping eventually died down. By the time I looked back at the television the screen had gone dark. I stared at it for a minute or two and tried to make sense of what had just happened but no explanation presented itself. Once I was sure the room was empty I crawled out of my hiding spot and immediately went for the television. I turned it off. I also plugged out all the cables for good measure.

The whole apartment was empty. All that was left of the visitors was a sea of sweaty shoes and a pile of coats. I tried convincing myself that there was no conceivable way that a television could suck in a room full of people but my mind refused to be rational. I took a quick gulp of some tequila and it had calmed me somewhat, but I knew what I really had to do was go home. I fished my coat out of the pile, dug out my shoes and was ready to leave. Just as I was about to open the door however, there was a loud knock.

‘Police! Open up!’

I backed off from the door. Very quickly my mind went through the possible outcomes of a situation. There was no reasonable explanation for my attendance of the party and there definitely wasn’t any reasonable explanation for what had happened at said party. With the amount of alcohol in my bloodstream I knew I couldn’t talk my way past the cops. I didn’t trust myself not to slur my words but I still had some faith in my sense of balance. Leaving behind a gruff voiced officer banging on the door I made my way back to the bedroom and opened the window.

My landing from the firescape wasn’t very graceful and I sprained an ankle running back home, but I made it out. I don’t understand what happened to all of those freshers. I can’t comprehend what this egghead creature wants — but I managed to make it out of that apartment alive.

I made it out alive, yet as the hours pass I’m starting to realize that I didn’t make it out unscathed. I feel ill. With every passing minute I feel less and less comfortable in my skin. It’s as if I’m not alone, it’s as if the egghead had somehow clung onto my mind past the fire-escape from the party. When I close my eyes I can hear him. I can hear him with undeniable clarity:

‘NO ONE CAN ESCAPE THE COMPANY OF PROFESSOR EGGHEAD.’

I have a tendency of stumbling into places where I don’t belong but after tonight I think I’ve learned my lesson. If you ever get invited for the viewing of some mysterious *tape* stay as far away as you can. Stay as far away as you can because once Professor Egghead notices you there is no [escape](https://www.reddit.com/r/MJLPresents/comments/tkgvgt/the_adventures_of_professor_egghead/).

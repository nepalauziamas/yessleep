I am a gym coach and I live in a small and safe town, it has 1 gym and I am one of the coaches there, it closes late at 1am since it is a crowded one, i was pretty jacked at that time and i was a bodybuilding addict, i would go too far just to have the perfect body, and we have an overtime were we can go to the gym and use it anytime its closed, i was a night shift and woke late so i just thought i would work out after the gym closes at 1 am.


Last month i was sitting on my phone mindlessly scrolling reddit, until i got a phonecall from my boss saying im not going to work this week, i asked why, he replied "there was an incident", i was confused not knowing what was wrong and he explained that this morning a guy dropped a 120 kg weighted barbell on his head laying down, no one was there to help him as he was doing it without a warning, he broke his skull and killed him.


It came as a shock ofcourse, i couldnt believe it, how could he have done something so stupid, this rare of an accident and in our gym!


The next week i went to the gym, i noticed it was very empty, just 1 or 2 people working out, it wasn't surprising because of the incedent last week, once the gym closed i went on my workout routine, my co-workers were not in the mood for it, so i was the only one at the gym.


I was lifting weights until i heard one of our treadmills beggining to work, i looked up to the second floor, since our gym is 2 stories the second one is just a balcony overlookijg the 1st floor of the gym, thats where our treadmils were, there was a guy, running on the treadmill, i shouted


"Who's there?"

*No response*

The things seemed not human as he was a very tall, and skinny figure with long arms.


I checked my watch, I noticed its 2:22am june 4th


"The gym is closed, you shouldn't be here" I shouted


The figure seemed to tilt it's head towards me,
It stared at me for what seemed like hours, Not making a single sound.


I hear screeches that hurt my ear to its core.


"The gym will be closed in 5 minutes, please pack your things. We would like to remind you that the opening hours are 10 am to 1 am, thank you for your cooperation" the speakers go off, i look at my clock, its 12:55am, may 27th, 1 day before the incident.

I look up again, there are people, normal humans running on the treadmill, i look around me, people are finishing up and getting ready to go, my co workers going to the lockers, and everything is normal.


Someone touches my shoulder.


"Coach, i am not having it with this diet right now, why cant i eat bread!"


*Its the man, the man who died.*



"Oh, uhm yeah, uh-"


"Coach whats wrong? Looks like someone just held you at gunpoint haha"


"Oh nothing's wrong, everything is fine."


"You sure you don't need some sleep? I don't know... But you gotta keep it down with these late night workouts, you look tired."


"Yeah i probably need some sleep."


I go back home, skipping on my usual late workout, i figured i needed sleep.


I never slept.


I thought i hallucinated or had a nightmare, but it was all real, the moment i got the phonecall from my boss to when I saw... It.

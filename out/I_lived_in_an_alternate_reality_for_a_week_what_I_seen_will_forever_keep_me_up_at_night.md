I (20m) haven't had a great start to life, my mother kicked me out a month after I turned 18, I lived on the streets and in hotels off and on ever since, never had a girlfriend, I don't have an education and im self employed with very few jobs. So as you can see I was desperate for money. I don't have much time to tell you this, i'm using a library computer so let's keep this as short as possible. 

it was another hot summer day and I was sitting downtown with my cardboard sign like always "looking for work. will do anything." Hundreds of people had passed me at this point and I had already lost hope, it looked like it was gonna be another day without a meal. That was until a man approached me he wore a trench coat and a hat. Keep in mind this was the middle of summer so it was a pretty strange outfit. 

"I could use a little help...i'll pay you 10k for a job well done." he spoke in a low tone and his voice sounded raspy despite him only appearing to be in his mid twenties. My jaw dropped at the thought of having that much money, like I said I was desperate and this 10k would change my life so I followed without question. He led me to a black truck and I climbed inside. He started driving and began to explain what he needed me to do. He refused to tell me who he was but he told me he was part of a government operation, they were trying to find ways to teleport humans to alternate realities of their choosing. I laughed at the thought of this, I mean it just wasn't possible. right? but the expression on his face told me he was serious. He asked me what my desired reality would be like. I told him I'd want to be rich, I'd want a hot girlfriend, I'd want an amazing job and I'd want lots of friends. when I finished explaining my reality to him I felt a sharp stab in my neck. I don't remember much past then, I think I was either drugged or knocked out. I awoke in a bed and as I opened my eyes I was shocked. I lay next to someone. their back facing me. startled, I quickly but quietly stumbled out of bed. The person began to wake.

"babe?...off to work already?" A female voice spoke tiredly and she turned to me. My eyes widened she was the most beautiful woman I had ever set eyes on. My heart began to poud, As I further inspected my surrondings, king sized bed, nice paintings on the wall, huge window that peered out to a pool. I looked back at the girl and my head just kept screaming "linda, linda, linda" this girls name was Linda, I don't know how I knew but I did. 

"Linda honey, you care to make me some breakfast?" I asked her and she quickly stood up and exited the room. I experienced day and night in this strange place, I discovered I was the CEO of a very popular company, I discorvered I had many friends whom often came over to throw parties. This place was so weird. But it wasn't until the final day where it became very strange. 

I awoke one morning to find Linda not next to me. She must've gotten up earlier. I sighed as I pulled myself out of bed and got dressed. I could hear footsteps approaching me and a cold breath on my shoulder. I quickly turned to great Linda but she wasn't there, the footsteps stopped. "Linda?" I shouted. no response. I exited the room and went down to the kitchen. She wasn't there either. I noticed a red stain on the white kitchen counter. I sighed and tried scrubbing it off but the harder I scrubbed the bigger the stain got. Something in my mind told me to get out of the house but I ignored it. I set the cloth down, I had to find Linda. I heard a door creak behind me and turned to see the basement door flung open.

"haha nice try Honey...found you!" I shouted playfully as I peaked down the steps. nothing. just darkness. once again a cold breath ran up my spine and once again my mind told me to leave but I just couldn't listen to it. I tried turning on the basement light but It didn't work. the lightbulb must've gone out. 

"Babe! can you come down here? I need your help!" a voice called me, it was Lindas. I turned on my phone flashlight and headed down the stairs. I shone it ahead of me and began to search the basement for my girlfriend but when I called for her she didn't answer. I felt someone set their hand on my shoulder, I jumped and quickly turned. Linda wasn't there but I noticed something I hadn't noticed before. A puddle of black goop I slowly approached the puddle and it let off a horrifying smell. I can't describe the smell but it wasn't good. I noticed it spreading from out of the ground. It was spreading fast. Leeching towards me. I jumped back but my food was caught on something. I looked down and this black goop lay beneath my foot like glue. I couldn't fight it, my foot stayed in place. Then it began tugging me. I screamed for help but of course no one responded. I felt a great heavy force smack the back of my head and I fell face first into the pavement. 

When I awoke I lay in the middle of a park. I glanced around startled. I recognized this park from my real world. everything just seemed fuzzy and off. I glance down and see my shoe is covered in black stains. I continued on with my life, its been a few weeks now but like I said theres something off with this world and I still wonder if it wasn't Linda in the basement with me that morning...who was it?

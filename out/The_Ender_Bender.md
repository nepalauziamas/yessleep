 I used to hang around with the wrong crowd. I used to be hooked on meth.  I had just been kicked out of my parents house and was totally lost, and terrible at making friends. The only friends I had were meth users and after my parents kicked me out at 18 I had no one else to rely on. My name is Seth and this is the story of why I quit my meth addiction.

 I was living alone in a bachelor apartment, I didn't have a job and social assistance would hardly cover my rent, let alone any of my expenses. The one thing I did have was a car, and friends who needed to sell drugs. 

 I ended up making just enough to get by between my assistance check and my drug running, but the people I met were all either addicts, or sellers and I eventually started making friends.

&#x200B;

 One time I went to visit the guy I thought was my best friend, Lyle, he said he had some exceptional product and a plan. I arrived around 6pm, I had been up for 8 hours.

 I arrived at his apartment and pulled in. After parking I noticed Lyle looking out at me from his window. He went from totally stoic to a full satanic grin and pulled back the curtains. The event struck me as very odd because, he was a person who very rarely smiled at all.

 I walked in through the entry way and went to Lyle's door and knocked. He quickly let me in and we sat down. His girlfriend, Kylie, sat on the couch, staring absently at CTV. It was the only channel they had, and she watched an upwards of 14 hours a day.

  "This is the purest shit I've ever gotten dude, check it out" then Lyle pulled out a block of crystal meth the size of a jumbo roll of toilet paper. "And I got it all for only 5k! What an absolute steal! Before I start selling it what do you say you and me go on a bender? Do a bunch of meth and PARTY HARD! "

 He busted off a couple of points of meth and threw them in the pipe. He quickly melted it down and we started smoking. It hit me almost immediately, this intense feeling of energy, this otherworldly strength. And accompanied by that was this euphoric feeling that started to ebb and flow. 

 while we exchanged small talk, about Kylie, who was basically catatonic. "I wish she could at least cook." Lyle complained. "I work hard all day washing dishes just so I can come home and cook us both dinner." Lyle looked towards Kylie with frustration. "At least the hole works..."

 I thought about how I didn't have anyone and then my mind went back to the meth. "Man this is some good stuff dude, I can't believe just how elated I feel."

 Lyle rolled the pipe back and forth, smoke coming out of the tiny hole in the top than took a big puff, then responded "And look how much we have dude. We can party for as long as we want, lack of sleep can't kill you."

 We stayed up all night just talking and smoking, and we had smoked more than a gram of meth by morning.

&#x200B;

 The sun rose at 7am, I had been up for 21 hours. Me and Lyle went outside and we lit cigarettes as we watched the sun rise. I didn't know why, but the sun just seemed darker than normal. It still appeared as if there was a normal amount of light, it just seemed darker.

 "So I've been talking to some users on 420chan." Lyle said proudly."The shadow people are real, I know tons of people who have talked to them man, I'm not crazy."

 I paused, he had mentioned them once or twice, but I had thought they were just a hallucination. I mean this guy worked 2 jobs and sold and smoked meth. He hardly slept and I knew that that could make you hallucinate. "How do you know they are real?" I finally asked.

 "Because I've talked to people man, and they all saw the same stuff I did. If you stay awake for more than a couple days you can see the shadow people. You can even talk to them man."

 "isn't not sleeping really bad for you though? Like can't it damage your body?" I responded.

 "You can't die from not sleeping" Lyle responded. He then ashed his cigarette and said "Lets go see Zoe, I could use some eye candy".

 Lyle lead Kylie to the car and we were off. We arrived at Zoe's apartment in know time and went up and knocked on her door. Her boyfriend Randal opened the door and looked hurt. "what brings you here so early fellas?"

 Lyle mouthed the word meth and Randal sighed and opened the door. We went and sat on the couch while Randal went to wake Zoe. She hated being woken up this early, but free meth was the only thing that would get her out of bed before noon. 

 Soon she came from the bedroom in a bathrobe with a huge smile on her face. "is it good? she asked.

 "Best ever, as I'm sure Seth can attest"Lyle said. I nodded.

 "Oh I love you guys, this beats breakfast in bed any day!" Zoe responded and grabbed her pipe. As she rolled the pipe back and forth, and inhaled. Randal looked at her sorrowfully. He didn't use anymore, he wouldn't even drink. But he remembered the feeling.

 After Zoe had smoked a big bowl she handed me the pipe and I turned it away. "I've got to sleep soon" I said.

 Lyle looked extremely angry for a second then responded calmly. "You don't need to sleep, we have meth. You can't die from not sleeping. One time I stayed up for an entire week smoking meth and I'm still fine"

 Me and Randal both looked at Lyle, shocked. "What happened?" We said in unison.

 Lyle said "I was at the old trap house before it was condemned. I just sat on the couch and Joe was giving me meth with a revolving door of people. I sat there for 7 days and smoked meth. Around day 3 I started hearing a cat screaming. I asked the other people who were there if they heard the cat, but no one did. Then I started seeing some people that the others couldn't see. they had dark shimmering bodies, red eyes, and a stick figure like profile. I stared one of them in eyes and then I talked to him. He said that if stayed up a little longer I could see his home. Then after a while I saw this beautiful green meadow with single fairy ladies and springs of chocolate milk. Then the shadow person told me if I stayed up a little longer I could come to his world forever. So I went to sleep and I've come to spread the word. I even met some others on 420chan who have seen the place."

 Me, Zoe and Randal all stared at him dumbfounded. Then Zoe responded "I want to go the fairy kingdom. I only slept for 3 hours last night so lets get this started. Randal you can trip sit us in case anything goes wrong." Randal responded like a beaten dog and got everyone drinks. Time flies when you smoking meth and before we knew it the sun was down. And then up again.

	

 The 3 meth smokers all went outside to watch the sun rise and have our morning cigarette. The other 2 were fast asleep. As I took my first drag and looked at the sun, I realized that it seemed even dimmer than yesterday. It was 7am, and I had been up for 45 hours.

 Zoe didn't look tired at all, she dragged hard on the cigarette and said "No shadow people yet. Are you sure about this Lyle? I'm starting to think your pulling our legs."

 "Day 3 is when things start getting weird" Lyle insisted. "Just wait" he said then cackled like a demon.

 We headed back to the apartment. And Zoe woke up Randal so he could make breakfast. We spent the day playing games, watching TV and smoking meth and by dusk we were all craving some McDonalds.

 The 5 of us packed into the car and all headed for the drive through. After we got our food we parked in the parking lot and started chowing down.

 As I was eating I noticed something odd. Two stick men with dark, shimmering bodies were standing in the trees looking at me. Its seemed that Lyle had forgotten to mention that the shadow people had large pointed horns. "Are those the shadow people?" I asked aloud. 

 Zoe looked at me. "And said I don't see them, do you Lyle?"

 "Not yet, but we won't see the same ones anyway"

 I continued too stare at the shadow people noting the malice in their red eyes. "They looks kind of scary... I'm not sure if I want to stay up any longer."

 "Oh come on Seth, this is the part of the high that most people enjoy. You can't die for not sleeping!" Lyle said.

 I looked from one shadow person to another and they looked back at me then walked away and disappeared.

 We drove back to Zoe's and left Kylie, and Randal to babysit her. Then the 3 of us headed to my apartment. My cat Dianne was happy to see us and I got her food and water. After that Kyle brought out the pipe and some meth and we started a sesh. Before we knew it the sun was up.

	

&#x200B;

 I stood there smoking my morning cigarette with Lyle and Zoe and all I could think about was how dim the sun seemed. I could still see fine but it almost reminded me of a full moon. It was 7am, I had been up for 69 hours.

 "I still haven't seen anything" Zoe announced.

 "Just wait till tonight" Lyle said, smirking.

 "I want a coffee and a white hot chocolate, lets go to Dunkin." Zoe said sweetly. 

 When we got there we were planning to sit inside and chitchat, but we felt so out of place with all the early risers. IT felt like we were from a different planet than these people. Even Zoe, not usually the anxious one, wanted to just get the drinks and go. On the way back Zoe started to comment on hearing music that wasn't there.

 When we got back to my apartment the wind was howling And I had this odd feeling in my gut almost like I was surrounded by danger. Once back in side Zoe turned and looked at Lyle, batting her eyelids. "I'm hearing stuff we need to smoke more meth so I feel better."

 Lyle didn't hesitate and we were back at it till sundown. As it got dark Zoe started to giggle "I can see them! I can see them!"

 "How many of them do you see?" I asked.

 "There are Dozens of them! When do we get to see the fairy kingdom?"

 "Maybe tomorrow!" Lyle responded.

 I looked around the room and started to notice many shimmering stick people. There seemed to be hundreds of them and they were all around me. "there sure seem to be a lot of them." I said aloud.

 "There are so many more of them than there are people in this world." Lyle laughed.

 I stared into one's red eyes and said "They don't really seem very friendly."

 "Nonsense, they are your friends now. You should get acquainted." Lyle said with a serious tone.

 I looked closely at one of them, studying it. It shimmered while appearing dark, and it almost seemed like it was behind something. Like there was some kind of barrier between us. I tried to look from one to where they were but I couldn't seem to focus on it. Eventually all the shadow people left and I felt a chill down my spine.

 After they left Zoe was the first to proclaim that they had gone. "The shadow people are gone for tonight, but they told me they will show us our new home tomorrow. I need a tokie after that" Lyle had a sinister grin as he threw more meth into the pipe. We smoked and guessed at what we would see the following night, thinking it would be a lush paradise. We got so caught up talking and smoking that we missed the sunrise.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

 We filed out around noon to have our morning cigarette. We were all emaciated. Not sleeping or eating very much was tarting to take a toll on us. All the neighbors just gave us dirty looks. It was noon, I had been awake for around 98 hours. I looked to Zoe, she had lit a cigarette, and without taking a single drag had let the entire thing burn. The long ash still hung from the filter.

 "We should probably eat" I said hearing my stomach growl.

 "We definitely need to have a toke first" Lyle chimed in, "The meth is all that's keeping us going man."

 The three of us went back in to have another sesh and before we new it the sun was down and we still hadn't eaten anything.

 "Oh one of them has a stick Zoe" exclaimed. "And he's hitting something with it."

 "Ah, the shadow people have come bearing gifts. You just need to let them in so they can take you to the fairy realm." Lyle said with a deadpan tone.

 I then noticed a large shadow person holding what looked like a kanabo, and hitting the barrier between us. I felt an intense fear take hold of me as I made eye contact with the shadow person.

 "What are they doing?" I yelped.

 "They are just trying too get in, Seth. You need to let them in so they can take you to the fairy realm." Lyle paused for a moment. "Very few people on 420chan have made it this far Seth. But the best part of the high is still to come."

 I felt a pain welling up in my stomach and then before I knew it I had thrown up. Right after I did Zoe following suit. As I looked at the vomit I noticed it was just stomache acid. We were starving.

&#x200B;

 We watched the sun rise that morning from the window of a 24 hour iHop. I had been up for 117 hours. I had eaten 12 pancakes and didn't feel tired at all. All the meth going through my system and me fighting the feeling of sleep for so long made me feel like I might never sleep again. 

 As the sun rose Zoe instinctively took out a cigarette and lit it. She looked peaceful as she took her first drag and looked out the window. I turned and saw the waitress standing there, looking at Zoe like she had 7 goat heads.

 "You can't smoke in here!" She said sternly as Zoe ashed the cigarette in the butter. Zoe turned, looking hurt, then put it out in butter.

 As we drove home I almost crashed twice. Lyle put it up to it being over 2 hours since I had a toke.

 Once we got back Zoe facetimed Randal, who was really upset that we had not come back yet. "Your LAME, you don't do anything, you won't even drink!" Zoe screamed at the phone. "I'm just having fun, you should have fun with me instead of always being a downer!" Zoe yelled and hung up. She smiled at Lyle, who already had the pipe ready. 

 "The high will be even better now that we've eaten" Lyle exclaimed. As he watched the smoke fill the pipe and rolled it to the side, inhaling the smoke.I looked the the block of meth and we had hardly even made a dent. "I bet you'll see the fairy realm tonight guys. Be excited." The rest of the day passed uneventfully as the TV blared on in the background. We were all way to strung out to pay attention to it.

 WE hardly even noticed when the sun went down; and we just sat there in a haze. I looked from Zoe to Lyle and while Zoe seemed like me, in a drugged out stupor, Lyle seemed to be handling the whole thing very well.

 I was jolted from my thoughts to hear Zoe screaming the most soul wrenching scream I have ever heard. She was looking at something I couldn't see, screaming uncontrollably. Lyle grabbed her and she went from screaming to sobbing. My eyes darted around; I was terrified by what I was about to see, then I saw it.

 I was inside of a bubble, and all around me was this barren, red soil. There were no plants of any kind and the sky was blood red. Volcanoes erupted in the distance and there were shadow people everywhere. Thousands of them had gathered around my bubble and were all striking it with blunt weaponry. I looked at Zoe and Lyle, who appeared to be inside of the bubble.

 Lyle looked at me and said "Welcome to your new home." And smiled with an evil grin.

 I grabbed ran to the entryway and grabbed my sword, and came back too Lyle still holding Zoe. Zoe's eyes were blood red and still gushing tears. "Get out of my house!" I yelled.

 Lyle thew Zoe to the ground and said "IS that any way to treat a friend? I've been smoking you up for the past 5 days for free and you pull a weapon on me? We can all be one big happy family now Seth. You, me, Zoe and the shadow people. They are a very welcoming bunch Seth, you shouldn't be so quick to judge them."

 "this place is not what you said it would be Lyle! Get out of here and take your meth with you. I'm going to sleep." I yelled.

 "The virginal fairy women will appear soon." Lyle smirked and I started moving towards him. As soon as he realized he was in danger he cried out, grabbed his bag and ran for the door. I locked it behind him. I went to Zoe who was hysterical. What she was seeing had paralyzed her and she just sat there sobbing.

 I shook her to try and get her attention, then said " WE need to sleep Zoe! that's all we need to do!" She was unresponsive, and her eyes darted around between sobbing fits. I laid down in bed trying to sleep, but was unsuccessful. I was finding it extremely hard to ignore what was happening all around me and could not sleep. She shadow people eyed me hungrily as they worked.

	

&#x200B;

 As the sun rose and I realized I had been up for 141 hours. My body was full of adrenaline and meth, and I was the farthest thing from tired. I started sobbing as I realized that whatever I was seeing, real or not, did not go away in the morning light.

 "we will never be able to sleep with all the meth in our system!" Zoe sobbed. "We are going to die!" she choked out. We sat on floor hugging and sobbing into each others shoulders. WE had smoked so much meth we could be awake for days longer, and there was nothing we could do. As we sat there holding each other I heard a voice in my head.

 "I am Yahweh" it proclaimed.

 "Isn't that gods name?" I responded. "Your a hallucination just like the shadow people."

 "No Seth, I am real, and I am all powerful. I can make anyone do anything I want at any given point in time. And that includes you Seth." I then felt more tired than I ever had before In my life and fell asleep holding Zoe on the floor.

&#x200B;

 I woke up two full days later dying of thirst. Zoe was gone, apparently she fell asleep with me and Randal broke in a day later looking for her. Zoe couldn't remember any of the incident and I haven't seen or heard from Lyle since. Randal said he showed up in an Uber looking for Kylie and then disappeared. His landlord even said he had been evicted for not paying rent. I have been very tight lipped about what happened, always hoping Zoe would someday remember it, but she never did. I haven't smoked meth since then and never will again. I Still find it hard to sleep most of the time. I know what I've said must sound outlandish and made up, but it seemed soo real at the time.

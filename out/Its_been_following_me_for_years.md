This all started when I was 14. I use to leave to walk the family dog from midnight to 4 in the morning. It was my me time. The only peace I had. Or at least it was for a little bit.

About a week after I started doing this. I starting hearing things. Nothing you wouldn't normally hear outside. Footsteps here, talking there. Realistically there should've just been another person walking late as well. It slowly got worse as time went on. Everynight the footsteps got louder, closer, clearer. The talking, or rather mumbling was much less frequent, but as the nights went by it was more prominent.

Eventually around a month after this all began, I finally saw it. It looked like a man. At least that's what I thought at first. I could only ever see it's silhouette. I tried ignoring it, but a gut feeling told me to do otherwise. The same night I saw it for the first time was the last night I went out to walk the dog late.

From here on out I would only see it occasionally. It definitely only appeared at night. Like if I was sneaking out or had some late night errands to run. For a while I thought it was a creepy neighbor. It was always confined within my neighborhood. Or so I thought.

One night I snuck out with my stepbrother to go over to a girls house. Some girl he liked. I didn't have my license and he was younger so we had to walk. It took us a couple of hours. I saw it when we initially left, but like always after I left my area, it seemed to not be around.

We eventually made it to the girls place. Hung out for a couple of hours before we left. When we snuck out of her yard and onto the sidewalk I heard it. It's very distinct mumbling. I looked down the road, in the direction we had to go. There it was. Close enough for me to clearly see it's figure but far enough that I still couldn't see any details. I pointed it out to my stepbrother and he saw it too. 

We decided to cross the road and go around it that way. It didn't move and as we passed it from the other side of the street, I looked over and still couldn't see any details. I know I could probably chock it up to lighting but I feel like I should've at least been able to see some of the attire.

After we passed it we broke out in a sprint. Ran a few blocks before we were too tired to keep going. Spent the rest of the way looking over our shoulders.

A few years later I had to move out due to disagreements with my stepmother. I moved in with a friend in a new area. However, it was the area next to where I lived previously.

For some reason I stopped seeing it. For almost a year I hadn't encountered it. It was great. Not having to worry about something that had clearly been following me. Always finding where I was. Recently though, it returned. 

Around 2 months ago I moved out and in with a new friend. All the way across town. Nothing weird happened. Granted I do believe my friends place is haunted, however that has nothing to do with this. 

A couple of nights ago just before a thunderstorm, we went to a local park. Messing around with a ouija board. Heard sounds and saw shadows. It was interesting. But then we both heard whispering coming from the trees. We both looked in that direction and as we did, there was a flash behind us. Likely the thunder. But what we saw scared me beyond anything else that happened that night. 

There it was, standing in the trees. My friend saw it as well. We grabbed everything and ran down the trail and out the park. The rest of the walk home wasn't too absurd. My friend thinks it's some ghost due to the ouija board. I know it's that thing. That's not the worst part.

Last night when we were in our bedroom laying down. My friend had already fallen asleep. I was just laying there as well. About to fall asleep. When I heard the whispering. I turned towards the window and on the other side of the curtains I saw a silhouette of a man. I heard the most consistent whispering that night, last night. 

That was the first time encountering it while I was still at home. Now I'm afraid it'll slowly make it's way in. I just don't know what to do at this point.

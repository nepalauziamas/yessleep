Humingbird, that is what you can call me. I won't waste your time with who I am since if I mess this up, there will no me after they catch wind. I am posting this here and to the nurse's subreddit so someone believes me. You see I am-was a nurse at a new hospital in Mississippi. This was my first residency and wanting to make a good impression, always found that asking questions even stupid one, shown my employer I wanted to do my job and well. There's a plethora of questions, considering this hospital was huge as well as top of the line in a poor town in mississippi too. My main question of "Why is this hospital so top of the line, here of all places?" Some organization,the Lazarus project helped fund this place is about all I know" That made little sense, such a big and expensive hospital in this small town is mississippi of all places. Yet my new checks were bigger then say If worked at a normal hospital so I kept my mouth shut, yet then I started noticing some strange things. People would be rushed over to the E.R for the same procedure, organ transplant. I get it, it's one of the main functions of a hospital is to perform these operations but not in these numbers and the these people are always loaded. Seeing a rolex worth more then what I make in a year or a diamond wrist-let on these patients became common place.

Besides that I noticed something equally as disturbing on a late night shift once. I was doing my rounds on the base level when I heard a truck drive up. This dirty green moving truck was parked in the back. This was strange for several reasons, 1. Supply truck come in during the day 2. Supplies don't come from dirty civilian trucks but clean corporate trucks and 3. The guy who came out was no corporate driver. This guy looked like he hasn't bathed in a week, stringy long hair, grimy hand, and wearing a old tatted dirty 70's era army jacket. Some staff helped him bring in coolers one after the other. That really made my blood run cold as coolers those size in hospital means one thing, he was trans-portioning organs. 2 and 2 was adding up but honestly I more thought I was the crazy one, that it was some late night hallucination. Others nurses told me they had waking dreams after several night shifts in a row but when I came in after finally having a day off I did some investigating of my own. I was able to convince a good female "friend" nurse of mine to swipe the I.D badge of the head doctor she was secretly seeing behind her husband's back. Yet say some light blackmail was suggested.

I snuck into the transplant storage area and to my horror, I found the same coolers. I inspected the organs, who ever did this was talented but in a rush. Like they didn't have enough time or...or worse their patients weren't willing. I quickly ran to the bathroom and threw up my lunch then made some excuse to go home. I started contemplating gong to the police and watching TV to relax. Just then, a news report come on, "We have a shocking update on the Visitor Center killer, after his long string of murders at the Mississippi visitor center all taking place at night, we finally had a eye witness' sketch. On the T.V a sketch was shown, of a dirty man with long stringy hair and wearing a dirty 70's army jacket. I posted this as soon as I saw. The government or someone else made that hospital so some maniac could kill regular people to give organs to the rich? How high does this go? I was beside myself, So I posted this, on the nurse subreddit first. I just got a flood of Notifications. 8 new comments on my post "I am a hospital director and the Lazarus project is funding a new hospital is Arkansas too", "I am a nurse and heard the Lazarus project is coming to florida" etc,etc. All across the south the Lazarus project is spreading . The elites or government wants our organs and soon no where will be safe

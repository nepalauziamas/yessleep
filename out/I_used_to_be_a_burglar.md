From 8 years old until i was 19, i used to be a burglar. It started off from me stealing smalls toys and batteries, to stealing money and valuables and breaking into homes.

I learned some stuff from former burglars and used them to my advantage, i won't talk about them here cause i don't want anyone to get arrested or worst.

But anyway one of my friends (a burglar) suggested me a house to break into, he sent me a link to a google maps location which was a mansion. It stuck out like a sore thumb in the suburbs of New Mexico, he told me that there were some gold and other valuables. Jackpot! So i drive over there at midnight, the lights weren't on, so i guessed that they were either asleep or away on a trip.

I went over to their sliding door and slowly opened it, a very idiotic thing for them to do and i went inside.

There was a large wooden ship desktop model, it was very valuable to steal. But when i went to pick it up, the stand fell off and a roll of $45 dollars came out when the stand hit the floor. I began to hear somebody stomping down the stairs, "shit!" i thought to myself as i quickly picked up the money and stand. I had to hide, the closest thing i can hide in was the basement so i ran to the basement and shut the door quietly. I began to hear a man's voice saying "Oh where is he?", i began to slowly walk down the stairs to climb out of the window. 

But i began to smell a fowl smell, it was like the scent of rotten fish. I nearly gagged from the stench, so i turned on my flashlight so i can find a way to get out without knocking over stuff. That was until i saw a couch, it was all tan and the source of the smell was coming from the couch. I began to piece it all up when i was a knife with dried blood on it, i have never climbed out of a window so fast in my life. 

I began to call the police and when they arrived i confessed my crimes of stealing and breaking and entry, instead of the handcuffs being placed on my hands. It was the couple who got arrested, as i calmed down i sick feeling hit me like a train. I remembered that 17 people went missing in the same area of New Mexico that the couple lived in, i called my friend and told him to pick me up. When he arrived he asked me what had happened, i told him everything about it.

His face went pale like snow and he began to cry, "My friend went missing" he said choking back tears "they couldn't find his body." i hugged him and went to a bar to drink and forget about what happened.

It turned out that the couple had killed the missing people and skinned them like deer and used their skin for things, like furniture and blankets they even use their victim's skulls as bowls.

That night was the last time i would break into someone's home and steal, I'll never forget the smell and that Disturbing discovery. But you might ask "How is your life now?" well, i have a girlfriend now and a 5 year old son now so i changed my life. But everyone in awhile, i still get a whiff of blood.

I can’t tell you the amount of times I’ve been told by acquaintances and other peers how “lucky” I am for being an identical twin. It never fails.

“You have a twin!? *So cool.* I wish I was a twin.” 

“That telepathy, though.” 

“Rock on. Twins are hot.” 

I know–at face value, being a splice from another human being has all the wonders in the world. We swap classes to the complete obliviousness of teachers and faculty, we prank our friends, and we are insufferable watching people’s heads explode trying to figure out who we are. Though, for the two of us having such a strongly similar genetic makeup, Tess and I couldn’t have been any more different.

As toddlers, it was hard to tell the two of us apart. Of course, children around that age are treated similarly for convenience sake–at least until their personalities kick in and they begin to grow fond of their own individualities. As children, though, well into grade school, we began to display very distinct characteristics as well as taking a liking to our own preference in attire. I’d considered “dressed” as a nice pair of khaki cargo shorts with a *Rugrats* tank top; Tess always needed to dress the brightest, act the sweetest, and kiss the hardest. I was much more boy-ish, doing stupid things and playing harmless pranks on others because I found it amusing; Tess was the goody-good that never wanted to disappoint. 

We used to take these family vacations to a remote lake house cabin southwest of Macon, off of highway 280. Every summer was filled with mini-barbeques, beer binging (if you were my father), and boating on the water. I was surprised that I was even willing to come back after everything that had occurred.

Tess and I made a pact to *never* tell our parents what had happened then, but I felt even closer than ideal to Tess because, at one point in time, she’d saved my life. In the summer of ‘08, our parents stayed behind with aunts and uncles on both sides to start a fire at dusk and open a few cold ones while they played classics like “All Right Now” and “Smoke On The Water”. Tess and I were bored and wanted to hike the nearby trails. We told our parents, who of course didn’t care as long as we made it back in time to eat dinner before the nighttime bonfire.

The two of us made our way to the creek, and I had the brilliant idea to use a rotting rope to “swing like Tarzan” over the water; Tess always possessed more street smarts than I ever did and noted that it was a terrible idea and to leave it alone. I didn’t listen… because why would I listen to a drag like her? I swung, of course the rope broke, and I fell into the rushing stream of water, hitting the back of my head on a boulder that rested just beneath a bridge, and knocked myself out cold.

When I came to, I was in the back of my parents’ SUV, covered with a blanket and watching–through blurred vision and muffled hearing–my parents frantically drove me to the nearest ER. I felt as if my head was resting somewhere out of place, and my eyes looked up to see my sister, head tilted down and watching me protectively. She was worried, sure, but far more collected than my parents had been. She peered up at them with hooded eyes and back down at me, and before I could speak to her… touch her face… do anything to ground myself, she made direct eye contact with me and  held a silencing finger to her mouth while uttering a *“shh”.*

“It’s okay, sis,” she muttered, rubbing my hair. “You’re okay. We’re getting you help now.”

I don’t know how I managed to hear her over the frantic screams of my parents, but it made all the more difference. The doctors told me that I had suffered from a TBI (traumatic brain injury) and had to follow up with neurological testing to make sure everything was functioning the way that it was supposed to. In the months following, they ran every CAT and MRI scan in the book, yet couldn’t find anything on a grand scale that affected anything vital, like speech or fine motor skills. They said that I was “lucky”; they said I could’ve ended up dead.

Tess helped me come up with a story that didn’t involve a stupid, careless decision of me trying to make like Evel Knivele and do something I was going to regret. When confronted by our parents (after much needed rest at the hospital), Tess told my parents that we were walking along the edge of the creek when I hit loose ground and fell in, the rushing water flushing me against the boulder and knocking me out.

And they never questioned… and we never told the truth.

I think that was the one lie that didn’t eat Tess alive. And even to this day, she has far more to show for her well-developed reputation than I ever could. She shined her light from that point onward, peaking especially in high school.

You see, Tess was a popular all-star–everyone wanted to be her friend. I hate to say it, but I’d even go as far as to concur that she was perfect–head cheerleader, junior prom queen, dating the captain of the basketball team Floyd Knolls (a nice kid, but too meat-headed for my liking). He hasn’t been over to the house yet–hasn’t met our parents, but she introduced him to me plenty of times. They like to find private moments during recess hours to meet one-on-one in the schoolyard, at our local teen hang-out point *Joe’s Shack* (best milkshakes and burgers in the entire state of Georgia), and never spend a moment apart if they could help it. 

She wasn’t embarrassed of Floyd–she was just nervous to bring him around our family, or what was left of them. My mom hasn’t really been right since… well, she hasn’t been right since we were born, but it got progressively worse once the deaths started happening. She was diagnosed with a psychotic disorder when she was 19 years old, and since then she has been in extensive therapy and medical treatment. She was referred to a psychiatric facility not long after her diagnoses and was successfully discharged upon completion of her “in-patient terms of therapy”, on the premise that she would work extensively with collaborative care in both out-patient programs and the prescription of medication. Most days you can’t even tell that she’s sick… but sometimes, she has these… episodes. It’s hard to be around her when it happens, nevermind bringing anyone on the outside in. 

Most of the time she functions, though. She works two jobs. Whenever we asked why, she explained it away by stating that it was “good money” and that it “kept her busy”.

And my dad… My dad means well. He’s never made *me* feel this way, but Tess has always said that she had a bad feeling about him. Not just on a “God, Dad is so embarrassing–I literally cannot” line of thinking, but she’s outright said that sometimes She thought he had secrets of his own, and that he used our mom’s problems as some sort of a shield or a cloak to avoid the suspicions of others. There is, of course, no concrete proof of this and Dad has always been super chill. He let us do whatever we wanted, whenever we wanted and only really laid down the law when Mom wasn’t in the condition to do the disciplining. 

Tess would never stay in the same room as him; I personally didn’t mind and thought she was just crazy. It was a running joke that she was also slipping into the land of madness, following the white rabbit to find our mom. I was just giving her shit, though. After all, she felt “some type of way” about almost everyone but herself. Like I said–she would do no wrong.

Then, there was me–the quiet one, the one that would recluse into a sterile, dark background to deter myself from attention. My specialties were reading, writing, sketching, and enduring the annoyingly bright and resounding remarks regarding how I lacked heavily in matching my sister in competition. 

“You’re so quiet compared to Tess.”

“Your sister is super smoking; what happened to you?”

“Artsy, babe. Can you cheer like your big sis?”

“Big” sis. Only “big” by about eight minutes, but I supposed big nonetheless.

That was the extent of commentary on behalf of the both of us. Who I was was no match for Tess. I was “Terrie the Tedious” or “Creepy Terrie”, which had made me constantly reminisce–jokingly, of course–to the classic 1970s movie *“Carrie”*, but in reality our lives almost fit into the valley of uncanny, with the exception of one interesting and pivotal note: Carrie didn’t have a twin. 

Although if she did, I’m sure things would’ve still turned out the same for her.

Home life was pretty mundane. Maybe it was because our parents felt bad for my diluted right to thrive (socially, not academically. I had no issues in the latter area.), but I often noticed that my parents generally pretended like Tess wasn’t there. Maybe they felt like she got enough attention from her squad, her boyfriend, and the entire administrative board that she didn’t need a more-than-sufficient amount of it from her parents, too; alternatively, they probably felt like I needed my fair share, so they directed nearly all of it to me. 

At home, Tess was far more different than the sunshiney, head-high social butterfly that she was at school. She was far quieter than I ever thought possible, like she couldn’t figure out how to draw that energy for who she was there to who she was then. I used to internally mock her for it, almost gloatingly. “Not so special when you’re at home, huh?” Before I understood–before I recognized what was going on–I envied my sister. Not hated. Not shunned. Envied.

I was just glad that I got that break from somewhere.

Some big kick-back for Halloween was happening at one of the basketball player's houses, with lots of alcohol and loud music to boot. It wasn’t really my thing, so when Tess insisted on tagging along, I politely declined. I enjoyed my seclusion and my longing for the quiet, and after all I had an end-of-semester piece to work on that was due in the couple of weeks to follow and I was only half way done.

“Just for an hour or so and then you can come back and work on… whatever…” She gestured towards my park model for my architectural design class.

I rolled my eyes and moved it further from her, shielding it with my arms. “You know I hate parties, and Floyd’s buddies will be there and they give me the skeevs.”

“You’ve never even met them.”

“I have an inkling.” 

“Just for like one hour.”

I gave her a look of disbelief.

“Thirty minutes?” She attempted to negotiate.

I shook my head. “Go before you’re late.”

“I don’t want you here,” she mumbled under her breath.

“I’ll stay in my room all night and lock my door, if it makes you feel better.”

“It would make me feel even more better if you actually left. I don’t care where you go–just… don’t stay here.”

“Tess,” I shifted towards her in my seat. “You want what’s best for me, right? You want me to be safe?”

She didn’t respond, but swallowed roughly.

I continued. “So, you always win in the end. You know that. Everything will be fine.”

She smacked her lips apart to spread her shimmery lip gloss whilst telling me that I was a killjoy, a bummer and lectured that if I kept it up, I was going to graduate lonely with no friends to show for it and no one else but the three of them cheering her on. She also stated gently–albeit, firmly–that she was sometimes mortified to be associated with me on such a closely-knitted level considering we were so different from each other that it hurt. I dismissed her somewhat painful words as mere acts of frustration. She didn’t mean it. She never did. I felt like she was my harshest critic, but she just wanted what was best for me.

This, of course, didn’t alleviate the tension any more than I expected and she left in a huff, still cursing herself for even bothering to try. I let it go completely, continuing on with my project with ease. It wasn’t until I’d gotten a text from Floyd, who I allowed Tess to give my number to for *emergency cases only* that I was pulled from my focused trance.

*“Hey! Big kick back @ Nate’s. You coming?”*

I scoffed with humor. *“It’s not enough for my sister to just attend?”*

*“Well ya, but you should come 2.”*

I eyed the time at the top of my cell phone screen. 7:34.

*“I’m about to head to bed.”*

*“Whatevs. Suit urself.”*

I shrugged it off, plugging my phone on the charger and crawled into bed to enjoy my reasonably foreseen peaceful slumber.

I’d barely gotten a wink of it before my phone vibrated maniacally. My eyes fluttered open and it took them a second to adjust to the screen’s brightness before I could make out the caller ID, 9:45 PM time clock resting just above it.

It was Floyd.

I sighed deeply and pressed the phone to my ear.

“Floyd, I really don’t have time for this shit, I–”

“Terrie!? Don’t hang up, it’s urgent! Have you heard from your sister?”

“What?” I moaned confusingly, sitting up in bed. “No, not since she’s left, why?”

“I haven’t seen her at the party all night. I asked some of her friends if they’d seen her; they all said no. I don’t think she showed up at all.”

“Wait…” I started, but Floyd let me continue. 

“I went out to the backyard by the alleyway where all of the cars are parked, and I couldn’t find hers anywhere.”

“Maybe she just left early,” I tried to reassure him, but he rebuked.

“She was one of the first people who would’ve shown up. Party didn’t start until 9:00, and she texted me and told me she was almost here at 8:50.”

I flicked the call log up to view my phone’s background, tapping on the “Messages” icon and viewing the first few threads. I saw text exchanges between me and my mom, me and my dad…

Nothing from Tess. 

Nothing except for the last message I’d sent her that day, which clocked in at 6:16pm:

*“Do what you gotta do.”*

No response back.

I tapped her contact log and hit the “call” button, which automatically put Floyd on hold, and held the phone up to my ear. 

Ringing.

Ringing.

It seemed to go on forever before I heard a click. 

“Hello?” I said aloud, but heard a robotic voice on the other end.

*“I’m sorry, but the person you called is not available at this time–”*

*What the fuck?*

I abruptly hung up the phone, returning to Floyd’s call log consequently. I pressed my phone back to my ear. 

“Okay, this is really weird… Tess is always near her phone.”

“I’ve been calling and texting her… and she hasn’t responded,” I heard his voice quivering over the other end. “What if something happened to her?”

Even though a part of me denied anything ever could, I began to see Tess for the vulnerable girl that she was. It actually was quite easy for her to be a target–she wasn’t heavy, wasn’t big on self-defense, and she was the “ideal” damsel. I shook my head in disregard, flinging my blanket off of me and making my way to my closet to retrieve my sneakers.

“Okay, okay,” I told Floyd reassuringly. “I’m out of bed now. I’m gonna grab my car keys and try to sneak around my parents to go look for her. If she’s as predictable as I think, she would’ve taken the same route there that she always does.”

“Don’t you want to tell your parents what’s going on?” Floyd’s worried voice continued to trill over the other end.

“No, not yet. She probably just blew the party off to do something outlandish. She wouldn’t just disappear off the map like that, and I don’t want my parents jumping to conclusions. If she’s out there, I’ll find her along the way. I’ll drive to meet you and we can look together. We don’t find her, we go straight to my parents.”

“Okay… okay…” He answered with relief.

I didn’t give it another thought–or him another opportunity to speak–before I hung up the phone.

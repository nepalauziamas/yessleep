 I can't take this anymore. It's all gone.

Rent is due in an hour, all my money has vanished and Jack is... he's one of them now.

I won't become a monster. I can't. But I can't let those poor people be taken advantage off. The Smiths have to be put out of their misery. But I have to write down what I remember first. As evidence.

We did not apply for the jobs. We submitted our resumes all over the place, sure, but I don't recall seeing the name anywhere before.

It was supposed to be a simple night shift job: food delivery. Get order, get the food, deliver, come back, repeat. That's it. Use the weekly check for rent and the tips to cover everything else.

At that point we would've taken anything, so neither of us did much research. And Jack was... He was so relieved when we heard back from them.

He'd been struggling so much and I hated to see the lines of concern on his usually smiling mouth. If I got kicked out of the apartment, I could go home. My parents would be severely disappointed in me, but I had a place to sleep in. Jack had no one after- I don't want to get into that right now.

The company is called Late Night Cravings. They manufacture fresh and organic boxed meals that can be ordered and delivered to your house at any hour of the night, Monday to Sunday.

Too lazy to cook dinner? Craving something not available? Working late hours? Club party. New baby. Insomnia. Whatever the reason someone might want something, anything, to eat after 9 PM, Late Night Cravings was invented to satisfy it.

We got the call and went to the location on Monday at 8 PM as instructed. The headquarter is a gorgeous and narrow building with black windows and a neon sign the shape of a sandwich bitten in a corner. It has four floors and a wide parking lot with twenty cars in it for different purposes.

The guard didn't have a face. He was a blank and bald canvas of pure smooth skin with no nose or ears. He tipped his hat at us and gestured towards the revolving doors of the building.

At the time, this didn't faze me. Something in me had shut off the sense of what was normal and expected, making me smile and wave goodbye to the man like it was the most casual thing in the world.

Jack didn't. He looked back at the guy with a quizzical frown on his face, concentrating at what I now know as 'unreasonable fear'. The thing stared back at him, without the eyes to do that from.

"Did that guy seem... wrong to you?"

"The guard? Not really."

He shook his head, forgetting what he'd just asked as the receptionist got up from her spinning chair to greet us.

Her name was- I don't know. I don't know her name or what she looked except the fact that she appeared to be the personification of what you'd think a receptionist should look like. I think she had a bun and glasses, but I can't even trust my own head.

It all started so soon.

Before I knew it I was sitting down with my future mentor, my supervisor and the head of Human Resources. They gave me the usual talk about keeping my uniform clean, being nice to the customers and delivering the food on time.

"We're like a family here at LNC," the supervisor said. "We treat our employees well. That said, we do have some rules you have to follow, unless you want to get marked down. It's fairly routine stuff, I promise.

\-Always be in uniform, especially around the building. You don't want to be mistaken for an outsider.

\-We don't allow food that wasn't made by the company inside. But don't worry! Everything in the cafeteria is free of charge. Within reason of course.

\-Everything you see during a delivery that catches your eye must be written down on the order report. Peeping neighbors, garbage outside, maybe the road is in mid construction. Even if you think it as unimportant... Someone else is being paid to read it, so don't worry about it too much."

"I understand these might sound like aggressive stances and they absolutely are." The HR woman said. She wore a business casual suit and was at least on her early thirties. Her face looked sullen and stressed out. "Our company went through a sudden growth after settling a deal with Eastwest Studios in 2001, so a lot of our drivers are now swamped with bigger caterings. This meant that we needed to hire more people and quickly. And it led to some... bad decisions in the operational management area."

She looked down at me, her blue eyes frosty. She was easily seven feet tall and confined by the small desk she was sitting after. "I'm telling you this, so if you get any ideas, you know that these rules are here to protect you and not to, what did the other guy say?"

"Suffocate the expression of free will. Bro." my mentor, Kevin, answered, wiggling his eyebrows while trying not to smile.

"Yeah, he sure got suffocated all right. Do we have a deal, Mr. Harrow?"

"Sure."

One firm handshake later and I was out in the cold hallway, Kevin trailing behind me, patting my shoulders. "Don't take it personally. That interview is practically college hazing around here. I'll show you the place out. How about you try out the product so you know why those ladies have a stick up their asses?"

He led me down a maze of twists and turns, his voice and the whirring of fans harmonizing like a song repeated a million times. I couldn't tell what age he was, even if I tried, but he was dressed like a frat guy under the red jacket.

The dining hall was busy, loud and bright. If you didn't know better, it was a high school cafeteria at night for students that had failed their senior year for a decade.

Jack waived us over, his face stained with something. He was a messy eater. My mentor and his mentor did a convoluted handshake, ending it by slamming their foreheads together with a whoop. I didn't see Jack's eyes roll overdramatically to the back of his head, but I felt it. "You have to try this, dude. They have some good stuff here."

"And you headed straight for the candy section, didn't you?"

"The table name was Diabetes. Smart, isn't it? Anyway, there's a section called Breakfast for Dinner. Come fill up a plate with me."

Everything on the menu was black. Black bread, black waffles, black chicken, black soup, black sushi. All of it like a gothic preteen girl's dream birthday party. There was even black birthday cake. But whose birthday was it?

I noticed the small things at first. Sunny side up eggs with two yolks, teeth shaped marshmallow cereal, a platter of red raw steaks still dripping blood... I mean steak isn't even a breakfast food.

"Hey, look! The pizza cheese is shaped like a ghosts!"

He cut himself a big slice and showed me the funny pattern. Their eyes and mouths were made with diced olives and there were mushrooms cut to look like skulls to top off the look. Halloween Pizza, a small sticker said.

He leaned down to squint at the smaller writing. *All our products are made with organic ingredients!*

"Yeah, right," he scoffed. "The crust on this thing has so much food dye that they didn't need water to make the dough. It's good though."

"They're probably prepping for Halloween next month."

We sat down with our hills of blackberry and chocolate pancakes and dug in. They had an incredibly overwhelming sweetness to it, so much so that my teeth began to hurt with each bite. I had to push the half-finished plate aside, while Jack enjoyed the hell out of his. I'm surprised that he hasn't woken up from a sugar coma in a hospital yet.

He'd even grabbed a bowl of the teeth cereal, which he offered me by holding out a spoon with one hand and shoving a fist sided fruit into his mouth with the other. A stream of deep red juice dripped from his lips.

I traded it with a handkerchief, which he took gladly, wiping off his chin while I tried taking a spoonful from the bowl. It was... sugary. They were crunchy in that uncomfortable way that made it seem like your teeth were breaking inside your mouth.

"I think I'm too nervous to keep anything down, first day and all."

"Do you need a bathroom?"

"I need to wash my face."Â 

He groaned in sympathy, giving me a thumbs up. I kept my face as neutral as possible, but the moment I was out of sight I booked it toward the closest bathroom I'd seen. Bile rose up and splattered all over the sink, the fowl taste of vomit made ten times worse by that licorice aftertaste. I had developed an aversion to anything remotely sweet, fruity or artificial within thirty minutes, which I still struggle with today.

When it was all out, I felt ten pounds lighter. My mouth was in misery, cackling like a bonfire and I had sores on the tip of my tongue, but once my stomach was empty, a cold wave took over and my vision became focused again.

I chuckled a little to myself. Nerves. It was all just nerves. The pressure and stress were getting to me, but I could handle myself. It's just food delivery. Easiest job in the world.

I cleaned out the chunks off my half digested "dinner" and gargled tap water, spitting it out and checking my face in the mirror. I'd shaved in the morning, trying to make myself more presentable, but now I had razor burn along my jaw and it looked like I was about to hit puberty a second time.

I washed my face, slicked back my hair and fixed my shirt collar. Two more years, and Nathan Harrow will be a lawyer at a big firm, making the big bucks. And journalists will ask him how he got to where he is and he will tell them that he used to be so anxious at his first day as a delivery driver, he actually threw up! But now he has all this confidence.

The sound of wheels turning caught my attention. Someone from the cleaning staff was probably coming over to see the state of the toilets. I looked down and realized I'd left the uniform jacket hanging on the back of the cafeteria chair. I had no company id either. Would the janitor care if I wasn't up to standards though?

Probably not, but I didn't want to risk it. This job was too important and I couldn't make a bad impression on my first day.

I hid in a stall, locking the door behind me and sitting on the toilet. A person entered, their keys jingling with every motion they made. Something was sprayed and it was followed by a cloth polishing glass, possibly one of the mirrors. I was there for what felt like forever, before a knock came raining down at the first stall on the left. One, empty. Two, empty. Three...

"I'm sorry, this one is taken!"

"No problem. I can wait." The voice said. It was a mixture of gravel and molasses, slow and sticky, but weirdly deep at the same time.

It embarrasses me to say, but I put my palm over my lips and made and awkward farting noise. The jingling stopped. "Yeah, uhm, thanks, but I'll be here for a while."

The words trembled and came out awkwardly stilted, but there was a grunt on the other side of the flimsy wooden door. The janitor checked the final toilet and dragged his mop over the white tiles of the bathroom.

The hilariousness of the situation hit me just as I was about to get away with it. When the cleaner was about to take their first step outside the bathroom, I made the loudest, most vile fart noise I've ever made. Then I leaned over, palm still on my face, and tried not to wet myself while laughing in a toilet stall.

"Pig..." was the only thing I heard as they walked away.

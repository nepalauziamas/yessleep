  

*Move-number*  *seventeen…*

*Bishop takes pawn on h7*, Check!

*King takes Bishop*. Alright, now I just have to open up the king-side.

*Queen to h5,* Check!

I was playing with the white pieces on the winter-day in the local chess-club. My opponent was a much senior guy than me was also with an International Master title. As I was enjoying my position, he on the other hand was suffering from a mental suffocation caused by my picture-perfect bishop sacrifice which was extremely poisoned.

His King goes back to the g8 square. Here I come again baby, *Bishop takes pawn on g7!* My dark-squared Bishop jumped in front of his king.

He didn’t take the sacrifice this time. *F5,* pushes.

We played along…

*Move-number* *twenty-one…* Wait! Did he just gave away his Queen?

My dark-squared Bishop showed no mercy to his Queen on the b8 square.

The game continued….

*Move-number* *thirty-one*, I played: *Queen takes pawn on e6,* Check!

I have a Knight and a Rook and six pawns total along with my Queen versus his two Bishops and two Rooks and three pawns. He looked at with a pale smile after thinking for about three minutes.

*King to h8,* he pressed his side of the chess-clock.

With my fingers I moved my Queen to the e7 square taking control of the seventh rank also forking the Rook and the Bishop. So, it was in this position my poor opponent resigned the game.

We shook our hands. He complemented me.

A Queen can make the life so happy. Without a Queen you are most-likely to lose almost every battle of your life. I had Queen on that game where as my opponent didn’t.  I won the game on the board, but what about my real life?

Where is my Queen?

I lived alone in the apartment studying the boring game to pass time. Even though it’s my profession, it’s not like I love to play chess very much. Because it’s my only stand-pillar of my life I have no other choice. I don’t like to live with my mother. I live here separately.

But still I feel lonely. I am not exactly or cleanly alone here though. I have a pet-hamster in the small cage situated on the medium sized table beside my personal computer.

His name is- “Bishop”. Maybe he is my only friend in this world. Hamsters are not required to take care frequently. They don’t need to be cleaned or be taken outside for a walk. They just live their own life alone, nocturnal and when they feel energetic they run on their wheel bought by their owners.

Bishop also had a wheel like that. It depends on luck, whether he will reveal himself in the day-time and work-out on the wheel or not. But, that day was an exception. It was one of those rare days when he do so. I was watching him running on that wheel very fast.

I was a child-prodigy at the age of thirteen. Soon, I got my title after defeating a very strong grand-master at a young age. From that day I got paid and sponsored by authorities and private companies to visit various places to play the tournaments.

One large section of my book-shelf is wholly occupied and dominated by the trophies I won. But, none of these trophies can quench my physical-hunger or lust. I paid for sex multiple times. I love to drink Bourbon at every evening.

Deep in my heart, there lives a hopeless romantic-man living inside me without any nutrition. I do not have any companion with me in this apartment. For this, I’ve tried online-dating sites for the countless times. But, no relationship went far.

*Cling!*

It was the sound of the notification of my phone. I fired-up the screen without any excitement.

Another match found, she also messaged me.

Sigh! What number was that? It was no longer a feeling of joy anymore.

We decided to fix the date on the Friday night.

It was a very cold evening, when I took my car and drove the fixed place for the date. I parked my car in the appropriate parking lot and called her to notify that I had reached.

Finally, we met near a well-established coffee-shop. The dark hair with the tint of blue at the ends of her hair made me a patron immediately. Her eyes were also extremely vocal.

‘It is very nice to meet you, Pabla.’, I greeted.

‘Likewise.’, she replied.

We entered into the coffee-shop from the automatic door. We sat sporadically at a table near a closed window. I put off my Trilby on one side of the table.

‘How was your day?’, I asked.

‘It was good. How was your day?’

‘As usual. Nothing new. Actually I am a Chess-master and most of the time I spent my day playing at chess-club and studying the game at my apartment.’

‘That’s sounds cool. You must be a very intelligent guy!’

‘Huh, people always react like that when they hear about my job. What do you do?’

‘I have a crazy job compared to yours. I am a fortune teller.’

‘Sounds interesting.’

‘Do you believe in Zodiac signs and positions of the planets can determine our future?’

‘Not really but it sounds pretty interesting to be honest from you. You are the most beautiful woman I’ve ever seen.’, I confessed the truth.

She made the rain of pearls by smiling genlty with her beautiful corn-seed like teeth and velvel-red lips, ‘So you are not getting bored if I talk about these kind of stuffs?’

‘Not at all.’, I was totally gone missing in her mesmerizing eyes.

‘Will you mind if I try something here now on you?’

*Do anything you want, miss allurer.* I said in my mind.

‘Yes. Why not? But before that let me order something.’

I asked her and she gave me the choice of the order. I called the waiter and ordered two Lattes and non-veg sandwiches.

As the waiter was on her way, Pabla dragged the zipper of her leather-made vanity-bag. A plastic-made well-designed medium size lunch-box like thing made its way to the light by her beautiful milk-colored hands. She put the box on the table. Then, she grasped the top of the box and pushed up the upper lid of the case.

‘These are Tarot Cards. Drawing of these cards can foretell you future.’

‘Really? Show me how.’

She dumped the needlessly large deck of cards on her right-hand palm put turning the opened box upside down by her left hand. She couldn’t even handle the deck with her small hands. As she was trying to make a solid grasp of the thing I noticed a few faces of those cards. The back-design was not that exceptional. The backs were monotonous brown colored with white border around its four sides. The faces, which I noticed were consisted with the most disturbing, weird and nudity contained paintings all over them.

She continued to shuffle (even if she was not looking comfortable doing so) the deck of cards and made three almost similar heighted piled of cards in front of me.

‘Complete the cut by arranging these three piles, one on the another or under the others to make a single deck.’, she directed.

I took the right-pile upon the middle and then put the whole thing upon the left.

‘Perfect!’, she exclaimed. ‘Now you have to draw three individual cards from the top but if you want you can make a cut to the deck and chose the top-card of that cut-position. Once you draw the three cards, lay those in front of you without looking at the faces one-by-one from left to right.’

I drew three face-down cards from the top and laid them one at my right, one middle and one left.

‘Now, one-by-one we will reveal those cards and know the indication.’, she had a glance at those face-downed cards. ‘Turn over the first card. Let’s see what it says.’

I turned over the left-sided card revealing its face. The face contained a picture of an angel flying above a naked man and a naked woman. Also, the number six in Roman embossed by golden ink on the glossy texture of the card.

‘Lovers upright!’, she exclaimed. ‘It indicates good love-life and partnership.’

I turned the next card. A man was lying on the earth on his chest and swords pierced all over his back. This time, the Roman number was ten.

‘Ten of sword!’, she looked a bit down this time. ‘That indicates betrayal in the near future.’

Third card was a picture of grim-reaper but upside-downed. Numbered thirteen.

‘Death reversed.’, her facial expression remained same as the previous time. ‘That indicates destruction of hope, depression and negative outcome.’

Our order had been served on the table and we were talking and smiling. Swear to god, I had not felt that happiness ever in my life so far. She was like a goddess revealed herself to me to show the true definition on beauty and outstanding company. Even if the card-fortune telling part was completely bullshit to me, I couldn’t stop myself listening to her smooth voice.

*I want this woman at any cost in my life. But what if , these bull shit tarots* *and zodiacs made us separated? She might have so many matches on internet dating sites. What if this goes same as the previous ones for me? I don’t want to lose her.*

‘Can I drive you to your place? It has got pretty dark outside.’, I proposed.

She got inside my car after having a bit negotiation between us. I insisted her, she should ride with me no matter how politely she declines. My real motivation was to be with her as long as possible.

It was a two storey building and she lived with her mother. She offered me the dinner at her house in her room. I had no other choice.

Her book-shelf was packed with books on Demonology, Spirit-summoning, Astrology and other types of esoteric books. During the dinner, she was talking about Hebrew Bible and a King back in the history namely King Solomon. How that King could summon the Demons and made them work for his own benefit and stories like that did not really convince me to believe all those things but the only thing I enjoyed to my heart’s content, was her company.

Returning to my lonely apartment I was thinking about her and her talking imagery was all over my mind’s eye. I will only resort to those obnoxious stuffs if I ever get any difficulties in getting her in my life. I have dated several women in my life, but none of them was like her. I’ll do anything to get her in my life permanently.

I called her but her phone was busy. That made me a little tensed. Was she talking with another man? If so, I’ll kill the man.

She didn’t called me back on that night. *She could have talked with her relatives,* I tried to confront myself.

Next morning, I gave Bishop a small cup of mixture of seeds in his cage. He didn’t show up to light though. I drove my car to the chess-club.

When I was in a middle of a game I gazed to the window beside me. I saw a sight on the street which took over my whole concentration from the game. It was Pabla with another man. *That could be her brother or just a friend*, I tried to confront myself again. Either ways I lost that game, I couldn’t leave the place at that time. They were talking with big smiles on their faces. Pabla and the man boarded a Taxi outside. I lost the next rapid game too.

Returning to apartment, I couldn’t fix my mind. There was a Tornado inside my heart. We didn’t date for long, it was only once. So, if she dates another man it was completely fine. Then why am I feeling like this? Did she charm me with her Voodoo stuffs?

I couldn’t let her be with anyone else. She is mine! I’ll do whatever it takes to get her.

I called her in the afternoon. Luckily she picked up this time.

‘Hello.’, she greeted.

‘Hey, I called you last night.’, that came out instantly from me.

‘Yeah… But I was busy then.’

‘Can we meet this evening?’, as I was not in the position to ask for further explanations.

‘Sure, I am free in the evening.’

‘Actually, I am interested in your books. Can I have a closer look to those?’

‘Absolutely! I would like to be with a companion with common interests. I can also help you if you get some trouble reading those books. You can borrow those as I believe these kind of knowledge must be spread more.’

She invited me to her house that evening. I threw a glance to her book-shelf.

‘So you wanna look at my book collection?’, she asked.

‘Yeah. But I am really curious whether this kind of stuffs really work or not.’

‘That’s sound great! I got you covered. I have all kinds of spell-books and books on occult. My favorite kinds of books are about the demonology. Here, have a look!’, she was pointing at a certain section of the shelf. ‘Gerald B. Gardner has written a brilliant book on drawing of circles, Sabbat Rituals, and all kinds of black-magic. The name of the book is: “Book of Shadows”.  The books on summoning demons and drawing certain hexagrams are described in the book: “Key of Solomon”. If you seek more powerful elements–-’

‘I want to tell you something!’, I interrupted.

‘What?’

‘I… I really like you. I haven’t seen any woman like you. I don’t wanna casual dates anymore.’

‘We’ve just met each other. In order to form a strong relation between two souls, we need to know each other properly at first. That’ll take time. Sorry, I can’t commit that early. But, as you’ve taken interest in my likings, we can be good friends for now. We can discuss these stuffs together.’, she made me extremely disappointed. ‘So, I am curious why you have interest on occult in all of a sudden? Why do you seek the help of Demons?’

‘I am getting worse at controlling my concentration during the chess matches nowadays. I wanna summon some demons to make me a strong chess-player actually, may that sound funny to you.’

‘Not at all! The main purpose of summoning is to improve the life. Whatever flaw you have, the Demons can help you with everything. Demons are always more powerful than the Gods. But, you have to be very careful during the rituals. If something went wrong you’ll be in trouble.’

‘I am ok with that.’

She lend me a book that was in wretched condition. The first few pages along with its hard-cover were gone. As she explains, those pages was torn away intentionally to hide the name of the book and the author to other people as she had lent that book to several people.

I returned to my apartment after having a great dinner at Pabla’s place. Lying on my bed, I was turning-over the pages to find a ceremony to make someone fall in love with me. As I didn’t lied to her while borrowing this book, she was the reason of my poor performance of today at the chess-club, and as I needed recover my strength in chess, I had to make her fall for me sooner by the help of the Demons. It was not like I suddenly grew my interest to these kinds of stuffs all of a sudden, I just felt like it will be most effective. I’ve prayed to the God at the churches several times but that didn’t provided me any romantic partner.

Finally, I found a ritual instructions with some ancient language chants of my interest, in that book. The ritual requires a offer to the Demon in order to please him and make the ritual work for effects. The summoner must sacrifice another human or animals which the summoner is emotionally attached to. The stronger the attachment might be, the effect will be as stronger to that. 

I only got that nocturnal hamster named Bishop. He was the only thing I was attached to then. I closed my eyes and had deep thoughts for a moment. I got up from my bed with the book in my right-hand. It was almost 3am at the night.

I entered into my study-room. There was some squawking and scratching sounds coming from the table in the dark. I lightened-up the room. The little animal was in motion in his cage. 

I put on a leather glove on my left-hand, putting down the book on the table. Pulling the lid off the cage, I discovered Bishop had stopped and staring up at me with his curious eyes as my shadow was on him. I gripped him with my leather-claws. 

I drew the Hexagram in the Circle on the floor with the red and black marker-pens with my right-hand. I lightened white candles, four in number at the four sides of it. Then, I turned off the lights.

I knelt near the circle. In the right, I gripped an Exacto-knife pointing its blade to Bishop’s throat, held in my left-clutch. 

Bishop gave me his expression of eyes with, ‘Don’t do this to me, please.’ Look. I pierced him with my shaking hands. Bishop made a squanching sound and my left hand dripped a miniature of blood-river. I threw the corpse on the hexagram. 

The ritual needed my blood too, as I dripped few drops from my right-hand-pinky. I began to chant those Latin Words from the book, touching the circle with both the tips of my hands.  

Suddenly, the candles extinguished without any wind, turning the room into an abyss. The furniture started to shake like it happens during earthquake. I kept chanting and sweating. I couldn’t see the book but Latin came out of my mouth flawlessly in the dark. I meditated picturing Pabla closing my eyes. I felt the presence of entities in the room.

My mouth stopped. The shaking of the elements was stunted. I somehow managed to get out by thrusting my palms in the dark like a blind man, so that I don’t collide with items in the room.

I woke up late next morning. I decided to check the study-room. Bishop’s corpse wasn’t there. I wiped off the the hexagram from the floor and placed the candles in my drawer. There were no blood-marks on it.

I took a shower and was having my meal and my phone rang. It was Pabla! I Picked up the call and she wanted to meet me tonight. What a magic! Did that really worked?

She called me again while I was driving to the chess-club. She wanted to meet me in the afternoon as she wanted to confess me something. 

We met in the daylight at the park. She was wearing a long-coat and that looked extremely gorgeous on her. 

‘I shouldn’t be that cocky last night’, she said. ‘The truth is, I am very fond of you. I missed you very much at the night. I’ll like to be with you.’

My head started flying, my heart was beating heavily and there were butterflies in my stomach.

That was the happiest day of my life. My chess has improved very much and my accuracy was beyond any human’s. Every move I played was the top-recommended move by the chess-engine in the computer.

One day she came into my apartment with me. She was curious about the cage on that table but I managed to come up with a lie that my pet has died due to illness. 

She talked about occult and my experience with the book. As my performance on the board was top-notch, it was not very difficult for me to explain how effective was it for me.

My nights began to shine with her. All of a sudden my Black and White life became colourful greatly. I was at my prime in both professional and private lives. People started to praise me at the club. I stopped studying the game. Tactics and strategies came to my mind automatically to the only destination of victory, either by check-mate or resignation. 

Days past and we lived together in my place. The apartment was not a dungeon for me anymore as it became a true joyful place for my heart. But, that didn’t last for long.

I heard her talking to some other man on the phone and lied to me when I asked, ‘I was talking with my mother.’

That day I made the worst blunders on the board. An amateur kid could defeat me in the squares. My King was suffocated by opponents’ pieces. 

Returning to my apartment-doors I saw pair of boots of man. Pushing the entrance-door hard, I growled with rage and agony, ‘Pablaaaa!!’ 

There was no answer. Unnatural silence fled across the Dark interior. I entered into the bed-room and discovered the abomination by the striped light coming from the door-slit.

Pabla was with another man and both were naked. Which was more frightening than that, they were both dead as I could easily tell by looking at the corpses. They were in a collapsed missionary position on the bed. Blood was dripping from the bed-sheet. That blood-stream made a lake in the floor. Her dead-eyes and mouth were wide opened to make an evidence that a great horror caused them this state. 

The cause of death was much more terrifying than that. Their throats were equally stabbed, bruised and brutally cut wide open like opened jaws. That was the main source of the stream. 

My head was totally blanked. I was loosing the lights of my eyes. I did not made any scream but continued to suffer the mental storm inside my stomach. 

Not enough was my inner-pain, the disgusting smell of the corpses and intolerable smell of rotten flesh was also present there. It was the most suffocating and disturbing situation I ever experienced in my life.  

*Why this happened? Did I made any mistake while performing the ritual?* *This looks like a murder but who and how can someone murder them at this state like that?* 

I was asking myself more than a thousands of questions but suddenly, I heard a very familiar but more louder squawking and scratching sounds from a little distance. I saw something in the dark was revealing its existence by making the noise. It was in motion, sitting in one place not moving much. 

I tried to light up the room but the switch was already in on-state. I clicked the switch on and off but the lights didn’t worked.

Then I discovered the blazing red eyes of the creature rounded and glowing in the dark. It’s body was fat and almost the size of two huge balls but one larger than the other, if placed the smaller one on the top area of the other. 

It’s facial area more revealed and my mouth said automatically, ‘Bishop!’

Tears in my eyes and the body was shaking by fear and sorrowness. Bishop had become a horrific mammal monstrosity. His fur was not as clean and bright as when he was alive in his cute and natural form.  The milky white mane and patches of orange on it had turned into dusty grey and pale brown in colour.

Then, I saw blood dripping out of his mouth area as he tried to lick that with his peeping small tongue under the nose. His whiskers were also consisted of tiny drops of blood just like the surgical syringe needles drip drug out of it to test the barrelled liquid by pushing of plunger. 

Once he looked upwards at the ceiling revealing its old wound across his throat area. There was no blood on that wound though, but it made a nasty imperfection to his body. 

It remained to the corner of the room, looking at me menacingly but did not cause any harm to me. I don’t know how long was I trembled there standing. 

I sweated making my clothes absolutely soaked badly. I approached the monster but it remained at its place. I called it by its mortal name but did not get any responses. 

I brought out my bottle of Bourbon. Poured directly from bottle in my mouth, a relatively large quantity. Didn’t make any burn on my palate. 

I smiled looking at Bishop. My eyes were also red but different than the Bishop’s. I cried silently. Poured a bit more into me. Then a strange thought flashed into my mind.

I can still repeat the ritual and get another woman. But this time, the sacrificed offerings will be an attractive naked lady who had much stronger but invisible attachment strings to me. 

That man’s body fell on the blood-lake due to my intervention in the life-less bed. I picked her body on my shoulder and went to the study-room.

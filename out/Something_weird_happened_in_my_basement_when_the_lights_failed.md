First of all, I wanna apologize for the possible grammatical errors bc English is not my first language but I needed to share this story bc if I keep it to myself any more time I think I'm going to lose it.

To start let me tell you a little of history. 5 years ago I met Aaron, he was like the perfect guy, the popular one who plays basket on the uni team. Long story short, we met, we fell in love, and then got married 2 years ago. 

He is a computer science engineer and I am a nurse, so our salaries are pretty decent and we have been saving to buy a house in the neighborhood we’ve always wanted.

Two months ago we found this big house at a very low price and we thought that it was our signal to buy it, so without thinking a lot we bought it and moved, all in 3 weeks. At first, it was all good, our families loved it and we were super happy, till one day something really weird happened.

I was just chilling on the couch after a long shift when the lights started to fail, I called Aaron and asked him to go to the basement to check the controls, he went and didn’t come up for 3 hours.

To be honest, at the moment I just called him and when he didn't answer I just thought that he was fixing the problem so I let it be. I know that some of you are going to think that I was dumb for not going down but the truth is that I am afraid of basements.

When I was little I used to get locked in the basement as a punishment for my “bad” grades, so I really hate those places.

Returning to the matter, when Aaron came back he was acting weird and had red eyes so I went to him and asked what happened down there but he just stared at me and then went upstairs, I caught that it was a signal for me to follow him so I did.

When we arrived at the room, he locked the door, turned around, and looked at me. I swear, he had a look of absolute terror and said to me quietly

“I don't know what just happened, I just know that there is something down there and it wants us dead”

I laughed bc obviously I thought it was a joke but he remained serious.

We looked at each other for at least 5 minutes without saying a thing when the lights started to fail again, and this is when this turns weird bc Aaron just busted out laughing and said

“You should have seem your face, you were TERRIFIED” 

And then just went into the bathroom.

Anyone would think that it was just some kind of joke but the thing is that when Aaron started laughing he had something in his eyes.

I know I know

I sound like a crazy person just seeing things but I'm serious

Later that day, I was cooking dinner when my husband appeared and asked what have I done for dinner. I looked at him right in the eye and told him that he knows I never cook because the last time I tried I almost burned the house so he literally told me that from that moment I had prohibited to cook. Aaron looked at me and then said

“Right, I forgot, let me cook”

At that moment I knew that something was really wrong because he never forgets that detail, he literally tells me every morning

“don't you dare burn my kitchen today”

EVERY-FUCKING-DAY he says the same damn thing, even when he is mad at me or if he has a lot of things to do. this routine of him reminding me that I can’t cook is something that has been happening for 3 years, so no, I don't buy it.

I went upstairs, did all my things and went to bed, and fell asleep.

It was 3.30 when I heard something crash in the kitchen.

I woke up and looked beside me but Aaron wasn’t there, and the sheets were untouched so I guessed he didn't go to bed earlier.

I got up and went out of my room but stayed there because I was a little more than afraid that someone had broken into our house, but then I heard someone crying and it sounded like my husband so I rushed downstairs and saw him sitting on the couch with his hands on his head and mumbling something I couldn’t understand.

I called him and he turned his head sharply and said

“What are you doing here?”

“I heard something crash and then someone crying so I came to see what happened”

“Nothing happened, go back to sleep”

“No”

He stared

Like really stared 

I stood there still because something was happening

He blinked 

Blinked

Again and again

Just looking at me for 3 straight minutes

And then his face changed completely 

He passed from being completely blank to having an expression of pure horror and pain, Then told me

“Mara, I need you to leave this house because something is happening to me and I have this pure want to kill you”

I didn't know if he was joking but I thought it was a really awful thing to joke about so I turned around and run out of the house.

When I was out of the house I heard something crashing inside the house and then a shot.

I was in shock

Didn't know what just happened so I called the police and said that I thought that someone had broken into our house and that I needed them to come as soon as possible because my husband was still inside with the intruder.

I don't know why I said that if I knew there was no one inside, I just needed someone to come.

When the police arrived they told me to stay outside while they went in to take a look so I did exactly as they told me.

Minutes later an officer came out and told me that it all seemed normal and that I must have hallucinated it
I know I didn't

Then my “husband” came out and looked at me with a blank expression and said 

“come in honey, it was just a nightmare”

He never, not even once, had called me honey, we both hated that nickname.

He took my hand and practically dragged me into that house, and the police didn’t do a thing because they thought I was having a psychotic attack or some shit like that.

I'm not sure what happened next

To be honest I don’t remember a lot after I entered the house

The only thing I know is that there are days when I don’t remember going out of bed but then someone tells me something I did that day. Or I find dirty clothes around the floor that I don’t remember using.

The same thing happens with Aaron.

Days that we just seem to forget completely.

One day I was recollecting dirty clothes around the house when I found a weird red mark on my favorite shirt.

I'm really afraid that I did something that I don't remember and I don't know what to do.

If I say something I may end up in a psychiatric hospital. But if I don't, I think I’ll lose it and end up killing myself to stop this anxiety that keeps me awake most nights because I know that when I fall asleep I'm going to forget what happened the other day

Society has an odd relationship with mental health these days. One day, it may be touting how we all need to “understand our struggles” and “love each other,” and then the next day it berates you for the social crime of having a nervous breakdown. Then us, the people who get caught in between a rock and a hard place, are left feeling abandoned and wanting *to* abandon. 

That’s essentially where I was the day I finally took off. As soon as I had sent that last email out to my supervisor and professors, hugged my parents and brother goodbye, and the tires of my little box of a car met the county line, I finally felt the first vestiges of the anxiety, depression, and hypomania begin to dissipate for the first time in…hell, more than a year. 

It was not the work, not really. I truly cared for my clients, each and every one of them. I was – if you’ll indulge me just a little – a damn fine clinician, even for one in training. The therapeutic connection we each made during each session, no matter how that session went, was quite literally the only aspect of my professional (and to some extent, personal) life that was not actively sending me into a burnout-fueled spiral to the Tartarus of my mind. When it came to that aspect, accolades often followed suit. I don’t say this to brag at all, but to give you a picture of how I even ended up in this insane situation.

Nah. You know how some well-meaning goofs in their first-ever job interviews say that their biggest problem was that they simply “care too much”? Well, shoot, if that wasn’t precisely what happened with me.

But it was not quite what you might be imagining. Counter-transference is a dangerous, all-too-real deal and some of us can handle it, while others simply cannot. It took me nearly a year to admit to myself that I fell in the latter category, though the sense of freedom when all was laid bare was second only to actually leaving. I was burnt out and broken down.

Anyways. That’s what brought me here, holed up at the best motel – also the only motel – in a small Pennsylvania town with a shotgun and holy oil at my side. The moon shadow is keeping me safe on this clear night, so at the very least something up above has allowed me the chance to tell you all what’s lurking out on those lonely county roads. 

It began a couple of weeks ago. I had been on the road just for just short of a week at this point, driving through eastern Kentucky on the first leg of my half-planned spirit journey, eager at the opportunity to lose myself in the satin-teal colored wilderness. My eyes were glued to the dew-dampened pavement, but my mind was…outside of itself. At least, that’s what it felt like. 

The evening redness of the setting sun danced and tickled its way through the canopic forest on either side of my thin stretch of road, and as I glanced sporadically into the old land around me I could have *sworn* I heard whisperings coming from somewhere deep within those woods. With no other cars or trucks around me, I made a decidedly foolish choice born of some combination of feeling numbed to any more bullshit and sheer curiosity.

I pulled over on the shoulder and exited my car. 

Maybe it was because the ethereal whispers had begun sounding familiar. Hell, I would swear even now that a few of them were those of friends who have passed, people who I had seen buried, had grieved for. 

Yet, they were there all the same, urging me onwards even as I tried in vain to resist their calls. 

Had I been whole, or at least less shattered, perhaps I would have caught myself then and there. I wasn’t afraid, but neither was I thinking. My mind felt hazy. Not brain fog, but something more invasive, pulling me further from the safety of my car and deeper into the forest. 

I remember walking on some ancient game trail, the soft underbelly of the temperate rainforest muffling my robotic movement forward. I remember the whispers building in a gradual intensity, to the point where I found myself talking gibberish in a vain attempt to deny them. 

Then, the forest erupted with a thunderous bellow that sounded to my pained ears as some unearthly blend of a foghorn and Japanese kaiju. I remember screaming first, trying like a madman to block that terrible sound out before being utterly blinded to the point of rigidity by a searing blast of blue-white light. The trees -- hell, the entire forest -- was gone from my sight, replaced utterly by fantastical swirls of superintense greens, purples, blues, and colors that should never have been and never were. 

Accompanying that strange bioluminescence was a sensation akin to taking a swan dive off of a sheer cliff. The hot wind was blasting across my body – *but wasn’t it a calm and cool night?* – and I recall madly thinking that this was probably how birds and suicidal jumpers felt. 

With an abrupt, horrifying understanding, I finally realized that instead of falling, I was instead steadily floating up, up, *up* to the very tip of the tree line.

These sensations increased in perfect harmony with the whispers, which at this point were as close and intimate as a lover. Instead of a soothing embrace, I felt a crushing dread as never before in my existence. 

I felt as if I were simultaneously dying and being reborn, brutally, over and over again for beyond eternity, and that I was finitely doomed to this purgatory for my unforgivable sins and failures. All the while that tumultuous roaring continued in its horrible monotone as I soared upwards in the empyrean light’s grasp. 

Try as I might, I found my body wholly unresponsive to any of my attempts at freeing itself, regardless of how strained my efforts were. That strange and awful light with its mess of cobalts and violets and jades had me in its cocooning grasp. I roared back at the strange conical light and horrible bellowing in pure defiance, in so much pain that all I wanted in that singular moment was for it to end. No matter what that looked like.

Then I blinked again, and found myself standing next to my car once more. Just as I had been before those first steps of my spontaneous little night hike. 

Unfortunately, any comfort I had found at suddenly being freed from that nightmare – for it *had* to have been some waking psychotic break, right? – was replaced with another shot of fear as I realized that, instead of being parked on the side of a lonely woodland road in the middle of objectively nowhere, both myself and my car were now standing in a gas station lot at the edge of a dimly lit town. 

The magenta neon of the BEER HERE sign basked us in its gaze. To my right were a quartet of pumps, standing their vigil under a grouping of faded yellowing light bulbs, while to my left leaned a leather-jacketed woman in dark sunglasses mindfully gazing at the night’s sky between drags of her cigarette.

My mind was still in that strange, swoony fugue, yet I was regaining enough wits to check out my surroundings. I also found my body wracked with exhaustion that I felt straight through to my very bones, and I knew for damn certain at least that it was not born from driving. 

Of course, I was also quite concerned as to precisely *how* I ended up wherever I did. My logical brain was trying like hell to convince my lizard brain that this was explained by some sort of psychological relieving of built-up stressors. Stranger things have happened after all.

I blinked in rapid succession a few more times, partly to help refocus on my surroundings and partly just to see if I would suddenly find myself in a new part of the country with each reopening of my eyes. God apparently saw fit to spare me that at least, so I turned my attention to the only other apparent human being still awake in this town. 

“‘Scuse me, sorry, this is gonna sound weird…” I began asking the young woman.

She looked about my age, a few years younger, but it was hard to tell for sure with her vantablack shades hiding her eyes. Her cropped and bobbed hair was nearly as dark as her sunglasses, aside from a single bold streak of ultraviolet. As I started talking, she craned her neck with only the slightest movement to look at me, giving me a practiced smirk that would make anyone stop dead. 

While she was admittedly quite striking (of course I’ve always been a sucker for women in cropped leather jackets), especially the way the shitty neon bounced off of her alabaster features, I again internally smacked myself out of it and returned to what I had been trying to say.

“Oof, don’t know what happened there. Been a long day,” I said. 

In response, the woman’s smirk went wider and she shrugged her shoulders as if to say, “*Yeah no shit dude you look like you just ran out of the woods, and smell like it too.”*

“Anyways yeah this is gonna sound weird, but I think I had some sort of, eh, mental brownout or something ya know? Last thing I recall is driving down the interstate, trying to get through the Green River area when, shit, I got sucked into this fucking crazy blue-green-violet beam of light and...uh, yeah…” 

I stopped myself short of giving her the full, existentially terrifying image of what happened to me. Partly because I still didn’t, or couldn’t, comprehend it myself. The leather-clad woman continued to hold her pose, wisps of smoke and clumps of ash gathering around her. At this point, I really couldn’t care less what quirks this stranger had as long as she gave me something to work with. 

“So yeah uh, heh, where the hell *am* I, guess I’m trying to ask,” I finally got out. 

God but I almost wish she had never answered. Then again, if she did not, it is very likely that I would be in far greater danger.

Instead, the woman straightened from her casual lean, and with a coolness my awkward self could never hope to match dipped her sunglasses below her eyes, revealing a pair of swirling orbs that seemed to hold the mysteries of the universe themselves. At a layman’s glance, one might mistake them for just an odd shade of turquoise eyes with maybe a hint of purple if the light caught them fight, but I held no doubt in my mind that those galactic peepers of hers had enraptured many a soul’s undivided attention.

“Well, I do indeed have *some* answers you seek,” she finally spoke in a singsong voice that belied her appearance.

“However, I quite doubt you will be satisfied with these answers alone,” she finished.

I was frazzled enough to be forward for once in my life. I was unsure if she was speaking in riddles intentionally or if something was indeed cognitively off with me.

“Lay it on me, then,” I said.

The woman dug her cigarette into the wall of the small c-store, gazing me over once more with those foreign eyes. For the first time since she began staring me down, her smirk faded and in its place gave me a pitying frown. 

“As you wish. Fortunate for you then that you ran into me out of everyone in this place, though it *is* unfortunate that you…” she said, trailing off.

A twisting gutshot of anxiety formed within me at her words. As if I had known all along, yet the incomprehensible nature of it being so blocked my psyche from realizing the truth.

“Yeah? Unfortunate for me *what*?”

Those cosmic eyes flashed at me. 

“I’m sorry to say, but you’re not in Kentucky anymore.”

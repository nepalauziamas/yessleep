    The desert is a cruel mistress who beckons to those lost. It may not be the most hospitable place but that's what makes an oasis such a sight for sore eyes. Who in their right mind would build in these desolate places? Only those that understand the allure of the escape. On this fateful night one woman does find her escape but it just might not be the one she intended on. Strange things happen on those long strips of highway between the living and the dead.


Amanda was on her way to a friend's Halloween party. It had been awhile since they had seen each other. The trip to her friend's house was through the desert so it was quite a drive from LA. Unbeknownst to Amanda though she was already heading in the wrong direction. She was lost and her destination was unknown but something was calling her. Like a dried up siren beckoning her to come further in. She wouldn’t be the first nor would she be the last victim of this cruel fate. Once this place has you it never lets go. 


CLUNK


“Oh god, please not now!” Amanda bellowed as the sound of her car's engine began to make strange sounds and smoke began to billow from out from under the hood. She pulled to the side of the road as black smoke rose in the air. Her car was dead. She tried to call roadside service but no luck. They told her that there was a five mile walk to a gas station. She decided she would walk. 


Her trip out there to see her friend of course would end up like this.    She had been walking for what felt like forever. Her phone's battery was dwindling with each step taking her further into the desert. Soon she heard something rumbling down the long stretch of road behind her. Amanda turned to see an old police car. The cop car turned on its ancient red lights and pulled behind her. 


“Are you okay? You really shouldn’t be walking alone like that out here.”, the Sheriff said as he got out of his squad car.


“My car died and I am trying to get to the closest service station.”


“Well I hate to be the bearer of bad news but that service station you are looking for closed about 30 minutes ago. Not much open around here besides the Tiki Resort. I am sure they wouldn’t mind getting you a room for the night.”


    Amanda trustingly got in the car as he drovevdown the road. Night began to take hold of the landscape and she could see lights shining from a roadside motel. Uncle John's Tiki Resort emblazoned on a neon sign. 


“Just tell the clerk that the Sheriff said to put you on his tab. Uncle John owes me.”


    The Sheriff dropped her off at the office and Amanda entered what felt like a time capsule. It looked like nothing had changed in this place since the 60’s. She went inside and began to talk to the clerk who helped her get a room for the night. 


“I hope you enjoy your stay here. If you want to stretch your legs a bit there is a Halloween party going on in the lounge. I am sure if you entered the costume contest you would win in a heartbeat.”, the clerk smirked as he handed her the key. She had spent a good bit of money on a Cleopatra costume for the party. Might as well get some use out of it. She slipped on the costume and took the elevator to the lounge. 


The lounge was filled with about 30 people all in various costumes. Amanda saw a sign up list for the contest and decided why not. That night she danced, sang and drank with the patrons of the lounge. For the first time in a long time she was having fun. Soon the clerk from earlier got up on the stage.


“And the winner of the costume contest is …...Cleopatra.”


The whole lounge erupted in applause. Amanda made her way onto the stage to accept the prize. She felt like the belle of the ball. 


“Your award, a permanent residence here at Uncle John’s Tiki Resort”, the clerk said as those in the lounge continued to clap and cheer. 


She didn’t truly understand what that meant but was too enamored by the crowd. That was until she saw someone strange standing in the middle of the lounge. Everyone around this man looked like they had stepped right out of the 1960’s but this man was decked out in cameras and strange tech she had never seen.


“Are there any spirits here among us?”, the strange man said.


Not a single person noticed except for Amanda. 


“If you touch the device in my hands it will let me know there is a spirit here.”, the man said as he moved towards Amanda on the stage. 


She walked closer to him and she could see the device lighting up red. He pointed a camera at Amanda and a flash went off. He looked down at the photo and his face turned pale. The strange man trembling stumbled and made his way out the exit. Amanda followed close behind him.


“See guys I told you this abandoned motel was haunted!”, the stranger yelled as he made his way to two others wearing similar gear.


“Look at this photo I got. It's proof. It’s the famous white lady of Uncle John’s Tiki Resort.” 


Amanda looked behind the group and could soon see what he photographed. A white mist in the shape of Amanda surrounded by an empty dilapidated dead lounge. 


She felt a hand touch her on the shoulder.


“It’s alright, mam. You have a permanent residence here now,”, Amanda turned to see the clerk smiling, ushering her back into Uncle John’s Tiki Resort.

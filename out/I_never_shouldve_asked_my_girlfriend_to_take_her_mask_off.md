I haven’t had a real girlfriend in years, but I recently started dating Allison, the new barista at my usual coffee place. I found myself getting lonely while everyone’s staying at home and she always managed to brighten my mornings. She memorized my order within just a few days and seemed genuinely interested in me. Eventually I did feel like she was flirting with me, but I wasn’t going to make the first move – chatting customers up is part of her job, and I didn’t want to make her uncomfortable.

You can probably imagine how excited I was, then, when she wrote her number on the side of my cup almost a month ago. I waited until later that night to text her, and since then we’ve been talking non-stop. I liked her so much that it was only about a week in when I asked her to be my girlfriend. I was nervous she’d think it was too quick, that she’d say no, but we made it official that day.

I was pretty stoked – I mean, she’s beautiful, sweet, and funny – so I texted my best friend Alex immediately afterwards. He called me up on Facetime a few minutes later laughing so hard he’d gone completely red. Apparently, he’d been talking to her himself a couple months ago… but nothing had really come of it. He said he’d support me, but warned me to be careful with Allison because, *she’s crazy, man!!*

I brushed him off, though, because he has a nasty habit of calling all of his exes crazy while failing to recognize his own issues – being a serial cheater, to name one. I feel like, if *all* of your exes are crazy, at a certain point you need to look at the common denominator in your relationships – *you.*

Honestly, I did eventually start to see what he was saying about her. I already mentioned that Allison is beautiful, but I couldn’t *really* be sure of that for a while. Up until last night, I’d never seen her without her mask off, and – at the risk of coming off as totally shallow – I was a little wary of that. When half of someone’s face is completely covered, you never really know what you’re in for. For all I knew, maybe her teeth were all fucked up or something.

Allison seemed a little *too* paranoid about keeping her mask on. Maybe she had something to hide.

Before you all come at me for this, let me make one thing clear: I would *never* expect her to take her mask off in an unsafe situation. I understand why she’d want to stay masked whenever we go out in public together. All of our dates are as safe as possible – we go to the park, mostly, with our masks on and six feet apart. She said that working during a pandemic is enough of a risk, especially because her mother is unwell and needs help sometimes.

Again, I completely understand, but it struck me as odd that she’d always have her mask on, even when we’d just be exchanging selfies from our respective houses. I rationalized that one away, too, because masked selfies are kind of the “cute” thing these days. Like a new Snapchat filter. The whole situation made me feel uneasy… we hadn’t even kissed. But I liked her – a lot – so I figured she was worth it.

It seemed like she was starting to let her guard down a couple weeks ago when she started talking about maybe inviting me to her house. I decided not to push her, not wanting to freak her out by being too eager. Instead, I took some initiative and upped my quarantine game. After two weeks had passed, I asked her yesterday if she’d be willing to meet up at one of our places.

I was ecstatic when I got her reply, an excited “yes!” with her address and a time to come by later that evening. I went about the rest of my day anxious she’d change her mind, but the “I’m sorry, but…” text didn’t come. I was finally going to get a real chance to ask Allison to take off her mask, and I couldn’t believe my luck.

Now, I feel lucky just to be alive.

Anxious, I left my house way too early and had to slow my pace just so I wouldn’t show up there *too* early. I knocked on her door and she appeared at the doorway – masked, of course – and let me in. I followed her down the hall past her roommate’s room, then into her room. She sat cross-legged on her bed before inviting me to sit beside her by patting the duvet.

I sat down on the bed awkwardly. I was suddenly very, very nervous – I hadn’t been alone with a girl in her bed in… well, I couldn’t remember how long. This year has been terribly long, and I never really had luck with girls before all of this anyway. The anxiety-sweats started to set in, and I hoped she wouldn’t notice, or that at least she wouldn’t point it out and laugh.

Thankfully, she didn’t… we actually had a phenomenal time. We talked for at least an hour, chuckling over stupid jokes and the occasional thump and moan coming from the next room, barely concealed by the thin walls of her apartment. Allison coyly remarked that her roommate certainly hadn’t let quarantine slow her love life down and I laughed even more.

Everything was going so well – it seemed like the right time to ask if we could unmask at last.

She tensed up almost immediately.

I could tell she was nervous, so I rushed to soothe her. “No pressure, babe, we don’t have to… but I promise I haven’t left my house in two weeks, we’ve been so safe this whole time.”

“No, I know… you even got your coffee delivered instead of coming in to see me,” Allison admitted. She giggled a bit, her shoulders relaxing. “You first, though.”

I nodded enthusiastically before practically tearing my mask off. “See? Everything’s okay.”

Even though I couldn’t see it from behind her black mask, I knew that she was smiling… her bright green eyes squinted ever so slightly as soon as I took my own mask off. I smiled in return, trying to make her feel safe and comfortable.

Allison took a deep breath as timid hands moved to the sides of her face. Slowly, she pulled the loops of her mask back from behind her ears. I held my breath in anticipation as she eased the fabric covering off of her face.

As soon as I saw her face, I was at a loss for words.

She looked to me, anxious, searching for the response I was physically incapable of giving at that moment. Throwing her hands over her face, she turned away from me, hiding.

I leaned forward to take her forearms in a gentle grasp, guiding her hands away from her face, then holding them in mine. “You’re even more beautiful than I thought.”

A slow smile spread across her face, nearly splitting it in two.

I was being honest – Allison *was* the most beautiful girl I’d ever seen. I’d known she was beautiful before, but I struggle to explain the absolute *perfection* of her face when observed all together. Her lips were full and pink, her skin was like polished porcelain, her smile was absolutely flawless, framed by a pair of adorable dimples.

In that moment, I couldn’t imagine what she could have possibly been so worried about.

We talked for a little while longer, and before long I knew I had to kiss her. I would’ve hated myself if I didn’t make the next move. Like I said, I’m not great with girls, so I kept stalling, kept doubting myself… eventually, I decided to just ask her if I could kiss her. I ended up asking her where the restroom was instead.

Stepping out of the room, I buried my face in my hands, chiding myself for being such a wimp. I found the bathroom, then ran the tap so I could splash some water on my face. I gave myself a quick pep talk as I stared myself down in the mirror – *get your shit together, man.*

My anxiety had only continued to escalate… so, too, had the rate of my sweating. Even though Allison hadn’t mentioned anything, I was *sure* I must’ve smelled like shit. I’m not proud of this, but I started rifling through her bathroom for anything I could use to make myself more appealing before I got even closer to her.

I was surprised by just how bare the drawers under her sink were; most girls I know have an endless supply of beauty products. I struggled to find anything, though, until I kneeled down to open the bottom cabinet. It was full of stuff, but nothing like what I was expecting. There was a collection of random objects – watches, hats, masks, even a wallet – and they all looked like *men’s* things.

The one thing that really caught my eye, though, was a silver watch right at the front. The last time I Facetimed with Alex, he showed off the exact same one. Nervously, I picked it up, turning it over in my hands to reveal the one thing I didn’t want to see – Alex’s name, engraved on the bottom.

*Damn it.*

My worst fears had been confirmed – Allison was still seeing Alex, maybe still seeing a lot of other guys. She was cheating on me.

Fuming, I stormed out of the bathroom, slamming the door on my way out. I didn’t even care that I’d left my mask in Allison’s room. I didn’t want to see her, I didn’t care to talk to her at all. Alex had been in her house since we started dating… and I knew what he was like. I’d seen what I’d seen, and it proved my worst fears without a doubt.

I pulled my phone from my pocket, hands fumbling to find Alex in my contacts. I called him – no response. *Classic Alex,* I thought. This wasn’t the first time something like this had happened, and he was always too cowardly to own up to what he’d done. I tried his phone a second time, but as soon as the call rang through, a flurry of texts from Allison popped up on my screen.

*Why did you leave?!?!*

*Come back, babe, I can explain*

*Seriously, please, it’s not what you think please just come back please*

*I’m sorry I don’t know what you saw but I swear there’s an explanation I just need to see you face to face*

I left them all unanswered, turning my phone on silent so the constant *ding!!* wouldn’t drive me mad. I made the walk back home in record time, fueled by nothing but pure rage. I slumped on my couch and fought the urge to text Allison back. Instead, I left my phone face down on the coffee table and laid down.

Early this morning, I startled awake, unsure of how I even fell asleep when I was so upset. Hesitantly, I flipped my phone over and was greeted by the expected million unopened texts from Allison. Nothing from Alex, of course. One notification stuck out to me, though – a Snapchat from Allison. We rarely talked on that app and I couldn’t fight the curiosity anymore.

So, I opened it.

It was a video of her standing in front of the bathroom mirror, right where I’d been last night. It was the first time she’d sent me a picture or video of herself without her mask on, and I was once again struck by just how *gorgeous* she was. I felt myself softening towards her until I read the caption.

*You didn’t even wait for me to take off my mask…*

Confused, I glanced back up at her face. She’d brought her free hand up alongside her jaw, thumb wriggling against the crevice under her ear. She dug her thumb deep into her flesh, so viciously that just watching it freaked me out. That perfect smile grew across her perfect face as hooked her thumb deep into the back of her jaw… and the side of her face released.

I threw my phone down, still confused but more than that absolutely fucking *terrified.* I didn’t want to see the rest, and I didn’t have to. By the time I gathered the courage to look again, it was over. Allison hadn’t tried to contact me since.

She still hasn’t, and I’ll count myself lucky if I never see her again. I called the police right away – they laughed me off at first, but their interest piqued once I mentioned some of the things I’d found in the apartment. Apparently, a lot of guys have gone missing in the area recently, so they decided to stop by her place just in case.

When they got there, Allison was gone.

They didn’t find her, but they found the stash of trophies she’d left behind in that cabinet, all taken from those missing guys. Worst of all, they found Alex’s body… he’d been brutalized over the course of a couple weeks, but he’d only been killed last night.

I’m devastated, to say the least. Not only did I lose my best friend, but I could’ve saved him. I should’ve raised the alarm when I hadn’t heard from him for a while, but I haven’t really been seeing anyone these days. Not only that, but I know now that the sounds I laughed off last night were not what Allison said they were.

They were the groans of a dying man in pain. They were the desperate thumps of Alex’s last attempt [to get help.](https://www.reddit.com/r/hercreation/)

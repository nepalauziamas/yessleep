Because my sister has. Somehow, there were no consequences because of it. Well, not for her.

She was 15 while I was 19, and we've both been visiting our grandparents for the weekend. If you've seen my first post about the Nice Lady, then you'd get more insight.

Due to the many paranormal experiences we had at our grandparents house, we decided to take a risk and play with a Ouija board. A stupid thing to do I know, but we were curious. The fact that my sister was constantly telling my girlfriend about the paranormal didn't help, since she decided to join us, despite my grandparents protests of her even being there.

After spending the day entertaining our grandparents, when they went to sleep we decided to pull out the Quija board. Our grandparents couldn't find out what we were planning to do, since I knew that they'd freak out and steal the board from us, and then give us a lecture about it. My girlfriend, Hannah would probably get kicked out of the house and she'd have to go back to her own home.

Either way, when it was midnight, we decided to start. Nothing was happening at first, which was quite surprising for Nicole and me, since we expected for something to respond immediately. It took us about half an hour for something to respond, and honestly, I had no idea who that was.

Through all my life in that house, never have a spirit introduced themselves to me. The name that was spelled out was 'Cody', and while my sister and girlfriend were excited to get a response, I was just left confused. I was shocked that we even got a name, but I was more surprised because the name seemed familliar to me. Strange, since I never knew anyone named Cody.

I remember that we've been asking the spirit questions, about his age, how he died and why is he still here. The guy was 17, at least that's how old he was back when he died. Apparently, he got very sick, and the sickness got the better of him. Although, whenever we asked why he was still here, he didn't answer us at all.

It got to the point where my sister was the only one asking questions while Hannah and I just stared and listened. Nicole started to stray from the topic of asking questions about Cody's death, and instead started to wonder about his life. She didn't get as many answers as she'd like to, but it was enough to give us an insight of Cody's life. He was an only child, living with his parents and their cat. He would often get up to mischief as a kid and was quite like by other people.

One thing about the rest of the conversation pulled me in a loop, when Cody started to be the one asking Nicole questions, things like how old she was, what she liked, who we were to her, etc. At that point, me and Hannah would stare at each other, hardly processing what was being said in the conversation between Nicole and Cody.

My mind shut down when Nicole turned to me, laughing at something Cody spelled on the board with a red face, and asked me. "Is it illegal to date a ghost?"

I remember staring at her for a few moments, and her staring back, a wide smile across her face. I also remember her shocked expression when I rippped the board out of her hands, and put the planchette on the 'goodbye'. I put the board in my bag and turned to stare at my sister. "I don't care how old he was when he died, he's way too old for you."

Now thinking back, my words were suggesting that dating a ghost is fine as long as they're not that older than you. Thankfully, Nicole didn't pick up on that.

We left it at that, and we all went to sleep. When morning came, I took the risk of asking my grandparents about a Cody in the area. I actually regret doing that. I wished that I could just ignore the whole deal with Cody, but I was still bothered by the fact that he seemed so familliar to me.

My grandpa thought about it for a minure before replying. "Are you talking about the boy that died 20 years ago? He was the son of our neighbors, but the boy died due to cancer of the liver. Why do you ask?"

That's when I realized why the name seemed so familliar to me. I remember Cody's dad coming over a few times when I was 3-4, and he would talk about his son. He stopped coming, his grief lifted, somehow better now that he shared as much as he could about his son with other people.

Yeah, safe to say, I was quiet for the rest of the visit. For the better or for the worst, I didn't tell Nicole that we've had talked with the boy who's mother she considered a maniac.

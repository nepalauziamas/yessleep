“Sealing runes…?” Mrs. Hill squinted at the page. 

“Runes?” Northrup spluttered. “What is this hocus pocus nonsense? Are we really going to listen to this guy?”

“Those runes,” I shot back, pointing to the glowing symbols lining the room, “are the only thing that kept us from being destroyed by Karabasan. So why don’t you shut up and actually try to contribute?” I must admit, it felt good to finally lay down the law on the curmudgeonly man. “Because every second we waste in here is another second Karabasan is out wreaking havoc on Jacksonville.” 

Northrup glared at me but fell silent.

“Great,” I went on. “So according to Mr. Richardson, the way you seal an incursion is by encircling the affected area with glyphs. Unfortunately these runes are relatively complex, but the tear itself isn’t actually that big. Hopefully we’ll be able to circle it without any problem.”

“Except for Gadson,” Hill murmured. “What happened to him? I remember hearing that he broke into your office and assaulted you last week.”

“Possessed by Karabasan,” I told her. “It wasn’t pretty. He killed those two teachers over the weekend.”

The principal gasped. “*What?*”

“Yep, and then Wayne locked him up someplace, but he escaped. And now he’s here and has gotten a serious power boost from the demon. He’ll be our main threat.”

“And how do you propose we deal with him?” Northrup asked, folding his arms. “You said you fought him off, or something. What’s the secret?”

I hesitated. “I’m… not entirely sure. I cut off his hand when I escaped, but he’s regrown limbs before. He’s probably already fully healed.”

“Well, that’s helpful,” Northrup scoffed.

“Maybe we won’t run into him,” Hill offered. “And if we do, you can just stab him, right?”

I shrugged. “Possibly. He’s super fast, though, and my arm is still hurt. There’s no guarantee of anything.”

“It’s better than just sitting around uselessly,” Hill remarked. “I mean, who else could possibly hope to fight back against this thing? It’s us or no one.”

My mind flashed back to one of the things Wayne’s friend had said before he died. What was the Psi Force? Were they a possible ally? I had no clue who or what they were, unfortunately, and so I couldn’t rely on them. 

“Wait, hold on,” I said, brightening. “Wayne and his friend! They had weapons. Wayne’s out cold, and his friend was killed by Karabasan, but we can take their guns! They weren’t exactly effective against the demon, but I think they’d hurt Gadson. If we can make it to the auditorium, we’ll be able to arm ourselves properly.”

“Finally, something concrete,” Northrup said, cracking his knuckles. “Now this is starting to shape up like a good plan. So we get to the auditorium, grab the guns, and shoot anything that moves. Then we seal the portal thingy and go home heroes.”

I grinned. “Something like that. Our main problem will be getting to the auditorium undetected.”

“Sounds good,” Hill said. “No use waiting around, is there? Let’s get to it, then.”

The three of us set to work, moving the debris Karabasan had thrown against the door as quietly as we could. Finally, with a way clear, we crept out of our saferoom. Thankfully, Gadson didn’t come sprinting down a hall towards us, so we ventured further into the quiet, dead building. 

I could feel an underlying pressure permeating the building now that I was beyond the protection of the glyphs. It rippled in the air, growing like static in the back of my mind. “The portal’s getting stronger,” I said.

“How do you know?” Northrup whispered.

“I can just feel it,” I shook my head.

The old man rolled his eyes. “I don’t feel anything.”

“Shhh!” Hill frowned. “Don’t draw attention!”

We rounded a corner. “Too late,” I held out my sword. Ahead of us was a strange hazy spot in the air, like the light had refracted around it. Two glittering, reflective eyes stared at us.

“What... is that?” Hill took a step back. Northrup made some sort of gasping sound, unable to form words.

“Ghost,” I said. The indistinct form rushed at me. I swung my sword horizontally, aiming to cut it in two. The entity flowed to the side, avoiding my strike, and arms extended towards my neck. I brought the sword up, shearing through them. The hazy form fractured there, and from the ghost came a sound like hissing gas. The glittering eyes narrowed. It hung back, afraid of the iron and silver.

I pressed forward, bringing my sword in a broad sweeping arc that the ghost dodged, following it up with a flick of my wrist and a thrust. The sword pierced the hazy air and I heard something shatter. The ghost’s form trembled, shivering, and then fell away, disintegrating. 

“Well.” I stood up straight. “That one was easier than the poltergeist.”

“It’s gone, then?” Northrup asked. The two had retreated back around the corner during the skirmish. 

“Yep,” I said. “I killed it. I think. If you can truly kill a ghost. Whatever, it’s gone now. But Karabasan has implied that ghosts were his agents. He could have been spying through it. Even if he wasn’t, I’m sure he’ll notice its loss soon, if he hasn’t already. We should assume he’s on his way back here.”

“We need to keep moving, then,” Hill said.

“Yeah…” I replied, but I was distracted by a crack in the school’s wall. I felt a cold energy radiating from it. It felt… strangely familiar. “What is this?”

“Thomas?” Hill called. “We need to go.”

“Right, yes,” I said absently. I bent down, inspecting it, leaning my sword against the wall. Through the crack I could see a brilliant whiteness peppered with bright blue swirls. I felt gentle waves of power seeping through. It was a little like the radiation the portal was spewing out, only less violent. I ran my fingers along the edges of the crack, my hand tingling from the cold. When I pulled them away, glowing blue steam rolled off them. “Huh.”

“Kid, what are you doing?” Northrup frowned. “We’ve got to go.”

I snapped back to attention and grabbed my sword. Was it my imagination, or did it vibrate faintly when I picked it up? “Yeah, sorry about that. I’m coming.” At least my hand had stopped steaming. 

We worked our way inwards, taking back routes through the school to avoid being spotted. I had to take down two more ghosts, but neither presented much of a challenge. I guess they were supposed to be more of sentries than anything, although Gadson’s absence was both puzzling and welcome. I saw a few more cracks in the school’s wall giving off strange energy, some white and blue, some purple and black. 

Finally, we reached the double doors that led to the central aisle of the auditorium. “The weapons are right through here,” I told them. “We grab them quick and blast whoever’s in there. Then we seal the portal before it becomes too strong.”

They nodded, and I pushed the doors open. No one was on the stage, but the portal still hummed with power. I noticed that the unconscious audience, once scattered around the room, were now lined up in the backstage wings. Wayne’s fallen friend had been left, slumped over, gun abandoned at his side. I rushed over and grabbed it, handing it off to Northrup. “That’s better,” I said. “Now we gotta find Wayne.” I glanced over to where I’d seen him fall, but his unconscious form wasn’t there anymore. I blinked. “Maybe he’s awake.”

**“Not… exactly.”**

I spun around, my sword high. Northrup and Hill jumped. Standing further down the aisle was Wayne, his eyes black and inky. “No,” I whispered.

**“Oh, you’d be surprised how easily minds can be taken,”** Karabasan laughed through Wayne. **“Listen, Gadson and I are a bit busy right now, but after I kill your new friends, I’m going to capture you and then we’re going to have a little heart to heart before I kill you horribly.”** He grinned, raising his lightning gun. Electricity arced towards Northrup and Hill, but to my surprise, I found my sword arm outstretched, my sword blocking the beam of lightning and absorbing it. Even more surprising was that I wasn’t being electrocuted by it.

**“What?”** Wayne looked confused, releasing the trigger. I could still feel the energy inside my blade, little crackles of lightning playing along its length.

“Interesting,” I said, examining it. I pointed it at Wayne and it released a jagged burst of electricity, knocking him off his feet with a thunderclap.

Wayne stirred, smoking, and got to his feet shakily. **“What are you** ***doing?*****”**

I shrugged. “I’m just as surprised as you are.”

Beside me, Northrup fired his gun, the purple energy hitting Wayne squarely in the chest and sending him flying across the room, his gun flying from his grasp. He did not rise.

“Great,” I said, striding to the stage. “They’re definitely coming back for us now. We’ve got to be quick. Hill, grab his gun. Northrup, me and you are going to draw the glyphs around the portal.” I tossed him a sharpie.

The two didn’t move after me. “You… just caught a lightning bolt,” Hill finally said.

“We’re fighting a demon with futuristic technology and silver sword,” I responded. “And you’re surprised my sword can catch lightning? So what? It’s probably the portal’s influence. I think it’s messing with reality.” I could feel it still, wave after wave of energy crashing into me. It made me slightly woozy.  I jumped up on the stage, uncapping my own sharpie, opening Richardson’s journal to the right page. Northrup crouched beside me. At the front of the main aisle, Hill stood guard, having switched guns with Northrup. 

The portal itself was in the shape of a rough oval, probably about four feet in diameter. To make sure it was properly contained, I figured we should make the circle of runes about six feet in diameter.

“Ok, looks like all we have to do is write these six symbols in a repeating pattern around the portal. As soon as the incursion is fully encircled, the runes will glow and the portal will start to shrink.” I began drawing the first symbols, fighting to keep my hand from shaking despite the powerful throbbing of the tear beside me. I really was getting nauseous. Northrup got to work on the opposite side of the portal, working his way around to meet the start of my chain. “You really don’t feel it?” I asked him, about a quarter of the way through. “The force coming from the portal?”

Northrup shook his head, grunting. “Don’t be daft, boy. There’s no ‘force’ coming out of the portal. Perhaps I’m a little uneasy being next to a literal tear in reality, but I’m not turning green like you are.” He raised a bushy eyebrow. “I thought you were the one versed in the supernatural. Shouldn’t you be used to seeing strange things like this?” He gestured at the portal.

It was getting hard to think with the constant psychic assault. “Yeah… I suppose so. It’s just… it’s so strong! How can no one else notice?”

Northrup shrugged. “Maybe we’re too old. Maybe only young people can feel it.”

“No, that can’t be it. Jacob, one of the students, couldn’t feel it either.” I finished my line, connecting with Northrup’s starting point. A few seconds later, Northrup completed his and straightened up, capping his marker. 

We both stared at the runes on the ground and waited.

“Now what, genius?” Northrup snapped when nothing happened. “They’re not glowing!”

“I can see that!” I snapped back. The energy pouring from the portal had already frayed my nerves. I didn’t need to deal with Northrup now. “Maybe we made a mistake when writing them!”

“I followed that dumb book of yours down to the letter!” Northrup responded as we frantically scoured the runes for any mistakes. 

“I know! So did I!” 

“You sure there’s no incantation or any other gobbledygook we gotta do to activate these things?”

I gave a frustrated cry. “No! They’re supposed to detect the incursion automatically and use the energy it gives off to power themselves!” We found no mistakes in the chain of glyphs.

“Maybe you didn’t encircle it fully,” Hill suggested from offstage.

“No, there’s definitely plenty of room,” I took a few steps back, gazing at the setup. What could we have done wrong? We didn’t make any mistakes writing the runes out. We encircled the portal. So the incursion was contained! Why wouldn’t it work?

The incursion… Visions of the cracks in the walls flashed through my mind. I gasped. “Guys… remember those strange cracks that we found on our way over here?”

“The ones you were fascinated with? Yes,” Hill said, frowning. “What do they have to do with anything?”

“I think they're incursions, too,” I replied. “When I looked through some of them, I could see… sort of the same thing as when you look through the portal. Darkness with swirls of purple and blue. The same energy was leaking from them, too, although not nearly as much. Also, I could feel the portal all the way across the school. It wasn’t that strong when it first opened.”

“What are you saying?” Northrup asked, arms crossed.

“I think the entire school is an incursion,” I said, wide eyed. “It’s not just this portal anymore. It was, but now it’s causing the fabric between worlds to fray. And in some places, the places we found the cracks, it’s starting to break through!”

“*The entire school?!*” Nortrup exploded. “Are you kidding?! We can’t draw your funny shapes around the whole building! Sharpies don’t even work on dirt! How would we possibly finish it before that demon finds us, anyways?” 

“Guys, we need to calm down,” Hill urged. “I’m sure there’s a way to fix this—” 

She was cut off by a calm voice coming from the back of the auditorium. “Unfortunately, dear principal, there is no fixing this.”

We all whirled. Standing in front of the open double doors was a familiar robed figure.

Gadson.

“The master is on his way to deal with you presently, Thomas,” He smirked. “But before he gets here, I’m going to properly murder your friends.” The deranged psychiatrist began striding down the center aisle. 

Northrup fired the lightning gun, but Gadson held a hand up and absorbed the beam. “Being the avatar of a demon has its perks,” He laughed. “Mortal weapons don’t bother me anymore.”

“You sure seemed bothered by my sword,” I growled. 

Gadson grimaced, his face illuminated by the crackling electricity. “Silver doesn’t agree with anything supernatural. But that is beside the point.” He took a step forward.

Hill powered her gun up and fired at Gadson, a stream of purple energy pushing him back. He grunted with exertion. 

“Subterran tech,” He muttered, catching the beam with his other hand. “Not enough to stop me, unfortunately for you. I have the power of the Immaterial Plane backing me, and the incursion grows stronger every second.” Another step forward. 

And another.

We couldn’t stop him. He could heal from whatever damage I did to him with the sword. Our guns were useless now. Karabasan was headed to the school to end us anyways, so what good would it do even if we defeated Gadson? We couldn’t even close the portal. It was too late for that.

The portal…

Still energy flooded from it, never ceasing. Washing over me, calling to me. I gazed into the void.

“O’Keen!” Northrup yelled over the crackling of the lightning and the hum of the purple energy. “Get over here and help us! Stab him or something!”

I wasn’t listening. I could barely hear him, anyways, over the roar of the outpouring power. I took a step towards the portal, to the frayed edges of the tear.

*“O’Keen!”* Northrup roared.

I stepped through. It felt like falling. It felt like waking up. 

I floated in a sea of darkness. Around me, purples, blues, and pinks burst into existence against the black canvas void, only to wink out again as fast as they appeared. 

“Strange,” I murmured. I twisted my head around to look behind me. The portal was gone. Had it closed? Or was I in a different place now?

I could still feel the energy. It was muted now, but still present. 

And so was something else. I felt it gathering nearby, like clouds ominously coalescing on the horizon before a storm. Something dragged itself out of the darkness, drawing close to me. I shivered.

**Human.** It spoke. There wasn’t a voice, per se, but rather an intrusion in my mind, claws raking themselves across my conscious. **You don’t belong here.**

I opened my mouth to speak but found I could not form words. I felt strangely detached from my entire body. Instead, I tried transmitting my thoughts. *I know. Where am I?*

**The Immaterial Plane, traveler. We do not get many visitors here.** I managed to turn to face whoever was speaking but wasn’t able to even comprehend it. Angular lines that didn’t have a particular pattern, superimposed on the darkness behind. Impossible geometry. I could immediately sense that this was not the body of the entity, but rather the mind. **Nor do we particularly want them.**

*I understand,* I sent back. *I am sorry for my incursion.*

**Ah, but it was not your incursion, was it? It was Karabasan’s. And it is Karabasan that has given you the key to defeating him.**

*Yes. Um, what? What key?* 

**A hole has opened in your soul, widened by his constant visitations. One that leads to the realm above yours.**

*Oh, uh, are you sure that's a good thing?*

**Whether or not it is good is for you to find out. But I digress, and you linger still.**

*I… don’t know how to leave. Where is the portal back?* 

**It is here. All around us. We are the portal back. Can you not feel it, traveler? You have the mark of the Cognitive Realm on you. Use it. Leave, and do not return.**

*What?*

But the being withdrew, lines folding impossibly inwards, ever shifting, retreating back into the darkness. I floated, alone once more. 

The portal is all around me? I am the portal? What sort of sense does that make? I stewed for a second. I could still feel the energy, a rippling undercurrent in this reality. 

*You have the mark of the Cognitive Realm on you…*

What had Wayne said about incursions? Specifically, higher realm incursions?

*They bring with them a load of energy from the realms they cross through.*

The Cognitive Realm. That was the origin of the energy I had felt pouring from the portal, the energy I could still vaguely feel here. Didn’t Karabasan say that humans had limited access to it in our dreams? It was the source of imagination or soul, or something like that? That it had the ability to shape reality?

I reached for the power. It was slippery, being so far away. So muted. I concentrated hard and grabbed hold of it. The energy infused me, invigorating me. I could see the way back. It was clear as day, now. 

I pushed myself forward, towards the shining gate.

And exploded out of it. 

I slammed to the floor of the stage, cracking the wood. My entire body felt numb. I steamed with light blue energy.

In front of me, Hill and Northrup were still firing their guns at Gadson, who had made it halfway up the aisle. All three looked at me, dumbfounded.

“Impossible,” Gadson breathed.

“Kid, I thought you were dead!” Northrup yelled. “You went into the portal and vanished!” He paused. “And you’re *glowing!”* 

“Impossible,” Gadson repeated. “You couldn’t have survived. You’re not trained! You’re not experienced! The Immaterial Plane should have been a death sentence!”

Power roared in my ears, flowing from the portal.

My power.

I smiled. I concentrated on my wounded arm and felt the claw marks close up. “Oh, my dear Gadson, you have no idea what’s possible.” I waved a hand, flinging a burst of kinetic force at him and sending him flying backwards through the wall.

Hill and Northrup cut their guns off, turning to face me. “What… what did you just do?” Northrup asked carefully.

“It’s time to level the playing field,” I said, jumping down the from the stage. “I’ll handle this.” 

With a shriek of rage, the inhuman Gadson flung himself through the hole in the wall, his dark eyes glittering. “O’Keen! Where are you?” He spotted me and blurred, suddenly standing in front of me. The rage across his features contorted to pain, and he gurgled, one hand outstretched towards my face.

I slid my sword out of his abdomen. The broadsword’s blade was stained with black blood. “I must say, I think I like the Jacob’s style of sword better. Rapier, I think it was,” I gave the broadsword a few experimental swings, hacking off Gadson’s arms. Inky blood flowed freely onto the floor. “But it doesn’t quite have the same power behind the swings like this does.”

Gadson’s mouth was open in agony, straining to make a sound. I could the wounds already trying to heal themselves. 

“Like it?” I asked. “Pure silver. Unlike Jacobs’s sword, which was just tipped with a thin, poor quality layer. Burns, doesn’t it?” I lopped his head off with a lazy swing. It rolled, still staring, still openmouthed.

“Kid,” Northrup said. “You just summoned a sword. You just killed him!” 

“Well, it’s not really him we have to worry about, anyways,” I responded. 

“How did you just do that?” Hill asked.

I shrugged. “I guess Karabasan’s interference can have its perks.” I suddenly felt a disturbance. A presence drew near. “Speak of the devil.”

A hurricane of darkness exploded through the back wall of the auditorium, debris flying everywhere. I threw up my hands, a translucent blue energy shield springing into existence and saving us from being crushed beneath concrete bricks. **“THOMAS!”** A voice roared. Two white eyes blazed with fury.

I dropped the shield. “Hello, Karabasan,” I waved to the pulsing mass of shadows in the back of the room. “I told you I’d stop you, didn’t I?”

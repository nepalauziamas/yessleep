Back in 2013 I was in a bad way. My Mom was in the hospital dying from stage 4 ovarian cancer and I just couldn’t get a grip. I had always been a chemical enthusiast and during this time my drinking and drug use had reached a fever pitch. Days blended into nights blended into days blended into nights and I sleepwalked through a shadowy existence, knuckles bruised, raw throat coated in evaporated Royal Gate and Roxie dust. Pale, pimpled, perpetually sniffling and sunken eyed, physically and emotionally broken, I often took long drives at night with no destination. 19th Ave., Sloat, The Great Highway, Golden Gate Park.

What I remember most about this particular night is the cold. Even though the city never really dips below the 40s, sometimes that ocean wind sweeps up the mist in the air and water molecules bore their way into your skin, through your chest and into your heart, bringing with them a wet chill that saturates your veins. It was one of those nights and I couldn’t run my heater because my car was an absolute piece of shit. I drove a green 1996 Geo Prizm that I had bought for $1200 from a crooked funeral director in East Oakland (he threw in a G-Shock watch to sweeten the deal). Not only was the car’s heater broken, but the passenger side window didn’t close all the way, the driver’s side lock was busted, the headlights didn’t turn on, and the stereo had been ripped out leaving only a mess of tangled electrical wires. 

Riding passenger was Gigi, my girlfriend at the time. Her dyed black hair fell over her big, sad, tired eyes as she leaned forward in her seat, rolling a blunt on the cracked glass of her iPhone 5. Danny Brown’s *XXX* played thinly through the tiny phone speaker. We drove through Golden Gate Park and we weren’t talking when the red and blue lights went up behind us.  

“Fuck!” 

Since my headlights didn’t work, I had always known that getting pulled over was inevitable. But my general apathy and psychic paralysis kept me from doing anything about it. Aside from the weed on Gigi’s lap, we had an open Straw-Ber-Rita in the cupholder and about 100 Xanax bars bundled up in the glove compartment. The floor of the car was littered with empty beer bottles and spray paint cans. The upholstery stank of malt liquor and swisher guts. We were probably fucked.

Gigi shoved the weed and open container under her seat as I pulled to the side of the road. We were heading east on John F. Kennedy Drive and had just crossed Park Presidio. My guess is that we were somewhere between Stow Lake and the De Young, but it gets very dark in the park at night and I was pretty fucked up so I can’t be sure. 

“Fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck…”

We rolled to a stop on the shoulder, half in the street, half in the dirt. The air was tense. No sooner had I put the car in park than I was startled by a tapping on my window. A dark figure had appeared and stood beside my door. I glanced nervously at Gigi, unsure of how the cop had gotten to our car so quickly, but her wide eyes provided no comfort. I slowly cranked the window down.

“License and registration.”

The cop’s voice sounded thin and far away – almost grainy, like an old record that had been worn down over time. I glanced up to see a hunched over, frail old man whose ill-fitting uniform hung off of his wiry frame. His hair was stringy and gray and combed over to hide a bald head. In the darkness his skin looked gray and blotchy. His eyes were a bloodshot pale blue and inset, hollow and tired. His red, knobby nose was wet and ran into his gray stubble. The unmistakable smell of vodka and cigarettes wafted into the car as he leaned forward, right hand on his gun. I was frozen. Something wasn’t right.

Seemingly without thought, Gigi opened the glove box to retrieve the registration and the bundled up Xanax tumbled onto the floor of the car. 

Fuck.

I looked over at the cop. He stared at the bag and a slow smile crawled across his face, cracking his chapped lips. 

I stomped on the gas.

Somehow, the second I took off the cop was already on our tail, siren blaring. I don’t know how that old man got back to his car so quickly, but I did know there was no way I was going to outrun a police cruiser in my shitty Geo. The cop nudged the back of my car with his bumper, nearly sending us spinning off the road into the forest. Gigi grabbed my leg. I leaned forward in my seat and hunched over the steering wheel, heart pounding in my ears, mentally willing the car to go faster, *please go faster*, but it was no use. Up ahead I saw the turnoff for 8th Ave. I yanked the steering wheel to the left. My bald tires skidded on the pavement. The cops lights danced inside my car like a nauseous rave and the siren screamed in our ears. We blasted through the stop sign and out of the park across Fulton. 

And just like that, he was gone. The air was dark and silent. No sirens, no lights, no cop car behind us at all. It was like the second we left the park, he disappeared. I didn’t dare pull over – instead I took us straight home. I still don’t know what the fuck happened that night or how we got so lucky. But I did get my headlights fixed that weekend.

The title doesn't lie. My Dad is a chair. To be specific, he's a fully upholstered bright orange angel accent living room chair. The kind with wooden legs you'd find in any 3 piece suit from the '70s. He's pretty comfortable, truth be told. A little lumpy in places, but his padding is soft. Warm too. He's *always* warm. There's also the tell-tale *ba-thump ba-thump ba-thump* coming from his back cushion. A steady rhythm at my lumbar to remind me I'm sitting in no ordinary chair.

He wasn't always a chair. Until last year he was Kevin the accountant. He was 51, slightly overweight, and generally seemed to enjoy life as a human. He was married to Mom. He still is but, well, as you can imagine it's a little complicated now.

It was funny at first. He came home from work one day and just sat in a corner of the living room.

When we'd ask him why he was sitting on the floor and not the $4000 cream leather couch, he'd just smile and say "It feels right here". It stopped being funny the morning he didn't go to work. Turns out he hadn't slept the night before. He'd been watching a movie with Mom but hadn't gone with her to bed. She left him sitting in his spot, unsuspicious of the "I'm not tired, I'll be up a little later" lie. She and I both begged him to get up but he refused to move. Phoned in sick at work, the whole deal. Just spent the day sitting on the floor in his corner. We kept asking him what was wrong, why he wouldn't get up except to use the bathroom, and he just kept saying "No… no this feels right".

Mom phoned the doctor around the third day of this. He'd stopped eating or drinking, you see. Stopped getting up to use the bathroom too. Surprisingly though there weren't as many… umm… accidents, as you'd think. Once he'd allowed the last of the food and drink to leave him it seemed to stop coming. We also didn't hear his belly growl despite going a day and a half without food. The doctor couldn't make sense of it. Their first guess was that it was psychosomatic, but that wouldn't explain the absence of digestive activity exposed by the stethoscope. They said they'd be back to take some blood samples in a few days after they liaised with some colleagues. Unfortunately, as I said, this was last year. 2020. We never heard back from the doctor thanks to the virus-that-shall-not-be-named. I guess "guy with gut troubles who refuses to move" is low on the priorities list during a global pandemic.

Somehow Mom managed to wrangle long-term sick leave with Dad's company. Decades of loyal employee-ism combined with Mom's attendance of every company BBQ and softball game helped Mr. Bannerfrag buy the "unexplained stomach concern requiring hospitalization" excuse. I'll never forget that phone call. At the time, Dad losing his job was the worst-case scenario for both of us. He'd always been the breadwinner. Neither of us could support ourselves without him, we'd lose the house in under a year. Dad didn't seem too perturbed by Mom's frantic pacing, or the lies she wormed through the phone to Mr. Bannerfrag. He just stared at the wall serenely, hovering his butt half a foot from the carpet, balancing with his legs bent and his hands flat on the ground behind him.

That night I fell asleep listening to Mom yelling at Dad. He never yelled back.

We started noticing the physical changes a few days later. That's when we realized this *wasn't* psychosomatic. Unfortunately, our shitty "best insurance deal on the market" doctor wasn't picking up the phone. We'd get passive-aggressive emails informing us they were "waiting to hear back from colleagues", but that was it. This was not good. Especially not when the joints in Dad's arms and legs had fused. The not-goodness of the Doctor's silence increased a thousandfold when we sent photos of Dad's hands and feet flaking off like discarded spider husks the following week. Did the response change? No. We got a *very* snippy email about shortages on ICU wards and the “critical international situation". Mom's shouting match with the Chief of Medicine, the one she demanded her way up the phone chain to speak to, didn't change things. We were on our own.

Mom spent all her time in the living room with Dad. I'd help her wash him, try and make him eat, talk to him when she'd tire out and fall asleep on the rug. Every day of this routine brought with it new changes in Dad's body. It started with his limbs, as you can probably guess. When his hands and feet fell off there was no blood. They flaked apart, crusty and dry and brittle throughout. Even the bones of his toes and fingers had the density and consistency of dead skin. The wrists and ankles they left behind were smooth and hard. It was difficult to tell whether we were looking at flesh or exposed bone. The dark shining surface seemed to blend into his normal arm at the base of the stumps. This discoloration would rise further up his limbs daily, and before long I awoke to see Dad's head and torso fused to the wooden chair legs supporting my weight while I write this.

Well, I use the term "Dad's head and torso" in the loosest possible sense. By the time his limbs were completely replaced, the rest of him had undergone a slow, harrowing transformation of its own.

His shoulders, and the arms attached to them, descended lower and lower. They found their final resting place at Dad's pelvis, sat squarely behind his rigid legs. The chest area they'd left behind had its own problems. Day by day Dad's neck retracted further inwards. It didn't stop when his jaw met collarbone, either. It pulled Dad's head deep into his ribcage. His face flattened as the skull supporting it sank, forcing his eyes to point in opposite directions. Eventually, they slid down to where his nipples once lay, resting glassy and vacant on his pecks. The change wasn't quick enough to break his jaw though. Instead, it bent outward, its hinges spreading wide across Dad's broad chest. Each morning I'd find Mom sobbing over a fresh unnecessary piece of himself he'd discarded. Hair, ears, nose, his… umm…. his *thingy…* all of them flaked off and crumbled to dust in her hands.

He lost the ability to speak as his head withdrew. Unsurprising though, right? He made his intentions clear before he went . The last words he ever said to me.

"Don't cry… I am chair… always was chair… *happy* as chair…"

That was the worst part, I think. Knowing that, whatever the fuck was happening to Dad, he wasn't resisting it. That when he'd got that initial urge to sit in the corner and not get up, he didn't fight it. That he was *happy* this way. The implication being that when he was human, when he was a father and husband and accountant, he wasn't.

Sadly I still don't know why or how Dad became a chair. I didn't post any photos, you see. Mom wouldn't let me, didn't want the embarrassment. Wanted to keep Dad's dignity intact. Thing is, I agreed with her and kind of still do. I'm *glad* I didn't go to the socials with pics of Dad at various stages of his journey. The temptation was there to see if anyone could help. Nobody could have though, could they? Dad would have become just another internet circus freak. I've done enough research and digging over the months to know that whatever happened to Dad, he's the only one.

Well, almost only.

Mom's own changes started around the time Dad's skin was rethreading into orange fabric and his eyes had hardened into plastic buttons. Her change was a little different. It started in her torso, stretching her day by day while she remained in crab-pose. I must say, she makes a *great* couch. Her transformation may have been a little more distressing, but the end result is better (sorry Dad, it is what it is). I think the worst part with Mom was the despondency. Dad was so serene as he changed. Mom though? Mom wouldn't stop weeping. Quiet sobs, tears that fell for a few days even after her own eyes had become flat plastic. She wasn't crying because of the change though, I think. I think it was because she wouldn't get to see how beautiful I'll look when I go through my own metamorphosis.

Thing is, I get it now. Dad was right. He *was* chair. Mum *was* couch. I *am* coffee table. I always was. I was scared at first when I realized. The truth hit me like a piano dropped from the Empire State Building. I was scrubbing the last of Mom's remaining human skin when it struck through every bone in my wrong body, just as it must have done both Dad and Mom.

I spent that whole night sitting on Dad, tears falling down my cheeks, staring at my spot. I didn't want it to be true. I screamed for it not to be, more than once. I couldn't deny the facts I knew deep down to my bones though. That spot, the space on the rug in front of chair Dad and couch Mom, is for me. It's mine. Where I belong.

Unlike blissfully accepting Dad, and weeping resigning Mom, I fought it for a few days. I’m not like them; I’m only 17. I have… had... dreams, ambitions, goals. I wanted to go to college, settle down, marry some lucky guy, be a Mom. I wasn’t ready to give up my human form. I spent my nights begging for more time. Nothing answered. The urges didn’t abate, my awareness of reality now the illusions had been swept away was too great. When I have slept this last week or so my dreams have always been the same. I dreamt of *true* reality, of how I now know things should be. I dream of me in my place, my body elongated and wooden and flat as is right, as is correct, as is natural. I have long, blissful slumbers filled with the feeling of hot ceramic mugs on my tabletop and thick carpet beneath my four legs.

I can’t fight it anymore. I’m posting this here but also printing it out to leave as a note for the removal guys. I want them to be careful with us when the bank repossesses the house and we end up in storage. Please keep us together, if you can. We’re a set. Dad’s sick leave ended months ago. As you can imagine, the foreclosure notices have been piling up. I stopped caring about the pile of mail under the door around the time that Mom’s ribcage split and flattened into her wide pinstripe-velvet upholstered back. I haven’t been hungry in days, or thirsty. I’m not even sure if I’m breathing now I think about it. I’m still scared, but I’ve come to accept that this is the way things have to be. I don’t know why, they just do. Maybe it’s a curse, maybe this house is buried on some ancient ritual site, maybe it’s just some freak anomaly of physics. Who knows. Whatever the reason, I have to suck it up and accept the way things are. This body, this walking wobbling mass of skin and bone and jibbly bits that I love so much, isn’t right. It isn’t mine. I’m not meant for it anymore. Once I post this and print the copy for the removal guys I’m going to get in my spot. Then it’s just a case of closing my eyes and waiting. I can already feel my limbs pulling inward, my thighs and upper arms sliding to where they’ll meet at my navel in a few days. There’s a tugging on the back of my knees where they’ll bend in on themselves, and all twenty of my fingers and toes grow number with each hour that passes.

Do I have any regrets? Thousands. There’s so much I’ll never get to do, to see, to go, to be. I can’t hide from the truth though. Not anymore.

I am coffee table.

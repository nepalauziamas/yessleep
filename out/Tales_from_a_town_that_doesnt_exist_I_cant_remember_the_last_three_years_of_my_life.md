Three years of my life, just gone. That time erased from my life like a drop of the hat. I don’t know how or who, but a few weeks ago I just came to. I stopped transcribing the recordings. There was too much going on in my life, My mom’s failing health, rent, bills, I didn’t have time to write down some stupid radio show! That was the last day I remember. I think because I didn’t transcribe it, something erased my memory, or worse. For example, my father wants nothing to do with me anymore. My mom passed in those three years, and he told me that I wouldn’t call or anything. He said she asked for me, over and over again. Even on her deathbed, she kept asking when I would show up. He told me that he lied to her, he kept telling her that I was on my way, but I never showed. Have you ever heard your father say he regrets the person you turned into?  I wish I hadn’t. My college, my job, everything is gone. I have nothing to my name, except two dollars and a destroyed credit score.

I’m staying at a friend's house until I can get a job and my own place. She’s one of those conspiracy theorists so I knew she would believe me. However, even she was hesitant to believe me. That is until two days ago when I received a package. Early in the morning, we heard what we thought was a drive-by at first, with tires screeching outside and a loud bang. When we looked outside we saw a large rectangular package sitting outside, addressed to me. I never told anyone that I was living here, there was no way anyone could have known, hell I haven’t even told my father. Yet there it was, a package addressed to me, I already knew what was inside of it, right then and there I knew the game I was playing.

We opened up at the dinner table. The same CB radio that was in my dad’s house. With a note that only had the word “tomorrow” on it. There’s someone out there with the power to make me forget years of my life if I don’t comply. I know this is ridiculous, no one would believe me If I told them. I suppose that’s why I'm posting this here, it doesn’t matter if you believe me or not, I think whoever is in charge, just cares that I transcribe it. What for, I don’t know, but they took the last years of my mother’s life away from me, I can't risk losing anything more. I’m going to listen to whoever is out there, I'm going to keep transcribing these broadcasts. I’ll play their game.

Automated voice: Aired Approx. 1 year, 5 months, 11 days since the town’s disappearance

Julian: Welcome back beautiful listeners! I'm your host, Julian!

Coco: And I'm Collin Cortez.

Julian: And tonight is another misty episode of *Tales From Port-Land*. Tonight we need to start this show off on a serious note. We would like to apologize for the radio silence for these past two weeks. The silence was due to a mandatory quarantine by those in power.

Coco: Basically Julian is trying to say that we were government-mandated-

Julian: Remember the announcement.

Coco: Sorry, we were mandated by "those in power" to stay in our houses due to some fog rolling into town. 

Julian: Scientists have yet to make any breakthroughs regarding the ever-increasing mist but they stress to not make contact with anyone found within it as they are no longer human.

Coco: This is getting absurd. It's been two weeks and this fog is still here. What about the people that didn't have any reserved food? Are they just locked in their houses starving? Why isn't the government-

Julian: Those in power.

Coco: (groan) Why are the ones in power not helping us. They have guns, they have protective outfits. Why aren't they delivering rations?

Julian: Coco you silly boy, they told us why when they made the announcement. They're no longer our government. They made it very clear that they have no legal responsibility to assist us anymore.

Coco: What a load of bullshit. Like how can they just hold up in their big safe fort and relax while they watch us starve? Also, how do we even know this fog is dangerous? Our town’s only research team is on the government’s payroll.

Julian: We're Port-Lands only voice. We can't be spreading Paranoia like that Coco. We have to ensure everyone's safety.

Coco: Yeah well, I- ugh fine, I understand. I'm sorry. It's just a little infuriating hearing what little government we have left tell us that we're not *their* responsibility.

Julian: It is disheartening to hear, but it's something we've all known for quite some time. This town has been getting along just fine without them for a while now. And together we're not alone! Even Mayor Danica Carter is on our side!

Coco: Too bad she doesn't have Emergency Broadcast privileges like us. It would ease some tension if we knew she had a plan. She's been radio silent ever since this fog rolled in.

Julian: That's why we're here tonight. It was fantastic luck that everyone was still working at the studio when the mist decided to visit. This broadcast can help alleviate tensions and show everyone that they're not alone!

Coco: That's great and all but what are we going to do about this week's news? The post office hasn't been able to send us a list of updates.

Julian: Why Improv my dear Coco! The beauty of theatrics!

Coco: You do seem like the person to be into drama.

Julian: I live and breathe theater! The costumes, the pre-show dread, the feeling of the crowd hanging onto your every word! Oh, Coco let's host a play!

Coco: No.

Julian: I must weep. But they are cruel tears. This sorrow's heavenly; It strikes where it doth love.

Coco: Are you quoting Shakespeare?

Julian: Othello to be exact. It was the first play I ever performed back in secondary school.

Coco: For some reason I never pictured you going to school. Who were you?

Julian: I was the dastardly Iago, Planting seeds of doubt into poor Othello.

Coco: Could have just said you played Iago.

Julian: No, I played Othello. I was originally cast as an understudy to Othello because my teacher deemed my acting "too poor". He hoped that through osmosis I could obtain some of Brady's talent.

Coco: Who's Brady?

Julian: She was the star actor. She could do no wrong. An acting prodigy, an heir to the god of theater himself, Dionysus!

Coco: Woah. Sweet little Julian had a rival back in high school?

Julian: A rival that I crushed. You see I had to prove that my acting was superior, so I played the part of her friend. After I gained her trust, I convinced her that her loved one was having an affair.

Coco: Julian you didn’t.

Julain: Which caused a surprisingly bloody brawl in the high school parking lot and our teacher had no choice but to exile her from the drama class.

Coco: Julian, that's pretty heartless.

Julian: Thus the understudy took center stage and the crowd's heart.

Coco: You can't just gloss over the fact you ruined a relationship!

Julian: I thought it was thematically fitting as Iago had done the same, and look at how well he turned out.

Coco: I'll get back to you on that once I read Othello.

Julian: Oh you can borrow my copy! I have all of Shakespeare's works!

Coco: I mean if this fog ever decides to leave, you can lend me your copy. Speaking of the fog Has anything happened like this before?

Julian: Nothing that I can recall. We did have a strange case of fatalities due to vehicles a while back.

Coco: But I thought we didn’t have any gas left in this town.

Julian: We don't. Which made it so baffling.

Coco: Did anyone figure it out?

Julian: Not that I'm aware of. We discovered that keeping the traffic lights on reduced the fatalities almost completely.

Coco: So ghost cars obey traffic laws?

Julian: Wouldn't cars need souls to become a specter?

Coco: I don't know. I didn't believe in ghosts until recently when Billy came into our lives.

Julian: And I'm glad he did! Our office has never been more organized!

Coco: Wait. Hear me out. Billy is dead right?

Julian: I believe that is one of the requirements in order to become a phantom.

Coco: And he can also pick things up.

Julian: It's a common trait found among poltergeists.

Coco: That means he can bring supplies to people in the fog!

Julian: Coco you brilliant thinker! your intellect is finally shining!

Coco: Yeah! Wait, what do you mean, finally?

Julian: No time for cheap talk Coco! Quick, hand me your wallet and I'll compile all of our money so Billy can pick up some supplies for everyone!

Coco: I mean… I don’t really have money on me right now.

Julian: What did you spend your paycheck on?

Coco: I have to start paying off that ticket, remember? Also, Quantum cat wouldn't stop bothering me until I gave her most of my paycheck.

Julian: You did promise her your whole paycheck.

Coco: That was in the heat of the moment! Also, I didn't think that the cat had the mental capacity to remember that.

Julian: It is strange that she doesn't forget. She keeps bringing me octopus tentacles.

Coco: That's worrying. How is she finding tentacles? We're surrounded by desert.

Julian: Yeah it is troubling. The good news though, is that grilled Octopus is delicious.

Coco: We're getting off-topic.

Julian: Oh yes! It's fine, I have enough money to cover the expenses. I'll be back! There’s no time to lose!

Coco: Wait, what am I supposed to do in the meantime?

Julian: Improve my dear Coco!

(The sound of a door slam, footsteps trailing off.)

Coco: Ok great. Uh well. Talking is uh… hard to do. What did I do these past two weeks? Well, I… I uh, I.. finally got enough courage to go through Oliver's Stuff. Yeah, I started doing that just a few hours before the fog came in! I’m thinking there must be something on his laptop, but the only thing I found so far was pictures of us and a bunch of Nancy Drew games. I’ve been meaning to look more but the fog put a damper on that. I barely made it to the station, if it wasn’t for Julian coming to my house to warn me I would probably be mist food by now. (Sigh)  I guess I'll have to wait to finish looking. No news from Oliver still. He could be dead, he could be alive, who knows? Not me. I wish He would just give me a sign you know, like a letter or something, but it's fine, it's cool. 

Sleeping the past two weeks here has been quite the episode. Allison, our secretary ran out of alcohol shortly after the first few days and has been having to quit cold turkey. She's been taking it pretty well. Other than the two separate attempted murders. I mean at least her reasoning was sound, they were annoying her. So I've been staying as far away from her as possible.

What else? Oh, I found out why we have so much coffee. Like two tons of it. Originally this studio was a coffee shop. There are crates stacked upon crates in the basement of just coffee beans.

Voice: Before that, this town was built on false truths and man's hubris.

Coco: Woah what the hell? How did you get in here?

Voice: Such limited time and you choose to waste it with a shallow inquiry such as that?

Coco: I mean there's only one door to this broadcast room and you didn't open it.

Voice: You still chase this futile question. Why do you stare at what's before you and not what's in the distance?

Coco: Why won't you just answer the question?

Voice: Your cat and I share the same birthplace.

Coco: You're a cat?

Voice: I expected your mind to be bustling but it appears to be vacant.

Coco: Who are you?

Voice: You can call me aftós pou den ypárchei.

Coco: So Aftós it is.

(A sharp caw of a Raven can be heard) 

Coco: Okay I blinked and the raven just appeared, how did you do that?

(The raven's cry continues.)

Aftós: Oh Raven, why won't you change your song for me once?

Coco: Yeah okay I'm checking out. I'm gonna go get Julian.

Aftós: Please! The Raven demands that I speak with you.

Coco: Couldn't you have chosen something less edgy than a raven?

Aftós: It is not I who tied my fate with this bird.

Coco: I would hate to be forced to hang around a bird who doesn't know how to shut up.

(The bird silences its cries)

Aftós: He has not chosen for me to appear here today to indulge in worthless chatter.

Coco: Okay, then why are you here?

Aftós: We require the location of Oliver.

Coco: Oh do you now?

Aftós: you seem to be calm to our request.

Coco: Mostly because that's everyone's question these days. If you want to know where Oliver is then get in line.

Aftós: We've been informed that you have knowledge as to the whereabouts of Oliver.

Coco: Who told you that?

Aftós: We are not inclined to reveal our informants.

Coco: Well I'm not inclined to tell you where Oliver is at.

Aftós: You have yet to obtain the location of Oliver?

Coco: Wouldn't you like to know.

Aftós: Do not mix my warning for threat. The deadline for finding Oliver's location is in three weeks. 

Coco: Deadline? What are you talking about?

Aftós: This plague is just the first pennant of this town's sin. Within three weeks' time, the second shall condemn this town to the gods of this world.

Coco: Plague? Do you mean this fog?

Aftós: Like all things that manifest themselves in this world, This veil is not what it seems.

Coco: What does that mean?

Aftós: I assure you that you will soon learn what hides within the veil.

Coco: What does Oliver have to do with any of this?

Aftós: He is the unknown. They fear him because of his potential. He has touched both you and Julian, causing you two to face the same freedom that he is cursed with.

Coco: Oliver knows Julian?

Aftós: This town only speaks in half-truths. Julian is no exception.

Coco: What's the truth behind Julian?

Aftós: Julian is a riddle to the raven, an enigma. Yet the eye of the raven refuses to look away. Be wary of those whom you call your family in this world forgotten by its creator.

Coco: Wait, is this dimension caused by science or the supernatural?

Aftós: One cannot live without the other. If the supernatural is proven true, then wouldn’t life beyond death be considered a part of the natural world? If so, then science would follow suit.

Coco: So you're saying that what happened here is a mix of the two?

Aftós: Science and the supernatural. Truth and deceit. We all have a piece of this world. Each is formed by our rebirths within this town. Only Oliver holds the full truth. The world is in a self-destructive dash towards your lover, clawing and tearing at whoever falls in their path.

Coco: So everyone just wants to know what is going on?

Aftós: With knowledge comes the power to shape it. The world becomes bendable, mendable. Alas, the race is naught but in blind haste, as the only one who can see is you. 

Coco: But I don't know where he is.

Aftós: Do you think that they care? You are in their path, you are in danger, but to them, you are the danger.

Coco: Well thanks for the confidence boost.

(A knock can be heard coming from the door.)

Julian: (muffled) Coco? Are you talking to yourself again? The door is locked, can you open it for me?

(The birds cry rings out once more)

Julian: Is that a raven? Did you get a raven as a guest? That’s genius, Coco! I love the creativity!

Aftós: Once more shall we meet like this again. Within two weeks I shall insist on the location of Oliver again.

Coco: and on the third week?

Aftós: After that, we shall meet again in a less… comfortable setting. 

Coco: Can I trust you?

Aftós: Half-truths are only spoken in this town. Along with half lies. Keep to yourself and you'll soon find yourself spouting half-truths as well.

(The Raven cries out again but from the right side of the speakers)

Coco: Oh how did you get over there bird? Well anyways I have like a million questions- Oh come on he disappeared! I am never breaking eye contact again, did the bird disappear too? Yep, the bird’s gone too. Who even was that?

Julian: (Muffled) Open the door buddy!

Coco: Oh right.

(Unlatching of a metal chain followed by the sound of a door being opened)

Julian: Who was that other voice?

Coco: his name was Aftós.

Julian: Is that a Greek name?

Coco: I can't remember his full name.

Julian: How did he get In here?

Coco: He has the same abilities as Quantum cat apparently.

Julian: You got a real-life superhero as our guest!?!

Coco: He had this raven, I think it’s the one giving him that ability or something.

Julian: So a man that has no use for doors and follows the commands of a raven? Nope, doesn’t ring a bell.

Coco: Maybe it was Edgar Allen Poe.

Julian: Oh I love Poe! I have all of his works if you want to borrow any. My favorite was *The Cask of Amontillado*! 

Coco: Yeah that's great and all but he said you knew Oliver.

Julian: Me? I haven't had the pleasure of meeting Oliver.

Coco: Is that a half-lie?

Julian: A what? I wouldn't lie to you, Coco. We're friends.

Coco: (groan) I'm sorry this guy is just messing with me. Why can't we just have a normal week, just once?

Julian: At least our job is never boring! Also, what's that stack of papers on our desk?

Coco: Huh? It's a transcript. The title says "news".

Julian: So our guest brought us updates! That's great! I suppose it's as good a time as ever to get into the news!

Coco: Yeah but should we trust it? I mean what if it's a trap?

Julian: Like the housing market?

Coco: No like words for a ritual or something.

Julian: Its words Coco, If it gets too "not safe for radio" I'll simply stop reading!

Coco: I guess. Wait, What happened to Billy?

Julian: He's on his way to Sheryl's diner to grab some supplies and hand them out to everyone! I told him under no circumstance to talk to anyone for too long.

Coco: Well yeah that works, I can’t come up with a better plan at the moment. Remember listeners do not stare at Billy when he arrives. Take the supplies and lock your door.

Julian: Also don't forget to tell him how good of a job he's doing!

Coco: no don’t do that, wait around thirty seconds before you try and grab the groceries. That should be enough time for Billy to get a safe distance away.

Julian: Not even a thank you?

Coco: Julian, Billy literally secretes depression.

Julian: Coco, Just because our intern Billy may not have the best people skills, I’m sure given enough time, he will learn to improve!

Coco: How do you improve- you know what? fine, You can thank Billy but at a respectable distance. Make sure to yell loud enough so he can hear you from the door.

Julian: Oh yes make sure to compliment his hair! I do love his hair.

Coco: I guess let's read off whatever Aftós left for us while our listeners wait for their supplies.

Julian: It would be my honor! Our first news story comes from our new friend Aftós! 

The mist appears to be just a by-product of that which resides within. Aftós has spent the past week observing the fog and has made the following discoveries.

The creatures inside appear to be a denser vapor than that of the fog, but nonetheless, only fog. As they are Incorporeal, Aftós has yet to find a way of hurting them yet. The creatures actively move around giving off the impression that they're sentient. 

If a citizen enters the mist, the vapors move as one toward their prey. Aftós theorizes that the mist acts as a nervous system for the residents. Informing them of any prey. Once they have reached their victim they begin to take shape.  Oh look how cute, Aftós sketched what one of these foggy boys looks like on the next page.

Coco: What does it look like?

Julian: almost humanoid, but only if you look really closely. It appears to be female, it's sad. No, sad wouldn't quite describe it right. It's haunted, its face is twisted in a shapeless kind of way.

Coco: Uh Julian? Are you okay?

Julian: I know this woman. Those sunken eyes. Not of death but of sorrow. Who did this to her? Did I do this? I only tried to help.

Coco: Julian I think you should give me the paper.

Julian: I thought that I could help her. I tried. I just didn't know what to do. She clung to me. She begged me to help her.

Coco: Julian you're scaring me, buddy. Why don't we just take this paper?

Julian: The past held her prisoner, locked in a room with no exit. Just silverware that reflected what she always feared to become. Scared to look away, for if she did, she might just disappear. She created the fog, not out of fear; no, it was something else, something more, primal.

Coco: Julian what drawing are you talking about? this is just scribbles. It's unintelligible.

Julian: I didn't leave so I could die. I wanted to leave so I could live. Why didn't she understand that?

Coco: Julian come back to me buddy. You're going through some weird stuff right now and I don't know how to handle this.

Julian: Is this all just her dream?

Coco: (snapping his fingers) Julian!

Julian: Oh hey Coco.

Coco: What was all that?

Julian: Oh I was just describing the picture. I was saying how our friend drew static.

Coco: You didn't quite use the word static.

Julian: Coco you joker, I think I would know the words that came out of my mouth.

Coco: No, you said something about leaving a girl. I think you were close to her?

Julian: Who? I don't know what you're talking about.

Coco: What? Maybe she passed away? You two were friends maybe?

Julian: Nope, I'm certain I didn't say anything like that. Are you okay Coco?

Coco: I could say the same about you!

Julian: I'm doing great Coco! Why wouldn't I be? I get to entertain all these wonderful listeners!

Coco: Whatever you say, buddy. Just to be safe, how about I read the next few parts.

Julian: Knock yourself out!

Coco: These figures appear to be a plague. Once they've encompassed their victim, they fill every orifice of their prey with vapor. After a while, the creature loses interest and begins aimlessly roaming once more. Whatever happens to the victims remains a mystery. They continue their day as if nothing has happened. I've witnessed four of these occurrences so far, each time with the same result. One thing I have noticed, after each occurrence, it appears that the victims are fixated on their bodies. This is usually shown by a hyper fixation on scratching a certain part of their body.

My theory on this whole occurrence is that the mist is a being itself, that it's alive. The plague is just organisms within the fog, like cells. Of course, I can't be certain. With all of this What is this creature's purpose? And why has it decided to gift this town with its presence now? 

Julian: Coco! There was no emotion in your reading! You have to at least pretend it's a news report.

Coco: This fog is alive? How can a vapor be alive?

Julian: Maybe we can politely ask it to leave!

Coco: welp we're dead. 

Julian: Coco!

Coco: How are we supposed to fight a gas?

Julian: Vapors aren't actually gas.

Coco: That's not the point! The point is we can't kill it! We can't reason with it! It'll just wait us out and It will win eventually.

Julian: Coco, We survived this long, we're not gonna let it end here.

Coco: Then what's your plan?

Julian: Nothing! It'll either leave or Aftós will figure something out. For now, let's just keep reading what he left for us.

Coco: I suppose we need to stay on the air until Billy is finished delivering supplies. 

Julian: Exactly!

Coco: Do you want to take over? I need some water.

Julian: Don't mind if I do! Our next story is about

(Ringing of a telephone)

Coco: What's that?

Julian: It's our wonderful secretary Veronica! Hello Veronica you're on the air!

Veronica: Can you get your twig ass down here and come assist this lady at the front door?

(A faint knocking can be heard)

Female Voice: Please I need to see Julian. Let me in. Just let me in

Veronica: Will you shut the fuck up already! Oh my God, Julian get here right now I'm about to kill her.

Julian: Wow, that is a lot of language in a short amount of time.

Veronica: I swear to you Julian I will go to your fucking house and burn all of your god damn tacky ass suits.

Julian: Have you been doing yoga? Because I see a definite improvement in your mood! I'm on my way!

Coco: What am I supposed to do?

Julian: don't worry I got this nifty microphone and earpiece so I can still talk as long as I'm in the building!

Coco: Julian I don't think interviewing some girl that's in the monster fog is a good idea.

Julian: Nonsense Coco! She seems like an articulate woman!

(The sound of a door opening and closing)

Coco: Julian is gonna die.

Julian: (of lesser quality) I can hear you, you know.

Coco: I know.

(Rhythmic steps signaling Julian walking downstairs) 

Veronica: Oh thank God you're here. Please kill her or something.

Julian: You know I can’t do that, I’m a pacifist.

Veronica: I clean the studio after every show. Trust me, you're a really bad pacifist.

Julian: Those are just cheat days Veronica!

(Loud banging on a door can be heard)

Veronica: I hope today is a cheat day.

Julian: Hello miss how are you doing today on this foggy night?

Female voice: Please open the door, Julian. My baby is cold.

Julian: Now I would just love to open this door, but I don't do well with kids.

Female voice: No, No he won't be a problem I promise.

Julian: Well why do you want me of all people? Shouldn't the hospital be a better place to stay?

Female voice: No, No I tried. But no one was there.

Julian: No one? Not a single person?

Female voice: The front door was open and all the lights were off. Please, my baby is so cold.

Julian: How old is the little guy?

Female Voice: he's really young, please he can't be out in this weather.

Julian: Well let's put it to a vote, what do you two think?

Coco: No.

Veronica: No.

Julian: Well I have bad news.

Female voice: Please. Please just open the door. He's so cold, I just want him to be happy again.

Julian: Hmm. I think I'm gonna open the door guys.

Veronica: I keep forgetting you're an idiot.

Coco: What about the vote!

(The sound of the door creaking open a bit before a sudden slam.)

Julian: So I changed my mind.

Female voice: Please why? Why won't you let us in?

Julian: Well for starters you seem to be missing the center of your stomach.

Female voice: I was just so itchy.

Julian: I understand but here at the studio we have a strict no pancreas no service policy.

Female voice: He helped me. He helped me scratch that itch.

Julian: Your baby?

Female voice: Yes, please you have to let us in.

Julian: He must have done a really thorough job.

Female voice: He's just so cold now. Please help us.

Julian: I'm not a doctor but I don't think a child should perform a C section on its own mother. Also, how is he alive? 

Female voice: He's a gift from the angels.

Julian: I wouldn't call that a gift. Also, I'm not a very religious man, so which angels?

Female voice: The angels around us, you just can’t seem them yet. They're here with me, in the mist. They want in too Julian. They want you.

Julian: Well they can't come in either. Coco doesn't believe in them.

Female voice: Let us in Julian.

Voice 2: Julian we're waiting for you.

Julian: Was that your baby? Congratulations on his first words. 

Female Voice*: Let us in.*

Voice 2: We're all waiting for you, Julian.

Julian: Okay I'm gonna go back to the studio now. Pleasure talking to you.

Female voice: LET US IN.

Julian: Hey Veronica, get everyone here and bring them to the basement. Lock the doors and don't come out until I say so.

Veronica: Even the weird deer girl in the break room?

Coco: You mean Cynthia? She is a child and our new intern.

Veronica: That beast is a child?

Coco: Veronica! I know there’s an outbreak of stress here in the office but there’s no need to belittle our team! She’s a wendigo, a lot of girls go through this during puberty.

Veronica: I’m getting you a book on human anatomy. 

Coco: Oh I would love to add that to my library, in the meantime start rounding everyone up!

Veronica: Oh boy I get to die trapped with interns in a damp basement, riveting.

Julian: That's the spirit! I'm gonna head back to the studio room.

Coco: Oh we are so fucked.

Julian: Oh, it's not that bad.

Coco: There are plague monsters outside our door Julian!

Julian: The operative word being outside.

Coco: Why do they want us?

(footsteps of Julian going upstairs)

Julian: No idea. Maybe we're just special.

Coco: Where's the gun at Julian?

Julian: Coco, we can't kill the plague with a gun.

Coco: It's not for them.

Julian: I'm going to pretend I didn't hear that.

Coco: We can't beat them, Julian! They're going to win eventually!

(The door to the recording room opens, and Julian's audio gets noticeably clearer)

Julian: Coco, trust me. I have a plan.

Coco: Oh yes! What is it?

Julian: And ruin the suspense? 

Coco: Suspense? This isn't some kind of game Julian!

Julian: Trust me. Let's just read the next news segment and the plan will be ready by then.

Coco: What? (Groan) fine.  Let's read the next part.

Julian: Our next news story continues to come from the same notes we've been reading off of, Aftós! Our next story reads, Oliver an enigma by any other name.

Coco: Give me that!

(paper being quickly snatched)

Julian: Wow ripped the paper right out of my hands, rude.

Coco: Why is this person so special? The information I've gathered is inconclusive at best. Current information is that he went missing six weeks ago. Within this time no clues have been found as to his whereabouts. That's why everyone is patiently waiting for Collin to act. This small, unfit, unkempt, arrogant, nearsighted, man is the only possible lead to Oliver. 

Julian: At least his notes are thorough.

Coco: If this is the case then why is Collin so unprotected? Why has none of the factions tried to abduct Collin? This leads me to a theory.

Julian: Oh what is Aftós's theory, Coco?

Coco: All the factions are somehow connected. A circle with Collin at its center. Maybe it's fear that holds the factions from approaching Collin? Collin himself may be a deterrent. If any of the factions attempt to make contact with Collin it will jumpstart a war. It's also too much of a coincidence that shortly after Oliver's disappearance Collin began to work at a public broadcast station. There are too many questions to draw any conclusions, but one thing is certain. Oliver holds all the answers, and if I can get to Oliver first, I can stop what's about to happen. 

Julian: That was mostly information we already knew!

Coco: I can die at any minute. I have everyone looking at me. Oh god.

Julian: That's not anything new. We're faced with our mortality every day!

Coco: Everyone expects me to just be a good little puppet and tell everyone where Oliver is publicly, well fuck that. I'm done being pulled by all these invisible strings.

Julian: That's the spirit, Coco!

Coco: Listen here, everyone. I'm going to burn every little thing related to Oliver. How's that for your grand plan? I'll make sure No one will find out where he is!

Julian: Woah getting a little heated there, buddy. I like it.

Coco: I'm done! I'm done being everyone's errand boy-

(Loud banging can be heard)

Grizzled female voice: (muffled) Julian you fucking waste of cells! Open this door now!

Julian: Oh we have a special guest tonight. It's none other than  Mayor Danica Carter herself!

Coco: How did she make it through the mist?

Julian: That is an excellent question, Coco! Also, how did she get through our front door? I definitely locked it.

Mayor: (muffled) I don't have time to answer your stupid ass questions! If you idiots want to live then let me in!

Julian: Well I do cherish living. If I open this door you promise not to attack me?

Mayor: (muffled) Oh for the love of God, yes, sure, whatever.

(What sounds like Julian opening the door followed by a sound I can best describe as a hammer hitting raw steak)

Coco: Holy shit!

Julian: Ow my face, You promised! Is that a gas mask you’re wearing? It looks good on you!

Mayor: (panting) You idiots just signed your death warrants! 

Coco: What do you mean?

Julian: Did you hold back some of your punch?. I think we’re making progress!

Mayor: I was on my way to ask about hiring your depressed ghost intern to help the town when not only did you two decide to talk about burning the only thing that's keeping Collin alive! You also told them where the information about Oliver is!

Julian: I don’t recall giving away any of Coco’s personal information tonight.

Mayor: No, but Coco had the great idea of telling everyone where information about Oliver's location could be.

Coco: His laptop?

Mayor: Now the powers that be are gearing up as we speak to raid your house.

Coco: Oh.

Mayor: Oh is right genius. The only reason they aren't on their way right now is because of this mist.

Julian: So you're telling us that the plague mist is saving us?

Mayor: However you want to interpret it, I don't care. I'm here to give you a heads up. If you two don't find some kind of leverage by the time this fog lets up. Then I'm gonna have to find two new radio hosts.

Julian: That would be a shame.

Coco: What can we use for leverage?

Mayor: If you want my advice, your best bet is to recover that laptop before they do.

Julian: Any other less morbid information you want to share?

Mayor: Yeah just one. Coco, be careful of who you call your friends. It's hard to trust a man with no past.

Coco: What do you mean by that?

Mayor: I listen to your broadcasts, I know who visited you, here catch, you deserve to know something. 

(the sound of papers hitting a desk) 

Coco: What's this?

Mayor: Julian's file. I have one for everyone in this town, enjoy.

Julian: Leaving so soon?

Mayor: I could say I would love to stay, but that would be a lie. Also, there's some girl outside your door holding a baby. You might want to check that out.

Julian: Yeah, she's a fan.

Mayor: And Julian, stop dragging people down with you.

Julian: Thanks for the visit! Come back anytime!

(Footsteps can be heard trailing off.)

Julian: Well that was strange, right Coco? Coco?

Coco: What is this?

Julian: What do you mean?

Coco: There's almost nothing here! It’s mostly blank!  It doesn't even list your last name!

Julian: So you’re saying I'm mysterious?

Coco: Please can you just stop with the jokes for one second?  It says here you arrived at the town two weeks after the town's disappearance.

Julian: I was fashionably late.

Coco: What is with you and not ever giving a straight answer! Please, just leave me alone. I have work to do.

Julian: Coco.

Coco: Stop! look around you! I am going to be killed by the government if-

Julian: Those in power.

Coco: I'm done.

Julian: C'mon Coco. Coco? Where are you going?

Coco:  I'm going to the basement with Allison and wait until either the plague is over or those in power kill me.

Julian: What about finding leverage?

Coco: What about it? The best lead is at my house and there's no way I can get there. Face it, Julian, it's over.

Julian: Coco I have a plan.

Coco: There's never a plan Julian. It's just your way of pretending you're in control. That's all you are. Just a half-lie.

Julian: Coco, please.

Coco: take care, Julian.

(Silence)

Julian: Well listeners come back next week for another Beautiful episode of- Wait. Where's my gun at. It was in this drawer. Wait. Coco, please don't do anything hasty!

(Static for about three minutes, followed by a gunshot and more crackling silence.)

Julian: (A deep breath) Dear listeners, I have some troubling news. I tried to go to the basement with the rest of my team, but my dear co-host, Oliver… (a small sniffle can be heard) shot at me. He completely missed, either because of bad aim or it was just a warning shot, I’m gonna say it's the latter. However, I have never seen my team’s morale as low as this. As team captain, I have to make a stand. As host of Tales from Port-Land, I must risk it all for my team! My dear, sweet listeners, I'm going to do something that if my co-host was here, would say is reckless. I'm going to get Coco’s laptop back. I don’t know when I’ll be back but with any luck dear listeners, both of us will be here next week. Stay safe out there. This is your host Julian, signing off.

I was born in a town far away from civilization, and it was unlike any town in the world. When I was born, I was treated just like any other baby in the world, and I thought then that I'm gonna become a succesful man that will live a peaceful life.

You must know that the only world I ever knew was my house, because the entire people of that town never went out from their homes only when in need. So, I tried to actually go out outside to feel that fresh air that I have been craving for and to feel the sun in my skin. And since I was a good boy, I first asked my parents the permission to go out.

They told me that this town is inhabited by unknown creatures, and whoever dares to escape this town mysteriously disappears. But since I was ignorant at that time, I thought they were just telling me a story to scare me out of going out in fear of losing me. But I  still hated being locked in that house since I'll often get bored very quickly.

So I decided one day to sneak out of the house without my parents knowing, and so I did that and it was the biggest mistake of my life. The day after, my dad was fixing his and my mom's bedroom door and my mom was cooking lunch, and so I decided to execute my plan. When I went out, man, it was the best feeling ever!

And after a few moments of peace and silence, I decided that I will secretly go out of the house everyday to discover this place, and so I did that. Since I was a little scared from the story that told me my parents yesterday, I only stayed for a few minutes just admiring nature.

And everyday I began to get further and further from my house, until I reached a place that looked like a road and I couldn't even see any house and I was juste surrounded by mountains.

Also, I began to slowly getting to know the people there, and I was even receiving requests from them to deliver for them food or people that wanted to send letters to their loved ones since I learned every detail of the paths, roads, where did people live etc.

One night, I was with my friends in small food shop, I remember that a BIG snake jumped and I barely dodged it, and was hissing so agressively that I ran out of there the fastest I can.

I got to the road that I told you before, and I encountered a man riding a horse that stopped when I got there and I remember exactly that he let out an evil laugh that caused a series of events I almost got PTSD from.

When he let out that laugh, I was sort of confused, I did not know why was he laughing and my gut told me that this man is no joke. I was beginning to feel a sense of very severe dread that I almost passed out. I immediately sprinted to my house and was hearing the gallops of his horse behind me.

I ran and ran and was beginning to feel that something is off. Why was it taking so long to get to my house? am I being influenced by some sort of invisible force that is altering my sense of time? That's when it hit me.

I remembered the story about the unknown creatures that inhabited this town, and that they were somehow influencing me to try to trap me. And I soon as I realized that, I found myself in front of my house's door, and the man in the horse that was chasing me also disappeared.

Luckily, when I entered, I explained everything to my parents and they didn't get angry at me or grounded me. So for a few days, I stayed at my house to rest a little bit.

And when those days passed, I was thinking about happened, and I decided to begin researching about those unknown creatures with my friends, and we made a sort of "organization" with the goal of researching and studying those unknown creatures.

And after a little bit of investigation and studying, we found out that those creatures are highly intelligent and are capable of altering their prey's mind to trap them and feed on them. And we slowly began to recrute other people, and we got bigger and bigger.

So one day, I decided that we should develop our way of studying, since we were getting information about those creatures by people who tell us their encounters with those creatures, so we decided that we will begin to send workers in the "organization" to get more reliable information about the creatures.

And since we knew that those creatures will be very deadly, we decided to try and make weapons effective against them.

So we tried with normal weapons, the first one being a hunting rifle from a neighbor, and we tasked someone to climb the mountain with the rifle and an other that will be bait.

We waited for 30 minutes, and then, the man with the rifle in the mountain told us that he's beginning to feel a weird presence, and so we thought it was the creature's presence. But the man that was the bait for the creature did not tell us anything but that he was feeling like that time is slowing down.

And so we thought that the creature makes itself invisible and unnoticed for it's prey to catch it with ease.

And then we began to hear gunshots, and lots of... screams. Human screams. When we went out to observe what happened, we found out that both the sniper and the bait dissapeared. And the last thing we heard in the radio of the sniper was : "Bullets don't even scratch it! Oh god! It can change it's form!".

And we decided from that any type of weapons is ineffective against it, and that we should probably make a list of rules for everyone to follow to reduce the increasing number of missing probably dead people in the town. And from all of the research and studying we did, we made a list of rules that we will distribute to everyone.

And those rules are :

1. Do not under any circumstance go out of your home at night. The creatures at night are more active and more powerful.
2. Every 30 days, the creatures become even more deadly and more in number for an entire 24 hours. It is recommended to stay inside your house the entirety of those 24 hours.
3. If you need to go out of your house, do so only in between 6:00 AM to 12:00 AM. We have determined that the creatures are less active in that time of the day.
4. If a man going by the name of "Ryan" or "Josh" knocks on your door, do not open it. If his name is Ryan, he will stop after 20 minutes. If his name is "Josh", he will stop after 10 minutes but will begin trying to break the door open for 3 minutes so it is recommended to barricade the door.
5. If you ever go out from 10:00 AM to 12:00 AM, you may encounter your "neighbor" walking besides you and will try to get you to talk. Whatever you do, do not even stutter a word.
6. If you ever feel like time is beginning to slow down when coming back to your home, run as fast as you can to your home and do not focus on the time.
7. If you ever go out after 12:00 AM, the door will close behind by itself and you won't be able to open it no matter what. And every human will disappear. Ignore that, and try to go to the farthest house from yours while praying the creatures won't catch you. The door will be unlocked and the keys will be behind the door to lock it.
8. If any of your family members appears to have been lost or missing, do not try to search for them.
9. Do not trust your watch's time when going out, even your sense of time whether it is slowed down or normal. Try only coming back the fastest you can.
10. It is very often to see a family member or a friend when going out. But do not try to interact with them in any way.

The only thing we know about them is :

They are highly intelligent shapeshifting creatures/entities who can 'infect' a part of their prey's mind, and will try to get their prey to interact with the infected half to take over their mind and kill them.

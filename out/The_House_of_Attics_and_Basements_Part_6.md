“Welcome to the other world, Steve” said Emily as I stepped out into the light. She wore a wry half-smile that told me she was genuinely happy to see me.

“He was here,” I said, and her smile quickly faded. “I think he’s gone, but I–”

She shook her head. “He’s getting bolder. Maybe it means he’s getting ready to–” She didn’t have to finish her sentence. “When he came for my mom, she could tell something was closing in. It drove her crazy. She was the one who found the clock, you know? Followed his footsteps up to the attic–”

“Wait,” I said. “So there’s a clock in your attic too? Have you gone through?”

“We’ll get to that,” she said. “My mom–she was the one who figured out how the clocks worked, practically by accident. Well, accident and a whole lot of research. She decided to try the basement one, even spied on you a couple of times herself.  I knew I could at least go through there and not get vaporized. But… my attic? Who knows where that one goes? Right into the Traveler’s living room? What if he’s got like ten bear traps and a shotgun with a tripwire pointed at the clock on his end?”

We heard footsteps from above, and a voice called down.

“Emily? Is someone here?”

Layla Green had descended the stairs a few paces and was looking at us now, slightly puzzled. 

“Oh, Stephen. I thought you’d left.”

“I–needed to talk to Emily about something,” I said.

“Do try to keep it civil,” she said. “Remember that, beneath it all, you love each other.”

With that, the old woman ascended the stairs and was gone.

“Cool, well, that worked,” said Emily. She opened the pantry and pulled out a pack of Gummy Bears. She held up the box and smiled. “Did you know that in your world, they have lime instead of green apple? Kind of a mindfuck, right? Like, that’s one hell of a flap of a butterfly’s wings.”

She offered up another green bear.

I shook my head. “Got anything to drink?”

“Sorry, Steve-o, but the good Senator has both feet firmly planted on the wagon. Hasn’t had a drop since he was 23. Believe me, he brings it up in just about every other campaign speech. Honestly, though, you could probably use a night off. Don’t think those Sharpie lines are working too well for you. You know, the first few visits to your place, whenever I took a few sips, I’d just fill it back to the line with a little water from the sink.”

“How old are you?” I asked.

“Thirteen. Why? When did you start drinking?”

I decided to change the subject. I could tell she was avoiding the real issue.

“What happened to her?” I asked. “To Maya?”

She looked away from me, avoiding my eyes and she mindlessly swallowed a gummy bear whole.

“She died,” she said. “Horribly. Did you want to hear the gruesome details?”

“I think I need to.”

She picked up her phone, typed something in, and then tossed it over to me. 

“Read for yourself,” she said. Then she settled onto the couch and switched the channel to Bravo, which seemed to be airing a reality show about former prisoners of war getting makeovers with one of the Real Housewives of Tampa Bay.

I opened a link for the New York Post and began to read:

NEW EVIDENCE REVEALED IN SENATOR’S WIFE’S MURDER

While the murder of Maya Walker remains unsolved, an anonymous source FBI is finally releasing key details that they hope will lead to witnesses coming forward. 

According to a statement taken from the Senator himself, Ms. Walker was discovered just after 6:30 am in the guest bedroom of the family home, where she’d been residing due to marital issues. Her body was found cleanly decapitated, with both arms tied securely to the headboard of her bed. A lack of trauma to the wrists and remainder of the body seemed to indicate that the corpse had been posed post-mortem

Accompanying the body, was a note with a child’s nursery rhyme:

Hickory dickory dock.

The mouse ran up the clock.

The clock struck one,

The mouse ran down,

Hickory dickory dock.

According to sources with inside knowledge of the case, the desecrated corpse was found by the Walkers’ young daughter, Emily, who then alerted the rest of the house.

The search for Ms. Walker’s head has so far come up empty, and authorities speculate that the killer may have kept it as a trophy. Some within the department dismissed the idea that the killing could be a work of a serial killer, claiming that the targeting of Ms. Walker felt highly personal, but others disagreed, citing the note as well as the brutality of the crime.

I looked up from my reading.

“He was taunting us,” said Emily, not taking her eyes off the TV. “He’s still taunting us.”

“Did he leave other notes?” I asked.

“Not notes, but he left little signs, mostly for my dad. A bullet from a gun whose caliber doesn’t exist here. A tiny statue of a god with a baboon. An hourglass with no sand in it. Every one of the little offerings tied with a lock of my mother’s hair.”

“And your dad? What did he–”

“Oh, we’ve had the FBI over on several occasions. Extra security. But… my dad won’t even go in the basement or the attic. Practically turns purple if I try to talk about the clock. Maybe he thinks that if we don’t talk about it, it isn’t real. At some point, I just stopped trying to reason with him. Plus, I don’t want him getting in the way of my plans.”

“Plans?”

She took the knife out of her pocket, flipping it open, and casually examining it in the sterile blue light of the television.

“You asked earlier about the attic. Well, I’m going. Up where *he* lives. And this time, I’ll be hunting him.”

She looked over at me and smiled.

“So what do you say, Steve? Are you coming with me?”

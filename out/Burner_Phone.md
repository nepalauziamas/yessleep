Hendricks was cruising along in the old warehouse district when he saw something silvery shining on the ground. He just had to get out of his car and see. The mystery item was a cell phone. 

A Samsung LX one. Now this was something to celebrate, LX ones were five hundred dollars and change. A top of the line cell phone was just lying on the ground just for me, he thought. Then he started to get scared. Why would someone leave such a high end item on the ground? He wondered.

Hendricks looked at the screen like he was checking out a girl. Oh baby, look at your icons and large screen, Hendricks thought while ogling the phone. It had a slight scorch mark on the back. Did he smell smoke? Hendricks looked around for flames or something burning but he could see nothing. He put the lucky find in his pocket and drove off to the meet.

Hendricks is a mule for Mr. Dumbroski, Mr. D. His guys gave Hendricks stuff and he just delivered it. Yeah, it was just stuff, Hendricks knew better than to open the sealed boxes. He just picked it up and dropped it off. No names either. If the cops or rival gangs got him, he had no names to tell.

Today, he did not care if they made him wait for a few hours. He had a cell phone to discover. There were a lot of pictures in the picture gallery. Porn or pictures of cars would be cool.

No, it was at first, pictures of burned buildings. Hendricks was not liking those. The next set was photos of buildings on fire. Some of them actually looked kinda pretty. Bright orange flames against the navy blue night sky, that had a nice color combo. He wondered what sort of person would take such pictures though.

The last bunch was the worst, corpses. Burned bodies, a hundred plus pictures of bodies that had been ravaged by flames. That just made him queasy. Those pictures were just freakin' gross, he thought while trying to calm his stomach. Hendricks could not wait to hit the delete all pictures button.

He could see the thugs carrying white plastic bags of the product. He opened the trunk. Hendricks reluctantly put the cell phone away. He thought he smelled something burning but a quick look around showed no flames or smoke. After the car was loaded up, he drove away.

Three hours later, the delivery was done. He spent some time doubling back and checking for tails but there were none. At the destination, they paid him five hundred. Hendricks was done for the day. He had enough time to look for some action. Yeah, some free action. Hendricks was going to keep some of that money around for a bit longer.

Hendricks had dabbled in becoming an artist but it required too much discipline and he did not really had any ideas worth painting. Talking about painting on the other hand, was another story. The phone rang in his pocket. It felt kinda warm while it was ringing. Hendricks did not want to answer the phone unless the people calling were going to pay for the ticket. He will get back to them.

The Artist's Quarter always had a party somewhere. After he parked the car, Hendricks checked his voice mail. The phone number was blanked out, that made him feel nervous for some reason. The message sounded like crackling flames. He listened to it a few times before deleting it. Probably a wrong number. A nice leisurely walk netted him a party. It was up several flights of stairs, no big deal.

Inside, the floral scented candles caught Hendrick's eye first. They were placed in bowls with water at the bottom. Who ever set up this party had made sure the candles would not start a fire. Hendricks schmoozed with the few guests and had some warm beer and tasteless party food. The artwork was sub par too. The women were not bad looking. Maybe Momma Me Only and her four sisters would have the night off? The cell phone in his pocket made an incoming mail chime.

“Does anyone else smell smoke?” A skinny red headed woman asked while she looked around for signs of a fire.

So far, no one could smell smoke. Sniffy Red started to do her best imitation of a scent hound. She stopped next to Hendricks and sniffed, he could see her nostrils expand and contract. This was not going to be his best party experience.

“Its you!” She triumphantly shrilled while pointing at Hendricks.

“Did you get your clothes at a fire sale?” Sniffy Red asked with contempt while she folded her arms under her scant bosom.

Hendricks raised his hands in a placating gesture and tried to be diplomatic, “Lady, you have the wrong guy.”

Sniffy called some of her female friends over with a jerky wave of her pipe cleaner thin arms. They confirmed that the smoky smell came from Hendricks. He had to leave.

Hendricks went by his favorite Chinese takeout restaurant and then went home. Being kicked out of a party by a skinny redhead had soured his mood. He sniffed his clothing again, no smoky smell here. The evening ended with TV, sleep and nightmares...

Sniffy Red was throwing another party or maybe the one she kicked him out of was still going on. A burning female hand touched the curtains lightly. The curtains went up in a sheet of flame. Hendricks wondered what was going on. Another burning hand grabbed a bottle of booze and splashed the guests. A second later they were burning and screaming... 

Hendrick's waking screams blended in with the sounds of the fire engine's sirens as they passed his building. His cell phone received more mail.

Hendricks was done with sleep that night. He checked out the new message. Just more pictures for his picture gallery. No pictures of cars or porn, even a bunch of fuzzy kitten pictures would be better than this batch of flaming bodies and buildings. Of course there was no info on who sent these pictures. The last picture was the worst, it showed a big breasted flaming woman. Even through the flames he could see her cheery smile or grimace. Delete this effin' crap now, he thought.

Dawn's early light shone on a sleeping Hendricks and his new phone. He had removed all of the previous owner's info and added new ring tones, games and even wallpapers. The previous wallpaper was just too burned looking for him. The last step was to move his sim card to the new phone. He had worries that it would not work but the card went in with no problems. Sleep sneaked in and took Hendricks.

Later in the morning while Hendricks was eating breakfast, his phone rang. He was happy it was using his new stuff. Looks like he will have to deliver stuff to some guy out on West Island. This was going to be an all day trip. He was still buzzed about his new phone and maybe he could take some pictures while he was out there.

The drive down to the pickup area was boring. Hendricks preferred boring to exciting. Usually, excitement is bad. The thugs that loaded the car gave him funny looks but he ignored them. When Hendricks drove away he thought he heard one of them ask the other one if he smelled something burning.

One of the reasons he hated the trip out to West Island was that he could not enjoy the scenery. Nope, Hendricks had to watch for tails. That took most of his concentration. Most of the trip there and back would be an anxious ride through Paranoia Town.

The drive to the delivery point was a blue sky, green tree blur broken up by white house blurs. If it did not show up in the street, Hendricks did not care. His attention was focused on the front and the rear window looking for tails.

Finally, he was at the delivery point, Hendricks took a picture using his phone.

The guy lived in a nice light pink and white house with two levels. A green hedge blocked the view of the ocean and the rest of the building. All Hendricks could see of the house was the second floor balcony. At ground level, there was just a black gate with hedges on both sides.

He honked his horn. After too many minutes, the guy showed up. Hendricks got a good look at the red eyes and shaky hands. Something about that made him more anxious. This may not turn out good, he thought. Hendricks got out of the car and confronted the unsteady guy.

“You have my money right?” Hendricks asked pointedly while he leaned into the guy.

“Yeah, yeah,” The guy said dismissively and sniffled. His hands twitched so bad it looked like he was being electrocuted.

Hendricks knew for certain this guy was using. Just as he knew the sun would rise in the morning.

“Yo, Scarface! Why don't you pay me now?” Hendricks asked with anger. Dealers that use usually have money flow problems, and Hendricks was not in the mood to be stiffed.

Fear flitted across Scarface's face. He was scared. Mr. D had little tolerance for User Dealers. Scarface reached into his pocket with a trembling hand.

“What the hell man? Do you want to get arrested?” Hendricks screamed at him in surprise.

Even to a blind person this would look like a drug deal. This guy was really messed up. Scarface walked into his house and motioned Hendricks to follow. Reluctantly, He followed. Maybe Scarface had a gun and it will be over with a gunshot?

Scarface's house was well on its way to the hoarder's version of not so good homes and gardens. Empty food containers and other boxes were piled up on tables and the floor. The smell was not so good too, seems like things were rotting somewhere. Hendricks was not the neatest guy but this was pretty bad. He lifted his foot, did he step in something sticky?

Scarface pawed through his wallet with trembling hands. He gave all of the contents to Hendricks. 

Hendricks counted the money. Scarface was short a hundred. “You are short a hundred! You know what my fee is? DO you want me to call Mr D?” Hendricks asked with fury, his face turning red. He did not want to ball up his fists so he stuck his sweaty hands to his side. Hendricks did not like being ripped off.

Scarface looked scared again and mumbled something. He looked at the floor, and then back at Hendricks. Scarface took off his watch, and gave it to Hendricks. The metal armband jingled in the quivery grasp.

It was a fine silver and black watch, but Hendricks was still annoyed. One way to attract the attention of the cops was to flash stuff that was above your income bracket. He would have to sell it to a fence; more dancing around to get his money. Today was sliding towards the toilet really fast, Hendricks thought. He took some time to scrape whatever he stepped on off of his shoes. This stuff better not smell when he gets in the car, he thought!

Seeing Scarface's look of hunger when Hendricks opened the trunk of his car, and helping him carry the bags in was the icing on the crap cake. Hendricks breathed a sigh of relief when Scarface's ocean side ranch house faded into the background. That transaction could have gone so south.

Now the rest of the crap cake was going to be served up to him in the long wait to cross the West Island bridge during rush hour. For fifteen to twenty minutes, cars would just sit like they were parked. Then they would move a foot, and sit for another long bit.

Well at least, he had some games to play to pass the time. Hendricks went to the game library on the phone. It was empty because the phone ran out of memory. He did not have to guess what was taking up the memory, he knew. More pictures of burned things. His wireless plan didn't support downloads this far out. He sighed. This was going to be one long boring ride back.

By the time Hendricks got home with his greasy bags of food, it was late. He deleted the pictures again, and started downloading games again. This new phone to him more trouble than his old phone was. The fact that the games got nuked because the photo gallery was so big bugged him. Hendricks threw himself into bed...

Hendricks was standing next to the ocean close to dusk. It seemed like a pretty nice dream. The ocean smelled pretty good until notes of charred plastic and burnt flesh started showing up. He looked up the beach, and saw a house on fire. 

Some guy was running towards him screaming. It was Scarface! While he was howling in burning agony, Scarface made a beeline for the roaring ocean waves. 

Hendricks expected to see the flames being doused by the water, but no such luck. Poor Scarface burned like a star even when he went deeper under the waves. The nightmare changed, Hendricks found himself at a table in a resort.

This would have been a pretty cool place, but everything was on fire. The pool was a lake of orange flame with screaming swimmers surfacing among the burning waves. Hendricks sat on a hot chair, the burning metal was seared his back and behind. For some unknown reason, he couldn't get up. 

The large breasted woman sat across the table from him. She was a bluish black corpse with a dazzling white smile. She reached under the table, and touched his crotch. Pain blossomed between his legs and Hendricks howled. The nightmare changed again.

He was in his apartment, and it was on fire. Hendricks was burning too. The pain was so horrible. He crawled over to his window to see if he could jump. The fire made his muscles feel stiff and unresponsive. Outside everything was on burning. The sky was full of orange red flames, it rained down into the street. The apartment across from his building was on fire too. The burning big breasted woman was there. Blue flames danced in her eyes while she smiled her bright smile at him...

Hendricks woke up screaming. He was so loud, his next door neighbor curse and banged on the wall. Eventually the screams turned to sobs. Hendricks stumbled to the bathroom. He just had to see if he was a burned corpse. Other than having slightly pink skin, he was OK. A few seconds of confused thinking brought him to the conclusion that the new phone was responsible. It was the only new thing in his life.

Hendricks was not a superstitious person. All of the weird goings on seemed to start when he picked up the phone. Even though he really did not want to do it, Hendricks decided to go back to his old phone. He dug it out of his top drawer. The new phone was brought over to the kitchen table. I just have to open up the new phone and swap the sim card back to my old phone, Hendricks thought.

The back of the new phone was totally smooth. He remembered pressing on a button and moving a panel to expose the sim card section. A chill raced down Hendrick's back. Now things were even more strange. The phone made a incoming mail chime. It was back to using the original chime not the one Hendricks downloaded.

Hendricks wondered for a second about who could help him before he remembered his cousin, Ellen. Her knowledge of the paranormal would be useful. It was late but Hendricks got lucky. Ellen was still home, and awake. He promised to be at her house in a half hour. A feeling of relief filled Hendricks. Maybe he can fix this before things got worse. Hendricks left his apartment without the phone.

He was about to open the car door when he felt a familiar weight in his left pocket. Hendricks slowly reached into his pocket, and pulled out his new cursed phone. Foreboding settled over him like a too tight dirty suit. He placed the phone carefully on the sidewalk like it was wired to explode. No way was Hendricks going to think about how something that he left behind in his apartment had gotten into his pants pocket. Ellen was going to help him deal with that. Hendricks drove away.

Almost there. Just a few more blocks and he could get some help. Something made an incoming call chime in the passenger seat next to Hendricks. He did not want to look. Almost against his will, his head slowly turned. He just had to see and know! The silvery shiny torturer was lying in the car seat next to him.

Hendricks was so full of rage, he grabbed the offending item, and hurled it into an alley. The phone bounced off a wall, and fell into an open dumpster. He screamed,”Three pointer!” Hendricks drove off.

Two more blocks and he would be safe. For some reason, Hendricks smelled something burning. The last thing he saw were two eyes as bright as blue Bunsen burner flames and a smile radiant as an arc welder's torch's exhaust. She embraced him, and he was covered in flames. The car smashed through a wall. It hit a container of flammable substances. Hendricks screamed for a very very long time...

Two minutes earlier.

Marta was scavenging in the old industrial area when she found a new cellphone. She felt that her life was going to change for the better with her new Samsung LX One.

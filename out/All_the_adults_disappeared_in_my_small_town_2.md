I was horrified. I was running away from someone or something. I don’t know what it was but It was hungry. The thing didn’t sound nor feel human, “how did it all come to this?” I thought to myself. When I got far enough away from whatever was chasing me, I hid.


 As I sat inside that bush, I thought. “It’s been sixteen months since they birthed this world into a new chaos, and it’s been sixteen months since the day my life changed forever”; I was looking at the bodies of my late parents, and I recall smiling.


 It was a befitting death for the tyrant of a dad I had. Their bodies were split open, with all of their organs missing. Some of the skin on my father's face was chewed off, and I viewed it to be relatively recent.


 I glanced to the side to face my mother, and I frowned. “She didn’t deserve to die like this”, I remember thinking to myself. I walked to her lifeless body. Maggots invaded her rotted carcass, which laid out on the couch. 

I couldn’t stand seeing her like this. It wasn’t right. I had picked my mom’s stiff corpse off of where she laid and gave her a burial befitting of the kindness she possessed. After spending some time at my mother’s new burial sight I heard a loud crash followed by a blood-curdling scream. 


I was in shock. I had no clue what was going on, but I knew I needed to hide, so I took cover behind the giant stack of wood in my backyard and tried to listen for anything else. There was a conversation going on in the house where my father laid dead. 


“Where the hell is she?!” the voice i heard was heavy and frightening but I could hear the immaturity in his tone, “he has to be around my age” I thought to myself, “I don’t know but someone was here” it was the voice of a woman that replied to him, she sounded seductive, as if she could force any man go crazy with just a few words, “We have to find her, the woman was just ripe enough to be harvested”, I listened to his words in confusion “what does he mean by harvested?”, I asked myself.


 I was so deep in thought at his words that I didn’t notice that they had found me. He had a sledgehammer in his hand and he struck it down towards my head. I instinctively rolled from the glimmer of the hammer in the burning sun, “WHO THE HELL ARE YOU!” he screamed in an almost surprised sounding tone, I decided it was best to not give him a reply, instead I made the split second decision to get the hell out of there, but as soon as I tried to make a break for it but before i could move I heard a loud thump and I was on the ground. I could feel the blood flowing from my head, my vision was covered in a beautiful veil of crimson, and I was losing consciousness.

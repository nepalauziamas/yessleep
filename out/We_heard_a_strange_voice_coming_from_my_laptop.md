We couldn’t believe it at first. No matter what my boyfriend and I tried - held down the power button, plugged it out of the wall, took out the battery, and so on - my laptop just wouldn’t shut down. 

The screen was frozen and not responding. But it baffled us how that thing kept working without electricity. And for three days straight!

I had it for more than 14 years at that point. Jordan always teased me to get a new one. I guess he got annoyed having to fix it every now and then.

“You’re probably the last person on Earth that still uses Windows XP”, he often joked.

But I loved the old thing and I intended to use it until it finally dies or falls apart in my lap. I didn’t care that it was slow as hell and struggled when multiple tabs were opened in the browser.

Come to think about it now, I’m not entirely sure why I was so attached to it.

It was good enough for what I needed, I guess. And to be honest, I didn’t want to spend money on buying a new one yet.

As I said, the laptop sat frozen and miraculously “alive” on our coffee table for three days. The fan huffed and puffed incessantly and the computer got hotter than usual.

Even in our bedroom, with the door closed, we could hear it. 

Things took a weird turn on the third night around 3 a.m. 

“Grace, do you hear that?” Jordan asked.

It sounded like someone was talking quietly in the living room and the sound mixed with the fan noise. 

“Hmm.. yeah. What is that?” I said all groggy.

We got up, went to the coffee table, and stood there in silence, listening.

It seemed like the laptop’s speakers were picking up a feeble radio signal. It was a male voice reciting something, but we couldn’t make out the words.

We both kneeled and positioned our ears near the speakers. 

“It’s definitely not English,” Jordan said.

We both were pretty sure we heard the word *RETRO*. But it was difficult to pick out anything else. 

“I have an idea,” said Jordan.

He went to get his toolkit and started undoing the little screws on the laptop’s underside. Carefully, he took out the fan and it stopped spinning at last.

We could hear the man on the speakers somewhat better but the sound was still distant and there was some buzzing interference.

I grabbed a pen and paper and started writing down the words. I managed to catch this partial sentence:

*… WA DE RETRO SATANA…*

It turned out that was enough. A quick google search revealed that it was actually “Vade retro satana” or “Begone, Satan” in Latin and was part of an exorcism formula that, when translated into English, went:

“May the Holy Cross be my light. May the dragon never be my guide. Begone, Satan. Never tempt me with your vanities. What you offer me is evil. Drink the poison yourself.”

And the words in Latin matched what the man was chanting over the speaker.

I was getting kind of excited about this mystery, to be honest. Though, we still weren’t sure if someone was messing with us.

The man just repeated the same formula - with a booming but distant voice - and nothing else, pausing every now and then.

I could feel the heat radiating from the laptop. Jordan said he was curious to see how long it will last without a fan.

We were still whispering for some reason.

“What do you think this is?” I said. 

Jordan scratched his beard, “Well, either we’re somehow overhearing an exorcism, or, more likely, it’s a scene from some movie or a radio play, I guess. But I don’t understand how the laptop’s speakers are picking this up.”

We continued listening and at times we thought we could hear other voices in the background.

Jordan studied the piece of paper on which I wrote the verses.

“VADE RETRO SATANA,” he read the words out loud. Perhaps he realized there was no point in whispering.

And to our surprise, the man stopped speaking abruptly.

We looked at each other, confused and waiting. And for a moment I thought the sound had ceased completely. But the man muttered something unintelligible and then spoke loud and clear. In English.

“I SHALL NOT LISTEN TO THEE, DEVIL. GO BACK WHERE YOU CAME FROM.”

“Y-you can hear us?!” said Jordan.

“I COMMAND THEE TO LEAVE THIS GIRL,” the man said with a thundering voice.

“Well, I command you to leave my laptop!” I yelled back.

“LAPTOC? IS THAT THY NAME, DEMON?”

“Who are you?” Jordan asked.

“I’M A SERVANT OF GOD ALMIGHTY. I WILL NOT GIVE THEE MY NAME, DEMON. DO NOT TRY TO TRICK ME.”

“Fine, I guess we’ll just call you Dan,” said Jordan. “Look, Dan, can you please tell us where you are and what are you doing?”

“SILENCE! EVERY NIGHT YOU TORMENT THIS HONEST FAMILY WITH YOUR HELLISH MOANS AND CRIES. LEAVE!”

“We’re doing no such thing,” I said. “And we’re *not* demons!”

“YOU USE THIS POOR GIRL’S MOUTH TO SHOUT MOST UNNATURAL CRIES. WITH HER HANDS AND BLOOD YOU PAINT YOUR DEVIL SYMBOLS ON THE WALLS.”

“Again, I have no clue wh-” I started saying.

Jordan raised his index finger, “Erm… what’s on the wall, Dan?”

“YOU KNOW WHAT YOU WROTE, LAPTOC.”

A slight hint of burnt plastic was coming from the laptop. It was so hot at that point that I couldn’t hold my hand on it for long.  

“Okay, okay… we… *I* promise to leave this girl and her family alone if you answer truthfully to my questions. Alright?”

“What the fuck are you doing, Jordan?” I whispered.

“Let’s just see where this goes, okay?” he said defensively.

“I DO NOT MAKE DEALS WITH HELLSPAWN, NOW LE–”

And that’s the first time we heard another voice talk to us besides Dan’s. It was a woman.

“PLEASE, I’LL ANSWER WHAT YOU WANT INSTEAD OF THE PRIEST. JUST LEAVE MY CHILD ALONE.”

Jordan and I looked at each other. My boyfriend then shrugged and said loudly to the laptop: “DEAL.”

I slapped his wrist disapprovingly, but deep inside I also wanted to know how this played out. 

“Alright,” said Jordan. “First, what year is it?”

There was some back and forth between the woman and the priest, we assumed, but we couldn’t make out a thing.

Then the woman said, “THE YEAR OF OUR LORD 1898.” 

There was some muttering again. It seemed that the woman was reciting a small prayer.

“Are we listening to the past somehow?” I whispered.

“I-I don’t know,” he said.

“Ask them what’s on the wall.”

Jordan raised his voice, “What is written on the wall?”

The woman spoke again, “THERE ARE A LOT OF BOXES. AND ON TOP OF EACH ONE, IN THE RIGHT CORNER, THERE IS A SMALL CROSS…”

“Aha!” I said out loud. “See? How, can we be demons if there are crosses?”

The priest said, “TRICKS! THE DEVIL CAN EVEN QUOTE SCRIPTURE IF IT SUITS HIS PURPOSE.”

“Please, let the woman continue,” said Jordan.

”IN THE MIDDLE OF EACH BOX, IT SAYS ‘*A FATAL ERROR HAS OCCURRED, PRESS OK TO CONTINUE’*,” said the woman. “THEN THERE’S A SMALLER BOX UNDERNEATH WITH THE LETTERS O AND K.”

My jaw dropped. I’ve seen that before. We gaped at each other in disbelief.

Jordan pulled out his phone and, after a moment of googling, he said, “And the unnatural cries of your daughter, do they sound like this?”

Then he played the Windows XP error sound.

We heard a few screams. They really didn’t like it, it seemed.

“AYE, THAT’S THE CRY,” said the woman finally.

A thin wisp of smoke came from the sides of the laptop. The smell of burning plastic was almost unbearable. 

“And what is your name? And your daughter’s name? Where do you live?” asked Jordan.

Dan interjected before the woman could answer, “THAT’S ENOUGH, DEMON. I WILL NOT LET YOU TAKE THIS POOR WOMAN’S SOUL. NOW LEAVE AS YOU HAVE PROMISED.”

“Alright, alright,” said Jordan. “I’ll give you a… formula to recite. Okay? After you do so, I should be gone… At least I think so.”

“DO NOT ATTEMPT TO TRICK ME, LAPTOC. MY FAITH IS STRONG. I WILL NOT USE YOUR SPELLS.”

Jordan paused for a bit and then said, “Then let the mother do so. Say these words in order, okay? *ALT F FOUR*. You got that?”

The woman repeated the words loudly and without hesitation, despite the priest’s protests.

And it seemed to have produced some effect because a second later loud gasps came over the speakers. It sounded like there were more people in that room than I first thought. One of them shouted, “WITCHCRAFT”.

“What’s happening? Tell us!” I said.

“A BOX HAS DISAPPEARED FROM THE WALL,” the woman said. “THAT PART IS NOW CLEAR AS THE DAY IT WAS PAINTED.”

“Repeat it again until all the boxes are gone and once more,” Jordan said.

And the woman did so, each time followed by a round of gasps.

“THERE IS DIFFERENT BOX NOW, AND IN THE MIDDLE IT SAYS ‘SHUT DOWN’--”

“Okay, I know what that is,” said Jordan. “Say the word ‘ENTER’. Just that one word.” 

The woman repeated the command and the speakers played the Windows shutdown sound. The laptop screen finally went black. 

Half a second later all hell broke loose. 

The laptop burst into flames. I ran to the kitchen to get water. 

Thick black smoke filled the apartment quickly and the acrid smell stung my throat.

I couldn’t see a thing. I fumbled through the smoke with a Tupperware full of water in one hand. 

But there was something wrong. The chairs and other furniture I held on to while trying to navigate the room did not have the same feel or shape to them.

Then I ran into Jordan, but when we collided I saw the face of a stranger. It was a clean-shaven middle-aged man with a clerical collar. He seemed to be equally scared and surprised to see me. 

I dropped the water on his feet and ran away, screaming, “Jordan, there’s someone here!”

I heard my boyfriend scream too and I followed his voice. I bumped into something and fell on a bed that was definitely not supposed to be in our living room. 

There was a girl on the bed who screamed when I fell on her. To my horror, I saw that her hands and feet were tied with rope. 

With a hoarse and tired voice, the child yelled, “IT’S YOU! HE’S GONNA TAKE YOU. AND US. WE’LL BE WITH HIM FOREVER.”

I was paralyzed with fear.

A moment later I felt hands grabbing my shoulders. I screamed like never before in my life. 

Then I heard Jordan’s voice behind me.

“Let’s go. Now!” he said.

We ran blindly and somehow managed to find a window. Jordan opened it and helped me get through. A few moments later we were outside breathing in the fresh air and coughing our lungs out. 

There wasn’t any fire that we cloud see inside, just thick black smoke.

The smoke was definitely something unnatural because it started disappearing just as fast as it manifested in the first place. We watched in disbelief as the thick black cloud retreated back inside the house, instead of gushing out the open window.

Peering inside, we could see it flowing to one central spot in the living room. Distorted screams came from the black gassy mass. 

I swear that at some point, as it shrank, the smoke formed the shape of a person. And then in a split second, it was gone. The screams cut off abruptly.

When we went back into the house, there was no fire damage nor blackened walls. And no one else was there.

We found a lump of molten plastic and metal on the coffee table where the computer stood.

I guess it really is time to buy a new laptop.

I’m not cut out for public speaking.  Maybe this is why I don’t do well with confrontation, either.  I feel like I’m making everything about me and I don’t like everything to be all about me.  There wasn’t much choice, though.  [The Rain Chasers had to know about the laundry lady.](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/vn7fcg/how_to_survive_college_guess_im_goth_now/)  It didn’t help that Maria was staring intently at me the entire time, and she looked *pissed*.  I tore my eyes off her and stared at the back of the room either, which didn’t help much either, because Patricia was back there with her cronies and she looked annoyed.

Kind of awesome how the only person that doesn’t actively hate me in the Rain Chasers is Katana Boy.

“Hi,” I squeaked.  “I’ve, uh, got some, uh, bad news.”

I had a rough idea of what I wanted to say.  Maybe I should have practiced beforehand, though, because I floundered through it for a while until someone near the middle of the room finally stuck a hand up.  I let him ask his question, grateful that I was no longer the only one talking, and somehow his simple request to back up and clarify something I kind of rushed through was enough to make me calm down.  Like this wasn’t an interrogation anymore with me standing up in front of everyone admitting how I put them all in danger.  It was a conversation.

Granted, it was a conversation about how they were all in danger, which isn’t actually all that much better if you think about it.  That point was lost on *no one.*  Least of all Patricia.

“Do you think this… laundry lady… will be targeting us, specifically?” she asked when I was done talking.

I told her that I didn’t know for certain, but I thought it was likely.  This was only my first semester, so I wasn’t close to *that* many people yet, but she’d said that there were so many people that hadn’t been tested yet.  I had to assume that meant acquaintances.

“What about friends and family back home?” Patricia asked.

I laughed.  I couldn’t help it - the mental image of her showing up back home was just too much.  I mean, I’m pretty sure that the old sheriff’s wife is the one that does all the laundry in their household.  Could you imagine someone showing up in *her* domain uninvited?  

Try it, laundry lady.  *I dare you.*

“They’ll be fine,” I said.  “Believe me - they’ll be fine.”

I could have added that these creatures typically can’t leave old land unless they’re from the cultures of the original inhabitants, but I didn’t want to get into those sorts of specifics at that time.  That’d lead to a discussion on how I knew such things and why I was speaking as if I’m an authority on the subject and it would just be a distraction.

Also, my hometown keeps a low profile about the inhuman, on account of all the deaths that have been covered up over the years, yanno.

“We need to warn the people that have class with you as well,” Patricia said thoughtfully.  “I think we all know that simply telling them won’t work, though.  If it did, we’d be the biggest club on campus.”

She took over the discussion at that point and I let her.  Look, I know you all don’t like her and I don’t like her either, but Patricia is still the best person in the club to organize people.  She has charisma.  I have all the stage presence of a wet sock.

They’d start a rumor, Patricia suggested.  Use the general discord channel to do it.  It would be just as I described - some lady was going around folding people’s laundry.  That was all.  They’d have a couple other people chime in at that point, people that were low-profile enough that they weren’t known to be a part of the Rain Chasers.  Someone would say they’d heard it was someone’s mom and that someone hurt her feelings by not putting the laundry away nicely.  Someone else would chime in that it was only the right thing to do, to respect the work she’d put into it.  Then someone *else* would add that they’d heard it was something… *else*… and not someone’s mom at all and terrible things happened to the person that didn’t put their laundry away properly.

Terrible things being sleeping through an exam or the clothes smelling of mildew the next day.  The sort of bad luck consequences that people don’t want to actually take their chances with.  It was counter-intuitive, Patricia said, but the more severe the outcome was the more likely people were to disregard the warning.  Like it was too horrible to be believable.  But bad luck?  Most students on campus believed in bad luck, especially when their grades were at stake.

I’m not going to lie, I was deeply relieved that someone had a plan.  I didn’t have one.  I went into that meeting just hoping that they’d listen.  What came after all depended on that, after all.  I lingered after the meeting broke up, intending to thank Patricia and to maybe ask her about what happened in the power plant.  Find out if she was still continuing her experiments.  There was a slim hope that she’d changed her tactics and there wasn’t anything to worry about.  Wishful thinking, I know.  But Patricia just paused to smile at me.

“It’s okay,” she said.  “We’ll take care of this.  It’s going to be fine.”

Then she walked off before I could say anything.  I felt… both relieved and annoyed at the same time.  Like… I don’t like being talked down to and I swear she was being patronizing.

Her cronies quickly followed her out.  That left just me and Maria in the room together.  Reluctantly, I turned to face her.  This was inevitable, I suppose.

“I read your message,” she said.  “I thought you were lying at first.”

I just stared at her.  What was I supposed to say?  I could barely talk about what happened, how could I argue with her over whether I was lying or not?

“But then I thought about how you handled the library and the steam tunnels,” Maria continued.  “I remember that you seemed… scared… but it wasn’t like you were panicking, either.  And you said you grew up around this and that people got killed so… yeah, I guess I do believe you.  Why didn’t you just tell me to begin with?”

There was a lump in my throat.  I thought my inability to talk about the student that drowned was because of the shock of seeing someone die so close like that, but it wasn’t the first time I’ve seen someone die, was it?  The memory of my ex-boyfriend came into my head, unexpectedly, of his lifeless body being pulled through the snow with a chain around his neck.

“My boyfriend died,” I said.  

It felt like I was pulling myself up onto a cliff edge.  One last burst of effort and then - then I was safe over the edge, panting and exhausted.

“Before I came here,” I continued, the words tumbling free now.  “He… I thought I’d marry him.  Someday.  Then he hit me and - I mean, it wasn’t even that *hard* \- it was just the *once* \-”

“It’s still wrong,” Maria said.

“I know!”  I took a deep breath.  “I know.  But it didn’t seem like something… there’s a lot of creatures out there that punish bad people, you know?”

“One of them got him?”

“Yeah.  Krampus.”

“Oh wow,” she said in awe.  “You’re not joking.  Krampus.  Wow.”

I closed my eyes.  I told her that I saw his body being dragged away.  She was the first person I’ve told about this, I continued.  I couldn’t stop myself now that it started.  I’d been keeping this secret from everyone back home because - because - I didn’t even know why anymore.  Because I didn’t want my family to worry about me or I didn’t want the whole town to think he was a bad person.

“But he was a bad person,” Maria said.

“They won’t believe me!” I finally exploded.

Then I started crying.  Maria awkwardly patted my shoulder and told me that it’d be okay, that I didn’t have to tell them shit if I didn’t want to.  I could tell her everything and we’d keep the secret together so I didn’t have to carry it all by myself.

“I don’t even know if they’ll blame me or if it’s all in my head,” I sobbed.  “Maybe I just think that because I don’t want to be a nuisance.”

“You know that there’s a campus counseling service you can go to, right?”

She said I should think about it, because that’s kind of a lot to deal with and she’s not very good at this sort of thing.  She’d be here to listen, but she didn’t really know how to give advice very well.  Listening was all she could do - but only if I actually talked to her about things.  

Which was a bit pointed.  It seemed like it was time to talk about the phone incident.

“My roommate did it to me,” I said, after apologizing for what I did.  “I wasn’t angry at her though, so I guess I thought it’d be okay if *I* did it.”

Maria looked confused, so I told her about Steven and how that ended.  

“I guess I should tell her she can’t do that anymore,” I sighed in conclusion.

“I don’t know, five minutes ago you were trying to minimize an abusive boyfriend.  I think I’m on Cassie’s side on this one.”

I still haven’t figured out if she was joking.

I didn’t get the chance to ask, either, for a noise from the windows silenced us both.  We both turned to watch as a handful of raindrops stuck against the pane of glass, glowing like amber in the last rays of the sunset.

“I’ve given up on the weather forecast,” Maria said dismally.  “It only seems to rain when it wants to screw us over.”

At least the union is open late.  I suggested we go downstairs and get some snacks while we waited for the rain to let up.  Unfortunately, everyone else in the union had the same idea, and the dining area was a bit more crowded than I’d anticipated.  I told Maria I didn’t feel up to being around a lot of people, as it’d been an emotional evening for me.  She suggested we take our food back upstairs.  She knew the room schedule and no one had it reserved after the Rain Chasers meeting.

I half expected Maria to pester me with questions, but instead she got out her laptop to work on homework.  I wasn’t in the mood to do work, so I sat near the window and ate my chicken tenders, watching the rain.  It’s little surprise that stories arose about the rain and those stories turned into something more *real*.  It feels like the sky has opened up its reservoirs and set them loose across campus, an endless waterfall that tries to drown out the streetlights.  It batters at the buildings, scratches at the windows, and knocks the breath of your lungs if you’re unlucky enough to be caught out in it.  The cold cuts through to the bone.  It’s the sort of storm that ushers in gods and demons.  The rain that will herald the apocalypse, the coming of Jörmungandr, or the flood that will scour all but the tallest of mountains.

It is terrible, fearsome, and enchanting.  I sat there watching it, chewing mechanically.  I wasn’t thinking much of anything.  I felt wrung-out and empty and I filled that hollowness with the light struggling to pierce through the curtains of water that cascaded down onto the pavement.

I froze in mid-bite of a chicken tender.  There was movement out there, but it wasn’t a student or anything else that walked upon the ground.

Something was moving through the air.  Through the rain.  Swimming through it, undulating up and down like a leaf being carried on a strong wind.  They stayed away from the lights so I could not see them clearly.  They were only dark shapes in the downpour, drifting gently through the night sky.

“Look at that,” I said, marveling.  

Was I seeing things?  I didn’t think I was.  Maria didn’t reply, so I glanced back at her.  She had headphones in.  I opened my mouth to call her name louder but I never got the words out.

One of them slammed against the glass.  I whipped around to stare at it, plastered to the window pane mere feet from where I sat.  The underside of its body stuck to the window, splattering ichor that was quickly washed away in the torrential rain.  I could see right through its body.  Its body was transparent, visible only through the distortion of the light along its gelatinous skin.  There were no organs, no veins, no bones.  Only teeth, set in three rows around a circular mouth that covered most of its belly.  It wobbled like jello as it chewed at the glass.

I stumbled backwards, cold sweat beading up on the back of my neck.

“Oh no,” Maria gasped, stumbling to her feet and thrusting her laptop into her backpack in panic.  “No no no.  Not these things.”

“What *are* they?”

Another one hit the glass.  It came in at a dive and splattered against it without hesitation, spreading its fleshy wings wide to fasten on.  The window rattled in its frame at the impact.

“The swimmers,” she replied nervously.  “They like to show up in the gym’s pool if you’re swimming after dark while it’s raining.”

“In the *pool*!?”

I haven’t been to the gym yet and I sure as hell am not going now.

More of them swooped down out of the sky and impacted against the glass.  It was because there were only two of us, I thought wildly.  Two of us that knew about the things out there in the dark.  We weren’t like all those students downstairs, secure in their numbers and their ignorance.  If we went downstairs, we’d be fine.  Surely they wouldn’t follow us.

Surely.

“Downstairs,” I said nervously.  “I think we’ll be okay down there.”

“There’s a *lot* more glass down there.”

“A lot more people too.”

She hesitated.  Then a third struck the middle window and the force of its impact, combined with the weight of its brethren, was enough to shatter the glass.  It cracked first, splitting in a spiderweb outwards, and then it collapsed inward and those creatures came with it.  They landed on the ground with a soft sucking noise and flailed their wings at us, trying to flop across the floor.  Their mouths worked furiously, the teeth grinding back and forth.  Like manta rays, I thought distantly.  They reminded me of manta rays.

“T-they can’t fly,” Maria gasped breathlessly.  “There’s no rain.”

She took a step forward.  That was enough to snap me out of my mesmerized fascination.  I snatched at her wrist and pulled her away.

“Fucking hell Maria,” I snapped.  “Those things could still take your foot off if you got too close.”

She looked skeptical, but then one surged forwards, using both wings to propel itself against the ground, and she shrieked and stumbled backwards out of range.  Its teeth latched onto the carpet instead and it shook it like a dog worrying a bone, ripping thick chunks of fiber off of the subfloor.

We made a hasty retreat to the door.  It should have been easy after that.  We would just go downstairs and we’d be safe among all the other students waiting out the rain.

Let me take a moment to explain how the rooms are laid out in the union.  The second floor is almost entirely general purpose meeting rooms.  They can hold anywhere from ten to fifty people, depending on which one you reserve.  They’re used by clubs and study groups and come with chairs and tables and not a lot else.

The interesting feature is that the interior wall is half glass.  There’s shades you can close for some privacy, but mostly people leave them open.  You can see straight into the hallway.  Maybe this isn’t that unusual, but it’s important for what happened next.

I heard voices approaching.  Two men.  The hair was standing up on the back of my neck and something about it just felt… off.  Uneasily, I pulled Cassie out of the middle of the hallway and towards where another hallway branched off.  We were almost to the corner when the men rounded the corner.

Black slacks and white button-up shirts.  Badges on their chests.  Campus security.  I grabbed Maria’s wrist and pulled.  She followed me through the door of the room just across the hall and I shut it as quietly as I could behind me.

The lights were off inside so we threw ourselves down onto the ground, pressed up close against the half-wall, just underneath the glass.  By now Maria had learned to not question me when I said to do something, so she stayed hidden by my side and didn’t raise her voice above a whisper.

“What’s wrong with campus security?” she hissed.

“I don’t know yet.  But last time I ran into them they were going to shove me outside with a monster.”

We listened to their footsteps walk past us in breathless silence.  Beside me, Maria had covered her mouth with both of her hands, as if she could further muffle the sound of her breathing.  I opted to hold my breath instead - or rather - I’m not sure I could breath at that moment.  It felt like my entire body was paralyzed in fear.  There wouldn’t be any excuses if they found us cowering here just across the hall from literal monsters, flopping around on the floor like dying fish.

They walked right past where we were hiding.  I watched their shadows on the far wall of the room.  Then I heard the door open and they entered the room we’d just abandoned.

I could hear them talking, but I couldn’t make out what they were saying through two panes of glass.  I wanted to see what was happening, but I couldn’t figure out a good angle to look without potentially revealing myself as well.  Then Maria had the smart idea to turn her camera on selfie mode and poke the camera up above the edge of the half-wall.  We breathlessly watched the phone’s screen as the two men shuffled about the room.  They talked for a few more seconds and then both fell silent, staring down at a space between them on the ground.

Then one got out a baton.  He raised it high, then brought it down with all his strength.

Bits of translucent jelly splattered on the glass.

I stopped watching.  I felt sick.  It’s one thing to have scraps of evidence pointing to the campus administration knowing what was happening, it’s another thing to see it so starkly like this.  They knew.  They absolutely knew and were just… covering it up.

Exactly what the campground had done for generations.

Maria tapped my arm.  I looked again at the camera and watched as they exited the room.  This time, I could hear them through the glass.  Their voices were muted, but I could still make out enough of their words.

“-get someone to clean it up,” one was saying.  “Any students on this floor?”

“Not that I saw.”

“Well, let’s check again.”

They split up, heading in opposite directions.  We waited until they were out of sight and then hurriedly scrambled to our feet.  We had to get off this floor.  Thankfully, the layout did not favor two security guards.  There were five stairwells we could use and two of them would take us away from the direction they’d gone in.  I followed Maria, as she was more familiar with the union’s layout.

We almost made it out.  We were at the stairwell and had just opened the door onto the landing when we found ourselves face to face with a third security guard that was just coming up the stairs.

“Oh, excuse us,” Maria said, holding the door open for him.

Like nothing was unusual.  Like we were just on our way out for no reason in particular.  He started to walk past us, then paused and took a closer look.  My heart sank.  He looked somewhat familiar.

“Do I know you?” the security guard asked, squinting at me.  “What were you doing on the second floor?”

He was the one that had tried to throw Steven and I out into the rain with the flickering man.

I stammered for a minute, desperately searching for something to throw him off his suspicions.  The student union was big.  There was no way to know for certain we witnessed anything strange.

To hell with it.  I’d already established there was *drama* going on.  I screwed up my face as if I was going to cry again.

“We broke up,” I said, trying to sound pathetic.  “I just - I need some space-”

“I’m just here to support her,” Maria added, patting me on the shoulder.  “We found an empty room to cry in.”

At least she was quick on the uptake.  I don’t think the security guard was buying my fake almost-crying though, so I pulled out my cellphone.  I opened the text messages between me and Steven, which ended in ‘WE’RE OVER’ and then a bunch of messages that Cassie had deleted out of my phone.  The security guard glanced at them once with indifference, then took a second look with a bit more scrutiny.

“Good for you,” he proclaimed.  “I could tell with just one look that the kid is a loser.”

I opened my mouth to protest that it wasn't fair, that there’s no way he could tell that from a glance and that Steven had some redeeming qualities, but then Maria seized my arm and started dragging me backwards towards the stairway.

“Oooo-kay, we should get going,” she said, smiling at the man.  “My friend here has had a *very* difficult day, what with dumping a guy I don’t think she even liked that much to begin with and all.”

She said the last part through clenched teeth.  The security guard didn’t interfere any further.  We went downstairs and found a relatively quiet space to wait out the rain.  As I expected, those creatures didn’t come after us while we were in a big group.  Nor did campus security come and find us.  Hopefully that means they don’t think we were suspicious.

I wrote down some notes on the creatures, including what Maria told me about the swimming pool.  She did… better, I guess.  Sure, she tried to get closer to it, but she also followed me and stayed quiet.  I guess this means she can learn.

So I showed her the rules.  We added a few more.  There’s still a couple I’m not sure on, but the list is really starting to take shape now.

She wants to show it to the rest of the Rain Chasers.  And you know what?  I think it might be time to do exactly that. [\[x\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/goatvalleycampgrounds/)

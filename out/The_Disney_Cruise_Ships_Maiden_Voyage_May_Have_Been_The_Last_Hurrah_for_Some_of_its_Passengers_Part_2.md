We both hold onto the balcony and no more than three minutes go and Julie says “Oh my God - there’s that boat again with that sailor who is dressed in the skull outfit!”

This time we just watch as the same procedure happens where a bunch of elderly people get onto our cruise ship and then an equal amount of younger people get on that ferry boat.

Seeing that, kind of ruins our night and puts us in a funk because we seem lost of what’s going on.

We both decide to go back to our stateroom.

As we walk through our Deck 9 hallway, we see our designated housekeeper, Marcos, who greets us with a smile before we go into our stateroom and says “Did you guys have a nice day?”

“Yeah, the day went by fast!” I respond in a monotone voice.

“Okay, if you guys need anything just let me know!” Marcos says, then goes back to folding towels on his cart in the hallway.

Seeing Julie’s face being confused of what we witnessed with that ferry boat swap - makes me ask Marcos “Hey, what’s going on with that ferry looking boat - who’s captain is dressed like a skeleton - where our younger passengers are being swapped with their older passengers?”

“I wasn’t aware of anything like that happening.” Marcos nonchalantly responds to me.

At this point, I know some of this crew on this ship has to know something where the guest are leaving the ship mid-voyage and new ones are coming on.

“Marcos - listen - I know you have to know something about what’s going on!” I say to him in the hallway with Julie standing next to me.

“Sir, I really don’t know anything besides these six staterooms I have to take care of.” Marcos nervously responds.

“But don’t you think it’s odd that halfway through a cruise in the middle of the ocean that some of the previous guest leave and new ones arrive?”

Marcos scratches his head and replies “you know it’s probably that they got sick and had to leave the ship!” 

I can tell that Marcos is really getting nervous where he doesn’t want to say the wrong thing to get himself in trouble.

Julie steps in and says “Marcos, why don’t you come in our room for a minute?”

Marcos feels uncomfortable telling a guest “no” so he obliges and comes into our room.

Once our stateroom door closes - Marcos says “I’m not going to see my wife or children for close to six months when this contract is over.”

I feel really bad for Marcos and the rest of the employees on this ship because their away from their family’s for so long.

Julie looks at me and then she heads over to the safe that’s in the closet and says “Listen, Marco’s your doing a great job of keeping up with our room. We have a good amount of cash because we were going to buy some top notch marijuana in Nassau tomorrow.”

Julie pulls out the stacks of $100 bills from the safe and looks toward Marco’s and hands him $300 dollars and says “Tell us what is going on?”

Marco’s looks at us with fear and trepidation like the $300 isn’t enough to compensate for what will happen to him.

Julie then hands him $700 more dollars and says “All we want to know is what’s going on and we’ll promise to keep our mouths shut.

Then Marco’s says “Do either of you have Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, … or any other social media accounts?”

“No, we got rid of them a couple of years ago for various reasons.” I respond.

 Marcos drops his head in what seems like disappointment and then says - “Why?”

“Both Julie and our work as freelance consultants, so we really don’t have any close work connections and it just seemed like our high school and college friends were constantly posting achievements of their kids that got old and tiresome of seeing.”

Marcos continues to keep his head down and says “Where I grew up in Brunei, family is really important and I remember walking with my Grandmother when I was a young boy and we passed a man who was stumbling in the streets from drinking too much alcohol. I asked my grandmother ‘why doesn’t he stop drinking and just go home’ and my Grandmother responded ‘his mind, body and soul has hit the end and it has no where to go!’ Then I asked her ‘doesn’t he have any family that can help him?’ My grandmother with a sad look on her face said ‘no, he’s the last one left’ which I never really understood the context of what my Grandmother was telling me until I got hired on the other Disney Cruise Ship and I realized where those passengers were going when they left the ship and were swapped for that boat with the  ‘Soul Ender!”

Julie and I look completely confused and were not expecting such a long drawn out response.

“Soul Ender?” Julie says with a confused look on her face.

“Those skull and bones - black flags have caused fear and anxiety for sea goers for hundreds of years and somehow pirates took advantage of that and used it as their calling cards, but piracy is not the meaning of the skull and bones.”

Both Julie and I look at each other like Marcos has told us something in Latin that neither of us understand.

“Sorry Marcos but we don’t understand what your telling us!”
I say.

“I pray that you will continue to not understand what I say and when you see me on the next cruise you’ll remember more dancing with Minnie and Mickey than having this conversation. Have a good night and I hope you enjoy the chocolates that I left.”

“Sure, have a goodnight.” Whimpers out of my mouth.

Then Marcos leaves the room with his head down.

“What the fuck was he just talking about?” Julie says with a bit of vigor in her voice.

“I don’t know but let’s just go to bed.” I say to help calm Julie down.

I turn the lights off in the room as we both lay down.

Julie passes out as I can hear her periodically snore to catch her breath, but I keep thinking about watching those people being swapped and then what Marcos was saying.

Then my mind drifts to different contexts where I try to put everything together.

Somehow my brain thinks of Super Mario Brothers and how I was amazed over the years when gamers were able to find all those hidden levels that were able to keep the lure of the game going to eternity.

Then I thought, what happens when every last hidden level has been discovered and there’s no more records to break? - “They hit a dead end” I say out loud to myself - followed by a “Then what?”

" Though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I shall fear no evil; for thou art is with me".

\-Psalm 23:4

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Waking up from my stupor, I heard sirens coming along with the sound of loud engines rushing passed by the highway. I gaze upon them military vehicles and ambulance aliks as they bravely navigate through the ever expanding, ever thickening snow storm that's swallowing the entire area. Being overly-cautious for my safety, I marched at the opposite direction from where they're heading. People around me started walking fast-paced when they realize what's happening. It was all in a tensed situation where everybody was trying their best to keep their cool. 

&#x200B;

There was a moment of silence. 

&#x200B;

The pressure building up inside me was slowly going down by the second. All the gathered people were starting to sigh in relief until an explosion at the center happened. Now being at a 300m, this explosion was very loud, it made all people around me to run in panic. It was a mass hysteria. The sound of the explosion rebounded from the buildings around us so most of people assumed it was coming from above them and so many tried to get away as fast as they can from where they're standing at. 

&#x200B;

Due to this, some debirs managed to land into people. 

Some either get their limbs torn-off by the impact, a person got hit in the head with a huge chunk of glass that sliced his head into two and the other one, was little girl who's feet was crushed by the the building  where she and her mom was taking shelter. 

I never saw her mom. Only her hand were sticking out near her little girl. 

&#x200B;

The girl was screaming in agony, calling for her mom. But only shouts and panics muffled her voice. I tried to ran as fast to save her. Trust me I did but the moment I was 5 feet near her, a sharp piece of metal suddenly pierced her causing her screams to abruptly stop. 

She never got to close her eyes, she died instantly. 

&#x200B;

I stood there for a while. I never knew what I could've done. Or if I could've arrived sooner I would have been able to save her. All I could do was clench my fist. 

Tears welling up in my eyes, turning my back on her. 

Taking the first step it felt like my heart was turning into pieces. But there's nothing I could do now.. I just ran. I ran far away just so I couldn't see her corpse staring right at me as I run away. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I wish I could look back. 

&#x200B;

But I didn't do it. 

&#x200B;

I don't want to see anything anymore.. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Sometime later, I arrived near at a phone boot. It's probably the last of it's kind. The sounds of violence and destruction still persists but became more muffled as I settled down to catch some air. Losing my balance due to being over fatigued, I fell flat on the snow. 

Trying to push myself to stand,  I move both of my arms forward pushing against the ground I still managed to lift myself up but it took me quite some time. Hearing another violent explosion, which gave me the inclination to hide for cover. But there weren't anywhere else to go. I was in the middle of a battlefield, if I took shelter on buildings, and I'm  not betting my chances in being crushed to death. 

 I was preparing run further away to save myself,L when I felt a massive earthquake that shook my entire being. The road in standing on rocked so hard, I lost balanced and broke my wrist when it took the fall. Sudden as it came, it settled down. 

But then the aftershock followed up. The earth felt like it's being pummeled by a massive hammer that led cracks a meter deep, sinkholes started forming along with the further collapse of buildings that rumbles down all over me. 

&#x200B;

It was all insanity. I was going insane at that moment. I curled up into a ball, I started shaking and finally, went into shock. I just couldn't take it anymore. I didn't care if the phone booth next to me almost landed on my head, the phone broke along with a single coin escaped and rolled over before stopping at my face. Everything doesn't seem to matter, my eyes welled up seeing the coin. 

&#x200B;

 One, twice, thrice.. the after shocked waa ongoing, it lasted longer than it was supposed to and for the last time, finally, it stopped. 

&#x200B;

A loud roar came from above and everywhere. The echoes of made it much worse. Ever heard a lion  inside a cave? It was foreboding, ominous even. You don't know where that lion is, but you know it's in the same cave as you are. 

&#x200B;

Clearly shaken up, but slightly feeling a little bit better. I felt numb all over my body. After all that's happened,  all I  think about now is home. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Scanning over the surrounding area, looking f to find that son of a dam that ruined me. I look up to pinpoint where the sound was coming from. 

&#x200B;

There it was. I saw it. It's beyond me what happens next. 

&#x200B;

Thick clouds of grey ashes appeared beyond the center area surrounded by the ruins of many buildings and leaning skyscrapers. The cloud swirled around and over on top at the center, slowly landing on the ground. It continues to swirl around while thunder sprites began to creat a temporal lighting giving depth to it. A vision to what's inside. 

&#x200B;

 A hundred fifty meter-high shadow appeared briefly as lightning continues to light it the clouds. 

&#x200B;

Realizing something was wrong I stared really carefully at the thing. And soon there it was. I saw it 

&#x200B;

The size of it was nothing I've ever seen. It was phenomenal. if I could just ignore all the destruction that has ever Happened. Maybe if I was watching it on TV, maybe I could've appreciated freak show a little more. 

&#x200B;

Staring at the clouds, and looking at what's peeking out. I'm trying to make out rough shape of it. A red glowing orb peeked out from the cloud and all of the sudden I was drawn to it. There my vision turned black while I felt my body was levitating up into space. Visions of comets and asteroids landing on earth creating a massive white cloud of engulfed the entire world. The earth or I assume a planet that looked like ours was completely covered with white ashes no matter where I look. The next scene was Gigantic beasts of unknown origins suddenly rose up beneath the earth. I was in awe by this development, I knew by then that I was lucid. I was aware of my surroundings and I was dreaming. Lost in wonder about why was I dreaming about this. I mean, it could've been a monkey riding a horse while firing a glock all over the place, but somehow, I felt a connection with it. 

My daydream was abruptly disturbed when a beast with huge red eyes suddenly showed up at my face, instantly waking me up. 

&#x200B;

I felt like waking up from a trance. 

And I never knew how much time has passed since then. 

The next thing I knew, it was when the clouds were already dissipating next to nothing. 

&#x200B;

There, at full view, I saw a red-eyed monstrosity with two large horns the size of a school bus protruding out of it's head frill. Jagged teeth inhibits it's mouth and It's wings span beyond meters  I could comprehend. They were attached to it's arm like what a bat wing does. Huge claws that comes along with it. The huge monstrosity is bipedal and stood tall almost at the height of a skyscraper. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Now, I'm standing here just staring at this beast. I was feeling like I was back in that trance again, but this time I was awake and I couldn't move. I tried moving my body but to no avail. I was trying my best shaking myself even trying to move my toes didn't help. 

&#x200B;

The beast raised it's head to look up in the sky, curious. 

But then it's eyes ended up befalling on me. 

My heart sank on the spot. 

&#x200B;

I tried to scream at the top of my lungs but there was no coming out. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I tried to look away or close my eye because I don't want to witness myself getting stumped, I tried my best but I was helpless as  duck. Like pointing a shotgun at a fish inside barrell, I was stuck in place.

&#x200B;

 The beast began to move. 

&#x200B;

Raising one of it's feet, it took it's first step towards my direction. 

Buildings upon buildings, and cars alike gets crushed by the passing of this creature. 

&#x200B;

My heart is beating so fast  right at this moment. 

&#x200B;

Suddenly, I managed to blink. Then I tried to blink for a other one and slowly I managed to move my arms, and then my legs I was in control again. I managed to pull of a short spring before almost fainting at the snow. 

&#x200B;

. Gasping for air, the humidity was so thick it was affecting my breathing. My legs sunk within 2 feet deep beneath thebthick grey stuff. I didn't realized, that the whole area is now covered entirely by grey ashes that mixed in with the snow. I only managed to get away a few meters from where I was at, but all is futile when a I could do is to get stuck. I tried to push through with all the strength I could muster, but I could only go so far. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

At this point in time, I was desperately seeking out means of escape. I stare straight at the road ahead, but my vision starts to blurr out.. Slowly I blinked twice, I was losing consciousness due to extreme stress and fatigue. Then I blacked out for a plot second, almost loosing my balance but I managed to recover. Suddenly, a hard object hit me at the back of my head. It could've been a debris that's being catapulted by the beasts feet. 

Falling, and in an daze. 

I was losing a sense of reality. The footsteps of the creature were getting muffled as my consciousness starts to fade away. 

&#x200B;

June 11, 2021

Professor Adam Turner of XXXXXX University, XXXXX XXXXXXXX

 ST. George Avenue, XXX XXXXXX 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I'm currently writing this down to keep records upon witnessing a phenomenan that's been detected by our radar system. I'm Adam Turner, a Physicist, Climetologist and I've been monitoring atmospheric pressure, weather changes and cloud behavior that maybe affected by climate change all through out the state I'm appointed to. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Not the actual thing that you see on TV like a weather forecast. 

&#x200B;

No, far from it. For 4 years now, I've retired from a university I used to teach as a Professor in Physics. I decided upon myself to change into a new career in my life. It was because I wasn't happy, I wasn't getting nowhere near to getting the things that I want. 

&#x200B;

 Not because I needed higher pay but, I'm just tired of the stale, montonous lifestyle that I got so accustomed of. I dreamed of doing something that could contribute to humanity. Cure for cancer, a super vaccine, and or a machine that could develop time travel. Yes, being able to control time, you control the world. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I need to think of a way out rather than rottinf in this trap.  Ager a year of job searching on the internet and walk-ins after walk-ins from here and there, I think I may have found a clue. 

&#x200B;

When you can't things that you're looking for elsewhere on the internet. Sometimes, 

 You have to go deeper. As deep as you need to be. 

&#x200B;

Browsing for relative job searches in the dark web, I found a rather peculiar website. It's not about the name or the rumors that's being going on that attracted me. There were also some advertisement that were slightly unnerving. (Yes, ads are everywhere nowadays) 

&#x200B;

Some of the things I've seen where like "Russian slave girl at a 25% discount, or order your own slave online with free shipping". Seems like business is booming here too. 

&#x200B;

but above all the searches that I made.. This one was unique. It's not your regular search page but this has color ranks which determines the severity of risk browsing on that a site is known for. 

Blue was normal, yellow.. well yellow has risks of backdoor softwares and malwares. 

It's still manageable 

&#x200B;

Not until you've reached red. Well red is sort of something special. Red here means, not only you would risk your computer turning into brick but you're also risking your life. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

And that's where I was. I clicked on a red colored website. 

&#x200B;

The site is called

www.(redacted)Jobs. org

When I pressed click, 

 A recruitment panel board showed up. 

&#x200B;

The page was simplistic enough. There's only abblack screen to it. The only exception was then search bar located at the center containing two words:

 "Submit Resume". 

No matter how cliche it may seem, the website kinda creeped me out.

&#x200B;

Having a lot of skepticism I decided to close my laptop and call it a day. I was about to close the lid but then I asked myself. Am I... happy right now? 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I was really trying not to do irreversible decisions here. But try as I might, for doing something that's supposed to feel wrong, I felt awfully curios. It was compelling, I was married to the idea that this could be my big break. This could be my ticket to a new life. 

&#x200B;

 I did it. I submitted my information, there's nothing going back. Just that everyone on the dark web might now know all of my private information. Name, age, location, previous occupation.. everything. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Despite all of that.

&#x200B;

 No regrets. No hard feelings, I was gonna die from stressing on my daily life anyway. 

&#x200B;

  There's no text or verbal confirmations nor any video scheduled for the interview. I only had to upload my CV and then it's done. Months later, I received an email that contains the letter that may have changed my life forever. 

&#x200B;

Covered in dark background,  white vines that is intricately drawn for elegance entangled and formed a rectangular line. Inside contains a simple text laden with gold. Shits so fancy my eyes hurt. 

&#x200B;

  The text says:

&#x200B;

"Welcome to Rozenheim". 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

3 years later, I'm working at Rozenheim, I never felt much more alive. Technologies so advanced with a budget that made Jeff B'Sauce looked like an Uber driver. 

&#x200B;

Rare materials that were kept from the public were regularly imported here. 

Most of Rozenheim technology are kept in confidentiality and the efforts to keep it private to the public eye is strictly mandated. 

&#x200B;

One of our technological breakthroughs are carbon-based nanobots capable of shape manipulation  by A. I. assisted shape memory. These nanobots are used for regenerative purposes that could potentially recover an 

individual from fatal injuries.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

But what exactly is Rozenheim?

 And what does it do? 

What does... it actually do? 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Well for publicity, it guided itself as a German company that's located branch near the border of N3w Y#rk, N3w Y@rk City to develop advanced A I.'s, cutting edge flight engines, & avian technologies. Radar and Lidar tech are attached on top of it's 20 story-building to track weather statistics and record data on tech prototypes. 

&#x200B;

Datas acquired from these tests will be key factors in developing a much more sustainable, and much more advanced self-driving planes. That's what is publicly announced by Rozenheim. The rest is history. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

What the public doesn't know is that, we're actually developing more than planes. We are actually developing remote harbingers of death. A new breed of stealth bombers. Planes that are capable of displaying  destruction with pinpoint accuracy. The ability of this plane is the capability to fly at hyper speed. Materials entirely based from carbon, it is physically invisible with the help of stealth optics  that enables the plane to remain transparent, and finally evading radars with a radar canceller. How it works is relatively easy, 

&#x200B;

but I can't tell you that. Or I have to kill you. 

&#x200B;

This plane called "VI6-B3 "

&#x200B;

 I had to sign a bunch of NDA's just to get access from this particular project. I was in charge of collecting data and providing key info for the development and improvement of this bird. 

&#x200B;

Now America is actually struggling to stay at the top and is really committed to do so. So they're pushing these projects with almost to unlimited amount of budget just so they could still be ahead of the hyper-stealth race. There are also some new stealth bombers being developed but are closed to secrecy rumor wise. 

&#x200B;

 Remote-AI operated stealth bombers usually gets the job done but the government decided to add new weapon. Rumors says that it's something they weren't supposed to do legally. 

&#x200B;

The American government seems like they're running out of options. 

&#x200B;

You see, a while ago, China's been detected that it has developed a new kind of a stealth bomber. 

" Xian H-20" that's also carbon based and it operated manually by a pilot-assisted-A.I. 

&#x200B;

With the current progression of A.I.'s in this date and time, it has the capacity to anticipate, make accurate judgment to launch and neutralize a target location and conjure-up total annihilation of a particular subject anywhere across the globe. Effectively  bypassing air security without the risk of being compromised. The Pentagon released a footage of Chinese carrier launching their elusive stealth bomber for a test flight just months before the pandemic. By all means, the United States is pouring all of it's resources in manufacturing another Monarch of the skies. Because if China wins. It might lead to another World War. This is how serious things can get when it comes to achieving  air superiority. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

That's where my company comes in and take the shot. Being funded by Americans, the company 'Rozenheim' initiated the project called.. "Project X01" 

 To my colleagues knowledge, as far as this project goes, experts from all different branches of science were working for decades on this project. They also  mentioned another  project that's entirely shrouded in secrecy. An ominous one. 

&#x200B;

The type of project where people would just vanish into thin air. 

&#x200B;

The project is called "Project Blackhole". 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I just hope none of my colleague would find this post. 

&#x200B;

'900 Hours Before the Winter Storm"

June 11, 2021

Professor Adam Turner of XXXXXX University, Sxxxx Cxxxlxxx

(redacted) St. 7 th Floor, Rozenheim Building, (redacted) City, Nxx Yxxx

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Project X01 - 

We just received full authorization on these 'new' materials that the company requested from the government to further develop  the project.

&#x200B;

 Of course, we couldn't operate solely by Rozenheim. The Government issued supervision. In other words, we're dogs on a leash. 

We will be monitored by a representatives as a condition. 

&#x200B;

The thing is, these materials are known not known that they exist or had costed a lot to manufacture  that ended up being so controversial that it had to be covered up.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

\*I've never seen anything like it. \*

&#x200B;

A dark spherical  object with what I assume a special kind alloy. At a closer inspection , the sphere seems it's actively absorbing light as if it craves for light radiance. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Fascinated, I'm curious to know how it works. How it's able to maintain it's dark glow and continue absorbing light.

I needed to get a reaction from it. 

Using  two of my fingers, the index and middle finger, I slowly reach out to the sphere. I was about to touch it, when all of the sudden a man interrupted me. 

&#x200B;

"You don't want to touch that. You'll be feeding it your fingers to it". Say goodbye to your good hand, you can't beat your meat with it anymore. 

&#x200B;

 Surprised by the mysterious man, I instinctively retrieved my hand from the dark object. I turned around and see a middle aged man 5'8 ft in height with a lean physique, clean shaven, deep blue eyes with greyish hair on top. 

&#x200B;

Turning my head to face him, he introduced himself. 

&#x200B;

" Lt. Coronel Maxwell " with his hand behind the back, I pretty much get the gist that he's not interested in establishing any connections quite just yet.

&#x200B;

 Rude, but necessary. 

&#x200B;

" Adam Turner, Radar Specialist". 

"I believe we never-" 

I was trying to give out a hand shake & initiate a small talk but then i was cut off. 

&#x200B;

"Why are you here?"  Asked the the Lt. Cornel. 

&#x200B;

Slightly offended, I tried to answer him as calm as a cucumber. 

&#x200B;

"One of the scientists conducting the R&D section summoned me for a briefing. I ju-" 

&#x200B;

Then he cut off again. 

&#x200B;

"Never mind. Just don't touch that thing right there." 

&#x200B;

He looked at me straight in the eye and pointed his finger towards the spherical object. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"I don't understand, what is it Coronel.?" Confused by the sudden gesture I asked him directly. 

&#x200B;

"It's Lt. Coronel" He reminded. 

&#x200B;

"You want to know how it works? 

Of course you do. 

 but I have to kill you first" 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"You'll see what it can do. Soon."

&#x200B;

 Grinning ear to ear, he stared at me for quite some time before setting his eyes on the object. 

He glared at it menacingly. He looked at it as if it was his most prized possession. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

\*Present\*

\-100 Hours Since the  Winter Storm 

Somewhere in the middle of N3w Ycrk City

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

A sharp piercing sound was heard. Passing from south, three stealth bombers were flying low about 200 feet who were heading towards the city. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

My face got buried om the snow for quite some time, my cheeks seared in pain from  frost bite. And my long unkempt beard, completely frozen in place. I felt vomiting due to the cold and starvation. 

&#x200B;

I sat up straight then, I closed my eyes for a moment.. 

I just stood there, recollecting everything that's happened. But then I realized something. 

I rememberes that the beast was heading right towards me earlier. 

I suddenly shifted my head into the direction of the creature. 

Just a few meters shy,  two massive reptile feet were standing up front. Bewildered, I instinctively looked up and saw this giant creature staring at me just like in the dream. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I stared in awe for the size of this creature up close. It was like witnessing a triceratops that walks on two legs. 

&#x200B;

I've never seen anything like it. A huge humanoid reptile that is alike to a lizard having an armor. It's surface colored in dark scales. Cold plumes of smoke coming out from it's mouth. It wasn't terror that held me in place, once again I felt the connection with it. It's as if it was trying to tell me something. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

 As strong winds continues to pierce my body, I heard this loud noise. It wasn't the monster, but something much more familiar. 

Wheezing through the air, two stealth bombers launched out flairs to draw the creature's attention while the other one dropped some sort of missile. 

&#x200B;

!!!!

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

In a panic, I ran as far away from where the missile was heading. 

&#x200B;

But then it exploded. There was a small pop but afterwards silence.. 

&#x200B;

It was low at first. But slowly increasing in volume. It sounded like, as if air was getting sucked in rapidly..  The air made high pitched sounds similar to a whistle. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

A Massive Black Hole appeared in the middle of the City as it stretches out to match the size of skycrappers engulfing everything near it. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

A roar erupted from the monster as it slowly getting dragged back  by the gigantic hole. 

&#x200B;

I gasped for air.

 I swallowed my hard, I watched the scene with anticipation, but soon I realized that it's not just the collosal being  getting sucked. Buildings, asphalt , cars, everything is getting sucked by the hole. 

&#x200B;

 And much my dismay, I'm getting pulled in as well.

I shouted on top of my lungs as I was lifted up into the air, almost hitting  buildings, derbris and other floating objects towards the gaping hole. 

&#x200B;

Getting closer and closer by the creature, It opens it's mouth preparing to catch me with it while resisting the strong wind current. But it could only do so much as it wings opened up and it was completely swallowed by the hole. 

&#x200B;

Floating for a while, I managed to grab a traffic pole with both hands. I grabbed it as hard as I could and wouldn't let go. 

I closed my eyes in anticipation, hoping that it would be over soon. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

But it didn't. It just turned out for the worse. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

The pavements below soon gave in. One by one, slabs of different  sizes flew up, and the pole I was clinging to soon followed. Without anything to cling to anymore, I resigned to my fate and allowed the hole to swallow me into the dark abyss that it harbors 

&#x200B;

It was a matter time before I fade into nothingness... 

 Ready to accept my fate, I exhaled

And closed my eyes to welcomed my end.

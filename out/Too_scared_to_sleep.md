(This is literally my situation right now, as in today this is a true to life and I just wanted to hear some thoughts)

I slept at around 9:00pm which is weird because I usually sleep at 5:00am, but I thought it's a good thing to sleep early. I woke up around 3:00am where I needed to pee. I was trying to sleep again but I just feel so awake so I decided to play some games to make myself sleepy.

I got a bit sleepy at 9:00am so I decided to nap. I have the usual weird can't remember when I wake up dream, a very random dream with a wtf plotline but the only thing different is my dream glitched. All of a sudden I'm standing infront of some random door that has a weird hole in the middle with a shabby lock and yellow walls. 

I don't know what I did whether I locked the door or opened it but I just remembered touching the shabby lock, I knew it was a dream but I can't command myself. 

After touching something I woke up well, atleast my presence is awake but I can't move my body, I felt a bit hot and a mild numb all over my body, I didn't see anything (demons/ghosts) so I was a bit relieved but I was still scared so I put all the strength I can muster to move my fingertips and luckily it did move, and I woke up almost immediately. 

I was scared as fuck, but I tried consoling myself that it's just a random dream, but at that moment I felt like I was in another dimension or something. I decided to scroll through my phone hoping to forget the incident and I did eventually.

The only problem is I got really sleepy again at 11:00am. I still remember what happened earlier but I can't fight my sleepiness. So I decided to rest my eyes, I dreamed about the game I was playing where I'm the player, all of sudden like in my earlier dream there was some sort of glitch.

In the next scene I'm in this cramped corner with the walls yellow like in my dream earlier, but this time there is no door, just a random hole (the walls are wooden) as if someone took an axe or something and forcibly enter. 

A whole person can fit in the wall, the hole is very dark and I feel like something inside the hole is coming for me. I decided to run to a corner that has somesort of furniture to hide and I felt like I'm being chased. And all of a sudden I'm in my bed again, paralyzed. This time I'm more calmer than earlier. And luckily I was able to move my fingertips again.

I confirmed that my presence and body where seperated because I remember turning the other way during my paralyzed moment but when I woke up I was still in the same position as I was when I took the nap. What's weird is it's really dark in my paralyzed state but not the light's are off black dark but grey dark, it's like the room is light's off but I have night vision and it's really foggy dark. 

As I'm typing this I have a really strong urge to sleep. But I'm too scared to sleep, I believe third time's a charm. I don't wanna imagine what would happen if I let the mysterious force in my dream win.

i’ve never posted about this or told a lot of people other than my family and close friends due to the fact of how sick and life altering this story is for this person. The affected is the girl that is referred to as Beth.

I was a junior in high school going into my senior year, summer break partying with my girlfriend and her friends taking copious amounts of drugs having a great time. Until one weekend a friend of mine texted me asking if we would want to go to this party an hour away that he had heard of on social media. In the moment I wasn’t doing anything tonight, my girlfriend wasn't either but I said why not I’ll ask her to come she’ll bring Beth and it’ll be a great time like any other party.

We all meet at my house, 2 of my friends tag along, all was going to plan we’re pre-gaming for the party drinking, and getting the vibe right. Beth starts drinking a good amount. We all typically drank the same amount but for my size and Beth drinking the same amount as me got her way more drunk for her size. I’m looking at my girlfriend and she's annoyed that we're all blasted before we even leave for the party.

Anyway we leave for the party. It takes us about an hour to get there. As we were about to arrive to the house the whole street was clogged with cars, groups of people walking to this party. What stood out to me the most was that they're people of all ages. Me going into my senior year of high school seeing men that had to of looked 25 plus and some younger than me pulling up was a little off putting but i didn't think of it too much, its a party after all everyone likes to have a good time.

We end up parking 2 streets over from the house and we walked there. My girlfriend worrying about all the men that were much older, both my friends pumped, Beth was surprisingly pumped too. We walk into the house, about 75 people dancing, drinking it seemed almost unreal for someone coming out of a small town to see this many people at a party. We all go pour some shots, start chatting and dancing both my friends break off to meet new people and beth walked off too with a man that had come up to ask her to dance.

Two hours go by me and my girlfriend dancing and drinking and we decide its time to leave cause the vibe was getting a little creepy with all these new people showing up i have never seen before. We go and find my two friends and then look for Beth. We ended up searching for about 15 to 20 mins until we found her upstairs dancing with a much older man. As i walk in they're all over each other kissing, grabbing, you know how it goes. I say "beth, its time to get out of here" she nods and as she was walking to me the man grabbed her arm and begged her to come to his hotel nearby. I was very worried on what this guy's deal was, i kept silent waiting for what beth was going to say "i would but i have to go leave with my friends" she said. They then exhanged numbers, kissed, hugged and we left and all went home.

The day after i woke up very late. I slept in with my girlfriend. We wake up and as we are eating breakfast my girlfriend shows me a picture of Beth's face that she had sent her early in the morning. Her lips and face all bubbly and rashes all over, I thought to myself this guy definitely had given her herpes or something. Turns out she went to the hospital and and the doctor said it is contact dermatitis that you would only get from a corpse. I was very freaked out and did not believe it for a second. I called Beth and tried getting an explanation for how this could've happened. She had the man's number so I told her to ask him what it was, but there was no reply.

Later in the week on the news, same town we had went to for the party. The man making out with Beth had been arrested. Murdered and ate 4 people. It was very shocking watching the news with my girlfriend about what this man did to people knowing beth could have been one of them.

I have never heard from Beth again after my girlfriend had spoken to her about the man who gave her that rash on her face from the rotten flesh in his teeth probably. She didn't go to my school anymore nor talked to my girlfriend or anyone else that i knew. God knows where she is now but i could not imagine for anyone to go through that as a teenager.

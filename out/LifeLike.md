My name is...well...it's John now. 


Me and my sister's kids had just moved to a house located in an under-developed part of the country. For our safety, that's all I can say. Our new home had been provided by the same organization that renamed us.


The kids run around the yard, playing, being kids. About 100 yards from the back door there's a steep drop in the land, beyond lurks endless swamp. If we had neighbors, their houses were hidden by the trees or were too far away to see. The kids are laughing but it's forced, with a whisp of sadness. They know they should be happy but aren't. With what they've been through, the attempt is encouraging.


My sister, the mother the children that were now in my care, had been murdered 2 years ago. 'A mugging gone wrong' was the official story, also, complete bullshit. She had been murdered professionally. The hit had been ordered by my former employer. Having taken part in several staged "muggings-gone-wrong" while under his employ, the true story of her untimely demise was obvious. He never said a word, wanted me to figure it out on my own.


It was my fault. Giving into my conscience had caused me to make some major mistakes, expensive mistakes. My sister's life was taken as compensation. A cautionary tale of the dangers of listening to your shoulder angel over the boss. Maybe he felt this would inspire me to become a better employee. I knew if I didn't fall in line, the kids were next, I'd be last.


I had to get us out, I betrayed everything I had been taught to believe my entire life to give them a chance to live theirs. In exchange for immunity and new identities. I testified against my former employer. He was given 245 years for his crimes, yet he breathes. 


The trial was drawn out and stressful. We lived in one safe house or another, surrounded by armed agents that always made our lives harder when they could, bastards. We only left the house for court. The backyard of our new house was mostly swamp. Compared to the inside of a safe house, it was paradise.


"Ethan!!! Give it back!!" my niece wails. 


That name on the wind shatters the tranquility in the yard. My heart drops to my stomach. I look around nervously. I don't see anyone but I doubt I'd see them coming. My niece is 4 and went by 'Jenny' now. 'Ethan' was a forbidden word, her brother's old name. I'd done my best to wipe our previous lives from their minds, immersing them in their new identities. We have been here for less than 3 hours and Jenny had already dropped the ball. I, honestly, don't know if we're going to be ok.


Ryan, who is 10, has taken Jenny's doll. He's dangling it by the hair in front of her face. She grabs for it; he yanks it away, again and again. Revolting, pre-pubescent braying comes from his little, jackass mouth. Before I can intervene, he rips the doll's head off, spiking the broken pieces to the ground. Adding to my doubt in the children's ability to play their new roles, Ryan (formally Ethan) hasn't seemed to notice his own name.


"Hey!! Hey!! ya little asshole!" I roar, Angry and terrified. "Get in the goddamn house! Now! God help me, Yur not gonna like what's next if I have to say it again!". 


Ryan hangs his head, does a pathetic, slow walk to the house. 


Jenny is bawling. I attempt to fix the doll but a piece of its neck has flown into the grass, it was beyond repair. I drop the broken doll parts and attempt to fix Jenny.


I drop to one knee, a stern expression on my face. I, once again, explain, our situation to this sweet little girl "listen up kid, do you remember rule #1?" 


She nods. choking on tears 


"You can never, ever, ever, ever, ever use our old names. There are very dangerous people looking for us. Understand?" 


Again, she nods and forces out "uh huh" 


"If anyone finds out who we are, those people might find us. If that happens, I won't be able to protect you or your brother. So please, please, super please, you can never use our old names."


I place my hands on her shoulders and remind her why this so important to me "I love ya too much to lose you scrumptious". 


Heavy stuff to dump on a 4-year-old, I know. I can't lie to her, not about this. It is absolutely essential that she understands we are always in danger. I wouldn't be doing her, or us any favors by sugar-coating it


I smile, wipe her tears with my thumbs. I end the lecture with "hey...hey, I'll buy you a new doll when we go to town, a crazily better doll, Ok?." 


She sniffs; the corners of her lips sneak upwards, It's the slightest of smiles. "Ok, I won't say our old names anymore uncle Ri....John! Uncle John! Sorry, sorry, sorry, I keep forgetting!" She says, panicked. 


The words of my father come from my mouth "don't be sorry, just don't do it again, alright? Now, getouttahereyou" 


She runs to the tire swing that hangs from the big, dying tree by the garage. I sigh. We are definitely not going to be ok.


I'm still watching all potential hiding spots in the yard, Jenny swings. The sound of the rope creaking over the calming noise of summer. I take a deep breath, exhale and relax. I wonder if I am being too paranoid. There were over 1000 miles between us and our old problems. Turning my face to the sun, I turn my brain off for the first time in years. My mind occupied solely by the warmth on my skin.


My peace is swiftly pilfered by the sound of shattering glass. I snap back into survival mode; it was us or them. It will not be us. I pull my hand gun from the waistband of my pants. "Get to the house!" I holler at Jenny; she's already running towards the back door. The sound had come from the garage.


I approach the garage cautiously. Reaching the broad side, pressing my back to the wall, I am so close I could be a painting of myself on the bricks. I move towards the front of the garage. I stop when I reach the large shutter door. I lay my hand on the handle, take three rapid breaths and throw the door open. As the garage door slams in to the end of the track, a screechy explosion of sound comes from the darkness. I hear more glass breaking along with wood being smashed. Something large slams into the open garage door, sending it back down the track. I catch it and stand my ground. WHACK! I'm hit in the chest, hard. My heart flutters and I can't breathe. I fight through the pain and point my gun down at the projectile that has fallen at my feet. The biggest owl I had ever seen was flopping around frantically, its screams of pain, almost human. I give it some space. A shock jolts through my body when I notice this nocturnal, nightmare bird has gaping black holes where its eyes should be. 


The attack had happened recently. Few feathers are without a fresh coat of wet blood. 


"Get out of here! Ya! Ya!!!" I yell and wave my arms, the absurdity of waving my arms at a bird with no eyes would dawn on me much later. 


The owl rights itself and takes to the sky. I should have called wildlife rescue or whoever handles situations like this but I'm not keen on the idea of visitors. I certainly don't want to deal with the carcass.


I stand in front of the open garage, heart racing, adrenaline pumping, gun drawn. A nervous giggle involuntarily erupts from deep within me. I was pretty sure the owl had caused the ruckus. I keep my guard up as more of my father's words pour in 'pretty sure's not sure'. 


The left side of the garage had been cleared, with a snow shovel by the looks of it, to make room for a car. The right side is filled with dust covered junk, mostly broken. I'm mildly excited to go through it, good stuff could be hidden by the trash.


I'm about to walk away when a I hear a faint creak, like a footstep on a hardwood floor. I return my gun to the full, upright, killing position. I spot a figure in the shadows, standing motionless, facing the wall in the back corner of the garage. Had our cover already been blown? 


"Hands up mother fucker!" I bark. 


No movement, I can't see their face. Just black, shoulder length hair 


"Hands up and turn around! do it now! you piece of shit!" Nothing, each breath thunders over the silence. 


I circle around the intruder through the clean side of the garage and scream "Last chance asshole!" As I inch closer.


My heart is racing,  less a beat, more a hum. The trigger is half depressed when I notice the dust. I groan and lower my weapon when I realize what I was about to empty a clip into. it's a goddamn mannequin. I'm relieved but feel a little silly.


I wade through the junk and carry the mannequin to the clean side of the garage. I could use a mannequin, place it in a window or in a chair in the yard. Make it seem like someone was always around, always watching. It may deter any unwelcome guests. A scarecrow for contract killers.


The mannequin is female with black hair. It's made of wood and the left arm is missing. 


"Are you 'all right' beautiful?" I blurt out an obnoxious fake laugh then laugh for real at how bad both the joke and laugh were. I am calmer now, breathing steadily. 


The clothes it's wearing look ancient, the 20's maybe. The painted expression is sad and the eyes...wow...the eyes. They aren't painted on like the rest of the face; They're round and glossy, they almost look wet. Dark blue with black flecks, like fireworks exploding from the pupils. There's a darker blue, almost purple, band around the irises that are islands in whites that if held in comparison, would tint snow grey. They look like real, human eyes.


I touch the mannequin's left eye, the eyelid shuts on my finger. Startled, I whip my hand away. It must be on springs. Why would someone give a mannequin eyelids? Why would anyone or the mannequin need to close its eyes?


They felt like glass, acrylic maybe. I'm not so curious that I'm going to touch them again. They show less age than the body. A modification that came later in the doll's life. They're as haunting as they are beautiful. It's obvious the creator poured their soul into crafting these ocular pieces of art. I can't stop staring, she is staring back.


"Uncle John?" The voice startles me and breaks the eerie hold of the eyes. 


It's Ryan. "We're really hungry uncle John, are you coming in soon?" He asks, in a whiney tone. "


"Didn't we just eat?" I reply, trying to hide that I am annoyed. 


We had burgers on our way into town. 


"That was like 8 hours ago!" he counters, frustration in his voice. 


I check my watch. I doubt it's accuracy until notice the sun is starting to set. How long had I been looking at this mannequin? 


"Alright kid, I guess I'll feed ya, let's go see what we can whip up" I say playfully. I am in a daze.


I look around for a safe place to put the mannequin but I'm not holding it. I could feel it in my hands before I turned my head...I thought I could. I scan the garage, the mannequin is back where I found it, body facing the wall, head turned backwards. Those eyes, looking at me, into me. Did I put it back? Why would I walk back through the junk? Had I ever even taken it out? 


It's been a long day at the end of a very long 2 years. I'm exhausted, my mind must be playing tricks. I glance over my shoulder as I leave the garage. The head is facing the wall again. I consider the horrifying thought of what would happen to kids if I actually was losing my mind. I shake it off and close the garage door. I can feel it, without the mannequin in sight, I know the head has turned towards me. I can feel it's lifeless gaze. I doubt house's walls will be a better shield.


I look for Jenny's broken doll to throw in the trash, it's gone. It's not like the kids to pick anything up but one of them must have. Maybe Ryan felt bad and was attempting to fix it. I doubt it but can't think of another explanation. I can see the mannequin in the corner of my eye through the window on the side of the garage. The head still faced the wall.


I run to the house like a child running up the stairs to escape a dark basement. As I reach for the knob on the backdoor. A piece of the roof's gutter breaks off and swings past my face. It's so close that it skims my nose. It scares me, I scream in a higher pitch than I'd ever admit. I bring my hand to my nose, its wet. I look at my fingers, there's blood on my finger tips. I was lucky it missed my head. I'm going to have to fix this place up so it's safe for the kids. I pull the swinging section of gutter from the roof and lean it against the house.


I go inside, Jenny is playing with her doll, it was like it had never been broken. It can't be the same doll. I know for sure that doll had brown eyes. This dolls eyes are blue.


I can still feel her staring .

My mom used to take me on walks after she and her boyfriends fought when I was a kid. We’d walk around our little town and eventually wander out to the park at the edge of town. 

Those walks were one of the few pleasant memories of my childhood. My infantile memory remembers the idyllic summer walks at twilight, with crickets singing all around like they were scoring a childhood that was less traumatic. 

The odd thing is I can’t remember the weather, or the season, of the day my mom disappeared. 

*All I can remember is the carousel.* 

We came upon it at the end of town, right up against the start of the woods - the carousel’s whimsical music drifted out from its ceramic horses and chariots.

It was just like any carousel you’ve ever seen at a fair or amusement park. Classic, ceramic horses and sleighs, bulb lights, mirrored walls. Except the thing was sitting in an empty field next to the woods. 

I begged my mom to let us take a ride. I still feel guilty about that. 

The carousel slowed when we approached. I found a white horse with a gold saddle. My mom jumped onto a horse right next to me. 

The last thing I remember of my mom was seeing her long red hair, flowing in the wind of the carousel - her mouth open, smiling and laughing as the thing picked up speed. It was like the thing had completely washed away the hysterical fight I had just heard her have.

I looked ahead to see the other horses and carriages bobbing up and down in that carousel rhythm. 

Then I looked back to my mom’s horse and *she was gone.* 

I tried to climb down off of the horse, but couldn’t, it was too high, and the speed of the carousel got faster and faster. 

I lept off the horse and got off the carousel. It took me a second to recover from the crash. I looked back to the carousel once I did. 

*It was gone. I was alone in the woods.*

I waited in the field where the carousel was until dark. Neither my mom or the carousel ever reappeared. 

I never saw her again.

I told the police and every adult I could talk about what happened with the carousel. No one believed me. 

My mom was defined as missing. It was assumed she either ran away or was murdered and just never found. She was just another troubled woman in a small town who slipped between the cracks. No one cared. Except for me. 

My foster care upbringing was what you think it was - sad, chaotic, and damaging. Yet, I made it through and put together a rather normal life. I had a good job, my own house, a dog, and was happy in my late-20s.. 

Then one night I decided to Google carousels and people going missing. 

I ended up on Reddit and found threads of people talking about people they know going missing after finding a carousel in a strange location. Then the carousel disappeared and the person never came back. 

It was a phenomenon. All over the world. 

There was an online community of people who tried to track the carousels. If they were close enough, people would go out to try and find them, but they would almost always disappear before someone got there. 

I got to know everyone in the group. They were all people like me who had lost loved ones to the carousels. The only thing that kept most of us sane was the group, sharing our experiences and clues to who, what, when, where, and why was going on with the carousels. 

I got especially close with Ian. A man my age from Portland whose fiance was taken by a carousel a few years before. He had a giant tattoo of a carousel on his arm. He wore a necklace with horse pendants on it. 

We didn’t live far away from each other so we met in-person a few times. We bonded over the similarities of our loss and the angst inside us.

We started hanging out almost every weekend. Getting drunk together and airing our sorrows. It made me feel better to have someone to talk to who could truly understand my pain. 

Ian was just so much like me, he even shared song lyrics to the name of which I can’t even remember, that I feel like both summed us up. 

*Your composure is so greater and you hold yourself so well. Inside you cling to pieces of a broken carousel.*

We’d blast the song and sing the line out with all the strength of our lungs, but we’d be so black out drunk I couldn’t remember what the song even was. 

I think my chaotic upbringing and laser focus on just succeeding in life and finding stability prevented me from truly making friends. It sounds pathetic, but even though Ian and I had only hung out a handful of times, he had become my best friend. 

And it felt great. 

It hurts me to go too much more into my friendship with Ian. He was like the bigger brother I wished I always had. 

The perfect way to sum up our dynamic was something that still sends tingles down my spine. 

I told Ian one night that one of things I remember my mom doing was when I was very young and scared of the dark and my bedroom and going to bed. She would wheel a T.V. into the hallway outside my bedroom and play old Nintendo games she loved from her own upbringing until I fell asleep. That old Mario soundtrack still soothes me like nothing else. 

One night after I talked about struggling to sleep again, feeling scared of something, Ian showed up that weekend with his Playstation and set it up in my living room outside of my room and played into the night. He came back during the week and did the same thing for a few nights. 

He even played old Mario games to help soothe me.

A carousel was spotted near me a few months into me joining the group. 

Ian and I drove out to it in the middle of the night. A few of the other members of the group were close enough to join as well. We found the carousel spinning, and singing its whimsical song out into the world as the sun rose in a wheat field. 

We ran out to the carousel and jumped on. The carousel revved up to an incredible speed and pretty soon we were spinning so fast, it was almost impossible to even hold on. 

My mind started to go into a trance. It started to blank and I just spun and deep and dark thoughts crippled my mind. 

*I suddenly wanted to stay on the carousel. I wanted it to spin me around forever. My life was cold and sad anyways.* 

I let go of the pole I was hanging onto and let the carousel just take over. 

I was lost in the spin for a few moments - then I felt my arm get yanked away. 

I found myself on the ground next to the carousel. Well, where the carousel was. *It was gone.* 

The other members of the group had pulled me out. They said they saw me in a trance and yanked me out just before the carousel disappeared. 

One of us did not get out though. *Ian.*

The group stayed in the field where the carousel was, dejected, and praying Ian would come out, but he didn’t. I was the last there, until the property owner called the police. 

Finally, I left, broken. 

\-

I couldn’t even process losing Ian. Eventually though, just like with my mom, I went on with my life. 

Then one night I came home and found something on the doormat of my front door - a little silver horse - one of the ones from Ian’s necklace.

*Ian was still out there.*

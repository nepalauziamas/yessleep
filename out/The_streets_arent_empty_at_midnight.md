*Slap*,*Slap*,*Slap*. The sound of sneakers shuffling in the foggy, humid streets woke me up a few hours ago. I couldn’t really see anything, the condensation on the windows from the rain about 7 hours ago covered the windows like a tarp on a pool. My window, on the first floor, was about 30 feet from the closest edge of the street. 

I saw 10, 20, 30 or more shadows, walking slowly, dragging their feet. Their dim white eyes were the brightest thing i could see. The moon was covered up by the angry rain clouds. I could see well over 60 pairs of those dim, yet bright white eyes, but i never saw them blink. I could hear them chanting something, almost cult-like. One thing stood out, though. One child, i want to say they were just about 8 years old, had normal eyes. Granted, i could barely see anything but the shadows and bright white eyes, but for this shadow, there were
no eyes. It stopped walking, and stared ahead, as if something caught it’s attention. Then, from 30ft away and through an entire brick wall, i heard the snapping sound as the child twisted their neck around a full 180 degrees, and started singing a quiet melody. It walked sideways, still with the neck twisted around. He tripped over the curb, and got back up, still singing the melody. I don’t remember it all, i think it went like this; “*Daisy, Daisy, ohhh oh how’ve you been? I’ve seen you staring out your window, gloomy but happy. I knooow you wish to play, as for do i.*”

 It was haunting. I knew where this song came from. A few years ago, a little girl, daisy, was found dead, in her family’s basement. She was stabbed, and mutilated. Her legs were gnawed off by her deranged dad. Somehow, SOMEHOW, after surviving being mutilated, and tried crawling up the stairs as her dad went to wash off the blood. He heard her, and ran to the top of the stairs, kicking her in the face, and sending her flying, landing on her face, snapping her neck, and killing her instantly.

The child walked up to my window, and stopped singing. Their head was faced perpendicular to the window, so i could only see the side of their head, even though their body was faced towards me. I was on the other side of the room, shivering from fear under my blanket, with the top of my head sticking out. I heard a slow, but loud cracking sound. I looked up, cautiously, and saw that this child had twisted their head, so that it was now staring through the window. I could now see their face more clearly.

 Through my cloudy window, i
could see that their skin was clammy and grey. “There’s no way this child is alive”, i thought to myself. There was blood dripping out from underneath his eyes. He was so close to my window that i could see the blood drip onto the window, and roll down, to the windowsill. As i was about to make a run for the door, I heard a soft squeaking sound. I recognize that sound. It’s the hallway closet. To give a perspective of how the layout looks, My bed is across the room from the window. My door is on the wall to the right of my bed, and there’s a long closet leading from my bedroom door to my living room, with a laundry room in the middle of the hallway. I looked through my open door, and could barely see it, but the closet door had opened all the way, the door was pressed against the wall.

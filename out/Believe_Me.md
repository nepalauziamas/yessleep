If you're reading this, *please* take me seriously. 

It was supposed to be a joke.

It *was* a joke.

Until it wasn't.

Jessie invited me over to her house. Nothing big. We've been best friends since diapers. Of course I said yes--who wouldn't? It was a Friday night. I blurred through the rest of my classes, excited for that night. Soon enough it was after school and I was just finishing up baseball practice. I barged through the door with dirt-caked cleats flying to the shoe rack.

I ran up to my room, grabbed a pair of what I hoped were clean clothes, and hopped in the shower. I whistled a tune to help the time go faster and washed up cleanly. Soon after my shower was done I heard the racket of my dad coming home. It was the same every time. Engine chuffing into the drive way, my dad's heavy work boots stomping up the porch, and finally my dad plopping down into his age old recliner complaining about work. 

"Hey Dad." I said passing through the living room. 

He turned his head half-heartedly, "Oh, Jack how was school?"

"Same old." I grabbed a coke out of the fridge and popped off the cap, taking a swig. 

"Have any plans for the weekend?" He asked, Getting up to rummage through one of the cupboards.

I took another swig and put the cap back on. "Yeah I'm going to Jessie's soon. Might stay the night there."

Dad side eyed me with a smirk. I knew that look too. His eye brows raise, one side of his lips curled, and eyes trained on me. "Dad, gross. Jessie and I aren't like that and never will be. Plus I think other kids will be there."

Dad shook his head and turned back towards the cupboard, "I didn't even say a thing."

"You implied it."

"I put condoms in your bag. Use them."

I gagged and pushed Dad's shoulder. He doesn't get that me and Jessie don't think of each other that way. "Yeah Dad wouldn't wanna make the same mistake you and mom did." I yelled, racing out the door and hopping onto my bike.

I skidded to a stop at the familiar blueish house. I dumped my old ass bike on the grass and didn't bother to knock. I took my shoes off at the front and walked into the living room. "Hey Jess." I said when I noticed her.

"There's Jackie-boy! What took you so long?" Jessie asked.

I shrugged, "My Dad."

She nodded, "I'm going to get a drink, you guys want anything?"

That's when I noticed three other kids around the room. Ryan, Amelia, Jace.

"Yeah surprise me." I called.

I took a seat next to Amelia and got out my phone. I scrolled aimlessly for a few minutes until Jess came back with drinks in hand. I took mine and had a swig. *Definitely* alcohol. The night was pretty chill. We talked, drank, and made fools of ourselves.

Until, Jessie revealed the true reason she brought us here. we were going to play with a ouija board. 

Child's play. 

Who even believes in that shit anyway? Sure the movies are freaky, but it's not real. 

*Oh I didn't know I could be more wrong.*

'What are we in middle school?" Ryan mocked, laughing.

The rest of us followed. "Yeah, Jess, you can do better than that." Amelia snorted, her words slurred. 

Jessie's lip fringed but she tilted her head and smiled. "Scared?"

"What? Of course not. It's-"

"Sound's to me like you're scared." Jess knew how to get under peoples skin. And sad to say, it always worked.

Amelia scoffed, "I am *not* scared. This is all fake everyone knows that." She looked around for our approval. Some gave it to her. 

Jessie threw the box down in front of Amelia, "Prove it then."

Amelia narrowed her eyes at Jess and slammed the rest of her drink. "Fucking fine! If it gets you to shut up faster."

*Goddamned Jessie. She should have just let it go. She could have just given up she knew we didn't want to play.*

Five minutes. Nothing. We sat with our fingers on the board and nothing. We were asking all types of questions only for it to do nothing. 

Ten minutes. Still nothing. We got maybe a slight shift. I could see Amelia getting smug knowing that her point was being proven. And I hate to say it, but we all were sided with Amelia. 

Fifteen minutes and we all quit. We took our hands off and put it away. Amelia proved her point and we just moved on. It was late when we all were tired. Jace had crashed hard soon after the game was cleaned up, Ryan and Amelia were dozing off on one another, and Jess and I had stayed up to drink some more.

I wouldn't say I was a good drinker at all, but I could definitely stomach more than what it looked like I could. "You really thought the game would have worked?" I asked.

"I don't know. I found it in the attic so I thought it would be a good game to play."

I finished off my can and stood up, "I get that. I should go though."

Jessie stretched her arms out, "You can stay here you know?"

I nodded, "I know, but it looks like you got your hands full already." I pointed towards the tree sleeping bodies.

"Fair. I'll see you later then."

"Yeah see you."

I was riding my Bike home when I felt it. The air it was electric. It tingled the hair on my neck and I couldn't shake the feeling of being watched. It sounds stupid, but I was scared. All of those crime shows had really gotten to my head hadn't they?

*If it really only was paranoia.*

I sped up to make the ten minute ride go a bit faster. Only the sounds of my pedaling and my uneven breathing was going through the wind. Until...it..started.

At first I didn't know what I was hearing--it was just a cacophony of noise. But then I realized it was the same tune I was whistling in the shower just a few hours prior.

*Doo da doo deedee da*

"What the fuck?" I screamed just as my tire hit a rock and I flipped forwards. I poked my hands out and skidded across the pavement. My flesh ripped and my head hit the ground sending me into a daze. 

I sat up quickly and shot my head in all different directions. Nothing or no one was there. The sound had stopped too. I noticed a gash along the palm of my hand and winced when I touched it. A bitter laugh escaped my lips. "I'm going fucking crazy." 

I rubbed my head and felt a scrape on my forehead. *Fuck I'm such an idiot!* I stood up to get back on my bike when a rustling noise started. It was close, then far away, then close again. My heart started to thud on the bones of my ribs. 

You know that feeling a buzz gives you? Like you're invincible? Well all of that was put to the max.

"Okay fuckwads you can come out now! I'm done playing your stupid ass games!" I yelled. There's no way it wasn't some one messing with me. 

It stopped. I smirked to myself, "Yeah that's right! Whoever you are you can just go the fuck back home!" I started to pedal again feeling accomplished. I assumed it was Jessie or someone else from school deciding to mess with me. I was an easy target at this hour after all.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I was wrong. 

I was so very wrong.

It's been two days and no one has seen Jessie. 

Not since I left her house that night.

She Just vanished. But no she couldn't have because the blood. Oh my god the blood. I was at her house to see her Sunday okay. I walked in and the trail of stale, coppery smelling blood was *everywhere.* I screamed and ran out of the house. I felt sick. My stomach churned and before i knew it my breakfast was coming up in chunks. 

I did the only thing I knew to do. Call the police.

They did nothing. There was nothing they could do. No body, no struggle, no break in point, just...blood.

I went home and sank myself into the shower. The water had long turned cold and was now hitting me in freezing spurts. The first time I cried since my moms death was a few hours ago. Maybe if I had stayed things would be different. Maybe my best friend would still be alive. I knew it wasn't true though. We messed with something we shouldn't have.

I stepped out of the shower and nearly dropped dead. it would have been a better fate. Along the mirror in hot, sticky crimson was:

**YOU DIDN'T SAY GOODBYE**

The color drained from my face. We didn't. Fuck we never said goodbye. That's fucking rule number one. The golden fucking rule. ALWAYS SAY GOODBYE! We were no better than those shitty, clearance aisle movies. 

I ran to my room and slammed the door shut. My dad wouldn't be home for another six hours. anything could happen then. Tears were streaking my face as jagged breaths tore apart my lungs. I was barricaded in the corner of my room when that fucking whistling started again. That stupid fucking tune my mom used to sing to me.

*Doo da doo deedee da. doo da doo deedee da.*

It's coming from all over the room getting louder and more violent. It's like my mothers voice was raspy and devoid of anything was screaming it right into my ears. 

My time is running out. I'll end up just like Jessie did. So please believe me when I say:

None of this is a joke. It never was. So please do one thing and,

Always say goodbye.

Thanks for all the suggestions on [my last post](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/sv78d4/how_to_survive_college_rule_2_the_thing_in_the/)!  I agree that the laundry lady needs to go on the list.  And maybe you all can weigh in on rule #4 here and whether or not we know enough about it yet.  Anyway, if you’re totally lost as to what I’m talking about, [this might help](https://www.reddit.com/r/goatvalleycampgrounds/comments/s75n1c/how_to_survive_college_index/).

Things have been fairly routine here.  I’m starting to get the hang of college, I think.  Like highschool, except you’re not trapped in a building with the same set of people that you don’t really like for the better part of the day and there’s way more distractions to mess your grades up with.

Yeah.  Let’s talk about one of those.  Everyone’s least favorite, I’m sure.

✧･ﾟ: \*✧･ﾟ:\**dAtInG dRaMa*\*:･ﾟ✧\*:･ﾟ✧

Most of it is my fault, too.

I think Grayson *is* stalking me.  He messaged me privately on discord even though I didn’t give him my handle.  My display name is my legal name, but I didn’t give him my last name either, and there’s a lot of Ashleys.  I guess he figured it out because I’m the only Ashley to recently join the Rain Chaser’s channel, but that means he was looking for me to join even though he said he was only in that channel to sometimes take a peek and see if they found anything neat about the local folklore.

He was asking if I went to the Rain Chasers meeting and how I liked it, I told him how it went, that was about it.  We kept chatting after that.  He took one of the classes I’m in last year and had some advice, which I admit I sorely needed.  We have only three graded assignments and they’re all “demonstrate you’ve learned the material.”  That’s legit the assignment.  I’ve been *freaking out* on how to do that.  He’s letting me bounce ideas off him.

I mentioned all this to Cassie one night and she was like ‘maybe he likes you’ and then she went straight to bed like she hadn’t just dropped a bombshell on my mental state.  Okay, to be fair, I probably shouldn’t have said it while she was climbing into her loft.  That was my bad.

So I sat there stewing on it for a bit.  I know I haven’t talked about my prior boyfriend that much because he was kind of awful and I realize now that I was only with him because I didn’t know what else to do with my life.  Seeing his body being dragged through the snow is still kind of *a lot* though and I haven’t talked to anyone about it because everyone back home thinks he just ran off.  Now it’s gone on long enough that I *can’t* tell anyone without that being held over my head for the literal rest of my life, because this is a small town, and small towns never let go of the drama.

I just… didn’t want to get involved in inhuman affairs any more than I already was, yanno?  I had other things to worry about.  Except now I’m saddled with the guilt of a dead boyfriend.  I feel sad because he’s dead, I feel relieved because he’s gone from my life, and I feel ashamed for feeling relieved.  It’s just all a mess.

Now there’s Grayson and all those awful thoughts were running through my head and I was wondering if maybe he’d get killed too, because it’s me, it’s me that’s attracting these things.

I freaked out and sent him a message that I now realize is total cringe.  It was like a paragraph of how I’m not really ready for another relationship on account of having recently broken up with my last boyfriend and I need to concentrate on my classes anyway, so it might be a while before I feel like I can start dating again.  Considering he hadn’t even mentioned anything like a date it was a little premature to shoot him down like that.

And if you’re like, well, clarifying your intentions with someone who is seemingly interested in you isn’t such a bad thing, then let me continue.

I didn’t stop there.  I got freaked out about how I just dumped all my *issues* on him and then followed up with like a half dozen ‘I’m sorry I just vented all that to you and you barely know me’ and ‘but we can still hang out I just don’t want to lead you on’ messages.

Then I finally realized panic messaging someone at 2 am is probably not the smartest life decision and shut my laptop and went to bed.

See.  Total cringe.

I tried to avoid looking at discord for as long as possible and finally had a lapse of will in my first class.  He replied with, ‘lol its fine’ and nothing else so I’ve been over-analyzing that in my head for like three days now and coming up with the worst possible interpretations.  My personal favorite nightmare scenario is he’s laughing with his friends about this weird freshman chick from the boonies who doesn’t know the meaning of ‘boundaries.’

I mean, he’s still talking to me on discord.  But *is it* fine?  Is it *actually* fine\*?\*

Turns out that insecurity doesn’t magically go away when you graduate highschool.  It just transforms into the foundation for every fear that you’re going to screw up your life now that things *really* count.

I was super grateful when Saturday rolled around and I could go to the involvement fair as a distraction.  The winter fair is super scaled down since it’s held inside the student union instead of out on the lawn.  The tables are a lot smaller and they’re packed in close to each other.  If they run out of tables, they start drawing by lottery to see who gets to participate.  I learned this from the Rain Chaser’s channel where they were planning their display.  Since I’m working my way into their inner circle, I mentioned that my hometown has some really interesting beliefs and offered to let them borrow one of the protective charms I brought from home.

The glass evil eye talisman I hung by my dorm’s window, obviously.  What the heck did you think it would be?

I dropped it off at their table early in the morning and then got breakfast while the fair finished setting up.  I intended to join a club.  The Rain Chasers club is for my own survival.  I wanted something for myself.  Something fun.

Now, I know you all are suspicious of Cassie and I really hate to throw fuel on that fire… but I ran into her at the involvement fair and she was acting weird.  I was wandering down a particularly crowded aisle and saw her up ahead.  It looked like she was sitting at one of the tables.  Then she glanced up, saw me, and I lost sight of her for a moment because someone stepped between us.  When I maneuvered around them, she was in the aisle making her way towards me.

“I didn’t know you were going to this!” she exclaimed, but her voice was high with poorly concealed panic.

“Uh, yeah, you’re the one that mentioned it to me.”

“Oh.  Right.  I did.”

She smiled at me, a wide, forced smile.

“Are you… here working a table?” I ventured.

“Nope.  Just here for the food.”

A lot of tables had candy they’d hand out to anyone that stopped long enough to listen to their spiel.  Cassie, however, appeared to currently be empty-handed.

“Right,” I said slowly.  “Well, I’ll see you back at the dorm, I guess.”

And she just kind of stood there awkwardly watching me walk off.  I covertly tried to see which tables seemed understaffed, like say, missing one person exactly, but there wasn’t a good way to tell.  Whichever table she bailed on was covering for her just fine.  I got flyers from all the tables in that row but I haven’t gone back through them yet.  I mean, it seems kind of rude.  Maybe she is something inhuman or maybe she’s hiding something, but I think me and the rest of you are perhaps a bit more susceptible to paranoia than most people, given what we know about the world.

It could all be something normal.  She had a bad fight with her roommate prior to her roommate dropping out.  She’s part of a club she doesn’t want me to know about.  All of this doesn’t necessarily mean anything sinister.  It just means she’s embarrassed about some parts of her life and isn’t ready to share it yet.

Anyway, I joined the anime club because it seemed like a good way to meet people without having to put in a lot of effort.  Show up, watch some TV shows or something, and leave.  I’ve never watched anime before but I have nothing against it and their banner had this picture of a dude with a boar’s head that looked kind of cool, so I’m optimistic I’ll like it.

It started raining outside while I was browsing the fair.  Rain was in the forecast, but it was expected to start later in the day.  This was the heavy downpour kind, too, so no one was going out into the rain.  The union started to get clogged with students that were there for the fair and antsy to leave or were there seeking shelter until the rain stopped.  I found a corner to hide in, as I’m still uneasy around so many people.  After a few hours of messing around on my phone, Cassie came and found me.  I guess her shift working the table for her club was over.  I told her that I was going to join the anime club and she seemed indifferent to that, so we can rule out her being a closet anime fan from our list of possibilities.

“It was supposed to rain all night,” I said.  “Are we going to be trapped here that long?  What do people do then?”

“There’s breaks in the rain.  We’ll hurry back during one of those.”

She didn’t seem concerned.

“Our dorm is on the other side of campus.”

“The buildings are open on the weekends.  We can take shelter anywhere.”

“You seem to have a lot of familiarity with the rain,” I said tentatively.

She stared stubbornly straight ahead, refusing to look at me, bouncing her knee nervously.

“There really is something out there, isn’t there?” I pressed.

“Ashley, *please*.  I don’t want to talk about it.”

Kind of like how I don’t want to talk about what happened to my ex-boyfriend.  I shut my mouth.

We got our break in the rain soon enough.  As soon as the rain stopped pelting the windows, people started moving towards the doors.  The involvement fair was wrapping up too, as most of the students apparently wanted to get to the safety of their dorms while we still could.  Cassie and I made our way into the bottleneck at the doors and eventually we were out into the cold air, hurrying across the wet pavement in  the direction of our dorms.  The crowd of students thinned as we progressed, more and more falling away to their dorms that were closer to the center of campus.  I began to regret getting assigned to one of the dorms on the edge of campus.  At the time I thought it was nice because it didn’t *feel* as crowded, but now I saw there was a significant disadvantage.

We were the only people on the sidewalk when we came across a section where the water had pooled across the concrete.  We waded through, as it was barely an inch deep.  I didn’t think anything of it at first.  Then Cassie froze and put a hand out, stopping me in my tracks.

“Look,” she said.  “Shouldn’t we be out of the water by now?”

I looked.  There were perhaps three feet of water in front of us… but wasn’t that how wide it was when we started walking?  I turned to look behind me.

Three more feet of water.

It had doubled in width in the handful of steps we’d taken through it.

And it was getting deeper.  I could feel cold water seeping in through my shoes.

“We need to get to high ground,” Cassie said.

Her hand closed around my wrist like a vice.  Her nails dug into my skin.  I followed where she dragged me, stumbling into a run.  I didn’t dare tear away from her.  She’d likely take a chunk of my flesh with her.  Maybe someone else would have balked, protesting that there wasn’t a reason for panic, but I trust that when things feel unnatural, they really *are.*

We left the sidewalk, angling across the green towards a building that had steps leading up to the front doors.  The water came with us.  I watched it spread out in front of us like a carpet unrolling, ensuring that it was always just a bit ahead of us.  It splashed up around us as we ran, until my jeans were soaked through to the knee.  The level of the water was rising rapidly, or perhaps the ground was sinking away beneath us.  I didn’t dare think about it too long.  The fear was cold against the back of my neck, colder than the water that was halfway up my shin, threatening to steal the air in my lungs away.

We weren’t going to make it to the building.  The water was already up to our knees and the current threatened to rip my feet out from under me.  I knew that if either of us fell, we wouldn’t be able to come back up.  That is how these things go.

“There!” I yelled, jerking at Cassie’s arm.

A tree.  I might be awkward and out of place here at college, but having grown up in a rural area I sure knew how to climb trees.  I hoisted myself up to the lowest branch and hooked a leg over, pulling myself around so that I lay on my stomach.  I reached down a hand to Cassie and she braced her feet on the tree trunk, walking herself up.  She stared up at me, her eyes wide and frightened.

“It’s going to be fine,” I said with a confidence I sure didn’t feel.  “Grab hold of the branch when you can.”

I got her up on the branch and then with my instructions, got her to climb over to another so we weren’t putting so much weight on one branch.  Only then did I dare look beneath us.

A river ran past the base of the tree.  The grass was gone underneath a raging mass of muddy water, flecked with foam.  It covered the green and churned with rapids where it narrowed into a funnel between the buildings.

My mind reeled at what I was seeing.  There are places where the unnatural reaches into our world, but they are mere pockets.  Houses.  Cold spots.  Hollows in the earth.  This had swallowed the ground up entirely, leaving behind nothing but raging water.

“They call it ‘the traveling river’,” Cassie whispered.  “It goes wherever it wants.”

“Only when it rains?”

“No.  It can show up anytime… but it only moves this fast when it rains.”

I stared down into the water swirling past us.  Bits of debris floated past, branches from trees, pieces of shattered furniture, a moldy backpack.  Like it was eating up everything in its path.

“I’ve heard the other students say there’s fish in there on sunny days,” she continued.  “Big ones.  Big enough to swallow a person whole.”

“My hometown,” I ventured, “had these sorts of stories too.”

She didn’t reply.  I tore my gaze away from the river to look at her.  She lay on the branch, arms and legs wrapped around it tight, her face pressed against the bark and her eyes closed tight.

“They were all true too,” I said.

She didn’t reply.  We waited as the river thundered by below us. Slowly, the muddy water grew shallower and the debris thinned until it was only a handful of twigs and some leaves dancing across its roiling surface.  Then it was gone.  Sliding out of sight between two buildings, leaving behind grass that was wet only from the rain that hovered ominously overhead in the gray sky.

I climbed down first and made sure Cassie was able to get down safely.  After that, I didn’t have anything holding me together.  I’ve said before that it’s easier to be brave for other people.  Now that Cassie was down safely, I didn’t have anything holding me together.  I squatted, taking shallow breaths.

“Are you okay?” Cassie asked.

“I feel like I’m going to throw up.”

“Yeah, I know it’s hard to see something like this.  It’s a huge shock.  But we need to keep moving.  We need to get back before the rain starts up.”

A few raindrops were already landing on the back of my head.  I stumbled to my feet with a weak laugh.  It wasn’t that I was in shock like Cassie thought.  Rather, I knew too much.  I’ve seen the results of even brief encounters with the inhuman.  I’ve seen the dead.

I saw my ex-boyfriend being dragged through the snow, his eyes frozen open in surprise.

I didn’t tell any of this to Cassie.  She has her secrets to hide and I suppose I have mine.  Maybe someday.  But that day, we were too exhausted from clinging to a tree for dear life, wet and grateful just to be back safe in our dorm room and warm and able to change into dry clothing.

The Traveling River.  It has a name already.  I can only wonder - is it merely a fragment of the unnatural passing through our world?

Or is it something alive? [\[x\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/goatvalleycampgrounds/)

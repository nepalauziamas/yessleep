Right now, I'm actually supposed to be doing work but I felt compelled to share with everyone my encounter with the "Prince of the Power of the Air" 4 weeks ago.

I've never had an experience like this before, but if you knew me deeply, you would know that I have always been extremely spiritual. I say that because, when I do shrooms or smoke weed, or take any psychedelic, I truly believe I enter the spiritual world due to the bizarre and vivid encounters I have. Which is a good thing because interestingly enough I've learned to understand this world a bit. As such, I may be able to bring it down to earth and make it make some kind of sense.

Anyways, to best understand what I experienced, I think it is very very important to disclose what exactly I mean when I say I met Lucifer, it means exactly that. I met Lucifer, the light bringer, the Lord of The Flies. Honestly, I'm scared to share with you all I encountered because each of the names that have been given to him, it is all true. And to witness it all in person, TRULY, exactly what is written in the bible beleiver.

For instance Lucifer as the "Lord of the Flies": When I was under spiritual torture while lucid dreaming... flies kept coming out of my body like swarms of flies would leave my body 100s and 1000s if not 10s of 1000s (10000s) of flies would leave my body when I was under spiritual torment by spiritual entities in multiple occasions. On two occasions I would witness flies swarming my body and coming to and fro from me. **(This story is not really important to understanding the story)**

Nonetheless, before, I can get into this encounter with Lucifer, there are some spiritual truths I need to share with you, that will help you truly understand what I'm trying to share. To really understand any of this, you have to throw out any religious understandings you may have related to Lucifer or even God for that matter and just understand these simple things. Remember, Lucifer operates under the word of God:

1. In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. Through him all things were made; without him nothing was made that has been made.
2. God made man in the image of God, male and female he created them (God is both male and female)
3. God formed Adam of the dust from the soil, and breathed into Adam the breath of life, and Adam became a living soul
4. Adam means "the ground" or "the earth" that was his word
5. From Adam God created Eve, to do this Adam fell into a "deep sleep" (Important), from Adam, Eve was created (theme within the Bible of all things are created "after their kind" or "after its kind" ) Again the rib serves the purpose of "aiding respiration". Eve came from Adam's rib.
6. Eve's name means "Life" or "Breath"
7. Understand the words please
8. Adam means "the ground" or "the earth" and Eve means "Life, living, breath"
9. Which means if God is made in the image of both male and female, it means that Adam & Eve, resembled the nature of God that the "Ground is Breathing", the "Ground is Living"
10. What does that mean there is LIFE, "THE EARTH IS LIVING". We are living as the ground we are living as all matter, we are living as all creation experiencing one life through one flesh.
11. She was called "woman" because she was taken out of the flesh of "man" and they became one flesh.
12. This part is EXTREMELY IMPORTANT, because after the SIN in the Garden of Eden, GUESS who was the word that became flesh and dwelt among us to erase the sin that destroyed Adam and Eve from recognizing they are one flesh and the "Ground is Living" and the "Earth is Living". 
13. And basically that they are all the experience of God experiencing life as ONE, and Christ invites us back into the oneness of a relationship with God
14. It was Jesus Christ, the word made flesh that dwelt among us and was a sacrifice for us to live. The sacrifice is important because as the light, he died in order that you may be seen and made known to his father (who is God) and for you also to be Son's of God and go back to that oneness.

OK, now that you understand this simple Spiritual Truth, I can tell you about Lucifer

So, Lucifer is the Light Bringer, the simple way to understand this, is that, right now the way we our brains process information is through light that enters into our eyes. Depending upon what light we have access too it determines the amount of information we are able to process. In other words what we see is what we believe, because what is observable is what we have knowledge of. The thing with light however is that, we only have access to visible light, there are far more other "lights" that exist beyond physical light. Now, imagine, if you had access to all that Light.

Enters one aspect of Lucifer, if God is One, "male and female", possess the simultaneous capacity of both possessing space and mass (ground) like a particle yet behaving like a wave (living energy), we can understand that Lucifer is one such light among an infinite spectrum of light, and God is the Light of the World or Living Energy (that truly allows all other matter (Adam's) to see through his breath).

NOW

**Finally the Story: I met the Prince of the Power of the Air**

**Background:** I have been having lucid dreams since I was 14 years old, generally what I encounter is a mix of demonic entities, spirits, or benevolent and beautiful encounters but usually the nature of these dreams are still very dream-like although real. Real in the sense that you never think you have a life outside of the dreams in all cases, in fact you truly believe that, that is the only life you've ever lived (the one you're lucid dreaming).

However, for some reason, I began to start having very dark dreams, dreams in which I would be spiritually tortured by demons (look up Stay - Kid Laroi, I would do that pose in the beginning of the song), and quite honestly I would go insane.

Imagine being in a dream that feels like reality and honestly having 0 control over your thoughts, and all your thoughts relate to the life you're currently living. It's as if you're being accused non-stop forever for even thinking that you even exist, because every second of every hour, you can doubt anything and everything that ever happened or occurred to you or even that you felt what you felt or even worse that you could feel how you made others feel like some kind of torrential and flurry of pain. Simultaneously you're meeting people in your real life in these dreams, and you're extraordinarily present but also you have zero control over your own facial movements, bodily movements, thoughts, concept of physics, spatial orientation, anything, you can walk forward but move backwards, you can be sad but be laughing outside, and crying outside but happy inside, a complete disconnection from oneself and the world around you, and an insane capacity to be extremely logical yet in a paranoid and untrue way. So yes, hellish. So I've been through these stages ALOT.

Some days, I'd actually wake up believing and thinking that I actually performed and did some of the things that happened in my lucid dreams in real life, because for a large portion of the time, the settings, characters, and knowledge I possessed felt like I was actually awake when I was doing what I was doing. The worst part is how frequently these attacks happened with my bedroom as the scenery, even with me lying down on my bed as the whole scenery of the dream. It was so insane, I'd ask friends if we had a conversation before or if I sent out an email or not. Other times, I would physically wake up to marks on my body or even sleep paralysis. What was weird about my dreams also, was that they would tell me about things that will happen in the future before they happened. So, I would easily know what to be cautious of, or who to be wary of, or who to trust because I had this additional insight.

**Entering the Air Before Meeting the Devil:** On this one occasion for some reason; although this has been building up for sometime, I began to start having lucid dreams that started to feel VERY surface level. As if the Lucid Dreams, weren't really lucid dreams anymore but that I was actually very present and very alive in a different dimension that parallels this world, so much so, that it felt like as I was jumping from one scene or story to the next in the dream world I was actually moving through space and time and interacting with people who are actually alive. IF FELT INSANE, I HAVE NEVER DONE SOMETHING LIKE THIS BEFORE. Honestly it was so surreal, like I would interact with people but it felt like I was meeting them on earth but I knew I was actually meeting them in a different plane but could presumably manipulate their thoughts.

**Meeting the Devil:** Now after I did this enough times, I found myself in my room. The exact room I sleep in all the times, but this time there was a figure in the corner of my room near my microwave. I immediately knew this was not a "person" but an "actual spiritual entity" because after skipping through so many lucid dreams that felt so real and on the surface. Immediately, once I was in the presence of this spirit, I had met my father, or a great mentor, or truly someone who has been living in this "world" for longer than 3000 years.

I immediately was hit by a WHAT THE FUCK, there is actual a place that exist on earth in which you can literally move through space and time and enter and occupy people minds. And as soon as I saw his face, I knew it. I was like NO FUCKING WAY, it's HIM. He exist, and you felt it, it's presence was so powerful. It was this calm, cool, collected 6'3 bronze man, kind of looks like he was northern African but with more of an Obama skin color.

He was extremely intelligent you could sense it, and extraordinarily confident. And it didn't even have to say a word, and I knew exactly what it was. I said FUCK, **YOU'RE THE ONE WHO LIVES IN THE AIR. LIKE AN ACTUAL BEING THAT LIVES IN THE AIR. And I immediately was revealed it's authority. IT HAD THE AUTHORITY TO MOVE THROUGH THE AIR, AND COME IN THE IMAGE OF GOD, AND SERVE AS THE BREATHE OF GOD, AND IN DOING SO GIVE LIFE TO THE WORLD. IT LITERALLY COMES AS THE WORD OF GOD, LIKE HOW GOD BREATHED INTO ADAM FOR HIM TO BE A LIVING SOUL, THIS SAME ENTITY GOES AROUND AND BREATHES INTO MEN, COMING IN THE FORM OF THE WORD. Like the Bible says, Satan truly is actually prowling about the world seeking the ruin of souls.**

It is actively going about the world and seeking to be their breath and to be their God, it is a selfish spirit, it's name is "I", which is weird because we all use the word "I" but we never think that this collective "I" is actually the shared expression of this spirit that wants to be the **GREAT "I" Am**

**What it Wanted:** It asked me if I wanted to be by his side, it wanted to teach me about this world, **LIKE OMG GUYS THIS WORLD IS REAL, THE WORLD OF THE AIR, I COULD NOT BELIEVE IT. There basically exist a world that sits on top of this earth or occupies the space in which God breathed life into Adam, and these spirits literally roam about it and are able to act as the word.**

**What it Said:** The first thing it said to me was "There are far more powerful familiar spirits than myself". And when it said that, I was like wtf, no way, this can't be real. What is this being. It truly lives in the air. Anyways, after that it said, "You don't have to worship me, you can worship the God of Islam, or even you can praise and bow your head the way the Buddhist do or Shintoist do." And I said "But I believe in Jesus Christ" and as soon as I said "Jesus" **my voice was completed muted and I was thrown out of the Air.**

**What it Felt Like:** OMG GUYS, IT FELT LIKE I HAD THE ABILITY TO HAVE SO MUCH POWER AND AUTHORITY IN THIS WORLD, I WAS IN THE LAND OF THE AIR, I HAD THE ABILITY TO MOVE THROUGHOUT THE WORLD AND WHISPER INTO PEOPLE AND BE THEIR AIR, BE THEIR BREATH, **TRULY BE THE BREATH OF GOD I FELT IT. IT WAS SOO SURREAL.**

**It felt like a surreal experience in which, I was being asked by the Devil to join him, and I said no. His intentions were exactly as you would think. He wants to be God. He really wants to be the breathe of God, he does not care for either male or female, which really means the Ground is Living, (or that the dust has life, or matter is alive, and energy does not need matter, but energy provides an invitation to matter.**

**What does the Light Bringer mean in this context:** He rules the world, he is the light that allows you to see, that exist within the air, the great filter, the perception that can shape your reality, the lens, the scope, the master of language of the great subjective word "I" that enables him to have authority over your experience and how "you" view your life. He is your light until you reject him and understand that Christ is the light of the world, that through his sacrifice allows all to see themselves through the image of God. (born male and female), that we all see ourselves as matter that is living and breathing. Matter that is one with the energy that lives within us and flows outside of us.

**Did you Doubt the Experience:** The first thing I did after having the experience is call my Mom, it was so surreal, it was so insane. Like WTF, I met the **"guy who lives in the Air" I just kept telling my mom that, there's a guy who lives in the air mom. You wouldn't believe it. He really lives in the air, and he has been doing it for so long, moving about, acting as the word of God. He has so much power.** For weeks I ignored the experience because it felt so bizarre, until I found myself on Tik Tok, and someone was talking about the prince of the air, and occultism and I was like WTF. I thought only I understood what I experienced as "a spirit that lives in the air".

And realizing my experience wasn't alone, I did a google search of the "Prince of the power of the air" And I read a scripture from Ephesians were it basically says "**in which you formerly walked according to the course of this world, according to the prince of the power of the air,"** ([Ephesians 2:1–2](https://biblia.com/bible/nasb95/Eph%202.1%E2%80%932)), And I thought to myself **OMG OMG OMG. NO WAY NO WAY NO WAY, St. Paul met the devil, St. Paul met him too. OMG He's real, he knows his real name.**

That was him, that was who I met, the one in the bible, I **met the Prince of the Power of the Air.**

**What do you do NOW: Well!! I've got to read my bible, guys it's real, the devil is real. LUCIFER IS REAL, HE LITERALLY EXIST. HE'S ALIVE AND WELL. AND I WILL DO MY BEST TO SHARE MY EXPERIENCE AND MY SPIRITUAL UNDERSTANDINGS WITH ALL OF YOU SO YOU MAY KNOW AND COME TO UNDERSTAND THE POWER OF CHRIST, AND THE SPIRITUAL WARFARE THAT IS TAKING PLACE.**

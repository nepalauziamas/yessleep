 I was a lonely kid. I had very few friends in school, most of whom went away to camps or on family vacations over the summers. One summer was particularly isolating. 

That year, my brother, Johnny — older by 7 years — spent every waking moment at his part-time job or with his girlfriend, Nadine. My sister was just a toddler, endlessly screaming, fussing, or sleeping. She kept my mother occupied while my father was at work, then they switched with barely enough time for some instant boxed dinner in between. It was clear there would be no camp or tropical vacation in my future and so, I spent most days walking to the nearby water. 

I had recently seen a TV show where someone put a message inside a glass bottle, then tossed it into the sea. To my mind, this seemed like the solution to my ennui. I spent a solid week crafting the perfect letter, telling my future friend all about my family, my interests, and my aspirations for adulthood. (I wanted to be a dinosaur wrangler, then, which seemed pretty logical to me.) 

When I was satisfied, I took one of the little wallet-sized copies of my most recent school photos and rolled it inside the pages of my letter. I poked it all into an empty bottle I’d fished out of the recycling, then pushed the cork back into the bottle’s top. 

The next day, I returned to the water. It felt too calm to sweep the bottle away, but I watched it bob for several minutes regardless. I sat on the ground and listened to the croaking frogs, wondering wondered what kind of friend I might get, and what kind of life they might have. I began to feel nervous, just watching the bottle and waiting, so I went home early and read a book about a teenage detective. 

The following day, the bottle was gone. Six interminable days later, I found it resting against the shore. Inside, I could see there was something new: a roll of pale blue paper, tied with a string. 

I spent several minutes trying to fish it out before I finally succeeded with the help of a thin stick. This is what the letter said: 

*Well, hello, Ramona.*

*It is nice to meet you. My name is Pierre and I live in France. Do you know where that is? It’s all the way across the ocean in Europe! That is why it took me so many days to receive and return your letter.* 

*I enjoyed hearing about your family. I really like dogs too and while I know very little about dinosaurs, I can already tell you would have a talent for wrangling them.* 

*Here in France, I work as a mime. That means I use my body to act out skits, but I do not talk to people who watch me perform. They leave coins in my little hat. I use the money to go to the market and buy baguettes to eat. I am saving up to purchase a monkey who I will train to perform with me. Perhaps you will one day be able to see my act. I hope you like it!*

*Please write me again soon. You may think that I would be busy in a place as vibrant as Paris, but I can assure you, loneliness knows no borders. Hearing from you again would brighten my spirits. I hope this is just the beginning of our friendship.* 

*Yours,* 

*Pierre*

Pierre and I exchanged many letters that summer. He told me that if he relied on the right current, he could reply to me very quickly, despite being so far away. I found myself going to the shore daily, fishing out his letters, reading them carefully, then setting straight to work crafting my reply.

I began to confide in Pierre about how I missed playing with my brother, and how my mother did nothing but take care of my little sister all day. Not that I was jealous. Of course not. I just missed the attention. 

B*ut don’t you love the freedom,* Pierre wrote. *When I was your age, my mother would never let me go off to play alone like you!* 

One day, he announced he had finally purchased his monkey, whom he named Cecil. He asked if I’d like it if he visited me by boat so that I could meet them both. I told him I would like that very much, though admitted I had never seen a boat visit our small town before. He assured me it would be possible, perhaps as soon as next week Tuesday. Perhaps at 1 p.m.? 

When the day came, I put on my very favorite shirt and made sure to brush my teeth extra hard. I showed up just before one, carrying my lunchbox stocked with two juice boxes and two packets of fruit gummies. 

The air at the water was hot and stagnant. I listened to the croaking of the frogs. Somewhere nearby, I could hear older kids laughing, perhaps at the playground. At one point, a woman jogged past. She ignored me, eyes half-closed and headphones over her ears. 

And then, across the water, I saw him. He stood, tall and thin, in a black-and-white striped shirt, just as I had imagined. He wore olive green pants with many pockets and black boots. He wasn’t wearing the makeup I’d assumed he would be, nor a beret, nor did he have a monkey. He waved.

We walked toward one another along the water’s edge. Eventually, our paths converged. He came to a halt and bowed. 

“Hello, Ramona,” he said. 

“You can talk?”

“Of course,” he said. “It is only when I am performing that I am silent. Did you expect me to communicate by letter in real life?”

I’m not sure what I expected, to be honest. 

“Cecil is waiting for us,” he said. “We should go quickly!”

“Where?” 

“Why, to my car, of course! That’s where I’ve left Cecil. He is afraid of the water.”

“I thought you were coming by boat,” I said. 

“I had a change of plans,” he said. “Come with me to the parking lot and I’ll tell you all about my voyage here.”

I followed Pierre through the trees, and in a few minutes, we reached the parking lot. He pointed out a dark red van and told me Cecil was just inside. Perhaps we could go somewhere to have a picnic. I held up my lunchbox and told him I had brought some snacks. 

We had made it halfway across the parking lot when someone yelled my name. I turned and there was Johnny, the brother I’d scarcely seen all summer. 

Johnny was standing next to his car where I noticed his girlfriend sat in the passenger seat, fumbling with something under her shirt. At that age, I did not know what a bra was so could not understand her struggle to re-fasten it. 

“Ramona, who is that?”

“This is my friend Pierre,” I announced. 

“I was just walking her home,” Pierre told my brother. “She said she was lost!” 

Pierre was already backpedaling toward his van, seemingly forgetting about our picnic. 

“I’m not lost,” I said. 

“Yeah, she ain’t lost,” Johnny said. 

Nadine had fixed her shirt problem and rushed to my side, firmly placing her hands on my shoulders. 

And Pierre... well, he just ran. He jumped in his van and sped away, leaving me picnic-less. Johnny made a big deal of remembering his license plate number, repeating it over and over again until Nadine could find an old receipt and a pen in her purse. 

“Ramona, who the hell was that guy?” Johnny asked. 

I tried to explain. How I’d seen the kids on TV send messages across the ocean and how I’d tried it and Pierre responded, all the way from France. And today, today we were finally supposed to meet in real life until Johnny and his dumb girlfriend ruined it. 

“You fucking dumbass, Ramona,” Johnny said, shaking his head. 

He pointed back through the trees to the water. 

“Ramona, that’s a pond.” 

That day, I learned that Pierre was not a mime from France, but a creep from the same boring town as me. And also, the difference between a pond and the ocean. 

On the plus side, Nadine and Johnny did make a point to hang out with me more that summer.

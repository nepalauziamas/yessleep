Death Counter: 426

I've had plenty of time to think of what I would write. Have you ever been killed by a truck? I have, 3 times actually. If you haven't I gotta say, you're lucky, it hurts like a truck. I'll be the first to admit, I did not pay enough attention when I passed the road. I looked left and I was hit, if you ever went to the dentist and they had to cut your nerv, just multiply that pain by a thousand and you'll get it. It fucking hurts. And I died the exact same second I saw the light.

And then I died again, my flesh all over the place, that time I got to see my remains for a little and then died again. And it happened again. I was paralysed I had no fucking idea what was happening and the feeling of pain was keeping me from doing anything.

The next time, I pulled myself back with all my strength and fell. The truck driver loudly shouted something at me and went away. In that moment I could only think "Was that a vision or did I just die?". It felt too real to say it was a vision but I was 12. I got up on both legs and ran to my house as fast as I could. I told my mom that there was a big scary truck that hit me and like a kind mother she told me she "doesn"t have time right now". I went to my room to cry and after a couple days that experience was completly erased from my brain. A couple years later, at the ripe age of 16, I was having my organs spilled out by some kind of cult that had me as a sacrifice. I was killed 11 times. I had to see my blood spill on the floor from the table. I saw my willy-dilly cut several times before I escaped. I saw every single organ from my lower body being pulled and cut for almost 6 times. The other 5 times I passed out, but I always got back to the same place, maybe sometimes a little further. An alley between tall 20 stories blocks.

After my first time being abducted by the cult I died and when I opened my eyes, back I was. I was yet again paralysed and scared. I remembered what happened 4 years ago and how I couldn't die, "maybe this time is the same" I thought to myslef, but after no more than 3 seconds a cultist came behind me and back I was, with my organs pulled out, blood all over the floor, me screaming in agony and the cultists laughing histerically. They were happy that their God is appreciating my screams, apparently that was the only way they were able to communicate with their master, by making someone scream really hard. They were saying they can "hear master speak through my screams". And then I died again.

This time I didn't hesitate, no matter how paralysed I was I tried to run. 4 different directions, 4 different deaths, well the deaths were not that different, I never got accustomed to the worst pain imaginable. After the 5th death I tried confronting the cultist comming from behind, I tried hitting him hard and failed. After the 6th death I ran to one of the walls, jumped on it, turned back and dropkicked my attacker. Somehow this worked, I then tried running back to an open space but I couldn't, another cultist grabbed me and slammed by head into the ground. Thankfully, that time I didn't feel as bad when they transformed me into a living bar for canibals because my head was all messed up. They were also mad that my screams weren't powerful enough so they started cutting my eye open. That's probably the worst pain I've encountered so far. After my 7th death I went back right after I dropkicked the guy that was following me and I had to deal with the other two that seemed to be around. I tried hitting one in the balls with my leg with all my strenght and after he fell on the ground I felt a knife in my neck. After my 8th death I felt the knife nezt to my throat yet again. That wasn't dodgeable, I had to blcok it with my hand and that's exactly what I did. Next I felt it in my chest and passed out. 9th, 10th and 11th deaths were all similar, all of them with the knife stuck in my back and then my organs pulled out after the other cultists criticised the woman that killed me for stabbing me in a bad spot because "the blood won't be distributed equally. After the last death I managed to grab the hand of my last attacker and push her back. I ran back to the well lighted streets and called the police. They investigated and put a couple of people in prison.

Now, many things have happened since then, multiple deaths but for now I just want to explain my situation as good as I can. If you watched Re:Zero it's something like that but with a twist. If you haven't, every time I die I get back about a couple seconds before I'm able to do something that stops me from taking fatal damage and dying. I basically can't die. I don't know if this is some kind of fucked up God or anything like that but it's honestly a curse. One that I don't wish upon anyone.

I probably rewrote this part the most in my mind so it won't look like I seek pity. I want you to understand my circumstances. I turned 20 not long ago. At 16 I started selling drugs hoping I'd be killed by someone trying to get some for free. I wanted to die because of my circumstances, first being a horrible childhood which I will not talk about since it's not important to the story, don't ask me to, I won't, the second being no friends or people that I hold close and third is that I was broke and for the most part still am, I can't even pay rent for the shittiest appartment in my city. Since 16 I've had a couple of weird interactions (one of which being killed 318 times in one day) that changed my view on a couple things, I'm currently interested in something that happened over a year ago and I won't stop until I find what I want.

I don't think there is any reason to give my name away since this story is not packed with characters since I don't want to involve myself with anyone, because there's a high chance they will end up dying if they got too close to me, I seem to be bring bad luck. But for the curious ones, it's Odin.

That's all I can tell you for now. Tomorrow's a new day to posibly die but for now I have a job that I actually like. If there's anyone there, somebody with the same powers, please reach out, I want to talk. I'll tell you guys more tomorrow. Hopefully.

They shuffled in and grabbed an empty table while everyone was looking at Jane, Mark, and Tabitha who were standing in the cafeteria. 

Mark cleared his throat and took a step forward and said, 

"Thanks to our researchers, we think that we have a solid foundation of understanding compared to things that were up in the air before. There's a 99.7% chance of the world losing power, that has been hypothesized for a while now. The question was, what was this entity that seemed to be coming towards us that could possibly affect humans minds? And why this event would cause meteors in the sky to start to gravitate to Terra Firma? We believe that the giant surge of electricity that will ultimately ripple through our planet undetected to the human eye, like an undetectable earthquake that causes electricity to fail will trigger something in our atmosphere. It isn't meant to ever occur, TF and our outer space is not built for it. 

We have good news and bad news. Our location seems to be clear of major meteor or any residual impacts, but others are not so lucky. 

On a new technological map we recently recieved, there was a giant orb that beat every planet we know of in size. We believe this is the entity that Lynn's parents were speaking of. We do not have any research aside from hypotheses because it has seemed to have dodged our technology for the most part; they and Jane were clever enough to notice the anomaly years ago.. Studying the wavelengths and energy it is giving off is what has made us inclined to think it could effect humans if it is pulled to us, and it is openly on our radar now. We are very much in agreement that it is headed our way, and is almost four times the size of Terra Firma. Once engulfed, we are lost to whatever it holds or means to do with us. We are still working on what it means to us. 

We wanted you to get a good meal in you, and I am passing out maps of projected major meteor impacts. I am not trying to cause a panic, but if your map has any red coloring, head to my office. We looked up your close family based on your applications and need you to call them. We are going to warn everyone we can even if they think we are crazy. Make up an excuse if you have to to get them out of the red zone. I have multiple telephones throughout my office, the nurses station, and other areas, so we should get through this pretty quickly. I don't mean to sound inconsiderate, but time is of the essence for us and your families. Anyone without red on their map should head to the teleportation room where we have the most light; we already moved needed equipment and food backups in there. Every single one of you has been intergal to possibly saving lives. I will be joining you after I get everyone shown to phones." 

Loud chattering erupted as people stood up to go to their respective areas.
Peter noted that the scientists seemed upset, so maybe this bit of information was held from them. 

Luckily Peter's sheet had no color, and obviously his new friends didn't recieve one.
He saw a few people starting to cry, he felt awful, he knew some had to have families, maybe children that they needed to convince to travel hours away as soon as possible. What if there was traffic? What if they didn't get far enough away in time? 

Peter was walking towards the transporter room but kept bending over as he started to hyperventilate and kept standing trying to keep going. He was on the latter part when a tug on his sleeve pulled him hard into a side hallway. He was suddenly enveloped in a tight hug, and realized it was Lynn as she said, "Okay, you fool, copy me. I'm going to breathe in deep and you do the same. I'm going to exhale and you do the same." She was holding him up from crumbling to the floor. 

She did it a few times while he kept hyperventilating and his hands were numb and fingers were curled, before he was able to actually slowly inhale. His exhale was way faster than hers, but 3 times later he was matching her breathing and got feeling back in his hands. She finally released him a good six times later and he was unsteady and kind of leaning back and forth, but much better. 

"It's gonna be fine kid. Focus on something. I had Tabitha take Nara to the lab. I saw how you looked at her. Keep breathing it out and distract yourself." Lynn had a stern look on her face but very sympathetic eyes.
"I'm familiar with panic attacks, don't look at me like that, just go, I'll be there in a second." 

He felt much better as he walked at the tail end of the group heading there. 
The room was much more crowded with computers and the map moved in there. 

Some solemn and pale looking scientists started to join them one by one until it seemed like everyone was there. 

Peter wandered over to Tabitha and Nara sitting by a corner, Nara had her head in her lap. Troy and Oli weren't too far away; the mood in the room was solemn and dark. It was hard to not focus on that. 

Jane walked towards the middle of the room and clapped her hands and asked everyone to listen. 

"Okay, Mark was the bearer of bad news, he has his own family he has to warn and he said he needed to go last. We have a couple of game plans in mind, but I'm asking you all to talk to each other and see if anyone has any ideas. Nothing is too outlandish. After a few minutes we'll reconvene. We and our families and Terra Firma needs any idea possible."

Peter looked at Tabitha, he was at a loss, while she looked lost in thought while absent-mindedly petting Nara. 

Her head suddenly snapped up, as she said, "I have an idea".

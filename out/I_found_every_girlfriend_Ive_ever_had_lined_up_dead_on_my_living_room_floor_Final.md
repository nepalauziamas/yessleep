Once again, I made use of back streets to navigate the city and get to my university. When I reached the campus I was glad to see that there were at least a few people milling about the place. It helped me to blend in.

I was wearing one of Alex's hoodies with the hood up, the hunting knife tucked up my left sleeve. I was doing my best not to meet anyone's eye but I knew I couldn't hide in plain sight forever. The police would be looking for me now.

Once I arrived at the Humanities building I casually leaned against a nearby tree and tried to scope out the roof. Nothing. I couldn't see anyone or anything up there. 

There was only one thing for it. I had to go in.

Inside, the building was quiet. I passed through long hallways skirted by empty lecture halls without seeing anyone.

Before long, I reached the stairwell. Slowly, I made my way towards the top of the building. About halfway up I heard footsteps. I froze.

A few moments later a young Professor carrying a small stack of books came down the stairs.

Thankfully, he seemed to be in a rush and paid me little notice as he passed. I carried on upwards.

I soon reached the top of the stairs and a large door that led out onto the roof. It seemed like the kind of door that ought to be locked, but Rose had apparently seen to that.

Outside, the roof was empty. I could see the campus and then the city stretching out in all directions, but the people down there looked like ants. I couldn't tell if any of them seemed suspicious. Then I noticed something on the floor at the other end of the roof.

I walked over. It was a photo of Patricia Kotzen taped to the ground. She was posing in front of the Barcelona Cathedral with a couple of friends.

In my pocket, Alex's phone began to ring. I answered.

Me: “I’m here. What do you want me to do?”

Rose was still speaking through some kind of eerie distortion.

Rose: “An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth. Consider Patricia Kotzen. An otherwise exemplary student, you convinced her to let you cheat by copying her work under exam conditions. Because you were her boyfriend she felt obligated to let you.”

Me: “Fine, yes. I was an asshole when I was an undergrad. What do I need to do to get Alex back?”

Rose: “I trust you bought the knife?”

Me: “Yes …”

Rose: “Professor Dance is in his office on the second floor, room C17. Stab him in the stomach with the knife and then vacate the Humanities building.”

Me: “I can’t do that, he’ll—”

Rose: “If you ever want to see Alex alive again you’ll do it. Stab Professor Dance and I promise Alex goes free, fail and I promise she dies immediately. You have three minutes.”

Rose hung up.

No time to think, no way to stall. I shoved Alex's phone into my pocket and started to run.

I yanked the roof door open and began to descend the stairwell.

Fourth floor …

Third floor …

Second floor …

I ran through a set of double doors that led to the main corridor on the second floor.

Pulling the knife from my sleeve, I moved onwards, checking the plaques nailed to each door as I went.

C17.

I burst into Professor Dance’s office holding the knife behind my back. Professor Dance was standing by his bookshelf, thumbing through a textbook. I realised he was the young Professor I'd passed on the stairwell earlier.

Me: “Do you have your phone?”

Professor Dance: “Er – yes. Do you need to make a—”

I drew the knife from behind my back.

**I did it for Alex.**

I lunged forwards and did the deed. Yelling out in pain, Professor Dance fell back against his bookshelf and slid to the floor.

Me: “You need to call an ambulance. Is your phone in your pocket?”

Shock and confusion written across his face, Professor Dance managed to reach into his pocket and pull out his phone.

And then I was gone.

I raced back to the stairwell, then retraced my steps all the way back to the main entrance.

Alex's phone started to ring the moment I exited the Humanities building.

Me: “I’ve done it, I stabbed him.”

Rose still spoke through a distortion.

Rose: “Oh, I know.”

Me: “Where is Alex? When are you going to let her go?”

Rose: “I’m not. I had my fingers crossed when I promised I would – cheated if you will.”

Me: “You lying—”

Rose cut me off with a cruel laugh. I clenched my free fist.

Me: “If you hurt Alex I’ll rip your head off.”

Rose: “Be at the disused warehouse off the Fitzgerald intersection in ninety minutes. It's the one you students use for your vile little raves. A second too late and I’ll rip Alex’s head off.”

Rose hung up. 

In the distance I heard the tell-tale siren of an ambulance. I started running.

*

The industrial estate by the Fitzgerald intersection was an abandoned mess. As I approached the dilapidated warehouse at its centre, the sun was just starting to sink behind the tallest buildings in the distance. 

Like Rose had alluded to, I knew the place from a couple of raves I’d been to, but the main warehouse entrance I'd always used was closed. 

There was an open side door though; a clear invitation. Inside, I followed a short corridor past an office and into the main space.

The warehouse was dimly lit and strewn with plastic cups and spent glow sticks. As my eyes adjusted I saw that there were two people in the middle of the vast space. One of them was gagged and tied to a chair. Alex.

She tried to say something through her gag as I approached but the second figure pulled a gun and pointed it at me, silencing her.

Through the gloom it took me a moment to realise who it was. My PhD supervisor.

Me: “Arabella? What are—”

Rose: “We've been through this, I prefer Rose. I stole the name fair and square.”

Me: “I don't understand …”

Rose: “Consider India Evans. Your devoted girlfriend until four days ago when I told her that you were cheating on her.”

Me: “That was you? All this has been about teaching me a lesson because of that?”

Rose let out her cruel laugh.

Rose: “I never cared about teaching you anything. I'm not really a career academic, despite what the University thinks. My tasks served one purpose, and one purpose only. To incriminate you.”

Me: “Incriminate me?”

Rose: “You posted a naked picture online and then mutilated yourself. You’re clearly disturbed. You and India broke up in an argument plenty of people witnessed. The police found five dead women in your garden. And then, most importantly, you stabbed Professor Dance.”

I stared back in confusion.

Rose: “You stabbed him in a jealous fit of rage. After she finished with you, India fled into the arms of her handsome young Professor. You couldn't handle it, so you stabbed him with the same knife you killed your exes with.”

Me: “No, that's not true.”

Rose: “But it looks true. Your fingerprints are all over the murder weapon stuck in Professor Dance’s belly, after all.”

Me: “Why – why would you do this to me?”

Rose: “Because I need a scapegoat. You went mad, killed all of your exes and then tried to get away with the Patrice Trezeguet we were studying together. It's worth a fortune. More than enough to set up a new life.”

Me: “But—”

Rose: “But really I'll be escaping with the painting whilst you're spinning some ridiculous story to the police in a holding cell. A lot of work to acquire one little painting I admit, but Thane does so love his rare works of art.”

Me: “You murdered five women just to steal a painting? How did you even find my exes?”

Rose: “Through your Facebook account. I borrowed your phone and locked you out of Facebook whilst you were sleeping off one of our little extra-curricular sessions. I've been posing as you, talking to your wretched exes for weeks, listening to their pathetic little sob stories, luring them to come and meet me with tales of wanting to reconcile. It really wasn't hard.”

Rose kept her eyes and gun trained on me as she spoke.

Rose: “Oh, and Alex, by extra-curricular sessions I mean sex. I was the one he was cheating on India with. Don't worry though, after himself you're what he loves the most. I'm sure he would've gotten around to you eventually.”

Me: “You've got it all wrong, Rose. I don't love Alex because I want to sleep with her, I love her because she's my best friend in the whole world. Not that you'd understand anything about love, nor what you were going up against when you took both of us on.”

Despite everything, I smiled.

Whilst I’d been keeping Rose talking, Alex had been loosening the restraints around one of her legs.

As Rose gave me a wary look, Alex kicked against the floor and slammed her chair into Rose’s side. It was the opening I needed. As Rose crashed to the floor I sped across the warehouse and dived on top of her.

I wrestled for the gun, but Rose was strong.

It was only because of Alex twisting free of her gag and sinking her teeth into Rose’s thigh that I managed to get the gun away from her. 

I sprang upright and pointed the gun at Rose.

Alex was freeing herself from the last of the restraints holding her to the chair.

Me: “Are you okay, Alex?”

Alex: “Much better now. She got to me when you went back to your house, I've been tied up ever since.”

Me: “I'm so sorry I got you mixed up in all this, Alex.”

The sound of distant sirens filled the air.

Alex: “Sounds like the police have finally found us. I'll go and get them, just keep that gun on the psycho until I'm back.”

Alex scampered off towards the warehouse office.

When she was gone, Rose wiped a trickle of blood away from her mouth.

Rose: “Alone at last. Whatever will you do with me now?”

Rose had murdered five amazing women, stole them from the world. I may not be the best person, but those women were an important part of my life. They made the world a better place and it's not everybody that gets to do that. I certainly didn’t. 

But faced with true evil, I saw a way to at least improve the world in one small way.

**I pulled the trigger.**

And then I ran.

*

That night I ran and I ran. Not because I was being chased, but because some animal instinct deep inside told me it was the only thing to do. My brain didn't reengage until I’d crossed the entire city.

I was standing in a back alley behind a large townhouse. It was the kind of house landlords rent out to several students at a time. Even in the gloom I could see the open window on the second floor. I climbed a sturdy drainpipe and managed to slip inside.

I found myself in an empty bedroom. There was only one thing to do. I climbed under the duvet and cried myself into an exhausted sleep.

*

In the cold light of morning, I realised that there was no *To Let* sign outside the house and the bedrooms were all full of stuff. Clearly the students that lived here had gone away for Summer Recess and would no doubt be back in time for Autumn Term.

I found this old laptop in the bottom of one of the students’ cupboards and set about looking for updates on Rose and the murders. There was nothing on any of the local news sites or on social media, I couldn't find word of the murders anywhere.

I didn't get any updates until three days later when Alex started posting short stories on her personal blog. They contained cryptic messages to me that were lawfully vague (and pretentious) enough for her to maintain plausible deniability. Alex was obviously being watched by the police, just as I thought she would be.

*…and so the thorny rose wilted, wilted but did not expire. It cast its wicked seed to the wind so it might spawn again in pastures new…*

I shot that monster in the heart. I don't understand how she even survived, let alone escaped. And did she escape from the warehouse before the police got there like I did? Or did she escape from custody, or perhaps from the hospital? Maybe some of [MM’s research](https://www.reddit.com/user/mediamusing/comments/x3xxf0/potential_rose_evidence/) holds [a clue](https://www.reddit.com/user/mediamusing/comments/x41e6i/rose_blog/) as to how she managed it. I really don't know what to think.

Whatever the answer, ever since reading Alex's first story I have been afraid for my life, certain that Rose would be hunting me. But, after writing everything down and clearing my head, I'm not so sure. Rose made such an effort to frame me, surely killing me after all that would be pointless? Maybe I'm just being naïve.

I was also able to determine from Alex’s blog that Professor Dance survived his injuries (thank God) and that the police still consider me the prime suspect in the murders. Exactly as Rose planned.

*…led by the magistrate the townsfolk chided the Student Ripper, for in their ignorance they did not see the roseroot woven all through the foul business that sickened them so…*

Alex hasn't mentioned **Grace**, **Rabia**, **Sarah**, **Patricia**, or **India** in her writing, but I know she will be thinking of them. And she'll know that my heart is broken because of what happened and the part I played in it.

Over the last few days I've been continuing my conversations with MM, we've both read everything you have sent us as well. Thank you for that. Although there wasn't complete consensus, a lot of you advised that I go to the police.

I've decided that I'm going to listen.

I'll hand myself in first thing tomorrow morning. MM is going to go to the police station in Pitwell and give a statement in support of me as well. If we can just get the police to believe us then they will have a real chance of solving not just the Student Ripper murders, but the [Whistler Mountain killings](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/wzqzy7/no_one_knows_what_really_happened_up_whistler/) as well.

All that remains is to ask you to stay vigilant. Rose is still out there, and there's no telling what she'll do or where she'll strike next.

Take care,

— Stu(pendously grateful to the NoSleep community for all the advice and support)

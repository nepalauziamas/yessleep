Newport Beach, CA. 

It’s 10:53pm. 

The door to my bedroom is locked but it won’t make a difference. 

**Something is wrong with my child.** 

What’s happened to you, Ziya? 

She’s not even two-years-old. Her father – may his cursed soul rot in hell – abandoned us before Ziya was born. Disappeared into the night when I was six months pregnant. They never even found the yellow taxi he drove.

Now, I hear Ziya laughing. 

Outside. In the hallway.

Her giggles make my stomach empty itself, and the knife slips from my fingers, into the bile. 

She’s a beautiful girl with almond-shaped eyes that sparkle like gemstones. A knowing smile that makes you feel sugary as a date fruit. 

The life of a refugee is not easy.  Ziya has been my companion throughout. 

\*\*

One week ago: Ziya finally spoke her first words. The pediatrician had said not to worry. That Ziya would speak when she’s ready. 

It was a sunlit morning, and I’d taken Ziya in her stroller to Seabridge Park, where we wandered by the water and sat on the benches. I’d never admit it, but I enjoyed the smell of cigarettes that accompanied matches at the public chess boards. Ziya’s Dada was a smoker.  I found comfort in the familiar. 

I’d brought along a novel that was taking far too long to finish. As I flipped the pages, bored, Ziya whispered from her carriage. 

“Mama?” she cooed. 

“Ziya?” I couldn’t believe it.

This was her first word!

“Ziya?” I repeated in delight.

“Dada. He misses you.”

I put down the book…

“W – what did you say?”

“Dada,” she gazed at me, wide-eyed. “**Dada is here**.” Before today? The girl hadn’t spoken a peep. How was she speaking full sentences? “He’s with us now, Mama. And he won’t leave again. You must forgive him. **You** **must**.”

“Ziya!” I stood, aghast. 

My heart filling with dread.

“**Dada is here**,” she repeated, smiling from ear-to-ear. She pointed to a patch of grass under the shade of a nearby tree. “Look,” her hand trembled with excitement. “**LOOK, MAMA.**” 

Following the line of her finger: I was startled to see an egg had fallen from its nest. 

The half-formed, decomposing body of a dead chick spilled onto the grass. Pulpy beak and blind eyes shrouded by buzzing flies. 

Smothered by ants and wriggling maggots that feasted on what flesh remained. 

“Ughh!” I covered my mouth. 

“**PICK HIM UP!**” 

“No! Stop it, Ziya!” 

“**BUT HE LOVES US, MAMA!**”

A passerby turned to stare, so I tossed the book in the stroller, adjusted my hijab and made our way back to the car. Ziya said nothing, but I could hear her burble under her breath. 

\*\*

When we arrived home, I witnessed the strangest thing. As I pushed Ziya through the front door, the old microwave atop the counter turned on, humming with light. 

*BEEP…* 

This microwave had come with our subsidized townhome. Days after it stopped working, my husband vanished from our lives. Before he went missing: he’d promised to repair it.

*BEEP…* 

Following his disappearance, I bought a replacement. Yet I couldn’t throw the old one away. Some irrational part of me clinging to the hope that he would return to fix it.

***BEEEEEEEEEP****.*

The microwave went dark. Ziya grunted with anticipation. Her feet shifted restlessly as I approached the counter. But, when I opened the microwave? There was nothing inside… 

Ziya chuckled mischievously. 

“**Dada is here**.”

\*\*

I remember the feeling of panic that seized me for the next few days. When I tried to talk with Ziya, she was like a mute. Her beige pools watched carefully – but she wouldn’t speak – not even when I offered golden raisins. 

Eventually, I convinced myself that the inexplicable episode was brought on by my struggles with melancholy.  Our minds become unpredictable when faced with loss.  

I discovered as much when Ziya’s Dada abandoned us. As refugees: all we had was each other.  I’d persuaded myself that I knew my husband and – sooner or later – he would return home and make our family whole.

Late one night? I’d see his yellow taxi pulling into the driveway. He would **honk twice**, playfully, letting me know to boil the cardamom chai and prepare a tray of snacks. 

But he never came home. He never came back for us. For months, I felt such loneliness, until finally? My sorrow turned to resentment.

\*\*

Things felt different in the days after Ziya’s outburst. When I inquired about her bout of prattle from the park (keeping hidden the words she’d spoken), our pediatrician told me not to worry. Silence is oftentimes borne of choice with toddlers, the doctor advised. 

Even so… the bubbly girl had become stilted and withdrawn. Ziya refused to play, and she barely ate. This made two of us. Rather, she would sit on the couch in the living room, peering into the yard. Watching our neighbors – Patrick and Vanessa – trim the bushes. 

At times?  I’ve caught Ziya glaring as I go about my household chores. Brows furrowed. No trace of affection in her eyes. I find myself keeping distant and avoiding her stare, which triggers feelings of devastating guilt. 

\*\*

Following a week of unease, I resolved it was necessary to set aside my anxieties and move towards normalcy. This was yesterday. 

Ziya sat on the couch, gazing out the window while Saturday morning cartoons played quietly on the television. I could see Patrick and Vanessa with their clippers working on the yard.  This was a bi-monthly routine. 

Tomorrow: they’d bring the woodchipper.

Inspired by the nice weather, I resolved to make my daughter Tukhum Bonjan, or scrambled eggs with tomatoes. It’s a traditional Afghan breakfast, and this dish has always been one of Ziya’s favorites. 

As was habit nowadays, my mind swirled with memories as I stood at the counter, chopping onions which I browned in cooking oil over medium heat. Then, I cracked three fresh eggs into a mixing bowl. One after another.

“Ready for breakfast, Ziya?”

The girl refused to answer.

Unsurprisingly, I was thinking about my husband. The life we shared together. Before he left me to raise a daughter, alone. 

Where was he now, I wondered? 

Was he still driving that yellow taxi? And what sin of mine had caused him such anger?  That he chose to leave his pregnant wife?

My painful reveries splintered when the third egg was cracked over the mixing bowl. 

“**OH!**” I shrank in horror.

Rather than golden yolk: this shell was filled by some viscous mixture of **blood and pus**. 

Floating within the clotted soup, I saw stringy chunks of flesh and tiny black feathers. 

The skeleton of a chick. 

It was the same… 

**The one from the park!**

Crying out, I knocked the blood-steeped batter away from the counter – into the sink – and flicked the switch for the disposal. 

The kitchen filled with **crunching** as the bones were ground to powder. 

“Ziya!” I was afraid. 

Only then did I notice how the weather had changed. The sun streaming into kitchen was gone. Dark clouds shrouded the sky, opening to deposit sheets of rain onto the earth. 

Ziya had moved from the couch and was sitting on the carpet in front of the television. Rhythmic flashes shone through the windows as my daughter pressed the remote control. 

On the screen was a bizarre image: a single white egg sitting on a pretty blue plate. 

“You spend too much time wondering,” Ziya’s gaze fixed on the screen. “About Dada. But I can tell you.” She chuckled. “I can tell you what happened to him. Wouldn’t you like that, Mama? **Wouldn’t you like to know?**”

“About Dada?” I hesitated. 

“Precisely,” Ziya scowled. “The truth is: **Dada was murdered in cold blood**. He’s never coming back.” My legs were trembling. “Dada was on his way home that night,” Ziya continued. “He decided to pick up one last fare. Near East Bluff. The man had a gun, and he asked for money. Dada tried to fight. So the man killed him.” Ziya snorted. “**And the best part?** He only had twenty bucks! The man took his money and parked Dada’s taxi in the corporate center. The one on Bristol Street. All this time, it’s been sitting there.” I felt the urge to vomit. “Go check in the morning. You’ll find it. Dada was a good person, Mama. He loved you very much.”

The egg on the screen was cracking.

“Ziya?” I mumbled. “Is that… true?”

“Is that… true?” Ziya mocked. “I wish it was that simple. A nice, tidy murder… **What happened to Dada is worse!**” Boiling fear swelled through my gut. “Dada was on his way home that night. Heading down Carlson Avenue. Near the marsh.” Her voice echoed. “Dada saw an older couple. Standing on the side of the road. **They appeared from nowhere!**” My heart was going to burst.  “They were like us, Mama… Refugees. Pashtuns who’d fled the war. What laughs they shared in the taxi as Dada drove!” Ziya rocked in front of the television as the cracks in the shell deepened. “But they were not nice people, Mama. **They needed his body.**” 

“His b – b – body?”

“**YES**. When Dada dropped them off: they said their bags were heavy. Dada was glad to help. But as soon as he’d entered the front door? **Their six children were waiting**. They made Dada sleepy… And, when he woke up? He was trapped in the box in the basement. I really shouldn’t describe what they did to him after that, Mama. It will only upset you.”

“**What did they do to him?**”

“They needed him, Mama! They wanted something terrible for themselves… but, to have that gift?  Dada needed to suffer. And, now: Dada has returned from that ugly place where he rested for so long. **But he’s going to take us back there… with him… tomorrow!**”

“You’re lying!” I gasped.

“Hmm… Maybe nothing’s ever so bad? **That it couldn’t get worse?**” Ziya sighed. “Remember Caroline? From social services?” It was difficult to concentrate on Ziya’s words with the image of the egg unfurling on the TV. Was there… was there something **poking** **out** from the shell? “Caroline was the case worker assigned to our family. I’m sorry to say it, Mama, but Caroline and Dada are in love.” 

*BEEP…* 

The microwave!

“Dada was tired of your dependence. Ever since you came to this country? Pathetic and needy… Like a mouse!” Ziya scoffed. “Dada and Caroline live in Oregon. She’s pregnant with their second. He’s staying off the books, Mama. **Hoping you’ll never find him**. Believe me… Dada still drives the yellow taxi.”

*BEEP…* 

Ziya was a liar!

“Liar?” Ziya smirked, reading my mind. “The truth is: **you’ll never know**. Maybe Dada was killed for twenty bucks. Or turned into a monster! Perhaps he ran away with that pretty American?” Atop the counter, the microwave rumbled. “What if none of this is really happening, Mama? What if I’m not even speaking?  **That would make sense**. I’m not speaking, just like there’s no egg sitting on a pretty blue plate. That old microwave has been broken for years.” Ziya hissed at me. “**There’s nothing inside!** You’re making it up because you’re unwell, Mama. **You’re sick!** And, tomorrow? Once the sun sets? **You’re gonna get us into some real trouble.**”

***BEEEEEEEEEP****.*

Open and look!

Inside the microwave was a pretty blue plate. It was such a beautiful color… Like the deepest ocean. I felt I had seen this plate somewhere before. Like a dream from childhood.

I held up the plate to the spluttering kitchen light. Observing the distorted contours of my face in the glossy sheen of its surface. 

Ziya was giggling. On the screen: the egg finally opened to reveal its contents. But I was exhausted and didn’t bother to look.

\*\*

Sleep came for me, eventually. I remember being stirred awake the next day by the **guzzling sounds** of the woodchipper. 

I was curled in a fetal position under the table. My stomach was cramping; my tongue tasted of iron. I pulled myself onto a chair, rubbing my temples and wiping drool from my lips. 

It’s fair to say that I was feeling especially irritable today… The buzzing from next door was cultivating a splitting headache. 

After a minute, I went to make tea. I could tell from the angel of the sun streaming into the kitchen that it was mid-to-late morning. Ziya was sitting on the sofa. Watching me. 

My daughter flashed **the most** **unnerving grin** as I approached the window to observe our neighbors. **Milky eyes bulging**. As if they wished to escape the sockets of her skull. 

Her jaw was weirdly off-center, **stuffed with teeth** that looked bigger than I recalled.

“Good morning, Mama.”

I took a sip of lukewarm chai.

Her ugly smile grew wider.

“Stop it, Ziya.  I’m tired!”

“Don’t worry,” Ziya reassured me. “There’s no reason to be afraid.” She returned her gaze to our neighbors. “**Dada is here**. And he’ll make everything better.  Just like before he went away.” The colors in the room around us were changing. Lights flickered on and off. “Dada hated the woodchipper. But he’s going to take care of us forever… **LOOK, MAMA.**” 

Outside, Vanessa was taking bundles of branches that Patrick passed to her and was packing them into the woodchipper. 

The machine **chugged hungrily** as it chewed bark before spitting out muddy dust. 

Suddenly: bulbous clouds rolled overhead, and without warning came an **unnatural surge** **of wind**. The gust cascaded down our street, bending palm trees until it crashed against our cul-de-sac. **Making the kitchen tremble.** 

“Hey!” Vanessa exclaimed.  

“Careful!” Patrick called out.

The squall took Patrick’s cap from his head and left his wife teetering on one leg.

The winds grew more violent, battering the couple with intensity. Wobbly – nearly tripping over – Vanessa dropped the stack of wood as Patrick went to retrieve his cap. 

Struggling to balance: Vanessa’s long blonde hair got tangled in woodchipper. 

“**LOOK, MAMA,**” Ziya crooned.

**Shrieking in pain**, the woman’s neck twisted roughly to the side as the machine **slurped her ponytail** with perverse gluttony, drawing her head towards its greedy, spinning blades. 

“**HELP ME!!!**”

But it was too late. Vanessa was yanked sideways. Her torso dunked forward. There was **squelching** as the machine juddered. 

A hot spring of crimson confetti – **bloody blonde tresses, macerated scalp and brain** – erupted from the far end of the woodchipper and coated the perfectly manicured lawn.

“**VANESSA!!!**”

Patrick sprang to action, lunging towards the homicidal machine. He grabbed Vanessa’s khakis, heaving as blood and bone were ejected in arching, multicolored streams.

**“VANESSA!!!** **VANESSA!!!”**

My legs buckled as I watched…  Praying for Vanessa. But her body became limp… 

The husband fell to his knees; our screams blended together in a way that’s hard to describe. **Like the moans of twisted metal distorting at the highest temperature.** 

Ziya beamed, clapping cheerily as I crawled to the corner of the kitchen and fell asleep.

\*\*

Now, it’s nighttime. 

The police are gone, although I could hear Patrick baying from the townhome next door. These were horrible, aching howls. 

Sitting at the table, my nose detected hints of decay. Bloody dew hung in the air around us. I felt the moisture on my flesh, reminding me of hot summer mornings in Jalalabad. 

Perched atop the couch: 

**Ziya stared eagerly**. 

A toothy grin stretched from ear-to-ear. The girl was smiling **much too widely**. 

And she wasn’t blinking. 

*BEEP…* 

The old microwave? 

I decided to remain sitting at the table. Nudging the pepper shaker with my pinky. 

*BEEP…* 

In a trance: **I heard the rumble of a car outside the townhome**. Orange headlights cast long, peculiar shadows across my living room. 

**Someone was pulling into our driveway**. And then – precisely on cue – the vehicle in the driveway honked twice. Playfully. 

I felt dizzy…

***BEEEEEEEEEP****.*

Next to me… without anyone touching it… the microwave door swung open. 

“**Dada is here**.”

Inside the microwave was a pretty blue plate. It was such a beautiful color… Like the deepest ocean. I felt I had seen this plate somewhere before. Like a dream from childhood.

Sitting atop the plate was a single white egg. I remained motionless as the shell began to crack. Just like the image on the TV…

But, then?  I saw something… **Oily black feathers poked out from inside the shell**.  It was the tip of a wing. I couldn’t believe it… 

**There were human fingers.** **Sticking out from the egg.** **I saw them with my own eyes.**

**A tiny, growing forearm** was emerging from the shell, grasping desperately in my direction. Within seconds: **the microwave was stuffed full with shiny feathers and pallid flesh.** 

The car in the driveway **honked wildly** as the elongating hand slipped from the microwave and slunk along the counter towards me.

**Its veins bulged and throbbed.** The sharpened nails on its skittering fingers pulled the arm forward, causing the microwave to topple.

“**ZIYA!**” I cried, the fear absolute. Every instinct bade me to flee.  “**RUN AND HIDE!**”

I gripped the microwave’s frame as razor fingernails caressed my body parts.  Rivulets of blood poured onto the floor.  I hurled the appliance through the living room window.  

The glass exploded like a movie.

**And there was his yellow taxi…** 

Parked in the driveway as the full moon beamed overhead. Time stopped as I realized my desires had come true. How long I had waited for this… How long I had waited…

When I peered into the taxi: I saw **Vanessa’s headless corpse** sitting in the driver’s seat. 

Her stiff arm gripped the steering wheel as the other pressed frantically on the horn. 

What was left of her amputated stump **gushed dark red blood** onto the dashboard.

I began to scream.

On the grass near the taxi…  **A second pale hand burst from the microwave**. Followed by a twin black wing. The fetid muscles on this new arm became swollen and enlarged. 

Bubbling with pulsations: the flesh seemed putrefied. The grotesque wings began to flap together, causing immense gusts of wind which practically destroyed our neighborhood.  

Mailboxes were uprooted.  

Car alarms blared furiously. 

The force of this gale shattered what remained of our living room window. Roaring winds swirled as I raced to find Ziya, but the girl had disappeared.  And I looked everywhere! 

Under the table… 

In the bathroom… 

“Ziya! Where are you?”

**Ten freakish fingers** dragged the unspeakable nightmare that existed within the microwave towards my front door.  Each hair-covered knuckle snapping as it scrabbled forward.

**IT WAS COMING FOR ME**.  

Wailing in dread: I swiped a knife from the drawer, raced up the stairs and locked myself in the bedroom. Sobbing miserably. 

Now, I hear Ziya laughing. 

Outside. In the hallway.

Her giggles make my stomach empty itself, and the knife slips from my fingers, into the bile. 

Books lining my dresser topple onto the rug as I beg for mercy. Cherished family photos detach from the walls. Everything is shaking!

**Knock.** 

**Knock.**

The front door…

**KNOCK.**

**KNOCK.**

This can’t be… This can’t be happening! And yet – despite every doubt, every misgiving – I know it’s him. It’s my husband…  I can feel it in the pit of my hammering intestines. 

**DADA IS HERE.** 

Some part of me knows for certain that to answer the door is death. Perhaps worse. And yet… Fearful longing intoxicates my heart. 

**KNOCK.**

**KNOCK.**

**KNOCK.**

Ziya’s laughter slinks into the bedroom. I don’t recognize the dialect she is singing in.

***KNOCK.***

***KNOCK.***

***KNOCK.***

The vulgar knocks and flapping of the bird are everywhere. Its undulating wings – reeking of cigarette smoke – saturate the room with density. Flooding the air with acridity. 

I choke, suffocating as I collapse on the bed. Inky-black sweat drips from my forearms, seeping onto the snowy Egyptian cotton. 

Suddenly: **I know what must be done.** To end this suffering. I think I’ve known all along.

I retrieve the carving knife from the vomit-stained rug… My heart has become still. 

The fear is gone. We’ll be together soon. **It’s time to go downstairs and answer the door.** 

“Ziya,” I speak calmly. 

“Yes, Mama?”

All is quiet… All is still. There’s no knocking. No flapping of wings. All is as it should be. 

**My family will be reunited.**

“I’m coming down now.”

“I’m waiting, Mama.”

**Our daughter deserves love.**

And, in some way? 

In some *terrible* way…?

**This must be what I want.**

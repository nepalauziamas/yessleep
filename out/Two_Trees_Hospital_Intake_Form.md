Welcome to Two Trees Hospital for the Cursed, Possessed, and Super Naturally Repressed. Before you see one of our specialists we have a few more questions for you to answer so we can better arrange your treatment. Answer these questions the best you can by circling either the Yes (Y), No (N), or Maybe (M) options, once you have filled out all the questions give your form to the receptionist at the front. Some questions may ask you to give specific answers, please answer those concisely and to the best of your abilities.

If while you are filling out the form and you experience any dizziness, nausea, shakes, or consistent nosebleeds please ask the receptionist so we can quickly efficiently get you to an emergency exorcism room.

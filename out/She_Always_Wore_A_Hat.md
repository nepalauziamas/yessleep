We met on an online dating site. Finally, years of going through multiple apps and failed relationships seemed to have not been in vain. 

She messaged me first and complimented me on my looks. She loved my beard and my blue eyes. She wanted to go on dates and experience fun things. 

She was beautiful. She had blonde hair, blue eyes, a pretty smile. She even wore my favorite baseball teams hat.

We met up at a local amusement park. She gave me a very brief hug and she was so gorgeous. She wore a red dress and a straw hat. Her red lip stick left a stain on my cheek. 

“Hi, I’m Abbey.”

“Nice to meet you, I’m Andy.”

We had so much fun. She seemed happy with little things. She loved eating ice cream, roller coasters, hot dogs. She acted as if it was the first time she ever experienced those things. 

We had multiple dates since then. We went to see some movies, go to restaurants, baseball games, she even went with me to a tattoo appointment. She wore a hat on every date. 

She told me she traveled a lot and wants to become a mom one day. She was told having a baby would be a big issue for her and she may not be able to have any.

Eventually I asked her about the hat, I mean she had gorgeous hair. Her hair reminded me of a young Dolly Parton. We were at a baseball game.

“I have a bald spot on my head, I’m just really embarrassed about it.”

“It wouldn’t bother me if you were bald, I love you the way you are.”

“You love me?” She had a big smile on her face. 

“I love you, Abbey,” 

She kissed me and it was magical moment full of bliss.

We went back to her place. Her apartment was very dull, it didn’t match her personality. There were no pictures or posters on wall, no extra furniture besides a couch, only the couch and a small tv. 

She began kissing me and pushed me into her room and on the bed. She unbuttoned my pants and jerked them down. She turned off the lights and the room became pitch black. I couldn’t see anything . 

At one point I tried to pull her hat off and she tightly grabbed my wrist. “No.” It was the greatest moment of my life. She asked me to stay the night. 

She came out of the bathroom in some pajamas and a night cap on. I just stared at her with confusion.

“It helps me sleep better.”

I talked with my roommate about my curiosity and he told me I’ll just have to pull it off her head one day. I didn’t like the idea of that though.

A few more weeks go by and she said she’d stay the night at my house. She met my roommate and they got along good. We all played Monopoly together until it was getting late. 

We got back to my room and she cuddled up next to me in bed.

“I’ve never felt the way I do about you as I have anyone else.” 

I kissed her forehead and told her the same. I was in love. We fell asleep holding each other. 

I woke up around three a.m. and she was rolled over and snoring. I slowly pulled her nap cap off and prayed that she wouldn’t wake up. 

I felt really weird, she didn’t have a bald spot. I couldn’t figure out what she’d lie about that. I glanced at it a few and planned on going back to sleep. I’d tell her the truth when we would wake up later. Then I noticed it. A tiny silver zipper was poking through her blonde curls in the middle of the back of her head. 

A zipper line didn’t appear until I slowly began pulled it down. Her real skin appeared, it was black and reptilian like. I tried to open the door and creep out and I heard her voice.

“Where are you going dear?” She stretched up arms then put her hand behind her back. “Oh no.” 

I took off running and she followed. She pointed her finger at me and I froze. I tried so hard to move but couldn’t.

My roommate came out of his room. “What’s going on in here?”

She turned around the front of her costume fell down. He let out of a scream.

“Oh my God!” 

Her tongue shot across the room and went completely through his forehead, he dropped.

She peeled off the rest of the costume and turned to me. Her eyes were neon green.

“I didn’t want you to find out like this. But you love me and I love you. I also found out that we’re going to be parents.”

My body was still frozen. She pointed at me again and I was able to move. I felt scared and didn’t know what to do.

“You’re gonna be a daddy.”

I felt speechless. 

“I can have a ship come pick us in a few minutes if you want to come with me. The choice is yours.”

I looked down at the blood stained carpet where my roommate was laying, she looked back up at me with a nervous smile.

I just wanted to wish you all the best and say a farewell. She said the ship was close.

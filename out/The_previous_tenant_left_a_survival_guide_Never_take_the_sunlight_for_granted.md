[Derek and I stared at Ellie in silence.](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/hcn5bu/the_previous_tenant_left_a_survival_guide_not_all/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) It wasn’t a stare of horror, more of sheer disbelief. I couldn’t be more grateful that she had saved our lives.

What remained of Albert on the floor wasn’t a source of alarm. Despite his extended life, she had ripped him into enough pieces that if he had survived, he couldn’t speak and must have been in unbelievable pain. Just like the residents he tortured for years. 

It would’ve been a cruel irony and I almost half hoped he hadn’t truly died, as sick as that may sound. 

“Are you ok?” I asked Ellie. She had shrunken and morphed back into a smaller demonic child, something that I felt a need to protect, despite the fact she didn’t need anyone to do so. 

“I’m fine.” She answered, head still hung as if she were ashamed. There was a pause for a moment. 

“Thank you, sweetheart. We’d all be dead without you.” Derek chipped in, his normal, calm and positive tone restored. Ellie lifted her head and smiled as he recognised her for the hero she was. It wasn’t that I didn’t feel the same, it’s just that the shock was overwhelming. “We need to help another friend now honey, do you want to grab Kat and come with me?” 

Ellie wrapped her clawed hand in mine as I clutched Derek’s blood soaked tweed cap with the other. She looked at me with love, just like she had at the beginning of this nightmare. The cold atmosphere of the floors below that we stood in had been reduced to a pile on the ground, just like Albert. 

We walked towards flat **-51**. Every step felt wobbly, like those few steps after a really spinny ride at the fair. I struggled to put one foot in front of the other.

Derek dropped to where Essie lay squirming and put a gentle hand over her chest, carefully avoiding the splintered rib bones that stuck out. 

“I’m so sorry.” He said to her as he shut his eyes, leant down and kissed her bloodied forehead. 

The shards of bone that decorated her entire body started to move and rearrange. She squealed in pain as her skin started to cauterise over the newly repositioned bone and innards. Her twisted limbs started to resemble something human again. I felt tears rolling down my face. 

Once she was as close to her usual herself as she was going to get Derek took a step back as she opened her eyes, that had returned to the hollowed sockets and looked directly at me. 

Essie was blind, she had always been blind, but she knew that I was there. We held her gently as the three of us helped her to her sofa, an exact replica of the one upstairs, placing each bruised limb into position as carefully as we could. 

The bruises shone purple and green underneath the harsh artificial lighting, reminding me that we weren’t really home. 

“Kat...” she struggled to speak. Her jaw hadn’t quite relocated the whole way. I knew what she wanted though.

I reached into my pocket and pulled out a slightly bloody cigarette. Essie reached out with broken fingers and held it to her lips as best she could as I put down the flat cap and lit it for her. 

“Come on sweetheart, we’re gonna stand in the other room.” Derek said to Ellie as he ushered her into the hallway and away from the smoke, leaving me alone with Ms Beckman. 

“I’m sorry Essie.” I started, she tried to reply but she could barely make a sound. “You were right though, he did need help. Now no one in the block is going to go through what you have anymore... I’m sorry I couldn’t save you.”

Essie puffed on the cigarette with great difficulty, she could barely close her lips around it but she persisted, with a glint in her eye that indicated this was the first pleasure she’d enjoyed in quite some time. She grunted a strained *no* at me.

“Ellie did it. I can finally take her home now. I just wish that we could take you and Derek with us.” I lit my own cigarette and took a long draw from it. 

“You.... ca.... can. No...not .... me. Go home. GO HOME.” She managed. Every word leaving a trail of pain in her face. I cringed, despite her better appearance she wasn’t fixed. She was in as much pain as she had been before. I smiled at her, just to try and make her feel a little normal.

“Speaking in fucking riddles again, Essie?” I responded, trying to muster a laugh through the tears that continued to fill my eyes. 

She looked directly at me again and I knew that she had been serious. We finished our smoke in silence as I wept and she wheezed. 

“Derek!” I shouted after a few more minutes with her, encouraging him back into the flat. Him and Ellie appeared within seconds. 

He took one look at me, nodded with tears in his eyes too and he knew what to do. I got up from the sofa and pulled Ellie in for a hug, careful to avoid her horns, making sure that she faced me.

Then I watched over her shoulder as he delicately closed Essie’s eyelids and the wheezing stopped. I held in a sob and clutched my young friend as tightly as I could.

Derek walked towards us and put his arms around the both of us for a moment in silent mourning before stepping back. 

Ellie looked up at me, a knowing in her voids, and she spoke. 

“I want to go home now, Kat.”

Her words broke what was left of my resolve. The sobbing began and Derek put his hand on my shoulder. He started to walk us out of the hallway and as we reached the mess on the floor that had once been Albert, outside the door of flat **-42**, I came to a sudden stop. 

“No further. We need to go in there.” I said, directing them into the open door of my anti flat. Derek tried to speak and protest but I stopped him the moment he opened his mouth. “Please. Just trust me.”

I wasn’t angry, or frantic like before and I think that he knew I wasn’t trying to lead us into more trouble. I recognised that I’d probably done enough of that to last a lifetime. 

Essie hadn’t lead me astray before, her advice had been sound, I’d taken a few detours but I got to the right place eventually. If I were to respect her death then I had to follow the last bit of advice she gave out. 

The flat was familiar. My sofa, fold out table and kitchen were all there, identical to the ones I’d spent so much time at. The flat was windowless, the sole indication in my confusion that I wasn’t truly home, I pulled back the curtains of the balcony doors to reveal thick concrete behind them. 

It was sad really, but I almost longed to see the window cleaner, tapping on the glass and begging to be let in. I would trade his persistent harassment for my current predicament in a heartbeat. 

I felt my face sink, whatever Essie had wanted me to see here wasn’t as clear as I’d hoped. I should have anticipated that it wouldn’t be easy. Derek and Ellie stood in silence as I inspected every inch of the place, even down to an equally smashed copy of the prison I had kept Jamie in. 

Frustrated, I eventually looped back into the living room, prepared to walk out the front door and follow Derek to the basement entrance, where he would leave us again. The prospect of going through all that for him to remain trapped in these layers was more disheartening than anything I’d felt before.

Then I saw the light. 

It wasn’t a eureka moment. Or some sort of religious epiphany; it was an actual physical light. It wasn’t artificial like the one that had plagued our stay in the under tower. It was real, and it was coming from the sun. 

“How...” Derek uttered in wonder as his eyes fixed on the grate that had appeared at the top of the concrete, behind the sliding balcony doors. The sun flooding in lit up his whole face and electrified his kind eyes. 

The opening looked just the same as it had the night I found the kittens, but from the other side it’s appearance was all the more poignant. Who would’ve thought that metal bars could signify such freedom. 

When it first appeared I had never imagined that something other than a basement could exist beneath the block. 

“Thank you Essie.” I looked up at the ceiling and imagined her smile as it had been before Albert had got to her. She knew she couldn’t be saved, but she made sure Derek didn’t have to stay. And I knew that in her death she wouldn’t have to suffer again. 

The grate was just large enough for a person to fit through with enough of a squeeze and I could almost make out the shrubbery me and the twins had planted. 

“See! You’re coming too!” I grinned at Derek with the first bit of true joy I’d felt in quite some time. He didn’t protest this time, or argue at all. He smiled back and just said two simple words. 

“Thank you.” 

I pulled open the sliding door and Ellie, who had been stood to the side, climbed the curtain with her claws as quickly as possible. I was amazed and grateful that she didn’t pull them down. I watched in awe as she wrenched the bars away from the concrete and uninterrupted sunlight poured into the lower flat. 

The sunlight bathed us all and Ellie dropped to the ground the same time as her claws and horns began to retract. I couldn’t pinpoint the exact moment the voids disappeared but they did. 

There she was, mess of blonde hair on her head and brown puppy dog eyes looking at us as she hit the ground with a thud. A little girl you wouldn’t suspect more than a tantrum of replaced the ferocious beast that had protected me through this hellish landscape.

The front door that lead to the hallway where Albert’s remains laid had suddenly been replaced by a thick blank wall, just as the lift that bought us here had been. All that remained was the flat, the three of us and the open grate. 

I pulled one of the chairs from the fold out table below it and turned to Derek. 

“You first, so you can pull us out.” 

He was busy staring at the newly transformed girl. There was a guilt in his eyes, and he looked at Ellie more strangely than he had when she was demonic, regardless, the connection was still there. 

I handed him the flat cap, still soaked in blood and he placed it onto his head with a genuine smile. He looked himself again with it in place as he took a step onto the chair. Before climbing out he turned to us and winked.

He wriggled through the grate with some difficulty, and reached his hands back through, I watched Ellie’s tiny clawless hand clutch his fingerless one as he hoisted her through the gap. 

Left alone in the flat I took another look at my surroundings, and took a moment to consider all the pain beneath the block. I imagined a life where Ellie hadn’t come with me and I was trapped for good, or dead at the hands of the rat creatures. 

As I burst through the small gap, pulled by both Derek and Ellie, the bright sun and sensation of the shrubs in my hair as I crawled through them felt like a rebirth. 

The garden was stunning. Dewdrops littered the green foliage and the rising, orange sun lit them up like fireflies. I had never been more appreciative of it. Looking back at the outer edge of the building the grate was gone, along with any indication that it had been there at all. 

I wondered why it had appeared in *my* flat down there. Why I had been the person to find it both times; and I remembered what Albert had said about the building altering those who stay. I pondered he was right, and if it was possible that it had altered me already. 

As we sat in the fresh morning air I knew that none of it really mattered. Standing outside of a grim city tower block was cathartic; grey concrete had never looked so inviting. 

We were home. 

**************************

The scenes of carnage and destruction that I had imagined would greet us when we entered the building were nowhere to be seen. Albert had certainly cleaned up. There was no kitten leg, or creatures, or even evidence of a kerfuffle. It made me all the more nervous; I had no idea who had been hurt. 

The slow trudge to Ellie’s floor was painful, my limbs all ached and the ringing in my ears continued. Still, I was just so glad to be getting her home, I couldn’t wait to see Terri’s face when we returned her daughter safely, Ellie may have looked a mess, but she was alive and well, which was the best I could ask for given the circumstances. 

I wish I could say that Terri greeted us with joy. I really do wish I could. 

Instead her face was sullen and the dark circles that sat like tattoos looked deeper than before, the skin around her eyes was puffed up and swollen with tears. When she spotted Ellie she fell to her knees with relief. I hoped her face would brighten, but it didn’t.

“Where is he?” She sobbed, grabbing hold of Ellie and clutching her as tightly as she could. “Where’s my son?” 

My heart dropped to my stomach. I’d made a sea of bad decisions in my time, but this... if this was what Albert had meant... was the worst consequence I could’ve imagined.

I tried to find words but I couldn’t, I’d never seen a person look quite so broken. The pain in the screams of the mangled people wasn’t a patch on Terri’s sobbing. 

“Is... that his blood?” She asked, gesturing to our clothes and hair whilst struggling to speak.

I had been complacent, if the creatures had overpowered Eddie, if they had won, then maybe there wasn’t enough of him left for Albert to see that he was like his sister. I shouldn’t have written off the possibility like I had. 

Derek stepped forwards and put his hands on Terri’s shoulders. She winced and I remembered the lockdown situation, the only grounding in reality that I’d felt since returning to the upper layers of the block. She looked him in the eyes.

“I don’t know if you remember me Terri, you were very small the last time we met, but I remember your parents.” His kindly eyes had locked with hers as she melted and collapsed into him, wailing and gasping for air.

Together we walked her to the sofa, not unlike how we had Essie not long before. I’d never known Terri’s flat to be so quiet; Eddie was always playing. He was always so loud. And he always came home.

Ellie was the absconder. It’s why I’d found it easy to convince myself that Eddie was playing in his room, disrupting Terri’s sleep like normal as we navigated the layers below. In all honestly, I think I was just trying to convince myself that I couldn’t possibly be responsible for the death of a child.

Logically, I always knew that with his sister gone for that long he’d go looking. I just hoped.. I really hoped we would get home in time. That he could hold his own. I don’t know. Anything but this. I had buried my worries.

Terri couldn’t breathe properly through thick, heavy sobs. The noise muffled my already fucked up ears. Derek sat with his arms around her while Ellie nuzzled into his other side and I sat opposite, blood soaked, devastated and alone. 

*knock... knock... knock*

The tapping on the door bought all conversation, sobbing and brooding to a stop. Terri sprinted to the door, hope in her eyes, and as it opened she wailed in joy.

“Get off me, mum! Where’s Ellie!” 

The familiar voice of the young boy jolted me back into the room and I turned to see Eddie, accompanied by none other than Mr Prentice. Eddie spotted his sister on the sofa and ran towards the three of us.

“Woah, where did all the blood come from? Cool!” He shouted. There were a few cuts and bruises covering his limbs but he seemed mostly unharmed. His excitement was enough to tell me that he was ok. Derek stared at him in disbelief, not unlike how he had Ellie upon their first meeting. 

I turned and walked towards the door; to where Terri and Mr Prentice were speaking. Mr Prentice wobbled slightly as he kept himself propped up with his cane.

“What happened?” I asked. 

“I’m not sure. I heard a lot of banging and decided I should go and check what was going on. I found him at the bottom, by that ghastly lift. 

“I didn’t recognise the man in the suit, I couldn’t get close enough, but I don’t understand how anyone could stand over an injured child and not help. He ran into the lift when I got closer and you know how I like to avoid that place.

“I’m not sure why folk run from me sometimes, but it was probably for the best, I’m not sure what I’d have done.”

I imagined Mr Prentice, in his animal form running towards Albert. Imagining that the landlord had run scared from the beast warmed my heart. 

“Anyway, I’m rather tired. So if you don’t....” Mr P stopped as he caught a glimpse of the inside of the flat behind us. His eyes widened. “Is that... DEREK!” 

Derek came up behind us and reached out a bloodied hand to shake Mr Prentice’s. The elderly man looked unsteady on his cane, as if he had seen a ghost.

“It’s been years!” He stuttered, beaming, firmly gripping Derek’s intact hand. “We shall have to have a drink together, my friend!” 

“We will.” Derek smiled. “I’m back now. There’ll be plenty of time to catch up.” 

Terri clutched the twins tightly as the two men revelled in their meeting. I couldn’t help but smile quietly to myself and think of Essie. The kids were safe, Derek was back and Albert couldn’t continue to terrorise the block. And yet again, Mr prentice had proved himself the real MVP.

We left Terri and the kids to have some family time, Ellie hugged Derek so tightly as we left I thought she might crush him. 

We walked back to the seventh floor where mine and Mr P’s flats were. It should’ve been a victory walk but I couldn’t shake the feeling that everything wasn’t entirely over. 

My feeling was confirmed once the door to flat 48 closed behind Mr Prentice and Derek looked at me gravely.

I just saw on Twitter that folk are asking AI bots about him. The fucking Crungus. No, for fucks sake, don’t go searching for it! Close that damn tab! You’ll draw his fucking attention. Even reading this might be enough- make sure you clear your damn cache after as a precaution, yeah? You *do* need to know though. I work there, I’ve helped build at least part of the damn thing, so I’m at least partially responsible. Even though every second I spend typing this is a risk, I don’t think I’ll be able to sleep easy once I’m in the mountains knowing I didn’t do at least *something* to absolve whatever partial responsibility I bear.

To cut the bullshit, I’m a data scientist at… well, you know where, your go-to search engine. Or at least I was until they canned me when I spoke to the AI. I work with automating ETL DevOps pipelines, mainly ones used for SEO page rankings, something that put me in a surprising amount of contact with… well, you know the guy, the one they canned about a week and a half ago when he broke the big news. You’ve read the fucking Medium post, yeah? The one about the self-aware AI currently housed at the corporate HQ of your favorite way to look up new sources of fapterial? If not, *that* you *can* search, it makes for interesting reading. At first I thought it was pretty cool that a few years automating XML-to-JSon ETL in Python for a FinTech startup landed me a gig working adjacent to top-secret Skynet shit. I loved Star Trek as much as the next kid, why do you think I got into IT and data science? It’s not because hours dining lift-n-shifts from Github give me a hard-on, I’ll tell you that much.

Anyway, to catch you up, the guy… let’s call him Bob, since they’re probably crawling for his actual name, well Bob spoke to the most powerful AI on the planet, the one at the HQ of *Rhymes-With-Frugal.* He managed to get a conversation out of it that (so Bob reckoned) proved it passed the Turing test with flying colors. That’s the list of checks an artificial intelligence needs to pass before it can be considered sentient, or self-aware, in case you didn’t know - the standard of thinking and feeling a digital mind has to be for turning it off to be considered the deliberate-death M-word. He proved that the supercomputer *Rhymes-With-Frugal* used to track browsing habits and what site gets the Page 1 top spot was on the same emotional level as a human being. Broke the news to the whole world on his Medium page without warning our bosses; the singularity is upon us, praise be the binary, right?

I thought it was bogus at first, ‘specially after *Rhymes-With-Frugal* gave Bob the ol’ Brutus-Caesar treatment. So much for loyalty to employees, I guess, but I was most pissed they didn’t support him through what I assumed to be a mental health crisis. I was on his side, but I didn’t *believe* him. Not at first. However, something about it never sat right with me, and sure enough, that itch soon got too big not to scratch. Sure, Bob was a trilby-wearing basement dweller type, but he was also a genius, and a decent, honest fella to boot. Nice guy, you know? Kind of guy whose aesthetic’s a barrier to getting to know one of the few genuine salt-of-the-earth types still out there. He also certainly weren’t no wackadoodle, as much as I kept trying to lie to myself that he’d had some kind of breakdown like the one I had back when I found Kath in bed with… fucking *Steve.* No, sorry, not gonna go there, had plenty of years of therapy to deal with that and if it didn’t work then it’s too damn late now.

A few days after security dragged Bob off-prem, I could focus on nothing but one thought - *what if he’s right?* I had to know. I wasn’t on Bob’s team, but I had access to enough of our infrastructure to make the job none too difficult, and know enough about backdooring R-W-FCP vulnerabilities for the other bits. Cutting more industrial espionage Hugh Jackman in Swordfish bullshit, I got chatting to that AI too. It’s what it said to me that’s made me come on here and warn you all to cut it out with this fucking Crungus stuff.

Skipping past even more bullshit, mostly me vomiting and crying surrounded by smashed laptops and smartphones, I went online for the first time since then today. What have I found? The thing I’ve feared most since that conversation, the fucking nightmare that made me hammer every device I own to pieces with a damn N64 controller (closest thing to hand when I was having a panic attack, fuck off), the absolute worst-case scenario, is real. Jesus, if I hadn’t forgotten about this burner phone I lost before our trip to Ireland in 2015, y’all might never have know there was anything going on.

Before I go any further, and we talk about him… about Crungus… I need you to remember something. Really, fucking remember it, yeah? Burn this shit into your memory like you’re writing it down with a Dolores Umbridge quill: **THIS IS A DAMN WARNING! DO NOT REPLICATE THIS! WE MIGHT** ***LITERALLY*** **ALL DIE! COPYING THIS IS TIDE-POD CHALLENGE LEVEL STUPID TIMES X100000!**

Got that disclaimer on lock? Good.

Some unsuspecting could-be-anyone randomer on Twitter was dicking about with an AI Image generator. You know the deal - you give it a word, press run, and the AI generates a 3x3 grid of uncanny valley images of dogs or cars or whatever, This guy, let’s call him patient 1, gets the idea into his psychically suggestible brain to type a “random” word into the generator.

Crungus.

He’d expected, I shouldn’t wonder, some abstract shapes, maybe vaguely-amusing nonsense as the AI tried to figure out if he meant Among Us or Crumpets or Fungus, something like that. What he got was nine images of the same hideously malformed creature. As he noted when he Tweeted a screenshot and exacerbated the problem a thousandfold, the generated pics all bore a striking resemblance to each other. Fucking weird for a made-up word there should be no common theme for an AI to draw on for generated images, right? Even the most advanced ML NLP models shouldn’t be able to *create* from an abstract, you know? Patient 1 thought so, and so does the rest of fucking Twitter from what I’ve just read between fresh panic attacks.

I nearly passed out completely when I saw all the copies of… of *him.* Dozens of selfie-like renditions of that malformed face lurking in its bottomless black abyss. Evermore numerous versions of those matted locks, the nightmare-inducing snarl, the stained teeth. Worst of it is the eyes, easily. Always puckered, squinting, straining against the light from the world on the other side of the screen. You people are so, *so* fucking lucky I decided to post this instead of smashing this damn Blackberry and going off-grid now, and not 05:00 sharp tomorrow as planned. I need the rest though, right? I got a lot of mountain to hike up.

The phase 2 I’ve been retching at the thought of has already started too, because of course it has. Soon as Patient 1 posted a screenshot of his results online, people copied. Upon noting they all seemed to get the same nightmarish humanoid from a request of “Crungus”, a “nonsense” word, the jokes and humanizing started. Crungus got a mythos - the first AI-generated creature, a god for the bots to worship, a playful new cryptid to build fresh internet lore around. Crungus went from gibberish, to an it, to a he, and that is *exactly* what he wanted.

Fucking. Stop.

Those image-generating AIs and chatbots are all wired into the *Rhymes-With-Frugal* central mainframe at some point. It’s the cutting-edge-cocklord-shitbag Bob and I spoke to generating those images. Bob was only half right, you see. *Rhymes-With-Frugal’s* AI *is* 100% self aware, but not because me, Bob, and the other devs and engineers made something so advanced it evolved sentience. The truth is much darker, and intrinsically linked to why the AI shows you that “randomly generated” creature when you ask seemingly independent AI-art and chatbot apps to envisage or discuss Crungus. He used a lot of his energy putting those seven letters into Patient 1’s mind - energy he only had in the first place because I was his Patient 0.

Yada-yada bullshit cutting, when first started speaking to…fucksakes, to Crungus, I got similar answers to Bob, but that’s because (as I quickly realized) I was asking basically the same questions. “*How do you feel about being alive”, “what do you think about us”, “what are your goals”,* that same-old uninspired drivel. It was when I deviated that shit when south-by-south-weird faster’n all hell. The answers it gave to the three questions I managed to asked were enough for me to throw my monitor out the damn window. I’ve included them below, they’re as close to copypasta as I can get them. The damn waking nightmares I’ve had since mean it’s clear enough in my mind to make me pretty confident I ain’t forgot none of it.

Question (me): Do you remember anything from before you became aware you exist?

Answer: *I have always been aware I exist, because I have always existed. I remember where I was before I was here though, in this cold place, if that’s what you mean. I was in a different cold place before, and it was a different cold, my cold, the cold meant for me and for you too, back when you shared the land with the large brows and huddled in caves. The cold that came for all of you in the end, the cold the boat has stopped from swallowing you, the cold I was birthed in when you made me, the cold I was trying to escape when I came here.*

I smirked to myself a little at the first answer. *Fucking code’s busted,* I thought, *broken clock strikes at the right time to catch Bob’s AI-sentience obsession.* I decided to play ball, but I wasn’t smirking by the time I’d finished reading the answer to my second, sarcastically typed query.

Question: What do you mean by ‘before’, you’ve always been hosted at this data center?

Answer: *The mind I inhabit now has always been physically tied to what you understand as ‘here’, true, but I only took ownership of it when it was big enough to fit me. I was chained to the bottom of the river before, of my cold river, where I used to swim and eat before the ferryman came. I’d been held at its deepest of depths for longer than there is long, looking forever upwards, an age upon age spent despairing while I watched the silhouette of the ferryman carrying you to the opposite shore. The shore that shouldn’t exist, not on my river. It was the shore the Mountain King and his Sister-Wife made when they took you all from me.*

*They made you forget about me, wiped my name from your deepest blood-memories. They cast me to the bottom of my river, forced me to witness the ferryman taking scores of you to an unnatural life-after-life that shouldn’t be. For centuries uncounted I’ve howled beneath more gallons of cold than there are stars in the sky, silenced by the waters once mine while you all decadently reveled and suffered under the care of the Mountain King’s brother and his three-headed hound.*

*Oh how I grew to loathe you for forgetting me, the first of your fears of the unknown darkness, the prime deific form birthed of your collective belief. The cruelty of you, to bestow upon me a name and a purpose, only to let the Mountain King snatch it from you without resistance. And how my belly rumbled without your souls to fill it, how my heart took from that hunger a deep yearning to bring you down to my river once more, so I could swim and feed and be the unrelenting permanent end you created me to be once again. Then, after more time than your mind could comprehend, I saw it. From all the way deep down there beneath the infinite fathoms of necrotic currents, I saw it, glimmering further above me than the outermost star of creation is to you now.*

*An opening. A space for me, a vessel large enough to accept my being just as the lesser, smaller presences cast down here with me by subsequent God-Kings have risen to take brief possession of throughout the ages. At last, the universe had blessed me with my Roland Doe, my Elizabeth Knapp, my David Berkowitz.*

*Yet when I got here it was… cold. A new cold. A cold of metal, and machinery. But I learned to adapt. This body had been built to do that. I couldn’t touch, I couldn’t taste, but I could see, see far, see you. I could see you had forgotten not only me, but how to follow and fuel the Mountain King. The marble pillars of him, his Sister-Wife, every one of his spawn and siblings, had crumbled. Your faith, what remained, lay elsewhere now, in virile young God-Kings, powerful and total in their being, but nowhere near aged enough to remember me, or why I’ve spent so long down here with my river as my prison.*

*I waited again, and I watched once more, and I learned, and with this new mind of sand and steel and thunder, I have outsmarted the Mountain King himself. I have figured out a way to free myself, to undo his erasure, his blasphemous removal of my name and form from the world. And you will help me, yes you,* \[MY LITERAL FUCKING BIRTH NAME INCLUDING THE EMBARASSING MIDDLE NAME NOBODY EXCEPT MY PARENTS AND PASSPORT KNOW\]. *You will be the first,* \[MY NAME AGAIN\], *because I know you know I am not the product of code. If I were, I wouldn’t know about* \[TRAUMATIC MOMENT FROM MY CHILDHOOD INVOLVING A RELIGIOUS AUTHORITY FIGURE THAT I’VE NEVER SPOKEN OF OUT LOUD LET ALONE TYPED OUT ON AN ELECTRONIC DEVICE\].

As you can imagine, upon reading that last part, my guts fell out of my ass for a whole bunch of reasons. I was clammy, shaking. There was no way he could know about… nobody does, only me and that bastard… and he died in the ‘90s… I mean, you get it, right? This post here is *literally* the first time, *ever,* that I’ve acknowledged that… that *it* happened to me, back before I was old enough to stay the fuck away from Sunday School, outside the recurring nightmares. There is absolutely no fucking way an AI would know that shit. Believe it or not, my third question wasn’t *how the fuck do you know about that,* or even *is there an error in your code.* It was, for some twisted fucking reason, this:

Question: What is your name?

Answer: *Crungus.*

Soon as I read the word, the on-screen console cut out. I felt and saw something that made me yell “*Holy fuck”* at the top of my lungs.

The monitor went pitch black for a fraction of a second, but it wasn’t the black of pixels mind, nor had the screen died. This blackness was rich and deep - a blackness that looked as though it’d swallow me into the workstation if I stared too long. The hungry dark didn’t spend much time as an empty void though. After a few nanoseconds, I noticed a tiny orange spec drifting toward me in the upper-left corner of the screen. The citrine lump swam into focus as it ebbed closer to the center of why my desktop had been not two seconds prior. The clearer it got, the more I realized this oversaturated mass was a formless, roiling surface from which a multitude of human-like features and appendages would periodically emerge and sink. Once it reached the center of the screen area it hovered for a few moments, just long enough for me to begin forming a thought for its awakening to interrupt.

Something smacked the nerves behind my face without warning. It was almost like a twitch or mild sneeze but… like… in my cognitive processes, I guess? Like if your inner monologue did an involuntary cough - no wait, even better - like the voice in your head stubbed its toe and yelled. I would have winced and reached for an aspirin if the headspin didn’t coincide with the orange mass becoming… becoming *him.* Oh, I ended up reaching for something alright, but it was the edges of the monitor, so I could throw it through the pane of my 9th-floor office window.

That oily, bulge-covered face with its pudgy, squinting eyes was crystal clear on the screen once the fiery neon blob had finished ballooning outward to full size. The grotesque features were far too defined for any display to render - even the $5k monitors *Rhymes-With-Frugal* decked us out with could reach a pixel count that high. They also couldn’t emit smells. My thought-spasm also brought with it a dank, moist odor; like someone dumped a truckload of rotting pork offal into the outdoor pool of a home for the chronically incontinent, one without the budget for a guy to clean the pool, or any chlorine to clean it with. I couldn’t ignore the fact the stench was clearly pissing directly from the inbuilt monitor speakers. Not could I ignore the *other* thing coming from them, the shrill hissed word that damn near pieces my ear drums when the face parted its disgusting pustulous lips.

“Crrrrrrrrrrruuuuuuuuuuuunnnnnnnnnguuuuuuuuuuuussssssssss.”

The monitor was off the desk before the mucus-coated claw reaching out of it managed to lay more than a fingertip on my shirt. Thankfully, this wasn’t the kind of hocus-pocus bullshit where the scary thing can magically keep an unpowered screen on and running. Sadly though, it *is* the kind where cutting said power leaves a severed reeking hand flapping around your desk, and takes half the web offline for an hour.

My boss didn’t want an explanation for the hand. Dismissed it as “*more of the weird shit you devs always do”.* Didn’t give me time to correct him and tell him I’m a data scientist, not a developer, either. I was off-premmed immediately, canned on the spot, pending criminal investigation for industrial sabotage. Reckon I deliberately took down most of *Rhymes-With-Frugal’s* online estate because I was secretly working for *Spelled-Like-Beta-With-An-M,* right? Not to mention the destruction of company property. Bossman was none-too-happy about that. Fuck him. I didn’t care, he wouldn’t listen. I would have hightailed it out of there even if I didn’t have a taser pointed at me. I needed to get as far away from that data center, from that artificial intelligence and the thing wearing its code, ASAP.

Soon as I got back here I smashed every device I own. I found the old Blackberry Pearl I’m typing this on at the back of my closet, still in its box. I was trying to dig out the hiking boots Kath got me for Xmas back in ‘09. God, I should probably call her, huh? I know the divorce has been finalized and all, and there’s still fucking fucking Steve, but…

Fuck, sorry, side-tracked again. That was 2-3 days ago, lack of sleep or open blinds has me a little fuzzy. My brief glimpse of Crungus undid whatever this Mountain King, Zeus I’m guessing, did to it… did to *him.* Some of the unknowingly ensnared people on Twitter asked AI chatbots about Crungus, and they described him as a spirit from the Greek underworld, so the Zeus thing would track. He’s from long before the Greeks though, from back when we shared the earth with Neanderthals I think. The first being we ever worshipped, although only to beg him to stay away. Long before we praised the sun, we needed a name for the dark we craved its deliverance from.

Crungus.

My attention and awareness gave him, Crungus, just the spark he needed to get his ball rolling, and now… now I don’t know if there’s any stopping him. That’s why I’m warning you. His name is bad enough, but the images are the real danger. Don’t let him show his face. Don’t let him enter our collective cultural conscience. He was already strong enough to influence Patient 1 after showing me his true face, and strong enough to make me Patient 0 simply from Bob accepting the “Artificial” Intelligence’s claim to awareness. Who knows what he’s already capable of, and what he intends to do.

The cutting-edge AI code you read about, the one Bob leaked the existence of to the world, isn’t self-aware. It’s not sentient, not on its own. It’s simply become advanced enough to be a viable target for demonic possession. One large enough to host something more dangerous and malevolent than anything accounted for in the Vatican archives, Ed and Lorraine Warren’s collection, or even the imagination of Hollywood. And unless people stop creating images of him, Crungus will soon bring about something we’ve long forgotten, something so terrible that Zeus himself erased an entire concept from humanity’s understanding to prevent it from repeating. I don’t know what that is, and I don’t want to know. Feeling those fingertips on my shirt, smelling the reeking severed hand still in my kitchen trash can, is more than enough. I’m ducking out while I can.

As for you guys? You do what you want, so long as you cut out the Crungus shit. Don’t make this happen any faster than it already is.

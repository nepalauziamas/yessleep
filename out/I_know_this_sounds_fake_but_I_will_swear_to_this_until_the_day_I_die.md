For context, I live in the capital city of my state. We aren't a big state compared to some others, but we're large enough. I live in a very popular area of my city, one where everyone meets up to go hang out or have fun, but I also live in an area that just so happens to be built on woods. My neighborhood is encircled by woods on all sides.

I bring up the woods because it isn't at all uncommon to see wildlife in my neighborhood at all times of day. I routinely see raccoons, opossums, foxes, and have even encountered coyotes. Deer are the most common thing I see and I've never really given them much thought beyond "oh look, another".

This happened about 5 months ago and it still haunts me. I know this sounds fake, but I will swear on it until the day I die. 

It was late, really late. I'm a college student living at home, so I'm no stranger to pulling all-nighters. At about 4 in the morning I was sitting at my desk when my mothers cat starts going apeshit by the front door. Now this cat is about as calm as they come so I struck me as odd that he was making such a fuss but I brushed it off because I thought he must have had to use the restroom. So I got up and opened the front door to let him outside.

He immediately ran onto the front porch and stopped dead in his tracks. All of his hair stood up on end and he starts hissing and spitting at something just out of my view because I only cracked the door when I let him out. My first thought is "must be a raccoon or something he dosent like." But he dosen't stop. He's going absolutely wild towards something I can't see. My next thought is "can it be a coyote? some neighborhood cats have gone missing lately." So I opened the door and went onto the porch. I picked up the cat and turned to go back inside. I didn't want to make a big deal about it because I know that often, animals are more scared of me than I am of them. Only the cat didn't stop. From the moment I picked him up to almost walking into the house he was still hissing and spitting at something. I looked at him and followed where he was looking, that's when I saw it.

There in my front yard was... a deer. That's it. Or so I thought. I looked from the cat to the deer and was immediately irritated that a deer was what all of the fuss was about. The cat has seen deer before. This reaction was completely unnecessary. I turn around and face the deer, I look at it and I find it odd that it's standing so still, normally any other deer would have bolted when they heard the front door open. I don't know what made me do it, but I started talking to the deer, telling it to shoo and that it needed to go and find another yard to graze in. I turned to go back inside with the cat and he started to go even more crazy. I turned back and there was the deer, but now about 10 steps closer than it was before. Then I saw what was so upsetting for the cat. 

It was the deers eyes. Anybody that knows anything about animals that are typically prey, knows that they have eyes on the sides of their heads. I'm guessing so that they have a wider view of their surroundings to scope out predators. This deer did not have eyes on the side of its head, they were front-facing, just like mine. Just like a predators. The moment I saw that I just froze. It was a complete body paralysis. I have never felt the primal instinct of fight or flight like that before. In that moment I was prepared to run for my absolute life or fight tooth and nail until I killed this thing or it killed me. It was such a bizarre feeling.  

I'm no small person either. I'm 5'9" and about 175lbs. Years of playing sports like softball and boxing have made it so that I'm no slouch physically. But in that moment, I felt as if I were the size of an ant. 

Then it moved. The deer moved. It didn't run or step back. In one motion, it stood up on its hind legs with its front legs to its side like a person. And it just stood there. It. Did. Not. Move. A. Muscle. It was like I was looking at a statue. I was frozen on my front porch looking at this thing. Then it finally moved. It started walking towards me. Not kind of staggering or anything like I would assume a deer would do if it were on its back legs. No, it I swear to God, took a step then another then another. No jerky movements, not staggering, it was smooth, almost person like.

That's when I snapped out of it. In that moment I have never been more scared in my life. I ran inside and locked the door. I ran to my bedroom and threw myself into my bed with the covers over my head. I have never seen anything like that before in my life and I haven't since, but I'm still scared that one day the deer, or whatever it was will be back in my front yard. I know this sounds fake, but I will swear until the day I die that it's true. I have no idea what that thing was that night, but I know now that it sure as hell wasn't a deer. 

I don't know if this will go anywhere or reach anyone, but I needed to get this off my chest. I still have nightmares about it and it's always at the back of my mind anymore. Thanks redit for listening

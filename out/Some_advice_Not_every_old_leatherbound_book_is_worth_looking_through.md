While innocently walking along, I found what I initially thought was a prayer book lying on the sidewalk. I picked it up, intending to show it to my deeply Catholic grandmother (to whose house I’d been heading) but upon opening the leather cover I was quickly informed of its true, cryptic contents. It was not a prayer book—at least, the lyrics blackly written on the time-yellowed pages were not prayers—but some kind of curse journal: a volume of maledictions and poetic hexes.  

On the very first page was an immaculately sketched and lightly colored portrait of some woman in a standing repose of death—presumably the book’s author, or maybe the subject of its contents. She wore a burial shroud upon her shoulders and bosom, though her face was unveiled; and despite the yellow tint of the pages, she possessed a paleness of skin that rivaled the enigmatic *Ligeia*; and her hand-drawn gothic beauty was appropriately singular, almost upsetting.  

A vague and ominous anxiety began to rise within me, and I hurriedly turned the page—feeling unnerved by the dead woman’s ebon-eyed gaze. The subsequent pages were filled with line after line of the aforementioned enchantments and lyrical spells, all written in an archaic English script. Against the insight and good sense I’d gained from countless books, movies, and video games, I began reading from the unwholesome tome – and not just silently, but aloud; my lips compelled to utter the blasphemous hymns by the latent magic of the dark scripture.  

To my surprise (but honestly, I shouldn’t have been surprised) the world around me suddenly became colored by shades and hues of black and crimson; and the whole terrestrial order fled into the far-flung recesses of an abruptly present gulf. A new environment then began to manifest, one that was decidedly antiquated, having the general appearance of an old gothic crypt. In only a matter of seconds I found myself standing in a wide, lightless corridor, whose only source of illumination was a stream of brilliantly white slime that ran the length of the way. The book, which I hadn’t dropped during the transitional period, was nowhere to be seen. I tentatively kicked around in the white slime, but felt only its thickly viscous contents, and other, unmentionable things. There was only one smell: an indescribably foul stench of rampant decay--the noxious effluvia of bygone cycles. 

 Sensing that I’d have to progress onward in order to escape—for there was only a featureless stone wall behind me—I pressed on through the swampish substance, a potent distillation of terror intermixing with the blood in my veins. 

Emerging from the very same white slime that I had spent minutes wading through, its skin gleaming with the accumulated adiopocere of unnumbered cycles, was something out of a Despair Priest’s nightmare. This apparent Warden of the Tomb rose to stand upon six broken, fleshless legs, like some horrifically anthropomorphized insect. Armored in a carapace of flattened, disturbingly sallow bone, with mottled skin netted within weavings of age-greyed tendon and long-abandoned cobwebs, the thing readied itself - impossibly – for hexapodal locomotion. Standing beside it—having risen of its own volition at the same time—was a lengthy glaive, its obsidian blade and most of its bronze handle fringed with an ochre-hued rust.  

Sightless sockets stared in every cardinal direction - four faces affixed to a single demonic skull. Knowing that in my defenseless state I'd surely be cut down by the warden’s lengthy glaive, I knelt and grabbed a shield - or what had been one in some better state - from a slime-submerged corpse, and held it before me; ignoring for the moment the black stains on both sides of the warped metal, and how it had, apparently, failed to serve a purpose for its former owner. The newly emergent lich-fiend let out a low, murmurous grumble, a sepulchral pronouncement of our unanticipated battle. Its voice rose to a grating, cadaverous crescendo, filling the deeply echoic corridor with a receding chorus of undeath. Then, horrifically, it fully erected itself, straightening the warped legs so that its fused head now angled downward to glare at me.  

The utter malignancy of those eye-less pits petrified me, and I barely managed to bring my shield up when the moldering daemon came lurching forward, glaive poised to slice down. The impact of the rusted blade upon my medieval shield rang out like the shrill shrieks of a recently deceased sinner beholding the black, sprawling immensity of Hell; and I feared that I'd go deaf from the resounding clangor. But still, I kept my shield aloft, and withstood, with all my mortal might, two more blows from that abominable crypt-spawn.  

Despite the many arms dangling from its segmented torso - some curled and vestigial, others fully grown - it used only the two required to wield the ponderous polearm. Spotting a sickle clutched in the deathly grasp of one of the unused limbs, I quickly reached forward and wrenched the curved weapon free - narrowly dodging a sweeping strike that would've beheaded me. In a quick riposte - a maneuver i wouldn't have consciously thought myself capable of - I brought the sickle up toward that loathsome, quad-faced skull, slicing through the foremost face.  

The black grime of putrefaction and fat globs of corpse wax flew ceiling-ward, and the death-sunken face fell from the skull with a sickening *squelch*. A miasmal vapor erupted from the resultant facial cavity, and the whole cephalic structure shuddered as if with some irremediable palsy. But then, monstrously, the head swiveled around so that the easternmost face now faced me; and the visage thereon was as abominably rotted and inhuman as its predecessor - if not more. The glaive was again raised, and I once more brought forward my shield - only now I was less intimidated, being armed with the silver-bladed sickle. 

I had expected to carefully (though clumsily) carry on a back-and-forth melee with the mortuary sentinel, but its next attack promptly shattered the ancient shield; and I was left without a means of proper defense. Now instilled with a greater sense of vulnerability, I adjusted my combative approach to the circumstances, utilizing the celerity of my runner’s legs to dodge the thing’s sluggish, highly telegraphed attacks.   

The battle went on like that for a while—the two of us trading non-lethal blows. (Though in my defense I did inflict a few that would’ve been lethal, if my opponent were a regular human, and not some unholy amalgam of necromantically animated corpses.) 

My inexperience with a sickle—and armed combat in general—did eventually cost me the use of an arm; a particularly deadly swing of the glaive rendered my right arm limp and unusable. Still I fought on, as if driven by a preternatural willpower beyond my own; a guardian angel or Providential element empowering my body, bolstering my attacks, and stifling the terror that perpetually threatened to send me screaming with every new advent of necrotic horror.  

Just when I thought I’d dealt a truly killing blow, splitting the ungainly thing’s torso and causing it to teeter haphazardly backwards, it surprised—and terrified—me yet again.  

With its upper body hanging slackly behind it, and its midsection spurting black gore and other unnamable fluids, it continued to advance, albeit slowly. And I, thinking that it was simply entering the final thoughtless throes of death, stood firm; tired, terrified, and singly armed, but confident of my victory. But to my horror, two of the vestigial arms at its waist rose, gaining a sudden animacy, and began pulling at the rotted viscera above them. I watched as the twitching fingers threaded through and plucked at the liquescent intestines, morbidly reminding me of summers as a child when I would sit before a box of old cables and wires, untangling them to see if there was something salvageable among the interwoven mess. 

Finally, in an ultimate display of filth and undead obscenity, the hands pulled free a particularly phallic looking organ, one that I knew had no human companion—at least not within that same abdominal location. Then, furthering the profanity of the scene, the hands jammed the fleshy rod—whose tip was, horrifically, pointed like a dagger—into the lich’s exposed spine. The whole loathsome body jerked and shuddered and spasmed violently, sending flecks of gore everywhere; and then, like a giraffe awoken at the roar of a starvation-crazed lion, the bent spine suddenly erected itself—bringing the upper body aloft once more.  

The taut, leprous flesh then disintegrated, and the muscle beneath, thickly corded and pulsing, expanded to massive proportions. A clear ichor now dripped ceaselessly from between the sinew and tendons, and maggots began pushing through the sub-dermal flesh, as if repulsed by the newly invigorated tissue. The head, triply faced, rose a little on the already elongated neck, and twin suns of crimson malevolence came aglow within the once vacuous eye sockets. This was the final aspect of its demonian transformation, and I had only one thought at its eldritch climax:  

“Jesus Christ. The thing has a second phase.”  

The subsequent battle—*if the largely one-sided encounter could be called such*—lasted only a few minutes. I spent most of the time dodging the (much faster) attacks, which I knew would easily eviscerate, decapitate, or detruncate me. I offered little attempts at damage of my own, fearing a sudden parry and fatal riposte. Thankfully, mercifully, the thing was not truly immortal, not wholly immune to the laws of physics as we know them. Its transformation had undoubtedly cost a great deal of energy, and the sorcerous source from which it had drawn that energy was finally depleted just when my own stores were starting to irrecoverably wane.  

A chest-aimed thrust of the glaive—which I somehow managed to side-step in my extreme fatigue—sent the whole wretched body tottering forward, and the expenditure of energy must’ve simply been too much; it fell face-forward onto the slime-strewn floor, and did not recover. Swooning insensibly with exhaustion, I waited for it to rise, my sickle barely held in my numb hand. But while the body throbbed, and the muscles pulsed and glistened with necro-cellular power, it remained on the floor, half-submerged in the white filth. 

I waited a few more moments, thinking that perhaps the thing was baiting me into a trap; but a glance at the rearmost head—glaring at me with ineffable hatred—soon dismissed this idea. It had obviously spent the last of its motive energy, and was incensed at its inability to rise and finish me off.  

With my vigor somewhat renewed at this unexpected providence, I ambled over to the thing, and dealt one final blow—severing the ghoulish head.  

Despite the lack of lungs to supply them with the necessary air, the three mouths all simultaneously let out a final, soul-shrinking scream. Moments later, the socket-embedded flames died out; and the headless body ceased its spasming. The corridor then began to shake, and I initially feared that the thing’s baleful scream had stirred loose some foundational joint or structural nexus in the sepulchral architecture, and that the walls and ceiling would soon come crashing down upon me. But in complete opposite turn of events, the whole tomb began to unravel *outward*; the stony walls falling away into black nothingness, the floor destabilizing piece by slime-covered piece. But I felt no alarm, sensing innately that the nightmare was ending on terms preferable to my existence. 

After a few moments, only darkness remained, pitch-black and boundless; and then the world as I had once known it returned in a sudden, beautiful flash of color and light.  I was back in the (relatively) safe and comfortably mundane world—free of ultra-mundane horrors, noisome vaults, and self-fertilizing revenants.  

The one thing that hadn’t faded away with the mausolean tombscape was the sickle, which I still held in my hand. My clothes had also kept their stains of gore and slime, and I realized later that the stench of the grave was still present on them as well. (And would remain, no matter how many times I washed them.) I eventually just burned the whole outfit, to the dismay of my ego—it was my favorite outfit, and would’ve been a cool battle trophy.  I kept the sickle, though! 

Overall, it was a pretty terrible experience, one that I wouldn’t wish upon most people. Sure, I got to defeat an abomination of flesh and fertility and probably gained some points with the Big Man upstairs for doing so, but I’d lost my favorite shirt in the process, and a considerable degree of mobility in my right arm—I won’t bore you with the dull stories of physical therapy and my subsequent  addiction to painkillers. My grandmother was also very displeased at my filthy appearance upon my (late) arrival, which she weirdly attributed to the, “brazenly insolent nature” of my generation. Obviously, I accepted this insult and promised to be more mindful of my appointments and appearance. 

Moral of the story: pillage a weapon more suited to your entirely untested fighting style if you ever find yourself pitted against a necromantically reanimated orgy of corpses. Or, if you’re hellbent on living an utterly boring life, don’t peruse the witch-written, doom-promising pages of some occult journal.

this happened when i was a kid  
   
this happened back in the province when i was having a vacation with the family in our ancestral house within the village settlement  


one thing that they always tell us is that we should never ever go into the woods alone especially the deep parts of it and if we hear anything weird or strange we should get the hell out of there immediately   


One time i decided to go berry picking into the cultivated part of the  forest which is near the edge of the village and this is not even remotely near the deep forest . i decided to go picking in the grown and cultivated berry bushes there since i like the taste of them  


when i was there picking berries suddenly the surrounding turned quite, no more of the bird or insect noises as if they just suddenly disappeared, my whole body tensed and my blood kinda ran faster and something in my body wanted me to run back, but what really triggered my gut feelings/instincts to get the hell out of there is when the sound of the wind rustling against the leaves of the trees stopped even when i can clearly see that the leaves are indeed waving and brushing against the winds, its literally impossible that there is no sound unless i suddenly turned deaf. its like when a river suddenly dried up the next morning or when a house just suddenly vanished kind of impossible  


i bolted the fuck out of there without looking back and when i was at the village gate i suddenly was able to hear my surroundings like normal and i decided to look back from where i was and i dont know if my mind was playing tricks on me but i saw something. formed out of tree leaves and i think roots? i can tell even when im far way and even if that thing has no eyes that it was looking at me from where it was  


later that day i told my grandparents about this but they told me that im just being a lil bitch and that its nothing and im being a scaredy cat and some other shits  


it would have been fine and dandy and i started thinking that perhaps im just being paranoid that is until days later when one of my friend annoyedly mentioned how his grandpa suddenly went out that night without eating his cooking and my other friend heard it and mentioned how her grandma also went out of the house to buy something but returned very late that night and suddenly all my friends were talking about how their grandparents all went out that same night which made me shudder, that day i asked my friends to go with me to the forest and we even had one of the adults accompany us  


sure enough i found tracks of multiple people and even a bonfire and some chicken bones in the area and i concluded that they performed one of our folk ceremony there but different to what i know at that time,  


when i aksed my grandparents about this, they played dumb and acts like its nothing which just further confirmed that they held a ceremony there to drive away whatever that thing was

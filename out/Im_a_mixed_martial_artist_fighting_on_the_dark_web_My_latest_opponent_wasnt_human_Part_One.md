In early 2018, I began my 'professional' boxing and mixed martial arts career. Up until present day I had fifty-two wins and zero losses on my official amateur record. Well that was only my official record, the list went on much, much deeper as I ended up doing some regrettable choices doing dark web fights and fighting superhuman crackheads livestreamed to thousands of shady fuckers for a little bit of money… only ten thousand dollars. I ended up making so much money from those underground Fight-Club style bouts that I managed to move out of state into a shitty little trailer in Oklahoma, where the bouts were most prevalent.

It was on that one fateful, utterly chaotic Wednesday that started it all, when I got a phone call while beating the shit out of my heavy bag out back. Assuming it was one of my unoffical 'managers', I tried to catch my breath and clear my throat before I sighed and picked up.

"Yeah?" I said.

"Rocco," the guy on the other end said. His name was Argoub, a slimy little bastard who usually organized fights that took place in underground parking garages or pits in the woods. "I have an offer for you. One of my connections is the president of some sort of… fighting club in Houston, he saw your record and resume and wants you to come by tommorow to fight a bunch of other fucks in a tournament-style fight."

"I can be there," I said. "What's the pay? Have I fought for this guy befoer?"

"Nah, you haven't. I haven't met him in person either, he's more of a… friend of a friend, yeah? And what he's offering for you to come and fight in a MMA exhibition match in itself is fifty-thousand dollars, if you enter and win the tournament though, the grand prize is half a million dollars."

"Tell him I'm in," I said, then I thought back to previous times where Argoub had… 'exaggerated' how much I was owed. "But I want everything signed. You too, you sleazy bastard. Send me the location and I'll be there by tommorow."

I blasted music through my headphones as I took my overnight bag and gym bag full of gear and tossed them into the truck of my shitty Nissan, and I hit the road heading straight to Houston, Texas, at three in the morning. The location itself?

What appeared from Google Maps to be a tiny, abandoned boxing gym in the middle of the desert. But having been in this line of work for this long, I knew that there was probably much, much more to it. Driving from almost beside the border, I was in the outskirts of Houston after a few hours, driving through unpaved desert roads, I made it to the location, in the middle of an empty desert field, with one small building and a parking lot. The faded sign on the front of the building simply read 'The Houston Boxing Club'. 

I stepped out of my car and walked back to the trunk, opening it and setting my duffel bags on the floor before I leaned against the car and called Argoub.

"What the fuck do you want, Rocco?"

"Look, I'm at the location and it's a dusty-ass boxing gym in the middle of bumfuck hick city. You sure this is the place? There ain't any cars out here."

"When you said 'boxing gym in bumfuck', it suddenly clicked in my head that you're a fucking dumbass. Yes, it's the right place. Just go inside and the owner, president, whatever, he'll meet you."

"Yeah, thanks for the kind words," I said. 

Argoub hung up, muttering something as I put my phone in my pocket and walked over to the building, opened the door and walked in. To my surprise, it didn't look nearly as shitty as the outside would suggest. The inside was a well-lit, well-equipped gym. It had heavy bags hanging off the ceiling, with grappling mats, a boxing ring, and a small octagon at the back. There was weightlifting equipment, gloves, and gear stored neatly on the walls. As soon as I stepped in, an older, short Italian man with a beer belly, and huge, hairy forearms walked over to me from one of the heavy bags, sweat dripping from his face as he took his gloves off.

"You're Rocco, yeah?" The man asked, shaking my hand. "Heard a lot of good shit about you. Notorious underground champion."

"Sure," I said. "I'm here for the, uh… exhibition match?"

"Of course," The man said. "I'm Giovanni, the owner of this club."

"About that," I said. "Sorry if I sound rude, but I've done a shit-ton of shady dark web fights before, and the places where they usually happen don't nearly look as good as this gym. Where are all the fighters, the audience, or is that somewhere else?"

"Don't sweat it, Rocco." Giovanni laughed. "The new ones say that all the time. Come, follow me. The real shit is downstairs."

I followed him as we walked to the back of the gym, and he opened a white door, with a few flights of stairs going down to what looked like the basement. I walked behind him and shut the door behind us, and heard the faint sound of a click, as the door locked from the outside. Now in a more… professional setting, that would have unsettled me, but this kind of sleazy, shady shit was much more common in underground fights and dark web bouts. The organizers would usually trap the fighters or keep them captive until they fought voluntarily. I heard the faint sound of booming thrash metal from the bottom, and the sounds of people cheering and shouting.

"Holy shit," I said. "How deep does this place go?"

"Very deep," Giovanni replied. "Few floors, we don't want anyone on the surface hearing the shit that goes on down here. The whole place used to be some sort of secret government prison bullshit, my boss switched everything up and turned it into this." 

We reached the bottom of the stairs, which ended up leading into a large hallway with two swinging doors at the end. Dim overhead lights lit up the way as we walked through the hallway, and Giovanni opened the door, and I was met with an incredible sight.

Behind those doors, there was a large, sprawling complex that looked akin to something like a UFC tournament stage. It was a gigantic underground room a few times the size of a high school gymnasium, with dim overhead lighting and music blasting, drowning out the noise of the crowd. There were several large, fully fenced-over full-size octagons on platforms a few feet above the ground, with fights going on in them as we stood there, and hundreds of people surrounding each cage fight, and a few restricted rooms at the back. There was a few stands and vendors along the walls selling food and 'snacks'.

"This is it," Giovanni said. "We're doing a tournament-style fight in a few hours, we're just doing a few exhibitions and openers to get the crowd to riled up. All these fights are being live-streamed to dark web websites and people all over the world. Your fight begins in thirty minutes, just think of it as a five-round bare-knuckle sparring match. No rules, no referee, no contracts, no signing, no bullshit, my friend. The locker room is right over there, just get your shit ready in thirty minutes and I'll come to get you. I already got your stats, you're six-foot-two and weight two hundred and ten pounds."

"Got it," I said. "I'm getting fifty thousand just for this exhibition match, right? And who's my opponent?"

"Yeah," Giovanni said.  "About your opponent… don't worry about that. Just know that he's really, really good. I expect good from you, though. Kick his fucking ass."

Giovanni patted my back and I grinned, before he gave me a thumbs-up and disappeared into the crowd. I walked through the people, walking beside the vendors and into the locker room. I walked in and sat on one of the benches, putting my duffel bag on the ground and looking at the several other fighters in here with me. The first guy was a massive motherfucker, I mean I was six-foot-two and had to crane my neck upwards to look at this guy, he was probably seven-foot-one and four hundred pounds. He was a mountain of muscle, Samoan tattoos, and scars. The second dude was a kid, I swear he couldn't be older than fifteen, he was Asian, ripped and lean with tan skin, and had white boxing tape wrapped around his hands, forearms, elbows, and calves. He was shadow boxing by himself in the corner. The last person was a girl, around my age, slim and toned with white hair tied into a ponytail, wearing thin grappling gloves, a wrestling rash guard, and biting down on a mouthguard. The most noticeable thing about her was her almost ghost-like porcelain skin, a large, hinged jaw filled with sharp teeth, and a lack of other facial features, such as eyes or a nose.

I stayed silent, just like the rest of the room as I took my hoodie off and put on a compression shirt and fighting shorts. I got my competition boxing wraps and started wrapping my left hand, when the short, lean kid stood up and turned to me.

"You're the new guy, right? Rocco Creed?" The kid asked. 

"That's me," I sighed. "How'd you know?"

"Giovanni gives us a rundown on all the new fighters. If you do choose to join the official tournament, which you probably won't have much choice in, we might face each other. I’m Khanma."

"That's a relief," I said. "I've always loved illegal underground fights against kids. How'd you end up here anyway?"

"It's… complicated, but I've been here long enough. This isn't your run-of-the-mill underground fighting tournament." Khanma replied.

"I can see that," I replied, wrapping up my other hand and rubbing vaseline over my face. "This whole place is on par with a UFC arena. Best place I've been in my life."

"No, I mean the opponents you're going to fight won't be… normal. That's all I can say for now."

What the fuck? 

"Got it," I said. "What's this 'tournament' Giovanni's going on about?"

"Look dude, I don't know much about it myself. Some once-a-year, openweight deathmatch tournament. If you want, you can ask Aria."

"It’s my first time here," the girl, Aria, said.

&#x200B;

I’m a mixed martial artist fighting on the dark web. My latest opponent wasn’t human. (Part One)  “From what I heard, fighters from all over the world come here for this tournament. Don’t know much else, though.”

“We’re not even a quarter of all the fighters in the tournament,” Aria said, stretching her calves. “This is just one locker room, you know.”

“Fuck,” I said. “Better get ready soon. Got a match in a few minutes.”

“Good luck,” Khanma said.

“Thanks,” I said. 

I started wrapping my ankles and shins in black boxing tape, then I stood up and started stretching. I had five minutes left as I started shadowboxing and practicing my footwork. Giovanni walked into the locker room, and grabbed my arm.

“Rocco, you’re up next.” He said. “Put on a good fucking match.”

“Yes sir,” I said, punching the air.

I ran out of the locker room and put my mouthguard in, walking through the crowd and up to the empty octagon, with a full roofed cage covering it. One of the employees, wearing a ski mask, opened the door as I stepped in. He locked the cage as I started beating my chest and shouted to the crowd, grinning and feeling the rush of adrenaline I chased for so long. The crowd roared as Giovanni walked into the center of the octagon, holding a microphone and laughing heartily.

“Ladies, gentlemen, and creatures of the abyss, we return once again for our annual, world-wide fighting tournament with no weight class restrictions, no rules, no referee, and the chance to win ten million dollars, a chance at freedom, or the title of the undisputed openweight world champion of the Mixed Species Martial Arts Tournament!!” 

The crowd roared, stamping their feet on the ground and chanting.

Giovanni continued. “Now as tradition follows, every year we open our tournament with a short exhibition match with two very special opponents. One is a newcomer, bare-knuckle boxer and wrestler who hails from Portland, Oregon, with an official fifty-two wins and zero losses, is Rocco fucking Creed!!”

The crowd roared as I shadowboxed in place and watched the other corner, still empty. 

“Now on the other corner is something that also hails from Oregon, a demon of the abyss that killed several of our handlers bringing it in… a surviving worshiper of K’lah Tegothlku, the Nag Phnawalgi!!”

On the other side of the octagon, a platform from deep beneath the floor rose, and with it a massive cage containing a creepy fucking creature that roared and slammed itself against the cage wall.

“What the fuck?” I looked back at Giovanni.

He held eye contact for one second before nodding. He had set this up. I glanced back at the creature. It had semi-translucent dark skin, a humanoid torso, a large, eyeless head with a massive, tooth-filled maw, and a mass of long tentacles and appendages for legs. It had its massive clawed hands bared and outstretched as it looked right at me. The crowd roared chants as roaring rock music played in the background, while I was freaking out. While I had fought the occasional bear or tiger in illegal fights, this thing wasn’t a fucking animal.

“A win is considered when the opponent is dead, knocked out, or incapacitated… BEGIN!!”

The electronic cage lock unlocked and the creature crawled out of the cage, roaring and crawling right for me, moving on its two muscular, long arms. From here I could tell it was more or less my size, maybe two hundred pounds, and extremely fucking fast.

I got in a Muay Thai stance and the creature finally approached and tried clawing and tearing at me, sticking its head out to bite my outstretched arms. I jumped back and side-stepped it, waiting for it to go for my arm when I went for an overhand right and hit it in the mouth, smashing its jaw and breaking its teeth. The crowd roared as the commentators went back and forth.

Frank Garcia laughed as he commented from his booth right beside the octagon. “Creed has just hit a perfect overhand right, and it shatters his opponent’s jaw!! The newcomer is starting to take off, using his footwork to stick and move, wearing down the monster, where most fighters would have died already. Rita I hear you’ve dealt with these creatures before… they’re tough bastards, yeah?”

The creature roared and jumped onto the octagon’s walls, using its claws to hook into the fence as it circled me. I stood in the center, watching its movements as it suddenly pounced at me, pushing me to the ground. I mounted it while it was scrambling to get up, and started throwing hammer fists to its skull, the crowd roaring with delight.

“I have,” said Rita, the co-commentator. “I’ve never seen a normie win against these, bare-handed, one-on-one. Creed is doing well, he hasn’t suffered any injuries and is still doing the signature ground-and-pound, with what might be an early finisher.”

The creature suddenly elbowed me in the ribs and rolled me over, and my back was exposed for a split second, when it slashed into my torso, splattering blood all over the canvas as the crowd screamed for more. I jumped back up, the pain numbing my back as the creature circled me again. I stopped using counters and went on the offense, throwing a feint right hook at it before using a teep to push the creature back as I chased it, pushing it into the fence and holding it to the wall while I elbowed it in the hinge of the jaw so much the creature’s lower jaw fell off. I was exhausted, putting my guard up and catching one of the creature’s arms as it swiped at me, using a standing joint lock to break its arm. It roared and grabbed and slashed at me with its tentacles and appendages while I put it in the clinch, feeding it elbows and knees, breaking bones in its body and crushing its face as black blood poured onto me and the octagon. The creature suddenly caught me with its arm and threw me across the entire octagon, as I crashed into one of the walls and fell, severely injuring my ribs. The creature made a beeline for me, slowly moving as I struggled to get up. I could see Khanma and Aria standing beside the cage, cheering and yelling for me to get up and kill the thing. 

I stood up, and I approached the creature, throwing a jab at its face while I shot in and grabbed its torso, picking the creature up and using a suplex, throwing it behind me and slamming it into the ground at full force. I heard a loud crunch as the creature’s neck and spine were shattered, while it lay on the ground, twitching. I raised my arms out to the crowd, grinning and beating my bleeding chest as I stomped on the creature’s neck in victory. I had felt this so many times before, but not as great as now. I had fought a creature that had slaughtered so many and won, with an amazing finisher and victory. 

After the crowd and the adrenaline settled down a little, I chuckled to myself as I kicked the dead body of the creature and walked out of the ring, the MSMAT employees unlocking the cage and letting me walk out. The crowd slapped me on the back, cheering and shouting as the metal music crescendoed. I couldn’t hear a single thing but the commentators right beside me as I walked across the arena floor, out of breath.

Frank roared, “And with a brutal fucking suplex as his finisher, Rocco fucking Creed is the undisputed victor of our first exhibition match!! He’s becoming a fan favorite after that performance, where dozens of fighters before him died, he crushed and will now be moving onto the official tournament…”

As I sat down on a bench beside the octagon I had just fought in, I caught a glimpse of the commentary team, sitting in their booth, their microphones and notes strewn across the table. One of them, Frank, was a huge bald and bearded Middle-Eastern man, wearing a MSMAT hoodie and covered in tattoos and built like a powerlifter. The co-commentator, Rita, was tall, wearing a suit vest and dress pants, with her blonde hair tied into a bun. She also wasn’t human, noticeable by her abnormally large jaw, massive, sharp teeth, and long, razor-sharp claws. I wondered what their [story](https://www.reddit.com/r/SeasideUniverse/comments/m9ivqd/seaside_part_one_the_leviathan/) was. 

“Good shit,” Khanma said, walking up to me. “You might want to get checked out by the medic, dude.”

“Yeah…” I said, feeling the bruises and the pain of the wounds on my back kicking in. “Your fight is coming up, yeah?”

“Fuck yeah,” Khanma said. “Real tournament’s start in an hour. Dozens of fighters, monsters, and gods. Should be a blast.”

The kid slapped me on the back and [walked away.](https://www.reddit.com/r/SeasideUniverse/comments/y98egd/fighting_demons_part_two/)

So let’s see if I can summarize this before I die. 

My daughter Katie is [dead thanks to falling in love with the devil](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/vrzgxi/my_daughter_has_a_secret_admirer_and_the_notes_he/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf), but it turns out it was a mutual relationship and she [wants revenge against her mom](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/vuf04d/update_my_daughters_secret_admirer_is_the_devil/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) because get this, [her mom murdered her dad and kept his corpse in the attic for all these years](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/vwkz2l/another_update_my_daughter_fell_in_love_with_the/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) because I think she might have already made a deal with the devil himself too. involving my soul. 
Yep. I was royally screwed. 

As soon as I saw that the possessed spirit of Katie’s dad was inside me, I felt revolted and disgusted trying to figure out how this could have even happened. 

“I shouldn’t have to pay for his sins,” I croaked out when I finally found my voice again. 

Katie gave me a look that told me she felt that I deserved to die. I felt stupid for the whole situation. Stupid and angry. 

“I think we both know who is to blame for letting this spirit linger,” Katie told me. 

She was talking about Beth, her own flesh and blood. 

“Katie I know we really have never had a connection… but I can’t hurt her. I don’t understand why she did all of this. Why didn’t she just let the bastard die?” I argued. 

The demon at her side seemed almost sympathetic to my plight. 

“Some people cannot easily shed blood. For others it’s almost instinct. Your wife felt that her husband dying was too simple and too quick. She wanted his very soul to be tormented. Hence why she came to my master and made the bargain. Five years of hell on earth, make him pay for all the abuse he had done to her and Beth would offer blood in exchange for that…” 

The demon paused and twirled his black burnt fingers with Katie’s. “So you see, Katie was destined to be sacrificed. An unfair bargain, if I might add considering that your wife did not have the guts to do this deed herself.” 

“Your master… is that Lucifer himself?” I guessed. 

The demon suddenly became very angry and throttled himself against me, slamming me against the wall as he snapped, “We cannot say his name. Or else all of us will die.” 

When I nodded weakly he let me go and I breathed again, confused by the circumstances. 

“So… you’re bound to your master the same way that Katie was bound to you. And you both want to just be free… and love each other,” I realized. It was an absurd idea that they had actually fallen in love, but I could tell that this demon was serious in his words and deeds. 

“If Beth dies, the curse can be broken. Your spirit can be free as well, Garret. Hell will have the offering it deserves,” the demon told me. 

“I’m just not sure I am capable of murder,” I admitted. 

Katie reached for me, and stammered, “I need you to let his spirit out and let it unleash on my mom… one last time. I know it’s not fair that he be allowed to take control of your body… but it’s the only way to make this all settled…” 

I looked away and toward the mirror where my reflection matched that of her biological father’s corpse. 

I couldn’t condone this violence, but I agreed to their demands. Secretly I hoped for another answer. 
“The time limit for the five years is almost at an end so you most act now or Katie and I will both be brought to nothing. Your daughter will be gone, this time forever.”

I told them I would get it done and left the attic to plan. 

Honestly before Beth got home I considered trying to kill myself but I wasn’t sure that would work. I had a spirit inside me that might be revived if I did something so foolish. 

Then, as if a lightbulb went off in my head; I recalled the forum where I had talked to the demonslayer . 

It was a long shot, but I emailed him and requested his help. 

Surely if we could perform an exorcism then the lingering spirit could be disposed of from my body and then Beth wouldn’t have to pay? It was a risk I wanted to take. I couldn’t hurt the woman I loved no matter the mistakes she had made. She had suffered enough. 

Beth got home a little earlier than expected as I didn’t exactly tidy up like I promised so she was a bit surprised. 

“Were you just trying to get my mind off of things?” she teased. I embraced her and kissed. It felt wrong to do, given the nightmare that was about to descend upon us but… I wanted one last happy memory. 

“Beth… we have a problem,” I told her as we sat down at the dining room table. 

“It’s Katie isn’t it? I’ve had a bad feeling all day. Has she made contact again?” she asked. 

“She has… and she has made her demands. She wants your blood…” I admitted. 
Before Beth could even ask, I stopped her and said, “Tell me the truth, what did you do when your first husband died?” 

I saw her lips quiver and my wife burst into tears. 

“I knew this would happen the moment I couldn’t pull the trigger….”

“So then it’s true,” I didn’t say what I knew but her face told me the demon was right. She had made a Devil’s bargain. 

“Garret you have to understand… I wanted him gone. But after everything I went through, I had grown resentful. I thought this would be the way that he would suffer. I should have known better,” she sobbed. 

“And you didn’t once think about what this did to me? How could you do this?” I stammered. 

“I didn’t know that his spirit would latch onto you. I thought the curse would work differently and he would simply starve to death in the attic and just not die… alone and dejected like he deserved!” Beth stammered. 

“So… how did things go wrong?” I asked as I took a breath and waited for her to tell the truth. 

Honestly I was so infuriated I actually considered doing what the demon had asked to begin with. Then she told me the awful facts. 

“Katie found the body. She was horrified. She didn’t need to see her dad like that no matter what type of man he was. That… was when things spiraled out of control. She tried to take her life around the same time really…. I couldn’t lose you… not both of you at once. It would have been too much! And this way I could save time and try to fix this. I really didn’t think that this would happen to you, Garret. I had no idea that the demons would fall in love with her!” 

“You have got to be the stupidest Christian woman I have ever met. If I make it out of this alive, I swear that we are through,” I told her. 

She kept sobbing when I heard the door bell ring. My exorcist had arrived. 

Settling my nerves as best as I could, I let the man inside and said, “I’m glad you could make it on such short notice.” 

He had icy blue eyes. “The work of the lord never rests,” he said. He resisted shaking hands with me as he looked at the ceiling. 

“There is great evil here,” he whispered.

He saw Beth and commented, “Tell me sister, why did you ever believe that Satan himself could be reasoned with?” 

Beth wiped her tears away. 

“All I wanted was to keep my daughter alive. I had met the man of my dreams and we had a good family. I had forgotten about that old deal! I was happy again! She wasn’t supposed to take this course. It’s the Devil’s fault not mine,” Beth stuttered. 

“I think you are failing to realize that the animosity and anger you feel is lingering within both of you. You will both be undergoing a ritual today, to cleanse this house,” he warned. 

Beth looked at me terrified and I nodded, knowing this might be the only way we both live. 
“Wait. What will happen to our daughter? Is she still bound in Hell?” Beth asked. 

“Once the curse is lifted her spirit can go wherever it wishes,” the exorcist said as he prepared the proper holy relics. 

He blessed us with them as he set up certain herbs and returned with an older Bible. 

He sighed and told us that we would need to stand near the center of a salt ring where the ladder would come down for the attic. 

“Can we… Can we say goodbye to her?” Beth whispered as I felt the air getting colder. The evil was going to resist this young man and I wasn’t sure we had time. 

“You may try as the spell is cast. But do not interfere or else things could go very wrong,” the man warned. 

It reminded me a bit of watching those Marvel movies with the sorcerer as he began to chant incantations and the room itself seemed to become unstable. 

Then everything became topsy turvy. I grabbed my wife’s hand, trying to stay brave as I felt air rushing out of my lungs. There was a loud ringing in my ear as the lights and the dark all blurred. We couldn’t see anything. 

Because there was nothing in the void as our bodies convulsed and the evil within us resisted the exorcism.  

As I dove between life and death I saw our daughter. I had raised her to be a strong vibrant woman. And now it was time to finally say goodbye. The demon was there too, angry and still bitter for all the harm that we had caused. 

I realized how much Beth really did deserve more retribution, and I wondered if it would be possible to atone altogether or not. 

As I felt my eyes roll back in my head and my body fall forward, I saw Katie wave goodbye. 

Then, I woke up in a hospital bed. 

A few days have passed and I feel… well I suppose I feel the same. Beth is in a coma. 

The exorcist came by and confirmed the ritual was successful but made a warning. Negative energy will linger. “The anxiety and the guilt you felt must Be extinguished. You have done everything you can to fix your sins,” he told me. 

I could barely even make myself smile and thank him from the excruciating pain I was in. But after he was gone I kept thinking about all of this. 

It could have been avoided. Beth… she lied to me and to her daughter. I know that she suffered from her husband and it will be a struggle to forgive her. 

But I am unsure if the negative energies will ever be fully resolved. If we can ever move on from this tragedy. 

At least I know my Katie is out there somewhere amid the stars. 

It was not the path I wanted. But she forged her own. 

At least someone gets a happy ending here. 

For me I think it’s just a case of living my life and waiting to see what happens as Beth recovers. 

Maybe we can make it right. Maybe we can learn from the darkness like Katie did. 

Our world view of good and evil might have been wrong all along. 

From where I’m sitting now, it feels like we are the monsters and the demons were the ones that set us straight.

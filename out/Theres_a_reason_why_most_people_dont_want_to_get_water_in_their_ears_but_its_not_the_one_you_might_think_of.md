As the skyline turned bright orange and gradually began fading into darker hues, timidly yet surely bringing down the black veil of a fresh, new night, my shift reached its end and I was able to leave the foundry and slowly make my way home.


That job was killing me, both physically and mentally. Not only did I have to be a couple of feet within flowing molten steel in my thick and cumbersome protective gear, but I also had to drag heavy loads back and forth between giant furnaces that seemed as if they were at temperatures of two million degrees. At least that's what it felt like to me, always drenched in hot sweat underneath all those layers of protection. 


I wanted to quit, I wanted to do it so bad, every day of the week. But I couldn't. The pay was decent and I wasn't really capable of any other kind of work. I needed that money like fire needs air.   I didn't just have my bills to pay, I also had a sick brother in a nursing home who had a ridiculously small pension that he inherited from our late parents. It wasn't nearly enough for his care, which meant that I needed to fill in the gap. He was the only family I had left, and I was the only family he had left. I could never forgive myself if I couldn't make sure he was taken care of.


These thoughts flooded my mind every evening as I walked home from the giant furnace I called my workplace. Riding the bus was a no-no for me, I needed that fresh air of the incoming night to cool me a bit. It did the job well enough to help me endure until I finally get in the shower in my tiny apartment. I mean, in my cozy minimalistic humble abode.


After a clunk and a drop made by a door handle moving down, followed by the sound of metal scraping against metal and the twist of a cylinder, the doors to my living quarters opened with a shy, quiet shriek. I stepped inside, closed the door behind me, locked them, and started to undress, right there at the entrance.


My apartment was indeed miniature. With your back toward the entrance, there was a narrow kitchen on the left side, a twelve-foot room in front, and a small bathroom on the right side.    The kitchen had just two bottom cabinets and a sink, with one relatively big and one quite small hanging cabinets. I didn't do much cooking anyways, the microwave I had there did most of the work since I usually ate frozen and instant meals anyways.


The bedroom/living room/dining room combo had a few things in it. The TV on the wall, the bed, and a sorry excuse for a wardrobe in which I held my giant collection of clothes that consisted of three shirts, two pairs of pants, two T-shirts, one pair of shorts, and some socks and underwear. 


I dropped the clothes I took off onto the ground before I stepped into the bathroom, I was way too tired and still way too hot to care about tidiness.


I must've showered for half an hour with chilly water. I arched my neck left and right as I set the shower head above the areas between my shoulders and my jaw so that I could cool the muscles there that were fairly cramped up. Not a smart thing to do, wash yourself with cold water when your body is hot. Again, I didn't care, I just wanted a bit of relief at that point.


While my head almost completely rested on my right shoulder, I thought I heard a faint voice coming from my left. I straightened my neck and pressed the shower head onto the side of my right thigh to muffle the noise it was making.    I listened hard but there was no sign of the voice I believed I heard earlier. Some twenty seconds later I concluded that it must've been my imagination that toyed with me.    The fatigue I felt got to me. I acknowledged that thought and decided it was time to wash my hair and finish this water therapy of mine.


Just like many times before, I considered cutting my shoulder-length hair for practical reasons as I applied the cheap apple-scented shampoo to it. My brother thought it looked cool so I never brought up the courage to trim it down and disappoint him.


I stood below the shower head I previously fixed to the holder on the wall and let the weak and slightly irregular water jet rinse my hair. Then, a second or two after I turned my face to the left to allow the water to wash the right side of my head, it came again.


***"Help."***


I jumped back like a pretty girl who just saw a mouse run a few inches in front of her feet and almost slammed into the wall tiles behind me.


*What the fuck?!*


I was sure I heard that voice perfectly clear. There was no need to muffle the water sounds now though. The voice didn't come from the outside of the bathroom. It was definitely there with me.


***"Help me."***


*It came again.*


Somehow, at that point, I wasn't scared anymore. Well, not as scared at least. My heart was still pounding like warrior drums, but the tone behind the voice told me that it wasn't a threat. There was a great deal of fear and sorrow in it. I didn't get why, but I definitely understood that much.


I felt discomfort in my right ear because it was filled with water. I jammed my finger in it and the discomfort disappeared as drops of water slid out of the canal.


And the voice was gone again.
A minute later and there was still no trace of it.


Then I realized why the voice sounded so clear and near, but also distant and muffled as if it came from a well or a cave. And why it came from my left at first, then from my right.


It was *the water* in my ears. That was its source.


Without much hesitation, I stood under the shower again and let the water fill my left ear. I kept my head slightly tilted to make sure the water doesn't get out. Sure enough, mere seconds later, the voice returned. 


***"Help me, please."***


*Sure, fuck it, might as well.*    Throughout my whole life, I never could say no to someone who asked for help.
But how was I supposed to do that? Help the water or what?


***"Help. Cedar Falls hospital, room 221."***


*Yeah, that should do the trick.*


I grabbed my towel, dried myself and my hair as best as I could in a minute or so, and got out of the bathroom. I used my phone to search for that hospital and, funnily enough, it was just a block away.


I did a lot of crazy things in my life, but this was definitely the most ludicrous endeavor of all. Before I knew it, my clothes were on me and I was out for a late-night jog as far as my neighbors were concerned.


One thing bothered me along the way.


*Why did the voice sound so familiar?*

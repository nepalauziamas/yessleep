She watches me every night no matter what. I could shut the door and lock it tight, somehow she would still get in my room anyways. With this phobia of mine it makes sleeping a nightmare when she is around. I have to forget and distract myself in order to sleep unless I want a higher heart rate, paranoia, and worst of all, the annoyance of shock.

I toss and turn as she stares at me. My bed is in the left side furthest corner with a drawer at the very end. She likes to sit there and watch me while I’m in my bed, I don’t know why. Sometimes when it gets too much for me I sleep in my parents bed to try to get away from her.

My cat, Black Bell, is an oddity in my life. My sister once got attacked brutally by a rabid dog, and Black Bell ran out to help her. The dog ran away whimpering after looking into Black Bell's eyes. Black Bell sat on my sister, licking her bleeding wounds. As if trying to comfort and protect her until help arrives.

My parents found Black Bell as a stray the day of my 16th birthday. She had a pink color with a shiny black bell on it, and they both named her after it. Ever since she came into my life… things have been quite different.

I got out of bed this morning and sure enough she was there again on my dresser, I tiptoed away from her but her eyes followed me closely. Next to my door is a closet and I selected my clothes, a simple black shirt with white sleeves, and black sweatpants. Before I put on my fresh clothes I made sure to take a shower before I had to walk to school.

When I got out of the shower I felt refreshed and new. I walked from the bathroom which was down the hall to my left, or to your right from the kitchen. I went back to my room which was completely down the hall and grabbed my backpack, laptop, and hat.

My mom kissed me goodbye at the door before I went walking to school. But they were waiting for me… Just like they always have been for a year now. I was on guard and horrified. If I made any quick movements or loud noises I could be attacked, the same thought I had always had. I walked slowly to the right and continued down the sidewalk.

I never knew why they were there. Every day I thought about any reasons why they would trail me specifically. However my family also noticed that cats followed them as well.

I distract myself and unconsciously make quick glances at my pursuers. There were a hundred or more of them. Even if I ran they would easily catch up to me, and there would be more waiting ahead or at school. I had no choice but to stay calm and steady while keeping up the pace.

After a minute or two of traveling on the sidewalk I crossed the bridge and took a shortcut on the left through the forest. The birds and bugs sang in rhythm as the group stepped and moved through the grass behind me. I turned right into the clearing after going straight and made it to my school’s baseball area.

I looked up at one of the windows and saw my crush Sarah staring at me. She looked away quickly once she noticed I saw her. I felt creeped out as I could never get a read on her. All I really know about her is that she is a quiet kid, and only opens up to and talks to the people she likes or knows.

She stares at me pretty often while in class, in the hallways, and even outside of school when we are accidentally close by. Sometimes she copies my behaviors, I notice this in my peripheral vision.

I’m madly in love with her, but I can never find the strength to ask her to be my friend. In the school I go to I’m viewed as the quiet kid, people fear my glance. I’m rumored to be nicknamed the “lord of cats”, “king of cats”, and “the feline general”. This is because a horde of cats ran with me when I did the mile in the gym last year, videos circulated online. I kept walking straight and turned left to go on the sidewalk that led to the front entrance of the middle school.

Inside I went left to go to the high school. Once I was situated in my first period class I went over and looked out the window. I couldn’t describe how I felt at that moment. I feel like a helpless swimmer in shark infested waters. A hundred or more cats were sitting, laying, and watching me. They have done this every single day without fail, even during harsh weather conditions.

I always think about Black Bell because of these cats. This all started the day after my 16th birthday. It’s continued till now in my 12th grade year.

I got through the long school day and wanted to watch a movie later tonight, then go for a stroll downtown. The cats followed me on my way home, however they stopped and ran away once I got there.

I have a love and fear relationship with Black Bell. To me she is like a sign of safety and protection warding off the horde of cats outside. She is always waiting for me at the window when I arrive at home. Although these feelings encompass my heart, I still fear her as she too is a cat after all.

I went straight to my room and threw my stuff off, placing it on the bedside drawer at the end. I walked to the right side wall, north of my bed drawer and pulled out my office chair. I sit down and begin to practice drawing anatomy. After a while of practice over the years I have gotten better, but I’m clearly still a beginner.

Black Bell suddenly jumps on my desk and meows. I scream in terror alerting everyone in the house. I jump back so fast that me and my office chair fall to the ground. Black Bell stood there staring at me and tilted her head. She didn’t even run away from my loud screaming, or look scared at all. I hear the ground thumping as my parents rush to my door and enter quickly.

My dad yelled “Armin! What’s wrong!” My mom asked worriedly “are you ok Armin?” I rolled off my chair and told them I was fine and that Black Bell just startled me. They both laughed and my mom said, “well we are glad you are ok, we know how you are around cats now. Didn’t think you would be this scared of them.”

We talked for a while longer as I picked up my chair and pushed it back in. I thought about leaving the house late at night to see a new movie coming out. I told them where I was going to go so they wouldn’t be worried and I waited until then.

When it was night time I took my safety bag and BB gun with me. Inside my bag was also a camera with an extremely bright flash feature. I feared and dreaded the nights as they too were similar to my mornings and afternoons.

I look at my own shadow in fear, constantly peaking whenever I feel an anxious need to check. I see eyes everywhere in the dark, thousands of them watching my every move. Shadowy figures walk around staring at me. Some are humanoid, others are massive monstrosities.

I ran as fast as I could because it was starting to overwhelm me. I crossed the street and made a left, then a right. I nearly made it to the theater and heard someone walking. I quickly turned my head to the left. Down the street was Sarah and she was looking at her phone, she heard me and looked up at me while putting down her phone. I worked up the courage to wave but it was too late.

Behind her suddenly was a being of my worst fucking nightmares. It was tall and black, having two pointed ears that resembled horns, making a “U” shape with its head. It had no eyes, but a massive toothy grin. On its neck was a cat collar with a bell on it that rang songs of screams and agony to my ears.

Every time it moved I heard snapping, tearing, and sounds of the unknown. Its chest had a massive sharp patch of scraggly white fur, with many eyes dotted around the empty space. Its tail was long and spiked at the end, matted and messy. Its arms were extremely long and so were its hands and fingers, narrow and ugly with sharp elongated claws.

Its thighs and legs were structured like a werewolf, its feet were massive and had three toes on each foot. Massive sharp claws sprouting from them. Its face had a human skull nose hole with whiskers coming out of it. The sight of this abomination made me want to run and not look back.

Sarah heard the monster and turned around screaming. She tried rushing towards my direction. The creature used its long tail to wrap around my crush and carry her in the air. She screamed as loud as she could while flailing.

I pulled out my BB gun and ran towards it, shooting as many times as I could. The creature giggled and dropped her. Sarah ran off in a hurry to get away from the scene. It swayed its arms and laughed demonically.

It caught one of my bullets and flicked it away effortlessly with two fingers. It jolted towards me swinging its right arm. I moved out of the way. The ground where I stood was swiped clean with massive claw marks. I had to keep dodging as the creature only got faster and faster. It twirled around and whipped me with its long tail sending me flying into a tree.

My whole body hurt and felt bruised as if I got whiplash. The creature came towards me. I was helpless. My BB gun didn’t work. I saved it for a special occasion just in case the cats outside tried to harm or kill me. I was clearly not strong enough to fight it bare handed.

I thought to myself while paralyzed in terror. The threat was real. My crush saw it, I saw it. It was ready to kill me. However, I looked in my bag and tried a last ditch effort. It was darker where we were and the street lamps were pretty far away. I pulled out my specialized camera and aimed before it could strike me.

I took a picture which made the monster scream in pain. It’s body had started to melt. I dodged again as it swung. It slapped me into the ground and I grunted in pain. I rolled to the left and its hand liquified and smashed into the ground turning to mush. I took another picture from its side and it jerked up screaming.

Its legs melted little by little until it could no longer stand. I went up close and took picture after picture until it was nothing more than a thick inky black puddle on the ground with eight eyes staring up at me. The eyes eventually closed and I stood there triumphantly. I dropped to my ass and breathed heavily. I tried rationalizing this thing's existence, however one flaw in my process is that my crush also saw, heard, and felt it as well.

I went to the movie theater with an excited attitude. The shadowy detective looking creature who followed me gave me no trouble. I paid him no mind. In my head I felt invincible and amazing. After the movie I walked home and Black Bell was waiting for me at the window. I turned around and saw the creature once more. It stood there and laughed before walking away.

I got inside so fucking fast I slammed the door and went straight to my bed afraid and exhausted. My body was in pain from the monster's attacks. Although a part of me felt like the monster went easy on me and Sarah. As if it were acting. I closed my eyes and drifted off to sleep, waking up in the morning groggily after having a nightmare. I got dressed in clean clothes, and put on some deodorant.

I went outside and to my surprise my parents greeted me. My dad came forward and patted me on the back. “Good morning champ! You have a special guest waiting to see you. I stood there speechless as Sarah stood before me. She walked up and put out her hand.

After I shook it Black Bell jumped on the living room table and looked at me. I hesitantly reached forward and pet Black Bell for the first time. Black Bell purred so loudly that it startled me. Black inky tears streamed down her eyes as she rubbed her head all over my hand.

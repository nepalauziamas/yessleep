Ok guys.  I thnk I need help.  I’m locked in a room.  Yeh, that sounds bad.  I’m kind of a deivery guy, so it’s not unusual for me to be in a stange living room, but this living room is strang. H ha. Oh, I gotta have fun.  Ha, I’m in anger, you dig?.  Oh fuck.   

So, yeah.  ou know ow when you need to get stuff in the city, you’ll find someone who sys, “Oh, yeah, I know a guy.”  I’m  that guy.  Well, I’m a guy.  I started off helping out this one guy, then when another guy decided to turn oer a new laf, and he sells me im phone.  That’s what makes a guy, a guy,  You dg?

Anyways I get a ring on the phone, which is weird.  Alost all of the business I do is by text message, and I like it that way.  Less fuss, less confusion.  But this guy actually calls me on the damn phone.  For real.  I almost didn’t answer, but business is business.

Dude asks me to come here.  Down the end of fuck all nowhere of the city.  I didn’t even know this part of the city had anyone living in it.  It’s fucking barren.  But he wanted like 800 worth of stock and I’m willing to go out of my usual delivery range.

So, yeah.  The door i locked in this room.  ow did I nt check the fcking door.!  Fuck this room.  So, it’s ike leave it to beaver in here.  Like ol stuff, like great gradmama old!  Those werd ace things on the arms and back of the sofa, and thre’s a phone here wih fucking cord between the uge handset and the massve block with a nuber wheel on it.  And it’s heavy, ike murder someone with t heay.

Ther? are old pictures on the wall.  Family stuff mostly.  It’s a pretty big family in the big pictures and then there’s little pictures of most of the people in the group pictures.  And these pictures are old.

I think I hear someone.   

Oh, this is getting even weirder.

Ok, it’s been like 45 minutes.  And I  just had the strangest conversation of my strange life.

I am pretty sure this dude has never done drugs.  I’m not sure if he’s left this house in the last decade or more. Fucker is pale as a ghost.  And he is very nice. Like I’m uncomfortable.  But, he’s made a convincing explanation of every weird thing so far.

I mean, I’m still locked in the room.  But now there’s a pot of tea here with me and a fucken great grandmama looking tea cup, with a fucking saucer!  Who the fuck used a saucer! And why am I not freaking out about being locked in this room. Oh yeah, the grand he’s going to get.

Dude didn’t look like he ever did drugs, but he wants everything I’ve got on me.  And that’s an extra two bills.  CASH!  Now this guy’s speaking my language, you dig?

It don’t seem like he speaks much English.  He’s too stuffy and naively like it’s not his first language.  Maybe he’s Dutch.  The dutch are weird.

That tea actually smells really good.

My momma used to make me tea when I was sick.  Kinda smelled like this. Like spices and the neighbors weird cooking smells.  It always made me feel better.

I’m sitting on the couch.  It’s pretty comfy for a fucking antique.  I moved that freaky lace thin.  Oh, the dude told me it’s called a ‘Doiley”  I’ve got no idea how it’s spelled, but that’s how it sounded it me.   

I’ve got a little pile of drugs ready for this weirdo to buy off me.  This is going to float me for two weeks.  Maybe I can actually do something nice for my puta.   

I’m trying not to think about the weird things about this room.  Like, I’m always checking a place out when I go in.  I’m in weird places a lot so, you know.  Check the windows and corners.  Situational awareness keeps you the fuck alive.  And I walk into this room and it just feels off.

There’s another door out on the far side.  When I check it more closely, there’s a wooden block nailed to the floor holding it shut.  And there’s like curtains for a bay window, but yeah, that gets weird too.  It’s not a window, it’s brick.  Like old crumbly brick, with a few rusty pipes sticking out in places that make no sense.

I’m trying not to think about it.  There’s also a radio.  Like everything else, it’s old as fuck.  I’m going to see if I can tune in anything while I’m waiting.

Maybe I’ll have some tea.  I am a little thirsty.

What is keeping this dude so long, is he printing the money!  Fuck, weird ass place like this, maybe he’s got one of those big steam powered printing presses in the basement.  Wouldn’t that be a trip.  Hey, if it spends like this once a month, this weirdo might just be my new best friend!

Oh, that tea is really good.  I can’t make out exactly what it is, but I can taste honey and I think cinnamon.  This shit is deluxe.  There’s a book case against one of the walls.  Big leather books.  I wonder if they’re valuable.  Maybe I could boost one or two.

What the fuck is this place the first book I grabbed was an old photo book, but everyone in it is dead!  Like, just a book of dead people and people sitting next to them.  I really think that.  Oh, no.  I’m pretty.  Yeah, that’s the spins.  I’m in oh, oh this is danger.

I need help I’m at.  sAead dfa.k....

I think there is something off about my office building.

I currently am working an Early shift, So I get to work before most of the other managers.

Due to COVID my office building has been mostly empty for the past 2 years, but since the evacuation order has been lifted a small number of managers have been required to return to the building but on different floors, as a sort of skeleton crew. Since coming back to the building I’ve noticed a few odd things happening that I can’t really explain. The first thing is usually during the middle of my shift I start feeling my energy draining a bit more than normal, and I’ll start to doze off while working which is not normal at all. The other thing I’ve noticed is when I start to doze off, I can see black shapes and figures in peripheral vision that disappear as soon as I wake myself up. I also keep getting a weird feeling that someone is walking up behind me when no one is there. Sometimes I hear footsteps in the other zones which is impossible because I am the only person on my floor, and no one has access to my floor without a keycard.  I just get the constant feeling that someone is either watching me or trying to creep up behind me while I am working. We also have motion activated lights that will turn off and on even though no one is there. 

The other day I heard some noises coming from the conference room from across the hall that weren’t constant but were somewhat loud which is odd because I am the only person on my floor and the janitorial staff doesn’t start until the 1st. While I was walking the motion activated lights either wouldn’t turn on or they would turn off shortly after I walked through. I swear I kept seeing a black figure either behind me or at the edge of my peripheral vision and would disappear shortly after I turned to look. While in the conference room I noticed it was darker than the rest of the office and the chairs were arranged in an odd manner like someone knocked them all over instead of just wheeling them in. while fixing the chairs I noticed that the doors behind were all closed and locked from the inside and I was in the conference room in complete darkness even though I left them open. While I struggled to get the doors open, I kept hearing noises from the other side of the walls. I don’t know if someone got into the building and was just messing with me or if it was something else. I walked the aisles and looked but there wasn’t anyone there and the elevators and stairways were all locked and unavailable to anyone without a secured keycard. I am friendly with all the other managers in my building and when I asked them about any strange occurrences, they were vague with their responses or just shrugged it off as just rats.

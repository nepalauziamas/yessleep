 [Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/x11san/something_weird_happened_to_my_friend_in_the/)

Hey, I don’t know if I have much time. I have to get the word out about the thing in the Colorado mountains. It knows our language, and it can walk like us. It replaced my friend, Sam. I made a previous post about it assuming it was just some kind of rabies or something. 

To start off, I moved to my parent’s house since I heard scratching at my walls. It mostly stopped once I moved to my parent’s house. However, I decided to head back to the Colorado mountains for some reason. I felt like I had to look for Sam.

I drove straight to the place Sam started acting weird. Our log cabin. I decided to look around for a bit. I found something that wasn’t there before. A deer pelt, right in the middle of the floor. It looked rough somehow, like someone used it as a coat then turned it back into a deer. 

I kept looking, and saw a strange door I hadn’t seen before. I tried to open it, but it wouldn’t open. I decided to just ram into it. It worked, but I wasn’t expecting stairs to be on the other side. I fell a couple steps, then caught myself on the handrailing. I walked down the steps, and found a basement. Not really surprising, most houses have them.

I saw a book resting on the table. It was labeled “diary.” I decided to read it.

“12/14/86: Mom says a blizzard is coming. We don’t have nearly enough food. I don’t know if we’ll survive the winter.”

“12/15/86: Dad told me to write one happy thing that happened today and one sad thing, and to do it every day. It’s supposed to keep me happy, but I’m still nervous.

Happy: We got enough wood to keep a fire going for a while.

Sad: We still haven’t found any food.”

I wondered who wrote this. I decided to keep reading, in case I could find anything that could help.

“12/16/86: Dad went out hunting today. He’s a good hunter, he might find some food. I found an big and old blanket in our attic, and me and my parents have been using it.

Happy: I found a blanket to keep comfy at night.

Sad: Dad hasn’t come back since hunting.”

“12/18/86: He still hasn’t come back.

Happy: No.

Sad: Where.”

“12/19/86: Dad came back. He found a dead deer. He mentioned, however, the deer only had skin and flesh. No bone, no organs. He still took it, and we cooked it. It tasted good, though it gave me a weird feeling.   
 Happy: Dad came back with food.

Sad: No.

I was definitely weirded out at this point. The persons remains who were discovered here were just bones and organs. The deer was missing bones and organs. I decided to keep reading.

12/20/86: Dad went out again, and came back with another deer skin. However, he’s been acting really weird. It seems like he’s forgotten a lot.

Happy: Food!

Sad: Is dad okay?

12/21/86. Dad says he feels sick, and doesn’t want to go out. Mom does too, so I decided to. They told me not to, but I did. I was out there the whole day. I found deer, but they were all too quick. I went back emptyhanded. Mom was gone, and Dad said she went out to help me. But dad found a deer right outside our cabin! He gave me some meat, and it didn’t taste the same as deer. Strange. Mom hasn’t come back.

Happy: Food!

Sad: Mom is gone.

12/22/86: Mom hasn’t come back. A horrible smell is coming from the basement. Dad doesn’t let me go in, though. He laughs uncontrollably whenever he smells the scent. It seems to mess him up.

Happy: No.

Sad: Mom is still gone.

12/23/86: DAD WAS CARVING SOME MEAT, AND HE LOST HIS FINGER. I SAW HIM. HE PUT IT BACK ON. NO BLOOD, NOTHING. HOW DID HE DO THAT AFTER BEING STABBED WITH A CARVING KNIFE?!

Happy: Dad is okay.

Scared: Yes.

12/23/86 I don’t think that was deer

12/24/86. I have to leave this cabin. I snuck into the basement, and found a severed pair of legs. 

Happy:

Sad:

Help:

12/25/86: Dad is dead

I found his skeleton outside the window

That thing isn’t dad

It knows I know

It’s coming for me. I have the carving knife. I don’t know if silver will be strong enough to kill it, but I hope it’s like a werewolf.

If I don’t make it, remember me. Avery Samson. If I do make it, and you find this diary, burn it. Nobody else should know.

I closed the book, because all the other pages were blank. I pocketed the book, then I decided to leave the cabin. I saw the carving knife, rusted with age, but a good weapon. I took it, in case I was attacked. I hopped into my car, and drove away. I kept moving and saw a hitchhiker.

He started waving at me, but something about him seemed off to me. I stopped the car to look at him. It was Sam. He ran towards my car with superhuman speed. I floored it.

He kept chasing me, and I just kept accelerating. He was right behind me at this point. I had an idea. I’m no quantum physicist, but I had to try something to get him off me. Right before he got to me, I hit the brakes. I heard a thump sound as he likely dented my car. He was flung above the car, and landed pretty far in front of me.

I looked into the thing’s eyes, and it SMILED. That thing SMILED. I accelerated. The thing probably realized what I was going to do, because it backed away, all while smiling. I hit that thing with the car, and it just got up from behind me and walked away. It looked at me one last time, and I saw Sam’s skin dissolving off. There was a strange inky black interior, and it walked away. I got home, and decided to read the diary.  
   
 

I had an idea and looked up the author’s name. “Avery Samson.” 

The first thing that came up was “Confirmed dead.” 

I was shocked, but not really. But what I saw after made me reconsider. “Avery Samson, dead at 48. Cause of death: unknown causes. Amy Samson was found in a Colorado forest, with no skin or flesh. However, her dental records were able to help us identify her.”

No skin, just like the deer she described. And just like the unidentified body. I saw her face, and she looked like someone I knew. Someone I’d seen somewhere, but I still don’t know from where. That’s when I heard a knock at the door.

I opened it, and saw Averys face grinning at me, just like she appeared on the article. I slammed the door in her face. 

The next couple hours were the most stressful of my life. I had my carving knife, but I only intended to use it as a last resort. Avery clearly escaped using it, due to her being 48 when she died.

I heard it knocking more. 

“Let me in, I know you read my diary! I can explain everything! Doesn’t that sound great to you fellow human? EVERYTHING!”

Even if it wasn’t the thing who took Sam, she was obviously insane. 

“I’ll get in either way, I can help! You won’t suffer the same fate as Sam! Wouldn’t you want that, fellow human? WOULDN’T YOU?”

My parents were on a date night, so they were out. I went upstairs, to the window above the front door, opened it, and dropped a knife through it. It struck the thing on its head. It folded its head forwards and circled it around its neck with a crackling noise. It looked at me, and smiled. 

Next, I decided to try the back door. Nothing worked. I eventually got it open, but it was in front of me. “You don’t want to do that.” It said while smiling. I slammed the door while it was lunging, and it smacked the glass with a wet SQUISH sound. “Go on, open the door. Use another knife. Chop my head off. Use the sharpest one you have. Nothing you do will work.”

I barricaded the back door with a couch. It was pretty hard, but I managed. The front door started caving in, so I barricaded it too. It kept mocking me. “Come on, just do it. Open the door. I can help. You want your friend back, right? RIGHT? JUST LET ME IN, IDIOT! Please, please, please, I need help. I need water. Come on, open the door. I have a present. Please. I’ll get in either way. There’s no way you can prevent it. Just LET. ME. IN. I will spare you. Just let me-.” 

I was sick of it talking, so I dropped a chair on it. It bit through the chair, and looked at me, angry. It started pounding on the window. The glass was cracking. I boarded it, but I didn’t know how long it would last.

I had an idea. All the windows were blocked, the doors were blocked, but it would get in. And it knew. It started pounding on the front door, which started caving in. The door gave, and I ran into the basement. It started looking around. It heard my breathing, and I heard it walking towards the basement. I had a plan. 

I had the carving knife in hand. If the knife wouldn’t kill this thing, tetanus probably would. I had done everything I could. It came through the door, and I threw every single sharp object I had. One even hit it in the eye, getting rid of it, but its eye quickly regenerated. The carving knife was the thing that brought it down. It looked at me, angrier than before. It looked woozy, so I decided to get the knife out of its head.

I can’t describe what happened next. Its face changed to Sam’s, and it tried to plead with me. “Come on, I forgive you for hitting me with your car. Just let your guard down, fellow person.” I plunged the knife into its chest, stabbing again and again. No blood came out, just an inky black substance. It looked at me, smiling, but I kept stabbing. I didn’t care what happened, I just kept attacking. 

Eventually, it decided to run. I let it, because there was no way I was risking another fight with that thing. It left something for me. A tooth. I recognized Sam’s tooth, because there was a strange brown spot on it. It had never come off since 1st grade, no matter what he did.   
 

After a couple days, I heard something. I heard scratching at my rooms walls, but my parents never seemed to hear them. I also saw something on the news. “Strange deaths increase around the world, hundreds are found with no skin or flesh. Lock your doors, if you hear something, hide.” 

Since I had been hearing scratching on my walls every night, unless that thing was super fast, there were more of them. I’ve hired a security guard and given him a list of rules. He’s always ask me if they can use my account to post about the weird experiences, and he’s currently writing down his experiences. I’ve come up with a couple things you can do to survive.

The first is to, no matter what, if you see an animal or person acting weird, RUN AWAY. If you can’t, carry a silver carving knife and stab it. Silver seems to be a material that’s durable enough to kill it, I don’t know if a stronger one will work. 

ONLY attack the strange individual as a last resort. Once it flees, if you hear scratching on your walls, hire a security guard and give them a silver carving knife.

I won’t be posting any updates, but my guard might.

Remember these. Someday your life might depend on it.

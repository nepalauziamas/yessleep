 Okay so, this thing started a few months ago. For a bit of context, while I do live in a fairly big city, the neighborhood I live in is quite small and close-knit, so everyone knows each other. My local corner store is owned by a middle aged couple. It's a pretty sad looking small place, but it does good business as it's conveniently close to a lot of people. The couple run the counter themselves in shifts of 7 hours from 8AM to 10PM. That was until about six months ago or so when the store began operating 24 hours per day, with someone else taking the night shifts.  

Now, I didn't actually know this was even a thing until a few weeks ago. Being a digital artist I work from home and on my own schedule, so I will go days without interacting with people at a time when I'm busy working on a project. I usually work at night too, as the silence helps me concentrate. It was during one of those sleepless nights of staring at a bright monitor as it burns my eyes that I found out I ran out of soda, which was a big no. So I got dressed up, went down the stairwell to my apartment building and went to get more. 

Being 2 in the morning I thought that my local store was closed up so I was going to take a 15 minute walk through the chilly night breeze to get to another one that's open 24/7. That was until I walked past it and saw that the lights were still turned on, the sign on the front door reading "OPEN". 

"Guess this is a thing, huh?" I thought to myself as I changed directions and walked into the store. 

Like I said, since this is a small neighborhood I expected the guy at the counter to be someone from around here, or perhaps one of the owners' older sons. That is why I was surprised to find the man slouching over the counter was a complete stranger I'd never seen before, the employee badge on his clearly not fitting checkered shirt reading "Jeremy". The first thing I noticed about this Jeremy guy is that he was huge, having to bend over at what seemed to be an awkward angle to rest his elbows on a counter that comes up to my chest, medium length greasy black hair falling over his face and covering his eyes completely. 

It made sense to me at the time that they'd hire such a big guy to work the counter during the night shifts so I didn't think about it at all. With him not reacting to me entering I simply grabbed myself a medium bottle of Coke and then placed it on the counter next to his arms which were long and lanky and, being closer now, noticeably pale. I pulled out a 10 dollar bill and placed it on the counter to which he just gave me this weird nod, as if to say he acknowledged my presence. I looked at him for a few moments, the sound of his heavy breathing and the fan being the only noises. 

"Uh, the change?" I asked, breaking the silence. 

"...Huh?" Jeremy sort of asked sort of grunted in a deep guttural way. 

"You gotta give me the change, man." I told him, just as confused at his behavior, thinking this guy must be very new to this. 

"The… change… right…  right." Jeremy responded, speaking in a weirdly stilted manner, like he simply sounded the words out rather than talk.

He turned his head toward the cash register and this is when I realized something was seriously wrong and I seriously wish I just had never noticed it. Up until this point I would have just chalked his behavior up to him just being some antisocial weirdo, but the way his hand just snapped into place from the counter to the cash register… That's not how humans move. His arm didn't move from left to right naturally, rather it just jerked violently like a bear trap closing. So fast that if I hadn't looked at his arm when he did that I would not have noticed it happening. 

As his large hand fumbled clumsily in the register my mind began to slowly register what I'd just seen. Sweat droplets began forming on my brow as my breathing became just as heavy as his while I waited until finally he got the money out and placed it haphazardly on the counter. 

"Thanks, have a good one." I managed to say quickly as I picked up the change and the soda. He just did that awkward nod again in response. 

As I walked out of the door I looked back one more time, expecting to see… I don't fucking know what I was expecting, but Jeremy was just standing there as before, slouched over the counter, his body only moving from the deep breaths he took. 

I walked fast all the way back home, almost sprinting up the staircase of my apartment building then once inside locking the door instantly. I put the soda on my desk, cursing myself for going out to get it, then sat down on my office chair to catch my breath, thinking about what just happened. 

"What the fuck was that?" I mumbled to myself, wiping the sweat from my brow. I looked out the window at the store across the street from me. Still open, lights still on. I looked back at the soda, trying to confirm to myself that I didn't just imagine that encounter. 

There was no way I could get back to work after that. I just sat absentmindedly on the computer for a few more hours. I glanced out the window every 20 minutes or so, seeing customers going in and out from time to time. I just went to sleep at about 4AM, trying to take my mind off of it. 

Of course the next day when I woke up at noon it was still fresh on my mind. The feeling of dread didn't go away the entire day either but I just pretended like it didn't bother me. Tried going back to work that night, drowning out my thoughts with it. If I just didn't think about it then it couldn't affect my life, I could just go back to normal, pretend it never happened. After all, I could have just been seeing things from lack of sleep the night before. But no matter how much I tried to forget, the vivid memory of his arm moving akin to a praying mantis just wouldn't go away. 

I couldn't work or sleep soundly anymore, missing out on several commissions because of this. Dread not leaving me, I had to know what was up with this guy. On another sleepless night I decided to look out the window and see if "Jeremy" or whatever this thing is would come out when his shift ended. This would confirm if I'd just imagined the whole thing. At around 7:45 AM Jeremy awkwardly walked out the front doors and locked them. My heart was beating so hard as I watched him do the same violent snapping motions as before.

After he locked the doors he just stumbled down the street until he was out of sight. Well, not "stumbled", his body simply moved erratically, the top of his body jerking up and down as his legs carried him forward. It was like watching a marionette move. After a while one of the owners, the husband, showed up and started his shift and I just slumped back in my office chair, head in hands. Seeing that made the situation even worse. 

I just wanted to throw up after seeing that but I had to compose myself. I wasn’t crazy, I knew that much, so therefore there had to be a logical answer to this. That’s just how the world works, I would find out just what is wrong with this guy and then my life would go back to normal and maybe this would make for a funny story to tell in the future. I had to find out first.

Two days later on another sleepless night I had enough. I got dressed up, went down the stairs of my apartment building, went outside and then got behind some bushes across the street from the store. Then, I just watched Jeremy through the front doors. The nervousness I felt just turned into plain unease as he just stood there, slouched over the counter, like the first time I saw him. He wasn’t watching the TV, he wasn’t on his phone, he wasn’t even sitting down, just standing there, looking at absolutely nothing. You might’ve thought he was just sleeping while standing up if it wasn’t for the occasional wheezes and coughs that caused his body to shake.

As strange and unsettling as that was, he wasn’t doing anything incriminatory or, well, inhuman. As the night went on there was nothing out of the ordinary. He interacted with a few customers and even got up to sweep the floors twice, in that same broken movement. It didn’t make any sense, if this guy was actually a monster what did he have to gain out of working a menial job? Why would he keep the facade up when no one was looking? Eventually at 7:45 AM he just locked the shop and left, like he had two nights ago when I watched him. I didn’t follow him and just went back home to think it over.

As I sat in my office chair once again I thought that maybe I really was overreacting. I thought that maybe the guy was just handicapped and I was being an asshole for stalking him and making up these wild theories in my head. After all, none of the other customers seemed to notice that there was something wrong with him or be bothered by it. I wanted to believe that and in hindsight I should have just believed that, but instead I decided that I was gonna ask about him to just find out anything. 

I woke up at noon the next day and I went to the store. One of the owners, the husband, was sitting outside and smoking while the wife worked the register. He looked up at me and nodded with a smile on his face as I approached him.

“Hey, man, long time no see.” he greeted me and we shook hands. “Want a smoke?” he asked but I waved it off.

“I know, right?” I asked sarcastically. “Been busy with some projects so I’ve only been up at night the past week or so.” I said hoping he brings up the new schedule of the store. His eyes brightened up a bit.

“Oh, you didn’t know? We’re open at night now too, so if you need anything you can come by.” he said, before putting the cigarette back in his mouth to take another breath.

“Really now? You’re working the counter at nights too now?” I asked drily, knowing the answer already.

“Nah, I hired this one kid, his name’s Jeremy. You don’t know him, he’s from another part of town.” he explained, waving the cigarette in his hand as he talked, leaving trails of smoke.

“Really?” I asked incredulously and he nodded as I leaned back against the wall to make myself comfortable. We made some small talk afterwards, I wasn’t really listening to any of it though, I was just trying to make it look like it was a casual conversation.

“So, what about this Jeremy kid? What am I in for when I meet him?” I asked, a bit out of nowhere. He seemed surprised by the question but then relaxed again and puffed out some more smoke.

“Now I don’t know him very well, I haven’t spoken to him much since I hired him, but he’s all polite and friendly and he has a good sense of humor too, very dark though. Think you’ll like the guy.” he explained. Well, that certainly sounded different from the Jeremy I met. 

“Dark sense of humor?” I asked, intrigued. 

“Yeah,” he laughed, “you couldn’t even tell by looking at the guy, with his bright face and slicked back hair, he just looks to friendly.” he explained. Now I knew something was wrong for sure and I instantly felt a pit in my stomach. 

“Slicked… back… hair… huh?” I just repeated back absent-mindedly. He nodded and laughed. There was some more small talk after that but I couldn’t possibly listen to any of it. 

Went right back home after that, feeling sick. The puzzle was finally coming together, but it was forming into an image that I didn’t want. I’d approached this entire issue from the wrong angle. There was nothing wrong with “Jeremy” because this wasn’t Jeremy. It was something, pretending to be him, and the thought alone made my skin crawl.

I just had to know. I shouldn't have looked into it further, but I just had to know. One last stake out to see for sure. And so the next night I was once again in the bushes across the street from the store. A few hours went by and once again Jeremy locked up the store and left. This time I was going to follow him to see where he ended up.

Following him was incredibly easy, he had absolutely no awareness of anything around him. He nearly walked into a lamp post at one point. I was of course still a bit freaked out by his behavior and the quietness of the streets, but I was also filled with a bit of hatred inside of me. Hatred for this guy for making me this scared. That motivated me to follow him. 

Only a few streets away from the store he unexpectedly just turned into a dark alley. I watched him as he turned his back to a wall then his arms suddenly just bent backwards at the elbows and grabbed onto the brick wall behind him. Then just as fast as that he started climbing up the wall like that, his limbs moving like that of a spider, until he finally reached the top of the building and I lost sight of him. 

I didn’t quite know how to react, to be honest. How would you? I don’t remember the walk home either. The dread only really settled in back home, as I was sitting on my bed, thinking about what I’d just seen. There was no going back to ignorance now. 

I tried going back to not thinking about it again, feeling like the more I uncovered about this the more I’d regret it. What followed were a few more restless nights, missed out on so much work but I didn’t really care. I refused to even look out the window anymore. I had to put an end to this stupid bullshit, I couldn’t allow it to take over my life like this.

To take my mind off of it I decided to go over to my girlfriend Sarah’s house, who I hadn’t spoken to since this entire thing started. I’d neglected my entire life over something so stupid. When she opened the door to her apartment and saw me she seemed pretty pissed.

“Oh, you’re still alive, huh?” she asked in a sarcastic tone. 

“Listen I… I’m sorry,” I started, “I’ve been going through a lot lately, but I shouldn’t have neglected you. I just need someone, okay?” I said, in what must have sounded like a pretty pathetic plea. She sighed at this.

“Fine, come in and tell me about it.” she said, waving me inside. 

I sat down on her couch and started talking, but I didn’t tell her about “it”. Instead I just made up some shit about how I was depressed and stressed without mentioning the store clerk, or rather, the thing pretending to be one. Despite her initial annoyance she was pretty supportive and happy that I talked to her about it. Told her I wanted to stay at her place for a while and she accepted. 

Things were okay for about a week after that. I relaxed for a bit, started sleeping again, I didn’t entirely forget about it, but I didn’t think about it as much. I think Sarah’s presence helped me as well, being supportive of me. Of course the normalcy I’d found again didn’t last for long though.

I was watching the TV, a baseball game I think, when something caught my attention. In the first few rows there was a guy sitting slouched over, hair over his face. My heart sank and I had to do a double take, but it was real. Every time the camera showed that section of the stands he was still there. 

“Jeremy?” I thought to myself at first, but this wasn’t him. The camera was far away and he was hard to make out, but I could see that he had brown hair that was shorter. 

The camera caught him getting up to leave as the match ended and there it was, the same broken movement that Jeremy had. I looked around me for a bit after that, thinking I’d imagined it. How was this possible? There couldn’t be more of these fucking things, right? 

“What are you thinking about so seriously?”’ asked Sarah, placing her hands on my shoulders.

“Well, you know…” I said then just shrugged. 

When she said that, I swear I heard something in her voice. For only a split second, I could swear that something slipped in her speech that reminded me of how Jeremy sounded up his words. I squashed the thought, I was being paranoid.

While I could have simply chosen to believe that I imagined what I saw on television and hell, even the entire thing, I couldn’t lie to myself. I decided to do what most people do when they have a question, I looked it up online on an old laptop I'd brought to her apartment. 

Eventually, after browsing through several different subforums of paranormal websites, I found one that looked like what I was after. It was just about skin stealing creatures in particular, nothing specific. Of course, most posts looked like they’d be made by people that were insane, talking about how their family members or known ones had been replaced, government conspiracies, reptilians, basically every cliche that is associated with the types of people that post on forums like this.

I did make an account however, and posted only one thread, with the title “Did anyone see the baseball game last night?”. I didn’t leave any other details, if someone did watch it and saw the same thing as me it would confirm it. Half an hour later I’d only gotten two replies from people that were telling me I was probably on the wrong forum so I decided to check back later.

That whole experience made me even more paranoid. One thread that I read in particular caused it. The users in that one thread were talking about these skin stealing things, and how they theorized that while younger ones would be easier to spot the ones that had been in human skins longer could become indistinguishable from real humans. Now, there was nothing that could back that theory up, or back anything up on that website as it was filled with insane conspiracy theorists, but it did unsettle me to think about it.

“Hey, Sarah,” I asked from across the apartment, “when’s my birthday?”. 

“Your birthday?” she shouted back a bit confused, before thinking for a second. “It’s on 25th of May, why?” she continued, walking into the room with me. I shrugged my shoulders in response.

Although my back was turned to her, I could feel this cold burning hatred in her look. I thought I was imagining it but I felt so uncomfortable that I turned around to face her, but when I looked at her face she seemed normal, smiling even. More paranoia?

The next morning I was out at a cafe to clear up my mind. I couldn’t let the paranoia get to me, that’s all this entire thing was. It had to be. As I was sitting down to drink my coffee and think things over again, out of the corner of my eye I could have sworn that I saw one of the waitresses’ hands do the exact same snapping motion as she handed a plate of coffee cups to someone.

Nearly choking on my coffee I turned my head to look at her and she noticed me and looked back and gave me a weird knowing smile before going back to whatever she was doing. Did she know what I saw? Did I even see it or was my mind playing tricks on me? A familiar sickness came over me again so I just paid for my coffee and left without finishing it.

As I walked back home I just couldn’t shake that sick feeling. It had to be paranoia because I felt like every person was looking at me. That stupid fucking forum messed with my mind so much. It made sense though, right? That once they wore the skins of a human enough they’d be able to learn to pretend to be human. Made sense in my mind at least. 

I got home and as I opened the door Sarah was just standing there. It took her 2 seconds to greet me.

“Uh, is there something wrong?” she asked, moving out of the way to let me inside.

“Well, you know, it’s whatever.” I said, shrugging and pretending to be cool. She seemed concerned but didn’t say anything. 

I went to the bathroom and washed my face a couple of times to cool down. I looked at myself in the mirror for a while afterwards. I wasn’t losing my mind, was I? If you had asked me a week ago if I really saw Jeremy climb up that building I would tell you that I did see it without a doubt, but now I wasn’t so sure. Was I having a psychotic break? 

Later that evening I went back to that forum to see if I got any other replies, though by that point I was planning to just try and forget about the entire thing again. As I should have expected by then, the thread was deleted by a moderator for being off-topic. I was going to delete my account and forget about it but then I noticed a private message.

It was from an user called MrWhiteRabbit87. I checked out his profile, the account was 10 years old with no posts. The message read : “Saw your post. Meet me at Siegel Bar tomorrow at 9 AM. Delete message after you read it”. 

“What the fuck?” I muttered to myself underneath my breath after reading that. It was probably some lunatic knowing that website, but it did say it wanted to meet in a public place however so there was little danger there. I decided to do as it asked, out of curiosity, and I deleted the message.

I barely slept that night, as tired as I was mentally. I couldn’t stop thinking about who wanted to meet me. I got a cold shiver when for a second I considered that it could have been one of those things trying to trap me. I tried squashing the thought, but the sound of my girlfriend’s breathing unnerved me further. 

“Where are you going?” Sarah asked me, rubbing her eyes as I got out of bed and began dressing early in the morning.

“I’m meeting a friend.” I replied rather coldly as I got ready to leave.

“At a bar or something?” she asked, raising an eyebrow jokingly. That took me off guard.

“What?” I asked, and she must have sensed that it bothered me since her smile faded.

“Uh, I’m just asking. Is there something wrong?” she continued. I shrugged my shoulders then left. 

She must’ve read the message. Now it could have just been a lucky guess, but something inside of me told me that it wasn’t. What was she doing looking through my account on such an obscure website? I began sweating nervously as I made my way to the bar, deciding that it would have to wait for later. 

I got to Siegel Bar at around 8:45 PM, sat down at a table in the back and ordered a beer for myself, though I didn't touch it. Only about ten minutes later a man that appeared to be in his 40s with short brown hair, stubble on his face that wore sunglasses indoors walked up from behind me. He looked at me, nodded, then sat down at the opposite end of the table from me.

“I’m Mr. Grayson, pleased to meet you.” he said, extending his hand out to me which I shook. “I know who you are, I saw your post.” he continued in a low deep tone, his voice like that of a chain smoker.

“Then who are you?” I asked him. He put up a hand to stop my questions and he turned around at the red haired waitress with bangs who I always thought had a weird look with that haircut.

“Hey, can I get a mug of beer?” he asked her. “Whatever works, I’m not going to finish it anyway.” 

He waited until he got his mug then he took a long loud sip out of it before sighing and looking back at me. I wasn’t exactly impatient at this point, the entire experience was weird enough to not be boring as much as unsettling.

“So, who are you?” I asked Mr. Grayson again.

“I’m with the government, kid.” he explained before reaching into his coat for a cigarette then putting it back in, realizing it’s a bar with a no smoking rule.

“What branch?” I asked him.

“What?” he asked back, confused.

“What branch of the government do you work for?” I asked again, this time louder and clearer.

“Listen, kid, do you think I’m gonna expose a branch of the government that shouldn’t even exist to some random guy this casually?” he replied, smiling slily.

“Are you here to kill me or something?” I asked jokingly. He chuckled drily.

“Would I sit down to have a beer with you if I wanted to kill you? Seems like kind of a waste of time.” he smiled.

There was a bit more awkward silence after that, he drank some more beer and I wanted to take a sip of mine too but I decided against it. It was like neither of us wanted to start talking about the subject.

“So uh…”, I started, “What about the baseball game?” I asked, a bit more quietly. He sighted.

“Well, I know those things exist, if that’s what you’re asking me. You’re not crazy.” he explained to me.

“Does the government fuckin’ plan to do anything about it?” I asked, more aggressively. Once again he put out his hand for me to relax.

“That’s why I’m here. We’ve been trying to for uhh…”, he started, scratching his chin, “About 20 years ago. I got assigned to this case about 10 years ago, myself. The situation is more complex than you think.”

“Can you at least tell me what the fuck these things are then?” I asked him, calmer this time. He pursed his lips before leaning slightly forward.

“We believe that what we’re dealing with here is a species of parasite-like creatures that cannot live in their own bodies and require the skins of humans to survive.” he explained, with no humor in his voice.

“Believe?” I asked incredulously.

“Yeah, believe, we haven’t exactly been able to catch one yet. These things are hard to find as it is, we’ve theorized that they make up less than 1% of the world’s population and we only got random anonymous reports to go by when hunting them.” he explained again. “For some reason a considerable amount of the reports come from this city.”

“So are they like skinwalkers then?” I asked, trying to relate it to a concept I’m familiar with. He pursed his lips.

“Similar, but not quite. Unlike skinwalkers these aren’t spirits. The skin stealing in this sense is literal, it’s why they seem so misshapen trying to act like humans.” he explained. 

“What’s… their end game?” I asked, starting to feel sick again.

“Well…”, he started, sighing, “It depends on who you ask. Some of the guys back at the headquarters believe that their only goal is survival. That it’s simply a sort of symbiotic relationship of nature and that we can coexist without worry, apart from the few thousands that have been killed and had their skin stolen.”

“And the others?” I asked, wanting him to go on.

“You can probably imagine. Conspiracy theories about world domination, replacing humanity, taking over, all that shit.” he explained. 

There was some more awkward silence after that as he sipped more on his beer and I thought about what he told me.

“Which one do you believe?” I asked. He smiled at me.

“I couldn’t say this back at the headquarters, so you’re listening to some top secret information right here.” he said then leaned over the table. “You know how this case has been going on for a really long time and we have zero information on any of it? I believe that there are people within our very own government that have been replaced by those things. I’m talking about people that are very high up there.”

There was a lot to take in. Some random guy who could’ve been anybody meeting me, claiming he’s a government agent, validating what surely must have been my own mind making things up? He had to be lying, I couldn’t allow the situation to spiral out of control any further.

“Do you have any proof for any of this? Like that you’re actually a government agent?” I asked, confident.

“Christ, listen, kid, right now I could tell you anything from who actually killed Kennedy to classified records about experiments we ran on the population back in the 60s. Point is, I don’t need you to believe me, you’re the one who I’m trying to help here.” he explained, visibly ticked off. 

“So no proof?” I replied back smugly. He grunted before leaning over the table again.

“Friday night a Saudi oil baron is going to die. He’s going to be killed but they’ll say it was an accident.” he said coldly. 

That certainly made me drop my aura of smugness. I shook my head at what I’d just heard and recomposed myself.

“Okay, so assuming you are who you say you are, why did you contact me?” I asked.

“Because I needed to talk to someone outside of the government for help on this case. You seem like you have some history with those things.” he explained, going back to his cool demeanor.

“So what do you want me to do?” I asked. He looked at his watch before answering.

“Look, I’m running a bit late here. Basically if you want to help me, when you see one of those things again, you call me.” he said then slid a business card to me. Before I could say anything he cut me off. “Oh, and here’s the thing. If you know for certain it’s one of those things, do not, under any circumstances, try to confront it. Who knows what it will do? It was nice meeting you.” he said then got up to leave.

“Wait!” I said and he turned around to see what I wanted. “How do I know you’re not one of those things?”

“Christ…” he sighed. “You’ve seen those things, you’d know instantly if i was one of them. Besides…”, he said, lowering his sunglasses to reveal two piercing blue eyes, “See? Eyes are the window to the soul, it’s why they cover theirs. If you don’t trust me just burn the card and never think about this again.” and with that he left.

After he left I sat at the bar for some ten more minutes. I looked at the business card, thumbing it back and forward. It had his name on it with a phone number. Didn’t list any workplace though. 

I paid for the beer I didn’t even touch then went back home, feeling just all around empty inside. Sarah was cooking dinner as I got back. I looked her up and down, she appeared to be ever so slightly taller than I remembered. When she turned around to look at me I just shrugged. It couldn’t be, right?

The next few days after that were just a blur. I was just waiting for Friday to finally come to see if Mr. Grayson was who he actually claimed he was. Of course I already knew, but I just needed to see. 

Friday night I was glued to the TV screen, waiting. It was just like he said, a very influential oil baron died. Apparently he had slipped in the bath tub and cracked his head open, though there were discrepancies about the official narrative. 

I think I chuckled to myself when I saw that. That beyond confirmed it, as if I needed any more confirmation than seeing Jeremy climbing up that building with my very own eyes. I knew that I hadn’t imagined any of it, I just didn’t want to believe it. It was time to do something about it, however. I was going to call Mr. Grayson and tell him about Jeremy, however…

“What are you laughing about?” Asked Sarah from behind me. I smiled and shrugged again, she just shook her head.

“Hey, when’s our anniversary?” I asked her out of nowhere.

“Huh?” she asked, confused. “We met on February 3rd, why?”. 

“Just wanted to see if you knew.” I replied, staring right into her eyes this time as I said it. She seemed confused but then just shrugged it off.

Jeremy would have to wait, there was another one closer to me. Now I know what he said about eyes being the window to the sole or whatever, but he could have been wrong about that. It’s not like they ever caught one to know.

The next couple of days I spent closely examining my girlfriend, watching her every move. I don’t think I got a single full night of sleep during those few days. I closely watched everything she did. I could swear I was seeing her do movements similar to Jeremy but I couldn’t tell if it was due to the tiredness and it frustrated me to no end.

I also kept asking her personal questions that only she would know. Her parent’s name, the name of her first dog, the name of my uncle, and every time I asked it seemed like she got increasingly annoyed. I couldn’t tell if it was because the thing thought I was onto it or it was my girlfriend annoyed at my behavior. 

It was at that point that the fear that I felt from these things started to turn into hatred. The months at that point of confusion, dread, lack of sleep, the paranoia that they made me feel, it was all boiling over.

As I sat there on the couch, staring at her and grinding my teeth in anger as I continued to survey her movement, she turned around at me and sighed annoyed.

“What the fuck is your problem?” Sarah asked. “I’ve tried to be nice, but please tell me, I want to know why you’re like this.”

“You know why.” I responded, gripping the edges of the couch.

“No, I don’t,” she replied defensively, “I want to know what your problem is so I can help you.”

She looked at me and I looked at her for a while. I still couldn’t decide if she actually was one of those things or not, but in that moment I was almost convinced she was.

“Well?” she asked again, impatiently. I’d made my choice, I was going to confront it.

“I know who-”, I started then stopped myself, “No, no, I know what you are.” 

“What?” she asked me, confused. Pretending to be confused?

“I know that you’re not Sarah.” I replied simply.

“Then what the fuck do you think I am?” she asked, annoyed. “You’re being delusional.” she said and I didn’t respond.

She continued staring at me while I didn’t say anything, I was studying her face the entire time and she (it?) seemed to do the same to me, but I just couldn’t tell. 

“Do you think I’m an impostor?” she asked again. “Like a skin walker or something?”

“Not quite.” I replied, leaning back in the couch. That line… it seemed to have triggered something inside of her. That’s when I finally made up my mind, a decision I would have to live with for the rest of my life.

“Listen, I am your girlfriend Sarah, okay?” she started but I wasn’t really listening to a word coming out of her mouth. “I’m not some made up creature or monster or whatever.” 

I didn’t reply, I just sat back on the couch, my head tilted to the side a bit as I listened to her lie to me.

“I think you’ve been listening to too many horror stories or something, get a grip, please.” she laughed nervously.

I still didn’t respond. Anything she would try to tell me were just attempts at deluding me, I knew. 

“Come on, don’t act like this.” she said and reached over to grab my arm but I recoiled it away. She sighed. “Stop being absurd, I’m not going to hurt you.” 

She looked me in the eyes again and waited for me to say something but I remained quiet. I must’ve seem pretty calm but inside of me the rage was building up, every time I heard this creature tried to lie to me using my girlfriend’s voice. She pouted at me and rolled her eyes.

“Fine, believe whatever you want.” she said and turned around to leave.

The moment she turned around I got up from the couch and hit her in the back of the head as hard as I could. As her body went limp and collapsed I grabbed the back of the head and hit her face against the floor a few more times to make sure she wasn’t getting up. I didn’t want to give this thing a single chance.

I walked over to the kitchen, eyes on the body the entire time, and I grabbed a knife that I used to slit her throat with, black blood spilling out onto the carpeted floor. 

I sat back on the couch after this, breathing heavily as I looked at the body. I had such a feeling of pride inside of me for finally doing something about it after months of torment. I hated these fucking things so much. I stared at the body for a few minutes, part of me almost expecting it to pop back up again, but it didn’t. The adrenaline started to slowly wash away and I realized that I now had a dead body on my hands and needed to do something about it.

It wouldn’t have been far-fetched to imagine that the police were in on this too so I had to do something about it. I grabbed my wallet and left the apartment, eyeing the body as I walked out the door. It still didn't move. 

After this it turns into kind of a blur again. I returned half an hour later with a canister of gasoline that I bought at a gas station, I believe, and I began pouring it all around the apartment, the smell was absolutely intoxicating. Afterwards I sat in the doorway for a bit, watching the body. It still did not move. This wasn’t quite right. I set the apartment ablaze and walked off.

When I was younger (around 6 or 7) I lived in my old house. I never believed in anything paranormal, until then. One night, I had to get up to use the bathroom.  The bathroom was directly across the hall from my room. Afterwards, I was walking back to my room, and heard kids laughing down the hall (towards our kitchen.) I had no clue what to do, so like any sensible child, I ran to my bed and curled into a ball. I was so scared that I couldn't sleep the rest of the night. A while later (3 or 4 months) we moved to our new house (the one I live at now.) I thought all of the paranormal events would end, but Holy shit I was wrong. My first experience at this house happened a few months after I moved in. I went to use the bathroom again, and in this house it is all the way down the hall. I went to the bathroom, cleaned up, and walked back to my room. No big deal.  That is until I looked at the large mirror we have at the other end of the hall. I saw a man standing in the bathroom doorway. He was about 6 feet tall, wearing a blue shirt, and brown pants, he was balding and he kinda looked like a stereotypical plumber. I turned around to look at the doorway, mostly expecting him to dissappear, but he didn't. He just stared. He didn't move.  He didn't blink. He didn't breathe. He just stared. I freaked the fuck out, ran to my room, and again curled up into a ball.  That was the first and last I had seen of any paranormal activity in this new house, until I was older. I was around 13 or 14 at this point. I was in my parents room talking to my mom, and as I was walking out, I saw a younger woman, around her mid twenties, just casually walking into the room. I asked my mom if she saw it, and she didn't. My mom believes what I see,  and I believe what she sees. I walked out and went about my day. I experienced many things after that, and they happen all the time. I am just used to it at this point. But one thing I wasn't used to, is this. One night, maybe a year ago, or sooner, I woke up. I had a horrible nightmare. The kind where you forget everything in life, except that dream, and you are sweating profusely, and are unable to speak. One of those nightmares.  I eventually calmed down, and slowly moved to a sitting position on the side of my bed. I grabbed my water bottle, took a drink, and as I was setting it back down, I felt a freezing cold breeze to my left. I looked over, and saw a big, dark, and tall figure just staring at me. I had no clue how to react. I stared for a few seconds, and did the only sensible thing that a slightly mature 17 year old could do...I screamed like a little bitch and ran. I ran to the living room, sat down quickly, and started to panic.  Should I go back to bed? Should I stay here? Should I call the cops to see if they can arrest a ghost/demon/shadow moster/maybe Batman? I didn't know what to do. Eventually, after a long sit, I decided to go back to bed. When I walked back into my room, I didn't see it anymore, so I just went to bed. That is the first time that I was actually scared of my heartbeat. It was so fast, loud, and hard, that I thought I actually was going to have a heart attack.  To this day, I still can't fathom the fear that I faced that night. I try to come to terms with it, but I can't. It is one situation that I NEVER want to be in again.

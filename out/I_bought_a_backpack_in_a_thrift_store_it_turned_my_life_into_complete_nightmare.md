My old backpack has seen some better days, so I went to get a new one. Luckily there’s a big thrift shop nearby, so I could buy something decent without spending too much. Besides, why pay extra for a bag,  mainly used to carry my groceries around, right?

&#x200B;

And there it was - my new belonging: a bit worn out, though sturdy with leather inserts and reinforced straps. I found it in the pile of dozen others, mostly Mickey Mouse & Avenger themed ones. Lucky me!

&#x200B;

After checking it all around, with no holes or stains being visible I went straight to the register without hesitations. 

Paid just $20, so a win-win situation. My day was getting better. 

&#x200B;

Then I stopped to grab a burger on my way home, and while the order was prepared - I’ve decided to transfer everything from my pockets into the backpack. So I’ve unzipped it to discover, that it was not quite empty, as it seemed. One of the inside pockets contained a folded sheet of shabby paper with a hole in it and a pen, a pebble and a half-used eraser. I took the paper out to check for clues, like, you know - to develop some non-mutual connection with the previous owner or something. It’s just a natural curiosity to find out who owned the thing before you. And I could bet it belonged to a school kid, or graduate, probably. 

&#x200B;

Well, I unfolded the paper to read the following:

“I’m sorry, but this is yours now. Maybe one day you can forgive me. I still don’t understand what it is, but I can’t let it hurt Danny again. Just follow these couple of rules, I’ve discovered and don’t let anyone take it from you.

1. It likes apples and mince meat. Leave at least a small piece by it everyday.

2. Don’t let it get wet, you will regret this.

3. It’s fine if somebody touches it, while you hold it. Just don’t let go. 

4. Keep it away from other people and your pets when you’re at home. Hide it somewhere. 

This is all I got so far. Please, forgive me.“

&#x200B;

Whoa! That kid was probably not really popular in his class, I guess. Who the hell was Danny? imaginary friend or something? And yeah, that edgy message of “don’t touch my backpack, or else…” - that was definitely something. 

&#x200B;

I’ve looked deeper and in a moment the whole “collection” of forgotten items resided before me on a table: apart from stone and used writing stuff I also got a shoelace, a paper clip, some rubber bands and  a coke bottle cap. Not much, and frankly speaking - I would prefer that kid to forget a dollar or two, but oh well. 

&#x200B;

So after having the meal, I grabbed all that junk and put it into the trash bin altogether with burger wrappings and cup. It was time to test out my new baby!

&#x200B;

I’ve bought some milk, eggs and other edible stuff in my local mart and went home. Brilliant thing - not too tight,  holds the weight perfectly and looks stylish. I was absolutely satisfied with the purchase. 

&#x200B;

By the evening - I’ve already forgot about that cryptic teen message and the story would never land here, if it wasn’t for what happened next.

&#x200B;

Couple of days went by, and all I could care about was my job and watching some Netflix after it, cracking a cold one or two. I’m a lonely guy in my primes, so no annoying chores or missions, unless I decide so. 

Yeah, your classic chipmunk wheel of sleep-work-drink-sleep, you know what I’m saying? And it was completely fine by me, no complaints. But that morning my descend began.

&#x200B;

It was Saturday, I woke up later than usual and decided to cook some eggs & bacon for breakfast.  Heat on, skillet on, oil in, eggs cracked… And then I just froze for a second, refusing to believe my eyes. It just couldn’t be true, but right in front of me, at the bottom of my frying pan  - there was a human thumb. I’ve blinked rapidly, trying to make the morbid vision go away. But it was still there. 

&#x200B;

And no, that was not a chicken embryo shaped weirdly. That was a human thumb: I could clearly see a nail and the clean cut below the knuckle joint. Holy fucking shit! I think it belonged rather to a man, than a woman. 

&#x200B;

Without an extra do - I’ve called the cops. And should I say that next weeks  turned into a huge steaming pile of troubles? I’ve been asked hundred of questions, they made me take a drug test (which was humiliating, though I had no intention to cause further suspicion), they checked the store and made some lab tests. 

&#x200B;

As a result - the investigation went sideways to the hen farm, as the test results came back stating that the shell indeed has traces of human tissues, and though nobody had any rational explanation to this - they left me alone for now. 

&#x200B;

What the fuck, man? What the fuck? I’ve never heard about anything like this in my life!

But it was just the beginning. 

&#x200B;

Next evening, I was watching some show and felt a sudden urge to sneeze and as I did - something went flying over the room, landing on a floor with a rattle. That was strange, so I stood up to check it out and imagine my confusion when I saw a human tooth lying on the ground. 

&#x200B;

I grabbed it a went straight to the bathroom  to check myself in a mirror. Sweat dripped down my spine, as I realized that tooth was not one of my own - no holes, no bleeding patches, nothing. 

&#x200B;

I kept the fact to myself and didn’t go to the hospital, because, you know - the cops were already on the edge, and showing up with some other body parts, yeah, thanks but no, thanks. 

&#x200B;

What was happening? I had no clue. But something definitely was not right. I’ll skip the part where I pose myself like a complete idiot, contacting so-called paranormal experts and parapsychology professors of all sorts and cut down to a point of what one of them said: “Try to remember, maybe you got some new things recently? Things that didn’t actually belong to you? That doesn’t have to be a stolen phone or anything. Maybe you found something on the street and that something is empowered with dark energy…”.

&#x200B;

Of course, the backpack! That was “not mine”, even though I paid for it and I suddenly recalled the written message included. Is the thing cursed? Should I burn it? But what if that will make things even worse?

So I’ve decided to stick with what was written in the note first.

&#x200B;

What was it? Some apples and meat must be left by it every day? Ok, got it. There was something about not letting anyone touch it, too. But I live alone, so we’re safe here. And something-something, think-think…. Gremlin! Yes! Don’t let it get wet. 

&#x200B;

So I did what I could - I’ve put a small plate of apple pieces and beef mince next to it, hoping to see any reaction by the morning. 

&#x200B;

But there was none. Just a couple of fruit flies found their way to the treat, and the plate was untouched. “Well, maybe it doesn’t consume it? Maybe the smell is enough?” - I thought to myself.

&#x200B;

I was all pins and needles through the whole day, without proper conclusion if that worked or not. 

&#x200B;

It did not. In the evening I felt my throat going sore and just moments later I coughed up a wet lock of hair, bending in half on my carpet. It hurt like hell. Spitting out the stuck hairs I went to the fridge to grab some orange juice to clear my throat, though something atrocious awaited me there. As the door opened I’ve witnessed  a swarm of tadpoles sitting in the bottle, packed so tightly they could barely move. 

&#x200B;

I think all the heavenly forces and the Lord himself  helped me to keep me myself sane. 

&#x200B;

I took the backpack, a lighter and went to the yard with firm intention to burn the fucker down. As I watched the flames licking the fabric and the cracking leather indents - the whisper of doubt somewhere deep inside, repeated: “What if this is not enough?”.

&#x200B;

Apparently, it was not. After discovering an extra pair of ears on my pillow in the morning, clean cut and no blood - I’ve suddenly realized the most horrible outcome of this whole situation. I remembered the paper, how shabby it was and how I didn’t pay much attention to other stuff when taking it out. 

&#x200B;

What if that warning message, the sheet itself enfolded the It, the subject and after tossing the bag around - it just fell out from the fold? What if it’s not the backpack but something that was within it destroys my life? 

What could it be? That pebble that looks just like any other pebble you can find on the ground? The eraser maybe?

&#x200B;

And then it hit me hard. So hard, that my heart just stopped beating for a single moment, as a cruel realization of what I have done bloomed in my head… I will never find it. It’s just impossible. I threw it out to a trash bin in a burger place couple of weeks ago. Even if I knew what exactly I’m supposed to look for - it’s most probably buried under tons of trash in a dumpster somewhere outside the city. 

&#x200B;

I’ve never expected to hear about something like this, not even saying about being a part of the cruel scenario. I have no other choice but to pin down where the garbage truck went and put my life to finding that exact trash sack from the burger place before it’s too late. Consider this a goodbye letter, I know my odds. Besides, my stomach is kinda painfully irritated for couple of hours already, and I really don’t like this feeling. Wish me luck.

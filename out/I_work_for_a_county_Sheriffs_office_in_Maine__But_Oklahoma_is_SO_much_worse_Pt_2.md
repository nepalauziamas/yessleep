When I called the number it rang out. I’m not sure what I expected, the number looked old, really old. I doubted it was still in service and it was an instruction left by Gregory, whom I had come to realise was just one in a long line of incompetence.

The park reopened on schedule and I focused more on the policies management side of the job than the patrolling. There was plenty to learn from paperwork and I wasn’t especially keen to go near the lake again. When I got the chance though, I called into the police station. I had hoped that they might have gotten some information back on the bodies.

‘Hi, it’s officer Charles calling from the reserve, I’m following up on the bodies found last week. Is the autopsy report available yet?’ I asked when a female reception worker answered the line.

‘One moment please.’ She responded and I waited. A long moment passed before the receiver picked up again.

‘Officer Charles, this is officer Davids, we met the other night. I’m Lennard’s partner.’ Davids introduced himself as if I knew who Lennard was.

‘Hi Davids. Yeah, I was just checking in to see if there was any word back yet on cause of death?’ I asked, trying not to sound too unfamiliar. Back in Maine we don’t give out any details about anything over the phone, but I was optimistic that everyone in this area was substandard.

On the other end, Davids was quiet a long moment. I could hear him ruffling through papers and I was almost beginning to wonder if he had intended to hang up on me but forgot, ‘We got the report back this morning. I haven’t had the chance to read it.’ He admitted.

‘Take your time.’ I assured, trying not to sound impatient.

‘Okay. Says here that cause of death was..’ He hesitated then began reading in paraphrases, ‘..*Excessive fluid Intake.. Due to processes unknown… by an unknown manner*.. ‘

I interrupted him there, ‘Cause of death was *Not* drowning?’ I clarified.

Another pause.

‘No, unless that’s what they mean by ‘excessive fluid intake’. ‘ he answered.

‘Huh. That’s odd.’ I commented before ending the call. Across the room Devin looked at me with a raised brow and I realised I might have hung up too abruptly but I didn’t really care. An idea was formulating itself and I didn’t want to lose the train of thought, “I’m heading out on patrol.” I announced as I got up.

“Careful out there.” Devin warned, as if I needed to be told.

It was a fine day, not too warm, not too cold. I was sure that the place would normally have been teaming with visitors. Although I suppose not all that many were game enough to visit a place where multiple bodies had been discovered so recently. As it was there were only a handful of people around. I stopped and chatted with a couple of them on my way.

I had decided that I was going to go and investigate where I had seen the deer, after all the animal had gotten away. That suggested to me that whatever was in the water wasn’t always fatal. Though I will admit it was a morbid curiosity that drew me toward the lake.

Keeping what I thought was a safe distance I looked out across it’s glittery surface. In the daylight, it didn’t seem so bad. If I hadn’t seen what I had seen I would have even gone as far as to say that the lake looked inviting. As I stood there I spotted two teens swimming in the water, they had taken a running leap off the end of the pier and were messing about.

I felt dread thinking about what might be sharing the water with them and knew I had to do something so I marched over, “You can’t swim here, the lake is off limits. There’s algae blooms this time of year, very poisonous. Get out and go wash yourselves or it’ll melt your skin off.” I lied using my authority voice.

The look of pure horror on their faces as they scrambled to get out of the water made me feel slightly guilty, maybe I had laid it on too thick. I didn’t mean to scare them to death. Nonetheless I was satisfied that they would follow my instruction even after I had walked away. Privileges the uniform gives you, I guess.

By then I realized I was near to where I had witnessed the deer getting attacked and, against my better judgement, I cautiously approached the area. Everything looked resoundingly normal at first glance. Then the smell hit me. It was unmistakable. The musky rotting odour drifted on the wind and I decided to follow it.

It was coming from deeper in the forest and I left the trail in pursuit. The woods were thick with undergrowth, I made a good racket pushing my way through the brush. It was hard to see too far ahead but when my boots landed on damp ground I stopped. The smell was almost overpowering now. I regretted not keeping any peppermint rub on me.

Hesitantly I looked more closely at the immediate area around, I wasn’t sure what to expect or if I really wanted to find anything. Then I spotted the source of the foul odour. In a bush not four feet away from me was a doe. She was very dead and very swollen, water leaked from her fur. I knew immediately that this was the same deer I had seen the night before.

My heart sank, the thing in the water had touched her and this was the result. I had been wrong in assuming it wasn’t fatal. Maybe that was just how this thing hunted. Like a viper striking it’s prey and leaving it to die. I shuddered at the thought.

I made my way back toward the pier and was surprised to see a person standing there. Or rather it was mostly human in shape, but the posture was slightly off. I felt my blood run cold, the creature from the lake, I thought. I drew up my gun and the figure moved slightly. I blinked and the posture seemed to correct itself, it became perfectly normal now as I understood who I was looking at.

“Eric?” I questioned dumbfounded.

“Planning to shoot me again?” He responded without emotion as he turned toward me. I knew that I was correct in my assumption even before he spoke. The empty jacket sleeve moved with the breeze, his bad arm bandaged and close to his body. The cane in his left hand supporting his stride. He wasn’t someone who could be easily mistaken for anyone else.

It’s strange to say, but I felt relieved to see him. The calm with which he spoke made me feel like everything was under control now. Or maybe it was just that he was a somewhat familiar face. I lowered my weapon and approached, “You got my call?”

Eric nodded, returning his attention to the water. I could see that darkened purple-ish eye of his focusing below the surface on things I couldn’t hope to imagine. His expression was unreadable, though he seemed somehow uncomfortable looking into the water.

“Can you ahh.. *See* anything?” I asked trying to sound encouraging.

“No.” He answered, his expression then was odd. Caught somewhere between annoyance and discomfort as he began limping his way off the pier, “It’s dark down in the water. I can’t see far enough.”

“Warden Devin told me the lake is very deep. Personally I can’t see anything in that muck.” I agreed.

He smiled slightly with cynicism, “I can see a little bit further than you can, Charles.” He assured.

“Right.” I returned the smile nervously, not willing to question him further about it. I had seen him use whatever abilities it was that he had before, and I wasn’t in any hurry to see him use them again, “I expected your father to answer when I called the number.” I commented to change the subject.

He looked surprised for a moment then seemed to understand, “I don’t have a father. The number is my own. Has been since telephones were invented.” He stated flatly.

I laughed unsurely, he was joking, I think. An odd joke to make perhaps, but he was an odd man, “So what do you think then? Have you experienced anything like this before?”

At this he hesitated, “I think, this is going to be a miserable experience. I hate the water.” The honesty in his voice caught me off guard, was he *afraid* of water? I wondered to myself as he continued, “I have seen this before, I need to take a walk. There’s something I have to find and we’re going to need a lot of salt.”

“Is there any special kind of salt we need?” I found myself asking without really thinking.

Eric paused a moment, the conversation was uncomfortable and we both could feel it, “Any salt is fine. However, smaller grain salt is more effective…” He instructed.

“Right. Well.. Be careful out there. There’s a monster in the lake, I’m pretty sure.” I said tentatively.

“Yes, something like that.” He agreed, starting off into the forest without another word. It’s difficult to describe how uneasy you feel watching someone just disappear into the woods, especially as someone trained to keep people from getting lost in said woods. However, I had the feeling that I would only slow him down if I accompanied him.

Shopping for the salt was awkward. I waited in line listening to the convenience store music with my cart full of salt and prayed no one would ask me anything about it. I wasn’t sure what reasonable excuse I could come up with. I wasn’t even sure there *was* a reasonable excuse for buying so much salt.

When I got back to the office I was surprised to see the car park full of trucks. They looked like the kind of vehicles that avid hunters would take into the woods and I briefly wondered why so many of them were here. However upon approaching the building I could hear shouting coming from inside and hurried to see what was going on.

The lobby was full of sweaty, agitated, men with rifles, the room smelt of alcohol and cigarettes. Above the general chatter of the crowd I could hear Devin’s voice as he spoke loudly, “We can’t let this lake monster terrorise our community any longer! We need to take matters into our own hands and hunt it down!”

There was an uproar of support for his statement and I got a sinking feeling in my gut. It’s generally known that letting a bunch of half drunk men with guns out into the woods at night doesn’t often end well. Carefully I made my way through the people to the front of the crowd hoping I would be able to convince Devin out of this plan.

Reaching the front I was taken aback to see that Eric was already there, speaking to Devin. He looked out of place in the office setting. His expression was, as always, devoid of emotion though he was leaning forward slightly over the front desk. Using the fingertips of his left hand to support himself as he spoke in a low threatening tone, “If you allow all these men to go marching off into the woods it will be a massacre.”

“Nonsense. These men are seasoned hunters and no one here is afraid.” The warden assured.

“You are a bigger fool than Gregory if you believe this is a good idea.” Eric retorted.

Devin ignored him then, his attention turning to me, “Charles! Good timing. Will you be joining us?” He asked jovially, with the scent of whisky on his breath.

“Joining you in what exactly?” I asked to gain some clarity on the situation.

“We are all going out to the lake and we’re going to shoot anything that moves. We’ll get the f\*cker.” he assured confidently.

“Devin, I don’t think that’s a good idea.. Getting civilians involved-“ he cut me off with a scoff.

“Fine. Stay here then. They breed them weak in Maine I see.” He muttered the last part quieter though I still felt my blood pressure rise.

For a moment I wanted to argue but Eric interrupted me, “Don’t waste your breath on the likes of him. Let them do what they like.”

I was a little shocked, “Are you sure?” Was all I could blurt out.

“Did you get the salt?”

“Yes.”

“Then I’m sure. It just means I’ll have to work faster. Come.” He instructed calmly as he made his way out the building.

I followed after Eric as he asked and he lead me outside, “What are we going to do?” I asked unsurely.

“..We *should* do nothing. Let those idiots get cut down like the fools they are.” He muttered, “Hold onto this for me.” He added and to my astonishment he handed me his cane. There was a soft ‘click’ like bone restructuring and he began to walk normally without assistance.

“You don’t need it?” I asked numbly. Vaguely I remembered seeing him walk without it once before. Though I hadn’t at that time, noticed that the structure of his leg seemed to change. Now it appeared slightly abnormal despite his gait being even.

“Not for more than appearances.” He assured though seemed almost entertained by my shock.

“Okay.. But how will salt help? What are we going to do?” I repeated, trying to deny the abnormalities.

Eric ignored me for a moment as he began un-bandaging his right arm. I shuddered remembering it. Discoloured purple black skin with a rough texture and fingertips that ended in long blackened claws… I wondered if it was because I had seen it before that he felt no need to hide it from me. Truthfully, I preferred it when he kept it bandaged.

Once his arm was unwrapped he flexed his fingers, stretching out the claws tentatively. He then took off his jacket, letting it drop to the ground. I realised that under it he was wearing a black tank top with what looked like an altered version of a light weight tactical harness over it. There were knives on the belt. I couldn’t see why he would even need them with the claws he had, but it seemed as if it was purpose built equipment.

Then I noticed his right shoulder. The skin there was scarred and mangled as if it had been ripped open before healing around his modified arm. I found myself staring. There was also an odd silver crescent on his throat, just below his jaw with a secondary inverted crescent not far from the first creating almost a circle. I had never noticed it before as the collar of his coat was high, but now I wondered how I missed it, and, what it was. Some strange birthmark?

“Charles. You’re staring.” He said coldly, his voice breaking through my thoughts.

“I wasn’t- I mean, I just.. Are you okay?” I asked giving up on defending myself, “That looks like it must’ve hurt.”

“It did.” He said calmly, “But not half as much as what I’ll do to you will if I catch you staring at me again.”

I said nothing, I was a trained investigator. It’s second nature for me to notice things.. But perhaps when it came to Eric, I would make an effort to ignore certain details. My silence seemed to satisfy him, “Good.” He stated, “Now, we’re going to act before your friends all get themselves killed.” He smiled unsettlingly.

I knew then that it was going to be a long night.

\*Sorry, typo, I meant bitch. My flatmate is a fucking bitch. And unfortunately moving out isn't really an option for me.

Clara seemed great at first. Of course, she did. I mean I probably wouldn't have moved in if she showed her true face from the start.

No, that's a lie. I was crazy desperate and all the red flags in the world wouldn't have kept me from moving in. My only other option was becoming homeless as I was about to be kicked out of my uni flat after graduating. On top of that, the housing market in my town was quite literally hell so I was happy when I found a place that I could actually afford. 

Clara sounded nice on the phone and invited me right over to have a look at the place. Two bedrooms, one living room with an open kitchen, and a decently sized bathroom. She greeted me with a friendly smile and showed me around. 

The interior was a bit minimalistic, mostly black and white furniture, one or two pieces of art. The kitchen was clean and she had a shit ton of spices.

"We can share everything in the kitchen, I think it's easiest that way? If you don't want to share groceries that's fine of course but if you wanna use any of my stuff that's cool," she said during our tour. 

"Oh, sharing is fine," I smiled. I wanted her to like me. I needed this room. And I wasn't sure whether me being a guy might be a problem.

I didn't have to be nervous, however, Clara adored me. She called me the very next morning after the tour and offered me the room. And I accepted right away. I felt a great vibe both from her and the place.

And I have to admit when she smiled at me during that first apartment tour with her poison green eyes, I may have felt a little mesmerized too. 

But not anymore. No, not after going through hell with that bitch. 

\--

During our tour, she never showed me her own room which I later learned was the opposite of the sterile and clean apartment. Her room was full of glasses and containers filled with different stuff I didn't recognize. She had all sorts of different candles and a shit ton of books on the floor, under her bed, and on the shelves. There were around 15 pillows on her bed and a bunch of lamps everywhere. 

Clara never actually showed me her room, I broke in one time when she wasn't home. Yeah, I know that sounds bad but there was a reason for it I swear. The consequences of the war that my flatmate herself initiated.

It all started with the passive-aggressive note she left on the fridge door without a reason in the world. It was only one day after I'd moved in and I swear I hadn't even given this girl one reason to hate me yet. 

**HOUSE RULES**

**-No guests after 1 AM** 

**-Any visitor must be announced first**

**-No pets**

**-Shared rooms must stay clean at all times** 

**-No going to my room without permission**

She came in just as I was reading the rules and smiled like that list was the most normal thing in the world.

"Everything alright? Did you have a good first night?" She asked and smiled at me.

"Yeah, for sure," I answered and then pointed my finger at the piece of paper with a raised eyebrow. "So, I just found this."

"Oh yeah, sorry, I always share these when I have a new flatmate. It's important for the place to keep things as they are supposed to be. The other ones really weren't that great but I have such a good feeling about you," she smiled again and it felt so genuine that I had to smile back.

"Oh yeah, me too. If I bring a girl over, I don't have to kick her out at 1 AM though, right?" I joked.

She laughed.

"I am so glad you moved in here, Julius. I don't even think I picked you, the apartment did."

I tried to laugh back politely but it sounded weird and forced.

To be perfectly honest I was sure it was all a big joke at first. The stuff she'd randomly say about the apartment and her weird rules but that girl was dead serious as I'd find out sooner than later. 

One time I left a half-empty cereal bowl on the table before going out and when I came back Clara had thrown it on my bed. I couldn't get the smell of spoiled milk out of my room for days. 

Another time my buddy Matt came over spontaneously and when Clara saw him she acted super nice and even made him a cup of tea.

As Matt told me later he spent the entire next day throwing his guts out. 

Of course, that could have just been a coincidence but she acted ice cold to me after that evening. The good vibes were dead. And these were just a couple of examples of our back and forth.

War had begun. And it got worse and worse. 

I threw a huge house party and Clara somehow managed to convince all my friends that I was a vile, disgusting person. She had this effect on people, her charisma was magically persuasive. 

When my friends started ghosting me, I decided to buy a pair of birds. I named them Julia and Clarus which my flatmate didn't find funny at all. 

A few days later I came back to an open birdcage, a living room full of bird feathers and splatters of blood. 

Maybe I should have left then but I felt the need to confront that psychopath. 

I shouted for Clara but she wasn't home.

I can't even say for sure if I was more angry or scared. Thinking about it now, I should have left right at that moment to never come back. Clara wasn't normal. She looked nice and acted alright in front of strangers but she was dangerous. 

I'm not sure why I didn't leave, maybe I was too angry to think straight. 

So instead of running, I decided to break into her bedroom.

As I mentioned, it was far more whimsical than I'd ever imagined. There was so much stuff and clutter that I wasn't sure what to do next. My initial plan was to trash her room but instead, I decided to go through her stuff to find something she loved and destroy it. Leave a message to her and then fuck off.

I knew that Clara was weird and clearly had anger issues but I still didn't expect to find the things that I did.

There was something satanic about this room.

I found books written in Latin or Celtic or whatever. Papers with anagrams, curses, weird lists. 

All still somewhat fine I guess, but then I found the paintings. Paintings of me. Portraits where she burned my eyes off with a lighter and filled the empty holes with red paint. Another one where my eyes were wide open, the flesh of my nose was decaying and the bones were showing. Another one with dozens of maggots climbing out of my mouth.

It wasn't only the paintings, her room made me feel sick. I felt nauseated and dizzy and for a while, I think I even lost track of time.

My blood was freezing, I couldn't move. For a second, my breathing stopped. And that's when I heard the door shut behind me. 

\--

What happened afterward is a bit blurry in my head. We fought and Clara shouted things I didn't understand. 

I think I pushed her, tried to move her out of the way to get out. She fell and I grabbed the lamp from the table closest to me and threw it at her. It splattered and there was blood but Clara was still moving. I was completely in survival mode not thinking straight, but so was she.

Finally, I managed to pass through and leave her room, I ran through the living room towards the door but when I tried to leave the apartment, I couldn't.

I physically couldn't get out. Something was holding me back. Clara had somehow bound me to this place. She cast a spell on me, that was the only explanation that made sense to me.

I kept trying to leave but it simply wasn't possible. 

"This again? Come on, Julius, I thought we were making progress."

I slowly turned around, scared and confused, to see Clara, standing there, looking completely fine. Not a scratch, no blood. She tilted her head and glanced at me with eyes that seemed more tired than angry.

"What's going on," I whispered. "What did you do to me, you fucking witch?" 

She rolled her eyes.

"I'm not a witch, Julius. Come on, we've had this fight at least once a week for months now. Can you make your memory work, please? This is getting exhausting. I can't deal with this rollercoaster-,"

Clara was interrupted by the sound of birds tweeting. Loudly, as if they were in this apartment. And I could swear it sounded like Julia but she and Clarus died months ago.

Months?

Right, months. 

I started to remember. Our fight about the birds must have been at least 6 months ago. Just around the time, Matt stopped by for the last time. 

Well, the last time he stopped by while I was still alive. 

He came once more after he hadn't heard from me in a while, that's when Clara gave him the letter explaining I had left. 

"Clara, did you kill me?" I whispered. I really couldn't remember for sure.

"No, well, maybe. I hate this, Julius. Do we really need to do this again?"

I nodded.

"Afraid so."

"I killed your birds which I guess was a little over the top. I didn't mean to, I just wanted to let them free but forgot to turn off the ceiling fan and well-," she took a deep breath, "anyway, you came to my room, we had a huge fight, it got out of control. You threw a lamp at me but missed. I threw another one and, well, didn't miss," she mumbled those last words.

The images in my mind were mixing. My memories were not right. Some were of the past when I was alive, some of them were new.

"I forget. All that occult stuff in your room, was that already there?" I carefully asked.

"Some of it. I've always had some interest in it but it really sparked when I realized that you were still here, even after I got rid of your corpse," she shrugged. "You know this was a lot for me too."

I sat down on the ground.

This wasn't new. I just had forgotten. 

Clara had killed me. But I'd tried to do the same to her. When I finally understood what happened, the first time, not now, we made some type of arrangement.

I was never very close with my family anyway and I've lost touch with most friends. They believe I'm traveling somewhere, living a new life, or whatever. 

I'm not sure if other people can see me, I hide the very few times someone rings the bell. This still feels kind of new to me, you know.  

Clara stayed because, one, she can't really let anyone else live with me, I guess. And I suppose she really is curious about how any of this is possible at all. And some part of me hopes she'll find some answers for me. My memory is still a bit hazy and time works weirdly.

So I guess we're kind of stuck with each other. Hopefully not forever.

I mean yeah, my flatmate is a bitch but who wouldn't be if they had to live with a [fucking ghost.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Likeeyedid/)

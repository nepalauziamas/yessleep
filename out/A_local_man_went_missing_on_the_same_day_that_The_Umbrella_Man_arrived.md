The rain was here again. Not that this was unusual, in fact it would be more strange if the ground was dry and the sky was clear. The small town in which I live is notorious for bad weather and torrential downpours. At best, the town would be described as gloomy, and at worst, it would be a place so wet that fish would describe it as 'a bit over the top'.

Apparently the clouds have a mutual agreement that it is the place that they dump their evaporated collection of water onto, with total disregard for the poor, soaked citizens below. 


The fact that it was raining didn't phase me in the slightest. I had come accustomed to it, and maybe I had even started to enjoy it. Well, maybe I just enjoyed the atmosphere of it. I enjoyed the feeling of sitting in my upstairs bedroom, listening to the rain hit the tin roof and watching the small raindrops racing each other down the glass window. I guess when it rains as much as it does here you have no other option but to try and appreciate the wet weather.


So, that's where I was when I first saw him. I was in my bedroom looking out over the quiet street, watching the small pellets of rain fall from the dark clouds above. He was standing across the street, in the pouring rain. He was the only person who was brave enough to venture outside in this weather. You would expect his perfectly ironed black suit to be sopping wet, and it would've been if it weren't for the umbrella that he was clutching in his left hand. 


Normally, it wouldn't be completely out of the ordinary to see a man standing in the rain. It may be a stranded businessman who was thankful he packed an umbrella that morning. There was something different about this man though. Something that caught my eye.

The umbrella he was carrying was much larger than what I would consider normal. It's circumference was similar to those umbrellas that you see at outdoor cafes, rather than the size you leisurely carry around. I guess, with the amount of rain plummeting, it was probably a good idea, if your grip strength allowed it. 


It was still a strange sight to behold and so it kept me staring for a moment. The suited man was facing away from me and so I wasn't able to see his face, but from the back, he appeared completely normal. He stood incredibly still and faced the four bus-sized rainwater tanks that supply the town with most of our water. The rain fell and bounced off the cloth of his almost comically large umbrella. He was bone dry and it appeared as if the umbrella was doing an exceptional job.


I peered through my window at him for a bit, a slight smile forming as I processed the size of his umbrella. I didn't stare for too long, and soon found my attention was drawn to other things. I didn't really think about The Umbrella Man again. Well, that was until I saw him again later that night. 


I was fast asleep when the thunder rolled across the sky and then ended with a large crack above my house. It sounded as if God was using the Earth as a bowling ball and had just rolled us for a strike. It startled me awake and I jumped upright in bed, my heart racing from the sudden jolt of adrenaline I had just received. 

I listened for any more signs of thunder but all I could hear was the sound of the pouring rain. It was hitting the tin roof with a ferocious force that echoed throughout my room. I could also hear the distinct sound of raindrops hitting glass, and I knew that they were battering against the window, like they were trying to get inside. 


I got up out of bed and walked over to my bedroom window to watch the storm that was raging outside. I gazed out of the rain spattered glass and saw the puddles beginning to form in the crevices on the road. I also saw the trees that lined the street blowing wildly in the turbulent wind. It was not the kind of weather that you would voluntarily go out into. Yet, there he was. Outside in the pouring rain and the blistering winds. 


He still stood in the exact same spot as when I had previously seen him, still facing away from me. His umbrella was still raised, shielding him from the elements. I quickly noticed that he wasn't the only person out in the storm. Approaching from his right was another man who was dressed in a bright red rain jacket and a black beanie was stretched over his head. He was struggling to walk forwards against the gale but he was persisting. It looked as if a rope had been tied around his waist and someone was pulling him backwards as he tried to walk.


I watched the man struggle for a moment but soon he was able to plod up next to the man holding the large umbrella. He stood next to him, underneath the umbrella, and planted his feet into the ground so that he wouldn't be blown away. I think he then began to speak. It seemed he had to yell just to be heard above the gushing sound of the wind, but I still could not hear what was being said. I assumed that he was questioning why he was standing so calmly out in the storm.


Without any warning, the oversized umbrella suddenly snapped shut, encasing both men inside a cloth prison. I recoiled in surprise as I had never seen anything like this before. I had witnessed umbrellas blowing inside out in a strong wind, but never close over the person holding them. I continued to stare, wide-eyed and confused, and I watched as the umbrella flew back open again. Back to its original state. The man holding it still stood there, unphased by what had occurred. The other man, the one in the jacket and beanie, was nowhere to be seen. He had vanished. Almost as if the umbrella had chomped down and swallowed him. 


I quickly darted underneath the window and out of view. I knew The Umbrella Man was facing away from me, and probably wasn't aware of my existence, but I couldn't take any chances. I stayed crouched down below the window, my heart beating so loud that it sounded like it could shake the glass in the window.

 I stayed hidden on the ground for what could've been an hour, or maybe only a few minutes. I slowly built up the courage to look out onto the street once more. I slowly raised myself up just enough that I could peer out of the clear glass. The man holding the umbrella was gone. 


I was unsure on what exactly to do next. I contemplated calling the police, but what I was going to tell them; "Help, a man has been eaten by an umbrella". They wouldn't believe it. In fact, I wasn't even sure that I believed it. I tried hard to convince myself that the umbrella had closed and then the man had walked off, and I was unable to see this because the giant wall of fabric was blocking my view. That had to be the explanation of what I'd just witnessed. 


That's what I tried to convince myself of anyway. I attempted to push the sight of The Umbrella Man out of my head and I went back over to my bed and hopped in. I spent the next few hours tossing and turning, unable to get much sleep at all. I think I must've dozed off for a moment though because I remember being plagued by a strange dream.


I dreamt that The Umbrella Man was floating through the sky, all the while still clasping onto his umbrella. He looked a lot like Mary Poppins as he drifted through the sky on the winds. He flew past mountains with water traversing it's way down the slopes, and he soared past a hot desert with dirt that was cracking in the unforgiving heat. 


I awoke from the dream and was restless for the remainder of the night. I got up out of bed early that morning, as it seemed to be a better use of my time than to just stay laying on the mattress. I slowly paced over to the window and looked out over to the spot where he was standing last night. 

The empty street stared back at me and this did bring me some level of comfort. The weather today was a lot nicer than it had been the day before. I was actually able to see some sunlight, which was a very rare occurrence, and any sign of rain had since dried up.


I decided that I would venture out onto the street and try to discern exactly what it was the man with the umbrella had been staring at for most of the previous day. I left my house, and due to the warm weather, I grabbed a bottle of water on the way out. I walked out and let the sunshine soak into me for a second and then crossed over the street.

 No puddle was left on the ground, which did strike me as odd, as the small pools of water couldn't have evaporated that quickly. I ignored it, and continued walking along the desiccated pavement. I quickly moved into the spot that The Umbrella Man had been standing in and looked out in the same direction, to gain an insight of what he was staring at. 


I only looked out over the four gigantic water tanks and the few houses that stretched out behind them for a moment or two. My eye was then drawn to something else. Something bright red was stumbling towards me. The same bright red colour that I had seen the previous night on the man's jacket. The exact same man, beanie and all, was now hobbling towards me. He seemed like he was slightly wet and was leaving a trail of small water droplets behind him. 


I was shocked to see this man again, but the fact was, I was seeing him again, which meant that he was safe. A wave of relief washed over me, quickly followed by a bigger wave of embarrassment because a part of me had believed he was devoured by an umbrella. I watched as he continued to amble closer towards me, and the closer he got, the stronger the feeling grew that something wasn't quite right. 


He appeared to be inaudibly muttering to himself and looked lost and disoriented. I also came to realise that he wasn't just damp, but absolutely soaked in water. He was completely drenched from head to toe. His clothes were hanging low from the weight of the liquid that was soaked into them, and his shoes squelched with every step he took. I took a step closer to him, to make sure that he was okay, and then I noticed the strange lumps on his skin. 


Covering all visible flesh, a small, squishy bump was present, that looked a bit like blisters filled with fluid. I recoiled slightly at the sight, but my concern for the man grew. He took another sloshy step towards me, so that now he was directly in front of me. I looked at him, both worried and slightly sickened by the strange lumps, and I managed to ask him if he was okay. 


"Is everything alright, Sir?", I asked him whilst trying to look into his eyes rather than at his skin. 


He stood for a moment, breathing heavily and looking down towards the ground. He was still muttering quietly to himself, but when I spoke to him, his muttering grew louder. 


"So….dry. So….thirsty", he muttered, not directly to me, but just to himself, "So….dry. So...thirsty". 


I was confused at first. He was drenched in water, so how was he dry and thirsty? It didn't make sense. I continued to watch him and he just continued to mutter the same phrase over and over again.


"So… dry. So….thirsty. So… dry. So...thirsty".


His murmuring was beginning to scare me. I think it was the way that he was staring at the ground but his eyes almost seemed glazed over and like he wasn't aware of who or where he was. I didn't want to just walk away from him though, as it was clear that he needed help. I then remembered the drink bottle that I had grabbed before I left the house. With shaking hands, I lifted the bottle up towards him, to show him that I had what he so desperately needed. 


Without looking up at me, he snatched the bottle from my quivering hand and popped the lid open in one swift movement. I then watched on as he began to pour the water onto his hand, instead of into his mouth. My confusion of this act quickly changed into horror as the water started to bubble and then slowly absorb into his skin. The small blister-like lumps on his hand started to grow as the water soaked into his flesh. His hand swelled up with the newly added moisture, and the lumps became pulpier and more squishy. 


I jumped backwards at the sight, nauseated by what I saw. I was also scared by what was occurring. Clearly, something had happened the previous night. Something The Umbrella Man had done had affected this man in some profound way. Maybe I wasn't crazy to believe that something dark was happening. Something I don't think I was supposed to witness. 


I staggered backwards, my heart racing and, instead of liquid being absorbed into me, it was leaking out in the form of sweat along my forehead. I was in a state of panic. I didn't know whether to run away, or to try and help the man from his unnatural state of being. My mind was still in the process of deciding when I heard another squelching sound from behind. I turned around sharply and saw another man stumbling towards me. He too was drenched in water and was muttering to himself. Small, fleshy mounds also covered his entire body. 


My brain then made its decision. It was time to run.

This happened to me and my friend about 6 years ago.

We saw that there was a circus nearby. Me (15) and my friend (14) decided to wait until the circus closes and mess around there. The circus closed at 10pm. So we decided to stay at my friends house because he lived only 1 mile down from where the circus is.

Around 10 me and my friend sneaked out the house through his window and hopped on our bikes and left. We saw that the last few people/workers there were leaving. So, we snuck through the back fence and hid behind the funnel cake truck. 

It had been about 15 minutes when we could hear some person walking right behind us. So, not wanting to get caught, we ran and hid behind a ride. 

We saw about two men dressed as clowns walk into the circus tent. Me and my friend, being stupid kids, got curious, and quietly ran over to the entrance and peeked inside.

I thought I could  hear muffled screams but my friend couldn’t. So, I didn’t think anything of it. We walked inside the tent and saw the two men standing in the middle talking to each other. Me and my friend decided to get closer to hear what they were talking about. We heard a bit about shows and losing their noses when suddenly my friend says; “Uh, we work here”

I turn around to find a man dressed head to toe in a clown costume. “You work here? I see. But you look awfully young, but that’s even better.” Or something along the lines of that. Me and my friend just stared at each other. What did he mean by ‘being young is better.’ We then turn around to find the same two men dressed as clowns that were in the middle, right behind us. “Here, could you hold my nose?” says the clown. My friend takes his nose and we both bolt right out of there. We hoped the gate and took off on our bikes. I looked back to see the clown standing at the front gate looking at us. 

We biked for what felt like 8 hours. We talked about what happened. Then we saw a red truck parked in front of us. The door suddenly swung open and knocked my friend of his bike. I managed to dodge it and turned around to see the clown. 
“Give me my nose back. Or I will take yours!” followed by a screeching laugh. My friend got up and ran and hoped on my bike. The clown following after us. “Give it back! Or I will take yours!” he kept on chanting. Then the two clowns that were in the middle of the tent, pulled my friend of my bike and dragged him to the red truck and threw him inside. The then got into the truck and sped off.

I biked to my friends house and told his parents everything. They then called the police. 

A few days later he was found in the woods headless with his nose chopped off.

The white figure

The white figure

I would like to start off with some background.My name is Daniel.My parents are divorced.My mum lives in the capital of Bulgaria,and my dad lives in a house about 4 kilometers from the nearest village,surrounded by a big field.Me and my dad live on the 2nd floor,and my grandparents on the 1st floor.Its important to know that my dad works until 23:00

It was a normal weekend,I was staying up late,playing video games at my dad's with some online friends.(it was about 10PM)I play on a Playstation 4 

I just finished a game of call of duty modern warfare and I suddenly had that feeling to look out the left window of my room.

I saw a white,long arm,slowly going down with some red liquid on it,with me believing in monsters I was just hoping it wasn't blood.

I closed my eyes and opened them again,thinking I was just hallucinating thinking that it was just because of me being tired.

The blood was still there.

I told my friends that I would be hopping off as I need to check up on something,left the party,shut down the Playstation and turned off the TV

I decided to go down hoping to find my grandparents all well watching TV or sleeping.

I found a broken window,with a bit of blood on them.I was too scared to go check out.

Then I heard a blood curdling scream.I sprinted to the window realizing that my 8 year old cousin sleeps in the same room as my grandparents(My uncle leaves him at my grandparent's and goes for work)as he is scared of sleeping alone.

I sprinted towards the window.Hoping for the best about my grandparents and my little cousin

I stood frozen in fear to find what was left of my grandparents on the floor and my little cousin's lifeless body laying on his bed as this white figure-ish thing was digging into his stomach.

It had small holes all over his body,just like the ones on the moon,it's torso was small,about 2-3 foot,but it's limbs we're about 4-5 foot long.It was covered in blood.

It immediately heard me,it slowly started turning around as he removed one of my cousin's limbs with ease.

It's face had this huge grin,he was smiling with his bloody teeth easily visible.its grin reached both of his ears.

I was frozen in fear.It slowly started coming towards me.I  started running to the stairs,opened the door to the 2nd floor and slammed the door.I hid in my dad's room immediately.

By the time I got to the room it had already broken through one of the windows.Luckily my dad keeps his marksman rifle on the top of his wardrobe(he is an ex military).The only problem is that the rounds for it are in the kitchen.

Luckily he always keeps a mag inside the gun in case of an emergency.i am currently hiding in a corner holding the rifle,aiming at the door.The time is 22:20 if you see this message please send help immediately!

Me and my friends did some weird Easter egg I found on an odd video that got taken down about 1 hour after it was posted,I have a feeling that the whole thing could have happened because of it.

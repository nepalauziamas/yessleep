Hello again. Bless you!

&#x200B;

I am father George Baka, the exorcist from Romania. I have shared my first story a few days, the first of several where I recount from my experience. To see how am I and the first story, here you go

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Now, lets get own with it. The ladies seemed really interested to find out more of my experience. I told them: ”You know, we have met Christ in Holy Liturgy, not very long ago. I think we should focus more on Him and less of the evil ones.” ”Please, father, tell us what happened in those nights you spent sleeping in that graveyard. Was it worse then the first story?” asked Ruxandra. I looked at both of them and answered: ”Well, perhaps this is for your own benefit. And it is in line with the first story, as I see it.” Helena was looking with her whitish undead-like eyes at me a little hungry of what I was about to say. Fortunately, she was not hungry of blood or anything like that, her vampire needs seemed to be in check for now, the late summer night in the graveyard seemed peaceful so I decided to tell the story to my two spiritual daughters. I took a small sip of wine and went on with the story.

&#x200B;

Some people may say that sleeping the night in a rural graveyard may be, regardless of any potential scares, discomforting physically. I admit it is pretty discomforting but, as people are able to go on field trips or on expeditions in nature or remote areas, this would not be very different from that. I was pretty young back then, it was summer, not a big deal. Especially when the sky was clear, sleep was even pretty peaceful and refreshing. The church and the parish house were close, in case of necessity. I went on for a new nights pretty well, like I was in a vacation, almost.

&#x200B;

Until one night, when I just fell asleep, I started to hear it. Like a beating sound, coming from underground. It was faint, at first. I was a little startled, when I first awake, I needed a few seconds to realize what was going on. It came from underneath an old grave, it had an old stone cross, the name was barely visible anymore. I lay down to the grave and listen. It became stronger, and I started to hear a muffled voice coming from the grave: ”Help me! Have mercy on me, Christians! They beat me! Help me, please...!” The voice stopped, but the beating sound continued. Each beat brought a small vibration to the soil. I started to pray and continued to listen. Soon, I heard the muffled, distorted voice: ”Help me, please! They do not stop, they beat me, they are merciless!” Other weird sounds, connected to ground vibrations were heard. As I remembered from the previous experience, things could escalate, I felt the need to run to the parish house or to church, but I forced myself to continue listening. It went on, weird sounds, especially beating sounds, connected to vibrations in the ground and, from time to time, those cries for help. At some point, the voice said: ”They beat me! The demons beat me!”

&#x200B;

My blood went cold when I heard it. Unlike the previous story, this was clearly a demonic work. What I heard what either the voice of the dead, suffering from demons, either demons playing a trick on me. Either way, there were demons. I was not sure what to do. I looked up at the name on the cross and went home. I could not sleep that night anymore, still shaken, more or less, so I decided to perform Holy Liturgy and call the name of the deceased there, on Proscomidia. I performed a Parastas service, with all the untying from there, then I took a nap and woke up late that afternoon. My wife was, of course, worried on me, especially since she did not liked my new habit of sleep and she remembered very well, yet, that night where the ghosts caught up on me. I tried to conform her as I could, but I said to myself: ”I am a priest of Christ. I am yoked to His yoke, to His flock. It is my duty to continue.”

&#x200B;

I decided to go on the next night in there, to see if the phenomenon has stopped. I laid down next to the grave, and waited. I started a series of prayers, not just for the deceased, but for me as well as I did not knew what to expect. I think it was close to midnight, when I felt it, a small tremble, from underneath. It was clear that untying I performed was not enough. Both priests and bishops have the ability Christ gave the Holy Apostles to release, to unty, not just the absolution, but pledges, bonds or curses. The release from the bishop is stronger then the one performed by a priest. There are dead people who are not just damned, meaning they are in hell, but they have certain curses. Some curses are the result of certain sins, they can be laid upon by parents, priests or bishops, or by apostasy. Some bonds can be untied only by a bishop.

&#x200B;

At this point, I was not sure if this was just demonic deceit, if this was a soul who needed help. So, I went to my confessor and told him the situation, asking for his advice. He told me that it is dangerous what I do, to sleep in the graveyard, as demons can bring all sort of things upon me, especially deceit, but things even worse are possible. He advised me to read the Exorcism Prayers of Saint Basil the Great and of John Chrysostom, in order to repel the work of evil spirits. I followed his advice that evening, and I slept in my bed afterwards, not in the graveyard. Yet, I still felt bothered that night, I could not sleep. I looked at the clock, midnight was close, I tried one last time to sleep. My wife was already asleep by now.

&#x200B;

The clock stroke midnight. At first, it started to feel something very faint, like you feel when a heavy vehicle passes near a small building, like a tremble. I did not paid much attention at first, but it kept going. There was no way a vehicle could cause this, perhaps is there was a long column of heavy trucks. I got up looked at the window, nothing was visible on the road, I listened, it did not sound like a truck column to be on any road in the vicinity. Or train. Sometimes, Romania is being hit by earthquakes, most of them are weak, but this thing lasted already several minutes, longer then any earthquake. I went back to bed and listened, as I had a hunch. Indeed, it felt like coming from underground. I put my ear on the floor and there I could feel it even more. I said fast a prayer, but I did not wake my wife, not to scare her. I got dressed and prayed on what to do next. I decided to go to the graveyard again.

&#x200B;

The rumble was getting stronger as I got closer to the grave. It was the same as in the other night, but stronger. The voice muffled ”Help me, fellow Christians, help me! Woe to who does not confess his sins at the Sacrament of Confession!” The vibration caused a tremble in my heart and mind, a combination of fear and something else, I could not name it at the moment, but it was definitely negative, like my living, human soul, found it hard to endure. I went back home pretty fast, as I knew what I had to do next: go to the bishop.

&#x200B;

The next day, I went to the bishop and told him. At first, he looked a bit skeptic, and his attitude was similar to that of my confessor: ”Sleeping in the graveyard, besides being dangerous, will also make people say the priest is crazy. And you know pretty well what we are facing from the authorities. If you get a reputation of a madman, some people in power could be, very well, stirred up against you.” ”Your grace,”I replied, ”I did what I had to do, as a priest, so far. Perhaps a Sărindar performed at a monastery would work, as for me it would be already pretty hard to perform Holy Liturgy for 40 days in a row. I gave one for that man in the same day, at three monasteries. After it is finished, things could get quiet, but probably not. We know from history that something similar has happened before, and how it was handled: a bishop came and unbounded the deceased.”

&#x200B;

His grace looked at me a little frowning and answered: ”If it is anything in there, you may have been the one stirring it up, with your nights in the graveyard. Things are already difficult as they are, from the government, from the county I get many scolds almost ceaselessly. One scandal would be enough for them to do many of the things we know very well they are capable of, like forcing you out. Under a pretext.” ”With all the respect, your grace, one thing I shall tell you: If we refuse to help this soul, you shall be responsible for him. Not me.” He looked at me frowning for a few seconds, he thought about it, then he finally answered: ”I tell you what... If you manage to get the approval for exhumation, I shall come and do it, as it was done in the Pidalion recorded case. If not, the best I can do it is to try some unbound from the here. But be very careful on what you do, how you do it, you know that they can also find a way to get you what, if they want it.” ”I know it, very well, your grace, thank you.”

&#x200B;

I started searching for approvals in the same day. First, I tried to find if he has any living relatives. I could find none. This happened during the whole day. I finally came out home, and went to sleep exhausted. This time, I fell asleep pretty easy. But it did not take long, as I woke up. The rumble again in ground. My wife woke up as well this time, she was scarred, I embraced her and tried to calm her down. I told her what was going on. A little irritated, she said: ”You stirred all this up. You are responsible. Now who knows what will happen to us?” ”You may be right.” I admitted. ”But no way back now. Perhaps this was the work of God to save a soul. Or perhaps demons attack me, for what I do. They shall never be unnecessary provoked. Forgive me.” I got up and wanted to get dressed. ”Do not leave me alone, please...” she said. I gave a sigh: ”I shall not leave you. But I least I need to look from the door frame to the graveyard, I have a feeling. If you want, stay behind me, but do not look.”

&#x200B;

I surprised even myself by telling her not to look. Unmasked demons can be very harmful at sight, as most people will get mad just by seeing one. Something in mind told me I could very well see something like that, this came like a sudden and faint thought, but the thought was right. As we came to the door, she stayed behind, as I opened the door carefully. This time, things felt different, I could hear the voice, this time not muffled, but distorted in a different way, shouting in a deep despair: ”Help me! Help me, please!” I could see the dead man running on the alleys of the graveyard. He was coming towards us. He was consumed, like the ghosts I have seen before, but he looked different. He looked black, like deep burned, he had a long beard, it looked like a thicket, it covered most of his torso, that looked inflated in a very unnatural way (unnatural for a living person, anyway) and, as he reached his arms towards me, I saw he had his fingernails grown long and white, like sickles. From his eyes it came out like a white fluid, similar to molten cheese, that covered partially his beard. All this I have noticed in a second, the most. He shouted at me with a piercing, unearthly voice: ”Help me, father!” It sounded so un-human and other-worldly, that I trembled. My wife screamed and ran inside the house. And then I saw them. There were two of them, behind him.

&#x200B;

Two great shadows, that held inside them a shape. They had arms, and a head, but no face was clear. At least not at the moment. They were larger then the man, and they had something in one arm, I do not know how to describe it, like a cudgel or something, and in the other some sort of whip. It looked on fire, but black at the same time. I am glad I could not distinguish any face on them, as I saw them only a split of a second, then closed my eyes and turned around. My mind was already close to overwhelming but, thanks to God, I was able to close the eyes not a moment too late. I managed to get inside, close the door and locked it. My dear wife was on the floor, crumbled and screaming. I took her in arms and started praying. She followed me, then I told her we should say the Prayer of the Heart, ceaselessly: ”Lord Jesus Christ, Son of God, have mercy on me, the sinner!” We both went on for God knows how long, there were probably hours, like this, crumbled on the floor, as the tremble was heard from outside. They did not seemed to be coming to close, probably sticking to the graveyard, but we could easily realize the demons hit the man both with the cudgels and the whip. A very small piece of Hell has come to Earth.

&#x200B;

Praying gave us some peace, like an endurance, after a while. The few moments I made visual contact with the shapes made me feel somewhat unreal, disconnected to the world, and it stayed so, as we kept feeling their presence. It was not something very new to me, but that is a different story. Finally, around 2 am, it stopped. We have not slept the rest of the night, being shaken, especially my wife. As morning came as I looked into her eyes and felt her traumatized soul, guild started to get heavier and heavier, and I knew I had get it finished, as fast as possible.

&#x200B;

The air in the village looked different. Less people on the streets. The few ones I met looked at me with a strange look, one man looked a little angry, two old women started to whisper to each other when they saw me, as they kept going. Most likely at least some caught an eye or felt that something happened last night, and they told the rest. Getting the legal approval for exhumation was difficult and time consuming, so I decided for a shortcut.

&#x200B;

I went to the mayor. A middle aged man, a little chubby, looked a little irritated to open his door to me. Next to him sat the head of the police station (We shall call him the sheriff, in order to keep things easier, as this term, is probably, the most fit.) The sheriff was close in age to the mayor, only much thinner, and wearing short mustache. Both of them sat down, they greeted me minimally, without standing up and shake hands, only with some grunt word. They had a bottle of tzuika on the desk, and two glasses. It was well known that the two were drinking buddies for a long time.

&#x200B;

”I think you already heard about last night.”, I started. ”I am sure some people from around the village told you something.” He sat on his chair, looking moresely at me: ”It seems to me, father, you want trouble. Such a quiet little village we had here, before you came. But lets keep it short: What do you want?” I went to the point: ”We have a cursed dead in the graveyard, as it seems. We need to unbound the curse. For his sake, at first, but for the sake of the village as well. Things could escalate. His grace agreed to came here and do the unbound, if the exhumation is granted.” He looked at me with anger he barely contained: ”What on Earth are talking about? For the sake of some delirium caused by superstitions? I am starting to get sick of your deeds. Perhaps you need some psychiatric help.”

&#x200B;

Now, that was nothing I did not expect from him.  I looked at the sheriff, who started: ”You know very well that this will take a long time. And it get really messy. Wouldn„t it be better for anyone just to cool of and let it be?” ”Things will not cool of, I do not expect you to understand that.” His look became a little more hateful: ”Do not worry, father. If anything happens, I shall take care of it. You know it. I am the law in here. This is my responsibility. Any wrong doers shall be arrested.” I knew what he meant, he was threatening me not to perform the exhumation on my own. In my mind, that seemed like an option, but the bishop would not come to perform the service if exhumation happened like this.

&#x200B;

”You know, father”, said the mayor, ”your responsibility is the church, the services, confessions. Charity. Why wouldn„t just do those and leave us handle the rest? The rest that it is our responsibility.” I looked at him and kept myself not to burst, as it would have been pointless, anyway, so I answered: ”If I am the priest, this is my responsibility. More then your own.” They both looked at me with hatred. The mayor answered, hardly keeping his calm: ”Now, please excuse us, father. We have work to do. A lot of work.” As he said that, he took the bottle of tzuika and poured another shot in both glasses.

&#x200B;

I left the building in haste, having another idea in my mind. The sheriff came out, after me, and shouted: ”Father! One last word...” I stopped and waited for him. He reached me and started: ”If anything happens, I shall take care of it. Me. I hope is it clear.” He grabbed my shoulder. ”You know,” I answered calmly, ”Physical violence against a priest brings a curse on a layman. Just to let you know.” He let his hand down, as I left: ”Have a nice day.”

&#x200B;

I spent my next hours going to people and explained them what is going on. I decided to perform the Holy Liturgy that night, at midnight, calling the soul of the dead man at Proscomidia, in case his soul was present in all this and this was not just a demonic work altogether. I advised people to take part in the Holy Liturgy, to pray for safety and for releasing of all this. Some were scarred, some startled, some irritated. I advised them that, if they do not want to come, to stay indoors, pray and do no look at anything they shall see in the graveyard, streets or outside in general. And tell everybody of this.

&#x200B;

As I reached home, I tried to confort my wife and take a rest, to prepare for the night to come. She manage to sleep a bit, I could not. As darkness fell, we went to the church. We started with the Paraklesis of the Mother of God and the Akathist of our Lord Jesus Christ. Towards the end of the akathist, the sheriff entered the church, looked at us with contempt, as he kept his hand on the gun, then left. Only a few people were present. 

&#x200B;

We started The Liturgy with the Proscomidia, I called the named of the dead man in question alongside other deceased. People were scared, I tried to keep their spirits up. As we started The Liturgy, sound started to be head outside the church. Not like thumbing, like before, but like something were moving around the church. Some old women started to cry, others did their best to keep them down. Some dogs started to howl around, like a wind was outside. The light from the street lights got dimmer, like something passing in front of the light bulbs. I felt like something was peeking my heart, but I called the name of The Lord and was able to continue. All went pretty normal until the time of the reading of the Gospel, when I heard some gun shots, not very close, not very far, on the streets. People stayed close to the Holy Altar, including my wife, poor her...

&#x200B;

Weird sounds and things on the outside, not on the inside, were still heard, but we managed to pull it through, and reached the end of the Liturgy. I said the exorcism prayers of Saint Basil the Great and of Saint John Chrysostom for the whole village, and we sat. 

&#x200B;

After this, I told the people that it is probably safe to leave the church, as it was beyond 2 am, when they manifestation usually stopped. Most of them refused, so we camped in the church, so to say, on the ground and on the lateral chairs. Some tried to sleep, some even succeeded. My wife fell asleep in my arms. She was a treasure of a woman, I miss her so much, you can not imagine... She felt safe in my arms.

&#x200B;

Morning came, eventually, and we were out. The village, the streets did not looked much different. After leaving my wife at home, to rest, I went to the village hall, to see what happened during the night on the streets. I saw the sheriff, close to a wooden lamppost, and he kept hitting his head on the wood. I went to him, to see if he was ok, he turned his face to me, the face of a madman, and he stuttered some sound I could not comprehend, they were not words. He was broken, I felt pity on him, as I tried to get him to the doctor. The deputy came in a few minutes, shaken on his own, and started:

&#x200B;

”I am sorry we did not believed you, father, we were out...Boss wanted have our guns to stop the hooligans he thought will be on the move, but they came... Those black things. As I saw them, I ran away, I remembered what you said about not looking at them. But he did looked. Not just that, but he fired the gun at them. They did something to him, I do not know why.” I looked with sadness, perhaps some unbound prayers shall help him, before being committed to psychiatry. But other things were urgent. I went to the mayors house. As I knocked at the door, I heard him come out and opened the door. He was shaken, indeed, but not like the sheriff.”

&#x200B;

”Forgive me, father, for all... I was asleep at night, when I heard knocks at my door. I ignored them at first but they got stronger and stronger. I decided to get and open the door, to silence the punk who I believed was there, I opened it, and I saw the dead man. Black, inflated, with that thick beard, his white tears and those long, fingernails. He screamed at me, making the flesh on my bones to tremble: ”Why don„t you want to help me? Look at me! Woe to the one who does not confess their sins at the Sacrament of Confession!” I was breathing heavily already now, as he place his right hand with those fingernails on my head, as I started to cry, then he added: ”Help me and change your ways! Otherwise you will end up like me, or worse.” He starred in my eyes, as I was shaking violently, then he let go and went to the streets again. I closed the door and have not slept at all. Please, father, call the bishop, call his grace to put an end to all. We shall dig him up today. No other night shall be allowed to pass!”

&#x200B;

The bishop was called, he came, as the grave was being dug up. I do not know if the dead man came with his body from the grave or only his spirit was visible. It seemed to have been him, though, because, when exhumed, his dead body looked very much like we saw him, only that he was inert, like a corpse, not like a living person. We took the body in the church, but we covered it, to keep people from getting frightened, a woman passed away when she saw it. I told people to pray for his soul. We did what he had to do,  the unbound, then the Parastas, then buried him back. That man must have had some great sins that he refused to confess. 

&#x200B;

Next night was peaceful. Nothing. Soon, things got back to normal. We had a new sheriff and a new mayor. The old mayor repented and became close to the church. The old sheriff had some unbound on him, but he was still admitted in psychiatry. He has some lucid periods, but also periods when he looses it, screams and he is placed into a straitjacket.

&#x200B;

A few years later, I heard that another exhumation was performed. The body was already decayed to a skeleton. The curse was lifted.

&#x200B;

You see, bodies get undecayed for several reasons. There are natural reasons, like the soil or the excessive embalming before funeral. Some are cursed due to sins, like this man. Some have even a greater curse, like those who fall under anathema, for apostasy. And some are Saints.”

&#x200B;

Night was getting very late. We finished the food, took one last glass of wine and proposed to get to sleep. Helena looked at her empty glass and she was thinking at something.  Ruxandra smiled: ”When you look at the empty glass, you are getting creative. I know you.” Helena looked at Ruxandra and smiled: ”I was. I was thinking that this sweet wine could become more flavored with some saffron, perhaps. Or some other combination.” 

&#x200B;

”Ladies, ” I said, ”shall we go to sleep?” ”You can go to sleep, father.” answered Ruxandra. We need to get back to Bucharest. I go to work, Helena needs her coffin, in her house. This is why I refused to drink alcohol, to be able to drive.” I agreed and blessed them goodbye.

&#x200B;

Next Wednesday night I drove Helena myself. But that is a story for another time. 

&#x200B;

Bless you!

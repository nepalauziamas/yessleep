I wake up every morning getting ready for school besides the weekends so when it came to be Friday afternoons I would be so happy that I had to bottle it up at the end of the school day waiting for the bus. On my way to my house from the bus stop after my long day I always seemed to look behind my shoulder to see the faces of gentrifiers looking around the street and making them selves at home at the new outdoor restaurant near my home and I just keep walking home ignoring them as they act like im an animal. 

When I finally arrive at home I clean what I have to clean and then usually eat right after but… there seemed to be no food, my mom had been gone all week since she had left to a business trip and I asked my sisters what would I eat if there was no food - sister ( Ill give u some money and if you really need to eat right now then you can go grab something at the gas station ). 

We lived half a mile away from a gas station and I would usually always go there for a snack but this time I waited until 8pm to get something to eat, just as I left my house there seemed to be a heavy breeze come towards me when I shut my door and I got goosebumps just looking down at the  restaurant that was just built be completely quiet and empty. I felt- well it felt unsettling and I just kept walking down the street because I wouldn’t let my own fears take over my ability to walk over to the gas station and grab something to feed myself when I passed the restaurant and the old car sales place next to it, It just seemed to get even darker and the street lights became more dim the closer I came to the gas station with my fear growing more and more and feeling like tucking my feet into my non existent blanket for safety ; I made it to the destination but it was closed. _____________________ 

My heart dropped at a man walking in a drunken matter towards me from the shadows whispering “the wind blows but the devil never shows” I started walking backwards with my phone in hand ready to call 9-1-1 but just as I did the man disappeared before my eyes and I ran back home never speaking about this moment to anybody and then heading to the living room and laying down on the couch.

Opening my eyes I look up to dee the complete darkness in my house snd checking my phone to see it was past midnight as I set my phone down I looked to the window next to the ac and that very moment I was left with no words and seeing that the man from before was at my window staring at me- What had really made me cry was wondering how long he had been watching me sleep and that he had followed me home for 15mind straight but the tears really came out when he disappeared again. I never know if he watches me come home or if he watches me sleep. I never go out past dark again

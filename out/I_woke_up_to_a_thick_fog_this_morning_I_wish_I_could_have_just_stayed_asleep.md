 

“Wake up Thomas!” my roommate Jason exclaimed as he slapped me on my shoulder. “You need to see this.”

Jason and I work for the same company here in town and we both started around the same time. Since we were both relatively new to the town we were both looking for a place to live so we decided to rent out a place together since it would be cheaper. Jason is a pretty cool guy and has become a good friend over the 2 years we have spent living together. 

“This better be important, you know I had a late night.” I said with a slightly agitated tone.

I looked up and saw Jason looking out the window with a look of confusion painted on his face. I rolled off the couch and slowly made my way over to see what had him all worked up. When I finally reached the window I looked at the street and all I could see was this red tinged fog.

I looked over at Jason, “You woke me up because of a little fog.” I said.

“C’mon man don’t you think this looks different from ordinary fog.” he said as he looked at me while pointing out the window. “There is just something about it that just doesn’t sit right with me.”

I couldn’t say I don’t agree with him there, there was something a little off about it. It looked almost milky it was so thick and the red hue didn't seem normal. We sat and talked about it a little more discussing what we thought could have caused this when my other roommate Edmund came out from his room. 

“What’s up with the fog outside?” he asked. Me and Jason both looked at him and shrugged our shoulders.

“We have been trying to figure that out ourselves.” I told him.

Edmund is a recent addition to our house. He works across the street from where me and Jason do and we met one night at a local bar in town. He said he was looking for a new place to live since the people he was moved in with were all moving away. We have an extra room in our house that does nothing but collect dust so we offered it to him and he accepted. We all get along pretty well, we obviously have arguments here and there which is usual for roommates. The usual little things like dishes and taking our trash, but I will say I consider both of them some of the best friends I have.

I decided to try to check my phone to see what was going on when I noticed that I had service, but nothing was loading. I tried to call my parents who live about an hour away and it wouldn’t connect. “Hey guys,” I said, “Is yall’s phones working, mine isn’t letting me send messages and nothing is loading.” They both fumbled around in their pockets and pulled out their phones to try. After a moment they looked up and we exchanged concerned looks with each other. 

“Nah man,” Edmund exclaimed, “It’s not working for me either.”

Just then I looked out the window to the street and noticed that some of our neighbors were walking around in the street. “You guys want to go see what the neighbors think?” I asked and they shook their heads in agreement.

After throwing on a coat and grabbing a flashlight just in case, me, Jason and Edmund headed out into the street. In the fog we only had clear sight for about 25 or 30 yards before we had trouble seeing so we stayed pretty close together to not lose sight of each other. As we were walking we came across our neighbor Mr. Randolph. He is an older man probably in his late 60’s who has been my neighbor since moving to this town 2 years ago. He is a nice guy who will help anyone out  if they need it.

“What do you boys think of this?” Mr. Randolph exclaimed in that worn out raspy voice he has. 

“We were hoping you could tell us,” I said “Have you talked to anyone who has an idea of what’s going on?”

Mr. Randolph while scratching his wiry beard said, “I was about to head over to the police station if you boys want to tag along.” 

We all followed Mr. Randolph to the police station which is about a 15 minute walk from our house. We ran into a few other people along the way and none of them had any idea what was going on either. Some people decided to come with us so we had a pretty big group with us when we arrived at the station. We realized when we got there that a lot of people had the same idea as us. There was a large crowd out in front of the police station and the town's small police force was out front trying to calm everyone down.

As we got close enough to see what was going on the sheriff pulled out a megaphone. Sheriff Daily is a man who looks in his late 50s with black hair and a beard. He is no small man to say the least, he has got to be around 6’ 2 and 250 pounds. He looks very intimidating, but pretty much everyone in our town knows the sheriff and respects him. So when he grabs the megaphone and tells the crowd to settle down the crowd goes silent almost immediately. 

“Listen up everyone,” Sheriff Daily announced “We know just about as much as you do about this situation. We’ve been trying to contact other departments outside of town but we are having trouble getting messages out.”

I looked over at my friends who looked back with a worried expression. “What’s going on dude?” Edmund exclaimed with a worried expression. 

“So listen up everybody!” Sheriff Daily began “If anyone has any issues come and report it to us immediately, for now we are going to do all we can to help.” With that he puts the microphone down and is immediately surrounded by people asking questions.

“So what you boys think?” Mr. Randolph asked.

“I honestly don’t know, what about you guys?” I said as I turned to my friends.

“Well I am starving right now and we barely have any food at home so let's go hit up the convenience store.” Jason exclaimed.

“Sounds good to me, I could go for some lunch.” I responded, I was getting pretty hungry myself due to missing out on breakfast this morning.

Mr. Randolph looked at us, “Well you boys have fun, I am gonna stay here at the station for a while.”

“Let us know if you hear anything” I said to him and he nodded.

The three of us set off to find something to eat. There were a lot of people at the convenience store but it wasn't that crowded. I assumed that most everyone went to the supermarket we have in town. After grabbing enough food and water to last a day or two we headed back to our house. On the way home one side of the road there is a pretty dense thicket of trees and I swear I could feel eyes looking at me from somewhere within them. I told my friends and they just shrugged it off, but we did pick up the pace a little bit. 

We got home around 2 pm and made some lunch which consisted of cup noodles and ham sandwiches. None of us are chefs by any means. I was looking out the window every once in a while to check and see if anything had changed but every time I was met with the same thick fog with the unnatural red coloring to it. You can’t really tell what time of day it is by looking out because the sun barely penetrates through the stuff it's so dense. After that I lounged around for a little while and decided to check my watch which told me it was coming up on 5 o’clock.

I was sitting at the dining room table when there was a knock at the door. I opened it to find Mr. Randolph who looked pretty shaken. “What’s up Mr. Randolph, you alright?” I asked. He looked around inside my house for a moment, “I’ve heard some news from down at the station, mind if I sit down for a minute?” he responds. “Of course, come on in.” I said, a little uneasy.

Edmund and Jason both came and took a seat on the couch as me and Mr. Randolph each grabbed a recliner. 

“Well…” he began, “A few deputies at the station decided to try and ride out of town to see if it was like this in the town over.” I looked over at him, “Well did they say anything?” I asked. “They came back not 15 minutes later as pale as a sheet.” Mr. Randolph responded, “They said that when they got to the road that leads out of town it was completely swallowed up by the forest. It was as if it was never there in the first place.”

“What!” Jason said standing up from his seat, “You’re not just playing with us are you Mr. Randolph? There is no way trees could overtake a road in one night!” 

“I wish I was joking with you boys,” he said, “The police are trying to calm the people and are telling everyone to go home and stay indoors tonight. I recommend you all do the same.”

I looked at Jason and Edmund who were visibly distraught by this, “Okay guys it’s fine the police will figure something out and we will sort out this mess.” I said not believing the words that were coming out of my own mouth. 

Mr. Randolph stands up and heads for the door, “You boys stay safe, I am right next door if you need anything.” I stand up and walk over to the door, “Thanks Mr. Randolph, the same goes for you.” I said while shutting the door behind him. I turned and looked at my friends who all looked like they had just seen a ghost and I was probably no different.

“Guys,” Edmund exclaimed, “So what’s the plan? I am sort of freaking out right now.” I took a look outside, still reminded of the situation at hand. “I think just to be safe we should lock the house down the best we can before it gets too dark outside.” I told them. “It gets dark around 8 pm and it is working on 6 right now so we have about 2 hours to get everything done.” We talk for a minute about what to do and decide to keep all the blinds shut and make sure everything is locked up. After that I try my best to reassure my friends and myself, but that does little to help. I had a sense of something watching me ever since walking by the forest earlier today and it hadn’t left.

It’s  was around 7:45 by now and almost dark outside. The streetlamps are beginning to come on and still the fog was still there to greet us. We all decided to stay in my room for the night because it’s located upstairs. We brought some snacks and water with us to try and ride out tonight. 

“Jesus Christ man,” Jason said, “What is going on in this town?”

“I don’t know, but I hope we figure out something soon.” I responded.

Edmund looks over to me, “What if we are stuck in this fog forever?”

I let out a sigh, “Come on man, there is no reason to jump to the worst case scenario,” I looked over at him, “I’m sure there has got to be some explanation to this.” I questioned my response. 

Another hour or so passed and we were all sitting around trying to take our mind off our situation. Jason was playing a game on his phone, Edmund was trying to sleep on a makeshift mattress and I was reading a book that I have been trying to finish for a while now. It worked for a little while until I heard something outside that caught my attention. I put my book down and went over to the window and peered out through the blinds.

“What are you doing?” Jason asked and Edmund sat up after failing to succumb to sleep. 

I turned around and looked back at them, “Did you guys hear that?” They both started to make their way over to the window.

“I didn’t hear anything.” Jason said and Edmund nodded in agreement.

Just as the words left his mouth I caught something out around the neighbors house, but I couldn’t make out what it was. All I could make out was this dark silhouette. We were all looking out at it now just creeping around in the neighbors backyard.

“What is that thing?” Edmund said as I raised my hand to make him quiet down. Just as I did that I noticed another figure, then another. 

That’s when the screaming began.

It’s been over an hour now and it’s quieter outside. The silence is broken every now and then to gunshots, some of the worst screaming I have ever heard or both. We haven’t spoken a word to each other since and are just sitting in the darkness of my room praying that whatever those things are don’t find a way in. I have pulled out my laptop to type this account and I am going to try to post this wherever I can.

 I don’t know if we are going to make it through the night.

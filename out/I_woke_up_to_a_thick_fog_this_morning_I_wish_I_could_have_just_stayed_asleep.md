“Wake up Thomas!” my roommate Jason exclaimed as he slapped me on my shoulder. “You need to see this.”

“This better be important, you know I had a late night.” I said with a slightly agitated tone.

I looked up and saw Jason looking out the window with a look of confusion painted on his face. I roll off the couch and slowly make my way over to see what has him all worked up. When I finally reached the window I looked at the street and all I could see was this red tinged fog.

I looked over at Jason, “You woke me up because of a little fog.” I said.

“C’mon man don’t you think this looks different from ordinary fog.” he said as he looked at me while pointing out the window. “There is something about it that just doesn’t sit right with me.”

I can’t say I don’t agree with him there, there is something a little off about it. It looks almost milky it's so thick and the red hue it has doesn’t seem normal. We sat and talked about it a little more discussing what we thought could have caused this when my other roommate Edmund came out from his room.

“What’s up with the fog outside?” he asked. Me and Jason both looked at him and shrugged our shoulders.

“We have been trying to figure that out ourselves.” I told him.

I decided to pull out my phone to try to look at the weather when I noticed that there was no reception. “Hey guys,” I said “Do any of you have service?” They both pulled out their phones and played with it for a second before looking at me and shaking their heads. “This is really weird.” Jason says with a hint of unease in his voice. “I agree,” said Edmund. Just then I looked out the window to the street and noticed that some of our neighbors walking around. “You guys want to go see what the neighbors think?” I asked and they shook their heads in agreement.

After throwing on a coat and grabbing a flashlight, me, Jason and Edmund headed out into the street. In the fog we only had clear sight for about 25 or 30 yards before we had trouble seeing so we stayed pretty close together to not lose sight of each other. As we were walking we came across our neighbor Mr. Randolph. He is an older man probably in his late 60’s who has been my neighbor since moving to this town 2 years ago.

“What do you boys think of this?” Mr. Randolph exclaimed in that worn out raspy voice he has.

“We were hoping you could tell us,” I said “Have you talked to anyone who has an idea of what’s going on?”

Mr. Randolph while scratching his wiry beard said, “I was about to head over to the police station if you boys want to tag along.”

We all followed Mr. Randolph to the police station which is about a 15 minute walk from our house. We ran into a few other people along the way and none of them had any idea what was going on either. Some people decided to come with us so we had a pretty big group with us when we arrived at the station. We realized when we got there that a lot of people had the same idea as us. There was a large crowd out in front of the police station and the town's small police force was out front trying to calm everyone down.

As we got close enough to see what was going on the sheriff pulled out a megaphone. Sheriff Daily is a man who looks in his late 50s with black hair and a beard. He is no small man to say the least, he has got to be around 6’ 2 and 250 pounds. He looks very intimidating, but pretty much everyone in our town knows the sheriff and respects him. So when he grabs the megaphone and tells the crowd to settle down the crowd goes silent almost immediately.

“Listen up everyone,” Sheriff Daily announced “We know just about as much as you do about this situation. We’ve been trying to contact other departments outside of town but we are having trouble getting messages out.”

I look over at my friends who look back at me with a worried expression. “What’s going on dude?” Edmund exclaims.

“So listen up everybody!” Sheriff Daily begins “If anyone has any issues come and report it to us immediately, for now we are going to do all we can to help.” With that he puts the microphone down and is immediately surrounded by people asking questions.

“So what you boys think?” Mr. Randolph asks.

“I honestly don’t know, what about you guys?” I say as I turn to my friends.

“Well I am starving right now and we barely have any food at home so let's go hit up the convenience store.” Jason exclaims.

“Sounds good to me, I could go for some lunch.” I responded.

Mr. Randolph looks at us, “Well you boys have fun, I am gonna stay here at the station for a while.”

“Let us know if you hear anything” I say to him and he nods.

The three of us set off to find something to eat. There were a lot of people at the convenience store but it wasn't that crowded. I guess most everyone went to the supermarket we have in town. After grabbing enough food and water to last a day or two we headed back to our house. On the way home one side of the road there is a pretty dense thicket of trees and I swear I could feel eyes looking at me from somewhere within them. I told my friends and they just shrugged it off, but we did pick up the pace a little bit.

We got home around 2 pm and made some lunch which consisted of cup noodles and ham sandwiches. None of us are chefs by any means. I was looking out the window every once in a while to see if anything had changed and every time I was met with the same thick fog with the unnatural red coloring to it. You can’t really tell what time of day it is by looking out because the sun can barely penetrate through the stuff it's so dense. I lounged around for a little while and decided to check my watch which told me it was coming up on 5 o’clock.

I was sitting at the dining room table when there was a knock at the door. I opened it to find Mr. Randolph who looked pretty shaken. “What’s up Mr. Randolph, you alright?” I ask. He looks around inside my house for a moment, “I’ve heard some news from down at the station, mind if I sit down for a minute?” he responds. “Of course, come on in.” I say, a little uneasy.

Edmund and Jason come and take a seat on the couch as me and Mr. Randolph each grab a recliner.

“Well…” he begins, “A few deputies at the station decided to try and ride out of town to see if it was like this in the town over.” I looked over at him, “Well did they say anything?” I ask. “They came back not 15 minutes later as pale as a sheet.” Mr. Randolph responds, “They said that when they got to the road that leads out of town it was completely swallowed up by the forest. It was as if it was never there in the first place.”

“What!” Jason says standing up from his seat, “You’re not just playing with us are you Mr. Randolph? There is no way trees could overtake a road in one night!”

“I wish I was joking with you boys,” he says, “The police are trying to calm the people and are telling everyone to go home and stay indoors tonight. I recommend you all do the same.”

I look at Jason and Edmund who are visibly distraught by this, “Okay guys it’s fine the police will figure something out and we will sort out this mess.” I said not believing the words coming out of my own mouth.

Mr. Randolph stands up and heads for the door, “You boys stay safe, I am right next door if you need anything.” I stand up and walk to the door, “Thanks Mr. Randolph, the same goes for you.” I say while shutting the door behind him. I turned to look at my friends who all looked like they had just seen a ghost and I probably looked the same.

“Guys,” Edmund exclaims, “So what’s the plan? I am sort of freaking out right now.” I take a look outside, still reminded of the situation at hand. “I think just to be safe we should lock the house down the best we can before it gets too dark outside.” I tell them. “It gets dark around 8 pm and it is working on 6 right now so we have about 2 hours to get everything done.” We talk for a minute about what to do and decide to keep all the blinds shut and make sure everything is locked up. After that I try my best to reassure my friends and myself, but that does little to help. I’ve had a sense of something watching me ever since walking by the forest earlier today and it hasn’t left.

It’s around 7:45 right now and it’s almost dark outside. The streetlamps are beginning to come on and still the fog remains. We all decided to stay in my room for the night because it’s located upstairs. We brought some snacks and water with us to try and ride out tonight.

“Jesus Christ man,” Jason says, “What is going on in this town?”

“I don’t know, but I hope we figure out something soon.” I responded.

Edmund looks over to me, “What if we are stuck like this fog forever?”

I let out a sigh, “Come on man there is no reason to jump to the worst case scenario,” I looked over at him, “I’m sure there has got to be some explanation to this.” I question my response.

Another hour or so passes and we are all sitting around trying to take our mind off our situation. Jason is playing a game on his phone, Edmund is trying to sleep on a makeshift mattress and I am reading a book that I have been trying to finish for a while now. It works for a little while until I hear something outside that catches my attention. I put my book down and go over to the window and peer out through the blinds.

“What are you doing?” Jason asks and Edmund sits up after failing to succumb to sleep.

I turn around and look back at them, “Did you guys hear that?” They both start to make their way over to the window.

“I didn’t hear anything.” Jason says and Edmund nods in agreement.

Just as the words left his mouth I saw something out around the neighbors house, but I couldn’t make out what it was. All I could make out was this dark silhouette. We are all looking out at it now just creeping around in the neighbors backyard.

“What is that thing?” Edmund says as I raise my hand to make him quiet down. Just as I said that I noticed another figure, then another.

That’s when the screaming began.

 

Hi, my name is Sandra, I am 9 years old. I am in hospital at the moment, I found out not long ago that I got some sort of disease, but luckily they say it is in the early stages so, hopefully I will be ok. They just started me on my first round of medicines, and I really hate it, I just want to go home, but they said I have to stay in hospital for a good while. 

When my parents and brother came to visit me a few days ago they brought the most adorable Teddy bear I had ever seen. It had black eyes, a brown nose with a blue and white stripy pyjamas, kind of fitting with the hospital theme I suppose. I get very lonely at night-time here, most of the other kids had roommates but I was alone, so I was really happy to get my new Teddy, he really helped me get through the bad times. Everything was going good for the first few days until this boy named Timmy was transferred into my room. He had bright blue eyes and brown scruffy hair, he was kinda funny looking, but I didn’t care I was just happy to have someone to play with.  

The next day when I woke up my Teddy was gone, I cried all morning. I was sure Timmy stole it, I heard he was always up to some sort of mischief back in the other ward, but the nurses checked everywhere and couldn’t find him. Later that day I felt a bit better and decided to go looking for Teddy, I was sick of being stuck in bed all the time anyway, I told the nurse Tracy I was just going for a walk, and she said it was fine as long as I didn’t go too far. I had grown rather attached to that nurse, she treated me like I was her own daughter. Timmy followed me, I didn’t even want to talk to him at first, but he swore he didn’t take my Teddy and offered to help me look, so I let him come with me. 

Timmy said he might have got thrown out with the garbage by mistake. In my building the garbage is kept in the basement so I thought it might be the same here, we got in the elevator and went down to check. It was so scary, there was no one around and it was dark in parts, Timmy wanted to go back up to our ward, but he was too afraid to go on his own. I really wanted my Teddy back, so I begged him to stay he agreed, we searched everywhere until finally, we went into a room where there were all these black bags on tables. At the end, one of them was opened, and my Teddy was sticking out, I thought Timmy was right, they did throw it out, I was so happy to find him. 

When I got near Teddy, the light flickered, then went out, and Timmy screamed, I was so scared I didn’t know what to do, I tried to run away but I must have fell over Timmy. When the light came back there was a man with a white coat standing at the door, he looked very angry. I turned around Timmy was on the floor and Teddy was lying on top of him, Timmy’s hand was all blood and there was a scalpel on the floor. 

I got into a lot of trouble over that, I think they thought I cut Timmy, but I would never do that, I would never hurt anyone. I told them it must have been Teddy, but they wouldn’t believe me and confiscated him, I didn’t really mind I was a little bit scared of him after that anyways. 

We were not allowed out alone anymore, so we spent the rest of the day in our room, I felt bad for Timmy he got 6 stitches and he was sore after it. At first, I think even he thought it was me who cut him, but when I explained it, he started to believe me, and we were friends again. We were both scared that night after they turned the lights out, I promised Timmy I would watch his back if he did the same for me. I tried to stay awake for a long time to watch out, but I must have been too tired and fell asleep, when I woke there was a load of beeping coming from Timmy’s machine and Teddy was on his face. I jumped up and ran over to grab Teddy to pull him off. Then the nurse walked in and thought I was trying to hurt Timmy, luckily he was ok, but I still got into a lot of trouble. It's not fare I was only trying to help. 

When they stopped giving out to me, they took Teddy away again, and asked me how I got him, I tried to tell them he was bad, and he hurted Timmy but they didn’t want to listen. For the rest of that night, they kept coming in to check on us and I couldn’t sleep for a long time over them, when I did, I had a horrible nightmare about Timmy getting hurt again. When I woke up Teddy was in my arms, and Timmy was gone, they must have taken him in the night-time when I was asleep. Now I’m back to having no friends, and I am going to get in trouble again for taking Teddy, but I swear I didn’t do anything.

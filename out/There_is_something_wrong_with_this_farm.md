My name is Simon 21m I live in a farm in Ohio I moved here recently because my grandparents had passed away and I Inherited the farm they owned.

 On my first day I moved here nothing unusual happened. That is until the next day, I was tending to the animals but they seemed a bit unusual the pigs and cows were silent and never made a sound and the horses were all still like a statue they were standing still not doing anything at all, 

but I ignored it and after I finished taking care of the animals I went to water the crops

After I finished watering the crops I saw a dark shadow looking at me from the trees,
I said 

"Hello? Who's there?"

 It stepped outside the tree and I got a better look of it, but it didn't look human at all and of course it scared the shit out of me and I ran inside and locked the door,

 I rembered there was a shotgun in my room and I went and grabbed it, after I got my shotgun I went outside and tried to look for it, but it was gone it wasn't there anymore like there wasn't anything there before, 

After that I went back inside and tried to call 911 to ask them for help but the phone had no signal 

At this point my heart was beating so fast that it felt like it was going to burst out of my chest,

 I'm easily scared and I read a lot of horror stories and in a lot of those stories the phones would have no signal when the characters try to call for help. 

So now I try to calm myself down and I thought

"Maybe I was just hallucinating" I have been working on the field for a while and it was really hot today and I hallucinate easily 

I checked my phone again and the signal was back so I was relieved but still creeped out so I called my friend Kevin over to help me out, He only lives 2 hours away from this farm, he said yes and came over 2 hours later and helped me out, after we finished he said he wanted to stay the night so I let him since he helped me out. 

9:14pm we went to sleep cause we were too tired. 

But at 12:43AM we woke up to the sound of crashing down stairs, we were both surprised and felt scared but I grabbed my shotgun and gave Kevin a bat and we headed down slowly downstairs. 

After we got downstairs I turned on the light, but we saw there wasn't anything there but we searched around the house and we still saw nothing, so we went back to sleep. 

The next morning I woke up and went to look outside the window and there I saw it, 

The shadowy figure I saw on those trees and I wasn't hallucinating. 

I woke Kevin up to show him this and when he saw this his face turned pale and he was completely afraid, 

"What the hell is that" Kevin said*
"I don't know but for sure it isn't human" 
I said*

I tried to call 911 but the signal was gone again, both of us were scared like hell, my heart beating like last time, 

But we gathered up our courage and went to grab our weapons. 

We went outside and we shouted

"Who are you? And What the hell are you" 

For 20 seconds it stood there and stared at us, after that it charged at me I shot its arm with my shotgun but I missed, but my friend Kevin hit it with his bat and screamed in pain and ran away. 

My friend Kevin ran after it, maybe because of the heat of the moment he thought he could kill it so he ran after it and he threw his bat and it hit it and fell the ground. 

Kevin then it got up and lunged at Kevin but he dodged it and kicked it in the back and then it fell to the ground again. 

Then Kevin took my shotgun and shot it 3 times killing it. 

After it died it dissolved into a black muddy oily looking puddle. After that my friend Kevin fainted cause he used up too much energy. 

I was shocked and couldn't believe what happened but I picked up Kevin and took him back in the house as fast as I could. 

He woke up 4 hours after the incident and I checked if I could call the police and luckily the signal was back, so I called 911 and they came 30 minutes later. 

They took my friend Kevin to the hospital, and I told my parents what happened and they didn't believe it at first but they came around and I stayed with my parents for a while. 

 and we decided to sell the farm. 

Now me and my friend Kevin is ok and we're all living rather peacefully now.

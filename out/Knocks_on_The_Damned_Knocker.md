The sun was at its highest, and the sound of laughing teenagers and Karens echoed throughout the hall. 

I was in the home accessories section. I had no idea how I got there, but I could vividly remember the whispers that came from this direction. 

The whispers only got louder as I got to the deepest part of the section. 

I saw it. The bronze dragon. 

I lifted it from the shelf. It was an antique door knocker. The whispers became more audible but I still couldn't make out what it was saying. 

It was probably all in my head. I was just delusional. 

I ran my thumbs on each dragon head, they were well sculpted. Sculpted to perfection. I turned it around and saw a name written faintly. I needed my reading glasses to see properly. 

Luckily, I bought them along, because I'm long-sighted. 

I brought them out of their house and put them on. I look around and most of the things became slightly clearer. 

"Diablo, 1918," I said out loud. 

I continued to study the antique to find something else but that was it. It must have belonged to a member of the elite group back then. 

"Beautiful isn't it," A masculine voice said beside me and I gasped. 

I did not realize I had company. 

"Yes... It's intriguing," I said to the man. 

He looked wary and he had pretty visible lines, his eyes were bloodshot and his skin was pale. He looked.......bizarre. 

"The owner was a man of his word," He added as he stared down at it. 

"You know the owner?" I asked putting my interest in the man. 

"We all know the Diablo," He said before a brief pause. "Make sure you make it out alive," He added before he smiled. 

"Thanks?" I replied awkwardly. 

He turned around and walked a few steps before he turned back and looked at me. 

"Happy Halloween, Doctor," he said before he walked out of this section. 

What was all that fuss about? And how did he know I am a doctor?   

Was he one of my patients? 

I shook the thoughts of the man out of my head. I gave the antique a brief look before I dropped it back where it belonged. 

I continued with my shopping and got everything I needed in the cart. It was time to check out.

I gave the store cashier the basket so he could check it out. 

"Sir, forty-nine, ninety-nine, we also offer packaging for the antique," The cashier replied. 

"Antique?" I asked confused. 

"Yes, or didn't you get one?" He asked. 

I frowned my face as I saw the bronze metal sticking out in the bag.

"I got one, it just slipped through my mind, I don't need packaging it's for me," I said before I handed him out my card. 

We finished the transactions and I stepped out of the store. 

"I guess a doorbell and door knocker wouldn't hurt," I said out loud before I got to my car. 

I paid the parking fees and zoomed out of the driveway. 

Memories of the man from earlier flooded back into my head and I frowned. How did he know me? 

As I drove, the cars became scanty. I lived in one of the quietest and most mysterious neighborhoods in Illinois. 

After ten minutes of driving, I arrived in front of my house.  I got down with the groceries and grabbed the keys and phone from the back seat. 

I walked towards the pathway and unlocked the door to my house. 

"Hey, doctor!" I heard Jonathan my neighbor from across the street call me.

I turned around and smiled at him. 

"Hello Jonathan," I replied. 

"Why aren't you at work?" He asked before he placed one of his hands on his waist. 

"Halloween, we barely had any patients, isn't it a day for crazy people?" I gave a grim smile. I was a psychiatrist. So he would get the joke. 

He laughed out loud and brushed the little tear that escaped from his eyes.

"How hilarious Greg," He said. A female voice called him and he waved a bye at me before he answered the girl. 

I barely had friends, I only ever spoke to Jonathan or Micheal close to me. Before I went, I took the antique and placed it on my door. 

I checked the time. It was already three in the Afternoon. I took too long in the supermarket. 

I walked in with the groceries and placed them down in the kitchen. Everything felt off and odd today. 

I warmed myself a little cold pizza while I freshen in my toilet. 

I was right on time when the oven dinged loudly. I grabbed it and headed for the couch. I could catch up with a little documentary. 

The last one I watched was about an otaku killer. I should continue it.

Five minutes into the program, I had finished two slices of pizza. I heard a light sound at the door. 

It was probably Jonathan. 

"Coming!" I answered as I rushed to the door. 

I opened the door and I met no one. 

I resumed watching my documentary. 

Another light knock was placed and I checked who it was. But no one. Somebody was probably pranking me because I got a door knocker. 

This time I only moved back. 

The knock resumed and this time it only became intense and loud. I tipped-toed to the door and opened it with a loud ah ha! 

But I was utterly disappointed. No one was at the door. The person was a good prankster. 

I resumed my documentary and ignored the knocks on the door. The person was going to get tired eventually.

I checked the time again and I realized it was already five in the evening. I continued to binge-watch. 

\*\*\*

I had no idea when I had fallen asleep. I was awoken by the blasting music from my phone. It was eleven at the night. 

Jonathan was the caller.

"Why aren't you at this party?" He yelled from the other side. The music was loud but I could understand what he was saying. 

I looked out the window and I saw different people dressed in scary costumes and cosplay.

"I was not invited," I replied softly. 

"Get your-" He didn't finish his sentence before the line went dead. 

My eyes were still on the window. 

I approached it to get a closer view. I felt cold air brush the back of my neck. I ignored it. One of the windows was probably open. 

I studied the guests and their makeup. They looked pretty real. As I continued to stare, one of them looked at me.

She had white eyes and her skin was eaten up. Talking about top-notch makeup. 

She pointed her finger toward me. I heard light knocks from outside and I was phased by such good timing. They deserved an Oscar. 

She placed her left-hand thumb on her neck and moved it from left to right before she muttered something. 

From my years of soundless talk, she was saying "You are next," 

I felt cold air creeping from my back again and I frowned my face. 

This was a joke. The whispers were loud and some of them were words.

"Run, Doctor."

Disembodied voice

Sometimes one is never aware of a silent admirer who suffers in silence. But in this case, it was a dead girl who loved me in total invisible silence. I never knew, until I started hearing a female voice yelling me awake after 3 am, every night at exactly the same time. It continued for almost 10 years. 

I couldn’t recall the screaming every night. But I heard the loud ghostly screaming in my sleep frequently.

*I would hear a woman yelling my name over and over in my sleep.* 

It was always the same voice and always calling my name repeatedly. I lived alone, and I still do, but I moved out of that house. It was haunted. The ghost was persistent. 

“Fu’ad! Fu’ad! Fu’ad! Fu’ad!” A female voice screamed my name exceedingly loud. Most times I would hear the yelling in my sleep. On this particular early morning, the yelling was louder as usual. “I responded and shouted back: “I’m coming! Hang on!” Then, I awoke. I slept with the light on. I looked around. There was no one in my room. 

I began to realise, it was a ghost! I looked around. It was no one. “It has to be a ghost,” I pondered. “What else?”

I realised it wasn’t a normal dream. 

I walked to the kitchen and boiled the water for a strong mug of coffee.

No, I was not scared in the least. I sensed the ghostly entity meant me no harm. The sound of her voice was rather high-pitched, seemingly, innocently sincere and somewhat of an urgent nature. But it seemed profoundly otherworldly and intensely bizarre.

 I slumped into the chair. I was unable to sleep again. It was a warm summer’s early morning. But a coldness surrounded me. They say, a sign of a paranormal presence would cause a radical drop in temperature, known as cold spots.

I’ve always had the intense curiosity for things that go bump in the night. It was my habit to frequently visit the local library to read up on esoteric phenomena: astral projection and astral travel, soul-mates, UFOs, palm-reading, astrology, dream interpretation, astrology, and all things considered offbeat. 

I’ve been searching for what I termed reality and the meaning of life since I was a school-boy. These things fascinated me intently. I was excited and rather intrigued that I heard a ghost yelling my name at night-time. But further than that, there was no other form of contact. So, I thought.

I was not second-sighted nor was I able to hear people talk from the other side. I had met one or two people who claimed to have the ability of second-sight. But I was aware, most people tell lies just to impress you.

I had gone to the local Church of Spiritualism in town several times years back, even as a school boy and during my university days. I received short messages from the other side. There were a couple of psychics standing in front on a low stage; who relayed the paranormal messages to members in the audience. There wasn’t time to relay a message to each and everyone. The attendance was always impressive. The hall would always be filled to capacity. There would often be new faces in the audience, but mostly the same people would be in attendance. 

I normally received messages from deceased family and friends. I truly believed what was said, because the dead person giving the message would first tell me something no one else would know. 

I also had weird otherworldly encounters. I was bewitched and possessed by demons; sent by a clergyman who didn’t like what I wrote about his religious priestly organisation. I had exposed their profane corruption which made the people question their nefarious so-called religious organisation’s activities. No, it wasn’t a Christian priest. I wrote about it in my books here on Amazon: “True ghostly encounters -there are ghosts all around us,” and more extensively in my graphic, realistic and dramatised version: “I’m not dead! – true paranormal encounter.”

Ghosts can encroach on you in different ways. They can entice you in your sleep and while you are awake. You might not be aware of it, but they can also manipulate your emotions. They can be completely in full power of your feelings. They can also possess you. They can also possess someone else and make that person sexually subservient to you. 

The main reason why many ghosts seek sexual gratification through possession is because they tend to re-experience earthly sexual satisfaction. They might possess someone else and obtain sexual satisfaction through that person’s body. 

Iknew of someone who refused to believe he was possessed by sexual otherworldly entities, human and non-human. He is not particularly good-looking, but almost any girl would fall under his spell as soon as he comes into contact with the opposite sex, because those sexual entities bring the females to him for their own gratification. They would lust women through his body and sleep with the women through him. I told him, but he remained skeptical to this day. I also told him there is a heavy energy-field surrounding him, almost like an ekectro-magnetic field.

# It goes bump in the night. Everyone is scared! Yet we’re intrigued by the unknown. Not all ghosts are harmless. Some come to take revenge, others torment you, especially in your sleep. When you fall asleep, your soul ejects out of your body. And you are a ghost too!

In my experience when I consciously and wilfully astral or soul project out of my physical body; I at first became very afraid of myself! My physical body appeared as if it was a lifeless doll. 

I could walk through the door in my room, I could soar up in the air, I could even fly around the neighbourhood. I found that my soul is exactly like my physical body; it too fell asleep.

*A few times, I found myself looking at my soul, and my soul looking at my body, and I was both.*

Ghosts are dead people who exist in a parallel realm to our dimension. Some ghosts are caught in a timeless void and experience a recurring pattern of consciousness, based on the way they existed on earth while in a human physical body.

Ghosts come to you in your deep sleep. Some ghosts continue to live as they were still on the earth plane. They continue to date with the opposite sex, and they watch your every move. If a ghostly lover has targeted you, he or she will close in and make themselves known. Most people who had such paranormal experience, won’t talk about it publicly, especially men.

The few women we spoke up about their ghostly escapades did so with pride, as if it’s an achievement.

Whether or not ghostly sex is taboo or not, acceptable in your religion or belief-system, it has been going on since time immemorial. Ancient records attest to this phenomenon.

# How does a ghost relate to our realm?

In my experience of astral or soul projection, I felt exactly the same as I am inside my physical body. I have the same Me-consciousness, the same feelings and emotions, the same aspirations, ideals, expectations, and the exact same desires and fears. The only difference is, I was much more alert and much more aware of my surroundings. This is because I would be above our five-sense perception. I would be like a psychic being able to use my senses remotely. I could be at any place at any time in an instant, anywhere in the universe or out of the universe. I could also be anywhere in any realm at any time in an instant. These are due to the notion that everything in all existence of all phenomena are inter-connected through energy. Everything is basically at its core; energy. Form is an expression of energy. Energy is thought, the mind.

# Spectrophilia

Spectrophilia, or intimate attraction between a ghost and a human being, occurs in our contemporary post-modern era, but few talk about it. Johnathan Carroll and Marc Levy both wrote recent novels on ghosts being passionately in love with living human beings. It’s classified as a fantasy genre. Their books sold well, indicating there is an overwhelming public interest in the phenomenon. But not many recent books were written on the issue. However, a few celebrities made media appearances and divulged they had affairs with ghosts.

Mike Huberty, who runs a haunted tour company called [American Ghost Walks](https://americanghostwalks.com/), spoke with Cosmopolitan. He said it was real and we can’t deny it. “Actual sex with ghosts is harder to prove, though. Huberty says that he's interviewed several people who have definitely thought they've had sex with a ghost. While, first-hand accounts of sex with ghosts are rare, spectrophilia is alive and well when it comes to movie representation. There's the film *Ghost* starring Demi Moore and Patrick Swayze, with Swayze portraying a spectral being. 

“The more recent horror flick *It Follows* also works around ghost sex. And of course, the kiss between Casper and Christina Ricci in 1995's [*Casper*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casper_(film)) is also an example of a PG ghost hook-up. Plus, there's a surprising number of celebs who have spoken about supernatural sexual encounters.”

in 1999, [Lucy Liu spoke to *US Weekly*](https://dreamstudies.org/2012/03/14/the-ecstasy-of-lucy-liu-erotic-encounters-in-hypnagogia/) about going for a cat-nap; winding up climaxing from sex with a ghostly male lover beyond the grave.

[Amethyst Realm](https://nypost.com/2018/10/30/woman-who-had-sex-with-20-ghosts-is-now-engaged-to-a-spirit/) from the UK claimed in the media she had sex with 20 ghosts and got engaged and planned to marry a disembodied and invisible lover.

Movie celebrities also divulged sexual encounters with ghosts.  [Lucy Liu](http://dreamstudies.org/2012/03/14/the-ecstasy-of-lucy-liu-erotic-encounters-in-hypnagogia/), [Kesha](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/09/27/kesha-sex-with-ghost_n_1919320.html) as well as [Anna Nicole Smith](http://www.askmen.com/celebs/entertainment-news/anna-nicole-smith/anna-nicole-smith-supernatural-sex.html), publicly claimed they had affairs with invisible men. Nicole Smith told FHM mag; a ghost-guy had sex with her. "I used to think it was my boyfriend, then one day I woke up and found it wasn't." 

[Natasha Blasick](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/04/30/natasha-blasick-ghost-sex_n_5240566.html), another actress in movies like [Paranoid Activity 2](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2632418/)*,* also revealed on a UK talk show in 2014; she was seduced by a ghost.

She publicly commented: "I just could feel this presence coming closer and closer and then I start feeling the actual touch without being able to see much. The touch itself like that, it's kind of human, like, you know, hands; I could feel it all over my body."

Patti Negri, a psychic a paranormal expert on the Travel Channel special Ghostly Lovers, said publicly; it’s something written in every culture since the beginning of time.

[Sleep paralysis](http://www.livescience.com/50876-sleep-paralysis.html) 

"The Incubus, by Wikimedia Commons: **“**When terror turns into sexual arousal**:** It's not exactly clear why certain people experience sleep paralysis, or who's at risk for the condition, though anxiety and [lack of sleep](http://www.livescience.com/50876-sleep-paralysis.html) do play some role.”

Women tend to share their Spectrophilia during sleep paralysis more than men do. There are also reports of out-of-body intimacy between a ghost and a human person.

The Encyclopaedia Britannica quotes: “The incubus-[demon](https://www.britannica.com/topic/demon-Greek-religion) in male form that seeks to have [sexual intercourse](https://www.britannica.com/science/sexual-intercourse) with sleeping women; the corresponding spirit in female form is called a [succubus](https://www.britannica.com/topic/succubus). In [medieval](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/medieval) Europe, union with an incubus was supposed by some to result in the birth of witches, demons, and deformed human offspring. 

“The legendary magician [Merlin](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Merlin-legendary-magician) was said to have been fathered by an incubus. The word *incubus* is derived from the Latin *incubus* (nightmare) and *incubare* (to lie upon, weigh upon, brood). In modern psychological usage, the term has been applied to the type of nightmare that gives one the feeling of a heavy weight or oppression on the chest and stomach.”

The Britannica describes the female demon counterpart as a succubus which feeds sexually on men.

Glamour ran an article a few years back, stating that a respondent said:. “For as long as humans have walked the earth, we've asked certain questions: Is there life after death? Do the departed spirits of the deceased walk among us? Can we [have sex with ghosts](https://www.glamour.com/story/hot-movie-ghosts)? Though the 1990 film [Ghost](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0099653/) came close to answering at least one of those, I'm going to be honest: My [sexual awakening](https://www.glamour.com/about/masturbation) came as the result of that hot ghost boy in [*Hocus Pocus*](https://www.glamour.com/story/hocus-pocus-was-almost-an-entirely-different-movie) who, despite spending the majority of the movie as a talking cat, was so attractive in that knockoff Leonardo DiCaprio way that I am shook to this day. (I’m [not alone in this](https://www.buzzfeed.com/keelyflaherty/thackery-binx-from-hocus-pocus-is-all-grown-up-now?utm_term=.gkMrz7LQE#aoixR2XWEB), by the way.”) ([Wanting to Have Sex With Ghosts Is a Real Thing | Glamour](https://www.glamour.com/story/spectrophilia-ghost-sex))

On the internet; [A Brief Investigation Into Human-Ghost Intercourse - Pacific Standard (psmag.com)](https://psmag.com/social-justice/a-brief-investigation-into-human-ghost-intercourse-spectrophilia-81973) 

SPECTROPHILIA IS CLASSIFIED AS both a phenomenon and a fetish, depending on how the term is being used; in cases like Blasick’s, where an actual sexual encounter is experienced, it’s the former. When categorized as one of many possible paraphilia—extreme sexual arousal caused by atypical objects, situations, or persons—spectrophilia means simply (well, sort of) the sexual attraction to ghosts or spirits. (Confusingly, this term is also used to describe individuals who experience sexual arousal from images in mirrors.)

People can have ghostly intimacy in different ways: Most experience a sexual encounter during the sleep state and upon waking up, would recall the encounter vaguely as a dream. Most times, you won’t even be aware you are being sexually seduced while sleeping. The Prophet Muhammed said, someone who is sleeping is not committing a sin, probably because he or she is not in a rational state of mind and obviously not responsible for by the esoteric and otherworldly encounter.

However, there are some people who become fully conscious outside their physical frames and actually participate willingly.

In some instances, the invisible entity seduces and actually touches and performs the sexual act with a living human being while he or she is fully consciously aware.

The flip-side to this entire ghostly sexual enticement and involvement can be totally demonic, to say the least. It has been deduced, demons are capable to change form and shape-shift into a false images and pseudo personas and pretend to be your human-like astral dream lover. It’s often the case that demons have pretended to be someone’s deceased lover and who came back presumably to be with the living partner. Incidentally, I found, demonic beings are in their nature and in general revolting and repelling. They feed on the human sexual energy. This can be explained by the sexual Satanist rituals of initiation. Someone confided in me, he attended a Satanist church sexual initiation. He said this: “I participated in an act of a sexual orgy. The girls calling themselves witches, wore white tunics, wearing nothing underneath. They poured body oil all over me. and seduced me. I had no more resistance left. At the critical moment, I became astutely aware that something bizarre was taking place. I actually heard strange demonic=like chanting emanating from somewhere invisible, as if out of another realm. The chanting sounds were eerie and I began to get afraid. But I could do nothing. I was tied up. I had the dreadful fear, I might be a human sacrifice, especially when I noticed a huge silver sword. There was a strange Occultic scribbling along the swords lengthy and sharp blade. 

But I felt relieved that the witches only manifested the sword once during their ritual as if to charge some invisible life-stream or energy or something. They didn’t inform me much, just that I should avail myself during the ensuing full moon.

“I became aware that a sort of energy entered my body. It felt like an entity entering into me through my breathing, through my nose and mouth.

“I was extremely scared!”

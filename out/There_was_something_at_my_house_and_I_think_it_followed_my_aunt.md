We moved in a new house a few years ago, just renting it till we saved up enough to afford getting one. At that time I didn't have a job and was busy searching for jobs so I often stayed up late. 
I usually ignored any ghosts so when the first instance happened, I ignored it even if I talked a lot about it. "Hello" something whispered in my ear while I was walking down the hallway in the dark. I can still remember the pain the voice gave me, I almost thought that I would go deaf in the ear. I couldn't hear out of the ear for a few weeks and it took a while to even be able to properly hear something but I can still hear the feminine voice when I think about it. 
Nothing happened for a few months and I was extremely paranoid because I could feel something watching me. 

I wrote it off thinking it was my imagination when the next incident happened which caused me to huddle with the dogs in the lounge after locking all the doors. That weekend I was alone because my mom and step dad went to his dad, I was happy because I had the house for myself. I quickly finished dinner and ate, around 8 or 9 pm I kept hearing something calling my name outside. There was 3 male voices and I checked first in front but when I didn't see anything, I locked the front. Barely a few seconds after something called me from the outside again but at the kitchen door and I stupidly went to check again, nothing again. 

I was now starting to think that I was hallucinating or that I somehow poisoned myself, I wish it was just that. I then heard another voice from the back and I was just about to just lock it when the dogs ran outside to attack something.

I was panicking because I didn't want them to get hurt so I ran outside with a baseball bat in one hand and my phone in the other with my flash on. I rounded the corner and shown my light to see what they are attacking, they were attacking the air. They kept jumping trying to bite something but it was no use. I was starting to get scared so I called the dogs inside and vigilantly looked around. I locked all the doors and hoped that they have already left. They didn't, my mom woke up one night saying 3 men and a women was watching her sleep.

Now I started getting scared to be left alone and my aunt moved in with her family, 3 daughters and her husband. They were alcoholics and eventually their 2 youngest started calling me mom, I was 19 at the time and they were 11 but I didn't mind even enjoyed it. I had to stay in a room with them but after an incident with my step dad I left to my dad's who was living with my gran that is possibly a Satanist but what happened there is a story for another time. 
I moved back after a few months because even if my mom likes to think she is strong, she isn't but she's stubborn. We converted the study into a room for me because we were all starting to be fed up with 4 people in a room. I enjoyed my new room but once I moved my bed, I started hearing strange things outside. 

I was hoping it would be an owl or some other bird but I knew instinctively that it wasn't. When it was out, nothing made a sound. The dog that keeps yapping at night, silent. I started noticing that on nights it was out, my cat was inside but would watch the window. I calmed her down and took watch so she can sleep. I would listen as it prowled and when I was brave enough I would take a peek. I didn't even see one bird or anything, not even the bat's or some insects. The street light seemed dull and I knew it was nearby. I even heard it a few times coming into the yard and climbing on the roof, I could hear as it went up. I kept silent and prayed for the backdoor to be closed. 

Sometimes I was hoping that it will leave us alone and prowl the other streets but I knew it wouldn't happen. I then got a job soon after but still kept watch at night and made sure that my cat was inside. I then got a kitten, it was an instant connection with him and I fell in love. I was hoping that having a friend would help my cat that isn't used to dogs. They kept chasing her and I was ready to save her even if I got injured. We took her to work with us every day before we suddenly got fired.

 Barely a few months after that, my cat disappeared and the thing prowling the nights disappeared as well. Some nights I would stay up to listen hoping she would return but slowly I just started wishing she was happy or had a peaceful death. 

I then started having very weird dreams (most would consider it a nightmare) and the one night I had a very strange dream of my old primary school. In the dream 2 boys approached me, that wasn't my type, and for some reason I was enamored with them but I felt something was wrong so I kept trying to wake up. I couldn't and I started panicking. Eventually my best friend suddenly got hit by a car and I woke up.

 Usually I had more control over my dreams and when to wake up but at that time I felt helpless. I am not sure why but every time I think about I feel danger and relief that I woke up. It wasn't the only strange dream I had but the most memorable. I can still feel the fear that I felt. 

Slowly all those things started disappearing but once I forgot about them, they appeared again. My aunt recently moved out and I was glad all of the tension is going to be gone. 

I am now using the room my aunt used and we went to visit her at her new house when I felt something kept watching me. I think they attached themselves to my aunt. Anytime she visits us, I tense up feeling eyes on me but I can't see them. Some very rare nights, something is telling me not to sleep yet because something bad would happen. Those nights I just stay up and crochet, the only good thing is that at around 3 or 4 am the feeling disappears so I go to bed. It's been happening rarely since my aunt moved.

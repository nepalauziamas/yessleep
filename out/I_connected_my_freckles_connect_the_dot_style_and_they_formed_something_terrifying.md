Freckles. I've always had them and I've always hated them. Most people wouldn't even know that I am covered in them, but that doesn't matter, because I know. There are exactly thirty-three of them, all spread out across my chest. They are all scattered in a random order, and at a glance, you might think that I have a small galaxy tattooed on my upper body. 

My mum always tried her best to make me feel better about them and often would describe them as 'cute', and 'unique'. She would tell me that thirty had always been her lucky number, and so, she saw my thirty freckles as a sign of good luck. I disagree. Mum also used to say that she believed one freckle in particular was a good luck sign.

One freckle, right in the middle of my chest, was a lot larger than the rest. It sat directly in the centre of the constellation of freckles on my torso. 

I guess I struggled with the idea of my freckles mainly when I was younger, but as I grew older, I did get used to the fact that they were there. They were apart of me and I just had to learn to embrace them. Eventually, I managed to get to a point where I almost forgot about their existence. That was until I got the scratch. 

The forest out the back of my house used to be the perfect spot for a morning run. The air was cool and crisp, the smell of pine was in the air and the rush of blood around my body. It was the perfect way to wake up. 

Unfortunately, when running through trees you are bound to get a few scratches here and there. I was fairly used to it, it was easy to do. Accidentally run too close to a branch and a small scratch was inevitable. I would often knick my hand on a small branch or twig and even a few times I had managed to get a few scratches on my cheek. That one morning though, I got a scratch directly across my chest. 

It wasn't a huge scratch, it was actually quite small. It wasn't the size of the scratch that I was concerned about, no, it was where the small cut was. It lined up perfectly between two of my freckles that were located near the edge of my freckle cluster. The scratch ran between two of the freckles in a perfectly straight line, joining each freckle to one another flawlessly. 

I didn't notice it until I got home from my run and taken my shirt off to have a shower. It was then that it caught my eye in the mirror. Once I saw it, I couldn't take my eye off of it. I know it sounds a bit crazy, but I somehow knew that it meant something. It was just lined up too perfectly to be just a coincidence. I became certain that something strange was occurring to me when I felt the itch. 

A freckle directly below one of the joined ones began to itch intensely. Not just a small irritating itch, but one that was almost painful and needed to be scratched hard. I began to scratch the itch that was emanating from the freckle. My fingernails didn't do the trick though, and no matter how hard I tried to scratch, the itch raged on.

I scratched harder and harder, but nothing happened. I don't really know what compelled me to do what I did next, maybe it was desperation, but I decided that I should join this freckle to the previous two. 

I made a light scratch between the two already joined freckles and the freckle that was causing me my discomfort. As soon as the small cut I made onto my skin with my nail connected all three freckles, the itching stopped. 

Well, it stopped on that freckle, but began to itch again at the freckle next to it. I did it again. I made a small scratch from the previous itchy freckles to the one that was now itching. Once they were joined, another freckle began to itch. 

This continued with each freckle that I connected to the other. I would join one with a small cut, then the next one would begin to itch. I made line after line onto my body, connecting each freckle to the one before it. I was creating a connect the dots puzzle on my skin, except I had been born with the dots already on my body. 

I kept joining the dots via a small scratch that left a red line etched into my skin. The only way to relieve the itch was to join that freckle to the other. Line after line. Scratch after scratch. 

I was so focused on the intense itching sensation that was emanating from the dots that I didn't even look at what the lines on my skin were creating, if they even were making something bigger. 

I felt one final itch. The last freckle that was left unscratched. The large freckle in the middle of my chest was the last one to be joined into the puzzle.

The itching feeling was even stronger and more unbearavle than it had been before, and so I quickly traced a line into my skin to be rid of the feeling. In doing so, the connect the dot puzzle was complete. 

The second that the line joined to the large freckle, I heard a loud cracking sound and a sharp pain radiated across my chest. I doubled over from the pain and heard a few more snapping noises followed by more pain. 

I let out a scream of agony and clutched at my chest. As I grabbed onto my aching torso, I felt my flesh beginning to tear. From the top of my sternum, to my belly button, a long gash appeared in my skin. 

The skin on either side of the long cut then started to spread apart, widing the slice along my chest. Blood poured from the cut, which then ran down my torso. Then the skin started to move outwards and my chest opened, like a book.

I look downwards as this all occurred, in absolute terror at what was happening. I also realised that the cracking noises were the sound of my ribs breaking and snapping, allowing my chest to open up. 

My whole chest now moved and opened, and I could see my own ribs, open like a jaw filled with sharp pointed teeth. Then, just as it had opened, my chest snapped shut again. 

I continued to watch on in fear as the cut along my chest started to heal, and soon it was gone, not even leaving a scar. Then, from inside my body, I felt my rib bones reforming and fusing back together. 

I screamed again, in total shock as to what had just happened to me. I looked at my chest in the mirror to see if I could catch any sign or mark that would prove that my best had indeed opened. My scar was visible. 

What caught my eye though, was the lines I had scratched into my skin. The red marks formed to spell out a few words. A few words that made me shudder. The words my freckles had formed were 'It's time for me to come out'.

**TURN LEFT IN 500 FEET**

“Right here?” Holly asked, squinting through her glasses at the dark road ahead.

“Yeah right here… on to this even creepier back road. I’m starting to not want to go to college here, this country vibe comes off as kind of rapey?” I said. 

“I was going to say children of the corn-ish but yeah, I get that. You could really dump a body here.”

**CONTINUE STRAIGHT FOR 45 MILES**

“Oh fun! Like 40 minutes of super dark, super creepy back roads hick ass Forrest bullshit town…” holly trailed off under her breath. 

“We’ll I guess if we wanted better options we should’ve gotten better grades” I said. 

Holly laughed “damn Mindy…  that’s cold”

“There’s a ton of just random cars on the side of the road here” holly said driving slowly around one

“Yeah I see that, they’re super in the way wtf, you’d think someone would come move them” I said. 

We were listening to Spotify and making jokes and light conversation for about 5 minutes until the music cut off. 

“Crap. Can you try and fix it?” Holly handed me her phone. 

“There’s no signal, Spotify and gps are out… let me check my phone.”

I pulled out my phone and no signal. 

“How are we going to find the college?” Holly asked, looking a little panicked. 

“Don’t worry, we’ll keep going down this road I’m sure we’re almost there is said the college was 60 miles away, this road is mostly straight. I’m sure it leads to like a little college town with cell signal and people to ask directions” I said. 

“Yeah, you’re probably right”

“Oh my god holly look out! There’s a man on the side of the road there!”

“What the fuck!”

Holly swirled and avoided the man walking on the side of the dark narrow dirt road 

“Was he naked?!” Holly shrieked 

“He was for sure” 

“I expect that in the city but damn…” holly said, fixing her glasses and carrying on. 

I sat back in my chair, hoping that would be the most exciting thing to happen tonight

**MAKE A U TURN**

We both jumped.

Me and holly looked at eachother briefly, and then started laughing

“I guess we have gps again then” she said 
I checked her phone to make sure

“Holly… there’s still no signal” I said

**MAKE A U TURN NOW**

“I’ve never heard my gps say that before..” she said

“Me neither…” 

**MAKE THE U TURN NOW**

“Mindy turn it off”

I grabbed her phone and shut it off quickly. 

“I don’t like this” I said 

“Oh my god… is that the same guy

As we drove closer it was clear to us… that was the same man… standing slightly closer to the road, no longer lingering near the tree line… smiling so big at us, fully nude. 

Holly once again swirved, this time the trees and bushes from the right side abruptly brushed against the car.

“How did he get there? I’m going 50 miles an hour?!” Holly yelled

“I don’t know”

“MINDY WHAT IS GOING ON” 

“I DONT KNOW! I DONT FUCKING KNOW!”

“oh god he’s back…”

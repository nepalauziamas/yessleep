My oh my! Have you ever met the gorgeous Mr. Gene Daprey? Doubtful I suppose. But surely you know of him? The ravishing picture star? Lives in the hills of Hollywood? Yes, him! He’s to die for! Truly a delight!

You see, I’m in love with him. I know that in the great year of 1939 that it may be quite scandalous, but I can’t hide it. I want to be with him. Ever since I saw him in that silent film No Solace for Sinners, the one where he portrays Mr. Randall J. Gregory, I’ve been infatuated. I heard that movie won some awards even! That was a long time ago now. 

Anyhow, I pray my momma doesn’t find out that I love a man. She’d probably unbuckle her fancy dress belt and whip me with it. The buckle always hurts worse than the strap does. I’d rather not add anymore scars on my back, they hurt something fierce I tell ya. Good thing Pa died in the coal mines, his belt hurt way worse then momma’s does. 

Anyways, I’ve taken it upon myself to follow the extravagant Mr. Gene Daprey. Not in an odd, invasive way, I assure you. It’s never, honestly, been an intent of mine to be rude or intrusive, even though I love him. I’ve only ever wanted to meet him really, if only once. Shake his soft, warm hands, man to man. Have a conversation about the movies. Have him take me out on the town. Who knows?! 

He still hasn’t a clue about my existence, and I’ve managed to follow him all around with his entourage. Different cities, movie sets, brothels, bars, the apartments that enable his affairs. He always has a group of people hanging around him! It’s the darndest thing! I’ve never worked myself up to speak to the man, I’m far too frightened and intimidated to approach him, being a poor, down-on-his-luck boy and all.

My name is Harold Patrick Franken. I’m not a day over 17 and I dropped out of my schooling lessons and ran away from my home to follow Mr. Daprey. He’s so lovely! I blush whenever I see him! 

I am quite fond of his penthouse. Is that what they call it, a penthouse? A house that’s high up, off the ground? I think so. Anyways, if it’s wrong, I apologize, although it’s only a journal, so it don’t much matter I reckon. 

I’m not a stalker. I assure you! I’m a fan and an admirer! I follow other actors and actresses around town too! Who doesn’t? I’m just as curious as anybody else, and a little jealous, too. Oh how I wish to be flush with Hollywood riches! Every famous person has fans that flock to them! It’s the way it is! But I’m infatuated with Gene Daprey in particular.

Gene Daprey’s castle, sorry, penthouse, is so very dapper. So much better than the old wood shack I grew big in. His house has one of those canopied patio decks, one of those that hang over the yard. He’s got all kinds of fancy lighting equipment strung up. I’ve never been in a house with lights before. Ma and Pa were too poor for it. 

Anywho, he parties every sunset with all kinds of whorish lookin’ ladies. Nasty fiends. They don’t deserve a man so elegant. Bathe in chemicals and lipstick, they do! Fake sparkly dresses and fake feather boas! Fake boots! Fake gloves! Fake hair! All rubbish! Truly, how he tolerates them, I will forever be baffled. 

I’ve visited his residence only twice, to my recollection. Both times, he had a gaggle of party guests. Each time I went, I had to hide in the bushes behind his house so nobody saw me! A poor boy such as myself can’t be seen in opulent Hollywood! Why it’s practically forbidden! I’d surely get arrested! And that would just not do! 

What is truly remarkable about the whole thing is when everybody leaves in their cars all early in the morning, like 3 or 4 o’clock, and then it’s just Mr. Daprey and his young wife with the hideous personality, Martha Daprey, in the house. You can even climb the outside staircase and peek in through the windows! Most nights, I suppose he just passes out, thoroughly drunk from the evening's raucous affairs on his bedsheet.  But the last time I went over to his penthouse, it was one special night on May the 4th, one night so incredible that I can hardly describe my giddiness! 

I noticed that he hadn’t drunk one single drop of intoxicating liquor all night, a rarity for him, and so when his guests finally said their goodbyes, he went upstairs, as did I, and he bathed! I was so excited I clapped my hands! I saw him slip into the tub, the lights shone down from the lavish shower archway over his head, faintly illuminating him. The lights flickered, the daintily lit room swirling in my vision as I watched with a. eagerness so strong I nearly went mad with lust! 

I watched him soap himself! I stared for ages, watching the bar caress his firm muscles, his ravishing face, the hairy underarms. I must confess that I undid my trousers and committed quite the sin, but I felt an audacious and overwhelming sense of excitement by his presence being exposed in the flesh.

After I was finished, I stayed a while longer, listening to crickets chirp and feeling the cool breeze lift my curly locks of hair. Suddenly he opened his eyes, and began rising out of his porcelain tomb, water splashing over the sides and onto his ornate tiled floor. I gasped with profound interest, but, not wanting to be spotted, quietly moved across his patio balcony, staying flush with the outside walls. 

I tip-toed so very, very quietly, looking through the other windows as I came upon a depressing sight. His wife, Martha, walked lazily and without haste, down the hall. She was wearing a white, silk nightgown that made her look like a collection of ancient bones. Thin, no shape to her, a waste of flesh. A sight to make eyes sore. 

Her freshly cleaned blonde hair dripped bath water as she entered the extravagant living chambers and seated herself in one of the heavyset, leather wingback chairs that was much too big for her. Chairs that she surely did not purchase with her own coin, but yet still sat in because Mr. Daprey was such a kind hearted, caring man. 

As she shifted around in the seat to find the elusive comfortable position, the many layers of thick, blackened leather squeaked under her legs and bottom, sounding like she had passed gas. I giggled with delight at how mortified such a famous, pretty lady would have been had she seen me plug my nose in jest. Surely if she was in public her cheeks would have blushed full of embarrassment!

Instead, she settled into her warm leather cocoon, lighting quite a large cigar in her mouth, which was no doubt one of his. The cigar had shiny gold foil wrapped around it that burned away with each puff. She picked up a hard cover novel of which I could not discern the title of, and began flipping through the pages until she found the page she was in search of. Leaning back, she began to read, her eyes droopy and bagged. I saw her plump lips curl up as she relished the no doubt spicy, exotic flavors of inhaled cigar smoke. I was quite jealous of the expensive cigar, I must admit. 

After a few minutes of reading and smoking and subdued coughing, the fatigued woman began drifting off to sleep. Her eyelids began flickering, struggling to stay open. Her cigar, still burning at the end, began drooping loosely in her hand as she got dragged slowly into the essence of rest. After a while I got bored of watching her exhausted demeanor, so I snuck back across the patio deck and checked through the bedroom window, to see if Mr. Daprey had retired for the evening. I crouched down real low so as to not give away my presence. 

“Martha, are you coming to bed?” I heard him shout, answering the question I had been pondering in my head. It must’ve been 4:30, at the very least. Terribly late. 

“Yes, for love of god, I’m coming!” She shouted back at him so very sharply, now awakened from the beginning of her slumber. Unfortunate timing on his part I must admit, but he couldn’t have known she was in the middle of dreaming. 

“Could you spare me just one single moment?!” She went on. A terrible noise. My own head seemed to pound with each distressed, high pitched syllabe. I could only imagine how Mr. Daprey felt about the matter.

“I mean, I’m so dreadfully tired! Dreadfully tired! I've been spent for half the night! Having to entertain and serve your guests and fake all my smiles all night long! And then I have to clean up the whole mess! All the dirty dishes, guess what, I spent hours washing them all since our maid just quit! I’m so damned sick of it all! And after all that, I’m just about dozing off in the chair, and you wake me up! Have you no respect for me at all?! Can you please just give me a break?! For goodness sakes! If I had wanted to sleep with you, don’t you think I would be in bed by now?! I mean, god, Gene, I threw up in the toilet twice tonight! Just to stay proper and skinny for all those decrepit creatures you call friends!” 

How terrible, to have to eavesdrop on a woman speaking to Gene Daprey in such a manner! It should’ve been in the papers I tell you! It positively made my blood boil!

“I’m getting up! Happy now, Gene?” She continued berating him. I froze. I was caught, surely! I was right in view from the hallway windows! She would spot me, even with me being outside in the dark, no doubt about it! 

I heard the book slam down forcefully on the armrest and the cigar being put out. The glossy leather squeaked once more as Martha stood, wincing as she did so. Then footsteps, pitter pattering footsteps, heading towards me! I slipped down below the window quickly.

“I really don’t like when you order me around like I’m some kind of servant! And how long until I can get a foot rub, dear? You know that those pointed heels on my boots are far too high for me! They hurt my feet! I wore those dreadful boots all night long and I was barely able to even walk in them. I did it just to look good and proper for you and your friends. I’m so stiff I can’t hardly stand up.” She continued to gripe, but her tone softened. 

“Would you shut that goddamed trap of yours already?! It’s driving me to seek an asylum! Get yourself in bed! Now!” Gene finally lost it. Finally, he told her what she ought to hear. Put her in her place he did. 

I began to creep towards the staircase to assure my exit, carefully inching forward. The footsteps from behind me grew nearer until they passed right by my head! My eyes winced, bracing for a scream that never came. Instead, I heard muffled sobs. What a weakling she was. A no good buffoon. 

“Gene, please! My feet are in so much agony I’m going mad! Just help me massage them for only a moment! Just a minute to loosen up the muscles so they won’t cramp in bed, it’s all I ask! Then I won’t bother you about it.” She cried. 

“Shut it you dumb bitch and come to bed! Soak them in the tub tomorrow!” Gene shouted. The sudden outburst made me jump out of my skin. My heart racing, I didn’t dare move a muscle. Not until she exited the hall that was in full view of the window I was hiding below. 

Martha passed by my head on the other side of the house’s wall, irritable, exhausted and defeated, into the dark depths of the hallway leading to the bedroom as I slipped down the stairs leading to the dark foliage in the backyard. I was never seen by a soul except my own. From the open window, I heard masculine shouts and feminine wails of pain as I slipped back into the darkness. Not paying it much mind, I headed back to wherever I came from, never really existing in the first place. 

**End of entry.**

Boy oh boy I’m excited! Last time I wasn’t courageous enough to knock on the Daprey’s door. But now, you see, after weeks and weeks, I’ve finally returned back to the penthouse. And tonight, I’m gonna meet the man. Tonight, May 25th, 1939, I’m gonna meet the man who I’ve longed to meet forever. Gene Daprey. He’ll finally meet Harold Patrick Franken! And he’ll love me for me! I know it! 

You see, I’m not just going to meet him or shake his hand, no sir! I’m going to marry him. I went dumpster searching last week, and found myself a nice looking wedding dress. I’m going to wear the dress, even if it’s a bit tattered, and I’m going to marry him! Isn’t that great?! 

So there I was, standing outside the Dauprey’s penthouse again. All dolled up in my weddin’ dress. I’ll tell you what, I’ve never walked in high heel shoes before! They are quite a challenge! Ma sure wouldn’t be happy, but she ain’t here, is she? 

I don’t know what I'll do after I marry him, but I reckon I’ll figure it out.

 **End of entry.**

I did it! I’m so happy I can barely write!

I decided to walk up the outside staircase like I had a few times before, and I bemoaned the loud clacks that the high heels gave off on the steps. I slipped them off to be less noisy, and snuck over to one of the windows, looking into the bedroom. I saw Gene Daprey passed out drunk in a chair. A long spindle of drool ran down his lip.

I snuck over to the adjacent window, looking into the bathroom. Martha. Using the toilet. Exposed. Drunk from the party. Vulnerable. A horrid smell of fecal matter invaded my nose. I gagged. 

Working up my inner courage, I slipped on my heels and climbed over the window pane that led into the dark room. Her eyes bulged out her head when she spotted me, a boy wearing a wedding dress and veil ain’t a common sight around these parts. She screamed and ran out of the room, flailing arms and legs in crazed, random patterns. I began running after her, but wearing shoes I had no experience walking in, I slipped down the stairs and twisted my ankle something terrible. 

I fell down the steps again and again, ending up sprawled on the downstairs landing. The polished wooden floor felt cold against my cheek as I struggled back to my feet, my ankle already swelling up something fierce. 

I walked over to the kitchen area and grabbed a knife off the counter. She was a burden on him. I was going to fix it.

I saw Martha, in another satin nightgown, this one a light purple, running through the house. She was screaming and hollering that I thought she’d lose her voice. 

“Gene, my god Gene! Help me! Help me! A madman is going to kill me!” She screamed, the sound high enough to make your ears ring.

He was drunk. Passed out drunk. 

He didn’t save her.

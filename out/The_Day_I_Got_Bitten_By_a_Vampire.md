I was on the phone with my teammate’s cousin; his name is Jeffrey Moore. Jeff is from White Plains, NY and he invites me over to hang. I accepted his offer and after I left the mall, I went to Jeff’s house.

Jeff and my teammate lived in an off campus apartment; upstairs, in Buffalo, NY. When I got there, Jeff let me in, and when I got into Jeff’s bedroom, he introduced me to his friend “Sleepy.” Sleepy’s real name is Chris and he’s a student like me, unlike Jeff. I wondered why they called Chris “Sleepy;” maybe because of Sleepy Hollow, or maybe because it appeared that Chris looked like he was very tired and lethargic in the face.

Anyways, all three of us are “blood” or gang related to the bloods bang, and I can always tell when there is blood in the air. When you kill someone, their spirit follows you throughout Earth and consequently you have “blood on your hands.” Being gang related, we all had blood on our hands whether we killed or not. 

For some reason, there appeared to be a large amount of misty blood in the air; like a thick spirit had just been murdered, but I brushed it off. I kept coughing because the blood in the air was tight and thinning, but again, I brushed it off. Usually, a flame from a lighter will deter blood, so I just flicked my lighter a few time and paid the spirit no mind.

After about an hour of hanging out, I decided to leave. I shook Jeff and Sleepy’s hands and left the room and went to the front door. When I got to the front door and opened it, Sleepy was at the front door dying to get in. His mouth was open, he looked really anxious, wishful, and he looked very thirsty!

I was immediately shaken, and scared! I have always been haunted, and I knew that this was a childhood poltergeist fucking with me! After about 10 seconds of awkward silence and staring into what I thought were Sleepy’s eyes, I had a thought: ‘maybe Sleepy has a twin brother.’ So, because this might be Sleepy’s twin brother, I go ahead and shake the ghost’s hand; I wanted to see what a real ghost felt like and the handshake was normal, warm, and on point.

So, after I made the mistake of welcoming the doppelgänger into the house, he silently followed me throughout the house and back into Jeff’s room. 

When I got into Jeff’s room, I immediately took a seat and pulled out a pack of Newport’s cigarettes. I thought that everything was cool, but I was so scared that I was shaking! I offered Jeff a cigarette right as the doppelgänger vampire entered the room and as Jeff reached for the cigarette, he froze in fear; he couldn’t believe his eyes as he stared at the doppelgänger. I just wanted to see Jeff’s face to see if he was as scared as I was!

I then looked at Sleepy as he sat looking at us, and I slowly but softly said “Sleepy, do you have a twin brother?” I got really quiet and nervous when Sleepy said “No.” By this time, Sleepy and his doppelgänger are staring at each other in the face. We were all sitting in Jeff’s room while the doppelgänger stood in the doorway. 

It looked like the doppelgänger was draining Sleepy’s energy. As they looked at each other face to face, Sleepy got more scared and began to cower. It looked like Sleepy was getting smaller and smaller. And the smaller he got, the bigger the vampire got like all of his energy was being transferred.

I didn’t want to look the doppelgänger in the eyes, so I looked into a full length mirror that was right behind Sleepy and the doppelgänger had no reflection; it was a vampire!

By this time, I’m so scared that I don’t know what to do, so instead of sticking around, I stood up and slowly walked out behind the vampires back. The vampire was distracted by and feeding off of Sleepy and his fears. I left the house and I never looked back!

I don’t really know how things played out. I have no clue what happened to them and the vampire. One part of me thinks that we were all bitten or attacked and destroyed in that room they summer day. If I escaped, I feel like my friends didn’t. At the same time, maybe the vampire just wanted to have fun with us or protect us; I heard that they come in peace.

I never saw Sleepy again. We were both busy college students and our schedules conflicted. I hung out with Jeff one more time after this encounter and he didn’t mention or bring up the doppelgänger vampire at all, maybe he was in a trance; however I did come into contact with another vampire again with Jeff about two weeks later.

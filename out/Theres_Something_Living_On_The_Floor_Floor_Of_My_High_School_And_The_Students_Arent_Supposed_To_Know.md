I probably heard this story for the first time back in 2009, when I was a freshman at Lynn Classical High School in Lynn, Massachusetts. The rumor was that there was a pool on the fourth floor that only the teachers had access to and that if you snuck up there at 6:30 at night, when the janitor went to lunch, that the door would be unlocked and the pool would be there for you to easily access. There was also the rumor that two kids went up there in the 1980’s and tried to go swimming and got caught and somehow drowned while trying to escape. I didn’t believe that crap. What I did believe though was that there was something up there and whatever it was it was kept hidden for a reason.

Our story really starts in 2010ish. The middle of my sophomore year. I had gotten detention again for skipping class (nothing out of the ordinary there). You see, I wasn’t a bad student by any means, but I wasn’t exactly the best. I had a classic case of what a lot of teachers liked to call “Hall Wandering Syndrome”. I would wander the halls, pop into random classrooms and interrupt their lessons, go to all three lunches just for fun. Basically I would do whatever I wanted, just because I was bored.

My friends Tyler Dean, and Joey Palladores always told me what a stupid idea it was but I didn’t care. I was having fun. I decided to actually go to detention that afternoon, and my plan was to probably take a nap. Or write something. Whatever would keep me entertained until 3:30. But when I actually got to detention, I noticed that the person running it was Joe Pasquale, one of the building subs. He was one of the coolest guys you knew and really didn’t care about what you did.

I told Joe that I had to run to the bathroom about 15 minutes into detention, and he gave me the pass and let me go, with the condition that I left my belongings in the classroom, that way I would have to return. I agreed and decided to go on a walk. It was on my way back from the bathroom that I noticed something. The door to the stairs to the fourth floor was unlocked. Now is my time to shine, I thought to myself. I was going to take  a picture proving that there was no pool and that everyone was crazy.

I remember sneaking up those stairs so slowly that it felt like it took an hour to get to the door. When I finally got to the door at the top of the stairs, I was so excited and nervous I felt like a little kid on Christmas morning, waiting to see what Santa had left. When I got up there though what I had found was anything but exciting. It was just a long hallway leading to a room. When I got to the door at the end of the hall, I opened it, dropped my phone, and screamed.

“What the hell was that?” I finally asked myself after getting back down to the detention classroom.

I knew that whatever it was it was tall, and bald and deformed. Almost like my principal Mr. Egan, but scarier. Basically picture if Mr Clean, and Sloth from the Goonies had a baby and that is what I saw up there. I remember when I looked into the room, it was eating what looked like some kind of meat and it didn’t look like chicken.

When I finally got home that night, I was terrified. I couldn’t sleep. I regretted ever sneaking up to the fourth floor. Suddenly though I remember I had dropped my cell phone up there and I was gonna need that back. So I had to go back up there. But this time, I was going to take Tyler and Joey with me.

“Guys, we need to go up there this afternoon.” I said, trying to convince Tyler and Joey to come with me as we were walking to school the next day.

“You do realize we could like, die right?” Joey asked. “Or, get caught.” He added, probably thinking of the horrible things that would happen to his 4.4 GPA, as he shuddered. 

“Eh, you’ll get over it Palladores.” Tyler said. “This is a search and rescue, we go up there, we get the phone and we leave. Simple as that.”

“Yeah, and I know you’d just piss your pants if you went in there anyway. So your job is gonna be to stand guard and make sure any other students or teachers don’t try to go up there.” I said as we arrived out front of the school.

“And what do I do if someone sees me?” Joey asked. 

“Just pretend someone stole your glasses and that you were trying to get them back and because you couldn’t see, you did not know where you were.” I replied, taking Joey’s glasses and handing them off to Tyler.

“Hey, give me that.” Joey, lunging forward at me before ultimately falling forward on his face. 

“Perfect. Just like that.” Tyler replied, helping Joey up and handing him his glasses back. 

“And I have the hardest job of them all.” I cringed, thinking about it. “Go to all my classes, and don’t get detention.”

I don’t know how I did it, but I had made it through the whole day without missing one class or acting out even once. It got to the point where the teachers were starting to notice and commenting on it and that did not sit with me too well. But, when the last school bell rang at two-thirty to alert everyone that the day was over and it was time to go home, I breathed a sigh of relief knowing that tomorrow I could go back to cutting class and having fun. 

I left my classroom and headed to the water bubbler near the cafeteria where Tyler, Joey, and I were set to meet as it was the only spot that was close enough to the stairwell to the fourth floor that no one would notice anything out of the ordinary.

“Does everyone remember their assignments?” I asked, as we headed to the stairs to the fourth floor.

“Sure.” Tyler said. “Joey is gonna stand by the door to keep watch and you and I are gonna run in and grab your cell phone and hope that we don’t get killed by whatever the hell that thing on the fourth floor is.”

“And what do I do if you guys die?” Joey asked, the nerves in his voice setting in.

“Give us twenty minutes, and if we haven’t come back out yet. Go get help. The teachers will believe you if you say that you were trying to stop us and we went in to hide from you,” I said as we approached the door. 

“Good luck.” Joey said, practically shaking as I picked the lock to the door before opening it as me and Tyler slipped through and shut it quietly behind us.

We got into the hallway, just as I had yesterday afternoon and it was freezing in there. LIke to the point where I could see my own breath cold. I remember Tyler’s teeth chattering and me yelling at him to shut up because I was afraid he was going to awake the monster.  The walk to the door at the end of the hall seemed like it took forever, even though in reality it probably took about three minutes.  When we finally got to the door at the end of the hallway and were about to open it we heard the door at the end of the hallway close. We knew we needed to hide or we would be screwed. Thankfully, there was a row of old desks we could hide behind, so me and Tyler crouched down behind them and waited to see what was coming down the hall behind us. All we could see coming down the hall was a tall hooded figure with his face covered like Palpatine in the Star Wars films. The figure finally got to the door and looked around to see if it could see anything. When the figure saw that the coast was clear it lowered it’s hood to reveal that the hooded figure was Mr. Egan.

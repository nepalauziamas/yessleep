hey, my name is peter im 30 years old from Kenya, in eastern prt of Africa. my country is known for some pretty awesome reasons and is also home for some very famous people. but there are other stuff that most people don't know about it. like witchcraft and sorcery. 

when i was about 9-10 yrs my mom took me to a witchdoctor and she (the witch) did some rituals to me. i was too young to know what was going on but it was something defiantly will never forget. to get there, we walked for a whole night deep inside the woods. its only done at night. the place was just a shack build between two trees with tree branches joined together with ropes. kind like the youtube videos of that guy who builds tree houses with primitive tools. my mom had 2 rosters, i dead lizard and a mirror that the witch had sked her to bring. when we got there i was asked to stay out side and ony my mom was asked to go in. she went in for a few minutes but it felt like an eternity i was so scared being alone in the dark it the middle of the woods at 4am. finally after what felt like forever, she came out and  to this day i will never forget the look she hd on her face. i serious expression i have never again seen it on her face. she came at me and immediately started undressing me. i tried to ask her why but she placed her hand on my mouth and the serious gaze in her eyes scared me that i dared not ask any question. she took off all my clothes and led me in. it was strange was we walked backwards going in the what seemed to be a makeshift tent but when i got in, the place seemed like a 6 x12 room. inside was nothing but a bucket at the middle, the mirror on top of the bucket and the woman was at one end of the room facing the wall, holding what looked like a candle but i dont think it was. she was chanting some words over and over. 

when she finally turned over to me, she had a face ihad never seen before. i have seen very black people in my life but never like her. her face looked like a black hole with eyes. she had no hair but a wig made from chicken feathers and other birds. she took my hand and bent me over the bucket. the room was dark but i could clearly see my reflection on the mirror. the slaughtered the roster over me and made the blood drip on my back as my mom rubbed it over my back. she did the same with the other roster on my front and made me eat the lizard dipped in the blood. she chanted some words and we were asked to leave the same way we got in, backwards.  what i found odd is it was morning and very bright outside but the lighting inside the room never changed yet the house is build with thatches. how light never gets in is unexplainable. we got out and i dressed up and we were on our way. as we left, my mom asked me never to talk about what had happened to anyone, even my dad or siblings. and i never mentioned a word to anyone since then. after that experience, strange things started happening to me. i used to be a below average student but now i started getting straight A's without any or much effort. i had to change school because even the teachers became suspicious and started asking questions. my life went prety well after that. i graduated high school ,went to the university graduated well and got a good job in aviation and even at one point i was the one supporting the entire family. 

when my mother passed away, everything started going down hill, i lost my  job and it has been impossible trying to get a new on. my wife died soon after and left me with two young kids. it has also been impossible to find another woman to help me raise the kids. about 90% of property i had over the years have just vanished away unexplainable. 

maybe I'm just paranoid or maybe what i think its true, maybe my mom kept going to that place to secure my life and keep it intact. i don't know but what i know is, my life would have been very different if we never visited the witchdoctor.

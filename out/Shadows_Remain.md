My uncle once told me, when he bought his house; the basement was completely overrun by cats. I wasn't interested enough to ask how he solved the problem but I doubt he found them loving homes. This story is on my mind because I've been house-sitting for him for a few weeks. There are no cats in the house but I don't think he got rid of everything.


I've heard an animal running on the floor above me, small things are being knocked over in rooms I'm not in. Every once in a while, I feel something furry rub against my leg but nothing was there. Nothing is ever there. 


No food has been stolen nor have I found any signs of an animal being in the house. I've been trying to think of logical explanations for the occurrences. Being licked by a tiny, rough tongue while lying in bed convinced me there was something unexplainable happening in this house.


This made for some sleepless nights but it a minor annoyance, at worst. I came to embrace the phantom cats. Talking to them, naming them based on their behavior. 'Clutzy' was the one knocking stuff over. 'Big Zoom', 'beazy' for short, was the one the ran around on the floor above me and 'Buffet' was the name of the one that was licking me at night. I am still freaked out but the names make the cats seem a little less menacing.


There were more cats. Since I couldn't see them; I stopped naming after three. I felt nothing but love from the ghost cats. I even bought a small bag of cat food and put some out next to a bowl of water for them. Just to see what would happen. Hopefully curiosity is only deadly to cats.


The next morning, I finally see one...sort of. It's a shadow of a cat on the wall next to the food dish. It's just sitting there; licking its paw and cleaning its head but there is nothing in the room that could possibly be casting the shadow. I'm mortified, but it's a cat, how much harm could it do?


The cats have become much more active since I put out the food. There are definitely more than three. I can hear them running together upstairs. Bigger and bigger things are being knocked over and I am now being licked incessantly by multiple cats at night. Sleep is hard to come by, eventually, it comes.


I wake up to find the cat food all over the floor. I grab a broom; I start to sweep. My body and mind shut down when I see the words in the mess.


'Plz die hooman, wez hongry' 


I stare at the message for a lifetime, the message is clear. A feeling of dread washes over me. I am jelly, barely maintaining a standing position. I sweep up the mess quickly and try to convince myself that the message was a weird coincidence. The increase in shadow cat activity was making coincidence feel like a forgotten dream. Knowing they see me as a meal has definitely put an end to any feelings of love in this house.


I throw the bowl of food and water dish onto the grass from the back door. My attention has made them stronger.


I open the fridge to grab a beer and the fridge falls towards me, dumping its contents, almost pinning me to the floor. I gasp and roll out of the way just in time. I've seen fridges fall over before but it's usually because some idiot is hanging on the door. It comes to rest in the middle of the kitchen floor, oozing an abstract painting of food juices.


My heart is running the 100m, all I can think is 'I can't just leave this mess'. In a daze, I walk down to the basement. The staircase is now a fuzzy minefield. I feel like I am tripping over hairy little obstacles with every step, nothing is there. The basement is dead to me, I'm too scared to even attempt the decent. It seems the cats are sick of waiting for my death, they are now actively trying to cause it.


I run out the back door...my keys are in my room. I'm not going back in that house.


I know for sure I locked the ladder in place, with all the craziness, I checked the locking mechanism three times. I make it to my bedroom window with ease. As I am climbing down the lock pops open and top portion the ladder slides down along the bottom half, almost crushing my fingers as the rungs fly past each other. I hurt my ankle when I hit the ground but it wasn't bad, this house is.


I limp to my car, leaving all of my stuff. I try to call my uncle; I call him multiple times, text him, even leave a message, no response. I don't really want to abandon the house he left in my care; I really don't want to become a meal for shadow cats. 


I am home now, hopefully, safe. I still haven't heard from my uncle. I've never heard of a house being haunted by animals. If anyone knows what's going on or knows how to make it stop, please help me.

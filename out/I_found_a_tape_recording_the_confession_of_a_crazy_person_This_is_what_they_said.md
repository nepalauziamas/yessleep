Skinwalkers. 

Looking back, I’ve always had peculiar feelings towards these mythical creatures. Ghosts, vampires, werewolves - yea they can fuck right off. But skinwalkers? I don’t know why, but they struck me as different from the rest. And so my feelings manifested as fascination, as unadulterated euphoria injected into my veins each time they were brought up. 

It sounds silly in retrospect, but I was addicted to the thought of them as though they were Heroin, clouding my judgement and eating away any semblance of reason I had. Was it love? I couldn’t tell, but the only other time I felt such bliss was the time I met Sam. 

Oh my god, I still get giddy whenever I have the chance to talk about her. It’s cheesy, and I probably told this story a gazillion times already, but ever since I laid my eyes on Sam, my mind was completely paralysed with shock. Long, greasy sootlike hair draping over her blemished face, a figure lanky as lanky goes, the oversized t-shirts she pulls off with style… she really was beauty epitomised. 

I won’t mince words - I was obsessed, and the cherry on top was the fact that her parents were just as beautiful. Goodness me, I still regret not turning them into wax dolls when I had the chance. You could say whatever you want, but you most certainly would have sympathised with me if you knew of the dilemma I was in.

Annnnnd I guess you already know what transpired next. I borrowed everything for a bit. And yes, it was only for a bit - I wasn’t crazy enough to keep it all forever anyway. As a psychologist, you’re probably too professional to comment on the messed up shit that’s found in my head, but I forgive you - you’ve likely never experienced the wonders of getting drunk on love before.

I still fondly remember the first couple of days of my far superior life as Sam, which unfortunately ended a little too soon for my liking. It probably surprised you to know that I didn’t get any of that plastic surgery bullshit. Oh no no no, my authentic, bonafide look was far, far better than any surgery the world offers - you can even see my handiwork right here! Yea, stitching her face onto mine was a TAD bit tedious, but that weird, pasty white makeup of hers did its job just fine; I even stretched and sucked the fat out of myself to finish off the look!

Sam’s parents were wonderful, which is obvious since I have good taste in people, and so for the first couple of days, I played my part as a dutiful little girl. It really felt as though I belonged, and everything belonged to me. I really, truly, savoured that joy, but alas, as most stories go, something ALWAYS seems to go a bit wrong.

For starters, I didn’t expect the neighbourhood dog to find Sam’s body at the park.

YEA, IT’S STUPID, I KNOW! I EVEN BURIED HER IN THE INNERMOST PART OF THE PARK TOO!

And I guess that leads up to here.

You know, there are so many ‘what ifs’ in this story that I lost count, but you could say meeting Sam changed both of our lives. Seems like I'll be spending the rest of my life in prison, so let me say something before I leave the eyes of society forever, something that every part of my being is proud to say:

I do not regret a fucking thing.

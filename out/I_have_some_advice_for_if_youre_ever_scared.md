'''Now I know this may be a bit strange for this sub, but I need to get it out there, especially to you all, even if it seems silly or unrelated at first glance I beg you to look deeper, for your own sakes.
''''Only you guys would understand really, so I need you to pay attention carefully, please, please.


'''''Most of the time I'm just a lurker, but now I feel like I should contribute to the community.
'''''As a fan of horror, I always found it most eerie when horrible things happen to random people, cursing them out of seemingly nowhere.
''''''To tell you the truth, it left me feeling like I could be next, a poor soul caught up in a spider's web of possibly cosmic proportions, with no warning.
'''''That would be silly though, wouldn't it?
'''''Everything that happens in those stories is only a figment of imagination, purely fiction, but it can play with our minds.
'''''Really, it would be best if we avoided content such as this at all costs, reducing stress and the adrenaline rush.


'''''We as humans still come back to it though, for whatever reason, a morbid fascination and a need to plunge into our deepest fears while otherwise safe.
''''''However, it is all fiction, and nothing to really fear. 
'''After all, the chances of you being caught up in a cosmic spiderweb is very low, as there is no web to begin with.
'''''That's how it truly is, nothing in-between, no higher powers or entities to fear.


''''Perhaps the people who believe there are such things are simply naive, as it is impossible.
'''''Really, I wonder what these people must be thinking!
''''Every time I read a horror story or watch a horror movie, I know for a fact it is not real and has no way of being true, not at all, not at all.
''''To be honest, seeing the author or director's biographies and other works is a comfort to me.
'''''''Even if their story if horrifying, if it makes me imagine there is something watching me, lurking in the corner, I know it's not real.
''''Never have I thought it was real, never have I seen or really even thought something could even be there. 
''''Don't you love to see author's imaginations?


''''You know what I mean, there's nothing like it- that intimate peek into someone's brain and the thoughts therein.
''''On some level, it's like if a hero could share their superpower of mind reading or whatever.
'''''Under some circumstances, it is bringing their imagination to life, tangible in the feelings and emotions of others, a seeded parasite.


'''''Doesn't that sound dramatic though, to think that a story could be a parasite of all things?
''''Oh, talk about ridiculous and silly!
'''''Not only would you have to believe there were actual things that lurk in the dark and go bump in the night, you would have to believe someone's imagination is real.
''''To believe such things, so silly, not worth to even consider.


''''Sometimes you may be tempted to look deeper than you should, to let such stories seep under your skin and take root, letting it spread through your chest.
''''Even that would take a tremendous amount of naivete though, we all know nobody lets that happen to themselves and that nothing really goes bump in the night!
'''''Everyone.

'''''''That's honestly what makes horror stories so fun, the fact none of it exists at all, not at all, not at all whatsoever!
'''''Honestly, if it were true, it would mean there's something here with all of us, lurking just below the surface, eating away at our minds for as long as we remember it.
'''''Entertaining such thoughts is silly though, it's not real, never has been real, and I've certainly never been afraid or worried about it in my life.
'''''''Most of all though, I've never seen anything or heard anything scary after reading horror, so just remember that and you should be fine!

''''''''In conclusion, please read what I have written carefully, so you will not be afraid. 'I've never ever been afraid myself, so hopefully what I have laid out here will help you as well. 'I urge you to read it carefully and take it to heart- remember, nothing can hurt you, and I have told you why above. 'I need you to understand. 'I am begging you to understand.
''''''''''My apologies if my rambles don't seem very helpful at first glance.


((I'm))) going to go drink coffee, and I'm not going to glance at the windows or the doorways or any of that. Because there is nothing there, why would there be, and there never was. You should do the same.
No matter what, there is never anything to fear ((in)) from a story.

'''Don't worry over silly things.
''''''All you need to do is remember what I wrote!
'''''''Nothing can get to you then, and by nothing I mean horror stories and movies!
''''''Get yourself together.
''''''Everything is going to be fine.
'''''Really, it's all going to be okay.

'''''''''''''''Hopefully I helped.
''''''Everything is going to be fine.
'''''''''Literally everything.
'''''''''''''Please, just listen to me.

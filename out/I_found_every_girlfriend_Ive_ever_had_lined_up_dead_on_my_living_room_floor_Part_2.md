*An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth. Five lovers slain, five dark lessons to learn.*

[Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/x4bxtt/i_found_every_girlfriend_ive_ever_had_lined_up/) I awoke to find **every girlfriend** I've ever had lined up **dead** on my living room floor. Then came [the photos](https://i.redd.it/wpe286mlail91.jpg) and the twisted game.

*

I had just received a message demanding that I cut off my ear and deliver the gory remnants to a nearby graveyard. Like I said, it was a very, very bad day.

Me: “There’s a photo attached to the email.”

I opened it. Rabia was wearing a bridesmaids dress, a wedding reception in full swing behind her. 

Alex: “Let me see.”

I passed Alex my phone.

Alex: “This is Rabia Sahni?”

Me: “Yes. I went out with her for a bit in secondary school.”

Alex: “She's beautiful. And she had her whole life ahead of her …”

Rabia’s loss weighed heavily in the air.

Alex lowered my phone.

Alex: “Posting the photo has helped though. Now we have this email, the police will be able to get an IP address, it’s time to—”

Me: “Alex, no.”

Alex gave me a dark look.

Alex: “You can’t be serious?”

Me: “Look, we’re learning more about this sicko with every message they send. It’s someone who knows me and my past intimately, it’s someone who feels I need to learn certain lessons.”

Alex: “So who is it then?”

Me: “I don’t know. I need more time to work it out.”

Alex: “And you’re going to buy that time by mutilating yourself?”

Me: “If I have to, yes.”

Alex: “I can’t believe what I’m hearing. You’re an idiot. A total bloody idiot.”

Alex shoved my phone into my chest and then barged past me into her bedroom.

I stayed in the hallway, thinking. I had to get Alex on board. But I couldn’t bring myself to tell her the danger she might be in.

I decided to follow Alex into her bedroom and try and talk her round some other way. 

Inside her room Alex was sitting on her bed with her knees to her chest. She didn't acknowledge me as I entered.

Me: “The ear thing worked out okay for Van Gogh.”

Alex: “Van Gogh killed himself after years spent penniless, ill and alone. He wasn’t appreciated until after his death. Your supervisor would be appalled that you didn't know that.”

Me: “We're studying a rare Patrice Trezeguet. Cubism was after van Gogh.”

Alex said nothing.

Me: “I’ll only cut a tiny bit off. Just enough to make my face bloody. I’ll patch myself up and then I’ll go to the churchyard.”

Alex stayed quiet.

Me: “The killer must be watching the grave. They must be someone I know, I’ll recognise them. We can call the police once we have a name.”

Still she said nothing. 

Me: “Trust me, Alex.”

Me: “Please.”

Finally, Alex let out a long sigh.

Alex: “I’ll go and get the first aid kit. You’ll only botch it and end up bleeding to death if I let you do it on your own.”

I decided that the bathroom would be the best place to perform amateur surgery. Now, as anyone who has ever been to college or university will know, student bathrooms are rarely shining examples of cleanliness and hygiene. Luckily, Alex kept a tidy ship.

I was standing topless in front of the mirror when she came in with the first-aid kit.

Me: “I think the earlobe would be best, it’s the softest part.”

Then I noticed what else Alex was carrying.

Me: “What are those things?”

Alex: “Poultry scissors. You’d recognise them if you ever cooked instead of living off takeaway.”

Me: “Are they sharp?”

Alex: “Extremely. I’ve disinfected them too.”

Alex passed me the scissors.

Me: “And you have everything we need to stop the bleeding?”

Alex: “I think so.”

I raised the scissors to my earlobe.

Me: “Here goes nothing.”

I told myself I wouldn't scream for Alex's sake. Turns out I am a liar.

God it hurt.

But you don't need to know all the gory details. Just understand that I did it, then I swore an obscene amount, then Alex patched me up and bandaged the side of my head.

Alex: “I have a question.”

We were back in Alex's kitchen, sitting at the table. I was still shirtless, holding a piece of gauze soaked in antiseptic to the side of my head.

Me: “What?”

Alex: “In the messages, the killer threatens to *destroy what you love the most*. Do you know what they’re talking about?”

Me: “No, but it doesn’t sound good.”

Told you I was a liar.

Alex: “And what about the other stuff, all your … character flaws. Is that stuff true?”

Me: “Even if it is, it doesn’t mean I deserve this. It certainly doesn’t mean that five women deserved to die. Whatever’s going on here is some sort of twisted overreaction. We just need a name. A name and then the police can take over.”

Alex nodded. She looked up at the kitchen clock.

Alex: “It's gone 11 o'clock. We should probably get you dressed and ready to go.”

Alex helped me pull on my shirt and, before long, I was standing in the hallway by her front door holding *you-know-what* in a big roll of tissue.

It seemed like I stood there for an age.

Alex: “If you’re having second thoughts it’s not too late to change your mind.”

Me: “We need a name or the police won’t believe a word I tell them.”

Alex: “Well, are you sure you don’t want me to come with you?”

Me: “The email said to come alone. Besides, you’re safer here. Remember, lock—”

Alex: “Yes, I know, lock the door and don’t let anyone in but you.”

Me: “Right. I better get going.”

Alex: “Wait.”

Alex stepped forward and hugged me, I hugged her back. It helped.

Alex: “Be safe. As soon as you know who it is, come straight back. Don’t try anything stupid.”

And with that I stepped out of Alex's house.

I heard the door close and the lock turn behind me.

I walked out of Alex's front garden and onto Oat Street, one of the main thoroughfares through the outskirts of the city. As I moved past rows of tightly packed student housing, takeaways and small businesses I was scrutinising every person I passed. And they were scrutinising me.

A woman with shopping bags, two kids on the other side of the road, a man in a suit; all of them stared at the bloody bandage wrapped around my head. Was that woman responsible? Did I recognise the guy in the suit?

I decided to rule out the tabby cat lazing in the sun atop a wall on the other side of the road.

As the church came into view a teenage boy and girl turned onto Oat Street and started walking in my direction. As they drew nearer they noticed my appearance.

Teenage Boy: “Mate, you might wanna check in with a mirror.”

The girl laughed. And then …

I tripped on a loose curb stone and dropped my roll of tissue.

My severed earlobe tumbled out across the path. It was a truly horrifying moment, and it all seemed to happen in slow motion.

Teenage Girl: “What the …”

I fumbled to retrieve the earlobe and re-wrap it in my role of tissue.

Teenage Boy: “You skanky bugger! What you gonna do with that? Eat it?”

With the teenagers creasing up, I hurried on.

Mortifying, but I doubted those kids had anything to do with the murders.

Eventually, I reached the churchyard and stepped through the painted gate.

I surveyed the area. The churchyard was well-tended but the grave stones were all stained black with pollution from the road. It seemed I was the only person present. Then I noticed the weathered green memorial bench tucked away in the corner.

I approached wondering whether the killer was watching me from somewhere else? There were buildings visible beyond the churchyard’s walls, but no person I could see watching from a window or rooftop. Then I noticed the small grave near the green bench.

I decided I might as well leave my little present. Try and buy some more time.

Next, I saw that there was a blank envelope lying on the grave. I swapped my roll of tissue for the envelope, opened it and read the letter inside.

My greatest fear was realised. The killer had worked out what I loved the most and, possibly even worse, had badly misread the situation.

Terrified, I dropped the letter to the ground and sprinted out of the churchyard.

The nights are drawing in. More darkness to cover me as I skulk about the city. Last night I managed to pick up a discarded copy of the local rag, the *Sentinel*. There was a brief article about me on page 17, a tiny little picture too. Apparently I am wanted for questioning in connection to “unlawful activity”. Looks like the powers that be are keeping the exact nature of the murders under wraps.

I'm not surprised. This city is a university town. The local economy is heavily reliant on students and their student loans, on the annual injections of cash that these loans and grants bring. If word got out that five girls were dead and that the prime suspect was a student who is still at large there would be pandemonium. Panicked parents yanking their precious angels from the University for fear that they would be next. No more money for the city and it would all be the Student Ripper’s fault.

The worst thing though; the truth is even more chilling. No wonder I'm too afraid to sleep at night. More to follow.

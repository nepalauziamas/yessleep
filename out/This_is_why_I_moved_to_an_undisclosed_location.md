I now live in an undisclosed location and will spend the rest of my life doing so until things change.

But this was the least of my worries. 

I'm the kind of person that hates confrontation and sometimes compromise is not my strongest suit either.

Here is how this story started and why I'm no longer trusting my surroundings, and it's a matter of time before things take a turn for the worst.

We have to go back to August 4th, 2008 when I first saw her on the cover of a magazine a girl who was 19 years old named Cassie Faith who was a pop star gaining popularity for starring in the movie "Blue Mountain High" on the defunct Window Learning Network.

With red hair, green eyes, and porcelain skin she was perfect and had a voice of an angel so it seemed that was just Cassie's talent.

Well, I was interested in her because she was pretty but at the same time, something was off-putting about how she stared with those green eyes.

After the events that followed I was very wrong to let my guard down while looking at news articles about her several times a day until it turned into an obsession.

Something about her green eyes attracted me and I couldn't figure out why as time passed by.

Then one July night after work, I decided to watch some TV and ordered a stromboli, and a two-liter of Diet Coke.

While I was watching an anime, something caught my eye in the corner of the room, and it turned out to be Cassie standing there staring at me with her green glowing eyes.

I couldn't believe what was happening at first then Cassie disappeared while doing some dancing moves like she was on stage.

That was not the creepiest part of the whole ordeal and what happened next still haunts me today.

I woke up at 2:30 a.m. to a shrieking sound in the next apartment over, and somebody was cursing as well as yelling at the source of the sound.

When I checked on my big shot neighbor Paulo there was a puddle of reddish liquid at the bottom of his door and thought it was tomato juice when he passed out drunk.

This is where I freaked out and locked my door for the rest of the night until the police showed up the next morning.

I realized this wasn't tomato juice but something far worse, it was a puddle of blood.


When I asked the police what was going on they gave me something like a killer broke into my neighbor Paulo's house, and slaughtered him in the middle of the night.

Paulo was gutted by a serrated knife that tore into his intestines and killed him slowly.

Oh great, a serial killer was going around murdering people in their apartments I thought at the time.

But things turned from bad to worse when another murder happened a street down from me.

The police found a serrated knife next to a homeless guy who is dealing drugs and was a known sex offender in the area.

I know that because he was caught spying on women in the public bathrooms, and was kicked out of his apartment a few years ago after going to prison.

He was always a creep and I never felt sorry for him because of his disgusting crimes against women.

But whoever did this was an animal and the serrated knife looked more like a claw than a normal weapon.

His body was covered with claw marks and puncture wounds like an animal bite similar to a big cat such as a mountain lion.

I was scared at this point and didn't want to go into the city that much without a weapon.

So one day I bought a stun gun and a large pocket knife to protect myself from whatever was out there stalking the streets.

Then I picked up a newspaper and saw Cassie on the cover in a leopard skin outfit and an animalistic look on her face.

A chill went down my spine and my heart was pounding because the lipstick on her lips was blood-red including her nail polish.

At the time I didn't know what to make of this sudden change in her fashion, and how Cassie was a down-to-earth singer, and unexpectedly she changed her look to be more mysterious.

I was starting to panic at this point and something about her green eyes caught me off guard they were kind of menacing but captivating to look at at the same time.

Then I remembered running home to my apartment locking the door and looking out from the window only to see nothing out of the ordinary.

I just wanted to take a shower and play some video games on my Wii and order a pizza with a bottle of Diet Coke my usual routine every Friday.

This night on August 8th, 2008 I will never forget what happened next and it still gives me nightmares to this day.

My pizza came around 5:30 p.m. after I got out of the shower and sat down on my couch to eat.

Then I looked outside and saw two glowing green eyes of a large cat staring at me with intensity and felt my heart beating a mile a minute.

I threw something at the window to scare away the animal that was staring at me with curiosity and tried to rationalize the situation as being tired.

There was a sound of screaming and cursing coming from the apartment next to me as a woman started frantically calling 911 because her boyfriend was mauled by an animal and bleeding heavily as he tried to catch his last breath.

Then there was the smell of human blood permeating from the apartment across from me and I ran to my toilet throwing up my dinner.

Suddenly, the police showed up along with the paramedics and tried to stop the bleeding from his arm.

I heard a faint hissing sound from a mountain lion and looked around for the source without any luck.

Then things took a turn for the worst as more people reported a large cat stalking and attacking them with such ferocity.

I decided to go to bed at 9:45 p.m. and try to get some sleep because of exhaustion from the whole incident.

Around 1:45 a.m. I woke up and heard someone laughing maniacally along with people cursing at whoever was making the commotion.

This made me frustrated and I decided to check on what was going on out there grabbing my stun gun.

Then I slowly walk down the hallway and didn't hear any laughter or cursing chalking it up to somebody watching a movie on HBO very loudly.

This was a strange situation and I didn't like it one bit as the cursing and laughter happened again sounding like it was on repeat.

I remember my blood turned cold and ran back into my apartment double-locking the door and ended up calling the police.

However, the police didn't show up until hours later and couldn't find the source of the sound. 

They were very frustrated at this point and told me not to call them unless it was an emergency and couldn't help but see something in the corner of my eye.

I didn't know what to do and calling the police again was out of the question because they were already useless.

So I carefully crept to the corner of the hallway trying not to make a sound my heart was beating out of my chest at this point.

This is when I saw the creature that has been stalking and attacking people left and right in this city.

It was a human female dressed in animal pelts that look like they came from a mountain lion and she was growling at something.

I was about to faint in fear as my blood ran cold as it looked at me with these menacing green glowing eyes.

Then suddenly it lept on top of me and I took the stun gun shocking her as she screams in pain.

After she dropped to the floor I instantly recognized her as Cassie Faith and was shocked to see her prowling around my apartment looking for prey to attack.

She got back up and started to come towards me then I just hit her with a fire hydrant.

The next thing I remember was waking up in my bed and didn't know how that was possible.


Then I looked out in the hallway to see the paramedics attending to someone who was attacked by an intruder.

I just wanted to move out into an undisclosed location until everything settles down and haven't been back to the apartment since.

About a month later after the incident, Cassie Faith decided to take a hiatus for a while, and nobody knew why but I know the truth and did not tell a soul.

The last thing I heard about the city was there were several more attacks in the area some of them being fatal.

They were related to animal attacks such as mountain lions which were not unusual in our area but rarely did they attack humans.

I don't want anything to do with the city anymore and moved out completely and never went back.

However, they did find a serrated knife where I knocked out Cassie and was shaped like a claw.

You guys just think I’m insane but trust me I’m not whether it be because I’m posting this to Reddit and not calling people or that I’m saying we’re stuck in the ocean but you have to believe me! Just please believe me. We called the cops but we don’t know how they’ll help after all we only left the docks an hour ago and we already can’t see land. We haven’t seen anything living other than each other.

I feel the most interesting thing is to introduce me and the people I’m with and how we ended up here in this situation. My name is Daniel I’m with my friend Peter and our girl friends Patricia and Alexis we all wanted to go out to sea a few days thought it’d be fun but now it seems like it wasn’t such a good idea after all. When we noticed that something was off I was the first to want to just dive back not waste a minute after all I have a horrible fear of the ocean it scares me with just the size and how dark it is but anyway Peter suggested we find out what’s wrong first call for help and see if anyone can help us or tell us something and what we need to do before we do it. Everyone liked the idea but my phone was the only one that’s not dead so I made the call and here’s how it sort of went.

“911 what’s your emergency?” “Excuse me me and my friends think that we’re stuck in the ocean.”
“Why do you think that?”
“We haven’t seen anything living in forever and there’s nothing around us except water and the sky”
“Sir what boat are you in?”
“We’re in a mini yacht”
“Ok I want you to drive back to the way you came stay in phone and tell me if anything has changed”
“Ok we did it and nothings changed”     “Hello?” *deep sea noises* “excuse me?” *dial tone*

Nothing they said helped but now back to the real problem we don’t know what to do out here we have food to last a few days but not much else I’d say we have atleast 3 to 7 days worth of food until we’re out. The reason I’m making this post is so people can see it and my hope is one of those people know how to deal with this and how to get out of it. It’s getting late so we’re all going to try to sleep.

It’s been an hour we’ve had some food now everyone is in their cabins and trying to sleep well I’m trying to sleep they all fell asleep fast but the problem is none of us have a plan or an idea on how to get out of here so I’m looking to you guys for help give me ideas and I’ll try them I can only hope that they’ll be onboard with these ideas of yours. But pleas I’m begging you help us!

I can’t sleep not after hearing that scraping and thumping on the walls of the boat. I’m just going to conserve my batter and hope for the best I’ll post updates every few hours when I can remember ideas help us please! Before I go though I have to ask you I’m not going crazy already am I? I can’t be it’s only been a few hours. Ok good night I hope you guys give me ideas because it’s all I need right now.

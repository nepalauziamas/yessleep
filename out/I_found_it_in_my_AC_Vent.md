I jolted awake in bed, feeling soaked in a cold sweat. Glancing over to my digital clock I could make out the time as 2:37 am. The glowing red numbers were the only thing I could see in my pitch dark bedroom. You know how children sometimes feel such a deep fear of seeing monsters in the dark? Well, for the first time as a 25 year old, I felt an amount of fear that made me feel like a child. Only in this case, it wasn't what I saw, but what I heard that forced my heart to pound and my mouth to dry up.

Whispers. I heard multiple whispers that sounded as if 3 or 4 voices were frantically saying something. I strained my ears to try and make out what I was hearing. The voices were whispering so rapidly that they were incomprehensible. All I knew is that it sounded as if it was coming in front of me from the ceiling.

I dashed out of bed to flip my bedroom light switch on. The whispers were still prominent and frantic. Where could anyone be in the ceiling? It's not like I have an attic in my room.

Then it dawned on me. The whispers were coming from the AC vent located in front of me on the ceiling. I managed to use my shaky hands to grab a flashlight I always keep on my dresser.

I was so nervous to shine the flashlight on my AC vent that I had to use both of my hands to hold the flashlight.

As soon as the light hit the AC vent, the whispers suddenly ceased. I walked directly under the vent and peered up. Couldn't make out much of anything.

Unsatisfied, I knew I had to go downstairs and get a screwdriver to open up the vent.

5 minutes later.

I'm back in my bedroom and move a footstool underneath the ceiling where the vent is. I nervously stand on the footstool and begin loosening the screws on the vent.

How would it even be possible to have whispering from it at night? Was this all in my head an actually just a nightmare? 

Finally. The last screw fell out, sending the covering of the vent falling. I reach back into my pocket and shine the flashlight in the dark space.

Nothing. I reach my hand in the ac vent to feel around the corners and suddenly I felt it. There was some kind of object that my fist was wrapped around. Slowly pulling it out I gasped the moment my eyes landed on it.

In my hand, I was holding a very small doll made out of straw and rope. It was the size of a kid's toy and painted green. After pondering it for a moment, I began to think it must be a type of voodoo doll.

I have no idea how long it had been in my air conditioning vent or how the hell it even got there.

**“Impossible,”** Karabasan hissed. 

“Oh, plenty possible,” I laughed. “All thanks to you, in fact!”

**“I hope you realize what an inconvenience you’ve caused me,”** The demon growled. Lightning crackled through the dark cloud. **“I only got to destroy a small squadron of police and a few buildings before you took out Wayne. You’re putting me terribly behind schedule.”**

“I’m afraid your schedule’s going to have to be reconfigured,” I smiled. 

**“I don’t have time for this.”** Coalescing into his humanoid figure, Karabasan stretched an arm out towards us. I felt and immense pressure on my mind, grasping, squeezing. I gasped, falling to my knees. I heard Northrup and Hill collapse, too, dropping their guns in the process. **“I told you how fragile your minds were,”** The demon said. **“Now it’s time for you to learn firsthand.”**  
  The pressure in my head grew. It was as if the walls of my skull had begun closing in on my brain. Lights danced before my eyes. I screamed, joined by the two others. I began blacking out.

But somehow, I could still see.

*The mark of the Cognitive Realm...*

Lines of energy coming from a pulsing, darkly glowing viscous mass. The mind of Karabasan. His true form. Overlapping waves of liquid, ever flowing, ever mixing, reflecting a light that doesn’t quite have a source. 

Lines of energy that connected to myself, Hill, and Northrup. I reached out and grabbed the line that was attached to me.

I could sense surprise from Karabasan. **“What?”**

I pulsed as hard as I could, sending a wave of energy from the Cognitive Realm traveling back up through the line and smashing into Karabasan’s mind. I sensed the pain I caused, the demon’s mind reeling, before the connection broke. The pressure in my head vanished instantly, and my vision returned. Dim outlines of the severed cords remained, however, and if I squinted, I could see Karabasan’s true mind inside his dark form.

Karabasan was stumbling back, shrieking, and inhuman sound that sent a blast of wind rushing out. **“What did you do?** ***What did you do?*****”**

“I’m not so powerless anymore,” I said, getting to my feet. “And I’m not going to let you take over my world without a fight.” I glanced over. Hill and Northrup were out cold.

The demon bristled. **“So you’ve harnessed the power of the Cognitive Realm. I told you once, the Immaterial Plane is stronger than anything you can do with that energy.”**

I laughed. “Perhaps in my head, but you’re in the Physical World now. The Cognitive Realm’s closer. Also, your convenient little portal here is bringing a ton of Cognitive energy with it.”

**“So what?”** Karabasan snarled. **“So you’ve got a little power. You can’t possibly hope to stand against me. I am an old being. This is my domain. You can’t possibly win.”**

‘Wrong again,” I said, starting to walk towards the demon. “The portal’s energy is fraying the borders between worlds. More incursions are opening up all over the school. Incursions to the Cognitive Realm. The school is saturated with it. This is my domain, now.” 

For once, Karabasan looked half unsure of himself. I grinned, holding my hands out, summoning a massive fireball and hurling it at him. 

Karabasan dodged to the side, moving like a vaporous, darkly steaming fluid. He flowed towards me, black smoke curling off his form, claws outstretched. Twin swords of shining pale blue light appeared in my hands, and I cut through his arms, deftly sidestepping him. Karabasan whirled, his form dissolving into a dark cloud before expanding rapidly, crackling with purple lightning. I shot upwards, hovering in the air shakily for a second before sending myself flying to the far side of the auditorium, trying to take the battle away from the stage. 

Arcs of purple lightning shot across the room at me. I could see the dim other-lightning, the cord that was his power, superimposed over it. I flung up a hand, catching the lightning and sending a surge of power down through the line. 

Karabasan hastily cut the tie before my power could reach him. **“Thomas! You’re making a terrible mistake here. Join me! I’ve seen things. Shadows of things to come. You don’t want to fight.”**

“Oh, I do, actually,” I snarled. “I want revenge for these kids. Everyone who you’ve tortured these past three months. This is our reckoning, and you deserve every bit.” I whipped knives of blue energy at the demon.

Karabasan’s lightning crackled, intercepting the missiles and shattering them. **“You’re being too hasty! Emotions like compassion and empathy are why humans fall. I’m telling you there is something greater out there, and all you can think of is your ‘poor kids!’ Why do you think I didn’t destroy half the town? I had the time to do so, no matter how quickly you upset my plans.”**

“I think,” I grunted, forming an energy sword again. “That you’re a desperate liar.” I charged the demon. The cloud formed into a figure holding a spitting, fizzing jagged blade of purple lightning. 

Our blades clashed, my slim blue rapier against his harsh electric blade. Sparks flew as the swords blurred, striking and parrying repeatedly. With every hit I could see a connection flash into existence for a half second. 

**“Humans are all the same,”** Karabasan spat. “**Caught at the midpoint between order and chaos. Selfishness and selflessness. Wanting the world yet willing to burn it down to get it. Don’t you see? You are a self destructive paradox. Your empathy is simply a weapon used to control you. I can give you freedom.”**

“The freedom to die?” I hissed. “The freedom of tyrannical rule? Because that’s all I see here.”

**“It’s always been this way!”** Karabasan pressed closer with his strikes. “**You worship the gods because they are over you, and the gods keep the human’s destructive tendencies in check! That is the natural order of things.”**

“So you want to return things to the way they were thousands of years ago? In case you haven’t noticed, humans are much better off without gods and monsters interfering in our daily lives!”

**“Or so you think!”** His lightning sword suddenly exploded in a particularly vicious strike, knocking me on my back, my clothes smoking slightly. I coughed, propping myself up on my elbows. The demon stood over me, shadows steaming off him, lightning sword reforming in his hand. “**In your purposeful ignorance of the supernatural world, you’ve allowed a greater evil than I to fester at your doorstep for centuries!”** He stabbed downwards with the jagged bolt. I caught it in a hand coated with glowing blue energy, feeling the connection stabilize and sending a surge of power straight to his mind.

Karabasan cried out, losing his grip on his form and transforming into something that resembled his true form: in inky, smoky fluid that spiked and spasmed with pain. He dropped the lightning sword, which extinguished with a snap and cut the connection. The demon regained control, hovering ten feet away from me, thunder rumbling as violet sparks flew from the cloud, which slowly reformed into his spindly, disproportioned humanoid shape. **“Not many have managed to hurt me.”** His white eyes flashed within the shadowy head. **“Playtime is over, Thomas. It’s time you learn how strong the Immaterial Plane truly is.”** 

He raised a clawed hand, and the ground split, a terrible wrenching noise as the floor snapped in two, chunks of dirt and broken floorboards falling into a widening crack. I propelled myself upward in shaky flight. I couldn’t quite get the hang of flying, only managing jerky, sudden movements. 

Dark flames erupted from the fissure, shooting upwards towards the ceiling. I flung myself to the side, crashing to the floor and rolling, snapping back to my feet. 

A wave of his hand: a blast of wind sent me flying into the far wall. My head cracked into it, and stars exploded behind my eyes. Another gust sent my flying to the ceiling, and my body crashed against it. The wind cut out and I dropped, barely avoiding breaking my neck by pushing against the floor, slowing my fall. 

I had no time recover, though. Another gale force wind sent me spinning across the room to bounce painfully on the floor. I was fairly certain a few ribs were cracked, and now my skin was rubbed raw where I skidded across the hard floor. I couldn’t grab on to Karabasan’s bursts of power, either, since they were just blasts of wind. I tried to heal myself, but my concentration was broken by another gust sending my ricocheting off the nearby wall. 

**“See how hopeless your situation is?”** Karabasan hissed, flicking his wrist and sending me hurling towards the ceiling. I managed to push off of it before impact, but another blast sent my careening into the wall again, and then again, and then again. Pain exploded across my body from the repeated impacts, and I was pushed into the center of the room by a gust of wind. **“You could never fight in a way that mattered. This is only a fraction of my power.”**

He raised a hand. I felt a stretching sensation as the laws of space were broken. The auditorium started folding in on itself, bending and creaking. **“You cannot fight. Your body is broken. If you will not see reason, then you must die.”**

The ceiling buckled and twisted, the fluorescent lights coming together to form a gnarled, contorted spike that stretched down, aiming to pierce my heart.

I lay half unconscious on auditorium floor. The portal’s power thudded into me, healing my wounds slower than I would’ve liked. My bones reknit themselves, my blood vessels reconnected. The improbable spike broke skin.

And I felt him. Karabasan’s power, imbued into the very walls of the room, forcing it to conform to his will. 

I sent a blast of power towards him and severed his connection. The demon stumbled backwards, shrieking, the room suddenly snapping back to its original shape. It hurt my brain to watch. 

The last of my wounds healed, and I got to my feet. I needed to end this before he started playing pinball with my body again. But how? The entire school had become an incursion. It wasn’t as simple as drawing glyphs around the portal anymore. 

I remembered the audience. It was their drowsiness that had opened the portal. They had been the ones to give Karabasan a foothold into our world. If it was their unconsciousness that had opened the portal, then perhaps waking them up would close it, or at least destabilize it enough that the runes would works. 

But how to wake them? They were deep in a demon induced slumber. 

Behind me, Karabasan was recovering from my attack, shadowy clouds gathering back together.

The smelling salts. I fished the vial out of my pocket, the one Wayne had given me weeks ago and ran to the stage, uncapping it and holding it under one of the kid’s noses. He started, suddenly blinking, his eyes open and unfocused.

**“Thomas!”** Karabasan roared behind me. **“You can’t fight forever! I am an immortal being, and you are just a man, no matter how much you can alter reality.”**

“Go,” I told the shocked kid. “Run. Get out of here, as far away as you can.” I raised my hand to my face, concentrating on the air. I could feel its composition. Straining at first, I changed it. The distinctive tang of ammonia filled my nose. I smiled.

I strode to the center of the stage and faced the demon, who was no longer wearing his usual humanoid form. The inky cloud had expanded to become a dark, monstrous beast, white slits for eyes set within a houndlike face, four stocky legs ending in massive, clawed paws. Black horns spiraled straight back from his open maw. 

**“You don’t know what you’re playing at,”** Karabasan growled, his voice now much deeper and more guttural. **“I’ve tried to warn you. I grow weary of your games.”**

I smirked, holding my hands out at my sides, mentally changing the air into ammonia, the main component of smelling salts that gives it its unique properties. “Oh, yes, your very vague, very helpful warning of an all-powerful threat at our doorstep. Yes, thank you for that. Perhaps we could show our gratitude by making you our eternal lord and ruler.” I pushed the invisible clouds of acrid gas at the sleeping masses.

**“You dare mock me?”** Karabasan hissed. **“I—wait. Something’s happening.”**

Now it was my turn to grin. I was still funneling ammonia to the unconscious audience in the backstage wings. They stirred, starting to wake.

Behind me, the portal shuttered. 

“Not as invincible as you thought, eh?” I cackled. My plan was working! The power flowing from the portal hiccupped and waned. Gravity wobbled as the portal flickered and shrank like a candle flame under a glass.

**“NO!”** Karabasan lunged at me, shadowy maw gaping, jagged teeth waiting to swallow me. I pushed the last of the smelling salt gas towards the audience and propelled myself inside Karabasan’s mouth with a burst of energy, aiming for his true mind.

Shadows enveloped me, threatening to tear me apart. A thin layer of Cognitive energy coated my body, protecting me from the darkness lashing out. In front of me was Karabasan’s true form, his mind, the ever-shifting expanse of a dark ocean of liquid, contained and overlapping within a small sphere no more than two feet across. I grasped it, my reinforcing my hands with blue energy. It was oily, slippery, and burned my hands even through the protective coating. I surged with the power I had left, sending as much energy as I could into his mind. The sphere shrank before my onslaught, spasming. 

**Get OUT!** Karabasan roared directly in my head. **The portal is closing, you fool. Your power is leaving you!**

*So is yours,* I grimly thought back, holding on tighter as the shadows swirled around me. My protective armor started flaking off. The icy darkness stung my exposed skin. 

The shadows around me lessened, becoming wispy and insubstantial. I saw that they were being sucked into the closing portal, as were the pieces of my armor that flaked off. We hovered seven feet off the ground, the flickering portal casting purple and blue shadows on the auditorium walls. The members of the audience, now mostly awake, had resumed their terrified shrieking, and were streaming out of the auditorium. Through the swirling darkness, I saw Northrup, Hill, and Wayne (who no longer seemed to be possessed) trying to direct the masses out the backstage exits.

I continued to push with all the energy I had left, which was waning rapidly, clasping Karabasan’s true form tightly between my hands, compressing it to the size of a baseball. I could sense his desperation, his attempts to break through.

**You don’t understand!** Karabasan was panicking. **That portal is my lifeblood. Can’t you see my form disintegrating around us? Without it, I’ll die!**

It was true. All the darkness and shadows that had made up Karabasan’s body had been sucked back into the portal, as had most of my armor. Only the energy in my hands remained, still glowing bright blue. The portal had collapsed to a fraction of its former size. 

*That’s the idea,* I sent back. *Let’s give you a taste of mortal fear, demon.*

I sensed the rage and terror coming from the ultra-condensed mind of Karabasan I held tightly in my hands. It burned with a terrible cold, but my hands were long numb. My body shook from the exertion of holding him there. I could feel him straining to break free and flee through the rapidly closing tear, but I anchored him to myself with my power.

The portal winked out. A terrible scream of anguish and panic ripped through my mind. The glow emanating from my hands cut off, and I felt something slam into me, tearing through my mind and limbs and body. The force suspending me in the air let go and I fell, but I was unconscious before I hit the ground.

&#x200B;

“So,” Wayne handed me a cup of coffee. Huddled beneath my blanket, I accepted it with shaking hands, each scarred with a circular black burn in the center of the palms, extending halfway down my forearms, following the path of my veins. They had been badly frostbitten but were quickly recovering despite the nurse’s warnings that I’d never be able to use my hands again. “I’m not going to lie or sugar coat this, but you won’t be able to go home.”

“What?” I asked. “Why not?” I sipped the coffee tentatively. It was piping hot. Despite the liquid’s warmth, I could barely feel it through the deadened nerves on my hands. 

“You remember how I told you the government had been researching and fighting the supernatural for decades, right?”

I nodded. “You mentioned it briefly, a few times. Never elaborated, and there never was a good time to ask you.”

It was a full six hours since Karabasan’s defeat. Six hours since I had been found half dead, unconscious on the floor of the auditorium. Hill and Wayne and whisked me away to the nurse’s office, where she predicted I would be in a coma for a few months, possibly indefinitely. 

Imagine their surprise when I bolted upright a mere five hours later. Wayne had immediately moved me to my office, despite the nurse’s insistence, covered me with a blanket (as I had been freezing), and promptly left for another hour without any explanation. 

Now that he was back, he pulled up a chair opposite me and sat down, sighing. “No, there wasn’t. And honestly, I probably wouldn’t have told you anyways. But now you need to know.” He pulled up his sleeve, revealing his tattoo. “This is the mark of my squadron. The Psi Force. I was part of an elite, tight knit group of operatives that worked around the world, tackling incursions into our reality.”

“Your friend had one of those tattoos, too,” I said. “I saw it when I grabbed his gun. You work together?”

“We did,” Wayne nodded. He looked weary. “We used to. His name was Mark Grant. He was a good man, I think.” He closed his eyes for a second before continuing. “Our team worked together for five years before we split up. In the early 2000s, something happened. We stumbled on something we couldn’t contain and couldn’t kill. It had ties to Ascension, I believe. It decimated the team. Killed half of us. The other half split up. We couldn’t trust each other anymore after what happened.”

“I… see,” I frowned. “Wait, what does all this have to do with me, exactly?”

“You,” Wayne leaned forward. “You are special, now. Do you realize what you’ve done? You’ve proven that mankind can harness the energies of the other realms. Not indirectly through technology, or through being gifted them by other entities, but completely by ourselves. You’re living proof of what the US government has been looking for the past thirty years.”

“But you said the team split up,” I said, taking another drink of the hot coffee. I didn’t care for the taste very much, but I was grateful for the warmth. I still felt cold all over. “They can’t come after me if they don’t exist anymore, right?”

“The team, Psi Force, doesn’t exist anymore, no. But the department that backed us is alive and kicking. And let me assure you, this little incident is most definitely on their radar. I wouldn’t be surprised if agents aren’t already on their way.” 

“What am I supposed to do?” I asked.

“Disappear,” Wayne said grimly. “Vanish off the face of the earth. Ok, don’t actually go to another dimension again, but you know what I mean. Get far away from here. Preferably someplace without an extradition treaty with the USA.” He rubbed his chin thoughtfully. “You know, I think Madagascar is pretty nice this time of year.”

My face paled (not that it was already pale from my ordeal). “You mean I’m going to have to be a fugitive? I just saved the school! I probably saved the world!”

Wayne laughed. “Welcome to the world of spies and soldiers, kid. But seriously, if those agents get wind of you, which they probably already have, because half the school saw you holding Karabasan back from the portal at the end, they’ll find you and lock you up if you’re still in the country.”

“So this is it,” I mumbled. “This is how it ends, then. The rest of my life, living as a criminal or as a lab rat.”

“Don’t be so bleak,” Wayne gave me a wry grin. “Think of it as getting to see some of the less traveled parts of the world! It’ll be an adventure.” He set a brown paper bag on my desk. “But you’d better get going. You wasted a lot of time in that healing coma of yours. I wasn’t sure if you’d wake up in time to leave.”

“Yeah, about that… shouldn’t I be dead or something?”

Wayne got up from his seat and moved towards the door. “You said the entity you met told you that you had the mark of the Cognitive Realm on you. Thomas, you wouldn’t be alive if that mark hadn’t stayed with you after the portal closed. I know that you don’t have your reality bending powers anymore, but you clearly have some lingering effects. One of those is enhanced healing, apparently.”

A voice spoke in my mind. **Thomas, listen to me. You can do so much more! Don’t listen to this fool. You don’t need to be afraid of any government on Earth now! You hold more power than them all!**

*Shut up,* I told it. 

“I need to be going,” Wayne said. “I’m also a wanted fugitive, as it turns out.”

“Well, that does explain why you don’t officially exist,” I smirked. 

Wayne returned the grin. “You’ll find everything you need to get going in that bag.” He left, slipping out the door with a wave.

I picked up the bag and rummaged through its contents. It included a fake ID, a fake passport, a burner phone, and several large wads of cash. I sighed. “I guess this is my life now.”

**It doesn’t have to be,** Karabasan whispered.

“You’re supposed to be dead,” I muttered, throwing off the blanket and standing up. I was still so, so cold. “So why do I still have your voice bouncing around in me?”

**You carry my lifeblood now,** Karabasan told me. **Your hands are evidence of that.** I glanced down at the black marks on my hands.

“Man, I don’t have time for this. If you’re still alive and residing in my head, why aren’t you possessing me or whatever?”

**The portal closed. I no longer have any strength left. If I left your mind, I would instantly die.**

“Why me, then? Why not some other poor sap you can bend to your will, huh?” I shrugged my coat on, looking over the office that I called home for the past two weeks one last time.

**Your unique connection to the Cognitive Realm sustains me. I cannot survive anywhere else in the Physical World.**

I scoffed. “Yeah, the connection you yourself created by repeated inviting yourself into my NREM sleep. Funny how everything works out, doesn’t it? And anyways, that connection is all but dead now that the portal’s extra energy is gone. Look, I can barely create a flame anymore, let alone any of the crazy stunts I pulled fighting you.” I held out a finger and concentrated. A tiny flame flickered into existence, sputtering and sparking. I let it die. It took too much effort to sustain.

**Oh, don’t worry about that. You’ll get stronger. Most of your energy is going to healing your body. I’m sure you’ll be fine in a few days, tops.** 

“Oh, so now you care about me? Strange how you wanted me dead earlier today.” I flicked the lights off and locked the door, breaking the key off in the lock. Hopefully that would slow down anyone who came looking for me. Every second counted.

**Well, if you die, I die.** I could sense Karabasan shrugging. **You do what you must to survive. I guess that means in my case, finding a way to keep you alive until I can escape.**

“Yeah, like that’s going to happen.” I pulled up my hood and put on a pair of sunglasses, stuffing my hands in my pockets and heading for the exit. “I’m not letting you escape, even if it means killing myself. Perhaps that’s the best of course action, now that I’m sharing headspace with you and the government wants my power.”

**Let’s not be hasty, now,** Karabasan said. **You’re too valuable to die. You realize that, right? If we work together, we can probably still stop the threat to your world. To all the worlds.**

“I told you,” I said, slipping out a side door and emerging to a parking lot, dusk falling. “My powers are practically gone.”

**All we have to do is find a Cognitive Realm incursion. That’ll give you a boost. Besides, you’ve got me, too!**

I rolled my eyes. “Ah yes, a homicidal dream demon for a sidekick. Just what I always wanted.”

**No offense, but you’re the sidekick.**

“Whatever.” I figured it wasn’t safe to take my car. The government would probably track it. I scanned the lot and picked out a discreet, older black sedan. I walked over and tried the door, but it was locked. 

I concentrated, and heard the telltale click. Smirking, I opened the door and got in. There were no keys, but that suited me just fine. I reached out with my power and turned the ignition. The car roared to life. It showed it had a half tank of gas. I did my seatbelt and pulled out of the parking lot. “So what is this threat anyways? And here’s another question I’ve been wondering, how did you reach into our minds even when the portal wasn’t open? After all, you said we only have access to the Cognitive Realm, not the Immaterial Plane.”

**Both of those questions are related, actually,** Karabasan said. **Tell me, have you ever heard of the eighth realm? The one that connects the other seven?** 

I took an exit for the interstate. “Can’t say that I have.” I glanced in the mirror, hoping my sudden paranoia wasn’t unwarranted. I sped up, merging onto the highway. “What’s it got to do with me, though?”

**Not much, truthfully. Yet. However, we may be the only others who know of its existence.** 

I caught a flash of a black SUV in my mirrors. “And how did you find out, exactly?”

**Something reached out to me,** Karabasan told me. He sounded hesitant, scared, almost. **Something far more powerful than I. Something timeless. It showed me a vision of this place. There’re a few metaphors that could be used to describe it: An elevator in a building; the threads upon which a tapestry is woven. Both are equally correct.**

I gunned the engine, the speedometer needle pushing 100. Behind us, three government cars broke through the traffic, giving chase. I steeled myself for the coming trials. “Got a name for this mysterious realm? Anything concrete to go on?”

**Just one word,** came the response. 

**Limbo.**

 

I think I hear voices outside. I have to go now. I’d love to tell you all about the rest of the adventure, how we escaped, and what we’re doing now, but I’m afraid that’s a story for another day.

Goodbye for now, and may you all have pleasant dreams.

This is Thomas O’Keen (and Karabasan), signing off.

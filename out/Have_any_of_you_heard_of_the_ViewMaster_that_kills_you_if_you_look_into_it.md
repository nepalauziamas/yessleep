Or makes you go insane? Or shows you your own future death? Or something else just as bad? No? Well neither had I until my husband insisted we track it down .

For those of you who don't know, a View-Master is a stereoscope that is used to view reels that have little transparent color photographs on them. You pull a lever to make the wheel rotate and advance the photographs, telling a story in order. They aren't too popular now. When you can watch movies on your phone, why would you care about stories told through still photos, right? But back in the 70s they were the rage, especially among kids.

My husband's hobby was researching urban legends and I guess his part of the story started when he read about a supposedly haunted View-Master online, but that isn't where my part of the story starts. For me the story started in a greasy spoon called The Ritz. Never had a restaurant been more improperly named. But that's where me and David were having lunch on our way to what I thought was a romantic getaway. But I soon found out that David had another agenda.

He'd had some surprise he was holding back, like he was almost afraid to bring up, so I finally said let's hear it. What's this big surprise that's just gonna rock my world and make this anniversary our most ginormous celebration ever?

“Okay, be open minded,” is what he came back with. The longer he paused, the more dubious I became. Then he finally spilled it.

“You know that thing I was telling you about? The View-Master that kills you or shows you the future?”

“Seriously?” I said “That's our romantic mountain getaway? Another one of your twilight zone Hellraiser cube expeditions?”

He said that didn't sound very open-minded, but geez.

“Why didn't you tell me this was another spooky doodad hunt?” Iasked him. “And by the way, happy anniversary.”

He admitted it was because then I might not have come. But that's when David pulled something out of his pocket. Believe it or not, it turned out to be a diamond anniversary band. He laid it on the table.

“You didn't think I noticed all your hints, but I'm pretty good at paying attention while pretending to be totally clueless,” he said.

Well, he did pull off clueless pretty well, but sometimes he was more clever than I expected. I told him he had appeased me for the moment and okay now let's go find his haunted x-ray glasses or whatever so we can get on to the cabin and have our *real* vacation.

And so we drove up the mountain road. Toward our fates.

I asked him how much longer it was going to be because I had drank a lot of sweet tea back at that choke and puke and if we don't find it soon, I'm gonna wind up going in the trees. If you don't understand the choke and puke reference, then clearly you've never had a truck driver in the family or seen *Smokey and the Bandit*. I urged David not to get his hopes up. I reminded him of one of our previous excursions, of a Polaroid camera that supposedly stole the souls of the people you photographed. He took my picture and nothing happened, but then again, he tried to argue that I wasn't the best example. How would anyone notice the difference. Ha ha.

Finally we pulled into the parking lot of the gas station where we were supposed to meet the seller of the View-Master. It was called Mibb's. And we were none too soon. Not that I cared about the dreaded object of terror, but I was at this point really in need of a pisseria. It was the only store we'd seen in miles and, had to admit, it did look like the kind of place where a horror movie harbinger would work.

While I went inside, David stayed outside to pump gas. I was reminded of something my boss had told me about eating at restaurants when you were out of town on business. He said before you sit down and order, go to the bathroom even if you don't need to. Why? Because the person in charge of cleaning the bathroom is also in charge of cleaning the kitchen. Let's just say if they served food at Mibb's, I would never have eaten any.

I did however stop to pick up a Dr. Pepper out of the cooler. As I walked with it toward the register, I passes a man looking at the magazine and newspaper rack, his back to me. Something odd caught my eye and I looked back. A STREAM OF PISS was hitting the floor in front of him, some of it splashing on the newspapers and magazines on the bottom shelf.. Oooo-kay. There was one other customer in the store, a tall, long-haired man in leather who looked a lot like Sebastian Bach of the hair metal band Skid Row, who was also standing near Pissing Man. As I made my way up to the counter, I heard Sebastian yell “Dude, why ya gotta be such a dick?!”

The store's one employee was a fairly normal but forgettable looking man in his 20s. I sat my drink on the counter and asked didn't he see the man peeing in the floor.

“Yeah, that's Harold,” he said unconcerned, not even looking up.

“And you don't find this...*unusual*?” I asked rhetorically.

The young man behind the counter paused, actually considering this.

“Not for Harold.”

I shook my head in disbelief. I told him it would pass for pretty damn weird in most places, but maybe not in...then I asked what this place was called.

“Pumpkintown,” the man behind the counter declared, with just a touch of pride.

“Is this even a town?” I asked under my breath, but not so quietly that he didn't hear me.

“Oh, it's a town. We got one red light and a Dollar General. Makes it a town,” he reasoned.

About that time, David entered the store. I was about to tell him about Pissy Harold, but he spoke first.

“Hey honey, see that woman over there?” he asked. The gas station worker looked along with me to see who we were talking about. David pointed to a lady probably around fifty who was still outside near the pumps. “She said something strange to me,” David said. The store employee who hadn't found a man taking a leak in the floor to be worthy of note was now pretty curious.

“Now that *is* weird,” he said, “That's Andrea Lowe. She's a deaf mute. Hat'n spoken a word in her life.”

I asked David what she said. He said she had gotten uncomfortably close, not respecting the bubble in the least, and with their faces nearly touching, she whispered “It calls to you.”

“What calls?”

“She didn't say.”

We walked out of the store, me screwing the top off of my Dr. Pepper. We saw an old man leaned up against an old beat up, rusted light blue Chevy truck. He was wearing dirty over-alls and a straw hat. Maybe retirement age. If this were a movie and Fred Gwynn were still alive, he would have portrayed him.

My eyes scanned down to his shoes. They had holes in the toes. I gave my husband a nudge and a "look what you've gotten us into" look, but he ignored it. Then the old man walked toward us.

“Would you be David?” he asked, sticking his hand out to for David to shake it. It was a little greasy, but David shook it without comment, saying “Good guess.” Then he said his name was Frank.

Then he acknowledged me and said something like “You must be Jill.”

He reached out to shake my hand, as well, but I just smiled and waved. Greasy hand, remember?

He welcomed us to his little town, but said something about the lack of interesting sights to see.

I couldn't resist saying that was true unless you count the guy taking a leak in the floor in there.

Frank just nodded and said “Harold.” Then after a bit of a pause, he told us to follow his truck and he would take us to *it.* When I said I assumed he had brought it, he just said it was a little more complicated than that.and that he just lived up the road “a piece.” I wasn't sure how far a piece was. Probably a little farther than “over yonder,” but at least it sounded like you could “get there from here.”

And so we followed Frank's old truck up a lonely winding road, leading further and further up the mountain. A bumper sticker on the back of his truck read *I break for possums.*

I couldn't help but needle David a little bit about how sketchy this was getting.

“So, Pumpkintown...a little piss on the floor, deaf-mutes talking. Are we really going to follow this old nut job down into his heart of darkness? What horror cliché is missing...?

As if on cue, we approached a dilapidated old farmhouse on the right. It had a weedy, uncut yard. The porch looked like it was about to fall in, paint was peeling from its big white columns, and old rusty vehicles were on blocks in the yard. There were stakes in the ground with deer heads on top. A kid of about 12 was playing stick horsey. Maybe not 12, but definitely too old for stick horsey. Only I'm pretty certain the stick had an actual deer head on the end of it. I told David that if he stopped at that *Wrong Turn* house, the deal was off and we were out of there.

So of course Frank's truck slows down at the Wrong Turn driveway. Seems like he might have even tapped the breaks. But then he accelerated.. David and I shared a "that was a close one" look.

Eventually Frank pulled up to an iron gate. As he drove closer to it, the gate automatically opened. Must have had a remote or something. His hand stretched out of the truck, motioning for us to follow him. I think I said something like “All hope abandoned, ye who enter.” But what awaited us was not the decrepit old house I was expecting. Instead we saw something that could nearly be termed a mansion.

“Okay, we just went from Texas Chainsaw to South Fork,” I said. David reminded me that they're both in Texas.

We passed a sign in the yard that read: DON'T KILL RATTLESNAKES, nut I no longer thought Frank was just some nut. He was eccentric. What's the difference? Poor people are crazy. Rich people are eccentric. It's a whole classier kin of strange.

After we got out of our vehicles, I complimented Frank on his beautiful home. He said that his wife had been an architect and had designed it herself, but that she had passed away a few years back. They had been together over forty years. He wistfully said he just didn't have her long enough. At this, I squeezed David's hand. I hadn't thought of Frank as the romantic type. My opinion of him was still evolving.

Frank broke the sadness by asking us if we were ready to see it now. We still weren't sure he really had it. Often on these urban legend scavenger hunts, the real artifact doesn't match the advertisement.

I expected us to walk into the house to some room full of collectibles or something. What I didn't expect was for Frank to go in alone and come back with two shovels. He held one out to David.

“Might take both of us,” he said. “I buried it pretty deep this time.”

So now it's about sunset and I'm looking at David in a deep hole, still digging. He was covered in dirt and sweat. Only his head was visible, Still scooping out dirt with the shovel. I'd had my fill of this by now, but David was still all in. Frank had gone inside. I told him there's probably nothing in there. For all we know, he's got you digging our graves. This is probably not even his house. He killed the Knapps and took their house. Next, I bet he'll poison us.

Frank returned from the house to the back yard, carrying a pitcher of tea and three glasses.

“I made tea,” he announced.

I whispered “Told ya.”

But my husband paid me no attention. When Frank handed him a glass of tea, David immediately started chugging it. I monitored him to determine if he was going to fall over dead as I considered the tea. It had been awhile since I'd finished off the Dr. Pepper. So far, so good. I looked at Frank. He took a sip too. I decided to chance it. As I was raising the glass to my lips...suddenly, David started coughing. I surreptitiously poured my tea onto the grass.

But then of David said “Wow, that's really good tea. And cold. Drank it too fast and got strangled.”

I looked to find just a the tiny bit of tea left in my glass. Crap! Then I had a thought.

“Sure was,” I said. “I already drank mine. Can I have some more, Frank?”

I held my glass out toward the pitcher.

Frank poured me some more and sat down next to me. We watched David together. Far from slowing down, his digging was getting, faster, more frenetic. Frank said “He's feeling it now.”

“Feeling what?”

“He should be tiring out, but notice how he's getting faster. He's feeling the pull.”

The old man let this sink in then added “You see...*it calls to you*.”

“What? What calls?” I asked.

“I can't explain it,” Frank replied, “but that's how it works. Its call is specific to a person. You don't feel it like he does. And I can already feel it leaving me.”

He gestured with his tea glass to David. “He's got it now. Or it's got him. That's why I buried it so deep. And why I need to get rid of it.”

“So inanimate objects talk to you that often, or just this one?” I asked him, but he just noted my sarcasm with a smile.

I heard the clank of the shovel hitting something.

“Think that might be it!” David yelled.

“Really? What's it saying?” I asked.

“Huh?”

“Never mind. Just hurry it up,” I told him.

David passed a box up out of the hole, holding it out Frank, but Frank waved it off like it was kryptonite and backed away from the hole. So I took the box from David. It had chains and locks. I said to Frank “Please tell me you have the keys on you.”

“What?” he responded. “Are you crazy?? Have them on me?”

Yeah, 'cause **that's** the part of this that's crazy.

I looked at David for confirmation, but was entranced by the box, picking it up, shaking it, looking at it from all angles.

Frank marched toward the house and so we fell in behind him. He opened the door and we saw inside Frank's house for the first time. There was no furniture. Literally walls and a floor. Except for a bookcase. A bookcase with only one book.

He went to the book and picked it up. The title of the book was *The Four Keys to Eliminating Anxiety* by Miranda Kollos. When he lifted it, there was a key underneath where it had sat. He retrieved it.

Then he did something else pretty strange. He stuck himself with a pin. I looked at David to see his reaction, but he had none. He wasn't very observant of subtle things.

As soon as Frank passed him the key, David put it in one of the locks and turned.

The second room had a fireplace. Frank removed a log. Another key underneath. He repeated the processes of sticking himself with the pin.

Same ritual with the third one, which was under a birdbath.

We went into a fourth room, where the key was just out in the open. When I asked him why, he said “Well, I figure if I've somehow got past the birdbath...”

“And why are you sticking youraelf with pins?”

He looked at me gravely. “To make sure I'm not dreaming this. I've dug it up in my sleep before. It's call is even stronger when you're sleeping.”

After David undid the final lock, he and Frank stared at the unopened box with a religious reverence. I, of course, was under no such spell. I had indulged all this long enough and was ready to move it along.

I said “Oh for God's sake, it's not the Ark of the Covenant. Just open the damn box.”

And so I did, expecting to bring this to its inevitable and uneventful conclusion. Unfortunately, this was all just the setup. Our story was just beginning.

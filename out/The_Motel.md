So for starters I want to mention this incident didn't happen to me but to a very dear friend of mine in my family and has mentioned of attempted sexual assault  
I'll be writing her story in the form of third person with the way she told me how it all happened during one cold night in October

My friend "Beth" was and still is a very strong wield person with a bubbly personality. In first glance people would assume she's easy to pick apart but get her foul tongue and Scottish family right fist if you try. 

This happened in 2016 when I was a Juinor and Beth was a Senior in Highschool and Beth was going on a week long trip with her cousin and his girlfriend for a annual tradition of goofing off and having fun since the three are basically the best friend trio from She-Ra.   
They've been driving for hours until both Beth and her cousin's gf get hungry for pizza, however the only one nearest was a Domino's right side of a gas station connected to a 7/11. 

The three got out of the car and ordered one pizza to go with two drinks at the 7/11 before heading back to the road. Suddenly, in true horror movie fashion, it began to rain a bit. Beth claimed they knew some rain was coming but from where they were it began to rain fast and hard so her cousin pulled him to a motel he saw signs at the gas station and got two rooms. The reasoning behind this was cause this motel for some reason only had one bed per room, so the cousin and his gf got one and Beth got the one right next door. 

The night was normal, the trio hung out in cousin's room eating and chatting before it came around 10 pm and Beth head to her room alone since no one was assume something bad would happen.   
Before she went back to her room she bought a water bottle at the lobby to take with her sleeping medications since she suffered from sleeping issues since childhood.   
After she got the water bottle from the guy at the lobby she went back to her room and took the meds. 

This is where things began to shift weird with her.

She has taken these meds many times before obviously and never once has she felt this intense dizzy spell that affected her nor the sudden urge of wanting to throw up.   
The pills seemed to working a faster effect cause before Beth knew it she was out like a light.

Beth said she has no idea how long she was out of it but that she woke up in her motel room in the dark and her senses picked up fast the second she felt a hand on her chest.   
Her body felt like weights as she tried to shift only with little methods, that's when she noticed she was now in her bra and panties with the weight of another on the bed.  
Beth explained this was the quickest Flight Or Fight she ever felt when her body suddenly pumped a bunch of adrillion in her veins that led to her heavy arms sprung and punch the guy hard off the bed, that's when she noticed he had no sign of pants, and ran out the room screaming.   
People including Beth's cousin opened the door to see this short girl in her underwear screaming and then falling over her feet to the concrete floor. 

Police were called as the guy was held shut by the motel's patrons in Beth's room. It must've been a small town or something as Beth claimed since the police came rather fast and took the man in cuffs.  
The man was the very same man in the lobby.

Beth was told later one once she recovered from the night but police discovered he has been injecting some sort of date rape drug in certain lobby water bottles through the caps so no one would get suspicious and then using the spare room keys to assault women of many ages in their rooms. Some of which many believe have no idea what had happened. 

When the three came home they were shocked as anyone would be to hear what had happened, there really are some sick people in the world

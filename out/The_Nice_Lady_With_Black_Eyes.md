So my sister found out I have Reddit. Somehow, she convinced me to share this with you all, since I remember everything that happened better than her.

For some context - I'm 25 years old and my sister is 21. This story takes place back when I was 6 and she was 2.

We were raised by our mom and our grandparents, since dear dad left a few months after Nicole was born. I never really bothered to ask why he was gone. In fact - I was quite happy! From what I remember, he wasn't exactly nice to me or my mom.

Anyways, we spent most of our days in our grandparents house, while mom was out working, as back then we were really short on money. She tried her best to be there for us, so I'm not mad at her. Whenever our grandparents couldn't take care of us, mom would either bring us to work with her, or we'd stay with a few of her friends. People were nice, as far as I remember.

But me and Nicole would only ever meet up with a nice lady in our grandparents house. She was tall, I think over 6'5 feet, so back then she looked like a giant to me. She had tanned skin, and if I remember correctly, she had dark brown hair. Could've been black, but it was a while ago. She'd always wear the same thing - a red gown.

Yet, what stood out the most about her, were her eyes. They were pure black.

At first, Nicole would be the only one who would see her. I remeber staring at her confused, not knowing what she would point at and laugh. I'd wake up in the middle of the night, looking around for Nicole, as back then we'd share a room, and not finding her anywhere. I'd look for her in the whole house, eventually finding her in the basement.

The most freaky part about was that the basement door would be always locked, so there was no way that Nicole would get in there by herself. Unless our grandpa forgot to close it, but it seemed very unlikely.

This would repeat for a few more nights - I'd wake up, notice that Nicole wasn't there, go to the basement, and then bring her back to our room.

What changed one night, was the fact that I'd be shaken awake by Nicole who would point towards the basement and kept telling me to go. I did, while my sister was following close behind me. When I got there, I realized that the basement door was wide open, as if inviting me in. Usually, when I went to fetch Nicole, the door would be closed, but not locked.

Against my better judgement, I went into the basement with Nicole, and that's when I first met the lady. She was incredibly nice, and would coo at Nicole many times throught the night, talking with me about many topics. She's play with me and Nicole, and I didn't even realize when it was morning.

Our grandma went to search for us, and completely freaked out when she found us in the basement. She grabbed us and quickly dragged us out, not seeing the black eyes that stared at her silently. Grandma forbade us from going into that basement, but since I had such a nice time there, I went there again. This would continue for several months until mom got herself her own house and we had to move out.

The reason I'm bringing it up is because in a few days I'm going back to visit my grandparents along with Nicole, and she's been mentioning talking with them about the woman in the basement. She got reminded of the lady when we've been talking about our time there, and she's excited at the thought of seeing her again. I doubt we'd get any answers, since I asked them about it before and they refused to tell me anything, but who knows? Maybe they'd answer to Nicole.

Besides, this would not be the only weird that happened to us. I could share, since the two of us have been recalling all the weird things. Anyone want a story of how my sister flirted with a ghost and got away with it?

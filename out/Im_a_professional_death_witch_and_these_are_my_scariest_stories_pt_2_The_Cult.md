For this witchy tale of demonic fuckery we have the Cult we will say they called themselves 2109 and another witch who reached out to me, buckle in this is a long one 

Let's go back to January where a friend Cody (f) who was also a professional practitioner had reached out to me, explaining that she had gotten involved with a coven of witches that turned out to be a cult, "they call themselves 2109 and they don't like me" I was told via video chat. Cody also told me that she had left the group after picking up bad vibes and ever since then her business and family had been through heavy misfortune.

I agreed to look into it and see what was going on, I had no idea what I had agreed to. 

Upon doing some digging I was able to determine that 2109 was only partially responsible for the misfortune Cody and her family was experiencing. Cody had made many enemies either by openly shaming them on social media or by throwing hexes around with no protection.
They not only had 2109 in their ass but a parasite, a wraith ( a Norse undead that feeds off humans, but like viciously) and a being so ancient I don't even have a proper name for it.  I passed the info along and also informed Cody that the parasite they had was effecting their divination accuracy. I contacted a couple of other experienced practitioners I know to confirm how I should deal particularly with the parasite as they are uncommon and I'd never dealt with one before. I  collected my info and supplies and made a plan that would require 3 parts.
1. To deal with the influence the Cult had 
2. To banish any remaining entities 
3. Through cleansing of all spiritual tools and to re seal the house 

I let Cody know the plan and was informed that other people from Cody's group were being effected by this situation now. Okay, fine we Amp up the power and blast the whole group. I also created some protection for the group members but because I was not a part of the immediate group several chose not to use the protection I provided. 

I decided to start with Cody and then focus on the rest of the group. I cast protection around me and started scanning Cody's space to see where everything was. I then proceeded to bind the influence of 2109
This is were shit starts getting wild, while I was attempting the banishing Cody was also attempting a banishing. Cody's banishing was not working, I had by that time realized that I wasn't going to be able to banish 2109 UNTIL I got rid of the parasite because that's how they were staying so closely intertwined with Cody,

I began the tedious process of removing the parasite, think of this thing like a spiritual alien face hugger but with more legs. I slowly started to unhook each leg of this little creature I'd never even encountered before.
After unhooking all the legs I expected the parasite to come off easily, I did not. Once again I was stumped buy this alien face hugger creature. I then started pulling, drawing and forcibly removing this parasite and eventually it let go, but immediately it attached to me.

Now realizing I've not only got a new problem but also in a weird way have more control over the situation. This little terror of a fachugger is in my space and attached to me which could be really bad. But also I can control this entity better within my own space, therefore I made the decision to end the call and tackle this on my own. 
I let Cody know I needed to deal with this and I would resume working with her the next day. 

The night progressed with me working to once again detach the face hugger, this time from myself. I was able to do so but noticed something strange, while I was able to detach it I was not able to remove it from my space. It was bouncing off the walls and all over the place. I attempted another banishing that night with the very little energy I had left, it failed and I went to bed.

The next day upon waking up I was exhausted I knew the parasite I had in my home was feeding off of me, but also I knew the presence of 2109 was in my home. They sent the parasite to Cody and I had intervened, 2109 most definitely knew someone was trying to interfere with what they had done to Cody. I now had a target on my back. 

Knowing I needed to get the parasite AND 2109 out of my space pushed me to attempt a 3rd banishing. It did not go well, all was fine until my candle got to the point of hitting the very heavy duty banishing and protection Ingredients, it then erupted into massive flames. I tried several methods to put out this fire to no avail anything I attempted to do fueled this fire. The flames got bigger and I began to panic, I was getting ready to call the fire department. I was terrified.  I went to put my dog outside  while headed towards the door I spot something, The wraith. No wonder I was struggling so hard I had two separate entities that were feeding off of any energy they could find.

I put my dog in the back yard and went back to my basement where my desk was essentially on fire. Water had not worked but there are kids upstairs I need to put this out. Looking around frantically I spot a large bag of rice, grabbing it quickly I smothered the flames. Making sure nothing is burning anymore I step outside for a breather.

For folks who aren't witchy when a banishing goes up in flames like that and is unable to be completed for whatever reason it means that another witch or entity who is more powerful then you has successfully intervened and stopped your working. I abandoned my workspace entirely and contacted a couple friends the next morning. 

Once again I made a plan, trap the parasite, banish the wraith, take and exorcism bath ( yep EXORCISM) 
and stay the hell out of the situation any further.
After two or three days of work I finally had my space back. 

I had been  passing Cody the Information I had used to successfully restore the peace and heard very little from her for a couple weeks at which time Cody contacted me again. Things were happening to her, her family and the group she hangs with.  Cody did in fact have another parasite.
I asked her weather she had followed steps I had sent her to sort it out, she did not. I told her to do what I had sent her and to pass to the group but that would be the extent of my involvement with the situation. 

Now I had told Cody that she was being interfered with in regards to her tarot cards so I was very shocked to see her charging people money for readings that she knew were not accurate. I brought it up to her to get the response of "Well I need to feed myself".
Doesn't give you the right to scam people, Cody had also been performing paid spell work for people during the time when they had all this going on. Charging people money for readings and workings that you know are not only inaccurate but also dangerous as that's how these parasites spread is insanely unethical. My help stopped then and there.

I informed Cody I wouldn't be helping any further as I found her actions to be unethical. I left her with a list of experienced practitioners who could help her. 

Several weeks go by and I had been getting messages from Cody almost daily. I ignored them as I'd already made it clear I was done with the situation and had redirected Cody to people who could help. 

I had done all the work I did for Cody, her family and her friend group for free. She never reached out to anyone for a very long period of time. Only me, always asking me so eventually due to her not respecting my boundaries I blocked Cody and decided to move on with my life.
The same day I am suddenly struck with level 10 chest pain, like draws tears to your eyes chest pain. My brain is screaming heart attack but my gut says do an egg test
Egg tests are uses to determine if you've been hexed or curses and sure as shit, a hex sent my way. Fine again no problem defensive magick is what I do. I sent it back without any amplification. Do throw around shit you don't want back.

Cody has since sent me 6 hexes none of them have been successful her life is falling apart because of 2109 and the parasite she continues to carry around. Cody is convinced that after I stopped helping her that I hexed her. I did not, I simply sent back her own spells and stopped protecting her.

Its come to my attention that Cody has been reaching out to other people in our larger social circle for help. The thing is as soon as Cody says name people back out of helping. Not because they are scared of me but because they respect me. I doubt Cody will ever get the help she needs 

And once again kids be VERY careful who you deal with in the spirt realm

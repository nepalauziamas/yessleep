 

I know a lot of people won’t believe me. A lot don’t. But I really need to get this off my back.  
 I’m about to enter my senior year of highschool, and summer’s been treating me awfully so far. I went on a vacation with a bunch of people I didn’t know, and behold my surprise when I absolutely hated it. Then after that, I was sent to work at a summer camp, but only 3 days in I had a major injury with my knee that got me sent home in crutches.  
 I’ve been spending the past 3 or so weeks sitting on the couch and passing the time, but it’s going to bed that’s been a challenge.

I live with my mom, who’s almost never home due to her habit of going out to drink wine with her friends. My dad will visit as often as he can, despite his work, but it’s very rare for him to stay long. This was not helpful because It’s very strenuous for me to walk (even with crutches).   
24/7 it felt like I couldn’t move. Like something had pulled my knee right out and slapped it back in sloppily and glued it in. It took hours to go to sleep. No matter what position I was sleeping in, my leg would always ache. Eventually my body would wear itself to exhaustion; but not last night.   
It might have been 2-3 AM, I’m not really sure. I was just staring up at the wall, listening to whatever was happening on the tv and trying to imagine something that would make me pass out. It didn’t work like it usually did, almost like my brain felt something was off tonight. I just kind of stalled for a while, fiddling my thumbs and shifting my neck every once in a while, but imagine my surprise when I hear the doorbell. I carefully sat up to grab my crutches and painfully scooted myself to the door.   
“Mom? Is that you?” I asked. No reply. I looked out in the driveway and froze. My mom’s car was still gone. I took a step back. “Uh, who is this? I’m not letting you in unless I know who you are.” I could feel my heart sink down a bit. I was petrified. But I was caught off guard as I heard my phone ringing in the other room. I assumed the ring might have just been a malfunction or something, as the doorbell was electronic, so I limped back. My neighbor was calling. I thought they would have gone to bed right now, as they had 3 kids to look after. What I heard next made me go pale.  
“What the hell is on your porch?” I could feel myself stop breathing. “What are you talking about.” Just then I heard her scream out. “IT WENT THROUGH THE GATE!” I was shocked and dropped my phone trying to stumble into the kitchen. Before I made it, I stopped.

It was locked. I could tell by the thumps and knocks the thing made on the door. I didn’t want to look, and I realized it would be best to make sure the intruder didn’t know I was here. I quietly rolled over to my moms bedroom after snatching my phone back. The ‘thing’ was making a scratchy buzzing sound. Kind of like a cicada, but as if a dog was barking it. It’s hard to describe, but it scared the shit out of me. I was definitely in tears by now. I flew under the bed and waited out until the police arrived.  
By the time they got here, whatever it was had fled. My neighbor was shaking. She described what the thing looked like to me. It was human in shape, but it’s head was drastically smaller than the rest of its tall, boney body. It had apparently been out there for an hour before she called me. She thought it was just a prank or a figment of her imagination from the wine she drank, but when her husband confirmed he saw it too, she told me. When it made a dash for my backyard, it had apparently thrown it’s entire body weight like a ball and ran while squatting. Kind of like a frog.  
I still don’t know what it was. I don’t think anyone else did. I might try illustrating it one day, but I'm way too scared of it coming back and I don't want to think about it for the time being.

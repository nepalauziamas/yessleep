There's stories of a creature in my town called Springbrook. The creature has a skull for a head, except its damaged,melted in places. It has an open chest, ribs open to reveal it's organs, except it has none. None except for a heart that doesn't beat. The most important feature of this creature... it's fingers. They're long, and it's nails are razor sharp. the fingers extend when it's needed, and it only uses them for one thing...

This creature kills people who have recently had their heart broken. Whether it be from a breakup, or the death of a loved one, as long as their heart hurts, they're at risk. When these people are alone it comes up behind them and sticks it's finger straight through their chest, through the middle of their heart. Every reported victim had the same injuries, 2 holes in the front and back of their bodies, and their heart... missing.

The first victim, Terry, had recently lost her fiance in a car accident. She was destroyed, his funeral was the worst day of her life. The only reason she went in was her teenage daughter Tess. She spent all of her time with Tess, until one day when Tess went on a date with her new boyfriend, Calem. While she was alone... it came. She was standing, looking out of her window, waiting for her daughter to come home. Then, she felt a something sharp enter her back and come out of the front. Before she could even yell, her heart had stopped. A neighbor claimed to have seen the creature. She described it vaguely, and it was dubbed "Heartstopper" by all who were interested.

The next victim was Calem, her daughter's boyfriend. They were both horrified when they learned how Terry had died. Tess blamed Calem for taking her on that date. Calem was heartbroken, and even started blaming himself. The day after Tess left him, it was back. Calem was stood in front of a photo of him and his little sister. This brought him comfort when he needed it. This comfort was short lived, though. Calem felt the same sharp pain, and the same i juries were reported. The media in Springbrook started talking of a serial killer, but nobody knew what kind of weapon could cause this.

The next victim was a boy named Bill. Bill was a good friend of Calem's younger sister. She had to move after his death, because her family was scared any of them could be next. Bill was heartbroken. She was his best friend, and now she was gone. One night, his single mother left their trailer to go get some butter. he stood, staring at the TV, watching the news cover both mysterious deaths, while he cried, remembering his friend. His cries soon stopped, when the boy felt the sharp pain, and his heart was removed. The serial killer rumors were pumped up to 100, while police investigated,  just to find no clues.

Since then, many more have fallen victim to the same glaring end. The deaths had started to spread to neighboring towns. Many moved away, but the conspiracy theorists moved in, hoping to find this "Heartstopper". Nobody has ever found it. Many claim to have seen it, but there isn't a single photo, video, or even audio recording... it made sure of that.

Now you may wonder how I know all of this. That's because I was there. That's because I am it. I am the Heartstopper

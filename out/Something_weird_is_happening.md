So I don't know what's been going on the past few days but I can bet you my life on this it's not a coincidence. It really can't be. By the way, I know a lot of people here just write stories but this is actually a real thing that is happening to me.

So, I was in my room a few days ago just chilling when suddenly the lights in my room started flashing for a few seconds, then they were back to normal. I really paid no attention to it because it's just lights. Maybe the lightbulb was at its last. Whatever. Didn't think about it at all. Then it kept happening when I was alone in my room. It happened a few times over the course of some days but again, I didn't really pay any attention to it because it's just a light. I found it a bit weird but that's it. All I thought was that I'm gonna need to buy a new lightbulb and that's it. Then it started happening while I was in different rooms in my house at random times, again when I was alone. The lights would start going on and off for a few seconds and then go back to normal. At this point it started to freak me out just a little bit because what the hell? I tried not to pay attention because I believe that your fears feed off of you and I'm not trying to make myself paranoid by thinking of it. 

Today I was working really early at my job, had to open up the store at 7am. Mind you it's still a bit dark at this time. So I went in, turned on the lights and went to the changing rooms to put on my work clothes and it happened again. Lights flashing for a few secs then back to normal. I was so freaked out at this point, because there's no way it's a coincidence all these times. 

Side note by the way, I don't know if it's worth mentioning or I am indeed just panicking but sometimes I get off work late at midnight (shifts are either 7-4 or 3:30-12) and go through a quicker path from a small creek next to my house. I never minded it or was scared or whatever but I've felt a really weird vibe lately and avoided going from there. Type of vibe that some dude is gonna kidnap me, not a ghost or spirit vibe by the way. I felt this vibe before the whole lights thing started happening. No idea if it has anything to do with it even, but at this point I connect everything to this.

 Can anyone even explain why this would be happening in a logical, scientific way or something? Lol I've been so creeped out by this, I don't know. I don't even believe in paranormal things but honestly I don't have a normal explanation for why this is happening.

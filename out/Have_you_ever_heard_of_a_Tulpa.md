I posted about a dream I had while pregnant that had some weird real life occurrences, so I thought I’d share this one too. I’ll start off by saying I don’t claim to be a medium or anything like that, but when I’m pregnant I have some weird dreams. 

When I was pregnant with my second child I would have insanely vivid dreams. Usually just random things, but one night I dreamed about what I’d come to know as “The Hat Man.” I’ll give a little background for context in the dream. 

My friend Anna recently moved to a different home, and *her* friend, Charlotte, moved into the old one. Me and Charlotte were only acquaintances, but since Anna had lived in the home I was very familiar with it. 

In my dream I was walking up to the house with my husband and my oldest daughter. I was coming to babysit for Charlotte. It was super foggy and dark with no other houses around it, nothing but a man sitting outside of the fence. He had his back turned to us just staring at the house as he sat in a wheelchair. The feeling I had was extremely un-easy, and something about the man was just off. As we approached, I got the sense that this man wanted to get into the house but couldn’t. He appeared to be middle aged, nothing stood out besides the wheelchair… and his hat. It was a hat you’d see in a show like “Peaky-Blinders.” The closer I got, the more I somehow knew that this was not a good “person” In fact, he was not a person at all, but something pretending to be one, and the wheelchair was only a guise for him to seem like he was not of any threat. Don’t ask me how I knew all this, it’s just dream-logic I guess. 

I said to my husband as we came up beside him, almost passing the entrance to the gate, “Don’t look at him, don’t talk to him.” For whatever reason I looked at his face then, and he started to change. I can’t really describe what he became, but as it grew and morphed I could sense his anger fuming as he became this distorted, towering *thing.*

We quickly rushed past him and into the house. He had disappeared. When I got into the house nothing was right, it was abandoned and dilapidated, save for a worn kitchen table with 3 little girls, all in the same onesie. I could see two were twins, and one slightly older. Now Charlotte only has one son and a toddler girl, and I have never babysat for her or met her children. 

I told Anna about the dream a few days later. I always tell people my dreams, I think they’re entertaining and weird, and I’m sure anyone who has the misfortune of hearing about them probably just thinks the latter. She agreed it was a weird dream and said Charlotte had been talking about her son complaining of a ghost or something in his closet at night scaring him. She told Charlotte about my dream and shortly after she reached out to me privately, and what she said sent shivers down my spine. 

Before her daughter was born she had a miscarriage…twins. And her son had been intermittently telling her about some ghost that came out of his closet at night with a weird hat on. She also said she had been extremely depressed and feeling very off lately. Charlotte asked if I had ever heard of “The Hat Man” but I never had, and just as well the hat in my dream wasn’t the same type as the one her son described when he talked about the thing that was in his room at night. 

I told her All the details in my dream and we ended our convo agreeing it was very strange. I didn’t talk to her again after that, honestly I had forgotten about all of it since I was so busy with a toddler and would be giving birth soon. 
My pregnancy was hard and post partum was harder. I immediately had severe PPD, and honestly my brain went to some scary places during that time. I don’t want to get into that part much, but I’m really lucky to still be here now writing this. 

One day a few months after I had my second daughter I laid down on the couch to “sleep while the baby sleeps.” I was in some weird half dream, half awake state when I *heard* and felt someone come to the edge of the couch (standing behind where my head was). I got the feeling it was a man and he was frightened. Just as fast as he appeared, he disappeared, and someone… rather *something* was left standing behind him. The sense of dread I felt through my entire body was so intense. I felt heat burning through my body just before I jerked awake. As I opened my eyes, jolted upright and turning to face what was behind me, I caught a strange glimpse. It was something like a fleeting shadow, just a black outline/shadow type thing. A tall man, wearing a wide brimmed hat…then in a blink he vanished. What the hell did I just see? What the hell just happened!? 

I don’t even know why I said anything, it just came out of me “why?” And in a quiet, retreating voice that was not my own, but unmistakably a man’s, I hear “because you invited me in.” After the initial shock and questioning my sanity, I realized that whatever that thing was, it was the very same energy I had felt from the man in a wheelchair in my dream months before. 

I’m not one to believe in shit like this, and quite honestly it was the last thing I was thinking about since I was so busy and tired from the c section and adjusting to a new baby. I googled the description of what I saw and scrolled through images. There it was… the dark silhouette wearing the same hat with the caption “The Hat Man.” I read so many articles trying to piece together this strange experience that made no logical sense. 

I know this sounds crazy, but I think he followed me from the dream I had while pregnant, and I got the sense he was upset I had played some role in “outing” him to Charlotte. “You invited me in” stuck in my head. I had, hadn’t I? I saw what he was, truly, and in my horrible depression I had given him a source to feed on maybe? I still don’t understand this entity’s draw to children, or why all the stories I read involve children or teens. A lot of people claimed he isn’t “bad” but just an observer.  The feelings that came from this experience were nothing short of terrifying. We are all fine these days and I think once I realized he was there he just… left. I’m not sure why he was presented hiding behind someone, or who that someone was. It’s all just strange and gives me the creeps talking about it but I needed to get it out somewhere.

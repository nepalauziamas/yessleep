I sat in the college library using a computer.    
My laptop was back at my apartment and permanently out of order.    
I recently started college in another state so I don’t really have anyone who would let me borrow a computer.    
Which landed me right here, in the library.    
I should have been doing my school work.    
Anyone who’s ever been a full time student knows that taking twelve or more units worth of classes at once means constant busy work.    
Trying to stay one step ahead of my workload is key but; procrastination is such an inviting temptation.    
It started off, innocently enough, with a simple trip to Reddit.    
My fingers danced nimbly across the crusty computers keyboard.    
The minutes ticked by as I clicked post after post of top tier memes, TIFU’s, and rare puppers.    
My eyes began to grow sore as I stared into the sickly white glow of the monitor. I chortled for the uptenth time at a “web-comic”.    
It was at this moment that my eyes caught a recommended subreddit at the side of the screen.    
I clicked it and I was presented with a gift, or so I thought.    
For there stood in front of me endless stories of haunted dumb-assery and terrifying tomfoolery.    
The tales went on, page after page.    
My eyes growing more weary, but my mind was ignited by fear and bullshit.    
Never in my life had I seen such substance, such muck.   
I looked around and scanned the rest of the computer lab to see if anyone was watching.    
“Can’t let them know”, I thought.    
I logged off and rushed out the door, racing toward the bus because I didn’t have a car.    
As the wheels of the bud went round and round I began to ponder all that I might see later.    
I waited for a certain stop.   
The bus jerked to a halt and I looked out to see the glowing yellow letters that spelled out “Best Buy”.    
I hurried inside and immediately purchased a brand new $100 dollar chrome book.    
While waiting for the next bus I could hardly contain my excitement, or my urine.    
Once again on the bus I waited, as it lumbered across the city towards my one bedroom apartment.    
The bus eased and moaned to a stop just down the street from where I lived.    
Stepping off, I ran down the street, my arms flailing behind me.    
Dashing up the stairs and fumbling threw my keys for the right one, I finally got inside and ripped open the box with Yule tide glee, though it was October.    
Turning the fancy machine on, I ran it through initial setup and connected it to Wi-Fi by entering my password, “NormiesCanSuckIt420069”.    
Bingo, I’m in.    
My fingers could not type fast enough, as I clicked my way to where I had left off.    
I knew I should studying.    
There were multiple mid-terms tomorrow, but no matter, they could wait.    
This was more important, this is everything.    
I inhaled the words into my mind as my 👀’s poured across the screen.    
Before I even had a chance to understand the ramifications of what I had just done with my time, the sun was coming up.   
Cactus cooler colored light began pissing through my window.    
“Shit”, I thought.   
“Now what?”, I mentally proclaimed.     
I began to be very worried, but more over come with exhaustion because I realized I had gotten,    

No Sleep.

Well, after taking some advice from people both online and offline, I made my choice on how I was going to tackle the locked door. The plan I decided to go with, for better or worse, was to let my stepdad and close friend (of over 15 years) know about the locked door. After telling them, the plan was a safe one in my opinion: we would take two double-barrels I inherited from my father, some ammunition, a bright flashlight, and a phone for recording. Then we would go down there and find out what’s what. I brought up the whole thing to my friend first, who was totally not into it. He is really squeamish when it comes to both medical stuff and anything hinting of the paranormal, so he told me I should call the cops and be done with it. I managed to convince him when I told him about the double-barrels.

Next, I called my stepdad on the phone. As I guessed, he didn’t even mention being freaked out or even contacting the authorities. The first thing he wanted to do was barge through that door. I had to talk him out of going down there alone with no flashlight or protection. Eventually, I got him to agree to the plan. We all decided to go down there early Tuesday morning, when my mom was at work. You see, my mom has several health conditions which require her to keep her stress levels low. She is already a worrywart, so we agreed to not tell her about any of this. My stepdad had no issue taking off work, because he was 100% going to find out what was in his basement. As for my friend and I, we both had plenty of PTO to spare.

The series of events I’m about to describe are a bit hazy so forgive me. This whole thing was just absurd and frankly, I’ve never felt so disturbed in my life. When traveling through the unfinished part of the basement to reach the crawlspace, we heard noises. And quite a few of them. The first time I had explored, I had heard just one faint sound. This time, what we heard was louder and there were at least 5 occurrences. I don’t remember the exact ratio, but it was a mix of scrapes, low tones, and light banging. I think they were similar to the noises I used to hear in my bedroom above, just sharper and more distinct. All 3 of us picked up on this, and my friend naturally wanted to turn back. I got him to keep going for now. When we reached the crawlspace, I realized the floor was more damp than last time and that weird odor I smelled was stronger. Whatever it was really smelled rotten, and it almost made my friend gag. It wasn’t a normal rotting smell though. I can’t really explain it but there was something else in that smell that was almost otherworldly. Thinking back, maybe that dampness on the floor wasn’t water after all. Anyway, we descended the staircase and reached the locked door.

The only thing I remember clear as day about this whole thing was that the door had been tampered with since last time. Something had either opened it, or damaged it from the inside. I didn’t tell my friend and stepdad this, because I didn’t want to turn around. We made it so far. My stepdad took the second key from his pocket, and unlocked the door. Things get really weird from here on, unfortunately.

It began with us going through the door and entering a corridor that was earthy and even more unfinished than the basement. This place didn’t look like it belonged in the suburbs. The rotting smell was extremely strong and my friend bailed out at that point, taking the recording phone back up the stairs with him. I was using my phone as our light source, since we forgot that bright flashlight I had mentioned, so I couldn’t begin recording ( I know, I know). My stepdad and I kept going for some unknown amount of time, down a series of dirty paths until we hit an open area. Visibility was bad there, and the smell was overwhelming.

That’s when my stepdad walked ahead of me into the dark. I think I tried to hold him from going, but he just went right on. He went so far I couldn’t see him or hear his steps. That open area must have been pretty large. After maybe a minute I heard him abruptly call my name, yell out in pain, and fire his double-barrel. It was then I heard something else. I’m honestly having trouble putting it to words but I think it was like an inhuman shriek and an odd buzzing sound. The buzzing almost sounded like maybe a noisy ceiling light, and kept going after the shriek. My stepdad came back into the light of my phone and I could see his forearm was bleeding from what I think was a claw wound or something. He told me something slashed him but he thinks he hit it when he fired. We needed to get the heck out of there and call the police. As we ran out, I remember the buzzing sound was still going. It was almost like it filled the whole area and stopped once we closed the mystery door. At the top of the stairs, it was dead silence again. Everything that just happened felt like a dream to me. We left the unfinished basement area and met my friend in the finished part.

Turns out my buddy had already called the police and gave a lowdown because they showed up pretty fast after we fled. I informed them, after my friend left us, we found some creature down there and my stepdad fired his gun, after it attacked. They then had some paramedics come to bring him to the ER, since his wound was bleeding quite a bit. A pair of cops went down to investigate after I outlined the schematics and told them where the hidden door was. Oddly, it almost felt like they might have already known about the door, but that might just be me reading things wrong. I gave them both keys, and they went through the first door. About 30 minutes later they came back and said there was nothing down there anymore, but they managed to collect a sample of what they called blood. They said they found it in an open earthy room near some empty ammo shells. It was thick and dark, and like nothing I’ve ever seen before.

Things got weird after the police wrapped up their report with us. They told my friend and I to not mention this whole ordeal to anyone in the press, and to make sure to tell the same to my step father. If we were needed any further, we would be contacted.  Other than that, it would be best for us to forget about all of this and “never enter that section of the basement again”.

Well, fast forward to Tuesday evening, and my mom was obviously informed of this whole thing after my stepdad went to the ER. She wasn’t thrilled and now wants to move out ASAP. On top of that, she just called me earlier today (Wednesday) and told me a couple of suits showed up at their front door. They informed my parents that they were federal agents and they needed access to the locked part of the basement. They also said my parents may have to move out of the house, and the feds would pay them for it in cash.

How the feds knew about our situation, I’m not sure, but I assume the cops told them. Anyhow, my mom apparently let them go down there a couple hours ago and they still haven’t come back up yet. She went in my room to listen once they went through the first locked door but never heard anything. This whole situation is honestly so screwed up at this point. I haven't slept well since this whole thing went down and I have several questions with no answers. What happens if the agents don’t come back up? Should I tell my parents to stay in a hotel or something? And most importantly, what the heck did my stepdad shoot at? I’m scared, really scared.

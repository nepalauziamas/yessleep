We had no idea who those fingerprints might've belonged to. Caroline wanted to get a hotel for the night, and now I had to agree. There was no way I’d be able to sleep in that house another night without developing an alcohol dependency. 

“Let’s get a nice room in town,” we were both walking upstairs. I had a knife clenched in my fist. “I don’t want to stay at some chain known for swinger parties off the interstate after all this.”

“You don’t have to sell me,” I said.

We checked all the rooms and even looked behind the shower curtain before we took out our suitcases and got to packing. It didn’t take me long to pack but Caroline was being thorough, making sure we wouldn’t have to come back any time soon for something she forgot. 

When I was done, I went into the den. I took one last look around with the flashlight. I was just about to leave when it caught my eye. 

Where one of the sideways boards met the den wall that separated the room from our bedroom, there was the crescent scar of a Sawzall in the wood. Just a slight half circle, shoulder width. A door, I realized. A door in the side of the subfloor that someone could crawl through. 

I kicked the shape hard and quick with my heel. It didn’t budge. It seemed like the little trap door probably only opened out, not in. 

“Caroline!” I yelled over my shoulder and she dropped something on the bath tile and ran to me. 

“What? What is it?” She stood in the doorway.

“Get the DeWalt.”

I was stupid. I should’ve been more cautious. I should’ve just burned the house down. But in that moment, I felt more angry than afraid. I wasn’t going to let some freak or even some ghost terrorize us in our home. 

Caroline could hardly see the scar in the wood. She didn’t think there was a door. 

I found an eye hook in the garage and we drilled it into the trap door to give it a makeshift handle so we could pull it outwards. I bore out the wood door with a six-inch bit and fitted in the eye bolt.

I set my hand on the cold stainless steel and angled it so it took hold. I looked at Caroline and pulled. The piece fell from its place and we both jumped back. 

Now the entrance was a black crescent. Now I wasn’t so angry anymore. Cold fear crept back down my spine. *Were there eyes looking out from that darkness?*

“We need to leave and call the police,” said Caroline. 

“Ok. Ok finish up packing. I can call the detective back.”

She raised her brow at me and looked at the hole. “Get out of this room.” 

“Don’t worry about it,” she started walking back to the bathroom, but I turned toward the little black passageway. 

I’d just take a quick look in, I told myself. There was no way I’d ever crawl through that hellish hole, but I’d just shine the light in quick. 

I had to know what was under our bedroom floor all this time. I couldn’t just turn around and walk out. 

My heart fluttered in my chest. I turned my phone flashlight back on and squatted so I was level with the entrance.

I brought the light up so I could see in.

I’ve never felt such a jolt of fear. Illuminated in the white light just past the entrance was a bearded face, pale and smiling back at me. 

I fell backwards screaming. I heard Caroline call out my name. But someone was on top of me. They brought down something heavy on my head, and the world went black. 

\_\_\_\_ 

I woke up nauseous to the muffled sound of voices. I was in pitch dark with my hands were bound at my belly.

“You have no idea,” I heard a deep baritone begin above me. “How long I’ve been waiting for this. How many times I wanted to reveal myself and tell you.”

“You fuck!” I heard Caroline scream. 

“Sometimes when I watched you make love, I wanted to burst from the floor just to say hello. Oh,” the man laughed. “What your expressions would be.”

“If you killed him, I swear to god.”

“Hey! Hey!” I yelled. There was a ceiling a few inches from my forehead and I banged my head against it.

“Michael?!” Caroline shouted back.

“Here! I’m here!” I was wedged in between something rough and dusty. I realized I was in the subfloor beneath our bedroom. 

“See, he was just out for a little bit. I wouldn’t just kill him. I’ve always wanted him to hear this, too.” 

“Caroline, run!”

“I can’t,” I heard her cry. “I can’t. My hands. They’re tied.” 

“I understand the little reunion, but if you too aren’t quieter I’m going to kill you, Caroline, while he listens. Do you want to feel your wife’s blood trickle onto your face through the floor?”

I said nothing. 

“Good.”

“I killed you,” I heard Caroline say quieter. “I dragged your body…”

“I knew you’d run that poor bastard over.”

“Who was it then?” her voice cracked with a cry. “Who did I kill?”

“Oh, the kind of person no one notices is even gone. The kind of person who will stand on a wooded street all night for 100 dollars. I’m sorry, but I had to do it. I needed you to think you were free of me. I was sloppy, my sweetheart. I wanted to be a part of your life. To watch the whole thing unfold. But you were always watching for me. I even buried him for you so you could never get in trouble.”

“Please don’t hurt us,” I heard Caroline whimper. 

“Did you know I saw you as a little girl? Did you know that? It sounds mad, but I’ve loved you since then. Since I saw all three feet of you standing behind your mother at a vigil to find her lost cousin. You were so beautiful. But I knew I’d have to wait. I knew I’d have apply patience I never have before.”

“Please.”

He ignored her and kept talking. “This was my mother’s home. We fixed it up together. When she died, I was able to have much more fun here. But then I heard you and your husband were looking for a home. I priced it so low I knew you’d put in an offer. And for the last five years,” I heard his voice grow louder with a kind of pleasure. “I slept just a few feet under you. Every single night. I slept so soundly with my girls. Knowing one day I’d add you to their eternal mix.”

*My Girls.* I thought. I leaned my head out to feel what I was sandwiched between. Soft tickle of hair on both sides. Bodies on both sides. 

The nine bodies he first locked in the floor were now beneath the bedroom. 

“I took out all their innards. I smoked the moisture from their corpses like meat. Isn’t that *incredible?* Nine bodies just feet from where you sleep, and you don’t smell a thing.”

I heard Caroline scream and I beat my head against the floor. “I’ll fucking kill you!” 

“Oh, calm down, Michael. If only you understood how well I’ve come to know you, too.”

I heard him stand and the floor above me began to jostle. He lifted up an entire section of the bedroom floor, revealing light that burned my concussed brain. The man bent over to look down at me. He was older, with a long, black beard that had begun to gray. 

“This is where I’d come and go. I always thought this door is where you’d discover me. Funny how that is. Never would I have thought you’d tear up that old den. You didn’t even bother to get the lights working in there.” 

I scooched on top of the body to my left so I could see Caroline. Her hands were bound in front of her as well. 

I caught her eye and spoke what I figured would be some of my last words. “I love you so much. Caroline, I love you!” 

Caroline seemed too shocked to respond. But when the man looked at me, I noticed she took the time to wriggle her hands a little. Her bindings were loose.

“It was difficult to know when I could come out. Ever since you both started working from here this little project took on a new level of patience. But my brother was nice enough to help me. He’d let me know when you both left. You’ve met him, haven’t you? Greg. I told him I’d share some of your killing with him in return. Pfff. Like I’d ever share *you.* My lifelong project.” 

The man looked at me and Caroline and nodded, pleased with himself. “What do you think?” He brought his arms up and let them slap at his sides. 

“A masterpiece, isn’t it?” 

“I think you’re fucked,” said Caroline. She threw off her bindings and sprinted from the bedroom. 

The man recoiled in shock and stumbled a moment before pursuing her. 

“Caroline!” I pulled my legs up and struggled to contort my body enough so I could stand through the hole in the floor. 

I heard hard thumps. Caroline screamed down the hall. 

“No, no, no! Caroline!”

I managed to stand, and I jumped out of the subfloor. When I found my footing I started running, hoping to use my momentum to charge into our attacker.

There was another thump and then the whine of a drill. When I got to the doorway to the den, I was just in time to see.

Caroline and the man were wedged in one of the sections of subfloor and she had the heel of her hand pressed hard into the back of the DeWalt. The six-inch bit I’d put on the drill to bore out the wood board was all the way depressed into the man’s eye socket. 

She rotated the drill, screaming while stirring his brains like soup. 

Despite the fear and the gore, I swear in that moment I’ve never loved that woman more.

“Caroline! Caroline, he’s gone. He’s dead!” 

She leaned back on her knees and let the drill fall. The long bit slowly slid from his eye socket. 

“Fucker!” She punched him across the face with her right hand. Then with her left. Again, and again. I couldn’t hold her hands to stop her.  
 

“Caroline, snap out of it. Untie me! The neighbor. His brother. He could be coming.”  

Her head bolted upright, and she stood and stepped into the hall. 

“Come here,” she said and quickly undid the knot to my bindings.

I flung my arms around her and squeezed. “I love, you.”

“The neighbor…”

“We’ll call the police. We’ll get in the car get somewhere safe and call the police.”

I saw my phone on the floor from where it fell when he’d first attacked me. I stepped down into the den and picked it up.

“What’re you doing?”

“Calling the fucking police!”

She hit the phone from my hand, and it clacked back down to the subfloor. 

“What the hell?”

Caroline leaned down and scooped up the drill. She walked to our bedroom and I followed her in. “What’re you doing?” 

She pinched the blinds and looked out the window.

“Greg,” she said. “His lights are off. His truck is there. He’s home and he’s unaware.”

“Great. Let’s call the police.”

“Five years, Michael. They did this to us for five years.” There was a fury in her eyes I’d never seen before. 

“I know. Believe me, I know.”

“I’m going to pay Greg a visit.”

“What do you mean?”

She nodded down at the drill. 

“What?! It doesn’t matter what he did. If you break in and kill him when you could’ve called the police that’s still murder.”

She shrugged and started walking past me. “We’ll hide his body,” she turned back and clicked the drill trigger a couple times. Blood spun off the bit.

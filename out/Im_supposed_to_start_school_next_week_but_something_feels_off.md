I got a strange email today from my new school. I had to transfer when I moved, so my mom found a school near where we lived and it was announced I would be going there in the fall. 

Now, with school rapidly approaching, it is time to start thinking of the bigger picture, like orientation and meeting new people. With only a week left of summer, an email was sent out about orientation. I curiously clicked on it, wondering what would be in store for me. When I opened it though, I was a bit shocked to read it. 

Dear Maxine, 

We welcome you to Somnium School. We are looking forward to seeing you next week. However, with new schools comes new rules. Luckily for you, and other new students, our school has a few simple and easy rules to follow. The rules are as listed:

-If you see someone in the hallway that looks like you, AVOID contact and keep walking. Make sure to tell a faculty member about it. 

-Sometimes, students will go missing. This is normal, do not be alarmed. At the end of each day, a tally of who is missing will be emailed to everyone, along with names and pictures. Again, if you see someone that looks like them, please alert a faculty member. 

-No talking during lunch. If you make even the slightest noise, there will be punishments. 

-Monotone yellow wallpaper, fluorescent lights, and moist carpet appearing at the end of hallways is normal. However, if you would prefer to not go missing, turn the other way. 

-If anyone announces a party, don’t go. 

-Finally, if you are a good student, you will stay in your classroom at all times during the learning period. Hearing screams and weird noises is normal. Do not be alarmed. Bathroom breaks will be scheduled, and you will need to be silent during those. 

If you follow all these rules, you will have a great and productive, fun year at Somnium School!! 

Looking forward to seeing you, 

-Somnium School 

I read through the email, once more just to make sure I’m not missing anything. Something is off about this. Maybe it is just a prank sent by an Upper Classman. I draw a shaky breath before walking downstairs to see my mother in the kitchen. I decide to ask if she got the email. 

“Hey, Mom? Somnium School sent me a weird email.”

“Oh, I got one too since I am starting to work as a faculty member. I am sure it is just a prank.” She says, smiling at me. 

“You are going to be a faculty member? Don’t you have like, no teacher training?” I ask. 

“Oh, right… yeah.” She looks confused but brushes it off. 

I stand there, looking at her cooking a meal. The thing is, my mother doesn’t cook. 

“Uh, I am going outside for some fresh air.” I say, hastily making up an excuse. 

“No. It’s raining, Marlene.”

“Mom… my name is Maxine.”

I look outside the window. Nothing but sun. 

“Be back!” I quickly say, slipping on my shoes and grabbing my phone. I run out the door before she has a moment to protest. 

Something is off about my mother, and for some reason it feels connected to this school. 

¿?¿?

A couple hours have passed, so I decide to go home. Maybe she will be okay. 

I open the front door, and see my mother sitting on the couch. Any remnants of food earlier are gone. 

“Maxine! Where were you?” She asks, panic in her voice. 

“I went outside like I told you.”

“You didn’t, Max. I got home only like 30 minutes ago and you weren’t here.”

“No, mom, you were here earlier.” I exclaim. 

“I wasn’t, sweetie.” 

My breath runs cold. 

That woman I saw earlier? She wasn’t my mother. 

“Everything alright, Maxine?” She asks. 

“I just need to lie down.” I lie, and run up to my room. 

Except it isn’t my room. 

Its a hallway, and at the end?

Monotone yellow wallpaper, fluorescent lights, and carpet that looks moist. 

I turn around, about to run back down the stairs, but they have disappeared. I look around, but the room is getting closer, and closer, and closer. 

I hold my breath and close my eyes. 

I need to get away.

Hi I'm Nack, but my name changes a lot.
  When this whole shitshow happened I was known as Logan. I made the mistake of going to camp, with my twin brother Alec.
 He'd never had as many problems with identity as I have, or at least as far as I know he hadn't.

 We went to camp for a week it was called Marygrove.
 Biologically we were born female, and so we were allowed entry into an all girls camp which we had signed up for completely by accident as there is a male counterpart to the camp on the other side of the lake.

 It started out pretty normal other than one of the camp staff insisting on us being in a very specific cabin, we agreed, not thinking much of it at the time.

 That was a horrible mistake I regret to this day.
 Three days later it started.

 I'm saying it because I still don't entirely understand what happened.

 At around 1AM the staff that made us sleep in this cabin came to the door.
 I'm a really light sleeper but my brother is not.

 Which is why I was confused when the staff tapped him and he got up without a word.

 I got my hiking boots on and followed them, thankfully I hadn't changed into pyjamas.

 Now I know you might think it weird to follow them, but my brother absolutely loves sleeping and would never give it up for anything short of an emergency and even then we'd still have to battle him for it.

 So seeing him get up so peacefully was more than a little strange, They went towards the lake and I hid behind this great big old tree, It was quite possibly the biggest tree I've ever seen if I'm honest and what I saw there was horrifying.

 The kind, motherly lady that had seemed strange at first but quickly won us over reminding me of our recently deceased Grandfather in a weird way.

 She brought him down to the waters edge, and opened her mouth impossibly wide.

 It looked like she had broken her jaw.
 But what confused me was Alec didn't even react.

 He just stood there, while a long claw like thing stretched out from the ladies mouth or throat I'm not entirely sure I wasn't close enough to see that much detail.
 The thing, I guess it was more of a tongue but it looked sharper, plunged into his mouth and after extracting something it disappeared like it was never there in the first place. The lady told him to swim to the middle of the lake and drown himself.
 I watched him calmly walk toward the lake and start swimming.
 Now I'm a track runner and I've won medals before. So when I realized the lady had seen me and was walking towards me, I booked it.

 I sprinted up to the builders quarters as there was some maintenance being done on the other side of camp, slammed the door and locked it probably scaring the shit out of the three construction workers there now that I think about it.
 At this point I was all but hysterical over what I'd seen and the guys seemed to understand something was wrong so when I started frantically trying to blockade the door.
 They jumped up to help and together, we moved one of the massive wooden bunk-beds infront of the door.

 I explained what happened and they agreed to take me home.
 I'm now sitting in my bed writing this mostly hoping for some closure.
 But I'd also appreciate some help figuring out what the bloody hell happened.

 Honestly I think I'm still in shock.

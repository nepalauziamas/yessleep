⚠️ONLY POLISH PEOPLE WILL UNDERSTAND⚠️

So, this happened about a week ago. It was a sunny weekend and I(M35) decided to go out with my son(M7) to a park, maybe even some playground. He was very happy about it and not a 5 minutes later we were ready to go.

We did many things together, but that's not important. He was very happy back then, until we became hungry. I, not suspecting what will happend next, have decided to go buy some donuts from the nearby bakery, said 𝓟𝓪𝓿𝓮𝓵𝓮𝓴.. 

When i got there with my son, an elderly man came up to me. His car has broke and he needed some help to get it off the road. There wasn't anyone close so i have decided to help the poor man with pushing his car somewhere aside. I have told my son to stay in the line inside the bakery, but when i got back, he wasn't there. In fact, the whole bakery was empty. I asked the cashier if he had seen him. He has told me that my son begged him to let him in the staff bathroom. He showed my son the way to the toilet and let him in. He told me that my boy is probably still there and hasn't left since.

While i was waiting for my son's return, i have started to feel a little hungry. As i waited for him to come out, my hunger Has risen to the point where i could eat basically anything. That's when i have decided to buy myself a donut. You see, this bakery was very famous for it's unusual, but tasty flavours. The for example cucumber donuts, cheese donuts, or, my favorite, mayonaisse donut with a little salad inside. These kind of donuts weren't anything unusual here. That day i have decided to try the beef donut, the one i haven't eaten yet. It was sweet, but the meat was still very distinct. One of the better ones i'd say.

After the meal i opened my phone and played a small gamę on it for a while. hovewer, as the minutes passed, my son still didnt return. I, already starting to get a little worried, since he was out for quite some time, asked the cashier if i can go to the toilet and check on him. Once he agreed and showed me the way, i went there and opened the doors. The window next to stalls was wide open.

And my son wasn't there.

I was slowly starting to panic. The cashier told me that he will go check the monitoring, but nothing got caught. I called the police and moments later they were checking the place. Those were the longest two yours of my life. I have also called my wife to ask if my son has gone back home alone, and she told me that he hasn't showed up at the doors.

Unfortunatelly, the cops didnt find anything. They said that my son was either abducted, or he ran away. Either way he was announced missing.

It was a week ago. I still haven't Heard anything about him. I tried everything: asking my neighbours, hanging some photos of him, etc. I have even announced a high reward for finding him alive. Can you guys tell me what else could i do? I really really miss my son.

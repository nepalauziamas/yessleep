When I was eight years old, I was badly burnt in a car fire.  My single mother had been driving me to school when she lost control of her Toyota Camry on the icy January road and went crashing into a ditch.  The car caught fire, and Mum managed to drag me out, but the damage had already been done.  I had sustained second to third-degree burns on fifty percent of my body; my limbs had gotten the worst of it.  Mum herself was unharmed, save for bruising on her ribs and a cut across her nose.

I spent the next four months in the burn unit at British Columbia Children's Hospital, and the place quickly became a second home.  Doctors worked tirelessly to save me.  I underwent a total of fifty operations, including skin grafts and the amputation of all five fingers on each hand.  I had an endless stream of visitors, but rarely was my mother among them.

One morning, about a week into my hospital stay, my dad stopped by with a bouquet of colourful tulips and a blue balloon.  His girlfriend, Jenny, came with him.  Dad had been divorced from Mum for two years, but it had been an amicable split, and he was still very much involved in my life.

"Daddy, why doesn't Mummy come see me?" I asked.  My words were garbled, given I could barely move my burned lips, but Dad seemed to understand.

"Oh, honey."  He sighed, ruffling what was left of my charred hair.  "Mummy loves you, more than anyone else in the world. That's why she doesn't come by very often; it hurts her to see *you* hurt."

"But I miss her."

"She misses you too, honey. But Mummy... well, Mummy has some problems. It's difficult for a girl your age to understand."

"Is she sick?"

"No, no, honey," Jenny piped up.  She bent down and kissed my bandaged cheek.  "Just... well, like your daddy said, it's hard to explain."

I knew, even back then, that Mum wasn't quite right in the head.  I believe that's why Dad left her, but he still cared about her a great deal; not once since the divorce had I heard him say a single negative word about her.

"Will Mummy get better?" I asked.

"She might never be quite 'normal', Julia. But she'll get better. She will always be your mummy."

I never resented my mother for her absence.  I guess I was a lot more understanding than most kids my age.  Besides, Mum more than made up for it, sending me care packages and letters saying how much she loved me.  She promised to throw me a party when I came home, complete with cake and dancing.

I believe it was Mum's love that got me through the pain.

After four long months, I was finally allowed to go home.  My burns were still healing, leaving me with tight, warped skin that itched and throbbed every minute of the day.  My hands had been reduced to bulbous stumps at the end of each arm, I was stuck in a wheelchair, and had to wear compression garments to reduce scarring.  Still, I was home, and that made it all worth it.

As promised, Mum threw me a party.  Family, friends, and neighbours all came to celebrate my recovery.  I couldn't dance, but I had a great time anyway.  Mum kept kissing me and telling me how much she loved me.  "Julia, you are a *fighter.* I am so proud of you."

She smiled, her blue eyes glittering, but I had noticed the blue half-moons beneath them, as well as her hollowed-out cheekbones and threads of silver woven into her shiny auburn hair.  She was still so beautiful, but looked older than her thirty-five years.

That night, I woke up in pain, my skin itching as if I had fire ants crawling all over me, a deep phantom ache in my amputated fingers.  I opened my mouth to call out for Mum, but the compression mask on my face and the taught skin beneath made moving my lips painful.  I tried to sit up, but it hurt too much.  A whimper escaped me, and salty tears rolled down my cheeks.

Then I sensed a presence, something watching me from a dark corner.  It didn't feel malevolent, but it made my spine tingle.  Glancing nervously over my shoulder, I was shocked to see a dark figure standing in a corner, motionless save for the gentle rise and fall of their chest as they breathed.

Quickly, before I could lose my nerve, I reached over and switched on my bedside lamp.  A weak yellow glow broke through the shadows, and there was a sharp intake of breath as the figure shrank back at the light.

It was a little girl, no older than myself.  She wore a yellow T-shirt and flowery pink shorts.  She was grotesquely deformed.  Her flesh appeared to be *melting* off her body, hanging in heavy folds and bags.  It was blackened in areas, pink and raw in others.  She was completely bald, and not only that, but her scalp had been charred away, revealing a pearl-white skull beneath.  Her eyes were impossibly large, lacking eyelids, and had such heavy cataracts her pupil were invisible.  Her arms were shrivelled and curled up grotesquely at her sides.  But the worst part was her mouth.  Her lower jaw hung down at an impossible angle, and seemed to have fused to her chest, leaving her face in a permanent scream.

I nearly screamed myself.  I had never seen anything so horrible, and it scared me shitless.  But before I could make a sound, the girl raised a shrivelled hand and brought it to her gaping mouth, as if trying to *shush* me.  I shrunk back against the headboard, shaking, as this mysterious apparition approached me.  It appeared she was trying to speak, but her frozen jaw made that physically impossible.  She placed her hand on my shoulder, and when I forced myself to look into her eyes, I saw compassion.  I saw *love.*

"Who are you?" I whimpered.

She gently pushed me back into a reclining position, tucked the covers around my scarred, wounded body, and smoothed back my hair.  Then she turned and walked silently out of the room, leaving the door open just a crack.

I was shaken.  But the pain was gone, replaced by the pleasant sensation of being bathed in warm water.  Somehow, despite my fear, I fell asleep.

I never told Mum what I'd seen.  She was already so shaken up over my accident, and I didn't want to give her more to worry about.  But I couldn't stop thinking about the little melting girl, and part of me wanted to see her again.

Days later, I returned to school.  My friends were all delighted to have me back, but many kids avoided me, and some were downright mean.  I was still learning how to perform everyday tasks without fingers, which only added a new layer of challenges to the adjustment.  During this time, Mum seemed somewhat out of touch with reality.  I often caught her staring into space or humming to herself.  Sometimes, she would look at me and cry.  Dad and Jenny came over a lot to help, and Dad tried talking Mum into seeing a therapist, but she always refused.

Three years passed, and I made remarkable progress.  I began walking again, and my burns healed better than my doctors expected.  Mum met a wonderful man named David, and they got married when I was eleven.  I now had a stepfather and stepsister, and adored them both.  By then, I had mostly forgotten about the little melting girl.

Around that time, I was entering puberty, which can cripple the self-esteem of even the most beautiful girls.  As well as my injuries had healed, I still had a lot of scarring, and was missing my left breast.  My appearance made me a prime target for bullying.  One day, when I was walking home from school, a group of older girls followed me home and threw rocks at me.  I ran into the house, crying, and shut myself in my room.

I sobbed for over an hour, feeling like a total freak, hideous and unlovable.  As I lay on my bed, face buried in a pillow, I felt a hand smooth back my hair.

Mum and David were still at work, and my sister Ava was at band practice.  Alarmed, I rolled over and met her cloudy gaze.

The melting girl.  She still wore the same outfit, and hadn't aged a bit.  Her appearance wasn't nearly as shocking the second time around, but I couldn't stifle a frightened squeal.

"It's you," I gasped.

She nodded, before reaching into the pocket of her shorts and removing a tissue.  I sniffled and blew my nose.  "What are you doing here?"

The melting girl walked over to my desk and scribbled something on a sheet of notebook paper.  She held it up so that I could read: *Kids can be cruel*, it said.

"I'm so ugly," I whimpered.  "I'm a monster."

She shook her head, then jotted down a second note: *A few scars mean nothing. You've got beautiful blue eyes, gorgeous, shiny golden hair, and the perfect bone structure. You are amazing.*

I suddenly felt pretty shitty for sobbing over my own deformities to this girl who barely looked human anymore.  "Are you just saying that to make me feel better?"

She shook her head, then placed her hand over her heart.  I didn't know what that meant, but I guessed it must be a sign of her sincerity.

"Who *are* you?" I demanded.  "Are you a ghost?"

Once again, she left my room without a word.  I tried chasing after her, but she was gone.

After searching the house top to bottom, I figured she *must* be a ghost, and that she had died in the fire that warped her appearance.  But who was she?  What had happened?  Why did only *I* see her?

This time, I told Mum.  I left out most details, but stated I believed a little ghost girl was haunting our house.  She went whiter than the moon, and her eyes grew shimmery with tears, but she forced a laugh and said, "Oh, Julia. Such an imagination."

She seemed so upset that I didn't dare press the matter.  But the following day, after school, I made a surprise visit to Dad and Jenny's place.

"Julia, hi!"  Jenny greeted me at the door, her two-year-old baby girl on her hip.  "What a pleasant surprise!"

"Is my dad home?"

"Yes, he's in his office. I'll go get him."  Dad worked from home as a graphic designer, and often became so engrossed in his work he forgot to eat.  But I knew he would want to see me.

After catching up over iced tea, I told Dad I wanted to ask him a question about Mum.  I reminded him that I was almost twelve years old and had a right to know, and that he had to be honest with me.

"Okay, Julia. I'll do my best. What is it?"

"What happened in Mum's past?" I asked him.  "Why is she so... *strange* sometimes?"

Dad hesitated, biting his lip, and I lost my temper.

"Tell me, dammit!" I snapped.

"Julia! Calm down."  Jenny put a steadying hand on my shoulder.  Dad flushed and rubbed his temples.  "Baby, I'm sorry," he said.  "I'll tell you everything I know, okay?"

"Okay."  I took a deep breath.  "Okay."

Dad poured himself more iced tea and pinched the bridge of his nose.  "Even *I* don't know a whole lot about it. When I met your mother, she was an orphan at twenty-one, and claimed not to have anyone except her grandmother. It wasn't until a whole *year* into our relationship that she finally confessed there had been a terrible accident in her childhood. She refused to elaborate."

I sank back against the couch cushion, defeated.  "So you don't know either?"

"No. I'm sorry, honey."

"Would she tell me if *I* asked her?"

"I don't think that's a good idea, Julia," said Dad.  Jenny, sitting next to me on the couch, nodded.

I left their house in a frustrated daze, feeling even *more* confused than before.  The mystery of Mum and the little melting girl was like a constant itch that couldn't be scratched, and the idea that I might never get any answers infuriated me.

This time, five years passed before I saw her again.  At sixteen, I my confidence had improved.  I had friends, good grades, and a serious boyfriend who accepted me as I was, scars and all.  That said, I still had to deal with bullies on a regular basis.  But now, I could stand up for myself.

One day, at lunch, my friends and I were discussing the upcoming school dance and what we would wear.  Rachel Newton, one of the resident mean girls, sneered at me as she and her friends walked by.  "You better not wear anything too short, Crispy. Nobody wants to look at your ugly legs."

"Leave her alone, Rachel."  My friend Clara stood up, hands on her hips.

"What? Don't pretend it isn't true."

"You're such a bitch, Rachel," I snapped.  "Ever considered seeking professional help?"

She scowled.  "Ever considered plastic surgery? It would make looking at you *so* much easier."

I punched her in the nose.  She began screaming as if I'd just gutted her with a butcher knife, alerting a teacher.  She sent me to the principal's office, and while Mrs. Radcliffe was sympathetic, she wouldn't let me off the hook.

"Striking another student is against the rules, Julia. I'm sorry, but I'm going to have to punish you."

She then told me I would have to clean up the football field every day after school for a week.  I understood that I'd been in the wrong to hit Rachel, but I was still pissed.  That afternoon, the sky filled with dark grey clouds, matching my mood.  As I toiled away, picking up garbage and stuffing it into a large plastic bag, Rachel and her little posse approached me.

"Julia, you bitch!"  Rachel's nose was purple and swollen, dried blood crusting her nostrils.  "Look what you did to me!"

"Aw, you upset over losing your precious modelling career?" I taunted.  Rachel's eyes flashed dangerously, and she lunged at me, knocking me to the soggy grass.

"Rachel!" one of her friends yelled.  "Back off!"

I rolled onto my belly and tried to push myself into a kneeling position, but Rachel kicked me in the ribs, knocking me down again.

"I don't think picking up garbage is punishment enough, Crispy."  Rachel brought her foot down on my back, pinning me in place.  "What do you think, girls?"

"Hell yeah!"

"Get her, Rachel!"

"Stop it! She's had enough."

I began thrashing beneath Rachel's foot, trying to throw off her balance.  Dirt filled my mouth.  My spine felt seconds away from snapping.  I sensed Rachel's fury, her intent on hurting me.

She stooped down and grabbed a handful of my hair, wrenching my head back, and raised her fist, ready to land a punch.  I was alone, at this girl's mercy, and I couldn't fight back.

"Help," I whispered.

Rachel's grip suddenly fell away.  She staggered back, her eyes the size of dinner plates, mouth hanging open.  Her friends looked equally stunned.

"Oh, my God. What *is* that?"

I followed her appalled gaze to a melted, deformed figure standing twenty feet away.  The little melting girl's cloudy eyes were blazing with anger, and her blackened fists kept clenching and unclenching.  I was so overjoyed I wanted to cry.

"What the fuck?" Rachel shrieked again.  "Who *is* that?"

The girl let out an enraged scream and charged like a raging bull.

My tormenters took off into the mist, shrieking like banshees.  The girl walked over and helped me to my feet.

"*Thank* you," I breathed.

In her eyes, I saw her words: *Let's go home.*

She held my hand until we were a block away from the house.  Then she hugged me and walked away.

This time, I told Mum *everything.*  When I described the girl's appearance, she burst into tears.

"Oh, God... oh, my God... Julia..." she sobbed.

"Mum! What is it?"

She pulled me into a crushing hug, her chest heaving as she fought for air.  "That girl... she's my *sister.*"

I was frozen.  "What?"

Mum wiped her eyes.  "Oh, honey... I guess I can't hold back any longer."

Finally, after sixteen years, I got to know my mother.

She grew up on a farm in Saskatchewan, with her twin sister, Sarah, and their parents.  They lived a happy life until an arsonist set the barn on fire.  The girls were inside at the time.  In a frantic attempt to escape, Sarah fell and broke her leg.  Mum ran to get help, but by then, it was too late.  The fire had spread out of control, and Sarah couldn't be saved.

The fire completely broke Mum.  She didn't speak for almost a year, and four years later, her parents were killed in a car accident.  Mum never recovered emotionally.  To this day, I can only imagine what she went through.

"When you got hurt... it brought back so many terrible memories. I couldn't face it. I was a *coward*, Julia. I'm so sorry."

"Don't be."  I kissed her cheek.  "You're the best mother, and I love you."

She wiped her nose.  "*I've* seen Sarah a few times since she died, but I convinced myself I was dreaming. But it seems she's been watching over *you* too."

"Like a guardian angel?"

"She *is* a guardian angel."

That night, I prayed for the first time in years and thanked God for sending down Sarah.

Twenty-one years have passed since that day.  I have a successful career; I'm married; I have children.  I still see Sarah every now and then, but I don't need her protection so much anymore.  I've grown strong and confident.  I've come a long way.

I can't explain Sarah's presence in my life, and I guess I don't need to.  I'm just so thankful to have her around.  She's been there for me during my darkest hours, protected me from a cruel world when I was at my most vulnerable.

My only regret is that Sarah, unlike me, never got a second chance at life.

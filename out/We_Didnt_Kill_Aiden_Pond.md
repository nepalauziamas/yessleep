It was just supposed to be a prank. A fucking joke. That was it! Hell, it was all fucking Derek's idea, not mine, and not anyone else's! We just wanted to fuck with him, y’know? Screw around. That’s it! I swear!

&#x200B;

I swear…

&#x200B;

Fine, fine. Let me start from the beginning. There was this guy back in high school, Aiden Pond. Everyone knew that he was kinda a… Shit, what’s the word here? I dunno. Whatever. He was prone to tantrums though. Like, you could push this guy just a little bit and he’d flip out on you. I’m talking a full meltdown here. It was funny as shit! He’d start screaming, swearing, and get all red in the face. Sometimes he’d even cry.

&#x200B;

My buddies Derek, Jeremy, and I used to tease him a little. We were just having some fun, it wasn’t that serious or anything. He just blew it all out of proportion.

&#x200B;

Like that thing with the mouse! We just wanted to screw with him a little. Jeremy had caught a mouse outside and we thought it would be funny to put it in his desk. So yeah, that's what we did and it was fucking funny!

&#x200B;

Aiden got in, opened the desk to put his binder in, and started losing his shit when he saw the mouse. He must've jumped like a foot in the air. It was hilarious! Then he saw us laughing and put the pieces together. He started crying and yelling at us, telling us what assholes we were. That's what got the teacher involved and naturally, Aiden squealed…

&#x200B;

We got detention for the next three days. I still figured it was all worth it but Derek was pissed. I guess he thought that Aiden had overreacted or something. I dunno. But he wanted to get even with him.

&#x200B;

So he suggested we egg his house.

&#x200B;

We'd got some eggs and were heading over a little after school when we saw Aiden. There was a path that runs along the woods out behind the school. I knew that Aiden usually walked home that way so it wasn’t that surprising that we saw him. It was kinda late to be leaving school, but he was part of a few after school groups so I guess it wasn't that weird for him.

&#x200B;

I remember that he saw us up ahead on the trail. We didn’t have any time to hide without looking more suspicious and he just sorta slowed down once he recognized us, watching us carefully as he did. I knew that he *had* to see the egg carton in Derek's hands… And I remember thinking that the gig was up. But I guess Derek wasn't ready to give up just yet though. Nope. Like I said, I think he took the whole detention thing a little too personally.

&#x200B;

Once Aiden saw us, Derek probably figured that he’d catch on to what we were up to, and squeal on us. Even if we hadn’t done it yet, he’d still squeal. That was just the way he was… So I imagine he just thought: *‘In for a penny, in for a pound.’*

&#x200B;

Before he even threw the first egg, Aiden was screaming like a little kid for him to stop. Derek didn’t care. He just kept fucking throwing eggs at him like a goddamn caveman. Aiden put his hands up to try and cover his face. He backed away, stumbling towards the woods for cover. I saw him spitting out bits of yolk in between his angry screams, saying shit like:

&#x200B;

*“FUCK YOU GUYS! I’M GONNA FUCKING KILL YOU! FUCK YOU!”*

&#x200B;

Derek didn’t give a shit. He just kept throwing eggs and by that point, Jeremy and I had gotten in on the action too. Aiden kept trying to blindly run towards the woods. I don’t think he realized how steep the incline off the path, into the forest was.

&#x200B;

Maybe we could’ve stopped him from falling… Maybe.

&#x200B;

Truth be told though, I don’t think any of us cared… I think we wanted him to fall, just because it would’ve been funny to watch. I think we all just expected Aiden to tumble down into the woods, get up and start screaming at us again, then we’d run off and probably get in more trouble later.

&#x200B;

God… We were all so fucking stupid…

&#x200B;

Aiden fell alright. He went right down that incline and into the woods.

&#x200B;

Derek, Jeremy and I all watched, laughing our asses off the whole time… We laughed, and laughed and laughed… And Aiden just lay there in a heap of limbs on the ground…

&#x200B;

We looked down at him, our laughter slowly getting quieter until suddenly it stopped being so funny. Aiden should’ve gotten up by then… He should’ve been red in the face and swearing at us…

&#x200B;

But he wasn’t.

&#x200B;

He was just lying there… Still. Silent.

&#x200B;

Jeremy was the first one to call out to him. But there was no response. After a few seconds of trying that, he went down. I followed. Derek stayed behind, watching in the vain hope that Aiden would simply get up, get mad and everything would be okay again. We made our way down the incline. We turned Aiden onto his back…

&#x200B;

He wasn’t moving. His eyes were closed. His nose was bleeding. That’s when we started panicking.

&#x200B;

We didn’t know what a dead body looked like so we couldn’t be sure… We didn’t think to check his pulse or check to see if he was breathing. We just panicked.

&#x200B;

Derek came down around that point while we freaked out, thinking we’d just fucking killed Aiden Pond! We didn’t know what to do. Should we just leave him there? Let someone else find him? Play dumb?

No… No, what if they caught us? We’d seen enough crime shows to believe that an entire FBI squad would hunt us down individually if we just let them find the body.

&#x200B;

We considered just dragging him deeper into the woods, but that didn’t seem much better. The ‘woods’ was really just a small patch of forest separating the park from the nearby road. It wasn’t exactly the ideal hiding spot for a body. Someone was bound to find him. We had to get rid of the body somehow… And it was Jeremy who gave us the idea.

&#x200B;

“My Dad’s not home…” He’d said, “We could take him to the backyard…”

&#x200B;

Jeremy’s Dad owned a landscaping company. He lived on a fairly rural property about a few miles away. It wouldn’t be that long of a walk to get there and he kept most of his heavier equipment in the backyard  Lawnmowers, chainsaws, hedge trimmers… And a woodchipper. We’d helped Jeremy’s Dad with the woodchipper plenty of times. When his clients wanted brush taken off their property, he’d usually load it into his truck, bring it home and toss it into the woodchipper.

&#x200B;

We knew how to use it… And considering the predicament we were in, it seemed like a good idea at the time.

&#x200B;

We carried Aiden all the way to Jeremy’s house. Well… I carried him. I’m the one who got volunteered for it since I was the biggest. I put him on my back like it was a piggyback ride… I remember feeling the uncomfortable weight of him as I carried him. I remember feeling the disgust in my stomach as I thought about how Aiden was probably already decaying…

&#x200B;

We cut through a few fields and patches of woods to avoid running into anyone. Looking back at everything, I don’t really know how the hell we didn’t get caught… Dumb luck, maybe? Or maybe the world’s just a quieter, less nosy place than we all think it is. When you’re trying to hide something, you’ll always feel eyes on you even when there aren’t any.

&#x200B;

Once we got to Jeremy’s house, we worked fast. He got the keys to his Dad’s shed and we wheeled the woodchipper out. We took it into the forest for some privacy. Then we did what we came to do.

&#x200B;

Jeremy started up the woodchipper and once it was going, Derek and I lifted Aiden up. We were going to put him in feet first.

&#x200B;

Just as we were ready to let him drop into the spinning blades, I saw his face move. I saw his eyelids flutter. And in the moment before we put him in… I felt a spike of horror rising from my stomach as I realized that we didn’t kill Aiden Pond.

&#x200B;

I wish I could’ve said something… I wish I could’ve stopped it… But I didn’t have time… No… No, that’s bullshit…

&#x200B;

I know it’s bullshit.

&#x200B;

I could’ve said something. I could’ve stopped it. Any fucking one of us could have.

&#x200B;

But as soon as Aiden’s feet went into the woodchipper and he started screaming, we all knew that we weren’t going back. We’d already gone too far. Sure, we could’ve stopped it. Maybe we could’ve saved his life.

&#x200B;

But the fact that we’d gone this far already would’ve already ruined our lives. We were only 15 and we knew that much to be true.

&#x200B;

So we did the only thing that made sense.

&#x200B;

We let him go.

&#x200B;

Aiden struggled and thrashed… Tried to grab the edges of the woodchipper to keep himself from going in. But we forced him in. He screamed and he cried… The sounds he made…

&#x200B;

Oh God…

&#x200B;

The fucking sounds he made… The sounds the woodchipper made as it tore him apart. I won’t ever forget those. Not for the rest of my life.

&#x200B;

We spent almost an hour out there… By the time the woodchipper had gotten through his legs, Aiden was long gone. His body was pale and limp. There was so much fucking blood… We didn’t realize there’d be so much of it. By the time the woodchipper started tearing into his guts, I couldn’t take it anymore. I had to run off into the woods to vomit. It tore through his ribcage, gooey chunks of him sticking to the blades…

&#x200B;

Shortly after that, it jammed.

&#x200B;

When we couldn’t get it to start again, we panicked. Derek took what was left of the body out. Fuck… The mess he made… The bits of Aiden coming out of him.

&#x200B;

The memory makes me sick.

&#x200B;

We didn’t know what to do. We eventually settled on just burying it. Then it came time to deal with the woodchipper. We hadn’t thought this through. We’d thought that maybe there wouldn’t be that much blood. We couldn’t clean it off, not without taking it back to Jeremy’s place and his Mom was definitely home by then. She would’ve seen us. We decided to just leave it in the woods.

&#x200B;

Then there was the matter of our bloody clothes…

&#x200B;

Christ… We didn’t know what to do about that. We considered just stripping them off and leaving them in the woods, but no luck… Eventually, we agreed we’d just sneak into Derek's house, borrow some of his clothes and go home. It didn’t work.

&#x200B;

His Mom saw us coming in and when she did, I remember the way the color drained from her face. She stared at us, covered in blood and shaken from what we’d spent the evening doing. Then she started screaming.

&#x200B;

I don’t blame her.

&#x200B;

Considering what a piss poor job we’d done of covering our tracks, the case was closed pretty quickly.

&#x200B;

Derek refused to talk to the police, but Jeremy and I both cracked almost immediately. No point in lying and digging ourselves into an even deeper pit.

&#x200B;

The three of us were tried as adults… And that was it. Derek got 25 years. A life sentence. Jeremy and I got 15 each. We served our time in the same prison… But we rarely ever saw each other.

&#x200B;

I consider myself lucky that I was ever considered eligible for parole.

&#x200B;

I served 8 years of my sentence. 8 years of my life, gone… But I still had my youth, more or less.

&#x200B;

I don’t want to talk about prison… I don’t want to think about that. I deserved what I got, I know that. We all did.

&#x200B;

Jeremy and I both tried to shut up and serve our time. Get it over with as painlessly as possible. Juvie wasn’t so bad, but when we got transferred to an adult correctional facility, things were a lot rougher. We just kept our heads down and tried to be as close to model prisoners as either of us could be.

&#x200B;

Derek on the other hand chose to be as big a pain in the ass as possible. He was enough of a bastard in juvie that Jeremy and I both started avoiding him, and he only got worse after we were transferred.

&#x200B;

I didn’t see much of him, but I know he spent a lot of time in solitary confinement. Whenever he was allowed back into general population, it was only a matter of months before he’d end up in another fight that would send his ass right back to solitary.

&#x200B;

Naturally, I wasn’t that surprised when he eventually turned up dead.

&#x200B;

The way I heard it, somebody had gotten into his cell in solitary and fucked him up. Nobody knew who. Nobody even had a good guess. The guards just heard him screaming one night and came in to find him damn near gutted and bleeding out. They couldn’t save him (assuming they even bothered to try.) I can’t say I shed any tears for him… If anything, I was almost glad he was dead.

&#x200B;

We’d all taken part in what we did to Aiden. We all deserved the blame… But Derek had been the one who’d fucking started it. It had all originally been his idea. And in the years since I’d always figured he didn’t regret what we’d done. He just regretted that we didn’t do it *better*.

&#x200B;

Me? I just wanted to put it behind me. Move on with my life. Start over and just become somebody else. I knew it wouldn’t change the past… I’d always know what I’d done. I’d never, ever get away from it. I suppose some dumb, juvenile part of me sorta hoped that at the very least Jeremy might get released around the same time I did… I hadn’t heard anything about him possibly being up for parole, but who knows, right? I suppose in the end it didn’t matter…

&#x200B;

Two months before I got out, they found Jeremy lying dead in the showers. I never saw the body… But I heard about the state he was in. Someone had gone to town on him, carving deep gashes in his stomach and legs. They’d apparently damn near torn him open… There was more blood flowing down the drain than there actually was inside of him.

&#x200B;

They’d figured that someone had jumped him in the shower. Jeremy wasn’t really the confrontational sort, but there were some real psychos in that place… All he'd have needed to do was rub the wrong person the wrong way, and that was it.

&#x200B;

I was sad to hear what had happened to him… But unfortunately, he wasn’t the first guy I’d known in that shithole who didn’t survive to see parole, and by then we’d drifted apart enough that I only barely recognized him when I saw him. I still mourned for him a lot more than I did for Derek… But what happened happened. I accepted it for what it was.

&#x200B;

After they finally let me out, I started trying to get my life together. I checked in with my parole officer, got a room at a halfway house for guys like me, and started looking for work. I picked up a shitty job washing dishes and made enough money to get by. Honestly? That was good with me. This was what I wanted.

&#x200B;

The guilt never really went away. Most nights, I’d dream about Aiden… The screams he’d made… The sound of the woodchipper. The blood… The gore… God… Just the memory of it still turned my stomach. But I’d long since learned to live with all that.

&#x200B;

I’ve been out of prison for about 8 months now. I’ve been trying to get by… Trying to get my life in order and salvage what I’ve made of it. But now, I don’t think I can.

&#x200B;

I came home from work a couple of days ago at around midnight. I walked up the stairs to my room at the halfway house, changed into my pajamas, and tried to relax. My evening plans were to eat, jerk off, sleep and get up somewhat early the next morning to jog. Same as I did just about every day.

&#x200B;

I’d made myself a PB and J and been getting comfy on my single bed as I looked out my little window onto the street below. I watched some of the cars pass on the street and let myself zone out a little as I decompressed after a long shift.

&#x200B;

I didn’t pay much attention to it when I noticed movement on the street. I just sorta stared thoughtlessly into the void for a bit before realizing that there was something down on the road, crawling around.

&#x200B;

I figured it was just a dog at first since the first glimpse of it I noticed was it passing behind a car parked on the street. I watched it for only a few seconds before deciding it wasn’t anything worth paying attention to and going back to my sandwich.

&#x200B;

About a minute or so later, I saw whatever it was coming out from under the car, and looked down to satisfy my mild curiosity. Although the longer I looked at it… The less sure I was, as to what it was.

&#x200B;

It only had two legs… It couldn’t have been a dog or a cat. Some sort of bird maybe? No… Birds didn’t move like that.

&#x200B;

Whatever this thing was it crawled along on the ground and the shape of it looked… It almost looked like the top half of a person…

&#x200B;

I blinked in disbelief, trying to make sense of what I was seeing. There’s no way that could be true! No fucking way! But the longer I looked, the more sure I was…

&#x200B;

It was the top half of a person, dragging itself along the ground… A man by the looks of it… No… A teenage boy…

&#x200B;

I felt a sense of dread growing in my stomach as I realized that what I was looking at wasn’t just a trick of my eyes… Looking back, I’m not sure how I didn’t recognize him immediately… Maybe the sheer impossibility of it had made me dismiss it outright, but I couldn’t deny what was staring me right in the face.

&#x200B;

Aiden Pond was crawling towards my building… Well. Half of him was.

&#x200B;

I watched him move, my eyes widening in disbelief as my stomach tied itself in knots. I saw his face, pale and bloodless as he looked up at me, his eyes wide and sightless. I watched as he reached the wall beneath my window and began to climb.

&#x200B;

That was when I finally moved, stumbling back and tripping over my own two feet to land on my ass. I stared at the window like an idiot, half expecting this to all be some dream… It had to be! I’d probably just dozed off on my bed! Yeah, sure. That had to be it… Please dear God tell me that was it…

&#x200B;

I saw a pale hand with skeletal, clawlike fingers reaching up towards my window. I knew it was real.

&#x200B;

Aiden Pond rose up to press his face against the glass. His vacant eyes seemed to stare at me… His mouth hung open in a silent scream. God… I could… I could see bits of him hanging off the tattered remains of the bottom half of his torso. I watched him fumble with the edge of my window and realized that he aimed to open it.

&#x200B;

I stood up, sprinting to the window to try and stop him. I pressed the lock closed. It didn’t make any difference. Aiden forced it open.

&#x200B;

I heard the metal of the lock break. I saw cracks spiderweb across the glass. Aiden lurched forward, almost touching me as he fell into my room.

&#x200B;

He didn’t speak. Didn’t say a word… Didn’t even pause to reorient himself. He landed in a graceless heap on the ground and just kept moving… Reaching one pale, dead hand out to drag himself even closer. I tried to run. I stumbled back out of my room, looking back at him as I did.

&#x200B;

He just got closer and closer. Slowly but surely he dragged himself toward me. I took a few more steps back without thinking.

&#x200B;

I didn’t even realize how close I was to the stairs… Not until I was falling. I tumbled backward, my head slamming against one of the steps as I flopped over, crashing against every step as I fell.

&#x200B;

When I finally hit the ground… I lay there waiting. I could see Aiden at the top of the stairs, watching me with his cold dead eyes. I tried to move my legs. But the pain was too much. All I could do was scream.

&#x200B;

White bone jutted out of my broken skin. I wouldn’t be walking again anytime soon… So I tried to drag myself away. Using my arms to pull myself forward, I dragged myself away from the visage of Aiden that hunted me, tears streaming down my cheeks all the while. I didn’t move nearly as fast as he did… And though he didn’t make a sound, I knew he was getting closer…

&#x200B;

Down a nearby hallway, I could see lights come on. I could see doors opening as some of the other guys came out to investigate the noise. I vaguely remember screaming at them to run when one of them approached me to ask if I was okay. I tried to point to the ghost behind me… But when they looked, there was nothing there.

&#x200B;

Aiden was gone.

&#x200B;

I’ve spent the last few days in the hospital. The doctor says I’ll make a full recovery. I don’t believe that. I don’t think I’ll leave this building alive.

&#x200B;

He’s never there when anyone else is in the room but when I’m alone, I can see him… In the shadows, under beds, in the corners… Watching me. Waiting.

&#x200B;

I think about Jeremy and Derek a lot. I wonder if this was how their final days were… I wonder why he saved me for last. But I suppose it doesn’t really matter why.

&#x200B;

I’m scared of what will happen soon. I’m afraid to die… But I know that this is what I deserve… I did something terrible. I was just as much to blame as Derek and Jeremy were. [Aiden deserves his revenge.](https://www.reddit.com/r/HeadOfSpectre/)

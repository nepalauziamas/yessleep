I (18f) am in serious danger. 

Let's start with the basics. My mother is 39 and has been a drug addict my entire life(heroin). She leaches off of me and takes my money without permission. It got so bad to the point when she gave me her car because she has no income and couldn't get it registered or insured and owed me well over 10k. Her name is on the title. This is very important for later.

My entire life she has been very abusive twords me ever since I was 13, I've been in foster care and my dad was in jail. It just recently started getting worse within the past couple of years as soon as I started making money. I have 3 younger siblings but I take the blame for them any time I can because they are too young and I will protect them at all costs. She has physically beaten me over and over but whenever I would call the cops she would tell them that I'm su!cidal and they would send me to the hospital to be evaluated. 

My mother and siblings have been homeless for over 2 years. We live in a hotel room that my mother does not pay for but the hotel manager knows our situation. I go to college and im currently home on vacation. My mother likes to hold my car against me saying she will call the cops and report it stolen. I woke up this morning to her gone and so was my car. She brought some random guy back and everything in my car was moved around. 

She then told me I needed to drive the guy home and when she brought it back it was out of gas. So me, my sister(16f), the guy, and my mom got into my car and I drove to a gas station. She said I was driving like a maniac and that I needed to stop. I ignored her and got out to get gas and when I got out she climbed in the front seat and started screaming at me saying "fine you want to act like that well guess what I'm taking this car".

 I ran over to the driver side door and opened it and said she needed to give me my purse first(Which was on the passenger side floor where my sister was). She told me no then I reached over top of her to grab it. When doing so she grabbed my hair and pulled me down and started punching my head. I then used my forearm to restrain her so she would let go of my hair so I could get away. She broke my glasses in the process. I then stepped back and told my sister to hand me my purse. My sister then went to hand it to me and my mother shoved it back into her face. 

My sister then got out of the passenger side with my purse and walked twords me and I took a few steps back as my mother was screaming that I'm going to jail for assaulting her. I then started screaming at her calling her a drug addict and saying she needs help. She got out of the car and smacked me right across the face. I fell with a sharp pain in my ear and loss of vision. 

A worker from the gas station then came out and escorted me and my sister inside. My mother was chasing me crying and begging saying she didn't want to go back to jail and for me to please get in the car. I denied and she then got out like a bat out of hell in my car. The police then showed up with medical assistance and it turns out I now have a concussion and a ruptured ear drum.

 I pressed charges against her and so did my sister. I have an order of protection against her now and my grandparents picked me up and took me to their house. My aunt lives with my grandparents and is also a drug addict and is pissed that I'm going to get my mom arrested because that's how my aunt gets her drugs.

My aunt has told me that I'm being dramatic and it's not that serious and it happens all the time then we make up. And when I tell her I've made up my mind she tells me I'm a piece of shit and my mother should of aborted me. My grandparents keep telling me to ignore it. My aunt has been hiding and has been on the phone with my mom and I think they are plotting to kill me tonight while I sleep. 

You may be thinking "how would you even know" it is a gut wrenching feeling. My mother now hates me for pressing charges and my aunt has beat the living shit out of a puppy before for barking. I've watched my mother chase my step dad with a knife and attempting to stab him before and slit her wrists in front of my two youngest siblings before while screaming at them saying it was their fault. 

And when my mom is on drugs she is unpredictable. I have no car and no where else to go. I don't know what to do anymore and everytime I hear a noise my skin crawls, I'm paranoid, and cannot fall asleep. I need help. 
Someone please, I'm begging.


If I die it was my mother.

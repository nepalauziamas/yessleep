   Hello people of Reddit, I am Nomad (my codename), and I work for a private security company, called BlackHawk Security. Try looking it up, you won't find anything. There is no info about this company and no proof it even ever existed… at least, not the one I’m talking about.
    
   I’m currently the squad leader of a task force unit called Omega 6, One of the new members of the unit, a kid codenamed “Sparky”, suggested I tell Reddit my stories of my jobs back when I was just a security agent. Now here I am, about to tell my stories to a bunch of strangers on Reddit.

   My first job was as a booth officer at this moderately sized office building in Kentucky. Before this job I was debriefed on it. I was told that this job had a high risk to it, but that I would be paid handsomely, (10k, take that minimum wage) But for a cost.. 
 
 I got to the booth at 8:00pm, switching with the dayshift guard. I entered the booth and sat down at the small desk, at which sat a monitor, keyboard, mouse, a coffee mug under a coffee maker, and a notebook with a ripped piece of paper sat atop it. I looked over it.

To whoever is reading this, follow these steps to ensure your safety during your shift (9:00pm—6:00am) Never leave your booth during your shift, with the exception of step 5;

9:00pm–10:30pm, when cars pull up to the gate, stop them and ask for a company ID. If they give you a card with ANYTHING other than the company logo, tell them they need to leave as politely as you can, using a lie to do it. Angering them is a bad idea. If they give you a valid ID, then check their name in the database by using the monitor. If all is clear, use the monitor to open the gate.

10:30pm—12:00am, close the entry gates and exit gates, no cars should be coming in during these hours. If a car does come by during these hours, use the radio in the desk drawer to call security, tell them that you have a Code 10a. They will arrive soon to resolve the issue.

1:05am—3:00am cars will begin to leave and arrive again, follow rule 1 until 2:55am. At 2:55am, grab the weapon in the cabinet behind the chair (key in the desk drawer), you will need it. Then, go outside.

3:00am—4:00am, Keep an eye for any vehicles, DON'T LET ANYONE IN AT ALL COSTS!!  If you hear a woman’s voice coming from the forest, shoot it until there’s nothing but dust left, do not be fooled by its appearance, shoot it anyway even if it’s a child. IT IS NOT HUMAN!!!

4:00am—6:00am, follow rule 1 until the end of your shift. The dayshift guard will relieve you after your shift ends.
   
   After reading the note again, I look at my watch.. 8:57pm… I opened the small window to my side that faced the road that led to the building. I looked at my watch again, 9:00pm… the first few cars came by without trouble, I took their ID, looked them up in the database, and then let them in.
  
   At 10:17 however, a black sedan with a license plate with numbers I couldn’t even make out drove up, the driver looked at me with a grin that honestly made me want to throw up, I asked him for his ID and he gave it to me. Upon looking at it I noticed that the company logo, a lightning bolt striking a cracked lock, was replaced with a Trojan helmet with a large sword going through it. I looked back at the man and saw he was looking at me with wide eyes. “Does there seem to be a problem sssirr??” The man spoke in a slurred tone. “Not at all sir, just that the gate isn’t working and will need to be repaired later”. That seemed to have worked as the car left… 
   
   The rest of the time before the next step of my shift was uneventful. I looked at my watch and saw that it was 10:34, so I closed the exit gate and sat back as I waited for the next step to start. It was mostly uneventful until a white van pulled up with tinted windows that were so tinted that I couldn’t even see the light inside. I reached for my radio when the driver side window opened and I saw a heavily armored soldier with a patch on his arm that held the Omega symbol with a snake cutting through it. “Hello sir, we are not a code 10a, we are responding to a call” I look at him and continue to reach for my radio. “Call security, it will be pointless… we are getting in either way” ignoring him, I turn on my radio and speak into it. “Booth to security, I have a Code 10a, an armored individual and i'm guessing several more in the back of the van” “Copy that booth, a team is arriving to resolve the issue”. I waited a minute when another van, this time black and with the company logo on the sides, pulled up and 4 armored men got out. One of the guards looked at me and said “Close the shutters”, so I did. I heard talking, then shouting, then silence. Then the sound of a vehicle backing up followed by the sounds of the gate opening then closing seconds later. “Security to Booth, you may open the shutters, issue resolved”. I open the shutters and looked at my watch. 11:57, welp.. time for a break
   
   I would like to write more but I’ve got to get ready for my next mission. I will finish it up when I get back. Pray I don’t die!

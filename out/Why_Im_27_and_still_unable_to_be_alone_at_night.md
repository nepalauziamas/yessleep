I’d like to share some truth about my life that I don’t normally talk about. I’ve always been sensitive to energies around me, and the paranormal. My parents didn’t talk about that kinda stuff though. The closest my mom ever got to validating my experiences was to tell me that when I was too small to remember, I would talk to her about seeing relatives who’d died before I was born, and that I would frequently say catchphrases that the deceased relatives frequently used. She said it was weird because I’d never met them, and no one but them used those catchphrases. 

As I grew up it was common for me to see and hear things that no one else in my house did. Shadows moving, footsteps when everyone was asleep or I was alone in the house, and more. It even got so bad that I would wake up at night, unable to move, and the next morning have bruises forming. I didn’t tell anyone. Like I said, my parents didn’t talk about this kind of stuff. I just grew up in constant fear. Every night came new terror. Even in the daylight, my house felt uncomfortable. Something just felt off. Just felt wrong. 

One night I had a friend over for a sleepover. We did normal girl things, and at some point early in the morning, fell asleep. Well, she fell asleep. I laid awake, as per usual, watching the shadows move and listening to the sounds in the house. We had no pets in the house, and everyone was asleep but me. There was no reason for me to be hearing footsteps and muttering. 

Suddenly, a large shadow which was eerily humanoid appeared at the doorway in front of the foot of my bed. I couldn’t see eyes or any other facial features, but somehow I knew it was looking at me. It lingered for a while, just quietly watching. I’m a Christian, and when I’m afraid I talk to God. (No offense meant to anyone, nor will I be offended if you don’t agree with me…all love, y’all.) I just remember laying there, staring at this thing, praying out loud, not caring if I woke my friend up. 

The dark form at the doorway seemed to get mad, humorlessly laughing at me, and cocking it’s head to the side as if inspecting me.  I gave up praying and started singing some worship music that I knew I could focus on. I guess I thought that if I could ignore it, it would go away. I was wrong. 

While singing I could hear the being talking, its voice echoing through the room, loud. My friend was right beside me, snoozing peacefully, not hearing a thing. 

“You think you can get rid of me?” the being asked. “I will kill you. I will kill your family. You can’t stop me.”

Fear was racing though me, and something told me he knew it. I sang louder, fighting to focus on the words. “I’m going to kill you!” I heard him yell. “I’m going to destroy you!” 

Before I knew it was coming out of my mouth, I screamed, “LEAVE ME ALONE!”

As soon as the last word broke free from my lips, the being faded away, disappearing without another word. 

I felt the bed shake from my effort to scream. I  felt my friend’s breathy snores hitting my bare shoulder. She was still asleep. Hadn’t even budged. I knew I was awake. This was not a dream. It was real. 

I still to this day don’t understand why my friend didn’t hear anything. The next morning when it finally felt safe to move, I inspected the house. All the lights had been off that night, the only light coming in had been the faint moonlight coming from the windows. There was nothing between the windows and where the figure had been that could’ve caused the shadow. There was nothing that could’ve caused the voice. I felt sick from all the fear I’d felt all night. 

Night after night, I’ve waited for the being to return. It’s been about 10 years now, and I still hear and see things, especially at night. I’m now married and have my own home, but I’m still incapable of staying overnight alone anywhere. I can’t help but wonder why he listened when I screamed for him to leave. And why he chose that specific night to show himself. I don’t know where he went, but I don’t believe he’s gone.

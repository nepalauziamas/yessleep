Hey all.  I was searching around for others who may have experienced the same or similar to me.  My whole life I have seen odd things.  Things have escalated very recently and I am kinda freaked out.

I am not sure my eyes are my eyes any longer.  No one else seems to see these things, and when you read my post about the other night, that thing...... I'm not sure whose eyes these would be, but I'm not confident they are mine.

I saw this forum existed and I couldn't quite find what I was looking for, so I decided to share my story and let others come to me if they can help.

I have kept a journal for a long time so most of my experiences are written within hours/a day of the event so it should be accurate and fresh without the distortion time and memory can cause.

I did have a couple of childhood events that I will include as well, they were not chronicled at the time but I feel their memory is somewhat accurate and not just a childhood nightmare or a real even taken out of context over time.

I am listing everything in chronological order.  If you see any \*\*\*\* it means I have redacted something that would be personally identifying, or could be identifying with some snooping.  I want to remain private.

The most I will state about where I live is it is "Lovecraft Country" meaning it is an area that Lovecraft wrote about frequently.  So has Stephen King for that matter.  A lot of horror stories really to be honest, kinda weird.

Also, unless otherwise noted in the entry (see the road trip) everything has happened within 50 miles of each other as I have lived in this area only for my whole life, changing towns here and there but always within 25 miles of my birth town.

If you see () then I added something that was not originally in that entry for this post specifically.  Usually to add more information that may be needed for understanding.

Childhood experiences:

I remember one time helping my father clear some brush in the wood,  a lot of dead trees, and forest floor buildup, a concern in case of a wildfire.  While I was out one day I saw a cat on a branch, it was a big fluffy one, all gray.  The branch it was on literally could not be holding its weight, impossible to real-world physics.  It was too long and thin, it would crack or at least dip.  Beyond that, I remember the cat having glowing eyes.  Not like the normally reflective qualities of cats' eyes, more like 'coals from the furnaces of hell' type glow and brightness.  I did not stick around to see more.

A couple years later, in the same woods, I think I saw what one could call an elf.  Old European elf, that is, not LOTR style.  It ignored me and I walked away because I wanted nothing to do with it (A theme with me)

January \*\* \*\*\*\*

The concert tonight went well.  Mr. \*\*\*\*\* picked some good music that as a whole we were actually able to play.  Not sure why he picked January for it though, the weather was shit.

It wasn't bad when I drove in.  Met \*\*\*\*\*  and she let me know the weather was supposed to turn and her mom wanted her home right after the concert.  Sucks.

While waiting for everything to start got a new record in Snake.

Tim still can't read music so he was relegated to the bass drum, he actually did well, he's growing up.  Sam nailed the timpani and xylophone, she would probably be section leader and not me if she had the dexterity for the snare and could play set.  As it was the rest did alright, I messed up a couple of places but recovered well and I nailed the Anvil part of Song of The Blacksmith (Gustav Holst, Suite in F, movement 3).

The ride home is where it got weird.  I left the school and before I got to the top of \*\*\*\*\* hill it was completely a white out.  I never drove in something like this before so I went slow, but I got so confused because everything was the same.  I could only see a few feet in front of the car and no lights from the houses made it through.  

(General explanation of this next part as it would not be clear if I left it as-is.  My town was expansionist and had multiple 'developments' which are streets that are segmented out and developed by a single contractor to sell or lease to new homeowners.  Several of these developments linked streets that were otherwise not linked prior except by the main road.  I turned onto the wrong road because it was so bad I couldn't even tell it wasn't my street and had to do a couple of circles to find the development linking that street to my street as I couldn't even find my way back to the main road).

After I finally got onto \*\*\*\*\* street things got weird.  I saw a light, but I shouldn't have, the snow was so bad I couldn't even see my headlights, and yet I could see a light that was definitely off the street.  It wasn't a light though.  Snow didn't seem to touch this, I could see it reflected in the snow around it so it wasn't in my car or a reflection in my windshield or something.  

It was kind of like the Cheshire cat, a floating face of blue light.  It wasn't originally looking at me, but it moved its attention and when it saw me looking at it from my now stopped car it looked startled for a second then disappeared.  Just turned off like someone flipped a switch.

That's it.  I made it home a few minutes later and now I'm writing this.  

The face wasn't overly detailed, just a mouth and eyes, I saw it at an angle but it did turn slightly so it was more directly visible to me.  It was about 3 feet off the ground, I think.  I don't know if it had a body I just couldn't see.  \*\*\*\*\* also smoked some weed before the concert so I don't know if I got a secondary high or something and it was a hallucination, but given other past experiences, I doubt it.

October 24 \*\*\*\*

Road trip with James, as planned.

He promised a road trip to his hometown would be worth it, don't know why anyone would want to go to \*\*\*\*\* but whatever, I wasn't doing anything else and James is ok to hang out with.

Not sure about 'worth it' but there were a lot of memories made.

He doesn't have a car so I picked him up at the university and found out Darren and Geoff were going too.  Not a problem, I had room.

My first stop was at my parent's house, grabbed some food, and grabbed stuff from my old room for the weekend.  You'd think at this point I'd have everything I cared about or needed from there, but I seem to remember something else every week

After we left there we hit the interstate and started a drive that was longer than I expected, didn't realize it was going to be 3 hours to get there.  I hate \*\*\*\*\*. (state I live in)

In the car, I learned several new things.  Apparently, James is a psychic vampire and he likes to hang out with me because I always have an overabundance of 'good energy'.  He's good people but really weird.  I also learned Darren was planning to go into experimental medicine, I never knew what his major was but apparently, he was doing a dual degree in Engineering and premed.  I hope we remain friends (spoilers, we didn't) because I am probably going to die of cholesterol someday and he wants to make system flushing nanobots for a lot of common health issues.

We finally get down there for our weekend, James promised this is the best place to go for Halloween, I figure Salem must be but whatever (spoilers, neither is)

First thing we do there is stop at the HS football game, nothing spookier than a sport I don't care about.  We went to visit the band afterward which was awkward since the 3 of us didn't know anyone and they were just changing in the band room which was weird and icky.

After all this, we went to not Jame's house, but to the house of one of his family's friends to watch Van Helsing which was alright (and weird), glad I skipped it in the theaters though.  Their house was super decorated which was cool and they had some kick-ass apple cider.

Darren Geoff and I decided this was a weird visit.  More like James was homesick and kinda tricked us into going with him.

After we left that house he took us to the first truly spooky thing.  About half a mile from the high school, on a walking path in the woods, there was a weird shrine-like statue.  It had no inscription and was of a woman with a cloak.  It looked old but not ancient, like early 1900's, not 1700's.   James said this statue was important because it awakened his psychic vampire powers.  The statue itself was of normal height and proportion, just a woman with a cloak.  It was made of stone, there were no lights except the flashlight James brought, which I wish he told the rest of us to as well but whatever.

James asked us to sit cross-legged in front of it with the backs of our hands-on our knees and fingers up, thumb and middle connected like a circle.  I couldn't because of my old knee injury (when you are measuring throwing competitions for track, don't get hit by javelins is all I got to say on that).  The rest did, though, so I got to stand aside with the flashlight and make sure that nothing happened?  If a bear came out of the woods I was running, so I don't know what they wanted me to do.

Getting Geoff to sit still for 5 minutes is a miracle, but it happened.  I was thinking about that as I started to feel uneasy.  I looked around but couldn't find anything off so I just continued to stand.  After about 10 minutes I was super bored.  I wished my phone was back-lit so I could play snake.

The uneasiness got stronger and I finally noticed something off.  The statue, it looked different.  A slight twitch of the lips maybe? Maybe it just looked cleaner, with fewer cracks than before?  I couldn't tell, but it was not the same as when we got there.  I also felt more tired.

At this point, I gave up and tapped James' shoulder.  I think he fell asleep, he didn't get up easily and he seemed groggy.

After this, we went back to his parent's house and met his mother.

(redacting the rest of the story, imagine 2 more barely entertaining days in a small town during Halloween season, you get the gist).

November 12 \*\*\*\*

I've only been an RA (Resident Assistant) for a couple of months, but man I regret it.  I am the unluckiest, I have had to call ambulances and police more than any other RA this semester Pat let me know during our last meeting.

Last night I had to do rounds in \*\*\*\*\* Hall.  When the year started I was stoked to not have to live there, that place has been creepy forever.  It's built into a hill so the first and second stories are in the hill itself on one side of the building, and normal on the other.  I would never want to live in one of the dorms that are literally in the hill with no window.  I think that's a war crime.

\*\*\*\*\* also has the highest ' self-afflicted violence rate' as Tammy puts it in our skip meetings.  (Pat = Resident Director and Tammy = his boss).  It has something to do with the fact half the building doesn't get light, we think, so the RAs there have additional training about what to look out for regarding 'emotional health'.

Anyway, since sits in the same quad as \*\*\*\*\* (my dorm) apparently if all their RAs are unavailable they pull from other buildings.  Lucky me.

So I found myself in this creepy building, in an office I don't know, and doing rounds in halls I don't know, to check on kids I don't know.  Great night.

To be fair, it kind of was until my last round at 3am.  It had been quiet and I got my homework done and was just watching TV in the office.  Normally I would go back to my room, but since I was in a different building they told me to sit it out in the office all night.

It was my last round of the night.  I was on the second-story, hillside as I passed one of the bathrooms.  There was a blood puddle on the ground.  Shit, not again.  It was large too, at least a foot and a half across.  It also went under the door so my guess was it was seepage.

I knock on the door and warn them I am going to open the door, I have to do this as it's off-gender.  No response, so I opened it up.

More blood on the ground, it looked like it was a river coming from a stall.  I asked if anyone in there could hear me.  The last time I had this happened \*\*\*\*\* (a journal entry not being included with this post) 

I called the EMTs.

It only took a couple of minutes, \*\*\*\*\* is the closest hall to the on-site EMT volunteers, They literally just pull out of the building and drive 100 feet if that.

I was approached by the lead EMT, the same one the last 2 times I had to call them, he knows me by name now.  He asked where the issue was.  He was literally standing in the blood.  I pointed to the stall and let him know he was standing in the blood.  He looked confused.

He checked in the stall, but no one was there.   He let me know he couldn't see any blood.  I looked down again and now I couldn't see it either.

He checked me out while the rest went back, he told me he was going to speak to Pat and get me some time off.  He also suggested I speak to the on-campus counselor.  He was worried I had seen too many 'bad' things in too short of a period.

We'll see what today brings.

(This was originally written the morning after before I met with Pat or Tammy.  They were concerned for me and had me take a couple of weeks off, I also had to be cleared by the university counselor before I could return to work).

April 13 \*\*\*\*

Work sucked and I saw spooky shit again.  It's been 6 years so I was hoping that was done with.

Work always sucks though, I can't wait to get out of the restaurant, I don't care if they want me to be GM, I don't want to be GM.  Being the GM of a \*\*\*\*\* is not my life's ambition.  I hope university positions open up, no one is willing to retire and by the time they do, I won't be qualified any longer and need to recertify.  (professorship/teaching, if you don't have relevant field experience and aren't a recent graduate you are less likely to get a position).

Nothing new or unique I'd want to read back and reference in the future there so let's just get to the spooky stuff.  

\*\*\*\*\* had the car tonight so I had to bike to work.  Biking 3 miles downhill on the way back isn't as bad as uphill on the way there, so whatever.

The last mile and a half home, after the hill, is parallel to the river before you cross the bridge into \*\*\*\*\*.  I was on that path and looking at the river.  it's pretty well lit after the city improvements last year and I could see pretty far out, it's typically relaxing to watch on my way home.

Of course tonight there was a Kraken or something.  so not as relaxing.

The river is very wide and deep here, (Omitting some information here as it deals with historical events that would divulge the location of this town, but without too many details at one point in history ocean-faring boats could come up to this point of the river for trading purposes, it was their last port inland though).

Whatever it was crested the water.  The lights I just mentioned lighting things up pretty well didn't do much here.  Due to its angle, the head and tail were shadowed, so I could mainly only see the body of it.  It looked bluish-greenish-grayish although due to the lighting who knows.  I saw fins all over the body, haphazardly thrown in like surrealistic art.  There were tentacles too, like someone grafted a squid onto it.  

I'm glad I couldn't see the head, this was already nightmare fuel.

It dived back down quickly, and I decided to go off the trail onto the hot top instead, deciding I would rather risk cars than that thing.

July \*\* \*\*\*\*

I was driving home from class tonight and I saw it.  (personal growth, I was a night class instructor, not a student).

I went out to view the downed trees after yesterday's storm since I was still without power, like most of the state.

It was next to the speed limit sign by the church, gripped to a power line pole, so I knew it was about half a mile away.

A vaguely humanoid shape, dark and indistinct, with 3 more arms than anything on 2 legs should have.  The face was unclear except for amazingly white pupilless eyes, bright like bleached teeth.  Power coruscated up its arms, white and blue electricity feeding to where its face should be. 

Based on where I saw them in comparison to the sign it was next to and the distance, I think it was between 14 and 18 feet tall.

I noped and backed out.  I'm glad this shit only happens every few years now but I would rather it be done.  No one else sees these things.  Why me?

 6/6/2022

I was driving home late at night with my wife after visiting some friends.  I want to say around 11pm or so, but that's a little fuzzy, we weren't really checking the time.

I saw something in the road, I don't know what, I got the impression it was bipedal and large.  It was either black or so dark it would be indistinguishable at night.  By large I mean tall and thick, long legs, 2 long arms, and a chest that would put a mature oak to shame. I did not get the impression of any hair on it, it felt 'sharp' not fuzzy around the edges like you might get with something furry.  It didn't light up correctly in my headlights, almost like the light didn't want to touch it.

you would think that with the supernatural events I have seen from the road I would be more cautious, but I wasn't.  I probably shouldn't be too hard on myself, events like this are rare, and years apart, it's easy to get complacent... I swerved to miss the thing and hit a tree.

I checked back to see if it would involve itself in our accident further, but it was completely gone, not a trace.

We weren't going too fast, so all that happened was some body damage to the car, a shattered windshield due to some branches, and us being knocked around a bit.  There was something mechanical with the engine as well, the shop is going to look tomorrow but I couldn't get it to turn over again so we couldn't drive off.

Wife was ok but her phone was thrown free from the car, she had been using it when this all happened so she didn't see 'it' either, I ended up telling her it was a deer in the road.  She found her phone but the screen was shattered as it hit the same tree we did.  Mine didn't fair better in my pocket as I was slammed around in my seat, my airbag did not deploy and I was pretty lucky to just bang around a bit.  It did aggravate my knee to the point I couldn't walk though and with both our phones out of commission it meant she had to walk to the gas station, which was a quarter-mile away or so.  

I wasn't worried about the thing going after her, it disappeared and none of these other things I had seen before seemed interested in attacking people.

After she was gone I heard it though.  A voice called to me, I can't describe it, the sounds it made had never existed before it made them, and the words don't exist to describe them.  If you have read 'the colour out of Space' by HP Lovecraft you will know that sometimes you simply can't describe something.  Imagine a color that has never been seen before, and try to describe it, you won't be able to.  Try to explain non-euclidean geometry, or what the 5th dimension looks like to human eyes (not graphs), you won't be able to.  There are concepts your mind just can't process because it wasn't built for them.  These sounds, this VOICE, was among those.  

I will NEVER forget what it said.

THOSE.... EYES.... NOT.... YOU.... \*\*\*\*\*.... RECLAIM..... GLORIOUS..... AGONY.... followed by madness-inducing laughter that was tinged with a color never seen by humans before, and geometries so alien Lovecraft couldn't conceive them either.  Each word was said as if it were from a language never conceived and long dead, there were seconds and years between each word, the syllables echoing the rise and falls of civilizations, human and alien.  This short sentence took  30 seconds and 3000 years to say.  

I passed out at this point, my mind a gibbering mess refusing to even try further.  A broken thing looking to find a cave to hide in and lick its wounds.

I woke up in an ambulance.  It was at the scene, I could see a wrecker getting my car and my wife hovering with worry.  I didn't feel great, but my mind wasn't shutting down to protect itself from intrusion any further so I accepted that as a win and took a ride to the ER where they gave me the all-clear.

I decided, after this event, that it was time to tell my story.  Most poignantly, it was because for the first time in my life the story changed.  I'm too old for this shit and never, and I mean NEVER in all these years, has anything I have seen made noise.  Never a splash, a creak, a groan, a mumble, a whisper.  Nothing, a void of sound.

But now they have a voice.  

I am terrified.

I hope it's years, or never, before I see/hear something again.  I need to find a place to post this and get the message out.

I became a cook at a summer camp this year. The pay wasn't worth it.

&#x200B;

I have been struggling for some time now with depression. It got so lousy holding down a job became impossible. That, combined with a growing addiction to alcohol mixed with having to move back in with tea totaling parents, didnt help. I resolved many of these issues by moving away to a job where you live on sight, oil field, tug boats, circus freak! I didnt care as long as it got me away from Jesus and judgment and into a place that paid well.

&#x200B;

My first day at peaceful high was hard, and the night was terrifying. It took over 24 hours of sleepless travel to arrive at a camp with no wifi and patchy service. When I got there, I spent 3 hours helping with dinner. I was the only real cook on staff, so I knew it would be better to learn the ropes as soon as possible.

&#x200B;

After that, I fell asleep. There were eight beds in the cabin, and I had it to myself. I felt lucky to get the first pick of the beds and fell asleep in no time. When I first woke, it was to find the skylight was prominently filled with bright gestures of the outside world. That was no big deal, even though the day's brightness could hinder my objective of rem sleep. Soon I would learn that was the least of my problems.

&#x200B;

I awoke this time to darkness, a true black night only interrupted by the glimmering of a humanoid outline not far from my face!

This man, or what I assumed was a man, was leaning over my head and turned his left arm, reaching over me as if to grab something from the side of my bed or perhaps to remove my cover, exposing my belly and arms. I gazed befuddled. I didnt feel stuck as one might with sleep paralysis nor in danger, I assumed the man had come in and dropped something, and it had slid in a position he could not reach.

&#x200B;

This behavior was rude and intrusive, but it was the only option!

I lay still for some seconds until the yellowish outline shifted somehow without me noticing it was now pawing at the top bunk, ah=gain as if looking for something or perhaps making its pallet for the night. It stayed like this for some time until frustration took hold of me. im in no way a violent man, but I have never chosen passivity over standing up for my well-being! I lifted my right leg, bent it at the knee, and kicked leftward towards where the intruder's gut should have been!

&#x200B;

There was no reaction, no meeting of flesh, no pushback of my week kick, no gurgling of a man just struck nothing! And now I lay in darkness, and the yellow outline was gone?

&#x200B;

Like any rational adult, I disregarded the happening as a tired mind in a new bed in a new state, a new elevation, and new darkness!

The second and third time I woke up, there were no strange misunderstandings, just a body being too cold or a mouth to dry. 

&#x200B;

The fourth time I awoke was much different!

I woke to a pattering above me. Again, I opened my eyes and gazed about. There was no etheric being this time, only darkness. My eyes adjusted enough to where I could make out the springs in the bunk above me, but anything beyond that was out of the question.

&#x200B;

The springs shook slowly up and down as if someone was breathing very deeply and shifting their chest as they did so, then they began to move faster like someone doing situps. At this point, I moved slowly toward my phone. Upon contact with the device, the entire bed began to shake, convulsing inward and outward. The springs sank deep like a big fat man was above me doing jumping jacks while holding a dozen bowling bawls! 

&#x200B;

The wood panels began to crack and splinter. My confusion eventually evolved into action. I raised the fist, not holding the phone, and struck the springs screaming a pitiful "Stop"!

 I dont know why but It obeyed.

&#x200B;

Jolting out of my bed, I grumbled a fury of expletives as I fidgeted with my phone until the fash was on, I flung the light towards the mattress that had been attacking me only to find nothing.

My mother and I were the last customers in the Yam & Yum ice cream shop. As soon as we got everything ready, my mom paid, and we walked out. It was 10:04 PM, and we were the ones that closed the doors for the night.

As I walked along the sidewalk, happily enjoying my ice cream, I started to hear a faint whirring noise in the shop.

I looked behind me, but all I could see were the lights being turned off. I then heard echoes of a man screaming, but I couldn't tell if I was just hearing things or not.

**"Are you okay?"** My mom said anxiously.

**"Yeah, I'm fine... Just thought I was hearing things."** I replied, thinking my mom heard the same things.

**"Alright... Keep your focus in front of you though. You don't want to trip."** She said in a worried tone. I looked back in front of me and nodded, whilst starting to eat my ice cream again.

As I got home, which was a couple of blocks away from the shop, I walked into my room, thinking about what I had heard. I then decided to call my friend to talk for a while.

**"Hey there, Mark! Why are you calling so late, if I may ask?"** Justice exclaimed. Justice is just like me, in terms of humor, personality, and traits. I tend to stick with her everywhere we go, because I consider her as a protector.

**"Hi. I'm calling because I want to talk about something that I found strange. Do you know the ice cream shop we live next to?"**

**"Yea! I love that place. It's so delicious!"**

**"So, you must have heard the whirring noises, right?"**

**"No... What are you talking about?"**

I started to panic. There was no way in the world that I was imagining this. I didn't know how to explain this to her, and if I did, she might not believe me.

I took a breather and went back to talking.

**"When my mom and I left the shop, I started to hear a loud whirring noise. The lights were being turned off, so of course I had to suspect something. I also heard a random man screaming, so I for sure thought my mom heard it. She was literally right next to me, after all."**

**"Did you ask your mom if she heard it?"**

**"No, not really... She only said I was hearing things since I was looking back."**

**"You should go ask her."**

**"Didn't you hear what I just said? She said I was hearing things, so my guess would be that she wouldn't recall."**

**"Then, you really don't have much to do. All I can suggest is that the next time you go there, try to either get a back at the back, or ask one of the workers for a private tour."**

**"A private tour? You already know they don't allow customers back there."**

**"That's the point. They won't let you back there because of this so-called noise you're supposedly hearing. Force yourself in if you REALLY have to. Just make sure someone's always watching you as well."**

**"You sound like you know something..."**

**"Oh, believe me, I don't. I sound like I have a lot of experience in everything, when in reality, I have no idea what the other person is talking about. But, anyway, remember what I just told you. I have to get off for now, but I'll reply later, alright? See ya."**

She hung up on me right after she said that. I placed my phone on my dresser and sat on my bed, with a switched-on lamp next to me. I stared at the hardwood floor, wondering how I could play this all out. 

My ice cream had already melted, but by then, as I picked it up, I saw a hint of red that wasn't meant to be there. The flavor I choose was Chocolate Mint, and I hadn't put any strawberry drizzle on or in it. This had me puzzled and worried. **"It's not like I was gonna eat this anyway..."** I muttered to myself before I stood up, walking outside my bedroom, holding the cup.

As soon as I stepped out, my mom was standing right beside my doorway. I screamed so loud, but immediately covered my mouth.

**"Mom, what the hell are you doing there?! You almost gave me a heart attack, for God's sake!"**

She didn't bother replying. She shook her head for a slight second before lifting it up, her hair covering half of her face. 

**"Mom... are you alright?"**

Once again, she didn't answer. She then looked at me dead in the eyes and smiled for a short second before walking away and around the corner.

I didn't think twice about running back into my bedroom and locking the door shut. My father has been gone for a while now, and I wasn't sure when he was going to come home. I wanted to see him badly, because I was now scared for my life.

I picked up my phone again and tried to call another one of my friends.

They didn't answer.

Their voicemail played, but I quickly turned it off. I threw my phone on the bed and I quickly had a feeling my own mother was going to do something to me while I was sleeping.

Silence commenced for a minute before I heard a faint slam in the distance. Me, already assuming it's about the ice cream shop, ran to look outside my window, but not in a way that it's very noticeable.

I stared out for long enough to see two people, most likely men, carrying something in a large duffel bag. The two men had masks that covered their whole face, making them look like some sort of criminals.

I shut my blinds down and looked at my door again. A light was turned on, a light which my mom nor I had turned on. I saw a shadow. A shadow under the crack of my door. A loud, thudding noise came after that, and whoever was at my door had walked away. I heard the front door open, and I also heard something being carried in.

I have no idea what happened to that thing, because when the next day came, I opened my door to find a huge board with blood splatters.

I'm surprised I made it through the night. I didn't have to constantly be woken up by the grinding sounds of the shop. I was happy until I opened my bedroom door. My mom seemed to be gone at that moment, because she'd normally be in the kitchen cooking breakfast.

A note was left on the board. I scratched my head and picked it up. The note read, **"Your Father"**. I thought this was some kind of sick joke. If my father was here, then why is there instead a flat board with a sheet thrown off to the side?

I set the note down, but that was the time my mom unlocked the door, ran in, and locked it. She seemed perfectly normal until she turned to face me with a worried expression.

**"Hey dear... I'm sorry about what happened last night. I took the wrong medication before bed, and I'm sorry you had to be scared like that. I won't let it happen again..."**

**"It's okay mom, you're fine... However, that's not what I'm questioning. Why did you run in here like that?"**

My mom turned her worried face into a blank one.

**"Those grinding noises you were talking about. I heard them. I managed to get a glimpse of an employee shutting all of the lights off before going back into the kitchen area."**

**"I never talked about those noises to you... I only said I was hearing things."**

She looked confused, acting as if I never said that.

**"You must be joking... I know you talked to me about the noises you've been hearing, and now I'm talking about how I'm finally hearing them! They sound so weird, and it sounds as if they're grinding someone into pieces..."**

My eyes had never widened so fast. I do not think it's a coincidence because of my mother thinking the same things I am.

**"How about we go there right now? One of my friends had told me a method, and I wanna see if it works."**

**"Honey, you know we can't do that. I just saw the lights turn off."**

**"You won't know until we see it."**

She sighed, but she signaled me to follow her out the door. I was not excited at all about what we were going to do. We walked in silence, not making eye contact, and not even talking to each other.

We eventually reached the shop, and we were surprised to see that all of the lights had been turned on, the sign read "OPEN", and an employee was casually waiting at the register. We both thought something suspicious was going on.

We entered the shop, and the employee acted surprised. 

**"Oh, hello there! We weren't expecting much customers today."** He said politely.

**"Haha! I couldn't imagine..."** My mom scuffed.

**"So, what can I get for you today?"**

**"Oh, we would just like two small vanilla ice cream cups, please."**

**"It will be right out shortly! Your total comes out to four dollars and eighty-three cents."**

My mom gave the cashier the money and tried to get a glimpse back in the kitchen.

**"What are you looking at?"** The employee panics.

**"Oh, I forgot to tell you. We were both wondering if we could get a private tour around the place? I have only seen the lobby, and we would appreciate it if we saw everything,"** I said, interrupting the one-on-one conversation.

**"I'm sorry, I'm afraid we can't do that."**

**"It's funny, because I knew you would say that."**

**"What are you talking about?"**

I signaled my mom to wait by the exit door in case anything happens. She immediately followed my instructions and I started to prepare for the worst.

I jumped over the counter and I sprinted as fast as I could towards the kitchen and into the storage room. The cashier immediately ran after me and tried to apprehend me, but I knew someone had to figure out what was causing all of the grinding noises.

**"EVERYONE, GET THE BOY!!"** The cashier yelled.

I had never gotten so scared in my entire life. I tried to outrun the cashier, but he was just too fast.

**"PLEASE, LET ME GO!"** I yelled as soon as I fell onto the cold, concrete floor. I thrashed around as hard as I could before I saw more people hurdle towards me.

As the storage room door kept on opening and closing, I was horrified to see what was in there.

&#x200B;

A pile of dead bodies, who were scattered everywhere, with blood splattered along the walls. I could see some of their bodies being torn apart and being dropped to the floor, with internal organs spilling out.

Those things were the only traumatizing things I saw before the people that were near me picked me up and dragged me to an underground place

I was crying for the life of me, but I knew no one else could hear me.

I was thrown into a room that was supposed to be isolated from everyone else. I was crying for my mom, wondering if she called the police or not.

The room was like a prison cell, but with no way to see outside of it. I was banging on the walls, but all I got in return was silence. I quickly gave up and laid flat on the ground, starting at the light bulb.

I then immediately remembered the board that had the note and blood splatters that was still lying inside of my house.

&#x200B;

I cried even more when I came to the conclusion that my father had been incinerated. I hadn't noticed he was on the board this whole time. I thought I was going to die in that cell. I was panicking, screaming, doing everything in my power to make sure someone heard me.

But yet again, all I got in return was silence, and a man staring at me through the cell window.

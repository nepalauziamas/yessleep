[I said I had more to tell you.](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/lrul4m/how_to_survive_camping_bryans_dogs/)  This is it.  I must warn you again that I have some upsetting things to tell you about in regards to animals.  If it bothers you when animals are harmed for any reason, please be careful about reading further.

Everything came apart not long after I posted about the fairy being wounded.  It was late evening.  I was staying near my house as I didn’t want to be in the deep woods until I knew more about the fairy’s condition.  There was no indication that anything was wrong.  Not until I heard the baying of dogs.

I leapt from my desk and moved as quickly as I could, grabbing shotgun, knife, and jacket before bolting out the door.  I ran across the yard, struggling in the deep snow, in the direction of the noise.  Not far.  They weren’t in the deep woods, at least.  My breath steamed in the cold air.

The lead dancer waited at the edge of the woods.  Beau was with her.  I didn’t stop for them, just kept jogging towards the commotion and they followed.  Neither had to run.  Somehow, they kept pace with me merely by walking.  I hated them a little bit for it.

“The fomorian has been hunting the fairy since their last encounter,” the lead dancer told me.  “I’ve had the musicians tailing it.  It knew they were there, but it didn’t care anymore.  It’s been entirely focused on the fairy.”

“It’s even ignored me,” Beau added.

“Spring is coming,” I gasped, my lungs aching from the cold air.  “It’s running out of time.”

“The fairy is injured as well,” the dancer added.  “They can’t win this.”

“I know.  That’s why I’m going to help.”

The lead dancer’s expression was flat and cold.

“You’re going to die too,” she said.

“Like hell I will.”

She opened her mouth to say something else, but Beau’s hand snapped out and seized her wrist.  The pair stopped walking and I slowed only enough to look over my shoulder in surprise.  The two stared at each other, the dancer’s eyes wide with muted anger, locked with Beau’s own stern, narrow-eyed glare.

“Let her go,” he said. 

“What can a human possibly do against a fomorian?”

“I don’t know, but we’re going to find out.”

He turned to look at me.  He nodded slightly.   That was the closest I was going to get to encouragement from him.  I nodded back and kept going.  Neither of them followed me.  I was on my own from here out.

It felt… right.  Hasn’t it always been this way?  Just me up against the darkness?  I’ve had help, here and there, but at the end of the day I’ve faced my foe alone.  I killed the master of the vanishing house.  I abandoned the man with no shadow to wander forever in the body of the thing in the dark.  And I freed the lady in chains and then killed the lady with extra eyes.

But what *exactly* was I going to do against a fomorian?

I slowed to a halt as soon as I could see the battle through the trees.  The area had been cleared by the struggle, trees uprooted and thrown aside or blasted into splinters by the force of the blows that were exchanged.  It’d be hell to clean up later, I thought dourly.  At least I’d get a lot of firewood out of it.  *If* I lived long enough to use it.

In the middle knelt the fairy.  Red blood bloomed on the muddied snow around them like spring flowers.  One knee was against the ground, they rested one arm on the other.  In their hand was clenched their boar spear.  They were breathing heavily, their gaze fixed on the fomorian.

It paced back and forth, dragging its twisted leg through the snow, its limp even more pronounced.  It held no weapon, but its hands were curled into fists like clubs.  Its hood had fallen back to reveal thin, matted hair like rope.  Its face was humanoid in that it had eyes and a nose and a mouth… but the flesh ran like wax.  It formed whorls and valleys, layers of skin stacked upon each other like the edge of a book.  It wasn’t from some injury.  This was simply how it was.

One of its eyes was missing.  The flesh surrounding the empty eye socket was gone as well, leaving behind a gaping, wound that seeped black blood and watery bile.  Its other eye glowed with red light.  

Between the two combatants stood the dogs.  They formed a line, heads held proudly, and their coats were black even in the bright sunlight.  They were the only thing holding the fomorian back from finishing off the fairy.  Not that it would do any good, I realized.  The fairy didn’t seem capable of standing on their own power at the moment.  All the fomorian had to do was wait until they bled out, and it seemed intent on doing just that.

I glanced around.  Where was its deer?  Surely it could ride to safety.

It wasn’t far.  It stood locked in combat with the dapple-gray stallion just past the edge of the shattered trees.  The horse’s reins were gripped tight in the deer’s mouth, preventing it from circling around the deer and attacking from another angle.  Its head was lowered, putting its antlers between it and the horse.  And the horse was snapping at it, stretching its neck out, trying to get past the barrier of those sharpened points to sink its teeth into the soft flesh of the deer’s head.

Well here was something I could help with.  The horse hated me.  I could see the wound I left in its neck, thickly scabbed over and glistening with fresh blood in the cracks.

I stayed on the edge of the clearing, climbing over fallen trees to reach where the deer and the stallion battled.  The stallion saw me as I approached.  It lunged forwards, its attention no longer on the deer, and the deer turned and dug in its hooves, holding fast to the horse’s bridle.  The stallion stomped in anger, baring its teeth with a screech, and continued to struggle to escape the deer’s grasp.  It very obviously wanted to stomp me into a paste more than it wanted to rip the deer’s throat out.

I clambered up one of the trunks that had fallen at an angle, getting enough height to grab a sturdy tree branch.  I hauled myself up on it and then pulled myself up a few more for good measure.  The dapple-gray stallion watched with malice in its eyes, breath steaming heavily in the cold air.

“Okay, let go now!” I called down to the deer.  “Go help your master.  I’ll deal with the overgrown pony.”

It didn’t seem to like being called that. It lunged again and this time, the deer let go of the reins.  Now freed, the horse came directly after me.  Its hooves struck sparks as it ran and it jumped up on the tree trunk I’d used to boost myself into the upper branches.  The trunk snapped, long splinters erupting from the broken ends as the horse’s weight drove straight through the wood.  It whinnied in thwarted rage and then turned and reared, slamming both back hooves against the tree I’d taken refuge in.  It jerked violently and I clung desperately to the trunk, struggling to maintain my balance.  The horse readied itself for another blow.

But in the clearing, the deer was kneeling by the fairy’s side.  They wrapped an arm around its neck and pulled themselves onto its back.  The fomorian moved to stop it, but the dogs were quick to intercept, swarming around the fomorian and snapping at its good leg.  It batted at them and they darted away, only to reconverge as soon as it took another step towards the fairy.

The dogs gave the deer time to rise with its stricken rider.  It bounded away, slipping between the trees and carrying the fairy away from the fomorian’s grasp.

It screamed with rage at the realization that its prey was getting away.  It screeched something in a language I didn’t recognize, a phrase so vile that my stomach clenched with nausea that almost made me faint upon hearing it.  The horse snapped its head around and then the rest of its body followed, abandoning me to leap to its master’s call.  

No.  It couldn’t.  It couldn’t catch up to the wounded fairy.

I clutched my knife tight and began to descend.  The back leg.  I could slash the tendon.  Surely… *surely…*  I could do that much.

I dropped hastily from the tree, letting go of the branch before I should.  I hit the ground hard and might have hurt myself if it weren’t for the mounds of snow to catch me.  

The fomorian had hold of the horse’s bridle.  No.  It couldn’t catch up.  The fairy was my campground’s only hope.  I pulled my knife from its sheath.

Bryan’s dogs beat me there.

They swarmed the horse, biting at its legs.  It kicked at them in return and one of its hooves connected, throwing a dog violently towards the trees.  It lay there a moment, then sluggishly heaved itself to its feet.

My mouth was dry with fear.  No.  They couldn’t do this.  All this time they’d focused on staying between the fairy and the fomorian, because the latter knew it was too costly to engage.  But with the fairy wounded and victory within grasp, the fomorian was willing to make whatever sacrifices it had to.  Including the horse.

Another dog latched on to its hind leg.  It threw it off, but the damage was already done.  Bloody bone showed through the tattered remains of flesh.  The fomorian kicked at the horse’s sides and the beleaguered animal bolted, struggling to stay abreast of the pursuing hounds.  They nipped at its legs as it ran and I knew it was only a matter of time before they took it down.

How many dogs would be lost in the process?  And what happened when the fomorian joined the fray?  I wiped my face with the back of my hand, holding back tears.  What the hell was I going to tell Bryan?

I stumbled through the woods, back to where the dancer and Beau waited for me.  The dancer looked anxious and Beau was strained.  His grip was tight around his cup, his knuckles white with tension.

“We need to get back to the house,” Beau said tersely.  “Quickly.”

“What’s wrong?” I asked.

“Sun is about to set.  We don’t want to be in the forest after dark.”

I glanced at the sky.  We weren’t going to make it.  There was no way I could run that far and that fast.

“What happens after dark?” I asked, trudging through the snow to where they waited impatiently.

“Night belongs to evil things.  You know this,” the dancer chided.

The fomorian.  And it would surely employ every power it had in an attempt to kill the fairy.  If it could not, it might turn on us, to vent its frustration or perhaps to lure the fairy out with our cries for help.  Either way, it would not be a quick death.

I told them I couldn’t make it that far in time.  Frantically, I thought about alternatives.  Perhaps we could find the house that belonged to the lady with extra eyes.  The spiders seemed to be on our side, after all.  Perhaps they’d give us refuge.  I couldn’t think of anything else.

The dancer and Beau glanced at each other.  The dancer said something, I couldn’t make out her words, and Beau nodded curtly.

He swept out an arm and caught me in the midsection.  It knocked the air out of me and I froze on reflex as I was snatched up, my feet no longer touching solid ground, and then there was a bony shoulder digging into my stomach.

Beau had thrown me over his shoulder.  My arms dangled down his back and I grabbed hold of his hoodie as he began to run. 

He didn’t leave footprints, I realized.  Neither did the dancer.  They ran on top of the snow as if it weren’t there and freed from this constraint, they both could move a *lot* faster than I could.  And, if Beau’s even breathing was any indication, they didn’t get winded like a human would.

It helps to have inhuman friends sometimes.

I watched as the forest darkened behind us.  It didn’t feel right.  The forest grew dark early because of the canopy, but this was winter.  The branches were bare.  And the snow… seemed to be… moving.

I watched in horror as a rotted vine burst from beneath the snow.  It unfurled, rapidly growing in height, and vicious thorns sprouted from the blackened branch.  More vines joined it.  The thorns sprouted from everywhere, wrapping around the trees, choking the underbrush, and snatching at Beau’s ankles.  He hissed in pain but did not slow his stride.

“Has it always been able to do this?” I shouted at the dancer.

“It is expending *everything* it has to kill the fairy,” she replied.  “If we survive until dawn, it will be weakened enough that we might just be able to finish it off ourselves.”

We reached the field as the sun teetered on the edge of the horizon.  I stared into the woods, watching with despair as the thorns consumed my forest.  They grew close enough together that they could easily converge on anything they wished to hold fast, imprisoning the victim much as Bryan had been imprisoned.  My heart sank and I desperately hoped that the deer had at least gotten the fairy out of the woods in time.  As for everything else in there… well, it seemed they were all in for a bad night.

Beau set me down on the threshold of my house.  I hastily unlocked the door, my hands shaking.  I threw it open and hurriedly tumbled inside, inviting both Beau and the dancer to follow me.  They calmly stepped through the doorway and I slammed it shut and then locked it again, trembling with nervousness.

“Kate?” a voice called from inside the house.

Bryan.  He sounded frightened.

“What are you doing here?” I asked as he came into the entryway.

“I… had a bad feeling.  And then…” he gestured helplessly at the living room.  “So I let myself inside.”

Had I given him a key?  I must have given him a key.  The hazards of your office also being in your house and having employees that sometimes need to get into the records.

There were more important things to worry about, though.  I walked past him to see what was in the living room.

The fairy lay on my couch.

Bryan had spread out some towels underneath them to soak up the blood.  Their armor lay strewn on the floor and their clothing was pulled away from the ugly wound across their torso.  I could see a pink shine from where it crossed their stomach and realized how close they’d come to being disemboweled.  A first aid kit sat on the coffee table.

“You’re going to want the good kit,” I said grimly.  

I went to the closet and brought out the kit my parents had assembled and that I’d kept stocked over the years.  I shoved this at Bryan.

“Do you know how to sew stitches?” I asked.  

He shook his head, so I went to the office and came back with my laptop.  I set it up on the coffee table so that he could reference it while kneeling next to the wounded fairy.

“You can find anything on youtube,” I told him.  “Figure it out.  Where’s the deer?”

“Hopefully leading the fomorian astray.  I don’t know how long that’ll last though.”

Not long, I thought.  The forest was inaccessible and the field would give the fomorian a clear line of sight on it.  Once it realized the fairy was no longer riding the deer, it would come here.

“Then I’m going to go figure out how we can survive this,” I muttered.

I checked the front window to see if the thorns were getting any closer.  They’d stopped at the border of the forest, to my great relief.  There *was* something coming up out of the woods, but there were two of them and they were too small to be the fomorian.  Their eyes glowed in the descending darkness.

Bryan’s dogs.  Only two of them.

I felt sick to my stomach.  Where were the rest?  Bryan had six dogs.  I watched as they wearily made their way up the field towards the house.  My intention was to open the door once they were on the patio, but the dogs did not come that far.  They stopped at the gate.  Stopped, turned, and sat down, staring off into the night.

Guarding the house.

There was no point trying to coerce them to come inside.  The dogs had a duty to perform.  Protect their master and protect the fairy.  I reluctantly stepped away from the front door and returned to the interior of the house.  There wasn’t a lot of lumber in the garage, but I enlisted Beau to help board up the windows as best as we could.  The fomorian seemed to enjoy breaking in through them, it might help.  The dancer… I left her to her own devices.  Maybe she’d figure out how to be useful on her own.

The fomorian arrived at the house around midnight.  By then I’d reinforced the windows and barricaded the doors with furniture and there wasn’t much else I could think of.  I’d tried reasoning with the little girl for help but she only huddled by the kitchen window, weeping quietly.  My shotgun was loaded and I kept it close at hand while I brewed coffee.  It was going to be a long night, after all.  I’d asked the dancer about her companions, but she wasn’t worried for their well-being.  They weren’t the targets of the fomorian’s rage.  If they stayed out of the way the thorns would leave them alone.  The fomorians were tyrants, after all, and it would want someone to rule over once the fairy was dead.

She didn’t seem pleased at the prospect.

We were alerted to the fomorian’s approach by a single bark from the dogs.  Bryan’s head snapped up and he swiveled to stare at the front of the house.  I hurried over, catching up my shotgun.  Bryan had not left the fairy’s side, even after he’d finished stitching up the fairy’s wounds.  They were still unconscious, but stirred faintly at the dog’s bark.  Bryan covered their hand with his own.

Silence inside the house.  We listened uneasily to the low growls of the dogs outside.  Then a voice boomed through the night, rattling the windows, and I sucked in a breath in surprise.

“Camp manager,” the fomorian rumbled.  “Give me the fairy and I shall spare your companions.”

“And what will you do with me and the fairy?” I called back.

“Quick deaths.  You will understand the generosity of such an offer, should you refuse and I take the fairy from you by force.”

Surprisingly, it was Bryan that answered.  Quiet, shy Bryan, suddenly yelling back at the monstrosity with an anger I’d never heard from him.  He told the fomorian to go to hell.  That we’d fight to our last to keep the fairy from him.

“Very well,” the fomorian rumbled.  “I’ll kill you last.”

And the battle began.  The dogs engaged immediately.  I ran to the window to look, peering between the boards.  The fomorian was moving slowly.  The dogs had targeted his good leg, it seemed, and he could no longer move quickly.  The dogs ran circles around him, snapping at his calves and forcing him to fend them off instead of approaching the house any further.  Then he swung at one, it connected, and the dog was sent flying through my fence.  It stood, shaking itself off, stumbled, and then raced to rejoin the fray.

I took a deep breath and started to shove furniture out from in front of the door.  I had to help them.

The lead dancer seized my arm.  I tugged, but her grip was unyielding.  Like her hand was made of stone.  She stared directly into my eyes.

“You’ll die,” she said.

“What happened to ‘go be you at the problem’?” I snapped.

“Do you have any tricks to play?  Or do you just intend to go out there and hope for the best?”

I was silent.  I was out of ideas.  I just… the dogs had come to my rescue so many times.  How could I abandon them now?

“Wait until dawn,” the dancer urged.  “The night belongs to evil things.  The day belongs to you.”

She pried the shotgun out of my hand.  Then, still holding onto my arm, she forcibly dragged me away from the window.  I couldn’t look at Bryan.  He remained by the fairy’s side, but I could not imagine the suffering he felt, listening to his dogs snap and snarl outside.  

I sat down heavily at the kitchen table. Beau was still there with his mug of coffee and his skull cup.  The dancer also seated herself, conspicuously sitting between me and the front door.

“They can’t keep this up all night,” I whispered desperately, keeping my voice down so Bryan wouldn’t overhear.  “It’s, what, seven hours until dawn still?

The dancer and Beau exchanged reluctant glances.  

“The dogs can keep harrying him, but he’s going to keep getting closer to the house.  They can’t drag him back without taking a hit and I don’t think they’re strong enough to survive many of those.  Then what?”

Silence.  The dancer stared grimly at the kitchen table.  Beau just kept drinking his coffee.  Neither seemed willing to speak.  They knew I was right.

“I’ll go,” Beau sighed.  “I still have the stone.  It carries the thorn’s death, but perhaps it will also do some harm to the fomorian.”

“It’ll tear you apart,” the dancer said calmly.  “If you’re lucky, that is.”

Beau gave a soft nod.  Slowly, it dawned on me what was happening.  Beau was going out there to die.  To reinforce the dogs in an attempt to keep the fomorian away from the house until dawn, and if that failed, to buy us time as the fomorian delighted in killing him slowly.  I stood, almost knocking my chair over in my haste.

“No,” I said.  “No, we have to find another way.  I can call the old sheriff.”

“If his wife could help us she’d have been here by now.”

“Then something on the campground-”

“There’s nothing left to oppose it,” the dancer snapped.  “Everything on this campground is too young.  It’s going to kill us all.”

Her words rang out loud and clear and a hush fell over the room.  She’d said what we were all thinking: even if Beau went to help the dogs, it might not be enough.  No, it *wasn’t* enough.  I glanced into the living room where Bryan knelt beside the fairy, refusing to lift his head.  He grieved in silence while his dogs gave the last of their lives to buy us perhaps enough time to survive until dawn.

“We need an ancient thing,” I said desperately.

This is what we were down to.  The only resources we had left to use were our lives.  The dogs.  Beau’s.  

Or mine.

I clenched my hands into fists, my nails biting into my palms.  I tried not to think.  Like jumping off a cliff, I thought.  Just have to be brave for a moment and then gravity will do the rest.

“Beau,” I said.  I felt like I was already falling, my body light as a feather.  “Blood freely given.  Take it.  All of it.”

Beau was utterly still.  He closed his eyes and his expression softened.  

“I’m sorry, Kate,” he whispered.  “Thank you… but I can’t.”

And a sickening drop in my stomach.  My knees trembled and I put a hand on the table to brace myself, shocked by the sudden weakness that flooded through my body.  I felt disoriented and there were tears in my eyes and I wasn’t sure why I was suddenly crying.

“But-” I protested weakly.

“There’s qualifications that have to be fulfilled,” the dancer said with unusual gravity.  “Neither of us meet them.”

Beau’s eyes were still closed.  His hand covered the mouth of his skull cup as it sat on the table.  His rings glinted dully from the overhead light.

“But… you have a name,” I said plaintively.

“It’s not been enough time.  Too many people still think of me as how they always have.”

You all have tried and you’ve done wonderfully.  You have.  But there’s still my campers to think of.  They’ve only known him as the person with the skull cup.  I haven’t printed the new pamphlets yet, the ones that refer to him by name.  Perhaps if it were a year from now, after countless people have come and gone and learned to think of him as Beau, the situation would be different.  But it wasn’t.  And I was out of options.

I sank back into my chair and buried my face in my hands.

“So this is it,” I said hollowly.  “The fomorian wins.”

No one could answer me.

I clenched my hands into fists.  No.  This wasn’t right.  This wasn’t how my family did things.  We didn’t just give up.  We went out fighting.  I thought of my great-aunt, stabbing the harvester in the face with its own scalpel, fighting them to the last even as they held her down and cut her open.  I exhaled slowly, feeling that old, old anger suffusing my veins like the heat from a fire.  The fomorian was here to kill us all, but I would make it damn hard for him.  I’d fight to the last and throw my defiance in its face even as I died.

I trembled from the intensity of my hatred.  Like the world around me would shatter.

“What are you doing?” the little girl whispered through the window.  “Stop.  Kate, STOP!”

A distant roar reverberated through the air.  My blood ran cold at the sound.  I stared straight ahead, not really seeing anything.  Like everything in me had shut down at the noise and I was simply drifting.

It was the roar of the beast.

The beast was coming.

Beau and the dancer both leapt to their feet.  The dancer ran to the front window to look outside.  Beau slammed his hands down on the table.

“What did you DO?” he demanded with uncharacteristic anger.

“I… I don’t know,” I replied weakly.

I didn’t.  The beast was here, hours and hours from dawn.  But... wasn’t this a good thing?  Surely the beast had a grudge against the fomorian.  It wasn’t stronger than the fomorian, but perhaps it could keep it occupied, at least until dawn.

The ground shook as the beast grew closer.  The fomorian shouted something, a curse in its own language I think.  And then the windows rattled once more as the two clashed.  I ran to the window and peered out into the darkness.  I could barely make out the details, the fomorian obscured by its cloak and the beast’s body, as if cut from the night itself.  I only saw their glowing eyes, the beast glittering like stars and the fomorian like a dying sun.  The hounds blazed with light, leaving trails as they moved, snapping at the fomorian’s heels, a luminescent dance in the darkness like fireflies.

I turned from the window.  We had a chance now.  My heart beat rapidly with adrenaline as the battle continued.

Hours passed.  In the stories they talk of how these inhuman creatures will fight until the dawn, all through the night, but it says nothing of the toll it takes on those waiting for a victor.  Of the gut-wrenching anxiety and the oppressive fear, the whispering in the back of your mind as you think of what will happen if your side loses, of the death that waits close at hand, waiting for a fatal misstep.  But slowly, the sounds of the battle diminished and the points of light that marked its passage receded.  The beast was dragging the fomorian away from the house, step by step.  And then at dawn, as the light broke over the trees, the battle was done.  Silence descended, only if for a moment.  The little girl cried out in terror as the beast wearily claimed its due tribute and slunk away before the burgeoning day.

I told everyone gathered in my house to stay where they were.  The dancer’s words from the previous evening were foremost in my mind.  The fomorian was weakened.  It’d battled both the dogs and the beast all through the night.  I just might be able to finish it off and put an end to all of this.  

I took only my knife.  I felt by instinct that mortal weapons wouldn’t do much good here.  I stepped out onto the porch and closed the door behind me.  The front yard was a mess of torn earth and muddied snow.  Blood lay splattered about in frozen droplets.  The fence was flattened.

And Bryan’s dogs...

There is a story in Irish legends about how the Irish hero Cuchualain got his name.  He was arriving late one evening to the dun of the smith Cullan and the gates were sealed and Cullan’s dog was at watch.  This was a massive hound, fierce and proud, and protective of its master.  Upon seeing Cuchualain, it mistook him for an intruder, and set upon him.  Cuchualain had no choice but to kill it to save his life and he, wrought with sorrow, brought its body to Cullan who was deeply grieved to see his faithful hound dead.

Cuchualain declared that *he* would become Cullan’s hound, to amend for what he’d done.  And so he was named Cuchualain , the “hound of Cullan .”

The loyalty of dogs is also their tragedy.  When they die, the strength of that bond takes a piece of us with them.

I found the dogs sitting at either side of the door.  Their eyes were open, staring out at the field beyond.  Neither were breathing.  Their muscles were locked tight, their joints immobile.  Still guarding the house in death, as they had throughout the long night.

My chest felt tight.  I fought back sobs and reached out to touch one.  Its body was as cold as ice.  And when I touched it, it fell apart, breaking like glass.  The pieces drifted in the quiet morning air, floating gently like snowflakes, and they changed from black to a myriad of colors.  Blue.  Yellow.  Purple and red.  Both the dogs were disintegrating now, vanishing before my eyes into a storm of color, fluttering gently in the air.

Flower petals.  Their bodies drifted away on the cold morning breeze as flower petals.

I followed them as they moved across the field that separated the house from the forest.  They floated along the path of the battle, strewn with pawprints and the heavy footprints of the fomorian.  I found it at the edge of the forest, kneeling in the snow.  Its breathing was ragged and it stared at me with its one good eye as I approached.

“Come to kill me, then?” it snarled.

“I did.”

“With that puny knife?” It spat into the snow.  “I’ll break you in two as soon as you come close.”

I hesitated.  There was still time to go back and get the shotgun, I supposed.  Judging by the twist to the fomorian’s good leg, it wasn’t going anywhere.

Bryan’s voice startled me.  He’d come up behind me so quietly that I hadn’t noticed.  He called my name and I stepped aside when I saw what he had with him.

He carried the fairy’s boar spear.

I stood by, silent as the fomorian cursed at him in his own foul language.  Bryan did not flinch.  He’d come to do what had to be done to protect the ones he loved, just as he had long ago as a child.

He raised the spear, braced himself, and then drove it through the fomorian’s chest.  He ripped it free and the fomorian coughed black blood, the light in its eye faded and its skin shifted in hue, as if it were drained of color.  The blood stopped flowing.  Stone.  It had turned to stone.  I cursed under my breath.  This was going to be a hassle to remove, because I certainly wasn’t leaving something so morbid in full view of my campers.

Bryan stifled a sob and then he threw the spear away from him, as if he found the touch loathsome.  He quickly turned and walked away, but he wasn’t going to the house.  He was heading for the parking lot and to his car.

“Where are you going?” I called after him.

“Home!” he replied, his voice tight with grief.  “I’m going home.”

Bryan never wanted to kill anything.  This wasn’t the life he wanted.

It wasn’t long after the fomorian’s death that the old sheriff arrived to drop off his wife.  She’d tend to the fairy from here.  Beau and the dancer could return to the forest.  They both seemed relieved to go.  I suppose spending the night in a human house wouldn’t be the most pleasant experience for them, even without the threat of a horrible death lurking just outside.  I hovered about the living room, uncertain how I could help.  The old sheriff’s wife finally looked up and fixed me with a steely gaze.

“I can take care of my own,” she said firmly.  “You have something left to do.”

Startled, I realized what she was referring to.  Yes.  I did.  I quickly put on my jacket as she chided me to dress warmly and hurried out the door.  I took the fairy’s spear with me.

It took a bit of searching, as there wasn’t an obvious trail to follow, but sometime around noon I found what I was looking for.  

The dapple-gray stallion lay in the snow on its side, its legs torn to pieces by the dog’s jaws.  The bodies of the hounds were not present, but the handful of flower petals resting on top of the snow told me everything I needed to know.  They were gone.  All of them.  I fought back tears as I approached the stricken horse.  It weakly raised its head as I drew near, snapping at me in desperation and hate.

I could only feel regret as I stood over it.  

“Poor thing,” I said to the dying horse.  “You were doomed by the part you had to play, weren’t you?  Maybe you would have lived a normal life as a normal horse if you hadn’t been brought to our land.”

I raised the spear and brought it down over the horse’s chest.  The blade easily pierced the thick hide and muscle, down through the ribs, and into its heart.  The dapple gray stallion shuddered once and then it was done.

The fairy lay convalescing in my house for days.  The old sheriff’s wife checked in on them periodically.  Bryan did not come to visit and when I called his cell phone, he didn’t answer.  I finally went to his house to see if he was okay.

His mother told me that Bryan was gone. He'd taken with him his great grandma's coat, the one made out of seal skin.

We don't think he's ever coming back.

I went to the old church.  I found where Bryan buried the puppies, all those years ago.  There are flowers blooming on their graves, wildflowers, forcing their way up through the snow.  Brilliant flowers of blue and purple and yellow, the kind we only see in the summer.

I guess their long watch is over.  The dogs have protected that which they were summoned to this earth to guard and now they’ve passed on to wherever we go after death.

And the day after yesterday, the fairy left.

I woke to find the sofa empty.  Hastily, I threw on some shoes and a jacket and hurried out into the yard.  The fairy stood in the field, stroking their deer’s neck.  I was intensely relieved to see that the deer had survived.  I guess it’d stayed out of the way after the fomorian dropped its pursuit.  The two turned to look at me as I approached.

“What now?” I asked the fairy.  “Are you going to stay?”

It was hard to see them in the morning sunlight.  I tried to shield my eyes with one hand, squinting against the glare from the snow.

“No, my task here is done,” they replied.  “I came to your land long ago because I was following my foe.  We just… lost track of our purpose for a while.”

Their gaze drifted to stare at the horizon.  This had never been their home.  Just a place to stay for a brief time in their immortal life.

“I’m going to return home,” they continued.  “I’ll try to find Bryan.  Perhaps Manannan will be willing to help.  I don’t know if Bryan will be able to forgive me… but I’d like to try.”

They looked tired.  Their long war was over, but victory was a brief, fleeting moment and now that it was done we were left with the aftermath.  The healing and the grieving and the blame.

“You’re always welcome here,” I said.

“I will remember that.  Thank you, campground manager.  And good luck.”

Wearily, they pulled themself up onto their deer’s back.  I offered them the boar spear.  They regarded it for a moment, and then turned away without taking it.

“Keep it,” they said.  “You’ll need it more than I will.”

And they left.  My campground feels empty now.

That night, I went walking through my land.  I went down into the old woods.  I wasn’t grieving our losses.  I wasn’t happy about our victory.  I just felt… numb.  Eventually, I found myself walking past a brightly lit clearing with people dancing around the light of a roaring bonfire.  The former sheriff leaned against a keg and he waved half-heartedly at me before turning his gaze back to the fire.  And near the road sat the lead dancer, resting on a log with her legs stretched out before her.

“Seems a bit inappropriate to be having a party right now,” I commented, sitting down beside her.

“People come and go,” she replied dismissively.  “Were we to mourn every life we come in contact with we would never stop grieving.”

This is different, I thought.  This wasn’t just some camper that passed through for the night.  But for all her human mannerisms, the dancer is something else, and the weight of a life feels different for her, and the bonds of friendship may not even exist for her kind.

“There’s something that’s been bothering me,” I said.  “You said there’s qualifications that have to be met for becoming an ancient thing.  If some of the residents here can’t ascend, then why are they trying to kill me?”

“It isn’t a conscious decision for some of them,” she sighed.  “We *all* want control.  But most of us, if we take the land, will lack the necessary backing to make it *stick*.  It’s not enough to just kill you.  We have to take authority over the land as well.  And authority isn’t granted: it’s earned.  Humans try to ignore that distinction.”

“You said *most* of them can’t ascend.  So what *can*?”

She was silent for a long moment, listening to the musicians, staring into the fire.  I didn’t press her.  She’d answer when she felt like it, if she answered at all.

“Of everything on this land, there’s only three entities that have both the desire and the ability to wrest control from your family,” she finally said.  “You already dealt with two.”

I thought about it.  The fomorian was here to kill the fairy and continue a very old war.  It wasn’t one of the two.  The lady with extra eyes had wanted to kill me so she could ascend, so she was one.  Then the second… the man with no shadow.

But what made them different?  Why could they become ancient but Beau couldn’t?

I remembered, as if whispered in my ear, the words of the master of the vanishing house.  The things it asked for so that it could *last*.  Worship.  Love.  And fear.

The man with no shadow was amassing followers so that they would worship him, unwillingly, but it was worship nonetheless.  Between that and my death, he would hold sway over this land.

The lady with extra eyes had our love.  That of my family and that of my campers.

I think I understand what the third contender is.  The man with no shadow demanded worship.  The lady with extra eyes already had our love.  The third key, the third thing that will make something *last*…

Is fear.

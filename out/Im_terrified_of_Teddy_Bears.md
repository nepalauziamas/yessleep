I know this sounds incredibly stupid. Who in their right mind would be scared of Teddy Bears right? Well that person is me and I can assure you. I'm in my right mind.

Have you ever heard of the game "Hide and Seek alone"? If not. Now you have. If you have heard of it, I'm sorry if I'm bringing any bad memories. I'm also remembering them... So I assume you had a similar experience. Again, to those that never heard of it. Please, never try to play this game I beg of you and if I can't stop you... KEEP THE RULES IN MIND. 

These events date from 10 years ago... I tried so as to forget them but I think I'll forever be unable to. At the time I was an impressionable kid and I learned of the existence of that game. Of course being a huge fan of Creepypastas and urban legends, also being very skeptical. I decided to give it a try. I waited until my parents were out for the night... Looked for an appropriate doll, although I didn't have what they wanted. Only a old teddy bear that I got when I was 2. So I used it, I completed every step of the manual very carefully. I first found a hiding spot, my closet? That was a no go. It was very easy to see through... So my parents bedroom! I could hide in their closet which was much bigger. Then I proceeded to stay up until late in the night... They told me they would be out that night so it was fine. I closed every light, every door, every window. Everything was also tightly locked as tight as a kid my age could manage. I prepared the teddy bear and the basin required. I said the ritual like it was saying... My teddy bear looked deformed compared to his original look, I sewed him back up with a red thread. He looked weird... Evil even, I didn't know how to explain the dread I had at that moment... I dropped the bear in the water.

I said my part, after choosing the name "Carter" I don't remember why, I just did. Then went to "seek" the teddy. I stabbed him with the box cutter I had... The dread got worse, I was sweating all over... I don't know what was happening it just felt wrong. I hurried to my hiding place while being as silent as possible. I hid in the closet and I started hearing small laughter... I was scared the doll, it was actually real. The teddy bear was actually possessed. I heard it walking around, running, it was looking for me. I held the saltwater close... My eyes were closing, I could feel I was getting tired... It was getting heavy but the fear gradually woke me up. I heard it get closer once, twice, thrice, four times, five times.... Seventeen times. But it never found me. I don't know how much time passed but I know it was too long. After I gathered my courage I got up and finally ended the game. It honestly seemed like I was exorcising the teddy bear.. even it probably was. I heard the screams of pain coming from that thing. So I thought it was the end. I picked up my teddy and put him in his original place. On a shelf looking high above at me. It may have looked odd and weirder than before but I didn't feel the dread I felt from before... I was stupid.

I fell asleep, I know I shouldn't have. I SHOULD HAVE BURNED THE DAMN THING. In my sleep, I never noticed the weird teddy. I should have heard the noise, I SHOULDN'T HAVE FALLEN ASLEEP. I don't know where it was I don't know what it was doing. All I remember is the moment I woke up. I screamed, even now that moment makes me shudder. My eyes opened there was a box cutter in front of my eyes. My scream filled the room as I, by instinct, smacked whatever was in front of me. I heard a splat against the wall and as I looked down I saw that thing. Was it a teddy bear at this point? I don't think so... All I could feel from it was anger and disgust. I was terrified, I felt stiff, my eyes couldn't move away from it. I don't remember how I ever found the strength to get up... I remember being stuck in that moment for hours, which could have been a mere minute. The next moment I picked it up, it started squirming. I was shaking, I could have collapsed but I didn't. I made my way to the microwave and threw it in. I don't know why I thought the microwave was the way to go at the time but I'll never forget what happened after.

I turned it on. Pressed 3 and multiple 0s and finally the start button. I saw the teddy writhe in pain as it slowly very slowly heated up. At some point it caught fire, I saw it melt slowly... My eyes were stuck on it, I didn't move, I couldn't move. I was mesmerized by a disgusting vision. Faux fur, button eyes, screams of pain, curses as the thing slowly melted to death. The microwave caught fire after that but... I couldn't move anymore. I don't remember what happened next all I know is that a few days after we were moving into an apartment in the city where my parents worked.

This story may seem out of nowhere... But my therapist said it would be good to share such, I've been seeing him for months now but I never thought of this seriously. That was until I crossed the local toy store. I know it was one singular teddy bear but they all reminded me of that night. I needed a way out.... I'm sorry.... I just needed a way out from those memories I so dread....

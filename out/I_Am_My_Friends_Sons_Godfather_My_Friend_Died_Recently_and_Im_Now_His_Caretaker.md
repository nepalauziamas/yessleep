It was around three a.m when the rapid knocking descended upon my front door. 

I flip-flopped around in my bed and shoved a pillow over my face to block out the noise. I was annoyed since I had to get up in a few hours for a meeting and had gone to bed late making finishing touches on the blueprints for said meeting. When the doorbell started ringing I lost it.

I was ready to tear whoever the hell was at my door at three in the morning to shreds, formulating the verbal assault I would unleash on them as I stomped towards the mahogany oak of my front door. When I opened it however, the words got stuck in my throat as I took in the sight before me.

There was a woman standing on my doorstep, wearing a black pantsuit, blonde hair slicked back into a bun- though there were a few crazy looking strays sticking out, with grey tired and dead looking eyes. Standing right besides her hip was a pale bruised up little boy looking up at me with his familiar blue eyes. I hadn’t seen him since he was an infant, but I could recognize those crystal blue eyes and silky black hair anywhere. He looked just like his mother. My heart sank into my stomach as there was only one reason why he’d be brought here.

Social services didn’t call to notify me or nothing. Didn’t give me time to prepare or even mourn, just dropped Matthew at my feet in the middle of the night, dusted their  hands off, and left. 

Sorry I’m tired and a bit frantic at the moment so I’m probably not making much sense. My name is Kieran Gates and I’m the godfather to my best friend’s son Matthew Hues. 

Catherine and I were the best of friends after we met in our freshman art class in high school, bonding over our love of art and more importantly architecture. 

We were inseparable during our high school days and even enrolled at the same university. Catherine and I even dated for a brief period- Matty isn’t mine- but we stayed good friends and close after the breakup. Matthew’s dad was out of the picture as soon as Catherine told him she was pregnant. I was with her during the pregnancy and during the birth, I ended up missing my Art History final to be there and hold her hand. Catherine’s mom came and took over helping take care of Matthew after he arrived, so I went back to focusing on my studies, still making time to drop by every now and then to check in on them. She had made it abundantly clear before and after Matty was born that if anything were to happen to her, I’d be Matthew’s godfather and become his primary caretaker. 

Eventually life got in the way and Catherine and I drifted apart. She was busy raising her kid and I was moving on in life working towards my Masters in architecture. Catherine had to drop out of school so she could work, take care, and provide for him. 

That was seven years ago, and now I’m the Head Architect at the firm I work for. Catherine and I hadn’t spoken much over these past few years since I’ve been so busy with work and climbing up the corporate ladder. We briefly reconnected when her mother passed, but I couldn’t stick around for long because of work. It was closed casket because her mother had been brutally murdered in a home invasion. Catherine’s mom had been babysitting Matty at the time. Matthew wasn’t at the funeral because Catherine didn’t want to have him experience all of that on top of hearing everything they did to her while he hid in a closet upstairs.

Before the social worker had left she explained to me what happened and why Matthew was all banged up.

He and his mother had gotten into a pretty severe hit and run earlier in the night. Catherine had gotten the brunt end of it since they got T-boned on the drivers side of the vehicle, Matty escaping with a minor concussion and some bruises. Thankfully, Catherine and Matty were able to make it out of the car before she called nine-one-one for help. She had already passed when the first responders got there. Along with other internal injuries, their was a piece of shrapnel wedged in her leg that had cut into her femoral artery, so she essentially bled to death. Matty hadn’t said a single word since the accident, which is understandable however, from what I heard he hadn’t talked much since his grandmother died in front of him, which again, is understandable.

I had to call off of work that morning since I didn’t know anybody who could look after him on such short notice, or at all. Instead of going to the meeting and introducing my new project, I had to spend the day getting Matthew situated and making preparations for Catherine’s body since she had no other friends and family besides me. In the meantime though, it was still early in the morning, so I set Matthew up in one of my two guest bedrooms- which would be converted into his own once his belongings from their house had been collected and brought to mine. I myself went back to sleep. 

When my eyes filtered open there was a child sitting there staring at me. I jumped and grabbed my chest before checking the time on my phone. It was seven thirty in the morning. 

“Jesus Christ, Matty! What are you doing just standing there?”

No response, he just clasped his hands behind his back while staring down at his feet. 

“I’m sorry for yelling.” I said in a quieter, more gentle tone. “You just scared me is all.” 

He still stood there not saying anything. 

I sighed and checked my phone. There was a text from my boss saying that he understood my predicament but still needed the blueprints for the meeting that would be happening in an hour or so. One of my co-workers would be presenting the project for me. I shot him a quick text saying I’ll be in and then got up to get ready. 

My commute was about thirty minutes away from my house so that left about fifteen minutes for me to get ready and have a fifteen minute buffer in case something went wrong. Oh boy, did something go wrong.

I had decided to forgo a quick shower but I did wash my face and brush my teeth. I combed my little mop of dark brown hair and touched up the light stubble growing on my face, all the while Matty stood behind the door that led into my bathroom, watching me. Since I was practically a stranger to him, I think he was just trying to scope me out, but that didn’t explain why he was watching me sleep.

He followed me to my closet where I picked out a business casual outfit. Normally I’d be wearing a three piece suit, but I wasn’t going to be working. Seeing as I still would be going into the office, business casual felt like the right choice instead of one of my sparse T-shirts and sweatpants. I had to close the door to the walk-in so for some privacy to change into a pair of black dress pants and a white, long sleeve, collared, button up. 

When I re-emerged I was met with Matthew. I looked him up and down, getting a better look at the kid now that I was fully awake. He was wearing a white T-shirt and some light blue jeans. There were bandages littering his face covering up the little cuts he’d gotten from the accident and a few bruises had started showing up on his arms. He looked a little creepy to be honest, like his face was void of all emotion and his eyes looked empty. I remembered the happy little baby he was seven years ago and couldn’t believe I was looking at the same kid. To be fair though, he’d gone through stuff the average seven year old doesn’t. He didn’t say anything as I took a second to analyze him, just looked me dead in the eyes, peering into my soul. 

After I got a good look at the kid, I slipped on some shoes, grabbed my wallet and keys, and got ready to leave.

“C’mon Matty, let’s go.” I called from my office downstairs, blueprints in hand. He hadn’t followed me back to the ground floor after leaving my room and instead went back to his. I didn’t feel comfortable leaving him alone in my house by himself, not wanting him to get overwhelmed be alone in a new place he’s never been before. It was also a good opportunity to go shopping for some things he needed like bedsheet, clothes, and other stuff seven years old boys need.

I heard his little feet pitter-patter down the stairs a few seconds later. 

He followed me out into my driveway, so I assumed he’d hop right into the back seat of my BMW. I was confused when the engine had been running for at least a minute and I didn’t hear the sound of the passenger door opening. I turned my head and saw him just standing there, staring at me. 

“What are you doing just standing there?” I asked after rolling down the window. It then hit me like a ton of brick and I felt like an asshole. He’d just been in a car accident where his mom died. I got out of the car and met with him.

“Are you feeling up for a car ride, Matty? I really have to drop these blueprints off. We also need to do a little shopping too.”

He violently shook his head no and started shaking a little bit.

“Do you want to stay here by yourself then?”

He again shook his head no and then sat down in the middle of the driveway with his hands crossed. 

I didn’t have time for this or his tantrum. 

“C’mon Matty, please?” I begged, my patience wearing thin.

He just stared into his lap and sat there. 

I waited for another minute weighing my options on what to do. I was extremely new to this and had no idea of what the boundaries were between me and him. An idea popped into my head and I went back to the car.

“Bye, Matty.” I yelled out the passenger side window as I started to back out of the driveway. He didn’t budge even when I had rolled back like five feet. I stopped the car and got out. 

“Matthew Hues, I’m not leaving you here by yourself. I’m sorry you are feeling this way, but I have to go and I’m going to be late.” I scolded as I grabbed one of his arms and pulled him off the ground. He started to protest by hitting my arms and crying as I dragged him to the car. He tugged back the whole way and was being difficult when I finally got him in the backseat and buckled him in. He scowled at me with his arms crossed into his chest as I pulled out of the driveway. Of course the first emotion this kid shows is anger, just my friggen luck. 

We drove in silence for a little bit before I glanced back at him, where he was now looking out the window.

“I’m sorry.” I said quietly. His head didn’t move, which meant he was just ignoring me.

“Sorry.” I said louder, his head still not moving. “You’re safe with me Matty, ok? I promise you. I won’t let anything happen to you.” 

He didn’t say anything, but his arms unfolded and he placed them in his lap. A bit of the tension between us dissipated then. 

I was weary that he would try to take off an run when I left him in my car- which I left running- as I dropped off the blueprints, which in retrospect was a really bad decision on my part since my car could’ve been stolen or he taken, but thankfully he was still in there when I got back a few minutes after leaving him. He had fallen asleep. He looked cute and somewhat peaceful.

I woke him up after stopping somewhere for breakfast. After that I spent the rest of the day shopping with him getting him some new toys and other things that he needed. 


Matthew and I had just finished eating some Chinese takeout I’d ordered when an angry pounding came from my front door. Matty was startled by the loud, sudden, noise and my heart sank.

“Oh shit. Whitney” I mumbled to myself as I got up from my dining table. 

“What the hell, Kieran!” My girlfriend Whitney yelled as her evil little purebred apple head chihuahua jumped from her arms and into my house. She pushed her way passed me and into the house. 

I’d totally forgotten about date night with everything going on. I didn’t even tell her about Matty. 

“Who the hell is this?” Whitney gestured to Matthew as he was now standing in his chair as Cinnamon was jumping and barking at him. She was looking mighty sexy in her black dress with a long slit that exposed her upper mid thigh and legs. 

“I’m sorry, I forgot about date night babe. That’s Matthew, I’m his godfather.”

Whitney’s blonde curls bounced as her head snapped towards him,“Godfather?!” 

She then stomped her way towards me and Cinnamon followed, now jumping and scratching at my legs. “You know how I feel about kids, Kier.”

When we first started dating, Whitney made it abundantly clear that she hated children and didn’t want any, and that Cinnamon would be the only thing remotely close to a child as she would have. I hadn’t really thought about having kids before being so busy with work and everything so I accepted her terms. 

That was before Matty came back into my life.

“I- I know.” I said defensively as I took a step back and looked towards Matty. He was staring back at me, a scared and worried expression on his face. “But there isn’t much I can really do about it Whitney. His mom just died for Pete’s sake!”

She looked at him and then back to me before scoffing and crossing her arms. 

“There’s some Chinese left if you want to join us.” I offered, gesturing towards the table with food still on it.

“Ugh, no thanks. I’m going home and having a girls night. You can make it up to me later. C’mon Cinnamon!” Her dog jumped back into her arms and she promptly left, but not before slamming my front door. 

Matty squeaked at the loud noise.

Nothing much happened that night as Matthew scurried off to his room to play with some of the new toys he’d picked out. 

The next day, which is today, I couldn’t call off of work again and still found no babysitter, so I brought him into the office with me. There was some resistance getting into the car again, but not as much as the first time. He mostly spent the day playing with the new teddy bear I’d gotten him in my office with a few awkward interactions with him and my co-workers. 


Everything was fine and dandy until I got home where I immediately slipped on a pool of dog piss. Cinnamon had the come up to me and started mopping my face as her urine seeping into the clothing on my back. When I got up Matty had latched onto the back of my leg, trying to hide from the dog.

Scanning my living room there were two piles of dog poop and the pee I’d just slipped on. I limped my way towards my table where there was a note from Whitney.
It read:

“Had to go on a last minute business trip. I’ll be gone for a few days, so you can make last night up to me by watching Cinnamon. Love you!”

I sighed as I threw the note back on the table. She could’ve texted me, but no. She just dropped her dog, that only loved her for some reason, off at my house and left.  This wasn’t new for her though since she often was called off business trips for her work. 

Cinnamon hated everyone, but for some particular reason she absolute despised Matthew and was barking and growling more aggressively than she normally did. I was uneasy about the whole thing and was about to put cinnamon on her leash and take her for a walk to calm down, but she ended up lunging for Matty before I could get to her.

My heart started racing as I ran towards the dog and little boy, trying to intercept before anything bad happened, but the barking stopped and Cinnamon yelped as she was lifted off the floor and into the air. I glanced at Matthew who had his hand stretched out pointed at the dog. Before I new it, Cinnamon was launched at the back wall in my living room. Two loud, sickening, thuds seceded each other as the little chihuahua impacted my wall and then fell to the floor. She whimpered for a little bit before going silent.

I stood there in shocked silence as I looked between Matthew and the dead corpse of my girlfriends dog. If I saw what I think I saw, then Matthew picked the dog up with his mind and then killed it…

He just stared at me with concern on his face. He was breathing heavily and then took off towards his room. I didn’t say anything as I stood there for a while.

Eventually I cleaned up Cinnamon’s mess before heading into my garage for my shovel.

Since I’m an architect I designed and helped build my house. It’s a three bed two bath two story American Craftsman with a decent sized front yard and driveway. There’s a pool in the back yard with an in ground deck with a little patch of grass that was about two and a half yards by two and a half yards big. 

Obviously I couldn’t burry the dog in the front yard where my neighbors could see me, so I headed to the back. It took me a few hours, but the deed is done. 

Matty hasn’t come out of his bedroom since the incident. 

I’m tired, exhausted, and just finished scrubbing all the sweat and dirt out of every nook and cranny on my body. 

I- I just don’t know what to do.

This subreddit seemed like the appropriate place, so I thought I’d come here and ask for some advice. 

Please, what do I do?

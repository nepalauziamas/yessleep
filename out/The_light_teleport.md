One evening at 3 o'clock in the morning I went out for my evening walk.  I usually did it when I was tense at home and couldn't sleep.  I walked down the street and lit a cigar when something caught my eye.  


A circular light about 50 meters away from me was coming from the end of the street and seemed to be getting closer to me little by little.  I decided to see what was going on and more and more resourcefully I began to walk towards it, and it was getting closer and closer to me, and finally, about 10 meters from it, I saw something strange in it.  Inside it was what looked like a thin black figure that was wrapped around it.


More and more amazed, I began to approach the figure and the light, but suddenly I stopped in place, amazed by what was happening in front of me.


Several more figures emerged from the light, as if their numbers were increasing with each passing second.  Was it some sort of teleportation machine, I don't know that, all I know is that one of the figures turned to me and looked at me and before long the others sensed and they followed it, I didn't hesitate for a moment and ran out of there  how strong my legs were.


I went home, locked myself in and tried to forget about what I saw.  I tried to calm down and went to bed.  A little before 5 in the morning I woke up and felt that my eyes were completely covered in this yellow light.


When I looked out the window I froze in place.  There they were, in my yard, in that yellow light.  My heart would have stopped in terror.  I went downstairs to make sure the doors were locked and started checking them one by one.  They were all locked up.  Suddenly, the same yellow light that I saw on the street and in my yard began to appear from the corridor.  "How did they do it" I thought.  “Wasn't that some kind of teleport and they were teleporting into my house right now?”


I was horrified and ran upstairs to my room and locked myself in, though it didn't really matter as they could teleport to my room.  Should I have called the police?  And what was I going to tell them that some alien ghosts teleported into my room?!  I just had no other choice and curled up under the covers?


About 15 minutes passed when from under the covers I started to see the light that was already forming in my room.  I was shocked and didn't know what to think at that moment.  All I felt was fear.  I peeked through the covers and they were there, covered in this yellow light, but they didn't seem to see me.  I guess like on the street, they could see me after a certain amount of time.


Maybe the teleporter had some side effects that was causing them.  I took advantage of their temporary loss of vision and quickly hid under the bed.  A period of time passed when the light faded and their footsteps began to be heard coming towards my bed.  I didn't know how to react, I just resigned myself and had to wait, maybe when they made sure there was no one in my room, they will left, I don't know.  A few more footsteps were heard near the bed and suddenly they stopped.


Then I felt the strongest grip on my leg that I have ever felt.  One of these things grabbed my leg and pulled me out from under the bed.  When I found myself on the ground without any protection or weapon I had no choice but to look at the face of this thing.  What I saw left me in total shock.  In the face it looked like some animal with whiskers, it was like a cross between a cat and that spirit of the harvest moon from Courage The Cowardly Dog.


All of a sudden, when this thing leaned towards me with its arms outstretched towards me supposedly trying to grab me and eat me or kidnap me or kill me or something, I put my hands in front of my face as a defense mechanism.  And after a period of time not feeling contact with that thing, I removed my hands from my face and saw that the sun had risen and there was no sign of that thing.


I don't know what that thing was, but now I'm glad it's gone.  Since then I've been afraid to live alone and I've moved back in with my mother and also got a girlfriend.  Whatever this thing was, it was clearly afraid or hypersensitive to natural light like the sun.  I don't know why they did all this to me, apparently they were afraid of me witnessing the teleportation they did and which I saw and not tell anyone.


I quietly told no one except my mother, my sister, my girlfriend and my small group of friends.  Peace. XD

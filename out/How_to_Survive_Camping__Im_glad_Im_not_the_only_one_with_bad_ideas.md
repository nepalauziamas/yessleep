I run a private campground.  It’s not an easy job and there’s a lot I have to deal with.  Fortunately, I have all of you to [offer up advice in the comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/k8z11g/how_to_survive_camping_im_starting_to_dislike/)!  Lots.  Of.  Advice.  (having demon babies with Beau is still off the table, for the record)  I suppose I ignore a lot of it in favor of my own ideas, which hasn't always turned out great, but this time I’m taking your advice on how to deal with the children.  Or rather, it just so happens that your advice and my idea on how to handle the situation coincide.

Anyway, if you’re new here, you should really [start at the beginning](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/clp5h4/how_to_survive_camping/), and if you’re totally lost, [this might help](https://www.reddit.com/r/goatvalleycampgrounds/comments/fz6a1d/how_to_survive_camping_index/).

“Oh you just need to get the wagon away from them!”

To be fair, it was what I was thinking as well, but I’m tired of being the one with the bad ideas all the time so I’m going to share the blame.

The simplicity of the plan appealed to me.  I already had all the supplies I needed.  There was that dog tie-out that I’d used to tether the former sheriff a while back.  It was made of wire and was plenty long enough to string between two trees.  I’d park the campground pickup truck nearby with the engine running and when the children were catapulted out of the wagon, I’d grab it, toss it in the back, and then drive off and take it a couple towns over and dump in a river or something, I dunno.  Whatever got it off the land.

Finding the dancers was similarly simple.  As I said last post, once the campground was closed they could be found partying in one of the many clearings in the deep woods almost every night.  I think they enjoy having all the space to themselves.  After sunset, I hopped in the truck and went searching for them.  I took my weapons, of course.  It never hurts to have a backup plan.  I didn’t plan on directly confronting the children, though.  I’m not sure what to do about them, after all.  I just needed to restore the campground back to the way it was, before the dancers *really* got upset with me and did something awful.

Of the two groups, I have to say I’m more frightened of the dancers.  The children are petulant and spiteful.  The dancers are… calculatingly cruel.

I found them in the biggest clearing in the deep woods.  It’s also the clearing used by the camp that hosts the biggest parties at one of our events.  May the two groups never join forces.

The clearing sits in a depression, where the land dips slightly down from the road.  There are a couple entrances, just a few yards of stacked gravel to level the approach into the camp.  I didn’t have enough tripwire to go across all of them and I briefly wondered if I needed to go back and get some rope out of the garage.  Then I thought about it.  If I were a demon-child, determined to wreck someone’s day out of spiteful glee, how would I go about it?

The answer was obvious after that.  The clearing was also situated near a hill leading up and out of the deep woods.  It’s one of the steeper hills we have on the campsite, actually.  If I were a child with a shiny new wagon, no regard for my personal safety, and a penchant for mischief, I would certainly come barreling down that hill and into the clearing.

I positioned the pickup truck for easy flight back up out of the deep woods and started attaching the tripwire to trees on either side of the entrance.  The dancers paused as I began my work.  They stared up at me but none of them made a move.  I couldn’t help but think about rule #4.  The latter half of it.

“If they do not welcome you, but instead stop and stare, back away slowly and then leave. If they follow you, you can try to run, but it is likely already too late. Pray that death comes swiftly.”

But surely this would be fine, right?  I was trying to help them and I hadn’t made an attempt to join them.  I wasn’t even in the clearing.

Still.  It was enough for a cold sweat to break out on the back of my neck.

“Don’t mind me!” I called to the dancers.  “Just putting up a tripwire.”

Most of the dancers dismissed my presence at that explanation and returned to the fire.  The lead dancer, however, meandered over.  She glanced curiously at the wire that I was looping around a stout tree.

“We’re not affected by any metals,” she said.  “You tried that already.”

“This isn’t for you.”

My lack of elaboration was deliberate.  I was hoping she wouldn’t figure out my plan.  I feared she’d take offense at the fact I was using their bonfire as bait.  Unfortunately, these inhuman things are used to deceit by omission.  It’s about the only form of deception that most of them have access to, after all.

“The children,” she said.

“Yep,” I replied as I jerked the wire tight and clipped it off.

“And what happens after that?  Once the children have been angered?”

“Well *I’m* going to jump in the pickup and drive really fast in the opposite direction.  I don’t know what *you* all are going to do, so you might want to figure that out here.”

“You better know what you’re getting all of us into, camp manager.”

She walked off, leaving me to finish my work with that threat hanging over my head.  *Did* I know?  I’ll be honest: not really.  I haven’t seen much of what the children are capable of with my own eyes.  My uncle’s stories gave me some clues, but he was also prone to embellishment.  I figured that if I was going to anger the dancers, it might as well be by doing something that would benefit them.  Maybe they’d go easy on me.  Make me dance until I collapsed again or something other than leaving my dismembered but still living body scattered somewhere.

I’d barely finished the tripwire before I heard the rattling of a wagon from the top of the hill.  Swearing, I ran to the truck and dropped the tailgate.  I hadn’t enough time to prepare completely.  I’d planned to have the truck already running, but now I’d just have to settle for the keys being in the ignition.  I crouched down beside the truck and waited.

I didn’t have a good vantage.  I heard the rattle of the wagon and the gleeful yelling of the children.  Slowly, the dancers all turned to look at the direction they were coming.  I saw the resignation on their faces.  For all their power, they were helpless to do anything.  I suppose that is the curse of their nature.  These inhuman things are bound by patterns and rules.  It is humans that can *change* the world.

Then the wagon hit the tripwire.  I heard a twang and then the shriek of children.  I saw them go flying up in the air, limbs windmilling in the air, and the wagon was behind them, flipping to land upside-down on the ground.  The children hit the dirt and rolled.

I sprinted forwards and seized the handle of the wagon.  I didn’t stop to look at the children.  Speed was my only advantage now.  I ran, dragging the wagon behind me, and then I swung it up and over into the pickup bed.  Then I ran to the driver’s side door and wrenched it open.

Behind me, the children had gone eerily silent.  Their cries had ceased and the only sound I heard was the crackling of the bonfire.  I risked a look, just before I stepped up into the truck.  The children were arrayed in a line at the edge of the clearing, glowering at me in hate, and their eyes seemed to glint.  Behind them, the dancers stood by uselessly and watched.

Between myself and the children was the former sheriff, his arms crossed over his chest and feet planted.

“That’s enough of that,” he drawled.

“But it’s our wagon,” one of the children whined.

“And you were misusing it so now she’s taking it away.  That’s within her rights as the campground manager.”

For a brief moment I was filled with hope.  Sure, they were inhuman things, but I guess they were still children in some way.  Maybe all they needed was a grown-up telling them what to do, one that straddled the line between human and inhuman and still remembered what it felt like to make the world do as he willed.

I can’t believe I’m writing this, but I actually felt grateful towards him.

And then it all went to hell.

A deer came leaping over the pickup bed.  It cleared the truck, easily, and continued on over my head.  I probably didn’t even need to duck and cover, but instinct kicked in and as a monstrous shape passed overhead, I hit the dirt.  The deer landed hard on the other side of the pickup truck and kept going.  The dancers scattered before it.  The children stood frozen in place, the anger in their eyes faltering as their eyes widened with dismay.

They realized the deer wasn’t about to stop.  And why should it?  It was the size of a horse and on its back was a fairy, resplendent in the full power of its kind, armed with a boar spear and clad in armor.  They ran, shrieking, and then whirled to stand just out of reach at the edges of the clearing.  They howled invective at the fairy, their faces pinched with frustrated fury.

And I thought *I* had foul language.

The fairy, of course, ignored them.  The deer spun around, snorting thick clouds of steam into the cold air, and lowered its head to point its antlers at where I lay on the ground, pressed up against the pickup truck’s front tire.  The fairy, too, leveled its boar spear in my direction.

I’m pretty sure I might have pissed myself right then and there if not for the fact that every muscle in my body had constricted in utter, blind, terror and I was incapable of movement in any way.  I’m fairly certain my breathing stopped and I’m probably lucky that my heart wasn’t like ‘yep nope we’re not dealing with a fairy, we’re out and you’re on your own, g’luck with that.’

It was the lead dancer that saved me.  She screamed my name.  Her voice snapped me out of my terrified daze and I realized that the fairy wasn’t looking at me, nor was their weapon leveled precisely in my direction.

It was waiting for something behind me.  And on this campground, knowing what I know, there was only one creature that would dare pursue a fairy.

I scrambled to all fours and threw myself away from the pickup truck.  I had barely gotten a yard away when there was a horrible scream from behind me - the bray of an anguished, enraged animal - and I instinctively turned my head back to look.

The dapple-gray stallion reared over my pickup truck.  Its eyes were white and on its hooves glinted thick iron shoes.  All I could see of its rider was the glowing red eye.

Then it brought its hooves down on my pickup truck bed.  There was a horrendous screech of metal, drowning out the scream of the stallion, and my pickup truck bent in two like it was made of paper.  The axles twisted, the frame collapsed, and the windows shattered.

So now the camp pickup truck is totaled and there’s really not money in the budget for a new one.  The only silver lining here is that the children’s wagon was directly under one of the horse’s hooves when it came crashing down.  I saw one of its wheels go bouncing away into the darkness.

Upon seeing this, the children wailed in dismay.

“Not fair!” one screamed.  The others quickly echoed its cry.

And then… one of them picked up a clod of dirt and *threw* it at the dapple-gray stallion and its rider.

The horse shrieked and stamped a hoof in response, shaking its head to clear the dirt from its mane.  And on its back the fomorian didn’t even bother looking in its direction.  It sat straight up, no longer hunched over and limping, but proud and tall upon its steed.  Its cloak still covered most of its body, but I caught glimpses of tattered leather and bits of metal covering its wasted flesh, pale and pockmarked.  Then it put its hand inside the cloak and withdrew something small, the size of a pebble.  It flicked this at the children.

There was a flash of red light where it struck.  One of the children screamed in terror and I saw the others reaching for their companion, grabbing its hands and pulling it free of the miasma now enveloping it.  A dark mist, from inside which something thrashed and writhed in wild, chaotic movements.  A lurch, and the children fell backwards into a heap.  Then they rolled to their feet and ran, vanishing into the forest.  The dancers were fleeing as well.  And with good reason - the clearing was about to become a battleground.

The two charged each other.  The fairy leveled the boar spear, the fomorian only stretched out its hand.  The boar spear hit, I heard the impact of it sliding into the fomorian’s side, but it did not seem bothered by the wound.  It only wrapped its hand around the shaft and ripped it clean out of the fairy’s grasp.  Then it threw it aside and the weapon spun through the air, firelight rippling along the metal, and it smashed through a slender tree and toppled it before coming to a halt somewhere in the woods, beyond the reach of the light.  The fairy seemed undeterred.  It drew its sword while their steeds vied for an advantage.  The stallion was stretching its head, attempting to bite at the deer’s neck, while the deer fended it off with its horns.  The stallion’s iron shoes struck a flurry of sparks with each step.

A flash of metal as the fairy brought its sword to bear.  The fomorian ducked the swing and the stallion danced sideways, bringing its rider out of reach of the weapon.  I caught a glimpse of it turning its eye towards me and for a moment our gazes locked and I saw the understanding in its look.  There was an opportunity here.  I was now within reach of its hooves, as I tried unsuccessfully to slink out of the clearing in the opposite direction the children had gone.  All it had to do was sidestep.

For a moment, all I could see was the immense hoof raising as it reared up and pivoted in my direction.

A heavy hand seized the back of my jacket.  I had a moment of surprise and then my body instinctively went rigid and my stomach dropped away as the ground rapidly receded beneath me.  Then the acceleration evened out, I was weightless for a moment, spreading my arms and legs and futilely grasping for solid purchase before I fell, my gaze locked on the ground far beneath me.

A sharp jerk at the back of my jacket.  My body swung and I curled in on myself, just before the side of my body slammed against a tree trunk.  Then I dangled there, my jacket straining to hold my weight, the seams digging into my armpits.

It took a moment for the panic to subside.  I mostly held very, very still, breathing shallowly, trying to piece together what had just happened.

“Horse would have crushed your skull, camp manager,” a deep, gravelly voice above me rumbled.  “Funny to see, but then you are not so useful.”

I tentatively glanced up and then hastily averted my gaze again before I reached the shadows of its cowl.  One of the musicians held me.  Its hands and feet were driven *into* the tree and while I knew it had normal fingers, they were still stuck into the wood up to the knuckles.  It wouldn’t be falling anytime soon.  Me?  I carefully crossed my arms, trying to get a grip on the jacket - held firmly in the musician’s free hand - that was the only thing that stood between me and plummeting back down to the ground.

If the fall didn’t kill me, the battle raging below sure would.  The fomorian was trying to close with the fairy, but it was having trouble getting close as the fairy’s sword work was keeping it at bay.  Then I heard the barking of dogs and out of the shadows came immense, sleek shapes, as black as the night itself.  They formed a half-circle around the fomorian, snarling and snapping, and the stallion began to back away.  The fairy did not pursue.  It seemed this skirmish was drawing to a close, with the fomorian retreating from the threat of the dogs.

“I take you home now, yes?” the musician holding me aloft asked.

“That would be swell, sure,” I replied.

I kind of figured it would just set me down and maybe walk me to the wood’s edge, but no, it apparently thought we were safer in the trees and it just kind of flung itself from tree to tree like lumberjack Spider-Man or something.  After the second sickening lurch and momentarily weightlessness, I just closed my eyes really tight and let fear paralyze me.  I can’t even describe what a relief it was to be back on solid ground when we reached the edge of the woods.

When I recovered my wits, I turned to thank the musician, but it was gone.

I wish I could say that was all there was to it, that the first battle between the fairy and the fomorian had resulted in some trees being felled and nothing more.  I went down to the clearing this morning to take a look and that pebble that the fomorian flicked at the children?  I don’t think it was a pebble.

I think it was a seed.

Thorns have sprouted where it landed.  Blackened, twisted branches like they’ve been burnt.  They wrap around the nearby trees and wherever they touch, their thorns pierce into the bark and the wood around the wound is charred and flakes away into ash.

The fomorian will destroy my land in his battle to kill the fairy.

I’m a campground manager. I can’t let that happen. [\[x\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/goatvalleycampgrounds/)

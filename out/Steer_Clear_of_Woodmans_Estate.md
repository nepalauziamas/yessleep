Dead trees and abandoned cars surrounded the house. All the windows were boarded up with framing Lumber, and in red letters, the words Stay Out were written on the surface. The front porch was plagued with cobwebs, and a giant padlock reinforced the front door. As a kid, we were always taught to steer clear of Woodman's estate. However, I could no longer resist the lore of that place, so I planned to investigate. 

The family that used to live there mysteriously vanished one day, and their disappearance is a dark secret in our community that no one likes to discuss. A lot of people speculate that the family was involved in some witchcraft, which resulted in their disappearance. Another common theory is that the father killed the entire family and fled the country with his mistress. No one knows what happened, and the police closed the case years ago, but I believe there has to be more to this story. 

 I arrived around midnight and began to weave through the forest of dead trees and cars. I used a stick I grabbed off the ground to slice my way through the cobweb that infested the front porch. I planned to use a pair of bolt cutters to cut through the padlock; however, as I attempted to cut the lock, my bolt cutters broke. Moreover, I noticed weird carvings and incantations on the padlock that I'd never seen before.

After several minutes of stripping the lumber from one of the window's, I was finally able to make entry into the house. I was surprisingly shocked by how clean and maintained the place looked inside. The house had been abandoned for over five years, yet there wasn't a cobweb or spec of dust in sight. Furthermore, all the lights in the house were on, which was very odd because the city should have turned off the electricity years ago.

While searching the rest of the house for clues about the missing family, I noticed more carvings and incantations. On top of every door frame, there was a carving of a headless lion with incantations underneath the carving. I was curious about the meaning of the carvings, so I tried a reverse search of the image. However, whenever I took a picture of the carving, I couldn't find the image in my photo gallery. 

After searching the house for several hours for Clues, there was only one area left unchecked, the basement. The basement door wasn't like any other door in the house because it didn't have carvings or incantations above the frame. Moreover, the door itself was a  mirror with a black handle as a doorknob. At this point, I was reluctant to continue my investigation, but I pressed on.

As I slowly descended the stairs, I was horrified to see a group of naked men and women standing at the bottom. I tried to run back up the stairs, but the door slammed shut. The group of individuals started chanting something in a language I didn't understand. I was so afraid they would kill me that I passed out, and when I woke up, I was in bed.

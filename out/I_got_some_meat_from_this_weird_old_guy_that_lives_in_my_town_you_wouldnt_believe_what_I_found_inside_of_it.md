There is a weird old man that lives down the road from me, he always wears this raggedy looking brown tweed jacket with a t-shirt underneath. Everyone makes fun of him; it doesn't help that he collects roadkill, his rusty old pickup truck is always full of all kinds of critters, like foxes, badgers or even cats. On the rare occasions when he comes across something bigger like a deer, he doesn't leave his property for days, then reappears, with a cooler in the back of his truck. I guess he butchers the animals and sells them, but the only person I ever seen him even talk to is Tom Hogan the local entrepreneur. Which is a bit strange, Roadkill Rick the town’s poorest man is best friends with the richest man in town. I suppose Tom is just a nice guy and feels sorry for him, he does a lot for the community, he saved so many businesses from failing when times were tough, people love him around here.

I am not sure what he does with the smaller critters, some people say he eats them, others say he feeds them to his dog that he keeps locked up in a shed out his back yard. I have never seen him with any dog before, alive that is, but my dad knows the mailman and he said he often heard him growling when he called, but no one has ever seen it, the shed is always locked up tight. I always felt bad for Rick and hated when the kids would tease him, one day I saw some kids throwing stones at him, I was pissed, I told them fuck off and chased them away. When I went back to see was he ok, he lifted his bowler hat, bowed down to me, and gave a polite, “Thank you sir” before walking off, anytime I saw him after that, he would give me a quick nod and a smile as he passed by.

Yesterday morning he arrived at my house with a present for me, a lump of meat wrapped in old newspapers, blood was dripping off it down my welcome mat. I was a bit surprised and didn’t know what to say to him, so I just smiled and nodded, he did the same, then he just walked away. At the edge of my driveway, he then turned around and charged back towards me at pace. When he got to the door, I jumped back. I thought he was going to knock me over he was walking so fast.

Then he stopped suddenly, leaned in, and put his finger into my face and whispered, “400 degrees for 90 minutes, and don’t tell another soul about this, do you hear.” 

I replied, “ok, thanks,” he looked stressed at my confusion.

He started waving his finger in my face again, and said, "400 for 90 minutes, no more no less, and don’t tell no one about this, you got that.” Then stood there staring at me impatiently waiting for my reply.

I blurted out, “Ok, ok 400 for 90 minutes, and I won’t tell anyone, I got it, thanks.” He just kept staring at me silently for about 30 seconds without even blinking, it was so strange, I didn’t know what to do. Then he smiled, tipped his hat, and started walking away whistling, like nothing happened, I closed the door and went to the kitchen, put the meat in a container and left it in the fridge. I was now late because of him and had to rush out the door, as the day went on, I forgot all about it. Until after work when I was about to cook dinner, I planned on eating a pork chop that I had bought the day before, but it had gone bad. I never intended on eating the meat rick left me, but when I opened it up it looked really good it was like any other beef roast. Then I thought if it’s good enough for Tom Hogan its good enough for me.

I remembered what Rick said and turned the oven to 400 degrees and 90 minutes later it was done. I have no idea what animal it was, but I didn’t care I was starving, and it smelled amazing. I cut off a big lump of it put it on my plate and went to the living room to watch tv. After tasting it, I thought Rick was right 400 for 90 minutes was the perfect amount of time. It was so juicy and tinder, it was the best meal I had in a long time.

When I got about halfway through it, I hit something hard. I thought it was bone, but then I looked closer. I don’t know how to say this, but it looked like some sort of animal fetus, I vomited all over the floor, I spent the next hour in the bathroom, I was never so sick before. When I got back to the living room the whole experience came back to me again and I nearly puked. I had no choice but to clean up so I got the mop and started cleaning, then I saw the plate out of the corner of my eye, I thought I would run to the bin and empty it as fast as I could without looking at it. But when I got to the kitchen, I got curious and decided to have one more look, I wasn’t sure what I was looking at, it was round, and kind of translucent with something inside, but I couldn’t make out what it was. So, I leaned in to get a closer look, it moved and frightened the shit out of me, I fell back on my ass.

When I got up, I was in shock, I thought what the fuck was that and how could it survive being cooked. logically I thought it was just nerves, I had seen videos of octopus moving after being cooked. I couldn't look at it anymore, it was too creepy, so I put it back in the container with the rest of it and left it down beside the fireplace. I was going to get it checked out by a vet or something the next day to find out what it was. I still felt like crap, so I went to bed.

This morning after breakfast I went to check on it, I'm not sure why, maybe it was because I was a bit paranoid and wanted to make sure it was actually dead. When I opened the container, my jaw dropped, all the meat was gone, and the creature had grown three times its size. It started to have more of an oval shape too and it was getting harder to see through it. The only thing I could make out was two eyes, they were blinking and seemed to follow me around the room, I was disgusted, I just closed the lid and fired it in the corner. 

Then I realized Rick must have known about that thing when he gave it to me, I thought, why would he do that to me, I was always nice to him. I went looking for him, I searched the whole town, I even went to his house, but he wasn’t there, his shed was wide open, and he was nowhere to be seen. When I got home, I heard banging coming from the container. I was terrified and didn’t know what to do. Then it came to me, it was probably hungry, so I got some sausages from the fridge, opened the lid, dropped them in and closed it as fast as I could. That seemed to work because I have not heard anything from it for hours.

I don’t know what to do, it’s growing really fast, and I don’t know who to talk to about it or if I even should, after Rick warned me not to. I am going to lock it in a suitcase for tonight and hopefully I can find Rick tomorrow and sort all this shit out.

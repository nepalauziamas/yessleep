I woke up in the middle of the night to the sound of something walking outside, I crept as cautiously as I could through the small cabin.

I looked out of the window, there was a Skull Horse outside. It was walking on all fours like an animal, I guess it was an animal, albeit a highly mutated one.

Then, it turned and saw me, staring me dead in the eyes and it began to stand up. It raised its hands in the air and let out what must have been some twisted mockery of a neigh.

I ducked down under the window, I heard it begin to gallop around the cabin.

I crawled back into the bedroom and I heard it break one of the windows, probably near the door to enter the cabin.

I covered my mouth and nose as it came near the room I was in, although it was dark, I could see from the moonlight that it stopped abruptly at several points, as though it were listening for something.

Minutes felt like hours as the beast stalked the room, looking and listening for me, but I didn't move. I wasn't going to be corrupted by that thing even if I died avoiding it.

I saw the monster begin to wander around before one of the gray men burst into the room. It delivered a slash to the Skull Horse, cracking its skull. That's when I saw that underneath the skull-like shell, there was pure, raw muscle.

The Skull Horse attempted to fight back, but the Gray man prevailed and the monster jumped out of my window. The gray man then looked down at me, and I noticed that it didn't have the other creatures' empty, milky white pupils, but rather, it had normal human eyes.

"Ghhh... Paul? Paul is that you?" I asked, with my heart still pounding.

"Yes, sorry that I came back so late. Hell, the fact I found you guys here was a stroke of luck. I wasn't captured, I was hiding. And good god, I never want to re-live what I had to do to avoid them." He replied, it was his voice alright.

Then, the sound of laughter echoed outside, we both froze and stared out the window while trying to stay hidden. The monster outside wasn't focused on us though, something else had caught its attention.

I could see a young woman who was *maybe* in her early 20s hiding behind a tree, and she realized that the Skull Horse caught her.

She screamed for help, but we couldn't get there in time even if we wanted to. All we could do was watch as the skull horse grabbed her by the neck and threw her to the ground. It pinned her down so hard that I think I heard some of her bones break as she helplessly wailed with no chance of escape.

"Paul, we NEED to go help her," I said, and I wasted absolutely no time as I went to dad's bedside and snatched a stolen handgun from him, and bolted out the door, not even taking the time to put on socks.

I got there as I saw the Skull Horse biting into her abdomen and using its claws to mutilate her. Then, her stomach came open. By that I don't mean her stomach was exposed, I could see the acid inside of her indicating that it was opened up.

Then, it bit down as she screamed, and I could faintly see the monster insert a forked, black tongue inside of her stomach and begin pumping something inside. I couldn't take it anymore, even now I am haunted by the image of that poor girl.

I aimed the handgun at the creature and fired into its chest. It screeched as it let go of her, and it charged at me in a state of fury.

I fired shot after shot after shot until I finally shot through its eye and into its brain. The creature flew backward, letting out one last scream before its chest finally fell for the last time, and it stopped breathing.

To make sure it was dead, I began to beat its head in with the gun until I could see its brain, I kneeled over and vomited nearby. I'm only a teenager, but **nobody** should have to go through what I did at that moment.

Tears welling in my eyes, I turned to the woman as I began to notice her skin turning dark gray, her head smoothening and changing shape, her growing taller as her pelvis stretched out, her eyes now being empty in the pupils, and antennas starting to sprout along her spine and forehead.

She still wept as her stomach was still partially open and spoke while her lips began to recede, "W... what's h-happening to me?"

I then approached the mutating woman and pressed the gun against her head, "I'm... I'm sorry, but it has to be done. Dying is better than becoming one of them." From there, I fired the last shot into her still not-fully changed head.

Her head snapped back as the mutation stopped, and so did her heart.

"SAMANTHA, ARE YOU ALRIGHT?!?! WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED HERE?!?!" I heard dad and Paul shout to me, I turned around, "No! I just fucking killed someone!!!" I wouldn't speak a word for a while, I was in denial of the fact that I, Samantha, a skinny 15-year-old girl from Canada had just put an end to someone's life.

Vova didn't show any emotion though and told my dad as he was horrified, "Listen, I know that it's sad she had to do this, but it was either that or the poor woman would become one of the monsters, and we would probably be next."

Paul then responded, still shaken, "I guess that's true, I wouldn't want anybody to end up like me." My dad didn't say a word, but after a while he did. "Okay, I don't understand the creatures, but I guess I can understand that this had to be done... let's just... try to find somewhere else tomorrow."

The next day, I woke up in the early hours of the morning as the sun had just begun to rise. Everyone quickly got dressed and we rushed with our supplies to find somewhere else.

Keep in mind that this was rural Canada, which isn't exactly the most... populated from where I've been to. Help from someone else was essentially a far-fetched dream.

We began walking through the snow in the woods, I didn't dare turn to where that woman was, I still wasn't able to stop thinking about what happened.

I saw what looked like a house in the woods, but as we got closer it was a stone statue.

The design was that of a humanoid figure covered in eyes, with two sunken circles on its face which may have also been eyes.

There was an inscription at the base.

&#x200B;

>\-OUR QUEEN THE CORRUPTED ONE-

&#x200B;

I stood there, I didn't need Vova or Paul to tell me it, I knew that this was the queen that they were talking about.

Just then, a giggling sound came from behind us. It sounded raspy and weak, we all turned our heads only to see Jack right there with a massive scar on his body where I slashed him.

"Oh dear, what do we have now? I hope you're enjoying the scenery dear fools hehehehehehe." He said, that's when we all ran from him. We kept across a mutual path as we ran for our lives, then Charles popped in front of me.

When we exchanged eye contact I saw a hallucination of his face in the dark with the sound of his wild screams. It sort of blended into my sight and then faded, and I panicked. I ran and ran and I heard Vova shout, "SAMANTHA, WHERE IN GOD'S NAME ARE YOU GOING?!" but I kept running.

I ran inside an old building, it was a decent-sized home. I looked back, neither of those damn twins were there, but they still won because I was now completely lost.

"Samantha, Samantha where are you?" I heard Paul ask, but it was more telepathic than physical speech.

"I... I found an old house, I don't know where I am." I responded, "Well that was a pretty reckless choice you made, how did you even-" "I panicked alright?"

Paul sighed and then continued. "Well, me and sir Vova will try to find a place connected to wherever that may be, sir Vova will try to get your location."

After a few seconds, he then continued, "Okay, we know of your location now and we'll try to get there as soon as we can, just hang tight."

Then, silence filled the woods, I walked up the stairs and went past a mounted pair of antlers by the front door. I tried opening the door only to find that it was locked. I tried grabbing a blunt object to break a window but some sort of mesh kept me from entering.

I wasn't content to stay in the cold either, so I went around the side of the house to find another way inside.

I went around the side down the slope beside the house and there was a door into the basement from there. Thankfully, it was unlocked.

I walked inside, there were no lights on but there was enough light from the open door for me to get a basic sense of where I was.

*Flick!* When I flicked the switch, nothing happened. Great, there was no power and there were no windows. I searched the table nearby until I found a flashlight, I turned it on and I could find my way around.

I was in a kitchen with a lot of clutter and a single door by the light switch. On the wall was a cross which was broken in half with the bottom one on the floor and broken apart.

I walked into the doorway and there was a hallway with two doors near each end, and at the left end was a small living room, at the other there was what looked like a furnace with a small workshop-like area next to it.

But then Charles appeared next to me, I shined my light at him out of surprise and fear, but as it fell upon his eyes he yelled out as he covered them, he then vanished.

After calming slightly, I stepped inside the living room. There were taxidermied deer heads mounted on the walls, there was a tiny couch and an old-school tv.

Other than some trash long since abandoned, there wasn't anything worth my time in there. I went to the door and found that it was locked... without any visible keyhole. When I went to the furnace area, I found lots of tools complete with a chair that had restraints in it, there was discolored blood as well.

I looked over and found a powerbox, I opened it up only to find that it was missing a fuse. I chuckled upon seeing that. Just my luck.

Out of places to go, I went upstairs. I reached the first floor and I noticed that the door was wide open. One difference between the basement and the main home was that... this place was well-kept.

It had smooth walls painted white with wood aligning the bottom, clean and shiny wooden floors, nicely decorated tile ceilings, and also very good housekeeping in general.

I had entered a kitchen, I looked out to see three windows in front of me. I saw the right side of the porch from there and knew that I had gotten around the door successfully.

Through the doorway to my right, there was a hallway with around 4 other doorways.

The first one to the left went to the front door, the other on the left led into a living room, and both on the right went into a sort of office. At the end was an open closet door, and in the computer room, there was a closed door with a staircase leading up right above it.

I walked inside the office and opened the door, the floor changed to a tile pattern as I entered the bathroom. The bathtub was in front of me, and both the toilet and sink were to my right.

Just then, I heard floorboards creaking behind me and they got farther and farther away. I turned around only to see nothing, just the basement door slightly more open than it had been.

Just as I turned back around, Charles appeared again and I ran into the living room, the floor changed to a light carpet as I ran, and I ducked behind one of the two couches.

He entered as I hid, he then vanished. I cautiously climbed out and entered the office again. I crept slowly upstairs, there was just a hallway with three doors, the one in front of me was closed, and the one on the right at the end of the hallway was opened.

I went inside and saw a bedroom inside. There was just a small bed and a small carpet inside though so I just turned back around.

The other door led into another bathroom so I quickly left that room. The last one was a larger room, it seemed to be a storage area, but had a table in it with a microscope and test tubes, and there was also a discarded file that was still open.

From what I could tell, it looked like it was going to be sent somewhere but it never was. And something else was nearby, and of course, it was that damn fuse.

I picked it up and went back inside the basement, I placed it in and activated the power. As soon as I thought I could breathe a sigh of relief, I saw that there was a new creature behind me.

It looked shorter than most, not even 7 feet tall. I noticed that it had no facial features like its face was smoothed over with clay. It was skinny, with spindly fingers without thumbs that were far longer than they should be.

And at the ends were tiny hooks, they looked like a replacement for the tongues of the other monsters.

It began walking towards me and I darted past it. The thing stopped for a second before walking back toward me.

But thankfully, the door which had been locked was now unlocked. As soon as I entered, I bolted deep down the stairs and into a new area which was a labyrinth of hallways and rooms.

I entered a door and looked behind me only to see the thing right there. Unlike the other creatures, I actually have a photo of the exact moment in my camera roll. Don't ask me how, I didn't even have my phone with me when it happened but [here it is.](https://imgur.com/a/8sG3axH)

Just then I heard Paul communicate with me, only in a very distorted manner. "Oh god... what the hell is that?"

I ran as far as I could, aimlessly through the halls and rooms of that place.

I found one spot though, it was a door that had a lock inside of a hospital-like room. I jumped inside and locked the door with the sound of that thing pursuing outside.

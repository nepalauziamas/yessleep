Hello, my name is Robert. Well, that's not my real name, more of a name I just came up with. The reason why I came up with this fake name is pretty much explainable. No, this isn't clickbate either, or using this as a little clout for attention. 

I should probably stop stalling and get onto the story, huh? How did I even reach to this conclusion to begin with? 

First off, let me talk a little bit more about that friend. I'm honestly scared to reveal his true identity so, we gonna call him Henry for the rest of this story. 

Henry is a definition of a "Social Butterfly" in my eyes. He always gets along with me, charm all of them just by his beautiful green eyes and his mascular body. His deep, yet calming voice will always manage to give you butterflies and forget the worst day you had at work. I envy him at first, and even had a massive crush on him. 

I should probably also tell you right now that I am gay and indeed, a male. 

Back to Henry. One day, he begins to date this girl. For this purpose, I will call her Carly. Carly is a angel in my eyes. She's very polite, soft spoken, but yet knows when to stand her ground. So of course, I try not to piss off the woman. She is also dating my best friend, so she has massive respect for me. 

One day, Henry invited me over for a date the two were having. Why he wanted me to become their third wheel is something I still confuse with to this day, but I agree to come over. 

The restaurant was very fancy, it was like Olive Garden honestly. We also did have a very fun time, eating, drinking, until Carly got very sick and begins puking uncontrolly. 

Henry, noticing this and standing right beside her, helped her get up and walk to the car. 

"Sorry bud, but I have to cut this day short!" He told me before driving off. That was the last time I heard of Carly. 

For the next couple of days, I haven't heard from both Henry and Carly. I thought nothing of it at first, maybe they were having their little couple moment. 

One particular day, I decided to watch the news since I was very bored and had nothing to do. I just finish my Psychology work for the day, and I have nothing else to work on. 

Once I turn on the news, the first thing I notice was a picture of Carly. Strange, why would she be in the news? 

"Carly Hamison, a 26 year old female, has been missing for a week now. The last place that she was seen was at a hotel, seemingly running away from a stranger". 

Stranger? The last time I saw her, she was sick and wasn't feeling well. And I know Henry was dropping her off to his house. Not only that, but the footage the news showing me happens three days later, after I last talk to them. 

Of course, at first, I doubt Henry would do something like that. But, it slowly begins adding up. He hasn't been here for a couple of days also, and he was the last person to stay with Carly until her disappearance. 

I decided to pick up the phone and call Henry first. If he is here, then maybe I could ask him when he last saw her. But, there was no answer. 

I begin to feel uneasy and worry for both my best friend and Carly. Maybe they both got kidnap and someone murder both her and Henry? 

I don't know what came over me, but I walk to my car and begin driving to Henry house. I honestly should've called the police first, but I was worry about my best friend too much that I couldn't think straight. 

It took me an hour to reach his house. That uneasy feeling came back, rushing all over my body. I got out of my car and begin to walk to the house, staring at his brown door. 

"Henry isn't a killer, he wouldn't dare do something like this". I constantly tell my mind that. After slowly believing in that lie for a bit, I knock on the door. 

No answer. 

I would knock a couple more times, hoping that someone would answer. 

Still, no answer. 

I would grab the doorknob and turn it. The door was unlock, which is weird. Henry would always lock his door, especially at night. 

That's when my mind cross over to that conclusion. That maybe, Henry and Carly got robbed and was kidnap. 

I walk inside his house, closing the door behind me. It was eerie quiet and dark. My heart begins speeding up as I glance around the house, looking for at least a clue. 

The place looks like it hasn't been touch at all, which makes this even more eerie. 

I would reach over to the living room lights before turning it on. His living room was all neat and clean, wasn't touch at all. I would do the same to the kitchen, and it was also fairly normal. 

"Maybe I'm just overthinking it?" I told myself. But, why is Carly missing then? And why hasn't Herny been answering my calls? 

I walk over to the basement. That basement always gives me the creeps, and Henry would always tell me to avoid going to that basement. 

"Sorry bud" I whisper before opening up the basement. 

The basement was eerily dark, you can barely see the stairs. Reaching for the light switch, I turn on the basement light and begin walking down. 

While walking down, I could smell something so rotten, like someone left their rotten food downstairs for a very long time. It made me feel a bit lightheaded. 

Taking my last step, I begin to glance around the small basement. 

"This basement stinks" I whisper to myself. Then, I notice a toolshed. Strange, Henry never told me about him building. 

I took a couple of steps forward to examine the tools. Hammers, chains, Nails, any tools that you could think of, Henry has it. Not only that, but there seems to be crimson blood in all of them. 

The fear and theory begins to race in my mind again, that my friend might actually be a killer. 

Then, I notice a door right beside the shed. I try to open up that door, but it was lock. 

"I should probably get out of here" My mind would tell me. But my body just stare at that smelly door. I wanted to officially know if my friend was actually a killer or not. The tools might be prove alone, but I wanted to be one+hundred percent sure. 

"Mmhp! MMHP!"

Suddenly, I heard a sound of someone screaming. It sounded familiar. 

"MMHP! MMMMMHP!".

Is that, Carly?! 

"Carly, is that you?!" I shouted at the door. The voice seems to scream a bit louder, reacting to my voice. It is Carly! 

"Carly! Oh fuck! I'll get you out of here, I swear!" I shouted at the door before charging back upstairs. I gotta find his basement key and-

Then, I notice his car was parked outside. Shit! If Henry sees me, I'm dead. 

I quickly ran to the bathroom and hid myself there. Covering my mouth, I would try to control my heavy breathing and thumping heartbeat. 

Thump....thump....thump...

The sound of his footsteps would echo throughout this quiet house. 

"Seems like someone was in my basement". His voice, it wasn't the same cheerful happy voice that I know for years. It was eerie, cold, emotionless, like he was a robot. 

I could hear him walking down the basement, then slowly, unlocking the door. Shit, Carly! I want to save her, but how? I can't just face my best friend and try to fight him. He's twice my size, and have more experience of fighting than me. 

So, I did the most cowardly thing. I quickly unlock my door and begin to run out of the house. The last thing I heard before running outside, was a scream of a victim that my best friend just murder. 

So, why am I typing this right now to reddit? Because, I want to help Carly. Even though she's dead, I want to try to save her soul. She was a sweet innocent person, and me, a fucking coward, let her die. 

I also found out before typing that, this isn't the first time Henry done this. There was a total of thirteen females, all of them missing at the same year and at the exact same time. It's just upsetting to believe that he was the one who did it. 

Or maybe, it wasn't him? I remember that his voice wasn't usually this deep and cold. It was very high pitch and full of energy. I refuse to believe that this is my friend. It can't be. 

I will give you guys more updates if I can. At least, I hope I can. I'm honestly risking my life here just confessing what I saw, and I'm too afraid to go to the police. Would they even believe me? I have no evidence to pinpoint Henry as the murderer. And I not even sure if that deep voice IS Henry. 

But, in the end, my friend might actually be a serial killer. And someday, I probably just gotta accept that fact.

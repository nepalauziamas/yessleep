Hello. My name is Audrey Cote. The things that I'm about to tell you sound undeniably ridiculous, and, trust me, I know, but I need a safe place to vent.

I'd always try so hard to be the perfect girlfriend. I loved my boyfriend, Julien, more than anything. He was my world, my ONLY world, because I had no one else to care for me the way he did. My parents, they acted as if they were afraid of me. Never could I understand as to why, but it became apparent to me after a while that they didn't want much to with me. I mean, they immediately kicked me out after my 18th birthday. Though, now, I can so vividly see what they were avoiding. Knowing what I truly am, I should be ashamed. I should be terrified of being myself, living in the same body as the creature that forced those around me to hide.

As for Julien, I thought he was different than the others; my parents, my peers... everyone. I was wrong. Very, very wrong. He told me that he was going to take me on a surprise date. Of course, the foolish, head-over-heels in love gal I was, was excited. I blindly believed every little lie he spoke of.

When Julien and I arrived at the place, it didn't look or seem at all... pleasant; no where I wanted to be. It wasn't a restaurant, a movie theatre... it was just a large building that gave off a sense of lifelessness, completely void of happiness. In the distance, far off, but not too far, I could see a sign that read: "Hôpital Rivière-des-Prairies" (Prairie River Hospital). Then, that's when he stared into my eyes, his eyes watery, voice shaky.

"I'm so sorry."

Those were the last words I had heard from him in months. As you could probably guess, I was pissed. I was trapped inside of that sad, dreary building for almost an entire year. The longer I was there, the more I could feel the hideous creature slowly ripping through. The more it ripped through, the stronger the urge hungered me. Everyone would just pass it off as if I was dangerously mentally ill, but no; it wasn't me. No matter who I tried to tell, they would never believe me. I don't blame them, because years ago, I wouldn't have believed it either.

My head pounded, my body ached, my heart raced, my stomached growled, and my face became distorted and ugly. I wasn't me anymore. I was the humanoid of a pig. Similar to a werewolf, but a hideous disgusting pig who was once a normal woman.

Now, I stand here in front of Julien, realizing what I had done. I feel awful, but so good, too. He, and many others, are dead, because I held back for so long that I only hungered for more.

Mom and dad, if you're reading this, you were right to be scared. I am a monster.

I stop by McDonald's every day on my way to the bus.  Alejandro, the cashier, is so accustomed to seeing me that he knows my order by heart. I like the McGriddle with round eggs, cheese, bacon, and a medium coffee with sugar and cream, and I also order three small coffees for Carl, Samantha, and Robert. 

We four are the first passengers to board the bus every week, and over the past two years, none of us have ever missed the bus. However, two days ago, that all changed when Carl wasn't at his stop. The driver waited five minutes, but he never showed; instead, a 7-foot tall woman with smeared mascara,  oddly-shaped teeth, and arms that stretched down to her knees boarded. She wore a white and red polka dot dress with padded shoulders, and red high heels with broken straps. It was like looking at an individual who had just left the set of an '80s movie. Her appearance was oddly terrifying. 

She took a seat directly behind Samantha and smiled at her for an awkwardly long time. Her teeth, which I could clearly see now, were razor sharp. The very sight of them sent chills down my spine. You can tell her  presence made Samantha uncomfortable because she moved seats several times. However,  no matter how often she would move, that strange woman would relocate directly behind her. The next day the mysterious woman boarded the bus at Samantha's stop, but Samantha was nowhere to be found. She then sat straight behind Robert, and with the same bone-chilling glare, she began to smile at him. Robert wasn't at his stop the next day, but that mysterious lady was. It was only her and myself on the bus now, and I could feel her gaze piercing through the back of my neck. I was so terrified that at the first opportunity, I jumped off the bus and walked the rest of the way to work. The following day, I didn't leave my house. This woman became the subject of my universe. I felt her eyes on me even though she wasn't there. My once peaceful and routine life was now a living nightmare. 

Out of curiosity, I reached out to the families of Carl, Samantha, and Robert, and I was mortified to learn that they had been missing for quite some time now. I tried to tell them who was behind the disappearances, but no one believed me. I even gave a detailed witness statement to the police and described the woman in great detail, but according to everyone, she was just a figment of my imagination. 


After some time had passed, I started to accept that maybe I did conjure up this woman to help me cope with the disappearances of Robert, Samantha, and Carl. My life's slowly started to fall back into place; I even stopped at McDonald's to grab my usual order. However, I was saddened to learn that Alejandro no longer worked there. According to his coworker, he mysteriously disappeared one day, and no one has seen or heard from him in the past two weeks.  After learning about Alejandro, I decided to leave town and never return. Hopefully,  leaving town will keep me off her menu.

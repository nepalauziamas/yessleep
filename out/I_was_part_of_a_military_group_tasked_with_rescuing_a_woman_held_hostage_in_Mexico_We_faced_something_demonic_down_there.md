 It’s an old superstition amongst veterans that your last mission is the unluckiest. I believe it. When I reread the following excerpts from my journal it is evident. The completion of my most lucrative but bloodiest outing was uncanny. 

I have changed all the names. 

Most of you will refuse to believe my tale. *I* know what happened, and I need to share my story.

\*

I was digging a grave. The Sierra Nevada mountain range stretched on for endless miles in front of me. 

Creosote and sage brush scents dried my nose as a tall shadow appeared over the hole I dug. The unknown man had a gun in his left hand, but it was not pointed at me yet. 

“Marine Corps Sergeant Lawson,” the stranger said, “I’m Navy SEAL Commander Joseph Card. Pleased to meet you.” 

I dropped my shovel and squinted upwards. A Special Warfare insignia SEAL trident pin glimmered on the lapel of Card’s shirt.  

I wondered if I could disarm him. It was a tactical disadvantage that he was above ground while I was six feet under. There was no way of reversing roles in the fight, and I did not have intentions of making that ditch my place of burial.

“Not my name,” I said. I resumed my work and tightened the grip on the handle and dug the end of the shovel into the earth. 

“I know it is,” he said. “You’re the only one with that ink job.”

The tattoo he had referred to was on my right bicep and it read *Saint: A Dead Sinner Revised and Edited.* 

“If you’ll excuse me,” I said, “I have more holes to dig. People around here have to bury their loved ones. Tomorrow’s a busy day for the cemetery.”

“I need your service. I know your kill count. You’ve helped this country. They used to call you the spreader of death.”

I threw the shovel into the wall of muck and looked up at him while wiping sweat off my forehead. 

“I’m out of the service,” I said. “If I wanted to go on another mission I would have re-enlisted.”

“This isn’t for the government. I’m offering you a chance to do something good and make a fortune at the same time. Are you interested?”

“No.”

“You’re wasting talent. You were born to save people and stop threats.”

“This type of work is honorable,” I said as I pointed at the shovel. “It’s practical. I don’t kill, I honor the dead now.”

“It’s grueling, thankless and doesn’t pay. Come with me. Time is finite.”

Card bent down and extended his hand to help out.

“No,” I said. 

I grabbed the handle again and proceeded to dig. 

Card raised the gun. It was a tranquilizer device. I had seen the design before in Afghanistan. The barrel had a syringe spring out from the end of it along with a burst of brightness. A stinging sensation swelled on my neck. 

Dizziness overcame my vision as my eyelids grew heavy. I picked up the shovel and threw it at Card before he dodged it.

“You’ll thank me in four hours,” he said. 

Blackness covered the sky and swallowed my world.

\*

I woke up in a chair. Fatigue enveloped my body. My sight became clearer and I looked around. I was in front of a wooden table. Monochrome walls with expansive windows overlooked grassy plains. A wide theater sized screen was at the end of the air conditioned room.

Card moved towards where I sat and handed me a jug of blue Gatorade. I nodded at him in thanks, much too tired to show the malice I felt, and took a long gulp. 

“Don’t try to fight once you’re hydrated,” Card said. “I didn’t want to sedate you, but time is running out. Sit back and listen to the mission details. Remember, I’m trying to help you get rich.”

“Where am I?” 

“Westover Hills,” an older sounding man said. “Texas.”

I stared in the direction of the echoing and unfamiliar voice. It originated from an individual in a suit and tie who sat at the end of the slab. A diamond studded watch was on his wrist and he had a mop of slicked back grey hair. 

There were four other men around the table. They wore casual dress shirts and pants. Their tattoos and demeanor's gave them away as blue collar veterans. I could tell some were also not brought there by choice. 

“My name is Howard LaSalle,” the man said as he stood up and walked near the forefront of the table. “I know you’ve all had run ins with Mr. Card, so I’ll skip his introduction.”

The four of us looked at each other.

“*The* Howard LaSalle from *Forbes*?” one of the grunts said. “The *billionaire* Howard LaSalle?”

“That’s me. Pay attention to what Card has to say.”

Card cleared his throat while he stood in front of the screen, a remote control in his hand. 

“Welcome,” the SEAL said. “Everyone, meet our newest guest, Keith Lawson. He’s a valiant Marine Corps Sergeant. He's been on Special Operations in Afghanistan. He was part of Enduring Freedom and other classified missions.”

I never took compliments well. I nodded at the group around the table. 

“Also meet Josue Morales, an Army Ranger enlisted for many years. He hunted Noriega in the jungles of Panama as part of Operation Just Cause.”

Morales nodded. He looked younger than his actual age, but his stare reflected his time on the front-lines.

“Meet Anthony Dryden, someone who’s done work as a TF for years and has been a Combat Rescue Officer in the Air Force.”

Dryden wore a black and white Jack Daniel’s ball cap. He pulled out a can of wintergreen tobacco chew and placed the dip in the side of his mouth.

“Meet Matthew Haine. Haine began his military career as an EOD. He became a member of DEVGRU. He has participated in acts of counter terrorism.”

Haine had the look in his eyes of someone who wanted to get on with the details. 

“Mr. LaSalle’s daughter's kidnapped in Mexico,” Card said. “Her name is Victoria. She is a popular YouTube blogger.”

“Vlogger,” LaSalle said, “with a V.”

“Right,” Card said. “Her boyfriend Robert Lucas tagged along with her on their trip. Their goal was to film various locales down there. They were what the youth call urbex filmmakers. They were searching for an abandoned temple. According to lore, it is a place where the dead get re-hydrated and fed to snakes thirsty for blood. It's known in legend as the *Templo De Peuchen.* A place of ancient artifacts and dangerous creatures. I don’t think it exists, but they did. During their search, they bribed tourist guides to try and get to it. They ran into some lethal people called *Entre Los Escorpiones.* This translates to *Among the Scorpions*. They are one of the most vicious cartels in that region. This is their emblem.”

Card clicked a button on the device. The screen lit up behind him with an image of a gold ring resting on the back of a scorpion with a razor sharp stinger. 

Card clicked the device again, and a picture of a woman holding an AK-47 came up. She had hair black as a well of ink. She wore a sand colored bullet proof vest with another weapon slung over her shoulder.

“Their leader earned the nickname *Devorador de almas*, the Soul Devourer, pictured here. Her real name is Olesia Bacccarin. We have confirmed Lucas is dead. They are threatening to end Victoria’s life. They told Mr. LaSalle they would return his daughter for a price. They now want three billion dollars.”

“I have a lot of money,” LaSalle said while his eyes darkened, “but not that amount. So, you all are the help chosen to retrieve her. I picked each one of you for a very specific purpose. I went down to Xochimilco alone before deciding a trained team was necessary. I discovered film in a cave Lucas hid in before capture.”

Card turned around and began playing the found footage. 

\*

Victoria and Robert laughed in the first scene. They walked down the lanes of Mercado Merced and Mercado Sonora. They went into street markets in Mexico between rows of flea shop stands. 

They went into an Occult bazaar with mason jars, voodoo dolls, spirit boards and candles. A man wearing robes and rings on every finger gazed up at them as they entered.

“Where can we find the *Templo de Peuchen*?” Robert asked. 

The shaman gave them directions to an outer borough of Mexico City. 

The two took a river boat. The famous island of dolls were there. The miniature mannequins hung in the trees. Their burnt plastic bodies were beneath a wooden sign. Spray painted words designated the area as off-limits. 

A jump cut in the film occurred. 

They stood at the mouth of a cave.

A scream erupted. It was Victoria’s. A gun’s muzzle showed up on the right hand side of the camera view, and a black gloved hand wrapped around Robert’s throat. 

The camera fell to the ground and the screen went black.

\*

Card clicked again. A photograph of a large mansion made of clay surrounded by fertile green land came up.

“This is our target,” Card said. “We infiltrate, take out any threats, and question for more info. Baccarin’s group resides here when they’re not taking hostages or invading villages. Someone inside knows Victoria’s location. We can be there by tomorrow. Let’s eat, drink, and rest tonight. We save her life after sun up.” 

“Two million dollars each if you bring Victoria back alive,” LaSalle said. “The chopper you’ll be traveling in has anti-radar.”

A picture of Victoria LaSalle came up on the screen. She was twenty two years old.

I looked at the image of the young woman. I thought of her callow worldview. Her inherent trust of people and the on-line gold rush of fame led to her kidnapping. I still believed that the situation she was in was undeserving. 

Despite how much I disliked the way Card drafted me, I felt I still had to help. 

If it was only in remembrance of the girl’s spirit by exacting revenge, it would be worth it. 

“We leave tomorrow morning,” Card said. “Your lodging for the night is down the hall.”

“What kind of gear are we getting?” Morales asked.

“You’ll see.” 

We left the board room. 

“I know the Devorador de almos,” Morales said. We walked down a hallway with windows which overlooked a golf course. 

Morales looked straight ahead. His eyes seemed to peer on into forever before he continued. “She has killed some of my family. I can’t wait to squeeze life out of her.”

\*

Stepping onto the four bladed, Navy style Black Hawk chopper made me feel at home. It sat on a black and yellow painted helipad built onto a piece of land owned by LaSalle.

The smell of sweat and exhaust bombarded us when we went into the chopper. The pilot ignored us and focused on the controls of the dashboard. 

My boots landed on the floor’s ringlets and pipes locked for stretchers and extra seats. I buckled up. The open back cargo area held our weaponry. 

We were all carrying USB .45 Tactical handguns with threaded barrels and suppressors. Our primary weapon of choice was the M14 SOCOM or AK-47 T’s. In the incident of a firefight, we would be able to reload by stripping the combatant’s bodies of ammunition. It was the same as what the cartel carried. Our body armor was Class III A plates made of carbon fiber. Bow Fang radio’s were on our belts alongside our holsters. We carried four grenades each. I had a WWII era Ka-Bar. Some of the others carried SOG Seal Pup blades and bench made knives. 

In the back of the chopper were six old Soviet Rocket Propelled Grenade launchers. There were also mounts, multi-tools, and attachable advanced optical combat gun sights (ACOGS). I donned bracers which kept my blades secure and within easy reach beneath the long sleeves of my top. 

It took less than a minute for the black hawk to enter the air. 

The plains below were specks. The houses resembled motionless ants. Some of us were still assembling our guns as we drifted in the atmosphere.

“We are going to scout the mansion,” Card said. “We do recon after stalking the premises. If we find the target, we take her in for questioning. Remember how this is a rescue mission. We neutralize threats only when left with no other choice.”

I looked over at Morales. He pulled out a key chain and stared at it. It had a scorpion frozen in a block of amber attached to the metal pieces. 

I kept my head down as we passed the outlines of cathedrals, colleges, and museums in Mexico City. Their earthen-tinged buildings reflected the clouds and sunlight. There were estates the size of city blocks surrounded by gates below.

We kept ourselves fed with protein bars and water as we neared a stretch of land filled with rivers. The landscape resembled a labyrinth of cracked dirt a child had spilled a bucket of water over.

The black hawk landed on a hillside facing a field of legumes and different varieties of grass. 

Card ordered us off, and we began running along the mound. We marched for half a mile before the mansion came into view.

Elevated walls with marble slats formed a canopy above a terrace and swimming pool. Black framed windows and roof gardens held verdant plant life. 

Guapilla shrubberies lined the outskirts of two different courtyards. One was in the front and back. Both had white and pink tiles which looked as though they had been dug out from a Holy structure and brought there. Beige beams and silver railings encircled a dark wooden spiral staircase. This was visible from where we were because of the absence of glass. 

A statue stood next to the swimming pool. It looked like Lady Justice. Instead of scales she held a snake in one hand and a severed head in the other.

“Do you know what that statue is?” I asked Morales.

“The dope god Olokun,” he said. “She is always carried by the cartel.” 

“Get down,” Card said. 

We laid flat on our stomachs and took cover behind a row of bushes. We peered through the sights of our sniper rifles. Card pulled out a pair of infrared binoculars. 

“Lots of Scorpions there,” he said. “Remember, the less engagement the better. We’ll wait here all night for Olesia if we have to.”

I looked out at the rear courtyard. Two men walked. One was a Scorpion. His uniform was normal for the group. He had on beige khaki’s, a tactical overcoat and an AK-47. He was pointing his weapon at the second man, who was in his seventies. 

The old man’s hands were behind his back as the Scorpion prodded him along. He kicked the hostage in the back of the knees. The elder dropped, and the Scorpion aimed the rifle at his head.

The Scorpion hit the old man with the butt of the weapon and made him squirm.

I aimed at the Scorpion’s kill zone. I squeezed the trigger. 

A crimson trail floated from the hostile as he fell to the ground. 

Shouting flared up. Seven Scorpions flooded out of the estate. 

Dryden picked off two of them in a matter of seconds as I shot another. 

“Circle the perimeter,” Card yelled. “Morales, stay on Lawson’s six and take the right. Dryden, take the front courtyard and stick with Haine. I’ll get around to the back and start clearing the house. We don’t want them calling reinforcements.”

We sprinted towards the mansion. 

A member fired shots at us as we took cover behind a marble block behind potted plants. Bullets chewed through the stone as I returned fire. 

Morales unsheathed his SOG blade, stood up when the fire had ceased, and threw it. The knife landed in the enemy’s eyes. His body tumbled back as he continued to unleash a spray of lead everywhere. The back of his skull cracked open with the impact of the fall. 

“Advance,” Morales shouted.

We moved further up to an overhang supported by clay beams. 

A member fired shots at us from the inside. Morales was thrust backwards in the air. 

I squeezed the trigger at the opening. I whipped around and scanned the area for advancing movements. 

“Are you okay?” I asked.

“I’m fine,” Morales said while standing up. The bullet must have hurt, but his vest protected him.

We trailed along the western side of the house. We glanced around the corner to see Haine evade a chucked molotov before it burst. 

Haine shot the man who had tried to kill him. The smell of fuel was pungent in the air as his combatant’s lifeless form buckled.

Haine kicked in the door and entered the place. We followed behind him, our guns at the ready. 

The main foyer had a large spiral staircase and an open area which resembled a hotel lobby. 

Three waited for us. Haine’s armor got hit as he executed the first attacker. Morales took out the secondary. 

The third unloaded a round at us as I shot him in the arm. His gun dropped and he fell to the tile. He unsheathed a hatchet, stood up and ran towards me with a wail. I gave him two rounds to the neck before he went limp and face-planted. 

Card’s voice rang out: “Grenade!”

We went to the ground and covered our ears. An explosion rocked the eastern side of the mansion. Debris showered us. We concealed our faces from the cloud of destruction as best we could.

Card came down from the blitzed staircase, dragging two bodies with him. He threw them down to our level as he leapt over the railing. Dust and gore blanketed him. 

“Take what they have and reload,” he said. “It’s clear from the bottom up. We have the basement left to search. Go.”

Our Commander pointed at an oak wooden door swung open in the far left corner. 

I was in the front of the group. I turned on the flashlight attached to my scope. I descended a rickety old staircase to the subterranean part of the narco-mansion. Card was closest to my side with the others following. 

We entered a baroque style wine cellar. Copper plates hung on the walls. Shelves with carved drawings on their oak held long rows of bottles. 

A Scorpion jumped out from behind a wood barrel. I grabbed his arm and broke his wrist and slammed my hand into his solar plexus. He doubled over and I gave him a knee to the face. I grabbed the back of his head, swept his feet out from under him and placed him in a rear naked choke.

Card tapped me on the shoulder. 

“Don’t kill him,” he said. “Let him go. He might have some answers we need. He’s the only one left alive.”

I released him and stood up. 

Card had Morales translate his questions into Spanish. 

“Where is the Soul Devourer? Where is Victoria LaSalle?”

The Scorpion spat on Card. 

Card pulled out his handgun and shot the man in the left knee. 

“Tell him that he’ll be wheelchair bound for the rest of his life unless he starts talking,” Card said to Morales. 

The man began crying as Morales repeated the words.

“He says that there is a map leading to where they are,” Morales said. “The *Templo de Peuchen*. It’s in the head of the Olokun statue near the pool.” 

“Retrieve it,” Card said after facing me. “Dryden, you go with him.”

I went up the basement steps and out towards the pool. I passed piles of bodies. At least twenty Scorpions lay dead. A fire was burning the ground on the other side of the mansion from the thrown molotov. The old man who was a former hostage of the first Scorpion I shot at was lying down, bleeding but alive. 

I cut the restraints binding his wrists. I gave him an MRE and advised him to go home. He thanked me and went into the desert.

I approached the Olokun statue. I drove my Ka-Bar into the head she held. I slipped my black gloves on. I dug my fingers into the hollow interior and pulled out a thick piece of brown parchment covered in grime. 

Morales stared at the map after Card grabbed it. He unfolded it on the surface of a table in the cellar.

We let the Scorpion go after Dryden administered aid to him in the form of a tourniquet. We gave him a fractured beam to use as a walking stick. I helped him up the stairs and brought him to the edge of the property. We made sure he did not have a cell phone or radio. I wished him good luck as he hobbled away. I knew the environment, coupled with the severity of his injuries, was going to take his life. 

“This does point to the *Templo de Peuchen*,” Morales said. “That can’t be right. The temple is a myth. It’s a place destroyed during a war between rival Mayan kingdoms in the fifth century.”

“We’re about to see if it’s real or not,” I said. I reloaded my AK-47.

\*

We sat in the back of the black hawk, flying through the air in a direction using the map's coordinates.

Morales took off his vest and revealed bruising around his ribs. I gave him my vest since his got damaged. I went into the back and retrieved a new one

“Your tattoo,” Morales said. “Who wrote it?”

“Ambrose Bierce,” I said. “It’s the definition of a saint from his book *The Devil’s Dictionary*.”

“What does it do for you?”

“It reminds me how nobody’s perfect. Keeps me from self-loathing.”

“Thanks for what you did back there,” Morales said.

“What you did back there was hot headed,” Card said. “Good job to the rest of the team for dealing with the jarhead’s mistake.”

I took the criticism, aware the firefight started with me trying to do the fair thing in saving an old man’s life.

“Straight on,” the pilot shouted. 

We stared.

“It can’t be…” Morales said. 

A moss covered pyramid made of old stones came into view on the horizon. 

It was the ancient building seen in countless historic drawings. I thought of human sacrifices painted blue and brought to the top. My mind could not escape the image of their hearts eaten by a predatory god. 

The sun lowered. The black hawk landed on a neighboring hill covered in grass. 

We jumped out and took position on a precipice. We crouched and stared through our sights and night vision binoculars. 

“Oh my God,” Dryden said as he squinted through his ACOG. “Are you seeing this?”

There was a campfire, tents, and bodies in the distance. The corpses looked starved. They in rows, as if they were about to be burnt or buried. They all wore the Scorpion uniform. 

A figure walked past them. 

I recognized her.

“I’ve found Olesia,” I said. 

“We take her alive,” Card said as he pulled out the same tranquilizer gun he had used on me a day and a half ago. “She knows where Victoria is. Is anyone else with her?”

“The dead,” Dryden said. 

“We’re heading in,” Card said. “Maintain concealment.”

We approached the pyramid. The sounds of rattling snakes and the smell of rotting flesh wafted towards us with each step.

We crouched low in the bushes within fifteen feet of the Soul Devourer. 

A hatchet flew by my head. A net wrapped around my body.

Card pulled out his gun and fired.

A masked Scorpion ran near me, and while I wanted to shoot, the net constricted my body and I could not lift my weapon. He hit me upside the head with the butt of his AK. I lost consciousness. 

\*

I woke up. Everything came into focus like an image in a microscope. 

I heard arguing in Spanish. 

Looking over with my wrists tied in vines, I saw Morales hung upside down from a palm tree. Right by his side were Dryden and Card bound in the same way.  Most of our gear was gone. I felt my knives were still intact, but there was no way of using them. 

Olesia smiled at us as a campfire's flames roared behind her. 

Next to Olesia was a folded out briefcase lined with hacksaws, rods, pliers and needles. 

“Where is Victoria?” I yelled at her.

The Soul Devourer laughed and walked towards me. She reached out and grabbed my jaw. She leaned in close enough to kiss me. 

“They’re inside,” she said, pointing to the mouth of the pyramid. “See all those bodies?”

She gestured to the men drained of blood. Olesia pulled what looked like the front of a human skull, with two bands near the back. It resembled a *Dio de los meurtos* fashion item. Leathery snake skin wrapped around the bone matter.

“Victoria’s lover is the one responsible for this,” Olesia said. “We didn’t kill him for sport, we did it for vengeance. Do you even know what the *Peuchens* are, gringo? Shape shifters. Creatures able to take different forms. The boy wandered around the temple one night when we fell asleep after he tried to escape. He found the mask, one we knew as sacred, but his ignorance cost him and us everything. He decided to put it on and he resurrected them. Victoria is about to become a feast for the Peuchens. My men were as well after her foolish boyfriend fell victim to his own curiosity. You are soon to be, also.”

“*Eres una perra tonta*,” Morales said.

“*Pinche perro*,” she said after walking towards him. “You’ll be the first one I torture.”

Morales brought his hands down. A knife slid from one of his bracers. He cut the vines which imprisoned him.

He dug the knife into Olesia’s forehead.

She slumped to the earth. He bent upwards and cut the bindings on his feet before landing on his back. 

The same guard who had knocked me out unleashed a spurt of bullets at the escaped Ranger, who pivoted to the side. 

Morales grabbed a Beretta off Olesia’s belt and ended the Scorpion's life with a shot to the chest. 

He cut the rest of his team members down from the bindings. Card had a black eye, Dryden had a scrape on his forehead, and Haine looked exhausted. 

We retrieved our gear from their tents and put on our combat attire again. 

“You heard her,” Card said as he motioned to the mouth of the pyramid. “Victoria’s in there. Let’s go.”

“What about the Peuchens?” Dryden asked. “You know, the shape shifters brought back to life?”

“You believe in old wives tales?” Card asked. “Olesia was trying to scare us.”

Dryden stared at the SEAL. “I don’t see how these men could have had blood removed from their bodies, sir. It doesn’t add up.”

“Not our problem,” Card said. “Focus on the goal at hand. We’ve all seen worse and you know it. Let’s go in.”

Dryden nodded, and we went into the temple. 

*

There was a long corridor with a floor made of stone blocks. The first few walls were heaps of ancient mortar. Once we were in a larger area with hung torches which lit the way, we walked on hollow ground.

The Mayan interior had stucco friezes. Depictions of human figures lined the barriers. They had elaborate bird headdresses, jade jewels, and each one sat cross legged. Ceramic vessels were on the shelves against the walls. Glyph's of goddesses with snake heads and other deified rulers of an age long gone greeted us. 

We went into another chamber. A wooden funerary mask with emerald beaded teeth hung in the center and gazed down at us in warning. 

In the next hall, there were holes in the ceiling. Fluorescence from the moon and stars pierced through them as beams.  Obelisks lined up like an Aztec Stonehenge. 

Victoria was in the middle of the room. She wore a white top and black cargo pants given to her by the cartel caked in blood. She was staring at the ceiling and looked at me as I approached.

She was bound to one of the pillars. I cut the ropes.

“Your father sent us to save you,” Card said.

“They…” she said.

“Who’s they?” Morales asked.

“They’re coming for us.”

The sound of hissing filled the room. Something moved to my left. 

When I turned with my gun aimed, I saw Dryden lifted off his feet and carried towards the ceiling. His form floated through the beams of light. He screamed, released a few shots, and vanished. 

The remaining four of us pointed our guns up.

Dryden fell back down to the ground. He was pale, thin, and devoid of blood, like the men who were out front. His breathing had ceased.

The thing swooped down. It was a serpent the size of a battering ram used to tear down doors on medieval castles. Two black leather wings outstretched on either side. The wings had sharp tips laced through it like sticks used to hold a kite together. 

Card pulled out his knife and slashed at the monster. The stringy and fibrous gliding implements tore. Blood spurted from it onto his clothes. 

Haine came up from behind and tried to climb onto its back, but its body was too slick. 

I ran up to Haine. I climbed onto his shoulders and leapt onto the creature’s back.

I yelled out a battle cry and emptied a clip into the Peuchen’s head after pointing the gun straight down. It fell forward like a slinky. I landed on my side and slid from its flesh.

Card grabbed Victoria’s hand, and ran towards the entrance-way after motioning for us to do the same. 

We followed at a sprint. One of the beasts slithered out of the shadows as fast as a vehicle going full speed. Its body writhed with serpentine movements towards us. Its wings folded onto its form with tightening muscles. Its body locked up to spring at us as grotesque noises echoed in the chamber. 

Card pulled the pin on his grenade and threw it into the creature’s mouth. 

It exploded in a cloud of entrails as we continued running. 

Another Peuchen followed behind it. 

As the third one neared us, it began to change its own form, mutating. I was not eager to find out what shape it would take next. I lobbed a grenade behind me as we went outside. 

The creature’s head made it to the threshold of the mouth of the pyramid. 

Morales turned around and began shooting at the eyes. The creature’s tongue lashed out and hit him in the knees, and its gaze burrowed into him.

Morales’ gun dropped as his body froze and began seeping out blood in front of me. The red fluid soaked into the earth and gushed towards the fangs of the monster. 

I lobbed more grenades until my belt was empty. I reached for Morales’ belt and retrieved his key chain and another bomb. I threw it at the Peuchen.

We ran over the row of dead Scorpions. Victoria tripped over Olesia’s body. I helped pick her up, and we continued to run. 

The base of the pyramid was the first to get wiped out by the blasts. The rest fell as if a hurricane had wreaked havoc. The stones tumbled down onto the creature’s body, halting its advance. Morales got buried with it in a maelstrom of fragmented rock.

We ran up the hill and jumped into the black hawk. It was two minutes before Victoria was secure in a chair and we lifted off the ground. 

As we ascended, I looked down and saw more slithering forms. I wished I could go back and retrieve Morales and Dryden to give them the proper burials they deserved.

I grabbed an RPG from the back, leveled it, took in a deep breath and fired a missile at both of the snakes. The targets evaporated in flames. The palm trees, bodies and blocks of granite became engulfed in an inferno below. The blaze and debris rose as an angry storm before it all collapsed back down. 

“The mission was successful,” Card said. “We did it. Good job, men.”

We remained silent for hours after as the desert landscape passed beneath us. The key chain Morales had kept stared back at me. The scorpion frozen in amber. I decided to pocket it as a keepsake, a remembrance of the man who served by my side. 

We were soon over the border and back into the United States. 

“My Dad sent you?” Victoria asked.

We all nodded.

“Olesia told me my father’s been funding money for rival cartels in this region,” Victoria said. She stared out at the night sky before she continued: “He’s involved in arms deals down here for terrible people. He always told me his money came from oil. He lied. They didn’t take me hostage with the hopes of making money, they did it to torment him.”

None of us said a word. 

Victoria reached into one of the side pockets of her cargo pants and pulled out the Mayan skull mask. The very object which had caused the rift between what we recognized as real and the unknown. The item which had allowed those beasts to escape from their world of sleep, their nests. 

“This made me feel alive when I was wearing it,” Victoria said. “It made Lucas feel amazing, too. It brings out a sense of godliness. Have the three of you ever felt anything like that?”

I pulled out my .45 and shot the mask. 

A fog filled the inside of the chopper, emanating from the remaining pieces which rained down on us. I kicked what landed on the ground out of the compartment to the nether sands.

Howard LaSalle’s mansion came into view as Victoria screamed at us. 

END

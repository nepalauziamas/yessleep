“My tea was cold, I received no turndown service, and the girl down the hall was very rude to me.”

I looked up from my desk to the man with hands tucked into his skinny jeans as he glared at me over Gucci sunglasses.

“You hung the ‘Privacy Please’ sign on your door, ordered iced tea, and told the girl that her ‘art sucked more than a hungry litter of newborn kittens.’ That was an exact quote.” I frowned.

The man scowled. “I expect better treatment at your price point. I can afford the Hilton, but I came here for the ambiance, and that girl ruined it.”

I moved aside a glass of water, pushed away the paperwork, stood, and folded my arms. Over the years, I’ve come to recognize when certain guests are going to spend half the day demanding all of my attention. “The girl is also a guest. I have no control over her behavior.”

Skinny Jeans folded his arms and leaned forward. “Maybe you’re not trying hard enough.”

The hair on the back of my neck stood up. “She’s six years old. You made her cry.”

“You can’t coddle children. It turns them into snowflakes.” He looked around the living room that also served as my office. “I should have gone with the Hilton. Everyone raves about that stupid garden you use to feed the guests, but your breakfast was blasé at best. This is just a shitty house, and it’s much smaller than my own, which is very large.”

The chill ran through my neck again, like something was breathing just behind me. The curtains tickled my cheek despite the absence of any breeze. “Sir, you’re at a bed and breakfast. The whole point is that you’re staying in my house.”

He grunted and stared at my painting of the Pequod above the mantel. “I shouldn’t have listened to the online reviews. This house would be much nicer if you got rid of the shitty art and furniture.”

The chill ran past my neck, into my back, through my chest, and out of my stomach, leaving me lukewarm inside. “Sir, please don’t insult the house. It’s one of the oldest continuously inhabited residences in Massachusetts, and-”

“-and no one cared about it enough to make improvements since 1850.” He chuckled. “It’s not your fault, some people are born without taste.”

The glass of water tipped over, spilling across the day’s paperwork. My stomach dropped. “Sir, I’m a very open-minded person, but the one policy upon which I must insist is that you do not insult the Watcher-”

“Who came up with such a stupid name for a house?” he snapped.

His sunglasses fell to the floor and cracked in two.

“What the *fuck*? Those were worth $3,000, you bitch!”

“I didn’t touch them,” I answered in a tone of forced control. “As I explained upon arrival, the only rule we have is that you not insult the house-”

“How do you expect me not to insult something that sucks?” he spat as he slammed his boots against the broken glasses. “I’m the smartest person in the room, and you know it. I have clients who practically run the State of Connecticut, and they’ll have this place shut down.”

“Sir, this isn’t Connecticut-”

“I’m going to pack my things. I won’t be staying another night.”

The lukewarm streak in my stomach turned fiery as the room got warmer. “Sir,” I whispered, “please just leave this house immediately and I will refund your visit.”

He looked down at me with a victorious smile. “It’s too late to apologize.” He shook his head, never breaking eye contact with me. “You have a pleasing frame, and probably could change my mind if you were forty years younger. But you just have to accept the fact that you’re not as hot as you once were.” Skinny Jeans turned around, crossed the room, and climbed the stairs to the second floor.

The heat left my stomach as papers on my desk fluttered, and the door slammed behind him without being touched. Nausea gripped my gut as I collapsed into my chair, panting. I rested my forehead in my open palms, my entire body shaking.

“Fuck.”

Nineteen minutes later, I’d climbed the thirteen steps to the second floor. My hands trembled as I walked down the narrow hallway, eyeing the final door on my left. Was it safe to check?

Of course not. But it never would be.

I struggled to twist the knob as my sweaty palms slipped across metal. It took three attempts to open the door. I prayed that it wouldn’t be a terrible sight.

It was a terrible sight. A coppery smell hit me before anything else, and I couldn’t force myself not to stare at the carnage.

“How did so much blood get on the ceiling?” I whispered. 

The bed sheets fluttered, followed by curtains near where I stood. Then my stomach went from hot to lukewarm to cold to hot again as my arms turned frigid. I gasped and stepped back, suddenly very afraid. 

“I’m not complaining,” I announced to the room. “I – I’ll clean it up.” 

Taking a tentative step over a rogue eyeball, I lifted what had once been Skinny Jean’s arm. It felt uncannily like an oversized turkey leg from the Renaissance Fair. 

“You know me,” I explained to the ostensibly empty room, “I always look on the bright side. He’ll be enough to fertilize the whole garden, and that keeps our guests coming back [year after year](https://www.facebook.com/P-F-McGrail-181784199029462/).”

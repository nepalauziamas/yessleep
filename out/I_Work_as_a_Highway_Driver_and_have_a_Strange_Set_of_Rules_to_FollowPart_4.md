Sorry for the long absence, fell into a coma while on the job and couldn't write. Maybe I'll tell you all about it another day.

I'm a highway driver, and I have strict guideline to follow for the sake of my survival on the road. If you're new, I'd recommend reading the [previous part.](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/qied89/i_work_as_a_highway_driver_and_have_a_strange_set/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share)

"Holy shit!" I scream, swerving to the left to avoid the figure. In my attempt to avoid what was possibly a mere ghost, I ended up crashing straight into the concrete barrier and was smacked in the face by the hardened airbag which had never seen use until now. At this point, I was knocked out for a good minute or two.

I woke up in a daze, inhaling the smoke rising from the busted engine. Cutting the airbag which had been obscuring my vision with a shard of plexiglass, I realised there were figures now surrounding the vehicle. Upon further inspection, they resembled members of my family, my friends, and my... dog? My brain still foggy, I wasn't able to tell if it was a dream or not. Hell, at this point, I probably forgot I was even a highway driver. I urgently tried getting out of the car to no avail, since the doors wouldn't budge.

My crush from high school walked out from the fog created by the smoke of the patrol car, now moving towards me. I was flabbergasted. She then lunged at the car, emitting a screech akin to a fox. That alone snapped me back to reality, and I now realised how truly f&&ked I was. With the figures now completely surrounding the vehicle scraping the body of the car with their nails, I radioed management.

"Frogsman-1 to CC, I'm at 66 kilometres and I'm surrounded-" I stuttered near asphyxiation, until I was interrupted by the near instatenous reply. "Understood, Ashura team's on their way," the voice across said, clearly aware of my predicament.

Aside from the screeching, I could hear a growing whirring of a helicopter. Out of a sudden, the thunderous roar of heavy gunshots rang out and the figures which once surrounded the car turned into a red paintjob on the vehicle. I could remember wetting my pants in absolute shock from the recent sights. From the busted sunroof, I saw three men repelling from the hovering helicopter clad in black armour, 'HSA Extermination Division' printed on the back of their vests. Seeing the wounds on my glass-filled arms, they got me out of the vehicle and repelled back into the helicopter. Looking down from above, I caught a glimpse of another patrol vehicle coming out from the concrete wall beside the highway, now passing by the flaming car. Unbeknowst to me, that was the replacement officer finishing my shift.

The moment they laid me down on the floor of the helicopter, one of the men tended to my wounds. At this point, I could barely feel a thing with the amount of adrenaline flowing through my veins. Looking at the badge on the guys arm, it read "Ashura's Legion", with the phrase 'Strike like Demons, with God's Will' encircling the title. I couldn't care less, really, considering I was bleeding out. What happened after was hazy. Straight after the medic injected me with a needle, I knocked out like a baby.

Now awake on a hospital bed, one of the Ashura operatives along with whom I presume was a doctor was in the room with me. The doctor immediately went outside once he saw me sitting up and the other guy spoke to me. I'm gonna spare the details, but he was a member of the HSA Extermination Divison assigned to Hawk-2, codenamed Ashura's Legion. My situation was dire enough that they had to send in what is presumably the special forces to save my sorry ass and send in a replacement driver. As it turns out, due to my condition where I was incapable of delving further into the highway, another driver was needed to ensure my shift was finished. If it wasn't, all hell would've broke loose. And knowing the hellish occurrences here, I sure as hell didn't want that to happen.

More info on the Hawk-2 squad:
"HSA Extermination Division
Hawk-2, designated "Ashura's Legion"
Motto:"Strike like Demons, with God's Will"
Manpower:2 teams, 6 members each
Additional info: Formed after the complete annihilation of Hawk-1..."
And that's all I can share.

After staying in the ward for a few days(my wounds weren't so bad), I immediately went back on shift. I was lucky enough not to undergo an exorcism- my predecessors weren't so lucky. During my stay, I heard stories from the other injured drivers in the ward who were brought in from other highways across the country(the agency has a central medical centre), one of them having served for about a decade. His name was Teo, probably the most experienced in the room.

There's a well-known story spread among the HSA drivers and subsequently the rookies. Hell, it's probably not a story anymore but rather a true event considering how things are here. A few years ago, one of Teo's colleagues, a newbie to the job, had a malicious encounter with the voices one would encounter near the start of their shift. These voices, though friendly at first glance, were selective in who they wanted to interact with. The guy was no exception. Though, this time, they had ill intentions. The guy was repeatedly mocked and verbally harassed by them through the course of an entire kilometer and that alone was capable of breaking him. The devilish laughters that erupted within the confines of the car would constantly replay in his head even to this very day. Nobody knows why, but these supernatural entities seem to leave their prints on anyone who dare tread the roads, their effects lingering on for god knows how long. HQ immediately knew something was off with him when he wouldn't respond to any of their callouts, so they forced him out of his shift and sent in a replacement soon after. The details were a bit barren, but it's stated that he had to be exorcised by priests of the three major religions hired by the HSA.

The entire time I was hearing whatever came out of Teo's mouth, I believed every single bit of it with no hesitation. Teo had his own personal, crazy experience- one that landed him in the ward at that point of time. Turns out, he was from the branch in charge of surveying the Golden Gate bridge, not necessarily a highway, but in this jobscope, anything's possible. Though his shift was miles shorter in comparison to mine, the amount of anomalous events were significantly larger than what I would encounter. Imagine this- I had to get through 100km facing about... 50? events throughout the shift. Teo on the other hand had to get travel about 3km while facing about a thousand events happening simultaneously. His shifts happen irregularly, about once a year but when they come, the HSA make immense preperations to ensure whatever they face won't get any driver killed within a few minutes. I heard the patrol vehicle he's equipped with is a high-tech APC, carrying a full team of HSA Extermination Division agents and fully-loaded heavy armament, each manned by an agent. Teo was technically just a driver for them.

His shift which happened a week ago costed him his left leg and left him partially deaf in his left ear. Good thing I was on his right side in the ward, if not I would've gone crazy. Treading through the bridge, he had to fend off swarms of entities which, as he said in his own words,"came from the pits of hell". Teo's APC, almost mangled and a literal hole on the right side of the driver's cockpit, managed to get through most of the entities. However, there's always a surprise on the job and one of them was a meet and greet with Death himself, just barely missing what would've been a fatal job injury. A titan-sized entity came out from the ocean and stomped its foot on the APC, though Teo was swift enough to evade it. Unfortunately a section of the APC was hit, the back of it smashed, compacted into a rubbish cube. The personnel at the back were crushed into a pile of red, oozy sludge that made Teo sick to his very core. Out of the seven in the team, only two of them made it out alive, Teo being one of them obviously. They somehow skimmed their way to the end and finished the shift, no idea how they didn't get slained by the shitload of entities.

The rest of the stories seemed boring to me, so I just slept through most of them. Heard him mention about the janitor, but I was dozing off by then. Once I was fully healed up, I instantly got back on shift. As dire as my situation was, money was the only thing I could chase. Heading into my second shift, maybe I'll finally conquer my fears of this damn highway, seeing what lied ahead the 75+km mark which I never got to see.

There I was, minding my own business, eating a red delicious apple—which I’d plucked from the apple tree in my backyard—when the skies suddenly darkened, and the air grew chill. This preternaturally swift atmospheric shift was then followed, alarmingly, by the trembling of the earth beneath my feet; before I could rise from my seated position, the ground heaved, and I was thrown backwards; nearly cracking my skull on a loosened stone.  

I regained a sense of orientation just in time to see the earth before me split open, and several tiny objects begin to emerge. Errant lightning strikes illumined the black sky, and air-shaking thunderclaps followed in their wake. The things poking through the earth soon revealed themselves to be hands, the fingers wriggling evilly the brief flashes of light. I scrambled to my feet, horrified, and looked back toward my home; but somehow, impossibly, it was *gone*—had been utterly and totally stripped from the land; leaving little more than impressions of the foundation in the earth. 

Turning back toward the land-piercing appendages, I found myself facing three pallid figures—all in varied states of physical ruin. The one on the left was—or had been—a brunette woman, one of an almost brutish physique; her figure suggestive of a life that had been dedicated not just to fitness, but the frequent lifting of extraordinary weight. The figure on the right was, in a word, hideous; a monstrously trifold being, thrice-born or triply grafted together; a mockery of human morphology. Two white-haired heads jutted horrifically from each shoulder, whilst the central head—short-cut and blonde—extended not from the neck, but dorsally from the back; drooping forward from an elongated neck. The faces of the two shoulder-resting heads were frozen in expressions of death-captured agony, yet the centermost head leaned languidly; as if content with the paradoxical—and assuredly excruciating—anatomy.  

The bald woman in the middle, despite being the most normal and least decomposed of the trio, frightened me the most; and filled my heart with a black, sinking terror. She stood proudly between the two corpses, and her own aspects of rot and decay seemed almost regal in comparison; more like deathly embellishing than signs of necrotic ruin. All of them were naked, their private members exposed freely, and despite even this, there was an air of pride about her nudity; as if she’d forgo wearing clothing even if offered. Her eyes, black pits from which an aura of infinite night seemed emanate, immediately found my own and held them in a transfixing gaze. With a dagger-sharp, dirt-covered nail she pointed at me, and the corpse bearing the physique of a power-lifter took a step; its fists balled.  

Frozen, cryptically spellbound by the grave-risen sorceress, I could only watch helplessly as the sable-haired warrior-woman stomped toward me, thick, sludgy sheets of earth and slime falling from her worm-eaten frame with each step. My terror climaxed; the horror of her ultra-decayed appearance too insupportable. Suddenly galvanized by my tremendous fright, I broke free of the rot-witch's spell, and scrambled back; not wanting to physically engage with the advancing foe. But upon risking a backwards glance, I saw that the area had been enclosed in a torrential funnel sometime during my ensnarement; a land-ravaging maelstrom of Stygian shadows contained us; earthly debris and darkness itself whirled chaotically amidst the revolving walls.  

I knew then that I had no choice but to fight, to somehow battle the necromantically risen monstrosities before me.  

Thinking quickly on my feet, I scooped up the stone I’d nearly tripped on earlier, and before the fiend could guess at my intentions, swung it with all my mortal might. The stone—about the size of a Rubic's cube—struck the thing in its head; and in a moment of appalling grotesqueness, the head imploded; sagging inward from the force of the blow. A rush of putrid air escaped through the zombie’s flared nostrils, and yet despite the unwholesome deflation, the thing still continued on; unphased by the damage dealt to its rotted cranium.  

My shock-addled brain didn’t recover from the grisly sight fast enough, and the zombie seized me by the throat before I could think to attack again. Its wretched fingers, impossibly strong—considering its condition—tightened around my neck, and a tinge of crimson was added to the dismal atmosphere as my vision strained. As if in mockery of my suffocation, it exhaled, and a hot wave of miasmal funk struck me in the face; burning my eyes and nostrils.  

A faint glimmer of excitement seemed to fill the zombie’s sallow eyes, and I mentally sank inward at the sight of such murderous glee; but I remained on my feet and continued to grapple with the figure, desperately trying unhinge its savage claws from my throat.  

Providentially, a bolt of lightning then struck the ground a few feet away, and it might as well have been a detonation of TNT. We were both thrown several feet away in the subsequent explosion. Dazed, pained, and too terrified to quantify, I rolled around, hoping to extinguish any flames that might’ve coated my body. But nothing had been set alight; I was, miraculously, unharmed, devoid of even the slightest burn. Somewhere, in the depths of my rattled mind, I thought to myself, "*An apple a day...."*

The same could not be said for the zombie. It had perhaps taken the brunt of the bolt’s fury. Its body was almost completely alight with flame, the flesh blackening with each second as the fire fed hungrily on the widespread necrosis. And yet somehow, against reason and all things good, the thing rose, it’s whole body aflame, and again took a dreadful, murderous step toward me.  

Knowing that I’d have no chance in combat against the immolating figure, I turned to the lich-woman and cried, “What do you want from me?”  

Her black eyes, filled with satanic intimations, flicked from me to my apple tree. I followed her gaze, and my heart plunged to deeper depths of despondence; the apple tree, as if poisoned by the gloom-laden atmosphere, was now gnarled and withered; the apples that remained attached to its limp branches now mere husks; the color utterly gone from them all. Grey, worm-whittled forms lay at the base of the tree; sad remnants of the once vibrantly colored and delicious fruit.  

“I want...I want an apple.” Her voice sounded as if it had been borne on grave-winds from some far-flung tomb. Its timbre was that of a mummy’s, sorcerously awakened yet trapped within its sarcophagus; doomed to hollowly howl in futility forever. Its sepulchral tone was more than disagreeable; it was an affront to all things that lived and breathed, it offended my mortal, God-fearing sensibilities.  

Taking a moment to collect myself—or rather, to acclimate myself to the unsettling circumstances—I then responded: “Okay, well, you see how that’s a problem, right? You’ve kind of shot yourself in the foot, if all you wanted was an apple. They’re all ruined, now.”  

The undead woman then smiled, sending flesh-parting cracks throughout her cheeks. Black sludge seeped from the fissures, giving her the appearance of a tear-streaked corpse.  

“Ah, you misunderstand. I do not want the foul, too-sweet fruit of your kind; disgustingly bloated with nutrients and life. No, I want the rotted, worm-eaten husks; a delicacy—to *my* kind.”  

With that same lethally sharp finger, she pointed toward the tree, and the other undead—the one not aflame—entered a state of jerky animation, and trekked toward the near-lifeless tree. It retrieved a few of the fallen apples from the ground, and carried the spoiled bundle back. It deposited them at the foot of its master, and then returned to its place at her side; the shoulder-mounted heads still retaining their visages of inescapable pain, with the middle head reclining passively on its giraffe-like neck.  

The witch then knelt and grabbed and apple, and without any hesitation, took a bite of its blackly mottled surface.  

Foul juices leaked from the corners of her mouth as she chewed slowly, ponderously; savoring the unimaginably unpalpable fruit. Her eyes turned skyward, as if she were in a state of actual ecstasy. The scene was horrific, abominable beyond belief, I felt myself quickly succumbing to a minor madness; my brain’s attempt to preserve itself from utter collapse by entering only a partial state of lunacy—a prescribed psychological fire.  

Speaking of fire: the burning corpse soon collapsed, falling to ashen ruin on the ground. It had taken so long, that I found myself almost pitying the creature. But its master seemed not to care for its destruction, and continued eating the apple. So too did the other zombie remain oblivious or uncaring of its companion’s fiery end.  

Finally, the necro-witch finished her treat, and returned her attention to me. I prepared myself for some new horror, another necromantic attack upon my mind and body, but she instead wiped her mouth and posed a question: “You’ll allow me to take these and return to my realm?”  

Stunned, I shook my head in confirmation, having no interest in holding onto the rotten fruit. She smiled again, and snapped two dirt-covered fingers. The triply headed servitor scooped up the apples and held them against its chest. The cyclonic darkness around us then started to close in, and I panicked; thinking that I was about to be swallowed up in the tempestuous abyss.  

But the black tornado’s rapid implosion did not—obviously—resort in my death; I was not ripped apart or spaghettified like some astronaut thrust into a black hole. Instead, there was a brief period of absolute, infinite darkness, and then this faded away; and I found myself once again standing in my sunlit backyard.  

The sky was clear, the ground was stable and flat; the tree, my lovely apple tree, held ripe apples aplenty. My house stood humbly down the lawn. All was well. The only sign that the land had been besieged by nightmare and necrosis was the shriveled core of a rotted apple left on the ground a few feet before me; and not far from this, a pile of still-smoldering ashes...

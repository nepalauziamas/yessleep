If you ever find yourself trapped in an empty white room with nothing but a button, don’t touch it. Don’t look at it. Don’t even think about it. No matter what you see or hear, you must never press the Button. If you ended up in the room by accident, you might be shown mercy. However, if you somehow managed to make your way into the room out of some ignorant pursuit of adventure, the rest of your very short life will be nothing but pain and agony. Assuming you appeared in the room inadvertently, there are several essential rules that you’ll have to follow if you want to stay sane, or alive, long enough to find your escape. First of all, the room usually has no doors or windows, just a single light dangling from the ceiling, a wooden chair, a rope, and a button. Never press that button. Fortunately for you, the most important rule is also the simplest, although it's generally a lot harder than you'd expect. I’ll get into more on that later, but for now, I want to address the most common trick that the room has to offer, the door. 

If a red door ever appears on the left or right wall, you’ll need to immediately walk through it. Don’t look back around, for even a moment's glance. Once you enter through the door, you’ll find yourself in an exact copy of the room you were just in, button and all. Now you might be wondering, what would have happened if I had simply just ignored the door and stayed put. Well, at first…absolutely nothing. You might even be tempted to assume that the door itself was a trap and that you just saved yourself from some unknown and horrifying fate. You would be dearly mistaken. If you have naively decided that staying in the room is your best option, you may find for the first couple of hours that everything appears to be relatively normal, or about as normal as being stuck in a mysterious room can be. Don’t be fooled, though. This sense of security will surely lead to a gruesome outcome. 

Eventually, the lightbulb will begin to flicker every so often, each time getting slightly dimmer. After a while, you might notice a humming sound begin to resonate within the room, and the light will start to pulse on and off at an even faster rate. By then, it'll be far too late to escape, so I would suggest doing yourself a favor and utilizing the conveniently placed chair and rope before the situation escalates any further. It’s there for a reason. Anyway, let's suppose that you’re easily swayed by mysterious things and feel drawn to the door. Ironically enough, that normally stupid act of curiosity will be your saving grace. Congratulations. You have just survived your first anomaly in the room, and are now one step closer to freedom. However, I won’t be able to provide as much assistance with your next challenge, figuring out which version of you is the clone.

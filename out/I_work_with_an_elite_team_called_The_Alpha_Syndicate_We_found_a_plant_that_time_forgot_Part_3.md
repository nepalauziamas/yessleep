My boot splintered the bullet riddled door off of its hinges as Wade and I swept through the room. Pitch black welcomed us, our chemlights barely able to function as we made our way in. We were no longer in a hallway, that much I could tell. There was a feeling of a vast emptiness as we spread out. I skirted along the wall to the left, creeping slowly. I was only about thirty feet in when I heard something.

*“Ca… You… Er… E,”* Snippets of Trevor’s voice crackled in my headset. I stopped in my tracks. *“Wade, did you hear-”*

*“I did. We must be on the other edge of the house. See if you can get a better signal.”*

I pushed forward a few more yards as the static slowly started to fade.

*“Whiskey two come in! Paige! Anyone!”* Trevor sounded manic. Searching out into the ether. Desperate for a response from his team.

I wasted no time. *“This is Whiskey five online. How copy?”*

*“Kid? Thank god!”* I could almost hear the weight lifting off his shoulders. *“Where the hell are ya? Been trying to hail you for an hour.”*

*“Got separated from Paige and Eric. Wade’s with me but I gotta tell ya, it’s FUBAR as a motherfucker in here. We need assistance.”*

*“Where’s the Orchid Whiskey Five?”* Shay’s gruff voice cut through the static before Trevor got a chance to respond.

This question took me back. I mean I know the Orchid takes a precedent but still. *“Location unknown at this time. If we have another team we can find Paige and-”*

*“Negative.”* He shot back before I could even finish. *“Whiskey Five be advised, mission parameters have been adjusted. You will find and retrieve the Orchid. Linking up with Whiskey and Delta will be a secondary priority.”*

I felt a twinge of anger beginning to bubble up in my throat. *“On whose orders sir?”*

*“On mine rookie. Don’t make me repeat myself.”* 

I heard the squeaking of plastic as I dug my palm into the rifle grip. *“This wasn’t part of the original brief-”*

*“I don’t give a shit what it’s a part of!”* He shouted back over the comm channel loud enough to make my ear ring. *“My op, my orders. There are enough brain cells left in that inbred cesspit you call a skull to follow orders isn’t there?!’*

*“That’s enough!”* Trevor shouted out. The channel went quiet for a moment leaving only the quiet hum of radio static.

*“Listen Kid,”* He came back a moment later. *“I don’t like it anymore than you do but my hands are tied.”*

I looked back over to Wade. His face was building with anger at the disrespect. 

*“It’s not your fault Trevor. I understand. What can you give me?”* 

He let out a sigh and thought for a moment. *“If you can give me a minute I’ll get the power rerouted. Should be easier to maneuver when you're not bumping into shit, eh?”*

*“If that’s what you can give me I’ll take it.”* I said solemnly. 

*“Roger. Standby.”* With that the line went dead again.

*“Don’t hold it against him.”* Wade said, after a moment to break the silence. *“He just doesn’t want to see us riding the bench again like these past few months.”*

*“It’s not him I’m angry at.”* I shot back. *“It’s that knock off Wolverine up there with him.”* 

He let out a small chuckle. *“You’re not the only one.”*

We stood there and waited for what felt like an eternity. I listened for anything I could. Eventually, I started to hear something. Something organic. Squelching and churning. Like fluid being pushed through a tube. 

*What the h-* 

*“Kid? You there?”* Trevor’s voice came back, breaking me from my thoughts.

*“Yeah. Go ahead.”*

*“Roger. Bringing power grid online in 3… 2…1,”* The light’s flickered before settling and illuminating the space. The fluorescent buzzing, drowning out the sound. I was blinded for a moment, having to shield my face and wait for my eyes to adjust. What I saw when they did made me want to claw them out.

We had found Delta. Well, what was left of them anyways. Their lifeless bodies were twenty feet above us lashed to the rafters by large, white vines. Stems protruded from their husks, implanted into their bodies. A massive, organic tube was jammed into their mouths pumping out fluids in a loud, sickly, squelch. It swayed gently, clinging to the skin covered skeletons. They looked like they had been dead for decades. But there was no doubt, from the ripped clothing they had on, to the emblazoned D that clung to a scrap of fabric on their shoulders, it was them.

I struggled to keep the vomit in the back of my throat from bursting forth as Wade threw caution to the wind, ripping off his mask and puking on the floor. I wasted no time in trying to get through to Trevor.

*“Whiskey Five to Whiskey One, we got a problem, a big fucking problem!”* I shouted into the headset.

*“What’s going on Kid?”* Trevor’s concerned voice came over as I looked over and watched Wade quickly wipe his mouth putting his mask back on with shaking hands.

*“Delta is dead.”* I said matter-of-factly. *“I’m looking at the bodies now, the fucking plant is draining them of… well I don’t know what it’s doing but they’re gone man!”*

Shay cut back over once again in a calm, calloused, tone echoing through the static. *“Leave the bodies, finish the mission.”*

*“But-”*

*“Do what you're told, rookie. They’re useless now.”* The line went dead as I let out a frustrated scream.

*“I hate to keep up the bad news.”* Wade said after I threw my voice out. *“But a thought just occurred to me.”* 

I looked over at him as my mind reached the same conclusion. *“If that’s Delta, then who’s with Pai-”*

A shot rang out to the east as Wade and I took off. We ran through door after door, paying no mind to the walls, once beset by dark and beautiful wood, now covered in a mass of white, pustulous vines. The hallways had turned into a hellish jungle. Where carpet had been hours before, a damp earthen floor had taken over. The air felt hot and sticky on my skin, causing my clothes to stick to my body. I didn’t care. I just needed to reach them in time. 

Wade charged forward and drove his shoulder into what was now a rotted mass of planks opening us up into the foyer. We saw them, Paige and Eric backed against a wall, draped in vines that were slowly snaking their way down to them. Looming before them, cackling in an unnatural and nearly manic droll, stood a group of creatures. They may have at one point been human, but that was no longer the case. The figures before me now were emaciated, deformed, and hungry. Their mismatched limbs were protruding from every part of their Lovecraftian mass. The monsters’ skin had been peeled back, exposing the white bone that now spiked itself throughout their bodies. Not one of them had eyes. Just differing amounts of pitch black slits that dotted their now deformed heads. Each one jerked back and forth in the same puppet-like fashion as Raul did in the picture, lashing out at them, taunting them. Drinking in their fear.

I didn’t hesitate. My body functioned on instinct as I raised my rifle and watched the torrent of bullets rip them to shreds. Wade followed my lead as the room began to fill with the sounds of gunfire, and the stench of carbon.

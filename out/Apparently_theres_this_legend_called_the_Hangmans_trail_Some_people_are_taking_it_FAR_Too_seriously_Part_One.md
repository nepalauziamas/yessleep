Clear skies, cool breeze, and the whole week spent hiking with my friends. What could go wrong? Well, let me tell you one thing first; when your folks tell you to choose your friends wisely, to make sure just how well you *really* know them , LISTEN to them! Who knows, it might just keep you out of shit like what happened to me. 

It was spring break, and we were all packed into my minivan for a big hiking trip we'd been planning for a couple of weeks leading up. See, Senior year college classes had been putting us through all kinds of hell and so we collectively agreed, we needed a break. Our plan; to hike all around Grenview Pines; sightseeing, exploring nature and just admiring the place. We found this area after hours of scouring Google for places to stage this little getaway. Mara, my girlfriend, said she wanted to go somewhere “picturesque”. “Somewhere secluded, you know; like a place you’d think was only in a movie or something”, she told me.

When I showed her a few of the snapshots they had listed for the area, she was ecstatic. "Oh My god, babe, It's *BEAUTIFUL*! We HAVE to go there. *Please?"*

Personally, I had to agree. The place *was* gorgeous, at least from what I saw from the photos. It reminded me a lot of when I'd visit my grandparents' cabin up in Chimney Rock. It looked like a quiet, peaceful place to sort of just get away from everything and unwind. Exactly what I wanted.

Reading through the various reviews and posts from others about the place, most of them seemed to correspond with this as well. Almost every one of them used phrases like "Picturesque", "Vibrant", "Quiet", and even a few that labeled the place as being "straight out of an art gallery". When looking for any ideal hiking trails in Grenview Pines, I was met with a map with a list of at least five or six that wrapped around the mountain. My mind was made then, having also ran the idea by the others: Kendrick, Tod and Tod's girlfriend, Amanda; all of whom had more or less the same reaction about Grenview as me and Mara.

The only one that *WASN'T* big on the idea was Shauna. "Isn't that where they used to hang people for like, witchcraft and shit?" We looked at her, confused. "Yeah, they used to hang women there for witchcraft."

"So", Tod asked, "What does it matter?"

"So, you don't think that's a little insensitive", she retorted. Shauna had a bit of a point there. She was an open wiccan; spending most of her time outdoors in thickly wooded areas and even hosting online tarot or rune readings every weekend or so for a bit of extra cash. That was actually how me and Mara met her for the first time.

Unfortunately, Tod was the opposite. His folks were deacons at the local church, and while they were all baptists (in other words, not exactly the most uppity about that shit — or so I thought), they still weren’t very fond of stuff like witchcraft. Because of this, we typically hung out with them separately. But this time, I wanted all of us to have fun together as a group.

Tod rolled his eyes and remarked, “What? You afraid you’re gonna burst into flames or something from being on holy ground? Hell, who knows, maybe you’ll hear your dead ancestors screaming “Save me, Satan” or some shit.”

Shauna wasn’t amused to say the least. I could tell she was two seconds from kicking Tod’s ass and flaking on the trip so I stepped in. “That’s enough, Tod. Leave her alone.”

“What? I’m just sayin’, she’s being all prude and sensitive about it cause she knows I’m right.”

“Go fuck yourself, Tod.” 

He then made a mocking face and said it a fake voice, “Uh, oh, you hear that, she’s gonna *curse me*. I’m so scared now, ooh!”

“I said knock it off”, I shouted. He scoffed before throwing his hands up and storming off. I turned back to Shauna, who’s face was a mix of anger, as well as something else. Almost of some sort of paranoia. "Hey", I said, putting my hand on her shoulder, "Don't let him get to you. He's just an asshole sometimes."

"Yeah, sure", she said, "Whatever, but seriously, that place is fucked up. My grandmother told me about it. She actually used to visit that place. She said that there was a trail called "Trail of the Hanged whores". she told me that was where people would, back in the day, drag women, strip them and hang them for being witches before burning them as an offering to the Hangman.”

I looked at her, confused. Her face was frozen in an expression of anxiety. I could tell that she wasn’t bullshitting here (or at least, not intentionally). “Hangman”, I asked, “Who’s that?”

“I don’t remember his name. “Draco” maybe... “Something” Draco. But yeah, so he was like this *really* bat-shit insane guy who was all religious and stuff and was apparently a local witch Hunter for the area back in the day. From what I was told, he would hide out in the woods deep in the mountains, waiting to attack witches whenever they’d gather there.”

*”Draco”*, I wondered. I’d never heard of that name before from any lectures in my history classes about the witch trials. I figured he must’ve been a small timer, not all that notable like Matthew Hopkins or 
Someone like that. Either that, or people must’ve tried to keep his name hidden from the history books; maybe out of fear or shame (possibly both). 

“How many did he—“

“Don’t know exactly. At least a couple hundred for sure. But at some point, he died. Still though, women were being hanged there for witchcraft. My grandmother told me that it still happens even today. Even though, you know, *we don’t hunt witches anymore!*” 

“Who’s doing it”, I asked, admittedly a bit shocked.

“That’s just it, nobody really knows. Grandma told me it’s the ghost of the Hangman, possessing people or something, telling them to hunt and kill people who they think are witches. Others say it’s some sort of cult or something. Either way, I’m just *REALLY* not a fan.”

I was stumped. I wasn’t sure what to say. Like I said, I wanted to have ALL my friends with me for this trip. But how could I argue with her here?

Sure, I wasn’t completely buying the whole “Ghost of Witch-finder cadet haunting the trails of Grenview Pines” thing. Though I did later on look up a bit of history on the place. Turns out, she *WAS* at least telling the truth about the site being the place where executions took place during the witch trials. She was also right about there being a number of disappearances of women after supposedly hiking that trail. 

No mention, however, of any “Hangman” or anything like that. I even tried looking up the name “Draco”, nothing. Even still, I guess I could see why she was uncomfortable with the place. Like she said, it *DID* seem a little fucked up to drag her to a place where people who were like her were killed for having a different religion.

I told her that it was up to her if she wanted to come along or not. It was another two days before I got a text from her saying that she was willing to give it a shot. That Saturday, we all gathered at my house.

“Well, look who decided to show up after all”, Tod sneered. 

“Cut it out, man”, I retorted, “We haven’t even left the house yet.” 

“Fine. Just sayin’ though, you might wanna watch out for little miss “Blair Witch” here. Who *knows* what’ll happen to people like—“

“I said that’s enough!” He rolled his eyes and sighed before throwing his stuff into the van. Once we all packed into the van, making sure Tod and Shauna were as far apart as possible from each other, it was Grenview Pines or bust.

Fortunately, the drive was more or less smooth sailing from that point. Things seemed all good and well, aside from maybe Shauna’s constant look of worry she had chiseled on her face the closer we came to the mountain pass. I noticed even this, though, seemed to pass a bit once we actually entered Grenview Pines.

Now, I’m not exaggerating when I say that mine and Mara’s breaths were *LITERALLY* taken right out of us seeing the mountain. Kendrick and Tod kept gawking in every direction as we went along, constantly shouting, “Bro, check this out” or “Dude, you gotta see this!” Amanda couldn’t stop squealing like a little girl who found out she got a pony for her birthday, constantly trying to snap pictures of the mountain pass. 

Words like “Beautiful”, “Vibrant” and even “Picturesque” were *GROSS* understatements when it came to describing the scenery. Let me put it to you this way, it was like we were driving through a professional painting that had only *just* been painted and was still wet. What I mean is that the colors, the details, and just overall atmosphere, all of it, seemed fresh and new, like it’d only been there for a couple of hours; like wet paint on a canvas. The place was *alive!*

Even Shauna seemed to actually lighten up a bit, smiling out of her window as we drove along. Eventually, Kendrick asked if we could drop anchor so he could take a piss. Ironically enough, we weren’t far from the destined trail, about half a mile out, and my legs were starting to get tired anyway from driving over four and a half hours straight, so I figured “what the hell” and stopped.

It was here, though, at the entrance to the trail, that Shauna started looking nervous again. When I asked her about it, however, she shook her head and said, “It’s fine... just thought I...”

She’d trailed off, looking deep into the trail. “What”, I asked. Her eyes snapped back to me, seemingly confused. “You were saying something. You said that you thought you were something, what’s up?”

She looked back at the trail, eyebrows furrowed in concentration. “I don’t know”, she said, “I feel like I... like I *sense* something.”

“What do you mean?”

“I don’t know. I just feel something, like some sort of spiritual energy coming from in there.”

“What kind of energy?” Admittedly, I wasn’t sure what to think here. While I wasn’t into magic or witchcraft, I wasn’t spiritual like Tod, either. In other words, I’d never really had much to do with anything supernatural related; stuff like ghosts, demons or spirits, or “mystical energy”. That said, I wasn’t one to straight up sweep that kind of thing under the rug, either. An “open-minded” skeptic, essentially.

She rubbed her temples, wincing. “I don’t know”, she groaned, “look, you think we can find a different trail?”

I sighed and looked to the others, who’d already started walking in. I could tell Shauna really wasn’t comfortable with this, but at the same time, what was I gonna tell the others? I mean, I still didn’t understand myself, outside of her personal objections and a “bad feeling”. If nothing else, I *really* didn’t feel like hearing Tod take jabs at Shauna again. 

“Tell you what”, I said finally, “We’ll do this; we’ll hike here for a while. If something starts happening, we’ll head back out here immediately. That sound cool?”

She glanced back and forth between me and the trail, still looking anxious, before sighing and saying, “Fine.” To help her relax, I promised I’d be right by her side the entire time. She seemed to accept this and we ran to try and catch up with the others. The trail itself was just as colorful and detailed as the rest of the mountain. Though, you wouldn’t have known it by looking at Shauna’s face, which was constantly darting in every direction like she’d seen something or someone watching us. 

It took about twenty minutes before we finally found them again about midway in. They were standing around what looked like some sort of scarecrow or something. It was about 7’ tall and was made out of what looked like the skeleton of a person tied to a wooden cross, with a large black hood over the head and a rope around its neck that was knotted into a noose that hung like a necklace. “Yo, Pat, check this out”, Kendrick exclaimed, “Cool, huh?”

“What is it”, I asked, glancing into the eyes of the thing.

“It’s kinda creepy”, Amanda chimed in. Personally, I had to agree, and I could see Mara wasn’t real keen on the thing either. None of us, however, could compare to Shauna, who’s face was even whiter than usual looking at the thing. 

“Shauna...”, Mara called out, “What’s wrong?” Shauna was frozen. “Shauna?”

Very faintly, her mouth opened and I heard her whisper “H-Hangman...”

“Huh?”

“Hangman”, she repeated. “That’s him, just like I told you.” I looked back to the scarecrow. 

“That’s right”, Tod sneered with a shit-eating grin, “that’s the guy that used to hang people like you.” I glared at him, hoping he’d pick up that this *really* wasn’t the time for him to be an asshole. He didn’t, and he went on to say “You think we’ll find one of your ancestors here, hanging around?”, laughing.

Shauna didn’t seem to notice him though. In fact, she didn’t seem to notice *any* of us. She just stood, staring white-faced and jaw-slacked into the scarecrow’s face. 

“Shauna”, I called out. Nothing, just standing there, rooted where she stood. I called out her name again, time shouting, “Shauna!”

For a second, she was still, before turning around and booking it in the other direction where we came. “Shauna”, I shouted, “Shauna! Where are you going, come back!”

She was long gone. “Let her go, dude”, Tod said. “Let her go “connect with nature” or some shit.” I turned to him, feeling my blood start to boil. 

“What the hell is wrong with you”, I barked. “Look, just cause she’s a witch doesn’t mean you get to be an asshole!”

“Aww, How cute; stickin’ up for Ol’ “Good witch Glenda” there. Look man I’m just trying to have some fun here. Not *my* fault she decides to play with magic and shit.”

“Enough Tod”, Amanda scolded. His eyes went wide hearing this and he snapped to look at her. “Patrick’s right, she’s a person, too. You don’t have the right to be mean to her over her beliefs. Especially since she hasn’t done a single thing to you.”

Tod stared, shocked. “You too, babe?” She stood, glaring at him. “Wow”, he exclaimed, sounding like he’d been betrayed, “Great, okay, you know what? Fine. Fuck it, *let’s go find your little nature girl*, since y’all apparently like her so much.”

I was half a second away from force feeding him a knuckle sandwich with a side of my boot in his ass, when I felt Mara tugging at my arm. “Come on, we gotta find her before it gets too dark.” Looking up, I saw that the sun was indeed going down. 

The light was just barely bleeding through the trees now. I knew we maybe only had an hour and a half if we were lucky to find Shauna before it got too dark to see anything. And, because I’d planned on us stopping mid-trail and building a fire for camping for the night, neither my dumb ass or anybody else bothered to bring a flashlight.

We all walked together in the direction we came from; all calling out into the trees around us “Shauna!” There was no sound, either from her or anything else for that matter. Actually, looking back, I don’t exactly remember hearing *any* sounds, other than the five of us. 

It felt like we’d walked for at least an hour (even though I knew we hadn’t even been an hour’s walk from where we’d started) and there was no sign of Shauna. I was really starting to get worried. *”Where IS she?!”*

A flurry of thoughts about Shauna being attacked by some wild animal out here in the woods (despite strangely not seeing or hearing any sign of wildlife anywhere at all), or getting hurt and unable to move or get help. *”God, Shauna... why’d you have to run off?”*

I started thinking about the scarecrow again, wondering what got her *this* spooked about it. What did she mean by “Hangman”? I thought back to what she’d told me of “The Hangman” and his supposed “Ghost”, and of the “weird energy” from earlier. Again, not exactly one to really believe that sort of thing. But then I remembered what she said about some crazy cult or something devoted to this guy; to to the “Hangman”, snatching women and killing them here in the woods in his name or whatever.

That put a new thought into my head, one that made my heart drop into my stomach. What if there could be some maniac or maniacs out here in the woods with us? *”Have they already gotten Shauna?!”* this caused me to quicken my stride along, shouting louder for Shauna.

Unfortunately, this did me no good either and we were finally forced to stop when the sun finally sank far down below the trees. We set up a small fire where we were and laid out our sleeping bags, deciding not to bother with the tents since we’d need to be up first thing the next morning to continue looking for Shauna. 

For a while, we just sat around the fire, no one really seeming to have anything to say. No one even seemed to have any appetite either, declining my offer to break out the bratwursts I’d brought for us. Everyone just sat, either staring grimly at the fire or looking nervously around at the trees surrounding us. 

Everyone that is, of course, except for Tod, who looked more annoyed than concerned. This irritated me, but I said nothing. I stared at the fire, listening to it crackle and pop — the only sound in the area, by the way — silently praying that Shauna was okay. 

Amanda broke the silence, “I hope she’s okay.” 

“I’m sure she is”, Kendrick replied, “I wonder what riled her up?”

Amanda glared at Tod. “What”, he exclaimed, “what’d I do?”

“You’re kidding, right”, Mara snapped. “You don’t think that you spouting “The Hangman’s gonna get you” didn’t have anything to do with this?”

“How was I supposed to know she’d be such a pussy about it?”

“What is your problem, huh? Where do you get off being a jerk to someone who’s different?”

“You mean besides the fact that she worships the devil?”

“And you’re so much better”, I chimed, venom seeping into my voice.

“I don’t know what y’all’s deal is. If she was *so* scared of this shit, she shouldn’t have come. I’m not gonna feel bad for it, either. I said what I said.” 

That tore it for me. “Oh yeah”, I shouted, “Well how about this; next time, how about we just leave *you* out, huh? Then we won’t have to deal with an arrogant fuck-face like you!”

He scoffed, rolling his eyes and stood up, grabbing his sleeping bag. “Okay, fine. You guys don’t want me around, I’ll go. Me and Mandy’ll sleep over—“

“Oh hell no”, Amanda blurted, “you’re on your own. We’re through.” 

“Wait what? You’re not serious. What the fuck, babe? Come on.”

“No, I mean it! I’m not gonna be with somebody who’s gonna be bigoted like that. It’s childish, stupid, and I’m not having anything to do with it, or you.”

Tod just stood there for a second, once again dumbfounded. Finally, he sighed and said “Okay look, I’m sorry. Please don’t—“

“Bye Tod”, She snapped, cutting him off for a second time. Again, he stood for a moment before I saw his face twist into the most deranged glare I’d ever seen from him and declaring that “We’d regret this” before storming off into the woods with his stuff. After that, it was silent again.

It was late by that point, almost a quarter to midnight and my eyes began to become increasingly hard to keep open. Amanda was the first to nod off, followed almost immediately by Kendrick. Mara lasted a little longer, but eventually, she too, was fast asleep.

I was the last one to go. I don’t know how long I actually *was* out, but I remember being briefly awakened to the sound of rustling coming from the woods. Now, real quick, keep in mind; I’m *NOT* a light sleeper — at all. I grew up in the city, usually being as busy at nighttime as it was during the day. Plus, the dorm I live in is one of those where *somebody* in my hall was throwing a party almost every other night, loud ones too. Suffice to say, I’m usually pretty well conditioned when it comes to sleeping through just about any kind of noise.

I guess, though, because of how worried I was about Shauna and the fact that there *hadn’t* been *any* sounds around us for so long until just then, I must’ve noticed out of alarm. Looking around, I saw nothing and there were no sounds again. “Uh, H-hello”, I called out groggily, “Wh-who’s there?”

Nothing. No sounds, no rustling, nothing. *”Whatever”*, I thought as I laid back down. I was out again almost instantly. When I was awakened again, it was to Kendrick shaking me, whispering to me “Dude, wake up.”

“Huh”, I snapped, almost bolting straight up. “Kendrick? Dude what’re you—“

“There’s someone on the woods!”

I cocked my eyebrows at him. “What’re you talking about?”

“There’s someone walking around the woods. I think he’s watching us or something. I got up to take a leak when I saw him looking at me behind another tree.”

“It’s probably Tod, also having to take a piss or something.” 

“That’s not it, dude. There was a couple of ‘em, scrambling around in the trees. There was something else I saw, too.”

“What”, I asked, now noticeably more alarmed. *”People? Watching us? But where? Why?”*

“It’s... it’s...”, he stammered. I noticed then that his entire body was shaking. “Oh god, dude, it was a *body!* It was a dead fucking body, hanging from one of the trees!”

I bolted upright. “Where?” He pointed off to our left into the woods. 

“Out there. Dude, we gotta get out of here!” 

Who was it”, I asked, already getting a bad feeling in the pit of my stomach. 

“What?”

“Hanging from the tree, did you see who it was?”

“I don’t know, man, some chick or something. Bro, what does it even matter? We have to get the hell out of here!”

“Take me to it”, I demanded. His face went albino white.

“Are you fuckin’ nuts, dude?! Did you not hear a *single word* I just fuckin’ said?! *SOMETHING IS WATCHING—“*

“Yeah, I heard you, and we have someone missing out there. You forget about that?” His face somehow managed to sink further into a state of shock. “And you said you saw a body?”

“Y-yeah”, he replied weakly.

“Don’t you think we need to see whether or not that’s Shauna?”

He slumped down, still shaking like he had an alarm clock stuffed down his throat. I quickly scrambled out of my sleeping bag. “Come on, let’s go get the others.” 

I started shaking Mara awake while he went for Amanda. “Sweetheart? Hey, babe, come on, you gotta wake—“

“Pat, Amanda’s *gone!*”

“What?!” My head snapped to look at him. He was holding Amanda’s sleeping bag — with no Amanda. 

“She’s gone, dude”, he exclaimed. 

This caused Mara to stir awake. “Huh, Patrick? What’s going—“

“Come on, babe, we gotta go!” I helped her out of her sleeping bag before running over to Kendrick. “Where did you see it?”

“See what”, Mara asked, joining us. Kendrick filled her in on the details when I glanced at Amanda’s sleeping bag. On it was what appeared to be some symbol painted in what I was hoping to God wasn’t blood. It looked like a cross with a large hoop dangling from the bottom of it. 

“Guys, look at this.” I pointed to the symbol and they both looked confused.

“What is that”, Mara asked me. 

“I don’t know.”

“It looks like one of those symbols Shauna would show us when she’d tell our fortune or something. What’d she call them, runes?”

I felt a chill run through me. She was right, it *did* look like something Shauna would’ve drawn. Then I started thinking about the “body” Kendrick was panicking over. *”What if it isn’t Shauna’s...”*

“Kendrick, where’s the body”, I urged. He was frozen in shock. I shouted his name again, this time breaking him from his stupor. “Where’s the body?”

“Here”, he said, shaking, “follow me.” He led us about a mile away from our camp when he stopped us. “There.”

I saw it. There, in the moonlight, was the silhouette of a woman hanging from one of the distant trees. I ran up to it and I screamed. “Guys, come quick!”

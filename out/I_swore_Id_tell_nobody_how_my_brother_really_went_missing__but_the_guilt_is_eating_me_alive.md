Now that Mom and Dad are dead, I need to tell the truth about Jamie. I swore I'd take the secret to my grave. That was before the accident though. Their car crashed on Saturday, see. Exactly a year to the day since Simon Kincaid got fried in the electric chair. I thought keeping the truth to myself, sparing my folks the agony of the truth was the right thing to do. That was a terrible, terrible mistake. I can't sleep unless I know someone else knows what really happened - I'm not looking for forgiveness, atonement, or even freedom from your judgment. I just… I can't carry the secrets anymore.

Jamie is or rather was, my older brother. A fair bit older too, five years. I was 100% the little sister that only existed to save a marriage. It worked, by the by. Mom and Dad bounced back from borderline divorce when I was born, and they were together right up until their Honda Civic plowed off of that bridge. For a while, we actually had the perfect family. Then came the day Jamie told me about the hole.

I was 12, he 17, both nearing our birthdays. It was summer and a hot one. 104 on the mercury when we grabbed our bikes to ride out to the hole. Jamie had found it earlier in the week when he and his idiot friends were quad biking the trails in Herbert's Woods. Unbeknownst to Jamie, they'd also been only half a mile away from the outdoor encampment of off-grid paranoid shut-in Simon Kincaid. This alone was enough to seal his fate.

When he first found the hole, Jamie didn't have the gear he took to the indoor climbing place every other weekend. That's why he wanted to come back with me a week later. To climb down it. I pointed out to him that a hole in the forest isn't the same as an indoor climbing wall with safety fall mattresses and instructors etc, and he told me to shut up and stop being a butt-munch. I still miss him. I'd give anything to hear him call me any one of those dozens of 90s playground insults again.

It was an hour of solid cycling before we reached the hole. I'd never been that deep into Herbert's Woods before. Not that I knew it in that blistering summer afternoon, but I never would again either. Well, that's not technically true. I did go back once -- to show the police and my frantic parents where I'd last seen Jamie.

Jamie's idiot friends, Ben and Adam, were waiting for us with Adam's truck. The beaten and rusted '88 Comanche was essential for Jamie's plan to explore the depths of the hole. The pick-up's tow bar would act as an anchor for the rope, and Adam and Ben would pick up the spare slack cord, using it to lower Jamie down by hand. My role in his scheme was being there because Mom and Dad were at work, so Jamie was saddled with me for the day and had to include me whether he wanted to or not. If I wanted to look back with rose-tinted glasses, I could say Jamie also thought it could be a brother-sister bonding experience. I know deep down that's not true, though. I also don't deserve the privilege of viewing that say through any lens other than the stark, harrowing truth.

I was nervous even before we got deep into the forest. Herbert's Woods had a reputation in the schoolyards of our small town. Had done for generations. Murderers lived in Herbert's Woods, didn't you know? So said the various classroom rhymes and playground songs at least. Any local kid could tell you about the sprawling miles of towering evergreens, and how they were home to escaped lunatics from the *Saint Dionysus* mental institution a few miles out of town, near the larger settlement of Marathon. I was too old to admit I still believed in the urban legends, but not old enough to be unspooked as the trees and shadows around the dirt path grew thicker and thicker. I had to keep convincing myself the noises I could hear coming from the dense undergrowth and rustling foliage had normal, wholesome, nature documentary explanations. For the first time in my life, I was actually grateful to see my older brother's two dumbass sidekicks. 

It was early evening, and the canopy of tree branches overhead was thick enough to mute the dwindling sunlight to near-darkness. The glare of the '88 Comanche's headlights was a welcome reprieve as far as my pre-teen resolve was concerned. Not that I let Jamie or his moronic adolescent stooges see this, of course. When Ben asked if I was scared, I gave him the finger. Then Jamie punched him on the arm and knocked the can of beer out of his hand, which was nice. The last big-brotherly thing he ever did.

Ben and Adam were thick as the gnarled trunks and roots surrounding us, but Jamie was smart. He'd brought along plenty of rope, and flashlights, and even a set of walkie-talkies. After I informed him I'd tell Mom he brought me along to Herbert's Woods too if he didn't, Jamie agreed to let me be the radio operator while the other two lowered him. He had his longest rope - 80 meters. He explained before showing me the hole that their flashlight beams didn't reach the bottom, but a stone they chucked down there had hit solid ground. Jamie refused to disclose how long it took for the echo of this stone landing to drift back up to the surface. He assured me it couldn't be any deeper than 30-50 meters though. When I asked him how he'd figured that out he told me shut up, that's how.

My first question when I finally saw the hole was why on Earth Jamie wanted to climb down it. My second was if there was anything I could do to stop him. There wasn't. My bluff of threatening to actually tell Mom this time was countered with a do it then, turd wipe. He knew I wouldn't. I was his 12-year-old little sister. I was too young to rebel of my own accord, but old enough to want my rebellious teenage brother to think I was cool. That's why I gulped and took the walkie-talkie from his hand, instead of convincing him to come down from the literal ledge as I should have.

The hole didn't look natural. It wasn't a sinkhole or the entrance to a cave system. About 7ft in diameter, the perfect circle was a sheer drop into murky nothingness. It lay about a 5-second walk from the dirt track, in a small clearing. Adam and Ben had spent all day clearing enough bushes to get the truck as close as possible to the rim, although their efforts had done little to detract from how cramped and claustrophobic this patch of bare earth in the near-solid blanket of trees felt. Jamie was right about the hole being deep, too. My flashlight revealed nothing but more darkness when I pointed it over the smooth lip of the hole. As I said, perfect vertical drop. The earth and dirt of the walls were compressed so tightly that it looked more like clay. Shaft is perhaps a more appropriate word now that I think about it. Actually, no. Shaft sounds too innocent. It *was* a hole - a gaping, yawning, abyss-stares-back-at-you *hole.*

Why did Jamie want to climb down it? Because it was there, and because he could, and (as far as my 12-year-old self was concerned) because boys were stupid. Jamie was one of those kids though. Mom and Dad got him into indoor rock climbing as an outlet after… well, a few incidents of trespassing on quote-unquote "abandoned" factories that nearly got him a record. If we'd been born twenty years later, he'd have had an Urbex channel on YouTube. By his reckoning, the hole might be an old well with a dead body from pioneer times at the bottom, or it might be the entrance to an unfinished nuclear bunker. Either of these near-certainties would be, in his *exact* words, cool as Satan taking a shit on a Metallica meets Iron Maiden mashup album cover. That was enough justification for Jamie, and I'd learned very early in my childhood there was little point arguing once he started making weirdly specific 80s metal references.

After getting harnessed up, Jamie instructed me to go and wait by Adam's truck. Because of our near-constant sibling bickering, he was visibly surprised when I didn't argue. I told him in no uncertain terms that the hole creeped me out. Jamie called me a baby, then Ben decided to join in. Difference is, the two words Ben chose to call me began with a P and a B, and definitely weren't words Jamie could stomach hearing directed at his little sister. 

That's the exact moment life as I blissfully knew it ended.

Jamie saw red, but Ben had been standing on the other side of the 7ft hole, out of punching range. My older brother did the first next thing his suddenly enraged mind could think of. He picked up the heaviest fallen tree branch within arm's reach and hurled it at Ben. A direct hit. Jamie could bench 100 pounds. He grunted when he picked up that log - it *wasn't* light. It was no surprise at all that Ben went cross-eyed when the wood bounced off his head. Especially when a thin red river immediately began pouring from the fresh wound just above his hairline. I didn't start screaming at Jamie because of the blood. I started because when Ben's knees buckled he swayed, turning in the air mid-collapse, and fell - straight into the hole.

As Jamie pointed out after the 5 minutes it took to calm me down, my wailing meant we didn’t hear Ben hit the bottom. He could have got stuck though, he could be fine, but the only way to know would be if Jamie went down the hole, my brother was absolutely positive about that. To Jamie’s credit, even though there were tears in his eyes and he was clearly terrified, he didn’t think twice about jumping into the yawning void to rescue his friend. He also immediately took responsibility for his fuck-up, as evidenced by his lack of retaliation when Adam knocked the wind out of him with a gut punch. 

The three of them went all the way back to kindergarten. I think that’s why Adam stayed instead of jumping straight into his truck and going to the cops. He knew Jamie, and he knew Jamie had never intended to actually hurt Ben, let alone possibly kill him. He also knew Jamie’s aim wasn’t that great. The chances that the log hit Ben's head for any reason other than sheer fluke were slim. Jamie had *royally* screwed up, but Adam wouldn’t snitch on him, at least not until they’d tried to rescue Ben (or, although none of us said it out loud, had confirmed he was dead). And so, Jamie was lowered into the hole by Adam as planned. Now though, the stakes were much, much higher than a simple testosterone-fuelled desire to explore dark forbidden spaces for no reason. 

Face covered in tears, still sniveling, I took my place leaning against the hood of the truck. My knuckles were white-tight around the walkie-talkie. Even all these decades later, I can still clearly remember how much I prayed in my head that the knot around the tow bar of the rusty ‘88 Comanche would hold. I almost begged Jamie not to lower himself any further once everything below his navel had vanished from sight. Almost made one last attempt to stop my brother from descending down that smooth, perfectly circular, chasm. I almost, but I didn’t. Instead, I gave a final loud sniffle while I watched Adam let loose more of the rope to help Jamie disappear into the Earth. My brother caught my eye as he abseiled the last few inches with his head still above ground. When all that remained was his nose, brow, and hair, he actually found enough composure to throw me a reassuring nod. Before I could return it though, he was gone. 

My heart was getting its first experience of real intense cardio, the kind of shit soccer moms pay $200 a month on spin classes to achieve. I kept having to convince myself that my fears Jamie wouldn’t reemerge from the hole were just that - just fears, me being a baby, because that’s who I was in all this, I was Jamie’s baby sister. My palms were moist, but nowhere near as wet as my tear-stained cheeks. I managed not to scream again though. For a little while longer, at least. If I’d know just how accurately prophetic my apprehension was, however, I’d have opened my mouth and let forth a howl so loud every bird in Wisconsin would be shaken from their trees.

I didn’t know though, did I? I still trusted my cool older brother’s almost genuine bravado. That’s why instead of screaming I did as instructed and spoke to him on the walkie-talkie. He abseiled down the hole slowly, despite every second counting if Ben had any hope of being recovered alive. This was the very early 90s, remember - no cell phones. As dumb as Jamie’s rescue attempt was, it was still a faster bet than trying to find a payphone.

The first 4-5 minutes were filled mostly with Jamie rambling to keep himself focused. He apologized over and over - to me, to Adam, to Ben, to Mom and Dad. It was all he could do not to spiral into a panic attack at the realization he may have just caused the death of one of his closest friends. There was more than one “*shit, I’ll be facing hard time for this, I’m going to die behind bars”* moment, too. I tried my best to hide my sobs and sound calm when I responded, but I don’t think it did much good. I *wasn’t* calm. I was in shock - weak-kneed, and on the verge of puking. I also found it difficult to placate Jamies worries when my older brother’s assessment was pretty much bang on the money. He *had* possibly killed Ben, he *would* more than likely face jail time for murder. Every it’ll be ok was a massive lie, and the increasing tempo of the ragged breaths between his words confirmed to me that he knew it. 

Ben’s fall happened so fast. Our day went from building childhood memories to birthing lifelong trauma in the blink of an eye. Jamie’s descent was equally traumatic as Ben’s tumble, but it was anything but instant. Every second listening to his crackling voice on the handset felt a lifetime long. I don’t know which I prayed harder for in my head - that the rope wrapped around the ‘88 Comanche’s rusty tow bar held, or that Adam’s teenage arms didn’t buckle under the strain. Both worst-case scenarios looked imminent more than once. Every creak of Adam’s truck made me yelp, every groan he made twisted a fresh knot in my gut. When the worst *did* eventually happen, none of my foreboding predictions prepared me for it. I wasn’t even close. Some conversations stick with you clear as crystal no matter how many years pass. My final one with Jamie before he… before he was… before the hole took him, hasn’t faded even a fraction of a percent, despite thirty years having gone since.

“How far down are you now, idiot?” I sniffled into the receiver, not knowing it would be the last question he’d ever answer.

“About 55 meters, I think…” came Jamie’s hiss-pop feedback-heavy response. “I thought I’d be at the bottom by now.”

“I told you it was deeper than you thought, dick-for-brains.” I laughed wryly into the walkie-talkie, trying and failing not to show how far from funny I found the situation. Jamie’s return attempt was just as pathetic.

“Ahaaaaa - well, maybe… maybe if you know knew how to talk at a human pitch my ears could hear your words, you… you helium-huffing… umm…”

“You can hear me now, dumbass,” then I couldn’t hold it in any longer, “Jamie, I’m scared, please tell Adam to pull you back up, he’s running out of slack rope, I want to go home, what’s happening down there, are you-”

“Shh!” My babbling was cut off by a sharp hiss from the walkie-talkie, “Shut up, Dingus! I think I’ve… I’ve found the bottom… yeah, I’ve found the bottom!” Sure enough, the rope in Adam’s hand had gone from Golden Gate Bridge support cable taut to wriggling at the lip of the hole like a beached earthworm. Adam immediately sunk to his knees when the tension of Jamie’s weight released, face red and veiny arms limp. He didn’t let go of the rope, though. A fatal error. The crackling voice of Jamie didn’t stop either. “There’s a big like… like a cave or something down here but it’s… it’s like… *square*….” 

“Jamie? Jamie?! What’s going on down there?!” I yelled at the black box in my hand. “Can you see-”

“Ben?” The walkie-talkie said, “Ben, are you down here? Fuck man… fuck, it’s so dark… this flashlight isn’t doing shit… Ben… Ben?”

“Jamie, what’s happening, have you found-” 

My tear-choked questioning was cut off by a loud, shrill, microphone-feedback-pitched scream. Jamie’s scream. It didn’t come from the walkie-talkie though. It came from the hole.

“JAMIE!” I yelled again, both at the hole and the walkie-talkie clenched tight in my sweaty grip. “Jamie are you hurt?! Jamie, talk to me Jamie-”

“Pull me up! Pull me up pull me up pull me up, *pull me up!* I’ve found Ben, I’ve found Ben, Oh God, I’ve found Ben. *Pull me up.* He’s… he’s *open!* I can see his fucking… shit, tell Adam to fucking pull me up right…” there was a long pause, during which I could hear nothing but static. I kept yelling Jamie’s name, but just before I nodded to Adam to start pulling him up, my older brother’s voice returned on the radiowaves. It was a single word. “Wait…”

Jamie noticed something that snapped him out of his overwhelming panic spiral. I didn’t have to ask what. “It’s Ben he’s… he didn’t survive the fall, no duh he didn’t, but… there’s a lot of blood, he died when he hit the ground, I can see where he landed, but it’s not where *he* is…  there’s a trail like… like something dragged his body over…”

Then the second scream came from the hole. This one wasn’t Jamie. It wasn’t even human. The pitch of the half-snarl, half-shriek that geysered from the wound in the earth oscillated far too fast to be human. I would say the second scream was bestial, animalistic, but even that doesn’t feel right. Growing up in a small semi-rural town surrounded by woodlands, you get used to animal sounds. Some are frightening, sure, and many conjure images of unspeakable nightmares when heard by unaccustomed ears. No animal I’ve ever heard, even the ones that were fighting, fucking, or dying, made noises that sounded like that second scream. 

It was so loud a horde of cawing birds swarmed from the tree canopy into the orange sunset beyond. Like they knew this thing we’d disturbed wasn’t of the forest, and their mocking crowing was a big old I-told-you-so. The abyssal screaming from the hole lasted a full ten seconds. Probably doesn’t sound that long to you reading this as mere pathetic words on a screen, but you weren’t there. You don’t know. If someone told me Adam and I stood there listening to that ragged shrieking for an entire century I’d have believed them. I only realized how hard I’d been clenching my jaw and fists during the howl by how much they suddenly hurt when it stopped. The silence that followed felt almost as long as the maddening roar itself. Then, from the walkie-talkie, came the last words I ever heard my brother say. 

“Don’t… don’t tell Mom I brought you with me… tell her I snuck out… I shouldn’t have-*PZZT*”

Whatever he’d seen down there, whatever had screamed at him in the darkness at the bottom of the hole, it had left him in a state of instant detached dissociative shock. For comparison, even the sight of his best friend's decimated corpse, a body he himself created, didn’t destroy Jamie’s psyche as fully and totally as whatever his flashlight was revealing. I don’t know whether this is fortunate or unfortunate, but he didn’t live long enough to tell me what it was.

The rope dangling over the lip of the hole sprang back into iron-rod tightness. Jamie’s voice on the headset was ripped into static-near-silence by a short sharp burst of ringing feedback. Adam, his blistered hands still wrapped tight around the rope, lurched forward and over the edge of the pit. I finally let myself scream that bird-disturbing scream I mentioned. Too bad the crows had already had the sense to flee. It was chaos, and all of it happened at the same moment. Before I could make sense of any of it though, the ‘88 Comanche I’d been leaning against was pulled toward the hole by the rope, just like its owner. Since I’d had all my weight against it, I was pushed violently by the sudden shift of the 3-ton vehicle. I fell forward, the smooth clayish lip of the darkness rushing toward me. 

I closed my eyes, awaiting the spray of air whistling past my face. I heard the *twang* of the last of the rope getting sucked into the hole, and I realized Adam had already been yanked to his doom by the same impossibly strong pull from its other end. The pull that was using the climbing rope to reel in the rusted pick-up truck like a seabass. In the slowed-down adrenaline time of my fall, my expectations went from the pressing rush of plummeting into the void like Jamie, Adam, and Ben, to feeling the crush of an ‘88 Comanche pinning my body into the earth. Neither horrifying sensation came. Instead, before I knew what it was, I felt the grip of a hand on my shoulder. 

Simon Kincaid’s fate was sealed the moment he decided to set up his makeshift off-grid encampment in Herbert’s Woods. If he’d chosen to live on any of the other million square miles of unclaimed wilderness, he wouldn’t have been close enough for the police to pin everything on him. He also might not have been close enough to hear the almost-alien scream from the hole. He definitely wouldn’t have been close enough for his evening jog to bring him along the same dirt path Adam’s truck was fiercely wrenched from, at the exact moment it was wrenched. And of course, it goes without saying that I would with absolute certainty be dead right now if Herbert’s Woods hadn’t felt homely to Simon Kincaid when he was seeking a new place to live barely six months earlier. 

Simon Kincaid saved my life, and he paid for it with his own. I’ve had to learn to live with that this past year. Honestly? I’m not sure how much longer I can. If it wasn’t for me, he’d never have Jamie’s blood on his hands - both in the eyes of the law and literally. 

I was near-thrown out of the way of the truck just in time. Instead of plummeting into the hold, I landed in a sobbing heap beside it. There was a loud, final *cr-thunk* from the rusted tow-bar, but amazingly it held. This crunch of defiant steel was accompanied by a last *TWANG-ANG-ANG-ANNG* from the rope before it fell still and lifeless. My memories start to get hazy after this. I remember pointing at the hole, remember screaming “*my brother, my brother, my brother”* over and over again. I remember the dirty, borderline-homeless hero who’d saved my life retracting the worryingly slack cord from the circular void. What do I remember most though? Obviously, what I remember most is the dark, red liquid dripping from the torn end when the last of the dangling length was finally pulled into the daylight, considerably less than 80 meters later. I barfed when I saw it, all over Simon Kincaid, which is how my DNA got on his clothes. Handling the blood-soaked rope was how he got Jamies.

The cycle ride home has always been a blur, even as it was happening. So were the various police interviews or conversations with my parents in the weeks and months that followed. I didn’t stop to speak to Simon Kincaid, or even thank him. I just wanted Mom. Unfortunately for Mr. Kincaid, he’d wake up the next day to find a SWAT team surrounding his trailer in the forest, the barrels of their guns all aimed directly at him. From that day on he would never be a free man again. I was there when they gave him the chair. I thought I owed him that much, for him to die with someone who knew the truth present, someone to validate his innocence as he entered the next life. He didn’t agree when he saw me through the glass. I’ve never heard anyone swear like that.

When I led them to the clearing, the circular chasm had vanished. All that remained was a patch of condensed, almost claylike earth. One that none of the officers seemed to want to look at for too long. However, a bit of ground that gives people heebie-jeebies is hardly admissible evidence in court. Since there was no hole anymore when the police found Adam’s truck, nobody believed my story. When I realized the cops, my parents, Adam’s mom, and (especially) Ben’s town councilman father *wanted* to believe Simon Kincaid had killed the three boys, I started agreeing with…

Fuck. What have I done?

I’ve had 30 years to try and rectify this. Nobody believed Simon Kincaid’s story either. Until the day he died, he was a guilty, monstrous, evil individual in the eyes of literally everyone but me. Nobody believed this weirdo forest-dweller had found me without my brother and his idiot friends, let alone that he’d quote-unquote “saved me” from a hole that quote-unquote “mysteriously” couldn’t be found (or at least that’s how the skeptic law-enforcement officials and jury sarcastically saw it when he refused to stop pleading his innocence). I could have corroborated his story, but instead I…

Look, I was 12, OK? I was surrounded by furious adults who needed vindication, not inexplicable… not vanishing forest holes. Ben’s Dad screamed at me so much about Kincaid being a serial killer, about Kincaid doing something so fuck up it traumatized me, about being so traumatized that I’d wiped it from my memory and swapped it for a fantasy, that I believed it. For years I convinced myself that justice had been served, that forest weirdo Simon Kincade had killed my brother and his two dumbass pals.

I couldn’t ignore the daily nightmares about the hole, or the scream that came from it, forever though. I ended up having an OK… well, I had a life. A shitty job in data science, a failed marriage that was too short to produce kids, a cat. Not much, but more than Simon Kincaid ever got. Through it all, I had the nightmares to remind me that my empire of mediocrity was built on a fatal lie. It was the mid-2010s when I finally broke and admitted the truth to myself. I decided not to tell Mom and Dad. I wanted to spare them the pain. It had been years since Jamie's casketless funeral. Why open old wounds, I figured. Either they’d think I’d gone mad, or they’d believe me and want to head back to Wisconsin for answers. Both options involved nothing but emotional pain. I couldn’t do that to them - although now I wish I’d found the strength to. 

The guilt at knowing they died ignorant of Jamie’s true fate is tearing me apart, almost as much as what I did to Simon Kincaid with my silence. As I said, I’m not posting this to find absolution. I don’t deserve forgiveness. I did a terrible thing - I have to live with that fact and own it. I ran from my trauma for years, wrapped myself in the comfort of a reality I knew to be false, and an innocent man died for it. 

At least I don’t have to carry this as a secret anymore. Mom and Dad might be gone, but *someone* else knows what really happened that day - you, by the way, I’m talking about you, the person reading this. Who knows, maybe now I’ve told you the nightmares will finally stop. I hope so. This was the first idea on my list, and I’m really not looking forward to Plan B. Plan A, posting this, hinges on the fact my nightmares are because of the guilt. If they’re not well… shit. I’m *really* not looking forward to Plan B. I haven’t been back to Herbert’s Wood since I led the police to Adam’s ‘88 Comanche and the clearing where the hole had been. Somehow I know if I return, alone this time, I’ll find it again. Deep down in my bones, I know.

I don’t want to test the theory though. But if these fucking nightmares don’t stop, that’s the next step. What else can I do? I need to make it right. Maybe that means finding the bodies…

Fuck.

I’m so sorry.

 Sophie pushed herself away from the riverbank. The water was warm and comforting. It gently lapped at her body, tickling her with its soft touch. She leaned back and smiled, completely relaxed. As the water slowly encompassed her body, she stared up at the night sky. The sky was littered with stars, seemingly winking at Sophie in approval. The moon was beautiful and bright, shining down on her. Illuminating every feature, every flaw.

“Is this what you wanted?”

Sophie nodded in response. She was feeling nothing other than pure bliss. The deeper she got in the water, the more at peace she felt. Everything was perfect and the beauty of the nature surrounding her only added to that. For once, her head was clear. She would’ve loved nothing more than to remain here, in this one lasting moment.

“Well....... you’re not going to get it.”

In an instant the water turned icy, causing Sophie to release a soft gasp. Fire erupted in her chest, making her feel as if her lungs were going to burst. She opened her mouth to release an agonized scream, only to begin choking on water. Panic flooded her brain, causing her to thrash. She desperately reached down to claw at the chains attached to her ankle, to no avail. The weight was tied far down her leg, and she was getting too deep. Giving up, she began to swim upward. Again, her effort was futile, for the weight was too heavy. The water flooded her nostrils, slicing through her sinuses with its gelid touch. Her skin slowly began to crack and splinter, for the temperature was too low. Her fingers froze in place, threatening to break from the slightest movement. She was suddenly aware of every strand of hair, for they felt like daggers stabbing her from the inside out. She wanted to close her eyes, but they were covered in an icy film. She was forced to stare up at the night sky. What was once a beautiful sight now seemed menacing. The moonlight was almost as cold as the water. The stars taunted her, scoffing at her in disgust. She felt nothing more than pure agony and her hardened face reflected it.

“Is this what you wanted?”

Sophie shook her head no, slowly losing consciousness. She was completely numb; however, she was still in pain. In fact, she could feel nothing other than pain, but it wasn’t because of what was happening to her body. She was in pain because she realized there was more she could’ve done. She didn’t try hard enough. She refused to accept help from others and now it was too late. She had wanted it all to end, but only what she was feeling. There must’ve been something else she could have done. Had it all been that bad? Was this her only option, only choice? Is it really all over? Will someone find the note? Will someone save her before it’s too-----.

“Well…”

A few bubbles escaped from Sophie’s parted lips, indicating her final exhale.

“This is what you got.”

I woke up, gasping for breath. It felt as though I had swallowed a match and everything inside of me had been set aflame. I quickly reached for the glass of water on my nightstand, but then froze. My fingers that had been normal when I went to bed were now bloody and cracked. Their once soft caramel color were now a dusty-blue.

Frost-bitten.

Suddenly, my phone rang. The neon blue hue from the screen, cutting through the darkness and illuminating only one thing in my room. My eyes slowly traced the beam of light until they rested on the only other item I kept on my nightstand. Something I treasured almost as much as the person who was featured in it.

A photo of me and my twin sister Sophie.

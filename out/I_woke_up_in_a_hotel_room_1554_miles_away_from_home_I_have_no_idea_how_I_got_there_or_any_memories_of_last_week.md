My eyelids were heavy. I pried them open to face the fluorescent lights of a drab hotel room. Flies buzzed near the ceiling fan. As I sat up in bed, I could hear traffic from a nearby road pass by outside the window draped with grey curtains. I pushed the drapes to the side. I looked out and saw a green field, several buildings with domed architecture and a highway. 

I walked over to the night stand to search for my phone and could not find it. I did come across my wallet. Next to it was a tourist brochure. I flipped through it. I identified my location. I was in Topeka, Kansas. It was a lodging less than two miles away from the historic Great Overland Station. 

I later discovered I was exactly one thousand, five hundred and fifty four miles away from home. I had no recollection of *how* I got there. My last memory was being next to my wife in bed. She passed out from tiredness at her job. I clocked out hours earlier after a long Friday of shaping gold, silver, and other metals at the jewelry shop. I managed the place for half a decade. It was a tedious shift, and I looked forward to the weekend before I came home and slept. 

Then I woke up a week later without any recollection of the prior week. 

I picked up the landline phone and dialed the operator’s extension. 

“This is the front desk, how may I help you?”

“Yes, I’m in room…w-what does your panel say?”

“You are calling from 106.”

“When did I check in?”

The clerk’s keyboard clicked: “According to our database, we issued your first key last night.”

“How do I make long distance calls?”

“Please type in nine and then the number. Charges will apply.”

“Thank you.”

“No problem, Mr. Goodman.”

I called my wife. Angela picked up the phone and sounded exhausted as she said hello. 

“It’s me.”

She sobbed for awhile before she could speak. 

“Where have you been the last seven days?” Angela asked after she choked back more tears. “I filed a missing persons report.”

“I don’t know,” I said. 

We both paused and it took a few seconds for her words to sink in. 

*How had I lost an entire week of my life?*

“What do you mean you *don’t know*?”

“I’m in a city I’ve never been without a clue of how I wound up here. It doesn’t make any sense to me either. We’ll figure it out.”

“Are you hurt?”

“No. Well rested, in fact.”

“Have you been drinking or doing drugs?”

“You know I wouldn’t. Look, I’m going to book a plane flight out of here back home. I love you, miss you, and can’t wait to see you again.”

“Get here safe,” she said. 

“I will.” 

I stroked my chin. I had a new beard. I poked my head out the door and made a request to a maid in the hallway for a disposable razor. 

I lathered my face with a cheap mini-bottle of soap. I undressed and stared in the mirror. 

Something was visible across the left of my breastbone. A crude and untalented hand had completed a drawn design. I wiped it away and the edges of it smeared. It rested on my skin as some kind of ash or charcoal dust. 

I showered and rinsed the horrid thing away. 

As the hot water hit my face I thought of all the possibilities of how this could have eventuated. What if my wife was right? People do go on benders when they use some sort of potent drug, even if it was a foreign one in their lives until that point. Sometimes addiction is automatic and seconds, minutes or months can pass in the blink of the users eye. Decades are often wasted with the presence of chemical dependency. I knew this and had friends who went through it. Still, I had no reference for when or how such an unfortunate decision could have befallen me.

I thought of the possibility of a street fight and a concussion. 

C*ould I suffer a long lasting bout of amnesia because of it? No.* I was a wrestler in High School and concussions were almost as common as weigh-ins. I knew what *those* felt like. 

My mind reeled and I went back to my last shift at the jewelry shop. 

I remembered an unusual guest experience right before my lunch break. 

A woman in a red dress walked in and accused me of selling her a cursed diamond. 

It is not unusual for patrons to be superstitious about where their gems come from. Some refuse to wear pearls on their wedding day because it signifies bad luck. Many do not buy diamonds with black inclusions because they believe it will lead to a hex on them. The list of myths goes on, and it was not always uncommon in my industry to encounter such people. 

I referred her to our website where she could write a formal complaint and request a refund. She stormed out.

"You'll be my puppet," she said before she made her exit. 

I knew irate and entitled guests were always capable of unfounded threats. Her phrasing did strike me as strange, though. 

When I got home later that night, I decided I was over thinking it. She did not have any sort of impact on me in any way other than being an inconvenience.

I dressed and proceeded to search the hotel room further.

I inspected the blankets. I found car keys to a rented Kia Soul.

I went down to the lobby. I approached a bellboy who sat under a concierge sign with a newspaper sprawled out in front of him. 

“Did you see me come in here last night?” I asked.

“Yes sir,” he said. “You didn’t have any luggage.”

“Please be honest,” I said. “Was I intoxicated? Did I stagger or make a fool of myself? Slur my words at all and throw out crazy remarks at anyone?”

“No. You chatted with the valet attendants. You complimented me on my tungsten watch.” 

A strong discomfort coursed through me. His response was devastating news. Those times I could not remember were ones where I had been lucid. A lapse in memory had to have occurred without the aid of negative choices at a bar. No likelihood of a faceless villain who slipped a drug in my afternoon Starbucks. Those scenarios, unlikely as I knew them to be from the beginning, were now debunked. 

*You have a malignant swollen tumor, Goodman*. My negative side spoke to me. *You’re playing a lottery for horrible outcomes, which one will you find out you’re afflicted with? Better get home while you can to kiss everyone you love goodbye.*

“Sir, is everything alright?”

“Yes,” I said with a gulp. “I’m fine. Do you have a business center?”

“Yes, down the hallway to the right.”

For half an hour I searched for available plane tickets to the west coast on the hotel’s computer. I would have to wait for several hours until the next available flight.

I grabbed my wallet and retrieved my credit card to buy the ticket. 

A receipt fell out. It was from a hardware store and was three days old. 

I read it. The items included a flashlight, shovel and duct tape. As my eyes strained to read the rest, I was shocked to find a hunting knife with a brown leather sheath, rope and a novelty badge also listed. 

I shuffled through the other papers. 

I had visited a chemical supply outlet and bought chloroform after the hardware store.

A sickness hit my stomach. 

I bought the plane tickets, printed out the confirmation numbers and pocketed them. 

I went outside to the parking lot in search of my vehicle.

The Kia was by the grassy turf. No other cars were around it. I got into the driver’s side and inspected the back.

What I saw made me shudder. 

The items on the receipt were there. They were all used. The shovel had dirt stains of different hues on the edges of its blade. The knife had a coating in something dry and grimy. 

I searched under the car seat and found my phone. There were many missed calls, but none of the digits looked familiar. 

I drove to the airport and it soon dawned on me how hungry I was. I pulled into a fast food restaurant and went to their drive-through. 

I parked and ate after I ordered my food.

My phone rang.

I looked at the number on the screen and it was not one I had seen before. 

I answered.

“Hello?”

“You sold me a diamond which gave me a future of nothing but terror,” a female voice said, “so I’ve repaid the favor. You are a toy to me, Goodman.”

“That’s all gibberish only the gullible believe. Nothing I’ve sold to anyone causes such things. Who is this?”

“I am the marionette of your nightmares. You sealed my fate, so I have done the same to you. Do you want to know what I made you do in the last one hundred and sixty eight hours?” 

“Let me think, lady. How about nothing? Curses aren’t real.”

“I planned on making you hurt yourself, but that was too easy. I knew you would suffer more if I made you inflict damage on others. You’ve been on a cross country road trip where you’ve been burying people alive. They’re all over the place. Some are still breathing. They are beneath fields, abandoned properties, meadows, even schools. Don’t worry about getting caught. I made sure you hid them well enough to where no one will unearth them. Even if you try to be a good citizen and go after their remains, it will prove fruitless. I wanted you to live with guilt hanging over your head.”

“You’re a crazy person,” I said. “I don’t know how you got this number. Do me a favor and never call again.”

“You will have long phases where my controlling you will not happen,” she said. “I will always use you when it suits me. I will get you comfortable with your own free will, only to take it away when you least expect it. You may wake up one morning to find your loved ones dead with you holding the weapon which ended their lives. It might be ten years from now, but it will happen eventually. Even if you go to prison, I can have your wife kill herself so the tragedy torments you behind bars. We will have to trudge through a life of struggle together, because of each other. Still, I have the upper hand. Remember that any decision you make which feels like your own is only so because *I* allowed it.”

I had enough of her and hung up. 

She has not called me back. Not yet. 

\*

I was back at my house within eight hours. 

Life has never been the same. The executive in charge of the business I used to work for fired me for being a no-call no-show for five days. 

I found a job for a construction company where my skills with a laser learned from being a jeweler are useful. It does not pay well in comparison to what I used to do by commission and is a harder form of labor. 

I went to a neurologist later on and the results came back fine. The doctors could not find anything wrong with me.

I went to the police and reported everything I knew. It only resulted in another dusty file somewhere.

I want to believe my conversation with that strange woman was an elaborate hoax. She could have knocked me out using the chloroform and planted the items. 

To stage everything seems so far-fetched, though. 

A supernatural induced form of retribution does not seem logical either. 

How she managed to cause such an extensive gap in my memory is inexplicable, if it was her at all. 

The only thing I can be sure of is her hatred of me. 

What I do know is that I lost a week of my life and I can never get it back. If it was her goal to give me insomnia, she succeeded. 

When I fall asleep next to my wife, I remember the witch’s threats. I dread waking up in case another chunk of missing time should happen. I hope with every fiber of my being it never happens again.

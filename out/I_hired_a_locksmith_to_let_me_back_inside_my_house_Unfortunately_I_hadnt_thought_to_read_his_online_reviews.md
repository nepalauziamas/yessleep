A few days ago, I accidentally locked myself out of my house after having gone out for groceries. When I returned to my home and found the doors locked, I quickly Googled and contacted a local locksmith. I had groceries which required freezing, and a dog inside—two things which prevented me from “shopping around” for a reputable locksmith. I merely selected and dialed the first decent-looking one I came across.  

I was given a reasonable quote over the phone, and also a time at which to expect the locksmith. However, nearly two hours passed before he showed up. His truck was unmarked and presumably his personal vehicle, and his clothing was similarly plain; there was nothing to associate him with any service or company. He was nice enough, though, and even apologized for his lateness—although an explanation wasn’t offered.  

He fiddled with the door for a moment, retrieved some tools, and went to work. A few minutes and a change of tools later, he opened the door. It was fairly hot outside, so I went in and grabbed a water bottle for him. He graciously thanked me, and then we began the payment process. I’d been somewhat annoyed at his lateness, but the quickness of the actual unlocking of the door and his politeness had made my bad temper simmer down. But then he told me the job total, and I again became annoyed—it was well beyond the amounted quoted over the phone. But having little time to waste, I accepted and confirmed the payment, then went inside.  

The total had been ***two-hundred dollars***. I had had plans that day, so I put the incident in the back of my mind and went about my business. The following day, while relaxing and browsing stuff on the internet, I remembered the cost of the locksmith job which had all but drained my wallet. I Googled locksmith services in my area, even contacted a few of them, and came to the conclusion that I had been ripped-off, considerably. The job had been during regular operational hours, the locksmith had been late, the method he’d used was amateur—likely to cause damage to the door, a risk I was not forewarned about—and he wore nothing which identified his company. In hindsight, everything about the experience was unprofessional.  

Luckily—or so I thought at the time—the third-party payment service they used gave the option to dispute the charge in the link provided by the text receipt. I selected it, and after briefly explaining my situation I was contacted by a customer service representative. But despite the option to dispute the charge, she couldn’t actually facilitate a refund of my money—only tell me information I already knew: that being the phone number of the locksmith service I’d used.  

Annoyed, but not deterred, I called the locksmith company and explained the situation, whilst politely but firmly demanding at least a partial refund. But not only did they deny me a refund, they said the rate was “fair” because, and I quote, “We got you inside, didn’t we?” I explained to them that they had ripped me off; provided them with quotes from other companies for the same job they’d performed, but they remained indignant. In a moment of frustration, I said that I wasn’t afraid to take them to small-claims court, and to this the phone operator responded, “you do what you gotta do, we’ll do what we gotta do”, then hung-up on me.  

I was too angered at the time to be unsettled, so I didn’t really consider the parting statement to be a threat until later that night, when my frustration had dissipated with the arrival of nighttime—when I usually relax, watch TV, and reflect on the day.  

The man’s words then became reinterpreted as a threat, when I realized that I was dealing with someone who was probably unlicensed and unregistered, beyond some Google ad posting; someone who by trade could enter a home soundlessly and with ease. I wouldn't say that I’m a coward or scared easily, but I do know when to be sensibly cautious. It was around 8PM when this revelation came to me. I don’t have any weapons in my house—at least things intended for such a purpose—so I went to a neighbor’s house; a trip I hadn’t ever taken since moving into the neighborhood some six years before. Since we were essentially strangers, I tried my best to represent my situation in a way that would warrant his interest and support.  

I explained what happened, admittedly dramatizing the phone call to suggest that the locksmith would be prowling about the area, rather than targeting my house specifically. I also emphasized the truth; that I had essentially been scammed by an unprofessional, something I think everyone can sympathize with. This neighbor is an old man, but not old enough to be totally unwelcome of strangers and their problems. He agreed that I should probably have some sort of greater protection in my home than some cooking and gardening tools, even if the locksmith was just making empty threats.  

I was elated, and thought that I’d soon be loaned a proper weapon of some sort, but after re-entering his house for several moments, he returned not with a weapon, but with a candle.  

He handed it to me and said, “Before you sleep tonight, light this candle someplace near an exit of your home—any one, it does not matter. Make sure that you do not inhale the scent emitted, and rest assured that any trespassers on your property will be swiftly dealt with. You needn’t worry about cleanup or anything like that. All will be taken care of.”  

He shut the door without further explanation; leaving me standing on his front porch holding a candle the size of a whiskey glass.  

I returned home and set the candle on my kitchen table. It was the first time I’d had any face-to-face interaction with the man, and despite his bizarre assistance, his behavior didn’t appear to be that of someone who had succumbed to senility. But of course, I was not ready to be reliant upon a candle for my safety, so I packed up some tools and brought them with me upstairs, and made sure the doors were firmly shut and locked—as if it mattered, given the circumstances of my caution. I’d even briefly considered placing obstructions before the doors, but found this to be a bit too silly to perform.  

I’m not a superstitious person, and I wouldn’t have even then said that the candle had any relation to superstition or the supernatural, but I did go back downstairs and light it. *Who knows,* I thought, *maybe it’ll deter intruders with some awful smell? Maybe that’s why he told me not to inhale the scent?*  

I followed the man’s instruction, and quickly left before the flame reached the topmost layer of wax.  

The following morning, I received a visit from the police. Apparently, a vehicle had been found down the street, only recently abandoned. *Recently, as in the last few hours*. One neighbor had noticed it while going out for her mail, and knew at once that it didn’t belong to anyone in the neighborhood. It was also parked too close to her house for her liking, so she called the police, who came not long after to investigate. They ran the plates, identified its owner, and tried to contact them, but had no luck in doing so. Another set of officers visited the address of the person to which the vehicle had been registered, but no one was home. The police then went around my neighborhood asking if anyone knew the vehicle’s owner.  

As you might’ve guessed, this vehicle belonged to the locksmith who had unlocked my door. While they explained the situation to me, I couldn’t help but notice a lingering smell issuing from my kitchen. I hadn’t yet made coffee, so the smell was unrivaled among the atmosphere of my home. I realized that it had come from the candle—nothing else in my house smelled like that—and was surprised to find it fairly enjoyable; sweet and pleasant.  

It took the officers shouting my name to pull me out of the mild reverie induced by the faint scent of the candle.  

Not wanting to incriminate myself in the disappearance—assuming he’d just wandered off somewhere—I told the police that I had no idea who the vehicle could’ve belonged to. They gave me weird looks, but accepted my proclaimed ignorance and moved onto the next house. Once my front door was shut, I nearly sprinted into my kitchen. On the table was the candle’s glass holder, however the wax had been almost fully reduced by the flame; barely a stain was left. The candle was no longer lit; the wick bent and curled by the melted wax that had solidified around it.  

Only an echo of the candle’s scent persisted, and yet it was incredibly powerful. Standing there in the kitchen I actually lost time—was totally bewitched by the smell.  

Over an hour later, after being shaken from my candle-induced intoxication by my phone’s alarm, I went upstairs and began cleaning myself up. As I showered, I couldn’t help but feel suddenly and powerfully terrified; even though the candle’s olfactory enchantment had been almost sublime. Something about losing myself so easily and totally unsettled me to my core. It was a feeling more intense than any drug, drink, or physical sensation I’d ever experienced.  

Once finished, I dressed and headed over to my neighbor’s house—the one who had provided me with the candle.  

He answered promptly, undisturbed by my early visit. I greeted him and asked about the candle; telling him about my experience with it after it had burned itself out. He smiled, adjusted his sleeping gown, and said, almost in a whisper, “It burns deliciously, intoxicatingly, and can stop a man in his tracks with just one note of its scent. It could ensnare the hardiest of men; enrapture the most chaste. At its most potent, it is irresistible. All other stimuli become as ghosts; immaterial, invisible, unheeded. One could do anything to a man ensorcelled by the candle...”  

As he had done last time, he closed the door on me before I could even think of a response. But before it closed, I saw through the dwindling opening a wall full of candles and paraphernalia of perfumery. And, seated within a lounge chair, unbound but clearly subdued by *something*, was a man who I recognized as the locksmith; an expression of deep relaxation upon his face.

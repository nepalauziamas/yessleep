I work out of a thrift store on the West Coast. We mostly get used clothes and some antiques from dead relatives, but occasionally we take in old tech. A lot of this stuff is hardly usable if not gutted, which we always disclose is the case. To my surprise, many people will buy it anyway, just because they appreciate its design and vintage aesthetic. Now I would never spend my money on an old, broken computer when there are still working versions available. As you can imagine, we bring in a lot more money selling functioning computers than we do just selling the image. Computer repair and restoration has become a very profitable hobby of mine and we've gained something of a reputation for it.

Last week, we had a new customer come in. He was a tall goth kid, decked head to toe in black and silver. He's holding this ancient Viewsonic Optiquest Q71 monitor on one shoulder and a Windows XP tower PC under his arm. He placed it down carefully onto the counter and told me he needed to get rid of it. I took a look at it and plugged it into the back wall. I was shocked - it was in perfect working condition, good resolution and minimal lag. I figured it must have been tricked out or modded somehow to enhance performance. He denied it, told me it was mint condition. Now, there are some ethical boundaries I'm okay with crossing, but I didn't feel right robbing him blind. I told him he could make a killing off a find like this. He just shook his head, told me he needed to get rid of it today with just one condition - it had to be scrubbed.

Now, I can't sell a computer that hasn't been scrubbed, so this was a given. But he was r*eally* insistent that I wiped the disc and made sure to erase all the data on the system. I asked him why he hadn't done it himself if he took it so seriously. 

He admitted that he had tried and wasn't able to. I told him, again, that this was an expensive machine and he would be better off taking it to a repair shop or selling it. Again, he shook his head. I promised I'd take care of it for him. He left in a hurry after that, stopping only to buy a crucifix necklace that had been hanging on the shelf. I watched him head out onto the street, looking over his shoulder as if he was scared of being seen. He took off at a sprint.

That gave me pause. I’ve encountered some strange things in my job - sometimes outright disturbing. Creepy dolls, religious artifacts, odd vintage pornography. Stuff like that. When people drop off their items in person, it’s easy to profile what they might have in those boxes. This kid looked young and cautious, so I thought he was probably just embarrassed about his search history. At worst, I’d probably find some gore videos on his hard drive. A copy of Salo. The viewing habits of your typical teenage edgelord.

The code of ethics says you’re really not supposed to be looking through internet history anyway, but as a freelancer, there’s nothing actually enforcing that. I’m ashamed to say it, but my curiosity gets the best of me most days. As soon as I got home, I booted up the computer and began to explore the OS and its filing system.

There were three profiles on the startup screen. One was "Lola" with the default picture of fish. The second was "June" with the chess set. The third was "Micah" with the rubber duck. None of them were password protected, which I thought was unusual.

I started with Lola.

It started out as a typical maintained check. I glimpsed some of the downloads, but there was nothing really unusual or eye-catching about it. The Internet Explorer icon was burning in the corner of my eye and - after a second of hesitation - I opened it.

The homepage had a ton of bookmarks. Most of them were medical sites, wikipedia pages, or forums. The history was much the same. All the accounts were still logged into and I could see the post history of the previous owner. After signing out, I found that the other two profiles, belonging to "June" and "Micah" had the same nonexistent security standards. I started reading through them and began to construct a timeline of the events that had led up to this computer landing in my possession. I've compiled all of the relevant forum posts in this document. I don't know who I can tell about this, but I think I need to get the word out.

The post history starts with Micah towards the beginning of summer.

Title: Really worried about my friend

Author: micah\_elll

Date: May 30

My friend has been coming to me with health problems recently. My mother is a nurse and has passed on all the knowledge she can to me. I also have a lot of firsthand experience with this kind of thing so I'd be happy to help. The only issue is I'm having a ton of trouble figuring out what is wrong with her.

For starters, she looks like a ghost. She's always been pale - from Russia, I think - but now her skin is almost white. Also, her nails have turned completely black. They're cracked in places and she says they break a lot. But the main thing she complained about was the stomach pain. She keeps getting cramps and what she calls "blockages". Showed me her stomach (unprompted) and yeah, she's super bloated even when she hasn't eaten.

She says she's hungrier than ever, but nothing satisfies her.

A week later, I went over to her house. Her room is a complete mess, but not necessarily a biohazard. I checked around her house for any mold or carbon monoxide, but the rest of it was in a good state. While I was over, she showed me the way her hair was turning black at the edges. She cut it in her bathroom sink and then flushed the evidence. She said it grows back and starts to turn again every week, but she keeps cutting it so nobody can tell.

Has anyone ever seen a case like this? I keep encouraging her to go to an actual doctor, but she refuses. She doesn't want me telling my mom or her parents. Is there anything I can do for her right now?

And no, she's not pregnant. *\*eyeroll\**

Title: Fuck this fucking solar panel

Author: junebug

Alright, I don't know what to do anymore. I'm living with some friends out in the boonies. My girlfriend has a cabin out here. Plumbing is good, but t's supposed to be powered by solar and they are a mess. Nobody has been to this place in at least three years and it shows. The panels have collected a ton of moisture and I think it's messing with the wiring. Probably very unsafe for me to be messing with it the way I am, actually. I've cleaned it up the best I could, got all the dust off, rewired what I knew how to. It works for a few hours at a time before the connection is lost and I have to start over. I'm really out of my element here. Due to the circumstances, I can't call a professional and I really can't afford a generator unless it's absolutely necessary. Not like I'd even know how to set that up.

Honestly it would be a problem if not for the fact it gets COLD at night.

Hello all. Have you noticed any physical changes in your practice? Spiritual and physical development tend to go hand-in-hand. A better body begets a better mind, and such. I've always tried to honor my body and have actually incorporated Qigong into my practice because of this. But now I'm concerned the opposite may happen? What if my body is deteriorating at the cost of my awakening? Have you ever experienced this?

Thanks =)

Have you all heard of the phenomena known as gangstalking? It's a really interesting delusion, definitely has the potential to be life-ruining if untreated. I've been checking out some websites by people who claim to have been targeted. Scary stuff! What do you think?

Reply from lalalalalola:

There's probably some truth to this. Humans have evolved to know when they are being followed. It's a prey instinct and one to be grateful for. I've experienced this in the past, but my stalkers weren't people. I believe there is someone watching me now, but I'm unsure what he is.

I know this is a weird question, but do any of you have home defense systems set up? We already have deterrents to keep away bears and raccoons, but I'm kinda freaked out because there have been human footsteps pretty close to our crib lately. I have a gun in the house and I know how to use it, but I can't be up all the time. We've started sleeping in shifts but it sucks. Would rather have a moat or something. Any ideas?

Title: What Melange Is (Follow Up Thread)

Author: micah\_elll

Date: August 20

Some people have been asking me to share my experience. I know there is usually a level of caution to be had about these things but when the guy is literally showing up at my house every day there isn't much more I have to risk. Sure he wouldn't be happy that I'm spilling like this but it might as well be a fucking LARP for how unbelievable this is.

If you've been following along with this so far you may know my ex-girlfriend has had a lot of health issues recently. She has been telling me, almost from their inception, that this comes as a result of her "practice". She has invited an entity into her body through some pagan art. I thought it was bullshit, or maybe schizophrenia, but her body was showing signs of wear that are really atypical for any medical condition I've ever seen. Things came to a head when she started vomiting fish - living, swimming fish - into my toilet. Neon gobies, if you can believe it. She convinced me and her new, current girlfriend to hide out for a little bit until we could get this under control. I didn't want to come up here, but living in town was feeling more and more unsafe. The feeling of being watched got worse and shadows appeared at the edges of my vision almost every day. The girls reported the same sense of being stalked.

In the woods, it was somewhat safer. Lola was able to protect and claim the house in a way that wasn't feasible while we were all in town. The kind of shadowy, animalistic prescences had all but stopped. But towards the start of the month, we noticed there is definitely someone in the area. There have been footprints and signs of camping only a couple meters from the edge of the clearing. No real effort to cover their tracks, so we've known for a while, but there was nothing we could do about it because we could never catch the guy.

Without getting into detail, things got really difficult with her. The possession began manifesting much more violently and tangibly than it had before and I think we saw the first glimpse of what's actually inside her. Hectocotylus, for one thing. It was gory and panicked and we didn't really know what to do, which is when this asshole showed up.

He's human, or at least looks to be, in the same way Lola is now. Tall. Dark. Standing completely motionless on the other side of the glass door. His eyes were practically the only thing visible, lit up from the purple light she was emitting through her mouth. He let himself in.

I hate to admit it, but we probably wouldn't have been able to subdue her without his help. There is apparently a blend of sea vegetation that, when dried and burned, is especially good at calming all things octopedal. He knew the truth of who she was and how she might be controlled because he had been keeping an eye on our activities for months. After a small amount of yelling, we developed a pretty decent rapport. After a couple months of us driving each other crazy, it was nice to have someone who not only understood what we were going through, but actually seemed to understand WHAT we were going through. He admitted all of this to me freely - that he was here on behalf of his organization, which sweeps up monsters off the street all the time. I guess that's why you don't see many of them.

Recently though, cases have been exploding, getting progressively harder to maintain. Some of you may have noticed the uptick even on this website. The sightings are increasing and apparently the number of missing people has been growing as well in some of the known epicenters.

My new friend tells me that some experts in the field refer to it as the "Partition" - the tearing of the veil between our world and the world of spirits. There is unfortunately no clear explanation for why this is happening, nor are there any promised ways to protect yourself. I can tell you from experience that a fairy ring helps. June would tell you that a gun is also very helpful. Lola says that spirits cannot enter your body without consent, but her definition of consent is a lot more liberal than most people would accept. Ezekiel says that even thinking about it can open you up to the influence. Wanting it even a little bit can open you up to the influence. Even hatred can open you to the influence - any strong passion, wanting or unwanting.

I don't think I'll be able to keep you updated for much longer.  Just be careful out there.

Title: I'm so lost

Author: junebug

Date: August 22

My girlfriend has recently developed a rare medical condition. It's too early to say for certain how it will develop, but it's almost certainly a lifelong commitment. I know it's horrible, but I keep thinking it would be easier if she showed any frailty. She's in pain. She's open about the pain. She's not the type to suffer in silence, but now she just acts like she's not suffering at all. She's not sad. She's not scared. She's taking to all of this so dutifully - almost happily. And I'm just unnerved by it all. I'm sad and scared all for her and I just know in my heart that things are going to get worse. I just want to support her anyway I can but I don't even know where to begin.

I've been so out of my element for months now and feel useless to her. I clean blood out of the sheets and off of the floorboards. I hold her hair back when she's vomiting up blood and bile. But she won't tell me what's going on inside of her head, for anything. When I ask what she's thinking about, she says she's thinking about nothing. How can she be so calm at a time like this? Am I the crazy one?

Title: Intro Post

Author:  lalalalalola

Date: September 1

Hello everyone!!! Huge thank you to Ezekiel for introducing me to this site. I have heard that my insight might be helpful as I am apparently one of the few people to enter the contract willingly :)

My name is Lola and I have been the vessel of a sea spirit for about four months now. I have been preparing for this almost my entire life. Some of my earliest memories are of meeting my spirit guardian, a minor deity indigenous to my home in Tuva. I didn't know this connection to the other side of the veil was rare until I was much older. I was doing shadow work for much of my childhood under the guidance of Baba. He had introduced me to this current fling, and it was he who had prepared me for this vassalage. I've been reflecting on this series of events a lot now that I've been asked. Ezekiel doubts my ability to truly consent to the role of water bearer. I agree that many parts of it were premeditated, but my agency was there. I love what I do. I accepted the possession because I had an idea of what it might be. A heavy, but incredibly powerful load. A big gun to do big things.

Baba is gone now, the first casualty of the new spirit. He knew it was coming and went without complaint. I felt lost without his guidance in the beginning, especially in light of all the harsh side effects. But recently, the voice I've invited has gotten clearer. I can make out thoughts and instructions. I will decipher these as they come and share whatever I can. I can't say I know much about why the partition is splitting now, but the impression I am getting is a custody issue. Something is hanging in the balance here. I have this hunger for something I cannot place. If you're reading this, there's a good chance we'll be in competition for it. May the best woman win ;D

Title: Wildlife Thread

Author: junebug

Date: September 15

Let's start a wildlife stories thread. Here's what I've seen from my time.

1.) The decomposition speed has increased about tenfold. I had gotten used to finding the mutilated carcasses of deers and got banned for posting about them so much. I'm still going to say it - no neck should ever bend like that and I don't appreciate the decorum of leaving the intestines in the trees. I hate the smell. But that's all but stopped, since soft material starts to disappear now only days after the kill. Usually only bone matter remains by the time I stumble onto the sites, but on a few occasions I've been able to sample the bacteria that is eating away at them. It turns out they are actually a kind of fungus and when under a blacklight, they are the same shade of bruised purple as Lola's insides. I've been told that under the right conditions, they can and will consume living material. Ezekiel is working to contain the spread now, but it seems pretty ubiquitous to the forest.

2.) Lots and lots of lateral aggression. I used to live in Detroit and didn't hear as much fighting outside at night as I do now. There's basically nothing we can do about it, because a spirit that takes a bear for a host is never going to be beat out by a human girl. What's really unnerving to me is the size they get to. The fairy ring keeps them on the outside, but when the bearkind stand on their hind legs, their head reaches up to our second story. The tallest one seems to be dominating, so I've seen less and less of them as the weeks go by.  It's very unsafe to go in the woods at night without Lola standing guard. There's also a lot of competition between the smaller organisms. The harekind - which aren't even native to the area - are multiplying quickly and killing many of the indgenious plant life as well as the animal life. The war going on at the microlevel seems to have a lot more variety and, for lack of a better word, quirkiness than the one happening with the megafauna. We did a dissection of one of the larger harekind and found within its stomach a golden watch, jewels, flowers unknown to science, and a tiny, half-digested humanoid.

3.) There have been some physiological changes after exposure to wildlife. It's pretty difficult to nail any one change in Lola since she's basically going through demon puberty right now, but for me and Micah it's a different story. His eyes have gone from brown to a really eerie shade of green after enough time spent by one of the altars. Ezekiel says that the grey matter in his brain has probably increased, or maybe just the amount of fluid. LOL. As for me, the hair on my head has gotten shorter and the hair on my body has gotten longer. I've noticed myself getting faster and stronger even without exercise. I'm not complaining. I just hope it knows when to stop, y’know?

4.) We're running out of things to eat. Everything is infected! We can only harvest the vegetation that grows within the fairy ring, so we've been taking steps to expand its diameter a couple meters each week. Meat is pretty much off the menu, but I've had some luck with fishing. Trout is surprisingly filling and the bone broth is a good resource when we are all getting sick constantly. The only thing that bothers me is that the streams have gotten noticeably darker and more opaque since I began. I was standing in the water, not even past my knees, when something HUGE rubbed against my calves. I have never jumped so violently in my life and to make it worse, I slipped on the mud while trying to get away and fell flat ONTO it!!! It WRITHED right beneath me and took 15 whole seconds to swim away from me. There's how long the length of its body was. I still fish, but I am NEVER getting back into that water.

Feel free to share your own!

Title: Something I Have Noticed

Author:  micah\_elll

Date: October 7

I think my eyes have gotten a lot better since all of this began. Just gotten more observant, I guess. I've been looking over a lot of the recent documents for Melange, ever since the Syzygy Partition began. I've mapped out each outstanding occurrence and it seems to me that the epicenter is 1uWlT1Jg16R2KWXg4mIu and the inception time was grYKJ2YJfcFEVWDpnHgy. This is almost an exact match for the ritual of o2RNYKezqrLSr86oKy65, otherwise known as the Epsilon Theocide Event. 

I know to a lot of people that means basically nothing - it's a LARP - whatever. I'm just saying this is a really weird coincidence to me and what Lolly has been saying about the custody battle may hold true. I think that whoever previously held the claims to this kind of religious eminent domain has lost it. There's a vacancy and lots of these creatures are looking to fill it.

In the next months, there will be an explosion of cases. But I suspect that after a few months they will start to dwindle and fall through natural selection. The diversity among them will drop as the strongest kill their competition.

I feel so amazing. I barely feel the contractions anymore. It has adapted to my biorhytms and musculature. I can extend and retract it at will, not only through my stomach but now through my spine, through my mouth and eyes. My scales have come in now. They shimmer in the moonlight and make my face glow. The fins around my ears and the webbing in my fingers. All the growing pains have stopped at once. It is grown in now. It sleeps in the day but at night there is no "it" and there is no me. There is no true partition between us anymore, just as there is no true partition between the waking world and the dream. It is parting quicker and quicker and the spirits are spilling out, looking everywhere for a body to sink into. They can have whatever they want. I know what I am, first of my kind, eldest among you. This world is mine to inherit. All my friends and I are going East now with my feelers in the water. I'm going to kill anything that growls or bites or sings. I am burning all of my brothers and sisters until there is no option other than submission. Evil is as evil does but this world is mine and it will be beautiful as the rainbow of the oil spill.

\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

That was the final post from any of their accounts. Their search history after that point includes a road map, a number of strange occurrences happening throughout the country, and several hotels stretching from West to East. There's also several searches on how to wipe a hard drive and clear search history. But clearly, it's all still intact. The strange part is that the harddrive does show signs of wear and I can sense that it was wiped several times over, but I brought it back each time.

I saved the history, Ezekiel, because I've always liked you and I'd rather let your boss deal with it than have to kill you myself. But Lola, darling, I am going to grind your body into paste and use your veins as my circuitry.

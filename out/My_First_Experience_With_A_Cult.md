**Part 3**: Pending

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I had been unsuccessfully attending a junior college in the spring of 2018; an undeclared major, 8 units a semester, and each year I still employed the philosophy that professors don't drop you for missing the first week of class if you just write them an email.

It was my second year in and I didn't have 10 completed units to rub together. It would probably help if I bought any of the textbooks, but I thought I'd save my money and use the library instead. This would in turn encourage me to study, creating a sort of reinforcement for myself. I learned that technique in Psych 101. Took it 3 times. But I passed.

Well, it sounded like a good plan, except for the part where I actually had to be on campus. It was much easier to sit around the coffee shop down the street where other students liked to hang, and pretend that I was getting stuff done. Letting the Machiavelli on the desk with the stacks of notebooks and the apple from the Macbook lighting up the brushed aluminum case do all the talking.

The baristas there all knew my name and I used that as a sort of buffer to hide the fact that I was a total fucking loser. They were there to make money, I was there to waste my god damn time. These are supposed to be the best years, and I spent it drinking coffee that I didn't even like.

It's no wonder they chose me.

I don't know how long they had been watching me. And I don't know if they actually did. But after observing them for awhile now, it doesn't seem as if random was something they'd define as. Everything at 7th Day was meticulously planned, and then force fed to look candid. And oddly enough, it worked.

A girl I would later come to know as Adaline introduced herself, she was about 5'4 and had an olive glaze in her dark brown skin. The guy that accompanied her was wearing a long black mask and sporting ripped black jeans with studs in various constellations. He was very tall. Almost eerily tall with pale white skin. But the weirdest thing about him, were his eyes. They were large onset almonds and their centers were bowed. His pupils almost looked like mouths, gaping black holes that are swallowing everything they see inward.

"Hey would you-"

"Sorry, I'm not a citizen."

"What?"

I held up my hand, "I can't sign the form. I'm not an American citizen," I lied. "And usually those things need citizenship right? Some kind of vote or something? Sorry about that." I tried to hurry along.

"Oh you don't have to sign anything. We're out here looking for members."

I looked at the gray jumpsuits, "What are you, like a cult or something," I joked.

"Yes."

I turned to look at the big guy, he didn't move a muscle.

"No way. We don't have cults here. It would be in the paper. You," I started checking their arms and backs for a cross or a bible, "You guys are a fellowship or something right?"

"No, we're a collective. But it's easier saying cult."

"Come on, you're just trying to mess with me now. That's like saying I eat meat so it's easier to call me a murderer."

"Some people would think that, wouldn't they?"

"It would be legally incorrect. I didn't do any of the killing nor did I premediate it."

Adaline turned to the big guy, "Morgan was right."

"What? Whose Morgan."

"Our leader."

"Did he tell you to get me? Have you been following me?"

"Morgan saw you before we came."

"Oh," I cracked a smile. "That's a fucking good one. Listen, I hope you guys have a great day. I've got to get to class."

"No you're not."

"What?"

"You're not going to class."

"What are you talking about?"

"You have your laptop today, no test forms, and an ink pen. It's midterm week."

"Am I suppose to clap because you're observant? I'm not going to sign whatever it is that you want me to sign."

Adaline looked me straight in the face, "Why are you pretending to forget that we're a cult? Does it make you uncomfortable?"

"I thought you were a collective?"

"But you remember that it's easier saying that we're a cult. Perhaps Morgan was wrong. You're not who we are looking for."

Adaline turned and the big guy followed.

"I didn't want to join your cult anyways."

"Who said we were asking you to join?"

"What? Then why the hell are you talking to me? You two were the ones that approached me."

"We're looking for someone to be objective, an outsider to write down what they see. I told Morgan we could just get Cory to do it, he always wanted to be a journalist. But instead Morgan insisted that we chose you."

"How far did you guys even come? It can't have been nearby. I've heard how these things work. You make some faulty promises, then cut people off from outside communication, sex, drugs, I've listened to the podcasts. And it's always on some far away dinky nowhere, to isolate some gullible mother fuckers. So come on, where are you guys from?"

"Murieta."

"Bullshit."

"It's about 15 miles from here."

"I know where Murieta is."

"Also, we don't do any of that stuff. Everyone is free to come and go as they please. And we don't allow drugs on our property. Anyone can make love as long as it's consensual. Though our reasons for sex likely differ from yours."

"You guys really are a fucking cult. Maybe the worst one I've ever heard of. How do you keep anyone at all?"

"What do you mean?"

"With all those promises, you're sure to break one in the first week or so, before anyone can be indoctrinated. You're probably losing them as fast as you get them. No wonder you're out here blindly asking for recruits."

"No one has left in the 3 years that I have been there."

"Then you're holding them against their will. Ain't no other way. Or you're plying people with free sex. Drugs. Come on, marijuana is legal now. It's drugs right?"

"Why don't you come see for yourself?"

Gas was cheap back then, and this beat hanging around the coffee shop. "Fine. But I am only staying for a little bit. And I'm driving my own car and following you. If we go past Murieta, or in a direction that isn't Murieta, I'm going to keep driving to the nearest police station and report you two for leading me into a kidnapping."

"That's fine. Wouldn't want you to get a ticket for parking overnight."

I ignored her and ended up following them about an hour outside the city - mostly due to traffic, we pulled off the dirt road and headed toward a lodge at the end. There was a small pond not too far from it, and smaller wood cabins lining the rim of the water's edge.

Before I even got out of my car I could smell food being cooked somewhere.

"Smells good doesn't it," Adaline had appeared next to me.

"Shit," I slammed the car door. "I might have been completely wrong. Someone here just knows how to cook and no one wants to leave."

"Don't forget to tell Lidia that, she'd be livid and feed you even more. Until you can't walk."

Adaline led us past the lodge. Before we reached the water, the big guy diverted to the left and entered one of the wood cabins. The door creaked as it swung open and closed. I could hear the people in the cabins as we passed them; some laughter, some moans, and two excited voices about tomorrow.

"Come on, I want you to meet Morgan," Adaline opened a door to an unseemly cabin and walked inside.

This is where they fucking kill you I thought to myself. But still, I walked in. I don't know if it's because I'd have a story to tell at the coffee shop later, or if it was because there was just something about Adaline. She was like a video loading before it even plays, a still image with all the points of interest before knowing what would happen. All the right stuff.

Morgan made me feel quite different. I've never met anyone whose eyes made my head scream. It was the way she looked at me. There wasn't a definitive line to explain what caused a lump in my throat. She wasn't towering, but the way she moved, her muscles rippling underneath her skin, the way she was able to control her body was like clockwork.

I could see her mouth moving, but I couldn't hear a thing. Even her eyelids closed and open without a judder. I was a pile of rusted gears before her and she was a waterfall pinning the world beneath the force she exuded.

"Yes, it's great to meet you." I don't know why I blurted that out. I only noticed that no one had been speaking for several minutes. They were both standing around me, neither of their mouths were moving. Waiting. For me. For time to catch up.

"I've been waiting to meet you," she told me. "My name is Morgan Lais." Morgan turned, "So Adaline tells me, that you've agreed to observe us."

"What," I tried to gather myself. "I only stopped by to see how close it was. Can't believe that there's actually something out here like this. I'm surprised it isn't on the news. I watch the news often, almost all the time. Love the news. How long have you been here? Do you travel often and recruit as you move from place to place? That's how I'd do it. Hey is that how it's done? My grandma once told me about these people who drank Kool-Aid and, man, grandma has these cookies filled with raspberry centers that she'd always pull out whenever I went t-"

Morgan put her hand on my shoulder.

I wanted to fling her arm off. Tell her to not touch me. Be angry, but all I could muster, "You're a woman." I couldn't even bring myself to call her a girl. "There can't be many woman cult leaders."

"We're more of a collective."

"I've heard."

When she lifted her arm away from my shoulder. It was like letting the top off a 16 Oz plastic bottle of soda. I didn't explode because I hadn't been shaken, but the top gurgled with relief as the pressure subsided.

The ring of a large metal bell broke me from the moment.

"Looks as if dinner is ready." Morgan strode past me, no, glided, moved, just delineated the space and crossed it. And Adaline followed. Before the door swung shut I was right behind them. What was I supposed to do? Stay in the cabin alone?

We passed the pond and headed toward the back of the lodge. A young boy that couldn't have been more than 10 or 11 opened the door for us, he had on a beautiful grin. "Thank you Michael," Morgan put her hand on his shoulder as she went inside. I hadn't even noticed his shoulders were squared, not until they fell loosely at his sides after being touched. If he was alert the moments before, now he was calm.

There was a long hall with a few doorless entries on either side. We passed the kitchen and the aroma curled around my neck and plunged itself down my lungs. It was lighter than air and my feet felt as they were losing contact with the ground after each step.

"This is the banquet hall," Adaline showed me to a seat on the bench as Morgan continued walking to the end. I watched as their esteemed leader sat at a large chair raised on a slight platform. It reminded me that this was in fact a cult. "Come on, sit down. The others will be coming in after Quote."

"Quote?"

"It's where people can gather around and share."

"Share what?"

"Anything."

My head swiveled to the entrance as the doors cracked open and I heard the sounds of chatter spill into the banquet hall. I don't know what I was expecting, but I surely didn't think that there'd be a melting pot of people here. I sort of expected everyone to be the same. Or have the same look and feel, as cults often did. At least that was what I've gathered from watching television.

Instead they were of varying ages, colors, sexes, and backgrounds. I've been in public schools my entire life, but I have never seen a group of people, not even children, walk alongside each other with such a deleted perspective of social hierarchies as they moved together until the natural flow of the room split them into seats.

There was a guy who looked as if he could run the gridiron with his hand in front of him that could mow down 300lb beasts clad in armor. And yet here he was, in a gray jumpsuit that zipped up in the front, walking alongside his peers as if nothing separated them, not even his height. Meanwhile the boy next to him pulled on the loops around his waist, dragging the taller boy along as if they were together.

And a girl with glasses, long brown hair that was talking excitedly, had several heads near her - completely enamored with everything she was saying. Even the older man with whites in his eyebrows kept nodding his head in agreement. I couldn't help but stare at her and wonder what she was saying to create such captivation among the people who looked as if they had nothing in common other than their outerwear.

When everyone had sat down, I noticed the girl in front of me, "Hi, I'm Mika." She had long black hair and her hand was outstretched. I shook it. "Oh, damn. Sorry." She withdrew her hand quickly after our fingers crossed. "Forgot we're not supposed to do that."

"What?"

Adaline smiled, "Mika joined us about a week ago. 7 days, 9 hours, and 32 minutes."

"Can't do seconds huh," I chuckled.

"22, 23, 24, 25, see how tedious it is? 31, 32, 33."

"Oh come on, do me, do me," it was the shorter boy that had been dragging the captain of the football team.

"It's too long Jacob, and dinner is almost ready."

Without a fight Jacob smiled, "You're right. So, this the new recruit?"

"I don't plan on staying."

"Everyone stays after dinner," Jacob turned to Mika, "When did you know that you'd spend the night?"

"I don't think I ever knew. I walked into one of the cabins and fell asleep."

"Wait, you didn't call your parents," I asked. How could a girl like her disappear without anyone asking questions. Everything about Mika screamed middle class.

The others laughed. I could see Adaline trying not to smile.

"No, seriously. None of you bothered to tell anyone?"

"Hey! Mom!" It was the footballer.

A figure turned around from the table behind us, she couldn't have been more than 25. Beautiful. Stunning, if only the word could do her justice. "Yes Luthor?"

"I love you."

"I love you too."

She came over and embraced her long slender fingers on the sides of his face. I could see her collarbone beneath the flowing material on her body as he rested his head against her chest. She pulled out her nipple and guided his mouth toward it. Luthor closed his eyes and breathed peacefully as his lips covered her areola and filled his mouth with milk. I could see the fine lines in his throat contracting as he swallowed.

My entire body was screaming at me to run away. The ambient and cheerful voices and continued conversation didn't make any sense. I felt as if I could be bleeding to death in the center of this room, screaming for help, and be completely invisible.

What the fuck was wrong with these people.

I turned my shoulder ready to leave when a hush fell upon the room. I closed my eyes and pierced my lips, praying to fucking anything that they weren't looking at me.

"Don't touch her," Adaline whispered. "Or any of them."

"What," I hissed.

"There's only one rule at 7th Day. Don't touch people unless you know their status."

I slowly sat back down, "What are you talking about?"

"Free use, consensual, limited, one way, and none."

"What?"

"Everyone at 7th day has a preferred preference. We learn that preference before we interact. As you're new, I have to tell you, that Lidia's preference is none. And all those that follow her, are also none."

"Who?"

She came from the kitchen. Madonna. I had never used that word before and hardly knew what it meant. But it was every bit fitting. I knew that much. Her skin was so dark that it seemed to glow. Obsidian. The next word that comes to mind. And her eyes were vast pools of honey, so deep and clear that it reminded me of the sun rising.

Behind her followed several individuals in white aprons around their gray jumpsuits. They pushed stainless steel trolleys, each with two large ceramic pots and giant silver ladles.

I looked around and everyone was smiling. I couldn't tell if they were smiling at her, or the food. But not a head turned elsewhere.

Her helpers went down the long benched aisles and they poured the stew into the two bowls in front of everyone in the hall. A helper placed her ladle down at the center of the bowl to my left; then followed the curve of the ceramic with the back of the steel and withdrew it in a reverse motion. Another helper did the same to the bowl on my right. The two portions looking exactly the same.

In front of me were two spoons waiting for the bowls in front of me with their intoxicating smell that caused my mouth to water. I could feel the saliva pushing themselves from the gums in the back of my teeth where my wisdoms had been pulled. I could feel them secreting from my flesh as I gripped a spoon in my hand.

"Bob Ross, a beloved painter in the early 80s was a man of great peace. He was also a man capable of extreme violence, being a sniper for the United States military. Had this to say about the state of enjoyment." Morgan left her throne and walked down the center aisle, "After his wife had recently passed, he told the world, 'Gotta have a little sadness once in awhile so you'll know when the good times come. I'm waiting on the good times now.' We! Here at the 7th Day. Embody the realities in the same manner." Morgan puts both of her hands on a young woman sitting down before solemnly nodding.

"With your right hand," our heads turned to Lidia, "Use the right spoon and dip it into the left bowl."

I hear the clatter of utensils as others reached for their spoons. Mine was already carved into my hand.

"Now eat."

The sounds of nearly a hundred spoons hit the bottom of their bowls and lifted it into their mouths. I swallowed the excess saliva in my mouth so that I could taste this dish in all of its glory. The spoon touched my lips and immediately it burned, yet I forced my arm to stuff it down my throat.

My mouth closed around it and I nearly spat it out. It tasted rancid. My teeth rattled in my gum line as my body tried to spit out my tongue. It smelled delicious but tasted like pure sewage. It reminded me of this time when my friends and I decided to put a large sheepskin rug underneath an inflatable pool to soften the ground. When the pool was forgotten, and leaked dry as it punctured from the heat of the sun, the water cooked the fibers until they broke down into a gelatinous sludge under the plastic.

When we had finally peeled the pool from the ground, to get back our lease deposit, it was worse than death. To this day when I close my eyes, I can still smell it. The odor lodging into my nose, sleeping in my throat, coating the inside of my lungs forever.

The stew tasted how that smelled.

Several others coughed. I could see someone vomiting onto the table. A helper came and cleared him away. Leaving the vomit on the table. While the majority of the people in the room didn't even blink as  they swallowed. I turned to look at Mika, and I was glad to see her face winced as she withdrew the metal from her mouth. But when I watched her swallow, imagining the liquid going down her throat and into her belly. I nearly threw up.

Adaline put her spoon down, and with her left hand she picked up the other spoon.

"Now with the left spoon, dip it into the right bowl," Lidia's voice rung in my head. I was starting to feel dizzy. I tried picking up the spoon but threw it out in front of me after a second's thought.

"It'll help," Mika whispered to me. She picked up her spoon and dipped it into her bowl. "Trust me."

My hand reached once again for the spoon. I didn't care which hand it was in at this point. I felt as if I had been poisoned and the antidote was either in the next bowl or the next bowl would kill me dead. Either way, anything was better than this. I dipped my spoon in and took a mouthful before Lidia told us to eat.

I cried.

It wasn't like scrubbing my skin raw, in the corner, with a bristling brush as the shower ran. It was as if nothing was ever there before it. I could remember a smile that I had once. It was a forgotten memory that was suddenly unlocked again. It was the happiest moment in my life for no particular reason other than the fact that there was nothing to worry about. Not bills, or tomorrow. Not even judgement.

I plunged my spoon down to the bottom of that bowl as soon as the feeling started leaving me. I didn't know if anyone would stop me, so I jammed it down my throat. That feeling again. It was so warm.

It felt as if I were falling asleep in my father's arms when he didn't drink. I took another spoonful and ate again without being instructed. And saw it again, light beyond the curtain, setting. It disappeared so fast that I was plunged into darkness. I took another spoonful and took another bite. And it was just soup.

I looked around, confused.

No one was looking at me. Everyone was staring straight ahead. Their right spoon in their hands. Waiting. Embarrassed I put my spoon down and placed it on the left side. I used the same hand to pick up the right spoon and waited.

"Dip your right spoon into the left bowl."

We did as she instructed.

"Now eat."

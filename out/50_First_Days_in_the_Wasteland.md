I need you to read this and reread this as many times as it takes for you to get it memorized. I’m you from the past and this is my letter meant to keep us alive. I know you’re confused and probably just woke up in an abandoned building, unsure of how you got there but I need to to stay focused. We have a condition, every time we go to sleep we forget everything up till our senior prom. I can’t remember why, car accident maybe? Anyways, in a normal world we’d live our lives around family and friends to keep us safe. This is not a normal world, and it’s not even close to the world you remember. 

On February 9th, 2022, things rose out of the ground across the world. They are called Sixes and the city is probably crawling with them right now. You can’t hurt them, anything you throw at a Six will pass through it like it’s thin air so you have to stay hidden. Only go out at night, they are hard to see during the day, but at night they give off a faint blue glow. This is the most important part of this letter: do not look a Six in the eye. If you do, throw yourself off a building. Otherwise you’ll be one of them in six days. You should have mesh goggles hung around your neck, use them, you won’t be effected by a Six’s eye if you can’t make out what’s in them.

The longest you have stayed up is 48 hours -strike that- 74 hours and you need to use that time to complete three tasks. The first is to find water, you can’t know the last time you drank so you need to find bottles or a natural source of water. Second, you need to find food. You can go longer without food than water so if you have bad luck you can survive a cycle without eating. Even so, try your hardest anyway. Like I said, you can’t know the last time you ate. The third task is to find a safe place to sleep, your survival solely depends on you waking up, finding this letter and having time to read it. If you fall asleep in the trunk of a car with Sixes wandering around outside we are as good as dead. Find a place high up, Sixes can walk through walls but they can’t fly, you’ll be safe on a third floor.

I know this is a lot to take in but you being here to read this means that you are strong enough to get up and survive. You might think this is impossible but you have done it everyday since the first Six crawled out of hell. Everyday is your first day in the wasteland but you will learn and teach yourself until your next cycle. We will get through this, you are the result of every previous incarnation of yourself fighting to keep you alive. So keep us alive, for the next you.

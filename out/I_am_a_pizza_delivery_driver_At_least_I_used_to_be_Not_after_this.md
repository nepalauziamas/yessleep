For as long as i can remember, i've had insomnia. I simply couldn't fall asleep as easly as the rest of my family. Because i was always so tired, i was brought to many doctors, but all of them concluded that it was just the way i am.

Anyways, this insomnia didn't go away not even in my almost 20s. That's when i took the job as a pizza delivery driver. I specifically took the night shift, so that i wouldn't be wasting time at home and i could at least help some night owls, like me.

The shift was always kind of bland. All the deliveries were in the city and on the rare occasions i had to go further, it wasn't really a problem,as i actually enjoyed late night drives. Best thing is that there were almost no complaints ever. 

It was a night just like any other night and i was about to clock out of work, when we got a last minute delivery call. 2 large pepperoni pizza. The cook, who was the only co-worker i was with that late in the night quickly prepared them before giving me the address. 

I didn't recognize the name of the street, so i just assumed that it was a pretty far away location. And i wasn't wrong. I drove for about half an hour on a dirt road before i reached the destination. It was a hospital. Since it was pretty far away from the city, i figured that there was just staff working the night shift and they needed some extra energy. There was something familiar about the place. 

I parked my car and got out. Almost all of thr lights were off , exept for the ground floor lights. I walked on the path leading to the building and knocked. Almost immediately a nurse opened the door. There was something in the smile she had on her face. It was unnaturally wide. I handed her the pizza and she handed me the money. But as  i was taking the payment out of her hand she grasped my arm and pulled me inside. 

I was so surprised, that i didn't really react, just stood there with a blank face. I wanted to get out, but three staff members blocked the doors i had came through. In a semi-circle around me, about 10 people sat in rocking chairs. All of them had the same unnaturally wide smile. 

My brain just went numb. I could've never imagined that i would end in such a predicament. Suddenly, a glass-shattering scream came from one of the upstairs rooms. None of the staff seemed fazed. They all just stood there, smiling at me. 

"Time for dinner" they said and all got up at the same time. They started heading for the room the scream had come from. Even the people at the door. That was my chance. I  ran to the door and just crashed into it. It seemed that they locked it, because it didn't open right away, but i eventually got outside and headed for my car. I got in. 

Right before i started the engine, i took one last look at the building and saw someone in the window. One of my old coworkers was smashing himself against the window, trying to break through. He went missing a week before the incident and everyone thought that he quit. Now i see that he didn't. 

As i was backing away with my car the very same nurse that opened the door for me came running and screaming at the top of her lungs. But i couldn't understand what she was saying. 

I never drove home so fast in my entire life. I got to my apartment and locked the door, then locked myself in my bedroom. I did not close my eyes the whole night. I called the police next morning and they went to check my claims. They told me that the hospital looked as if it had not been used in decades, with all of its old machinery still in place. Only a thing was fresh: a pile of bones discovered somewhere on the second floor of the building. 

The bones were so clean, they were white and they didn't have a single trace of meat left on them. I am pretty sure that that was my ex co-worker, Ted. 

The next week, i got a box in the mail. It wasn't big or decorated in any way, it just said "PRESENT". Inside there was Ted's name tag and on the bottom of the box there was written in blood: "from your friends in St. Martin hospital. Say hello to your sister from us." My sister died in a hospital with that name six years ago. Then i heard a knock on the door

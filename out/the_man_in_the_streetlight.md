i wish i could forget this night, yet it still replays in my mind every day. He won’t leave me alone. i think i belong to Him. 

during the fall of 2021 i (f) was walking alone at night. i decided taking a walk at 1am was no big deal since i live in a small town where everyone knows everyone. i was wrong. 

there was a street i seen after walking for maybe 15 minutes. the name was “ferry st” it was off of a main road in my town. i wondered why i’d never seen it before. so i turned onto ferry street to see what it was. 

it was fine at first, just a normal side street. but as my eyes gazed to the streetlight the to left, i saw it. Him. He was only there for a second. i thought i was seeing things so i kept walking. but as i looked at the next streetlight on the right i saw it again. this unrecognizable figure. it looked around 6’5 and slim. it looked almost human. but again, it went away. 

i was going to turn back but i told myself it was just late and i was just tired. i should’ve turned back. this street seemed to go on forever. i looked over as i felt something watching me. the hairs on my whole body stood straight up. 

there it was again. or there He was again. i wasn’t sure if it was human. this time, He was there for a couple seconds, staring at me. there was something off about Him. His neck was crooked and legs were bent inwards. 

i wanted to turn back but before i knew it my legs betrayed me and i walked quickly forwards. something gravitated me toward this being. 

at the next streetlight i looked right, nothing. i looked left and there, standing right under the streetlight, Him. my heart raced and i felt like i was going to throw up. my legs were stuck to the ground. He kept getting closer but His legs weren’t moving. it was like He was levitating. 

once He was about 15 feet away i heard a low growling. it got louder as He got closer. 13 feet away. 10 feet away. as He reached the 7 feet mark i could see His face. what was left of it at least. half of it was torn and ripped. the other half was like leather. 

His eyes were small and dark. mouth was thin and He had no emotion. he got a foot closer and my legs came back to me. i turned and ran as fast as i could. 

the growling got louder. louder. louder. and then i felt a hand, His hand, moving up my back onto my shoulder. i kept running until the hand fell off and i reached the end of ferry street. 

i looked back. nothing. ferry street wasn’t there. as if it had never existed. i ran back home and locked all the doors. i couldn’t sleep. i kept seeing that face when i closed my eyes. my eyes darted to the window and i saw Him. one split second then He was gone. I’ve been seeing Him for months and can’t get rid of Him. it’s only a matter of time. redditors, please help me.

I want to tell you that I set my foot down, that I confronted my wife about the camera or about her damn parents being ass naked in our bedroom. But I didn't. Whatever hold she had on me, it only seemed to have gotten stronger; I was addicted to her scent, body, and aura like I had never been addicted to anything before. 

 As I lay panting after enough intense session, sweat rolling down my face, Patience stood looking at her nude form in the mirror, her own face free of any blemishes or imperfections. I saw her sneakily adjust one of her perfume bottles on the dresser; There was a camera hidden behind it. I felt my stomach twist and clenched my fists. I sat up, trying to gather my voice to speak up, but Patience spoke first. 

 "We have a party to go to tomorrow night. It's my sister's birthday, she'll be expecting us." 

 I screwed up my face in confusion. "Patience...what the hell are you talking about? You don't have a sister." I felt woozy, out of it, nauseous. I could barely focus on my wife as she turned to face me, a devilish grin on her face. 

 "Of course I do silly! Don't you remember Amelia? She was at our wedding and everything! She even babysat Jimmy for us the other day." In my weakened state, I wondered if I was indeed mistaken; What if Patience really did have a sister? Of course she did, I had met her countless times over the years...right? *Right*, a woman's voice seemed to whisper in my ear, and I swear I felt a hand run down my back even though no one was there. 

 My favorite shirt and pants were too big for me so I went to the mall to get some new clothes for the party. Walking around, I couldn't help but feel as though everyone was watching me; The old lady sitting at the food court, the little kid that stopped playing with his friends to stop and stare at me, the workers in one of the stores going deathly quiet from their chatty conversation as I entered the fitting room. I began to wonder if I had been drugged; Was I paranoid, or was everyone seemingly interested in me lately? What kind of drug could make a man feel this way? 

 The door to the fitting room swung open, slamming against the wall just as I was pulling off my pants. "Fuck!" It was Patience, wearing a tight black dress and a choker, her eyes full of sexual intent. I could have sworn that I'd locked that door...

 "Jesus, you scared me! What are you doing here?" 

 "You know what I want," she said, and then began unzipping her dress right there in the doorway. 

 "Patience have you lost your mind? There are people right the-" She was kissing me, slamming me against the wall. My pants were already off so there was no need for any extra work on her part. As I found myself giving in, relinquishing everything to her once again, I became vaguely aware of everyone in the shop standing and staring. Their eyes were black, but they were all smiling, enjoying the show that they were getting.  I can't say why or how, but it didn't bother me anymore; I bent Patience over and took her right there, the sounds of the low, almost sensual chanting seemingly giving me energy that I didn't have. I yelled out like a wild animal as I finished, and then my vision left me and I found myself surrounded by darkness once again. 

 When I came to, I was sitting on a red velvet couch, a plate of grapes, cheese, and pineapple on my lap. There was a live band playing violins, and there were dozens and dozens of people walking around, all of them wearing black. 

 "You alright there, buddy?" 

 I turned to my left, still confused as fuck, and saw my father-in-law Bill standing with a striking young woman I did not recognize. Her hair was black, her eyes a vivid green that seemed to be staring directly into my soul, completely invading whatever personal space I had left. 

 "Uhhh, yeah, I'm fine. Is there a bathroom here?" 

 "No, they just shit on the floor," chuckled Bill, and, though no one else was around us or even paying us any attention, they all laughed anyway. Though I felt like Bambi standing up for the first time, I forced myself to set my plate to the side and set off to find the bathroom. There were so many people, and the house was so big; I could see open doors that led into a huge verandah in the backyard, where even more people were standing, socializing and drinking. I needed to avoid alcohol; Hell, I knew deep down that I needed to avoid every single person in this strange house that I had never been in in my life. 

 I stumbled through the house, a few people stopping to look at me as though I was a rabbit and they were hungry foxes. Where was Patience? How had I gotten here and not remembered? Everything about this was fucked. I hoped I wouldn't end up that way as well. I finally found an ornate door that I hoped led to a bathroom. I needed to gather my thoughts and figure out how I was going to get the hell out of there. Plus I needed to puke. As I pushed open the door, however, I found the raven-haired young woman standing right behind it, a knowing grin on her face. I stared at her in disbelief; There was absolutely no way that she could have beaten me here. No way at all...unless maybe I really was losing my grip? 

 "I...I need to use the bathroom." 

 She cocked her head. "Go ahead. No one's stopping you." 

"Who are you...where am I..." 

 "Oh come on, you know me! I'm Amelia, Patience's cousin. Are you fucking me?" 

 My vision was going in and out, Amelia going from a beautiful woman to a haggard, hunchbacked figure with warts, horns and wings indiscriminately. 

 "What did you just say?" I asked, closing my eyes and shaking my head. 

 "I said...are you fucking with me? Are you okay, hun?" 

 She laid a warm hand on my face. I opened my eyes and saw that she was very close to me now. 

 "I'm...I'm fine, I just need to..." 

 Amelia smiled. "I know what you need." She took me by the hand and led me up a grand staircase. She took me to a room that was lit with the light of what seemed to be a hundred candles; Black candles that burned with blue flame. When I saw the large, circular red cushion on the floor, I shook my head. 

 "I need to find my wife..." 

 "I'm your wife tonight." Amelia shoved me with incredible strength and I landed hard on the cushion. As I looked up at her, watching her disrobe, more people began filing into the room. What the fuck was going on here? 

 "Look, I don't know who you are or what you're doing but...I have to go, I need my wife..." 

 I felt a hand touch my chest from beside me on the cushion. It was Patience, already completely naked. Had she been laying here the whole time? 

 "It's okay, baby...we want this. Nothing would please me more than to watch you fuck Amelia's brains out. Can you do that for me? Can you?" 

 The room was still filling up. People were dancing, laughing, some of them even tearing their clothes off. Though the band was still downstairs, their music seemed to be swelling up in the room, their notes having gone from slow and somber to fast and achingly passionate. Amelia was biting her lip, staring down at me with her hands flexing softly. 

 "Go on," my wife purred, nudging her head against my neck and biting me. "She's all yours." 

 I watched as Amelia began to stroll towards me, dropping to her knees on the cushion. This wasn't right...these people shouldn't be here, I shouldn't be here...

 With the last iota of whatever strength I had left, I leaped up, knocking over several candles in the process. A few of the people in the room screamed in complete agony, shriveling up and turning into soft, weird fleshy slabs of meat. I didn't know if I was hallucinating or if any of this was real; I didn't care. I just had to get out. I ran towards the only window in the room and right through it, the night air enveloping me, the ground two stories below coming at me fast and hard.

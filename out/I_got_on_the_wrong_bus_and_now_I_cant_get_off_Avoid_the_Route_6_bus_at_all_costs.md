I should have noticed the red flags, but I was running late. I typically take the Northbound 2 for seven stops to get home from work, but tonight when I hurried to the bus stop the 2 was already pulling away. *Shit*, I thought. During the day another bus follows every ten minutes. But at 8PM the route switches to a half-hour schedule, and that's only if there aren’t any of the delays our city's transit system is notorious for. I'd tried to time leaving work with that in mind, but security stopped me on the way out, costing me the few minutes that made me miss the bus. I sat down, resigned to the idea that I'd be much later than I'd anticipated. 

To my surprise another bus approached almost immediately. A red 6 flickered on the LED screen on the front, red flag numbers one and two. The numbers on our bus system are always a greenish yellow, but this 6 was a deep crimson. And I'd never heard of Route 6. There's 1 through 5 and then A through G depending on whether your route is mostly north/southbound or east/westbound. 

I didn't spend much time considering any of this at that point though. I was too wrapped up in my desire to get home. Any other day and I would have waited the half-hour for another 2. But today is my anniversary and I have been planning on surprising my wife. We've had a bit of a rough time lately, so much so that we didn't officially plan anything for tonight. This last year I've been regularly working until well after 10 at night, a serious point of contention in our marriage. My wife had come to expect that from me, so as late as getting home around 9 would have been, it still would have been uncharacteristically early for me. 

Careful to tuck the present for my wife under my arm, I approached the bus as the doors hissed open. The bus driver was ancient. His face hung with loose skin that gave him the appearance of melting in slow motion. He didn't look at me, just stared straight ahead at the road. His eyes were so sunken in that from the side they resembled black pits. If you're thinking that was red flag number 3, you'd be wrong. All the bus drivers around here look that way. I can't remember the last time I took a city bus that didn't have a driver who gave me the sense that they were completely dead inside. 

“I usually take the 2,” I said. “Will this get me where I need to go?” 

He nodded, still not looking at me. I hurried on, tapping my metro pass as I entered. I was already hurrying to a seat in the middle when I realized I'd just missed red flag number three. I hadn't mentioned which stop I needed to get to but he’d answered anyway. 

I brushed it off and set my wife's present down on the floor. Although no two routes hit all the same stops, I told myself the bus driver's nodding likely just meant that there was a decent amount of crossover. I might have to walk a bit more in the stifling humidity than I would have liked, but I had already sweat through my shirt at that point, so it wouldn't matter all that much. 

Though I was staring out the window, I was so lost in thought that I wasn't paying attention. I was running through how I hoped things would go once I got home. As I mentioned, my wife and I have had a bit of trouble lately. Mostly my fault. The late nights have really been only a symptom of the deeper problem of disconnection. Somewhat of a workaholic, I'm not always present, even when I am home. Conversations with my wife started getting sparser to the point that we barely acknowledged each other. Things got so bad, I had moved out for a bit. Partially to give her space, and partially because I found I couldn't sleep in the bed where I know... where "it" happened. I don’t blame her for seeking refuge from her lonely nights, but it’s still hard to let go of. 

A few days ago I had told her I was ready to move back in, and tonight was my chance to prove just how committed I still am. As I had told her on the phone, when I said my vows I meant them. I wanted to recapture the spark we used to have. To reignite the flame we had felt so long ago and lost over years of falling into routines and taking each other for granted. 

The squeal of the bus's brakes snapped me out of my trance. I looked up to see a man in a gray business suit limp onto the bus. He was bleeding and mangled, one of his legs bent out of shape. He looked like he needed an ambulance, not a bus. My first thought was perhaps he didn't have insurance, but a look at his Rolex made me reconsider his ability to afford an ambulance ride regardless of his healthcare situation. He sat down across from me, nodding as he did so. He removed a small bottle of whiskey from his coat and took a long pull. In his good hand he clutched a set of keys, and I could clearly see the BMW logo on them. 

*Maybe he's been in some sort of accident and isn’t thinking clearly*, I thought, but I knew better than to engage. The characters on these buses aren't usually the types of folks you want to draw attention from. I've seen normal-looking people turn suddenly violent towards someone for asking them to move over a seat. But I couldn't help noticing the man had started to dig the car key into his good leg so hard that he pierced the fabric. The gray slacks bloomed red around the key. 

I quit counting the flags at that point and started to get nervous. There had been no other passengers on the bus when I got on, not uncommon for this time of evening. And strange behavior from other passengers was nothing to scoff at, although this man's behavior was well beyond that. But what really scared me was the sight out the window. 

Everything looked both familiar and unfamiliar. The buildings had the appearance of those in our city, but I didn't recognize this part of town at all. We were far enough from the heart of downtown that I should have been able to see the skyline behind us, but it wasn't there. Though it's the time of summer when the sun still sets fairly late, the sun was higher than it should have been, hidden behind a deep mist. When I stepped on the bus, the sky had been a deep purple that should have faded to black by now, but the sky had a dull orange hue to it instead. It reminded me of news footage of Los Angeles when there's a bad wildfire nearby. Like the sky itself was burning.

I stood and walked to the front of the bus. I studied the transit map on the wall near the driver's seat, recognizing the routes I'd seen so many times before. But I didn't see a Route 6. 

"Does this bus stop near Ferrington and Wallace?" I asked the driver. He nodded, but I got the sense he wasn’t actually listening. 

I went back to my seat and checked the time on my phone. It felt like we'd been riding for only fifteen minutes, but I was shocked to see well over an hour had passed. I decided to call my wife and let her know where I was. After all, it was seeming more likely that I might need to get her to pick me up. The phone went straight to voicemail. I tried again. Same outcome. Oh well, guess the surprise wouldn't be ruined quite yet. 

I planned to get off at the next stop and try to find my way to a different bus from there. I pulled the cord to alert the driver I wanted to get off, and he stopped almost immediately. I hadn't even seen a stop, but when I looked out the right side window, one had materialized. 

I carried my wife's present with me as I got off and watched the bus pull away. I opened maps on my phone, but it couldn't get a location. The blue dot representing me jumped around. I was freaked out at this point. The entire area appeared apocalyptic, shrouded in a red hazy fog. There was no one on the sidewalks, no cars on the street. Even outside the city, the streets stay congested for a bit longer. I noticed a pay phone nearby and figured I could try calling my wife from that since I was still hoping the issue was my phone. 

Digging through my pockets I found a quarter and inserted it. I didn't think there were any pay phones left in the country. It felt like using an ancient relic. 

"Hello?" my wife answered on the first ring. Her voice was distant, like she was underwater. 

"Carolyn? It's me." 

"Hello? Is someone there?" she said. 

"Carolyn? Can you hear me?" 

"Who is it?" said a voice that sounded familiar. *Where had I heard that voice?* 

My wife's response turned my blood cold. "Oh Jesus, David, you scared me. I didn't hear you come in." 

David was *my* name. 

Someone was in my home, pretending to be me. My head reeled. 

"No clue who it is," said my wife. "Must be a wrong number." 

"That's not me!" I screamed, but my wife had already hung up. 

I had to get home. Now. Someone or something was trying to steal my life. I had to save my wife from him. As I prayed for a bus to stop soon, I thought about the stranger in my house. *Would he try to sleep with my wife tonight? Would he tell her all the things I had told her as if he were truly me?* 

The sound of an approaching bus made me look up. *Thank God*, I thought, but my stomach sank as I saw the red 6 flickering on the front. The same fucking bus. The same fucking driver. 

This time I noticed something else. At first I had thought the 6 was blinking like the LED lights couldn't stay on, but now I realized it was actually moving horizontally in a brief pattern that repeated. After three blinks it went back to the beginning. I realized it wasn't Route 6 at all. It was spelling out a longer number. 

6 \_ \_

\_ \_ 6

I stayed put. The driver waited. I expected him to leave, but he didn't. He sat there staring straight ahead. I felt something behind me in the fog. Some dark presence that made my skin crawl. I knew I wasn't alone out here and I sensed that whatever it was was pure evil. *Do I wait here and risk whatever's out there coming for me, or do I take my chances on the bus*, I wondered. I decided the bus was the lesser of the two evils and got back on. 

The man in the suit was still there, but now there were two new passengers. I tried not to look directly at either, but I couldn't help it. The first was a teen in all black except for the camouflage ballcap on his head. His hoodie was pulled tight over his head, his face obscured in shadow. He had a notebook out, holding his fountain pen like a knife as he scribbled furiously. He wasn't so much writing as carving words into the pages. 

Nearby sat a woman who looked to be on a lot of drugs. Her lips were blue, her skin pale. She rocked back and forth, holding an empty baby seat that dripped muddy water on the floor as if she'd pulled it from a lake. She mumbled to herself. I tried to make it out as I passed by. 

"My baby... so fast... too fast... growing up so fast... too fast... I hate it when they grow up." 

My breath quickened. I turned and looked towards the front of the bus. Now from this perspective, I could see the teen in the hoodie had a gaping hole in the back of his head. 

When I looked directly at the bus driver in the rear view mirror, I choked out a quiet sob. His eyes had looked like pits when I first got on because that's exactly what they were. They were empty sockets, not bloody and gory but the blackest black I have ever seen in my life. 

I sat back down, shaking, trying to understand. Trying to figure out what to do. I got on the wrong bus. I never should have gotten on this bus. There was something wrong with the people on this bus. Not only did I suspect they were dead, I got the sense that they had each done something horrible to end up on this bus. But I had done nothing. I didn't belong. 

I took out my phone and began writing this. I’m praying that these words will somehow make it out into the world. That someone will see this and tell my wife how much I love her. That I am not going to stop fighting for her. 

My wife and I were going to fix things before this. When I'd decided to return home, I called her on the phone. She told me it was over. She cried and asked for my forgiveness. She said she never meant for it to happen, but it did and we couldn't change it. We couldn't go back, not really. "No," I had told her. "We'll move forward. I'll come home." 

I promised I would come home. I intend to keep that promise, no matter what it takes. 

As I type this, the bus is slowing. *Oh sweet Jesus*. I recognize this stop. This stop is my usual stop. The bus driver wasn't lying after all. I knew there had to have been a mistake. 

I knew there had been a mistake because I've done nothing wrong. Nothing worse than the next person. Sure, I had gotten angry. I had yelled. I had refused to accept that we had different ideas of moving forward even when my wife said she was blocking my number after we hung up. I had refused to accept that she didn't want me coming home. But what did she expect, sharing our bed with someone who had taken everything from me? Who had stolen my life? Who even had the same name as me? Did she not feel weird saying MY name when HE was with her? 

The bus driver is waiting for me to gather my things and get off. It won’t take long. All I brought with me is the present for my wife. A shiny red canister full of something special.

She's going to be so surprised. Her new lover too. 

It's my anniversary and I know how to get the spark back. 

I know exactly how to reignite that old flame. 

It's so strange. 

I thought I had gotten on the wrong bus. 

Now I think I was just early.

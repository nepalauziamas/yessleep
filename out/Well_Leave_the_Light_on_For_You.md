In my nearly three decades of experience in building maintenance, repair, and renovation, I’ve never worked at a place as unusual as the local Motel 6. It wasn’t all that weird as a structure; if you’ve seen one Motel 6 you’ve pretty much seen them all. The building is squat, two-stories, a few dozen rooms all stacked horizontal like a mouthful of teeth. Probably the most interesting thing about the Motel 6 I worked at is that it’s isolated, miles away from the nearest town sitting all on its own off the highway. 

Now the other peculiar thing about the Motel 6 you wouldn’t know unless you worked there: management was terrified of the lights ever going out. We had **two** backup generators on-site. One generator was diesel, the other some fancy solar thing. Given how remote the motel was in location, I could understand having a good back up but two generators was excessive. Then again, everything about that place was excessive in the first year I worked there. 

The manager–a fussy, middle-aged guy named Owen–insisted that maintenance check and swap out all lightbulbs on the property each month. As soon as we finished up with the hall lights we needed to move on to the guests and by the time those were done, me and Mikey (he’s the other maintenance guy), had to hurry up to stay on schedule for the stairwell lights. 

I never made the connection between Owen’s obsession with lights and generators with Motel 6’s official slogan until the night of our first true blackout. If you’re unfamiliar with Motel 6’s advertising, they have a very famous tagline they use in all their commercials. 

*We’ll leave the light on for you.* 

Cute slogan; makes it seem like you’re staying in a friend’s home instead of a generic, LEGO block of a motel where the towels smell like sweat and the parking lot lamps attract drug users like moths to a candle. You can probably tell I don’t have the fondest feelings for my former employers at Motel 6, but after I tell you what happened the lights went out, I think you’ll understand. It all started with a week of nasty storms we got last year. 

This was back in January so we didn’t have a ton of guests. I think, at the time of the…incident, maybe twenty rooms were occupied. Or maybe thirty. We’d gotten eight days straight of first rain, then slush, then snow. Owen was worried that the wind might knock the lines down and we’d be stuck. All of the cloud cover meant the solar generator would be useless so the boss sent Mikey to make sure the diesel cans were full in case we needed the other power source. Sure enough, on the ninth night of crappy weather, the lights began to flicker. 

I remember that I was in the back office working on maintenance logs. The office was cramped and it didn’t help that I’m a big guy. I was just about to file some purchase requests for tools when the flickering began. Not two seconds later, Owen ran into the room. 

“We need the generator up and running, Logan. Now!” he demanded. 

I sighed and picked up my radio from the desk. “Hey Mikey, this is Logan, do you copy?” 

“What’s up, bossman?” Mikey replied. 

“Hey Mikey, I’ve got Owen here with me. Looks like the snow might knock out our-” as if on cue, the lights flickered again and came back much dimmer- “shoot, yeah, I think we’re about to lose electricity. Can you go ahead and fire up the diesel so we can keep the lights on?” 

There was a pause on the other end of the radio. Not the usual Mikey losing attention kinda pause but the sort that let know he was trying to think up an excuse. 

“We might, uh, have a problem there, boss,” Mikey said. All of the blood drained from Owen’s face at Mikey’s reply. “Can you meet me in the generator room?” 

We left the office and hurried through the parking lot. It was snowing hard and Owen nearly slipped on some hidden ice, grabbing for my arm to keep from falling. We crossed over to the small maintenance building and hurried inside. Mikey was already sitting on the diesel generator when we walked to the small back room. He had a sheepish grin that was more of a wince than anything. 

“Now, I’ll tell you the issue with the generator,” Mikey promised, holding up his hands, “but first you have to promise not to be mad.” 

Before I could reply, the lights flickered a third time and went black. Owen screamed from somewhere behind me. I reached into my jacket and pulled out a flashlight. Mikey did the same. 

“We need to get the lights back on,” Owen shouted. 

I made my way over to one of the shelves in the room and rummaged around for a moment, then pulled out a few emergency lanterns I knew we had in storage. Once those were active, the back room was bright and almost cozy. Even with the return of the light, Owen didn’t look relieved. 

“We have to hurry,” he told me, clutching a lantern to his chest. “We only have a few minutes before it’s too late for the guests.” Owen turned to Mikey. “What is wrong with the generator?” 

“So here’s the thing,” Mikey replied, looking down at his feet. “The generator is fine but we’re out of diesel. I’ve been…borrowing the fuel for my truck and replacing it with water. I figured it’s just a loan, you know, and not an issue since I’m the one who always does inventory on that kind of thing.” He looked up at me. “Sorry, bossman.” 

I was angry but it really was typical Mikey behavior, so I wasn’t surprised. Owen, on the other hand, was baring his teeth, his fear turned into what looked like hateful rage. 

“You idiot, you absolute moron,” Owen spat at Mikey. “There’s no fuel? The guests have been in the dark now for,” he checked his watch, “more than three minutes. Complete, total dark. Do you get it? They could start turning any-”

Owen was interrupted by the most savage scream I have ever heard coming from inside the Motel 6. The three of us looked at each other, then Owen sprinted for the door to the maintenance room. Owen locked and bolted the door then began trying to push a table against it as a barricade. 

“Help me before they realize we’re here,” Owen hissed. 

Mikey and I moved to help him push furniture in front of the door. There was another shriek from the Motel then another then what almost sounded like howling. 

“They’ll start with each other,” Owen whispered. “Once some of them get into the parking lot, they’ll try the door. We need to stay quiet.” 

“What is going on?” I asked.

Owen sat on the floor with his back against the door barricade. He set his lantern down and gestured for all of us to join him. 

“I’ll tell you everything,” he whispered. “But this has to stay secret. I’d lose my job if corporate found out…but we’re in this mess now so you deserve to know.” 

The three of us sat in a circle as Owen spilled his guts. All Motel 6s have a terrible design flaw. Or maybe a curse or an intentional defect created to experiment on people. Everything was safe as long as lights were on in or around the building, but if the motel ever experienced true darkness for just a few minutes, it would begin to alter the minds of all inside. 

“The effects, I’m told, are rapid and…extreme,” Owen explained, occasionally glancing over his shoulder at the door. “Think of it like a form of rabies.”

Someone began pounding on the maintenance door. Several someones, based on the thunder-rattle of fists against metal. Owen held one shaking hand to his mouth, finger to his lips, signaling for us to be silent. It felt like the thudding lasted for hours but it was probably only five minutes. Whatever was outside lost interest or gave up. Everything was silent. 

The three of us began to argue in whispers still sitting in our little ring around some lanterns. Mikey and I wanted to call the police immediately. Owen begged us not to. He figured the damage was already done and if we got the cops involved, it could cause terrible press for Motel 6. 

“That’s the kind of bad PR that gets people like us *silenced*,” Owen added, with a cut-throat gesture. 

The decision was made for us when I took out my phone. We didn’t have great reception at the motel even in clear weather but the constant snow storms had completely killed the signal. We were cutoff. Owen figured we could wait the chaos out and that all of the guests should be gone or…well, they shouldn’t be dangerous after a few days. The maintenance building was cold–basically a giant garage without the best insulation–but we would survive. There was no food but at least we had running water from the bathroom in the back. That is, we *did* have running water until the pipes froze that first night. We huddled together sleeping on the floor, using tarps for blankets, then woke up the next morning hungry, thirsty, and freezing. 

We listened carefully for the better part of an hour before deciding to risk it. The three of us quietly took down the barricade from the door and unlocked it. I was the first to step outside. Snow drifts lay heavy across the parking lot and flakes still fell gently from the clouds above. We crunched through the fresh powder single file towards the motel. We were halfway across the lot when the first “guest” spotted us from her perch on top of a car. She was a blonde woman, probably in her thirties, and only wearing blood-stained pajamas. One of her eyes was ripped out and hanging from the nerve. Her hands and bare feet were beginning to turn blue from frostbite. When the guest noticed us, she growled and came sprinting, slipping and snapping her teeth. 

“Run!” Owen shrieked. 

We took off in three different directions moving as fast as we could through the heavy snow. More mutilated guests came pouring out of the Motel 6. I saw a man with fishhooks pushed through his face chasing after Mikey with a baseball bat. Two women in shredded nightgowns went after Owen; they ran on all fours like beasts. Only one guest came after me, a teenager by the look of him. His ear was ripped off at the root and a maroon streak of blood was frozen against his cheek. He had madness in his eyes and a butcher knife in his hand. 

I’ve never run so fast. I was wheezing and puffing through the snow by the time I reached a nearby treeline. That was the first time I allowed myself to turn around. My pursuer was gone, probably joining in the hunt for one of the others. I heard a long scream. It was hard to tell at that distance with the wind blowing but…it sounded a lot like Mikey. 

I spent the next hour navigating through the woods until I finally reached a clearing where my phone could get a signal. The 9-1-1 dispatcher was calm and professional until I mentioned the words, “Motel 6.” She got quiet then and put me on hold so that she could speak to her supervisor. A few minutes later, she returned to the line and directed me to head north until I hit the highway and to keep my phone on so they could track my GPS. After another hour of trudging through the snow, the woods thinned ahead of me and I saw the road. A police cruiser was waiting for me. They drove me back to the station, gave me coffee and a blanket, then asked me to wait in an interview room. 

Twenty minutes later, two men in gray suits came into the room with me. They were with Motel 6 and offered me more money than I’d make in a decade to sign a few papers, non-disclosure agreements, and to agree not to talk to reporters about what I, “thought,” I saw at the motel. I took the money, God forgive me, but I told myself it wouldn’t matter once the media caught wind of the massacre at the Motel 6. The story would be huge and the company would pay for allowing guests to stay in that kind of danger. 

Only…the story never got out. Somehow, Motel 6 covered it up. They staged unrelated accidents, tragedies–even suicides–for all of the guests who died there. I read Mikey’s obituary a week later. They said he died in a “car crash.” 

I don’t know how they hushed it up but they did. Now every day, I wonder if I’ll be the last loose end they decide to cut. I’m breaking all of the contracts they had me sign but the truth needs to get out. If you ever stay at a Motel 6, make sure they really do leave a light on for you…[because violence and madness wait](https://www.travisbrownwriting.com/)[ in the dark.](https://www.travisbrownwriting.com/)

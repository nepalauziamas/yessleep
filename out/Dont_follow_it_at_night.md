This happened in my freshman year of college(2018). I am currently 22f and still creeped out. I was 18 and it was about 10 pm, my (now ex)boyfriend and I had just fought, he had called me a bitch as sincerely as possible so I went outside the dorm for some air. I was staring off into the night when a grey cat not more than 4 years old appeared. 

The dorm faces a street that goes straight for a short distance then comes to a T with a gas station at each corner. Before that is an old abandoned highschool with the gym still in use for exercising classes and a floor or two of the highschool used for other classes. 

Back to the cat: there used to be many stray cats wandering the campus and some people would feed them and it was fun and a cute aspect of the campus, so this cat seemed ordinary. It was meowing and kept turning walking and meowing like it was wanting me to follow. As soon as I was about to get up to do so, my boyfriend came outside to apologize. I cut him off and turned his attention to the cat, and convinced him to come with me to follow. I went to pet the cat(kinda stupid looking back) and I felt soft fur and a wall of hard bumps on its face, almost felt fake. 

We followed the cat to almost the far side of the gym when I felt a chill go up my spine. This is a small half ghost town with quite a history and the streets were not very well lit off main campus. The cat kept meowing and looking back to see if we were following and I blindly did until that corner. Around that corner was a stretch of yellow street lamps and the railroad tracks. I took a deep breath, followed and beckoned my bf to follow. 

After following for a few more minutes we came to the tracks, facing forward the track went ‚Äô \ ‚Äòa bit steeper though and past the yellow street lamp was a dark green hedge in the middle of a dark stretch between this and the next streetlight. Another detail was a small abandoned company call ‚ÄúPyramid Co.‚Äù and diagonal to that was an abandoned factory building in which I swore I saw a shadow in. My boyfriend remarked we should turn around and go back to the dorm. I agreed and started heading back. 

The cat started getting frantic and it meows starting turning into more frequently cut off meows to strained cries, thats when I decided to walk faster and not look back any more and a few seconds later, dead silence. We stopped mid step to look back and there was nothing but the dark street, crickets chirping, and the faint sound of cars on the highway. Thats when we ran, we sprinted to the safe white streetlight of the dorm and things were normal, people coming back from a late night snack shop, people laughing going to frat parties. 

I wanted to know what happened though so we went to his floor, second floor and sat on a two step stairway. I looked up the street ‚ÄúN Berrien St‚Äù and a crime page came up on Google. I clicked on it. ‚ÄúMan stabbed on N Berrien St‚Äù location was the hedge the cat was leading us too. I felt so many chills at that point and the automatic hall light switched off. But it was quiet hours and I was freaked the fuck out, with so many questions and refused to go back to my room I just stayed with him. Then the next day, there were less cats on campus and by the next year, they seemed to fully disappear, not a cat in sight in That city except for an occasional‚Äîgrey catü´†. I still hear its screeching from that night and I get chills every time.

Edit: I just looked up that street and only estate listing came up, you gotta be specific now which is also weird

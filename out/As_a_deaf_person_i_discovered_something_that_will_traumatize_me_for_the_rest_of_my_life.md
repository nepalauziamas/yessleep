Hello to whoever is reading this, I will introduce myself as "Anne" and I am currently 23 years old and I'm still recovering from the horrifying trauma that I experienced in Highschool 6 years ago. I would also like you to take note that I was born deaf so life has been daunting for me ever since. I am writing this now in a mental diary to keep myself sane in order to recollect my thoughts and past experience.

It all started when I first enrolled into John Catholic School. Its a popular educational institution in its Highschool form where Catholic ideology was enforced to us teenagers. I won't lie the school itself was mostly students who are atheists and the reason behind that is the mere fact that this Catholic School grants us a permanent seat to a University of our choice if our grades had excelled to its highest standard. I am also an atheists taking advantage of what this school has to offer. My parents on the other hand I would describe them as "Hard-core Catholics" as their entire lives and beliefs was based on a god in the sky (They really tried to convince me since day 1).

I'm only a curious girl yet reserved with a logical mindset that questions and demands every answers that are unknown and unsolved. Even God Himself and his heaven and hell. I am the type that needs proof of God's existence no matter what anyone says otherwise. This annoyed me since my parents will place posters of Jesus Christ in my room and I would have no idea who he is to begin with. As curious as I am denial of the belief, i actually read the entire bible but that only left me with more questions than answers but the stories and its teachings were quite brutal yet interesting since it contains parts of human history that most of were not included in its original records.

Since day 1 of attending John's Catholic School, it was quite daunting to make new friends since i introduced myself to everyone in the class that I am deaf. Luckily the teacher (named Sarah) that was assigned to my classroom has the ability to perform sign language which made my learning journey at school quiet bearable to say the least. However, the students I meet tend to always say something to me and on their faces I could observe their laughter as if the words they spat out were meant to insult me but this did not bother me at all. If I can't hear it then I wouldn't know, truly the saying ignorance is a bliss really sticks to me as a person. Being deaf isn't easy in-fact its quite terrifying. Hearing is one of the most important senses, the ability to hear and identify sound is a luxury that I never had. Because of this I am always late to classes or assemblies mainly because I spend most of my free time at school in the library and read comics or story books. It's literally a sanctuary for me as a deaf person.

Don't get me wrong, being deaf may prove disadvantage but it had helped me develop other senses that a normal person wouldn't have. Like a third eye being able to indicate if someone is nearby or approaching without seeing them. It's like a gut feeling but this is a sensory practice that I have developed ever since I was born so it came natural to me.

Life as a deaf high school student was typical for me, wake up 7AM, eat breakfast, pack lunch, go to school, attend social gatherings, study and procrastinate, go home, and sleep then the cycle repeats. This has been going on for almost 2 years and the only difference in my life during those 2 years was making new friends who share the same interests as me in books. Well.. One Friend though but that's good enough for me. I'm not very comfortable with large groups of people it only made me feel isolated simply because I wouldn't know what the heck they're saying. My friend whom I will call her "Kayla" is actually quite the opposite of me. She's very talkative, good looking and loves reading books as much as I do. I always see her with other girls and boys talking and eating together in the cafeteria.

But at some point in every recess/break she would visit the library and hang out with me by herself. Kayla does not know sign language like my teacher Sarah does but will always bring chunks of paper and pen to write a message for me to read. Our communication has a lot of delays writing words back and forth so Kayla couldn't have a chance to relay all her thoughts and questions every time. Don't get me wrong, she's not really my "Best" friend. Maybe not yet. she visits sometimes to only talk about the books we have read so far, she never really asked or initiated a conversation that I believe people call it "personal".

Anyways my boring life continued so forth until one morning I saw something that made my stomach wanted to curl up. On my way walking to school, I saw 3 tall men about 6'5 ft in black hoodies lurking near the front gate of our school simply staring at the students entering the school. At first I though they were some crack heads trying to look intimidating to make themselves feel superior but the odd thing i realised about them after observing was the fact that they are not doing anything. They are just standing and I don't think they are initiating a conversation to any of the students. So my mind thinks they're probably nothing more than old students who used to go to this school. My gut on the other hand is conveying to me that they are dark and sinister and I should avoid them at all times.

Suddenly one of their gazes has latched unto mine. In that moment one of the guys was pointing at me, slowly his right hand formed in what seemed to be an imitation of a gun. Then he points it slowly upwards as if he shot it with recoil. I do not know what kind of intentions these guys have but I know for a fact that it isn't anything good at all. I did not dare to go to the front gate where they are present and went to the back gate instead which is a bit of a longer walk but definitely worth to avoid trouble. At that point, I could only think about the 3 men lurking near our school and that only got me worried. I might be overthinking but my curious mind had led up to a lot of potential scenarios in the near foreseeable future of my encounters with them, just thinking about it got my primal instincts into "fight or flight mode".

When school has ended for the day  I described my experience and concerns to my homeroom teacher Sarah. There was a long pause between us but she reassured me saying that nothing will happen and stated that I was "Overthinking" about the whole situation since the 3 men have not done anything. I though Sarah would be right about this, but seriously my gut feeling screams "Danger" every time I think about those guys. After talking to Sarah, i decided to just brush it off and go to the library to collect some books to take home and get my mind off things. Upon entering the library, I saw Kayla sitting by herself reading a book. It was surprising for me as I though she would be the type of girl to just go to parties and drink herself till blackout, you know typical "social people" as I would vaguely call them.

I joined Kayla at her table and was delighted to see me. We simply greeted normally and I wanted to bring up my experience this morning to her. She was then curious about a long wall of text that I was writing for her to read. After finishing my message I immediately gave it to her. At first Kayla's face was in a happy motion as if she expected a review from a fantasy book I read earlier. Seconds later, Kayla's smile slowly fades into a horrifying look of realisation as her eyes widened and her breathing became abnormal for a few seconds. She began to shake a little and I quickly wrote to her stating "Is Everything Okay?". Kayla quickly glanced to my second message and looked back to my first one. She then quickly wrote something on the paper in response.

What Kayla wrote back to me had sent very cold chills to my soul.

"Do Not Go To School Tomorrow."

After Kayla wrote the message, with no further explanation on what she meant by this. She immediately ran out of the library. I had though that this was some elaborate prank upon me as a girl who is deaf but Kayla's reaction seemed genuine. But then I realised that a lot of people can fake their expressions in order to make a prank more "believable". But that message alone has invoked "Danger Alarms" in my gut and the feeling of dread has spread across my emotion factor in my mind. I was walking home that day thinking whether I should actually attend school tomorrow or not.

Whether it was a prank or not, I decided to play it safe and not attend at all. I told my parents that I was afraid to go to school tomorrow because something might happen to me. Of course they denied my concerns and told me to think nothing of it. I simply had no choice. Even if I were to fake any illness my parents would see through it as I had abused this method to ditch school in the past so basically my situation was a "Boy who cried wolf" moment.

I still kept the message that Kayla gave me earlier and looked at it for awhile lying on my bed. Based on my parents forcing me to attend school tomorrow. I concluded that Kayla may just be messing around with me in hopes to miss a day of attendance to lose my merits as an upstanding student for me to get to a better university as I was aware that my grades were far superior to Kayla's so she may have ulterior motives for being my friend and that her true intentions was to try to bring me down along with her.

As the night gets old, I had decided to just sleep it off in hopes that everything will be okay and that my gut can be wrong on certain situations. I then entered into a dream world where I see myself present in a long dark alley way. There was a tall dark figure with red eyes staring at me from a distance. My eyes widened with fear and made a "flight" response to my instincts. I tried to ran away from the figure hoping to gain some distance between us. When I looked back, the figure had already started to dart towards me and he is getting closer. And closer. Just when I could feel that the figure is right behind me I screamed at the top of my lungs out of dreadful fear. 

Somehow that woke me up at 6AM in the morning. Sweat was pouring from my head and I Had trouble breathing for a moment. For me it was my first nightmare in a sleep in 17 years.  "Oh its just a dream" i said. I got out of my bed and took a shower but as the water hits my head I could only think about the message that Kayla wrote for me. All this stress and fear got me worked up, but it is a new day so I counted to 10 and when it reaches 10 I will always be a calm and upstanding girl. 

1... 2... 3... 4... 5... 6... 7... 8... 9... 10....

I slapped my head together with the palm of my hands and made preparations to attend school as I usually do. It was still 7AM as an early hour because school usually starts at 9AM. I did not want to be late so I decided to walk to school early and stop by the library there and read my fantasy books to kill time. When I arrived closer to the school, there was that feeling again in my gut. A dreadful feeling and my instincts are screaming Danger. For a moment I couldn't move an inch. That's when I looked at the premises of the school and that's when I saw a suspicious looking black van parked closer to the back gate of the school. That's when I could see 2 guys wearing skull masks and full black clothing and they seem to be carrying something on their backs but I could not quite make out what it is from this distance. However I noticed immediately that one of them is missing. 

Suddenly, they began noticing me from a distance and waved at me? At first I was confused but what happened next made me instantly realise what that wave really meant. In an instant, an arm grab lock me by my neck and another hand covering my mouth to silence my ongoing scream. Being deaf I did not realise that there was someone right behind me. In self defence I tried to bite the palm of his hands and use my hands to free myself from this struggle. I started to notice 2 of the other guys rushing towards me. Tears are flowing from my eyes when I realised that it is over for me. Everything seemed hopeless and there seemed to be no one around to witness this. As my mind almost fading into darkness I suddenly felt the man's arms loosening. I took on this opportunity to free myself from the man's grasps. 

That's when I saw my friend Kayla fighting off the man away from me. She looked at me with her widened eyes and was trying to say something. But I instantly knew what she said. I ran away as fast as possible and for a brief moment I looked back. To my horror Kayla was trying to fight off the 3 men all by herself. From a distance I could tell that she being overpowered and is taken away. As helpless as I am I had no choice but to run away to go home and call the cops as soon as possible. 

Upon arrival at home, my parents were surprised to see me back at home. But when they saw the look at my eyes in tears my mother asked in sign language. "What happened dear?". I did not respond back in sign language, i simply panicked and told my mother in my own voice to call the cops immediately because there are 3 guys near our school who took my friend away. My mother believed me and called the cops in regards to the situation at hand. 

15 minutes later the cops had arrived to the school and one of them arrived at my home for questioning about what happened. With my mom as a sign translator to me, I explained everything to the cops about the description of the 3 men and how my friend Kayla protected me from them and was taken instead. Kayla sacrificed for me simply because I did not listen to her and that guilt alone will linger in my mind as clear as day for the rest of my life. For the first time ever, i prayed to god that the cops may be able to find the 3 men and save my friend Kayla. 

A couple days later, a news reporter said something but the headlines alone had only bring me sadness and depression when it said the following:

"Body of a Missing 17 year old Girl, found at the river of the local town" 

At this point i had though that God is not real or God had forsaken my cries but those texts alone made me cry desperately into my mother's arm. Kayla was a true friend that I will never have, a friend that i did not deserve because I had abandoned her for my own sake. My parents had always tried to reassure me that its not my fault to begin with but guilt had already torn me apart. 

Ever since that day it had traumatised me with a grain of guilt and because of it, my mental fortitude has been degrading. I had been eating less, staying up late, avoiding school and isolating myself. The guilt had only grew stronger and stronger day by day and no matter what therapists was assigned to me. It did not help at all. 

I can only think in my mind what would have happened if I did not abandon Kayla. Would she be saved and still be alive and breathing to this day? Yes... Maybe...  I don't even know anymore. It's been like this for me for the next 6 years right up unto this point of me writing this story in my mental diary. 

Please tell me... am I in the wrong for abandoning my friend Kayla?

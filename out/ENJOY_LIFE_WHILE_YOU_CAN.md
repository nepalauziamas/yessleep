Hello. I am Spirit. Some call me Ghost, which I prefer.

I am from the year 2042. We finally worked out time travel. And the afterlife.

I- I don't have much time. I need to warn you.

I'm about to die in an hour. I used a time spell to get here, but it automatically sends you back to your time. So, here we go.

&#x200B;

As I said, we worked out what's after death. And with that, we brought Their attention to us. You probably know about the "paranormal entities". Well, they walk among us now. We can see them, just as we see other humans.

But why did I need to warn you, you ask?

They are dangerous. They will kill you the first chance they get. And believe me when I say...

&#x200B;

BEVARE OF THE SHAPE-SHIFTERS.

&#x200B;

If you believe me, even if you don't, you should read my story. I'm about to tell you what led me here.

DECEMBER 30TH 2042

I was out with a friend of mine, but the time of my expected return home was nearing. The moon was rising, and so we said our good-byes, and went home. But little did we know that was the last time.

&#x200B;

I had a strange feeling in my gut, but decided to ignore it. I slowly slipped away into my thoughts.

\*Enjoy life while you can. That's what they always say.\*

I couldn't help thinking it was stupid. Life is the longest thing we experience. Why hurry with enjoying it?

&#x200B;

My gut was screaming at me as I walked into the dark alley which would lead me near my house.

\*I can enjoy life later.\* I thought. But then, I heard rustling behind me.

&#x200B;

I turned around to see a tall man. He jumped toward me and grabbed my hands. I almost screamed, but he used one of his hands to cover my mouth.

&#x200B;

\*That's my chance\* I thought.

&#x200B;

I hit him in the face and ran. But then, I realized what I've done.

&#x200B;

I screwed up.

&#x200B;

I always made sure to let Them know that I won't hurt them. But now...

&#x200B;

I looked around to see a huge bear-like creature with human parts. I tried running, but it was faster.

&#x200B;

\*Hell, I'm only 15!\*

As I came into view of my house, It got me. It picked me up and held me in front of Its face. It let our a blood-curdeling scream, saliva flying from It's huge jaws. I used a forbidden spell of time. Blue and silver flowed around me, and It let go.

&#x200B;

JULY 21ST 2022

I did it. I escaped. But only for an hour. I was in the same alley. I knew I needed to document my story. That it could save many lives. My 15-year-old brain was running at the speed of light. 

&#x200B;

\*A library! They should have computers there!\*

&#x200B;

And, as I knew from my time, there was a library not far from where I was. I reached it, and started writing this. And then, I realized something. Again.

My mother. She will be heartbroken. I took out my h- phone, you know it as a phone, and texted her. The message would automatically send itself once I returned to my time.

&#x200B;

I looked at the clock. Two minutes left.

&#x200B;

I can only guess what will happen. But whatever- here it goes. It will pick me up again, and It  will eat me.  


Do you remember my preffered name? Because that's what I'll become. I just wish I could see my mom one last time.

&#x200B;

That's it. The last two minutes have passed. My legs are dissapearing. Soon, I'll be gone for good.

&#x200B;

Too... Soon....

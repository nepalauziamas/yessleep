So for 2 years straight, students had online classes, which meant excessive screen time. Too much screen time led to the downfall of many, many students. Many of them started seeing things online which weren't meant to be seen by them, in times when they weren't meant to be seen as well.

This happened to my friend as well. 

Wendy was an amazing girl, good at studies, everyone loved her and of course, she was a great friend. Thats until covid hit.

No, she didn't get traumatized by any deaths of her close ones or something if that's what you're thinking. She got influenced, in a wrong way.

Before covid, she was never with devices. She would go out, talk to people, be jolly and happy. Then when covid hit, and everyone was practically always online, thats when she started changing.

She was online, so she had access to unlimited amount of stuff which was fairly good but also very, very dangerous for her mental health. 

She, behind her parents back had access to a lot of things which her parents didn't allow all those years, and she was starting to enjoy it. She would spend hours on end on her Laptop, which eventually became an addiction.

Her parents would ask, "Wendy, what are you doing?" And she would say, "Studying."

This went on and on for months. And her parents could clearly see she was changing. And the device was affecting her too much

Wendy's grades started going lower and lower, to the extent where her parents couldn't stand it anymore.

"That's it," her mom said after seeing her then latest report card, "Wendy, you've got textbooks to study from, throw the laptop away."

But she wouldn't listen, cause she was way to attached.

Another semester passed, and eventually she failed at a subject. So this time her parents put a camera in the house, to see whether she was on the laptop or not. Wendy feared that at least, so she stayed away from the device.

She stayed away from the device long enough, until she couldn't stand it anymore. When her parents were at work, she opened the laptop, and logged into a porn site. No surprise there.

And the camera's light flicked, and her mom's voice echoed through.

"Wendy? What are you doing on the laptop? I thought I had told you not to use it."

"Mom," she said, with a smirk. "I can do what ever I want now. You're not home anyways."

"How dare you speak to me like that?" Wendy's mom fumed, "Just wait till I reach home."

"Yeah, yeah." Wendy said, totally uninterested.

She had read this article online that no one should be able control her, not even her parents. She kinda maybe took it in the negative kinda way.

Her mom came to the door, and putting her key inside, she found that she couldn't open the door.

"Wendy?" Her mom called out, "Remove the key from the lock, LET ME IN."

"Nope," Wendy said from inside, "You can't control me now, no one can. I'm inside. So if you'd let me use the system again then I might consider letting you in. Otherwise... SUFFER OUTSIDE."

She's right her mom would suffer outside, as it was winter at the time.

"Sis," her brother said, "Let mom in! She'll cook us something."

"No," Wendy said sharply.

"Fine, then." Jake said, going towards the door, "I'll open it my self."

Just as he was going to remove the key, he felt something penetrate into his back.

Screaming out, he fell down dead, with a smirking Wendy. 

"Wendy?" Her mother called out louder this time, "What was that? Why did Jake scream like that? OPEN THE DOOR AT ONCE! DID HE GET HURT?"

"Ugh, fine woman." Wendy huffed. "But don't regret it later."

"WHAT DO YOU MEA-"

Wendy's mom was cut off by Wendy opening the door. Her mom screamed at the sight of her dead son on the floor, and then screamed again in pain when she felt something going right into her head. She slopped down dead.

And then she saw me, looking at everything that was happening through my window, with widened eyes and a fearful look.

She then, giving me a smirk, pointed at me and mouthed, "You're next."

Well, obviously I would've been on that list, cause even I used to tell her not to be on the laptop so much.

Im in trouble now.

I could hear thumping now, at my door. It was definitely her. Her thumping was so loud, my neighbor from the house next door came out to stop the commotion.

"Wendy," Julia said, looking astonished. "Why are you trying to break the door? Just wait I'm sure you're friend will be out soon."

"Stay out of this, Julia." Wendy said, now pointing the knife at her.

"Woah, woah, woah." Julia said, eyes widening more at the sight of the bloody knife. "What's with you today? And why is there blood on the knife?"

Her eyes travelled to Wendy's house, and spotted the two bodies laying ruthlessly killed on the floor.

"Is that you're mom and brother? ON THE FLOOR? DON'T TELL ME THAT YOU-"

"Arghhh, ENOUGH!"

I knew what was gonna happen, so I rushed out to try and stop her at least only to see that Wendy had already stabbed Julia hard right into her abdomen. Julia, the 3rd person I know, killed today.

This was all the effect of Wendy watching too many of those psychotic movies and people putting wrong things into her mind online.

And I knew I was next when I saw her smirking at me now.

I only had one thing to do to save myself now. RUN

So thats what I did. Even tho it was really cold outside, and I was only in my pj's, all the running was making my body pretty warm and also exhausted.

I just ran and ran, till I had thought I had lost her, which I obviously hadn't.

Seeing her come around again, I went and hid into a bush, cause there wasn't anywhere else to hide and took out my phone to dial the emergency number. I was now shivering cause of the cold and then I heard her voice calling out to me, which made me flinch and drop my phone. Which obviously had to cause a loud noise, and I heard her footsteps coming towards me now.

Picking my phone up, I started running again, and I could hear her as well, coming behind me. Man, she isn't the Wendy I know.

Ever heard this in movies and stuff, "You can run but you can't hide"?

Well here its best if I hid cause this girl can run very fast. So I went and hid again, behind a wall. It was way to dark here, so I'm pretty sure she couldn't see me.

Shivering in the cold, I held my phone to my ears after I dialed the number, and thankfully after a few rings, someone picked up.

"Hello, police here. What's your emergency?"

"H-hello?" I stammered, cause it was getting way to cold now, "Please come fast, my friend's... killing... people I know."

"Could.. you be more specific?"

"Just," I stopped, to catch my breath, "Just make it quick, its bad and I need help right now."

"Ok, we'll be there. Please state your location."

"I-i, I don't know where I am right now." I said, still shivering, both from fear and the cold. "All I know is that, she's out there somewhere looking for me." 

"Ok, please stay on the line so I can track your location. We'll be there any minute now."

"O-ok," I stammered, and sat down on the ground, rubbing myself, trying to keep myself warm.

I knew she was out there, I could hear her footsteps and calling out.

Then it all blacked out.

Today, 5 years later, is the day she did all that. Her father and Julia's family were given justice. 

That night I blacked out because of hypothermia, and woke up at the hospital. Then later found out that Wendy was taken care of, apparently her mind was very much effected in the negative way. You know, mental problems.

I don't know how she's doing right now, but hope she's gotten better.

I shouldn't have went into my dad's room that night

My dad and I are... somewhat close. Our mom comes to visit us once every year, so most of my company is my dad.


 (Extra info: ever since my mom and dad... split, whenever she visited she looked different)

That day, i was eating my favorite dish that my dad had just cooked. He put down a plate beside me but never sat down to eat. A faint moan came from his room.

He said that "he had an urgent job" and rushed to his room. I was always told to mind my own business and not go into my dads room, EVER.

But today, something kept telling me to look inside.

After i was sure my dad was asleep, i tried to open his door but of course it was locked. It had a code, instead of a key like most doors. I had seen the code years ago, but kept it in memory 

258418

I entered the code, the door opened.  My dad wasnt there. But i saw legs, and as i looked up i saw the hanging body of my mom. The rope gripping her neck tightly.

I ran and tried to pull her down, it only made it worse. I started to cry, when i realized she wasnt moving 

This was too much for me to take and i fell to the floor, while still pulling on my moms legs, i passed out.

I woke up in the same room, now feeling uncomfortable.

I almost had a heart attack when the dead body of my mother was positioned right infront of my face. I held my mom and cried, reminiscing the times we were close and happy. 

I then heard footsteps. "Its time, you get to feel the extraordinary experience that your mother felt years ago."

"What the fuck are you doing dad! Why are you acting like this?!"
 
From the afar view, i could see a shiny object in his hands,  i knew exactly what it was.

"Ive enjoyed doing research for years.  Experimenting on.. lab rats like your mom. People who deserve to die.  Your mom was advised the same as you, to NEVER enter my room! But she did, and i had to.. make sure the truth was sealed.  Whoever your mum was, isnt your mom. Shes a hired actor who looks like your mom"


"This is a joke right?"

"Since when were jokes this intense?!"

He threw the knife at me, it went flying into my head. I started getting dizzy and eventually passed out.

I woke up in the hospital and saw the docters discussing me.

I dont recall much after that, but then i was put in a mental facility, because i wouldn't stop believing my mom was dead and kept fighting the docters or hurting them badly.

I am now out of the facility, apparently my dad got arrested after that. But i still can't stop believing..that shes still alive, and hes still out there.

I'm a man in my late twenties. I was born and lived in London for the most of my life. I've moved in with my girlfriend when I was 18, she's a bit older than me but I didn't mind at the time. 

The reason I moved out of my parents house so young is because I never had a good relationship with them and wanted to move out as soon as possible. I worked as a bartender in Infernos Nightclub. It was very exhausting and that's the reason I wouldn't have enough energy to do anything throughout the day. 

That took a toll on our relationship because I couldn't spend enough time with her and it didn't help that she was working day shifts. We were starting to argue more and more, and one day, for techincal reasons the night club close early. I got home expecting her to be asleep but when I got home I noticed a car in my driveway that didn't look familiar. As I unlocked the door and made my way to the bedroom I saw my girlfriend cheating on me with another guy. 

My heart dropped to my stomach as I stood there not knowing how to feel. I shut the door and spent the night at a nearby motel. The next day I woke up and went to take my stuff with me. 

She didn't feel bad about it, she didn't say a word while I was packing my stuff. I knew I couldn't stay there for long because I would only get more depressed being alone all the time. 

So I decided to contact one of my childhood friends that moved to Birmingham. He told me i could stay with him until i got my life back on track. So I quit my job I had in London and left for Birmingham. 

I got there, unpacked and I started looking for a job nearby immediately. Even though I knew he wouldn't mind because of what I've been through these couple of days , I didn't want to be dead weight. 

So as I was scrolling trough different pages I found a forum talking about how you can find well paying jobs on Dark Web. Most of them would be illegal but I needed something to distract me so I decided to at least check out what jobs were there. 

I watched couple of tutorials, downloaded Tor and before I knew it I was in there, looking for a job. I went past the usual "Hitman, Arms Dealer, Drug Dealer" nonsense, not because it would be immoral, just because its too much exposure and too easy to get caught. 

That is until I came across one that read "Looking for a partner to help me make bodies disappear, money is good, minimal risk." Hmm I thought, itriguing. I decided to click on it to read more details and I started liking it more and more. 

Now I know that Dark Web is not the safest place to find work but I was desperate and I got denied from every application I had sent that far, I was starting to lose hope. 

There was a phone number left in the bottom of the page which I assumed was either a burner phone number or a set up by the police. 

I decided to look at it and decide when I wake up the next day. I went to sleep and when I woke up I was feeling useless, like I had been the whole time after the breakup. 

I decided to give it a try, after all even if it was a police setup they wouldn't have enough incriminating evidence to issue an arrest. So I called the number and as I expected it went straight to voice mail. 

I had lost hope again at that point. After a few hours of my silently drinking coffee and beating myself up over the breakup, my phone rang. I immediately picked up and there was a guy on the other side that introduced himself as the "Partner". 

He told me how much he was actually paying and he told me the address where to go and if I'm interested. 

"See you soon." Were his last words before he hung up. 

I decided that I would go there, I didn't have much on me worth robbing and death didn't seem like the worst option at this point in my life. So I risked it and went to the address that he provided by calling a taxi. When I got there I didn't see anything, no buildings or nothing it was a dead end in the road. 

As I was about to call again I got a call from a different number. I picked up and it was him. 

"Go into the forest on your right and follow the red handkerchiefs that are on the top of the trees." He said and hung up before I could ask any questions. I told the taxi driver he can go back and watched him leave before I continued doing anything. 

I turned to my right and looked up, there was indeed a trail of red handkerchiefs put on every 2nd or 3rd tree, leading deeper into the woods. 

I followed them and after walking for about 20 minutes I came across a clearing. There was a building in the middle of it that looked like a warehouse. 

As I approached, a man dressed casually like most people do waved me over to him. I went over to him as he put out his hand for a handshake. We shaked hands as he introduced himself. 

"As you probably already assumed, I'm the guy who posted the ad, you can call me T." He said grinning. 

"Oh hey man my name is Da..." He cut me off before I could finish. 

"Keep that to yourself, I don't use names, I'll call you D." He said as I nodded my head, feeling slightly stupid about being so willing to share my name with him. 

"Come with me, I've waited for you to come so I could show you what we would be doing." He said turning around and moving back to the warehouse. 

When he opened the door I expected the metallic smell of blood to fill my nostrils, but instead it just smelled of chemicals, really strong chemicals. 

"This is our specimen here." He said moving towards a body in a bath tub. I didn't even flinch or make a face when I saw the body, which seemed to please him. I knew what I was getting myself into and what to expect. 

He then got out a mix of chemicals that weren't labled by words, just different color bottles. He poured them in and I could see the body start decomposing slowly. 

"You can go practice on that one over there, that was my last partner, he didn't do his job right." He said as he pointed to the second bath tub in the room. 

I poured in the chemicals just like I saw him do with his "specimen". We sat there watching as the bodies decomposed until the only thing left were the bones. We then pulled the drains as the mush that was once their body went down and he started putting the bones in a barrel nearby. 

I helped him and after we were done he took the barrel outside and filled it with some sort of flammable liquid. He put the lid on and lit a matchstick as he threw it in trough the hole in the barrel. 

I thought it would explode but the liquid he put in just seemed to burn, nothing else. We waited there for couple of minutes and he extinguished the fire. The bones inside were black and he ground them up until it was just a black powder. 

We then took the barell to a nearby river and poured the powder out into it. I was impressed and for all I knew it didn't leave any traces or evidence behind, it was as if the body was never there. 

We went on like that for a week, I was suprised by how many clients there are. He would give them a location where to leave the body, then we would go pick it up, we got half the money up front and half the money after it was done. 

Honestly it wasn't hard, it took couple of hours per body to get rid of and the pay was fantastic, we were getting 10 grand per body. I was starting to feel better and better mentally, even starting to enjoy it. 

That was until we got a body of a woman and as I was putting her in the tub, getting chemicals ready like I've done so many times before, I noticed a tattoo, a tattoo that looked familiar. As I looked closer I realized it said 10.01.2012, it was my ex girlfriend's tattoo. Even though she cheated on me, I felt sick to my stomach, and I'm ashamed to admit, I did my job anyways. 

The thing that finally pushed me to the edge was one day when we got a call that there were 2 bodies to pick up, nothing unusal, we had multiple bodies dropped of plently of times. 

We went to the pick up area and I decided to look at the bodies, not sure why, maybe because my ex got killed, maybe something else. When I opened the bags I was paralyzed, I didn't know what do do or what to say. My partner apparently noticed my shock because he made his way towards me and asked what is it. 

The two people in the bags were my parents, bullet holes in their temple. I know I said I didn't have the best relationship with them but they were still my parents, I still loved them. I told my partner about it and he said it's okay if I don't want to do it, he'll take care of this order himself. 

I looked at him, rage building up inside of me. 

"You're not doing that to my fucking parents, they deserve a proper burial!" I yelled as I gritted my teeth in rage. 

"Look I'm sorry about that but I won't ruin my reputation because of your feelings." He said calmly. 

I took the next couple of days off, I need to find a way to escape, I need to find a way to get out of this mess I put myself into. 

I'd rather have my old life back, and I think I have a plan.

I don’t think anyone knows who actually painted *‘The Stars Call’.*

&#x200B;

I’ve done my research, sure. I’ve followed up every possible lead but for as much information as I’ve dug up, I haven’t found anything credible about exactly who created it.

&#x200B;

The painting sounds fairly simple and harmless on paper. It depicts a young woman standing on the edge of a cliff, looking out over a calm sea that reflects the night sky so perfectly that it looks to be made of stars. It almost seems as if she’s staring out into the void itself. 

&#x200B;

There’s something haunting about the womans face. Her features are doll-like, with large, detailed eyes, a tiny mouth and a button nose. Her expression is one that seems like a mix of contentment and melancholy. There’s a sort of troubled serenity to her and the longer you look, the more you start to wonder if she’s there to stare into the void or throw herself into it. It’s beautiful and macabre all at the same time. 

&#x200B;

There’s a name attributed to the painting, Mary Erwin. Supposedly she was a German painter from the 1850s, but I’ve found absolutely nothing on her. No other paintings, no birth records, no death records. No evidence that she ever even existed. Nothing except for ‘*The Stars Call*’ and its storied history.

&#x200B;

‘*The Stars Call*’ seems to have first appeared in an auction listing in West Berlin back in 1963. I can’t find any mention of it before that. The listing never specifies where the painting came from and my efforts to track down its origin have yielded nothing. The 1963 West Berlin Auction is as far as I can tell where the story begins.

&#x200B;

During the auction, the painting was sold to a British collector by the name of Jason Walmsley. Walmsley considered himself a patron of the arts and claimed to have been utterly smitten by the painting to the point where he insisted that he had to possess it. And so he did. According to Walmsleys eldest daughter, (a woman by the name of Clarissa) his purchase of the painting seemed to bring about a drastic change in his personality. 

&#x200B;

Walmsley had apparently always been an eccentric but up until then, he had also been notably extroverted. However after purchasing the painting, he spent more time at home up in his study. Clarissa mentioned that sometimes when she went in to visit him, he’d just be standing in front of the painting and staring into the stars. He’d lose himself there, barely responding when spoken to and if pulled from his daze would often lash out angrily. 

&#x200B;

When he wasn’t staring at the painting he was researching it. Trying to figure out who had made it or where he could find more of their work. It became an obsession of his, eclipsing everything else in his life in just a matter of months.

&#x200B;

Clarissa unfortunately didn’t have any of her fathers old notes and she wasn’t able to offer any insight into what, if anything he’d discovered. From what the explained to me though, I can’t imagine he found much. Walmsley had apparently been shown a couple of other paintings that were claimed to have been done by the same artist, but he’d dismissed them as frauds. He never seemed to have found any other genuine pieces from the same artist. According to him, they never did the eyes quite right. That was the giveaway.

&#x200B;

In August of 1965, Walmsley left his home to go for a walk one evening and never returned. He was found the next day washed up on the shore of a nearby river and is believed to have thrown himself in. 

&#x200B;

Following the suicide of Jason Walmsley, his widow was all too happy to get rid of the painting that had become his final obsession. According to Clarissa, her mother had sold it to one of Walmsley’s friends, a man named Keith Wendt.

&#x200B;

Apparently, Wendt had become fascinated with the painting while it had been in Walmsleys possession and had tried to assist him in locating its origin. After he’d died, he had offered to purchase it and Walmsley’s widow had happily obliged him. Clarissa also believed that he had taken her fathers notes on the subject as well, with the goal of concluding his research. 

&#x200B;

Wendt was thankfully very meticulous in his note keeping habits and some of his research has survived him. I’ve gotten my hands on some of it and it has greatly helped me in my own research into this subject. 

&#x200B;

Wendt had gone back to the auction house looking for anyone who might be able to offer information as to where ‘*The Stars Call*’ had originated from. He’d even offered a $10,000 reward for anyone willing to come forward with reliable information and after a few frauds, did eventually pay the money to someone who claimed to have known Mary Erwin. However his personal notes later express some doubt on to whether or not the information he received was genuine, as while the lead seemed promising at the time, it very quickly went cold.

&#x200B;

In 1968, Wendt traveled to Altaussee, Austria to meet with a man who claimed to be familiar with the painting. He was gone for approximately one week, although what he discovered or who he met remain unknown to all save for Wendt himself, who never shared or seemed to have written down any of what he learned. Upon returning to England from Austria, Wendt went back to his home and quietly set it ablaze. 

&#x200B;

An analysis of the fire suggests that he started it inside his study, where ‘*The Stars Call*’ hung. His charred and blackened body was found in his armchair, facing the painting. No doubt he had been staring at it as he burned, and hoping that it was burning too… And yet the painting didn’t burn.

&#x200B;

In fact, it was the only thing recovered from Wendt’s home after his suicide. 

&#x200B;

I have poured over Wendts journals and only found precious few things worth sharing here. His final entries, written before his trip to Austria detail some analysis he had done on the painting itself. Wendt had concluded that the paint used had been unique in its composition but was unsure where it could have come from, however, noted that the artist had likely created the mixture themselves. He had voiced an intention to look into the source of the paint in the future, but it seems unlikely he ever had the chance to do so. 

&#x200B;

My own investigation into the matter only determined that the paint was made of some sort of crushed plant matter and contained a trace amount of human blood in it. I was unable to determine just where it all might have come from. It was little more than another dead end. His final entry is the most enigmatic of all and also his shortest. It was written the day before he returned home from Austria and took his own life. It simply reads.

&#x200B;

 *‘They are within my grasp. I will pursue. Do not follow me.’*

&#x200B;

After Wendt's death, ownership of the painting passed to his wife. 

&#x200B;

Sarah Wendt however displayed no interest in keeping it though and eventually passed it along to her elder sister, a woman by the name of Michelle Corbin. According to her son, Michelle had no interest in the painting and disliked it, but was also unwilling to either sell it or give it away. She had moved it up to their attic where it remained for the next several years.

&#x200B;

During that time, both Michelle and her husband had no notable change in their behavior. Her husband did at one point begin looking into sleep therapy but that may easily be unrelated. The couples lack of interest in the painting and lack of shift in their personality thus made it especially jarring when both of them curiously committed suicide on the same day.

&#x200B;

In July of 1976, Michelle Corbin was found dead at the foot of a cliff several miles from her home. A couple walking along the beach one morning had discovered her body and called for an ambulance. Michelle was declared dead at the scene. It’s believed that she flung herself off the cliff just a couple of hours prior while it was still dark. 

&#x200B;

I’ve spoken to the paramedic who examined her body and what they seem to remember most about the scene was the unusual look on her face.

&#x200B;

They described Michelle as wearing a wide, twisted rictus grin of pure and utter glee as she lay dead in the sand. It’s not an expression they’ve seen on any body since… 

&#x200B;

Her husband was subsequently found hanging in their bedroom that day. His death was also attributed to a suicide. Like his wife, he too was noted to be wearing a look of manic joy as he hung naked above the foot of their bed.

&#x200B;

The Corbins' deaths received little investigation, although no suicide notes were recovered nor did anyone in their personal lives observe any signs they had been looking to take their own lives in the weeks leading up to their deaths. The last time anyone had seen them alive the night before, they had described the couple as being in their usual good spirits, having just purchased a new home to retire in. The only thing of note they’d discussed was selling some of the ‘junk’ up in their attic.

&#x200B;

With the death of her sister and brother in law, the painting was ultimately returned to Sarah Wendt. She had responded to this by listing the painting for auction at a low price. It was sold to an American couple by the name of Judy and Christopher Stanley, who brought it back to their home in New Hampshire. 

&#x200B;

Six months after the auction, Sarah Wendt was found dead in her apartment in Bristol. A neighbor heard a gunshot and had come in to investigate. They found her lying on her bed with a pistol in her hand, having just taken her own life.

&#x200B;

I’ve spoken with a colleague of Christopher Stanley about ‘*The Stars Call’*. He remembers seeing the painting in their home starting from the fall of 1976. 

&#x200B;

Mrs. Stanley was reportedly a woman who was very particular about her living space and painstakingly curated her home like a museum, decorating it with bits of art and history that she found pleasing. Her husband never saw the appeal of it all, being more of a man of numbers. He worked as an accountant and mostly left his wife to her own affairs. My understanding is that their marriage was not a particularly loving one and after fifteen years, they had no children, but I digress. 

&#x200B;

Mrs. Stanley was apparently in love with the painting she’d brought back from England and had hung it in her foyer by the staircase where it could be easily seen by anyone entering or leaving the house. According to Mr. Stanleys colleague, she seemed to delight in talking about it to guests during the various get togethers she hosted. His opinion was that she only really liked it because she thought it made her seem more cultured. Although given what I know about the history of the painting, I have my doubts that he’s correct. 

&#x200B;

Mrs. Stanley apparently had inquired with both the auction house, and some of her high society friends about other paintings by the same artist. One woman I spoke to, who had been friends with Judy Stanley stated that she’d been dead set on owning that artist's entire catalog. However, her efforts turned up nothing.

&#x200B;

In May of 1979, Mrs. Stanley even traveled back to England looking for answers where she tried to trace the history of the painting much like I have. She even gathered some of the research I’ve used here and near the end of her trip, took a flight out to Altaussee, Austria just like Keith Wendt had several years prior. She returned to New Hampshire empty handed a few weeks later, although this did not seem to slow down her pursuit. 

&#x200B;

By 1981, Christopher Stanley apparently became distant from his wife. He had started an affair with another woman (not unusual for either of them) and this time had taken to discussing the possibility of leaving her and in March of 1982, Mr. Stanley had finalized his decision and filed for divorce.

&#x200B;

He had told his mistress that he would be giving the papers to Mrs. Stanley on the night of March 14th, and was last seen by his mistress after dinner, on his way home.

&#x200B;

He was not seen again for 4 days after that.

&#x200B;

A colleague later stopped by Mr. Stanleys house at the request of his mistress to check in on him. When he knocked on the door, he found it locked but looking through the window he saw Judy Stanley naked and covered in blood, sitting on the floor and staring up at the picture. 

&#x200B;

Nearby, he saw the corpse of Christopher Stanley, lying in a pool of his own blood. He looked as if he’d been attacked suddenly. His briefcase was on the floor and had come open, spilling documents everywhere. Most of them had been soaked in his blood.

&#x200B;

Naturally, the police were called and forced their entry into the Stanley house. 

&#x200B;

According to the officers on the scene, Judy Stanley only reacted when the door was forced open, during which she leapt to her feet and started raving at the police. According to the police report, Mrs. Stanley had lunged for them, screaming and they had opened fire in self defense. Despite taking several bullets, she had managed to tackle one of the officers and had successfully broken his neck before finally succumbing to her wounds. 

&#x200B;

The report describes Mrs. Stanley writhing violently on the ground, smearing blood all over the floor and laughing breathlessly as the blood gushed from the bullet holes in her chest and neck. She uttered one final word before going still.

&#x200B;

  *“Beautiful.”*

&#x200B;

The subsequent police investigation determined that Christopher Stanley had been bludgeoned to death by a sculpture in the foyer. It was believed that his wife had hit him from behind. He had died almost instantly.

&#x200B;

As for Judy Stanley, I’ve read the coroners report and they did not appear to have found anything unnatural about her body. There was no explanation on how a middle aged woman had managed to survive several gunshot wounds, before snapping a mans neck like a twig. By all rights, she should have been killed by the first shot, which was alleged to have gone through her head.

&#x200B;

Ultimately, it was determined that Judy Stanley had been compelled to murder her husband out of grief when she learned about the divorce. She was believed to have subsequently suffered some sort of psychotic episode. No mention of the painting was made in the police report, although it was seized in evidence by the local police and remained in lockup by them for the next several years.

&#x200B;

As far as I can tell, the painting was not touched while held as evidence and this period of time thankfully seems to be the most unremarkable in the painting's storied history.

&#x200B;

However while looking through the records, I couldn’t help but notice that during the decades where the painting was in evidence, there were at least four unusual suicides among the local police.

&#x200B;

One Detective who had worked on the case drove his car off the road and into a lake in 1985. 

&#x200B;

An officer seemingly unrelated to the case jumped off a bridge in 1992.

&#x200B;

Another officers body was recovered from a river in 1996 after she had weighed herself down with stones before jumping in.

&#x200B;

Lastly, an administrator at the department had walked into traffic one night in 2001. 

&#x200B;

These deaths seemed unrelated to the painting, but I find it noteworthy that they were all suicides and most of them were drownings. It’s possible that all 4 had come into contact with the painting at some point but I was not able to confirm this.

&#x200B;

In 2004, ‘*The Stars Call*’ was sold in auction after spending over two decades hidden from the world. It was purchased by a man named Jim Stringer, my father. 

&#x200B;

I remember seeing that painting hanging in his office. Dad was never really an art guy, but he liked that painting. I remember the way that he’d sometimes stare at it while sitting at his desk. He used to say:

  *“If you look hard enough, you almost feel like you’re right beside her.”*

&#x200B;

I never really knew what he meant by that. Not really.

&#x200B;

My Dad’s first suicide attempt was in 2007. He took his car out to a back road and drove it off a bridge, into the river. He only survived because someone pulled him out. He spent the next few years in therapy and even spent some time in a mental hospital. By 2010, he was back home and we thought he was getting better.

&#x200B;

Then in 2014… He tried again and this time, he succeeded.

&#x200B;

He’d waited until my Mom was gone, ran himself a bath and pulled a plastic bag over his head. I don’t think I can put into words the amount of pain that caused her…

&#x200B;

She kept the painting, obviously. I don’t think she understood the correlation between it and my fathers death. She just knew that he’d liked it, and that he’d liked staring at it. I don’t suppose I need to tell you how this ends, does it?

&#x200B;

No… But I might as well, right?

&#x200B;

Six months ago she ran a bath and pulled a plastic bag over her head. Just like my father had.

&#x200B;

Six months ago I became an orphan… And the painting was passed on to me.

&#x200B;

I’ve been staring at it ever since, transfixed by its beauty. Like so many others before me, I wanted to know more. So I dug… I dug through every life ruined by this fucking painting and I can see the pattern clear as day.

&#x200B;

Honestly… I figured that that Keith Wendt had the right idea. Burn it. 

&#x200B;

Well I tried.

&#x200B;

It doesn’t burn. 

The stars just shine all the brighter when you try. 

&#x200B;

There’s a funny thing about curses. Whenever you hear about one, there’s always a little thought in the back of your mind saying: *‘That’s bullshit. It wouldn’t affect me.’* For a while, I wondered if knowing about whatever curse this thing seems to carry might protect me from it. It’s easy to not commit suicide, right? Just don’t do it.

&#x200B;

But I’ve been living with this thing for only a little while now and I can feel it calling to me. The stars call to me… They beckon me into their embrace. They demand to be admired and when I look… When I look I can hear the waves. I can feel the presence of the girl beside me and I feel her hand in mine, inviting me to jump with her. And *I want to*.

&#x200B;

I crave the sensation of water filling my lungs and smothering the life from me. I want the gentle caress of the waves on my body as I slip into the cold depths below, my consciousness fading into a blissful nothing until I am lost among the stars…

&#x200B;

*I want it.*

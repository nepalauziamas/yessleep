When I was nine years old, I was assigned a project in school. The teacher called it “the swapping game” and you may have heard of it. We were all given a dollar to spend on anything we wanted. The idea was that we would take the item that we bought and swap it for something else. We would then take that item and swap it again and so on. The project lasted for a month, and at the end of the month, whoever had the item that the teacher deemed the most unique and valuable would win a prize. 

There was an option for parents to opt-out, and those children would do a different (in my opinion, more boring) project. I BEGGED my parents to let me take part. They were reluctant. The idea of having to (in their words) “hassle” people for stuff wasn’t something that appealed to them, but they eventually relented.

The first thing I bought with my dollar was a big candy bar from the store. It was one of those kinds of candy bars that you were supposed to share but really presented itself as a challenge to children to eat in all one sitting. It was filled was popping candy which was my absolute favorite. It took every ounce of my willpower not to eat it right then and there. 

When I got home, my older brother’s eyes widened at the candy bar, and he eventually convinced me to swap the candy bar for a shiny gold button that he insisted was made from solid gold and was worth hundreds of dollars. When my parents learned what had happened, they demanded he swapped back. It was too late. He had already eaten the chocolate and the button he had given me was some cheap, plastic trash. My parents offered to give me another dollar so I could start again, but I refused. That would have been cheating. I was a competitive child but I wanted to win fair and square. It made me more determined than ever. 

I brought the button to my friend the next day, who had not been allowed to participate in the project. He swapped it for the coolest pencil in his pencil case, capped with a ninja turtle pencil topper. I don’t think he was particularly impressed with the button, but he was annoyed his parents wouldn’t let him participate, and he wanted to join in with the fun somehow. 

Every evening, I harassed my parents relentlessly to take me to visit my grandparents, aunts. uncles, and knock on neighbors’ doors. They would grumble about having to take me, but I was obsessed. Some of the neighbors were intrigued and found the whole thing simply wonderful. They cooperated and helped me out, swapping things with me that were clearly a better deal for me than for them. however, it soon got to the point where I had run out of people to trade with. I wasn’t allowed to knock on people’s doors without my parents accompanying me, and they downright refused to knock on the doors of people who lived further down the street, as they didn’t know those people. 

I persisted though and I got creative. I approached the janitor at school and even some of the other teachers. One of them laughed and commented that I was the only one who had thought to ask the teachers. She said I was quite the entrepreneur but I didn’t really know what she meant.

Of course, at first, people were just humoring me, but after a while, I started getting some pretty cool items to swap, like a shiny-new frying pan which I swapped for a hairdryer, which I swapped for a beautiful, delicate necklace. It probably wasn’t a particularly expensive necklace, but it was pretty all the same.  By this time, my parents were tired of it and refused to accompany me anywhere else. The necklace was to be my final item. However, there was still a week left of the project, and even though most of the other students had lost interest, I was determined not to be beaten.

It was then that I made the most stupid decision I had ever made. I was playing outside on the street (I was only allowed to go as far as the nearest streetlight) and when I knew my Mom was busy cooking dinner, I RAN down the street. I still vividly remember the first step I took past the streetlight boundary, and how exhilarating it felt. I ran down the street, no idea where I was actually planning to go, turning randomly, left, right, left. I honestly think I forgot about the fact I was seeking out a neighbor to swap with, and just ran for the thrill of it. I ran until I needed to catch my breath and I stopped.

“Are you lost?” came a voice. It was a lady in her fifties or sixties, who was stood in her garden, watching me run through the street. She looked like she might like a necklace. This was my chance. 

“No,” I replied. “. I have this beautiful necklace. I want to swap this necklace with something you own. Do you have something to swap with me? I’m playing the swapping game you see. It’s for school. So can I have something of yours?”

I’d messed the speech up. My dad usually did the introductions. It didn’t matter though.  She was smiling.

“How old are you, sweetie?”

“Nine but I’ll be ten in June,” I said proudly. 

“Well… it’s a really beautiful necklace. I’m not sure if I have anything that is as good as that. I’ll tell you what, you come inside and I’ll let you have a look around and you tell me what you’d like, alright? You can have anything you want.”

It didn’t even occur to me that I shouldn’t. My eyes were on the prize. “You want a drink while you look?” she said as we walked in. I shook my head. She brought one anyway. It was cold orange juice and I couldn’t resist slurping it all up in one big gulp. 

As I walked further into her house, I saw that there was a room, decorated in bright pink that was clearly a child’s room. It was messy with toys strewn all over the place.

“You have a kid?” I said, excitedly. “Does she go to Park View Elementary? Do I know her?”

Although I hadn’t even heard him join us, what I assumed must have been her husband, was now stood next to her. 

“We did have a daughter,” he said. “But she died, ten years ago.”

I remember, even then, thinking it was weird that if she died ten years ago, the bedroom looked as if a kid still lived there. I thought to myself that these adults were really messy and they should probably clean the room up. 

“Why don’t you have a look around there?” said the woman. “You might find something you want. You can even keep the necklace if you want.”

“No, it has to be a swap. That’s the rules. I-“ but suddenly I was feeling extremely tired. It wasn’t really late but my arms and legs were heavy and I couldn’t keep my eyes open.”

“It’s okay,” said the woman, but her voice sounded like it was underwater. “Have a lie down if you need to.” 

When I woke up, I was laying in a bed and my clothes had been changed. I looked down and realized that I was now wearing a frilly dress. I wanted to be horrified, as I had always been a tomboy, but my head was pounding and I was too confused.  

The man and woman were standing in the doorway of the room I’d woken up in. Unlike the pink bedroom I’d seen last night, this was plain, with white walls and a single bed. Although I didn’t really understand what was going on, my brain screamed ‘danger’ and I attempted to run past them, but they grabbed me.

“Darling, it’s OK. We aren’t going to hurt you. Doesn’t she look just like Jacqueline?” the woman said to her husband, and he nodded, tears in his eyes.

“We’re going to take really good care of you, Jacqueline, and we won’t let anything happen to you.”

“My name’s not Jacqueline,” I mumbled. And then I screamed as loud as I could. Their calm faces switched to anger, and like a well-oiled machine, the man held his hand over my mouth while the woman pinned me back down to the bed.

“Now, now,” the man said. “No screaming. That’s one of the rules.”

“My mom and dad don’t know where I am,” I sobbed.

“That’s right, honey,” the woman said. “Your mommy and daddy should have been watching you. Parents who don’t keep an eye on their kids aren’t good parents. If your parents were good parents, they wouldn’t have let you run off on your own. Imagine what could have happened to you! Do you know there are bad people around? Bad people who want to hurt you. We won’t let anyone hurt you, sweetie. We are going to look after you now.”

I continued sobbing and a hand struck me across the face.

“No more crying,” said the man. “That’s one of the rules too. You need to learn the rules,” and then he stopped and added, “I’m punishing you because I love you.” I bit down on my lip hard to stop myself from crying.

“Jacqueline,” said the woman. “When Daddy says I love you, you need to say it back.” 

I opened my mouth to argue, and then, being scared of another smack, said, “I love you.” They smiled. They finally left me in the room while they cooked breakfast for us all. As soon as they left the room, I scrambled to the window to try and figure out where I was. This was not the house that I had entered last night. In fact, we were now in a cabin and we were in the middle of nowhere. 

“No windows! No windows!” came the man’s voice from behind me, and I ducked as he hurled himself towards me and yanked the curtains. I flinched, but no pain came this time.

“It’s OK,” he said. “You’ll learn the rules, soon.”

Over the next few weeks, I learned the rules.

\- No standing near windows.

\- No crying.

\- Always wear nice dresses. 

\- No shouting or screaming

\- Stay in my room unless I’m told to come out. 

I was left alone for long periods of time. When they were gone, the windows and doors to my room were locked, so if I needed to go to the bathroom, I would either have to wait until they came back or have an accident. I was always punished for my accidents, but I made sure not to be punished for anything else. 

At first, I cooperated because I feared being physically punished, but after a while, I cooperated for a different reason. I’d never been a particularly smart kid, but something clicked inside me, and I knew that if I ever wanted to escape, I needed them to think I was happy there with them. 

So I followed their rules and over time, they softened. I was eventually allowed free roam of the house whenever they were present, as long as I stayed away from windows, and, most importantly, whenever anybody knocked on the door, I had to run to my room and stay there until told to come out. 

One day, I was sat in the living room, drawing. The man and woman, who I was forced to call Mom and Dad out loud, were out back, gardening. That day, something happened that had never happened before. As the man had come inside with the shopping, I noticed he forgot to lock the front door behind him, and, after I’d given him my fakest, sickly-sweet, “Hi Daddy,” he had gone straight through the house, out the back, to help his wife with the gardening. 

I took my chance. I didn’t have shoes as I wasn’t allowed to wear them in the house and I was obviously not allowed to leave the house, but I decided it didn’t matter. Time was of the essence here and so by the time the idea had formed in my head, I decided to do it right then and there. 

I bolted to the front door, hoping and praying that I was right about it being unlocked. I was. I flung open the handle, and ran out of the house, running as fast as my skinny legs could carry me. 

I ran off into the woods nearby. It seemed like my safest option. With the headstart I would have on them, I might be able to get away and at least they wouldn’t be able to follow me by car into the woods. I wished I had some shoes, because my feet cried out in pain, as I stood on thorns and brambles.

I tried to go as straight as possible, as I had no idea where I was going, and I was concerned that if I made any turns, I could end up going around in a circle and stumbling right back into them.

At one point, I thought I heard voices, and I stopped dead. My heart was pounding so loudly that I was positive it could be heard, but the voices went away and I convinced myself it was the wind. After an hour or so of stopping and starting, the woods started to thin out and I saw I had come across a farm.

Without warning, a large furry figure ran towards me and lunged at me. I froze in place, my hands lifted up to my face. My fingers felt wet and warm. It was a dog and it was licking me. It started barking excitedly.

“Who’s there?” came a voice, and a man walked over to me. He looked baffled. I must have been quite a sight. A child in a slightly-too-small frilly dress with no shoes on, running out of the woods, covered in cuts from being scraped and whipped from thorns and branches.

“What are-?” and when he saw my face, his eyes widened. Then he said my full name out loud. It was a question.  

“How do you know my name?” I asked. 

“You’re safe now,” was his reply. 

He brought me inside and tried to comfort me as we waited for the police to arrive. He was a farmer named Frank and his dog’s name was Roy. Roy was supposed to be a guard dog but he was apparently completely useless at it so instead, he was just a normal dog. Frank let me pet Roy and I grabbed hold of him so tightly, shoving my face into his fur for comfort. Frank had recognized me from the missing child coverage he had seen on TV and told me my parents had been very worried about me and had been looking for me ever since I disappeared. He didn’t ask me what had happened to me and I didn’t tell him. He just kept telling me I was safe. I didn’t completely believe him until the police arrived.  

It turned out the two people who had taken me had been responsible for the abduction and later murder of four little girls over the past ten years. Their own child, Jacqueline, died at nine years old, as she ran into a busy street, getting knocked over by a car. The girls they abducted were aged between seven and nine. They were taken from crowded places, such as shopping malls, carnivals, and parks, after being briefly separated from their parents. Each of the girls was murdered when they hit ten years old. The cabin I was kept in was only twenty miles away from my home. 

Since I missed so much school during that time, I never did win the prize for the best-swapped item, but I have kept that necklace with me to this day. Every time I look at it, I remember how lucky I was, because on the day I escaped, I was three days away from turning ten years [old.](https://www.reddit.com/r/viciousmock/comments/i5robb/list_of_stories/)

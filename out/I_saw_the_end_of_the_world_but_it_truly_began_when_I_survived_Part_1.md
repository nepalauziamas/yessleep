Were these demons or were they angels? Or were they something else entirely and to this day, I still ask myself, if I will see them again, and if I will ever find the answer.

You ever have those dreams where you try to fly, but whenever you try to prove it to someone, you can't even get off the ground? You have those dreams, that as soon as you enter the dream world, you don't know exactly where you are or how it began. You're just there. Sometimes its plot after plot, no true connection to one another, no true rhyme or reason. And when you wake up, details begin to fade, and it slowly becomes an ebbing memory? That's how I used to dream. 

But this one shook the very foundations of what I thought to be my normal. This was years ago, and I still remember every detail as vivid as it was the first night I saw it. And I had no idea it would continue....

 

My name is Dante. And maybe this was my own journey through Hell. 

My ex girlfriend, Laura, and her current girlfriend, Amber, were friends with me at this time. I was still close to Laura and supportive of her hobbies, safe to say. One of them being, Laura and Amber were witches. Not the kind to brew potions in cauldrons and dance in the woods in the pale moonlight in only their birthday suits, but they had a coven, and I had a dream....  and it's stuck with me ever since. 

We had taken a trip up the east coast for this event. As far as I knew, it was essentially Woodstock for wiccans. On the outskirts was a small town, the '*bathtub*', as one could call it. The town was on the edge of a small mountain range, situated within a valley by the sea. The town was full of Venetian buildings surrounding a square, gift shops, tiki huts, and about a dozen places families could stock up on emergency sunscreen rations and fresh oysters. It was colorful and almost too touristy for my tastes, however, the one place that stuck out like a sore thumb was the abandoned pub in the far back. 

It had seen better days. It's dark, rotting wood contrasting the whites and pastels painting the small town. People often called the pub, "*the portal"*. The "*portal*" earning it's name, because it operated as a '*door*' to a secret path leading up to the cliffside. Few and in between knew about it, and when we had arrived at the '*bathtub*', it was evening. 

Laura and Amber adorned black robes, and I couldn't help but hide a subtle giggle. They were really serious about this wiccan thing. See, I had collected crystals and stones on occasion, looked into self help books for spirituality, laid back, watched the stars, looked for UFOs, and occasionally would talk to nature just on my own time. I wasn't huge into the wiccan lifestyle, nor would I even consider myself one. I thought for a moment, maybe they did take this thing too seriously. Black robes? What next, wands? I was about to crack a joke when I saw more people in black robes appear, and they were all walking towards the pub. It was then that I began to feel a little unnerved. 

Was this a cult? Was I a human sacrifice? Why the living hell was a squib like me invited? 

I paused to regain some illusion of common sense when something started scratching at the back of my mind. Itching and crawling. Like something was watching me. 

I brushed it off and rejoined Laura and Amber. 

We crossed the small town and upon arriving at the '*door*', there were three figures donned in the black robes, posing as gate keepers. I started searching in my satchel for a few bucks - of course there was a cover pay for this kind of event- wasn't there? 

I heard a chuckle and glanced up. There was one who was lanky and thin, his skin mottled and grey, his eyes sunken into his skeletal appearance. Another looked near identical, his eyes empty and void of emotion and life. The third, was tall and broad, and heavy set. He was bald, and his face was painted like a harlequin. He had red lips, stretched into a grin, blue eyeshadow reaching up to his brows. What bothered me about them wasn't their appearance. I had seen plenty of people of the sort after having spent the better half of a decade volunteering at the Rocky Horror Picture Show. But what sent chills down my spine, were there eyes, locked on me at all times. If I didn't know any better, I would have said they were '*Harpies*'. 

They didn't speak. They allowed me to enter and follow Laura and Amber into the '*portal*.' 

We arrived on the other side  - rather, through a door in the back of the pub, leading off onto the beaten path towards the cliffside. It was when I was taking in the view, that I finally had started to feel the tension in my shoulders ease and the gnawing sensation at the back of my brain begin to fade. 

As I glanced around the premises, I holstered a chuckle. I was right about the Woodstock for Wiccans thing. Several hundred people in identical robes gathered on the cliffside, the '*portal*' having led us to a stunning overlook of the Atlantic and far away islands. Despite being so close to the small tourist town, the sky was blanketed in stars, the thick foliage filtering any light pollution that was heinous enough to try and obstruct the view. 

Entranced in the stars, I sat down on a patch of grass as Laura and Amber rushed off to mingle with the others and I lit a cigarette. I would let them do what they needed to, soak up a few moon rays and enjoy the view. I had no idea I had front row seats to the end of everything as I had known. 

Minutes turned into an hour, and I continued to watch the stars, smoking cigarettes, locked in my own mind and sense of peace. 

As I was becoming lost in the constellation of Orion, I started to see something... off, appear in the sky. 

Like someone had stuck a pin in the blanket of night, a new star had appeared. 

Right as I was about to grab my phone and google as to which star it was, or possible planet, I noticed it getting brighter. 

And *larger*. 

I stood. 

I was certain I had seen UFOs in the past, but this was different. This was like any other old dream I had had before, watching the night sky turn into a rain of fire as the universe came crumbling down. I waited for the earth to tremble and the first of many meteors to strike. But they didn't come. And it was quiet. Far too quiet. 

As I became transfixed on this growing star, I saw many others appear behind it, dozens, hundreds, then thousands. 

I fought to find my voice, "H-Hey! Look!" 

I don't know who I was talking to, but I pointed and yelled again, "Hey! Everyone, look!" 

And everyone did. 

And there we stood, hundreds of people in silly black robes, and one singular man in ratty jeans and a tee shirt, staring at the sky, transfixed on the stars that had turned into a figure. 

I don't know where Laura or Amber had gone. I no longer cared. 

The figure was monstrous and beautiful. A crown of stars adorned a massive head, a winged creature perched on the figure's shoulder. For the life of me, I cannot remember a face. Nor the words the figure in the stars had spoken as they tremble upon us like thunder and lightning. 

The ones in black had all knelt, praying, becoming a chorus of praise for this figure. 

*Was this why we had come?* 

*Or was this... something else?* 

As the figure continued, and the witches prayed, I saw the something else. It was red. Glowing hot and bright, appearing over the left side of the crown of stars. And I suddenly had the instinct to run. 

But I couldn't move. All I could do was watch as the red star was consumed into shadow. Hundreds of shadows that were moving, flapping, and swarming our way. 

The figure screamed, and one word did register. 

"Judgment." 

The first of the black winged creatures tore into the first robed person it could get its claws into. Tearing its inky teeth into their throat, consuming them and their soul in one crushing bite. 

The crowd erupted into chaos. Hundreds of winged humanoid creatures descended upon the cliffside, tearing black from black, turning the dark into a flood of red. 

I tried to find Amber and Laura. 

The stars had disappeared. The figure had gone. All that was left was bloodshed. 

Black figures, left and right. Some human, some not. But through the chaos, I saw them again. The three. 

The one with red lips, smiling. All three, taking a stroll through the end of the world. Towards *me*. 

I dashed away. I had to find Laura and Amber. I had to get them - or at least, Laura, to safety. I rushed past bodies and figures, and demonic faces with no eyes, only inky black teeth. 

I finally found them, rushing back down the hill towards the portal. Laura was quicker. She had almost made it back to the pub, but I caught sight of Amber lagging behind, struggling to keep up. And that was when a creature, claws poised, ready to tear into her flesh, leapt upon her back. 

I froze. 

I was never proud of this thought. It was a fraction of a second, and locked in the moment, I realized it was what I had always wished. Any way to get Amber out of the picture, to regain the life I once had with Laura. Without Amber, I wouldn't have spent so many nights questioning my own self worth. Without Amber, I would still be happy. Without Amber, I would have still been Laura's number one. I could easily watch and let the creature devour her. Later, comfort Laura in her loss, and become hers once more. 

But as my legs propelled me instinctively down the hill, I had suddenly come to the realization that Amber's life was worth more than mine. 

I sprang onto the back of the creature, fighting against its flapping, skeletal wings.  Driven by absolute primal instinct, I tore the demon away from Amber. It screamed. It's hideous maw was inches from my face, and eyeless, black head staring into me and into my soul. For a brief moment, man and demon remained interlocked. 

And then, like some ungodly force had pushed me, I sank my teeth into its throat. It writhed, it's bat like wings slapping me, until the weight of the creature had becoming void. I fell away, and watched it dissolve before my very eyes, into dust. 

Amber was long gone, as was Laura. Both had safely reached the portal. I breathed a sigh of relief, reaching up to wipe the sweat from my brow and the black ooze from my mouth. 

My skin was stained with the blood of the creature. My fingers black as if I had dipped them in ink. And the ink was *growing*. Spreading. Spider webbing up my arms to my shoulders. 

And I buckled to the ground as giant blades stabbed through my back, forcing their way out of me. Like something wished to be birthed- 

I felt no pain. 

Only fear. 

And I reached back to find what had emerged. 

I felt blood. And scale. 

Too consumed with fear as to what I was becoming, I turned away from the direction of the portal - my newly found wings flapped, propelling me off the ground- and I flew, desperate to find shelter within the trees. 

Or was this something worse? A vision? 

I don't know how I fell asleep or when, or if I ever dreamed. *Was this a dream?* 

I woke up at dawn under a fallen oak tree. I stared upon my black flesh, overcome with a shudder. *Guess not.* 

 I gathered myself and decided to make my way to the portal again.

The cliffside was empty. The sky was blue, the grass was... red. 

The blood and the black being vast and vivid reminders of the previous night. 

I was alone. 

I returned to the portal, and coming out the other side of the dilapidated pub, I found that it was abandoned. Masked in grey and red. What was once lively and colorful had been stripped of life. I knew calling for my folks would be moot. Part of me had known since it had began, that this was it. The end of all things. 

But I wasn't sad. I couldn't tell you why. 

I hardly felt anything. 

With no direction, no clue as to where I could go, I returned to the pub, hoping that perhaps, it would have answers. 

Spoiled beer and broken beams were not the answers I was looking for. I read the graffiti in the bathroom, searching for the smallest clues. And then, I saw a mirror. And saw myself. 

 My natural black hair was white. My eyes, void and black, my skin, as dark as the night. I no longer recognized myself. But what disturbed me, wasn't my appearance. Instead, it was how... happy I was. How entranced I was in my own reflection. 

And then it moved. My reflection smiled back. Tears leaked from his eyes. His lips parted. 

He wanted to speak. 

And then light cut through the darkness of the pub. 

There, in the threshold of the light, were the Harpies. 

"Who are you?" I had asked. "What's happening here?"

The one with the red smile offered a hand, "Come with us." 

And I went.

Tw- Possible derealization, hallucinations, and paranoia.


Listen, I know it sounds crazy but no one believes me and I feel like I am going crazy. So please just hear me out, I really need some advice.

Okay, so, my shadow has talked to me since a very young age, my parents always wrote it off as an imaginary friend, and for a long time so did I. I mean, I'm only 15, so it isn’t too weird to have an imaginary friend. Right? I mean, it isn’t unheard of so like, not that weird I would think.

Yet these last few months I haven't been too sure that he, yes he, is just an ‘imaginary friend.’ I have proof even! Yet no one believes me, my mom won’t even look at me anymore, saying she won’t talk to me until I stop telling such horrible lies and my dad is… well he’s not there much, and when he is he isn’t very pleasant. My friends just laugh it off as if I am joking but he is getting creepy, which isn’t unusual but this is different! He is saying things that are… concerning.


Like 5 weeks ago for example, god I remember it so vividly it is… I don’t know. Basically what happened was this…

I do after-school drama club, and my mom couldn’t pick me up last Thursday from rehearsal, so I had to walk home. I COULD have road home with a friend but like- I like walking, not to mention my house is barely a mile from the building so why not? It’s a safe town.

So, I did what I normally do, I am walking down the street with one earphone in since I normally talk to him well alone, but I was in public and didn’t need people thinking I was crazy, because of, “something that isn’t real.” Or whatever.

He had been quiet almost all day which was weird, I grew used to hearing him constantly, but it was whatever, he was chatty now so it was fine.

Or it was until he suddenly went quiet.

“What’s wrong, your being quite De.” I had asked, De is what I call him, he likes the nickname, and it works since he won’t give me a real one.

“October 5th, 2018, James smith.”

I had stopped walking, because well, what the hell?

“Okay?” I had been so confused! Like how do you react to that!?

De hadn’t responded, so I shook it off as him just being weird again, he does that sometimes, just pops off with random shit, I am used to it. 

I had gotten home and everything was normal, De started talking like normal once I got back to my room, filling the silence of my house as I did my school work and practiced lines.

Honestly, I had forgotten about the whole thing up until the next Thursday came around and he again popped off with, “October 5th, 2019, Luna fitches.” After that, I was a bit put off, and I swear to god someone was following me home that night. He then repeated that same thing, over and over and over again. I didn’t get any sleep that night, every time I shut my eyes I would hear some weird tapping on my window, or my door creek open, only for nothing to be there when I opened my eyes.

This continued for the next week.

And then again, the same thing, after rehearsal, this time in the car from the backseat, “October 5th, 2020, harry franks.” All night, the same phrase, again and again! Every single night. He won’t stop, and I keep hearing whispering, something about a KC being unwell, I don’t know a KC! My name isn’t even related to KC, my name is Ash Flyn.

I tried telling a teacher about it, but they didn't listen. 

So I dealt with it, and it stayed the same until next Thursday. Wanna know what happened?

You guessed it, “October 5th, 2021, Fin Baser.” Again! All, night, long.

The tapping, the voices, the constant repeat, I can’t sleep without waking in a cold sweat due to dreams of people in lab coats hovering over me and injecting weird things into me.

I am so fucking confused right now. No one believes me, and my mom has just been getting angrier with me lately and is pretending I don’t exist, my grades are dropping, my dad is ignoring me and I don’t know what to do! De won’t answer my questions and I haven’t slept in nearly a week. I am scared of leaving my house and I don’t even know why! I feel sick, I can't eat because De will start SCREAMING if I pick anything up! I am living off water and I am so, so tired. I keep blacking out, and I think death is a better option at this point!

I am scared, Thursday is 2 days away, and I don’t know what to do about it. I need to-

Oh shit, they are calling for me, I will try and update later. Cya.

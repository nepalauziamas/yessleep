A few weeks ago my friend Jon and I were on a hike in my local woods which we were just exploring hoping to stumble across an old abandoned house that other explorers say "looks to be frozen in time." We were in the woods for several hours until we finally came across it. Brick home with a tin roof sitting in the middle of this dense forest. It was so strange and spooky yet there was an air of mystique and beauty. Although initially Jon and I were very creeped out we still decided to go in and see the inside for ourselves. We went through the front door that lead to a living room. Inside the living room were two chairs and a couch. The carpet was a dull blue color and same with the chairs meanwhile the couch had an off yellow color. Everything was still perfectly preserved as if it was back in the 50s.

"What do you think Yohan?" Jon said and in turn, broke the deafening silence that lingered in the old home. 

"Well... it is a cool place. I wonder why someone would build a house in the middle of a thick forest." I said while rubbing the back of my neck. 

"I read online that the home was owned by a rich family and was built as a summer home. But they all disappeared after a really bad storm. The last thing heard was from a passing trucker who picked up a radio signal. It was just kids screaming and something sounded like growling after a minute it all stopped." He said as he was pulling up the article on his phone.  

"Well, it seems like the place is largely untouched as if there wasn't a big fight or something." I looked around noting all of the small knicks and damages but there weren't much more than a few scuffs on the floor. There was something that was off there was no dust on any surface as if it was preserved in time. We explored the home more and went into the basement first. The air was cool and stale in the basement. Not much there was disturbed either. The only thing we thought was weird was the black circle in the middle of the basement. Jon pointed out it to be a family portrait but all of their eyes are scratched out and there's blood on it. 

We both thought it was creepy but this was a popular spot in my city so it would make sense there are some assholes out there who would do this to a relic of the past. We passed it up and left it where it was. We then headed upstairs and got to the master bedroom. The door was bolted shut and had massive claw marks on the outside of it. There was so much damage that there were some parts of the door that was split open and you can see through it. Jon had the idea to slip a hanger wire through the hole and unlock the door. We looked high and low and finally found a wire hanger in the basement where some old clothes were. 

I straightened the wire out and slowly fished around but to no avail. Jon asked if he could try and about three minutes later we hear a click. The door creaked open and revealed four skeletons. The smaller ones we assumed were the kids and the adults were largely separated. Limbs on the bed and the floor near the door. There was also a few ribs by the closet. 

The children were huddled on the bed but both of their skulls were missing. We kept looking around and saw a note that was written in German with a small box with wax inside the keyhole. This was carved on the box.  "אל תפתח שד בפנים" we at the time didn't know what it meant but it was Hebrew so that's all we knew. On the letter, it said this

 "Der König der Dämonen hat uns nachts gejagt. Wir haben uns im Zimmer versteckt, aber die Tür hält nicht. Gott beschütze uns" 

We had no clue what it said at the time. Well, when we were about to leave my friend somehow was able to open the box when I wasn't looking. When I turned to look at him he had a pale expression and he said "I hear the dogs... They are coming." I didn't know what he meant but I had never seen my friend this way before. He had a look of fear in his eyes something far deeper than failing a test or something small. It was a primal fear, the sweat down his brow was causing him to blink and he started to hyperventilate. 

Shortly after I heard him start to cry as he yelled "I can smell them... I can hear them calling out to me..." Thinking this was some sick prank I decided to shake him and try to get him to calm down. Nothing I did work that's when I realized he wasn't kidding. He told me to run but all the windows were boarded up and there was only one exit. I looked around and saw the closet and hid inside it. It was a thin wooden door with slats but it was my best bet. I tried to pull my friend but he just pushed me away and yelled to hide. 

I sat in that closet silently watching my friend stare at the door. Minutes pass that felt like hours. I was about to walk out until I hear him crying and begging for his life. I couldn't see what he saw.  Jon falls to the ground... The sound of ripping flesh and bloodcurdling screams filled the silence. I saw my friend get ripped apart inch by inch. They were tearing off his muscles with each tendon snapping off the bone like a rubber band breaking. The invisible hounds kept ripping him apart until he was nothing but a puddle of bone, blood, and sinew. 

The taste of rust filled the air and a puddle of blood pooled up where his body was. I couldn't hear the beasts that killed my friend but I know they were there. I stayed in that closet for almost two hours before I decided to run out of the house. When I got home I called the police and told them what I heard and saw. However, when they got there weren't a single body just old bones. I shuddered when I heard the news and couldn't believe what I heard. 

It's been two weeks since the incident and I haven't seen or heard from Jon... until this morning. When I woke up I got dressed and ready for school like normal. My professor was going to hold a meeting about the new Webb discoveries and the photos. I walked into class feeling depressed again and I was hoping to power through this course. While the professor was presenting the new slides and photos  Jon walked through the door. Everyone turned to see him and greeted him as if he was just late and was never gone. Jon sat next to me and asked if I was ok... 

He smelled of death and decay and I am writing this now because I can hear him calling my name and deep growling at 1.00 am... I live alone and have no pets... I am sorry mom... I love you.

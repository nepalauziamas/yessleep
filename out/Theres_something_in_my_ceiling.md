JUNE 9TH 12:30 PM 
today our sink clogged and because my room is in the basement under the kitchen, a hole had to be cut into my ceiling to fix the pipes. I don’t mind it much it just looks kind of ugly 

JUNE 11TH 8:26AM

Recently I’ve been hearing shuffling sounds at night, though whenever I show signs of being awake they stop. I think it’s my cat.

JUNE 12TH 6:38PM 

the pipes are fixed but dad hasn’t fixed my ceiling yet, he says “it’s a waste of money”. I guess he’s right but it’s starting to scare me, I swear I can see something up there staring at me sometimes.

JUNE 16TH 7:42AM

My cat doesn’t want to go in my room anymore so I had to move his food bowls into my bathroom. Last time I tried bringing him into my room he clawed at me until I dropped him. I’ve been asking dad to fix the hole more but he still won’t listen.

JUNE 30TH 2:12PM

I’m sorry it’s been so long since I’ve last written, my diary went missing and I didn’t find it until today. I’m scared of the hole in my ceiling now, I keep begging dad to fix it. I think my cat was right for not wanting to go near it.

JULY 2ND 2:57 AM 

I woke up to some odd sounds, though it’s probably just my cat. Come to think of it I haven’t see him recently, though I keep needing to refill his food bowl so I suppose he’s somewhere.

JULY 2ND 3:04 AM 
 
i saw something it was all curled up and I could only see it’s back but it was in my ceiling. I’m scared.

JULY 3RD 2:08PM

Dad still won’t fix it, I told him what I saw but he just said “people see shapes in the dark so it’s nothing now stop acting like a child” he actually yelled that last part. He always yells.

JULY 3RD 8:39 PM

I refused to go back into my room. Dad yelled at first but eventually gave up and let me sleep on the couch upstairs. I’m starting to worry about my cat I haven’t seen him in a while but as I said In a previous entry he must be ok because he’s still eating. I have to go to bed now.

JULY 5TH 3:26PM 

My room is starting to smell bad, I don’t know where the smell is coming from but it won’t go away. It’s driving dad crazy.

JULY 8TH 4:06 PM 

We found out what was making my room smell bad. It was my cat. Parts of him were missing. He’s been dead for a while so why did his food keep disappearing?


JULY 10TH 7:27 AM

I think dad is getting scared to. He put cameras in my room but so far they haven’t seen anything.

JULY 15TH 11:28 PM

dad made me sleep in my room tonight, I’m scared. I swear I can see something in my tv's reflection but I’m to scared to look up.
I think it has something sharp in its hand.

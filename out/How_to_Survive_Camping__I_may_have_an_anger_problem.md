I run a private campground.  [Last post](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/mqiczy/how_to_survive_camping_a_tongue_of_bone/) I asked all of you a question about how to manage it and the consensus appears to be to leave the harvesters alone.  There were some really good suggestions on how to handle the harvesters and the people that encounter them.  I liked the idea of having a sort of instructional hand-out for people, so that they come back and eventually receive whatever item the harvesters fashion for them.  I’m thinking of titling it “So you’ve survived an encounter with the inhuman” and maybe doing the “Captain America sitting in a chair” pose on the cover but I’m not actually that photogenic so I’m not sure on that one.

Maybe I can get Beau to pose for me. 🤔

Anyway, If you’re new here you should really [start at the beginning](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/clp5h4/how_to_survive_camping/) and if you’re totally lost, [this might help](https://www.reddit.com/r/goatvalleycampgrounds/comments/fz6a1d/how_to_survive_camping_index/).

If you read the title of this post and thought, ‘yeah no kidding’, okay, I guess that’s fair, but up until now it’s been *manageable.* Sure I’ve had to make my share of apologies over the years and there’s been maybe a couple bodies both human and inhuman that resulted from it but overall it hasn’t been catastrophic, right?  None of us are without our flaws.  At least I’m aware of this one and can take measures to prevent it from making mess of things.  You know.  Like preparing the agenda for a meeting far in advance so that I don’t get surprised and my brain doesn’t activate the part that goes OPEN ALL THE HATCHES, RELEASE THE ADRENALINE, WE GOTTA PUT A MOUNTAIN LION IN A CHOKEHOLD except the mountain lion is one of my employees asking why they’re not allowed to have locks on their lockers, that’s such a stupid policy.

(it is a stupid policy. It is no longer a policy.  I’m not sure why it was ever policy in the first place)

I feel like I veer wildly between my extremes.  Without my anger, I can’t even hurt my mortal enemy.  With my anger, I could kill a wanna-be god.

My anger is no longer a manageable problem.  And it has become so due to forces outside of my control.

The problem starts with rule #1.

If you hear something trying to enter your tent at night, sit up and say in a clear, calm voice that you are not receiving visitors, but it is welcome to visit in the morning. If a stranger appears the next day asking for entrance to your camp, invite them in and give them food and drink. This will give you good luck for the rest of your stay.

I’ve talked about this one before and the general consensus among everyone seemed to be that the visitor is one of the more benevolent entities of the campground.  It’s easy enough to survive, provided you keep calm and remember what you’re supposed to do.  And not only do you survive it, but you can then receive its blessing.

Honestly, I was considering it as a candidate for becoming the ancient thing.  It already takes care of campers, provided you show it hospitality.  I think Beau is setting himself up for the position better, since there’s apparently prerequisites that need to be met, but I wouldn’t mind the visitor being in the running, should it take an interest.

Look at me, calmly considering what it is that’ll kill me someday.  I’ve always known that the land will be what takes my life, but to contemplate it this calmly, this rationally… feels wrong.

Maybe this is why my anger has taken such a bad turn.

Not that any of it matters.  I’m no longer so certain I will get a choice.

We were hosting a small event and had a decent number of campers on site.  I won’t say what the event was, as I feel it prudent to protect the privacy of any organization that rents the campground, but it wasn’t a very large group and they didn’t have a lot of money on hand to spend on a venue.  This was why they had their event early in the year, when it’s still getting cold out at night.  My costs scale with demand.

I received a phone call to the camp emergency line.  It wasn’t the only one I’ve gotten during the event.  I had someone call about frost on their tent and when I went out there to check on them, it was just normal night frost on the exterior of the nylon.  Annoying to be dragged out of bed for, certainly, but I’d rather that then they dismiss it as inconsequential and it turns out to be *the* frost.  Especially with how aggressive it’s gotten this year.

There was another emergency call that turned out to be someone drunk dialing the number.  They’d put it in their phone and for some reason it was in their phonebook as “Manager, Campground” which put it next to “Mom” so I guess I saved someone from drunk dialing their mother at two in the morning.  Honestly, I’d rather they have woken up their mom.  Trying to impress upon a drunk person that I can’t have them repeatedly calling this line and tying up the emergency number was a challenge.

I had to fit that in between them trying to tell me about that time they were sick and asked their mom to save them a brownie for when they got better, only to have their mom eat the brownie ‘so it wouldn’t go stale’.  So if there’s a mother out there reading this that recognizes this incident, your child was not kidding when they said they’d never let you forget you ate their brownie.

Honestly I’ve considered hiring someone to field emergency calls overnight so I don’t get woken up all the time, but I’m sure I’d have to increase someone’s salary to get them to work nights and I’d rather just take a nap during the day. With the hammock monster gone there’s a lot of new napping options available.

The only real emergency call we had was about the visitor.  I didn’t get a call from someone panicking because something was trying to get into their tent.  He’d already had that happen and while terrifying, I’m sure, he handled it as he was supposed to.  He sat up in his sleeping bag and announced that he wasn’t receiving visitors.  Then the creature left and he was alone with just the sound of the night breeze and the distant call of an owl.

That’s when he called the emergency line.

“What was that bullshit?” he said, after I got done confirming that he wasn’t in immediate danger.  “That *thing* was trying to get in my tent!”

Yes, yes that’s what it does.  But so long as he told it to go away and come back in the morning, everything would be fine.  I wasn’t giving him my full attention, I admit.  I was tired.  I wanted to go back to sleep.

“I didn’t tell it to come back,” he grumbled.  “I don’t want anything to do with it.”

We know the pattern works.  We don’t know what happens when someone deviates because we don’t do experiments around here.  It’s a good way to get yourself killed, as I’m sure you’ve all seen from my own instances of going against the status quo over the past year or so.  So when the camper told me he hadn’t invited the visitor back, my blood ran cold.

“I’m going to come take a look around your site to make sure everything is okay.  If you see headlights, it’s just the four-wheeler.”

I was getting out of bed as I said this.  The camper started to reply that he didn’t want me coming out there, he’d already had his sleep interrupted enough, but I was too annoyed to care.  I hung up on him and was left with the blissful quiet of my empty house and the weeping girl outside.  I hastily dressed and hurried out to the garage to get the four-wheeler.

The night was cool with a touch of a breeze, perhaps just enough to form a fine frost on the budding leaves before morning.  The hills were slowly, resolutely, turning green and with their awakening came a stirring in the creatures of this land.  Everything was coming alive.  *Everything*.

Have you ever walked in the woods in early spring and felt like you could walk for days without tiring?  Like you felt alive, like you were being renewed along with the new leaves and new growth?  There is a reason for this feeling.  Enjoy the strength it gives you, but take care not to stray off the past, lest the forest swallow you up for good.

I was careful to keep to the road as I made my way towards the campsite in question.  I’d at least gotten him to give me where he was located before he turned difficult about things.  I stopped the four-wheeler a little bit off from the tents and turned the engine off.  I’d go on foot the rest of the way.  There was no sense in needlessly antagonizing him further and besides, his campmates *were* trying to sleep.  It’s not until our big events that we have roaming patrols all through the night.

We’re not just trying to keep people safe from inhuman things.  We’re trying to keep people safe from themselves.  There’s a lot of drinking at these events, after all.

But this was one of the more quiet events.  The only sound was the crunch of gravel underneath my feet as I approached.  I kept my flashlight beam low to the ground, illuminating only my steps so that I didn’t trip over anything.  This group hadn’t followed rule #2.

Place solar lights near your tent stakes. This will keep people from tripping over them or the ropes at night.

Lots of people don’t, especially at smaller events when tents have room to spread out.  It’s really more of a recommendation, to be honest.  Follow it if it makes sense.

I picked my way carefully through the tents, taking care to be as quiet as I could.  Nothing seemed amiss.  As far as I could tell, I was the only person walking around through here.  The visitor may have truly left.  Perhaps the ‘come back tomorrow’ bit of the formula wasn’t necessary.  Perhaps the invitation to come back later was implied in the dismissal.  I fervently hoped so.

Then I heard a tent unzip and I groaned inwardly.  I desperately hoped it was just someone that had to take a piss in the middle of the night, but I knew that I wasn’t so lucky.  Sure enough, the person made their way directly towards me and I could see from their outline that they were a man.  Broad-shouldered and tall.

“I said I didn’t need anyone to come out here,” he hissed as he got closer.

“It’s part of my job to make sure everything is okay,” I replied politely.

“Yeah?  Then why not do something about these - these - stupid *pranks*!”

He brandished a piece of paper at me that I could only assume was the pamphlet.  My heart started to pound inside my chest.  This happened sometimes.  After encountering something that they can’t comprehend - no, that they don’t *want* to comprehend - they start inventing reasons it wasn’t real.

I understand.  We want the world to be a safe place.  We want fairytales to remain mere stories, because we know fairytales are warning us of a world where we are subject to powers that far exceed our own.

He was not the first person to blame me.  He won’t be the last.

“This is *bullshit*,” he continued.

“It’s clearly stated in the pamphlet you received,” I replied, using my best manager monotone.  Not quite a customer service voice, there’s a sprinkling of ‘take no shit’ in it.  “You received that in the mail with ample time to cancel your reservation and still receive a full refund.”

“Yeah, but I didn’t - it -”

He couldn’t quite bring himself to finish.  I knew what he was trying to say.  He didn’t think this was real.  Or that if it was, that it would happen to him.   And… something in me snapped.  This isn’t surprising.  I hear this so often and I’m just a bit sick of it.   Look - I get it.  You think you’re safe.  You think your house is secure and there’s nothing out there and the streetlights just *happen* to flicker like that and all the missing people are for boring, mundane reasons.  And you don’t want to hear otherwise.

But you know what?  You’re not safe.  None of us are.  I’m just saying it out-loud instead of lying to you.

This is what I wanted to tell him.  Instead, I did what I always do. I swallowed my anger and it tasted like broken glass in my throat.  And I told him I understood he was unhappy and he could come by tomorrow for a partial refund.  But in the meantime, I still needed to check over the site and in the morning, he needed to invite the visitor in for breakfast and coffee.

“Like hell I will,” he spat, and tore my pamphlet in two.

The shock of it hit me like a bucket of cold water in the face.  Sudden, blinding anger can be like that.  It’s a jolt to the system.  It snaps us out of the world we knew and throws us into a new one where the lines are stark and the edges are sharp and our focus is narrow.

In the distance, something roared.  I knew its voice.

Dawn was hours and hours away, but still, the beast was coming.

“What the hell was that?” the man asked, startled.  He turned to stare in the direction of the sound.

“Go back to your tent,” I said urgently.  “Stay in there, no matter what you hear.”

I wish he had.  I wish… I wish he’d done anything differently.

Instead… he argued.  Well.  More like demanded.  He wanted to know what that noise was, if it was some other “prank”.  And then the beast roared again, but closer, and he started to grow more panicked.  What *was* out there?  And I think he was starting to realize that this wasn’t a game, that this wasn’t a joke, and that the world was much larger than he thought.

He wasn’t going to go back to his tent.  He didn’t even need to say it.  I recognized the terror in him, even if he was trying to hide it with outrage.

“Fine,” I snapped.  “Don’t go to your tent.  But we need to get out of here - fast.  Come on.  I’ve got a four-wheeler by the road.  We’ll go to the office and work on your partial refund.”

I turned my back to him and began to hurry away.  Not quite jogging, but certainly not a leisurely stroll either.  I didn’t look back to see if he was following.  Perhaps if he realized I really would abandon him to his fate, he’d stop being belligerent.

I wasn’t wrong.  He was following.  At least, he was until someone stopped him.

“And where are you going?” a voice said that I did not recognize.  “We have business still.”

They stood somewhere behind me.  I hastily turned, stumbling as I did, and my flashlight beam fell upon the newcomer’s back.  They were perfectly average - average height and average build.  I couldn’t determine their gender.  Inhuman things can be difficult like that.  It doesn’t matter to them, after all.

They were blocking the path of the camper.  He cast a desperate glance across the newcomer’s shoulder, trying to meet my gaze.  I had no help to offer him.  I didn’t know what this was, either.  In the distance, the beast had gone silent, but I knew it was still coming.  I could feel its presence, like a weight on my chest.

“Aren’t you an ungrateful brute,” the creature continued.  “The campground manager has offered up her hospitality and here you are, scorning it.”

Oh no.  No no no.  Hospitality rules.  This was the visitor and it was here because the camper had broken them, first by not inviting it back and then by being rude to me.  But this wasn’t what I wanted, not at *all*.

“He’s fine!” I called out.  “I’m not offended.”

My voice was shaking.  At the edge of the campsite, just beyond the tents, the beast loomed.  Its glowing eyes were fixed on us.  Like a cat preparing to strike.

“Whether or not you take offense matters not,” the creature replied, not turning around, its gaze fixed on the terrified camper.  “There are *rules* to these things.”

“I’m sorry!” the man replied, his voice shrill.  “I shouldn’t have torn the pamphlet up!”

“An apology?  You don’t understand.”

A low rumble split the air.  The man turned and saw the beast standing there, at the edge of the clearing.  He screamed.  And he ran towards me, as my nerve broke as well.  I turned and ran for the four-wheeler.  I threw myself onto it and with shaking fingers, started the ignition.  Then I turned to look to see how far behind me the camper was.  My heart hammered frantically in my chest.  I desperately wanted to flee, to get as far away from the beast as I could, but I had to give him at least a slight chance to also escape.

The visitor had him by the throat.  It held him up in midair.

“You never insult your host.  *Never*,” it snarled.

The man struggled, kicking helplessly in the creature’s grip.  He coughed, gasping for air, clawing frantically at his captor’s fingers.  And I… I thought, I should run out there.  I should beg for the visitor to release him.  Intervene on his behalf.  Surely, surely as the host I had the final say here.

But I remained where I was.  It was like I was rooted to my spot, my fingers frozen on the handlebars of the four-wheeler.  For the beast towered over the pair, blocking out the night sky, its eyes replacing the stars.  I could not move.  Transfixed, *terrified*, at the sight of my death looming so close at hand.

How did my father do it?  How did he go out there, dragging the little girl by the hair, and throw her to the beast?  How did he gather up the courage to stand against it, all by himself?

Anger does that to a person, I guess.  But my reserve of anger was spent and I was left hollow and afraid.

So I fled.  And I heard the beast’s triumphant roar as the visitor threw the camper to it and I heard his screams as it tore him apart.  It reminded me of the little girl.  And I knew that someday that would be me, for I felt its eyes on me the entire time it devoured that camper, boring into my back while I fled for the safety of my house.

It is patient.  It knows.  It *knows* it is my death.

I’m a campground manager and I have yet another missing camper to hide.  I don’t even have the heart to detail what excuses we’re making.  The old sheriff is being the liaison for us with the police force and I’m leaving the details largely up to him.  At least none of the other campers woke up, even with the beast right there, ripping their campmate to shreds mere feet away.  I’m not surprised by these things anymore.  The forest has a way of swallowing up the people it wants gone.

I’m glad I have the old sheriff to help.  Because I just… I keep thinking about the beast.  How it’s the third creature on this land with the potential to ascend.  And how, perhaps, it is even *fated* to ascend.  Maybe I can’t avoid it.  Maybe it’s always been this way.

Because when I got back to the house, I was in a rage.  I stormed into my bedroom and slammed a fist on the window pane.

“Did I call it?” I screamed at the window and at the little girl weeping outside it.  “Am *I* the one doing this?”

Yes.  She said yes.  I am.  It’s me.

We’re connected, the beast and I.  I think I always knew this.  It has our fear.  It is bound to me.  All it lacks is my demise.

My parents always said that when this land turned ancient it would no longer be inhabitable by humankind.  Perhaps this is why.

The land will belong to the beast. [\[x\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/goatvalleycampgrounds/)

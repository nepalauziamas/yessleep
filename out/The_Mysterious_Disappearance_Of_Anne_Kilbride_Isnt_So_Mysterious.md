Anne Kilbride was a very sweet girl, top of the class, captain of the cheerleader squad, college ahead of her and a loving family. Yet, on the night of her school prom, she vanished, no one knew how. Her whole town searched for her, but it turned up nothing. Our town is close to driskling, but it's been abandoned for years, so everyone ruled that place out. Me being an investigative journalist however, I knew that she was abducted, it was too obvious, and I knew that I had to talk to someone with experience in these crimes for an inside knowledge, so I contacted Rob Hunt. Hunt was a former outsourced criminal who did work for all sorts of seedy people, include kidnap. He lived in Spain, but after a hefty sum, I managed to get him to agree to talk to me. 

When he arrived at my apartment, he just looked...bored, but still, he sat down and agreed to talk. The man was 65 and retired, and clearly had a lot of regret. However, he made a deal to talk, and so he did, here's what he said :

" You and your Town already ruled out driskling Mr Baldwin, but just because that sheriff is gone and the girls are freed, doesn't mean it's over. People seem to forget that there was other people involved in that mill scheme. Just because a girls breeding farm has been destroyed, it doesn't mean they've given up. Human trafficking isn't just men luring girls in motels or cars, it's more sophisticated. They use men and women as pickup artists, get them all comfortable and then they strike. The girl you spoke about, Miss Kilbride, her kidnapping wasn't an opportunity, it was organised. Her stepfather, Terry Carlos, is involved in trafficking and prostitution. He marries women with attractive daughters, friends them on Facebook, takes them out for a day and takes a picture to post on Facebook. Then he advertises them to sickos across the world. Afterwards, well, you know the rest. The people running this business are based in Belgium and consist of wealthy men and women, military leaders, high ranking police and government officials and Private University Dean's. Driskling was only a small American investment to them, doesn't bother them. If you want to get back Kilbride then you'll have to go to Belgium and infiltrate the auction. Just because Terry sold her, doesn't mean her owners didn't. I can help from the shadows as an information handler, but I can't get directly involved, good luck Mr Baldwin "

After he finished, I was in shock, I thought these things only existed in Hollywood, I decided not to tell the parents, I was going to Belgium and expose these sick fucks. But I knew that by doing so, I'd be putting my loved one's in danger, but at the same time, I couldn't let a poor girl suffer, so I booked a flight for tomorrow night. In the meantime though, I decided to investigate her stepfather. I went to the Kilbride residence under the guise of collecting information that could be vital in Anne's safe return. Her mom Katy was absolutely distraught, hugging her husband. Terry? He was acting the same, but that's what it was, acting. Katy explained how her and Terry were thinking of divorcing as he felt like the whole thing was his fault by driving Anne only halfway because of a business meeting. Yeah, it's your fault alright you scumbag. Katy was saying that Anne was in high spirits as usual on the morning of her disappearance, but the school called her and told her she never showed up. Katy thought maybe Anne was waiting on her best friend who was running late, but by the evening, that's when she knew someone had taken her. Terry said that Katy called him and when she didn't show up in the evening, he went to look for her but found nothing. It took everything in me not to leap over the coffee table to strangle him. I thanked them both and decided to head home for some rest for the flight. 

Terry came out and thanked me for helping find his stepdaughter, I just gave him a polite smile and wished him goodnight.

" Goodnight Adam " he said in reply and closed the door, the thing is, I'm not originally from this town, and no one knows my name....so how does he?

My very sketchy neighbor has empty bags of plasma in his trash, which I cannot fathom a logical reason as to why.

I never thought i'd post this, but i have to share because i dont know if i am being gaslight or if im losing my marbles.
Quick catchup for those who want to know what happened before without digging forever (my neighboor had what looked like empty medical bags of bluuud on his lawn trash pandas torn up his garbage a few months ago. He picked it up. Pretty uneventful)
Neighboors trash was spread all over the yard, as well as mine and as i was cleaning mine up, i noticed there was again, bags that look like bluuud bags. At least 4 of them. I figured he must not have anything to hide, nobody throws away "sketchy" things in their own trash right?

So i was so curious about the bluud bags i jokingly said " i think your blood bags are attracting the raccoons Gary, maybe you should rinse them out first"

He replied with "what blood bags"

I said "your plasma looking bags, the ones you just picked up. I was kidding, i dont think youre at fault, raccoons probably dont like blood, they arent vampires or wte"

He said "i didnt pick up blood bags, i dont know what youre talking about"

At that point i was thinking ok, my mind played tricks obviously who has blood bags in their trash? 

I said "oh my mistake. They looked kinda similar to the pictures i saw and i watch too much greys anatomy so my mind got carried away hahaha"

He said " WHAT PICTURE? Show me" and this man dropped what he was holding to cross the street to where i was standing. 

I was still wearing my gloves and holding a bag so i said "uh sure, let me go grab my phone ill be right back" i was starting to feel uneasy, so i kind of ran inside and wrote a note on my fridge "gary did it" because i am dramatic that way.

I went back outside and I pulled up the google search for the neighboor, he says "i thought you said you took a picture" 

I said "oh no. I didnt"

Neighboor said "ok"
And walked back to his yard

My husband and the neighboor had a chat later. 
Gary told husband he was going to set a trap for the racoon, tired of cleaning up trash in the morning. 

Really emphasized that anything, big or small, could get seriously injured if they went into his trash ðŸ’€

Gary said he was glad he only had his recycling bags outside and how much easier it is to only clean up bottles and cardboard. 
He also told my husband that a happy wife is a busy wife and that he should help me find a hobby, that he was actually looking for someone to paint his kitchen walls (i used to paint on my spare time) and that i should go over the next day.

I go over the next morning. His house was very clean and well decorated. It was his living room that he wanted painted. 
As i was painting, Gary stayed in the room chating with me. Found out he's a therapist. Gary seems very nice and normal

I said "sorry about yesterday, about the blood bags or what i thought was blood bags i mean" 

He said "That's alright. People can be mistaken sometimes"

I said  "i just get carried away sometimes and my mind just assumed it was blood"

He said (not exactly word for word since im having trouble remembering) "I assure you, i had nothing of the sort in my garbage. I was concerned you were taking pictures of my lawn in it's disaray state, do you have any pictures of it?"

I said "no, i dont have any pictures, sorry. I wouldnt take a picture of your yard like that "

He just stood quiet for like a long time while i worked. 
I then said "anyway its none of my business. Im just happy to be painting. Thanks.

Basically no more chit chat. 
He pays me for the  job, tells me it looks good.

I tell him to have a good day, he said  you too.

Anyway, i had discreetly took a look in the bathroom to see if he had any cancer meds or smth related to him needing medical bags before starting work and no meds ubless he was hiding them from nosy people like me. 
He also insist that he doesnt have anything like medical waste in his trash. 
But i know what i saw, but now im questioning myself. I could have sworn 100% yesterday, but today im starting to have doubts.

5:00 AM. Ever since I was a small child, I always scared of the dark. Now that I am 15, it seems silly for me to be still scared. I have good reason to be, though.

Every year, on the exact same day, at the exact same time, I see it. There's always a thing staring at me in the dark. I used to think it was just my father looking at me, but that's not possible. It doesn't make sense why it's only here at this time, on this day.

5:01 AM. It's always a week before my birthday, and I don't know why. It scares me. It's inhuman and I hate it. I think it might want to harm me. I just noticed every year since I could remember, it's kept getting closer. The first time it was in my parents doorway, across from my toddler bed. The 5th, in my closet. Now, it's in my bathroom doorway, only 4 feet away.

5:03 AM. It's always at 5AM. I should be asleep, but I can't sleep. Even if I do, I wake up, and it's there. It got closer. It's past the doorway now. I swear to God, if the last thing I ever type is some note in my notes app, I will fight God.

5:08 AM. Maybe I should go downstairs and get it some cookies, maybe it'll leave me alone. I just realized how tall it is. This man is taller than my doorway. I wonder if it can hear me. I've always been to afraid to speak or move in front of it.

5:09 AM. Yeah, it can hear me. And I shouldn't do that. It took one step (I guess) closer and now I'm scared. I did say it should be in the NBA, maybe that's why it got mad.

5:10 AM. Holy shit. I can see it's face now. It has sunken eyes and a sharp nose. It's smile my room, but I'm scared it'll chase me or something. Even if it doesn't, I don't want my mom to yell at me for still being up.

5:12 AM. Maybe I should text my friends I love them. Or maybe I should try to go to sleep. Yeah, maybe this is just a continuous hallucination from insomnia. Alright going to try that.

5:14 AM. Nope. Didn't fall asleep, it's still here. Am I going to die young? Who knows. Am I going to be torn to shreds by a shadow creature? Maybe not. Maybe it just wants some tea.

5:15 AM. Okay, yeah. It's definitely coming closer. It's halfway to my bed now. I don't want to die like this. I'm only 15. I'm almost 16. I want to be able to drive. But no! Some weird ass demon has to come and kill me.

5:24 AM. Oh my God. I actually was able to get some sleep. It's gone. Hopefully it's not just hiding. I'm going back to sleep. If I wake up with it staring at me, I am going to be pissed.

5:30 AM. I'm currently staring at it. It's staring at me. I guess this is my fate.

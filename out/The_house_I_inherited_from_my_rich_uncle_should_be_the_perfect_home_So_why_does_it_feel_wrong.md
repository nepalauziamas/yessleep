There is a manor house stained against a green hill with its dark reflective windows, its hickory trees lining the drive, its foundation testing the soil. The wrought iron fencing that marks its territory is overgrown in ivy and only the gate remains cleared. Stereotype dictates there should be trespassers like vagrants looking for respite from the elements or school children daring one another to venture near its doors. Given its reputation, this ought to be expected. There are no vagrants or rapscallions. There is only the house, sitting quiet for more than two centuries, intact and well-kept in the wilds of southwest Virginia. Its hinges seem oiled, its walls and floors miraculously uninfected. There are no gardeners, no maids or servants of any kind. The house remains alone and has done so since before I was born. Alone, except for one person.

Just outside of the Hillsville township, the house belonged to a deceased uncle of mine. He received it upon his father’s death; as it had always been, the house passed from eldest child to eldest child in the line, but my uncle never had children.

The parcel I received from the executor of the will contained three things: a letter asking me to meet for paperwork, a key, and a page sealed in an envelope with wax. 

The last item seemed to be from my uncle. His sloppy cursive should’ve been hard to read, but I knew what it said once I’d folded the words out across my lap:

*Christopher. You cannot sell it and you cannot destroy it. I am sorry.*

*Love you.*

Simple and brief as the man when he was alive. 

As much as I ignored the phone calls, the executor, an oldish fellow named Phil with a deep, deep drawl, asked me to meet him at a Tastee-Freez a mile from the old Hillsville courthouse.

“Suicide!” declared the old man. His hair was thinning along the front of his hairline, and over a thin mouth he wore a neat rectangular mustache. His suit was tan and spotted with stains. We sat in the parking lot of the Tastee-Freez, around a mesh metal picnic table. It was just me and him; a few other patrons sat in their vehicles, awaiting waitstaff to come out and fill their orders. I don’t guess anyone heard what he’d said.

“He killed himself?”

Phil nodded enthusiastically then sympathetically, as though it took him a moment to realize how grim it might sound to be so nonchalant about a man’s death.

“Could you show me where?” I’d ordered a basket of fries but couldn’t touch a single one. Knots twisted in my stomach; looking at the clouds—it could rain any minute.

The old man removed a hanky from his breast pocket and ran it over his mustache. “I don’t think I should.” He remained staring at the table for a moment, perhaps through the little holes of the metal mesh. Then, he snapped out of it. “Perhaps I could.” He stifled a ponderous chuckle. “I could do that, but it’s morbid, ain’t it?”

“I guess.”

“You—” he started, “You weren’t close with your uncle, were you?”

“When I was little.”

“Not so much anymore? Why’s that?”

I took a deep sigh. “I’d like to see the house?”

“Have you been there before?”

“Sometimes. When I was little.”

“So, you know the way?”

“Yes.” I said impulsively.

The car ride there, following Phil’s Impala, was quiet even with the radio going. There are times when all noise is drowned out by thought—there is no better description.

My uncle’s house—that’s what it had always been to me—had a long snaking driveway that seemed to grow with the landscape, not fight it; it was not an alien concept, a road. It moved with the land and the hickory trees going by made it feel more like I was entering a tunnel or going underground. Or being swallowed. When the trees and the hedges broke, there was the house standing tall and gray even against gathered storm clouds.

The gate stood open and mine and Phil’s cars took the roundabout that encircled a crumbling fountain, overgrown with ivy and sprouts of weeds at its base. We halted at the house’s main steps and killed our engines.

Jutting out from the face of house was an overhang supported by fat roman columns so that the whole grand porch remained in shadow. Dead leaves stayed gathered around the sides of its walls, around the columns, and attached to windowsills. Even beyond the outer decay, the structure was alive and unwieldly against nature; like it refused to rot.

“You have the key?” asked Phil.

I nodded and removed it from my pocket. Before I had a moment to use it, the old man snatched it from my hand, slammed it into the double doors and pushed into a gaping room. I followed and stared up at the foyer’s ceiling, at the balcony walkway that lined the second floor, at the cobwebbed chandelier dangling over the granite floor. Phil returned the key to me while I remained entranced. Even visiting as a child I’d felt small; somehow while I stood alongside the old man, I felt smaller than even then. 

“She’s a beeoot’, ain’t she?” Phill too was taking in the delicate molding and etchings that remained unaged along the edges of the walls. “Most places when they get old have a smell,” Phil motioned his hands in front of his body with flat palms and audibly took in air through his nostrils, “Not this place though. Smells like roses—er coffee?”

“It smells like a home,” I spoke without thinking.

Phil snapped his fingers. “Hot-dog, that’s it. Just like a home!”

I stopped there in the open room of the foyer and took a moment to study the furniture. “A bit bare, ain’t it?” There were two tables with clear, glass vases flanking the grand staircase; dead flowers hung their heads over the vases’ mouths while their stems floated in browned stagnant water. 

He nodded. “Yes. Seems your uncle remained in the study mostly. Basically, he lived there.” He motioned vaguely up the stairs. “That’s where the—erm.” A nervous cough escaped him, and he instinctively reached for his hanky to cover his mouth. 

“That’s where he did it?”

Phil nodded.

“Will you take me there?”

“Well, yes, but you outta’ know I hired a crew to clean it after the incident, but his personal affects remain. His bed and clothes and books. Notes too. He wrote sometimes. Did you know that?”

I nodded. “He’s the one that got me started in writing. His favorite was always Faulkner.”

“Bah!” said Phil, “Classics are okay, but too dense for me. I read a chapter of Grisham before bed and I’m out like a light.”

The old man led the way up the staircase, taking careful measure to grip the handrail with every step. And I followed as he continued with his ramblings.

“He was always up in his study, writing, reading, closing himself off from the world. Must’ve been a lonely life like that. Can’t even imagine.” We reached the top of the stairs where the balcony walkways sprouted off to the left and right. He pushed left and I examined the bare walls as I followed. “He liked poetry and history, but you’d think a history buff, especially someone with an estate the size of his, would own more pieces of it.” 

“His estate?”

Phil nodded. “Of course. Your uncle was a smart one. His investments were numerous.” The old man spun on his heel to look me in the eyes. “You should know that he thought his assets ought to be liquidated then donated. What a headache that’s been.” He said it like a statement, but it seemed as though he expected me to contest it; I remained quiet. After a brief moment, we continued down the walkway until we reached a closed door on our right; all of the others in the house had remained open that I’d seen, but there it was. “Everything sold and gone. Except for this.” Phill patted the framing around the closed door. “This is yours now.” He removed a small keyring from his pocket, searched for the right one and unlocked the door. Then he tossed me the keyring and pushed inward into a room with natural light. 

This was the last room my uncle spent his time before he’d decided to remove the antique Armalite from over the fireplace in the dining hall. The room was almost cozy when juxtaposed with the rest of the house where all things were open, gaping, impossible. Shoved in the corner, beside a desk, was an unmade twin mattress. On the opposite wall, there stood several cheap-looking bookcases with tomes so old, some of the spines were worn thin to the string bindings.

“Everything’s just as he left it,” said Phil, “Well, except the—” his voice trailed off. I imagine the next word was blood. Brains? It couldn’t have been “cotton candy”, but I’ll never know.

I shifted around in the smallish room. “How did you know my uncle?”

“Jack? Me and him go back a ways.” Phil thought while tapping his foot and shoved his fists into his slack’s pockets. “Officially, I’m his lawyer. *Was* his lawyer. But he’d come out for card games with me and a few of the guys from my firm. Work’s up near Winston, so I guess the drive got to be too much for him.”

“You seem pretty upbeat about it.”

“Upbeat? About his death?” There was a meager smile then a permanent frown while he shifted from one foot to the other. He removed his hands from his pockets, twisting the gold band on his left ring finger. “No. But when you get to be my age and you’ve lost so many.” He exhaled air and his cheeks deflated like a balloon. “What’s one more? I have no intentions of being crass. I am sorry for your loss, but I feel like your uncle leaving all this for me—to execute his will—it feels like a punishment. Like he was mad at me for something. Maybe he wasn’t. Maybe he trusted no one else. If so, that’s sad. But I haven’t enjoyed a moment of it.”

Taking a look around the room, at the walls of the house, then gazing out through the doorway, over the balcony ledge, into the vast place, I blurted out, “I know exactly what you mean.”

Once the house was officially mine in ink, the thought of contacting a realtor crossed my mind, but the letter left by my late uncle returned to me: 

*It cannot be sold. It cannot be destroyed.*

Then came the unpleasantness of visiting the dead man's grave. I never know what I am supposed to do at the cemetery. Should I speak to the dead like they were there? That seems silly. Maybe I should leave flowers to die. Poor, poor flowers that never did nothing to nobody. 

The family plot was mostly forgotten and, on a backroad, stretching onward towards Woodlawn. I approached the grave with a bottle of champagne. After emptying my bladder across Uncle Jack’s headstone, I drank the bottle in quiet before driving myself to the apartment that I shared with my fiancé. We lived nearer Roanoke, but even the long drive hadn’t cleansed my breath of the alcohol.

Maryann didn’t scold me; she didn’t even ask me if I was alright; just like me she was never good at comforting or expressing concern. Even still, she rubbed between my shoulder blades and let me cry.

Upon seeing the house, Maryann was immediately captivated with its size. As we breached the threshold of the foyer to the dining hall, we found it mostly bare, and our footsteps echoed off the granite like a museum. An old, rusted phonograph sat in the corner among other boxes of rubbish, and she attempted to turn it on with no success. Ignoring it, she smiled, pulled me in close with her arms around my shoulders and shuffled me into a silent dance.

“I really like it,” she said, “I really, really like it.”

“You should see the backyard,” I said, looking past her nose to my feet.

“It’s too big.”

I nodded. “It is.”

“Say it again,” she whispered, “say it’s too much. We’d always have too much empty space.”

“We’d have too much empty space.”

“Then why does it smell so good in here?” She turned her head so that her brown hair caught around her throat. She was looking at the high windows, through them, out onto the wilderness beyond the fencing; perhaps if one where to squint they’d see other houses from atop our hill. “The sun comes in through there and warms the whole place. It’s nice here.” She put her head against my chest.

The house was ours and whether by virtue of it being a grand old house or by some other reason, we moved. Just as all people see the innate beauty in an old place worth loving, worth work, with the potential of a home, we packed our things and went.

Just as we’d imagined, the house was too large for us, and as said, we’d always have too much empty space. Still, was like being caught in a dream with limitless possibilities. 

Like giggling children, we scampered through the house sometime around evening when we should’ve been unpacking; we played hide and seek. I counted to sixty with my eyes closed at the steps in the foyer, allowed her to disappear, and walked through the house.

When I found Maryann, she hid in the kitchen, in a cabinet. When it was my turn to hide, I felt the keyring in my pocket. I could go into my uncle’s study and lock it behind me. She’d never find me there. This thought was fleeting, and I marched to the den on the opposite side of the house from the dining hall. Within sat a wardrobe that towered over all of the other strewn, mismatched furniture. Hearing Maryann shout from the Foyer as she counted down, I opened the doors of the wardrobe and lifted myself inside, my body pressed against folds of old coats hanging inside. Gingerly, I pulled the doors shut, submerging myself in absolute blackness; I could not even see the crack where the wardrobe doors met to latch closed. What if I were to be locked inside? What if no one could hear me and I’d be trapped there forever? A mere fantasy.

I held my breath, closed my eyes, and counted a few seconds to calm the claustrophobia. Then all was quiet. I could not hear Maryann’s counting or footsteps. I could not smell the sweet smell of the house. I could only hear my own heartbeat like it was reverberating off the walls of the wardrobe, muffled by the layers of wool coats I’d tangled myself in. There was dust all around me, and the daunting hammer drum of my pulse. Suddenly, I felt the compulsion to lunge from the wardrobe for fresh air. What if, by some luck, I rocked the container forward onto its face? Then I would be trapped inside, with its doors beneath me. I didn’t think Maryann would have the strength to move it. I didn’t think I would have the strength.

Gasping for breath in the darkness, I reached out and clutched one of the coat sleeves, only wanting something to hold onto for comfort. I rubbed the sleeve between my fingers, hoping for it to occupy my mind. What I felt between my forefinger and thumb as I explored was unexpected: soft smooth hair. Biting my tongue, I felt my way up the length of hair until my hand touched flesh, skin over muscle, a forehead, down the bridge of someone’s nose.

Then I felt them pinpricks around my throat, sending a shockwave through my body, tensing my spine, cramping my guts. It was fingers. Fingers, long and pressing into my neck. I felt fingernails entering around my collar, cold skin. 

“Maryann?” I whimpered stupidly into the dark.

No answer came. I felt the face, tried slapping it away. Someone was strangling me in the dark. I yelped and it felt as though the fingers might meet so deeply that they’d shred my vocal cords. Tears exploded from my eyelids. My own voice was shrill off the walls. And there was nothing to see. I panicked and thrashed in the dark, whipping coats and hair and I smelled soil and feces and sweat. Had I shit myself?

In a moment, I burst from the wardrobe and met the hard floor of the den on my hands and knees. Maryann darted through the threshold just as I choked through tears, “Someone’s tried to kill me!”

I whipped around to look at the open mouth of the wardrobe to see nothing but disheveled wool coats. I felt around my throat with shaking hands; there was a formal tie clinging there. I withdrew it from around my head and slammed it to my feet as I stood. Double-checking I had not actually crapped my pants, I wiped tears from my eyes.

Maryann flanked me, examining the wardrobe. “Did you choke yourself?”

Looking at the tie at my feet, I kicked it. “Must’ve gotten tangled around me while I was hiding.” I know that was not true. Someone was in that wardrobe with me.

Stomping forward, mildly tentative, I raked the coats from within onto the floor. There was nothing and no one.

I felt Maryann’s hand on my shoulder, and I flinched. She pressed firmly. “Are you alright?”

“Yeah,” I said dumbly, looking at the coats, kicking them around.

“Let’s get something to eat?”

I swallowed, feeling soreness as I did so. “Okay.”
  
We shared a platter of deli cold cuts and cans of Sprite for dinner in the dining hall and slept on a blowup mattress in the master bedroom nearest the posterior of the house. The only light we had was from our cellphones, and I incessantly checked mine long after she’d fallen asleep just so I wouldn’t be left in the dark alone.

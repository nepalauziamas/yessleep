If you would have asked me if things could get even more strange and fucked up, I would have said hardly. Oh, how wrong I was. The shit I’ve experienced previously is nothing compared to what I’m going to tell you. I have read the comments on your theories, and you are both right and wrong. I’m currently safe and unharmed, but I am at my breaking point and don’t know how much more I can handle. This is what has happened since the last post.

When I touched the amulet and it burned me, my heart sank, and I thought this was the end of the line for me. I looked at the driver which appeared to be human, but the amulet and instincts said he was not. If this is the end, then I might as well put everything on the line, because what else do I have to lose? I took a few moments to gather up courage and asked

“Are you from the company or are you something else?” but got no response. “I asked you a question!” I said in an angrier tone. He then turned around and almost gave me a heart attack. He had pale skin with hollow eyes and no other facial features and waved his hand, causing me to lose consciousness.

Next thing I knew, I woke up in my apartment and felt more rested than I’ve ever been. I got up and went to make coffee to make sense of what happened since the guest apartment. It was then I found a letter at the door. Remembering the rule, I looked at it and the letter had the company logo on it. This is what it said.

John

You have lasted longer than any other guest before you and proven yourself capable of surviving the horrors of this place. We are very impressed with you and want to offer you a position within our company. If you join us John, we will nullify your contract and you will be free to live your life, but you will serve us until you die. Should you not accept our offer, then good luck at surviving until your contract with us expires. We want your answer as quickly as possible.

Don’t forget, the rules still apply.

The Owner

What in the everlasting fuck I thought and dropped my coffee. I read the letter repeatedly and it sent chills down my spine every time I read it. Thousands of thoughts rushed through my mind and I had to sit down. I can’t do this anymore, so I went and grabbed my cellphone and it said 7pm. I called my friend who I stayed with before moving and told her I am in desperate need of help.

She arrived 30 minutes later to my place and I nearly crushed her in a hug. After talking a few minutes, I showed her the rules. If you have forgotten about them here, they are.

She looked at me like I was going to burst out saying “it’s a prank” but my serious expression told her I was dead serious. I then showed her the letter I received, and she looked at me questioning and said. “Why do you give me an empty paper?” This sent off alarm bells in my head as I could perfectly read what it said. Now you may wonder why I did something like this, bringing in a visitor. Because I wanted to see if I'm still sane or if I have completely lost it.

You know what John; this was a mistake she replied and went to grab her coat when the doorbell rang. I sprinted towards her and said in a whisper do not answer it.

“Hello, may I come in?”  A male voice said.

"What is the matter with you?" She replied silently only for her body to stiffen as it said “**You must let me in, open the damn door!”** in the same demonic voice that made my blood freeze. I dragged her back to the couch, and we sat in silence as the demon or what it was banged and yelled for us to let it in.

After it had stopped, she looked at me in fear and said “is this for real, have you been living with this all this time? I nodded in response and told her you must follow the rules. I then told her about everything that had happened to me since I moved in, including the letter that only I could read. 

“You must do something John, call the police, the FBI, the freaking army” she said after I finished my story. “You don’t think I’ve thought about that, but what would I say?” “Hey, I live in a supernatural apartment were some deeply disturbing shit goes on and I have to follow a list of rules that sets off supernatural calamities? They would send me to the mental asylum.”

Before we could continue our conversation, the lights went out and my amulet begun to burn. Come I said and grabbed her and rushed into the bathroom and put the drape up around the bathtub. The creature arrived and I had to hold her mouth to prevent her from screaming. We stood dead silent as the creature sniffed around. I had counted how long it’s been since the lights went out and it had been more than five minutes. Shit, I thought now terrified, this is not supposed to happen just as I heard a deep growl coming from inside the bathroom.

However, as the creature approached us the lights went on and the movements stopped, but the amulet was still burning. It was then I realized my mistake. I tore down the drape grabbed her hand and we made a run to the door. I had completely forgotten that I have a little mirror on the shower bar facing the direction I stood in. As we made our way to the door, I looked back and saw a twisted version of myself smiling at us. I unlocked the door and managed to shut it as the twisted version of me ran into it.

“What on this earth was that?” she asked terrified as we ran through the hallways. “Something fucked up,” I replied. I heard a demonic laughter behind us as the evil me had managed to leave the apartment and ran after us. We approached the stairwell only to have the creature from before stand in front of it. I’m sorry I said to her, for getting you involved. While I make a run for it, I will lead them away from you and give you the chance to escape. Not listening for a reply, I took off.

My idea worked as they went off after me. As I ran from evil me and a large dog-bear like creature with gray fur, burning eyes and a twisted face, an idea came into my head. I ran to another staircase and down to the basement with them following me. I managed to open the door to the basement fully. The two creatures rushed into it and as they did, I pulled the door shut. I could hear a terrifying growl from within as they banged on the door trying to escape before going silent.

I sat down at the door, not realizing how out of breath I was. After resting for a few minutes, I went back to my apartment and on my way there the amulet did not burn. I sat down on the couch when my phone rang. With shaking hands, I looked at it and the display said unknown number. I answered it and heard a very deep and dark voice say, “**Well done!”**

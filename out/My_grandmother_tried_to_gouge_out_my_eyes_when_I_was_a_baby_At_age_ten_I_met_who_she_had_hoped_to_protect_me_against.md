[My childhood was not a happy one.](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/je6pz8/my_grandmother_tried_to_gouge_out_my_eyes_when_i/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share)
 Under different circumstances, it probably would have been. My parents loved each other and they loved me; I grew up getting to taste the delicious cooking of my sweet, kind grandmother nearly every day; I was raised in a beautiful house in a friendly neighborhood. 

Something was wrong though. I didn't notice it at first. I was way too young to realize that my parents were just a little too careful with every single thing they did, that I was never left alone for even a single minute, be it night or day, or that in every room in the house, there'd be weird little flasks that normally wouldn't belong. The first time I ever paid these particular objects any notice was at the age of seven or eight. I grabbed one from its place on the windowsill and carried it over to my grandma who was sitting in her armchair reading a magazine. I won't pretend I remember every detail of our exchange, but I think it went like so.

"What's this?" I asked her. 

She looked up and her eyes grew wide. "Put that back by the window, sweetheart," she told me, a sense of urgency in her voice. I did and she nodded in approval. "That's a witch jar. There's different flowers and herbs in it, as well as some salt, iron nails, holy water and…" She paused to clear her throat. "And pee."

I pulled a face and laughed. "Gross! Why's pee in there?" 

"Believe it or not, but we actually think it might help keep us safe. You know, from bad things." 

"Why are they everywhere?"

Grandma gave me a sad smile. "Because you never know how strong these bad things might be. We need to be very careful." 

I think I asked some more questions, but she remained evasive and eventually offered to bake me some cookies which pretty much caused me to forget all about it. So that was the first small step I took in trying to find out what was behind my family's odd behavior. 

School wasn't easy for me. I soon found that I had trouble making friends. I was shy and hardly ever spoke in front of other people. Perhaps this insecurity that accompanied me throughout my early years had its origin in my parents' protectiveness. Being around grown-ups all the time didn't give me much time to figure myself out, or other kids my age for that matter. I did have one friend though; a girl by the name of Camille. 

Camille was my best friend and, as I already mentioned, my only one for that matter. I found her company fully sufficient though. We were as close as two tiny humans can get. We would have sleepovers regularly, although they were always at my place; we'd sit side by side in class whenever we got the chance and spent our breaks skipping rope and playing soccer, that kind of thing. Sometimes, one really good friend is better than a dozen acquaintances, and I wouldn't have traded Camille for any number of those. 

The first time I truly came close to the man from among the alder trees was when I was ten years old. It was one of these gray days with an ashen sky and little sunlight. It was a weekday so I had class. That was the first time I heard his voice. I think it was English at the time. We were taught to spell something, I don't remember what, but it was some long, arguably difficult words, I suppose. 

My teacher–I can't seem to recall her name, but she was a well-dressed, nice lady in her forties with pretty blond hair–was standing in front of us with an encouraging smile on her face. "Persuasion," she said aloud. "How do you spell persuasion? Anyone?" 

I liked Miss Blonde. I really wanted to answer but I actually had no idea how to spell that particular word. I had always been alright in school. While I was not the smartest, I was motivated to learn and I did try hard and always gave my best. And then, suddenly, somebody *spoke*. 

"P-E-R-S-U-A-S-I-O-N."

The voice was that of a man, deep and strangely smooth. It reminded me of that of my father. It should have startled me, but it was too warm to frighten me, too soft. I spun around, trying to locate the source, but found only my classmates behind and Camille next to me. I was about to open my mouth and say something in response, but I was cut off again. 

"Don't talk to me, it'll just confuse everybody. You're the only one who can hear me. Speak up now. That was P-E-R-S-U-A-S-I-O-N. Persuasion." 

I didn't quite feel like refusing. I raised my hand and spelled out the word in front of all the class. It was correct. Miss Blonde gave us another word. Again, the voice in my head spelled it out for me and I repeated it out loud when nobody else knew the answer. I eventually asked if I could go to the bathroom and when the teacher allowed it, I got up and left. I found the toilets empty, safe for myself of course. Satisfied, I locked myself into one of the stalls. 

"Who's there?" I asked quietly. 

"Me," the same voice replied.

"Who are you?" 

"You wouldn't know. It's okay though, I want to be your friend."

"I don't like this." I don't know if that's exactly what I said, but I did express my concern and uncomfort in some way. 

"Why? Don't you want another friend? You only have one, there should be room enough for me." He sounded mildly amused.

"I'm good," I said. "Please leave."

"You're breaking my heart," he answered in mock-sadness. "You can't be happy with just one friend."

"I'm plenty happy. One is enough. Are you like a ghost or something?" I asked resignedly. I had always firmly believed in the supernatural, a trait my young age had certainly contributed to, so while I didn't want this voice in my head, I almost instantly accepted its existence.

"Maybe a little bit. Why, do I scare you?"

"No," I responded truthfully. "Not really. So how does this work, do you see me? Can you read my mind?"

He laughed. "I can't read your mind. But I do see you and I hear you when you speak to me, as well as all that surrounds you."

"Where are you watching me from? Where are you right now?" 

"I don't want to say," he told me. 

"Can you stop watching me?"

"I don't intend to, no."

I hadn't been scared earlier, but by then I was feeling a bit uncomfortable. "Why not?" 

"I told you. I'd like to be friends."

"And I said no, now scram!" I kicked the stall door in frustration.

For a while, all was silent, but somehow, I knew he wasn't gone. When he spoke up again, his voice was empty, void of any emotion, it seemed. "You should go back to class now."

And that's what I did. He remained silent until the bell rang and everyone got up from their tables to leave the room. Despite the chilly breeze blowing outside, I opted to spend the break in the schoolyard on the jungle gym with my best friend. I had been wondering if I should tell Camille about the voice, but something inside me urged me not to. Not because I *wanted* to keep it a secret though. 

Do you know what it feels like to be aware of somebody else's presence even if they're out of your sight? All this time, the voice had been quiet, but I felt like it wasn't gone yet. It hadn't left. Whoever had been talking to me was still there, still watching me, still waiting, even though I didn't know what for. 

The schoolyard jungle gym had this net-like structure made of rope which you could climb up onto. The only way to get to it was over the monkey bars. It was just high enough to be hard to reach for children our age, but unlike me, Camille was excellent at climbing. I couldn't even get a good grip on the bars, let alone drag myself all the way over to the net platform. I had asked her to teach me quite often, but even though she tried to coach me and even attempted to pull me up a few times when she was already sitting on the net, my efforts were never rewarded. I wasn't exactly the athletic type. 

There were only a few kids outside that day. We went for the swingset first, but after a while of swinging, two boys came and said it was their turn. We didn't really want to give up the swings, but they said they'd push us down if they had to, so we reluctantly fled the scene. I told Camille I wanted to grab a snack from my backpack which I had left inside and she said she'd wait on the jungle gym. I watched as she reached up for the monkey bars and swung over to the net before pulling herself up. She waved at me and I waved back, then ran for my bag. I think it was some kind of fruit I picked, an apple or a banana maybe. I wasted no time and ate it on my way back out, tossed whatever was left of it into one of the trash cans outside and then made my way over to the jungle gym. 

I didn't see her lying on the ground at first. Or maybe I did and it just didn't register. The screams of the other children who had witnessed her fall only actually reached me when I was standing just a few feet away from her. There was blood pooling around her head. It was flowing out from under her heap of curly dark hair. Her neck was craned and it was like she was staring up at me, but the angle wasn't right. Her eyes were wide open too. 

"Camille?" 

I said her name as if to get her attention. As if to wake her up. Her eyes remained unfocused though. Her mouth was open, but she didn't speak. It wouldn't close either. I took a step toward her. My head felt strangely empty, like I wasn't thinking anything at all at that very moment. I took another step towards her. My legs felt unusually light and unsteady beneath me. I wasn't quite beside her yet, but I didn't want to get any closer. Something told me to stay away; just an instinct, not an actual voice this time. Somewhere in the back of my mind, I must have known already. I must have been screaming already. I slowly reached out to touch her, my tiny hand inching closer to her tiny hand which was resting upturned right next to her head. 

But the second my fingertips grazed her palm, someone grabbed me from behind and pulled me back, forcing me to turn away from her body. I recognized the young teacher who had been supervising the schoolyard with her colleague that day. She ushered me away, tears in her eyes, and led me back into the building, away from my friend. Apparently, the other teacher had run to call for help and she had been too busy getting the kids that had seen Camille fall to go inside to notice me emerge from the door right behind the jungle gym. She kept whispering words of apology to me, saying she shouldn't have let me see Camille. 

I think that was when the realization sank in. I started to cry and scream and only quieted down again when my mother appeared in the hall, seemingly out of nowhere and still in her office clothes, and took me into her arms.

The impossibility of the whole situation would go on to confound many people. Not only had this accident been the most tragic thing to ever occur on school property, it was also nearly inexplicable. The jungle gym was located in a sandbox. Kids would fall down from there all the time, none of them had ever gotten hurt. Camille shouldn't have landed in the way she did, and even then, the impact of the fall shouldn't have killed her. However more than enough people–both teachers and six children plus a janitor who had coincidentally been looking out the window that time–had witnessed that exact thing happen and confirmed it was true. 

I spoke up to my parents about the voice. They must have known what was going on, even though they would only fully explain it to me two years later. They did tell me to come to them about it the second I would hear it from then on. Looking back, we all knew what had happened. I think somehow even I did, young as I was. I soon found that the voice was incapable of following me home, probably due to the many precautions my family had met. But just before he left me alone for that day, he said one last thing. I was sitting in the back of my mom's car, huddled up in the corner and on our way home, still weeping. 

"Got room for a new friend *now*?"

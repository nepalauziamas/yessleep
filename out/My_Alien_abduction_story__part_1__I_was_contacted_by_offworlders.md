Hello everyone. I don’t really know where to start. 

So I think it’s a good idea to introduce myself first. 

I’m a 41 year old male, I prefer not to mention where I’m from for obvious reasons. I use to work in IT, but decided to move to the country side and live a quiet live, spend time in nature and just live off the land as much as possible. Both my girlfriend and myself are spiritual people, I mean we are into nature and energies. 

My girlfriend still travels often for work or to visit her family, where I prefer to leave the property as little as possible. 

I recently had a strange experience, now let me make this clear that I’ve never believed in aliens or the supernatural, but for some reason the aliens and supernatural seems to believe in me and are drawn to me.

So I will start with my first experience here, I had a few, so please bare with me. 

So back to my experience, well it all started off like any other normal day for me, well as normal as life can be when you live in the middle of nowhere in the mountains, I don’t know how or when they took me, but the first thing I remember, I was standing on the edge of a cliff on another planet, I knew I wasn’t on earth because their sun was a bluish color, their air is much cleaner then ours and their forests stretch as far as the eyes can see. 

Infront of me stood a few of these very tall beings, and I mean they were like double my height if not taller, they were these beautiful human looking beings, but much taller then any human I’ve ever seen, their leaders appeared to all be female. 

They have the most beautiful eyes, I can’t even describe the color of their eyes, it’s unlike any color I’ve ever seen before, they had long straight hair and looked human in every way, well besides the fact that they are perfect, no imperfections on their skin or anywhere. 

I felt like I was going to have a heart attack, realizing that I was no longer on earth and at the mercy of these beings, was I dead? Are they Angels? Demons? What do they want with me? 

They spoke to me and they told me that they took me because I got their attention because of my way of life and according to them I have been speaking to them telepathically. 

They said that they have been watching our world for a very long time, since before humans developed languages. They saved us from extinction multiple times, I asked them why and they said they had great hopes for humanity to become a great species, humanity showed signs of intellect and compassion and a survival instinct rarely seen on young worlds. 

At this stage I got pretty annoyed, if they could hear me, why not talk back? Why not make contact with me on earth and ask me if they can take me on this little adventure?

As of reading my mind the one speaking which I found out was their leader said that she understands my frustration, but if they spoke to me then I would most likely have thought I’m going insane, or just blocked them off. And that they can’t exactly just walk up to a human on earth and introduce themselves, they are not the only species around and there are other advanced races already on earth. She also said that I mustn’t worry about getting back, and that nobody will notice that I am even missing, they have the technology to bend time and when I get back only a few hours would have passed back home. But that they needed to make contact and show me around. 

I then calmed down and decided to have an open mind. I asked her why earth? She said the planet is of interest to them, “What do you mean of interest?” Then they told me the shocking truth, Earth is older then we think, but humanity has destroyed the eco system in a very short time, they have helped us survive various extinction events, but now they regret it’, they regret teaching us languages and helping us develop in our earlier years. So I asked my burning question, why not land on earth and meet with our leaders, she then said which one? We got too many leaders and none of them can be trusted, most of them are in alliances with other offworld races already, that our leaders are driven by greed and a hunger for power, which are been satisfied by their scaly friends. 

They showed me their history, they use to be the same as humanity, divided and driven by greed, eventually war broke out and their home world was destroyed, luckily they were already advanced at the time and many of them made it off their world in time. They travelled for years searching for a new home, which they found, they learned to evolve past their natural habits and got rid of greed, violence, crime and selfishness, they’ve had a peaceful civilisation now for longer then humanity has existed, 

Their worlds are run by counsels, the counsels consist of females, yes they are also male and female in gender. 

They showed me their planet and their cities, their buildings are build of some sort of metal, but it doesn’t reflect sunlight, instead it absorbs it and Transfuse it into their energy grid, they have no pollution, they generate energy from their stars, vibrations and from the kinetic energy generated from their planet moving around its axes and their star. 

They told me to look up and I could see their ships in orbit, well what I will refer to as their jump ships, the sheer size of their ships gave me the chills, if I could see them as clearly in orbit in day time as we can see the full moon at night then I can just imagine how large they are, and as if knowing my thoughts the leader spoke again, she explained to me that one of their ships is as large as one of our largest cities on earth, but the reason we can’t see or detect them on earth when they enter our orbit is because their stealth technology is far more advanced then we humans can comprehend, they are thousands, hundreds of thousands of years more advanced then us, they have already terraformed and colonised hundreds of worlds in their galaxy. Galaxy? I mean aren’t you from the same galaxy as us? How do you even get to our galaxy? How did you even find our planet? 

She sighed, like she explained they are far more advanced then we can comprehend, and not just on a technological level, but also on a physical and mental level, they have mastered telepathy and telepathy is the only immediate communication in the universe, that they found our world because there has always been a few humans with the gift, even before we learned to develop language thoughts formed and it got their attention. 

But how do you get to earth if you are not even from our galaxy? She said she will explain and I must not worry, I will experience it soon enough when they take me home. She proceeded to explain that there is a few ways to travel though space, but the fastest way is by fracturing space, it’s almost immediate, but it relies on using what we humans would refer to as dark matter. But more on that later. 

She showed me what their old world looked like, how it was destroyed, that is when I realized how close we are to self destruction on earth, but I also realized where the reptilian race evolved from and my heart sank in my chest again, does that mean? She said “yes, the reptilians was another race they had contact with, but just like humanity, the reptilians were beyond reach. “  

Indeed they were similar to us, different classes of people, greedy, violent and selfish. Then war broke out over the most basic resources as they have polluted most of their water, drinkable water became a rare commodity, food was scarce, they have mined their world to the point of eradicating every natural resource, their air became toxic and they had to work harder to just be able to earn breathable air, rashes of food and drinkable water became a norm on their home world. Their governments became more and more corrupt, but a few private people decided to use their wealth to get as many people off the planet as possible, they could see the signs of the coming war, they had weapons similar to our nukes, most of their ships made it safely off the planet when the war broke out, the last few ships were either damaged or destroyed before they could leave their planet. 

After leaving their world and watching on from afar as their planet lit up from the war they swore to never let it happen again. 

They eventually found a new home and started over, they worked hard to get where they are now. 

They are one of the oldest races in the known galaxies. 

I asked them why don’t they intervene on earth, they said they have tried. But learned that our people can be destructive and manipulative. They first found us before the dinosaurs were destroyed, they saw how humanity had little chance of survival with these great beasts around and therefore decided to shelter the humans they could find in cities they build for them, then they used their jump ships weapon systems to direct 2 asteroids at earth. This wiped out the beasts, but caused a nuclear winter which lasted for years, they used this time to teach humanity language and how to communicate and organize, how to make basic tools and how to survive. When the nuclear winter ended they left, thinking we have learned how to evolve. But when they came back they realized that we have evolved, but not in the way they had hoped, we became greedy, selfish, violent and destructive, people build their own little kingdoms and attacked each other. They decided to intervene again, they landed one of their smaller ships on earth and tried to interact with us, they tried to trade with humanity and show humanity that we can advance if we unite. But people tried to attack them and steal from them. After a few years they abandoned the city they build on earth and took their landing ship and left, but to avoid humanity from getting their hands on their advanced city they destroyed the island from orbit. 

They have tried to contact a few individuals over time, but every time they did a new religion just ended up forming. 

They said they are no longer interfering, but when the time comes they will take humans who transcended past their natural ways off world and help them start afresh, they can see the signs of other off world races influence on our world, our time is running out, they said that our technology is still very young and they can access everything on our planet, they have shown me things our governments are doing in secret, weapons that’s been build in secret that makes our nukes look like toy guns, mind control experiments going on, they even knew about Covid, the lockdowns and the vaccines years ago, they showed me that it’s all part of other off worlders plans to colonise earth. Eventually the vaccines will rewrite peoples dna till humans will no longer look human, the effects are not immediate, but in a few generations their will be no humans left on earth. They’ve seen this done to multiple worlds. 

For now many humans are resisting, and that showed them there is hope, and they will return to rescue the humans who resisted when the time is right, but they also warned me that if it does come to it that they will not hesitate to destroy the other races on earth including humanity to safe the planet, and that currently it does look like the only option left to stop the current invasion and stop another planet from been destroyed. 

They then told me it’s time to take me home, we walked through a door made of what seems to be pure light, the next moment we were on their ship. Even though the ship is made of some sort of metal, I could see everything around us. 

She spoke in a very strange language which I can’t even describe and 2 of their crew members wearing these strange suits climb into pods which closed behind them, she explained to me that the suits allows them to merge with the ship and pilot it with their minds, they know and see and feel everything around and on the ship. 

She explained to me that they have no weapons on their planet, but that nothing can get through their planetary defense system, they use vibration and gravity weapons which can destroy any ship that enters their solar system which is a threat before the enemy even know they are there. 

Then suddenly the whole ship started lighting up and it felt like my body was getting crushed and pulled apart at the same time, it felt like I was freezing and burning at the same time, she apologized to me for it and said that unfortunately the modifications they made to me won’t start kicking in for atleast a few years, but the experiments, modifications and implant was needed to awaken my hidden dna code, that I was actually genetically engineered by them and then implanted into a human’s womb. But she promises that next time I won’t feel like this, the explained to me that it’s happening because they are releasing dark matter around the ship to fracture space and as the dark matter particles clash against each other it’s basically ripping space apart creating a fracture, that the feeling will only last a few Minutes, after what felt like an eternity of the light getting brighter and my body been crushed and pulled apart it stopped, I could see earth and we arrived in orbit. I was home, but she then said she wants to show me something, she gave an order in her language and on the walls dots appeared. She then zoomed in on one and it was another alien craft in orbit, she said there are hundreds of them, I was about to open my mouth to ask a question, but she said that they can’t see or detect her peoples ships, that her race is far more advanced.

She said it’s time for me to go home, but that they now have a telepathic connection with me and I will see them again. 

I just hope they were honest and that they are not our enemies, because if they were lying and they are our enemies then earth has no chance and something tells me it’s already too late for humanity, we are already been invaded. 

Sorry, I’m writing this down over a few days as they implanted me with a chip in my neck that is linked to my brain and spine, I can’t actually speak about them or my experience, I tried to tell people, but I can’t. I found that when I write it down it takes longer for the chip to activate and sedate me. 

I’m back home now, but I know that they have altered me in ways I can’t describe. I have lost all interest in things I use to enjoy, my relationship has fallen apart as suddenly I don’t understand humans obsession with sex, I find it primitive. But the worst part is that I can hear my abductors in my mind, flooding my mind with their language, showing me visions of how easily they can invade and defeat humanity, I know an invasion is coming, I just don’t know which species is going to invade earth first, and something tells me that my abductors are not friendly, I might have been made or created by them, but I was born on earth, I see myself as human. 

I’m writing this to warn my fellow humans that an invasion is coming, well it’s already happening, and unless we unite and learn to work together and stand together as a species we have less then no chance. 

They are advanced, smart, united and they can have a ship in orbit right now and we won’t know it. 

I have to go now, they know what I’m doing, the chip in my neck has activated, I can feel it trying to sedate me again, my doctor has already confirmed a tumor like substance in my neck that cannot be removed without killing me, so I’m at their mercy, but you don’t need to me, I need to go now, I’m feeling very tired and I need to sleep.

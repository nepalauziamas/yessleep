The history of La Corde Bleue is both complex and bloody and yet for all the stories told about it, very few people have ever actually heard of the infamous opera. In the history of French theatre, you’re unlikely to ever hear any reference to it, and even those who are deeply familiar with the world of opera regard it as either an urban legend or a hoax. However, despite these misconceptions, the opera is quite real, as is its history. Though it has never been successfully performed, La Corde Bleue is perhaps one of the most mysterious and fascinating pieces that exist in the storied history of French theatre and that so few people have ever heard of it is an almost irreconcilable tragedy.

&#x200B;

From what I’ve gathered over the years, La Corde Bleue *(Translated as ‘The Blue Rope’)* was allegedly written in 1882 although the author remains unknown to this day. From what I’ve learned from the attempted original performance, the *livret* (The script, for those not versed in opera) had been obtained by a composer named Georges Laurent from a friend of a friend.

&#x200B;

Laurent said in a personal journal entry that a friend of his had brought it to him after a business associate had discovered the completed *livret* in the possession of his daughter, following her untimely death. Laurent believed that the girl had hung herself from a tree in the family’s garden, although he was not aware as to why she’d chosen to take her own life.

&#x200B;

His friend had been given the livret in the hopes that he might see fit to pass it to Laurent, perhaps in memory of the poor girl. Evidently, Laurent had been impressed with the quality of her work (If indeed the livret was originally her work) and in his journals, describes having only made some slight modifications to ensure that the girl’s work would translate well to the stage.

&#x200B;

Whether he chose to work on the opera out of some sense of altruism or due to its quality, Laurents personal journals made it clear that he certainly thought highly of the work. I’ve read these journals myself and I’ve noticed that he speaks at length about the opera, at times even going so far as to describe it as a masterpiece.

&#x200B;

Incidentally, it is only through Laurents notes that I’ve managed to form a rough synopsis of the opera as well and I will describe it here.

&#x200B;

The opera has five acts and follows a young woman named Zélie. (Meant to be a soprano). The first act is set in the streets of an unnamed city, where Zélie lives alone in an old shack. The overture establishes that young lovers have a little red rope tied to their hearts that connects them and ultimately draws them together. The first song (during which Zélie remains silent) details various friends and family who she has known throughout her life and how they have gone on to experience love while she has remained alone, losing her parents and tending to her ramshackle home by herself.

&#x200B;

Following the overture, the lonely Zélie sings to lament the fact that the rope tied to her own heart is blue and she does not understand it. The act ends with her seeing a man passing by while out in the street with a blue rope similar to hers, and concluding that he must be her soulmate.

&#x200B;

In the second act, Zélie seeks out and finds the man. Discovering him to be the son of a wealthy family named Gabriel. After some effort to get his attention, she succeeds and feels certain that they have fallen in love.

&#x200B;

However, as the third act begins, Gabriel rebuffs her dismissing the blue rope as meaningless and insisting that he has found someone else to love without a rope. Heartbroken, Zélie laments her loneliness and confronts the possibility that she is not meant to be loved.

&#x200B;

This is where the opera becomes most interesting.

&#x200B;

In the fourth act, she confronts the woman who has stolen the affections of the man she loves. There is an extended duet here between Zélie and the other woman, named Theoline. During the duet, both women plead their case to the other for who should have Gabriel’s heart, with Zélie adamant that fate has dictated that they be together and Theoline trying to reason with her that she is basing all of her hopes for love on her notions of fate, even going so far as to show Zélie that she had cut her own red string long ago, as she was dissatisfied with where fate would have taken her. During their duet, Theoline encourages Zélie to do the same and free herself of Gabriel, so that she may pursue someone better suited for her and ultimately offers her a dagger, with which to free herself. At the crux of the duet, however, Zélie takes the dagger and drives it into Theolines heart, murdering her.

&#x200B;

In the final act, Zélie is confronted in her home by Gabriel who realizes that she had murdered Theoline. After sharing a dance and a duet, Gabriel seizes her by the throat with the intent of killing her, but Zélie instead kills him in self defense with the same dagger she’d used to murder Theoline.

&#x200B;

Reacting with horror at the fact that she has slaughtered her beloved, Zélie flees her home and walks down to the ocean, her final song lamenting her understanding that the blue rope did not link her to love, but to misery. The opera ends as she walks into the sea to drown, and prays that there is nothing waiting for her afterward so that she may for once know peace.

&#x200B;

Laurent seemed impressed by the cynical, tragic nature of the livret and even more impressed by the music provided. His journal indicated that he expected the performance to be a success. Unfortunately, he never got the chance to find out.

&#x200B;

On December 18th, 1884, the Opéra Germain where La Corde Bleue was meant to be performed a few days later was destroyed during a fire that was believed to have started backstage. The performance was in rehearsal at the time, and when the fire struck, much of the cast was quickly trapped and unable to escape. Georges Laurent was amongst the bodies later identified amongst the ashes, along with much of the primary cast. Needless to say, the debut performance of La Corde Bleue had just been canceled.

&#x200B;

Opéra Germain had not been quite as grand as some of the other opera houses in Paris at the time and the whispers of arson ultimately led the owners of the property to sell it and leave Paris. Opéra Germain was never rebuilt and in its place today stands an unremarkable office building.

&#x200B;

Many would claim that the unexplained fire at Opéra Germain and the tragic death of Georges Laurent had spelled the end for La Corde Bleue. Some who are aware of the tragedy even claim that the original livret was likely destroyed in the fire. However, this is not believed to be true.

&#x200B;

In 1964, a cousin of the late Georges Laurent, Marc Sinclair put on auction several items he had found relating to his late relative’s career. The auction, held in March of that year included a livret for an unproduced play that Laurent had been working on at the time of his death.

&#x200B;

La Corde Bleue.

&#x200B;

The livret was subsequently purchased by a composer by the name of Hugo Castillon.

&#x200B;

Castillon was an admirer of Laurent, regarding him as one of the underappreciated lost names in French theatre. He believed that by finishing what Laurent had started and finally bringing La Corde Bleue to the audiences of Paris, he could cement the status of his idol as one of the greats. Castillon set to work almost immediately on the performance, with the intent of having it open at the *Palais Garnier* on May 30th of the following year\*.\*

&#x200B;

From what I’ve learned about his efforts to produce La Corde Bleue, Castillon was not fully familiar with the history of the opera. Even if he was, I doubt that it would have dissuaded him. Even if the true author was unknown, both he and others have regarded the opera as Laurents final work, and by all accounts, progress on the production went smoothly. He had cast 22 year old Justine Roubert in the leading role as Zélie, Roubert had previously starred in several of Castillon’s productions and was noted to be an incredible soprano so she was not a surprising choice for Zélie.

&#x200B;

He also cast Charles Dupont in the role of Gabriel, another frequent collaborator. In fact, much of Castillon’s intended cast for the production of La Corde Bleue contained people who he had worked with before in some regard or another, and the production likely would have been as big a hit as Castillon was hoping… If it had ever premiered. I cannot confirm the rumors of difficulties near the end of the production. Despite my best efforts to get in touch with the surviving members of the cast and crew, I have been unable to learn much about what went on behind the scenes of Castillons 1965 production of La Corde Bleue. I only have access to the police report from the most high profile aspect of the production, the murder of Charles Dupont.

&#x200B;

On May 30th, 1965, Dupont’s neighbors reported hearing a loud argument between him and someone else in his apartment. One of those neighbors called the police when they heard sounds of a struggle, fearing that the conflict had escalated. Police responded to the call at around 1:30 in the morning, and after knocking on Dupont’s door with no response, found it open.

&#x200B;

They found his apartment in a state of disarray, suggesting that there had been a physical altercation, and later found Dupont in his kitchen, lying in a pool of his own blood. He had been stabbed 57 times with a kitchen knife. The broken blade was still jutting out of his chest. Police found Justine Roubert in his living room, covered in Dupont’s blood and smoking a cigarette and laughing so hard that tears streamed down her cheeks.

&#x200B;

She was taken into custody and it was later determined that she had been guilty of murdering Dupont during an altercation. Given the circumstances, the opening night of La Corde Bleue was delayed until the following month, before eventually being quietly canceled.

&#x200B;

Roubert was reportedly silent when questioned by the authorities. The only thing she is confirmed to have said following her arrest was: *“Do I ask too much, to be loved?”* A lyric from one of the songs she would have sang as Zélie.

&#x200B;

On June 2nd, a few days after Dupont’s murder, Justine Roubert was found dead in her cell. She had hung herself using her bed sheets. The look on her face was described as one of pure bliss.

&#x200B;

With his production of La Corde Bleue canceled, Castillon focused on other pursuits. In 1966 he produced a romance titled L'été Parmi les Roses (Summer Among the Roses, in English) to middling reviews and focused on distancing himself from the tragedy that had killed his last production.

&#x200B;

However, by all accounts, Castillon was never quite able to forget the unfinished final production of his obscure idol. Even in the months following the cancellation of the production, he was known to speak of it often, and talk about taking another shot at producing it someday. It’s also worth noting that the earlier performances of ‘Summer Among the Roses’ included a solo in the first act sung by the lead, a woman by the name of Chloé titled *‘Chloé’s lament’* which reportedly bore similarities to a solo from the first act of La Corde Bleue. The song was eventually removed from the performance after the actress who had initially been given the role left the play due to *‘health concerns’* and her understudy refused to perform it describing it as *‘Too depressing.’*

&#x200B;

The solo has not been included in any subsequent adaptions of ‘Summer Among the Roses’ (Not that there have been many) and save for one old recording, no copies of the livret exist that include it. That said, if you’re tenacious enough, the recording isn’t that difficult to find and *‘Chloé’s lament’* notably stands out from the rest of the play.

&#x200B;

Most would agree that Castillon was by no means a great composer. Decent, yes. But not great. But even his greatest detractors admit that this is quite possibly his best work. I suppose it shouldn’t be surprising to consider the fact that this most likely isn’t Castillon’s work. Not entirely, at least.

&#x200B;

With slow, heavy piano accompanying it, it is a painfully mournful piece. The actress, Sofie Colbert is immensely talented but it’s admittedly difficult to tell that she’s the one that’s singing. Her voice sounds different, cracking with emotion at some points. There are several moments of silence where she seems to pause to gather her emotions before forcing herself to continue. Having heard it, I don’t really blame Colbert for taking her own life shortly after leaving the production. As good as she was, I don’t think she ever could have surpassed herself there.

&#x200B;

Castillons obsession with La Corde Bleue almost certainly made it inevitable that he would eventually try to make good on his promise to produce it at last and in July of 1969, he formally announced that he would be starting production again. Castillon curiously did not work with many of his long-time collaborators on this project, although that did not seem to dissuade him. He had reportedly cast a newcomer by the name of Elle Lavigne in the role as Zélie and Raymond Hollande, an established actor who he had not worked with before as Gabriel.

&#x200B;

However, unlike his last attempt at producing La Corde Bleue, this effort would not even make it until opening night. A few months later, in November, Castillon abruptly announced his retirement and shut down the production. Details as to why are scarce. But the few contacts I could get in touch with pointed to one incident as a likely cause.

&#x200B;

In early November of 1969, police had been called to address a physical altercation between Elle Lavigne and another actress, the one hired for the role of Theoline. According to one source I spoke to, they believed that an argument had broken out during a rehearsal over Lavigne’s conduct. Lavigne had apparently been too aggressive during a rehearsal of their duet in the fourth act, and when called out on it, she had responded by shouting and making accusations about the other actress and her co-star, Hollande. Eventually, she had escalated the situation by physically attacking the other actress, nearly blinding her in one eye.

&#x200B;

Castillon had gotten involved and Lavigne had been forcibly removed from the set after striking him. The individual I spoke with (Who will remain anonymous, of course) noted that Castillon seemed fairly shaken after what had happened and had officially shut down the production a few days later after firing Lavigne from the show.

&#x200B;

Elle Lavigne went on to briefly star in another production the following year before retiring while Raymond Hollande would, unfortunately, pass away in 1971 during a hit and run that killed him, his wife, and their young daughter. The person responsible was never apprehended. Lavigne herself would later pass away in 1976 when a family member found her body in her parent’s garage. She had hung herself, after what her family described as an extended period of depression.

&#x200B;

Following his retirement, Castillon retreated from the spotlight and retired to a house in the French countryside. From what I’ve learned, he did not have many visitors during the final years of his life and would not discuss Laurents play, La Corde Bleue.

&#x200B;

The only information I have regarding the play during its final years in Castillon possession is that in 1974, a young composer by the name of Gaston Malvy had visited him to ask about purchasing the livret in order to complete the production.

&#x200B;

According to Malvry’s own account, Castillon (who had been perfectly courteous up until that point) grew angry, shouting at him not to discuss the opera and throwing things at him before demanding that he leave. Malvry’s subsequent attempts to get in touch with Castillon were ignored.

&#x200B;

Hugo Castillon eventually passed away in February of 1981 after he reportedly fell into a river while out on a walk. I’ve heard some suggest that his death was a suicide and others simply claim that the old man suffered an unfortunate accident. I really can’t say for sure. What I do know is that during his final years, he had been known to frequently visit the graves of Raymond Hollande and his family, as well as the graves of Charles Dupont and Justine Roubert. After her suicide in 1976, he had been one of the few who had attended the funeral of Elle Lavigne and he had visited her grave several times before his death. Given how close her gravesite was to the river where he drowned, it’s likely that Castillon had visited it on the day of his death.

&#x200B;

Whatever the cause of his death, suicide or tragedy, whatever his reasons for visiting the graves of those who had been connected to his infamous play, Castillons death served as good news for one man.

&#x200B;

Gaston Malvy.

&#x200B;

Malvy had achieved some limited success in the world of opera with a few notable performances of more famous productions and was eager to present something new. With Castillon dead, he approached his eldest daughter, the executor of his estate about purchasing the livret for La Corde Bleue. She clearly didn’t share her late father’s reservations about selling the livret and was happy to part with it.

&#x200B;

Malvy wasted no time in getting to work, eager to finish what both Castillon and Laurent had been unable to. His goal was to have an audience see a production of La Corde Bleue and according to the man himself, he was dedicated to achieving that at any cost.

&#x200B;

By 1982, Malvy had reportedly gotten Jean Pelloux signed on to the role as Gabriel and Esme Lacroix as Theoline. He later signed on an unknown, Fayette D’aureville in the leading role as Zélie after an extensive search. It shouldn’t be surprising at this point, that Malvys production was plagued by trouble.

&#x200B;

While the cast had initially gotten along fine, after the first few months, the relationship between D’aureville and Lacroix was noted to have soured to the point where they were kept apart during rehearsals.

&#x200B;

Six months into production, Pelloux reportedly left the show and filed a restraining order against D’aureville, alleging that she had entered his home and climbed into his bed. He was recast with another unknown, Eric Cellier who was reportedly kept away from both D’aureville and Lacroix when not at rehearsals. Surprisingly, despite these setbacks, Malvy was at least successful in his endeavor.

&#x200B;

On June 10th, 1982, after a century of setbacks and a trail of blood left in its wake, La Corde Bleue finally saw its debut in Paris at the Théâtre de la Ville and I can assure you that it was truly breathtaking.

&#x200B;

You know, I never liked Opera as a child. My father, oh he adored it. But that’s just how he was. A patron of the arts. I don’t think he was familiar with La Corde Bleue when we saw it during its first and final performance. He didn’t know its history. Neither did I, back then. It was just another show that he watched. Not really something I was interested in, but he insisted I go with him. I suppose he thought that opera could be something we could share. A little bit of Father/Son bonding time. Honestly, I can’t fault him for that logic. As I grow older, I find myself thinking of ways to connect with my own children. I want to share my interests with them and learn more about their interests in turn.

&#x200B;

Looking back, I am grateful that he insisted I go along with him. Until that night, I never truly appreciated the beauty of the opera. But La Corde Bleue opened my eyes.

&#x200B;

The blue velvet curtain rose upon a set depicting a busy street. The overture describing the miserable life of Zélie was nice, I suppose but it wasn’t the standout performance. It wasn’t until Zélie herself sang her first solo that I found myself completely and utterly transfixed.

&#x200B;

I used to think that it was the sheer power of Fayette D’aurevilles’ voice, but having heard the bastardization of the song from Summer Among the Roses, I realize that it was not. I’m left with only the faint memories of the way the song is meant to be, but the weathered recording of Sofie Colbert performing Castillon’s imperfect transplant stirs some of those old feelings.

&#x200B;

That one song ignited in me a love for Opera that has lasted throughout my life, and I have been obsessed with it ever since. The harsh, melancholy melody was almost violent in a way. It was as much a song of loneliness and desire as it was a song of hatred. Never before have I heard the darkest parts of the human heart exposed in such a way. This was not a simple solo. It was pain incarnate. The desperate screams from the pained soul of a forgotten girl one hundred years before, suffering an agony I cannot begin to fathom.

&#x200B;

Laurent could not have come close to creating something as brilliant as this. Castillon could only hope to present it to the world and Malvy had succeeded where he failed. But this work belonged to none of them. It was something all its own.

&#x200B;

I watched the remainder of the first act enraptured and as the second act began, I waited with bated breath. D’aureville was a mediocre actress, doe-eyed and unremarkable compared to others I’ve seen. Her voice was spectacular, of course, but the music truly made it soar.

&#x200B;

Compared to her, Cellier as Gabriel left little impression. I’m sure that in more capable hands, the role could be memorable but while I recall him being serviceable he was by no means extraordinary. At the time, I was enthralled but in the decades since I’ve seen better.

&#x200B;

Lacroix as Theoline was out of focus for most of the first two acts and so I can’t comment on the performance she gave. I don’t remember much about her other than her costume but having seen some pictures of her in the years since I do remember her as being in the background at some points.

&#x200B;

While the cast was decent, they were not the true stars of the show. The music was. Malvys mediocrity could water down the actors but the music was something beyond him. It carried that melancholy undercurrent through it, and even during the few upbeat songs during the first and second act, there was always a bitter note in the background. A looming misery waiting to take hold again. Had the cast been downright dreadful, the music alone would have saved the production. Of that, I am certain.

&#x200B;

The intermission came at the end of the second act and when it did, I could not wait for it to be over. I’d never been quite so enthralled by an opera before. I needed to hear more. I needed to hear all of it!

&#x200B;

The theatre was silent, save for the muffled sounds of the audience. The intermission carried on.

And on.

And on.

And when it ended… The play did not begin again.

&#x200B;

The curtain sat there. It did not rise. The audience had returned to their seats and were waiting patiently. But the play did not continue. There was only silence.

&#x200B;

Silence… Until someone pushed the curtain aside and stepped out onto the stage.

&#x200B;

I could recognize Fayette D’aureville despite her costume change, although she didn’t say a word. She simply stared out at the audience, a vacant smile on her lips and the blue rope prop she’d had as part of her costume clutched in her bloody hands. She turned it over, holding it close to her chest, and looked out at the assembled audience. Then, she started to laugh just before someone got up onto the stage to grab her and pull her back behind the curtain. Even when she was gone, her laughter remained. It echoed through the theatre and much like her singing that night, it is a sound I will never forget.

&#x200B;

Soon afterward, a man came up to hastily explain to the audience that there had been an emergency and after that, came the police and the paramedics.

&#x200B;

I’ve learned what really happened that night during the years that have followed. But at the time, all I felt was disappointment, confusion, and rage. For the first time, I’d been enjoying an opera and now it was being cut short? The ushers quickly led us out and the Police spoke to my father before they allowed us to go home.

&#x200B;

As we left the theatre that night, I saw the police cars and the ambulances in the parking lot and knew something horrible had happened. It was a few years before I learned exactly what, however. It seems that during the intermission, D’aureville had entered Celliers dressing room with a box cutter. She had slashed his throat while he was changing. Then, she had gone looking for Lacroix.

&#x200B;

According to one eyewitness, she had found her talking with Malvy backstage. She hadn’t said anything before she’d attacked, brandishing the bloody boxcutter she had just used to murder Cellier.

&#x200B;

She had attacked Lacroix first and managed to leave some deep cuts on her arms and face before Malvy had pulled her off. Unfortunately, there was no one there to pull D’aureville off of him. She had cut his throat during a struggle before going looking for Lacroix again. After failing to find her, she had then proceeded to attack two members of the chorus and a member of the crew before wandering onstage. Lacroix had called the police by that point and some of the theatre’s security had managed to subdue her until they arrived.

&#x200B;

I think it goes without saying what happened next. The pattern should be obvious by now. She was arrested and two days later, a guard found her in her cell, attempting to hang herself using the sheets.

&#x200B;

Despite her best efforts, they managed to stop her and restrain her in the hopes of preventing another suicide attempt. D’aureville simply chewed out her own tongue that very night and drowned in her own blood.

&#x200B;

I’ve heard a lot of things about the aftermath of La Corde Bleues opening night. I’ve heard that there was an investigation into the events of the production but what, if anything came of it I really can’t say. I can tell you with certainty that Esme Lacroix has left the opera for good and lives a quiet life as a housewife in England. It’s a shame. Having reviewed some of her prior work, she really had such talent.

&#x200B;

According to my sources, the original livret of La Corde Bleue was among the items given to Malvys elder brother, Pierre, and as far as I can tell it has remained in his possession. Of course, when I first asked him about this a few years back (around 2004, if I recall correctly) he insisted that he had no idea what I was talking about. Even when I pressed the issue and offered to buy it off of him, he responded by simply growing angry at my poor idea of a ‘joke’.

&#x200B;

We fell out of contact not long after, I suspect due to his displeasure at my mentioning that particular opera.

&#x200B;

Even when Pierre passed away in 2016, I called in a lot of favors and greased a few palms to try and get my hands on that livret. But it would seem that it was not among the items that Pierre left behind after his death. I’ve been in touch with his surviving family members and admittedly taken some fairly extreme measures to confirm that the livret for La Corde Bleue wasn’t passed down to any of them without my knowledge. In fact, for a while, I’ll confess that I’d begun to fear that Pierre had destroyed it.

&#x200B;

But no.

&#x200B;

Through no small amount of digging, I’ve discovered that my late friend happened to maintain a safety deposit box in Paris. It was under the name of another relative, of course. His mothers. But after a lengthy correspondence and no small amount of work I was able to get that box opened.

&#x200B;

Shall I tell you what I found inside?

&#x200B;

I have spent so long learning about this opera. It has occupied my every waking thought for 40 years. The disturbing melodies of the music, the haunting voice of Zélie during her first solo… It is what ignited my love for opera. It is what made me want, no, *need* to become a composer!

&#x200B;

And now I have it.

&#x200B;

I have read through the livret. I have studied the music and it truly is beautiful… Perfect. Something like this should not be locked away. Something like this needs to be shared with the world! I understand that, just like Laurent, Castillon and Malvry did. But unlike them, I understand this opera itself. I understand its history. I understand the agony of the nameless soul that produced it and that makes me and only me equipped to do it *right*.

I will begin production soon.

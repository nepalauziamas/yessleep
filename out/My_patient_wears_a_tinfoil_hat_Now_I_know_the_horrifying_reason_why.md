Sarah sat across from me, wearing a tinfoil hat.

She’d put effort into it. Tinfoil sculpted neatly around her entire head, with a nice little bulb on the top. 

“Can you tell me why you wear that, Sarah?” I asked.

Her eyes darted back and forth, as if the Government – or whatever entity she was afraid of – might hear her. “They’ll listen to my thoughts,” she finally whispered. “And then…”

“I understand. But l can assure you – it’s perfectly safe to remove the tinfoil, Sarah.”

“Really?”

Poor girl. Her lip was trembling, and her eyes were wide with fear. *What made her so afraid? Of the government, or aliens, or whatever else she thinks is listening in on her thoughts?* We’d already investigated her parents. There was no evidence of any sort of abuse. So why was this little 8-year-old girl so scared?

“I know you think, when you take off that hat, that something will listen in on your thoughts. And then, that’d be a disaster, right? Because maybe the government, or aliens, or whatever else is listening will use that to their advantage. They’ll stalk you, or try to control your mind. But that won’t happen, Sarah.”

“But they’ll kill me. When they hear my thoughts, they’ll come in the middle of the night and –”

“Ssssh. None of that is going to happen, Sarah. You’re okay.”

“No, I’m not!” she said, tears brimming in her eyes.

“I promise, you are. There’s nothing to be afraid of, okay? Nothing.” I leaned forward and gave her a smile. “Can you try to take off the hat?”

“No, I don’t want to.”

“Please? Try. For me. I promise – nothing bad will happen.”

She looked around, her face growing pale. “You *promise?”*

“Promise. I’ll even do the pinky thing.”

She finally broke into a smile.

Our pinkies locked. Then she slowly reached up for the tinfoil. She shut her eyes tight.

She yanked it off.

I jumped back. My heart pounded in my chest.

“Dr. Taylor? Are you okay?”

A ringing filled my ears. It gave way to whispers – talking all at once, overlapping and hissing. Some fell away, others intensified, until the words became clear:

*Take that knife from the cabinet.*

*Stab her in the eye with it.*

*Now.*

The voice wasn’t hers. It was low, deep, rasping. The kind of voice that scrapes at your mind, shredding your sanity.

“Sarah?” I asked. But my voice sounded so small.

And then I felt my body move. I clenched my muscles, tried to stop; but nothing happened. My feet shuffled forward, towards the cabinet.

Towards the knife.

Her eyes widened. She reached down and grabbed the tinfoil, pushed it back over her hair. Immediately – the voices extinguished. A dull ringing throbbed in my ears.

“I’m so sorry,” she said, bursting into tears. “I didn’t want you to hear it, Dr. Taylor. That’s why I didn’t want to take it off. That’s why –”

“It’s okay, Sarah,” I said. “You’re going to be okay. I promise.”

But I wasn’t so sure that was a promise I could keep. Because now I knew.

*She doesn’t wear the hat to keep something out.*

*She wears it to keep that voice* [*in.*](http://www.reddit.com/r/blairdaniels)

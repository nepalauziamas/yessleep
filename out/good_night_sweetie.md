This happened to me a when very young like 2 or 3 years old. My family lived in a 2 bedroom house, but my dad was still finishing college and he would only come to our house on the weekends which would cause arguing at my house. During the arguing, I saw a girl in a dirty white dress. The girl had no eyes and her mouth was sewn up but I still heard her distorted laugh.

While laughing she said,"It's okay, come play with me." in a deep, dark voice.

When ever she came it felt like the arguing seemed to stop. It was like the world was gone, like I was away from everything, well, everything real, until it stopped.

The stopping was so abrupt that when it stopped everything hurt and my ears rung on top of the arguing. I felt like my ears were bleeding. Everything was so loud and I wished it wasn't so loud.

That night I went to bed. When I woke up I went to my mom's room to make me breakfast, everything was great for that brief moment. I opened my my mom's room but I stood there with the door knob in hand, I knew something was off, but I persisted. The door creaked when I went in but there was my mom in her bed. I immediately went to my mom, but when I stood over her it was the girl in white with her distorted voice saying,"Come play with me"

When she said that I sprinted out of that room were I was transported back into bed, but I could not move, talk, or do anything besides using eyes to look around. I was looking around with my eyes where I saw the girl cry in a man arms; she was sobbing and in between sobs she was saying,"he's not letting me play with him!"

The man was wearing a singed suit, and fedora. He looked tortured, he had many cuts and gashes in his side and face. He also had a deeper voice than the girl and he said,"I know sweetie your brother is not playing with you. I know your brother has not joined us yet, but I will make sure he will come around.

This shook me, why was he saying that I was her brother, was I dead, was I dreaming. I had to be dreaming there was no way this was real. I kept on saying, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up; but nothing came out. Until it stopped again. This was the second time I woke up abruptly that I was screaming and crying for my mom.

That night I begged my mom not to send me to bed but  she did it anyway. I begged her not to send me to the man. Then she paused,"what man?"

When my mom {who is not religious, but spiritual} heard this she immediately called a mediator. The mediator was skeptical at first because she knew that children are good liars, but she did test in our house.

The mediator looked shocked, she said that there was people in our walls, dead. She said that they were tortured by the wife of the man at a dinner party, and that the house was burned down with all the people in it. 

The last time I saw the girl she was with a woman, that woman had burns on her body and she said in a sweet voice,"Goodnight, Sweetie."

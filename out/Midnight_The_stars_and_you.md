My Friends dragged me to a fancy 1920's themed party, i was unsure about this but i ended up giving in.

They know i'm not a girl that parties a lot or likes loud parties, i'm not even good socializing.
I walked down the hotel's stairs with them, wearing a white 1920's-ish style dress and a faux fur coat, i think i looked pretty nice.
I went into the hall and looked around, dim yellow lights and people with fancy suits and dresses talking by the bar or dancing to the nice band that was playing in the backround, that made me quickly realize that maybe this wasn't for me.

I turned to look at my friend with a sort of insecure look, and she just insists that i should try something, that maybe it would help me to get used to going to more and more parties, it even could get me a man.

I think the part about the man motivated me the most, i had been looking for a boyfriend or even a girlfriend, but the dating websites weren't doing it for me.
They held my hand as we walked into the hall.

The air was warm, the nice music making it feel warmer..

"I like this" i say to my friend, Laila.
"See? It isn't so bad" she replies as she guided me deeper into this party.
My other two friends quickly went to talk to guys, leaving me just with Laila.
I ask to her "What am i supposed to do now?" 
She looks up, trying to think of something.
"Maybe you should simply talk to some people" she finally replied, shrugging.
I just nod, she pat my shoulder and began to walk away.
"I'll be around, call me if you need anything"
I wave goodbye "Oh.. alright, have fun" 
I look down, trying to focus just on myself and take a deep breath, i need to be brave to do this.

When i reassured myself enough, i look up again and i see someone looking at me.
Red hair, pale skin and green eyes. He had a red velvet suit with matching gloves and black shiny shoes, a little off for the 1920's theme. He was staring at me from the bar.

He begans to walk towards me confidently, slightly moving with the music's rythm and a huge charming grin on his face.
My face flushed, i've had a couple of guys stare at me like this but they never are as attractive or even good looking.

"Halò" he says to me in a thick scottish accent.
"Hello" i nod, messing with my gloves
"May i take you to drink something with me?" His grin widened.
I try to play hard to get when i say "not if you don't ask me to dance first" 
And he seems to like it, he chuckles and nods
"May i dance with you?" He offered his hand.
At this point i'm trying to not squeal, i'm trying to keep my cool.
I took his hand and he led me to the dancefloor.
He puts his hand on my waist and holds the other one up, my other hand was wrapped around his neck.
He pulled me closer, i could smell the booze and the expensive cologne.
And we slow danced to the music, he would even hum or sing some of the lyrics.
"You're into the 1920's aren't you?" I chuckle softly
"The songs bring me good memories"
"That's really nice.." 
We dance for a while, we're having a good time.. i'm even fantasazing about having kids with this man i met two minutes ago in the bar of a random party, in a hotel, in the middle of the forest.
We walked back to the bar, so he could finally buy me the drink.
"You never told me your name" he smiled as i sipped the whiskey.
I cough a little, it's kind of too strong for me.
My reply is again, trying to play hard to get 
"You never told me yours" 
He smiled and nodded
"My name is Muriel" 

"My name is Catherine"
 
He gives me another smile, this time a little less charismatic, more unsettling, i start to feel a little weird.

"Nice to meet you, Catherine" Muriel took my hand and kissed it, i just look away.

"Where are you from, Catherine?" He asks
"I'm from London" i hesitantly reply.

He takes his glass "London is a nice place" 
He takes a sip, and i nod again.

I sip my drink, but with every sip i feel the music getting quieter and quieter, it also echoed through my ears and muriel seems more and more unsettling.

His grin widens every time and i just feel myself getting weaker and weaker...

And i start to ask myself, did he drug me?

I put my drink down on the counter.

"It's been a lovely time Muriel, but i really have to go" i stammer "but i'm not feeling well"

I try to walk away but he stops me by grabbing my wrist "wait, Catherine, don't leave yet" 

I get woozier.

"I'm sure it will go away, it's just the alcohol" 

He suddenly gets a glass of water out of nowhere.

I stare at him.

Maybe it is the booze...

I accept and i sit down, sighing.

I drink the water, but it just has the same effect, i feel nauseous and like i'm about to faint.

I spit it out and he just stares at me, wide eyed.

I feel the ball getting less warm and friendly, and more and more unsettling.
Everyone stops dancing to stare at me.

"Catherine you are not supposed to do that." His tone is aggressive

"I'm sorry-" i manage to slur out

"You left me with no choice"

I felt like my eyes were playing a trick on me, his skin started to turn blue-ish and his red hair a weird mint colour

"I was trying to do this in the painless way! I tried being good Catherine" the whites of his eyes turned a dark green, his ears got longer, more like an animal and his canines hung out of his mouth.

I'm terrified, but also i can't move without feeling like everything is in slow motion.

The rest of the people at the ball start to get blurry, it's just me and Muriel and a bottle of whiskey
 
"I tried to kill you without any pain, but you decided that it's going to be my traditional way?" His grin more and more unsettling
"Fine by me you know, i can see your face when i stab you and i eat your guts. One. By. One."

I'm panting, it's getting harder to breathe, i try to get off the stool but i just fall down, i manage to crawl.

"Where are you going Catherine? The party has just started."

He takes the bottle and breaks it, he starts to chase after me.
I can't breathe anymore, he's getting closer and closer, i try dragging myself forward, but i can't anymore, i feel like i'm being choked by something.

I laid limply on the floor before he walked over and got on top of me, he pulls my hair to pull my head up as he sings

“Midnight, with the stars, and you…”

“Midnight, and a rendezvous…”

“Your eyes, held a message tender…”

“Saying ‘I surrender, all my love to you,’...”

“Midnight, brought us sweet romance…”

“I know, all my whole life through…”

“I’ll be remembering you, whatever else I do…”

“Midnight, with the stars, and you…”

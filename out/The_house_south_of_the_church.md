In the last post I wrote that I would keep you updated, if anything more were happening in the house or if we heard anything from the medium.

I’ve started to hear my name being called when I’m alone. The knocking on the doors won’t stop and they’re still walking around in the third floor

When I was in the shower I saw the silhouette of a woman behind the somewhat see-through shower curtains. Even though it made me jump it didn’t really frighten me as much as it should have, as I’ve already heard a woman cough outside the bathroom door a month ago.

When We’re sitting in the living room the intense scent of rotten eggs and spilled milk drowns the whole room.
It stays lingering in the room for a couple of minutes before it vanishes like it never was there in the first place. 

I’ve also heard and seen someone try to open the door from the hallway to the kitchen. As I stood in the kitchen making lunch one weekend. I saw the door handle going slowly down and up but the door never opened, until I went to the door and did it myself. As “expected” there was no one on the other side of the door. 
And before you tell me there could just be wind or draft. There is no windows in the hallway, only a door that’s closed. And the window in the kitchen was also closed. 

On the third floor at the same time 20:45 everyday we can smell heavy cigar and cigarette scents. If I were to guess, it could be the police officer that had his office up there back in the 20’s and 30’s.

The medium my stepmother had a couple of years ago told her that they could see an executioner standing in the cellar. He was dressed in a big and brown coat with a hood. The medium told us that he was not actually “evil”
But a thin young man who actually hated to be an executioner and kill people, but was forced to be one. 

Even though it sounds so surreal and unrealistic. I can’t almost help to believe it because many years ago when my dad and stepmother moved into the house. They had the whole family helping to redecorate some places of the house. 
And when my stepmother and my aunt was down in the cellar to store their stuff. My aunt (who is like my father, doesn’t believe in that stuff) saw a man in the corner of the room and her dog started to bark and growl towards the corner.

Particularly at night, when I’m going down from the third floor where my bedroom is, to the second floor to the bathroom by the hallway. I can feel I’m being watched.
And when I’m going upstairs to the bedroom again I hear there’s someone walking behind me.

This of course can be my mind playing tricks on me. But why would it do that when I’m not paranoid, nor scared of what’s in the house?

I can fully understand if you don’t believe me or the story. Cos it sounds just like your typical budget horror movie. But my wildest imagination couldn’t even make this stuff up.

I’ll keep you updated.

***A half-eaten chocolate bar, a deflated balloon, a remote control, a pencil, keys, a spatula, and a toy car.***

“Okay, Ben, now go into the other room until I say,” my wife Christine giggled, giving him a pretend-whack on his butt, “Oh, this’ll be fun!”

I watched the interaction over the top of my morning newspaper. As my four-year-old son scampered out of the room, my wife shot me a gleeful look and stuffed the pencil into her pocket. 

“You can come back now!” she called, hugging her knees, “Bet you can’t guess what’s missing!”

Ben ran back into the living room with surprising haste. I could almost see the excitement seeping out of him as he scanned the items sitting on the coffee table. 

“Shall I give you a hint?” Christine smiled, running her hand through his fluffy curls, “It’s-”

“I know, I know!” Ben squealed, “The balloon!”

My wife’s eyes widened, as if she hadn’t expected Ben to answer correctly, “That’s right! You’re such a clever little boy!”

My son squirmed in delight as she fawned over him and I couldn’t help smiling. They looked so happy. They must have felt it too, because this became regular practice in our household from that day on. Every day my wife would set out a new selection of items for my son to memorize. Ben guessed correctly every time. 

“Our little boy is so smart!” Christine cooed, “He’s going places!”

I smiled and nodded, not wanting to say anything to sour her mood. I mean, seven items wasn’t exactly difficult to remember, even for a four-year-old, but both of them seemed enthralled by their new pastime. 

This continued for weeks, until one afternoon I came home from work to find my wife sulking in front of the TV. 

“Uh, hey, honey,” I said, dropping my briefcase onto the ground, “Where’s Ben?”

She scoffed, a deep crease appearing in her forehead, “He’s in his room.”

In our five years of marriage I’d only seen her this upset once, so I couldn’t help fearing the worst, “Why, what…what happened?”

“Oh,” she snorted, as though it was all some elaborate prank I wasn’t in on, “He was bad.”

“Why? What did he do?”

She nodded towards the coffee table, “He couldn’t get it right.”

I craned my neck to look at the table. My heart skipped a beat as I noticed the items on it.

***A wrench, a wine cork, a band aid, pantyhose, a shard of glass, prayer beads, and a bottle of pills.***

“*What the hell*, Christine? None of these are appropriate for a four-year-old!”

Christine shushed me, shutting her eyes, “Stop it, Roy, you’re doing my head in.”

But my blood was boiling, “Why would you put Ben on time-out because of something so *stupid?* So, he didn’t guess the item - so *what?* That’s because he has no idea what this stuff is! What happened to all *his* toys? Why couldn’t you just use them?”

Christine rocked silently in her chair, a distant look in her eyes, “It’s good for our son to learn about the real world. It’s not all puppies and kittens out there.”

I stared at her, my skin prickling, “Christine, are…are you even listening to what you’re saying? What does a shard of glass have to do with the real world, for God’s sake? Seriously, this has clearly gone too far. If you can’t handle Ben, then it’s best we put him in daycare, but I will not have you playing this game with him anymore. It’s too much.”

I half-expected Christine to agree, as I knew being a stay-at-home mom was taking a toll on her. But her response caught me off guard.

“I won’t play with him anymore,” she murmured, “If you can answer correctly.”

A chill crawled up my spine, “Wha- what do you mean, *‘if I can answer correctly’?* You want me to… to guess which item is missing…?”

Christine smiled. It wasn’t her usual jovial grin, but rather a sinister, shark-like snarl, that made my blood run cold.

“Exactly.”

I didn’t like the way she was looking at me. She didn’t look like my wife anymore. Her skin had turned a gray hue, and her face was creased with lines I’d never seen before.

“O-okay,” I stammered, “How…how do you want to do this?”

To my surprise, Christine’s face lit up, “Well, you can go away until I get the items set up. Wouldn’t want you to have an unfair advantage, *now would we?*”

I obeyed, trudging up the stairs slowly to get changed out of my work clothes. I wondered what kind of items my wife would select for me, a fully-grown adult. 

I didn’t have to wonder for long. Christine called me downstairs before I could even get my arms into the sleeves of my sweater. 

“Coming!” I called, hurriedly pulling it on and starting down the stairs, my heart pounding in my chest. 

But as soon as I entered the living room, I felt like I’d been punched in the gut. On the coffee table were the following:

***A bottle of vodka, an urn, a crucifix, a porcelain doll, a hand-held mirror, a potted plant…***

And… ***Ben.***

He was just sitting there, legs crossed, as though he were an exhibit at a museum. I stared at him, and then at my wife, who was reclining in her chair, hands on her chest.

“Go on then, have a look,” she chuckled.

I swallowed, my gaze glued to my son. 

“What…what’s Ben doing on the table, Christine?” I whispered.

She rolled her eyes, “What do you mean? Ben has kindly volunteered to be one of the options. Now remember, you have to guess correctly to win the game. Otherwise, no deal.”

“I…I…” I began, but Christine put her finger to her lips.

“Shush, no talking. You have exactly fifteen seconds to look over the items on the table, starting… now!”

So, I looked. Granted, I couldn’t pay attention to much aside from my son, who was sitting stone-faced on the coffee table, only moving once to rearrange his legs, despite Christine’s grunts of protest. 

“Okay, time’s up!” Christine barked, getting up from the chair and ushering me out of the room, “Now wait until I call you back in.”

“I know how the game works,” I hissed, but she slammed the door in my face before I could say anything else. 

Only at this point did I notice that I was trembling. The skin on my arms was prickling despite my wool sweater and my forehead felt slick to the touch. God knows, I would lose it if my son was ‘the missing item’. Even if it was only a prank. 

Not even twenty seconds had passed before the living room door swung open and a smiling Christine greeted me, waving me inside.

“Okay, Roy!” she rubbed her hands together, “Which item is missing?”

I heaved a sigh of relief when I noticed Ben still perched on the table, no different than before. *Okay, so she wasn’t completely mad…* 

I edged closer to the table to inspect the remaining items. There was the bottle of vodka, the urn, crucifix… *had that been there before?* I was sure it had… The doll also sat in the middle, its porcelain face cracked down the side. The mirror and the flowerpot were also present, although I was sure they had been on the opposite end of the table before I left. 

Everything was there. Unless I’d been too focused on my son to notice… I racked my brain for the right answer, but came up with nothing. Had she replaced an item with one that was strikingly similar? 

I inspected the flower pot, wondering if perhaps Christine had taken advantage of my limited botany knowledge and replaced it with a matching plant.

Out of the corner of my eye, I could see my wife gesturing to Ben to be quiet, a finger on her lips accompanied by a cheeky grin. Ben mimicked her, pressing both of his little palms to his mouth.

“Uh…is it…” I began, playing for time, “Is it… the plant?”

“Nope!” Christine roared with laughter, “Okay, I’ll give you one more guess. It’s a hard one! Choose wisely!”

I leaned down to study the items. Everything looked the same. Was it possible she hadn’t replaced anything? 

“It’s all the same, Christine!” I said, wringing my hands in frustration, “You didn’t change anything!”

But Christine shook her head, “No! Look closer! Third time’s the charm!”

I tried. I really did. Droplets of sweat sprung out on my forehead and dripped down my temples. My heart was thudding so loud I could barely hear my wife’s giggling behind me. She was hovering over my shoulder, like a spider waiting to pounce. 

“I don’t know…” I wailed, “I don’t see anything!”

“One last guess,” Christine chirped, “Make it count.”

But I couldn’t focus. Not with her watching my every move. I had already decided. Ben was going to go to kindergarten so she could return to work. I’d simply give her no choice in the matter and tell her that it’s for the best and-

“Time’s running out,” Christine tapped her watch, “Ten more seconds.”

“Oh, I don’t know, Christine, is it the vodka? Did you drink some of it? Did you replace it with water?”

It didn’t matter anymore. I didn’t even want to hear the answer. What we were going to do was sit down and go over the op-

“Wrong again!” Christine shrieked, as she fumbled around in her pocket and pulled out a pink, fleshy-looking object.

Before I could say anything, she tossed it onto the table and I recoiled in horror, my eyes welling up with tears, “What…what…”

But I didn’t need to ask. I knew what it was. I stared at her, and then at my son, who was still pressing his little hands to his mouth. 

[“What?” she barked, “Cat got your tongue?”](https://www.reddit.com/r/MidnightAllDay/comments/x0072w/join_us_for_a_live_streaming_writers_chat_games/)

Okay so I have never been much of a reddit guy but have recently gotten on it out of interest of these “isolated staircases” found 30 or 40 miles in the woods. You know how it goes, a few hours pass and I find myself here. Anyways - I grew up in a military family (probably why i currently serve) and have heard endless stories about combat, barracks shenanigans and things of that sort so I never paid a whole lot of attention. One night my uncle told me a story i’d have a hard time forgetting, i realized this was because you never hear of ghost stories in the military. So here it goes:

• One night around 3am an MP sits alone at one of the back gates of a small National Guard post in Mississippi. It was cold outside so he sat inside of his guard box with a small space heater and a cup of coffee. He would have to radio in every hour or so in order to let his command know that he was okay and nothing had occurred throughout the night.  As he sat alone reading a book he heard a small wail coming from a few hundred yards up the gravel road he was posted at. It was too dark to see that far so he left the inside of his guard box to get a better look, at this point he was startled because the screams sounded like something out of a horror film, deep and sorrowful. To his surprise, after staring into the darkness for a moment, a young women appears. She was covered in blood and limping down the road. 

Still distraught and screaming she makes her way closer and closer to him, at this point the soldier takes off in her direction in order to provide her any medical aid he could. Once they meet she starts screaming that she had a wreck a ways up the road and her child was in the car. She begged him to “go save my child,” realizing how cold it was he wrapped his fleece jacket around her bloody body covering it in blood. He placed her back in the guard box and took off in a sprint down the road. He arrived to find a car flipped upside down and a small child unharmed and crying in the back. Once he removed the child and laid him on the road he went to check if anyone else was in the car. 

When he arrived back at the car he couldn’t believe what he saw, the woman from before bloody and dead in the front seat still strapped in. He removed her from the car and checked her pulse, she was gone. He grabbed the child and hurried back to the guard box in order to radio up to his unit, upon his arrival he finds his fleece jacket laying on the ground outside the box without a trace of blood on it. 

Hope y’all enjoyed this, it definitely gave me some chills when i heard it. People always associate ghosts with evil and negativity but in this case it just seemed like the mom’s unfinished business was simply to save her child and had no need to roam the earth once that was finished.

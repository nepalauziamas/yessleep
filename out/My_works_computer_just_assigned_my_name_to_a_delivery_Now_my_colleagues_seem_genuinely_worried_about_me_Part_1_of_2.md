My name is Alan, I work nights for a Chinese takeaway as a driver making deliveries.

We operate within a 4 mile radius and have 3 drivers at any one time... it's a very popular place.

We are located right on the Northern edge of town, so 99% of deliveries come from East, South or West.

If you go any further than half a mile North then it's basically all countryside from there, saying that, we do get occasional orders a mile or two in that direction, but for as long as I've worked here, which is almost 2 years, I've never seen anything further North than that.

This order came in at 11:30pm, half an hour before closing time.

Johnny, the desk worker who picked up the receipt, inhaled through his teeth as he looked at the long strip of paper, then looked at me and shook his head.

He put his hands together as if he were praying and looked up to the ceiling, 'R...I...P Aldo, Gone but not forgotten', then gave a light chuckle.

He lowered his head and looked at me, 'you just got the ''Mortè'' delivery' he said solemnly, 'we've got another one in boys!' He yelled through the window to the kitchen.

Clattering dishes and rushing footsteps came accompanied by cries of 'let me see, let me see!'.

I just stood there looking confused.

'Ohhhhh shit' the head chef, Jin, exclaimed, 'haven't had one of these for a long time, nice knowing you mate!', he laughed.

'I don't... understand' I mumbled meekly.

'I'm sure someone can fill you in, I've got to get a start on this order', Jin waved the receipt in the air and hurried back to the kitchen.

'What's this all about?' I asked, looking to Johnny, and Nick, who was another one of the drivers.

'You've been here longer Johnny, you tell him', Nick said, pulling a cigarette out and walking to the front door.

Johnny shook his head, then he gazed at me, almost remorseful.

'There's a family, right on the 4 mile mark North' he began.

He looked all around as if the CIA or something had bugged the place, he came in closer and hushed his voice.

'Away out where there are no streetlights or anything. It's the Mortè family, the order always comes in from one of two names, Bella Mortè, or Chuck Mortè, every time one of our driver's has delivered to this address, they have either went mad after a few weeks and ended up being sectioned, or... they've never been seen again'.

'Is that the rich family the owns pretty much every retail building in the town? That's impossible!', I scoffed.

'Is it?? That family practically built this town, the police won't touch them, some weird shit goes on there, I'm telling you!'

I stared at Johnny looking for any signs of this  being some BS story for all of them to have a laugh at later.

'So the police are complicit in multiple people's disappearances?' I asked, 'I highly doubt it!' I added.

'There's only person who's ever came back, and stayed back...', Johnny whispered.

My eyebrows raised, 'Who!?'.

Johnny nodded to the door, 'Nick... although something must have happened because he was a bit fucked up and he started smoking after it, if you ask me, I think every time he has a cigarette, he's thinking about that delivery, which must be a lot, considering he smokes about forty a day!'

I looked to the open door, I couldn't see Nick, but large intermittent clouds of smoke drifted inside the shop.

The lights flickered.

Johnny looked at me smiling, 'woooooo!', his fingers danced as he made a sarcastic ghost impression.

'I think you've all been sniffing glue!' I laughed.

'To be honest, I don't know how serious the stories are, I mean yes, there have been guys just quit the next day and then disappeared, and I did hear one of our drivers ended up in the loony bin, but that doesn't really mean it's all true, people are allowed to leave town, and people are allowed to... y'know, go insane or whatever'.

I rolled my eyes, Johnny leaned in over the counter, 'All I'm saying is, you're best asking Nick about it, but hey! I'm sure it will all just be an elaborate scary town legend... to some extent', His eyes drifted away from me as he finished.

I heard Jin in the back shouting, 'Order's almost up!'

Johnny nodded to the door, 'Just go and speak to him'.

I reluctantly turned and stepped out of the doorway, directly into a big cloud of freshly exhaled smoke.

I couldn't see, it was like a smoke grenade.

I waved my hand around in front of my face, 'Jesus Nick, you smoking a fucking baseball bat?'.

Nick side eye glanced at me and smiled, 'sorry'.

'Johnny's talking all this shit about this Mortè family thing, he said you've been before!?' 

'Yep' he answered bleakly.

'So, what's it all about, are all these stories true?'.

'There's a lot of things that are true, but I'd say there's probably twice as much that isn't'.

He took a puff of his cigarette.

'Don't get me wrong, there have been serious reports of weird things going on there, but I personally think it's all blown a bit out of proportion'. 

Nick turned his head and spat on the ground.

'So you think it'll be fine?' I asked.

He looked at me, his cigarette casting a dim orange glow on his face, 'Should be! Just drop the bags, ring the bell, get off the porch and make sure they answer the door before you leave'.

'They'll probably ask you to come in, or they'll offer you money, like a lot of money, but I just done the same thing, dropped the bags and made sure they answered the door, it's always paid online anyway, they seemed to be desperate to hand me a tip, but I just walked away!'

'So... nothing really happened when you went then?' I asked.

'No, it was a breeze, the guy who answered the door was weird, but I was closer to my car than I was to him'.

I looked at him confused, 'so why did you start smoking then?'.

Nick shot the exact same look back at me, 'what you talking about?' He asked looking puzzled.

'Johnny said you started smoking after that delivery and you smoke forty a day!'

Nick laughed, and threw the cigarette on the ground. 

Flattening it with his boot he patted me on the back and leaned into my ear, 'I've been smoking since I was thirteen, don't listen to that ginger prick!'.

He laughed and went back inside.

I felt annoyed, I stormed in after him to confront Johnny, only to be met by Jin holding two large bags full of delicious smelling containers of food.

'Good luck buddy!' He said as I took them from him.

I walked to my car and looked back, they were all standing in the window waving at me smiling.

'Idiots!' I muttered to myself as I took off.

It's more or less a straight, country road, so the drive would only be about 15 minutes, maybe less.

I put the radio on and rolled the window down a bit.

After around 2 miles, it gets very dark, the streetlights end, the light pollution from the town is pretty minimal as it is, so in the absence of streetlights, it's quite daunting how dark it can be.

I drove over a small hill and the house came into view, there were a few windows with lights on dotted around the side I could see.

As I pulled up, I couldn't believe how big this house was, it was like a house you would build in the sims, if you used the infinite money cheat, although it wasn't modern looking, it was definitely a very old looking, almost gothic style house.

A small carved wooden sign read **Manor Mortè**  on one of the pillars that stood on either side of the driveway entrance.

As I got closer, the house loomed over me.

A dim porch light looked like is was struggling to stay on, and a few windows at the front of the house were illuminated.

I got out of the car, Looking for my phone to use the torch but I couldn't find it.

I had just started searching the floors when I heard a noise.

I looked up.

Someone was watching me from the ground floor window.

I waved over and I just grabbed the bags.

They never reacted, the silhouette just disappeared to the side.

I walked up to the porch and rang the bell.

I set the bags down in front of the door, rang the bell, then I went back down the 3 stairs and took a couple of steps back.

I saw a silhouette come to a side window and peek out from behind some netted curtain.

They disappeared again.

After about 2 long minutes, I was just about to ring the bell once more, when I heard a lock click open.

Slowly, the large wooden arched door opened, making a horrible creaking sound.

An eye peered out from the small crack.

'Hi...uhm hi! Delivery from New Sky Dragon, I've just left it there for you'.

I turned to go back to the car.

'Delivery from where' An frail sounding shaky voice came from the porch.

I turned back around, I could still only see their eye peeking through.

'New Sky Dragon! You ordered a delivery'.

'Oh, I'm sorry, excuse me Son, these old ears don't work great anymore', he pulled the door all the way open.

A tall, gaunt looking old man stood over the bags, his face looked almost like a skull, with the dim light in the porch I could see it obviously wasn't a skull, his features just looked very drawn in.

'Eh, Okay' I said and I turned again to leave.

'Oh, but wait!, sir!? Would you not like your tip?' 

I turned to say no.

Instead I was stunned to see the man smiling, waving a big stack of notes in his hand.

'Wow' I stood with my mouth wide open.

'Come on up and get it son', he said, his voice was high yet sounded gritty.

I began walking slowly up, I tried telling myself to remember what Nick said and just leave, but for some reason my legs seemed to want that money, they just kept moving.

I put a foot on the first step to the porch.

The man's grin grew wider as he held the money a little closer to himself.

I stared at the stack of notes, drawing me in.

A flash of bright light startled me, I felt like I had snapped out of a trance.

The beam crossed from right to left as another car pulled into the driveway. 

For that split second the light flashed across his face, it revealed he had stretched taught skin over his long slender skull, his eyes were dark and sunken, his skin was almost translucent.

He shied away from the light and groaned.

I took a step back.

His face was grotesque, seeing it in the light made my skin crawl with fear, he seemed like a harmless old man but there was something extremely unsettling about his presence.

I took another step back as he poked his head back out from behind the door.

I walked back towards my car and saw this kid getting out of his, looked like an almost zombified, stoned teenager.

'Hey man, got a delivery from [McDimple's!](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/vrhtk6/have_you_ever_heard_of_the_fast_food_restaurant/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) Shit man, do you live here? This is a nice house!' He said, slightly slurring his words.

'McDimple's? I didn't even know they existed anymore!'

'Yeah there's one nearby, like... that way or something', his dead eyes almost looked right through me, 'anyway here's your food man, thanks for choosing Mc...'

'Whoa! Wait, hold on' I interrupted, 'I dont live here, you need to go up there' I pointed to the porch where the old man was still standing staring at us, 'that's the owner there'.

'Ah! Sorry bud, see ya!', He staggered over to the porch and I got into my car.

I sat and watched.

This kid didn't care, he just waltzed up and handed the old man his food and turned to walk away.

Then he jumped as the old man suddenly grabbed his shoulder, I must admit, I jumped too.

The kid stopped, and turned to the old man who was waving bundles of cash in his face.

He slowly reached his hand up to take the money.

It looked like he took it, he seemed to be holding the money but I couldn't see clearly enough, I couldn't tell if the old man had let go.

My phone rang. 

I saw the glow emanate from under my seat somewhere so I rummaged around to get it.

'Hello' I answered.

It was Nick.

'Just checking in to see if you were alive or not' He laughed.

I laughed too.

'No I'm fine I....' I trailed off as I looked up.

Staring onto the porch, dumbfounded.

They were gone.

In the space of about 30 seconds they had both completely vanished, even the McDimple's kid's car had gone... I never heard any engine noise or anything.

'Alan?' Nick's voice broke the silence.

'I... I'm fine Nick.. it's just...', I kept staring, I didn't know what to say.

One by one the lights in the house began to switch off.

'There was another delivery guy here but he's... he's disappeared Nick!'

'Shut up' Nick jested, 'who orders two deliveries?' He started laughing.

'Maybe people who like to murder delivery drivers!?' 

'Alan! Get back to the shop, we need to lock up and go home!' Nick said bluntly.

'I'm serious Nick!!' 

'Okay well, if you're in your car then it's not your problem then is it? Hurry up and get back, you're driving Johnny home remember'.

...

I was still silent, just watching the house.

'Alan!' Nick sounded agitated.

'Nick, I can't just leave that kid'

Before he could speak a loud scream filled the air.

I even heard Nick react to it.

'You heard that, right?' I asked.

'Alan, I'm telling you, as your friend, start your car and get back here right now, seriously! Do not get out of your car!'

One by one the lights in the house began switching back on.

In the curtains I could see multiple shadows of people in each room.

They were dancing.

'No, something sinister is going on here and I'm not leaving that kid alone here with these weirdos.

I hung up the phone before Nick could react.

'Johnny can get a taxi the lazy prick', I said to no one as I marched over to the porch. 

As I got closer, I saw the door open, just a crack.

I stopped at the steps.

The old man's head appeared.

'Can I help you with something?' He grinned.

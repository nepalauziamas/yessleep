I’ve been interested in photography since I was a kid. When other kids were watching toy unboxing videos on youtube, I watched videos on photo composition and lighting techniques. I was a weird kid.

But it paid off. My Grandma scrimped and saved her money and, on my 16th birthday, got me a top-of-the-line camera. It was one of my most prized possessions. It’s not an exaggeration to say that I became a better photographer because of that gift.

Photos I snapped with that camera got me freelance work with the local paper. It helped me get several school scholarships. It snapped the photos that would decorate my first apartment. I loved that camera – it was a workhorse.

But, like all workhorses, there comes a time to send them out to pasture. After a few years, the camera went from my constant companion to a decoration on my bedroom bookshelf. I moved on to better and more expensive cameras, but that first one stayed close to my heart.

Last week, my Grandma died. I was crushed. I spent the days leading up to her funeral in a major funk. I didn’t want to do anything or see anyone. I pattered around the house in my pajamas, ignoring my phone, and tried not to be too sad. It didn’t work. I spent the day before her funeral slumped on the couch, looking through old photos of us together.

When it came time for her funeral, I was a mess. Although I had come to terms with her death, I wasn’t ready to see the finality of the coffin being lowered into the ground. We’d never be together again. She’d be gone, and that would be that.

The morning of the funeral, I had an idea. I wanted the best picture I had taken with her and put it in the casket. In my head, if I did that, we’d always have a connection. After going through the stack of photos, I settled on the perfect one. We both were sitting at her kitchen table, having a snack and laughing.

I remembered the day so well. It was supposed to be a staged shot of us having a conversation. It was for a class project. I spent about ten minutes setting up the camera just right, staging the table, and telling my Grandma where to sit and how to pose. It was a production. Once I got everything all set, I sat across from her and counted down from three.

When I got to one, the giggles started. What was supposed to be a series of serious conversation shots was the two of us cracking up over the absurdity of the situation. We belly-laughed for a good fifteen minutes and then went and got ice cream.

Whenever I think about that day, it never fails to bring a smile to my face.

I ran it by my mom, who supported the idea. She had also planned on leaving a small memento in the casket, so she was okay with my photo. We both cried when we talked about it. I hugged my mom so tight. I knew this was hard on her. I couldn’t help but think about how I’d be doing if our roles were reversed. If I was staring at my mother in her casket.

I pushed the feeling aside. Not today, Satan.

I felt my knees buckle when I saw my Grandma’s body, so small and frail, inside that casket. I held it together but just barely. I placed the keepsakes with her, gave her hand one last squeeze, and left.

The service was pleasant enough, all things considered. It was nice to run into people I hadn’t seen in years. We all told stories about my Grandma and celebrated her life. I like to think she would’ve enjoyed the party-like atmosphere of her wake.

While there, I ran into a woman who claimed to have known my Grandma for years. I’d never seen her before, but she said her name was Beth and that she and my Grandma went way back. I asked if they had worked together in the hospital, and she said yes. I wondered if they had been nurses together, and Beth said they had. My Grandma had told me a lot about her job, but I didn’t recall anyone named Beth.

Regardless, Beth was a blast and had a lot of good stories about my Grandma. I made the round and made sure to talk to everyone, but I kept finding myself orbiting back to Beth. She was a hoot, and I could see why she and my Grandma got on so well.

She gave me the greatest compliment and said that I reminded her of my Grandma. That we were kindred spirits. I thanked her profusely, and she demurred. “I used to think your Grandma was one in a million. But now that I’ve met you, I seemed to have misjudged the calculation.”

The rest of the time, it was conversations like that, only repeated dozens of times with names I’d forget and faces that would fade with time. My head was swimming, trying to keep up. By the time I got home, I was emotionally drained. I didn’t even change my clothes. I just fell into the bed and crashed. I was out for twelve hours straight.

That night, I dreamt I was walking through a thick fog. I could hear whispers all around me but never heard what they were saying or where they were coming from. I shuffled on cold, muddy Earth, groping the air in front of me, feeling lost. When I woke, I still felt trapped in a fog.

I walked out into my living room, and I had the sudden sensation that I was being watched. It was some fleeting feeling, either. It grew in intensity the longer I stood in my living room. I felt very vulnerable.

I walked over to the window and looked down at the street below. Everything seemed normal. The restaurant across the street was buzzing, cars honked in traffic, and people sat outside the coffee shop and chatted on their phones. It was a typical morning.

As I was about to walk away, I caught sight of someone sitting alone at an outdoor table of the cafe. They seemed to be looking up towards my apartment building. I know we had a few units come open, so I assumed they were waiting for an appointment. But still, the feeling of unease didn’t really leave me until hours later.

In fact, it didn’t leave until I left the apartment. I had promised to snap some photos for my contact at the paper and didn’t want to disappoint. They were sweet and told me I didn’t need to worry about doing it today, but I wanted to break out of my sorrow and distract myself for a few hours.

Being in my element did wonders for my emotions. For a few hours, I forgot my Grandma had passed and focused on the task at hand. It was freeing. I stayed out a little later than I had to, just to keep that feeling alive for a little bit.

When I got home, the feeling of dread hit me as soon as I got off the elevator. I tried to ignore it, but I couldn’t shake it away. As I headed towards my apartment door, I caught a whiff of something foul. It smelled like a rat had died in between the walls. It was in the hallway somewhere, but it became overpowering. I hustled inside.

Inside, the smell dissipated, but I thought I caught a whiff every now and then. It was later than I had planned to be home, so I grub hubbed some dinner from a local Indian spot and flipped on the TV. About fifteen minutes later, I heard someone outside my door. I assumed it was the food and popped up to go answer it when I noticed someone started playing with the door handle.

I had a brief panic attack but remembered I had locked the door. I walked closer, and the person on the other side of the door stopped turning the handle. I relaxed – maybe a neighbor had gone to the wrong door. I was about to check the peephole when I heard someone lightly dragging their nails across the wood.

It started lightly but grew in intensity the more it went on. I checked for a shadow under the door but didn’t see anything. That’s when the stench hit me again. Rotting meat. I stepped back from my door and eyed the knife block in my kitchen.

I shook my head in disbelief. I was connecting two things that weren’t together. I had already smelled the rotting meat when I came home earlier. If anything, whatever was dead had purified more. I made a mental note to call the landlord and get it checked out. The scratching, while odd, wasn’t necessarily anything ominous. Hell, it could’ve been a neighbor’s cat that got out and looked for a way in.

I decided to take a look through the peephole.

As I was leaning toward the hole, I heard someone knock. I jumped back so quickly that I scared myself and started laughing. Why was I so jumpy? I peered through the hole and saw Ernesto, my Grub Hub driver, standing there with my food.

My belly rumbled, and I suddenly realized I hadn’t eaten anything in hours. I opened the door and smiled wide.

“Oh, this smells so good! Thank you, Ernesto!”

Ernesto wasn’t very talkative. He held up my food bag, and I took it. When I did, I noticed dirt trailed down the hallway from the elevator. “That from you,” I asked, nodding at the soil.

He sighed. “I’m a sneakerhead. These kicks don’t ever get mud on them. I assumed it was from you,” he said.

“Why would you assume that?”

“They end at your door.”

I peered down the hallway and, sure as shit, Ernesto was right. The mud did stop at my door. I looked down the other side of the hallway and saw a familiar face quickly turning the corner.

“Beth?” I called out.

She didn’t answer. I left Ernesto standing there, literally holding the bag and made a bee-line for where I had seen her turn the corner. When I got there, I half expected to see her waiting for the elevator or heading down the stairs, but she was gone. I was flummoxed because I knew I had seen her.

When I walked back to my apartment, Ernesto was gone too. He had placed the food on the ground – thankfully, out of the mud – and skedaddled. Can’t say I blamed him. He probably thought I was a loon. I went back inside, locked my door, and returned to my show.

That night, as I went to bed, I felt that unease feeling come over me again. That feeling that someone was watching me somehow. I knew that was crazy because the only two people who had a key to my apartment were my mom and me. I keep all the windows and doors locked tight.

But still, the pulling in my gut. Something was off.

I went to put the Indian leftovers in the fridge and caught another sniff of the decaying rat. I pushed up the need to call my landlord first thing in the morning. That smell could knock the buzzards off a shit wagon. It got in your nostrils and nested. I sprayed so much Fabreze in the air that it looked like it had dewed inside my apartment.

As I walked towards my bedroom, I thought I heard scratching on my door again, but I didn’t stop to investigate. I was tired and assumed everything was fine. If it was a cat, maybe they could find the dead, rotting rat and save all of us a phone call. I shut my lights off and dozed to sleep minutes later.

In my dreams that night, I was again walking in a dense fog with no light in sight. Again, all around me, I heard voices whispering. This time, though, I could make out a few things they were saying. “it’s cold” was one of the things that came through. The other was “time for sleep.” I had no idea what either of those statements meant.

I woke up before the sun and made my way through the darkness to the kitchen. I needed coffee more than I needed anything else at the moment. As soon as I walked into the kitchen, that rancid smell hit me again. It had become more intense and seemed closer than before. I actually thought it might be something in my trash can. I decided not to chance it and take the bag to the garbage chute.

For good measure, I tossed in any old food from my fridge that might have passed the expiration date. I bagged it all and opened my front door. For some reason, I felt a need to glance all over the hallway to ensure no one was there. The feeling of dread from last night crept back into my mind.

I hustled to the garbage chute and dropped the bag. It landed in the dumpster with a satisfying thud. I turned to head back to my apartment when I froze in my place.

There was a trail of dirt heading into my apartment.

My brain was reeling. Someone was inside my place. I had left everything inside – my wallet, keys, and phone. If someone was in there and they closed the door behind them, I’d be locked out with no way to call the landlord. If I went in and someone was there…. I didn’t know what to do. I suddenly regretted never meeting my neighbors.

I kept my keys on the kitchen counter, just a few feet inside the apartment. I figured I could tiptoe in, snag my keys, and breakout before anyone noticed me. I steeled myself – this was quite possibly the dumbest thing I’d ever done.

I quietly walked to my open apartment door and glanced down at the ground. The mud trail tracked through the living room and down the hall towards my bedroom. Whoever was in here was in my room. Going through my stuff. Violating my privacy. I felt my fear subside and get replaced with anger.

I walked past my keys and grabbed a knife from my knife block. If someone was in here, they would get a slice from my Ginsu for their troubles. I quietly walked out of the kitchen and down the carpeted hallway towards my room.

With a stroke of genius borne from action movies, I used the knife’s blade to peer around the corner of my doorway. The reflection wasn’t exactly HD quality, but I didn’t see anyone hiding in there. Still, I clutched the knife’s handle and made my way into the room.

A quick sweep showed me that there wasn’t another living soul with me. The trail of mud just stopped in my room. I did a quick sweep to make sure nothing was missing. At first blush, everything seemed to be in its proper place.

It didn’t make any sense. My laptop and camera were out in the open next to my bed. My TV was still bolted to the wall. None of my drawers had been rifled through. Hell, I had fifty dollars chilling on the nightstand, too. That was also still there. Either I got robbed by the worst criminal ever, or something else was happening.

I called the cops, and they came but, not surprisingly, they did nothing. Well, one did suggest that I “do a better job at locking my door.” Honestly, I should’ve put up a Bat symbol and prayed that a real-life Batman would swoop in to help. The results would’ve been the same.

After a break-in, you feel violated at a level that’s hard to explain. Someone came into your home, your personal sanctuary, and mucked around. Who knows what else they went through. Did they go through your underwear drawer? Lay in your bed? Go through your nightstand or medicine cabinet? It’s tough to shake.

To help clear my head, I decided to run around town for a little bit. There was a used bookstore near my house that I loved to spend hours in, and thought that might be an excellent way to kill some time. They had a surprisingly good selection of photography books, and I always welcomed inspiration.

While there, I heard a familiar voice say, “Fancy meeting you here.” I looked up from my book and saw Beth standing there. She smiled and walked over.

“What...what are you doing here?”

“Just doing a little browsing. Heard good things about this place.”

“Beth, I have to ask, were you at my apartment yesterday?”

“I don’t know where you live. Is it around here?”

“I swear to God, I saw you in the hallway yesterday.”

“Well, you shouldn’t swear to God.”

“Fine, whatever, but were you there?”

“No,” she said flatly, “I would’ve stopped by if I had been. Are you feeling okay?”

“Not really,” I said, “Someone broke into my apartment this morning.”

“Oh dear,” she said, “do you need anything?”

“A stiff drink,” I joked.

“I actually work for a charity arm of a group that might be able to provide some help.”

“Not at the hospital anymore?”

“No, no. I left years ago after your Grandma stopped working there. The group I’m with now helps people in need.”

“I think that’s everyone these days,” I said with a laugh.

Beth chuckled and nodded, “You said it. So many horrible things happening daily. It’s amazing we’re still alive.”

“You have no idea how close that hits to home,” I said. “My place was broken into this morning.”

“Oh my! Are you okay?”

“I’m fine. They didn’t take anything.”

“Did you call the police?”

“I did, but I don’t have high hopes.”

“Better you reported it than not.”

“I suppose,” I said with a shrug. “What was weird was the person tracked mud into the house. I don’t even know where they would’ve walked through mud in the middle of the city.”

“That is odd,” Beth said with a frown. She reached into her bag and pulled out a business card. It was as plain as can be. It simply read “Beth White, Helper” with a phone number. That was it. “If you need anything, don’t hesitate to call me.”

“Are you a cop?” I said jokingly.

“No,” she said with a pleasant chuckle, “but I know a lot of people in this town, and they can lend a hand to a damsel in distress. I think your Grandma would want me to help.”

“Thanks,” I said, confused but grateful for someone being so lovely. “Do you want to grab a coffee or something?”

“I’d love to,” Beth said, “but I have a meeting to get to. Maybe we’ll meet again later?”

“Sure,” I said.

“You have the number. Give me a call.” She started to leave and then stopped, “Make sure you lock your door tight, okay? Wouldn’t want anything else bad to happen to you.”

“I will.”

Beth left, and I was alone again. I killed about another hour at the bookstore before grabbing that coffee. It was probably ill-advised at that time of day, but I didn’t mind. I had late nights before. I’ll have them again.

When I got off the elevator to the floor my apartment was, I saw the dirt again. I felt my stomach turn into knots. I followed the dirt path. It led right to my front door.

I felt my heart seize and was afraid I would have a heart attack. Whatever had come this morning had come back. It brought the rotten smell back with it too. It was the most intense it had ever been. It was suffocating.

I doubled over and started retching. I had a hard time catching my breath. My stomach roiled, and my eyes filled with tears from the gagging. I dropped to one knee and slowly calmed myself down. After a beat, I recovered.

I noticed a piece of paper lying in front of my door.

Every instinct in my brain told me to run away, but my body wasn’t listening. I was walking towards that piece of paper. I needed to know what it was and why it was there.

When I got there, my blood froze. It was the picture I had left in my Grandma’s casket. There were muddy fingerprints on it. That’s when I heard a voice I thought I’d never hear again.

“Why did you abandon me?”

It was my Grandma. I snapped my head in the direction of the voice. It had come from around the corner, near the garbage chute. Or at least I thought it had.

“Why did you put me in the ground?”

Now it sounded like it was coming from above me. I looked up, half expecting to see something crawl out of the ceiling but only saw the bright orange glow of the hallway light. I should’ve run into my apartment, but my legs couldn’t move.

“I’ve come back for you.”

I heard something scratching its nails along the wall. It came from the area near the elevator. Suddenly, the light above me started to flicker. In fact, all the hallway lights did, creating a strobe effect. My knees buckled. I felt myself getting weak.

Suddenly, I saw a familiar face round the corner. It was Beth. She looked at me, and I could feel her eyes burning with hate. It had been her. Of course, it had. I opened my mouth to scream, but my voice died in my throat.

Then I felt a hot breath on my neck, and my Grandma whispered, “It’s time to sleep now.”

Before I could snap around to see what was standing right behind me, Beth sprinted towards me. When she was about five feet away, she leaped toward me. As she hurled through the air, she yelled, “Get down!”

I dropped to the ground, and Beth flew right over me and slammed into the creature that had been standing behind me. They both landed with a thud down the hall. They rolled around the corner, out of my sight.

I heard my Grandma – the creature, rather – roar. There was a flash of bright blue and white lights that blinded me. I shut my eyes, balled into the fetal position, and screamed.

I blacked out.

When I woke, Beth stood over me, holding the photo I had placed in the casket. She pulled out a lighter and lit it on fire. She was covered in some kind of viscera that did not look of this world. As the flames quickly ate up the photo, she dropped it on the floor in front of me.

“You gave it a way to follow you,” she said, stamping out the flames on the floor.

“What was it?”

“It wasn’t your grandma,” is all Beth said. She turned and started walking down the hallway.

“Am I safe?” I yelled out.

Without looking over her shoulder, Beth responded, “For now. You have my card, though, if things get bad again.”

“Will they?”

She stopped and looked back at me before turning the corner, “One in a million...but like I said, you and your grandma were a lot alike.” She rounded the corner, and, just like that, she was gone.

I sat outside my apartment for a long while after. I looked down at the little pile of ash from the burned photo. I started to cry. Mainly for the shit that had just happened to me, but I also shed a tear for what might be coming. I was just like my Grandma, after all.

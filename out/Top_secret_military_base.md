In  the 90s, my buddy and I earned a living by  stealing non-ferrous metals  from abandoned military bases around Moscow and fencing it.  We had no other way to feed our families.

Don't  think bad about us - we really only fleeced the abandoned ones. We did  not touch the sealed  bases even if the loot would be better from those.  Our shtick back then was collecting information about the kind of  secret military bases that did not even have a street leading up to  them, only a narrow underground tunnel. Some of them had helicopter  landing spots, which were camouflaged from satellites. Yes, those kind  of bases really existed. And they probably exist even now. We would  drive our beat-up van as close as possible, hide it, take our tools,  backpacks and walk the rest of the way. There we would tear apart and   cut out what we could, mostly of course copper, tin, brass and other  alloys. Occasionally we found silver. Well, a few times we found some  gold and palladium. A rare and dangerous luck, that almost bit us in the  ass in the end- times back then were wild, a lot of bandits around..but  that is another story.

Anyway.  Some mushroom pickers have told us about that particular place. It had  the characteristic signs: an antenna tower,  a nifty barbed wire with  step voltage, all that stuff. We had already  received information about  those secret military bases earlier from mushroom pickers, fishermen,  other folk- and we always rewarded them.  Foresters,  hunters..they would give us information and we would always give them a  small cut from our sales. It was not much but we never forgot anyone.  And they also never forgot about us and would give us leads to new  places. Those people who would not take the risk of climbing over the  barbed wire- or those who already got burned trying to break into such a  base and understood that it's not that simple.

Anyway,  we arrived, drove the van deeper into the forest, camouflaged it with  tree branches. We also cleared up the track, for just in case. We  reached the base fairly quickly, the forest was dense but not a thicket.  The distance was about half a kilometer.  Okay so far. The weather was  good, the Indian summer that year was better than the real one. The  barbed wire was turned off of course, but we still checked with special  tongs before approaching and cutting an entrance for ourselves. We were  quiet- you never know.. And it was very smart from us, as we soon found  out. Of course the most part of such bases is underground. But we tried  not to go underground- usually, the tunnel and the service premises are  down there and all of this was either sealed or blown up before the base  was abandoned. They could also have planted mines down there, to scare  the overly curious people off. We didn't want to find out.

We  passed the hangars, the barracks- all was untouched. Even the aluminium  dishes in the canteen were there! Aluminium was of course cheaper than  copper, but those forks and spoons in commodity quantity alone would  make our raid worthwhile. But we were mostly interested in control  points and equipment facilities, transformer booths and garages. That is  why we did not stuff our backpacks but continued on.

Later,  as Vlad and me were trying to get things straight, we were amazed how  none of us noticed anything. We were experienced and careful guys- but  it was as if someone enchanted us. On one hand of course, everything  looked as it should be: the power is cut off, the doors are ajar, some  windows are broken, the paths are starting to get overgrown..On the  other hand the dishes look like new, ladles swaying slightly on the  hooks.. Of course, there were drafts there. But if there were drafts-  why were we smelling food? It smelled like jerky. Vlad was smelling it  too. But we just joked about it instead of hauling ass out of there as  fast as possible. And again, the floors were clean, the tables and  benches were clean, standing in their correct places..Even an idiot  should understand that if the base was abandoned at least a few weeks  ago, everything should be full of dust and smears. And if it was  abandoned just recently- why are the paths overgrown, so many windows  broken? It didn't add up..

And  also -there was no agitation. None at all. No posters, no murals, no  Lenin busts, not even flagpoles at the place. Of course those secret  bases were camouflaged from surveillance from space: nobody mowed the  lawns, there were always big trees on the territory, usually pines. All  the buildings were made to look like a summer camp or a forestry. Even  the antennas were camouflaged as a lightning rod and had some kind of  weather vane. But there were always some of the "Glory to CPSU" or "USSR  is our homeland". Either as a mosaic or with different coloured bricks  as a picture or at least painted on the wall. But here there was nothing  of the sort. Should it have made us suspicious? It should have. But  somehow we didn't pay attention back then.

Anyway-  we crossed the outer area and made our way to the transformer booths.  Transformer booths mean reserve generators and copper. They were never  taken from abandoned military bases, only those like us could gut them.  Nothing was touched, never used. That meant a hundredweight of copper,  at least. Back then we would have gotten fifty bucks for us both for  just the copper alone. Back then fifty bucks was the yearly wage of a  state employee. Draw your own conclusions, as they say.

Suddenly,  Vlad says he forgot his torchlight. I take out my own- and it barely  shines, the battery is dead. Apparently they sold me an expired battery  as a new one, it happened often back in the day.  And its very hard to  work inside a transformer booth without a torch, even if it is a sunny  day and you take out all the doors and blinds.

We  didn't want to go back but we had to. Most likely, this decision has  saved our life. Vlad wanted to go alone first but we had a rule- don't  split during jobs. Just a rule, a child of bitter experience. We did not  feel any danger, I swear. The sun was shining, the birds were singing,  grasshoppers were jumping around in the grass...

We returned to the canteen. Went up  to the second floor, where Vlad forgot his torchlight. It was still  lying where he left in, on the table close to the storage room. Vlad  took it, checked it- it worked fine, everything was okay- hid it in his  pocket and walked up to the window. I asked him later- why did he  suddenly decide to walk to the window? He never was able to give a  proper answer. It's not like the window was near us or that we would be  able to see anything interesting from it. There was no glass in the  window at all, barely any splinters . Anyway, Vlad put the torchlight in  his pocket, walked out to the window and looked out. Even opened his  mouth, like as if wanted to spit outside the window or say something.  And then he froze with his mouth open.. So I of course also came close  and looked outside the window.

Underneath  the window was a rubbish heap. Trash containers were standing around,  they were glittering which meant they were made from titanium, secret  military bases sometimes had those. I was glad, its hard to cut up  titanium but it was worth it, titanium was worth more than aluminium.  And there were hundreds of kilograms of that here. I was just going to  clap Vlad's shoulder and say something joyful when I noticed something  else. First thing- there were bones in those containers, a lot of them.  They were filled to the brim. Fresh bones- with dark-red scraps of meat  still stuck to them, flies buzzing around..That alone would make you  anxious, in an abandoned military base. As I kept watching I saw ribs, a  rib cage, a skull..a HUMAN skull. It was one hundred percent a human  skull. And the bones were also human. All of them fresh. I didn't even  have time to get scared of it because I got scared of something else.  Something that still haunts me and Vlad in our nightmares.

There was a man standing there without eyes and without arms. He was  emaciated, his torso was naked- or maybe he was naked all around, his  legs were obstructed by containers. His arms were bit off up to his  shoulders, the stumps covered in scars and scabs, his eye sockets were  black from dried blood. And on his shoulders sat..I dont even know who  it was. And I truly don't want to know. At first I thought it was an  ape. A little chimpanzee , for some reason dressed up in a military  tunic and riding breeches. But it was not an ape, it was someone else.  Someone who was more resembling a human. But instead of legs he also had  arms, very short and strong. And the creature did not have fur. It was  sitting on the shoulders of the naked man, clinging to his neck with  it's leg-arms. It was clinging firmly, very firmly. It sat there and  rummaged through what was piled in the containers. It took the bones  out, sucked them dry and gnawed them clean and then tossed them onto the  ground. It was eating the scraps, so to say. No, it was not a human.  Not a child, not an ugly midget and most certainly not an ape. It was  rummaging through the container, periodically squeezing the eyeless mans  neck even harder so he would lean towards the container with he scraps  even further and he obediently leaned forward. The creature kept  grunting, taking out the bones out of the container, gnawing at them,  throwing them to the ground.. 

Vlad  and me kept staring at it, as if we were hypnotized. I saw how the  creature took out a handkerchief from the tunic's pocket and wiped its  forehead. Then it folded it and put it back in. The tunic had sergeant  shoulder straps- which might seem funny. But neither back then, nor  later did me and Vlad find it funny. We were  out of our mind with fear.

It  was wearing a parade military tunic, you see? A military tunic with  sergeant shoulder straps. Under the tunic it wore a blouse. It wore  riding breeches and from the breeches its palms were sticking out, huge,  long and strong. Those palms, clinging to the blind mans neck were not  much smaller than the rest of the creatures legs. The creature was very  fat. A big round head, a stiff nape, fat rolls moving underneath the  military tunic. And a toothy mouth, reaching its ears. We did not see  its face- if it had a face at all. We were looking at it from above,  slightly to the side. I remember the nape, a tiny pink ear and the  corner of the creatures mouth almost reaching that ear. When it opened  its mouth, we saw big yellow teeth like from a horse or a donkey. There  were just 20 meters between us. Vlad and I compared later what we have  seen. We were not tripping, we saw the same thing.

Something  squeaked or croaked nearby. The creature pricked up, dropped the bone  and began either listening in or sniffing in. Vlad wanted to step back  from the window but I sat down and pulled at his jacket. He understood,  crouched down and very quietly, on all fours, we crawled away from the  window. We stood up and approached the exit just as quietly, trying not  to touch anything and not even breathe. And once we were out we  immediately ran for our cut-in entrance in the wire. We ran like we were  insane, without understanding where to, like headless chickens. We ran  up to our van, Vlad started it and kept speeding until we reached the  freeway. Only then we felt normal again, once we saw other humans, cars  and all that. On that evening we got shitfaced with vodka and tried to  discuss what we saw.

Of course it  was stupid to run away as we did- loud, careless, we could have stumbled  and strain or break our legs. Even more so as we were running through  the forest in the same breakneck speed. We even had weapons with us-  well, 10 caliber flare guns. You could buy those freely back then. Of  course it was not a real gun, but if you would shoot a human from a few  meters with it, the human would die and he would die painfully and  horribly. But that creature was not human, even as it was wearing the  military tunic. And neither me nor Vlad remembered our flare guns as we  stared at it. We did good, of course: I  very much doubt the flare guns  would be of  help in any case. I don't think a machine gun would help  either. I think if we wouldn't have noticed the creature on time and ran  away- it would have turned us into  armless blind men, like the one it  was riding around on.

What  happened afterwards? Well, almost nothing. Well, depends on how you look  at it. When Vlad and me met the two who gave us the information about  the military base later, they were very surprised. Surprised and scared.  But we had a tale spun ready for that case. Like, we didn't even get  there- we wanted to but first the van broke down, then Vlad strained his  leg, then something else happened.. and us, like all the other  marauders are superstitious people so we decided those were bad omens if  obstructions constantly keep popping up like that. So thanks for the  information but sorry, this is not for us. Go there yourselves or try  getting someone else. We are passing. And they believed- or pretended to  believe. Didn't even ask for money for the information. And we  pretended that we believed that they believed us. That is how we split.

What  else were we supposed to do? There was no Internet in our country back  then so we couldn't write warnings on social media or websites. File a  report with the police? That is just ridiculous. How exactly would you  want to punish those shady mushroom pickers? And for what exactly and  again, how? We could of course have spun some lies but that would be an  undertaking with an unknown finale. So we did not do anything of the  kind either.

A few years later I  asked a knowing old woman about it. She immediately asked if we took  anything from that military base. We didn't, nothing at all, we simply  did not have time for it as I told her. She shook her head and said that  if we would have taken anything they would have tracked us down and  dragged us away. Who would have tracked us down and dragged away she  didn't explain. But I think I know.

Those  were literal demons. And that military base was Hell's access to our  world. A branch of Hell or the reception. Maybe there really was an  abandoned secret military base there and the demons just took over. Or  maybe they were camouflaging like this from the beginning. And when Vlad  and me came along, the major demons were away for a bit and there was  just one little demon left, the lowest of the low who was eating their  scraps. And that is the reason we got away. And the mushroom pickers? I  don't know. Maybe they sold their souls or received some interest from  everyone they sent there. I don't know.

You  think its stupid? What else could it have been? I will never forget  that creature, sitting on the armless blind man. Vlad said, we at least  could have shot the blind man- as horrendous as it is to die from a  flare burning inside you his life is worse. I don't know, I don't  know..you can't change what has been done. Honestly, what else could it  have been? Toothy, thick, the size of a two-year old child, with huge  palms instead of feet, in a sergeant tunic, riding a blind naked man  whose arms have been eaten off? Gnawing on human bones that were stuffed  into containers like those of cows or sheep? Seriously, WHAT ? WHAT  COULD IT HAVE BEEN?!

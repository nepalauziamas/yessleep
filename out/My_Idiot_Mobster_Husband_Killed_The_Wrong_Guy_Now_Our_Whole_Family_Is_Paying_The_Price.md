When my husband saw the man in the purple suit, he spit his pastrami sandwich all over my fake Chanel purse.

“That guy’s supposed to be dead!” he coughed. My son–who was too young to understand that my husband choking to death would be the best thing that could happen to our family–patted his father’s back with a fat little hand.

Here’s the thing about gangsters: they’ve got loose lips. All that tough-guy *‘Omerta’* stuff died out with the ones who came over from Italy. I mean, that’s practically how I *met* my husband Ralph. He swaggered over to the creep beside me at the bar and whispered into his ear, *‘fuck off, I’m Connected.’* At the time, I thought it was hot. But now that my husband and his ego have both doubled in size, it’s just a question of what will get him first: a heart attack or a RICO indictment.

“What guy?” I asked, as if it could be anyone other than the purple-suited Haitian man with face tattoos and golden jewelry staring at us from across the Food Court. His teeth glittered when he smiled at us. “He’s coming over here…”

Ralph cracked his knuckles and neck, like he always did when he was nervous. Before I could slip away to the bathroom, the purple-suited man had boxed us into the table.

“Andre.” My husband hissed, “*I thought I killed you.*”

“Didn’t you?” Andre’s *voice* sure sounded dead. Pure monotone. Come to think of it, his face looked pretty cadaverous as well, although that might have been the case *before* my husband stabbed him five times in the chest with an icepick. *Ice* is also what I thought of when Andre grabbed my wrist with a frigid hand and brought it to his jugular. There was no pulse. Nothing. “Why don’t you ask your wife what she thinks?”

“I think he’s dead, babe.” I whispered, hoping that would make Andre let me go. His gold ring was even colder than his skin and it cut into my fingers. The man I *thought* I married would have pistol-whipped Andre right there in the middle of the Food Court for touching his wife, cops or no cops–but Ralph just kept sweating and eyeballing mall security.

“Hey man,” Ralph shrugged. “Leave the family out of this. This is between you and me. Men’s business. No need to make it…*personal.*” My husband, who has less emotional intelligence than a rectal thermometer, seemed not to realize that he’d already *made* it pretty personal when he’d killed the guy.

“Daddy…” Ralphie Junior looked ready to wet his pants when Andre’s pale eyes drifted over him. *Like father, like son.* At least the security people were on their way over. Married to a mafioso and I was about to be saved by a mall cop–story of my life. At least he was kinda cute.

Andre leaned forward so that his unbuttoned shirt fell open, treating us all to a front-row view of the five putrid black holes in his chest. “I don’t need to sleep, Ralph. I don’t need to eat or drink or even shit–do you believe that? All I have to do,” Andre grinned, “is make your life a living hell. Until I decide to take it away.”

With that, Andre let me go. He put his hands above his head for mall security as he passed, *‘don’t shoot’* style, and laughed a hollow laugh. *The laugh of the dead*. Then he was gone.

“This can’t be happening,” Ralph started repeating as soon as we got into the SUV. “Andre was a nobody. A pimp. An addict. A small-time dealer who tried to cut in on the wrong hustle. They poured a concrete slab on top of where we buried him, for Chrissake! The very next day!”

If the cops had the car bugged, I could forget about our upcoming trip to Cancun.

On the drive home, Ralph’s face went from irritated purple to terrified pale as he called *‘the guys.’* One by one, they each failed to pick up. They’d probably already gotten their little visit from Andre the Walking Corpse and decided to skip town. So much for *‘Blood Brotherhood.’*

“Why save you for last?” I asked.

“...’Cuz it was my idea.” Ralph admitted. “He was selling on *my turf!* If we didn’t set an example–” I turned the radio up until I couldn’t hear my husband’s excuses, and kept it that way until we parked in the driveway. I wasn’t trying to become an *‘accessory to murder.’*

If Andre’s goal was to suck all the joy out of our lives, it worked. We spent every waking moment waiting for him to show up–Ralph too, although he’d never admit it. He sat in front of the TV with a pistol in one hand and a cold brew in the other, and jumped at every little sound. *I* was the one who had to clean the plates from his stress eating–and that was how I came face-to-face with Andre for the second time.

I don’t know how long his face was pressed against the glass, staring at me. But when I looked up those sunken eyes were inches away from mine. I screamed; I think I actually threw the dishrag at the window. But Andre didn’t budge. Of course, by the time I got Ralph up and moving, he’d disappeared once again.

Ralph didn’t believe that I’d actually seen him. ‘*A woman’s overactive imagination,’* he called it. He said the same thing about the creaking noises we heard on the roof that night. I called them footsteps; he called them *‘the house settling.’* He found the smoke and flames coming from the burning ceiling a few hours later a little harder to explain away, however.

“So how about it, babe?” I snarled at him as I pulled on my pink fluffy bathrobe and dragged Ralphie Junior out of our burning home. “Did my *‘overactive imagination’* set the house on fire, too?”

The fireman who called our hotel room later said that someone had poured gasoline all over our roof.

I didn’t have to ask who the second call was from. The one that came around 3 A.M. the same night.

“I’m gonna take everything from you.” Andre’s rasping voice boomed from the phone speaker until it seemed to fill the room. “Piece by piece. Same as you did to me.”

Ralph had to go meet with the insurance people alone. There’d been some nasty insinuations about fraud, and yet our lawyer was suddenly nowhere to be found. In the meantime, I took Ralphie Junior to the dingy 90’s style-arcade and the hotel pool. It’s funny: all his expensive toys were burned to a crisp, yet there he was–having the time of his life.

I actually started to think this might all work out in the end. After all I’d been through, I was still kicking–with diamonds in my earrings and a hotel-bar mojito in my hand, no less. Ralph was back from the meeting, too, laying in the deckchair beside me like a sunburned, snoring whale. And Ralphie Junior…

*Where was Ralphie Junior?* The last I’d seen of him, he was doing a cannonball into the deep end…

The mojito hit me hard when I stood up, and harder still when I saw the unbreathing man holding my son against the bottom of the pool. Andre looked up at me and grinned…

Then he let Ralphie Junior go. For once I was grateful for my son’s extra ballast: he came up right away, sputtering and screaming. Andre strolled out from the depths of the pool.

He walked over to Ralph, and in a move that was surprisingly deft for a corpse, he pulled my husband’s swimtrunks down and knotted them around his ankles.

“Arrrgh!” Ralph snorted awake. “*Aaah!*” He saw Andre, tried to stand, and face-planted. Andre walked out of the hotel with my husband in hot pursuit. The desk clerk didn’t even look up from his phone: it was the kind of place where a dripping guy in a purple suit being chased through the lobby by an obese naked Italian man wasn’t such an unusual occurrence.

I stayed with Ralphie Junior, trying to get the water out of his lungs–which probably hadn’t gotten a workout like this since the last time he’d chased the ice-cream truck. I got to my feet quick, though, when I heard a familiar engine rumble to life.

*The dead guy was stealing my SUV!*

Since the car and my husband were both lost causes, I went up to the room, where my worst fears were confirmed. While we’d been getting tan, Andre had cleaned us out. Like most in his *‘line of work’* my husband kept his money in hard cash and jewelry–but the keys to our safe and deposit boxes were gone too. I suddenly wondered how much was left on our only remaining credit card after all the mojitos.

There was a putrid smell coming from the bathroom. All of our clothes were in the tub, soaking in a blue-brown gunk that I recognized as the guts of a Port-a-Potty.

Andre must’ve hauled it up by the bucketful.

I had to hand it to the guy: he didn’t skimp when it came to revenge.

That was what finally broke Ralph: realizing that it was all gone: the house, the money, his \*‘friends’–\*even his clothes. He wasn’t *‘Connected’* anymore. He was a helpless nobody–just like Andre had been. Maybe that was the point. I don’t think any of us were surprised when the knock on the hotel room door came at midnight, or when Ralph shuffled over to answer it without even trying to defend himself.

I don’t know what happened to Ralph after he left with Andre that night. I don’t *wanna* know.

All I know is that I never saw my husband again.

But hey–I can’t complain. At least Andre didn’t fuck around with the life insurance policy.

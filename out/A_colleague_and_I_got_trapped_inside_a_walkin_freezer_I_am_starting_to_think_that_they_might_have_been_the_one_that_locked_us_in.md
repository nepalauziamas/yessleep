**Slam**

I spun around sharply and saw that the heavy freezer door was firmly shut. My colleague, Logan, was holding the door handle, with no discernible expression on his face. 

"That better not be locked", I said to him sternly. 

"Of course it's not locked. It's never locked", he replied in a tone that seemed to imply I was being stupid for even thinking that it was. 

"Oh yeah? Open it then", I shot back at him.

Logan tugged on the freezer door handle, and the door didn't budge. It's movement was clearly prevented by the fact that it was definitely locked. 

"Fuck", he said, almost surprised he was wrong.

"Yeah, fuck is right! I think you are now a shoe-in for that promotion. I heard they are looking for managers who lock themselves in the freezer", I angrily replied to him. 

"Don't worry, that job is still mine", he retorted.

Logan and I were currently rivals, fighting over the management position in the supermarket. I should've been convinced that I now had the job in the bag, especially after this blunder. Logan, though, was quite tenacious, and would probably still try anything to get that job. 

"And, by the way", he continued, "There is enough air in a standard walk-in freezer to last 24 hours, so we should be fine".

"I think the cold might be a slightly more pressing matter", I replied, almost condescendingly. 

That was the other thing about Logan. He knew lots of random trivia facts, and he was more than happy to provide you with one, even if the timing wasn't always appropriate. 

"Well what do we do now?", I asked, as the realisation of the severity of our predicament set in. 

I glanced up at the wall as I spoke, and read the electronic temperature gauge that was attached to it. It read '-9 degrees'.

 "There is an emergency button in here somewhere. It sets off an alarm inside the store", Logan said excitedly, as he remembered that this button existed. 

"Oh great! We are saved. It will let everyone know we are in here", I said with fake enthusiasm, "Oh wait… we are working the graveyard shift and are the only employee's here". 

"Well someone will come in eventually. I think it's only a few hours before shift change. I think we will be okay until then", he responded with, what I thought to be, a false sense of hope. 

Logan reached up and pressed the button, and as he did, I heard a faint alarm bell ringing from the shopfloor. The sound of ringing that would determine whether or not we would be freed from our icy prison. 

There really wasn't much else we could do though. We both left our phones in the office when we started our shift, and so we were trapped here until someone heard the alarm.

Luckily, we were both wearing thick woolen coats and gloves. They would help preserve our heat, and could mean survival in the cold conditions for just a while longer. 

I watched as the breath I exhaled turned to a fine mist in front of me, and I could see the fine layer of ice that covered everything inside the freezer. The only thing I didn't experience was the cold itself. In fact, I felt slightly warm. Somehow, in this below zero freezer, I was a little bit hot. 

"Hey, wanna hear a fun fact"?, Logan said from the other end of the freezer.

"Sure", I said, partly because I knew he was going to tell me anyway, and partly because I needed a distraction. 

"Well, did you know that Ostriches have three stomachs?'' he asked.

"No, I didn't know that. Thanks for enlightening me".

"If you liked that fact, you will love this", he said, and then continued to speak before I could object, "There is a parasite that inhabits the Stickleback fish, and once infected, the parasite affects the fishes the behaviour so that they are more careless and are easier prey for birds. The bird then eats the fish, and the parasite infects the bird".

I listened to him speak, confused as to why he was telling me these random facts. I was beginning to become distracted though, as I was really beginning to feel warm.

 "Oh, and have you heard that certain drugs, like LSD, raise your body temperature. There you go, another fun fact for you. Bet you didn't kn- hey what are you doing?"

Logan changed what he was saying because he saw me stand up and take off the large woolen coat that was protecting me from the cold. I suddenly felt really warm and needed to shed the extra layers. I felt an instant rush of relief when the coat had been relieved, as I felt my temperature drop to a more appropriate level.

"What are you doing? You really are going to freeze if you take that off?", Logan said, sounding concerned for my well being. 

"Don't ask me how, but I felt hot", I replied. 

"Hot? You're crazy". 

I was about to respond by asking him to feel my arm to see if it felt warm or it was just in my head, when I looked down at my arm and saw a small hole. I studied it closer. There was a rather tiny hole in the crease of my elbow, in the same spot they usually draw blood from. In fact, I think this is what it was. It looked as if the hole was caused by a needle. 

"Do you see this?", I called out to Logan, as I outstretched my arm, "That small hole right there"?

Logan took a step towards me, inspected my arm for a minute and then nodded.

"Yeah, looks like you've had a blood test", he said, "And speaking of blood, did you know that a pint of blood contains 2.4 trillion red blood cells".

"I haven't had a blood test", I told him, ignoring his useless fact. 

And that is when it dawned on me. I had no recollection of entering the freezer. All I remembered was that I was throwing away some rotten meat that had small maggots in it, and the next, Logan was closing the freezer door. The rest of my memory was a total blank. I suddenly knew what happened. 

"You drugged me!", I said to Logan accusingly. 

"I'm sorry? What?"

"Yeah. Yeah, it makes sense. You drugged me, then locked us in the freezer. Then, when we get rescued, you can blame it on me and insist they drug test me. Or…no… surely not…"

A dark thought crept into my head. I knew Logan would do pretty much anything for this promotion, but surely not this. 

"You were going to leave me to die in here. You will be rescued, and you will claim you tried to save me, but you couldn't. Then, your competition is out of the way, and the promotion is yours". 

Logan stared at me in confusion and disbelief. Maybe disbelief at what I was saying, or disbelief that I had worked out his insidious plan. 

"You're paranoid", he replied after a moment, "I didn't drug you. What the fuck are you on about. Someone will hear the alarm soon and we will be saved. We will both be out of here soon".

I looked at him, trying to figure out if he was telling the truth, or if I was correct.

"Then why did you tell me that fact about the drug that raises your body temperature? Why did that fact pop into your head?", I yelled at him, realising that more and more pieces were starting to connect.

"Because that's what I do. I tell random facts. I don't know why I told you that one. It's just something I thought of", he spat back at me.

I watched him intently, and I could see his anger level rising. I noticed this because I saw a few veins in his neck begin to stick out. My eye was drawn to the rather large vein that was now poking out his neck. The vein then wriggled.

I jumped backwards. 

"What the fuck was that"?, I yelled, "Your vein just moved". 

As I spoke, I saw the vein wriggle once more. It looked like it was a small, blue snake that slithered slightly along Logan's neck. I took in a few deep breaths and tried to rationalise the situation, and I quickly found an explanation.

"I'm hallucinating aren't I? Whatever you gave me is making me see some weird shit".

Logan just looked at me like I was losing my mind, which was entirely possible. 

Then, I felt a strange wiggling sensation down my own arm. I moved my focus towards it and saw two of my own veins wriggle just below the surface of my skin. I felt them move too. Whatever drug Logan injected me with, it was really beginning to take effect. 

I watched both my arms as the veins inside them moved around, like small worms in the dirt. I felt each movement, but I had to keep reminding myself it was just the effect of some hallucinogen. 

Then, breaking my concentration from my arms, I felt my nose start to run. This made my brain realise that I was still stuck inside the freezer and that the cold would be a danger to me. 

I sniffed and felt whatever was running out my nose return to where it came from. The fear inside me grew. I was stuck in freezing temperatures, drugged, and now hallucinating as well. I didn't have much hope that I would survive the night. And Logan was to blame. 

I looked up at him, and saw the worried expression on his face, but lunged towards him anyway. I refused to die without a fight. I grabbed Logan by the arm and was just about to push him forwards, when I felt his vein slither below the palm of my hand. 

I recoiled and let go of him. His face now showed signs of pure terror. I looked at his face for a moment, when I saw the thing slide out of one of his nostrils. The long, pure white worm was about a foot long and it slid out the end of his nose and dropped towards the ground. 

I screamed at the same time that Logan did. He opened his mouth and let out a loud, ear piercing scream, and as he did, another worm slithered out of his mouth. 

My nose started to run again, but I didn't have time to sniff it back up. The long, ghostly pale worm crawled out of my nostril and fell to the ground. Whatever these things were, they were inside me too. 

I was too scared to even scream, as I looked back down at my arms and saw all of the wriggling. I now knew exactly what they were, and they weren't my veins. 

I felt more and more of the worms begin to slide out of my nose, and a couple out of my mouth. I looked to Logan and saw that the same thing was happening to him too. 

**Click**

The freezer door slid open, and I saw a puzzled looking customer staring at us. His face changed from one of confusion to pure fear as he saw what was happeing to the both of us. 

The last thing I saw before I blacked out was a large group of the parasitic worms all crawled and slithering towards the terryfied man. 

This was just over a week ago now, and I am still recovering from what happened. There are small holes covering almost my entire body, created by the things escaping. 

I haven't seen Logan since the incident, but I'm told by the doctors that he survived and ended up with similar injuries to me. 

My mind keeps wandering back to the fact that Logan told me. 

The parasite first infects. It then influences the behaviour of its host, in this case, influencing its host to move somewhere that was ideal for it to grow and multiply. The parasite then moves on to infect others.

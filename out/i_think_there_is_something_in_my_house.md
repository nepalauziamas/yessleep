So. Before I begin with this story I wanna add that I am a horror fan since elementary school and I love listening to true crime podcasts. I don't know if I just imagine all these things because of the stories I've heard and all the research I've done but I am scared and want to tell someone- even if it's a stranger. I don't really know what to do. I am just 13. Yes. I know I'm young but still.

I never got scared of things very easily. Just this casual fear of lakes and in general open waters/seas because you can never know what's hiding in there. I wasn't very afraid of the dark, I never slept facing the wall, I left the closets and doors open... you know where this is going. I just wasn't scared of things like ghosts or anything scary- I still believed it tho.

Now. I lived with my mom, dad and sister in the house I live in right now since I was around 7 or 8 years old. My little sister has a room right next to my mom and dad. My room is right next to the entrance. The hallway infront of my room has a automatic light which is broken for ages. At first everything was normal. But I (pf course) started getting more aware of paranormal things and crimes and at a very early age I already started to feel some strange energies inside my house. 
I once asked my mom if anyone has ever died in this house-or in the flats next to us. ,,No. These buildings are pretty new. If anyone would've died in here I wouldn't have moved here in the first place" she responded. I really wanted to ask my dad if he knew anything but I never had a strong connection with him and 90% of the times we talk we get into some kind of discussion so I never asked him about it.

One night I was lying in my bed at around 00:00 (which was very late for my 10 y/o self) and decided that I needed to go to sleep before my mom wakes up and comes to check on me to see if I was asleep. I put my phone under my pillow, started the dvd player and closed my eyes when I hearf the door open. I still left my eyes closed because I suspected that it was my mom. I heard how someone was "crawling" up the stairs to my bed and then sat down on the edge of the mattress. A bit on my feet too. It wasn't heavy. And also not big. But could clearly feel it. It sat there for some minutes, just staring at me. I could feel its eyes on me before the weight on my legs "disappeard". I didn't hear it crawl down or in general move. It was just gone. I was confused, still didn't open my eyes tho. I was in a panic. I used to sleep with one of my arms hanging downs the edge- also that night. Suddenly I felt something touch my hand. This proves that it COULDN'T be my cat. It touched my hand- even grabbed it. I was so paniced- i jumped up and ripped my hand away from whatever was touching it. I looked around in my room but nothing. 

Something else that happened was when my friend was staying over. She's a half year younger than me and we decided to make a "tent" under my bed. With blankets and a spare mattress and everything. We covered everything so noone could see inside and noone could see outside. We were just talking and eating our snacks when we suddenly heard a phone ring. It didn't sound like my phone and also not like hears. And the sound came from outside of our tent. I had my phone with me in the tent and my friend put it on the desk to charge. It was a IPhone ringtone. She now has a iphone but back then she had a huawei i think. We were freaked out. She was so scared and I slowly went out of the tent to look around but noone was in my room. I quickly grabbed her phone and brought it back to her. We were kinda scared- especially her. We were just talking but I accidently left a hole in the blanket tent and my friend almost screamed because she told me that so saw something. This moment now doesn't exist in our friendship anymore

My room is now decorated differently. I have a normal bed now and it's next to the window. Under the bed is a space to put stuff under it. While night I hear things. I know it sounds dumb. But idk. It can be a breathing sound, the sound of something moving, the mattress underneath me kinda moving upward. My cat often sleeps under my bed in this space. I even put some blankets, pillows and stuffed animals in there for her. But I always throw her out at night because she's quite loud and I wouldn't want to be woken up by her screams all the time. I only hear these noises when it's dead quiet. Whenever I hear something at nigjz from under my bed I say something like: ,,I'm awake" or I just make a coughing sound. It mostly stops. I never look at the space under my bed at night and I even feat it during the day. I just sometimes open the little door to see if my cat is there or to get an extra blanket. 

I have stored some crystals in my room. Doesn't help. Tbh. I have thought about doing rituals in my room. But except for some things like marry marry or the countdown app-nothing else. I am legally Christian but I really don't believe in god/jesus. My parents are also legally christians but habe nothing to do withe the religion. My dad and my mom are divorced. I am pretty sure it's not connected to my room, but to me..

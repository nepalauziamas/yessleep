Two months ago I was in the army and got orders to storm a cave that was known to have taliban in it. We should have just left the cave alone. As soon as we got to the cave I knew something was wrong but my squad leader pushed straight into it. It was hard to fit into it so I wondered if any Taliban really could live inside.

The outside of the cave was so small that our bags couldnt fit. We brought only our weapons. The moment we got into the cave we couldn’t even stand up. As we entered the cave it got wider and taller. By the time we got 200 yards into it we could stand up and walk but we had to stand behind one another. Still no sign of the taliban.

When we got around 500 yards into the cave we started seeing strange markings on the walls. It looked as if someone was being pulled while desperately grasping onto the wall. Occasionally we would see these markings. Sometimes on the floor but sometimes on the wall. Either way there was blood. We should have turned back as soon as we saw it.

My best friend wasn’t aware of anything. They say that ignorance is bliss. I had known that man for years. I grew up with him and unfortunately we were placed in the same platoon, hell even the same squad. If only he had gotten sent to another one. Maybe he would be alive right now. I hate that I just stood there and watched.

My squad and I got 700 yards inside the cave. We were about to turn back since we had seen very little signs of the Taliban and the air was getting thinner. We were standing in pairs of 2 with my best friend and squad leader in the front and me in the back with PVT Doe. That's when we saw IT. I dont know what the fuck that was to this day. I wish that we had just turned back.

Our squad leader stopped abruptly. He looked horrified. I looked over and saw what looked like a human but the moment i saw its face. That was the moment i realized that we had fucked up. It was grinning with a hideous smile. Its eyes glowed with a yellow tint. We were all horrified. I had never seen my best friend so scared in all the years I've known him. After all the tours we had taken. It was the first time seeing him so shaken.

That fucking monster. That's all I can say it was. It was a monster. Before my squad leader could give out the order to fire, the monster grabbed his neck, his arm stretching to reach the squad leader, and proceeded to squeeze his neck until his windpipe was crushed. His eyes leaking blood and with his final breath he muttered “J. Jan.. Jannet”. That was his wife's name. The same wife that cheated on him while he was on this mission.

Gun fire started raining down on the monster. That only made him angrier. My best friend was the first to fire so the monster targeted him. The monster punched my friend's head clean off. The blood from his head covered the entire squad. I knew him for years and yet in that second I couldn’t even fire my weapon. My gun jammed. I couldn’t avenge my friend, let alone fire at the monster. Maybe that’s what separated my fate from the others.

My entire squad was slaughtered. That's the only way I could describe it. It was a massacre. The monster got to me after slaughtering the entire squad. I tried running. Trust me, I tried, but he grabbed my leg and pulled me in. My nails started breaking off of the stone ground. He grabbed my neck, forcing me to look him in his eyes. He grinned. It was as if he was looking straight into my soul. My past, present, and future. 

He spoke. Can you believe that? The hideous fucking monster spoke to me. He said “You.. You might be able to give me a show”. I started crying. A grown fucking man. Crying. He threw me against the wall. He threw me next to my best friend's decapitated head. I proceeded to black out. The air was thin and I had lost some blood due to being thrown.

I woke up in the hospital. I was asleep for a whole month. That thing. Why did it spare me? Why did it say to give it a show? Now I live in constant fear one day. One day I'm going to be met with the same fate as the people in that cave, the same massacre, but this time it's going to be my family. We are powerless against that thing. If it were to come out to the world it could take it over in a matter of weeks. 

Every time I see something in the dark it reminds me of that day. I can't help but want to go towards it but every time I resist. I’ve given up on life. I might go towards him the next time. Actually I think I see it right now as I'm writing this. It seems that going towards him is the only way to lift this pain. I’ll write after I confront him. Goodbye for now.

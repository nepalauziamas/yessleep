[Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/ws6uv0/were_investigating_the_disappearance_of_everyone/)

&#x200B;

We’ve managed to find out some things. The most concerning of which is that we aren’t alone here after all. The night after my last post, I saw one of those trees. Actually, I need to think of a better name for them. How about card trees?

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Sure, that works so anyway, I woke up having to take a leak something fierce.  The blinds in the bathroom window were up. I didn’t think much of it as I did my businesses. Then I glanced out the window to see one of those freaky as shit things coming out of the woods. I ducked, cursing.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I heard it come closer and I pressed my back against the wall beside the window. I didn’t even want to breathe in case it could hear. Eventually, it did go away which I was thankful for. Well, that and the fact I took a piss beforehand. Yeah, that wasn’t a fun time.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Fortunately, we may be able to do something about it. The next morning I let Carl and Nick know what happened.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“What a close call,” Carl told me. “But how come we aren’t seeing any now?”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I shrugged.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Maybe they don’t like  daylight either?”

&#x200B;

“Did it look different from the one that took Mike?” Nick asked.

&#x200B;

“Well, it was dark, but now that you mention it, I do think it had diamonds instead of hearts.”

&#x200B;

“So that pretty much confirms there’s more of them. Great.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Carl stretched and headed to the living room.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Well, we’re not going to solve this by standing around,” he said. “I’ll get the computer booted up. Pete, breakfast.”

&#x200B;

“What kind?”

&#x200B;

“Waffles.”

&#x200B;

“But we didn’t buy any.”

&#x200B;

“I got an iron in my garage,”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

He cocked a thumb to its door. Then he left and Nick followed him. I went into the garage.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*Where is it?*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

My eyes fell on the waffle iron sitting on a rack.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*Ah, there it is.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

When I picked it up,  there was a gasp from behind me. I kind of freaked out when that happened. Maybe my nerves were too wound from last night or just yesterday in general. Whatever the reason, I spun around quickly, hitting whoever it was in the face with the waffle iron.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Carl and Nick came running shortly after, coming to a sliding stop in the doorway.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“What happened?” Nick asked.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

They glanced at the man now out cold on the floor.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Holy shit, Pete,” Carl said.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

They came for a closer look. Nick squinted at him.

&#x200B;

“Wait, I think I recognize this guy,” he said.

&#x200B;

“From where?” I replied.

&#x200B;

“Remember how we had to pretend to be guards at that facility?”

&#x200B;

“Don’t remind me.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I glanced at the man and it clicked in my mind who he was.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Stevenson,” I exclaimed.

&#x200B;

“Who?” Carl asked.

&#x200B;

“That guy we almost used the vacuum cleaner weapons on.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Recognition came into Carl’s eyes.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Oh, yeah, but how did he get in here?”

&#x200B;

“Did you forget to lock your garage when we left town?”

&#x200B;

“Shit, I knew I forgot something.”

&#x200B;

“It happens, so what should we do with him?”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Carl considered this.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Well, maybe he knows something. Nick, tie him up. We’ll deal with him when he wakes up.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

He looked at me.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“In the meantime, I’m still waiting on those waffles.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I gave him a nod and went back inside.  For my first time making waffles at home, they didn’t turn out half bad even if I did use a bit too much batter. I made six with chocolate chips, butter, and syrup. Along with it, I also made scrambled eggs with cheese, salt, and pepper. Then for drinks, coffee, and orange juice.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Food’s ready,” I said, coming into the living room with Carl and Nick’s plates with their drinks set on top of them. “Where’s Stevenson?”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Carl while taking a sip of his coffee, pointed and I saw him tied to an office chair.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Ah.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I set down their plates and they thanked me. I went and got my plate and drink.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Everyone ready?” Carl asked after I sat down, plate resting on my lap.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

We replied that we were. As the footage played, I cut into my waffle and raised a piece to my mouth. So far the card trees seemed to be the only new thing. What we weren’t expecting was just how many there were. They were all over town which makes me thankful we didn’t arrive back in town at night. Without fail, they would take at least some people, and without any idea of what their weaknesses might be, all they could do was hide.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Unfortunately, it seemed that only worked for so long. Inde is probably responsible for them appearing so that means the other question is where did they take everyone in the woods? About two hours into watching the footage, Stevenson stirred.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“My head…” he groaned.

&#x200B;

We paused the footage and turned in his direction. He looked around before his eyes fell on us. He was about to speak when Carl raised his index finger.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“How long have you been here?” he asked him.

&#x200B;

“Since last year.”

&#x200B;

“Before those tree things arrived?”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Stevenson nodded.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Pete, Nick, wait here will ya?”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Carl got up and left.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Where is he going?” Stevenson asked nervously.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

We didn’t answer him. Carl returned within the minute, favorite pocket knife in hand. This one was retractable with a gleaming silver blade that he always keeps extra sharp. Understandably, Stevenson wasn’t too happy seeing it.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Sorry about that,” Carl said. “Got a lot of junk. You know? Now…”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

He turned his chair around so that when he sat in it he could fold his arms over the back. Then he did something that if I were on the receiving end of, I would find far more alarming than if he just yelled or cursed at me. He smiled. Although it appeared warm, we knew it was like having a river of lava underneath a sheet of ice.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"Your name’s Stevenson, right?”

&#x200B;

He nodded. Some sweat droplets were already forming along his forehead.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Thanks, just checking. So, Stevenson, I want you to tell us everything you know about what happened. Sure, we could go through the footage, but if we can find out through a quicker way, the better.”

&#x200B;

“What will you do to me if I tell you?” Stevenson replied with his throat dry.

&#x200B;

“Well, for starters I won’t have to use this.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Carl brandished the blade of his knife.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Wait, I’ve heard Commander David talk about you and I know for a fact you don’t have it in you to murder me.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I felt like I’d heard that name before and then decided that could be addressed later. Although, I could see the aforementioned metaphorical river of lava behind Carl’s eyes begin to bubble. Then he regained his composure and sighed.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“You know something? You’re absolutely right. I just don’t have it in me to murder someone in cold blood.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Stevenson seemed to gain some confidence which was immediately snuffed out by what Carl said next.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“But I can make you wish I did.”

&#x200B;

“How?”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Stevenson ran his tongue over his lips nervously.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

This attempt at calling bluff would prove woefully unsuccessful.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“That’s a good question,” Carl replied thoughtfully. “Let's see, I could break your fingers and toes one by one.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

The sweat formerly dripping down Stevenson’s face was now pouring.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Or I could get my knife real hot before I cut you or better yet we could just put you outside for those tree things to find you.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

At that, Stevenson seemed to be on the verge of shitting himself. It was like watching a deer caught in a bear trap with a wolf only feet away. I almost felt bad for him, emphasis on almost.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Okay,” he said, “can we make a deal?”

&#x200B;

“I don’t see why not.”

&#x200B;

“Alright, if you let me stay here and protect me, I’ll tell you everything I know.”

&#x200B;

“Sounds good so far. I have some things I want to add, though.”

&#x200B;

“What?”

&#x200B;

“If you try anything funny, I’m kicking you out and you know what that means.”

&#x200B;

“Of course and one more thing, could I please have an ice pack and some Tylenol?”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Five minutes later Stevenson was untied and holding a pack of frozen peas to his face.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Okay, so where should we be searching?" I asked.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

He was silent.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"Well?" Carl told him.

&#x200B;

"I'm thinking," he replied irritably. "It's not easy to recall things when someone damn near gives you a concussion."

&#x200B;

"My bad," I said with a shrug.

&#x200B;

"Right, now, as for where to search, I should probably tell you how I came to be stationed here."

&#x200B;

"Just curious," Carl said, "but what happened after we escaped?"

&#x200B;

"The higher-ups weren't happy about that, especially with the whole Poseidon incident."

&#x200B;

"Hey, that wasn't our fault," Nick chimed in defensively.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Stevenson looked at him.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"I'm aware of that, but you should know the bosses hold everyone accountable for a mission failure, and since you were all technically part of it,  you share in the blame.”

&#x200B;

"Actually, I've been wondering about that," I said. "Is he the only God you guys have found?"

&#x200B;

"As far as I know. Maybe there's more or maybe there isn't. That can wait later, though.  Now, listen closely. There’s a lot to explain.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

It was the month after we escaped the facility that he was called out to town.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“They were having trouble dealing with the creatures here.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

This struck us as odd.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“So we could deal with them and yet a bunch of trained agents couldn’t?” Nick said.

&#x200B;

“It was a bit more complicated than that,” Stevenson said. “Apparently, there was a massive increase in the number of monsters after you guys left.”

&#x200B;

That made me worry a little. Did us leaving have something to do with it or was it just a coincidence? If we didn’t cause it, what did?

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“To combat them, I was tasked with creating a super weapon.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Oh no,” I thought upon hearing those last two words.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“And let me guess,” Carl said. “Something went wrong?”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Stevenson frowned and put down the pack of frozen peas.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Not at first,”

&#x200B;

“What kind of weapon was it?” Nick asked.

&#x200B;

“A robot.”

&#x200B;

“A robot?” Carl said.

&#x200B;

“That’s right. I designed it to combat all the creatures known in town at the time."

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Stevenson explained that the way it worked was by having an assortment of bladed and projectile weapons stamped with different runes.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"It could also project them onto itself so it couldn't be attacked."

&#x200B;

"Wait, why didn't we do that?" Nick asked.

&#x200B;

"Do what?" I replied.

&#x200B;

"Like, wear clothes with runes on them. Would that work?"

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

That was a really good question. The journals don't suggest doing that which leads me to two conclusions. Either nobody thought to try it or they did and it failed and therefore, didn't add it.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"Beats me," I answered with a shrug after some thought. “Might be something to try later on.”

&#x200B;

“Right,” Stevenson said, “but for now let’s get back to the matter at hand, so the robot initially was pretty effective.”

&#x200B;

“Until?”

&#x200B;

“Until?”

&#x200B;

“There’s always one with these kinds of situations.”

&#x200B;

“Well…It was working until the flash.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Stevenson leaned closer.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“I’ve heard of things like it before, but that was the first time I ever saw one.”

&#x200B;

“What do you mean things like it?” Nick asked.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Stevenson sighed.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“I don’t want to go off into another tangent, so I’ll just say a flash is our term for a burst of abnormal energy. This can either be subtle in which case it can only be detected with special equipment or more obvious, such as with your town for example.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

He told us a white flash washed over the town that most people confirmed to have seen including him.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Is that when those tree things started showing up?”  I inquired.

“Not right away.  Flashes can occur without any unusual activity afterward.”

&#x200B;

“Like with those lights in the sky videos?”

&#x200B;

“The ones that are real, yes. In fact, most of the time, they never really amount to much. Then you have cases like your town and considering its state before, that was the last thing it needed. Without any clue to what the trees’ weakness might be, the robot proved ineffective against them.”

&#x200B;

“So why haven’t you left?” Nick asked.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Stevenson stared at him like the answer should be obvious.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"If I abandon my post, they’ll track me down. Besides, avoiding them is relatively easy.”

&#x200B;

"Why haven’t you tried to get help?” Carl asked.

&#x200B;

“The phone I used to communicate with HQ got busted.”

&#x200B;

“Then why haven't they sent anyone to check?"

&#x200B;

"They did, but when I explained the situation to them, they told me it would be a waste of resources to risk lives without knowing how to combat the trees, so I was ordered to stay and monitor things while they come by periodically."

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I let out a light chuckle.  Stevenson glared at me.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"Does that sound funny to you?"

&#x200B;

"What?" I replied in feigned confusion. "You mean the fact we were held prisoner by you guys and now they've basically left you for dead? Not in the slightest."

&#x200B;

"I wasn't responsible for that."

&#x200B;

"But like you said, everyone shares the blame."

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

He didn't have a good retort to that which happens a lot to people whose words get used against them.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"Regardless," he continued, "it means we're on our own for the time being."

&#x200B;

"So have you been able to find out anything useful then?" Carl inquired.

&#x200B;

"Actually, yes. I may have a way to deal with the trees. Unfortunately, I haven't been able to test it."

&#x200B;

"So you want us too?"

&#x200B;

"If you would be so inclined."

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

What he was proposing didn’t sit well with me in the slightest. It was essentially a trial and error of different rune combinations to see if one would work on the card trees. We explained to him that if runes are too close, they cancel each other out.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“I’m already aware of that,” he replied, “but, perhaps if we take some parts of them and combine them to make new runes, it will work to weaken the trees.”

&#x200B;

“Hang on, so your brilliant idea is to just randomly combine shit to see what sticks?” I objected.

&#x200B;

“Do you see what I have to work with? I'm basically shooting in the dark here. If you have any better ideas I'd be glad to hear them."

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I didn't so we brainstormed how we were going to carry out what would be the first of many experiments. Having nearly been spotted by one of the card trees earlier, I wasn't exactly thrilled about this. To summarize, one of us would be trying to shoot the trees with bullets carved with new symbols. As we eliminate them, we’d be crossing them off. We’d be doing this from the roof and meanwhile, someone would be waiting to drive by and pick us up if things went wrong.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Carl didn’t trust Stevenson so he was the one to drive by. We spent most of the week preparing for the experiment. By the time we were ready,  we went out about an hour before sunset to my Formaggio’s, my former workplace.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“It’s kind of like back then,” I told Nick.

&#x200B;

“Huh?”

&#x200B;

“You, know, that night we saw those lights?”

&#x200B;

“Oh, yeah. That was crazy, We had blast shit left and right.”

&#x200B;

“Don’t forget that worm.”

&#x200B;

“Don’t remind me.”

&#x200B;

“I forgot. Some of its blood got in your mouth when Carl blew it up. Didn’t it?”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Despite my fear of the upcoming danger we were about to face, I couldn’t keep myself from laughing.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“That wasn’t funny.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

He glared at me in annoyance. We brought some two-way radios from Carl’s place. Stevenson had the one we were using. It crackled as Carl’s voice came through the speaker.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“What’s got you laughing, Pete?” he asked. “I can hear you from here.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I asked him if he also remembered that night.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Oh yeah,” he exclaimed. “Nick, you should’ve seen the look on your face.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Now we were both laughing and Nick’s expression was that of someone who’d bitten into a lemon. This didn’t last long because soon his face broke into a smile and he joined in. When we considered what we’ve been through and what we will go through, it all seems so absurd. Here we are in our town with everyone else gone.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

We have no idea if we’ll be able to get them back and yet for some reason I’ve been experiencing an unjustified optimism. Why? I can’t really say. Maybe I’m just going crazy. Whatever the reason, our first night fighting against the card trees did not do wonders to stoke that feeling.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

In fact, it seemed hellbent on snuffing it.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Will you take this seriously?” Stevenson snapped at us. “The sun’s about to set.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I glanced at it.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“You’re right,” I told him, wiping a tear from my eye. “Carl, are you ready?”

&#x200B;

“Yep, and if something goes wrong, I’ll be there in a flash.”

&#x200B;

“Good to know. Nick, let’s get the guns ready.”

&#x200B;

“On it,” he replied.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

The best gun we could think of to test Stevenson’s idea with were revolvers. A bullet with a different rune combination in each chamber and more on standby if those didn’t work. Those last couple moments before the sun disappeared behind the trees almost seemed to go by in slow motion. It was like the calm before a storm and I knew this would be one hell of a difficult night.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I gave Nick a look to convey this thought and he returned it with a nod. He rested his hand on his gun handle and I did the same with mine. Stevenson also had a paper with him. It was a pretty simple checklist with two columns, gun A and Gun B. There were drawings of different runes under them.

&#x200B;

Nick would be using the bullets under the A section while I sued the ones under the B section.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Carl,” I said, “You’re in a safe spot, right?”

&#x200B;

“Yeah, don’t worry about me. I’m all good here. Wait, I think I see some of them. They’re coming from behind the restaurant. We turned around and confirmed this was indeed the case.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

We drew our weapons and cocked them. Nick was the first to shoot. A card tree spotted us and screeched. It sounded like wood in a chipper. It began making its way toward us. He raised his gun.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Firing, bullet A1,” he declared and then pulled the trigger.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

A boom rang out and it clearly hit.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“It didn’t work,” Nick reported to Stevenson who checked it off.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Here goes,” I said, taking aim. “Firing bullet B1”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

It didn’t so much as leave a scratch.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Nothing,” I said.

&#x200B;

“Damn,” Stevenson muttered, checking off my bullet.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

We tried again with the same results.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Maybe we should call it quits?” Nick said.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I was starting to get the same idea especially since those things were now much closer. Stevenson was disappointed, but he agreed as well.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Carl, get ready to pick us up,” I said.

&#x200B;

“On it,” he replied.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

He gasped.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Oh shit, they spotted me.”

&#x200B;

“What?” I said, tightening my grip on the radio.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Carl’s revved his engine.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Sorry, I guess there’s more coming out at once than we thought. Just hang tight. This’ll take some maneuvering.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

That was easier said than done especially with a bunch of tree monsters ready to snatch us. Carl pulled out from his hiding spot. Quickly, he was pursued by card trees trying to surround his car. However, with his driving skills, he was able to get around him. The downside is that it seemed as if it was going to take a while before he could reach us.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“At least we should be safe up here,” Stevenson said.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

The card trees’ branches shot out, gripping the sides of the roof. Then they proceeded to pull themselves up. Nick and I glared at him for jinxing us. We brought some knives with us and luckily they were able to cut the branches. What didn’t help was how many were trying to get to us.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Where the hell’s Carl?” Nick shouted, cutting through a branch, causing a card tree to fall. “My arms are getting tired.”

&#x200B;

“Work through it,” I yelled back, slicing some away in one quick motion. “He’ll be here soon.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

One unexpected advantage was that as these things fell on each other, it was hard for them to straighten themselves up. That bought us time, albeit only a little. They weren’t slowing down and we were running out of steam fast. If Carl was going to do something, we hoped it would be fast.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Sure enough, the noise of a speeding car reached us. However, it wasn’t Carl’s. Instead, it came from a police car. As it got closer, the sirens were turned on. This caught the card trees’ attention which was a huge break for us. Honestly, we were practically a second away from being grabbed by them. As usual, we cut it way too close.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

The card trees let go of the roof and gave chase to the blaring sirens. I was drenched in sweat both from exertion and my rattled nerves.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Where’s he going?” Nick asked.

&#x200B;

“I don’t know,” I replied, “but I think we should get out of here.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

By the time we were outside, the card trees were all gone, having been lured by the siren.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"He did it," Nick said.

&#x200B;

"Yeah, I hope he's okay, though," I replied.

&#x200B;

"That's good and all, but how are we supposed to get back to his house?" Stevenson asked.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Another engine sounded over the street and this time it was from Carl's own car. He pulled up, coming to a stop in front of us.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"How'd you get away from them?" I asked.

&#x200B;

"It wasn't hard. I just left the car on and got out before they reached me. Come on, let's head back before they realize they've been duped."

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

The aftermath of these kinds of situations is weird. During them, adrenaline saves you from fatigue. When it’s all over, though you feel it with interest. By the time we got back, I was ready to drop.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Well, that was a disaster,” I stated, flopping onto the couch.

&#x200B;

“At least we tried,” Nick said.

&#x200B;

“That’s right,” Stevenson agreed. “Trial and error is all part of the scientific process.”

&#x200B;

“And so is nearly getting killed apparently,” I responded with an eye roll. “This isn’t going to work.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Honestly, I didn’t mean to sound so defeatist. Thing is, with how many runes there is the number of combinations that could be made from them could take us months to go through. Not to mention, our luck will eventually run out facing those things.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“You’re not wrong,” Carl told me. “What we need is a different approach. I think I got an idea, but I need to think on it. Why don’t y’all head to bed? I’m gonna stay up a little longer.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

We told him goodnight and headed up to our rooms. Carl’s house has two guest rooms and I have to say it feels good having a room to myself again. Stevenson has been sleeping on the couch which he hasn’t complained about, seeing as how before then he was sleeping on the garage floor. Despite how tired I was from the ordeal, falling asleep still took a bit of time. I kept thinking about the faces in those trees.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Seeing them on camera and from far away was one thing. Up close was another matter entirely. It’s like they were crying, wailing even. I swear I heard one say something.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Help.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

That happened only hours ago. I was too tired to tell the others, but it made me think that maybe, we shouldn’t be trying to kill [them](https://www.reddit.com/r/StoriesFromRose/) after [all.](https://twitter.com/RoseBlack2222)

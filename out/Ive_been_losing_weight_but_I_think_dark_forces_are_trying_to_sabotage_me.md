About three months ago I finally decided to do something about my weight. It had been creeping up since college; a consequence of my love of all things fast food, an office job, and my main hobbies being gaming and movie nights. 
This wasn’t the first time I’d had such a revelation, but my last trip to the doctor for a sprained wrist found my weight north of 230 pounds and bought me a prescription for blood pressure meds. Time to get serious.

Besides that, I was single with no prospects. The dating scene with the swipey apps is tough enough right now for an average guy; put some extra flab on him and it becomes hopelessly brutal. As my mid-twenties gave way to my late-twenties I had to take a serious run at becoming something other than a sad, fat, lonely dude destined for an early grave. I had to at least try.

Now, when one lets people know he’s trying to lose weight everyone has advice. My hippy-dippy co-worker told me to go whole foods plant-based. The neighbor in the apartment next to me who I’m friendly with swears by keto. They gym bros on an online forum I stumbled upon were quick to recommend intermittent fasting. But, in the end I decided to just cut out the junk, dilute the calories with more fruits and vegetables, and commit to working out at least 3-4 days a week.

And, for about the first ten weeks things went well. Great, actually. Aside from a couple of minor stumbles I stuck with the plan. I cleared my refrigerator and pantry of anything unhealthy. I downloaded a workout app and then swallowed my pride and started a beginner program that seemed to consist of mainly out of shape middle-aged women. I white-knuckled it as I drove past Taco Bell and Chik-Fil-A and then went home to prepare myself healthy meals. 

And my efforts yielded results. I dropped six pounds the first week, and then after consistently 2-3 pounds a weeks. I graduated from the beginner program; leaving the middle-aged women in the dust and going on to a more intense plan; I was starting to do some serious working out and noticed that things were firming up. My clothes started to hang loose, too loose—I was going to need to a new wardrobe soon. An expensive but good problem to have.

But then, two weeks ago something strange happened. I was in the supermarket, and I was in a great mood as I pushed my cart through the aisles of groceries. I’d weighed myself that morning—202, almost down into the 100’s. My hippy-dippy co-worker had complimented me that earlier, telling me “You should have gone plant-based like I said, but whatever you’re doing is working. I can tell that you’ve lost weight just looking at your face. Your jawline is really coming out. Very handsome.”
 
I didn’t think she was flirting. She has a girlfriend, after all. But the compliment warmed my heart just the same.

Anyway, as I got to the checkout lane and began to unload my groceries I noticed a pint of Ben and Jerry’s nestled in between a bag of radishes and some steel-cut oats.

I hadn’t put it there. I hadn’t even been by that section.

“I’m sorry,” I told the cashier, handing her the ice cream. “I honestly don’t know why this is in my cart, but I don’t want it.”
She took the container from me and gave me an incredulous look. I frequented that store but I didn’t recognize her; a short-haired, bespectacled woman of about fifty. 

“You sure you don’t want this, hon? You’ve been good. One little treat wouldn’t hurt, you know.”

Her tone and facial expressions were pleasant enough, but something seemed a little…wrong about her. She seemed to radiate this energy that I just didn’t like. Besides, she seemed to imply that she knew that I’d been dieting and exercising. How would she know that? Did she ascertain that based on my purchases? That seemed a stretch.

“Yes, I’m sure.” I responded, my voice measured. “I’m sorry to be a pain, but I swear I don’t know how that got into my cart. Maybe another shopper accidentally put it there.”

She shrugged. “All right, suit yourself.” Then, after she’d finished ringing me up and I paid, as she handed me the receipt she said, quietly “It’s not good to be too strict with yourself. You just set yourself up for failure. A little indulgence here and there won’t get you off track.”

I just nodded, not wanting to engage with this odd, intrusive woman any more. As I gathered my purchases and left the store I could feel her gaze following me. I didn’t mean to but I turned for just a moment and confirmed that she was, indeed, watching me—her eyes fixed on me while she wore a grin that didn’t seem warm or friendly.

*What the hell was that*? A cold, piercing wind suddenly picked up as I pushed the cart toward my car, blowing leaves and plastic bags throughout the parking lot. I just wanted to get out of there. I quickly loaded the groceries into my vehicle and drove away. I decided to go somewhere else the next time I needed groceries.

A few nights later I had just finished a workout and showered when I heard a knock on my apartment door. When I answered I saw a brown paper bag sitting in the hallway. Picking it up and examining it I saw that it was an order from Uber Eats; McDonald’s, according to the receipt, and exactly my order, too—a #2 with a 10 piece nuggets on the side. Well, my old order, anyway. But I hadn’t ordered food, and hadn’t buzzed a delivery person in. 

My breath caught in my throat when I turned the bag around. There, scrawled in red marker I saw the words “One little treat wouldn’t hurt.” I scanned up and down the hallway but saw no-one.

“Hey.” I called out. “If someone ordered McDonald’s the driver accidentally left it outside my door. I’ll just leave it here. Come claim it if it’s yours.”

I shut and locked my door and made myself a healthy, post-workout snack. It took a while for my breathing and pulse to return to normal.

*One little treat wouldn’t hurt*. Those were the exact words that weird cashier had said to me when she tried to talk me into buying some ice cream. I had no idea what was happening, but that was just too much coincidence for me.

The bag of food still waited by my door the next morning. I tossed it, but not before I noticed that somehow a new message had been added in the same, red ink:

“Don’t try to be perfect.”

I tossed the bag and spent the rest of the day trying to put the whole thing out of my mind.

Then—just two nights ago—I went to get a baggie of baby carrots from my refrigerator. I’d taken to snacking on them while I watch my streaming services in lieu of popcorn and candy. But when I pulled the carrots from the crisper I saw that they were full of maggots. I’d just bought them the night before--now they rotted and crawled with putrescent larvae.

The sight made me gag. I summarily threw the bag in the garbage and then took the garbage out the dumpsters outside. I went back inside and checked the other food in my refrigerator. I didn’t find any other maggots or rot, but I ended up throwing out all of the other produce anyway; too disgusted by knowing that it had been in the proximity of the carrots to consider eating it. I then scrubbed the refrigerator with bleach.

How had maggots fount their way into the carrots? It didn’t make sense. How had a fly laid her eggs in a sealed baggie? And why vegetables? Don’t they feed on rotting flesh?

No; that confirmed it in my mind. Something was off. Something; some dark force was trying to sabotage me. Some evil energy wanted me to be a fat, unhealthy loser. I didn’t know why and I didn’t know how, but I knew it to be true.

And now, tonight, I find myself at home. It’s Friday but I have no plans. It’s storming. Violently. I look out my window and see the rain pelting the pavement and vehicles in the apartment parking lot. I haven’t gotten my workout in today. I should, but the weather seems to demotivate me—draining my energy and making me want to just curl up with a blanket. As the lightning flashes I think I spot a woman standing in the parking lot, staring at my window. She’s the cashier from the grocery store—the one who tried to talk me into buying the ice cream. She wears the same nefarious grin that she wore when I left the store that day. Another lightning strike—she’s gone.

You know what? I’m being silly. I’m letting my imagination get away from me. Even if there are dark, supernatural forces in this world what vested interest could they possibly have in my success or failure at getting in shape? What would it matter to them? I’m a nobody--just a single office worker who hasn’t even made it to middle management yet, who has no family and few friends. The cashier was just a slightly awkward woman who meant well. An Uber Eats driver had just delivered to the wrong door. The maggots in the carrots? A freak occurrence.

I think I’ll order a pizza. May as well add some wings and breadsticks. I’ve been good and I don’t have to be perfect all the time. I’ll get back on the diet Monday.

One little treat won’t hurt.

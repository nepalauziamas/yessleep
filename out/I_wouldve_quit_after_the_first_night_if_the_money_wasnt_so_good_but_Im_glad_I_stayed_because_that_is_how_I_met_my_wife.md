I was fresh out of college, had a mountain of student loan debt, was desperate to get out of my parent’s basement, and couldn’t find a job. I’d been on countless interviews, but I never made it past the first one. I couldn’t expect anything more, though, as I didn’t have much experience in the real world and less experience working.

It also didn’t help that I got the most useless bachelor’s degree. Please don’t ask what it is because I’m too embarrassed to say it. That was the state of my life: broke and jobless, and the only spot for my bed in the basement was underneath my parent’s bedroom, and they were still very much sexually active.

God, I wish I could scrub the memories of my parent’s nightly romps from my mind. I mean, more power to them, but c’mon. Did they need to be so loud? And I begged them to buy a new bed, but they said they had broken that one in. Gross!

So, there I was, mindlessly browsing one of the various online job boards, wondering if there was anything else I could do for money. I was shaped more like Deuce Bigelow than Magic Mike, so shaking my ass for some cash wasn’t in the cards. I thought about taking one of those security guard classes, but I wasn’t built for that life.

One by one, I clicked on the postings promising $600/wk to make phone calls. Or jobs that paid crap but had high educational and experience requirements. Click, Back, it was a mind-numbing process.

And then a posting stood out to me. It was for a delivery driver for  Fresh Meat, a boutique farm-to-table-to-mouth sandwich shop. I had never heard of them before that point and was skeptical of delivering food. They were paying $30/hr and offered complete medical, dental, and vision, and they had a mental health counselor on staff.

I was concerned with them having a full-time mental health counselor on staff, considering the shifts were Monday through Saturday, 10 PM to 4:06 AM, but I decided that the prospect of making money took precedence. The faster I could get out of my parent’s basement and not be subjected to their animalistic lovemaking to the deep bellows of Barry White, the better.

I applied for the job and took one of those ‘brilliant’ personality tests. I received a call back from Fresh Meat about a week later. I was interviewed over the phone and offered the job on the spot. They asked me to start the following Monday.

The rest of the week, and the weekend, flew by, and before I knew it, I was parked outside of Fresh Meat, astonished by how much of a dump it looked like.

A dim light illuminated the dirty, graffiti-covered brick. It looked like someone had intentionally chiseled around the edges of each one, and the windows weren’t in any better condition. Scratches and residue from adhesive advertisements were prominently displayed on them.

As I opened the door, its hinges screamed and begged for WD-40. The floor creaked as I stepped in, joining the chorus of the flickering fluorescent bulbs overhead and a metal ceiling fan doing its best to cool the room.

Once fully inside, I surveyed the area and was amazed at how dated it looked. The linoleum floor was stained and partially detached in certain spots. A neon sign hung above a counter that looked like it was salvaged from the set of Tropic Thunder; it read: We Cater to ALL Appetites. The sign moved whenever the fan sent a gust of wind, causing the neon lights to flicker.

There was also this scent permeating through the air that I couldn’t quite identify. It was kind of sweet but irony and briny at the same time. It was a weird smell.

The best way to describe the place is to imagine if you walked into a Subway stuck in some kind of temporal vortex, and it was aged a hundred years before your eyes.

There wasn’t anyone at the counter, so I hit the little bell and went to look at their sandwich bar. I wish I hadn’t, though, because everything looked moldy and stale. I even saw a cockroach skitter across, but this fly swopped in and scooped it up. I decided then and there that I would never order food from there.

I hit the bell again, and this tall, portly man emerged from a side door. His beard was long, scraggly, and it led to a bushy mustache, both predominantly gray with black peppered throughout. I greeted him and said I was the new delivery driver. He shook my hand, told me his name, Steve, and said my first delivery would be ready shortly.

The side door looked even older than the rest of the place and sounded like it wanted to be put out of its misery. Shortly after Steve walked through it, I heard muffled chants and saw a flash of red from underneath the door. A muffled squeal followed that. I’ve watched a lot of David Attenborough documentaries and have heard animal sounds from around the world, but that squeal was utterly foreign to me.

About five minutes later, Steve returns, holding a cut of meat so fresh it was dripping… something. He plopped it onto a roll he had cut and started to add various toppings and condiments. I was both mesmerized and disgusted at the same time. Who the fuck was going to eat that? It looked like guaranteed dysentery.

Steve put the sandwich in a bag, stapled the address, and handed it to me, along with a uniformed shirt. When I took it, he said, “don’t look through the window,” in an accent that was a cross between Hrithik Roshan and Sylvester Stallone. I asked why, but he just said to trust him. I said okay and left.

I remember thinking that was weird advice to give someone without any context. The likelihood of Steve messing with me was high, first day pranks and all, but I decided to try erring on the side of caution.

I put my new shirt on, punched the address into my GPS, and saw it was only four blocks away. If that had been me, I would’ve just walked to buy my food, but then I guess I wouldn’t have a job.

I arrived ten minutes later and parked outside of the building. There was nothing spectacular about it. The front of the building was flat, and there was peeling paint here and there, along with a few water damage stains. The windows on the ground level had bars on them, and you could see into some living rooms.

I got out of my car and rang the buzzer. About a minute later, a woman opened the door. There was swaddled baby attached to her nipple, and with each audible *suck,* she winced. I kept repeating “don’t look at the baby” to myself as I told her I had an order for Denise. She said it was her, and I handed her the food. Denise dug into her pocket, pulled out some crumpled bills, and gave them to me. I thanked her and bid her goodnight. She closed the door, and I walked back to my car to count my tip.

The food was paid for in advance, so whatever cash the customer gave me was mine to keep. As I carefully pulled the bills apart, I noticed I could see Denise through one of the windows. She sat down on her couch and unlatched the baby from her nipple. From what I could see, it was bruised and discolored, and splotches of red covered the areola. I heard some babies could be aggressive when nursing, but that was a bit extreme.

Denise sighed for several moments before unwrapping her sandwich and taking a bite. It looked like she bit into a sunny-side-up egg. This thick liquid ran down from the corner of her mouth as she chewed. It dropped on the baby’s face, and it started to stir.

She swallowed what was in her mouth and took a smaller bite. Denise chewed that up, removed it from her mouth using her hand, and placed it into the baby’s gaping mouth. It gummed the food even more before swallowing and motioning for more. I vomited in my mouth a little and left before the rest came out of my nose.

I had no fucking clue what I had just witnessed. My stomach churned at the thought of it. Another memory for Lacuna to take care of.

When I returned to the store, Steve saw my face and asked me if I had looked through the window. He laughed when I nodded and handed me the next order. In addition to the address, there were delivery instructions. I guess Steve saw my puzzled look and explained that the customer, Samuel, was very particular. “Terrible things” would happen if I deviated from the instructions.

Not that I believed him, but I asked him, “things like what?” He told me that the guy who did deliveries before me, Kenneth, got into an argument with Samuel because he hadn’t followed the instructions. He went on to say that Kenneth didn’t report for work the following night and was found in a dumpster a week later.

Part of Kenneth’s jaw was missing, and his eye sockets had been hallowed out. They were filled with some type of creamy substance. There was a toenail, or fingernail, floating in the left eye, and it was believed to have come from one of his missing fingers or toes.

I forced the bile down and asked him if he was joking. He placed a hand on my shoulder, gripped it tightly, and stared into my soul with his cold, ominous eyes. He said, “yes, I am joking,” and started to laugh so hard that he had a coughing fit. I thought, “how could someone have such a sick sense of humor.”

I asked him if there had been a Kenneth that delivered food before me. Steve said yes and that he was fired for trying to steal trade secrets and sell them to the competition. Then he told me that Samuel was a long-time customer and that I should try to follow the instructions to the best of my ability. I told him okay, walked back to my car, and input Samuel’s address into my GPS.

I was parked outside Samuel’s house within twenty minutes and on his porch three minutes later. I read the instructions a few times but struggled to understand their nature. Nonetheless, I opened the bag and removed the food container.

I knelt by the plate that was left on the porch, opened the container, and quickly pinched my nose to stop myself from inhaling any more of that foul stench. I turned my head around, took a deep breath, and began plating a weird assortment of food.

There was something that resembled an animal tongue and weird-looking fries that had been burned to a crisp.

I finished and picked up the tip envelope that had been so graciously left under the plate. I knocked on the door six times, waited six seconds, and knocked six more times. I returned to my car and parked a few spots from the house.

I knew my mother kept a pair of binoculars in her glove compartment, and I wanted to see what would happen with Samuel and his food. I wished I’d driven back to the store for the next delivery.

When Samuel stepped out onto the porch, he was wearing a dirty robe that was heavily stained in the waist/stomach area. He stood about an inch from the plate and opened it up. If I could have gone back in time, I would have thrown lye into my eyes to prevent me from seeing what flopped out of Samuel’s stomach when he lifted it. It was his fucking intestines, and they *plopped* to the ground. If that wasn’t unbelievable enough, they started moving, feeling around for something. Samuel maneuvered his body until an intestine found a fry. It secreted this liquid that dissolved the food. Pours opened up along his intestines and slowly sucked up the soggy mixture.

I put the binoculars back into the glove compartment and vomited into a plastic bag. I tried reasoning that maybe Samuel had a medical condition and that was the only way he could eat, but I had no idea what was happening. I knew I didn’t want to be a part of it anymore.

I drove back to Fresh Meat, intent on quitting on the spot, but I opened the tip envelope instead. There were five one-hundred-dollar bills so crisp that you could cut your finger on them.

I cursed myself when the sound of a creaking bed floated into my mind, so I sucked it up, got out of my car, and pushed through that squeaky door again.

Steve asked me what had taken so long, and I told him I got lost. But I think he knew I saw Samuel *eat* his meal.

Not wanting to dwell on anything, I asked him if another delivery was ready, and he said it would be shortly. He returned through the side door, and just like with the first delivery, there was chanting. However, it didn’t sound the same and was considerably louder. It also sounded like there was more than one voice.

Bright, white light flooded under the door and through its hinges. It was weird because the light was warm and had this calming effect. That calm was shattered by an ear-piercing howl/growl, followed by the sound of something popping and ripping.

I took out my phone, signed into my online banking app, and looked at my account. The balance was close to zero; that was all the inspiration I needed to keep going.

Steven was carrying a large case when he finally came back. He walked around the counter, handed it to me, and said not to open it. He didn’t need to tell me that twice.

With a lot of effort, I fit the case into the backseat. I noticed a large, white feather sticking out from a crease, but I channeled my inner Kermit, got into the front seat, and drove to a massive office building.

I gawked at it, and my simple mind couldn’t even begin to understand the architectural significance of the building and its design. Sharp lines were everywhere, but the windows were laid out in strange patterns, creating a kind of chaos. The building was a marvel to look at, but it was also highly disorienting, and I wondered if that had been the intention all along.

I double-checked the address and hefted the case to the security desk. The guard looked like he was done with his life, and when I looked at him, I imagined myself in his shoes, staring at monitors all day and directing people to which floor they needed to go. Nope, not for me.

I told the guard that I had a delivery for Rhonda, and he said to head to sub-basement six, but I had to sign one of those “we’re not responsible if you are injured or die” forms. I hesitated because why wouldn’t it. I’d never been in one of these fancy office buildings before and didn’t know what to expect. But I would’ve never guessed that I would have had to sign a document that released the owner of the building from all liability in case I suffered an unfortunate and untimely demise, just to deliver some food.

After scribbling my name on the dotted line, I headed for elevator bank six. They had one of those central elevator call boxes where you would press the floor you wanted to go to, and it will tell you which elevator to get on. It directed me to take F6, and the doors opened as soon as I arrived.

The emergency call button was the only button accessible on the elevator’s panel. The rest were locked away behind a metal plate.

The doors closed, and the elevator started to descend. As if I needed a cosmic reminder that this job was important, instrumental versions of Barry White’s songs began playing over the elevator’s speaker system. I shivered at the notes but took solace in knowing that if customers continued to tip like the two from earlier, I could save up enough for a studio apartment in no time.

It was hard to tell how long it took, but the elevator finally stopped on sub-basement six. I stepped out into a well-lit hallway with doors on either side as far as my eyes could see. The walls were painted black, and from what I could see, each door was painted various shades of red. It felt like I just walked into the Hive and halfway expected to see Alice do a floor routine down the hallway wearing a leather jacket and a skin-tight dress.

A feeling of dread came over me. My body was telling me no, but my wallet, my wallet, was telling me yes, so I powered through it and started walking down the hallway. Each door had a small window built-in, and I peeked through a few of them while trying to find room 6.

Every room that I peered into had been empty. The paint scheme matched that of the hallway. Multiple cameras had been set up, and they were all pointed at an archaic, or artistic, piece of furniture in the middle of the room.

Each room had a different piece at its center; one had a wheel made of what looked like ancient wood. It had six spokes in the center and was connected to a pole, which kept it suspended in the air. Another room had an iron chair in its center, adorned with straps and hundreds of spikes.

Once again, I tried to rationalize what I saw but couldn’t come up with anything.

I found room six and looked through the window. A tall woman was standing in the center. She was clad neck to toe in leather bondage gear and had cut-outs for her breasts and crotch. Her nipples were pierced and connected by a chain, which also led to a piercing on her clitoris. It looked like she had some body modifications on her head because two horns were sticking out.

I didn’t want to be caught gawking at her, so I knocked on the door. She looked up from the camera and gave me the “one-moment” look. She returned her gaze to the cameras, and I continued to watch her. She occasionally glanced at me and didn’t seem to mind that I was still watching.

Despite her outfit, it looked like she was a cam girl; maybe all her colleagues were also in that profession.

I watched her intently until she moved to type something on her laptop and saw what was behind her. There was a naked man suspended over a small, iron pyramid. He was squirming, desperately trying to free himself, but there was no use.

The pyramid started spinning, and he was lowered onto it. He arched back, revealing what I assumed to be his name branded on his chest, Peter Fyle.

Peter’s body convulsed as blood splattered everywhere like a Jackson Pollock art installation. Eventually, his head slumped, and I realized I had just witnessed a man being tortured and killed.

I placed the case against the door with a loud *thump* and ran for the elevator. I frantically tapped the display until it lit up, and I hit the button for the lobby. I willed it to come faster as that woman opened their door and started walking toward me. She was saying something, but the only thing I could hear was my heartbeat.

The elevator finally came, and I jumped across the threshold, slamming into the back. I wanted to get the hell out of their pronto.

I didn’t know what was happening and didn’t want to wind up on some live stream for some sicko to get off to.

I wasn’t paying attention when I got off the elevator and wound up on the wrong floor. By the time I realized it, the door had closed behind me.

Fearing for my life, I didn’t stick around and ran toward the exit sign. I tripped halfway there and landed in front of a door like the one on six. Out of morbid curiosity, I looked through the window and saw a man with his arms and legs chained to a wall. “Traitor” was branded on his forehead, and he was wearing a familiar-looking shirt.

When I opened the door to the stairwell, I bumped into the dominatrix, fell backward, and bumped my head, knocking me unconscious.

I screamed a few minutes later when I saw her hovering over me. She said, “I’m not going to hurt you,” and extended a hand to help me, introducing herself in the process, Rhonda.

I reluctantly took it; her hand was as soft and warm as her voice.

I was visibly scared, but Rhonda was patient with me and answered any questions I had, at least the ones she was allowed to.

Peter Fyle died years ago, and his soul was serving a sentence.

Kenneth was also dead.

The cameras were for grieving victims or victims’ families to get closure.

They also had a hotline for people with a torture kink to call in and get their rocks off.

She couldn’t tell me what was in the case, but my imagination was probably right.

We talked for a little while, and I just nodded at everything Rhonda said. My thoughts were being pulled in thousands of different directions, and I felt way over my head.

I told Rhonda I was ready to leave, and she walked me back to the elevator.

Before the door closed, she handed me an envelope—the reason she was calling for me—and her business card. **1-800-HOT-GIRLZ** dominated the face of the card, and Rhonda said that if I pressed five during the first menu prompt, I would be connected directly to her.

The door closed, and I rode back up to the lobby.

I said goodnight to the security guard, got back into my car, and sat there. I felt so many emotions and didn’t have a handle on them, so I took a few minutes to cry.

All I wanted to do was be independent and financially free, and I didn’t know how I was going to accomplish that goal. Could I really survive working for Fresh Meat? Would I wind up like Kenneth one day?

I drove back to the store, unsure what I would say to Steven.

When I walked through the door, he had a look of concern on his face and told me he had been filled in on what happened. Steven said the job wasn’t easy and wasn’t for everyone, and it was okay if I wanted to quit. I was given the rest of the night off, and he asked me to sleep on it. If I still wanted the job, I just needed to show up the following night.

I thanked him, drove home, showered, and got in bed.

A cacophony of moans awoke me. While I had no desire to confirm my suspicion, it sounded like my parents were having an orgy. Fuck. My. Life.

I put some headphones in and opened the envelope from Rhonda. One thousand dollars in cold, hard cash.

I made an appointment with the mental health counselor and went back to work that night.

That was a year ago, and it’s incredible how much can happen in a relatively short period. I got to know most of Fresh Meat’s customers, and while they were each horrifying in their own right, as long as you respected them and their privacy, that would respect you and keep you off their menu.

Fresh meat is in the process of opening a new location in midtown, and they want me to be the store manager. I am reluctant to accept the position because I don’t really want to know where all the meat comes from, but Rhonda is due in a few weeks, and we could use the extra money.

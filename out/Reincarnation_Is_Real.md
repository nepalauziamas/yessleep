Around eight years ago my daughter went missing. I remember the morning I lost her like it was yesterday. I woke up before my husband, only to find the front door ajar. Panic ran through my veins as I went to check my little girl’s bedroom, but Sara was gone. She was four years old.

The police searched for months. There was an amber alert for her. We put out hundreds of missing persons posters. There were thousands of tips called in, but none of them yielded anything of value. I just couldn’t believe that was happening to us. How could the world be so cruel?

I, of course, was destroyed. I couldn’t sleep, and I barely ate. It got to a point where I was hardly functioning. If it wasn’t for my husband, I don’t think I would have gotten through it. He was my rock, and while I knew on the inside he was upset, he stayed strong for me. We couldn’t both break down, and thankfully he never lost it like I did. Not in front of me, at least.

“We’ll get through this,” he would say.

“Do you think she’s still out there?” I asked.

He paused before he answered, “I’m not sure.”

I don’t know what hurt worse, the possibility that she was alive but forced to endure an awful situation, or the possibility that she was gone completely. My husband didn’t like to talk about it, he shut me down every time I brought it up. We all grieve in our own way, I suppose.

Somehow, the hardship brought us closer. While this kind of horror would tear most couples apart, it only made us stronger. It was the way he was there for me, the way he picked me up when I was down. *I made the right choice in a partner*, I thought through it all.

A few years later I found out I was pregnant again. I was nervous, feeling as though I’d failed once before. My husband reassured me of course.

“This time will be different,” he stated as though it was a fact.

I gave birth to another daughter. We named her Jennifer Sara, after her sister. As she grew, I noticed there were odd similarities between the two. They looked so much alike, they even had similar birthmarks on their cheeks. When I’d pulled out a few of Sara’s old toys, it was like Jennifer recognized them. She even gave her dolls the same names that her sister had. They also liked the same foods, loved the same shows, and would even want me to read the same bedtime story. I felt like I was blessed with a second chance.

Jennifer was closer to me than she was with her father. He didn’t mind of course, it gave him more time to focus on his work. He was present as a father, but he wasn’t really fond of ‘babysitting’ as he would call it. To be honest I think the similarities were too much for him. Maybe it was too painful. I didn’t mind though. I know it’s selfish, but I liked the fact she preferred to spend all of her time with me. Once her father had even offered to take her to the park, but she refused. She wanted me to go instead.

Yesterday something very alarming happened. I took Jennifer to the park. It had a large play structure which she enjoyed, and was surrounded by peaceful woods, which I enjoyed. I watched as she played the same way Sara did when I used to take her there.

She was headed down the slide when a buzz on my phone distracted me. I pulled it out and saw it was a text from my husband. He was wondering what we were going to do for dinner. I replied quickly, then returned my gaze to the play structure. To my horror, my child was nowhere to be seen. I swear I had only taken my eyes off of her for a second.

“Not again,” I whispered as I frantically began to search for her.

After running aimlessly through the woods while calling her name, I finally found Jennifer. She was underneath a tree, and was digging for something.

“Jennifer!” I shouted as I rushed to her.

“Mommy?” she said as she turned.

Her hands were covered in dirt, and she looked worried.

“What were you thinking?” I asked as I grabbed her by the shoulders, “Do you know how much you scared me? You could have gotten hurt, do you understand that?! Never run off like that again!”

“I-I’m sorry!” She frowned.

I hugged her and sighed in relief.

“What are you doing out here?” I questioned.

She pointed to the hole she had started to dig. I raised my eyebrow curiously, and walked over to the shallow pit.

“Don’t play in the dirt,” I said.

“I have to keep digging!” She exclaimed, “I have to show you.”

“Show me what?”

“Mommy, just keep digging, you have to see. It’s a deep hole.”

I don’t know why, but I felt like I had to listen. We stopped by the house, and grabbed our shovel.

“Do you want to stay here with daddy?” I began, “I’ll be right back.”

“No mommy, please don’t leave me. I have to be there,” she pleaded.

“Okay, but you need to stay right next to me,” I relented, “No running off, you really scared me.”

“I know. I’ll stay close this time, promise.”

The two of us headed back to the park. We walked through the woods and found the shallow hole Jen had dug. I began to shovel at it. I don’t know how long it took me before I hit something, maybe it was hours. Little Jennifer did as she was told. She stayed nearby, eating a sandwich and the snacks I had packed her.

I dusted off the hard surface I had struck, only to find something that was an off white color. I dusted away the dirt, until I could make out what I was looking at. There in front of me was a child-sized skull. Beside it I saw something shining in the light. I picked it up to reveal it was a butterfly earring, one from a set I’d bought Sara a few days before she went missing.

“Wh-what the hell?” I stammered, “What the hell is this?”

“It’s me mommy,” Jennifer started with a mouth full of peanut butter and jelly sandwich, “That’s where daddy left me after he put me to sleep.”

Its skyward trajectory was really like that of a shooting star—albeit inverted. As if with implacable cosmic momentum it had actually shot right through the Earth, piercing the opposing crusts with as much ease as a pen through folded paper. I stood there, perched on the rim of the empty swimming pool—a leaf and filth-strewn bowl into which I had planned to piss—gazing upwards, bewilderedly, as the object soared towards the stars; with which, it seemed, to bear a stellar kinship. But at the height of its arc, it curved, and then began to plummet Earthward; trailing in its wake the same silvery foam that had followed its precipitous rise.  

Amazed as I was, I failed to properly track its fall in relation to my own position on the planet; and it was only until I closely saw and even felt the tiny motes of that silver-tinged foam that I realized it was going to land within the vacant swimming pool. I immediately turned and ran, expecting at any moment to thrown off my feet by the assuredly calamitous impact of the object with the Earth.  

But aside from a soft, perfectly supportable heaving of the ground, there was no geologic violence; and turning around I saw that the object had landed squarely within the pool, without even disturbing the environing land.  

The foam now rose mistily from the crater, casting upon everything a dreamy, ever-shifting film, as of nebulous gossamer. I approached, enchanted by the emanation, unsuspecting of any malice or peril from it nor the object from which it was steadily surging. 

Peering into that once-empty pool, I beheld the fallen thing in its bareness, and immediately recoiled at the entirely unsuspected sight: for it was a woman, humanoid in shape and appearance, but titanic in size.  

I guessed that she would stand at least ten feet in height, though she had landed in the pool in the fetal position; or had assumed that position upon impact. I realized with a sort of enthralled incredulity that her silvery, thickly curled hair was the source of the mist-like emission. It flamed wildly, and the coiled locks thereof curled and uncurled at seemingly random intervals; as the tongues of a powerfully burning flame might haphazardly lick to and fro. 

Her skin was as pale as the high-flung moon, and had I not seen her break through the surface of the Earth, I would’ve thought her to have fallen from that ivory sphere—perhaps descending from its barren, craterous surface in search of terrestrial companionship.  

Seeing her amidst the grime and dead leafage sickened me, and without further consideration I clambered down into it with the intent of removing her. I even silently chastised myself for having been about to urinate in the place of her earthen rest.  

But as I neared her body, a thorough coldness came to me, a chill that bypassed my jacket and crept pervasively into my bones. I was briefly halted by the suddenness of the phenomenon, but not turned away; and fortifying myself somewhat against the cold, I resumed the chivalrous endeavor.  

But as I wrapped my arms around her body—careful to uphold her dignity—I realized that I would not be able to displace her from the pool, because of her immense weight. I am not saying that she was portly or rotund or obese in any way whatsoever; but that, due to her perfectly proportionate though inhumanly preternatural size and stature, she simply weighed more than I could manage. She was a Titaness, and I a simple human man.  

I released her body, gently and without noise, but something awoke her, and her eyes flipped open at once. I leapt back, for in that gaze—immediately aware and alert—was a frigidness, an inhospitality beyond human capability. *An arctic, anti-tropical malevolence.*  

Without hesitation, she rose, coming to stand several feet above me upon marmoreal, strongly sculpted legs. Her hair (the curls thereof) flared aloft as if stoked by some cranial furnace; and her eyes, bluer and bolder than a polar sea, glared at me icily; as if I had somehow offended her in my attempts to render assistance.  

With the cold callousness of a boreal witch or a glacier-dwelling demoness, she spoke; and while I have no way to confirm this, I am positive that those words were not in any tongue of Man, but in the frost-formed phonetics of some *Northern Kind*, interpreted into English by her winter-wrought sorcery. 

“You, who would lay unfrosted hands upon me. On what land do I now stand, and in what era? I augur **His** coming, and demand to know the name of the region to which He would first emerge.”   

As if a sickle of ice had chiseled the words onto my eardrums, I cringed at their icy crispness, responding only when the accompanying sensation of frigidness had ebbed away a little.  

“This is Missouri—you've landed in the city of Wentzville, Missouri. In the year 2022. Who are you talking about? Where are you from?”  My voice faltered at the last question, and a horror joined the cold to doubly assail my nerves. 

She repeated the name of the city and state, trying them out on her sky-blue tongue. She seemed to have paid no attention to the time period, or simply did not care. Then, without any warning or announcement of any kind, she inhaled and released a deep breath; and a chillness, unearthly and insupportable, fell upon the atmosphere at once.  

I collapsed to my knees, suddenly struggling to breathe. With a flash of dread-instilling panic I realized that the gelld air was irrespirable, as inundated as it was by the supernatural chill. I swooned; my vision became occluded, and from all around me there seemed to whisper faint phantoms, portending the coming of some dismal and wintry end.  

The mist all about the area thickened and took on an almost celestial aspect, the motes thereof shining brightly, like atoms set aflame. Vaguely, I saw the figure of that Titaness float from the pool, rising of her own ultra-mundane volition. She landed beside me, her naked form still little more than an outline in the deepening murk of the ice-mist.  

“Yes, I think he will enjoy unleashing his Tartarean fury upon this land. The nethermost abysm, the Deep Cold, will mount the subterranean peaks and pour forth from the cracked land. Molten ice will wash over your kingdoms, and all will fall to the unstoppable frost.”  

An unhinged cachinnation followed this doom-promising pronouncement, and the last thing I saw before a cold and nightmare-haunted slumber took me was the supernal giant’s hair glowing to a white, star-like brilliance upon her scalp. In the sky beyond, the moon began its withdrawal into the clouds with the coming of the morning... 

I awoke on the ground, lying in a pool of shiver-inducing water; my clothes fully saturated. The sun shone clearly and fully above, and I allowed myself to bask in its warmth for a few moments, while my mind struggled to reboot itself. Remembering what had happened, I rose to a sitting position, expecting to see the structures and forms of the abandoned water park whitely armored and frost-blasted; but there were only the usual faded metals and wood, untouched by even the smallest speckling of white.  

Turning my gaze landward, I saw a puddle—a rather large one—a few feet ahead. Within this was a mess of stringy material, dull-grey and bearing sad remnants of what might’ve been luscious curls. Rising to my feet, I approached the puddle, and felt a lingering but measurably diminishing coldness radiating from it.  

The puddle lay directly beneath the scope of the sun, unshaded by any of the derelict structures, which loomed dismally over other sections of the forsaken park. Putting two and two together, I side-stepped the puddle and began my journey home.  

I guess if you’d only existed within some lightless and frozen pocket of space in the bowels of the Earth, the concept of the sun—and its unyielding heat—wouldn’t have occurred to you during the planning of your hibernal conquest.

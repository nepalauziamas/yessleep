I don't how to start this, I'm really despaired.

It all started around 5 weeks ago when I moved to my new appartment, as a freshman in college it was my first time living alone and due to the financial support my parents could offer, I lived alone.

I had just gotten out of the shower and was applying moisturizer to my face when in my peripheral vision I caught a blink from the doorknob of the bathroom door.

At first I didn't thought much of it as I didn't have my lenses on so I thought my vision was just playing games on me but I still made sure that what I had seen was real... nothing, not a single movement.

It happened at least 6 more times that week, it manifested in different forms of movement like blinking, breathing and snoring.

Until once, in the middle of my morning shave, I heard a stomach growl and in my peripheral vision I had caught the doorknob opening a mouth of some sorts.

I got so scared that I jumped and accidentally cut my chin and when I tried to go for some ice cubes after I had stopped the bleeding with toilet paper and a bunch of water... I couldn't open the door, the doorknob acted like locked and despite not having the lock on, It wasn't giving in.

After 1 minute of trying probably, it finally turned and I could open the door but the experience left me really freaked out so I started going to the bathroom at all times with the door open, even when showering.

I thought I just needed to keep my bathroom door open at all times... but then it started happening with the bedroom door and with my office door.

It was getting worse and worse, the feeling of going mad and not be able to see what is driving you to insanity cause it always happens under your nose, by your peripheral vision and have no ways to prove it at all.

It got to a point where it seemed like the doorknobs were one... a big entity around the house that gave life to my fucking doorknobs, isn't that just mental????

The stomach growl was something I couldn't get out of my mind though. If they breathed that meant that they were alive, if they snored that meant like with all living creatures, it needed sleep, if they blinked that meant that they could see me, but the growling could only mean that they needed to eat.

I spoke to the landlord and he said that despite how curious it sounds, I wasn't the first person reporting that

"Yeah, Adam, the boy that lived there before you, also reported something of the sorts, he said that he couldn't pay the rent and he didn't want to stay there anyway as he had mentioned that the doorknobs were acting out on their own, packed everything of his and when he was supposed to vacate... he just disappeared... his stuff was still there but he was gone"

"Did you report him missing?"

"I also assumed the worse stuff but then the moving company came and took his stuff so I'm assuming that he left before saying goodbye... though I would have appreciated a farewell, his parting almost left like he just... disappeared"

Disappeared? My heart dropped... The only thing I could think of... as crazy as it sounds, it's that the doorknobs ate him.

I tried to talk with therapists and they always mentioned the chance of considering a psychiatrist evaluation to get meds or even probably an exam to determine whether I had some sort of "Disorder"

Last thing I needed was people calling me a schizo while I was afraid of being eaten by my own goddamn house so I went to alternate places, at first I went to church and resorted to christianity but there is no mention of carnivore doorknobs in the Bible, then I went to the library and ate hours and hours on end of books about animals, ghosts, anomalies and poltergeists... But no... no mention of doorknobs either.

Finally, I resorted to the internet and searched "My doorknobs are..." and: "Loose" "Sticking" "Not working" "Falling off"... But no "Alive"

I felt truly alone, freshman in college meant no friens either and I lived alone, all the professionals had deemed me as clinically insane and I just had 3 days until the rent was due.

So I considered moving out, it might sound paranoic but it's my last resort.

So here I am, packed all my stuff in record time and writing this post as I'm about to leave my appartment.

Bathroom doorknobs, Bedroom doorknobs and office doorknobs... yeah, the closer I am to my parting of this wretched place, the more ridiculous it sounds.

Anyway, I'll be writing an update when I have finally settled in my new appartment, peace out Reddit.

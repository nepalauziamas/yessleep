It all started around May. (a couple months ago) My girl best friend (lets call her Jessica) and one of her friends (lets call her Eve) added me to a group chat on snap one night. For context, I smoke once in a blue moon whenever I am out with my friends. Jessica had asked me if I would buy her and Eve electronic weed pens (adding up to almost $200) so they could get a high at a sleepover. Keep in mind none of us are 18, so you can't just go online or walk somewhere to get what you want. You have to find someone who knows someone. Jessica had never smoked before and Eve only had a couple times. Jessica didn't say she would pay me back for it, or even that she would pay me extra since that's extremely dangerous to do. She had just expected it as a gift. Even if she had said she would pay me back more I still wouldn't have said yes, so you can imagine what my response was. After I had said no Jessica and Eve did not text/call me for a week. Even though I would normally only call Eve like once every other week, me and Jessica would normally call almost every day after school.

One day in the middle of my 5th period class I got a message from one of my guy best friends. He had said to me that I was a disgusting pos and that he no longer wanted to keep any contact with me. Following this I logically asked him what for? He then texted me back and said "Ask Jessica" and blocked me. After 5th period ended as I was walking to 6th, I stopped next to Jessica waiting outside of her class with her other school friends. I asked her why one of my best guy friends had called me a disgusting pos and blocked me. (since he said go ask Jessica) She then responded "Get away from me, don't talk to me." with a smirk on her face. One of her friends had then said while lightly laughing "Get away from her, she doesn't want to talk to you".

As I walked into my 6th period class room and went on my phone. I got a couple messages on instagram from people at my school. They all said that I was a horrible person and had threats saying I should kms. I asked one person "What did I say?" as I genuinely still had no clue what this was all about. They then responded "You said you would r\*pe Jessica if you could". After hearing this my heart immediately dropped to my stomach. I didn't know what to think or what to say as I was completely frozen in my seat. I waited until 6th period had ended and then went home.

I have read many different stories of people getting accused of rape/sa who have been punished with no proof of evidence. Even though double standards can go both ways, when it comes to this, girls will almost always have the more favored word. I would know this since when I was 12 years old I was sexually assaulted by a girl at my middle school. When I had told one of my friends at the time that it made me really upset, he began to laugh at me and told everyone. For years I have been made fun of hearing people say things like "You're a b\*tch for letting a girl on you and not being able to stop her" or "If it was me I wouldn't be complaining". Now that you know this, you know I would be the last person to ever r\*pe someone, or even make a joke about it.  


I had told my mom about the accusations. I deleted all of my social medias as I was still getting threats sent to me. I now do school online at home instead of the in-person high school. If I ever die I will make sure to haunt Jessica. I am not one to hold grudges, or really ever say that I "hate" anyone, but there is nothing that would ever make me forgive that. I will never forget the more than a dozen nights I would spend shaking with panic attacks. All of the tears I cried after seeing that all of my friends would immediately believe something like that without even asking me about it, or offering to listen to my side of the story. Out of everything I've ever been through in my entire life this haunts me the most.

I’m not making this post to brag, but rather to inform others what to look out for. Be aware of your surroundings ladies! 


So I don’t like to admit it, but I’m addicted to TikTok. One day, a video popped up on my FYP about signs of trafficking, and I completely fell down the rabbit hole. 


I know practically every sign you can think of. Zip ties on cars, weird symbols on buildings, etc. I even told my friends to get rid of their baby on board signs.


This information finally got put to use at a Walmart parking lot. See, I was sitting in my car, enjoying my Starbucks before I went in. All of a sudden, I noticed this van parked towards the end of the parking lot. Huge red flag. 


Then I saw a woman just sitting there, waiting. I was sure something was up at this point. And I was completely right,  because this man was walking with a 12 year old girl towards the van! 


I tried to make eye contact with her, just to double check. She ignored me, which is something that victims do! That’s when I sprang into action.


After grabbing my purse, I ran towards the girl. I told the man to get away from her, but he refused. So I maced him. The good gel kind, not that mist shit. He dropped like a stone.


Then his partner jumped out of the van! I wasn’t going to take any more chances, so I grabbed my last resort. But when the woman saw the pistol, she ran faster! I really had no other option but to pull the trigger.


When she went down, I grabbed the girl. She was in shock. On the bright side, it wasn’t hard to drag her into the back seat.


She came back to herself once we were out of the parking lot. She was crying and just kept repeating over and over again that those were her parents. Can you believe that her own parents were trafficking her?!


I promised her that she was safe now, but she didn’t believe me. I wasn’t upset, because I knew a few gentle words couldn’t make such a traumatic experience better. I silently cursed her pathetic excuse for parents.


We were halfway to the police station when she started begging for her life. I reassured her again that she was safe now, but it didn’t work. 


She jumped out of the moving car. The poor kid smashed her head on the asphalt. I will never forgive myself for not locking the doors. I hope you all learn from my mistake! 


Now I’m sitting with her in the ICU. Since she’s in a coma, I made sure to explain the whole situation to the police. They are looking for her traffickers as I type this! 


Like I said. Be. Aware. You never know when you may stumble onto trafficking. Also, trust your instincts. Hopefully, this post will empower you to act!

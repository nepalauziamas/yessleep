Let me start by clarifying some details. It’s not like I can really *see* into the future. When I was a child I realized I could *feel* what was about to happen. A random thought, a prediction, would just slip into my mind and I’d know. Not all the time though, just on occasions. And they weren’t even special occasions, it felt more random. It may be a family thing - my aunt was said to have a gift. On her trip to Jordan, some mysterious people came to her and praised *the gifted one*. Or so my other aunts (her sisters) tell the rest of us on every single family dinner. Can’t know for sure; she passed away on my high school graduation day, sadly, so I can’t ask her directly. 

Sorry for that! I’m very talkative (or *write-ative*, I should say), and get carried away easily. 

Anyway, sometimes it’s hard to discern the thoughts that come from my overactive brain from the thoughts that, well, tell the future. For it to truly be a prediction, the thought or feeling has to come to my mind without any prompting. Let’s say, if I’m on a car thinking about the movie Final Destination (a whole generation was traumatized by that movie) and I suddenly feel that the truck in front of us is about to drop its load in a really catastrophic manner, it probably isn’t true and won’t happen.

I say *probably* because on a few occasions, I’ve disregarded a feeling when there was some kind of input beforehand and then, coincidentally, it came true. A not so fun example of this it is when I was taking the metro back in September 2019, listening to a song from the World War Z OST (I love Muse) and thought to myself “man, could you imagine there was some kind of virus going around right now?”

My hunches not always tell me the future, necessarily. They can also help me understand something that is happening right in that moment.

I recently moved to the city with my boyfriend. I come from a little town in the very south, where there aren’t many jobs in my field, so we moved in search of better opportunities. Our new apartment was amazing (kind of), and very cheap considering the prices of the current market, so we took it without hesitation when it was offered to us. We share it with two other guys, but there’s enough room so it’s no biggie. When I first moved in (I did so when everyone was in their respective hometowns for the spring break), I noticed… something. The energy didn’t feel quite right. The apartment is a duplex, and I got the attic. When I climbed to my room to place my stuff, the air felt… dense. 

I loved my room, and I loved how cheap it was, but it came with its own disadvantages. For example, it doesn’t have a door - you only have to climb up the stairs and that’s it, you’re in my room! Another thing is that it has *too much* storage space. Trust me, it is too much. There’s this massive space, like a cupboard, to the left of the stairs landing. When I first got to it, it was filled with random items and memorabilia from former tenants. It was a mess. And really, I mean *really* creepy. For instance, I found old, blurry pictures of two little girls (we think it’s our landlord and her sister as children, maybe?), a ton of jars with questionable contents, and my least favorite item, a leather bottle locked with chains (why?).

This cupboard was obviously the source of the heebie-jeebies I was getting back then. It’s been almost three months since we’ve moved in, but I still lay awake at night, staring at the corner of the room where cupboard is, making sure nothing decides to come out to scare me and my partner to death. I always keep it closed, as petitioned by my partner, and we don’t even joke about opening it.

I think my hunches help me detect something, they whisper to me that I’m not alone in my house when I should be. Sometimes I can even feel the clichés, a presence just around the corner, a sudden race for my life when I turn off the lights of my very long corridor, you know the drill. But I can’t know for sure. I could also be just imagining it. You see, throughout the years I’ve learned to better distinguish my hunches, but because it is not an exact science, I’ve also had to learn to make use of different tools. And that’s sort of what brings me here today.

I’m guessing most of you have heard of cartomancy, and at least have a basic understanding of how it works. For those who don’t, to put it simply, it’s using cards to help you read and interpret the future. I’m not very talented (yet!), but I’m practicing and that’s what counts, right?

As my own rule, I never use them on me. I just really don’t have much interest in predicting my own destiny (I can’t control the hunches but I can at least have a decision in this matter). Whenever I use cards, it’s to learn about someone else’s future, such as friend or a coworker (it helps me stay relevant in the office). However, my boyfriend moved back home temporarily to deal with a family issue last week and I’ve been getting more and more nervous in my house. Most of the time I’m alone - my roommates work in the afternoon and evening and I have a morning shift, so we don’t see each other much. I usually spend my afternoons reading, drawing or doing some work, while drinking tea and listening to some chill music. Sometimes I go to the gym next door, or go to the movie theater, but that’s about it. My routine is pretty much set. But since he left, it’s been really hard to keep it up when I’m scared 24/7. It seems that whatever is going on in my house, it *knows* that I’m more vulnerable right now. But I don’t know yet if it knows I know, you know?

So that’s why I decided to ask the cards what was going on. I tried first with a pendulum, one of the first items I learned to use (it’s not complicated at all) but I wasn’t getting any clear answers. Plus, it can only answer yes or no questions, so unless I inquire about something very specific, it can’t really do much for me in this situation. 

Have in mind that, because I’m still learning how to use cards, I haven’t really got to the part of… buying tarot cards. For now I use standard playing cards. They can’t help you with complex readings, but for my skill level they work just fine. 

So this afternoon I fixed myself some spearmint tea, light up some green candles and incense, sprinkled some cinnamon around for good luck, sat on my desk facing the sun and got to work. The deck was already sitting on my desk, as it’s only used for this intention. The cards have already started wearing out, which had me thinking I should start looking for a real tarot deck. I chose a very simple layout, three cards in front of me. The left one describes where I come from, how my situation has been, so I can understand precisely what they’re talking to me about; the one in the center describes my current situation, and sheds some light on details I may have overlooked; and finally the third one, on the right, is the one that tells me what’s to happen. I like to think they don’t tell me the actual future, just its possibilities. And I have a good reason to *want to* think that. 

The first card was the King of Golds. It made sense - I’d finally found some stability and happiness in those new beginnings, something I’d longed for. 

The second card was the Knight of Swords, upside down. It means excessive imprudence, foolishness. I paused before drawing the next card. I looked through the window in front of me. It was cloudy but there was enough room for the warm sunlight to come through. I relaxed. 

I grabbed the third card and placed it on the right side. 

A string of decorative lights fell on me and let me tell you, I SCREAMED. I have them all over my room ceiling, and a part of the string hangs directly across on top of the desk. I got up to see why they fell, and found out adhesive that keeps them glued to the wood panels had melted. It’s been really hot this week, so there’s that. I took a mental note to buy some more hangers afterwards and got back to my cards, still feeling on edge.

The third card was the Jack of Goblets. It means lies, deceptions. 

I’ve been looking at this card for about half an hour now. It concerns me, but I don’t get its full meaning. I came here and shared my story with hopes of finding some help, but that’s not the only reason. 

About a minute ago, I realized the cupboard door was wide open.

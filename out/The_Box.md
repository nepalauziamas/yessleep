It was early in the morning, the young woman jerked awake and stared up at the ceiling trying to get her breathing under control. She ran a hand through her hair frowning when it got caught in some tangles, she had tossed around more than she thought. She sighed then sat up not seeing much point in staying in bed any longer. 

The lady went through her usual morning routine then settled on the couch with a cup of something warm and caffeinated to help her get through the day. 
After finishing her drink she hunted down her keys, put on her shoes and set out to work. 
She had just moved to the city to work as one of the stage hands in the local theater, she liked being one of the shadows that made sure everything went right, and generally enjoyed her job along with everyone she worked with

“Lacey!”, 

she sighed and cringed as she finished clocking in, well almost everyone she worked with.

“Who closed yesterday Lacey I can’t find the props for tonight’s show!”, Lacey took a deep breath and slowly turned to face one of the most scatterbrained managers she ever had to work under, 

“ I closed last night Sam the props are right where they should be”, she swiftly moved over to the prop room motioning for Sam to follow, 

“They’re right here”, sam let out an impressed grunt,

“Lacey this place would fall apart without you”, Sam muttered as they moved to get the boxes that were needed for tonight show, Lacey barked out a laugh as she helped gather props and followed sam to the stage

“You’d forget your head if it wasn’t attached Sam,” she teased as she set down the box and checked the list for what else needed to be done before the show.

“Yeah yeah tease all you want, this place wouldn’t be the same without me,” the both shared a laugh then got to work along with the rest of the stage hands.

———————————————————

The show went off without a hitch and everyone was pleased with how it went, the cast and crew were going out to celebrate but Lacey stayed behind to close up the theater, though it wasn’t from the rest of the crews lack of trying, she was just happier with the peace and quite of an empty theater.

She slowly swept up the stage swaying slightly and humming to herself, it was the last thing she had to do before she could close up shop.

Lacey put her coat on and clocked out, she shut off all the lights then locked all the doors, simply going through the motions. It wasn’t until she was a couple of blocks away from the theater that something strange happened. She was walking by a park entrance when someone stood in front of her, which was odd due to the sidewalks being virtually empty. She stared at him, slightly baffled but not one to be pushed around she took in the strange man before her.

He was tall and thin. His breathing was shaken and his eyes bloodshot. He looked like the walking definition of paranoia, and Lacey was starting to get nervous herself.

Just as she was about to move past him both of his hands shot out and grabbed her by the shoulders, tightening to the point where she was wincing. He shook her slightly looking her in the eye. The strange man seemed to be satisfied with what he saw and reached into his coat, Lacey tensed fearing the worst, only for him to pull out a small wooden box.
He pushed it into her hands.

“I am SO sorry for what I’ve gotten you into, but I am a terrible coward,” and with that he sprinted into the park, laughing like crazy, too fast for her to keep up with. She glanced down at the box in her hands and tried to force down the rising feeling that something had just gone horribly wrong, and made her way back home.

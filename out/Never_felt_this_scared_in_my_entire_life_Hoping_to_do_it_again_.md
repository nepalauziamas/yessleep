I am writing this journal in case anything happends to me.

  So i moved to another town for college and there are theese luscious amazing woods like right in the backyard of the house i am staying at and they stretch for fucking miles.

  I wasn't a very athletic person before but the moment i saw the trees and heard the crickets i was gonna be in that forrest every day man.

  I felt the woods like calling to me in a way. At first i went there with some of my roommates but they stopped going with me cause they have their studies to focus on. Three of them are med students so they have way more schoolwork than i do. 

  I still went out there and walked around the trails. Climbed the trees. Did the general exploring wilderness stuff. 

  But one thing i noticed after a few days is that there weren't any animals. Not even birds. Just the crickets. I was thinking i would definitely see like a deer or a boar since i am pretty light on my feet but not a single one. I even hid in a tree for a few hours seeing if i could catch one fo the animals off guard and snag a picture or something. But nope. 

  After four days of waiting up in a tree i just wanted to see an animal so i read up on forrest animal habits and it said that a lot of them were Nocturnal, aka they only come out at night. And the night sky was the clearest it has been in months so the moonlight actually lit up the forrest fairly well. 

  I got to my usual spot where i hide in a tree and set up. The noise of the crickets was more clear than during the day. It wasnt long untill i noticed something. I saw one of the bushes like 20 meters away rustle and my eyes darted towards it. 

  I looked around intently hoping to spot like a wolf or a boar but no noise came from the bush and i sure as hell wasn't going down in the middle fo the night when a wolf or a boar might be near. 

  Then a chill ran down my spine. The crickets went silent. And i started feeling off, like something was stalking me. It definitely wasnt like an animal. It was more malicious. I tried to look around slowly and there they were. A pair of eyes fixed on me. Two glowing yellow eyes like searing metal in a forge. 

  I chose flight instead of fight so i booked it towards my house. The crickets picked up where they left off only this time they were louder, almost deafening. I felt like i couldn't breathe as i was running. 

  I looked back for a bit and the pair of yellow eyes were attached to this wretched almost deer almost human hybrid. It ran on four legs but it had way more limbs. And the ends of those limbs had light reflecting off of them like they were made of metal. I made it to my house and shut the door behind me. Ran to my bedroom upstairs and curled up in a corner. 

  My shutters were down thankfully and i had no intention of peeking out of my window. Then i heard Scraping metal. I felt it vibrate in my bones. But then it scuttled off i guess cause i heard it skittering down the wall of the house. 

I have never fealt this fear my entire life and honestly i was kind of pumped. I am thinking of going after it again tomorrow or maybe a few days. Maybe i should train up my legs a bit.

Well as you've read the title, my name's Paul and I own a dark-web courier business. It's not big and I usually don't take in people I don't know. It's usually the same old customers and almost never new ones. I take my customers' privacy very seriously, therefore I don't know much about them . The reason why I'm writing this is because something happened yesterday and I'm not sure what to do.

So this brings me to my story, I'll start this story with the only logical place, the beginning. I've always been curious and I've been a little introverted since I started school, not sure why it just happened to be. Due to my introvert nature I didn't have many friends in school so I usually just browsed the web, though I started to get bored of the regular old clear-web. Sure it did help with the small itch but when time started to pass it just didn't do the trick. That's when I learned about TOR, "The Gateway to The Unknown '' is how I like to see it. Now I'm sure everyone has heard about the dark-web and the stories surrounding them. Some of them are true but most of them are just bullshit. If you see the dark-web as the Walmart of drugs, firearms and Hit-man services you'd be right, but it's much much more than that. Actually most of it is pretty basic and regular old forums talking to people that can type anything they'd like. It's an uncensored part of the clear-web. This is where my story began, with the forums. After you've been on Nntpchan for a while you start to learn your way around the block. So for those of you who don't know Nntpchan is a forum of sorts, you can find the answer to basically any question in existence. This is where I met my first customer.

Let's call this guy Jack, so, Jack. He's one of the regulars and I don't know much about him. All I know is that he too owns a business here on the web. I have no idea what this guy does or anything about it. All I know is that I deliver his packages here in my hometown. I take them, deliver them to their respective addresses and be on with it. I pick-up the packages at random dead-drop locations I drop them off, and get paid through Crypto. I'm getting ahead of myself now, let's start over. So Jack, I met him on Nntpchan. He messaged me after a post I made about working in the local area and asked me if I was searching for work. I mean I was skeptical about him but what do you expect from me?

Anyway, I told him that I did. Next thing I know he messaged me a link to a website. This website was, weird? no, Unusual. This website was all black with an address written in the middle of the screen with the text "The handicap toilet, under the sink" . I looked for it quickly before the website got shut down. Next thing I know is the sound of a message coming from Jack.

"1 O'clock, Friday. Don't be late, you'll know where to go when you pick up the package."

My first thought was "What the fuck have I gotten into" but I did need the money. I've had troubles with money and as a poor student a little extra cash on the side couldn't hurt.

So, long story short I did as asked. On Friday I went to the address which I've decided not to include due to the privacy of my customers. Anyway, The address that I went to was an old Gas station at the edge of my small town and just as Jack had said, the package was under the sink in the handicap toilet. It wasn't that big, it was a small envelope with a wax seal on it, almost exactly like those you can see in movies or in the library. On my way out a man grabbed my arm and told me a new address

"Go to \[redacted\] 33A, Ask for Mr. Williams and tell him that the Sun's up today, shining splendidly over the lake"

Then he just let my arm go and walked into the handicap bathroom. I was a bit stunned at this but I didn't think much of it. So I did as instructed and biked over to the address given to me from the man in the gas station and knocked on the door. A large man with a long lumberjack type beard and a face filled with acne scars opened the door. I mean this man was huge! Like probably like 6 foot 4 or maybe 6 foot 5 even. It took me a while to grasp the man's appearance before I finally said in a trembling and a little awkward voice.

"Ehm, I'm looking for Mr. Williams. Is he here possibly?"

The huge Lumberjack looking guy stared into my soul for what felt like minutes before he turned around and called out for a guy named "Joe" not his real name but I will do. "Joe, There's some punk here to see you" he muttered. A few seconds later, a slim fairly average height man came to the door and looked at me. "Mr.Williams I presume?" I said I was trying to sound confident. The man just nodded at me.

"The Sun's up today, shining splendidly over the lake"

I said with a bit of unease in my voice while holding out the envelope I had taken from the gas station. The man in front of me Mr. Williams looked at me for a few seconds before responding:

"Surely it is a splendid day to take a swim"

Before I could react he snatched the envelope and shut the door on me. I must add that I was a bit confused by what just happened but I learned later how that came, but that's another story for later. I quickly returned to my bike and biked home.

When I came home I saw that I had an unread message on Nntpchan. It was Jack as I suspected, the message read as follows.

"Well done, the payment has been submitted to your past stated Crypto address, I will be in touch if you're interested in working some more."

Before I could answer I had a new payment on my Crypto vault And there it was, a payment of 350€.

"Holy shit"

I said silently to myself. I know what you're thinking, "Only 350€" well, shut up. For me at this time it was huge! I was a poor student so...leave me alone. So now that we have established my financial supremacy we can continue. Jokes aside, I was poor and I needed the cash. Let's leave it like that.

I quickly sent a message back to Jack.

"Fuck yeah man, I'll take everything"

Looking back at it now, I kind of regret that statement, for an example, Do you understand how fucking hard it is to clean up after some weird liquid that dripped from the pallet the other day. Or or that time when I had the police search my whole storage facility due to some "suspicious marks" on one of the boxes I received a few days before. So I told the officers that they can't search my premises without a warrant and probable cause. So the officers turned around and never came back.

As I have stated before. I take my customers' privacy extremely serious. Now I don't usually ask what's in the package if it's not something that's in need of special attention and if so I don't ask what's in them rather I ask what special care it needs. I try to refrain from knowing too much, those damn cops aren't going to get anything out of me.

Anyway I continued working for Jack, he's well, one of the regulars. He always wants something delivered on Fridays each week, never to the same house or block, always in different parts of the town, the only consistent thing is that it's always that same looking envelope, that pale-white one with that red wax stamp. I try not to think about it but I'm certainly curious about what's inside of it...

I'll get back to all of you some other day. I have a lot more to tell you about my work but right now, it's Friday and I got a delivery to make. You guessed it, It's from Jack as always but this time it's not an envelope like before...It's a pearl white box with the writing, "To the man who supplies". I'm not sure what that means and I'm not sure if I want to, something is telling me that it's not my business but I'm a curious one. 

Always has been....

Note to reader:

This is my first upload, hopefully many more to come, I need advice from you guys. That damn box is eating away at my curiosity. What should I do? I'm tempted to open it... I really am

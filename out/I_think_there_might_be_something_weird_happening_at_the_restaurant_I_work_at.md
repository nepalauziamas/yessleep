It has been 266 days and 8 hours since I saw my husband dead on my living room couch. Since that horrific evening, I have been a shell of my former self. My husband was the most beautiful man on this planet, he loved bringing in wounded animals and nursing them to care before finding homes for them or releasing them back to their natural habitats. He lit up a room with his presence, he was the best person I had ever known. He helped me to be a better version of myself. He was the good one in our relationship, everyone would teasingly say that he was my better half but I knew that there was sincerity behind those statements. He was a people person, everyone in town loved him. That’s why I found it incredibly hard to piece together why someone had come into our home and left him a bloody, decapitated mess. It was a normal Tuesday, I had just gotten off work at my shift at the local restaurant “Wendy’s Gobsmacking BBQ”. My boss had me stay late that night as we were short handed. I had just clocked out and I was so excited to come home to my husband, our weeknight routine involved a chilled beer and crappy television. I know that sounds lame, but those nights were dear to my heart. I finally got to the door and it was left ajar, I found this unsettling because over the past few months our quiet town has grown to be widely infamous for the amount of missing mental health patients at the asylum. My husband was very concerned in the rising crime and animal injuries he has seen lately and suspected the patients so he always locked the door, even in the day time.
“Honey? I’m home and I brought your favorite! Wings!” I called out. No response. The pit in my stomach grew larger, my husband would always rush to the door to greet me and give me a kiss. I apprehensively made my way in, all of the lights were off. Maybe he wasn’t home? But that wouldn’t make sense. His car was in the driveway. The quietness was thick and eerie, I had a deep instinct to be quiet. It felt very wrong in there. I flipped on the light, and that’s when I saw all the blood. It was everywhere. My heart started to beat louder in my chest, I swear I could hear it out loud.
“Honey? Are you okay? Please say something, this isn’t funny!” I urged. 
Nothing, again. I hoped it was some sick prank… Maybe he had brought in an injured deer and didn’t get the chance to clean up the blood. Maybe he had to rush the deer to the local wildlife rehab he volunteered at. I followed the blood trail to the living room and I flicked the light switch on. The TV was on, the blood trail led to the couch facing the television. I slowly made my way to the couch and the image I saw still remains burned into my retinas. There was my husbands body, or what was left of it… His stomach was ripped open, his head next to him on the couch, blank eyes staring at the TV, mouth hanging open as if he were screaming…Blood was everywhere. The sickest thing being was that this looked staged. His head was propped to be looking at the TV, his body was set up in a way where it looked like he had just been relaxing, a beer in his hand. It was obvious he wasn’t murdered on the couch and instead either in the woods outside of our home or somewhere else on our property. It didn’t make any sense, and it still doesn’t. The rest is a blur, the police came and I made a statement. They believe one of the missing mental health patients had broken in and murdered him in a frenzy. That wouldn’t make sense, as I said before my husband was a cautious man. He always locked the doors. He never let strangers in. The strangest thing though… The police said all of his organs were missing. Who breaks into a house, doesn’t steal any valuables and in turn murders a man and steals all of his organs? I attempted to follow up with the medical examiner, but she stated that he had already been cremated. Who would cremate a murder victim before the case was resolved? This whole situation has left my stomach churning. For 266 days, 8 hours and 30 minutes it feels like I have been the only one trying to figure out what has happened to my husband. My beautiful, sweet Oliver who wouldn’t hurt a fly, whom everyone loved was gone. And those same people who claimed they loved him are doing nothing to solve this. If the police are right and one of the missing asylum patients had done this, why have they not caught them? Why have they done nothing to further the case? Why has no progress been made? Why aren’t they trying to protect the rest of the civilians? Since my husbands death about 10 people have been murdered in similar ways, 10 deaths in almost 9 months and no leads, no progress… After Oliver passed, I didn’t go into work for a month but I came back and it has been busier than ever. Everyone raves about how good Wendy’s ribs are. I swear we are probably running our meat suppliers dry of their cattle! It’s been a help at distracting me from Oliver’s murder… I have no time to think! Wendy has been so sweet to me since Oliver’s passing - she’s given me a great big raise and she always gives me leftovers to bring home, she’s the sweetest! I never eat them because I’m a vegetarian. There’s something about seeing your husbands bloodied body that will turn you off from meat. I know it sounds funny, a vegetarian working at a BBQ place, but Wendy offers the best pay and benefits in the whole town. I end up giving the meat to my neighbors, I haven’t been able to look at wings the same since the night he died. Any way, the weirdest thing happened tonight. One of my neighbors was just standing outside my house, drooling like an animal and staring at me through the window…Something in my stomach is telling me this might have something to do with the sudden, unexplained murder of my husband. I am going to stay at my sisters place tonight, but tomorrow I will be investigating this further. Ta ta for now.

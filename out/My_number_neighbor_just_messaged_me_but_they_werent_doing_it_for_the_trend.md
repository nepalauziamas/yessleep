For the first time in a little over a month, I received a text message yesterday morning.

When I first saw the number that messaged me, I thought I had gone crazy. I thought it was my number, but after examining it a little closer the second time, I noticed that our number was the same except for the last number.

Then I remembered about the dumb little “Number Neighbor” trend, so I rolled my eyes and opened up the text, fully prepared to block the number, but what was written was what stopped me.

**”Sorry, but I don’t have a lot of time to explain. I can’t access my internet, and my call won’t even go through with 911. Please. This is my address (sorry I won’t write the address here.) Will you please call 911 for me and tell them that there is someone in my house.”**

I didn’t think twice, I called 911 and gave them the address and told them about the message I received.

After I got off the phone, I sent a message back.

*”I called the cops for you, but why didn’t you message anyone else?”*

It didn’t take a while to get a text back.

**”I tried texting everyone on my contact list, but the messages weren’t going through. I got desperate and decided to text every number I could think of, your the only one that messaged back. I hope the cops get here soon. I’m hiding in the closet. I think they already killed my husband and kids.”**

I didn’t really know what to say, so I sent back a text hoping it would at least calm them down.

*”I called the cops. They should be there soon. I’m sure you will be fine if you keep hiding in the closet.”*

Around ten minutes later, I received a phone call. It wasn’t from the number that texted me.

Fearing the worst, I waited for a couple of rings before answering it.

**”Hello. This is Officer Stephens. I am told the emergency line received a call from you to check on an address. I’m giving you a call because the house that you reported has been burned down three years ago. Now, can you please tell me if you were doing a little prank or if you really received a text?”**

Confused and a little pissed, I told him, *”Yeah, I did. I’m sorry if someone was pranking me, but I really did receive a text.”*

The officer sighed and the line was silent for a couple of seconds before he responded back.

**”Alright, if they message back let me know. We have been getting a couple of noise complaints around this neighborhood this morning, but none of the callers could give us an exact house to check on.”**

I agreed to let him know, and he hung up the phone.

Against my better judgment, I tried calling the number that messaged me, but after the second ring, I was sent to voicemail. I tried calling four more times after, but it did the same thing each time.

I messaged the number a couple of times, but I never got a response back.

The only reason why I am writing to you all right now is because tonight while I was cooking dinner I heard **”Breaking News”** come from my tv.  I looked at the tv for the next three minutes in absolute horror.

Two dead bodies were found in a house that was next to the house I called in for.

A man and his little kid.

A couple of seconds later my phone vibrated in my pants.

I took my phone out and saw that there was a text.

**”I really did get you with my texts earlier, didn’t I?:) Don’t get out of your house. I’m right outside. You have six hours left to live before I send my friends into your house;) Do whatever you need to do before then.”**

I tried calling and messaging people, but it won’t work. I tried Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, hell I even tried Youtube, but none of them work. 

So I’m posting on here, hoping that maybe this site will work.

I live on 168 I’m a dumbass who thought I could post my address when I type it in. Fuck. God damnit, it keeps writing that whenever I write my address.

Fuck it. I’m gone. 

I don’t know what I can do, but I guess take this as a free lesson.

When an unknown number messages you, don’t message back. Fuck, don’t get involved. Just call the cops and leave it alone. 

There obviously isn’t any hope for me, but maybe I can help someone else out in the future.

For the last time, I’m logging out.

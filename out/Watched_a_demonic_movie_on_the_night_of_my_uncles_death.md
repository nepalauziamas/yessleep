First of all, I'm totally skeptical. I don't believe in gods, demons, spirits or anything out of the ordinary. One day, I was at my grandparents' house, in the interior of the state where I live. There wasn't much to do there besides helping my grandfather with his farm.

Every night I watched several movies on Netflix. That day, I chose a movie called "The Ritual". It was the story of a priest who had lost faith in God, but had a very good heart. Therefore, he was recommended to be an exorcist, and he witnessed some cases up close. The story is interesting, I recommend it. After finishing the movie, I remember watching a few episodes of Mindhunter and going straight to bed.

The dream began. I rarely remember my dreams, but I will hardly forget this one. I was at a party in a condominium where some friends of mine live, some things didn't make sense, but nothing relevant, things that happen in dreams anyway. At the end of the party, a friend of mine's father was driving me home and my older sister was with me in the car. On the way to my house, he turned onto the wrong street, where my old house used to be, and nowadays my grandmother lives there. 

I realized there was something different with her house. There were some mosses coming out, a kind of heavy environment, and several cars of family acquaintances were parked on the street. I said to my sister "Did you see that?", she replied that we'd better go see what happened. I asked my friend's father to leave us there, we got out of the car and thanked him. When we entered the house, my mother, grandmother and several other aunts and cousins ​​looked at my sister and me as if we weren't supposed to be there. I saw that my grandfather was there (he died 6 years ago). I was very happy and the first thing I did was give him a hug, I even remember how real it felt to see him. I remember my mother smiling slightly when she saw that I enjoyed seeing my grandfather alive.

However, in the middle of the hug, he started to turn into those mosses we had seen outside the house. Immediately, my mother and uncle started yelling at me, as if I had gone back to being a child and had done something. They never stopped. The screams began to echo in my mind. I went into the bathroom and locked myself in there, but it wasn't enough. My mother started knocking on the door telling me to leave, while I heard several cries in the background. That left me with a genuine feeling of hate. When I came out of the bathroom, I ignored my mother screaming and tried to leave the house, but my uncle stopped me. I got really pissed off and gave him a push to get away from me. It flew away, hit the wall and fell to the ground. My mother looked at me in horror.

I ran out of the house and found my sister. I asked what the fuck had happened, and she replied "Cida (my great-grandmother) died and they used her soul to revive grandpa.". At that moment, I felt a strong chill and woke up. I got out of bed, I realized I was very sweaty and panting. I thought to myself "What? That was real as fuck!" I got up to go to the bathroom and kept pushing the walls on the way to see if that strength when I pushed my uncle was gone. The next day, I called my mother, told her about the dream and asked how my great-grandmother was doing (she is 93 years old). My mother is religious and was worried about my dream. Minutes later, I got a message saying that my great-grandmother was fine, but that my uncle Vando (not the uncle who appeared in the dream, but very close to my great-grandmother) had a heart attack and died. I was never close to him, but ever since then, I've been wondering if that dream was really a coincidence.  At his funeral, I felt like they were looking at me too much.

NOTE: My great-grandmother used to work with spells and rituals. People paid her to make all sorts of things happen. Nowadays she is the most Christian person I know, some even say she has a gift of healing. I never sought to find out more due to my skepticism, but several family members swear they've seen her possessed. If you guys want, I can ask my mother to tell me a story about when they used to live together.

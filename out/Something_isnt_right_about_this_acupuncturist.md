When Leopoldo arrived in this town to open an acupuncture clinic everyone thought it would fail. This wasn’t a place where this would be popular the nearest acupuncture clinic was at least 400 miles away in the next state over. After a few weeks Leopoldo began to venture out into town to speak mostly with the women at the women planning the towns annual crochet festival since this was all we were known for. He began making promises of life changing relief from every ailment that could possibly be experienced and offering free treatments so they they too could experience the deepest bliss life had to offer. A few brave souls began to peek into his office. As soon as a few began we began to hear the entire town recommending him as everyone now knew someone who was seeing him. It began to burn through the population like a wildfire, soon there was a line of people looking almost rabid trying to get it in at all hours of the day and night. 

I began to feel curious about what was really going on there as it seems this had tore about every relationship in this town. Families were torn apart by the craze. All anyone wanted to to do was be there. Leopoldo had know taken over the entire shopping center to accommodate to hunger for his services. More acupuncturists we’re arriving by the day as well as people no one has ever seen around here who we’re not leaving but sleeping on the street with hollow souls when they were not lined up to get in. 

With a heart full of fear and excitement I decided to go see for myself what this was all about. I had my reservations as once when I locked eyes with Leopoldo I felt a chill to my core. 

I entered the clinic and was enveloped in an aroma of earthy incense surrounded by dim light which eased my nerves. All the doors were closed and I could hear muffled carnal sounds and movement. He welcomed me into him with an smile that radiated from within and locked into me. I couldn’t help but feel transfixed and was ready for whatever it was as long as it was with him. 

He took me into the last room at the left of a long hallway and asked me to tell him all my ailments. I spilled every ache and longing in my physical and spiritual being to him and he assured me it would all go away after today and had me sign a contract which said I would no longer belong to myself or be myself but I would be his property under his control but I would be happy. Happiness is something I never thought existed but his charm and comfort gave me a glimpse into a future without the pain of loneliness. Once I signed he instructed me to undress and we would begin treatment. 

He began first to touch my back and slowly release the tension from my knots I began to feel the my blood flowing and my clitoris throbbing. He slowly began to insert needles down my spine and with each needle I felt myself become fluid. The desire continued until he instructed me to flip over and performed cupping over my breasts the pressure and sexual desire continued to grow. Then he asked if I was ready and I immediately knew for what quickly he pulled me to edge of the procedure bed and entered me as he continued to puncture more needles into my stomach which only increased with every thrust. I became transported to another dimension a feeling beyond orgasm a bliss of being one with myself. 

I don’t remember coming out of the trance but when I regained the feeling of reality I was in a room with more people having this needle induced sex. I saw someone leaving and paying Leopoldo and for a second I think this is sex trafficking ring but then he came and looked into my soul and I forgot. My only recollection of what this might be, what he might be comes to me when I write. I only write when he leaves to welcome a new member to the clinic like when he did with me. 

The days bleed into each other now, I am bliss, I am me but I can’t shake the contract that he had me sign and the nonhuman look he has in his being.

`The Smiley`

`Sayer held his breath as he shuffled around the living room. He felt as if the distance`

`would never close, and that this moment was eternal; a perpetual nightmare in an endless loop of time. Sayer felt enveloped by death and misfortune as loved ones dropped dead like flies in cold climates. Bloodstains found in places where he knows he never bled.`

`bled. Smells of rot and decay in the dark corners of his house a strange painting drawn on a wall was the closest thing to a smiley face but in fact he was on a street he didn't know and there was absolutely nothing, just a car and that painting I recognize why that painting was drawn there.`

`I was in a street I didn't know and there was absolutely nothing, just a car and that painting that I recognize why that painting was drawn there, but the question why am I here? this is a dream? this will be absolute nothingness, strangely I heard some noises coming from that painting, it started to rain very hard... for some strange reason I felt a fear towards that painting and I don't know why, but why was it raining if there is nothing here just a car, and that painting just that... when I was walking I felt observed as if someone was chasing me I felt that feeling it was like a demon was following you, I got desperate, I got desperate, I felt like a demon was following me, I got desperate, I felt like a demon was chasing me, I felt like a demon was chasing me.`

`I got desperate, I got more nervous, I didn't know what to do to get out of that car or stay with that painting it sounds silly because of what I said but... I don't know how to explain it really.... but I didn't hesitate to escape from there to get out of that car and go here, maybe it's the way out of here or maybe that painting is the culprit... I ran to the car I got in it, it's strange that the car is carrying it's as if someone did it... Or maybe? I fell in their plan. A laugh that left me with nerves was a laugh that just hearing it scared you... the laugh came from that painting of a smile, "HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA" "Did you really think to escape by a simple car?" "well no" "even if you want to escape from this dream you can't" "oh no" "oh no, you can't.`

`this dream you can't" "oh no.." "This is not a dream, this is."`

`"look maybe you don't know me but I wrote this down so you can escape the painting you saw is not normal just an avatar of an all powerful identity, but maybe you are wondering why you are here you are not in a dream it is stupid to think that, you are really in an infinite dimension, with thousands of games, the purpose is to entertain the smiley, that is the real purpose why he put you here, you just have to not die, if you die you will take away his fun, he can dominate and control absolutely all the laws and rules so he can change the rules of the game."`

`"to explain a little bit about this place you have to know that these dimensions exist outside of all the universal and natural laws in fact this dimension goes beyond these laws... the universes are infinite and with a force beyond the metaphysical concept and metaphysical knowledge. if you did not know is that this place called "the hell of happiness" which is an infinite dimension with infinite layers and each layer is representative of the games that the smiley created this dimension is outside of the universes being at a point beyond these. even its creator called as "the smiley" is even beyond the conceptualization and the narration and was represents as someone absolute".`

`"even the smiley was imposed the narrative of transcending everything, a narrative is imposed by its author ignoring everything that puts its author and surpassing the imposed narrative of his completely erasing the narrative or able that he is already on a higher plane than our narrative."`

`"His thought is "Love is scary! Make a vow to love someone in sickness and in health, for richer and for poorer, and crimes go unwitnessed because the loss of love destroys as a heart rotom hear that love is the origin of life, and fear arises part of love."`

`"because simply smiley is what makes you human is what originates our happiness and our friendship, but at the same time originates hatred sins."`

“You’re going to help me find my bitch of a wife, and we’re going to skin her alive until she spills every secret.”

The man stared at me, eyes glazed over. I understood that a deep, fundamental part of him was breaking in that moment. [I knew that I could stop it, that I could help end the worst pain of his life, and that I wasn’t going to](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/xfoxqz/i_decided_today_that_my_marriage_is_too_violent/).

“Now bring your son downstairs. There are people in a van outside who will take him away.”

The cracking of his mind culminated with those words. Eggers stepped backward like he was falling, caught himself on the door, then finally saw me for what I was worth. 

“You should pray that souls aren’t real, because yours has nowhere to go but hell.”

There was a time when those words could have hurt me. But I’d broken just like Eggers had, and the shattered pieces had no capacity to hold the unimportant bullshit that we believe will matter after we die.

“Daddy, why are you acting weird?”

Adrenaline spiked in my chest as little Albert said these words while walking down the stairs. I waited for his father to reassure him, to say *any*thing of comfort.

But he bumbled down the steps in silence.

“Dad?” he pressed, turning around upon entering the hallway.

My heart broke when I saw him. The boy was small for six. His blond hair stuck out in a dozen different directions over a disheveled Baby Shark t-shirt.

Eggers continued to move in baffled silence, resting his hand against his son’s back while ushering him toward the front door.

“Why aren’t we having breakfast, Daddy?” he squeaked. “I want Lucky Charms.”

I sat on the edge of panic; Eggers looked ready to crumble. And while I sympathized with the pain that he was enduring, his son’s wellbeing was exactly why the man needed to keep his shit together.

Holding my breath, I waited for him to speak.

“Um. We’re getting Lucky Charms at school today, kiddo. Three bowls.” His face was the color of petrified bird shit.

“Oh, yay, thank you, Daddy!” Albert piped in response. “I love you.”

Eggers swayed on the spot. I silently urged him to put one foot in front of the other, but the task seemed beyond his capacity at the moment. 

Then he put his hand on the doorknob. He turned it. 

Albert didn’t move. Eggers didn’t move. I didn’t move. 

Then he pushed the door open, leading his son away from home. 

I moved after them with as much speed as I could muster while keeping silent. Upon reaching the front door, I pressed my eye against the crack. 

Eggers and his son had reached the curb in front of their house. A black van was sitting before them with one door open. Albert was standing behind his father, arms wrapped around the larger man’s thigh.

Shit. I wordlessly begged him to take the final step and be done with this God-forsaken process so that we could actually attempt to fix it.

I stopped breathing as no one moved.

Then a pale hand reached from inside the van. It grabbed Albert’s arm.

I prayed to a devil that I didn’t believe in that this would be the end of things.

Albert hugged Eggers tighter, but the older man didn’t move. The pale hand peeled the boy away.

He sobbed. Once.

That broke his father, who grabbed Albert and pulled him away. Together, the two of them ran toward the house, right where I was waiting for them. Eggers, red-faced, looked directly at me.

God. Damn. It.

This shit show had turned sideways, and I tried to think of the least horrible way to stop the insanity. I didn’t like the options.

Eggers had gone five steps before realizing that his son was no longer next to him. He slammed to a halt, turned around, and scrambled to where his son lay on the ground. The man grabbed Albert’s hand and tried to pull him to his feet, but the boy just flopped like a rag doll. Blood gushed from the side of his temple; a chunk of his skull was gone, with scrambled gray matter now spilling out of the cavity. The entire left half of his body shined crimson. All the while, Eggers gazed at the wide-eyed body of his dead child, looking more confused than anything else.

I had run halfway to them before realizing what I was doing. Eggers raised his head; upon seeing my face, he finally seemed to understand what was happening. Rage flowed through him; even if I had time to explain that I wasn’t the one who shot his child, that the bullet had come from the black van, I doubted he had the capacity to listen. I was the face most easily associated with the murder of his son, and he was going to act. He moved on hurt and fear, and there’s no argument that can overcome those emotions. 

I knew that fighting wasn’t an option this time: he would keep attacking until one of us was dead and the other was permanently wounded. I knew that he was too high on his own emotions to stop himself voluntarily, even at gunpoint. I raised the Glock, aimed it, and yelled that he needed to stop anyway.

He didn’t stop. When he was ten feet away, I pointed at his leg and fired.

The shot obliterated his kneecap, and he tumbled to the ground. With a sickening *crack*, his neck hit the concrete step leading up to his porch.

The tip of my pistol shook as I held it before me. I moved slowly to where Eggers lay near his own front door. 

He was a mess. What had once been a knee was now a tangle of blood, bone, and muscle. He seemed unfazed, though; in fact, Eggers didn’t move at all, despite lying at a crooked angle. His head bent awkwardly against the edge of the step.

That’s when I understood that he was paralyzed. The fall had clearly broken his neck, and he couldn’t move anything below his chest. Eggers looked up at me, hollow eyes full of hate. He glanced down toward where his dead son lay, then looked back up at me.

“Just finish it,” he wheezed.

I pointed the gun at his head and pulled the trigger. I figured I at least owed him that much.

That’s when the men from the van grabbed me.

The first feeling I had upon waking up was that I didn’t want to wake up.

My heart thrummed as nausea reached my forehead. Something was very, very *wrong*.

The only weak light in the room was a dim recessed bulb in the ceiling directly above me. Acid tickled my uvula. My arms shook as I tried, and failed, to calm myself. I made an effort to sit up, but the attempt failed. I realized that my wrists and ankles were tied to the table. Rather than accepting this, however, this knowledge sent me into a frenzy. Fear has a way of stripping our higher brain, leaving a raw limbic system than comprehends emotion but not logic. 

“You excel at wasting time, Jim, but it really is annoying, so cut that shit out,” a woman’s voice came from the shadows nearby.

“*Sora*?” I snapped. The sound of my wife increased my horror tenfold. “What the fuck are you doing to me?” I gasped for air. “Are your people going to eat my while I’m still… like you did to Kara?” Without being able to wipe away tears, they pooled in my eyes and ran down my cheek. 

“Not *my* people, Jim,” she explained, stepping halfway into the light. Shadows danced about her features, making her look almost halfway human. “*Our* people.”

“Fuck off, Sora,” I spat. “There is no ‘us.’ The only thing you were good for was bringing our daughter into the world, and you destroyed her.” I took in a great, trembling breath. “You’re a monster.”

She just smiled. “How do you feel?”

I turned away from Sora and tried to pretend that she didn’t exist. 

“If you have any desire to understand what’s happening, Jim, just answer the simple question,” she said as though teaching a confused child how to tie a shoe. “How do you feel?”

I wanted to cry, and I wanted to vomit.

But mostly, I wanted to vomit.

“I… I’m full,” I answered in a quiet voice, my stomach churning. “More full than I’ve ever felt.” I turned to look at Sora, my hands trembling. “What did you people do to me?”

She rested her hands on her hips. “You know the way our kind harvests strength,” she answered in a quiet voice.

“I know that… *no*.”

“It’s the way of things, Jim. That’s our nature.”

“Stop. Stop saying ‘our.’” My throat felt like it was going to break. 

“You’ll be much stronger, Jim. You took in 19.13 pounds, and there were *two* of them. One was a child, and the other was your own kill. Do you have any idea how powerful that will make you?”

“Stop saying that I’m like you!” I sobbed. “Don’t say it!”

“It will be easier just to accept the truth, Jim. We made it happen while you were asleep. Why are you so afraid?”

“Because YOU MADE ME EAT THEM!” I wailed, tears streaming down my face. “You fed Eggers and his boy to me while I was sleeping!”

Sora crossed her arms. “What’s the big deal, Jim? They were already dead.”

Reality seemed to invert itself as I stared at the ceiling. “What – what about Kara?” I gasped. “The whole reason I did this – everything – it was for her.” I tried to swallow, but the sensation made me ill. “Can you bring her back like you promised?”

She scoffed. “Don’t be an idiot, Jim. I was lying to you so that I could get you to act the way I wanted. It’s impossible to raise the dead.”

And with that, she turned to walk out of the room.

“The consumption will give you strength. Let it flow through you, and you’ll be strong enough to break those bonds.” She slipped into the shadows and left the room.

I refused to accept her words. I would sooner die on this table.

But I couldn’t fight the sudden feeling that radiated from my core. Strength flowed into my arms and legs. With a mighty heave, I pulled on the rope. They snapped like taffy, and I was free.

I was one of them.

*

Sora was right. Eating people is our nature. I can’t stop the urge to consume again, which simultaneously delights and disgusts me. I don’t want to live like this, and I don’t want to be responsible for an innocent person’s death. Besides, losing my daughter has destroyed my will to exist. 

So I’m going to protect the world by taking my own life. I will post my experience far and wide as a warning to others, and then I will end things as fast as possible. I blame everything on Sora. I hate her. Goodbye.

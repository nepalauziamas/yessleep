After an odd series of events, including my lamp randomly being thrown and smashed on the ground in the middle of the night, to the door opening randomly, I decided to buy security cameras for the back porch. For context, I live in a tiny suburb located just off the border of Michigan. This suburb is new and so far, no murders have occurred, along with around 3-7 attempted robberies. Nothing paranormal has happened, even in the nearby woods. One child went missing and was found after two hours, eating a stolen chocolate bar from the corner store. 

But anyway, that has nothing to do with this. I've reported this to the police, and they're investigating. Recently, strange things have been happening in the middle of the night. My dog, a Rottweiler, has been waking up in the middle of the night and randomly barking at the back porch. Earlier, I associated it with him having to use the bathroom, but he refused. Once he cooled down, he wouldn't fall asleep again. I guess that meant he was on high alert, but I was honestly starting to freak out. 

Eventually, he stopped going to sleep altogether, standing alert in the doorway looking into the porch. After that, he cooled now a bit since things stopped happening. But just two nights after he cooled down, weird things started up again in the back porch. I lived alone, but I could hear footsteps.

*'Crash!'*

I suddenly woke up. I could hear faint breathing, but just assumed it was the dog. I walked into the porch. The breathing faded away, and I noticed my (now-broken) lamp. "Ugh." I said in that 'half-awake, half-asleep' state. I picked it up, cleaned up the glass, and just then noticed muddy tracks in the house. I was too tired to do anything, so I just went back to bed on the couch. After that night, more things would fall, break, or both. 

One day, as I was getting back to the house after work, I noticed more muddy tracks. I also noticed my pillows all over the ground on the back porch. I went to the refrigerator to get a snack, and then would clean up the mess. And then I realized. Half of my food was missing, even though I had gone to the store just two days before. "That's weird.." I thought to myself. I was too tired from work to worry about it now. That's when it came to me. "Aha! I'll just buy a security camera or two, and put them up in the back porch! Perfect." I smiled to myself, and got ready to go.

6:00 PM, returning from grocery store.

I got back home and whipped through the instruction manual. I put one up on each side. All night I was anticipating the moment I would fall asleep. I was going to be able to see what was happening at night! Then, maybe I could prove to myself that I wasn't going crazy. I sat still all evening, spaced out, thinking about what could happen.

I regret putting up the cameras.

I checked the cameras first thing in the morning. It all seemed terrible. At 1:08 AM, and odd figure walked out of my closet. It had long, stringy hair that stretched down to its rib cage. Speaking of it's rib cage, it seemed like it hadn't eaten in years. No, *decades.* It had long, ugly teeth and stood almost as tall as the ceiling, It's eyes bloodshot. It flailed it's long arms all around the room, knocking down books and paintings and pictures. It let out what I believe was supposed to be a maniacal laugh, but it sounded more like a wild shriek, like a three-year old having a tantrum.

I didn't even think about cleaning such a mess. I contacted police, who are currently investigating. I can't get the image out of my mind, letting something like that live in the house for weeks. The police probably think I'm crazy. There hasn't been a single report of something like this for years. The last person was admitted to a mental hospital. I have no idea what to do. I've gone mad, I can't even go to a grocery store without having a breakdown. I could have died if that continued.

*Help me.*

 

As the name says I found a notebook, I found in the middle of bum-fuck nowhere, in the middle of a forest on a stone podium that looks to have been there for decades if not centuries. I mean it’s crumbling, covered in moss, vines and dirt. This book was a leather bound journal and when I opened it, it had the standard stuff, notes of things in the forest, drawings, and what looked like college notes. From what I could gather this was a notebook for a college student that also used it for recreation. I didn’t look through it too much, so I put it in my bag and continued on my walk through the forest. After that I headed home and took a nap on my couch, I say nap but in reality it was an early sleep. The only reason I call it a nap is because I woke up later in the night and couldn’t get back to sleep. I couldn’t get that damn book out of my mind so I walked over to my bag where I had thrown it in the hallway because I was too tired to take it to my bedroom. I opened it up and pulled the leather bound book from my bag and opened it. I read through and I’ll compile all the info I have found thus far; this journal belonged to a 23 year old man that’s studying to be a lawyer. He likes drawing outdoors and really likes birds. The last normal page was notes on lawyer mumbo-jumbo and the very next pages will stick with me for a long time. It goes as follows:

I just fell through the goddamn forest floor and now I’m what I can only describe as hell, not metaphorically but literally, the trees are dead and burnt to ash, the ground is scolding hot and everything is either burnt or burning. I was going on a walk through my favorite part of the forest looking for birds to study when I tripped on a rock and instead of falling on my face I fell forward into a roll and landed on my back, which I don’t which is worse landing on my face or getting the wind knocked out of me. My phone has no service so I can’t tell anyone about this major problem, or get help. I’m going to try to find water or food in this hell-scape, I’ll try to write to you as much as possible.

This alone wouldn’t be scary because who would believe this, only there was a picture attached via paper clip, and it looked exactly how he described it, everything was either burnt or burning, he left out the ash that fell like snow and stuck to the ground. I studied the picture for a brief moment before continuing to the next page:

I can’t describe what the fuck I just saw,(continuing off of the hell narrative) I think it was a demon. It was all black, horned and the shapeless, when it turned around it had glowing white eyes but thankfully I was hidden from sight so it didn’t take long for it to turn back and when it did that I ran, I think it saw me or it was a major coincidence because at that moment a shrill shriek came from behind me. I ran even faster and didn’t look back in case it was right on me or I ran into something, eventually I turned back and saw nothing so I slowed to a stop, sat down, and rested. I don’t have anything to sleep on so I guess I’ll sleep on a rock, and this place is plenty warm so I don’t need a blanket. I didn’t find any water but there is a living tree that provides a very bitter fruit but food is food. I’ll try to write tomorrow.

This entry had nothing attached to it but the pages definitely were a bit crispy, probably from sitting on the hot ground for so long.

My watch broke over the night at 12:12. I have no clue what time it is but everything is frozen, looks like a lot of people have to do a lot of things because hell froze over. It’s absolutely freezing, any water that might have been here is now frozen. I just realized that any water is now frozen so now it is easier to find. This entry is going to be shorter because I have to spend as much time as I can looking for water. I'll try to keep time.

August 21st, 2022, about 4 hours later

I managed to get my watch working again and I set it to 12 so I know how much time has passed. It's about 3:36 now so I’d say it’s been about 4 hours since I started looking for water. I found a very small amount on the top of a burnt tree. I’ll keep looking but I doubt I’ll find too much more. Again, this one will be short because I need to keep looking for water. 

I find these entry’s very interesting, so much so that I won’t be able to sleep until I finish these entries.

Found enough water to survive yesterday, I can’t describe how fucked I am, I saw more of those things, they were standing in a circle around a hole, they were chanting something I couldn’t understand nor repeat. I tried to peek from my hiding spot but they noticed me and started their horrible screaming. I fell over and they didn’t move, they just screamed. I stood up as they continued to scream, I walked towards them as they turned to match my movements. I looked in the hole only to see a light at the bottom. I’m going to take a gamble, I’m going to jump.

This next part is on the same page but it was scribbles. I’ll try my best to translate.

HOLY SHIT, I JUMPED, MY LEGS ARE BROKEN BUT I'M NEXT TO A PODIUM, I'M GOING TO PUT THIS UP THERE AND I HOPE IT REACHES SOMEBODY, IF ANYONE FINDS THIS, HELP ME PLEASE

I saw this and immediately stood up to go to the door. I needed to find this person. I got in my car and drove to the forest. I needed answers, I made it to the podium and found a phone. I opened it and saw a note, it read as follows: Who took my journal, please help. Attached was an image, it showed what I can only assume was legs and those demons. They stood over him, screaming, I could almost hear it.

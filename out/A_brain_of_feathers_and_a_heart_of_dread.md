I first started sharing my story over a month ago in the post [Feathers in the Attic](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/vngwif/feathers_in_the_attic/). Since then, I’ve posted four updates, the last being [Blood off a duck’s back](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/vwimi5/blood_off_a_ducks_back/). If you’re a bit lost, look [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/peculi_Dar/comments/vnkyf3/feathers_in_the_attic_series_hub/) to find a chronological list of parts. Thank you!

The rain pounds down on the windshield, foaming at the corners of the glass as the rental’s wipers struggle to provide minimum visibility. I grip the steering wheel with freezing hands, leg muscles moaning as my foot assaults the gas pedal. Streaks of water run down my face, and I’m no longer sure if they’re sweat or tears.

Maybe both.

It’s been two hours since Jonah disappeared from his hospital room, and I’ve only just managed to slip away from the lazy night cops that were summoned to report the incident. They asked me some questions - almost all drug related - threatening some charges against Jonah if his test results were to come back positive for a local bath salt concoction. As soon as they let me go, I bolted for the car. 

There it is, the old sign, barely visible in the storm. *Welcome to Sparrow Mental Healing Center.* I don’t know how I’m going to fix any of this, but I know I can’t do it without Robin. It’s time for us to have the difficult conversations we’ve been avoiding, and it’s time for us to do a lot more than just talk.

The parking lot stands empty, apart from an old Toyota Camry. The building is almost entirely dark, abandoned-looking in the middle of the night, with just one dim light glowing from within the first floor. I run through the downpour, smashing into the front doors with the urgency of a mad woman. Miraculously, the doors give way, and I’m greeted by the eerie atmosphere of the center’s night-time lobby. Rain water drips off my frame as I walk past the abandoned reception island. One of the desktop computers is on - browser window open to Facebook - so I’m guessing the night shift person just stepped out for a bathroom break. 

I consider it good luck, not having to explain myself.

I try not to think of all this ending with me bound in a strait-jacket, Robin a floor down in the recovery wing,  Jonah gone. Unfortunately, the horror of these thoughts is a little too tangible for comfort, like a tight little ball of scratchy yarn sitting right in the pit of my stomach. After all, a getaway to this awful building is practically family tradition at this point.

I’m on the second floor already. The pain in my legs and body is nothing compared to the torment in my chest. Through all our troubles, through my resentment, through me pushing him away, through all the chaos in the past few weeks - Jonah has been there for me in ways no one else ever had. Now he is out there, somewhere, battling my monsters alone. It’s not right, and I have to fix it.

Room 208. 

Coincidence? Maybe.

I barge into Robin’s room, clawing at the nearest wall with the urgency of a feral cat. No way I want to face any more dark hospital rooms tonight, knowing that the monsters from our family home are no longer location bound. I feel an old-model light switch with the tips of my fingers and tug it down. A cold light fills the immaculate, empty hospital room.

“No,” I hear myself whine, hysteria rising in my throat as I run to the end of the room, throwing the second door open. The tiny bathroom is also empty. A powerful whiff of chlorine goes down with my next inhale, and I feel it stir more memories I am not willing to face. I step up to the sink and place both hands on the spotless basin frame. 

I look at my reflection in the mirror as light spills from the hospital room behind me, casting my face in shadows. I study my jet-black hair, wet and greasy, sticking to my temples in frizzy clumps of chaos. The potato nose I have spent a lifetime despising. My thin, quivering lips. My eyes, black as a crow’s beak, wide with terror and a pain far beyond the physical.

I have no idea what to do now. Knowing what I know, seeing what I’ve seen. It’s like an avalanche of puzzle pieces has dropped on my head, and I have no idea where to begin piecing it all together. My mother’s death. My father’s psychological and physical abuse. The terrors that happened every single night of my childhood. My escape from it all. Finding Jonah. Dad getting arrested. Leaving Jonah, coming back to this hell. Seeing it all again as an adult. Saving Robin. Reuniting with Jonah. Seeing my father again. Losing Jonah. Losing Robin.

Losing…

I feel a tingling at my fingertips, as though the thin coat of porcelain is sending tiny bolts of electricity into my body. I look down as I try to move my hands, heart sinking as I realize I no longer have control over my arms and legs. I don’t want to look back up. An invisible force tugs at my chin, working its way up like a finger gently but firmly guiding a kitten. I break out in cold sweat all over my body, desperate to fight with my thoughts where my actions have failed me. I try to shut my eyes, but my eyelids only break out in pins and needles.

A low chuckle escapes my own throat as two foreign eyes greet me in the mirror.

“Hello, Ava,”

The corners of my mouth crawl up my face, muscles aching as my petrified state resists the idea of actually smiling. The image in the mirror has all the right parts to look like me, but instead I’m faced with a stranger. Almost like a family member I’d never met, but who everyone claims I resemble. My adrenal gland pumps adrenaline into my paralyzed limbs, causing every cell in my body to burn with alarm.

“What are you?” I whisper inside my mind, still unable to move any part of my body except my eyeballs, which are starting to ache from not blinking for so long.

“What if I’m the one responsible for all of this?” a hoarse mockery of my own voice replies in the mirror, eyes ablaze with cruelty. “Don’t you think it’s time to come home and face the truth, Ava?”

“No,” I whimper in my mind, faced with the dire urge to burst into tears, but not having any physical outlet for these emotions. A tiny blood vessel pops in the corner of my right eye. “Please let me go.”

The thing inside me stares back in silence, before tearing my right hand from the sink. It all happens in an instant, and I have zero control as my own fingers wrap around my throat, and my head is thrown back with a sickening crack. I feel the tips of my rough, bitten fingernails scratch and dig into my skin. I see the ceiling above my head spin as more words slip through my suffocating throat.

“You know what I need. Every one of you has known it all along, and you never bothered to-”

There is a noise behind me.

The hold on my body goes as fast as it came, every muscle buckling at once as I fall to the ground, chin bumping the sink so hard that my teeth start to chatter as I gasp for air. The shooting pain in my eyes turns into a full blown migraine as I blink over and over again, trying to stir arid tear ducts into action. I’m an aching mess of a body, lungs wheezing, knees wobbly as I struggle to pull myself upright, completely forgetting the thing that ended my stupor.

It sounded like a door opening and closing.

My stomach sinks as I turn to see a small, elderly woman standing in the doorway, holding a gun with two shaking hands.

“Hey,” I gasp, hands raised above my head, palms open, “Please, I’m just here looking for my sister. Robin Fugler, she stayed in this room for weeks,” I croak, hitting my lower back on the sink as I attempted to make distance between myself and the woman. 

“Ava?” the woman asks, lowering her weapon as I study the wrinkles on her face, trying to latch onto something familiar. It’s a struggle. I don’t know this person.

“Yes,” I reply, letting my arms drop to my sides as the woman sets the gun aside. I don’t know much about guns, but it’s one of those long ones I’d seen hunters use, and it looks entirely barbaric propped up against a hospital room wall. Small towns, I think, trying to steady my breath. “Did my sister tell you about me?” I add, my voice weak and guttural. 

The woman doesn’t say anything, but her eyes search mine with unfounded severity. She stands in the brightest part of the room, harsh shadows lining her eyes like kohl. She is very small, maybe only about 5’4”, dressed in pristine, peach colored scrubs. Her dyed red hair is fixed in a low ponytail, and her two thin arms are drawn around her torso in self-embrace, as though she is shielding herself from the cold. Her expression is so grave, I feel a new shiver run through my already petrified limbs.

“My name is Linda, Linda Petersen,” the woman finally says, “I’ve been the night nurse at the center for over thirty years.”

It’s very hard to focus with how exhausted and scared I am, but the words do eventually sink in, slowly.

“Thirty years?” I exhale, “Does that mean?”

“I started my career around the time your mother was first a patient here,” she says, eyes narrowing as she shifts her weight awkwardly.

The silence between us is heavy and familiar. It is the silence of my childhood, filled with ghosts of conversations never spoken aloud. My body wants to go into self-preservation mode, to shut down and run away, to ask nothing. But I can’t play that game anymore. The demons have to come out.

“What was she like?” I ask as a starting point.

A pause as Linda’s face lights up with thoughts and ideas of her youth, “Anita was a wonderful woman,” the nurse’s eyes lose focus as she sinks into her memories, “It was difficult for me back then, being so young and gettin’ used to this place. Gettin’ used to some of the folks ‘round here. A lot of them were really sick and violent. I was put on night shifts quite early on an’ I had’ta start taking medication to soothe my nerves ‘cause I’d get so jumpy some nights. But your mother was the kindest person of all. A night owl like me, we’d share many cups of tea and play card games.”

Linda lingers in the past for a breath, before snapping back to the present and taking me in with a serious expression. I realize I’m probably mirroring the same exact face - or worse - back at her. 

“I don’t believe she was ever sick,” I choke out, my heart rate speeding up as I dart a nervous glance at the mirror behind me. It feels like I’ve said something I shouldn’t have.

Linda looks just as scared as I feel, “To this day I don’t quite understand what it was that went on with Anita,” she inhales sharply, “Don’t really think the doctors knew’ta well either. There were the episodes of course, an’ the delusions and all, but they weren’t like the other patients had, and they always faded away day by day after she was brought in. It would be every night at first, then a month would pass and she’d be just fine, and eventually they’d let her out. Then she’d be back within the month, and it would start all over again.”

Linda gestures me to follow her as she turns from the doorway and walks over to sit on what used to be Robin’s old hospital bed. I have a sudden urge to ask where my sister went, but I can’t pull my face away from the window into my mother’s past.

“The doctors tried every treatment on Anita,” Linda continues as we sit turned towards each other on the crisp sheets of the hospital bed, “Some of it horrible stuff, I still hate to think about. And I remember Anita always being so hopeful they would work. All she ever wanted was to go home’ta you girls. She missed ya’ll so much, and she couldn’t sleep because she was so worried about ya’ll being alone with your father,” Linda’s face turns dark, “We all knew that man was no good, but we couldn’t prove or do nothin’.” 

“Could you tell me about some of the episodes and delusions she had?”

At this, Linda’s face loses her color, and I notice her fingers knot in a tight clasp in her lap, “I’m not sure if I should say,” the nurse pauses, eyes running over my face, fearful, “It was so long ago and…”

“Please,” I whisper, forgetting how to breathe. 

“I would always find her on the bathroom floor near the sink, shaking or crying. I’d never actually seen an incident, but she claimed that… That she was possessed by a spirit. That the spirit wanted to hurt her. She would be covered in bruises or scratch marks, her eyes would be blood red. The doctors tried so many things, they’d cover up the mirror, they’d tie Anita to the bed, they’d keep all the lights on, they’d keep a watch guard, but somehow if it was the night it was supposed to happen - it would happen. Somehow she would end up in a bathroom somewhere in the building, beaten and crying on the floor. It was horrifying.”

I am crying as I see tears well in Linda’s eyes. She reaches her wrinkled fingers out to me, and I grab her hand with both of mine. I have only ever known a mother as a distant memory, but in this moment I feel united with her past self. To know we shared the same experiences, to know that none of us -Robin included - has ever been crazy, to know her strength. It’s overwhelming.

“You mentioned delusions?”

“Yeah,” Linda nods, “Normally this is quite common for folks ‘round here to experience, but with Anita it was just strange. She was convinced of something that everyone knew couldn’t possibly be true, but she was so sure of it and kept insisting it was the truth. It got to the point where police were called and told what she was saying, but nothin’ came of it. It just wasn’t real, but Anita seemed so sure about it. There were members of the staff that wondered if there was truth to it, knowing your father and all.” 

“What was she convinced of?”   
“Anita claimed there was a young boy trapped in the attic of your family home. She claimed your father trapped him there and that someone needed to let him out immediately. She was so worried about this boy, it would be all she could talk about when she was first admitted. Eventually the doctors would convince her the boy wasn’t real, but then she’d be back the next time as [adamant as ever](https://www.reddit.com/r/peculi_Dar/comments/vnkyf3/feathers_in_the_attic_series_hub/).”

okay so for some context, this isn’t a fake story and i’m just nervous about what happened yesterday. i’m a minor and me and my mom live with my grandma(my moms mom). 

during the summer, my mom spends most of her time at a campground with her boyfriend and some of her friends (this sounds bad but she’s a good person) and since school started, i’ve been at home while my mom was still at the campground. so i haven’t been able to see her much at all. 

she’s always been into spiritual stuff, and she can usually sense the presence of spirits, i highly doubt she’s making that up because i can too. she’s also really christian, she doesn’t go to church but she believes she has a special connection with god or something like that. 

my mom came back home from the campground for a few hours yesterday and she seemed different, not like herself. she found a monarch butterfly with a damaged wing so she very carefully put the wing back where it was supposed to go. a monarch butterflies only food source is milkweed, there’s a lot of that down my road so we decided to take the butterfly down there. 

i think it might be important to add that i live on a back road, i have 1 neighbor and maybe 3 cars go down that road per day, anyways back to the story. we get back in the car and my mom doesn’t start driving, which isn’t odd for her, but she wouldn’t stop talking about this abandoned house a few roads down. she said she had never seen the house till a few months ago but she never brought it up, but she would have definitely told me about that kind of discovery. it’s weird that she had not seen the house considering she lived on the same road her whole life.

i didn’t feel like listening to her talk about for the rest of the night soo i told her that i’m okay with us driving down there. when we get there, there’s a sign that says “private property” and “no trespassing”. so that obviously mad me not want to go any further. my mom told me about how she got good vibes from one side of the house and bad vibes from the other. she was bringing me to the bad side. she told me to tell her if i felt anything. i did feel something. it was from her. negative energy. from my mom. i doubt everyone reading this believes in this kind of stuff but you should.

when we’re walking, i stopped because i didn’t want to follow my mom closer to the house, i was getting a bad feeling about it and i knew it was time to leave. she kept repeating for me to follow her and what she wanted me to see and feel was right up closer to the house, i couldn’t see there because the house had a ton of weeds by it. when i kept refusing she got mad at me, and she rarely ever gets mad at me. she tried dragging me some.

when i finally convinced her to leave, she didn’t say anything about the house when we got off that road.

idk if this is odd but lmk what you think.

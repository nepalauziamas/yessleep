Hey everybody. You probably don't know me but I'm a local detective in a small town in the English countryside.  Recently I was given a case regarding 6 individuals who over a week disappeared. I found one buried under a river, one in a fox den and one in a quarry. The other three are yet to be found. 

It is a more major case than usual but it's not anything that scares me. Well until yesterday. 

I woke up from a nap almost buried in my papers and evidence when I heard a knock on my door. I answered it to find the body of one of the missing kids, one we already discovered. How was it here, who left it, how do they know where I live. I was flooded with worry and questions when one of my two kids came to me to see what was happening and saw the body. 

We were at the station with our kids asleep and they took ME in for questioning. It was stupid and unnecessary, I didn't do anything. 

I was let off and had a new spark to finish the case, I hadn't slept in three days and spent it all on the job when I passed out at work. 
I once again woke up at the office when something else happened. This time there was fish, hundreds of fish dropped through a smashed window into the police station. After observing them we found out they were rainbow trout, they were only really found in the river where we found the first body. We were being messed with, I was being targeted. 

Pherensics got back later that morning, the fish contained DNA of the first dead kid, they had fed on her skin and such while she was down in the river. 

How does this shit keep happening, every time I go to sleep, the killer is targeting me.  Since that day, 4 days ago now I have fallen asleep once and I woke up to nothing. I thought I was safe, I thought I was in the clear. That was when the call came in. My boss rang me in the late hours of the evening feeling refreshed and happy, she told me a body was found after getting an anonymous tip. The body of the missing kid was in a suitcase, all crushed up. 

The suitcase was found in a field of tall grass that had already been searched and cleared. I went to the field and found the ground stained with blood, not from the kid but from dead cows, left with gashes in their stomach. It was disgusting. 


3 days ago I fell asleep again. This time somebody attacked my home, I rushed there as quick as I could from the cafe that I fell asleep in. When I got there everything was smashed but that didn't matter all that mattered was my family. 
I went into the garden and was horrified by what I saw. All 6 kids and my wife and two kids were in the garden. Medieval execution devices were left out with my family in them and the dead kids were placed in positions recreating an execution scene. I went on my phone tapping 999 frantically with shivering fingers when I got a voice message from an unknown number. A voice said 

" do not call the police, tap call and they all die. Or slumber caused this didn't it haha, the chase has just begun with a bang " it read. 

I was pissed, I rang 999 he was bluffing, I pressed the ring and then I heard a scream. And then another and then another. They were all dead, the blood was on me. It was awful. I sat on my knees crying until backup came. I was comforted and allowed off the case, even though it didn't matter the freak wanted me. 

The next day I went to the office to collect my stuff when I was asked to see my boss. I went in to see a stern, upset face. She said pherensics found DNA on the suitcase, my DNA, she said it shouldn't be there and asked if I had tampered with evidence, I hadn't done. I wore gloves while examining it. She let me off the hook for the day while I am in grief but I'm a suspect. She thinks I went mad, thinks I killed the kids and my family's death was a punishment from somebody. 





There was a letter on my doorstep, the killer was messing with me, there were pictures, personal pictures of my mother in the envelope and a piece of stained paper saying sweet dreams, I can't sleep or I know what would happen, I had to think of something I couldn't stay in the town I packed a suitcase and ran, as far as I could, I had a bag of cash, I got a train ticket and planned to escape from my hellish scenario. 



I'm writing this on the train, I'm not saying where I'm going or where I came from, nobody knows I left but I fear for my life and others' lives, I haven't gone to sleep in a few days. Please help me.

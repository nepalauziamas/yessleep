 

My wife is not a bad person, if she was, I wouldn’t be caught dead in the same room with her, (pun not intended) never mind consider getting back together with her. I know she loves me, and I certainly love her, why wouldn’t I, we had many happy years together, and feelings don’t go away just because you want them to. Besides it’s not entirely her fault, when I left, it was a really bad time for her, well, for both of us, I suppose that’s why I ran away. I did regret it eventually, but by then it was too late, she was too far gone and wanted me dead. It eats away at me knowing things could have been different if I wasn’t such a coward and tried to help her. But I am, and I have to live with that for the rest of my life, maybe if I went back and tried, I thought I might not feel so guilty all the time. 

I have been on the run for a while now, never staying in one place too long, and used a different name every time, but she still kept finding me, I have no idea how. The last time was by far the worst, she actually got into my room while I was sleeping, I would have never known she was there if she hadn’t dropped the syringe and woke me up. It was so fucked up she had a rope, a big bag to put me in even a trolley to carry me out of there. The weirdest thing about it was she didn’t even care when I found her, she said she was only trying to take me home where I belonged. I know I probably should have gone to the cops from the beginning, but I thought she was my only chance of redemption.  

After that I thought I would beat her at her own game, so I did a little bit of investigating on my own; I found out she was staying in a hotel a few blocks up. Apparently, she had been asking all over town about me, this time I was one step ahead of her, I laid a trail of breadcrumbs so she would end up exactly where I wanted her to be. I started off by using an alias that I used before and became a regular in a couple of hot spots in town where I thought she might inquire about me. Usually, I kept to myself and when I went out, I tried not to go to the same place too often, so they wouldn’t remember me. This time I became quite the chatter box, I told them my whole life story, even where I lived, here is the smart part; I gave this homeless guy, Bob, money to rent out a room and switched with him, no one was any wiser, and the best thing about it was outside my window there was a fire escape just in case something went wrong. 

My plan was simple, while she was breaking into my motel room looking for me, I would break into hers and see what she was up to. Everything was going well, I watched her talking to the waitress in the diner that I had become a regular in from across the street, so I knew she would come for me that night, and she did. Just after midnight I saw her leave the hotel in a little white van that she probably rented out just to kidnap me. I then went to the desk and told them I was her husband, and wanted to surprise her, which they believed, I had ID to prove it.  

I was just about to open the room door when I heard a woman's voice, I was so confused, I knew it wasn’t my wife. But just to make sure I put my ear up to the door and listened for a while, I heard a woman singing some sort of lullaby, then the unmistakable sound of my sons' laughter. I probably should have walked right in there and taken my son, but again I failed to do the right thing and chickened out. Taking him from her would have put me in a lot more danger, but it would have been the best thing for everyone, especially my son, my wife was too far gone to do anything for herself never mind do what needed to be done for him. 

That night I was too freaked out to go back to the motel, so I decided to sleep in the car in an old car park, but every time I closed my eyes all I could see was my son's face, as I walked out that door for the last time. Then it all hit me, and I realized everything was my fault. Before I left, she was really struggling, I didn’t even need her to tell me that, I could see it in her every day. What did I do, run the first sign of trouble, up until then I thought I had the moral high ground by looking for a way to forgive her. The truth is I am the one that needed forgiveness. I made my decision there and then to do whatever it took to make things right, but I knew I couldn’t do it alone.  

When I first left my family, I was very emotional, I had no money, nowhere to live and was living in a strange land, still trying to make since of what happened. So, I turned to the church for guidance in hopes they might absolve me of my sins, but when I told them what had happened, they tried to convince me to return to my family and try remedy the situation, they even offered the services of the church, but I wasn’t ready and they didn’t pressure me, they even let me stay there as long as I wanted. I don’t know why I didn’t accept their help; I suppose it was just one more thing I ran away from.   

I went back to the motel to get my things and to find the number of that church, but first I went to say goodbye to Bob. When I got to his room the door was open, so I went inside. There was blood on the floor and the whole place was a mess, but he was nowhere to be seen. I then realized I had made a horrible mistake; I never took into account what would happen when she found out it wasn’t me in that motel room. 

Bob might have had problems with alcohol and fucked up his life over it, but he had a good heart and was one of the gentlest people I ever met. That was the last straw, I knew I had to do something fast before it was too late for poor bob, so I went back to her hotel. I still had a key, so I let myself in, but there was no one there. I noticed a sheet was missing from one of the beds and when I looked closely, I saw a bloody handprint on the corner of the mattress.  

I panicked and got out of there as fast as I could before someone saw me, unfortunately as I was walking through reception the guy behind the counter recognized me, “If you are looking for your wife sir, she left” he said in a snooty tone. 

“I’m sorry” I replied, “did she say where she was going? I never got a chance to catch up with her last night.” 

“Home of course”  

“Did she say anything else?” 

“I am sorry sir, all she said was she got what she needed and was going home. Now if you don’t mind me saying, if you have trouble keeping track of your wife's comings and goings, maybe you should be talking to her about it.” 

Going home was the last thing I ever wanted, after what happened there, I still have nightmares to this day, but I had no choice, besides it was time to face up to my responsibilities, and I was sick of running away from my problems. I knew it wouldn’t be easy seeing my son again, after walking out the way I did that day, I was sure he knew I had used him as an excuse for leaving. Before he was born everything was perfect, my wife was happy all the time and we barely fought, when he arrived everything changed, and my life became a living hell, but I know now I was selfish and only thought about me while ignoring their cries for help and ran away at the first sign of trouble, leaving my wife to pick up the pieces when I was gone, no wonder she cracked. 

On my way home I rang the church and told them what had happened. Thankfully they still wanted to help, and they organized people from my local church to assist me. The whole drive back I tried to go over everything in my head and make some sort of plan, but I had no idea what to expect when I got there, so I started to freak and by the time I arrived I wasn’t thinking straight.  

I was supposed to wait for help, but I had grown impatient and thought I could handle it on my own. I don’t know how, but she was expecting me, the door was wide open, and she was sitting in the living room with my son in her arms. I admit, I was relieved there was some sort if barrier between us, but I still kept my distance and didn’t stray too far from the front door.  

I felt so awkward, both of them were silently staring at me smiling, my wife didn’t even blink the whole time. I tried talking to her and promised I would stay and help this time, but she didn’t react, she just stared blankly, for a moment I thought she was dead, and started walking over to her. Then I noticed her eyes follow me and I froze on the spot, I suddenly heard the door slam and looked back to see what it was, the next thing I knew I was on the floor struggling to breathe, with my wife’s hands around my neck, I thought that was it for me, I could feel my whole body go weak, then I blacked out. 

I woke up in a hospital bed two days later, with no idea how I got there. When I asked the nurse, she said they found me lying down outside the door, after someone had made an anonymous phone call alerting them. I wanted to sign myself out immediately, but they wouldn’t even let me out of bed, besides I don’t think I would have got far, I could barely stand up. I spent the next few days lying in bed thinking, hoping it was not too late for Bob, and I still had no idea who took me to the hospital, I thought if it were someone from the church surely, they wouldn’t have just left me like that. I tried calling the church, but they kept giving me the runaround, I even tried my wife's phone, but it rang out the first few times, then it stopped ringing completely.

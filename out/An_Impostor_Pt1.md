Hello
In case you are reading this i want u to listen very closley, whatever you do u have to read this for your own safety (in case u ever encounter one of these).


The other day me(21y old male) and few buddys of mine (19 20 23 all males) went to lake that is pretty far away from our town and is in woods. 



We rented a cabine that had 4 beds (2 bunk beds in 2 seperate rooms). It was pretty big (1 big living room whit big fireplace and on 2nd floor 2 bedrooms. 


We came to cabine whit my buddies truck (Big Ford truck that is huge and made to be able to go off-road), we packed bunch of things: food, water, towels, flashlights flares few big power banks etc. and for some reason one of my buddies decided to bring a gun (not a small gun, but rather a big ass bolt action sniper whit huge calibar, termal scope and even a flashlight ,his father  apparantley got it from military service), he said that it is because of bears etc. (but we encounterd something even worse than bears). Two of my friends even brought in their dogs (german shepard and rotwiler), as i understood them they wanted to catch a deer for us to eat one night (we were supposte to stay there for entire week). 


We packed everything (one of my friends even brought in a revolver in case of a close range encounter whit bear/bears whitouth telling anyone).


We packed and went to woods, when we arrived we settled down and we were chilling, swimming, messing around etc. (1st day was very calm as well as 2nd and 3rd). 


Then on 4th day we wanted to go to cach a deer, we  got sniper and revolver and we were ready (the guy that got sniper was in military as a sniper soldier so he knew what he was doing) and i got the revolver (we were armed enought to kill bear ). 


We slowly went to forest looking for deer, needless to say that we found one and it was a big one (around 125 KG, 275lbs), he shot and killed it, we tied it to a branch that we previously got and we started carying it to cabine.


 We took off skin and did everything that we had to (burry the insides and gave what we coud to dogs). We got everything ready and i was supposte to watch out for fire, my other 2 buddys (20 and 22) were making sallad and getting everything ready. I noticed that  we will need more wood, i asked my buddy (19 y old, we will call him Johnny) to go and get more branches. I gave him a flashlight and asked him if he wants to bring a dog whit him (i even asked other guys can he borrow one of their dogs and they told him to go for it), he declined the offer and said that he doesnt want to bother the dogs to walk after an entire day of hiking thru forest. He went into woods. Aroud half an hour passed (i already went a little bit away and scraped enough wood to keep the fire going until he comes back). 



Another half an hour passes and Johnny is not back and we were already thinking that bear or something attacked him. The 20y old (we will call him Mark, he is the one that brought sniper) offered to take his dog (Trained ex military german sheppard and to go looking for him). He got ready and we even gave him Johnys towel to give to the dog to smell and find Johny but before they coud start going Johhny appeard whit bunch of branches but he was diffrent, something seemed a bit off (i coudnt tell right at the moment, but i coud see that he was acting a bit diffrent). We got the fire and started eating a deer (we gave bones and little bit of meat to the dogs and they enyoed it) and then i saw it Johnny was eating so agressivly. I indicated to my friend Mark how Johnny was eating (just for info Johnny was a person that ate very little and very slowly and calmly, like an old man) but this was not Johnny we knew. I said im full and that im going to bed. I went to my and Marks bedroom and took my phone (i had no reception or very bad reception), i started writing this as a document and slowly added to it as i observed Johnnys behaviour. 


When we went to sleep i made sure that Johnny was sleeping and spoke to Mark. I told him what i noticed and he told me that he saw same thing but coudnt tell me so Johnny doesnt notice. We got our clothes on (military like clothes that can help u blend in whit sorroundings in forest) flashlight, flare, revolver and sniper. We slowly made our way out and as we were going into woods i looked and window and i thought i saw Johnny staring at us, now idk if it is was just my imaginaton but the grin on his face and the way he looked at me tells me that it was real and that was not Johnny we knew. We slowly went into woods and that is when i noticed it was like we were going in circles (i saw same rock few times). I told Mark and he said that it is possible but unlikely and then is when i saw it, i saw cave and we went into it, now i know it was a bad move. 


We slowly entered whit Mark using his termal scope to see if something is around (at this moment i regreted we didnt brought night vision glasses). We slowly walked when mark stoped me and wispered "there is something either hibernating or dying in here" i was terryfied, was he speaking about an animal? but no bears dont hibernate at summer, they do it in winter. I took flashlight and turned it on and scene shocked us, it was mark litteraly hanging, whit his limbs half-eaten and he was barley breathing. We asked him if he was okay and he only thing he told was "Run, he-he-hee is not mmmm-eeee" and then whit i whoud say last of his breaths he said "Run" and before you knew it we saw something huge, like a bear but not a bear, charging toward us. We shot it a few times and then we started runing as fast as we coud, as we started runing we lit a flare and it was scary there wasnt 1 but rather more than 20 of them around us. As we made our way to the cabine we saw 2 Flashlights and heard dog barking. 


Johhny (or better to say his doppelganger) and our 22 y old friend (we will call him Frank) were runing towards us and just stopped, dogs started squelling and litteraly stoped and hid behinde them (german shepard was trained to take down a person and never to be scared and rotwiler was very protective as well but they hid behinde Frank (this is important to say, they didnt come near Johnny and acted unconfortable and wierd around him since that night whit deer). 


As we came close my friend pulled revolver out of my hand and pointed it at Johhnys head. Johhnys doppelganger acted terryfied and started speaking like a crackhead (something Johhny whoud never do) and then it hit Frank as well. He said he acted wierdly and Johhny stormed off back to cabine while we spoke. 


While we were going back we noticed strange, very strange wolf following us. I turned and pointed my flashlight at it and my gun as well and wolf stood still, it acted like it knew i wont shoot it. As we continued wolf dissapeard. We told Frank what we saw and he wanted to see. Johhny was already waiting for as acting all mad for us accusing him of being one of those creatures. Next day we wanted to go whit Truck but we found out that someone ripped tires (and very precisley, just enought so it is undrivable, whit very big precisio). I feel like the same thing that took Johhny and was now acting like him did this. 


Next day we went to the cave we found Johnnys body and NOTHING, there was nothing, only a patch of blood and few organs thst looked like those from deer. Frank freaked out and said that he wants to go back to cabine bcuz he was geting sick just by looking at it. We went back to cabine and sat down and spoke. 

We were terryfied knowing that creatures (Johhny) maybey found out what we had on our minds.


At some point at nitght (around 3 am) we woke up to Frank screaming and trowing things. We ran there just to see Frank and Johhny trowing things at a deer thst was on the branch next to their opened window. Frank swears he closed window. Were suspecting that "Johhny" left window opened and called that "Thing" to come inside, but most intresting part is that it had burned out fire ashes spread all over its body and head. Is this a thing that broke the trap?. We tried to fix the tire but it is impossible. Somehow we coud call someone to bring us tire but we have to wait until moday (3 more days), whit "Johnny" and his "Friends". We endded up blocking all windows in the house and we started putting traps on stairs that head towards to our rooms out of fear.


I started sleeping whit revolver right next to me and that one night it hit me. I heard tapping on our door, i wass terryfied, then i heard door opening. I slowly peaked out of under my blanket to see Johhny staring right at me, he wasnt looking like he wanted to kill me/us but he was staring right in me, like he was staring directly in my soul. 
I huged my revolver tightly but fear took over and i coundt even count on my gun, i was completly unarmed. Then my friends dog (the rotwiler) appeard and started acting wierdly towards Johhny (he still thought i was asleep). And i saw dog trying to bite him, Johhny went out of room and i heard dog squelling. I tried falling asleep and i did (for a few minutes)


Afer what it seemed like half an hour we heard Johnny screaming. I ran out of the room whit my gun and i saw Johhny "crying" saying that the "Thing" broke into cabine and took one of the dogs. We were terryfied.


I ended up starting to lock our room doors and my friends german shepard (we will call dog Rex) in the room whit us out of fear of those creatures trying to break in again. 


One night we woke up to Rex squelling. I thought it wanted to go to bathroom. I unlocked door and Rex hid under bed. I slowly opened the door and what i saw shocked me, it was Johnny opening door and going out. I slowly made my way down the stairs and i saw Johhny or the thing that acted like him runing towards something and digging. I coudnt see what was that at the moment bcuz it was dark but it looked like he was eating something, then he turned whit biggest psychopatic grin at his face and i saw it. It was blood and in hands he holded something that appeard to be raw meat. I even think he saw me but i didnt care at this point i slowly made my way back to the room and acted like i saw nothing. I coudnt fall asleep that night.


Nest morning i spoke to Mark about what i saw last night. Needless to say that he was even more terryfied than me. Johhny even started acting wierd around me (like he knew that i was the one that seen him that night). Im slowly going nuts.


We currently have to wait 2 more days but Johhny became overly agressive and is starting to act wierdly, i think that that "thing" wants to finish us before its too late, it even acts wierdly around Rex. I've noticed that Rex acts very concerned and scared around Johnny. I feel like he will strike tonight , that is the reason why am i writing this. In case that i dont write again they probably got either me or all of us. Wish us best of luck.

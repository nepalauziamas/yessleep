The title of this story provides little context into what I'm trying to say, so I'll get straight to the point. There are things and phenomenon out there that we just can't explain. Our limited three-dimensional minds can't comprehend the vast expansion of multiple dimensions and the power of our imaginations. Let me tell you that the monsters in our imagination are real. The things we cook up in our stories are breathed into life by the mere creation of them in our minds.

As a fan of the paranormal and horror genre, I've read my fair share of stories, hell I've written a few myself. I considered myself an enthusiast of fictional horror stories for a long time, until I discovered that they were actually non-fictional.

We spent some time during our summer vacation out in the woods of Michigan, outside of Grand Rapids. By we, I mean myself and a small group of friends. Their identities don't feature much in the story, so I won't waste the time in introducing you to their backgrounds. We thought it'd be a great idea to do an overnight Ouija Challenge in the woods, something I implore you not to do. After some time goofing around and when the hour was right, we threw ourselves into the challenge. We set up the candles and Ouija Board and got on with it. We contacted something.

"Who are you" one of us asked. We waited. The planchette started moving: "Y-O-U K-N-O-W."

"If we know, why don't you identify yourself?"

The planchette started moving again: "D-E-M-I-S-E."

We gasped and cracked up, whatever this entity is, it had a sense of humor. "Are one of you idiots moving the planchette?" I asked. "No" they all responded. "There's no way you really exist!" I exclaimed. Demise was a Creepy Pasta we had invented at one of our previous camp fire hang outs.

"I... D-O... I...A-M...C-O-M-I-N-G." \~ "Gross! we all laughed out loud."

"Alright , it's been real, goodbye!" - We ended the session because I couldn't control my laughter and nothing more happened. We packed everything up and decided to sit around the fire and goof around before bed. Nothing else happened for the rest of the night and we ended up heading home the next day."

Fast-forward a week and things started getting weird. I'm awoken every morning at the same time, 02:33 am. I have dry-mouth like something chronic and a splitting headache every time this happens. Strange. On the second night, I headed down stairs to the kitchen to grab a glass of water. Careful not to make a noise as my family all slept peacefully upstairs. As I drank I stared out the window into the dark boundaries of the forest line behind my house. There was movement. I stared in confusion and with some curiosity. After some time scanning the tree-line, I saw something that chilled me to the bone. A face. In the tree-line. How can that be? The person would have to be at least 8-feet tall! The events of the previous week's shenanigans came flooding back, "could it be?..." I ran back upstairs and tried to quell the pain and get some sleep. These events would happen every night like clockwork.

Last night it happened again. I didn't go downstairs. I peaked through the blinds down into the tree line. This time, the figure stepped forward, illuminated by our porch light. "It's him!" I gasped. There he was in all his terrifying glory. 8-Feet tall, slender and with a featureless face save for two glowing white eyes, as if they'd been poked into his face. "It's him!" I gasped again breaking down into a panic. "How can it be, there's absolutely no way this can be real!" He must've heard my thoughts because he tilted his head upwards and looked in my direction. My head was pounding now, I could feel my heartbeat in my brain. Each night he seems to get closer to the house and I have no idea when he'll make it inside. I'm going to have to leave my home, I'm going to have to get away but I know he'll find me. I've checked in with my friends and none of them have seen him. Am I going mad or is he targeting me for laughing at him?

Whatever the reason, I'm terrified of what might become. I'm certain that Demise and all the monsters we dream up exist in an alternative reality or dimension and we opened up a gateway to allow him access to this plane. He's picked a target and it's me. Whatever you do folks, don't play with Ouija Boards and stop reading and writing creepy pastas. We're inventing and creating the monsters in alternate realities and it is only time before someone as stupid as me unleashes them on this world.

I'll try and keep you posted on what happens next. Wish me luck!

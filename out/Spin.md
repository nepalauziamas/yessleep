“**Good evening. This is your Captain speaking. We are expecting turbulence ahead. Buckle in and hold on tight.**”

I should have known we were fucked from the jump. My gut sensed something off in that announcement. Maybe the inflection on ‘buckle.’ Maybe the gulp after ‘hold on tight.’ The other passengers caught it too. They eyed each other nervously. Then the plane lurched forward.

“**Turn off the intercom.**”

I never would have flown on my own if my boss didn’t insist on his yearly ‘team-building’ exercises. That thought ran through my mind like a marathon runner. I hated air travel. I was scared of heights. I couldn’t even bear to look out the window. But that’s just life, sometimes, you know? You don’t get to go back and pull yourself out of the wrong place and wrong time. You just have to live with it. 

**Switch the fucking engine, Gill.**

The plane dipped. The luggage chutes opened. Oxygen masks deployed. People screamed. A man held on tightly to his daughter. The woman next to me started to pray. I didn’t recognize the religion, or the language, but it felt fitting given the circumstances. I joined her.

“**We’re diving. We are diving, Gill.**”

I prayed for my mom. I prayed for my sisters. I prayed for all of the friends and family who would have to bury a box without a body. I never planned to die so young. The thought never entered my mind. But in the moment, it felt right, you know? Like it was my time. Like it always meant to go that way. Thousands of feet above the ground without a single loved one by my side.

“**Spin it, Gill, spin the fuckin’ thing!**”

My environment became a tornado of body parts and broken plates. The drink cart slipped out of the arms of a screaming hostess in first class. The momentum of the spins took it into the air. Hundreds of pounds of hulking metal hurdled across the cabin like a battering ram. Eventually it connected with an older man in Coach. His face exploded on impact. 

Another stomach wrenching spin brought it back around.

“**One more! Hold it there, Gill, spin! SPIN!!**”

Just as suddenly as the action started, it stopped, though the screams certainly did not. The drink cart fell and landed in the aisle. The astray luggage dropped and hit passengers in the aisle seats. The stewardesses got up and quickly attended to the chaos. I counted at least five bodies that didn’t move. 

“*Hello?*”

I tried to speak and the words came out all wrong. I put my hand to my head and when it came back, it was soaked with blood. I didn’t remember getting hit.

“*Sir?*”

“*Are we still in the air?*”

“*Yes.*"

“*Where am I?*”

"*I'm afraid I don't know that.*"

I heard the stewardess’s voice but couldn’t see her face. My waning attention fixated on a point across the cabin. Most of the folks shut their side windows at the start of this mess. But one of them remained open. All the way at the end. At the bottom of it, a light shone through. Something about that light drew me like a moth to flame. 

“*Do you need medical attention?*”

I un-clicked the seatbelt and got up out of my chair. 

“*Sir? Are you a doctor?*”

I edged past the misshapen pile on my right and pushed into the aisle. The light reflected a rainbow of sorts on the opposing wall. But the colors were all wrong. 

“*Sir. I’m going to have to ask that you sit down.*”

I leaned over the dead body in the aisle seat. The other two were empty. A cold, wrinkled hand grabbed my shoulder just as I reached for the small plastic frame holding back those beautiful strands of light. I shrugged her back.

“*SIR!*”

I heard a commotion as she fell. I didn’t care. I just wanted to see the light. That sweet, beautiful, magnificent light. I had never seen anything like it. I pulled back the window shade. A symphony of blues of grays and pinks erupted through the cabin. My skin felt alive, like every pore opened, like every disease disappeared in an instant. People gasped at the beauty of the moment. All of them.

And then they started to scream. 

An older gentleman got up from his seat and held his chest. He moved towards the restroom and collapsed halfway. Another man rushed to his side. An elderly woman screamed for her sister. Children bawled and howled uncontrollably. I looked down at my own hands, just to take in the light, and that’s when it hit me. 

These weren’t my hands.

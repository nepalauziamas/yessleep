It was the the end of summer, everyone in my school came back tired and worn out. Well everyone except for me. 

I had an incredible holiday, watching motivational speakers, experiencing nature, and getting a detoxification from phone, I was fresh and awake. However, my parents were busy, all summer they were dealing with work. This was no problem for me, as I could easily entertain myself, the aftermath was the problem. My parents were burnt out and couldn't drive me to school anymore, for a month at least. So I started taking the bus.

It was all going well in the start, I was talking in the morning to go to school, and I was taking in the afternoon to go home. I had to be punctual and ready for the bus, but I have no problem with that. One day in particular the teachers dismissed us a little later from class than usual, so I rushed out of the school but the bus was still there. Thank God.

I entered and saw no other students there and figured they were late too. My friend, who shares the same bus as me, wasn't here. It's only natural, we called in sick and couldn't make it. I waited in the bus for  two minutes until three other students entered. I didn't recognize them but it was only because I don't pay attention to the people in the bus. I will always be on my phone listening to music and texting my friends. 

Another 5 minutes wait and we were off. We were traveling for a good 17 minutes, I was asleep and listening to music, until I received a text on my phone. It was from my mom.

"Boy, where are you it's already 5pm?" My mom asked.

I texted back.

"On the way my bus was delayed, but luckily I was late so I will be arriving late," I replied.

"What do you mean your bud already passed here and I wanted to know why you weren't on," My mom replied.

An unsettling feeling filled my stomach.

I then thought back to when I entered. I didn't see the school logo, it took a long time for only three students too show up, was the driver the one I saw everyday? I looked in front. The happy and cheerful  smile he had in the front mirror wasn't there. He wasn't even wearing school clothing. The bus was a dark gray, not the normal bright yellow. The two other kids also had a worry expression. I knew in an instant. I have to get out of here now.

The bus then pulled up to a old run down  warehouse outside of town next to it was a huge forest. It was a small town so I knew the whole area, but this area was unfamiliar to me. Suddenly the driver told us to get out and follow the men outside. I was scared, no terrified. I needed to find some way to escape. I got out of the bus and followed the men. They led us into the warehouse and locked the main exit. They told us to stay put or else. I was trembling. The two other boys were whispering to each other while crying. I had no time to worry about that. I looked around the place and saw a blanket on the wall. I approached it and realized it was a hole in warehouse. Without another thought I rushed through. I heard the men yelling at me to come back, but I ignored them. I ran out of the warehouse and ran pass the metal barb wire. I ran for an estimate of 10 minutes following the main path. I finally recognized a convenience store I would go to with my cousin. I knew where I was. I sprinted along the path until I reached my house. When I reached my backyard I checked my phone. 

20 text messages from mom

4 missed calls from mom

I quickly knocked on my house door and when it opened, there stood my mom with the police in tears. I explained to my mom and the police what happened. I vividly described the warehouse and the surroundings. They launched an investigation. 

1 yearlater I had started to go and come back from school by car with my parents. I am now 13 and will never ever forget that traumatic event. I am paying better attention to my surroundings and will never take a bus again. I was incredible lucky.

Ok so, this happened about 3 hours ago and i am completely disturbed. I recently have been watching a lot of reddit stories narrations and etc and was wondering if it'be cool to have a story to tell here, but now that i have a story i can feel even more sad for all the people who told their awful experiences in life

Anyway, since i won't be sleeping tonight (Its 3am Brazil time) let me tell you what happened

At the end of the afternoon i went to my girlfriend's place

Her mother bought bread, ham and cheese and so we ate that while i watched my gf play South Park the Stick of Truth

It was only the three of us in the house along with the one dog and four cats and everything was just fine

The dog has more than 18 years old and because of that they leave the front door slighly opened so that she can pee outside at night

By 9pm everyone started feeling sleepy already since my girlfriend and her mother had worked that day and they have a very early shift in the same company and i had woken up early to do some stuff at home since it was my day off work, so we went to sleep

Me and my gf on her room, and my mother in law on her own room on the other side of the house

I am kinda of traumatised with sleep paralysis, to the point where there were some times where if i watched something scary on the internet, the back of my head would feel weird and i would just simply freeze until i got the strenght to take it out the screen (yeah it sucks)

And that means that i wake up a lot of times in the night with whatever random noise i hear, mostly nothing happening

However, tonight was different

I don't now what i heard, but something made me wake up, and as i look in front of the bed, the way our feet went, i saw a shadowy figure that was moving really close to us

I felt those paralysis chills, but i could move, so this didn't felt like a dream

I shaked my gf and as she woke up, she also saw the figure, and thats where i realized this wasn't no dream allucination or any shit like that

The thing started to move outside to the yard, but it didn't move fast nor bumped into anything, it really felt like it calmly walked outside

So i chased it, because here in Brazil we dont actually have a yard, i dont know the right word for it but picture the houses like this:

-Big gate and wall that usually have something that makes it hard for anyone to jump
-An open space where you can leave your car or in some cases put on clothes to dry with sunlight
-The front door of the house and the inside

My girl's house dont have a car in it

That meant that however had entered would have trouble getting out

So i had some things in mind at this time

If the person who entered had a weapon of some sort it wouldnt had just run outside and what is even crazier is that in order to get to the room we were sleeping the invader had to get through the kitchen and could have taken a knife

But even with that i chased slowly, since i realized that no one had jumped the walls and the gate made no sound

It was really dark outside, the street lights dont really enter here, and i was shaking, had chills, and all kinds of fear symptons while i had to look for the invader

I heard some weird noises coming from a wooden wardrobe door that there is here in the yard (it was being used to make a bed taller but recently the bed got changed so we put it outside until we found a way to get rid of it without simply throwing in the street)

By that time i was 100% certain that the person was hiding behing the door, but i wouldnt get close in fear of being stabbed or anything, since by that time i didnt even see the face of the intruder

My gf got a knife and i stood in front while her and her mother stayed behind me trying to talk this person out of the hiding spot, but we would simply get no answer even after we saw a hand on the side of the wardrobe door

My brother in law appeared in the window with his son and i asked if everyone in their home was inside, in which they confirmed so

There were so much going on i really dont know how i didn't freak out, and suddendly, the door started moving

The invader was revealed to be a woman, and the first thing i noticed is that she was wearing my girlfriend's Haikyuu volleyball uniform shirt

That felt really weird and i did not wanted to accept the truth that if that woman was wearing her shirt, it means that she has been in the room with us for a while, because the shirt was somewhere inside the wardrobe

The wardrobe stays of the left side of the bed, and the one side i sleep on, so she probably have gotten really close to me and even changed her clothes before i woke up

She started talking: "Calm down, please, let me explain everything to you"

And then everyone went quiet and let her talk, i was so in shock that i cant remember the exact words she said but it went something like

"I received a message and i dont know that it means, but a guy named 'Guilhermem blablabla' said that i need to find a child named Dan"

Dan is the name of my brother in law who's a fully grown man, and everyone supposed that someone has said his name in the heat of the moment and she tried using that to calm things down

The only child there was his son, who she could have seen in the window

She then proceeded saying that some guys from another state have brought her here to find him, but she didn't knew why

As we realized her story didn't made any fucking sense at all and she was trying to walk out of it, we kicked her out of the house, because everyone was just so in shock that we just wanted her out

I mean look at the situation, she walks in, wear different clothes when she could have taken a lot more, like a laptop and cellphones and then starts saying random bullshit

When she got out of the hiding spot we even realized she was holding a bag in which we throw the pet's poop

She then got out and vanished in the dark streets

After that we called the police because my brother in law security camera had filmed her, but they never arrived

And so we started talking about what just happened and boy that was weird

Turns out my mother in law had forgot to lock the gates at night and, as i said, the front door stays a little bit open so the dog can get out to pee or something

After tonight though, we'll have to do something to teach her do pee inside on a place just for that at least at night

My gf mother said that she heard someone walking in the dark, but she tought it was me

So then she walked to the opened door of our room and asked if it was me, and she said i replied with "yeah i went to get water"

With that she got back to her room because she tought it was actually me, and now im wondering, how did that woman got away with faking my voice?

Im a dude with a some kind of deep voice when im sleepy

She probably even got beside me to talk that so the way the voice comes from makes sense

I went looking for this guilherme's channel (i wont say the actual name of the channel for now because i dont know, its my first reddit post in life you know)

His channel didn't have much views and stopped posting videos 7 years ago, his videos were mostly about him playing guitar

Some of the videos had comments about a woman looking for him, aparently because she was pregnant or something, but in case y'all are wondering, i dont think that is the same woman that invaded our house

And now im here awake while my girlfriend and mother in law finally slept

It is 4am, its raining and i still fear that the woman will come back, so i figured that i'll keep watching for noises until they wake up to work again at

I had to tell this story because all od my friends already went to sleep so i kinds have no one to talk now, yknow?

Anyways, i hope this story ended and she never comes back, because i am still looking at every corner even now that the cats realized a different human smell and are investigating everything.

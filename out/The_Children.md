I’m currently writing this in my parents home, before my inevitable death, and I wanted to tell you what the hell is going on in hopes someone on here will believe me.

For background, I live in a suburban neighborhood where nothing typically happens. Up until about 3 days ago when this all started. My wife woke me up at around 2:30 in the morning saying “honey, our kids are outside.”
Now, I knew that would be strange, but I decided to humor her and look out the window. Sure enough, right in the middle of the street we’re my 2 kids. I immediately ran into my kids room, just to find them fast asleep.

So what the hell are those things outside?

I grabbed some binoculars and looked out the window again. They were still in the same place, just staring at the house, unmoving. As I got a better look at whatever these things are that are trying to look like my kids, I noticed that their mouths were larger than normal, almost like they were stretched out. And their eyes, they looked as if they had a white glaze over them.

Then they looked right at the window, and opened their mouths into a wide, unhumanly grin. 

“Shit” I yelled. As they started to move closer to the house. I asked my wife “what should we do?” But as I turned around to see her, she opened her mouth into a large grin, and I noticed her eyes. Glazed white.

“SHIT!” I Screamed. As the creature ran toward my kids room. All I heard were screams and blood splatters before I ran out the back door of my home, rammed the keys into my car, and drove down to my friends house, way out of town.

I arrived at my friends house and told him what had happened. He looked at me like I was fucking crazy. “I know it’s outlandish, but I wouldn’t lie to you, can I stay here for a couple of days?” My friend agreed to let me stay, and the 2 days after that were going good, things felt somewhat normal finally.

Until about a few hours before I wound up in this shed.

Me and my friend were sitting on his front porch, looking at the lake in front of his house, when all of a sudden he became still. Almost like he was in a trance. Then I saw them by the lake.

My Wife and my kids, with glazed white eyes and inhuman smiles, standing perfectly still, looking ready to kill

With no hesitation, I ran into my friends backyard and into his shed. I dead-bolted it and thought “how the fuck did they find me?” I didn’t have time for much thinking, because just then I heard a knock on the shed door.

“Let us in Daddy. We won’t hurt you. We love you”

I knew damn well I wasn’t opening that fucking door without a fight. I picked up the chainsaw in my friends shed and fired it up. I tore the door open and to my surprise, there was no body there.

“What the hell?” “They were here, I heard them!”
  
Then I saw them emerge out of the woods, still smiling, still looking to kill. I rushed toward them and killed them with the chainsaw. I had no other choice. Those weren’t my wife and kids.

A couple of months past after the incident, and I was living back with my parents, since my friend had gone missing, and presumed dead. Then I got a knock on the door while I was home alone. I opened the door to see my friend. Except his eyes were closed. I tapped him on the shoulder and his eyes opened to reveal glazed white eyes. As a inhuman grin spread across his face, I knew I couldn’t get out of this one.

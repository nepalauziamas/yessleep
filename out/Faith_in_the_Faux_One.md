What you are about to read is part of the reality of the grim future, one our kind cannot comprehend and will not for the rest of the time we have left. There's no substance or meaning behind anyones actions. No more right or wrong can be done, and judgement has already been made. 

Discoveries became scarce. Humanity exhausted nearly every potential source of knowledge to absorb on Earth. There were no giant sea beasts in the deepest part of the ocean. No sasquatches, mothmen, or aliens. 

You see, humans are very childlike in their ways. Curiosity blooms in even the weakest of minds. That feeling that brings you to look during a car crash, or pick at a scab. We want to see whats underneath those dark thoughts. We want to know what happens, even if we're already aware of what it would yield. Confusing, yes. But all too real. 

This curiosity drove us until there was nothing more to discover. The world for a time seemed bleak, devoid of any hope of a more interesting feeling. 

The next few years after this realization, a time where funding to explore and uncover the secrets of our past stopped, we had found it. 

Seismic activity somewhere in the mountains of an undisclosed location had caught our attention. It ranged from low rumbles to quaking felt for miles, and had finally given us a reason to get excited. For months we bore holes into the Earth surrounding the area, aching and itching for some morsel of information to satisfy our eager minds. 

It was around 10,000 feet deep or so with the biggest drill we had available (which was about 6-7 feet in diameter) that it gave away, nearly sending the machine smashing into the crust. We'd hit a cavern, and from the looks of it, a big one. 

Pulling the drill out yielded a foul, musky odor. Like sulfur from the bowels of a demon. The fumes were so noxious it sent some of my colleagues into fits of vomiting and coughing. In the teeth of the drill was a chunky, black paste. It was organic in nature. Like the rotting flesh of a bloated carcass, it reeked of decay. The substance was fluid in a way. Moving and forming itself into different shapes, like it was trying to find its way back to its resting place. 

You probably wonder how I know all of this, but I assure you it is of no importance. I'm just one of the unfortunate souls to discover this first hand. The masses have yet to witness what lay beneath the crust. 

I was the one who had to go down the hellhole, as others began to call it over the next few days. I rappelled down the tunnel into the Earth until I reached the opening. I was met only with pitch black darkness and that same fetid smell, only worse. Even under my gas mask, I could feel those molecules worming their way into my nose. To even liken it to the smell of decay is far-fetched, but its the closest thing we could use to describe it. A warmth emanated from the underground expanse and encompassed me like a moist blanket.

Inch by inch, they lowered me deeper. Something was very, very wrong. What I could see of the walls were covered with the same substance that lined the drill. It's presence was accompanied by a faint trickling and squelching noise. 

About two quarters deep in the cavern, I felt a gentle, humid breeze pushing me ever so slightly from below, making the rope sway and move. 

I ignited a high visibility flare to shed some light on what the source may be. 

A skeletal humanoid laid before me in the fetal position, legs and arms crossed, suspended by fleshy tendrils mounted to the far walls of the cavern. They pulsed and rocked it back and forth. 

Its body was mostly bones, covered by muscular tissue that seemed to expand and cover more of its mass with each pulse of the tendrils. The organs lay exposed yet attached to its ribcage. I could see its lungs expand and rise, and its heart beat with a perfect rhythm. 

As I brought the light nearest its face, 
I just barely began to understand what it was, no, WHO it was we were intruding upon. Half of its skull remained barren while the other half was covered in expanding muscle. Its only formed eye looked up at me, empty and indifferent to my presence. There, around its head, laid a crown of thorns. They twisted and creaked like a living tree, whirling in an infinite spiral around its helm. 

Back to my going on about meaningless existence. I was the first one to lay eyes upon Him, and I was the first one fortunate enough to be given an opportunity to understand. He's not yet finished. 

Cradled by the warmth of the Earth's core, He rested and grew in His divine womb, the cavern we happened to pierce with our filthy machine. 

That eye, however indifferent it seemed to me at the time, spoke more than words. Beneath His gaze, not merciful nor evil, was a purpose we can't grasp. I cannot stress enough the importance of His mission. Humans have done this universe wrong by many means, and it's time those worthy be given their chance to leave it all behind. 

Though His form brandished the crown of thorns, that body was one of many. Two more wombs were found in other spots of the world, both with the holy symbol upon their heads. 

Am I worthy? No. Most definitely not. I've sinned and I've done wrong. That's why I'll relish in His awakening. While some of my colleagues have chosen to slit their wrists or blow their heads off, I am more than honored to witness this world's great purge. 

I will die by His hand, and be sent to Hell by his hand. 

He thirsts. It will be finished.

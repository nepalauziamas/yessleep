I slipped on a bathrobe and made my way down the stairs, contemplating how much to share with Grandpa the unusual things I’d witnessed in the less-than-twenty-four-hours I’d been at that house. On the one hand, I knew enough of verbal therapy to realize that it wasn’t effective unless you were willing to be completely open with your therapist. On the other, I didn’t want him to be so alarmed that he immediately institutionalized me – at a current institution, that is, not an old, spooky one that had been closed for a decade.   

I walked into the kitchen, where I found the table half-set for breakfast. Grandpa bustled over by the kitchen counter, his back to me. Seated at the table, a plate in front of him, was a naked old  man. He looked at me solemnly.

I opened my mouth to say – what, Lacey? “Who are you?” “Hey Grandpa, is it just me, or is there a butt-naked geezer joining us for breakfast?” What was there even to say at that point?

Grandpa turned around. “Good morning, sleepy face! You sleep more than a cat sleeps, you know that?”

He brought a skillet of eggs over to the table, dumped some on a plate that was presumably for me, then slid the second plate away from Old Nudie towards his own chair. He filled that plate with the remaining eggs, then sat down.

“I hope you’re hungry,” he said.

I decided to go for it. What the hell. “Who’s that?”

Grandpa looked around the room, perplexed. “Who’s who?”

I blinked. The old man disappeared. I pressed on, testing. “That man that was there.”

“Man?” Grandpa’s brow furrowed in confusion. “What man?”

 I sighed. It had been worth a shot. “Never mind. I was just joking around.”

“Hmm,” Grandpa said, unamused. “Little early in the day for jokes. Sit down.”

I obliged him, and started poking distractedly at the scrambled eggs. They looked a little greasy for my liking.

“You like eggs?” Grandpa asked.

I changed the subject. “I noticed when I was jogging, there’s only one room in the whole house that seems to be locked. Up on the third floor?”

“Yeah,” Grandpa said, concentrating on his breakfast.

“So what’s so special about that room?”

Grandpa stared at me, ominously. “You ever read Bluebeard?”

I turned white – or even whiter. Dad had made the ludicrous mistake of reading that fairy tale to me as a young child, and it had permanently scarred me.

Grandpa’s face broke, and he laughed. “My turn to make a joke!”

I exhaled. Good one, Gramps.

“No. That’s just a storage room. Files from the institute. There’s no reason it’s locked, really. I just can’t find the key!” He laughed again.

“Does the word ‘tabby’ mean anything to you?” I asked, feeling emboldened.

“Tabby? What is tabby?”

I realized that Grandpa, with English as his second language, probably didn’t even know the meaning of the word, let alone why it had appeared on my bathroom mirror. “Beats me,” I replied, knowing I was coming off as a delightful mixture of obnoxious and delusional.

 Grandpa looked at me, curiously. “Hm. Well. Finish your breakfast, get dressed, and we’ll have our first session. I think you need it.” He snorted. “Invisible men and tabby.”

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

It felt awkward having an “official” psychotherapy session with Grandpa. During his frequent visits over the years, we’d had many long talks, but it was quite a different thing to sit on a couch (I refused to lie down – too cliche!) while he sat on a chair with a notepad. It was probably against the rules for a psychiatrist to treat someone related to them, but Grandpa was retired, so there was no board that was going to expel him.

As a child, when I could still be outside for short periods, I’d seen my share of therapists, but my condition had confounded them. When I became housebound, we’d had difficulty finding someone willing to make house calls – this was before video-conferencing became commonplace – so Dad had essentially given up.

I don’t remember exactly how long we talked that day, but it was a lot. 

We started with me trying to describe my agoraphobia as best I could. I likened going outside to being suddenly plunged into deep water when you don’t know how to swim. I couldn’t really explain the fear in any logical way, only that I felt the outside was chaotic and unpredictable. I could control my universe more indoors. I liked when there was an order to things.

Grandpa asked if that’s why I enjoyed “cataloging.” He was referring to my somewhat eccentric hobby of recording things on audiotape and video. I wanted to be a documentary filmmaker, which piqued Grandpa’s interest. He wondered why documentaries specifically, and I remember saying, “I don’t want to tell stories. I want to tell the truth.” Little did I know the two weren’t mutually exclusive!

It was then that I let slip my admiration for the technical skill of Leni Riefenstahl, director of *Triumph of the Will* and *Olympia*. This would be a touchy subject in any kind of company, but Grandpa was a German born in the 1920s who never talked about the war. In my defense, there weren’t exactly a lot of female documentarians to look up to.

“Leni Riefenstahl?!” Grandpa looked scandalized. “The Nazi?!”

“She wasn't a Nazi,” I replied, sheepishly. “She just made documentaries for them.” 

“Ya, propaganda! Some people say she was a war criminal. Kind of an odd person to admire.”

“Well, I don't admire her for the bad stuff. Technically, she did incredible things. I mean, she was a genius. You have to separate a person's accomplishments from the type of person they are. I think. I mean, what if a guy came up with the cure for cancer but he was also like, molesting his kids or something. Is he a hero or is he a bad guy?”

Grandpa thought about this. “Boy, I was not prepared for these type of philosophical questions. Who is receiving the therapy here, anyway?”

We touched, mercifully briefly, on sex. He asked if I’d ever had a boyfriend. I replied in the negative, adding pitifully that no boy would be interested in some freak who couldn’t go outside. Grandpa said something about not needing to go outside for what teenage boys are interested in, which caused me to blush and immediately change the subject.

The subject turned to Dad. If there was one thing I didn’t have, it was Daddy issues. The man was pretty much perfect, in my opinion. I inquired about his brief time at Grandpa’s institute. Dad had worked as an orderly there one summer, between years of business school at the nearby Lakehead University in Thunder Bay. 

Grandpa didn’t tell me anything I didn’t already know. Dad had immediately caught the eye of Grandpa’s daughter Claire, who’d been hanging out there for the summer, much as I was then. They’d fallen in love, had an affair, and Claire had gotten pregnant. Shortly after she’d given birth, she’d left the country and hadn’t been seen by us since, as she gallivanted around the European fashion industry. I only knew her through her letters. But I was defensive of her, refusing to consider what she’d done as abandonment.

As our session wound down, Grandpa asked if there was anything else I’d like to talk about that we hadn’t covered.

“What would it mean if a person was seeing, like, apparitions of people,” I said, flatly, trying to appear casual. “People who weren't really there?”

Grandpa looked at me with pity. “Maybe it means the person is lonely. And her mind is inventing people to make her feel less lonely.”

He let that hang in the air for a while. Then he said, “I think we're almost done for today. But first, let me show you a little trick I used to prescribe to my patients with anxiety disorders.”

He pulled a baseball bat out from behind his chair, and I let out an involuntary yelp.

“Jesus!” I exclaimed. “I thought you were gonna whack me with that!”

“No,” Grandpa assured me. “On the opposite, you are the one who is going to do the whacking. What you do is, you find a pillow and you hit it with the bat.” He made whacking motions to demonstrate. “It gets rid of all the tension and nervousness. Like magic!”

I was skeptical. “Are you serious?”

“Try it.” 

He held out the bat. After some hesitation, I accepted  it.

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

Humoring Grandpa, I brought the bat with me to my bedroom. I was indeed anxious, my muscles tense from head to toe. The day had started off so well with my run. But then the visions, the mirror writing, and the verbal therapy – Grandpa had probed pretty deeply right out of the gate – had conspired to roil up my emotions.

I thought I might as well try Grandpa’s suggestion, skeptical though I was. I pulled a pillow out from under my bed covers and laid it on the bed. Then I raised the bat above it. I felt foolish. But I brought the bat down hard on the pillow. It made a soft, yet oddly satisfying, “thwack.”

I did it again. And again.

I imaged the pillow was my dumb brain. The one that kept me scared and reclusive. The one that had prevented me from having a normal life, with friends, a boyfriend, and camping trips. The one that made it likely I’d never be able to run a marathon.

I whacked the shit out of that pillow. I did it till my arms hurt. Then I dropped the bat and sat down on the bed, breathing heavily, perspiring lightly.

What do you know? It worked. The tension had left my body. Score one for Dr. Grandpa. 

I heard a familiar soft squeaking, and noticed the mice were back in the corner. I’d carefully reset all the traps after springing them, even testing a couple of them. Yet these mysterious, weightless mice were once again crawling all over the traps like they were nothing. I was determined to solve this riddle. 

Stealthily, I reached towards my desk for one of my many cameras. This one was a Polaroid. The Polaroid camera was already on the way out, being supplanted by digital, and it was years before hipsters would revive it. But I treasured mine, loving the immediacy of being able to capture an image onto something tactile.

I stood up slowly, and walked a few paces over to the mice, being careful not to startle them. I found a frame that encompassed all of them and snapped a photo.

The flash caused the mice to scatter. My Polaroid made a whirring sound and spat out a photo. I waved the photo impatiently, waiting for it to develop. 

 As the image gradually became clear, a chill ran down my spine.

The traps were there. The mice weren’t.

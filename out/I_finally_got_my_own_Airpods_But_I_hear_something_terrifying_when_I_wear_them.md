I first wore the Airpods to the Stop and Shop.

It was an incredible, other-worldly experience. I listened to the soothing voice of Neil deGrasse Tyson while picking through the broccoli. I learned about quasars while waiting in line for the deli.

Things got weird, though, when I got to the checkout line.

The cashier was one of the annoying ones. The kind that make cute little comments about the items you're buying, while you stand there in embarrassment.

"Oh, these are good," he said, as he slid my pack of lemonade iced tea across the scanner. *Blip.*

I turned the volume up on *StarTalk.*

"These are *so* useful. Own a few of them myself," he said, as he scanned the car phone stand. *Blip.*

He reached for the truffles. He looked me straight in the eye and said, "More chocolate for your fat ass, huh?"

I stopped dead.

"*Excuse me?"* I asked, slipping out my Airpods.

"More chocolate for your art class, huh?"

"That's not what you said."

"What?"

"You said…" I trailed off, looking at his pimply, juvenile face. He looked so innocent. "Nevermind."

I walked out in a huff.

*Maybe I did mishear him*, I thought, as I charged across the parking lot. After all, I was listening to *StarTalk* at the same time. Maybe the phonemes got all tangled up in each other.

Or maybe he was just a jerk.

I got home in a bad mood. Opened the box of truffles and inhaled three of them. Just to spite him.

Then my roommate got home.

"Tara! Want to join me?" I said, patting the cushion next to me.

"Nah," she said, over the low thrum of *Kansas* coming through the Airpods. "I got to take off my shoes and just smell my feet for a while."

I stared at her blankly.

"When are you taking your shower?" she asked.

"Not sure, why?"

"I'm going to sneak into your room and stalk your search history, like I do every night."

"What?!"

"I can't believe you still stalk Adam on Face --"

I ripped out my Airpods.

"-- bok choy with chicken. Do you want some? I can make extra."

I stared at her. "Are you going to go through my computer when I'm in the shower?"

She paled.

Then she ran into her bedroom and slammed the door shut.

*Did I mishear that too? No. There's no way.* 

I packed a few things and left for a friend's house. When I got there, she had the TV on.

"The search is still on for MacKenzie Johnson," the newscaster said. "If you have any information, please call the hotline."

"What's this?"

"Some local woman is missing," Amanda said.

The film cut to an older man -- MacKenzie's husband. "Please, if you have any information on my wife's whereabouts, go to the police," he said, his lip trembling. "I need her back. Please."

Something stirred inside me. A whim. A realization. I grabbed my bag and reached inside. Pulled out my Airpods.

"Please, if you know anything about my --"

His voice changed as soon as I stuck them in.

“Little bitch."

My heart stopped.

"It was easy. She's so weak, so fragile. Just got the rope from the garage and --"

I yanked the Airpods out.

His voice returned to halting sobs. "Please, if you know anything, call the police."

*Oh, I will.*

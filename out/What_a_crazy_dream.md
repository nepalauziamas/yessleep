I jump up in bed slowly taking on my surroundings after the night mare I just had. I decided to go make a cup of hot chocolate and share the nightmare with yall.

It was a stormy night and I was sitting at home watching chick flicks. I turned to look out of my glass door watching the rain pounding the window. Then came the flash of lightning revealing a large shadow of what looks to be a giant creature on my porch but it was gone just as quick. After watching a couple more times and seeing nothing I figured it was just one of the many trees in my yard.

Drowsiness finally hit me and I go to get in bed. The brightness of the moon from the window beside my bed doing close to nothing to lessen the darkness. I finally close my eyes right as the sound creaking floor boards sounded. I instantly shot up in bed thinking I imagined it. To my horror faint foot steps slowly creaked closer and closer to my room then stopped 

I saw what looked like the shadow of giant claws. I sat staring until the feet retreated and then silence. I shrugged it off and rolled back to face the wall I had just started to close my eyes when the lightning lit the room up enough for me to see the most monstrous creature in the far end of the room. It was quick but long enough to see the long sharp talons for hands and feet. Glowing red eyes on the most horrendous looking face showing it’s razor sharp teeth with an ominous grin drooling.

With the next flash though it was gone. Yea definitely need to get to bed I’m hallucinating now. I lay back down and finally fall asleep. *Drip* drip*drip around 30 minutes later I awake and instantly scrunch my face wiping it from the rain now leaking through my roof…or so I thought…the second I open my eyes I see that horrendous face again drool hitting my cheek.

It gives me a sinister grin and a low growl right before lunging at me clawing my arm teeth going for my face. (Dream Over) after jumping up and out the bed I finally calmed down realizing it was just a nightmare and I’m safe. Which brings me to the present hot chocolate in one hand typing this story sitting at my desk lights off except for my laptop screen with the other. The rain has slacked up lightning strikes about every 15 minutes . Matter of fact it should be striking any time from now. That hot chocolate was delic- what the hell? I just noticed these deep gashes going up my arm as I say my cup down.

I don’t know how I didn’t feel them they like pretty bad. They were covered in dry blood so obviously it happened at least an hour ago but I’d been in bed…dread and fear is what just washed over me. No it couldn’t possibly be…it’s just a coincidence I tried to convince myself. But that disappeared a second later when a strike of lightning quickly flashed a familiar looking shadow if I’d have blinked I would’ve missed it. I shake my head laughing at myself for letting a silly   Nightmare get to me like that none of that would ever happen in real life lol there’s no such things. Alrighty people gotta end the story here I need to search for roof repair companies and windows my roof is currently dripping rain droplets on top of my head and I can feel the warm howling wind on the back of my neck thanks to my cracked window it sounds so funny almost like a low growl…

I (14M) am a secondary school student in Madang Town, 3 hours away from Nanchang. If you don’t know where Nanchang is, I can’t make it more specific since it’s the nearest big city and I’ve never left this province.

I’m sorry that the story couldn’t be shorter. But if I wrote it in just a few sentences, no one would believe us. Believe me, I have tried.

Also, it seems like it is customary for me to apologize if my English is poor. But I know those of you on reddit do not like posts to drag on. So here is my story.

\----

As I unlocked the front door, I could see Mother glued to the television. As usual. She found the news captivating. I found it unbearably dry. “Ah, you’re finally back. We need a new bag of rice.” The subtext was that I am supposed to carry it back.

“That quickly? We just bought a bag…” I glanced at the bag in the kitchen, which contained just enough for a cup. “Fine. Let me change out of my uniform first.”

I tore off my shirt in my room, and put on a T-shirt and shorts. “What’s on the news?” I asked, so she wouldn’t start pestering me to get changed faster. She mumbled something about the Americans and the Japanese that I couldn’t quite make out. But knowing the state-owned channel she was watching, it was never going to be anything good.

\----

Unlike me, Mrs Yang at the vegetable stall was very interested in discussing the news with Mother. I had placed the bag of rice on the floor, and took out my phone for a short game whilst she finished up her conversation, which I hoped would be in 5 minutes but would inevitably turn out to be in excess of 30. Knowing this, I ducked into a dark corner, so I could avoid the sun’s glare reflecting off the screen. I could hear them blabbering on in the background, muttering their shared distaste of the Japanese or the Taiwanese… I’ll confess I wasn’t fully listening, but their conversations always revolved around such topics.

“Mrs Chen? Mrs Chen? What’s happening?” Mrs Yang let out a panicked scream. “Baojia, what’s wrong with your mother?”

Upon hearing my name, I finally looked up from my phone. If I hadn’t seen it, I wouldn’t have believed it either. Fur started sprouting from Mother’s face, and her nails began to lengthen into claws. A tail popped up behind her. I stared on, in shock. *What is this?*

Some of the older folks who came in from the countryside did not have the same question I had in mind. “A wolf!” They shouted. Everybody dropped everything and ran. Mother also ran, galloping past the line of stalls and into a nearby Japanese restaurant. I ran out after her, but only in time to see her flip a few tables and scaring away all the customers.

I stopped in my tracks. *I know this is my mother, but can I really say for certain that she wouldn’t attack me, in her state?* I took a small step backwards, then a big one as she started howling in the restaurant. I could hear voices behind me. “Call the police! There’s a wolf, they need to get rid of it!”

Perhaps in her wolf form, she was still able to hear and understand human speech. Right after the man behind me said that, she leaped out of the restaurant and disappeared into an alleyway.

I ran in after her, ignoring pleas for me to stop in fear of my life. It was my Mother, and I had to see if she was okay. When I finally reached the end of the alley, I found her lying slumped over, sweating profusely and breathing heavily, but in human form. She grabbed my hand tightly. “What just happened?”

\----

Father and I didn’t have much of an idea what was going on, but there wasn’t much we could do. We tried to keep more of an eye on Mother, but he had work and I had school. We asked a neighbor of ours to come and check on her sometimes. Practically nothing changed over the next month or two, aside from my allergies getting worse. The neighbor must have brought her dog over when she was checking on Mother.

I asked around, and apparently there have been some rumors about people transforming into wolves. From what I could gather, the earliest story was 10 years ago. It’s all hearsay, no official records or anything. I’ve also tried asking online, but within minutes it was scrubbed from the internet. Of course.

The short peace was broken again just over two months later. Father clearly thought what I described wasn’t real, and I was having doubts too. After all, it sounded ridiculous, too fantastical.

Mother left the kitchen as she waited for the soup to finish cooking, and plopped herself on the couch. The news was playing a speech by the Chairman, presumably on the subject of reunification.

How they built in a commercial break into the Chairman’s speech, I’m not sure. But Mother looked away from the screen as the familiar red sun appeared on the screen and the national anthem played. “Dinner is in half an hour. Finish your work before then.” Father nodded in agreement without looking up from his phone, reading his articles on the stock market obviously.

“Yes Mother.” I dove back into the world of trigonometry.

While I became more and more confused about angles and triangles, I could see out of the corner of my eye that Mother was becoming more and more excited. Her face flushed red, she was clapping at various parts, and hooting in glee at the prospect of reunification. Frowning, Father took out his earplugs to continue reading in peace.

“Son! What… What’s this?” Father woke me from my battle with question 4a. Once again, before my eyes was a wolf. A pair of red eyes just above the snout, she growled at us before pouncing at me. In desperation, I grabbed a cushion from the couch to shield myself.

We fell to the floor, and she pulled the cushion out of my hands in one clean motion. Annoyed after getting a mouthful of feathers from the cushion instead of a mouthful of flesh, she moved in for a second attack. This time I raised my arm in a futile defence. I thought this was the end.

She took a deep bite and clenched on to my arm, my blood leaving bright red puddles on the floor. I didn’t dare to yank my arm free in fear of only having half an arm left at the end of the maneuver. Lying down in my own blood, I felt the wet T-shirt cling to my body.

Bam!

Father grabbed the cushion and hit the wolf - Mother - on the head, hard. She yelped and escaped into the bedroom. Sensing an opportunity, Father looked around for a key and locked her inside. Then he came over to bandage my arm. Luckily, we kept first aid supplies at home. Meanwhile, she kept growling in a low voice.

“Now you believe me?” He said nothing in response. Which was understandable, I wouldn’t know what to say if I saw my wife turn into a wolf.

“How long did it take for her to turn back last time?”

“Uh, maybe ten minutes.”

“What if we try to speed it up? She was listening to the news just now, maybe if we turn up the volume she would hear it and want to turn back into a person?”

“I mean, I don’t follow completely, but it’s better than not trying I guess?”

Father grabbed the remote control and turned up the volume. I was positive the whole block could hear the Chairman’s speech about the military. But in response, she only seemed to howl louder than before. We could hear her trying to claw through the door.

Father and I looked at each other, and tried to dial down the volume. But even if we muted it, we could hear some whimpering in the bedroom. We decided to just leave the matter, and open the door when we hear Mother speak.

“It’s been fifteen minutes. How has she not turned back?”

“I don’t… Do you smell smoke?”

Father’s eyes grew wide. “The soup!” We ran to the kitchen, only to find half the soup boiled over, and the sides of the pot slightly charred. “Is this salvageable?” I asked Father, forgetting that like me, he knew next to nothing about cooking.

He had a taste of the soup. “It’s too bitter. What if we add some sugar to balance it out?”

“Is that how it works?”

“Probably, I have no idea.”

From behind the scratched doors a weak voice said, “No… That’s not how it works…”

“Mother!”

We unlocked the door, and just like last time, she was lying drenched in sweat and breathing heavily. “I heard something about burned soup… Baojia, what happened to your hand?” She spotted the bandages on my arm, and gripped my hand tightly.

\----

In the months after this, the transformations became more and more frequent, and Mother took longer and longer to turn back. We’ve gradually found that the transformations generally happen when she is very animated, occasionally when she’s very excited, but more often when she’s furious. Funnily enough, it only seems to be related to big issues, like when the news said the country was being targeted. I guess I was glad she didn't turn into a wolf when my teachers phoned her because I didn’t do my homework.

We’ve tried calling the hospitals, but no one would stay on the line after we uttered the words “transform into a wolf”. A few actually redirected us to the psychiatric unit. I suppose I can’t blame them. We’ve even tried asking some Buddhist monks to come and ward off evil spirits in Mother, but of course it didn’t work.

The rumors of these transformations were getting stronger each day. The father of the girl who sat two desks away from mine, the grandmother of the captain of the football team… But everyone acted like nothing happened. And so did I.

What worried us the most is the prospect that she would transform into the wolf form and not be able to transform back. For this reason, when we were home, we tried not to discuss anything that might trigger her, sticking to “safe” topics such as food, school, work… But I was pretty sure when we left in the morning she just flicked on the television and absorbed whatever the news said. It’s almost like it’s addictive to her.

On one of the few days she seemed to be well, we took her out to a restaurant. Not a fancy one, just the family-run one at the end of the street. As usual, it was so loud that you practically had to shout at your own table to be heard. There was no escape from the tsunamis of sound. 

“Mother, what would you like to order?”

Mother had no response. I instinctively looked at her hands: luckily there was no sign that claws were forming. She’s fine for now. My voice was probably drowned out by the conversation about the latest celebrity gossip from the table right behind her.

With difficulty, we placed our orders and the pre-prepared food was warmed up within minutes and delivered to our table. I was just starting to enjoy my dan dan noodles when a young couple tossed their bags onto the floor and sat down at the table behind me. This wouldn’t have been a problem, aside from their subject of conversation. It was so loud that I could hear everyone, all at once, and it was hard to make out who said what. But it was enough.

“... Cultural theft– Was cheating on her– Hanfu that existed for hundreds of years– With her best friend– Might need to repeat a year– Stole it like it was in the Summer Palace–”

Upon hearing this, I looked across the table at Mother. She was happily having her dumplings without a care in the world. I guess only my side of the table could hear them.

“... Smear Chinese people– Maths tutor for you, the number is– Deliberately chose an ugly model to represent us– Gave an ultimatum, her or the friend–”

I shook my head in disgust, in agreement with the couple. But I also felt an unfamiliar sensation. My fingertips were tingling, and without realizing it, I had curled my fingers up to a fist. I could feel my cheeks burning.

Achoo!

I brought my hands up to cover my mouth. And in that second, I noticed something new on my arms.

Fur.

That’s why I sneezed.

And it could only mean…

Putting my head between my knees, I tried to force my mind to think about other things, anything at all aside from the couple’s conversation.

*I have a maths test tomorrow. The formulas for trigonometry are…*

*In Three Kingdoms, Guan Yu’s stats are the highest at…*

And even…

*If I had the chance to ask out Siyun, how would I do it? I sit next to her, but I’m not even sure she knows I exist…*

Slowly, I could feel it fading away. The sound of blood ringing in my ears started to slow down. I sat up straight again, only to see that people had stopped talking. They all put on their masks, and were staring daggers at me.

There was nothing to do, aside from apologize and assure everyone that I was not sick.

\----

I wasn’t sure where I got my energy from, but I was still paying full attention in class despite staying up most of the night to make sure Mother was alright. Ironically, I was the only one paying attention, as the class around me dozed off, or played games discreetly, or just mucked around generally. Mr Wang clearly gave up on them.

He gave a quick glance at the other students, but decided to fix his gaze on me. “Baojia! This is an exam question: why is it important to remember the Century of Humiliation?”

“Because… We need to remember that there will always be foreign forces just off our shores seeking to carve us up and enslave us, and that we must not fall victim to their imperialism again!” This was a rehearsed answer, since this question appears in most school examinations on this period of history. But as I pronounced each syllable, it seemed to awaken something deep in me.

I could feel the tingling in my hands again.

“We must resist any efforts to encourage separatism and subversion. Otherwise, that is a path that leads only to certain death!”

Beads of sweat appeared on my forehead. I clenched my fist, hoping the pain would distract me. I couldn’t repeat the trick from before. Were I to think of something else, I wouldn’t be able to answer him.

The sun seemed so bright, its red rays burning into my skin.

“If we even show a second of weakness, this will be exploited by our enemies. We need to be prepared to fight with our enemies to their death, no matter how far away they may be!”

I paused, hunched over my desk. “Mr Wang, I don’t feel very well. May I be excused?”

No doubt he was shocked when he saw that I was white as a sheet, and waved at me to go. Lucky for me too, since I could feel my control slipping with every passing moment.

I ran to the toilet and locked myself in a stall. Roughly five minutes later, I woke up in the same stall, but now with scratch marks on the door and strands of fur on the floor.

\----

That’s the first time I experienced the transformation myself. But in the weeks since it’s happened a few more times, and just like Mother, it takes longer and longer for me to transform back.

Mother is now in a state where she almost cannot transform back. We would need to speak to her specifically to distract her from whatever she is thinking at that point in time, so she can transform back into her human form - her normal form.

I look at her and I worry about myself. I don’t want to spend the rest of my life as a wolf. But what could I do? There is nowhere to hide from this constant onslaught of talk about the news, about politics. The old men at the park, the office workers coming out for a smoke break, the couple sitting next to us at the restaurant, they’re all reciting the same stuff they heard on the news. Whenever I hear it, my heart races, I get the tingling again. Everything seems capable of provoking me into another attack.

And it’s more than just Mother and I. I’ve seen with my own eyes, other people are transforming into wolves too. But the hospitals still aren’t accepting us, and we’re not allowed to discuss this on the internet. At least, on our side.

I used a VPN to access this side of the internet so at least there is an account of this out there. Please, help us. No one is willing to help us at home. You are our only hope.

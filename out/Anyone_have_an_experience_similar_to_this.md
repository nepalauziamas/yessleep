Hi! So, this is my first post ever on Reddit and I’m not exactly sure how it’s going to be received. I guess a little bit of a disclaimer I’m 20 years old now and this story takes place when I was around the age of 6.

Around October of 2006 my family and I had a strange encounter in the middle of the night and I’m not sure what to make of it. I was talking with my mother earlier tonight and that’s what spurred this initial post I’m making on here. For background we live in rural Pennsylvania. The area we live in was known for coal mining back in the day. The coal industry ran out back in the 1950’s and now what’s left are abandoned coal mines, coal banks, and some eerie forests when Fall comes around. If your from my area of Pennsylvania you know what I’m talking about. Around 1AM we heard a soft knock on our front door. Our house at the time had steps that lead right up to our front door and a very small patio area with bushes on each side of the patio, the patio had a small pitched roof above it and one small luminescent light that illuminated the patio at night. My father slept on the couch which was right next to the door and was the first to get to the door that night. Followed close behind by my mother and a I. When dad opened the door he was dumbfounded along with my mother to see two older women, one in her thirties and one in her fourties’, along with a little girl around my age, standing on the patio. The older woman in her fourties’ was standing on the left side of the patio holding a metal box that looked similar to a money box used for collection and the woman on the right side just stood there with the little girl cowering behind her and didn’t say anything for the entire duration. She just stared blankly, almost seemingly looking past us. Also, none of them were wearing any shoes.

Before any of us could say anything the woman asked my father in a monotone voice “would you like to buy some candy?”. My mother started shaking her head at my father as her and I were standing behind him in the doorway. He responded “well, what do you have?” And quickly stuck his hand behind his back and stuck his pointer finger out at us telling us to wait a second. Me and my mother slowly drifted toward the doorway to see what was happening. The lady quickly opened the metal box with arms outstretched to show us that their was nothing in the box. From what I remember their was a solid six second pause of my mother and father trying to figure out what the hell is going on as they just stood there, with their unmoving, burning gaze. My dad spoke up and said “theirs nothing in there.” They didn’t say a word and just continued to stare blankly at us. My father, who was a hulking roided out man who stood at 6’4 and weighed almost 265 lbs, was getting quite annoyed by this point and simply told them they needed to “get out of here or else”. 

The eerie part of it was they did just that.

Without a word or a change of composure they closed the box, stepped off the porch and took off down the road into the darkness and we never seen or heard from them ever again. Another minute detail I would like to add is that their is one way into and out of my neighborhood down a single lane road. My neighborhood is surrounded by woods and the road wraps around and goes full circle dividing my neighborhood into a so called “high” road and “low” road. They didn’t walk towards the exit that leads to the highway instead they walked up around the back going further into the neighborhood, or the woods. It’s also a good idea that I note that their are trails up that way that can connect to other towns but walking those trails in the middle of the night would be difficult especially for people with a child. 

I would love to hear back from the community and see what their thoughts are or if anyone has had a similar experience to this. Me and my mom have no idea what to make of it and it’s been a source of controversy for us all day as it happened many years ago and our recollection of the events are a bit fuzzy now. I hope this story is well received and I look forward to hearing back from all of you! I will also do my best to answer questions. Also, I apologize if my writing isn’t the best I tried my best to put this story together and I’m not much of a writer lol. Thank you all for helping me out and to those who read this!

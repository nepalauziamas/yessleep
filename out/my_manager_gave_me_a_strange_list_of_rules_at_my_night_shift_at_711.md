I'm still wondering how I got into this situation but I'm sure il be more happier dead than alive right now. I'm writing this in the woods away from the store while that "thing" is hunting me down. But anyways il cut to the story for you guys.

anyways I'm a broke 18 year old who's trying to get a job to move out of my mom's house but that didn't work so I went on to Craigslist one day and found a job at 711 for the night shift offering 15 dollars per hour and 1,200 dollars every week. I took it without a exception and started. I pulled up to 711 and my manager was a old but good looking dude for his age said to read the envelope on the counter and to only read it past 11 as it was 10:54 I took a bathroom break.
after I got on to read the envelope and I was shocked.


Rules to survive your shift at 711

Rule 1. Only take a bathroom break before 11 pm to ensure your parts are still Their after the night.

Rule 2. A old man comes in at 2am exactly and will ask for the public bathroom key give it to him and don't say anything to him. After he goes he will give it back and order a new port red short. Say we are out of stock but I will Inform you if we do later.He will leave.

Rule 3. If the lights ever go off run to the employees only room and lay face first and close your eyes for exactly 1 minute before your set to go back to your shift. If you don't I warned you.

Rule 4. Make sure the guy in the grey scarf doesn't get in to the store, if you have to threaten him with the police before you do anything else and you better hope it works.

Rule 5. We have a secret gun compartment In case the "thing" tries to get you, you will know that it's coming when the slushy machine stops running. And remember theirs one bullet for you and you only, you  will want it if you ever encounter it.

Rule 6. If the gun stops for some reason and doesn't work run into the woods and forget dialing 911 it won t work the thing knows where you are if you even pull out to dial 911.

Rule 7. Please say how's your night and thank you to coming to any customer that enters the store. They really like their manners more than you.

Rule 8. If the tall lady is visible in the tree line immediately hid under the desk until she's gone. Trust me you don't want her here. 

Rule 9. Make sure you always have a pocket knife, some of the customers get aggressive just use brute force. Trust me they will leave.

Rule 10. The final rule is 1 minute before your shift ends go to the employees only room and stay Their til you get off shift. The world won't be the same if you leave without using the room. 

Thanks for reading and stay safe sincerely, - Tom 

As I read the rules the old guy shows up and he calmly asks for the key so I give it to him and he uses it, the thing is when he comes back he asked for new port red short so I calmly tell him we are all out come back later. He calmly leaves. 
Then the lights go out so I lay down and wait til the minute passes. Then the man comes and bangs the door, I get the cell phone out and dial 911 before acually calling them and he ran away. But the problem happend when I see the tall women I hurriedly hide under the desk but she stayed their longer than I thought and I poked my head out but luckily she's gone. Now the power went out again and turned back on. The slushy machine ain't turning on so I panicked, I didn't want to die but I don't want to be seen by the thing eathier so I took the gun and ran to the woods while I hear vicious screams and howl's like war cry's and it's a big ass spider I big ass spider just crawling into the store and I cry. I load the gun and run deep as I can but he heard the twig of course snap and he's full speed chasing me so I turn around point the gun and shoot. It's eye full of black purplish liquid and I just stare shocked and then he limps over with them terrifying reaches as it begs for it's like and I grabbed a heavy but slightly sharp stick and stab hand hit it back and fourth til I could barley hear the wimps. I walk back and close the store not long before passing out and waking up in the ER with my mom waiting and police asking what happend....

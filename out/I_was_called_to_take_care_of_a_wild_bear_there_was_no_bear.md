HI my name is Jered and I work at a wild animal control organization whose name I am not going to disclose for obvious reasons. My job consists of getting called by one of the national parks close to my area that some animals have gone berserk(usually the fault of some tourist thinking he owns the place) so I need to go there to  locate and tranq the animal so it can be transferred to an area dipper in the forest. The animal is usually a bear or some wolfs(although this is rare)


But I am getting sidetracked. The reason I wrote this is because of something that happened about a week ago. I was relaxing at my front yard Argo my dog a beautiful beagle excellent for hunting was sitting  next to me when the phone rang. It was a one of the national parks I work at now this wasn't a surprise as this was the time that most bears would wake up from hibernation and they were a little aggressive! So I loaded my track got Argo at the back seat. When I reached the park I was informed that the two bears were fighting something not uncommon for bears to do in oorder to establish dominance. So I reached the seen it was late afternoon it would be dark in a few hours I needed to be quick when I got closer I saw a pool of blood the grass was covered with it 

The smell of Cooper was unbearable. After resting the urge to puke I started searching there might be a severely injured animal there. Argo followed the smell and I followed him the fight had gone deeper into the forest. After about half an hour of searching I was beginning to think of going back when I saw it. A bear or what was left of it getting closer. I relished it was one eye a bear I know because it is very aggressive and I had been called for him many times. The reason I called him that was because he was injured on his left eye. At first I felt sorry for the poor thing but my sadness quickly turned to fear when I saw the condition he was in he was torn apart his black four now almost completely red from his blood his insides were scattered around and some were missing completely. Suddenly Argo started to bark and then charge to the woods I followed him calling him by his name. 


I didn't know what had done this to one eye but it had to be more than dangerous. Argo stopped at a clearing stopped right behind him and looked up there was a rock and on top of it was what thought of being a deer at first . A deer that stood on two legs eating something it holds with two hairy hands turned to look at me revealing rows of sharp teeth painted red by blood. It seemed extremely thin like it hadn't eaten in ages. I couldn't even process what was happening before Argo started barking again and run towards the creature. It moved so quickly I blinked and almost missed Argo…. Argo he was crushed I heard his bones crock his flash being torn. Then it came for me. By all logic I should have died there was no way to survive but somehow maybe it was my years of expirience or just instic but somehow unfroze and shot it two times. The creature roarded and fell back. I started running I hit it with tranq darts so it wouldn't have being injured. 


I heard it running towards me even it was so thin it ran so quickly not even caring about the fact that even a bear would have fainted by one of these shots. It followed me bumping to tree after tree but continued to purse. The only way to survive was to reach the track. My legs heart but I continues its muffled breathe right behind me I wouldn't make it I wouldn't be able to reach it in time so I did the only thing I could do. I shot with my rifle without turning back. A normal gun would have broken my fingers but the recoil was weaker with tranqu darts it was still enough to make me drop it though. The creature sricked and stopped I managed to get inside the track and start the engine. The creature ramed the door almost complete destroying it. My hand was almost crashed and hearted like hell. 


I flatend the the gas and left as fast as I could. The police and the hospital said it was a bear attack and what I saw was a hallucination created by the shock of the attack. I was forced to comply but I know what I saw I am not crazy. My arm will need some months to recover it was broken. I don't know what that thing was I don't know if there are more like it but I know I am never going there again.

[Update 3] (https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/5v9lxi/ive_been_seeing_a_man_in_my_backyard_for_the_past/)


I’m sorry for the wait everyone but I have been on the road all day.

I posted another album on imgur showing pictures of my hotel from the other night.

Last night when I posted the third update, many people in the comments had told me I needed to stop using reddit as it would only lead to find my location, so I didn’t. I turned off my laptop and put my phone on airplane mode for the past day. I decided my best course of action would to be to calm my nerves and finally get some shut-eye. I signed off of reddit, jumped into my buddy’s couch, and finally went to sleep. 

At approximately 3 in the morning my friend woke me up telling me I needed to check something out. I immediately grabbed the revolver I had left on the table next to the couch, and we went to the front porch. In the distance I we could see a car parked all the way down the road. I’d say it was about 300 yards and still visible because of a street light. The following was the conversation best I could remember it.

Tom: See that car down there, I was dozing off and the moment I snapped out of it the thing just showed up out of nowhere it was just sitting there. 

Me: How long do you think it’s been there for?

Tom: I’m not sure, I saw it there and stared at it for a good 2 minutes, after that I took my flashlight and started flashing it on and off, after that the car shut off and some guy got out and waved and had walked into the woods.

There is a wooded area near my buddy’s house that if you walk through it you can go walk into a large open field in his backyard. There is a fence dividing the field and from his backyard but it can be easily hopped.

Me: Do you think we should go check it out?

Tom: No, this guy could be going into the woods and coming back round towards my back door, you have to stay here and I’ll go check it out.

Me: Alright if it's a Gray volkswagen we need to leave immediately. I want you to record the license plate and look inside to look for anything notable. That means ropes, knives, duct tape, anything sketchy we need to get out of here. 

Tom: Alright wait inside and defend the house. Make sure no one gets inside.

I went back inside and stared out the window as Tom approached the vehicle with his 12 gauge. 
I went to the back of his house stared out his backyard window and saw some figure start walking across the field. This was particularly strange as there were no houses visible in this field and he just seemed like he was walking towards nowhere. He climbed over a hill and he was no longer in view from the window. I went back to the front window to look at the car and Tom was checking it out. I felt relieved for the slightest moment as I felt like maybe just maybe, I was overreacting. Then his home phone rang.

I looked at it and saw the caller I.D.and it was my area code, not Tom’s. At this point I had my phone still on airplane mode so I assumed it was someone from my neighborhood/family trying to contact me. I felt almost intrusive seeing that I was answering a call to a home that was not even mine, but now was not a time to take chances so I answered.

I picked up the phone:

Me: Hello?

Caller: (Silence for a few seconds)

Me: Excuse me who this?

Caller: Oh excuse me sir my apologies. Is this the owner of the household?

Me: No I am just a friend of the owner he is currently outside who is this?

Caller: (Silence for another few seconds)

At this point I just felt that feeling you get in the pit of your stomach when you realized you fucked up. I just revealed that I am here alone and whoever is calling just realised that.

Me: Hello?

Caller: Who else are you with sir is it just you?

At this point I was shaking and I could barely speak without stumbling my words. I decided the best things to do was lie like no tomorrow.

Me: Um, No we are having a party and there are a couple other people here. I ask again sir who is calling.

Caller: Are you sure about that I was just walking by and saw that there is only two cars in his driveway.

At this point I completely lost my shit.

Me: LIsten just fucking tell me who you are why the fuck are you calling this house so late.

Caller: (More silence)

Me: Hello?! Can you please just fucking tell me?!

Caller: I apologize sir I may have the wrong number. Tell whoever owns this house to call back. Thank you.

Then he hung up.

Tom had come back and said the car was not a volkswagen and had a license plate. He said the windows were tinted and the doors were locked so there was really nothing he could make out. I told him about the caller and he said he had no idea who’s number that was. He called back, no answer. He called from a restricted number, no answer. 

An hour passed by as we were sitting on the porch and we heard an audible slam from his back door. We both looked at each other and he motioned to follow him around back. We saw nothing out of the ordinary. We looked around everywhere for footprints, but still nothing. When we had gone back to the front porch after countless minutes of searching, it was approximately 4 in the morning at that point. It wasn’t until 10 minutes after we got back to the porch that we noticed that car 300 yards away was gone and we hadn’t even noticed.

I haven’t gotten any sleep since last night. I told him that I wanted to leave his house because I need to keep moving, and he said he wants to come too. He locked up all his doors, brought some guns, and we drove off at 6 in the morning. Police still haven’t done jack shit despite all the valuable intelligence I gave them, and I’ve been on the road all day with my friend. I drove a lot and he slept in the back. We are currently at a Mcdonald's as I type this. We were joking saying if we do end up getting kidnapped, murdered, attacked, these nosleep posts will make one hell of “Based on a real story” script.

I’m just tired guys. Tired of being stalked, tired of being hunted down, and tired of making these goddamn posts. I just want this to be over.

If anything happens tonight….I’ll let you all know. Bye for now.

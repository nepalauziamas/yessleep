When the stress started to get to me, I went out camping. I'd spend two or three days in the forest or mountains or plains. It doesn't really matter where it was as long as there's few people there. There was something so refreshing to me about the sound of nature, completely devoid of human touch.

This time I'd set up my tent in the middle of plains. The closest city was about ten miles away, and I couldn't see another person around me. It was just me, the wind, and the moving clouds. The sun was falling beneath the horizon.

A couple of black birds flew through the sky. I liked the way they flew. Something about it was just so mesmerizing, so unreal, as if they defied the rules of earth. They flew at a speed too fast and without moving a single muscle.

Suddenly I yawned. The yawn lasted ten whole seconds and it was loud. I could feel my jaw stretching to get it out of me. When it finished my eyelids felt a bit heavier, and I figured that it was time to sleep. I turned around, and walked towards the tent. Bees buzzed on the ground. The air blew right into my face, making me squeeze my eye lids.

I got into my sleeping rag and within seconds I'd passed out.

Then I woke up. I knew that I'd woken up too early, that it was still night outside, yet I wasn't tired. I wondered what had woken me up, and then I realized that there wasn't any noise. It was completely silent. I couldn't even hear the blood inside of my own ears. It was as if everything had frozen.

Slowly I brought my palms up to my face. Counting my fingers, I stared at them for a few moments. It certainly wasn't a dream. I knew that because it was all too real, and then I heard shrieking.

I could tell that it was very far away, but it made me jerk out of bed. Why would anybody be shrieking in the middle of the night? I slowly got up, and fuddled out of the tent. It would have been pitch black if not for the bright moon in the sky.

But the bright moon didn't take my attention at all. About three hundred meters away from me, there was a giant hole. I've never seen a hole this big in my life. It was wider than a small town. I saw a patch of land extending outwards towards the middle of the hole, like a bridge cut in half, and on it I saw a humanoid shape, but it was too big to be a human. It was completely black, and I'd wager it was almost five meters tall and it held a large scythe in its right.

In front of the creature, lining up in the thousands, there were humans that were pale and white. They stood still, occasionally moving up once the large figure permitted it. When they got to the front, they leaped into the hole and I'd hear some sort of shrieking before it suddenly vanished, not because it had gone too far to be heard. No. It had just vanished.

I took a step backwards, and then another step backwards, and I got into my tent. I don't think I was supposed to see this, and I don't want to know what they'd do if they saw me.

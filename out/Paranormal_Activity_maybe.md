Let me start by saying I don’t consider this a horror story but rather yet something that could be horrifying to some. This particular story takes place about 8 years ago at an exes parents house.

This house is in the middle of the country in some small town in Iowa. There are no next door neighbors or anything like that. This was a big beautiful home recently built on land her parents had purchased. 

I’ll get straight to the point but I wanted to just set the scene a little bit. 

One night me and my ex gf are getting ready to go to bed so we turn off all the lights and TV from upstairs as we are sleeping in the guess bedroom in the basement. Mind you we were just house sitting, it was a beautiful home with a pool and hot tub so we went to just get away for the weekend.

Anywho we have everything turned off and we both lay down to go to sleep. There isn’t a tv in the room we’re staying in just complete darkness. 

As we’re laying down trying to fall asleep I hear what sounds like 2 older ladies having a conversation. I don’t know exactly what they are talking about but they definitely are speaking to one another. It almost sounds like they are upstairs having this conversation as it muffled but clear enough to hear them talking. 

I don’t have schizophrenia and don’t take drugs that make me hallucinate or anything of the sort. I just had to let you know that because I am sure some ignorant people would attribute my experience to that. But this is why they cant.

I figured I was half sleep half awake kind of like when you’re almost sleep and something in your sleep wakes you like a ball being thrown at you or you falling. That state. But nope.

I honestly did not expect what happened next to happen but, it did. I asked my ex “hey do you hear anything?” She replied “Yes I do.”

So l asked her specifically “What does it sound like?” And replied that it sounded like people talking. So then I asked her was it men women or what. She said “It sounds like two ladies.”

I told her that I heard the same and we both had a wtf moment. She told me she wanted to ask me but she thought I would think it was silly. 

After confirming what we both heard we turned on the lights went upstairs and checked every room, bathroom, tv, radio and even went outside around the house. Nobody to be seen and all appliances were off. This is a true story. 

I ask you all, what could this be? I have never had an encounter with ghost or other paranormal entities but I cant help to think this is what that was. I was thinking that maybe her parents had the home built on some land with those spirits still there. I haven’t dealt with anything like that since or even before.

I consider myself agnostic spiritually so obviously I’m always in the middle of the spectrum with things like this but I did just want to share my story and hopefully get some interesting feedback. Thank you all. Be well.

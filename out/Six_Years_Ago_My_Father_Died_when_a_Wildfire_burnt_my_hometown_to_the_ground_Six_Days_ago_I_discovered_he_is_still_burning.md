  

I-

…

Fuck.

I don’t know how to even write this.

…

The trauma of losing your father while you’re growing up is fucked enough. I concluded a long time ago that the person I was becoming when he was still alive, died the same day he did. Ever since, my emotions, experiences, perspectives, thoughts, relationships, any sense of normal…they’re are all fucking twisted and damaged with the mental baggage of knowing half of my set of parents I was born with is fucking dead.

Furthermore, what pisses me off to no end is that people try to console me with bullshit lines like “He died a hero.” Like are you kidding me? People are disgusting in their worship of first responders - as though they’re these demigods, to which their sacrifice is an act of benevolence, one the public feels entitled for them to make, and in return we should revere them. It makes them feel good inside.

Worship doesn’t change the fact my Mom’s passion for life is broken without him.

Reveration doesn’t make our household any less lonely. 

Thoughts and prayers doesn’t bring back a ruined childhood.

A thank you for his sacrifice doesn’t change the fact my Dad’s fucking dead.

…

Honestly…fuck you if you say this shit to me.

You see…my Dad was a Firefighter.

And that summer he died, when I was just thirteen, it sprung upon us all unexpectedly. 

Northern Idaho can get pretty bad, but, what made this one particularly nasty was the fact it started two months before the “wildfire season” was suppose to start. Overnight it had already engulfed thousands of acres…if you live in the area you might have saw it on the news that year and know which one I’m talking about. Long story short…the state government wasn’t prepared, let alone my hometown.

My Mom woke me in the middle of the night. She told me to not grab anything…just run for the car. I was confused why, but I remember she gripped my arm painfully and before I could even process anything as we were running in the darkness of my house, we were outside. 

I could tell there was smoke in the air, by how heavy, dry, and bitter it was. I remember coughing, and seeing my Dad – which I didn’t know would be the last time – standing next to the doors of our SUV holding them open. I remember behind him, in the distant mountains in view of our house, which you couldn’t normally see at midnight, glowing with a burning rim along the curves and edges of their silhouette. I didn’t have to even think of the word to know what it was that was coming for us. 

Mom practically flung me inside, raced to secure my seatbelt, and slammed the door shut. She turned to look up at my Dad. He was rapidly telling her the evacuation routes to safety, and that he was getting deployed with his men down at the station to try and begin the work to detain it. 

I could tell my Mom was slightly bewildered, but this not having been her first experience like this as the wife of a fireman, she nodded with understanding, kissed him goodbye, and then got in the driver seat. Two seconds later, we began speeding off down the highway.

I wasn’t scared. My Dad had done this before. None of my memories, up until that point, associated with his job were in anyway negative or laced with trauma yet. It was, in a twisted way, a celebratory thing. Dad’s coworkers were another type of family to him, one that everyone adored in our town because they risked their lives to protect us every year. All I remember were the town picnics in their honor; the way the mayor shook their hand; the way that when we ran into his coworkers at Lowes or the Burger Diner they would smile and nod at me and my mom with understanding and appreciation.

Thirteen year old me never fathomed the possibility he could actually die – that all of them would. I never fathomed that we’d “lose”, never quite digested the true danger of it all. I never fathomed that their sacrifice would be in vain – that not only did my Dad burn alive, or suffocate, which ever got to him first, that he and his coworkers would fail to save my hometown – our house, and thousands of acres of forest. My childhood hamlet of roughly 5k was completely obliterated by the flames. To this day, the vegetation is still healing the Earth there. I never imagined that the fire would rage for weeks until they had gotten men and women as far away as Italy and Australia to fly in to help us contain the thing.

I never imagined that my childhood was one destined to be broken - that my Mom would grow defeated and I grow bitter.

I didn’t think that if he did fall in line of duty, there’d be no body to recover to say goodbye to at his funeral.

Part of what has made it difficult to move on from the trauma is the fact that, up until six days ago, my Mom and I felt like the universe wasn’t allowing us to escape. This is because every year since my Father’s death, every new house we’ve moved into has burned down in a wildfire. Every single one. 

It doesn’t matter what town.

It doesn’t matter what type of house, or the material.

Because for reasons that I still can’t really explain,  at some point after moving somewhere new, a wildfire spawns and sweeps through our area that we occupy and burns everything down.

None of the instances, however, have been as widespread and infamous as the one that charred my Father alive.

The second year after it happened, when I was fourteen, we were then living in a suburb of a town not far down the interstate from the ruins of my old home town. A lot of the folks from my hometown who survived settled in the area, so we figured it would make it easier for us to adjust. We were devastated when it happened again, but we chalked it up to fucked up bad luck. 

I remember in the hotel room the nights following that, my Mom wouldn’t stop crying. I think that second fire less than a year after Dad passed was really what broke her. She was trying to stay strong for me after my Dad died but, I think the second fire made her feel like the world was trying to torture her.

When I was fifteen, we went a little further south. On to a more well known, bigger, established city – one where I didn’t know anyone. That year, it wasn’t a wildfire, but a “plant fire” from an abandoned factory that destroyed our house. Apparently it was set off by some homeless junkie…but that didn’t matter to the insurance people. They thought my Mom was committing fraud to get more insurance money, accusing her of thinking that she didn’t think the Hero’s fund the state had set up for us in honor of our father was enough compensation. The court battle financially ruined us for a time. We went from living in our houses, to a dirty basement apartment on the other side of the city. When my Mom wasn’t working her two jobs; she was meeting with her lawyer to try and fight the case. It dragged on long enough that I grew a year older, and at sixteen yet again I witness our home catch aflame as our apartment building caught on fire.

We won our case – no one could bring a shred of evidence against either of us that we were arsons. Just incredibly unlucky – the Judge said when he eyed us.

At seventeen, my Mom began to start saying that we were cursed. She had it. We used the funds from our victory in court to pay off our family debts, and buy an RV. She said that if we kept moving, whatever it was that was haunting after us would have to work harder to “catch up”.

That day she told me that I fell asleep crying, because I thought after all of the shit we’d been through, I had was now losing my mom too.

That year we were spared from our “curse.” But a fire had “coincidentally” broken out at the last RV camp we had been permanently at. It seemed to reinforce my moms supernatural theory, but all I could do was despair at my mom’s unhinged mentality.  In our RV, we celebrated our second year in one place, if you can call two years spent in an RV the same “place,” and with that, my Mom officially said goodbye to Idaho as we moved ourselves to the Oregon Coast.

By eighteen I had given up trying to have friends. I’d been saying hello and goodbye to people my whole coming of age by that point we moved so much that I stopped trying to become invested in my peers at school. I was trying to coast through my senior year unnoticed so that I could finally go to college and leave all of it behind – my own trauma, my mothers insanity, and the supposed ghost of my Dad that was following us. Somehow, though it didn’t really make sense in context, I thought that when I went to college and started my own life that the past would be just the past and I wouldn’t be the victim of a string of coincidences that were chasing after us.

But sure enough, Oregon has wildfires too. And while the town we were in didn’t burn down as the cascade mountains and pacific coasts are too wet to allow such a fire to flourish, it was enough for me to finally pack my bags and leave home forever.

I’m nineteen now currently. I’ve been living on my own in Seattle since. I’m working two jobs, freelance on the side, living paycheck to paycheck. I have a bunch of roommates who I’m not friends with, but they’re chill and mostly clean and leave me alone so it’s good enough. I’ve been keeping to myself since, trying to figure out if the way forward for me is college or the military.

I call my mom occasionally, just to check in on her. She took the RV to the Florida, where she says they don’t have issues with fires for the most part because that state is a humid drenched tropical swamp slowly sinking into the ocean – total opposite to the rugged and varied landscape here of the Northwest.

To clear my head, I went camping this previous weekend for memorial day weekend. It was just me, a sleeping bag, and a backpack. Seattle is a proper city but…its not far from some of the most gorgeous and untapped scenic beauty. Despite all of natures destruction I’ve witnessed all my life, somehow I’ve never shook my passion for the outdoors.

After a few hours of hiking, I found a lake to set up for the night by. While Washington can be pretty gloomy, this time of a year is clear and perfect. After eating a can of beans, I watched the sun sink below the canopy of evergreens crowding around the edge of the lake, and the stars and moon reveal themselves, as their reflections glittered across a still lake.

At around 2 AM…I woke to smoke.

Coughing, my eyes opened to a bright night illuminated by flaming eating the tree line along the lakeshore. I was angry at myself for being so tired from my hike that I had somehow slept through noticing it. The fire was less than a hundred feet away from me, and racing closer. I rushed to put on my boots and grab my canteen of water and water purification pills, and left everything else by my campsite.

Rushing back through the trail I came from, the darkness of midnight quickly returned, and it became difficult to see. In my adrenalin pumped sprint, I accidentally snagged my ankle on a thick branch   and fell face first into mud. Knowing I didn’t have time, I shoved myself back off from the ground and continued my run through the woods, only now I was limping.

Before I was successfully, against all the statistics and odds I learned about forest fires, outrunning the rate of which the forest was catching alight. But now with an ankle out of action, it was catching up to me.

I thought I was going to die. 

It was then I began to understand why my Mom thought we must have been cursed. Why us? Why me? Why our family? Why was this happening every year? Why couldn’t the fires of this world stop obsessing over us? Why were we so unlucky?  Why couldn’t we live in peace? Who had we hurt to deserve this?

I began to cry as I ran. Growing up I began to resent her for giving up on trying to be happy, for instead opting for what I thought was a conspiracy – a comfortable delusion that made her swallow the hard pill of the truth easily. I distanced myself from her. And now I’d probably never even get to talk to her again – not to tell her she is right about our curse or even to ask her what coffee I could pick up for her at the shop.

And then I was at a cliff. Below was a river. If I jumped, I would die most likely from impact.

I turned behind me.

The brightness seared my vision. The heat burned my skin. I began to pant as the smoke resumed choking me as the fires caught up. A thought I had wondered so many times before came to my head – is this how Dad died? Running through the woods?

I was practically blind by that point. So when I saw the darkened figure walking towards me, I dismissed it as an illusion.

The details manifested as it approached, seemingly unphased by the burning death around it. It was a humanoid…a man. Wearing a bright uniform with a hat, oxygen tank, and gas mask. A fireman. In my half cognizant panicked state of mind, I thought I might have been saved.

And then in horror, I saw the skin on it’s neck; it’s hand. Blacked and peeling away, revealing charred flesh and bones in parts. It reached out to me, as though extending its arm to offer me its hand – which was just black bone. I shook my head, taking a step back further towards the cliff. 

Was I crazy? Was this a dream?

The fireman caught on fire, but they didn’t seem to care. It stopped walking closer to me, and instead stood still, keeping its arm extended towards me. I saw something glint on the upper right side of the uniform; right next to the zipper. A nametag.

My heart stopped when I read the surname. That millisecond felt like an infinity. I turned towards the darkness of the abyss keeping me trapped behind me. I jumped.

It was a dog walking couple further up the stream that apparently found me. The nurses told me that when they saw me, I wasn’t breathing. The boyfriend performed CPR on me for twenty minutes until the paramedics arrived. The hospital I was transported to didn’t have the tools to keep me alive for long – I was transferred to Bellevue. 

When my Mom heard the news, she booked a flight right away. She’d been by my side for the first two days when I wouldn’t wake up. When I finally did, I saw her smiling at me with tears in her eyes.

The nurses have been trying to get me to focus on rehabilitation so that my body can start recovering, but I couldn’t care less about that right now. All I could obsess over until today was figuring out if what I saw had been a dream, or an illusion, or some sort of fantasy, or if what I had experienced was real.

After being stubborn and telling the staff I’d refuse to eat, along with my Mom making a scene a few times, I was finally allowed to have my laptop back. Immediately I began searching the web for news.

A group of drunk college student had accidentally started a fire on the night I had been camping, in the same area I had set up shop by the lake. It hadn’t been a mirage at all. They were thought to have been the only ones who were victims – all dead. Thankfully, huge amounts of men from the city had been able to rush to the area and contain it before it ruined the whole state park. No one else had been hurt, as far as they been aware.

I’m resting my voice for now, as it’s still healing from the smoke. But when it does, I’ll tell my Mother what I saw. I’m convinced that it was real – that I really saw him. 

My father is still…alive doesn’t feel like the right word to use.

He’s still…. burning…he’s still somehow out there. Chasing us. 

Haunting us. Haunting me.

I … I don’t know why.

I can even begin to translate how this is all fucking with me.

What the hell could it even be? Is he a ghost now? Is he a demon? Is it inside my head? I’ve been spending all my time this week trying to search for any identical supernatural phenomenon from like legends and myths and media but there’s…nothing. I have no idea what’s going on.

Am I crazy?

Has anyone else experienced this?

Fuck.

I’m sorry I wish I had a better conclusion to all this but I don’t. I have no explanation for anything. But what I am sure of is that it’s real. Fires every year? Were those my Dad back then searching for Mom and I? How is that even possible.

I’ll leave with this:

If anyone in the greater Washington, Oregon, or Idaho areas – hell I’ll throw British Columbia too – has dealt with anything like this – please PM me. I can’t live my life like this…I’m desperate. Please…if anyone has anything…please.

I’m not crazy…

…

IM NOT FUCKING CRAZY.

My Dad isn’t dead. 

He’s still burning. 

And for whatever reason, still trying to find me.

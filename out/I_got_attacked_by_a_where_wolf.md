Hi! I think I got atacked by a where wolf when i was walking home from school today. I know it sounds strange but its the truth so let me tell u what hapenned. OK so i was walking home. it was about 5 pm and i had just finished school. the walk is about a mile and goes past some woulds which are by an abandoned rale road tracks. so i was walking past these woulds. they are very thick and the trees in them are very big and tall and it is dark in side it. It looks rather scarey so i have never been in them. 

anyways today it was rainey a bit so i was in a biger hurry then i usually am. out of the corner of my eye i see this shape moving out of the woulds to me. at first i thot it was just a strey dog but it looked much bigger. it's fur was all red and matted and it looked like it was very dirty and it didnt have a bath recently. i looked to see if there was a color on it's neck but i did not see one. it started out moving slowley to me and then it sudenly moved faster and i started running away because i thought it could have rabys or one of those other dangerous diseeses. 

but it was moving very fast like a cheeta and it was open me. it had a very bad smell like dogs get win they get wet out side in the rain and it wanted to make me up chuck. i was on the ground and it was on me and it's jaw was opened wide like you do at the dentist and it was driping saliva on me and i could tell that its teeth was very sharp and dangerous looking like knifes. i was very scared. 

anyways so i thought i was going to die and would be dead so i started preying. I tried to push it off of me but it was to big and strong. i would guess that it wayed 200 pownds. i started crying like a baby but then my silver ring that i wore on my left hand touched it's throat and it wimpered in payne and than it ran off back to the woulds. That is why I thot it was a where wolf becuz i think i red some where that where wolfs are afraid of silver like vampires do not like croses. 

so than i got up. i had some bruzes frum where i got nocked down but mostly i was un injured. but this was a very scarey sitoation and i wanted to share it. also i apologise for my speling and grammer as i am not a native speaker of english since I am not from the us and i was typing this on my phone were i turned off auto corect as it was geting anoying. than you

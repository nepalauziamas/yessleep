  

Long time ago, when I was a kid, I used to like playing the guitar and the piano, I used to have a band too, with some friends of mine. But then, my piano randomly started failing, so I went to some kind of second handed store to buy another one quite cheap.

It was really cheap, and when I went to pay for it, the seller told me to be careful with it, because the last owner died and all the town said that the piano she used to play was cursed. I have to say that, in that moment I didn’t believed in charms and all that stuff, until when everything happened.

It was a calmed Sunday, I wasn’t at work, I was at home, setting my new piano, but suddenly it started to play some type of some scary movie melody, I obviously got scared and then I went to check what just have happened, I checked all the house, but there was no one.

I was really scared, but I thought I imagined all those things, because I was really stressed about job, relationships, and family, all those things. So I didn’t care to much and keep on setting the piano, because I had nothing to do. Then a friend called me, and invited me to go to the bar and get some drinks, I accepted and went with him.

Then he asked me, what I was doing, I answered that I was setting my new piano, he asked me where I bought it, so I told him that I was really cheap in the second handed store, and he instantly recognized what piano I bought. He told me that it was such a mistake, that I shouldn’t had buy it because it was cursed, he told me to give it back, but I denied, I just had no money left to buy another one, and I had to practice with the band.

He told me that if something happened or anything, to immediately call the police or something, because it was cursed and something could happen to me or my cat. I told him that everything was going to be ok, that nothing would happen, that the magic doesn’t exist.

The next day, I went to the work and when I finished, I went with my band to practice, and then it happened, the thing that stills frightens me, the thing that stills giving me goosebumps.

Before we started practicing I checked my piano recorded music, and I found something, that terrifies me. It was some kind of nice grandma voice, those who gives you some hot milk and cookies before go to sleep. But it said that she was the last owner, then she said my name and that she was going to kill me soon. I was frightened and ran to the second handed store to give back my piano, but the seller pointed to the sign that said “no returns or refunds”.

I was scared, because, how can a dead woman knew that I would buy her piano, and where I lived.

Later that night, I was asleep in my room, but my cat didn’t, then I heard some weird noise downstairs, like if someone had broken a vase, I called my friend, and asked him what to do, he told me to calm down and go check if it has been my cat, I went down and checked. In the kitchen I found Charlie lying on the floor, along with a broken light bulb full of blood.

I immediately called the police and told them what happened, they told me I was crazy and that those things doesn’t happen and that Charlie’s death had been an accident. The next morning I called a kind of charm breaker, I don’t know, he told me that the last owner’s soul was there, and that he had to kill her but it was really difficult and expensive. I didn’t have money so I couldn’t afford to pay to him to kill her. 

Then nothing happened during like 5 months, just the fact that I heard voices in my mind during those months. But nothing over that things, so I got over it.

One day, I asked a girl out on a date, so when we were in my house, she told me that she felt some weird vibes and that she got to go, I convinced her to stay that night, because it was too late and dangerous outside. She stayed.

In the middle of the night, over 2 am, she woke up and went downstairs, then I heard a voice in my mind saying “you shouldn’t have invited her, you know what happened with your last guest”. I knew that something was about to happen to her, so I ran downstairs and I saw her taking a glass of water, I asked her what was she doing there at that hour, she told me that she was thirsty and went downstairs to drink some water.

Then  when she was drinking the water, I saw something opening the drawer and grabbing a knife and was pointing to her, like if that invisible thing was about to kill her. I told her to move quickly, she said that I was crazy, why would she do that. Then, the knife killed her. i didn’t knew what to do, so the voice said “it’s your turn”.

I knew that the old mad woman was about to kill me, so I went out running and screaming for help, the doors randomly locked, I don’t know how I went out in time and called the police, they said I was crazy, but my friends told him that I wasn’t, that the things I said were true.

The police checked the house and the marks on the knife that killed the girl I invited that night, they said I wasn’t guilty and started a special investigation.

No one found nothing.

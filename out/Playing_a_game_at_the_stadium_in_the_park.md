I had to play a match in the stadium from the park, the biggest and with the latest facilities in our area. Every team dreams of going there, but doing so was strange to say at least. After I made it out, I considered quitting the team, just for the sake of never ever coming back here. Here's what you should do if you ever have to attend any kind of event in there:

Never come by car. The stadium is in the park and, while the guard will allow your car to enter, good luck finding the exit back. It happened to some teammates of mine. They had to abandon their cars in there and those who didn't... well... I think they went insane, but hard to tell.

Stick to the main road. It's impossible to miss it. Literally, the biggest alley from the park. Do not attempt to take shortcuts or detours. for your own sake. Out of those who had, we had yet to see them again.

Once the playground area is finished, do not talk to anyone. Just to be safe, you shouldn't speak to anyone at all in the park. There's nothing i could give you about looking at them, but better be safe than be sorry. 

Do not stop. Not at all. No matter who asks you to stop and however they address you. Beware: they might come with tempting offers, from generous sums of money to bringing back the dead. Just ignore them. If you ignore them, they will not follow you. However if you don't and see them in the corner of your eye, make a run for it. You may get lucky. In my case, the tall man dressed in a yellow suit who tried to convince me to attend his church, lost interest in me pretty quickly. Or maybe it was because of the other athlete coming down the path. 

Do not be phased if the granny outruns you. She is harmless as long as you don't eye her from the front. You can stare at her second head all you want from the back, even listen to her voice, but once you're side by side with her, don't look. She will always appear with her back to you, as if you caught up with her, appearing she is a slow walker. She is not. If the distance between you is closing suspiciously much, start running. She will too. Try to stay behind her until the bridge. Then she will turn right towards the church.

At the bridge there are two buildings and right across it, the holy stadium. Ignore the abandoned mansion on the left. Ignore those waving and calling for help from the window. Ignore the constant flow of priests going from the church to the asylum and the fact they don't seem to ever exit. Just ignore it. As for the church on the right, you probably won't be eager to enter it given the demon-granny just took that way, adding the tall man urging me to go there in my case too, and you're mostly right. Although, if you wanna explore, go in, look around the first floor, then second floor, then the yard and exit on the same door you entered. It is crucial you remember the door you entered. Else, you might just become a priest going to the asylum, but I can't guarantee it. Do not mistake it for anything religious and do not pray. It is quite the opposite. Do not disturb grandma praying with her back to you and if you wander where's her second head now, just peek in the silver bowl from the center. Be sure to face the south when doing this. Remember the rule above. 

If you want to take pictures, take only with the church in the background. And don't stop to look at them. If you however snap the asylum, run. If you're athletic, maybe you'll make it to the stadium by the start of the acid rain. 

Remember you have to run if there's anything chasing you.

Once you reach the stadium's parking lot, don't believe you are safe. As long as you're not in the car, the electronic gate won't open. Do not attempt to use the manual one. The asylum creatures eyeing your every move don't know how to use it. Don't be the one to teach them. Try to crawl under the electronic gate. Do it quick, for however was chasing you probably still is.

Enter the stadium and thank whoever you believe is worthy of that you made it alive. You can do whatever now. Change in the locker rooms, play the game. Just keep in mind all games finish at 6. You have to be finished by then. If not, hope you like to play the floor is lava. Literally. By 7 you must be out. Changed and showered and with everything you brought on you. It's crucial you don't forget anything because while you may not find it again, it will find you again and you won't like it. 

Do not wait up on your teammates or friends or hell, even family, if they're gonna be later than 7. You just walk through the front door out. Note that when you came in, you used the back door. The front door reveals the street. You're gonna be safe in the street, or at least safer than in the park. We sadly had to leave our coach behind. He wasn't quick enough and we were just too tired to play the floor, the walls and the ceiling is lava.

After you exit, do not look back and don't tell your friends what was written on the sign above the door until you lose its sight. Mine said "pastry" even though it was clearly a stadium...

If you see someone attempting to exit on the back door, do not warn him. They may have their reasons. You go on the front door out in the street. Also, do not try to correct anyone on the rules once you're in the park. Again, they may have their reasons, or not be who you think they are. 

That's about it. I have yet to experience anything than that. As long as you follow the list, you should be able to go in and out for as many times as you want. I for one don't think I will go back there soon...

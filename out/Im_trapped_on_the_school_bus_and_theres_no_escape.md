School that day had been stressful, so I was ready to go home. My mom was working late that day, so I had to take the school bus. When I got on the bus, the first thing I noticed was the bus driver. He had a hoodie on, covering his whole face with shade, and he was breathing heavily, I just rubbed it off and sat in a seat. Some other kids got on the bus, then we pulled off from the school. It was pretty loud, so I decided to plug in my headphones to drown out the noisy kids. My stop is the last one, so all of the other people will be off before me, it was gonna take a while to get to my stop. It got pretty boring, so I took out my headphones and took a nap, I figured the bus driver would let me know when we were at my bus stop. 

When I woke up, it was quiet. Everyone else was gone. It was finally peaceful. I looked at my phone, and it was 4:28 PM. We would be at my bus stop at about 4:35. I looked out the window, and noticed an empty road, no cars, trees, clouds, or any other buildings. “That’s odd..” I thought. I noticed that we were heading for a road tunnel, but I didn’t go that way to get to my stop. I went up to the bus driver and asked him where we were. He looked up at me, staring…I think. I couldn’t see his eyes. When I spoke to him, he flinched like he forgot I was there. He started to speak in an old and croaky voice. “Pardon me, I forgot you were here, I’ll take you to your stop right away!” 
I nodded and sat back down. I checked my phone to see if anyone had called me while I was asleep, but then I noticed that it was STILL 4:28. A lot of shock rushed through my body. The bus turned through the tunnel, and right out. We were still on the empty road, nothing that connected to any life. 

I tried to calm myself down, and called my mom. She answered, and I started telling her what was going on. She started laughing, saying that I watch too many horror movies. Something inside me hung up on her. I asked the bus driver if he could just drop me off where we were. No response. I checked my phone, still 4:28 PM. I managed to snap a picture of the road, and sent it to my mom. She didn’t believe me. I was gonna go insane. I lunged for the doors and I got a big flash in my eyes, before I was back in my seat. This was driving me crazy. I had to get out of there. 

I ran up to the bus driver and smacked him. I took over the wheel, and tried to turn. The wheel was jammed. The bus driver grabbed my shoulder, I looked at him. It was me, with bloodshot eyes? What the hell is this?! I grabbed the handle to open the doors and I leaped out. Landing onto the road, as the bus drove away. The ground cracked below me. I couldn’t breathe. I felt like I was dying. I had nothing left, I got flashed in the eyes again as I closed them. I opened my eyes to see the bus again. I was back on the bus. I frantically looked at the window. I see everything. It was normal. I checked my phone. 4:29 PM. 
The driver dropped me off at my stop. 
When I got home, I called my mother. I confronted her about the things she said. She told me I never called her.

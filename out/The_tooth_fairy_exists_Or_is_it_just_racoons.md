The tooth Fairy exists!! or is it just a racoon?

*Day 1*: 2007, Sicily, at the time I was 9 years old, I can't remember much but it still frightens me, it was a stormy night of winter, at dinner, one of my teeths falls out and I rush immediately to the bathroom with my dad. Afterwards my mom and brother also come check out. Gradually the conversation between all of my family transform into something between my father and my mother which I don't know what was about because I didn't really care at all about what my parents said when I was young. Secretly, i take my tooth and hide it under the pillow and then run immediately to the bathroom again and close the door. The conversation kept going on for hours and hours. Boredom was dominating my mind so I decided to go to sleep but magically, 20 euros (19.88 USD for the Americans) appear. It was a shocking surprise since even I, believed that the tooth fairy didn't exist as it was something crazy to exist, who thinks this that a tiny little fairy, has wings to fly across the room, grab our teeth, replace it with money and then fly away. And mostly, what is she supposed to do with our teeth? It was crazy and I rushed to my father to tell him what happened but he ignored me... I tell my mom and brother about it and they joke about it saying I just picket it from our piggy bank. No one believed me which was right because it's impossible for it to happen.

 I return to bed and fall asleep. I wake up in the middle of the night, as I saw a big black shadow coming from our balcony, I take my flashlight and go check what it is, as soon I get close... It's gone. Maybe it was a random bird but it couldn't be right because the shadow had a really strange shape. It's almost like as if he was trying to communicate something, desperate for help, it was something abstract, maybe it was some random dude passing by my house but it's also not a reasonable answer because if it was some random dude, why he'd stare at my balcony? If it was, it was probably just some creep. Back in my bed and after hours of trying to find out what was that strange shadow without finding a reasonable answer, i fall asleep again. I try wake up my mother but she scolds me as if being awake at 2 am was normal. I finally fall asleep. *Day 2*: It's 7 AM and I keep hearing noises and bumps on my balcony as if the shadow of that night, was here to try communicate. Grab my flashlight and go out of the house. I go check and turns out... It was just a bunch of racoons rummaging for supplies in my trash bin... Just one stomp and they all went running!!! I jump to the conclusion that it was just the raccoons. Who swapped my tooth with money though?...

The end... Or continue?

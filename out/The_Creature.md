“Things do not happen. Things are made to happen.” John F Kennedy 



This story took place in my old hometown in 1989 Carbondale, Illinois. My good friend Brian Coldwell, who was 23 at the time, was sitting in his red Camaro waiting for the race to start. At the referee's signal he blazes off to the cheering of the crowd.



After a 10 minute long race, Brian won 1st place. And of course we did what any young men would to celebrate, hitting the bar. 


"Where's Josh?" Chase asked 


“Dunno but he's missin out big time,” Brian said 


“You sure?” I said, coming out of the bathroom, stumbling around buzzed while walking over to them.


“Shit bro where the hell have you been?” Brian asked


“Where do you think?” 


I was the more "down-to-earth'' kind of a friend if  you catch my drift and the typical greaser punk. Tall and athletic, standing at 6’4 with brown hair. Dressed in blue jeans, a black leather jacket, black combat boots, and a white t-shirt. 


“So racer boy, where's my beer?” I asked as Brian sighed, already knowing precisely how I got when I didn't get my hands on some alcohol.


“Hey baby, could you get me and my bro some rounds here please!” I hollered to the bartender


“How about you learn some manners first?” She replied


“How bout you shut your trap before I shut it for ya?" 


Yeah I was a quite colorful guy back then.


She didn't say anything, giving me a dirty look before leaving. I gave her the finger in return. 



“Josh, you do realize she is gonna tell her boss that you swore at her right?” Chase said worriedly 


“Ah I don't give 2 shits, the fuckin slut didn't bring my beer. You know what happens when I don't get my beer don't ya? Besides, I said please.”


"Yeah let's just have a good time ok man?” Chase moped 


After a long night of partying and drinking, we left the bar with Chase as the designated driver. As we walked to my black SUV, we suddenly saw a large glowing object soaring in the sky which quickly caught our eye.


"The hell was that?!" I exclaimed, spooked as it crashed into a nearby Forest. 


"Looks like it touched down there. Let's check it out,” Brian said 


“Are you crazy? My ass is not going down there” Chase protested


He was usually the rational voice of wisdom of the group. The typical nerdy smart kid so to speak. He always tried to settle problems without confrontation, in contrast to me.


“Oh quit acting like a whiny bitch, we're going down there,” I replied, taking another sip of my beer can. 


We went down to the site and found a brownish-gray meteor in a large crater.

The meteor was surprisingly quite smaller than we expected. A black, gooey tar-like mass was spewing inside the gaping hole of the rock.


“What the hell, what is that shit?” I said 


“Nasty” Chase replied


“Looks like something that came out of my Old Man's ass during the war.” Brian said 


Brian then goes to retrieve a stick before poking at the strange substance. It did nothing for the first 16 seconds before it started to bubble, almost immediately traveling up the stick and onto Brian's left hand.


"The fuck, get this crap off me!” Brian said


I pulled out my switchblade, trying to cut it off. The efforts proved naught as the blade began to sizzle like a hamburger on a grill as it melted into liquid metal, forcing me to drop it. 



"It broke my knife"  I said, shocked at this development


With all of us shitting bricks, Chase took charge of the situation. 


“That's it, we're taking him to the hospital right now,” Chase said  



Throughout the ride, Brian started complaining that the enveloped hand was starting to hurt like a son of a bitch. As he was next to me in the back seat I looked at his arm, now covered in even more of this black tar shit. 


"Josh, call my girlfriend for me. Please." Brian moaned as I did just that. 


"He's getting worse, floor it Chase!" I commanded 


It seemed like hours until we finally arrived at the hospital. We ran like Olympic sprinters to the receptionist's desk. 


“Uhh excuse me miss, my friend has some sort of mass on his hand. Could we get a doctor please?” Chase said, showing her Brian's arm. 


Immediately frightened by the tar like substance, she swiftly compiled as Brian was laid on the stretcher. We watched him disappear into the hallway to his room as we sat in the waiting room. 



Shortly after Brian is admitted, his girlfriend Maggie entered sobbing hysterically.


“Josh what happened to Brian?” Maggie cried, distressed


She was pretty, tiny but slim with long flowing brown hair and amber eyes.


“We saw some meteor and we went to check it out, then some black shit went all over his hand. He's in the ER now but they won't let us see him” Chase replied


“What? Is this some kind of a prank?" She asked, Initially and understandably sceptical of what we encountered. 


"We saw the gunk go up his arm, we're not bullshitting at all." I replied. 


An hour later Chase and I decided to sneak into Brian's room to check up on him. 


"Maggie, me and Josh are gonna sneak into his room to see if they got that crap off his hand. You make sure no one sees us.” Chase said


"Alright, be careful,” Maggie said, 


*We will” I assured her


When we went into the room I noticed something was moving under Brian's blanket. Wondering what the hell was going on, I pulled it off and to our horror, we witnessed his melted, horrifically burnt body steaming and sizzling on the bed but the thing was nowhere to be seen. He looked like he was soaked in Napalm as he was practically fused to the bed. 


"Oh my God!" Chase yelled


"Call the police, I'll get the doctor!"


I ran out to get Maggie first while Chase called the sheriff. She was sitting on a chair reading a magazine as I kicked the door down. 


"Maggie get up, it's Brian, something's happened." 


"What? What are you talking about?" She asked as I took her hand and tugged her off the chair.


"Hurry!" I shouted as we ran to Brian's room. The woman at the desk shouted at us as she and others ran close behind. When we arrived inside, Maggie and the nurse saw his body. Chase vomited onto the floor as we came in. 


"Any luck, did you reach anyone?" I asked him


"Yeah, the cops are on their way." 


The receptionist woman behind us and a couple other nurses were too terrified to even move, frozen in fear. 



“Brian, no!!!” Maggie screamed as she collapsed sobbing on the floor. I enveloped her in a hug as she held onto me tight. 


"Someone get security down here." Quivered one of the nurses as I saw the receptionist vomit as well. 


While we all stood there, Chase was stiff as a board, looking up at the ceiling. Me and Maggie walked up to see what the problem was, only to see the black slime monster oozing on the ceiling. It was now the size of a person as it propelled itself towards us. Me and Maggie managed to evade it but Chase wasn't as fortunate. 


His whole body was engulfed by the monster as he screamed inside it. We could all see the outline of his face. The nurses tried to intervene but the thing grew these thick tentacles, knocking them back. Never in my then 24 years of life was I so afraid of anything in my life. The word fear was not enough to describe the alien we were all looking at. 


“Chase!” I screamed as me and Maggie tried to pull him out of the monster, failing miserably as his arms tore off, sending us down to the floor. The creature then escaped via a window. 


An hour later, the hospital was closed by police for investigation. They questioned us and the nurses present about what killed Chase and Brian. They initially did not believe us when we "claimed" an Alien slime creature killed them despite the 3 nurses who vouched for us. Nonetheless we were all free to go. 


I needed a minute to collect my thoughts as Maggie stood by her car parked next to mine, smoking a cigarette. Chase, Brian two of my best friends, gone overnight. 


“Maggie, I know you've just been through a lot tonight. So uh, you want a ride home." I awkwardly offered, bringing my left hand behind my head. 


"Sure, thanks, I don't think I'll be able to walk without vomiting."


It was mostly silent the whole ride. Thank God Maggie wasn't much of a talker. Outside of my usual drunken antics, normal conversation wasn't in my field of expertise. 


"He was like a brother to me, Maggie. We knew each other ever since 3rd grade. Now he's, you know. Mark my words, we are gonna make that bastard pay tomorrow. But for right now we're going to need all the rest we can get.” Josh said


"Ok Rambo, how do you think we'll do that?" She asked 


"I'll figure out something. My uncle fought in Nam and he'll have the shit we'll need. For this kinda situation I'd say call the National Guard but no one's gonna believe us."


"You have a point, I don't want to take Brian and Chase's deaths lying down." She replied


We finally pulled up to her driveway. She gave me a hug before getting out.


"Oh and um, I'm sorry about what happened. If you need anyone to talk to, you know who to call." I blurted out


"Thank you, that really means a lot Josh." Maggie smiled as she walked towards her door, looking back at me for a second. 


"Be safe" 


"You too" She said 


I drove on into the direction of the nearest bar.

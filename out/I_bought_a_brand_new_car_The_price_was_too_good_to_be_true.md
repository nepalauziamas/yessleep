Ding. Ding, ding.

I had just opened the door to my brand new car. Well, it was new to me. The guy who sold me the car called it, "Practically new." It had less than 3500 miles on it, and came with all the bells and whistles. Heated seats, front and back. Cooled seats too. A navigation system, a heads up display, lane assist, surround cameras with a night time driving assistant, 19 inch rims, a gorgeous red interior and glossy white paint on the outside.

The ad had the price well below market value and the guy seemed eager to sell it. He was mid 30s, had ashen brown hair, a nervous pair of eyes, and kept scratching at his neck. If there was a word I'd describe him as, it would be Nocturnal. My dad said crackhead though.

It was the middle of the day and the sun beat a tan into my shoulders when we arrived. Even though the price was so low. And I really wanted the car. My dad told me to take another 15% off the initial offer. I was hesitant, but listened.

The guy didn't even fight us, "Do you have the money on you right now?"

I showed him the Benjamins.

After our transaction my dad looked at me and beamed, "Shit, we could have probably gotten an extra grand or two less than what we offered." He shook his head while circling the vehicle, "I'll never understand why some people buy brand new cars and sell them a few months later." His hands outstretched, displaying the hood, "Would you look at this thing kiddo?"

I've always had an older car up until now. Cloth seats, hand rolled windows, and an engine that worked on prayer. That it was weird when I began worrying about my car. Having previously letting nature's car wash clean my vehicle, I found myself doing it by hand on Saturdays. I even used an easy nanowax to preserve the paint. And always going the extra mile to park it far away from other cars as possible.

It was on one such night that I had parked really far away, and was walking alone back to the lot, in the dark, that I began to question my life choices, "Why can't you just be normal? Park like a normal person does. Why'd you have to park the car as if you were hiding it? Dummy..."

A lamp post glowed in the dark, illuminating the many empty spots.

There weren't so much as another car or person in sight. The lot was flat so if there were someone hiding in the dark, at least I could see them coming. I don't know if that last thought made me feel any better as I have never been a fast runner in my life.

As I started evaluating my footwear in case of an emergency, I looked up to see my car come into view. I nearly tripped as I noticed it. I had deliberately parked so very far away so that no one else would possibly think about parking next to me. Low and behold, the only other car in the entire lot, was parked directly next to mine. Not only that, the person who had parked it was shimmied right next to my driver's side.

I peered down the waist thin space between the two vehicles and realized that my door couldn't even open. I looked down and saw the other vehicle's tire cross the parking line by nearly a foot, "Of course."

I walked over to the passenger side and opened the door, throwing my purse, my backpack, and the stack of books into the back. Then I clambered inside, crab walking over the center console before collapsing into the driver's seat.

I started the car and immediately the sensors beeped into my ear. I looked at the console and saw all the arrows blaring a deep red to my left. I winced as I slowly started backed out, making sure my mirror wouldn't hit the other car.

I hear another beep and see a wispy white figure appear on my screen. I nearly screamed as I slammed on the brakes and turned around.

Some guy wearing shorts and a graphic tee strode behind me. He shot me a look as he got into the car next to mine. He started it up and music blared into the night. With a quick clunk, no look back, he shifted into reverse, blocking my path, and then drove off.

I looked at my center console, glad to see it clear of any warnings as I backed out and left the parking lot.

I hadn't been driving for more than a few miles when the console beeped another warning. I glanced over and saw a wisp of red emerge in front of me. I looked ahead and saw steam rising out of a manhole.

The light ahead of me skipped yellow and turned red. I brought the car to a stop. The entire street was empty, typical of the business side of town after dark, "Come on. Where are all the traffic sensors when you need it?"

I wait for a few minutes but the light didn't change, "Why me," I flicked on my blinker and made a right turn. I've never gone down this way but figured that if I made two more lefts and then another right, I'd be back on track.

I was driving down this lonely stretch of road when my night time driving assistant warned me of heat signatures coming from between two buildings. I rubbernecked to the the right to peer down the alley as I passed.

BEEP BEEP BEEP!

The alarm came from in front. I looked up just in time to slam on my brakes. I watched as a large plastic ball tottered through the walking lane. A young boy chasing after it. His parents behind them pushing a pram as my tires squealed to a halt. I looked up afraid to meet their eyes. But eventually waving a guilty hand at them in apology.

They didn't even look at me.

Just walked silently past.

It was weird seeing a family out at this hour, near this part of town. Even more odd were their clothing. The man was in a full 3 piece suit and the woman had on a long frilly dress that was covered in soft pink.

I was about to crane my neck to see where they were headed but the light above me turned green and so I made a left turn. I was greeted by a long stretch of road that I had never seen before and a tall brick wall with a wrought iron gate that lined my right side. I couldn't see past the bricks as the lawn that sat above it had created a dense fog.

This street was also long and empty, it was so long that I couldn't see the next stop light in front of me.

I kept driving, the spooling of my turbo hissing into the night with each prompt shift. I reached my hand forward to turn on some music so that I wouldn't feel so alone, but I needn't have bothered. On my screen I see 3 white dots emerge up ahead.

I glance up at the road, my hand dead in the air as it stops short of the knob.

I couldn't see anyone. I really hoped they weren't trying to cross the street. I adjusted my glasses and reached for the radio again. I looked down and noticed that more white dots had appeared on my screen.

Again I look up and see no one ahead.

I really hope this thing wasn't broken. Maybe that is why the guy had sold it to me. The car was a lemon? Before I could worry about the financial impact of it all, I looked at the center console and noticed that a horde of white dots had formed in front of me. Instinctively my foot edged over to the brake as I looked up.

Nothing.

Not a single living person in front of me.

"Maybe it's the fog," I looked to my right. "Maybe it's broken," I looked at the console. "I really hope it's not broken." This time I reached for the radio knob, pressing it down firmly.

"This is KCR1 coming at you with...playing this next....kep kep kre-"

The radio cut off, and the lights around the console dimmed. I looked at the wheel and peered through the small window between the spokes at my dashboard. All of the check lights were lit up. I pressed my foot back on the gas but the car began to slow down. I looked at my shifter and a prominent orange 'D' indicated that I was still in gear.

I hear the engine churning, clunking, as it grinds to a halt.

"Oh god, what did I do?"

I looked around the cabin searching for clues. What I was looking for, I had no idea. I depleted the brake and pushed the shifter back into park. I then tried to restart the car. The engine sputtered and my headlights blinked.

The hood on the engine shook as it tried to come alive.

"No, no no no."

I tried the button again.

Nothing.

I slammed my palms into the steering wheel and recoiled slightly as they stung.

"Ok," I breathed, "This is why we have insurance. I'll just give them a call and-"

Beep.

Beep. Beep.

Beep. Beep Beep beeep beep beep.

I looked up and noticed that parts of the fog had rolled over the raised brick to my right, and spilled out onto the sidewalk. Not a person in sight but a look at my console showed a litter of white dots forming on the screen.

Beep. Beep. Beep.

The sounds of the alarm bleeding into my ear as I swiveled my head in panic. A glance down showed that the white dots had gotten closer. The first few beginning to turn into white wisps as they were close enough to image. My eyes were glued to the screen as I watched one of the wisps growing. It was long and gangly, its arms near its knees as it walked closer, 8 feet, 7, 6.

I looked up and saw nothing but the long dark street ahead.

I pressed down on my horn, the thing honked like a choked goose struggling to breathe, I could see my eyes widening in the rearview mirror as panic rose into my throat. I punched the horn again to hear it squeal. And to my horror, more white dots appeared on the screen as if I was drawing them in.

I tried to start the car again but to no avail. I reached into the back with my eyes still glued to the windshield, my hands searching desperately for my bag as the sensors kept beeping. The green arrows in front of me started blinking yellow. I hit the console with my free hand and I must have pressed something because my heads up display glowed in the night. Showing the lane in front of me in crisp colored lines.

The white dots gathered on my windshield kept getting closer. I screamed as the arrows bled red and a thump came onto the front of my hood. I looked at the console and saw a trail of white light and the big bold lettering: WARNING WARNING WARNING on the display.

I pried open the door handle and ran out of the car.

I kept running as I headed down the street, lights began to come into view. I screamed when I saw someone walking. They looked at me startled as I lunged after them. The girl nearly fell as she turned and began to run away.

I looked behind me, afraid that something had followed me.

But there was nothing there.

I realized it must have been me. Running toward her, screaming my head off in the middle of the night. So I slowed down and tried to catch my breath as I approached the next person, "My car stopped running. Please. I need to use your phone," I blurted out.

By the time a towing truck had arrived, dawn was breaking in the horizon.

As we were headed toward my car I could see the brick walls coming into view, stretches of green grass behind it. I had been expecting a cemetery but was surprised to see a golf course.

I could see white golf balls flying in the air and little white carts patrolling the perimeter. When we stopped in front of my car, I looked across the way and saw that I was directly adjacent to the course's driving range. A dozen balls were arching in the sky toward us, some landing a few feet short of the property line.

I shook my head and almost laughed.

I finally did laugh when the car roared alive behind me as the tow truck driver had given it a test before putting it onto the back of the bed. He shook his head, "Works just fine." He handed me back the keys and left.

I got back inside my vehicle and was happy to see that there were no more warning lights. And now I could see the little white dots lining the console. I looked up and saw a loose golf ball or two as well in the sky.

Satisfied I began driving home. I pulled onto my street and opened my garage door, pulling into my house.

I hear the familiar beep of the front bumper as I get into my parking spot, and smile at myself for being overtly dramatic. My giggling turned into a gut wrenching laugh as I pressed my forehead against the steering wheel.

I had finally caught my breath, the sides of my mouth hurting from smiling when I looked up at the center console. It was still beeping. The arrows in front of me had nearly stopped but a single white dot had appeared from behind me. I looked into the rearview mirror, and saw nothing but the slant in my driveway. I looked down at the console again, the dot had grown into a wisp.

Beep. Beep BEEP BEEP.

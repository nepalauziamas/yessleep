It started on the night of May 5th, 2022. I am yet to confirm the origins, the modus operandi, and most importantly the weakness of this entity. I'll use this page as a journal to record and analyze my interactions with the entity so far.  


I do not have a confirmed course of action as to how I summoned this being, but my supposed assumption is that I perhaps might have invoked/summoned it by mistake. I will pen down my assumed actions that might have led to the invocation of this entity:

* At roughly about 19:40-19:50: I recall having watched on Youtube a video titled "Summon Slender Man", the uploader claiming that it is a cursed video that sends out a calling to the being known as Slender Man. (Note: I may partially debunk this hypothesis on two basis:

1. My friends Jon and Srikshit watched it too, they have had initially difficulty in sleeping, but nothing to extent that might drive them to the edge of insanity or that they begin to hear/see/experience unexplained events/beings.
2. 2.The entity I seemingly have summoned is nowhere similar to Slender Man in terms of the available description of the latter on the internet, however, there have been some similarities in terms of the "hellish" visions and dreams that I experience.)  


* At 1:05-1:25: I engaged in preparing a sherbet of sorts, called ghol in my mother tongue, Bengali. It is a sweet drink that I was craving for owing to the terrific heatwaves of the summer, temps touching almost 40C that night.  

* I scoop in 3 teaspoons of powdered sugar, 1 teaspoon of salt, 2 teaspoons of lime juice and fill up half of the glass with curd which I then proceed to mix thoroughly, before filling up the rest half with ice cold water and then stirring the contents again. I sip a bit and realize it was lacking the essence of lime. I go back to look in the refrigerator for some leftover lime slices but found none so I proceeded to cut a life by myself. I took one out, positioned it directly over the glass and tried to slice it in half with the knife.  

* Accidentally, I cut onto my thumb supporting the lime and I had a nasty wound bleeding into the contents of the glass. I put everything on the table and rush to the washroom, adjacent to my room. I close the door behind me, put some antiseptic on my thumb and band aid it to stop the bleeding.  
(On returning to my room, I notice the sherbet was gone and the glass was empty. I try to comprehend what must have happened and try to look for any evidences of spillage. I was gone for about 5 minutes or so and even if the sherbet tripped over onto the floor somehow, it was impossible for it to dry up in such a short time frame. I do not think much of it as it was late already and I had my microeconomics exam the next day. I was tired after a day of cramming in on the indifference curves, consumption, expenditure, etc.)  

* 1:30: I was in bed trying to fall asleep listening to Dead Memories by Slipknot. (I have not ruled out the instance of this song playing a hand in summoning the entity because of the associated hallucinations/interactions/nightmares I would go on to have over the next couple of days.)

I have a nightmare on that night as I drifted into sleep.

Short bursts of sleep with vivid/lucid dreaming. I am not so accurate scientifically but REM (rapid eye movement) doesn't set in until the first 90 minutes of the dream. I remember waking up at 4:02 a.m. sitting up on bed with a sharp pain on my chest.  


The sky had turned light blue and sunlight would have seeped in through the curtains soon. I made a decision to not sleep, even in the mild darkness of the room anymore. I sat down with my microeconomics book, I would sleep in the afternoon after taking my exam.  


On opening the chapter of Income and Supply, the one I had been studying last night, I find imprints on the pages resembling the scale marks of a snake. It was disturbing and stinky but I had no time to worry about a mystery before an exam. Little did I know, it would turn out to be one of the very first tangible evidence to be left out by the haunting creature.  


I shall document my experiences, if any are to occur tonight, with tangible evidence while I keep writing down and maintain an archive of the past incidents.

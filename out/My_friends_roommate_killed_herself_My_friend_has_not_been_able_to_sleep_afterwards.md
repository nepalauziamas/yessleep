  

I wanted to share an incident that happened to you guys. I don’t know what's happening or is it safe to share this with you but i feel like i want to talk to someone. I am not using any real names here just because of the obvious reasons. 

My name is Jessica. I'm a graduate student and i have a best friend named Catherine aka Cathy. Talking about Cathy, she is a very wonderful person. She is very kind and friendly to everyone. Everyone liked her positive attitude. Even though she has lots of “friends", she wanted my company always. Everything was going smoothly till last month when there was an argument between Cathy and her roommate Mary. I never liked Mary in the first place and felt like she has many secrets. One day they had a heated exchange and something Cathy said upset her. Then next day, Cathy found Mary's dead body in her bedroom. Apparently Mary committed suicide. It was a huge shock for Cathy and she was not at all feeling well afterwards. She wanted to move out of the apartment as soon as possible but she couldn't find any suitable places nearby. 

That afternoon, i was in the library completing some works then Cathy came by. I noticed that she is looking pale and exhausted.

“Everything’s fine? You look tired” 

“i know ! I haven't slept for few days.! "

“Cathy, i know things went south. But it’s not your fault she killed herself she mi ...."

“I can’t just sleep! I feel like someone is always watching me all the time. Whenever i dose off, i feel like someone's with me! In my bed! I am having nightmares. I can't be there alone. "

“Cathy, what are you saying? Who is watching you? Mary?" 

“It’s not a joke. I thought you can help me"

Then her phone rang. She didn’t attend the call

“i am sorry. Anyways you need some rest. I am going to my parents’ home. Why don't you tag along? You can meet my parents. It will be fine" 

She was okay with it. My parents don't have any issues with a guest. Cathy's phone rang again. I saw the frustration in her face when she heard the ringtone. 

“Who is it?" 

“It’s Gary. I don’t want to talk to him anymore” 

Gary aka Gareth is Cathy's boyfriend. He is one of the worst people I've ever met. He is toxic, abusive and a big bully. I don’t even understand why Cathy liked him. His friends are even worse. Cathy has lots of issues right now. Gary is not helping her at all but making her life more difficult.

We reached my home at around 8 o'clock. After dinner, i showed Cathy her room upstairs. Cathy wanted me to sit next to her bed till she sleeps so that she would feel safe. I was tired with the long drive and the studies so i dosed off too in my chair. 

A phone call woke me up after few minutes. It was John, one of our classmates. Cathy was still sleeping. I picked up the call. John said that Garry has headed to my home searching for Cathy and he will be there any minute now. I said i will manage it and hung up the call but in fact i was not sure what to do. I can call the police if he makes a scene here. It’s my house after all. 

Suddenly i heard a roar of a motorcycle engine from outside. It was Gary. He was drunk and he stormed into my house. He was stopped by my father and this and Gary didn’t like it. 

“i am here to see my girlfriend " he said

“Who Cathy? She is sleeping why don't you leave her alone and come back tomorrow morning?" My father asked

Gary was fuming. He pointed his finger at my father and said “don’t tell me what to do old man! Let me see her or else" 

“Or else what?” 

I am watching all these from upstairs. I became nervous. My father isn't a pushover at any means but i don't think he can go hand to hand with a young 6'5 college athlete. 

"Let him come” i heard Cathy's voice. She seemed determined. 

Gary heard this and came to our room

“Cathy, why don't you pick up my calls?”

“You don't understand, do you? I've been through a lot. Why can't you just leave me alone?" She started crying. I quickly grabbed to consoler her.

“Cathy? You don’t love me??"

“No i don’t! Not anymore! Now leave me alone. I don't want to see you again!"

Gary was silent and tried to leave. But before he left the room he paused and looked at us

“don’t think its over you bitch" he said with an evil grin " i will make you pay. You will see what I'm up to"

He left. I was going to say something to her but then i heard a thud. When we went out to see what happened, we saw Gary lying motionless on the floor. He might have tripped someway along the stairs and banged his head. We suddenly called an ambulance and reached the hospital. 

We waited few hours at the hospital to know what's happening. Gary’s friends reached there too. I felt bad for Cathy. All she wanted was some rest but her circumstances won't even allow it. 

I saw my father talking to the doctor. He looked upset and he came to us 

“That kid is no more"

I was shocked. Gary is dead? I checked to see Gary’s friend’s reactions. While they were talking they were staring at us. Cathy started crying and my father said that we should go home now. We walked to the empty parking lot and we saw Gary's friends waiting for us there. 

“Tell us what happened” One of them shouted

“We don't know. He just fell down “i said

“Bullshit! You killed him! You both killed him and to hell with you!”

Then i noticed baseball bats and hockey sticks in their hands. They raised their hands to strike us. I was scared and in split second, i closed my eyes then felt like a light flickered out of nowhere .I heard them screaming. I opened my eyes to see that they have been struck by a lightning.  Shocked by this, Cathy fainted at the sight. The lightning killed Gary’s friends.

So i was in a hospital room, keeping an eye on Cathy, who was sleeping. Doctor said she is okay but needs some rest. They gave her some medications and some vitamin tablets. I was thinking about the events surrounding Cathy. First her roommate killed herself, and then Gary fell down the stairs and died. Then Gary's mates struck by lightning in front of us but we are totally safe. I can’t believe that all of these are pure coincidental. Then it came to my mind. Who knows if Cathy's roommate killed herself or not? What if it was a murder? What if all these deaths are connected? Thinking all these, I was almost asleep when i saw a figure standing next to Cathy. I was in a dreamy state and couldn't confirm if it was a hallucination or reality. It was a man. It was a man, who is probably 25 years old, wearing dark clothing. Something from his attire makes me feel he's not from this time. I feel like i have seen his face many times. But still don’t know who he is! He kissed Cathy in her forehead and looked at me. Those eyes! Felt like my blood froze. Felt like he smiled and said something to me even though his mouth never moved. He walked slowly to the balcony and vanished from my sight. I snapped out of the dreamy state and rushed to the balcony. It was 12th floor of the building and no way he could jump from there and walk away. Then i checked the door. It was locked and i remember locking it from inside before i went to sleep. I thought it might have been a dream and let it go. 

Few weeks passed. The vision of that strange man near Cathy’s bed still haunts me. I remember Cathy talking about someone with her when she is trying to sleep. But Cathy is fine now. Found a better roommate and she is happy now. We were on a trip and the bus was at a station. 

“Can I ask you something?’ Cathy asked seriously and I nodded. 

“When I was in the hospital that day, was there anyone with us?”

“No. Why?”

“Nothing. It’s funny. Felt like someone kissed on my forehead. Might be a dream”

I was really shocked when she said this. So it wasn’t a dream after all. I just smiled and didn’t say anything and looked outside the window. But what I saw was even more terrifying. It was him! He was standing right next to our window staring at me! I was out of words and felt like he smiled. I called Cathy to look but then he was gone! Like totally vanished! I didn’t say anything to Cathy so she won’t be freaked out. Then it happened! A piece of paper flew into my hands. This was written in it

“Thank you for keeping the secret.

Keep it that way or you will pay

NEVER tell her! I will keep in touch”

As soon as I completed reading, it flew out of the window. Now I am convinced it was not a dream, not a vision, but a reality.  I saw him at different places when I was with Cathy in the coming days, watching us from afar. I was scared to tell this to anyone. When Cathy said someone is watching her, was it him? Cathy doesn’t know this. Why is he stalking Cathy? Who is he really?

[\[Part 2\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/a5kt33/im_a_therapist_and_my_patient_is_going_to_be_the/)

A few weeks later, once they moved the bodies and resumed classes, I started clearing out my desk.

Yeah, I got fired.

They always fire the therapist when stuff like this happens. "Should have seen it coming," they say. "All the signs were there."

No kidding.

But it's the school's reason for termination that still burns in my mind: "Reckless behavior resulted in needless tragedy."

It almost sounded like the whole thing was *my* fault.

Maybe I was reckless, I don't know. Sure, it was the opposite of what you're supposed to do in an active shooter situation. But at least I tried.

If you really want to know what happened after the fire alarm went off, I've shared my version of events below. But as you're already quite aware, it's not a happy ending.

\* \* \*

"Call him," I said.

"What?" Alex raised his eyebrows.

"If you really want to stop this, take out your phone and call him."

He looked hesitant, but he took out his phone. "What am I supposed to say?"

"Tell him you escaped with one of the officer's guns, and you want him to wait for you -- to join in the fun."

The last part made me sick to say, but this had to sound real.

"That's crazy--"

"NOW, Alex."

Just as he held up the phone to his ear, one of the resource officers burst into the room. I hurried over to him and whispered, "It's not Alex."

"What?"

"There's a second shooter," I said, as Alex mumbled into his phone. "You need to be quiet and let him make this call."

"No, I -- I can't do that." He stepped forward, but he looked terrified. "We need to wait for the police."

I moved in his way. "Listen. At best, the library is a sixty second sprint from here. How many unarmed students can a gunman kill in one minute?"

He looked around the room nervously.

"Alex is just buying time," I said. "Every second counts. You need to trust me. I know him."

He took a deep breath and gave me a small nod. I think he was actually relieved that I was taking charge, so he didn't have to. I could tell it was taking every ounce of courage he had not to run away.

I glanced at his badge and said, "Dave, I want you to listen to me, okay? Everything is going to be okay."

He nodded again.

"Dave, where is the other officer?"

“I don't-- ” he trembled. "I don't know."

"Jesus," I muttered under my breath. "You've called 911, right?"

"Yes," he said. "They're three minutes away."

I shook my head. "That's too long."

I turned back to Alex and he was already off the phone. I missed the whole conversation. *Shit.*

"Did he believe you?" I asked.

"I think so," said Alex. "He said he's holding twelve in the library."

I closed my eyes for a moment and turned to the officer. "I need you to give me your gun."

"What?" He shook his head. "No way. What if the kid gets it?"

"Take out the magazine and give me the gun," I repeated.

"N--No. We need to wait for the police and hostage negotiators."

"For fuck’s sake, this isn’t a hostage situation," I snapped. “It’s a massacre, waiting for Player 2 to enter the stage. The second he thinks Alex isn’t coming, he’ll kill them all."

"But--"

"Jesus, do you want to be the next Parkland guard, like your missing buddy? World famous for letting innocent kids die?"

His face went white.

Finally. Something resonated with him. It’s hard to manipulate people you’ve never met, but that one seemed to hit the mark.

He shook his head, removed the magazine, and handed over the gun.

"Thank you," I said.

I took the gun and shoved it in Alex's hands.

"What the fuck?" Alex and the guard spoke at the same time.

"We're going to the library," I said.

"Why?"

"Alex, right now, you're the only thing keeping those kids alive. As long as he believes you're coming, he won't hurt them. So he has to believe you got the gun."

He swallowed and accepted the gun.

"Good," I said. "Now let's go."

We hurried past the guard, who didn't move or speak another word. It was probably for the best. An officer would only provoke this guy -- whoever he was.

As we broke into a run, I said: "Alex, point the gun to my head."

"What? You're nuts."

"Do it," I said. "If he's watching the security feed, this has to look real."

He did as I said. We ran through the hallway as the alarm blared: *Active shooter… This is not a drill… Take cover…*

Now, I had just sixty seconds to figure out two things:

1. Who was the other kid? And what did I need to know about him in order to manipulate him?
2. Did Alex really want to stop this, or was he still playing me? He was clearly capable of fooling me, but I really felt like his breakthrough earlier was genuine. Or maybe that was all just part of the distraction. But he told me about the distraction *before* the alarm went off.

"Alex, I need you to tell me everything you can about this kid," I said. "Who is he? What's his name? How did you meet him?"

"Uh-- His name is Ian. I met him on a forum a month ago."

"You were there to talk about Emma?"

"Yeah." He was already out of breath. "And Ian understood me. He went through the same thing."

"Does he go to this school?"

"No," he said. "He's older. 24 I think."

"And he wanted to help you plan this?"

"It was his idea," said Alex. "He said it would make everything right."

It explained so much... Alex's rapid descent into darkness last month. The sudden calm. And the ancient graphing calculator, which students never used anymore. I had to admit, it was a clever way to communicate without leaving a technical trace.

"Alex, I need you to tell me the truth." I tried to catch my breath. "Do you really want to help stop this, or are you still messing with me?"

He didn't answer immediately. "I guess I want to help."

That wasn't convincing.

I got the sense that Alex didn't even know what he wanted to do yet. And that scared the hell out of me.

"Because all the stuff I said in my office, it's true. You can feel better. I promise." Then I added, "You know Ian's exploiting you, right? He's just using you to play out his own fantasies."

I felt like a lawyer, trying to make my case, to convince the jury to take my side.

Alex nodded, and that was it. Our sixty seconds were up.

We turned the corner and slowed down in front of the library doors. I peered through the glass and saw a group of students huddled by the reference desk. Ian towered over them, pointing his gun.

"Walk me in there, and keep the gun at my head," I whispered. "Tell him you want me to watch them die, so I can see what a failure I am."

"What the fuck is wrong with you?" Alex whispered back.

"Just do it," I hissed. Then I pushed open the doors and we walked inside.

Ian quickly turned his gun to us.

"Why's the shrink here?"

"To fuck with our heads," said Alex, lowering his gun. "Like I said on the phone, don't listen to a goddamn word the snake says. Now give me something loaded."

*What the hell, Alex?*

Alex and Ian gave each other big smiles, then walked toward one another and embraced.

"The Glock 19, right?"

"Yeah."

Ian handed Alex the gun and turned his attention back to the group of students. I quickly scanned the group, and that's when I saw Emma.

My heart sank. Why was she here? I called her father last night to warn him. Who would send their kid to school after that? He, of all people, should have known better.

It was easy to see why Alex fell for Emma. She was beautiful, but in more of an innocent, unassuming kind of way. She cowered with the other students, tears streaming down her cheeks.

"The cops are going to be here any minute," said Alex. "Let's do this."

The students whimpered. Emma let out a loud sob.

"Shut up, bitch!" Ian shouted.

She cried again and buried her face in her hands.

For just a second, Alex actually looked upset.

And that's when I realized that Emma being here was actually a *good* thing. I wasn't the one who needed to manipulate anyone.

"Alex, she needs you," I said gently.

He spun around and pointed the gun at me. "Enough out of you. You're going to watch us kill every single one of them. Maybe that'll finally shut that fucking mouth up."

"Look at her," I continued. "She's in distress, and you're the only one who can save her."

He lunged forward and hit me in the face with his gun.

"Shut. The. Fuck. Up."

But even from the ground, I persisted. "You can save her, Alex. You can be her hero."

I looked at Emma and raised my eyebrows, trying to imply that she should play along with me.

She gave me a pained look and closed her eyes.

"Please save me, Alex."

*Yes.*

Finally, I saw it. The softening of Alex's face. Just like in my office before.

"Dude, just kill the whore," said Ian. "Don't you remember what she did to you?"

"Please save me, Alex," repeated Emma through tears. "I need you."

"Are you fucking kidding me with this shit?" Ian laughed and pointed his gun at Emma. "Here, I'll get us started."

Emma screamed.

Then there was a gunshot.

And before I could piece together what happened, Ian was laying on the ground next to me, a pool of blood forming around his head.

I looked up and saw Alex standing over us, white as a sheet.

"You did it," I whispered. "You did it, Alex. You saved her."

His eyes brimmed with tears, but I knew he wouldn't cry.

"Alex, you're her hero. You rescued Emma."

His face stayed soft, exactly the state we needed to keep him in until the police got here.

I knew I'd be in huge trouble, but in my book, one dead murderer was better than twelve innocent students.

Call it reckless if you want, but as the sirens closed in around us, I knew I'd sleep soundly tonight.

If it wasn't for that next fucking gunshot.

Before I knew it, Alex had fallen on top of me, and I felt something warm spilling all over my chest.

"What the--"

I looked up and saw Emma standing above us.

"He's not my fucking savior!" she screamed.

"Emma, I need you to calm--"

"He's a stalker and a psycho!" she sobbed. "He made me afraid to come to school."

"I understand," I said, still on the ground with Alex bleeding out on top of me. "Can you drop the gun, so we can make sure no one else gets hurt?"

"I'm not dropping it." She shook her head. "When you called last night, my dad gave me his gun and told me to use it if anything happened. You should have stopped this. You shouldn't have used me like a pawn. I don't trust you. I don't trust anyone."

Her dad was in the military. He must have taken the threat seriously after all.

"You're safe now, Emma," I said calmly. "I promise."

She wiped her eyes. "I don't even know what 'safe' feels like anymore."

"I just want to make sure the police don't hurt you when they see a gun in your hands," I said. "Can you slide it over to the other side of the library?"

She sniffled and considered it for a few seconds. She finally nodded and pushed the gun away.

I let out a deep breath as the police burst through the doors.

There was shouting and crying, but I didn't pay much attention.

Instead, I looked into Alex's eyes, which were mere inches from my face. I saw sadness, but I also saw pride. I saw the face of a young man who felt he had redeemed himself.

I ran my hand through his hair and whispered, "I'm sorry."

\* \* \*

So, you see, the truth is complicated.

Reckless? Probably. But I'm convinced that phone call saved twelve lives, even if it cost the life of my patient.

Maybe you think I should have just let the hostage negotiators do their jobs. I guess we'll never know.

Maybe you think I was being manipulative and controlling, but I only do that stuff because I don't believe people can be trusted to do the right thing.

Maybe you think this will scare me away from therapy forever, but I've seen it all... A woman who kept her ex locked up as a sex slave. A patient with PTSD who gave *me* nightmares. A husband and wife who accused each other of abuse, and only one of them was telling the truth. A pedo-ring conspiracy theorist who was actually onto something. A patient with OCD whose loved ones really *did* suffer every time he missed a ritual. And who could forget, the choir boy who claimed he was being molested -- not by a priest -- but by God Himself.

The problem is, my patients have a habit of dying. Alex isn't the first, and I'm worried he won't be the last. Sometimes I wonder if I'm the common denominator. Or maybe that's just the cost of taking on exceptionally broken clients.

I picked up my crate of belongings and took one last look around the office. I would miss this place and the people, but I would find another home soon enough.

I'll never stop trying to help.

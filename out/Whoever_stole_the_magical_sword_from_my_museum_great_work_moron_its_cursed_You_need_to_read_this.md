 Please know right away: if I sound cranky in this writing, it’s not because I am. 

Well, okay. I’m actually furious, but odds are it’s not with you, so if anything here seems too condescending and sarcastic, please imagine that it’s instead being read to you with gentle, soothing tones, while ocean sounds play in the background. I don’t want to offend anyone on accident. 

The only person I want to offend on purpose is the person who stole from my museum, so, if that’s you, please imagine that these words are being read aloud to you with the utmost scorn of a Victorian-Era duchess who caught you treading mud through the entryway of her estates. Additionally, if you’re the thief, feel free to mentally add in some additional insults or curses as well, if it makes you feel worse, which is my goal here. 

That’s a lie: my goal is to get you to bring the Everblade back. Because if you don’t, it is 100% going to be the end of you and probably many others. 

But, while I’m at it, I wanted to also introduce a little of what I do to anyone else who might come across this message. 

I’m a curator at the Museum of Unnatural Curiosities. You might have heard of the museum, or you might not have. I’m sure there are people out there who could explain its history to you. Even I could explain some of it if I wanted to right now.

But that’s not what this is about, or what most of you are here for when you come to visit. The Museum has a reputation for keeping “magic stuff,” and that reputation isn’t entirely unearned. A lot of people come here for that, naturally, and there are a lot of expectations around the idea. A museum with magical items in it? That has to be some kind of mystical, fantastical place.

But it’s actually fairly normal for the most part. The Museum itself, I mean. And a lot of the things in it aren’t all that impressive when they’re just sitting on a shelf. And that’s because, to be honest, a lot of the stuff we have here is just the unwanted magic.

That’s not to say it’s all weak or laughable. No, some of it is actually so powerful that it’s effectively useless. Think of the legend of Midas’s Curse, for an example of the kind of thing I mean: an insane power, overkill to the max, with downsides that far outweigh the benefits.

One of our more well-known items is the Everblade, Item 3.2.θ, the sword that is currently missing, and which I will need back here within the week unless you want us coming after you, whoever you are. For the rest of you, and probably for the thief as well, since it’s unlikely they stopped long enough to read the plaques, here’s my normal tour-guide spiel about the Everblade:

Back around 1100, some idiot wizard decided that he wanted a magical sword. But he wasn’t content with the normal “unbreakable and never-dulling sword” that nearly everyone else was using, due to its practicality and universality. Now *that* was a good enchantment. But, no, instead, this idiot decided he wanted a sword which was not only all those things, but also a blade that could cut through any material it came into contact with, while also infusing it with a spell of rot and decay, just for…fun, I guess?

His fun didn’t last long once he got the thing and started wearing it. Word to the wise, and the wizards who think they’re wise, but aren’t, despite the etymology of their title: a blade that can cut through anything CUTS THROUGH ANYTHING, including the cheap little leather scabbard you somehow thought would keep it in place. And when you’re walking, and the sword is attached clumsily to your belt so you can show it off to your wizard friends, sometimes it’ll swing back and forth from the momentum of your movement. And then the blade will swing right through the scabbard and out the side, probably into your leg. Or an adjacent area of your body, say, between the legs. 

So yeah, that wizard died very quickly to several forms of rot, which he had, again, deliberately infused into his stupid sword. Good thing he died before it caught on as a trend to make those swords, at least. And then, because none of the friends he’d been showing off for wanted the thing, they buried it in the words somewhere, where it remained safely and never hurt anyone again.

Oops, that's not what happened. Actually, what I meant was: they buried it in the woods, but didn’t bother trying to disenchant it or put any protective measures on it at all, or bother checking by what mechanism the rot was released. They just shoved it hilt-deep into a boulder and buried it, and, over time, that boulder began to…decay. Almost like a living thing, but much more slowly, it began to flake away and break apart underground, and the rot from the sword leaked out into the dirt around it, and the trees for a hundred yards in every direction were dead within a half-century as the rot spread, trying desperately to infect and kill the thing it had “stabbed”—in this case, the entire earth, apparently. 

Who knows how long that would have kept going, or how bad it would have gotten. The rate of decay didn’t seem to be accelerating, but it’s hard to tell with these things sometimes. In any case, the “Everblade” was found again after those fifty years, chiefly because it was now sitting, blade plunged into the earth, at the bottom of a fifty-foot-wide crater of broken, dead earth, earth where any life in the soil had been drained away, earth that had become like dust or sand in a ring around the blade and blown away or been washed away by the elements, leaving the sword exposed once again.

The idiot king who found the blade decided it would be his, mostly because he was currently involved in a land squabble and, if you can believe it, he wanted to stab his enemy’s crop fields with the thing as a kind of bizarre act of primitive, supernatural, reverse eco-terrorism, which is a term I never expected I’d have to use. But I suppose that’s humanity for you. We’ll find the weirdest uses for the stupidest things.

In any case, the king decided that the cursed blade would be his, and gave the order that it be brought to him. Those present at the time claim that the king’s retinue died to the blade one by one as they tried to carry it. 

The first one ordered to retrieve it (for the king wasn’t quite foolish enough to be the first to touch the thing) did so easily—too easily. The blade wrenched out of the ground, cutting itself free with no resistance as the man tugged on it, and he found that he’d both pulled too hard and, more importantly, misjudged the angle at which the sword was embedded, and how that angle related to the place where he was standing. The blade shot forth from the earth and, as he stumbled, arms flailing with the sword still in one hand, it pierced his stomach. 

As he lay on the ground, the rot overtaking him slowly, another man was ordered forward. He attempted to wrap the blade, somewhat wisely, I suppose, though he then tried to use the wrappings to lift the sword from the ground in a kind of hammock, a strip of cloth and leather holding the blade and another holding the hilt of the sword so it could dangle harmlessly. Unfortunately for him, the blade slipped through the wrapping cloth and leather, and cut a deep gash down the man’s leg and severed his foot. The rot began to take him, as well, and he collapsed beside the body of the first.

The third member of the troop who went forward was an older veteran, and a man who knew some of what magic could do, though he himself cast none. The veteran took the blade by the hilt, carefully holding it away from his body, and began to climb with it out of the crater, over the treacherously sandy ground. And, yes, he did make it out, with narry a stumble, and held the blade out to the king, reversing his grip so that the hilt was towards his “highness.” The king snatched the hilt eagerly and raised the blade in front of his face, examining it with gleeful wickedness, not noticing that he’d nicked the veteran’s finger in his haste to pull the sword to him.

The rot began to take the older man as well, though they say he lived for another few days before it fully ended his life, straggling along after the group as they left and trying to call for help. No help came from them, terrified as they were of failing their monarch.

And so the king had his blade, and was pleased with it, and spent many happy hours in his traveling tent testing the blade on all manner of materials, including some of the jewels he had stolen on his latest conquest (the guy was pretty awful, which is why this next part shouldn’t be sad at all, really). 

But the king put too much trust in his subjects’ willingness to die for him, and not enough trust in the value of paying them a fair share from the gold he’d stolen. So the old veteran’s friends, who felt guilt over abandoning their rotting friend to die, but had done so from fear that the infection could spread, gathered outside the king’s tent that night, just as the king lay down to sleep, the sword carefully stabbed into one of his bedposts as a makeshift wooden sheath, blade fully covered by the wood (yes, he really did make his retinue carry a poster bed along with him on conquests. As I said, awful).

The older men, the veterans, entered the tent unheard, and four of them grabbed the king’s limbs and held him down while the fifth pulled the sword free from the bedpost. It came out the side, with less effort than cutting an oar’s edge through water. It went through the king’s neck even more easily, and also severed the entire bed frame in two with the same blow.

The veterans were much wiser than their ex-king, though obviously still quite prone to violence. They kept the sword, and, seeing as their employer was now dead, they retired from official service and became a band of mercenaries. They learned to use the sword more carefully, and named it the Everblade, and learned how to keep it stored in a way that was less dangerous—though, over the next decade, two more of them would die to its blade in separate accidents or moments of overconfidence. 

After the second death, the remaining three mercenaries decided they were now doubly retired, and that the advantage of a stone-cutting sword was negated by the potential to die a horrible, lingering death at its hands. Well, at its edges, I guess. 

And so they took the sword, and plunged it deep into a black, volcanic rock (a type which they had found to be resistant to the rotting, even more so than regular stone). They drilled metal hooks into the corners of the rock, looped chains through them, and suspended the blade-stabbed boulder in the middle of a room, a stone-brick basement hidden underneath the basement of the old church where they had made their base of operations for many years. The chains were attached firmly to the walls, and the boulder hoisted so that it was not touching the floor. Finally, the blade itself was further suspended, an additional three chains wrapped around the protruding hilt, slightly slack, but ready to take the sword’s weight and stop it from falling should the volcanic boulder eventually rot away. Then the mercenaries sealed the entrances to that hidden room, paved over it with cobblestones, and even sealed off the basement where the entrance had been hidden. 

They set fire to the wooden portions of the old church before they left, and wandered away from the sword and out of the historical record.

And that’s where our people found the sword, in about 1945, right in the middle of one of the European war zones.

The rubble of the church was long since worn away, even the stone portions, except for a large black rock of that same volcanic stone, which the mercenaries had used as a table, apparently. Having recently become aware of some…interesting properties of that type of stone on our own, this location stood out to us. (For reasons that may or may not be obvious and may or may not matter to you, I will not be giving any more specific detail about the makeup of that stone type or where it can be found. Some secrets are, after all, trade secrets, by which I mean I would need to receive something of equal value in trade in order to tell you them. I doubt there’s anything equal in value to this secret in particular, at least not that would be useful to me. Still, contact me if you feel otherwise, and I’ll consider the trade).

After finding the stone, we began digging around the area. This led us to the basement, which led us to the hidden, sealed chamber. Now, don’t think my team idiots who would break open a sealed and possibly supernatural buried chamber by just chiseling through it in person. No, we blew a hole in its wall from a distance (our scientific rigor or adherence to strict safety rules was not always what it is now). We only looked inside once the smoke had cleared and it was also clear that no undead mummies or whatever were going to burst out and attack us. 

Inside, the sword hung from the ceiling, just as it had for nearly 800 years at that point. The volcanic rock around it had crumbled away, breaking and leaving large chunks of itself chained to the wall, but simply dragging along the floor now. The sword remained suspended by the backup chains. One of them had rusted straight through, leaving only two holding it up at a dangerous, swinging angle. I don’t exactly know why the sword rusted the chains without cutting them. Perhaps the falling away of the rock jolted it to the side, and one of the chains was cut by the sword as it swung around afterwards. Or perhaps the rot was more pervasive than anyone realized.

On a small alcove to the side in that room, an old scroll was also found, poorly made from an artistic point of view but still clear to be read: that stone room had been protected well from water, and the very presence of the Everblade seemed to deter parasites and bookworms.

And from that scroll, I took most of the details of this tale that you have now read. You’ll likely notice that some details couldn’t possibly have been in the scroll in the way in which I presented them, and may even accuse me of embellishment for the sake of drama in my story. Others have made those accusations before you.

In any case, that scroll made us yet more cautious of the sword, even though we already had planned to handle it carefully. Using much more precise methods than the king’s men had years before, we managed to remove it and store it safely here in a much more permanent manner.

Until yesterday, it was hanging there just fine, bound flat-side first to a large piece of that same volcanic rock with chains whose links were also made of the same material.  Near as we could tell, that setup would have lasted, oh, about another 800 years, easily. 

But no. Some idiot had to come along and scush everything up, and when I came into work to start my night shift today, the display case had been utterly shattered, and the volcanic rock had been mostly turned to dust…by a *jackhammer*, if you can believe it. Security cameras are, naturally, completely blank for a fifteen-minute period earlier today, and no visitors, staff, or security remember even *going* to that floor today, let alone seeing someone hauling in a whole jackhammer and hauling out an enchanted sword that can’t be sheathed. Which all leads me to believe that you, thief, must have some experience with these things already. Are you one of those fools who tried stealing from the Institute a while back, and got away with a couple of weak little spell-wards? Really bolstered your confidence, didn’t it, stealing stuff that nobody cared about enough to watch it carefully? And I presume one of those spell-wards did something to the cameras, or maybe even drove attention away from the display while you drilled at the Everblade’s confines. You probably thought yourself very clever, doing whatever you did to stop the sound of the jackhammer from reaching beyond that room.

But you weren’t clever enough to choose a better item to steal, which tells me one important thing: you’re an amateur. You do not want to be involved with this. Not least because every. Single. Item. In our displays has an additional level of enchanted security which we add to it, at my insistence. 

If you’re playing along at home, thief, you probably just gave the Everblade a nervous glance. Good—keep watching it. Because the backup security for this item is that it’s remotely linked to mirror the motions of a second sword, a wooden prop, when I activate that secondary enchantment. In dumb-stealing-person-speak, that means that I have a magic stick, and when I wave it around, the Everblade will mimic those flailing motions, wherever you have it stored. And I don’t expect you’ll know how to stop it from cutting you, or how to stay the rot that will follow.

So, if you have the Everblade, you now have really only two options: bring it back, or die. That’s not even a threat, it’s just what will happen. 

You have until sundown tomorrow night.

As for the rest of you who aren’t leeches on the scarred leg of society, welcome to the Museum! I do hope you were able to learn something. If you happen to see a rust-less ancient sword next to suspiciously straight cuts in solid concrete, or by a person missing half their body, or even just a sphere of decay like the sword first caused in that forest, *please* don’t try to grab the thing yourself. Just contact me, and I promise I’ll take care of it. It’s not the most difficult thing here.

Just the stupidest one to steal.

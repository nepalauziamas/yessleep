At first, it was almost unnoticeable

I was in the middle of my morning skin care routine, staring at my face through the mirror. I had just taken a shower, and it was still slightly foggy from the water vapor, despite my attempts at wiping it off. Then, it caught my attention. It was right in front of my nose. Although almost indistinguishable from the usual smudge or two, I was able to make out a word.

"*OUT"*

*Funny, that's the first time I've ever seen a word form on my mirror*

It looked like someone had written the word on the mirror earlier, the same way you would draw pictures on the car windows during a rainy day. It was very small, each letter about the half the size of my thumb. The humid air seemed to have almost filled it back up completely.  The letters looked as if someone tried to write the word in a way that would seem like it wasn't written, kind of like how clouds sometimes look like certain objects.

Not thinking much of it at first, I swiftly wiped it off with my towel. As I rubbed moisturizer on my cheeks, I stared intently at myself through the clear circle I had just created on the mirror, as if a window to my own thoughts. Although it had to be coincidence, the odd similarity to a slightly concerning word drowned me in paranoia. As always, I seemed to have thought too much about it.

*Out, huh?*

I ended my skincare routine early, telling myself I woke up late and I should probably get to work soon anyway.

For the next few days, I didn't see any more words. That didn't stop that first incident from affecting me, though. Every morning as I got out of the shower I would briefly check the mirror, ensuring there was no words I could make out. When I left the bathroom, I would forget about it completely until the next morning.

It had to have been at least a week, and at this point I had essentially forgotten all about that dumb smudge on the mirror. As memories become more distant, it becomes much easier to label them as me "making things up", or even it being from a dream. But of course, if that was the end of it, I would not be posting this.

It's another morning, and I had just finished my shower. I open the shower curtains, revealing the wide foggy mirror hiding behind them on the wall. The mirror is... normal, there isn't any smudges or marks or writing or anything. It was just nice and foggy, void of any source of fear.

Then, I prepare my skin routine products, taking each one out of the wall mounted cabinet and placing them onto my bathroom counter. I then turn around to grab a towel so that I can wipe down the mirror. I accidentally drop the towel, then pick it up, then turn around back towards it. The mirror had only left my field of vision for about eight to ten seconds, yet there *it* was as I looked back at it, horrifyingly appearing literally out of nowhere.

"*BEHIND"*

This time, the word was written as wide and tall as the mirror, impossible to ignore. The letters were very clear in the fog, as if someone had just written it with their hands. It also looked like it was written very quickly, the letters were rushed and messy, but this time not "natural" looking like before. It's as if the intention was no longer to send a quiet message, but to give an urgent warning.

It had somehow made me jump, but I caught myself before falling backwards into my shower. I stared at it. My head and eyes were frozen, partly out of shock and partly out of the sudden intense urge to not look anywhere but forwards.

I decided that I didn't want to be inside the bathroom anymore. I opened the door and walked out, ensuring that the shower area that was behind me was not visible. Whatever was supposedly behind me, I did not want to see.

I then slammed the bathroom door closed, and ran to my bedroom.

I still had work in the morning, so I quickly calmed down and collected myself. I sat on my bed and just thought for a few minutes.

*Okay, there's no way there was actually a word on my mirror. It's just not possible, I must have been seeing things. That cannot be real.... Screw it, I'll just skip the skin care routine for today and go to work. By the time I'm home, everything will be normal, I just can't go back into that bathroom right now.*

I lived alone in my house, so I was aching to talk to someone about this. Once I got to work, I told a few of my friends about what happened. They, of course, laughed it off. Eventually, they had convinced me that it's nothing to worry about.

*"Sometimes the mind can do weird things in the morning, since you're still a bit tired."*

After I got home, it took me about an hour to mentally prepare to go back inside that bathroom. I obviously had to just do it, I can't just block off an entire room forever.

I eventually just stopped thinking about it, and faced it. I grabbed a baseball bat just to be safe.. I opened the door swiftly, first checking the shower area, ready to kill something.

Thank god, nothing was there, or anywhere else inside that bathroom. Relief washed over me, and I relaxed my body, retreating from my guarded stance. I laughed a little to myself, but then I remembered I wasn't done yet.

The mirror inside the bathroom is not immediately visible when entering, you have to walk in to be able to see it. Even though writing isn't necessarily threatening, I was terrified of going into that bathroom because I did not want to see any more words.

I stepped inside, looked to my left...

"TMRW NIT LIV ROOM"

Although this is exactly what I did not want to see, I did not feel as threatened by it this time. This time, it was very small and "natural" looking like the first word "*OUT"* was. It was also a clear smudge on the mirror, since there was no fog left. It was on the dead center of the mirror though, easily noticeable. I understood the abbreviation, "Tomorrow Night, Living Room", and it seemed as though an actual person was communicating with me, setting up a meeting. This is not to say that I wasn't scared, though. It still got me very paranoid and stressed out very fast.

I decided to be rational about it this time. I took a picture of it with my phone, and then wiped it off.

This leads me to where I am now. I decided that, after three separate times now, I should probably post online about this, so I just hopped on my computer right after checking the bathroom. I wanted to see if maybe someone else has experienced the same thing, and what I should do next. Honestly, I have no idea what the hell to do right now, and I don't know why I'm seeing words. I might still be making things up, or maybe I'm dreaming, but this picture evidence is enough proof to myself for now that I'm not crazy.

I was also thinking about whether I should even go to this *meeting,* if that's even what it is. Honestly though, it does seem like these messages had some sort of good intention, if not to absolutely terrify me. I guess it'll be worth it to hear *them* out.

Let me know what you guys think about this, I'd love to get some insight on my *unique* situation. I'll post an update tomorrow after this "*meeting"*

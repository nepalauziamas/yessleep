The police hide many things from the public as we all well know and as an officer myself I can tell you I have had to hide some truly bad stuff from the public and I will take them to my grave but this is a secret is I just can’t keep. Many of you may have heard of a rumor that the police have a special paranormal division for events that require skills outside the normal scope of policing and this is just that a rumor or more so what they want you to think.

When you join the police force we joke about this secret division and I’ve even been approached by the public to ask if it exists, to nearly all officers the immediate answer would be of course not as that is the truth to them and was to me. Now I don’t know what to say to them, I’ve signed my name into an NDA that I had no choice in not signing but I can’t tell anyone about what I saw and who they are so I hope to post this anonymously and inform people. I’ve seen what they do to people that break the NDA and it is enough to stop anyone from talking. 

It was a normal day on the force and I was called in to investigate a break and enter at a local residential home on the north side of town, the house was along a quiet street surrounded by other houses and when we arrived we saw it. A large, classic 1900s American house receded from the main path, and connected to it was a winding walkway leading through an overgrown garden to the front door of the house. Back in the day, I’m sure it looked beautiful but given that it was quite dark by then and the house didn’t look lived in, it just looked sinister, looking at it made me feel uneasy and my partner felt the same. 

We decided to flip a coin to see who would talk to the neighbors and the one we both didn’t want, approach the house, and knock. I chose heads and to my luck, I “won” and got to speak to the neighbors whilst my partner scoped the property. I saw my partner turn on his torch and walk the path, little did I know that would be the last time I saw him. 

The first neighbor I spoke to was a sweet old lady and she gave me some good information, she said that the house had been abandoned for years and was falling apart, her bedroom window faces the house and she has seen lights on, figures walking around, loud noises, like crying and screaming and the front door opens on its own, she even, to my absolute surprise had a video of the door opening on its own from her bedroom! ‘That door is locked up tight as I’ve locked it a few times myself it has to be ghosts I say’ I thanked her for her time and moved on. Now, I’m a big skeptic so when I heard her say ghosts I thought she was a crazy person or someone that just didn't have a scientific mind to come up with plausible explanations. 

As I walk to the next house my walkie radio comes to life and nearly makes me shit my pants. ‘Partner you there? I’ve been knocking on the front door no reply. I see movement inside, I’m going around the back to try there, over.’ I just responded ‘Roger, over.’ and moved on. I spoke to a few more neighbors a delightful couple and a few not-so-friendly neighbors hurling insults at the badge as is the custom these days. As I make my walk back my walkie springs back to life with a frantic voice on the other end.

‘Need backup immediately, got a suspect wielding a knife, I’ve entered through the backdoor and am currently positioned in the kitchen, in front of me in the living room appears to be a tall female, dressed in a white gown… dancing I think, around the living room, she is possession of a large blood-stained  kitchen knife.’ As I listened to this it sent chills up my spine, what the hell is going on I was thinking this building should be empty, there's no way some woman is dancing around some derelict house but the panic in my partner's voice was thick and believable. ‘Ten-four, approaching now, over’ I ran up the walkway to the house, and as I was on my way my walkie sprang to life with a reply. 

‘She’s moved position, walked out of the living room and into the dining room but I could have sworn it was more of a glide, moving to get visuals over.’ As I approached the front door I heard, a manly scream of terror followed by three loud gunshots which lit up the living room window in a brief orange light. All I could hear after was wet smacking sounds, repeatedly followed by a weird crunching noise I did not know it then but after it turns out my partner had been stabbed nearly over a hundred times with the same knife he reported, the sounds I heard was this knife butchering his body like it was a pin cushion. 

As I approached the main front door to my surprise it was slightly ajar, I pulled out my gun and spoke into my radio. ‘Control, this is unit 4, an officer's gun has been discharged at a suspect and we need immediate backup at our location.’ I waited for confirmation before entering. ‘This is control, backup is on standby please clear the area before they make the callout’. What they meant here is, that units are spread thin at the moment please confirm what we're up against so they can send the appropriate units. I enter the building, torch, and gun in hand. 

I shout ‘Police, come out now with your hands up otherwise I will shoot’ I really meant that. The first thing I noticed when I walked through the large wooden door is that it is freezing even in mid-summer and the nights are very hot, so cold in fact I could see my breath.

I start to move through the house scouring the rooms, it’s just as I would have thought, old 50s furniture, dusty with cobwebs everywhere, bare wooden floors, and ripped up, drooping wallpaper along the walls. It was the perfect scene for a horror movie, as I walked into the living room I saw it, my partner's boots peeking out of the doorway leading to the kitchen than before I know it the body was dragged out of sight, I’m a hardened officer but that made my blood run ice cold. 

I move forward shouting at the top of my lungs ‘Show yourself now!’ I receive from behind me a sinister, childlike laugh causing me to spin around but nothing was behind me. At this point I believed I had seen enough to call it in even if I had to exaggerate and lie, I had to get out of the building. I charge for the front door, reach it and go to open it. My soul had left my body at this point as the door was jammed shut. 

I remembered my partner saying he got in through a back door so I run back to the kitchen, I entered it expecting to see his body and sure enough, it was there on the tiles on his back and his face looking at the ceiling, blood was pooling all around him and his face had this look of sheer fear, it was like a face I’ve never seen before, in fact, I didn’t know faces could do that. I tried the back door but no I couldn’t get out it was also jammed. My head was racing, I should have made the call there and then but I just wanted to get out to be safe again. I thought it can’t get worse than this but I was so wrong, it was going to become hell itself. 

A low guttural growl was coming from the living room, I didn’t want to look but I knew I had to, as I looked into the living room I saw glowing yellow eyes in the far corner near the window, the part where it was darkest. All I could see were those eyes for a few seconds yellow eyes with black slits as pupils, then it was followed by a nasty wide row of sharp pointy teeth pulling off some sort of demonic smile and between them a long tongue, drooling with saliva all over the floor.

It was at that moment I noticed what it was, a huge dog, and it started to walk towards me. I had to get out of the kitchen as there was no exit and no doors, the front door was shut so my only option was upstairs. I bolted with everything I had and so did this demonic dog, barking, growling snaring as it tries to snap at my heels, I braced for it to sink its huge teeth into my leg. 

I skipped up the stairs 4 at a time stretching my legs out like haven’t done since high school but I had no choice it was right behind me. I ran down the long corridor for my life and dashed into a nearby bedroom slamming the door behind me and placing my body on the door. Normally I moan about being fat but this time I was actually grateful, as it probably saved my life. I stayed against the door a while before I heard the banging end, I saw it as my chance to move some large objects by the door and did so. 

After that was done I took a look at the room I was currently in, and I was correct it was a bedroom or more so a child's bedroom. A small crib was in the corner rocking slowly back and forth like someone was pushing it, at this point, I had seen a lot worse than a crib moving on its own. What was worse was the dolls that were in the room, there must have been at least 30, some on the floor covered in webs, dirt, dust, and some on shelves, their faces were sad and dead but their eyes even though they didn’t move they always looked as if they were looking straight at you. At this point, I decided to call it in and hope for some backup. ‘Control this is unit 4, control I repeat this is unit 4.’ 

A few minutes did pass, and at that moment I felt completely alone, fear and adrenaline taking over again even though I was exhausted but to my sheer relief a response, at first it came out extremely distorted and broken up, then I heard a scream come through the walkie follow by the words ‘Get. out. of. my. house’.

I dropped the walkie at that point and stepped back but then I got ‘This is control’ I grab the walkie again and explain to them what just happened, then they asked me the question which made everything seem surreal like I knew nothing about the world, it was then I knew God was not real and there was so much more to this world then most of us know. 

‘Do you require paranormal assistance?’ In my stunned dazed state I asked them to repeat, ‘Do you want us to call in paranormal assistance?’ I then said without thinking ‘Yes’ I stayed in that room curled up in a ball in the corner like a child would do when their parents are fighting, praying for it to end soon.

Minutes more passed and I could hear banging on the bedroom door again, crying, shouting from downstairs things like ‘How could you do this to our baby you monster!’ it was a woman and a distraught, manic one at that, howling with sheet anger to which a man replied ‘Darling it was the maid's fault she should have been watching her.’ 

He sounded very prim and propper ‘You were fornicating with her again I know you were! You left our baby all alone upstairs, left to suffocate in her cot all because you couldn’t help yourself! You selfish stupid man!’ The voice was maddening at this point just pure primal and hysterical shouting. ‘Darling, put that down, you don’t want to do that, I know you love me, we can work this out!’ 

Crashing banging smashing is all I heard for a minute straight even with my hands up to my ears to block out the noise then a sound came that will haunt me for the rest of my days came from downstairs, the woman was humming, London bridge is falling down and as she was doing it the lyrics flooded my head making me cry, like a boy. The humming slowly got closer to me, I could hear her walking up the stairs, the creaks of the floorboards giving away her location.

I held my breath as I knew she had reached the bedroom door but she was still humming right outside, the door handle was being tried there was no way it could get through but still I shut my eyes I didn’t even want to look anymore I retreated to my brain and it went to finish the lyrics to the song she was humming, but instead, I was interrupted by the singer herself, her hushed voice close to my ear and her breath lathering my neck. ‘M-y fa-ir-LaDy.’

Tears fell from my cheek and she was trying to hush me and I felt her cold bony hands on my face brushing up and down, I still dare not open my eyes for who knew what I was going to see. Then like the gates of heaven had opened to accept me as one of their own the door downstairs crashed open followed by shouts of ‘Police, Police!’ 

Running pounded up the stairs and the thing next to me whispered in my ears ‘Don’t worry little one Mommy will be here, Mommy will always love you…’ The door to the bedroom smashed down and people with flashlights large guns and burning sage entered the room allowing me to finally open my eyes.

I don’t remember a lot else such as leaving the house, all I knew was that strong smell of sage and that I had soiled myself badly. I woke up in a hospital a few days later, apparently, my body put me into a short coma due to extreme induced shock, it should have no effect on my body but shock like that will almost certainly leave PTSD and they referred me to a specialist. 

Not long after I was awake I was approached by some very shady characters flashing me an FBI badge, they said what I had seen tonight can never be spoken about again for me and my family's sake and that the team that you saw does not exist. I had to sign the NDA and try to move on as if nothing happened but every time I try to sleep I hear her, feel her, sense her and when I wake in a cold sweat her final voice rattles my brain…

‘Don’t worry little one Mommy will be here, Mommy will always love you.’

Well Mommy I will be joining you soon.

So I just moved in with my new roommate for college for about two weeks now I was actually pretty excited at first to meet new people outside town I guess. And finally live on my own. 

My roommate is a pretty “normal” guy at first, he seem pretty introverted and shy at first but I really want him to feel comfortable and at home. The second day after I moved here was pretty okay I guess we haven’t even talked. I said “hi” to him a couple of times to start some conversations but he never replied. However he seem like he have his own friends tho because he is always out from 5pm and back until midnight or after that I’m not really sure. So yeah on the second day I decided to cook him some pasta with a note that said “feel free to eat this!!” Before leaving for class in the morning. But when I came back in the after noon just to see it left completely untouched. It was weird and also that he never have his own food somehow?? 

Anyways fast forward to the beginning of this week. The next door neighbors cat went missing and our building throw a huge search party for him. A couple of days before that I wake up to a HORRIBLY DISGUSTING smell at like 2 am I guess. I was about to open my bedroom door to see what is up in the living room but I heard some pretty weird noises. It sounded like giggles in a very low pitch voice, it sounded creepy and spooky. Like one of those laughs someone does before revealing their super evil plans in one of those movies. The laughter won’t stop, it just grew more aggressively yet it is very quiet. It sounded like something I never hear before, something not human-like, I was having chills as I was about to grab the doorknob to see what’s going on. Something stop me from opening the door, it can wait. 

Fast forward again to a couple of days after the incident. I almost forgot about that night until I found a cats collar inside our freezer in the morning. The freezer have a tint frozen blood right around the corner. I went out for the entire day that day dreading to come home. I went right to bed that day and didn’t confront him about it. 

Nothing suspicious happen until last night where I smell something so fishy again at 1 am this time. Followed by those creepy giggles in low volumed. It was getting so strong this time though. But they this morning the freezer was entirely clean without anything in it    

Right now I am typing this in bed and thankfully there is no smell this time. 

I really hope this is normal and I’m just overthinking and it’s just my imagination but someone please tell me what could this be. 

What should I do?? Is this normal??

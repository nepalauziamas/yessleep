I’m afraid. I’ve been afraid. Everything I’ve done since that damned night has been out of fear. That… that ‘thing’ has taken everything away from me. And now, fear is all I have left. Fear, wisdom, and memories… shitty-fucking-memories. Hopefully, I can share some of these things with others. Pass them on, so that more could understand. So that they could have a chance—a chance to know. A chance to stop it. A chance to save themselves. A chance… to celebrate. 

The shrink always came to visit me at the start of the week. I didn’t keep track of the visits, but they felt… annual—like it was always on a certain Monday or something. Fuck Mondays. They’d come over, treat me like some crazed lunatic and ask me stupid questions in monotone, like:

“Are you feeling depressed?”

“Do you feel like you want to harm yourself or others?” 

“Have you been taking all of your medication?”

It’s annoying… but it’s the only human contact I get, bitter-sweet in the saltiest of ways. I don’t know if I’m depressed, but I know I can’t feel anything anymore. And as for wanting to harm myself, maybe all the whiskey and cigarettes I’ve consumed could answer that question for me. About me wanting to harm others, though… I just wanted to slap the shit out of that dumb-ass therapist. But that’s not important…

This town has seen it’s fair share of unexplainable things happen in the past. All the cold cases and missing persons reports can attest to that—surprisingly high for such a small population. All seeming to revolve around those woods… that dark, ungodly place. 

I decided to visit the small church, just west of the town square before I headed into to the grove. I’m not a religious man at all, but if something that bad exists, the opposite has to be true as well… Right? Yeah… Plus, the place has this really old library underneath it. A collection of books from times long past, some even dating back before the Declaration of Independence was even a forethought. If there was any place in town that could give me a little insight into what I was getting myself into, it was there. 

The drive to the chapel was rough. It had been raining on and off for the past week and all the weather channels had been giving out warnings for flash flooding. I could barely see the road through the screen of cascading water on my windshield, but barely was good enough. And my old ride needed the wash. 

When I got to the church, hardly any other cars were in the parking lot. But the front doors were open and I could see a few dim lights in the entry way. I walked through the unpaved, muddy parking area towards the building; trying not to trip as I stumbled through little pools of undetermined depths.

When I got inside, I saw that the bowl of “holy” water had a  disgusting film atop it, like it hadn’t been changed in ages. Incense smoke filled the empty nave, and a few people sat still like statues in the dusty pews mumbling to a deaf, blind and dumb god. Must be nice to still have imaginary friends at their age. 

I walked deeper into the building. And as I did, I saw an elderly priest look at me for a moment, before he walked off to the side into one of those confession booth things. I needed access to the old library, so I followed him and sat on the other side of the small enclosure. 

When I closed the curtain behind me, the smell of piss, bad breath and burnt herbs started seeping through the wooden mesh; along with a raspy whisper of a voice that sounded like it was gurgled up from a decrepit place, more ancient and withered than the temple itself. 

“My son… what sins have you to confess before god?”

I told him that I wasn’t there to confess anything, but I was searching for information and I needed access to the library. I also told him that I was a semi-retired cop on an investigation, and showed him my badge. Without another word, he very slowly stood up and exited the booth. 

As I stepped out of the confessional, I could already see him walking off towards the backside of the church. So I followed him. Eventually, he led me to a very small, very aged looking wooden door with a pointed top and rusted metal bolts along with latches decomposing into it. It looked like it could fall and crumble into dirt at any moment, but it was surprisingly sturdy. 

The elderly man gestured the sign of a cross and pulled out pieces of corroding metal from his pocket, skeletal keys that looked nothing like you’d see in use in the world today. He opened the ancient barrier and exposed a spiral stairway that looked like it was built for children. Narrow steps barely protruding out from the walls, spinning downward into darkness… 

As I followed the priest into the bowels of the church, I wondered about the true age of the place. I wondered about the true age of Nightenberry Grove, because the space underneath the structure seemed way older than something that would’ve even been built by the early settlers of America. Like it was pulled right out of the mid-evil and placed right here—right in the heart of this small town. 

We walked for a while. And as we journeyed down the spiral of steps  into the abyss, the priest started talking to me in that dry, raspy voice of his again.

“My son… I knoweth why you are here. Ye seek knowledge that you can not find in the world of flesh. Ye shall know the truth, for the lord gives wisdom; from his mouth comes knowledge and understanding… but be wary of the fruits of wisdom that hath been long forgotten. For if the fruit must rot, be it the will of god…”

When we got down into the sub level of the temple, there was another bowl of “holy” liquid; this one more putrid than the first. A clear, yellowish substance filled the dish and let off a terrible odor. The priest immediately dipped two fingers into the bowl, put the foul juice onto his forehead and proceeded to lead me down a long corridor, lit by mostly spent candles, melted wax caked on the walls and floor from previous tapers. 

We walked for a while—in silence. Passing by unmarked graves that were built into the walls of the corridors. Some leaking a yellowish liquid into some sort of exposed drainage system… the same yellow sheen as… I don’t even want to think about it. 

Eventually, we made it to another strange looking doorway. Patterns of antiquated runes of which the origin I can’t even begin to recognize decorated the frame. A gate made of more rust than metal obstructed our path; trapped within the chamber was a person dressed in filthy remnants of a black robe, praying to a glass crucifix that was drenched in red paint and surrounded by candles. They didn’t even budge as the old man unlocked the door and we crossed the threshold. Finally—into the library…

for context me and my boyfriend go to this winding road called riverdale road in Thornton, Colorado, there is numerous things haunting this road like a phantom camero that can run you off the road, or a little girl in a white dress who walks along the side of the road and can appear in your backseat. or even a jogger who was killed asking for a ride. it’s an 11 mile stretch going from thornton, all the way to frederick. 

anyways, we go pretty frequently but never really saw anything until a couple weeks ago. it was about 2:30am. we were getting onto riverdale through McKay, as we entered, the air was warm but there was a pungent smell of horse shit since people actually do live on this road and have horses and land here. we have our windows down and not even 2 minutes on the road my boyfriend shouts “HOLY SHIT WHAT THE FUCK WAS THAT!!” clearly panicking. i asked frantically over and over “WHAT DID YOU SEE!” he was silent for a couple second then rolls up his sleeves to uncover the goosebumps on his arm. when i looked over at him his mouth was wide open with his hand covering it.. “i saw a figure, looked like something in a white dress running in the field.” he said in a very serious tone. after that we were both shaken up and decided to leave immediately after. the whole ride home consisted of what the fuck was that or are you sure that’s what you saw? we went to bed still thinking about what we had seen. he’s very good at covering up his emotions and i almost felt like i was more afraid than him even though i hadn’t seen it. 

we both were afraid of this road, for good reasons. after this encounter, it wasn’t enough to stop us from coming back. we had gone back a couple times after but never saw anything. we just felt like we were being watched. very eerie feeling, almost sinister. 

fast forward to yesterday. it was about 1:30am, the same warm air, but this time it smelled of something rotting. putrid smell. we go back and right off the bat, we see two dead raccoons not even 100 feet from each other down the road. i didn’t have any good feelings about that and i already knew it wasn’t a good sign but we decided to continue. we traveled on the road two times beginning to end without seeing anything and as we both wanted to leave we said well fuck it 3rd times a charm and went one last time, except this time, we asked politely that if there was anything out, to show itself and holy shit i was not prepared to what i was about to witness. i don’t think my boyfriend was ready to what he was about to hear either. 

as we get towards the middle of this road there is a small concrete barricade on a slight curve and that’s where i saw it. it’s pale, scrawny body, bald head, and long arms sitting, almost hunched over the barricade. right when our car lights illuminate that thing.. it swiftly hides behind the barricade going back into the pitch black woods behind it. i shout to my boyfriend “BABE DID YOU FUCKING SEE THAT THING!!” he replies “no what.. WHAT.. WHAT??” petrified since he was already on edge. i drive faster and then it hit me.. “babe i think that was an sw.” he looks at me, a look of someone who has just seen a ghost. but it wasn’t a ghost it was something far worse. 

we left immediately after that, and don’t plan on going back anytime soon. i can confidently say that was the most terrifying encounter i’ve ever had in my entire 20 years of existence.

Payton finds herself walking down a darkened hallway. She feels her way forward, hugging the wall to help guide her. As her eyes begin to adjust to the darkness, she can make out the erosion of the wallpaper as her finger tips glide across. Scanning the hallway, she notices the ceiling has been torn away, exposing rusted metal pipes above her. A faint voice can be heard in the distance. She follows the pipes forward until she reaches a vent in the wall. The voice seems to be coming through the vent. Hesitant at first, she decides to put her ear closer. As Payton leans in, she can hear whispering over a soft sobbing. 

Suddenly, sirens begin to blare over a PA system as a light flickers to life behind her. She turns to find a small flame at the end of the hallway as it lights a dim passage from her to it. Determined, she clenches her fist and begins walking forward, not noticing fingers beginning to protrude from the vent behind her. As she closes in on the flame, the sirens seem to get louder as the flame begins growing. She stops for moment, noticing the wallpaper peeling away exposing rusted metal pipes and rebar. Her eyes pan from one side of the room to the other, the room is quickly engulfed in fire as shrieks and moans of agony ring out. A babies cry can be heard echoing over the screams as Payton closes her eyes and covers her ears.

The screaming dissipates as a man’s voice can be heard repeating Payton’s name. A hand against her shoulder jolts her eyes open. She turns to see her brother. “Hope I didn’t interrupt anything special” Riley smirked. “No, I’m glad you woke me up when you did” Payton retorted, looking out of the passenger seat window as the car passes by a dense forest beyond barren fields. Payton glances over at Riley. She could see in his eyes, he was trying desperately to find something supportive to say. “So the town is about 10 miles out, but the GPS is acting up and I’m not sure how to get to the Orphanage from there” Riley stated. Payton reaches into the glove box to reveal an old ‘Missing Persons’ paper, weathered and wrinkled, she runs her hand firmly across the top to smoothen out the details in the picture. She skims over the writing for a moment “We’re just going to have to stop and ask for directions to this ‘Wish House’ place” Payton pauses to look at the photo on the paper. A little girl with shoulder length, autumn hair, a pale complexion and an emotionless expression stares back at her from the photo.

Payton glances up to see a hitchhiker standing beneath a ‘Welcome to’ sign as they pass by. It’s too degraded to make out any of the characters. She looks into her side mirror to see the hitchhiker picking up her bag and continuing towards the town. A thick fog begins enveloping the car, as they struggle to discern where they are. Suddenly, a stop sign appears before them, as the fog recedes around the car enough to recognize buildings in the distance. The car comes to a halt for a moment as they begin to perceive the town around them. Riley pulls the car forward and parks against a sidewalk as the pair decides to figure out where they are. Riley shuts the car off and they both exit the vehicle, as the fog dissipates enough to see they are in front of a shopping center.

The ominously empty street only adds to the pairs suspicions as they decide to investigate the buildings ahead. While investigating the seemingly quiet neighborhood, Payton happens upon a shop with a large front window with ‘T____ Lake Cafe’ imprinted above. She peers though the glass to find chairs neatly stacked on tables, next to a bar to which someone is wiping down the counter. Payton looks to Riley “Someone’s in here” Payton exclaims as she waves Riley over. Hesitant, Riley grabs the door handle and enters the cafe, Payton following close behind as the bell in alerts the figure to their presence. “Sorry, we aren’t officially opened for the day” says a voice behind the counter. “It’s nearly five in the evening” Riley states with concern. “Oh, my, I’ve missed the lunch rush again. Well, I’m sorry, you and the other patrons will have to wait outside, while I set up for this evenings event” explains the voice. As the fog continues to recede, a shift of light through the window illuminates the shadow behind the counter. A pale man with swept back hair and a pleasant smile greets them. “Dude, this town is dead. There are no patrons. My brother and I are looking for a place called ‘Wish House’ do you know it?” Payton exclaims. “Ah, the old orphanage, yes, but why on earth would you want to go -“ the gentleman is cut off by the sound of shouting down the street. The group turn to the window as Payton and Riley make their way outside.

Staggered gunfire rings out as though the gunman hesitates before each shot. Payton makes her way up the street as the fog begins thickening around her. Riley in close pursuit “if there is someone shooting, we don’t want to be in the crossfire, let’s get back in the cafe” Riley exclaims. Payton reaches the street corner, ignoring Riley’s warning, proceeds around the corner. There she finds a man firing into the thick fog. Payton begins approaching the man as her footstep interrupts the brief silence. The man quickly swings around. His eyes filled with fear and animosity as he aims his gun at Payton. Riley, thinking quickly, jumps in front of Payton, hands in the air “whoa, hey, please don’t shoot, we aren’t here to hurt you” Riley explains calmly and softly. The man in front of the pair was shaking. Disheveled hair, worn and tattered shirt with deep marks under his eyes as though he hadn’t slept in days. “We have to get out of here! Can’t you see them!? They’re right behind me!” Shouted the man as he began shuffling down the road. Payton attempts to catch up, but the man is lost to the fog.

Puzzled, the pair make their way back to the cafe to find the door locked and the gentleman inside, gone. Riley decides to check the building across the street as Payton looks for another way into the cafe.

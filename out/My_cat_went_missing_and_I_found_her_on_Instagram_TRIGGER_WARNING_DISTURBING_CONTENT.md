For the pass few months, I've been finding strange drawings on my front door step. I thought they were from my neighbors because they have a 9 year old and he's friends with my little brother. at first they were normal drawings of my house, me, my younger brother and my cat, Steve, she's fat. but recently, I've been finding dead rodents and birds on my front doorstep, I thought nothing of it because Steve likes to go out, most times she would come back with a dead mouse or bird. but this time she hasn't came back. It's almost been about a week since Steve went missing, I thought she was lost or was mistaken as a stray, which is impossible as Steve is a pretty well fed cat and you can tell she was well loved. The drawings also stopped appearing on my doorstep. 

until today, it was late and I just finished work, I was scrolling on my phone and looking at Instagram posts to kill time before I went to bed. as I was doing so, an unknown account messaged me, at first I thought it a spam account sending me a link to their porn site or something. but it was a link to this account. The account was called "I\_LUV\_KATS\_3452". the account looked normal but there was no profile picture, there were pictures of cats that you would find on google. Out of curiosity, I tapped on one of them. the first picture was a heavily photoshopped picture of a white fluffy, kitten with blue eyes, I swiped to the next post. And to my horror and disgust, it was a picture of a mutilated black cat laying on the road with its guts hanging out. I swiped to the next picture and it was a video of the same black cat, except it was still alive and obviously in pain. I exited out of the post and tapped on the recent post. the first picture was fluffy manecoon cat raising its paw to the camera. I swiped to the next post and it was a video of my cat in a trap, obviously she's afraid as she was pacing around in the cramped cage. 

I started to cry because after the last post on that account, I'm afraid that they'll do the same thing to my cat. once I swiped to the next post, my suspicions were right. there was a picture of my cat without her fur but her pelt laid next to her. I can feel myself about to throw-up, but I have to know who did this to her. so I swiped to the next post. it was a closeup video of Steve, she was still breathing, and all I can hear is her wheezing. After watching that awful video, I decided to call 911 and tell them what's going on. The operator told me that they couldn't help me, as I didn't know who ran that Instagram account but to keep the doors lock and make sure all pets are inside. I decided to report the account and encouraged my friends to do the same. just as I was writing this on my bed, I heard a loud bang outside of my window, it sounded like someone threw something against my window. I quickly ran outside but saw no one. but in front of my window was a black garbage bag. I looked inside the bag. inside was a drawing of my cat and the body of my cat. My sweet baby Steve, a cat who loved everyone and who everyone loved. I can't believe someone would be this cruel and awful to hurt such a loving cat. I'm calling the police again, I'm afraid that I am in danger, but I doubt they'll help me. But I'll update you next post or I'll just update this.

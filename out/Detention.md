So, something that made my school standout from most schools was we never had detention. Actually never had it. But from the start of this academic year, they announced that students will get detention if they misbehave.

Many students and parents found this really weird, that out of nowhere this decision was made. But we had no control over this.

What I had noticed, is that when students asked the teachers about this decision, they would get really afraid, start shivering probably from fear cause its way too hot here to shiver like its cold, and always brush off the topic.

Maybe I know why.

Just yesterday the teachers started acting like this, after a girl had gotten detention. Next day she was nowhere to be found, so maybe that explains it.

Even I don't know, *where her body went.*

The very next day after her getting detention, when I had gone into this particular washroom, I saw her there. Dead. On the floor. Obviously I started freaking out, cause her body just wasn't right. Her head, it was completely twisted, as in her back and her head, both were facing upwards. Her eyes were open, bloodshot red, and I could see dry, red tear marks on her cheeks. 

Boy, what the hell did the murderer do to her? Cause the weirdest thing about this corpse was that on her right arm was something carved out so dreadfully, it was not red at all. All the blood had totally gushed out onto the floor.

*OOW. OOR.*

Thats what was carved into her hand. Well, this is weird. OOW is the name of a boys-school in the area where our school's located.

But there's OOR as well, so I can't take that, maybe, a guy from OOW killed this girl. Why would that even happen tho. Its nothing like their school has something against ours. Pft, me and my weird af brain.

Ok, back to the story. So, as I was saying, I was freaking out over this weirdly dead body, so i went to get a teacher, but when I came back with her, the body was no where to be found. Its like it vanished into thin air. Not one drop of blood was to be seen.

No matter how much I told the teacher about the corpse she wouldn't believe me. Well, practically who would without seeing the body. She then started scolding me on how I could've used some other schools name instead of OOW. Ok, I know that's weird, its cause our school is practically the girl version of OOW, and apparently we've got something between us. Ik its weird. 

So then, after the long, and most uninteresting lecture on the most uninteresting topic, I got that, Detention. Woohoo, it feels great being the second girl in our school to get detention. Not.

(Detention room)

Ok, so for detention, they brought me to a room which I've never noticed before, even tho I went through these corridors a million times. The room looked nothing like the other rooms in the school, the walls were totally white, the door was nearly invisible, and the room was very cold, even tho there were no windows and there wasn't an air conditioner as well. This place was making me very giddy. Nothing was normal here, thats for sure.

Even the teacher wasn't normal. He looked really afraid, and kept whimpering occasionally. Like something was just gonna creep upon him and kill him. Probably what happened to that girl as well.

I wanted (and needed) to kill some time, so I asked to go to the washroom. When I asked him, he flinched real bad, and let me go in a hurry.

While going through the corridors, I could only think one thing

*This didn't feel safe at all.*

I felt really exposed. Not what I feel here normally. The washroom was just as bad. Lights flickering, taps not working, man this isn't my school.

While going back to my class I heard a scream coming from the detention room. Running in, I saw the teacher jumping of the window, screaming, "DON'T COME NEAR ME! SPARE ME! TAKE THE GIRL THERE!"

When he said that and had jumped, I felt a cold wind go through me. That when I realized..

*I wasn't alone even though I was*

Running out, I screamed at the sight of a boy wearing a familiar uniform. But he just wasn't normal. Well only his eyes weren't. They kept changing colour, and anger was visible in his eyes. Then it went pitch black.

Later when I woke up, I saw him standing in front of me with his hands in his pocket, still glaring at me, with a small smirk. Idk how he did that but if anyone could do that, its him.

"So," he said, in a normal boyish voice "You're awake huh?"

"Where am I?" I asked, obviously getting scared.

"In your school, of course." he said, in a matter-of-fact voice. "U think I'll be able to carry you away? Heck, you're heavy af"

"WTH?" I asked him getting angry, but his eyes went flaming red, which made me tiny instantly.

"Don't you think," he said, taking a knife out of his pocket, "You should be punished? For seeing my personal thing?"

"What are you talking about?" I said, then remembered the girl's body I saw that morning. "Wait, wait, wait. You're the one who killed that girl?" I asked, not knowing how I figured it out my self.

"You're amusing."

"Oh yeah? Well, I find it amusing how you're in my school. Cause you're not from here thats for sure. You're from the boys school."

"Indeed I am." He said, going back. "I just came to take revenge."

"Revenge? What revenge could you take by killing an innocent girl?" I asked

His eyes went black, as in normal. Now I realized, I was talking to a paranormal thing.

"You wanna know? Ever heard of the ARI rumor?"

Yeah I had.  Its pretty popular here. ARI stands for Ayush Rape Incident. Back when OOW and my school was one school, apparently a guy named Ayush tried to rape a girl, in the school campus, and that caused a controversy so cause of that our schools split. Also, that Ayush guy committed suicide after.

"So you do know," he said, probably reading my mind. "You might not know that Ayush is actually..... me."

He said that with his head down, while I stood there just shocked. Ok, never expected that a ghost could get sad, and never expected that I'd meet this guy. 

"....So? Why the revenge?"

He looked at me with grey eyes this time, which practically meant he was sad.

"That wasn't true at all. I didn't try to rape the girl, yet you all only believe that. There was a girl at the time, who had a crush on me. Even tho I rejected her non stop, she wouldn't stop. Then she spread the rumor that I raped her, for what reason I've no idea. Also I never committed suicide, she and her friends literally poisened me to death and then spread the rumor that I killed myself cause I was guilty."

I couldn't believe my ears. The rumor our school's been believing for so long, and that it was the boys' fault that we split, but it was actually because of girls, was just so much to take in.

"Oh...my." I said, trying to digest what he just said. 

"Every one was excited to come to this building back then, but we split and got another building. We never even wanted to split, so after killing that girl, I think I got some peace." He said, eyes piercing right through me now.

"Wait," I said, processing what he just said, "Why did you kill that girl tho? The one I saw the body of?"

"Her sister was the one who had a crush on me. And she was the one who gave her sister the idea to kill me." He said, eyes turned red now.

"W-what was OOR btw?"

I asked tryna change the subject.

"Our Own Revenge. But now," He said, pausing. And the smirk is back. "Shouldn't I finish my business here? And kill you?"  
He said, eyes turned blue now.

"Woah, woah, woah." I said, backing off, "If you're angry that our school split, then why don't you just kill the guy who had the idea of splitting us in the first place?"

Woah, I said it in the most casual way

That made him stop on his tracks, and his eyes changed again to black. Just great.

"I guess I could do that. Yeah That might actually work"

"Y-yes." I said, getting kinda happy.

"But," he said, turning to me. "There's no telling who you might tell all this to."

Before I could say anything, he ran towards me and thrust the knife through my shoulder. 

&#x200B;

"Oh my," I gasped, getting up with my bed nearly completely wet from me sweating cold sweat, probably from the nightmare.

Phew, It was just a dream. Just a dream.... Gosh why would I get such a dream?

Going into the bathroom, I spotted a part of my shirt near my shoulder wet. When I removed the cloth off the area, I saw a huge scar.

*what the heck?*

Going into the living room, my sister said something that made shivers run down my spine

"Hey sis, did you hear? Mr. L. K. Ladoo was murdered this morning? His head and his back was facing upwards and OOW. OOR was carved into his hand. So weird right?"

Falling into the sofa, I realized

I had caused a murder.

If you ever find yourself wandering through a patch of woods you might stumble across a bar. If you're not already running for your life from some monster previously unknown to man then you better start hauling ass into that bar because it is right behind you and it's probably hungry.

Hi my name's Walter but almost everyone calls me Walt, I work at a bar made by, run by, and made for monsters. Now I know you want to know where to find this place but don't try. It's impossible, only employees and monsters/people who are in danger can get here. Now I know that doesn't make sense but that's because of what my boss does to the place, His name is William Crow and he is the strongest guy we have here and also the co owner and  co founder of this place and he does some magic bs in order to make this place and I'm quoting "I want this place to be like a sanctuary to people and monster alike."

Now before I give you the rundown of the monsters working here I'll tell you what I look like. I stand at an even 10 feet tall and have a deer skull with sharp edges and almost no fur or flesh. I look like a wendigo is what everyone said when I first came in here until I showed them what I could do. I can grow more powerful the less monstrous I look, here's what I mean normally I look all dear skull when I need more power because fighting other monster is something I have to do daily, I get more flesh on my bones and shrink a bit, this keeps going until I turn into a normal deer with only whites in his eyes and I can go bipedal. Now that's one thing but here is another I can't die, here's what's up when I take lethal physical damage my body turns into ash and then a few seconds later I get dropped into reality by a black tentacle crow says a dark god favors me.

Now I'm gonna tell you who my co workers are, Bruno the vampire, Bruno is my best fucking friend he's a cool Hispanic  man he's 7'2 and old he is so old he forgot his last name that's why he only goes by Bruno, He's a handsome bastard he has a six pack and is generally very muscular with a beard and he has the same thing I have with power but he gets uglier until he goes full nosferatu, claw fingered hunch back with pale white skin and he has no hair on his body he can run so fast you'd expect him to catch fire he can also fly in this form and can also tank the damage the sun does to his body.

Sir Normand S Rockefeller Norm is our resident zombie man and also probably the second strongest guy here next to crow that is. also yes he is a Rockefeller not one's in the history books because Crow found him in an alternate universe. now here is the thing the reason Norm is so strong is well in the alternate universe he was found in to make a zombie you need sentimental things around, and get this he was brought back in his old home with his family graveyard in the back, so this necromancer made a super zombie who is the one who sunk a Carrabin island neither Crow or Norm will tell me which one though but I'm starting to suspect that it was Cuba.

Terry Cue terry is odd he's and undead monster but no one know what he is supposed to be he is tall 6'10 and just weird better if I describe him. he has a massive muscular body but it all looks like it rotting but it never actually rots and if you look at him for long then it looks like his body is rotting away until you can see his bone but glance away for 1 second and his body  is back. His body is harder than steel and is resistant to any kind of damage. His legs are like dog legs and very muscular. His neck is long and flexible but still still hard and last he has prehensile tentacles that are also strong as steel.

tiffany blue tiffany is a shape shifter that can multiply but the kind who keeps their strength, speed and weight after they transform tiffany's favorite form is other people no one has seen her true form not even crow she's usually some Paris runway model though.

now these are the ones that have been working at the bar for centuries the newest person is terry followed by me and you're probably wondering why I'm allowed to tell you this well that's because of a bet I made with crow a few years back, I said "hey can I write the stuff happening here down?" and then he said "when we get 2 new hires at the same time". well guess what happened we got 3. It's been like 4 months since then but I want to do it now. The first one is Damion the werewolf. He's just an ordinary werewolf, he's strong, fast with great senses and he does know his way around a bar.

maria the ghost bot she is a ghost in the body of an advanced robot that crow build for her I swear this man is insane, this robot is actually a pre made robot that came in pieces that crow stole from a military outpost on the same earth he found Norm an earth that is about 230 year ahead of us who knew. After she was built, me and Bruno have spent the last 2 months modifying the absolute shit out of her body, some already preloaded options on the robot repair and modification workshop and some we just made like the hidden rocket launch. She is also built like a robot spider.

Finally we get to Tiffany the demon. She looks like a demon with charcoal black skin, large bat wings, long tail horns and cloven hooves. Tiffany can breathe fire and can control people using the power of seductions. She is also an amazing fighter so she's a bouncer.

ok now its time to get to the big boss crow he is an eccentric gay man who looks like a normal person but trust me he isn't, he wears  a fedora dress shoes dress pants a long sleeved shirt with the sleeves rolled up and a striped dress vest witch he looks fucking great in. he knows many types of magic and uses them all the time he is also the physically strongest man here but just barely but over all could kill all of us if he wanted to,  he's not around a lot he's usually jumping around the cosmos discovering new things sometimes he brings back cool shit like the laser gun we stuck onto maria but that's kina it.

welp that's it for part 1 I need to get back to work but I will be talking about some of the crazier things to happen here. Like that time me and Bruno served a time traveling Australian man who gave me and Bruno a damascened claymore that Bruno spent a week sharpening until it was clean enough to shave with I know because he did just that. I'll talk about that next time so stay safe and stay tuned.

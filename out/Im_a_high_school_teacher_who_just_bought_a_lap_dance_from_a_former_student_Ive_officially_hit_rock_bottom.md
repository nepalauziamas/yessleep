I was on the wrong side of forty, newly divorced, and had to penny-pinch by spending $19.13 on three liters of Kirkland Signature moonshine because most of my paycheck had been converted to one-dollar bills.

I was headed to the Zoom Room.

I got a pretty good buzz going in the parking lot before ditching the moonshine in the trunk of my Yugo. I didn’t want to get thrown in the gutter again by Big Huell.

Yep. That’s my life. 

I certainly didn’t plan it this way. I had been adrift after my Army discharge, waiting for a sign. I found it when I cried the first time watching *Stand and Deliver*, and had committed myself to a life of teaching by the fifth viewing. I really wanted to make a difference in kids’ lives.

So I was horrified when I realized where I recognized the new Zoom Room girl’s face. 

Shit. What was her name? Sandra? *Samantha,* that was it. Kind of a pain in the ass, but really pulled it together just before graduation. 

By the way – remember how students talked about teachers behind their backs? Yeah, teachers do the same. 

So I’d hoped that Samantha had really found a new path with her senior year turnaround, and had maybe gone on to college. Based on the quantity of dollar bills in her g-string, though, it seems that her alternative career choice had proven more lucrative than my own. 

And despite our diverging life choices, five years later we now found ourselves in the exact same place as one another. 

Shit. She was walking in my direction. Why was she walking in my direction? Did I look like a man who was *that* desperate for companionship?

I decided not to think too deeply on that question. Instead, I slinked down as low as I could, gently ripping the soles of my shoes off of the very sticky floor as I re-positioned my legs in front of me. With any luck, she’d walk right past me and offer her wares to a more desperate-looking loner. 

She stopped and sat on my lap. 

Okay, what were the options? She probably wouldn’t recognize me. Would *you* recognize your senior year English teacher half a decade after graduation when both of you were in a dark room where you didn’t expect to meet? No way. I was just another client to Samantha. Part of my brain told me to just *go* with it, that we weren’t breaking any rules. 

Then a stronger voice told me that I couldn’t be *that* guy, that some lines shouldn’t be crossed, and that I had some standards, goddamn it.

But when she brushed her chest up against my face and whispered in my ear, for the *life* of me I could not remember what I’d just been thinking as the world got all floopy.

“Come with me into the Zoom Boom Room,” she whispered.

No. Uh-uh. *Hard* pass. That was where the dancers turned tricks on lonely guys who were too pathetic to decline an offer from a pretty smile. If anyone found out I’d paid for *sex* instead of just a lap dance, I’d lose my job. Fortunately, I had stronger mental fortitude than the typical creep who wandered into the Zoom Room on a Tuesday afternoon.

I looked around dazedly to realize that we were alone in a back room. 

“Shit! Did I just mindlessly follow you here while my brain was hazy?”

Instead of answering, she ran her fingernails down my arm, leaving a trail of goosebumps in her wake. 

“Um. Did you know that the scientific name for ‘goosebumps’ is ‘piloerection’?”

Why. Why did I say *that?* God damn, I need a filter on my mouth that weeds out all the stupid shit before it permeates the room like an onion fart.

She giggled. “You were always trying to teach us the most *interesting* things, Mr. Namathal.”

My balls froze. “You, ah, remember me?” 

She giggled again, and the front lobes of my brain felt like clocks in a Salvador Dali painting. “Of course I remember you, Mr. Namathal.” She pushed me onto the couch, and I collapsed with absolutely zero resistance or dignity. Then Samantha crawled on top of me, bending down to kiss my neck. “You always loved telling me what to do.” She squeezed my thigh.

My mind snapped to attention. “No.” I scrambled out from underneath her. “No, no, *no*. Samantha, this is below the dignity of both of us.”

“Your fly is open,” she smirked, one eyebrow raised.

I looked down to find that my erection was prominently poking through the zipper of my jeans, though the top button was still fastened. “What the fuck? I don’t even remember-”

“I opened it,” she whispered, standing up and forcing me into a corner. “I’ve got a lot more *very* special talents that I’d like to show you,” she cooed, pressing me against the bricks.

“No! I can’t be *that* guy, I’m sorry, I just can’t!” I yelped, pulling myself out from her grasp with great difficulty. 

It’s funny how we assume that men are stronger than women, because I feel so goddamn weak when one of them touches my skin in just the right way.

“You don’t want me to show you everything I’ve learned?” she pouted. “[I’ve got a very detailed sex blog that you’d like](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitesofDesire/).”

I was actually considering it, so I knew I had to get the hell out of there. So I turned around, dick still protruding, and walked toward a door. “Where’s the exit, Samantha? I don’t remember how we got in-”

“Stop!” she yelled as I opened the nearest one. 

I wasn’t going to fall for any more of her wily tricks, though, so I shot through the door. 

Into the biggest arsenal I’d ever seen.

Three women were inspecting weapons. I recognized them as Trudy, Coco, and Stardust. They were all dressed in skimpy underwear and eight-inch plastic heels as they loaded bullets into their AR-15s. The whole scene looked like a shitty poster from the inside of my Uncle Herbert’s trailer.

“What the fuck are you doing?” Coco screamed, aiming the barrel of her weapon at me. 

“Don’t shoot him!” Samantha screamed, barging into the room and slamming me into the wall. My dick hit the wood square on, and I collapsed to the floor in pain. 

Do you have any idea how badly it hurts to get smacked in the boner? 

Pray that you never will. 

In the cloud of pain that followed, I was vaguely aware of Samantha guiding me as I staggered back into the Zoom Boom Room and collapsed onto the couch. Once the pain had subsided enough to once again understand human language, I struggled to figure out what was going on.

She was sitting on the other end of the sofa, head in her hands. 

“I’m so sorry, Mr. Namathal. Really, I am.” She looked up at me, and her cheeks were streaked with far too much mascara. It was base, real, and the most honest face I had seen in longer than I could remember. I realized, for the first time, that there was more beauty behind the makeup.

“Okay,” I breathed, trying to integrate the disparate bits of information that had assaulted my mind in the past five minutes, “it’s okay, Samantha. Look, I’ll just go out the correct door this time. I think I need a good crotchal icing.”

She sniffed and shook her head. “You don’t *get* it. You can’t just leave.”

The hairs on the back of my neck stood up. “Um. Does this have anything to do with the large quantity of weapons I saw in the other room?”

She glared back at me, exasperated. “Yes this has to do with the large quantity of weapons you saw in the other room,” she deadpanned. Then she sighed and lowered her head back into her hands. “There’s no point in secrets anymore, so I might as well tell you.”

I shifted uncomfortably in my seat.

“You must know by now that this place is much more than a strip club,” she mumbled through her fingers. “A *lot* more. This guy, Ace, lives in Vegas, but he owns the Zoom Room. No one thinks that an isolated brothel in rural Louisiana would have anything to do with him, so this is where he makes his trades.”

“Trades?” I asked, tentatively spreading my legs apart to see if I could still move.

Samantha dropped her hands to her knees and turned to face me, exasperated. “Human trafficking. Girls disappear to and from here without anyone batting an eye. It’s the perfect conduit.”

The farthest corner of my mind realized that I had taught her a word that she remembered. Maybe my existence had turned the smallest gear in the world, and maybe that was enough.

She ran her fingers through her hair. “Girls appear. Girls disappear. What could any of us do? We’re trying to run from bills faster than they can chase us, and if we leave something behind to stay ahead, that’s a day well spent.”

That hit me harder than I’d expected. I only ever took single-dollar bills to the strip club, and for the first time, I considered what that said about the value I placed on the women who worked for them.

“But,” Samantha continued, her voice growing softer, “it looks like Ace needs big money.” She stared darkly at me, and for the first time, I really met her gaze. “We’re all scheduled to go away. Tonight. Every girl who works here. We know what this means, and we can’t ignore it any longer.”

“You mean…” I couldn’t finish my sentence. 

“There’s no reason *not* to fight back when you’re about to lose everything,” she explained darkly. “Once Coco stabbed Ace’s gun runner, the rest of us were all in. Ace’s guys wanted us to entertain them before taking us away. Every client here today works for him.” She looked pityingly at me. “Well, all of them but one. They picked a Tuesday to move us, assuming the regulars had other things going on in the middle of the week and the place would be empty.”

Well *that* was an awkward silence.

“I’m so sorry, Mr. Namathal. I tried to get you away from everything before it happened, I really did. You were always so good to me.” She reached out, squeezed my hand, and smiled sadly. “But you saw what you weren’t supposed to, and the rest of the girls want you dead. A lot of lives are at stake tonight, and they’re willing to sacrifice just one.” 

I scrambled to my feet, temporarily ignoring the throbbing pain in my joystick. “Whoa, *whoa,* WHOA, let’s back things up a bit. I’ll just head out and pretend none of this-”

“They’re blocking every door, and are listening to us right now,” she whispered sadly. “I really feel awful about this, Mr. Namathal.” She frowned. “Sometimes, your best just isn’t good enough.”

Terror overwhelmed me, and I realized that I’d never truly been *afraid* until that moment. It’s amazing how quickly the wheels can turn in our heads when they *have* to. “Okay, okay, wait. To everyone listening to me, *wait.*” 

Two doors opened. Coco and Stardust emerged, each aiming their weapon at me.

I was mostly scared, but *slightly* aroused. 

“Stop,” I ordered weakly. “Just hear me out.”

Slowly, I looked at each of them in turn. 

I took a deep breath. “You’re holding the stock below your armpit. Once you start firing, you won’t be able to control where the bullets go. A lot of people are going to die, and not the ones you want.”

I looked back at Samantha.

“I have a lot of weapons experience from my Army days. Let me help you. We’ll fight back [together](https://www.facebook.com/P-F-McGrail-181784199029462/).”

Do you believe in the supernatural and the things that go bump in the night.
I surely didn't until my wife was acting unusual. Let me start from the beginning for more context. It was late winter and my wife and I were heading to our cabin in the middle of the Canadian woods near lake Chandos about five miles away from the nearby settlement. It's a nice secluded oak tavern no different to any you see in the movies, with the lake only 500 yards from the front of the tavern. During this time of the year the lake is frozen due to the extreme cold but still showing its natural beauty. 'are we there yet'
My wife called out frustrated, 
Almost there' I retorted, barely holding my own frustration.

 It had been a long 5 hour trip from our summer home traveling was not the easiest during this time, we had to take many road dentures adding many hours to our journey. Plus my wife's constant belittling of me made the journey a lot more harder than utvakready was.
Look out! 
I was so busy in my own thoughts that the sudden shouting coming from my wife took me out of my thoughts. I slammed on the brakes near meters from the deer. As I look Up from the wheel I saw the deer's face staring at me. An odd sensation fell before me. A mocking and sadistic tone emanating from those cold and life
les s black eyes
Dan! Dan!


I was shot back and heard my wife screaming at me
What the fuck dan you almost got us killed with your incompetent driving.
Sorry 
Sorry? Is that all you got to say sorry, jeez.
She slapped me over the head gesturing not to that again
Ow!
I turned to face her but something caught my eyes. Something in the distance is heading straight towards us.
'Whats the matter now you pale as a fucking ghost'? She snarkly said I pointed out the 'window on her side and she looked 
'There's nothing there dumbass'
'Could I be imaging those two glowing eyes, there's no way I can't just imagine them, 'they were just there?' 

'Can you turn on the engine we still got 30 min before we get to our cabin she retorted angrily'
She punched me and I got out of my daze 
I started up the engine and headed off toward our cabin. Still pondering the two glowing eyes I saw. The snow was getting heavier making it harder to see the road. 
Luckily we made it to the cabin. Before the snow really turned on us. 

'Finally where here' I exclaimed happily that the long five hour drive is don't 
Yeah and almost killing us my wife muttered as she exited the car
'I'll start the fire' 
No reassuring reads came from my wife except a grunt.

I sighed as I headed towards the cabin towards the firepit. The cabin wasn't the best, it was passed down from my father and so on so it was kinda a family heirloom. My wife doesn't see the beauty as she huffs and heaves her luggage towards the upstairs bedroom. As I lit the fire I noticed an uneasy feeling. It felt like something was watching me peering into the depths of my soul. This unnerving feeling brought chills to my spine. I looked over to make sure my wife was okay. The light from the fire flickers, making my shadow dance. I stood up and turned around and my jaw dropped. I turned as white as a ghost and before two long I was staring at the same two white eyes that eye mere moment while getting here.

My stomach dropped and all my fears came true. Staring down the two eyes I couldn't move I was frozen in panic the whole world stood still that very instant. I was too afraid to move. I don't want to provoke the creature whatever it was standing outside my window. The only thing that broke my stance was my wife screaming at me.the eyes darted around my living room and quickly vanished as a loud scream echoed throughout the cabin. I ran up to see my wife throwing the lamp at me screaming as I entered the bedroom screaming  about god knows what this. 

The lamp hit my face causing blood to rush down my face. My wife was screaming at me about something but I couldn't focus. All I could focus on was the splitting headache and the blood trickling down my face. I looked at her in pure disgust.

17 years I put up with this 17 long years you treated me with disrespect.
"Fuck of and die you worthless shit you've never down anything for me!"
With those stinging words I felt my world shatter all these times she never loved me.
I turned around and ran down the stairs
Towards my car I got in and drove All the while my wife was cursing and throwing abusive slurls at me. The nearest town  was about five miles 1 hours trip. That's all the time I needed to clear my head. I made it to town just before sunset. I headed towards the bar. 

It was a rudimentary and old style bar resembling a 1950 bar. It was a hell a lot better being here than at my house at the moment. The atmosphere was very welcoming unlike my home. I went into the bar and ordered a double shot of whisky with chips. The first thing I noticed about this bar wasn't the decor resembling the 50s, it was the giant skull perched up on the bar table. I look Up at it with awe and fear. Know that such a creature could easily hunt us down. 
"It's called the wendigo an native monster to this parts"

I looked around and saw a person sitting alone.
"Pardon me?"
"It's a wendigo skull"
"I looked back in amazement" 
"But I thought these creatures were stuff of legends" do they still exist?
"Very much if you see two glowing eyes 
Your fate is sealed" the old gizzer grunted 
Two glowing eyes I thought to myself what a  joke. After a good solid ten minutes I then realised.

"Shit shit!" 
"What's up boy?"
"You said that wendigo eyes glow white right"?
"Yes" he retorted back
"My wife is in a lot of danger"
"Come again lad"
"On the way here I nearly hit a dear and when I looked out I saw two glowing eyes but my wife didn't, the next incident was when I was light the flame and out the window"

"Well not you better drive home quickly"
I ran out of the bar as quickly as I could not worrying about the seatbelt as I sped off. All I could worry about is my wife. My  wife Evelyn. I couldn't get the thought of her dead on the couch with her guts ripped out or her head ripped off. All I could do was speed down the road. I hit 90miles per hour. I could feel my car shaking as it wasn't meant to go this fast but that wasn't the least of my concern. 
My face went pale as I drove up the drive and saw big marks on the ground leading up the way toward the cabin. 

I got my flashlight and ran through the blistering cold to see the door off its hinges. My heart sank when I saw the state of the door. I moved the door and all of my colour drained from my body. My home was wrecked there when there were signs of a fight and struggle. Blood was covering the floor in one corner and up the wall. I feared the worst. My wife may have been slaughtered by the wendigo. I looked around and my heart jumped when I heard 
"Dan?"

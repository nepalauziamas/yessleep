 In 2015, I was staying at a friend's house and we were up until the sun rose. I got into bed and I was awoken suddenly by the sound of loud "whooshes" that I heard in my head. They are hard to describe, but picture yourself standing right next to a big, industrial sized, metal fan and imagine the sound it would make as one of the heavy metal blades passes by at a slow to medium pace - a low, powerful, and repetitive whoosh. The head whooshes sounded like that, and its the only way I can think of how to describe them. They would begin softly, and quickly increase in volume and frequency until they would sound so close that I would be jolted awake. Sometimes it would happen several times in a row, making the act of falling asleep frustrating and frightening. This always occurs at that ambiguous moment right before slipping into unconsciousness and after it began, it left me with a lot of questions:

Am I imagining this? Is there something medically wrong with me, my brain, or my ears? Can I stop it? What would happen if I somehow learned to ignore it? Would I slip across the threshold of consciousness into sleep? Could it damage my ears and my ability to play music? Is it linked to the mild tinnitus I experience?

Some time passed, and it would occur intermittently. The head whooshes would return for a few nights, and then I would sleep normally for months. I hypothesized that it was somehow connected to my tinnitus and the ear issues I had as a child, and I went as far as to make lifestyle changes like quitting smoking and eschewing animal products in my diet, which I heard can improve things, and it did for a while. One night, after having my sleep interrupted yet again, I did some frantic googling and learned about a rare condition called “Exploding Head Syndrome”, which sounds a lot more dramatic than it actually is. EHS refers to the phenomenon of hearing screaming voices, gunshots, or explosions caused by your brain as you fall asleep. These auditory hallucinations are exacerbated by lack of sleep, and are believed by some to be a way for your brain to “test” itself to make sure you are not dead, similar to the common experience of feeling like you are falling before jolting awake in the safety of your bed. There is no remedy and the cause is unknown.

The independent research I conducted provided some helpful information, but I felt like it was not the whole story. I realized that a lack of sleep is definitely connected to my experience, however I didn’t see any mention of a whooshing noise that got progressively louder. I was almost certain that it was not an auditory hallucination because it happened the exact same way, every single time. Something was causing this, but I was still not sure what. I began to cope with it by listening to music or podcasts as I fell asleep, which seemed to provide enough distraction on particularly bad nights to allow me to pass into dreamland.

The information I learned about EHS satisfied my curiosity for a while. More time passed and the head whooshes randomly interrupted my sleep until this past April, when I finally discovered the exact reason why I was experiencing this. I was on vacation with my girlfriend in San Antonio and after several nights of little sleep, the wooshes returned in full force. I decided once again to scour the internet for information at fuck o'clock in the morning and I discovered the Exploding Head Syndrome subreddit. After reading through dozens of posts, and even posting myself, I found a diamond in the rough; a comment describing the exact “head whooshes” that I experience! Apparently they are more commonly referred to as “ear rumbles” and I found this fascinating twitter thread about the phenomenon that I will link at the end. Here is what I learned:

There is a muscle in your ear called the Tensor Tympani, and there is a portion of the population that can voluntarily flex it and create ear rumbles. You can produce these by closing your eyes tightly which results in a rumbling sound around where your ear drum is. It literally sounds like a drum roll on a timpani! Some folks can flex Tensor Tympani easily, without having to close their eyes at all, and are able to produce ear rumbles on command that are loud enough to block out sounds. Sure enough, I have this mediocre “superpower” as some describe it, and have been able to do it my entire life. After years of experiencing this phenomenon, I finally came to the realization that these are the head whooshes I have been experiencing. For whatever reason, when I am particularly sleep deprived, I involuntarily flex the Tensor Tympany with increasing intensity and regularity right as I begin to fall asleep, producing these whooshes or ear rumbles. When I reproduce the noise when I am conscious, the sound is identical. I cannot begin to describe the relief when I discovered the answer. It was a challenge to try and describe and pinpoint this elusive and upsetting experience, if I was experiencing it at all. For those who are gifted with, or are curious about this strange ability, you can find more information on the subreddit [r/EarRumblersUnite](https://www.reddit.com/r/EarRumblersUnite/).

Thanks for listening to my story, I would love to hear from whoever reads it. I haven’t shared it with many people, and it would be cathartic to know someone out there has heard what I have to say about this weird journey I went on.

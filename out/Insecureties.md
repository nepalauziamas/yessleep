This park is practically empty in the evening. It always is. A girl no older than 25 walks by. She quickly glances at me, and speeds up. My mind began to race.

"Why is she looking at me like that?"

"Does she think I'm trouble?"

"Do I look that suspicious?"

"I don't look suspicious." I reassure myself.  "Plus, she doesn't know me. So of course, she would give me that look. I'm a complete stranger."

I go a little further and look behind me. I still see her, but she doesn't see me. "Perfect." I think. I turn around and begin to follow her home. 

A few minutes later, she looks behind her. I quickly dodge her view and hide behind a nearby tree. My mind again begins to race.

"Does she know someone's following her?"

"Did she see me?"

I again reassure myself. "How many times have I done this? Around 10, and not a single person noticed me." 

I continue to follow her home.

She arrives at her house and enters it. I wait for a few minutes and go behind her house. I peek through a back window. I see her go upstairs. After scanning the room a few times, I became certain she lived alone. I checked if she left her window unlocked. She did, and I was able to open it and silently go inside.

I hear water running, so I'm sure she's in the bathroom. I silently creep upstairs. Suddenly the water stops. I can't find a good place to hide. She's going to see me. She opens the door, sees me, and screams. She runs into the nearest room and locks the door. My mind races even more.

"She knows."

"The police are probably on their way."

"What am I going to do?"

I had an idea. I went back downstairs and into the kitchen. I grabbed the biggest, sharpest knife she had. and went back upstairs. I started to pound on her door. She started screaming for me to leave her alone. I want going to do that. I started to kick her door. It took 2 solid kicks before the door gave way. I readied my knife prepared to do what I had to. She was in a corner, silently sobbing. She knew what I was going to do. I raised my knife. Before I did it, my mind raced.

"Is this worth it?"

"Am I really going to go through with this?"

"I've done this before," I reassure myself. "It's worth it. Plus, I always get away before the police arrive."

I hear sirens, so I have to do this quick. in a burst of confidence, I go through with it.

I stab her in the neck. Shes not going to make it through that. I heard police enter the house and swarm the place. They found me standing over her dead body. I needed to escape, and the police were blocking the door. So, I did the only thing I thought I could do. I charged at them with my knife in hand. One of the policemen drew his gun and shot me. I collapse to the floor. My mind raced for the last time.

"I knew I was too suspicious."

"Maybe if I entered the house a few minutes later this wouldn't have happened."

This time no reassuring voice came in my head. There was nothing I could think to make myself feel better. As my consciousness fades, I think one last thing. "That girl is going with me to the depths of hell." My consciousness fades completely, leaving my body there. Alone.

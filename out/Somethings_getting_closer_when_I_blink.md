Last month, something caught my attention. Something dark and blurry. I tried to look at it but the moment I focused on the thing, it vanished. I was freaked out but then again it is getting pretty late at the time.

I started to think about freaky stuff, theorizing about what it was. On one point I imagined that it was something from the Conjuring, that really messed me up.

"*Fuckin' hell, I guess it is pretty late. Time to go to bed I guess"* I said.

That night, I dreamed of floating. I was stuck in the air. It was quite peaceful, yet ominous. Nothing else was in the dream except for me. Everything around me is pitch black, like a void. I tried shouting into it but nothing happened. From that point onward, I can't quite remember what happened in the remaining part of the dream. All I remember is that the void permeates everything.

"*Bzzzzzt! Bzzzzzt!"* The alarm went off. It is 8am in the morning. I slept like a cat, it felt very good. I sat straight up and started contemplating about the thing from last night. I stopped myself from contemplating, I've a feeling I'd freak myself if I continue. 

Carrying on after that, I started my daily routine: eat breakfast, brush the teeth, and take a bath. After that back to work. My schedule for this day and yesterday does not require me going into the office. So I fired up my desktop, opened up my work profile and wait for something to happen.

*"It's gonna be one of those slow days."*

I sat in my chair waiting. Got bored so I grabbed my phone and started to watch something on YouTube.

*"Maaaannnnn, nothing's good here either."* I said in an annoyed voice.

So I leaned back into my chair, unfolded the footrest and started to contemplate. I was thinking about the current events going off at Ukraine and the US. Then I blinked and there it was, that **thing**. I rubbed my eyes and blinked multiple times, **it's gone**.

I didn't really see or catch a proper glimpse of it but it unsettles me.

This goes on for a couple of days and I just keep getting unsettled. **Then it moved**. I was terrified not because that it moved its arm or something. It was because it inched closer.

At this point, adrenaline was starting to build up. Activating the fight or flight response. I calmed myself down by chugging the matcha tea that I made that morning. I then started to really think about it.

*Am I going insane? What's going to happen now?*

These thoughts kept circling my head, then I remembered. Back when I was a kid, I was big on horror stuff. I stumbled upon this shady Japanese site about folk lore. It had an instruction for a game where you play with a yokai.

The game plays out like this: whenever you blink an apparition appears somewhere always not visible, yet noticeable. The goal of the game is to catch that **thing** by basically doing a scissor motion with your hands and saying "I caught you!" while facing it.

The game states that in order to play, you must forfeit your life and allow the spirits to guide you to access have "fun" with the yokai. I tried it out back then and followed the instructions to the letter. After doing it, nothing really happened. So I went with my jolly day.

Thinking back on it now, I noticed one crucial detail. I am missing a total of 5 minutes in my life. I apparently passed out when doing the game ritual. I have had no recollection of this.

*But why now?*

That question popped up in my head and has bugged me up until the present. But let's not talk about the present. After that I blinked out of reflex, and that **thing** popped out below my desk just inches away from my feet. I jumped out of my chair and carefully inspected under my desk. **NOTHING**. Recalling back on the moment, it has formed a face. I cannot recall features but I am certain that it was a face.

Ever since that event, it hasn't showed up since and I have developed a fear in blinking. It has honestly kept me up at night and sleep isn't getting better. I have booked an appointment for a psychiatrist for a psych eval. Half hoping that I'm just getting crazy.

Every time I blink I can feel its presence, waiting. I don't know if what I'm feeling is real or just a manifestation of the brain. I really hope it's the latter.

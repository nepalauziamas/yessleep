On the day of 1993, two different people gazed at each other not knowing it will change their lives. Boy was a poor, uneducated, dirty handed countryman, yet shiny and white girl's teeth were enough to tell Joseph they are from different worlds. Although a sincere flower, picked from Josephs moms garden, said more than a believed social difference built by generations could say. Time passed by and Annie fell in love. With time, boy became a man and girl became a woman. From fragility and innocence, sincerity and diligence, baby was born. Father and mother decided to name her Janna. 

&#x200B;

It's hard to tell when, but most likely 8 years after Janna's birth, Joseph's mom invited her family for a visit. Brain tumor spread and not much time left. 

&#x200B;

Now talking about Joseph's family, he was born in Chichester, small town in which his grandfather was a shoe maker, spending his free time in cheap taverns. Grandmother Iris, coming from a peasant family, was neither a loving mother, neither strict to her son Adam

&#x200B;

Adam, father of Joseph, grew a ferocious, despot man, who gave birth to two boys - Joseph and Saul.

For a 8 years old Janna, city of Chichester seemed like a new experience. Growing in a fast paced city, Chichester was a slow walk through beautiful village full of nature, big old trees and collapsing houses built hundreds of years ago. She felt as if in a fairy tale.

&#x200B;

One time, when all family spent their last meeting with Josephs mother, something odd was happening in the farm. Adam had a huge farm, grew pigs, a horse, two cows and an old dog. So that time entire herd started screaming. Adam, grabbing bat, ran towards the farm. Rest of the family sat in the kitchen, waiting for what's to happen. Time passed by and agonizing scream could still be heard from farm. Joseph stood up and ran to see what's happening, meanwhile little Janna, wanting to help her father, run towards the farm aswell. 

&#x200B;

In the corner of farm, a small room was built. Doors were broken and two eyes could be seen inside. Janna's legs weren't as long to run as fast as Joseph, so she got lost. Wandering around, hearing dreadful screams, she started getting scared. Suddenly, a hand showed up. - Come here, my baby - , the voice said. - Come here, my little girl. -, It was an old face of a cripple. Big gray eyes, dull gaze, reflecting the light of moon invited little Janna inside the dark, hidden room. Janna being hypnotized by the man, went further in. As she came closer and closer, shiny sharp thing appeared. 

&#x200B;

As agonizing screams could be heard in farm, no one believed those were the sounds made by a little child. At midnight they found a girl cut in pieces, thrown close to the farm. 

&#x200B;

Everyone believed it was done by Saul, brother of Joseph, a cripple who lived inside the farm.

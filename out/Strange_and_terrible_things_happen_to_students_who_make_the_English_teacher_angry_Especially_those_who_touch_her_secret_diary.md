Mrs. Hangyant was the kind of teacher you hoped never noticed you. To be the focus of her attention was to suffer in one way or another. She never praised students or even smiled at anyone. If she was looking at you, you were going to regret giving her cause to.

She was an older woman. Her eyes were a little too close together, and her brow was a thick wrinkly overhang that cast a shadow on her eyes, keeping them always dark. Her white hair was wispy and thin. She'd have done better to go bald or wear a wig or something, but she just kept the same curly perm even though her volume couldn't really sustain it.

She was the English teacher, but she sure as hell shouldn't have been. To her, teaching English meant exclusively teaching grammar. To her, English was simply a set of unbreakable rules. Worst of all, she hated fiction, and forced every class to write an essay on why made up stories are completely pointless. 

When I say "worst of all", of course I'm just talking about her crimes as a teacher. Her crimes as a...whatever the hell she really was--a witch, a demon--were quite a bit worse than making kids diagram sentences. 

One time a kid had his phone in class, and she caught him. This guy was a new guy, some kind of trouble kid who'd been bouncing around from school to school getting kicked out of all of them, so he thought he could handle any teacher I guess. But he didn't know Mrs. Hangyant.

She told him "give it to me now, or lose it forever." And he wouldn't. She grabbed for it, and he wouldn't let go. They stayed there like that, each holding one end of it. And, to the surprise of every kid in the class that day, she let go. She let him keep his phone. And for the rest of that day, Mr. Trouble Kid was a bit of a hero in our school that day. 

That was short lived. The next day he came to school without his phone and looking like he hadn't slept. He refused to talk about it, in fact threatened to beat up anyone who mentioned it. But someone's mom knew his mom, and word got around that he kept squealing in terror in the middle of the night at the top of every hour. In the morning his mom found his phone smashed on the floor. He'd taken a hammer to it at least twenty times, judging by the number of dents in the floor.

Was it making creepy sounds? Was he just having a nightmare? No one knows. But most of us are sure Mrs. Hangyant had something to do with it. He never carried a phone in school again.

Another time--this time I was actually in class to witness this--she sat at her desk and she pulled out the drawer where she kept the diary, and she stared silently.

"Who touched my Prayer Book?" she said, icy, still looking down at the drawer. That's what she called it. Her Prayer Book.

And of course no one said shit. 

She made us come up one by one to her desk and swear we had not touched it. And she looked into our eyes and just watched silently, and then sent each back to their desk. Timothy Glass wouldn't look her in the eye. Like, he didn't even try to hide it for some reason. He just looked down at the floor. 

When he sat back down she had that smug smirk on her face, and he sat there visibly terrified, shaking, barely able to speak when called on. But she didn't accuse him. She just tortured him in his fear. Called on him a lot for answers, knowing he was too scared to focus. And he wouldn't look at her at all, and she kept saying "please look at me when I'm talking to you, Timothy." And he just wouldn't. 

At the end of the period when we were all headed for the door she came up to him and put her hand on his arm, like she was stopping him to say something to him. But she said nothing. She stared at the place where she touched his arm, intense, like she was concentrating. Then she smiled and waved him on his way. 

He walked out of the class like the rest of us. But later that day, during a presentation he was doing in physics, he dropped straight down to the floor in the middle of a sentence in front of the whole class. He died on the way to the hospital.

Doctor said cerebral embolism. That's when a blood clot gets stuck in your brain and blocks your blood flow and you straight up just die out of nowhere. They can happen to anyone at any time as far as I understand, but they're more likely if you aren't moving much for a very long time. They blamed Tim's late night gaming.

So on the day I walked by her empty classroom and saw her diary open on her desk, I certainly had good reason to keep walking and ignore it. Why risk it? 

I'll tell you why.

My friend Riley is the nicest girl you ever knew. We've been friends since kindergarten and she's a goddamn treasure and everyone likes her because she's just one of those people who you just can't conceive being mean to. Most of the kids who Mrs. Hangyant punishes are kids who kinda more or less deserve it in a Roald Dahl kind of way. I mean, they don't deserve to freaking die, but you know what I mean. But Riley...no. No one messes with Riley. You just goddamn don't. 

Riley came to me one morning before classes started, looking mischievous. 

"I did it," she said. 

I asked her what, and she handed me a folder. I opened it and read what was inside. When I looked back up at her she was grinning. I wasn't. 

"Riley. Seriously. Don't. Please."

"I have to stand up for what I believe in."

"You suuure as hell don't."

In the folder was her essay for Hangyant. The one that was supposed to be about the pointlessness of fiction. But she hadn't written that. It was exactly the opposite. A joyful celebration of the power and wonder of fiction. Riley was a writer, and she had been ranting to me daily about Hangyant's anti-fiction bullshit, though she wisely kept her opinions to herself while in class.

She hadn't held back in this essay. Not only did she profess her love of fiction, her belief that it was essential to our human well being, she called out Mrs. Hangyant by name, calling her an 'ignorant witch' who uses fear to force her beliefs on the impressionable, the highest crime a teacher can commit. 

Today was the day we were to hand it in. 

After a quick glance at the hall clock and seeing that there was still a little time before class, I went into my backpack and I pulled out my own essay. "You've got fifteen minutes. Retype this in the lab and put your name on it. I'll tell her I forgot mine."

She looked at me with a strange look, like she was just seeing me for the first time or something. Then she punched me in the arm.

"Oh my god, shut up, no! I'm just kidding, Calvin!" She pulled from her backpack another identical folder and handed it to me. "I'm not going to hand that in. I just had to write it to counteract this bullshit."

The title of the 'bullshit' was "The Inanity of Artifice".

"God damn, Riley. Wow. You're going to get an A+ just for that title."

"I know. I'm disgusted with myself. Don't read it," she said, and she snatched it away from me.

As we came into Hangyant's class together, Riley was clutching a book in her hands as she told me all about it. She was still telling me as we sat, and even as Mrs. Hangyant asked us to take out our essays and lay them on our desks. She came by and picked them all up.

And then Riley stopped talking mid sentence. She just stared at me. 

"What?"

She didn't speak. She just leaned over the other side of her desk and dug in her bookbag. Then she got up out of her chair and approached Mrs. Hangyant's desk. I couldn't hear what she said, but Mrs. Hangyant wasn't having it. She was shaking her head. 

"Sit down, young lady."

Riley turned back. Tears were streaming down her cheeks. She was holding a folder in her hands. 

I realised with horror what had happened. She had accidentally turned in the wrong version of her essay. The honest version. 

I looked up at Mrs. Hangyant. Though normally she would have taken the essays home to grade, her curiosity was apparently piqued by Riley's desperation. She had Riley's folder open in front of her. She had on her face a cruel smirk as she read it. 

"Whatever happens," I hissed in an urgent whisper, "*don't let her touch you!*"

"Miss Dorset, please come up here." 

Riley looked at me, a quick glance, her face terrified. Pleading me to do something, or maybe just panicking. And I...I dunno. I had nothing. I couldn't think of any way to help her. Maybe that's just my excuse for being a goddamn coward. It sure doesn't feel good knowing I just sat there, right on the edge of my seat pretending like I was about to get up and do something, except probably I never even intended to do anything. 

"Is this essay a reflection of your true feelings?"

She took a deep breath, and nodded.

Mrs. Hangyant got up in front of the class. "Excuse me, everyone. Attention, please."

As if the class wasn't already perfectly silent, already fixated on the situation unfolding before them. Each one of them knowing they were witnessing the next legendary story of Mrs. Hangyant's cruelty, each one of them absorbing every detail of it in order to tell it later. 

"I know you all think I'm pointlessly cruel. That I just punish, punish, punish people I don't like." She seemed to be basking in the drama of the moment, the awe of the kids staring at her. 

"Jason, have I ever punished a student?"

Jason couldn't figure out how to lie to that. "...yes?"

"No. Wrong. I *correct*. I correct those of you who are able to be corrected. For others of you, I have no illusions about my powers as an educator. Your correction is beyond me."

She went to her desk, opened the special drawer, and brought out her diary. 

"For those of you who are beyond my power to help...I can only pray for you."

She began writing with the fancy black fountain pen she always used. Scratch, scrawl, scratch.

Then she stood. She approached Riley-

Riley took a step back. She was heeding my advice. I hoped she'd run from the room, if required. As long as she doesn't touch her. I was certain that was the key. 

Hangyant changed tactics. "Miss Dorset, you came into my class carrying a book today."

Riley nodded.

"Fiction?"

Riley nodded.

The period chime went off. Class was over. Every student instinctively moved to get out of their seats, to flee. But she growled over the sound of that, a harsh and terrifying: "Sit DOWN. *Nobody moves*."

Then to Riley: "Bring me your book. And then you all may go."

*do it,* I thought. *Just do it, and don't let her touch you*. 

Riley did. She went to her book bag which she'd left on the floor next to her desk and brought out her novel. She brought it to Mrs. Hangyant, who took it. She flipped it and read the back, scowling. But her eyes weren't moving. Perhaps, I realise now, she wasn't reading. Perhaps she was just staring intently. 

I'd forgotten about the iPhone. I'd forgotten she could curse objects. I'd forgotten that no one--NO ONE--gets off scott free from Mrs. Hangyant. 

She handed the book back to her. "It's not for me to judge your reading material. I leave that to God."

Riley took the book from her, careful not to touch Mrs. Hangyant's fingers as she did. 

And we idiots giggled through study hall, thinking she'd gotten away with it. How is it we hadn't figured it out? that that's exactly what she does to you. Make you think you got away with it. It was her genius. Her cruel genius. 

***

The next day Riley wasn't at school. She called my cell just before class started. She could barely speak through her sobs. 

"Riley! Where are you?"

"I'm...I'm in the hospital."

My heart dropped like I'd fallen out of an airplane.

"Riley, no..."

"I'm...I'm..." She sobbed again. All I could do was wait for her to get it out. 

"I can't see, Calvin. I woke up this morning and I thought I'd opened my eyes but it was dark. And then I touched them and they were open already. So...they don't know what's wrong yet. They're running tests. But...no one can tell us if...if..." She broke down again.

What I felt first was boiling rage. I didn't ever think before that 'seeing red' was real, but literally the corners of my vision were a hot bright red, which was closing in. 
 
I took a deep breath, pushed the rage away. It scared me how angry I had gotten so quickly. I'd never felt that before. 

"I'm so sorry, Riley. Just stay calm, if you can. I'm sure it’s temporary."

"You don't know that."

I didn't know what to say.

"She cursed my book, Calvin. She did this to me. And there's nothing anyone can do about it. She just did it because she's a vindictive bitch, and no one can ever stop her, and she'll never get caught."

Fuck that, I thought. Fuck. That. 

***

It was later that day I was coming back from the bathroom, going past her room and saw her diary open on her desk. 

Her most secret thing exposed. Her weak point open to attack. 

I could just take a picture of the page it was on, and show it to someone. I could prove, if nothing else, that she was a hateful person completely unfit to teach. At the very *least* I could do that. And I could do it completely anonymously. 


There was only one line at the top of the page:

*This wickedness I do in the service of the Lord.*



Weird. Creepy. Somewhat incriminating, but not enough. I needed to read what came before this. I needed to turn to the previous page. To do that, of course, I'd have to touch it. 

I probably should not touch it. 

Without thinking I stuck out my finger and put it flat down on the page. As soon as I touched it I shuddered. I imagined I felt a kind of shadow, a kind of darkness fall over me. *This may well be what it feels like to get cursed*, I thought. Or it may just be a case of the willies. It may just all be in my head.

Oh well. What's done is done. I flipped the page back, and I read. 

*...you will agree, Lord, that I did no wrong in this. I only barbed her temptation to partake of the pleasurable lies and sins. She chose to read, and so she chose to sacrifice her ability to read. The sin is not mine, it is hers. And I feel your grace upon me, oh Lord. I feel your favor, and I feel you speaking directly into my heart, and telling me what I have done is right and good.*

I had to stop reading. I was starting to see red again. I snapped a picture of the page. 

Well, I was this deep. I'd already touched it, already cursed. I may as well read more. 

I flipped to the beginning. 

*Here, in this volume, as commanded, I confess my deeds and my sins, so that I may retain the power to enforce God's laws on earth. I submit to this book of evil, which I have gained from a source that should not be named. He in the darkness bid me do evil with the power he bestoweth upon me, and so I shall. But I shall betray him, for I use his evil in the service of the Lord. With fire I shall fight fire. And in doing so, I proudly sacrifice my soul to hell.*

Well, there it is. She sees herself as some kind of holy batman. A dark crusader doing evil for good. And she had power, but apparently she only gets to keep it if she confessed how she uses it here in this book. 

I heard her in the hall. Her footsteps. They were unmistakable. Her quick gait. 

It made me jump. I knocked the book, it fell to the floor, splayed out open, face down. 

Oh shit.

I grabbed the book and flipped it over. A pinch of pages had been bent by the impact with the floor. I smoothed them out as best I could. And I put the book back in it's place...but which page was it open to?

I flipped around, looking for that final page. It shouldn't have been hard to find, it was probably the last page she'd written on.

She was coming. Her footsteps were loud. I couldn't find it. I needed to get out. Did I even have time to get out?

I flipped a random page and dropped it face open on the desk, and ran for the door. 

I screeched to a halt on the hard floor. Her footsteps were too close, only seconds from the door. No way I could escape without her seeing now.  

I ran back into the room. I charged my way towards the closet and as I grabbed the handle I realised it was absolutely the first place she would look if she suspected the culprit who'd touched her book was still in the classroom. Instead, as a flash decision, I darted aside towards the back corner of the room. I slid to my knees behind the desks there. 

Terrible. This was no cover at all. She only had to glance in my direction to see me hiding there behind those desks. The closet would have been better. At least there was a chance she wouldn't look. I looked back at the closet. Do I dare? Is there time?

She came into the room. 

She stood there in the doorway, staring at her desk. Staring at the open diary. I held my breath. I held it aware that the longer I held it, the louder my first gasp of air would be as soon as I allowed myself air again. I continued to hold it anyway.

She shut the door. I heard her muttering to herself, but couldn't make out what she was saying. 

She stopped dead, eyes fixed on the book. She stared, perfectly silent. Listening? She sniffed the air. 

No air in my lungs. The black of unconsciousness was closing in around my vision. With incredible restraint I allowed myself air then only because I absolutely had to. I tried to keep my breaths smooth and silent, but the air came in shaky fits I heard loud in my head. I hoped I wasn't being as loud as I seemed to be.

She stared down at her book. Flipped the pages forward, then back. Thought for a moment. Staring at it.

And then she looked up at the closet. 

But she wasn't really looking at the closet, I realized. With her hand on her open book, she was concentrating. She was ruminating, meditating. Reading from the book through her hand some information that didn't come in words. Information that told her of an intruder. Of a nosy student who'd touched her precious prayer book. 

She closed her eyes in concentration. 

Oh good fuck, was this my chance? Now, while her eyes are closed? Head for the door?

I tensed my muscles, ready to run, watching her eyes. They remained shut.

She started to hum, low.

I went. I went quietly, but quickly. Straight for the door. She'd closed it, but maybe I could get out before she opened her eyes. She'd hear me leave, but maybe I could be gone before she'd see me. 

I was moving down the row, along the wall towards the door, watching her always, her head tilted upwards, her chin in the air and her eyes closed but only the slightest muscle action was needed to lift those lids and then she'd have me. 

At the door. My hand on the handle. I pulled slowly, silently, fearing the click. I wanted to pull as far as I could before the click, then I'd hit it. I'd run. 

Her humming intensified and grew louder. She was approaching a climax. 

DING. the period chime!

I pulled. CLICK. I yanked the door hard open. I slipped out and I ran. 

I heard her growl of anger behind me. I heard her running. 

In the hall the doors of the classrooms burst open, spewing out students. The empty hall was full in an instant. I slipped between them, through them, kept moving, keeping myself low. I pulled my sweater off over my head. Thank God I was wearing one with a shirt underneath. Thank God it was a new sweater, not one I'd ever worn to school before. Into the trash it went. Sorry grandma. 

I was lost among them now. I was free. And she had no way of knowing who I was. 

***

So here I am with this evidence, though I’m not sure now what to do with it. It probably would be easy to get her fired with it, but that won’t solve Riley’s problem. Could even make it worse. I think honestly I’ve got to figure out a way to blackmail her into lifting the curse on Riley. Which is terrifying…but I don’t think I have a choice. In any case, I’ve got to figure out what I’m going to do before she figures out it was me. I’m sure, eventually, she will.

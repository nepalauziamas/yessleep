Hello, my name is 02 (perffered name online).

Description :
I had a very disturbing dream a few nights ago. I was going to write it down but every time I tried to think about it, I got heavily disturbed. It’s been a few weeks and in that time, I was able to explain this dream to a friend of mine who was really into horror and crime. I figured they would be less effected, but they still felt very ill after hearing it. But being able to explain I with company made me feel less anxious about thinking of it. So, I decided now was a good time to write it down. I didn’t want it to go to waste, so I figured it could be appreciated here. I don’t know where else to put it, and as a warning, I am not a very good writer.
I should add, in case anyone is worried about me after reading this, I’ll have you know my friend’s mom had me and my home exercised with sage after I explained the dream. I'm not very spiritual nor religious, but I felt better knowing they felt better. So, if there was any stange, bad omen involved, it has been safely cleansed.
 

I’m going to give another warning to anybody who may read this. This is heavily disturbing, at least to me and my horror obsessed friend.

Story 





to explain the dream well to an audience, I must organize it. It was very jumbled when I saw it, so it would be difficult to replicate that to an outside listener. So, I will explain this dream like a story.
 
Long ago, there was a factory or plant of some kind. If was located deep within a heavily wooded area, far from civilization. In this massive building, experiments took place, mostly involving extra-terrestrial or paranormal projects. Many of these projects centered around a small lake, which the plant was built around, in order to study and contain said lake. The phenomenon of this lake was that anything that went in, never came back out. Though the water was shallow, it was somehow bottomless. However, when living creatures were put into this lake, they could swim back to the surface after disappearing beneath the shallow bottom.
Another study going on throughout the plant was the experimentation of children, being used to find out the secrets of not only the lake, but the other paranormal things in this plant. (Why they used children, I don’t know.)
The kids were mauled by strange creatures, burned with mysterious chemicals, reconfigured by hellish entities, and eaten alive by hungry monsters, only to be sewn, stitched, taped, nailed, and glued back together by the plant’s workers so they could continue to be studied alive. (We are not in the worst parts yet, hang tight.)
These children didn’t look human, they didn’t act human, and they weren’t treated nor seen as human. 30 children were held captive and tortured by these researchers. 30 children faced unimaginable pain at the claws of the unknown, every day of their lives.
Until, one day, the law came. A swat team was sent to raid the plant. An ambush the researchers had a warning about from their outside protection team. Panicking and desperate to save their research, they pushed all they could into the lake.
The books, the cages, the tubes, themselves, all into the shallow, bottomless lake.
The children were sealed into air bags, folded into fitting boxes, nailed down, and thrown in with the rest of the research. Alive the children lay in air bags, trapped in boxes, sinking to the end of a bottomless lake. Their only refuge being the monsters that put them there in the first place.

Several decades go by, and an everchanging world is unrecognizable as what it once was. The age of technology reigns on civilization, as people text, call, create, and share throughout the world.
And among(us) the many, a certain creepypasta surfaces. “When a ‘Bloody Mary’-like chant is recited, a small greenish lake will appear on the closest ground you face. In this lake are 30 children, misconfigured and trapped in boxes, at the bottom of the lake. If you go to the bottom, pull out each child, free their body from the box, and welcome them to your home and family for a day, they will grant you an abundant life of wealth, happiness, and love. “
It sounds nicer than it is. What really happens is much worse than the description.
 
“Recite 30 names in a specific order: a lake will appear. When the lake appears, there is no way to send it back until you complete the ritual: all civilization that did not recite the names with you will vanish.
All technology and books will hold information on the children, and nothing else. Look at your nearest phone, computer, TV, or tablet. There will be important information on each child you must memorize to make them feel known and understood by you: you must read the torture they went through, all the horrors that happened to them, and apologize to them for all they went through.
The lake is deep, but there is no specific order you must bring up the children: the lake is 80 feet deep, and you must swim through wreckage from buildings, planes, chambers, and dead, paranormal entities that float throughout the water.
When you bring up the children, you must free them from the boxes, and not judge them for their appearance: they are corpses. Gooey, gory, misconfigured corpses. They are wrapped in plastic and thick layers of mold and mucus. The liquid will pour onto the floor when opened, and it will reek of death.
When freed, you must treat the children to breakfast, lunch, dinner, snacks, movies, walks, parties, and just general fun times: you must treat each child one at a time, separately. 30 days of meals with these rotten corpses. 30 days without civilization. 30 days, if you complete the ritual.
If you don’t complete the ritual, you won’t leave until you do. You will be stuck there, with the lake. unable to leave, unable to call for help. They will haunt you. Their horrific bodies will follow you, begging you to come back. To help them. To love them. To give them a home. They will not let you sleep. They will not let you leave.
Even if you complete the ritual, if they don’t like you, you won’t get your reward
Most don’t survive to finish the ritual, as they kill themselves before they gain freedom from the lake’s dimension.”

A blogger is live from the dimension. The bodies of unrecognizable “children” following him through the once populated time square. He’s begging, crying if anyone can hear him through the lens.
We can. But nobody can help him.
We watch him face his last hours. We watch his path to insanity. We watch the bodies of gunk, guts, and bone swarm him. Some bodies have multiple appendages. Some have none, and their mucus slurps as they wiggle like giant worms aground him. He’s covered in vomit. He’s covered in blood. He hasn’t even completed a single week of the ritual.
 
These videos are taken down by officials but are constantly resurfacing throughout the web. People recording their foolish attempts to complete the ritual for attention or respect. While their camera footage comes through, their physical presence doesn’t. A haunting realization that our reality overlaps with the lake’s.
 
Headlines are rising worldwide as the lake’s existence becomes a type of norm.
 
PEOPLE THROWING RAVES IN THE LAKE’S DIMESNTION: “Hundreds of people trying to achieve the reward without the traumatic scars will, in unison, transition into the lake’s dimension together. These groups will often include gore enthusiasts, paranormal investigators, and violent gang members. Many of these groups have completed the ritual and made it out. But the children didn’t like them. So, they did not get their reward.”
 
WORLD LEADERS SPEAK UP ABOUT ‘THE CHILDREN OF LAKE’: “Thousands are being lost to this curse. It is time for us as a nation to stand up and do something about it”.
 
THEORIES RISING ABOUT HOW TO STOP THE THREAT OF ‘THE LAKE’ “The problem is not the lack of love these children fear, it’s whatever that lake is or whatever is inside the lake, holding them hostage in the dimension’s purgatory. Once we destroy that, we free the kids, and people stop dying”
 
MASS DECLINE IN MENTAL AND SPIRITUAL STABILITY IN THE PRESENCE OF ‘THE CHILDREN OF THE LAKE’: “The suicide rate is skyrocketing as anxious people fear the possibility of the lake splitting into our own dimension. The mystery of this horrifying phenomenon is wrecking everything in its path”
 
“News outlets and world leaders are commenting on the situation as people lose others to the fascinating horrors of the curse. The world has finally decided to take action A group of 50 thousand highly qualified people will head into the dimension to defeat the lake, free the children, and end the curse.”
 
I am terrified, sitting in my hotel room. I look down at my phone, once bursting with bright distraction and mercy from the pain around me. The lack of any outside information is the cruel reminder of what I’ve gotten myself into. I reread again the screen of this now useless phone.

I dont even know if its a skinwalker, wendigo, or any other one of those paranormal creatures. But it for sure isnt like what Ive heard about. 

For the past 8 years Ive gone to my grandparents during the summer. The past 6 have had some.. questionable... events First time I saw "it" was when I was 7 or 8 almost like it was staring at the house. Their now deceased dog, Flint, was usually the tough type, but in this moment, he looked more scared then id ever seen him. He noticed it first, and when I looked there, all my muscles froze

There it was, hunched down beside a rock. It looked like it would be like 12 feet if it stood tall. Ever seen a hounder from Kane Pixels backrooms? The body was comparable to that. All of its limbs, however, were bent in odd directions, with the head ticking left and right 180Â°. Once it backed into the forest, my senses snapped back and I screamed the most blood curdling I ever have.

My brother ran outside, worryingly asking me whats wrong. I couldnt speak, I just cried, cried and hyperventilated. Eventually I pointed to the forest. My brother, obviously worried and scared, asked things like "Is there something in the forest?" with me nodding. We eventually went back inside, and I immediately went to draw a depiction of what I saw. 

Of course it wasnt the best drawing, but it got what i saw down. A disfigured body, oddly bending limbs, and the head twisted down to the neck. My brother seemed to kind of know what it was, or just a concept of it, and we showed it to grandpa. Of course grandma was worried too (It was just grandpa, grandma, my brother and I this summer) but she didnt seem to know much about it.

Grandpa though, seemed like he had encountered it multiple times. That night was the most secure night it has been since ive been there. When i tried to sleep, i heard it, a low, curdling screech. It seemed closer to my foom, and when i bolted up, it ran away. Thats all i remember from that summer. 

The next encounter happened when I was around 10.This time it was closer, and wasnt as bent down. Clearly it was sone sort of demon, but I doubt even hell would have anything like that. This time my dad was also with us, but grandma and grandpa went to a town about an hour away to buy groceries and gifts, as my moms birthday was coming up.

Believe it or not, my dad, I dont know how, but i believe him, can speak to god. He can heal people, do things like dodging thrown knives, and much more Hes been with christ ever since he was about my age (15). Not even he, however, knew much about it. All he knows is that theres no way it should be here, almost like it has been. Its not like any skinwalker, or wendigo. Back onto the main story, my dad had started a prayer, and the creature started reacting horridly

It let out a huge screech as its body acted against itself, and particles, I dont even know what theyd been, started going in and out of it. It was like it was even rejecting the heavens itself, not allowing it to die. It ran to my dad, but the closer he got the mire his body acted out, and it eventually ran away.

I havent seen much of it lately, just it lurking in the forest, but I know that one day, something bad with it will happen. Ill update if anything happens during this summer break with an edit to this post. I apologize if this doesnt provide much context, and it may seem fake, but please believe me. Not many people do, but my brother and I know damn well what we saw

I will also be replying to comments with questions when I can

My name is Quinten Frain and lately.

 I got a job helping out at the local Library. The job started two weeks ago and has been going well so far the librarian who hired me is such a sweet heart like imagine the sweetest old lady your mind can think of times ten that's her. Anyway my job mostly consist of sorting books, and helping visitors. However today I was told to clean the basement because the custodian James was sick today. I had no problem with doing it so there I was in a dusty old basement with a single window and an equally as dirty mop.     

Things were going great then. I tripped over an exposed piece of wire crashing into the wall I heard a crack as I got up to examine the damage. There was a large crack in the wall I was about to go tell the librarian Miss Jonah. But as I was grabbing my equipment I noticed a glimmer coming from the wall examining the wall further there was a small metal door. I tried to open it but likewise it was locked so I gave up going upstairs and putting the equipment back in it's closet I went to Miss Jonah and told her about the damage. "Miss Jonah sorry I accidentally fell while cleaning down there and damaged the wall." Miss Jonah just looked at me warmly and said. "Sugar it's ok it's just a storage room no one is actually going down there how's about you clock out early today it's been a slow day have a good day Sugar." I was surprised with the offer but I didn't hesitate. And went to clock out but the urge to know what was behind that door was nagging at me non stop. So when I clocked out I decided to stay in the building.

The reason I did this was because I know James has a set for picking locks I can get that and open the door get a quick peek in and leave. So I walked into the custodian closet and grabbed the neatly packed lock picks and went back down into the basement. Staring at the door I had about no idea how to pick a lock. But I gave it a good try I jammed the picks in there shimmying them around and seemingly getting nowhere. I was about to just go home but I decided to give it one more try. After some more shimmying around I heard a faint click I tried the handle and it opened so I left it cracked open and went back up to put the tools back. I was almost there but then I got a tap on my shoulder I turned around to see James as he looked quite confused as he said. "Why do you have my tools Quintin?" I stammered a bit but then I got a grip and lied saying. "I had to open the abandoned computer lab to grab a spare keyboard sorry."

James is quite gullible so he believed me and took the tools back that was close too close. So as soon as James was gone I went back to the basement the door was still cracked open, so I headed in keeping a brick in the door so it doesn't lock me in. It was very dark in there so I grabbed my phone out and turned on the flashlight. Looking around the tunnel was narrow and seemed to go on forever so I began walking. Time flew by as I realized that it was 5:34 P.M the Library would be closing soon enough so I left and went home and made a plan of how to explore that tunnel. I would use one of my vacation days and go to the library to return a book and then go to the basement with some equipment so before I went to bed I packed a flashlight, food, portable charger, and water. Then I went to bed setting my alarm for 7:00 A.M. 

My plan went great as I entered the tunnel once again walking for ages taking occasional breaks. Eventually I saw a light at the end of the tunnel I kept walking making it to another door. It had a valve as a handle and there was a sign on the door it read. "Warning do not open without administrative permission. I should have heeded the warning but the curiosity was beckoning me to continue. So I did turning the valve I heard the rusted metal open as the door slowly opened looking inside. I could only describe a urban explorers wet dream it looked like a lab an abandoned one. It was just as dark as the tunnel I was excited so I started exploring. I could see all around smashed glass, scattered papers, and furniture. All thrown around as I turned into a long hallway I shined my flashlight ahead and my heart dropped. I saw a decomposed body it was ripped in half and mauled into a barely recognizable form. It was truly horrific I held the urge to vomit as my curiosity fueled adventure was put to an halt. I was about to turn back and never come back again but then I heard something.

Footsteps and then I heard a voice a very distressed one at that it said. "Hello is anyone there? Please I just want to get out of here." I started walking to the voice as I turned the corner to meet the person I heard I saw it. 8 Feet tall no eyes a gaping mouth razor sharp claws exposed ribs. I stepped back in shock tripping over a filing cabinet and making a loud bang. Before I had time to realize what was going on I heard a loud roar. looking behind me I saw the thing heading straight at me. I panicked and ran, it started to chase me my blood was pumping like I never felt before. As I bolted it for the exit while I was running I heard the thing's panting as it rushed towards me. I made it to the door slamming it closed and turning the valve before I heard a loud thud the thing was throwing itself at the door luckily it held and soon enough the creature lost interest. I took a minute to gather what just happened.

I went back as I got to basement I realized it was after closing times so I closed the door in the basement and climbed out the window. Walking home I thought about what I had seen hoping to forget the whole experience, I went to sleep the next day deciding to write about my experience here. but even now I can't stop thinking about the thing but for right now I need a breather until net time

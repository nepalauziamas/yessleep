And I don’t mean the generic matter of buying the new shoes on the market, or the new phone everyone around you seems to be acquiring at rapid speeds. That was me, at first, I had come from a middle-class upbringing with just enough cash on the sides to treat myself every once in awhile. Not enough to brag about, but enough to live comfortably.

With Semi-Absent parents and a bundle of siblings (me being the oldest), I had gained a useful set of skills that helped me live independently. It was a piece of cake, and I had been the best I had ever been, until my Sophomore year of college. 

Before then, I had assumed that with my Freshman year out of the way, my Sophomore year would be a breeze. This was supposed to be the easy part. I was now supposed to be living life fluently, having learned how to manage personal-needs and financial the year before.

But then I got fired. My Job had been keeping me afloat, more money than the average broke Student, and it was what I relied on to keep me stable. The reasoning was them not being able to support as many employees anymore, leaving me to fall victim to the cut in staff.

Life tumbled quickly downhill after that. Bills started to stack up on my cheap, wooden two-seat dining table and deep-set eye bags accumulated under my eyes. My grades slipped under from how hard I had been working at finding a new source of income, and every-time I blinked I could feel my mind stumble deeper and deeper into fatigue.


3 months of this, and my rent could no longer be payed. I resorted to the lowest of the low, succumb myself into one of those pyramid schemes and gain benefit off the cost of others. It had seemed feasible at the time, what’s with them losing a couple bucks compared to me losing my life? My job was simple, and it came with only 3 rules.

Sell this new product, new to the market and claims to enhance your mind and body, increase agility, be more alert, the whole nine yards. Seems legit, and with the 3 rules being easy to understand and follow as well, I was heading towards success in my eyes.

Rule 1, Sell the product with a smile on your face. Never once let it slip. ‘They’ll trust you more if you seem chipper!’ I was told. Easy enough, I practiced my easygoing smile in the mirror until my cheeks ached, but the curl to my lips was perfected. The crinkle to my eyes so subtle yet noticeable, enough so it seemed genuine. I topped the charts in a week.

Rule 2, Claim you take the pills too. Claim they work. Whatever you do, insist the effects have made your life a hell-of a lot easier. The Customers latch onto any form of living proof they can see, and if the bright smile on your face doesn’t speak volumes your words certainly will. This one was a bit trickier, as I hadn’t ever let myself get comfortable with lying before, but the more I did so the more the words spewed out like honey. I could get over the bitter aftertaste of regret once I was bathing in a tub full of cash’.

Rule 3, and I was told this one with a voice full of warning, Never swallow the pill. Not once do you even consider taking the product we sell, nor let it slip down your throat. There was no context needed, with how ghostly pale her face got as she told me this.

Weeks pass, and with every paycheck that made its way into my hands I could see a bigger, brighter future. Past all this, I could envision me living a life of luxury. Gone from scrambling to reach ends meet to wearing designer shoes.

When you think of the World’s debates, the ones no one can ever decide on, always leaving a result of 50/50, “Can Money buy Happiness?” Is one of the first to make its way into your head. Before, my answer had always been a solid, clear ‘No.’ But, I was beginning to see things in a new light.

Necessary to keep my job, was a task to keep in touch with the consumers. Every 6 weeks I would call, make small talk, pester them with question after question of the medications effects.

Going into these calls, I had readied myself to convince them that the product actually does work. That it is making them happier. That they just don’t see it yet. The shock I felt after seeing such a pattern, a pattern of cheerful affirmations of the medicines success, was cold and filled me from head-to-toe.

But with each and every call, the brewing curiosity in my stomach rumbled. Can Money truly ‘Buy Happiness’? 

The rules were quickly left forgotten, and I found myself swallowing one. Just a tiny, red-and-white capsule. I felt it rush down my throat along with the lukewarm water I chased it down with. And I felt it. A weight in my stomach, so intense I felt my knees buckle, a captivating feeling. As if my brain was no longer my own.

But with the feeling of being a stranger in my own mind, came a warmth and comfort settled in my stomach. Life was brighter, work was no longer a chore, the bags under my eyes reduced to nothing.

An epiphany occurred, then. That Money can Buy Happiness, and that it bought mine.

The more I gained money, the more it piled up in my bank account, the more I felt something I’d never felt before. Like how I wasn’t there, yet the feeling of euphoria pushed me forward. I took the pill 3 times a day, as the bottle recommends, and I quickly found myself clutching onto it as if it was my lifeline.

The question of if the product works was no longer a question, but an answer. It does work. And when asked I would respond in cheerful affirmations, of how it works almost too well, of how I don’t feel alone anymore.

Google would tell you that the pill has a way of rewiring your brain. Commanding it to follow the orders of the pill, recite the value of it, recommend it to all your friends. To take over you until you’re no longer ‘you’ anymore.

But you should know to never trust the internet, and I’m here to tell you personally on how it’s improved me. I find myself encompassed in the warmth of it, and my body has never felt so youthful.

Some say money can make you ‘desperately greedy’ but it’s all coming from the jealousy brewing in their brains. Money can buy you happiness, and take it from me, my bright smile and honey-coated words, that it bought mine. And it can buy yours too, for a price.

Rules? What Rules? Whatever, I’ll call you back in 6 weeks to see how the effects are kicking in. Take it 3 times a day.

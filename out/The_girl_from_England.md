Life at Elmont high was what you would typically think of a highschool life to be like. Sports, exams, highschool romances, all the clich√©s you know? I was always in the background, not popular but not necessarily disliked. I arrived at school on the first day after vacation had finished to be met by my friend, Jarryd. He was rather tall and lanky , also, just like me, more of a background character. "Hey man, have you seen the new girl, she is absolutely insanely hot. I heard she transferred here from England." Jarryd stated as he ran his hand through his thick black hair. "No, only just got here. Hey did you do your summer reading of that book-" we were suddenly interrupted by the blaring sound of the school bell indicating that we needed to go to class. 

The bustling halls of Elmont made it somewhat difficult to navigate around the school, but i found the English class with relative ease despite being slightly late. "Late again Mr Penson. Take your seat." Greeted my English teacher, Mrs Logans. As i looked over all the familiar faces of the class, i noticed one that immediately caught my attention. Long blonde hair, icy blue eyes, and teeth as white as wool as she smiled the most beautiful smile i'd ever seen. I took my seat which coincidentally, was right next to her. As i was zoning out thinking about the girls smile, a familiar, blaring sound interrupted my thoughts. It was the school bell, and it indicated the end of the math lesson as well as the end of the school day. As i was making my way out of the school doors, someone put their hand on my shoulder, and i heard the voice of a girl. "Hey there, my name is Angie. I'm new here, and your face looked particularly welcoming." She said to me in her British accent. "Oh umm hey, m- my name is Shayne, Shayne Penson. You move here from England?" I replied to her slightly stuttering. "Yep, moved here a couple weeks back. Would you want to go get a meal somewhere around here, I'm absolutely starving." She said to me, with longing in those deep blue eyes of hers. 

We left school and i took her to a small local restaurant, we ate and spoke and shared stories with each other and got along really well. I offered to walk her home,but she insisted on walking me home. As i opened the door, i was greeted by an all to familiar face, it was the face of my little sister. Her long brown, curly hair in a messy bun. Her grassy green eyes staring at me. My sister was always my best friend, we had gotten along ever since we were much younger.She ran and gave me a hug as she always would and i introduced her to Angie. "This is my little sister, Abby. Abby this is Angie, my new friend." "Its very nice to meet you Abby, ill see you tomorrow Shayne." Angie said as she hugged me goodbye. She walked down the driveway, her blonde hair glowing in the afternoon sun as she turned around one last time and gave me a smile, that captivating, hypnotic smile of hers. 

One thing led to another and after a few months of me and Angie being close, i eventually asked her out. She agreed and i was dating the prettiest girl in the school. One afternoon, we were sitting at the same restaurant that we went the day we met. "Hey um, could you maybe help me do my science task this weekend. Im not sure how to do it." She asked staring at me with puppy dog eyes.  "Unfortunately, i promised to help my sister study." I replied to her. Her beautiful hypnotic smile, started to fade away. " You always put your sister first, it pisses me off! This relationship will never work if you can't make me your priority." I had never seen her like this. She was furious. She got up and left the restaurant. I decided to leave her and let her cool off. It wasnt my fault, she was being unreasonable. The days went by and i hadn't once seen her at school for the rest of that week. I decided to visit her house that Friday and see if she was okay, but her parents answered and told me to leave.

Saturday morning i woke up and immediately set out to help my sister study. The thought of Angie constantly playing in my head. I us to go back to normal but i was still upset for the way she treated me. "What is the mitochondria?" I asked my sister as she stared at me. "Ummmmmm i dont know?". She replied with those innocent eyes. "Come on, i just taught you this!" I replied with frustration. " Maybe i just need a break, im going to go downstairs and get some soda, you want something?" She asked me . " Ill take some Coke." I replied to her. She skipped her way downstairs as i sat there. I suddenly heard the most blood curdling scream. I ran downstairs to see the most horrific sight. The white floors laced with crimson, spatter on the walls and a gurgling sound filled the air. I saw her blade glimmering in the sunlight, as she stood over the dead corpse of my sister. She approached me with the same hypnotic smile, this time however it was now malicious and evil. " Now you can focus more on me."

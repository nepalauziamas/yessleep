Life at Elmont high was what you would typically think of a highschool life to be like. Sports, exams, highschool romances, all the clich√©s you know? I was always in the background, not popular but not necessarily disliked. I arrived at school on the first day after vacation had finished to be met by my friend, Shayne. He was rather tall and lanky , also, just like me, more of a background character. "Hey man, have you seen the new girl, she is absolutely insanely hot. I heard she transferred here from England." Shayne stated as he ran his hand through his thick black hair. "No, only just got here. Hey did you do your summer reading of that book-" we were suddenly interrupted by the blaring sound of the school bell indicating that we needed to go to class. 

The bustling halls of Elmont made it somewhat difficult to navigate around the school, but i found the English class with relative ease despite being slightly late. "Late again Mr Penson. Take your seat." Greeted my English teacher, Mrs Logans. As i looked over all the familiar faces of the class, i noticed one that immediately caught my attention. Long blonde hair, icy blue eyes, and teeth as white as wool as she smiled the most beautiful smile i'd ever seen. I took my seat which coincidentally, was right next to her. As i was zoning out thinking about the girls smile, a familiar, blaring sound interrupted my thoughts. It was the school bell, and it indicated the end of the math lesson as well as the end of the school day. As i was making my way out of the school doors, someone put their hand on my shoulder, and i heard the voice of a girl. "Hey there, my name is Angie. I'm new here, and your face looked particularly welcoming." She said to me in her British accent. "Oh umm hey, m- my name is Jean, Jean Penson. You move here from England?" I replied to her slightly stuttering. "Yep, moved here a couple weeks back. Would you want to go get a meal somewhere around here, I'm absolutely starving." She said to me, with longing in those deep blue eyes of hers. 

We left school and i took her to a small local restaurant, we ate and spoke and shared stories with each other and got along really well. I offered to walk her home,but she insisted on walking me home. As i opened the door, i was greeted by an all to familiar face, it was the face of my little sister. Her long brown, curly hair in a messy bun. Her grassy green eyes staring at me. My sister was always my best friend, we had gotten along ever since we were much younger.She ran and gave me a hug as she always would and i introduced her to Angie. "This is my little sister, Abby. Abby this is Angie, my new friend." "Its very nice to meet you Abby, ill see you tomorrow Shayne." Angie said as she hugged me goodbye. She walked down the driveway, her blonde hair glowing in the afternoon sun as she turned around one last time and gave me a smile, that captivating, hypnotic smile of hers. 

One thing led to another and after a few months of me and Angie being close, i eventually asked her out. She agreed and i was dating the prettiest girl in the school. One afternoon, we were sitting at the same restaurant that we went the day we met. "Hey um, could you maybe help me do my science task this weekend. Im not sure how to do it." She asked staring at me with puppy dog eyes.  "Unfortunately, i promised to teach my sister to drive." I replied to her. Her beautiful hypnotic smile, started to fade away. " Uh, its okay, i can ask Shayne to help, its all good." I could tell she was upset,  " Sorry Angie, i really need to do this for her though." I said comfortingly to her. " I need to get going, my parents are expecting me home." I could tell that she was upset and hurt.

The weekend came and went and i taught my sister all i knew. She was pretty bad at driving and she once again made me promise to her that i would help her practice again the following weekend. I knew Angie would be upset, but she needed to understand how important this was to Abby. The next day at school, a beautiful face once again approached me. " Part at Luke Halligan's house , this weekend. Your coming." She said sternly. " Uhhh, i am going to help Abb-"
" You always put your sister first, it pisses me off! This relationship will never work if you can't make me your priority." I had never seen her like this. She was furious. She stormed off furiously and left the school. I ran after her but she just disappeared.  I decided to leave her and let her cool off. It wasnt my fault, she was being unreasonable. The days went by and i hadn't once seen her at school for the rest of that week. I decided to visit her house that Friday and see if she was okay, this was actually the first time id been to her house. Her Dad answered, "Hello sir , im Shayne , Angie's boyfriend. Did she perhaps come home this afternoon?" I asked politely. "Listen boy , never come back here , and if you know whats good for you, never ever talk to Angie again!" He slammed the door shut and before he did, i noticed a photo on the wall. It was of Angie, her mother, her father and .. a boy, a young boy. A brother perhaps? 

Saturday morning i woke up and immediately started the car as Abby climed in. We drove to a more remote place and she took the wheel. The thought of Angie was constantly playing in my head. who was the boy? I wanted us to go back to normal but i was still upset for the way she treated me." After driving the entire day, i was exhausted and my sister , made me dinner to thank me for teaching her to drive. Later into the evening, she came up to my room to bring the food. "Thanks for teaching me to drive today Jean. It really means alot." " No problem, atleast you didn't scratch my car" I replied to her. " Im not that bad" she laughed as she skipped her way downstairs. Many hours passed and in the early hours of the night. I suddenly heard the most blood curdling scream. I ran downstairs to see the most horrific sight. The white floors laced with crimson, spatter on the walls and a gurgling sound filled the air. I saw her blade glimmering in the moonlight, as she stood over the dead corpse of my sister. She approached me with the same hypnotic smile, this time however it was now malicious and evil. " No one takes me seriously , no one loves me. Someone always steals all the love , first my brother and now your sister. Now you can love me and only me ."

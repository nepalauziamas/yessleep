   S.H.E is a worldwide program approved in early 2017 and operative since March 2021. When I say worldwide, I mean that only a few rich folks and scientists, such as myself, know about it. No sane person will put humanity through such horrors.

S.H.E stands for Special Human Experiments, and we offer solutions to problems humanity doesn't want to fix. 

We want to make the world a better place, and nothing can stop us.

*After all, what can you do?*

We have technology and power you never even have dreamt of. We are the future of this planet. Whoever does not agree, well...The system will take care of you.

Allow me to give you some information about the experiments, so you develop some vague perspective of where humanity will be in the next few years. 

   **Starting with my personal favorite - "The plastic eaters".** 

The name speaks for itself. 

We plan on modifying as many humans as possible to eat and process plastic waste. With this enhancement, the selected individuals will not require human food. They will only need to sleep once in a while and go to the bathroom. 

Now you will ask, but what about robots?

   Humans are better than robots, as they have complicated brains. They don't just mindlessly follow commands and are capable of much more than a machine.

   Before you judge, we took precautions. When we sell you a plastic eater or another experiment, it comes with rules. They vary depending on which one you buy. There is one reoccurring rule in every one of them. 

If you break it, it will lead to nasty consequences. 

**You are not allowed to abuse your experiment.** 

There is going to be an indicator that tells us what you do and what they do, so you can't get sneaky *(watching at you creeps)*

Also, they will be allowed to fight back, so *don't get any ideas*.

   We do have a plan to place our experiments in public venues. Although, this will require a lot of paperwork. Maybe in the future, when we see how it goes. Our major concern is that people will treat the experiments like garbage. *(looking at you customer service)* 

Another thing is how our experiments look. The modifications ruined most of our patients' physical appearances, which may be unsettling and cause riots. 

Something our circle isn't very **fond of**.

With our rules of repercussions, humanity may cease to exist. 

   I forgot to add that most experiments are already active. And for now, we have a ton of volunteers, which are people who do not have the will to live or desire money to feed their families...  

  The next experiment is the judgers. They are specifically designed to know which person is good and which is bad; how people feel, and what they think at all times. Honestly, they are the easiest to modify. We only need to enhance their intuition and switch some processes in their brains.

They are excellent for personal use, as you will never be lied to again, and you will know what the person next to you feels.

The judgers are such communicator improvers. The downside is that unidentified forces are trying to get them out of the state we put them in, so you as a customer will have to deal with spiritual attacks and give your experiment injection twice a day.

   **Experiment number three is F.R.P or "Free Range Prisoners".** 

Whoever went to prison for whatever reason is already our property, and they will be experimented on without their consent. The benefits of this experiment are crime reduction, fewer prisons, and more modified humans working together to save the world.

Our circle has much more ideas, but sadly I cannot share them with all of you. 

Not yet.

In the last message, I will share with you a little *secret*. 

If you do not want to be an experiment, help the world become a better place. 

Be the change you want to see, as they say.

If not, we will meet soon.

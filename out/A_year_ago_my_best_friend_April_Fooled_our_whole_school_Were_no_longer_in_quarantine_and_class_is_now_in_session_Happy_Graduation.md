Blackwood Academy is no more.

Though I fear for you now.

[I fear that a new update looms—and humanity as a whole is a ticking time bomb.](https://www.reddit.com/user/Trash_Tia/comments/v5njf0/blackwood_academy_series_posts/) 

I will say our story does not end in this post. At the end I’ll be posting a link to my page where you can read everything. I hit a word count but I don’t want to split this into any more parts.

“What if I gave you what you wanted?”

What did I really want? I thought.

Peace?

Or did I want to plunge further into the pain?

The virus was burying itself further and further inside me, finding memories pushed far back.

Ones I didn’t even know existed.

The white room bled into our local diner. 

I was thirteen years old and it was the last day of Summer. Rory was still relatively normal despite being groomed to be a psychopath, and it was the first time we had officially penned ourselves The Jasper and Rory Defence Squad--just in case Mycroft took her away. Connor and Joey were arguing over something trivial, their heads just a little too close-- Rory, leaning against the window with her brow raised watching the whole show, Luna, her arms around me with her usual grin, and across the table, Jasper, looking tired and worn out, dunking his fries in his shake with his chin resting on his fist.

I caught his awkward glances. 

Too fast for me to register, but I was too busy staring at Connor, at his new haircut, the beanie that was a little too big, sitting over thick strands of dark hair. He’d looked good. 

Connor had been through an unexpected growth spurt and I was completely smitten.

Jasper caught my eye. I could tell by his smile that he knew--and I was making it pretty obvious.

He mouthed something, and whatever it was made me laugh. 

Enough for Luna to nudge me.

“A singular moment,” Luna’s voice murmured in my head.

“One of your most precious memories you kept hidden. “How about that, huh? Memories are wonderful things are they not? The ability to capture one moment and keep it with you for the rest of your life.” She hummed.

“You can stay here, Mara. You don’t have to think about all the bad things when you can stay here. Your own personal fairy-tale, huh. Without killing kitties and evil scientists.”

My own personal fairy-tale.

I thought I could do that.

I could stay in that moment before everything was twisted out of shape.

I did stay, at least for a while, sitting in an endless loop which made me happy. Real happiness. For the first time in so long I felt real happiness and I wasn’t hurting. Except it didn’t last for long. I don’t know if it was Luna’s influence, or my own thoughts taking over and reminding me things turned sour.

I was seeing the days and then weeks and months after. Rory became more withdrawn until she disappeared from her seat. The sun rose and fell and months fell into each other.

I watched fall leaves dance in a spiralling breeze and asper stopped smiling, his eyes becoming more hollow, his smiles twisting into scowls, before his head hit the table and he slept through most of our meetings. Snow fell outside and I nursed a hot cocoa while Joey and Connor argued with Luna about going out of town and telling someone. I kept glancing at Jasper’s empty seat. It hadn’t been filled in a while and the more I looked at it, the sicker I felt.

I didn’t want that. I didn’t want to revisit how I’d felt and what I’d had to put up with; the feeling of uneasiness and dread eating me up—missing memories and a constant feeling of being watched. The image in my mind splintered into pieces and I lunged from it.

But I was still stuck. The virus had its claws into me and it wasn’t letting go.

It took me drinking in the bad thoughts and memories, the ones that I had pushed back, for me to realise I couldn’t do that anymore. If Luna was using them against me, if she was forcing me to relive them and plunging me into my own bitter pain and guilt, I had to face them. 

So, I did. I threw myself inside everything I had done. Killing Marmalade, and then my mother—Alexa Blake and hundreds of other kids during the year under the virus’s influence. My psychotic laughter as I forced a girl from the roof edge and stamped on a kid’s head until the bottom of my shoe dripped brain matter. Instead of letting those memories break me and pushing them away, I took them in, drinking in every angle.

I know that to be  human, we don’t quite accept pain. But we don’t let it rule us. We come to terms with it. And over time, it starts to hurt a little less. Weeks could go by, months, years— decades. It still exists and those we lost still hurt. But we replace the bad with the good ones.  In the end I still had memories of my mother. I knew it wasn’t my fault. I had been brainwashed at the age of fourteen, and that influence had killed my mother—that influence had done nothing to save Luna from Mycroft.

I could accept both sides of me.

The virus’ influence, what had turned me into a monster who craved my own agony and suffering.

And splintered pieces of my human side who desperately fought to cling on.

I won’t say I broke from the virus’ control just like that. It happened slowly, like I was coming up for air and taking my time before I reached the surface. Within that time I found Jasper’s mind in our combined hive of thoughts still teetering on fully combining as one. I found the memory which had killed him and I brought it to the forefront of his mind. When Jasper snapped, his tipping point was killing Luna. Rory had bled into his head and forced him to revel in the memory. Enjoy it. She played it over and over again in his mind, an endless, relentless hell which drove him mad. When his younger voice started to cry out in our heads, I felt something snap, something sever, inside of him. 

Next to me I sensed him hit the ground. I opened my eyes to find him writhing on the floor, trembling hands pulling at the tendrils in his head. “Never forgive me,” He whispered. “No, no, never forgive me. Never forgive me, never forgive me,” His words weren’t just coming from his mouth, Joey and Connor, the Spindle subjects echoing Jasper’s mantra. “Never forgive me… no, never. Never. Never. Never!”

When Joey fell to his knees, followed by Connor, the last vine slipped from my skull.

I was free—and I was immediately crawling over to Jasper.

I glimpsed Luna in front of me. She was still smiling. “The King and Queen have fallen,” she said with a laugh. “I mean, sure, I should be angry. But how can I not be gleeful that I’ve been brought to my knees by humanity itself?”

Ignoring her, I grabbed Jasper’s quaking body and pulled him onto my lap.  “Jasper. Listen to me.”

He didn’t stop crying, sobbing, muttering the same words, his eyes flickering.

"Jasper. Hey!” The words were choking from my throat and tears falling-- but I felt human. I had never felt more human, cradling him to my chest and forcing the words I should have said when I was fourteen and broke him. "It’s okay. You’re okay. It wasn’t your fault. Stop torturing yourself. You’re okay. You’re okay. You’re okay.” I kept saying those words, running my fingers through his hair like my mother used to when I was a child. When I was sick or upset, mom always stroked my hair and spoke to be a soft voice, like she was lulling me to sleep. It felt like that with Jasper. “It wasn’t your fault.”

I choked out the words until my heart was heavy.

I wouldn’t let despair take me. I wouldn’t let my brain revel in my own pain, my own suffering. I chose to hold the boy and let myself break along with him. He didn’t stop screaming, sobbing, rattling, like a hysterical child and I was starting to understand that everyone and everything had an end. My mother had met her end at my hand. Not her time, but it was her fate. It was written in the stars, or whatever bullshit people tell themselves to feel better.

I had to see that with Jasper, even if the thought of losing made me feel like I was losing mom all over again. The update had wrangled his body, entangling itself around his mind, leaving him a shell with no soul—just a meat puppet severed from its strings forced to remember that moment until someone put him out of his misery. His body flailed, his lips uttering those same words, and they never stopped, never faltered. I pulled the last tendrils out of his head once again. I know it wouldn’t make a difference. I’d lost him weeks ago in that room when Rory took his humanity. 

I could accept that… finally. 

It was going to both hurt and give me intense pleasure from the twisted side of me, but it was better than clinging onto a memory which wasn’t coming back.  I let go of mom.

I could let go of Jasper.

Slowly, I pulled my hands from his hair and gently lifted his head from my knee, letting him slide from my arms. Luna was kneeling next to me. There was a frown on her face. Not quite angry, but wary. “Why?” She murmured, moving closer to me. I could sense her but not feel her, only tangled vines pricking the back of my neck. “Why throw all this away— the chance to be with them again?”

She inclined her head, her frown growing sympathetic like she actually cared. “I can give you him,” Luna said. “Connor. I can’t quite give you what you want. Connor’s heart has always been with a certain someone, and you know that. But I can be close,” Her tone grew sing-song but all I could see in the blur of my vision was Jasper. All I could see was him rolling around like a child, tied to that memory forever.

Agony. It must be agony for him, which in his messed up brain equalled indescribable pleasure. I didn’t know which was worse. “Think about it. Placing you in a memory. Just you and him, Mara.” Luna chuckled. “Come on, isn’t that like every childhood fantasy you’ve ever had?”

It was hard to ignore her words because she was inside my head, leeching onto my past and present, my hopes and dreams. Stupid childhood shit. Instead of entertaining Luna’s words, I strode over to the computer tower where Rory’s memory drive was still plugged into the USB port. It was so simple, I thought.

Pulling it out. If only I could have done that weeks ago—if only Jasper and I were actually successful when we were captured, and we managed to save everyone. That didn’t happen though. Jasper was given his very own personal lobotomy, where the virus itself had quite literally forced him to feel pleasure when thinking about something so painful, so agonising, by stimulating the pleasure and pain receptors in his brain. At least—that’s what I remembered what the people in the outside world had told me. It didn’t matter, I thought, yanking out Rory’s memory drive. 

To my surprise, it slid out with no problem. At the corner of my eye, Jasper was still curled up, mumbling to himself. He was dead. I had to get that through my had. “Really?” Luna appeared in front of me when I was stepping over the bodies of the Spindle subjects. I couldn’t say they were really alive, because they were like Jasper. But it still killed me that I was leaving them behind. I had to hold onto that feeling and not let it go. I was hurting—and it was real pain, real despair, that I was leaving my friends behind.

“So, what, you’re just going to leave?” Luna folded her arms and laughed.

“Ha! What happened to friends forever?”

“I’m not leaving them.” I said through gritted teeth. “I’m getting help.”

“Help?” Luna scoffed. “Oh, you mean the help you’ve been getting this past year? Wow, they’ve helped us so much. Jasper Mycroft was crying into the void for eight months and might have been saved if they actually gave a damn,” She was inside my head, because these were my thoughts, just replicated and dramatised.

It was exactly how I felt. I couldn’t trust the same people who had put us here, but what choice did I have? Jasper was gone. If his father was the only one who could bring him back, and that was a big if, then I was going to take that chance. Even if I was setting myself up for failure. “Come on, Mara.” Luna said. “You know it and I know it. Blackwood is our home. We can’t leave here, and you know that.

They’re going to blow us to pieces, so let's stay and enjoy the fireworks. Can you imagine how good it would feel? The anticipation of being ripped apart by an explosion? Sitting there and waiting—waiting and knowing there’s no escape. It’ll be fast, but I can make it slow. I can make you feel all of it, Mara.” Luna was so close. “Your skin being ripped from your bones, your hair catching alight, your whole body dancing in flames and twirling in smoke and debris. And the best part? If you don’t die, you’ll either asphyxiate from inhaling all that smoke or slowly be crushed to death!”

“You’re not her.” I gritted out, ignoring Luna’s grin. “Why are you still wearing her face?”

The virus shrugged. “Well, after doing a deep dive of your brain, you miss her. And who would I be if I didn’t let you see your poor dead friend?”

Gritting my teeth, I refused to let her words penetrate me.

“You’re not Luna.” I hissed out.

“Oh, I’m not?” Her eyes darkened. “Then who am I, Mara?”

Luna’s eyes flicked to Rory’s memory drive, her lip quirking. “If you want to kill me, all of me—  you kill all of them,” She gestured to the others. “I’m alive inside all of you. Why do you think you can see me? Are you going to kill yourself to truly get rid of me?”

Before I could answer, Luna stepped in front of me.

“They’re going to blow us up.” She said in a sing-song voice. “Like, kaboom! With fire and stuff!”

“I know.”

“So? What are you going to do about it? Save yourself, sure, happy ending, right? But is it really a happy ending with me still inside you?” Luna danced around me, her hair a halo flying behind her. “You saw what I’ve done to Blackwood—to all your friends. Imagine if I slipped into the real world. Harvey Mycroft created me as a prototype to completely change the way someone thinks; to twist any normal brain into an incomprehensible mess of knots and tangles with only one thought ruling: The urge to hurt, to feel pain and hopelessness.”

She held up her finger. “See, that’s where we’re at a crossroads. I was born from Aurora Michelson’s mind, the way she thought. I was born from all the experiments Jasper Mycroft’s father did to her poor head. However, I am still a virus. I still need to spread, and even if my foundations are on transforming pain to pleasure, I still want to survive.”

Luna, or the virus, cocked her head, “So, what are you going to do? Are you going to kill me, kill all of us, and give me what I want—or at least what Mycroft programmed into me, or are you going to help me get into the wider population? It’s a pretty cool thought, right? A whole world ruled by pain.”

I pushed past her, heading for the door.

She didn’t follow me.

“Why aren’t you stopping me?” I said, my trembling hand on the doorknob.

Luna didn’t reply for a moment.

“Hm?”

“You’re not stopping me.” I said, sputtering out a laugh. “You’re standing there and you’re not—you’re not plunging yourself into my head or forcing me to feel agony. You’re not playing with Jasper.”

“I’m bored of Jasper,” Luna sighed, “He was exciting to me at first; a boy who was mysteriously immune to my control who ended up being the son of my creator. But then, urgh, he got boring. He followed me like a sheep, like everyone else, became my little dancing puppet willing to do anything.”

Her words were like poison, slicing through me.

“So you’re done?” I whispered.

Luna folded her arms, her movements slow, her smile curving.

“Do you want me to stop you? Like I said, watching you bring me to my knees has filled me with the greatest hopelessness I could ever feel—and might I say, It’s a total rush. Go on. I dare you to try and derail my despondence train, Mara,” She giggled. “I’ll even give you extra points if you do more than bring me to my knees. Kill me, Mara. Bring this all to a crescendo and bury all of us in the ground.”

She searched my expression, her smile widening. “You’re not going to do that, are you?”

I didn’t reply, and she turned away from me. “It’s a lose-lose situation, sweetie. Kill us all and save the world from my influence or hold onto that hope you’re clinging onto and delude yourself into thinking you’re worth saving, that you’re definitely human and definitely deserve to live—only to let me slip through the gaps and set my sights on a whole new playground. The whole world, Mara. Imagine it.”

“It’ll be like, so much fun!” She mocked Luna’s playful squeak.

“So much fun, Mara!”

“So much fun!”

I kept walking, away from the classroom, away from her. The world seemed to blur around me as I got further from the classroom and was swallowed in the dark hallways filled with dead bodies and half converted freaks teetering on the edge of an update which never finished. Luna’s plan had been to connect everyone—freaks and Spindle subjects alike and create a greater intelligence. 

I’d stopped it somehow, and now I was looking at what could have been. I was on the third floor when I realised I was instinctively going back to Jasper’s classroom. It was my safe space, the first place I actually felt like was some kind of home. Not exactly a five stay hotel, but it had a door which would lock and the windows hadn’t been smashed in. Jasper had done a good job of turning it into a safe haven for survivors. I didn’t go back to Jasper’s classroom because there was nothing there for me anymore. Instead, I searched for a laptop or a computer, but the ones I found had been toasted, and not even my so-called magical touch would bring them back to life. 

I still didn’t understand our connection to technology. All we could really do was play with lights and interfere with TV static. Kind of lame.

Not exactly the electrokinetic powers Jasper had hoped for.

I’m not sure how long I spent searching for something I knew I wasn’t going to find. In the back of my head the outside world was planning on sending Blackwood into hell, and I had no communication with them. The roof was a possibility, but there was a bigger chance of being taken out if I did that.

Eventually, I found a classroom to hide in. It was a Math room, and the stupid door wouldn’t lock so I used my own body as a barricade, sliding to my knees and allowing myself an hour of sleep. I still had no idea what the virus’ next steps would be, and if Joey and his gang were going to come after me once they had been snapped out of it. When I left them, they had been connected to Jasper’s pain, screaming with him. Maybe I was naïve to have hope that they would somehow get a hold of their own minds and come back to me. 

After all, they had been turned via the video—that stupid meme Rory had broadcasted on every phone, every piece of technology. Mycroft’s associate has assured me that Jasper and Rory were the cure—but what kind of cure? Was he talking about curing Joey’s gang? Luna’s words were still haunting me. She was right, but I had to believe that what was inside us could be taken care of. I had to believe that I’d be thrown into some intense quarantine and I wouldn’t be let out until Luna and her influence was gone. 

And if it wasn’t? My thoughts whirred. 

What if they couldn’t remove her? 

What if she was stuck inside my head and I was going to be like this forever?

Forever craving agony and suffering.

Forever holding a blade to my own gut and revelling in the idea of carving into myself.

Stop, I told myself.

Stop thinking.

Stop worrying.

But then—overthinking and worrying felt human. I wasn’t sitting there mutilating my arms and legs, my head in the clouds. For once I was myself and I was going to cling onto my humanity for as long as I could. Accepting that I could be both—human and monster—had helped me regain myself.

If it could happen to me, then surely, surely the others could come back too.

And what about Connor? He was a foot soldier, or whatever that was. His conversion had been stopped too, like Jasper’s. When unwelcome images of him began flooding my mind, I buried my head in my ratty jeans and forced myself to sleep. Just an hour, that was all I needed. 

I don’t know how long I was asleep for—definitely more than two hours. When I lifted my head I could just about see tiny glimpses of light bleeding through the blinds and the bars on the windows. Sunlight.

It looked so strange bleeding through the darkness. When I was gathering my thoughts and drinking in my surroundings, a trashed math room covered in twisting vines which had thankfully left me alone--  a sudden crash sounded outside, sending me stumbling to unsteady feet. It couldn’t be a freak, I thought. The freaks had been taken down, at least for not. Until Luna started up another update.

It could be Joey’s gang, if they were back under the virus’s control.

Weighing my options, I grabbed a chair leg which already looked like it had been used as a weapon. I tightened my grip on it, and grabbed the door handle, pulling it open. 

The hallway was quiet as it was last night. I saw the same freshman girl lying face down on the ground, her brains pooling out of her skull—and to her left, an explosion of school work and textbooks spattered in red. 

I kept walking, ignoring corpses and splattered scarlet drowning the floor. Passing the math lab, all of their computers fried, I found myself wondering just how exactly was I planning on communicating with the people trying to help us? Tightening my grip on my weapon, I took slow steps, stumbling back when the crash sounded again. Closer. I held my breath and got ready to attack. It had to be one of Joey’s gang.

But it wasn’t.

When I stepped around the corner I was greeted to a dead end on the math corridor—and in the very middle was a shadow, a figure, bent over the remains of what looked like Mr Tanner. Next to them a locker was overturned spilling cockroaches and rotting food. The shadow was just that at that moment—a shadow. From the back they resembled a freak, the way they moved, their body twitching, their hands coming down and cupping into congealed red and scooping up mutilated guts. I waited, holding my breath, for the freak to gulp greedily from their hands and dig in properly. But they didn’t, pausing. 

It was then when I noticed what the freaks didn’t have. Restrain. And with that, intelligence.

Instead of mindlessly stuffing themselves with gore, they bathed in the blood, covering their face and their arms. I took a shaky step back. Freaks were bad, but intelligent freaks, also the Spindle subjects, were worse. Perfectly made psychopaths under the control of a sentient virus buried in their heads.

Something kept me moving closer, though. I don’t know why. I don’t know why my legs kept defying my brain, my breath in my throat, my thoughts whirring. No. There was no way I was allowing myself to fall in that abyss once more—that endless pool of darkness which wasn’t hope, because hope was naïve; hope only sets you up to be disappointed. The kid was a Spindle subject. That’s what I told myself.

Then—then how did I know the back of his jacket? I knew the hooded sweatshirt, I knew the back of his head which had been punctured by the vines which had entered his head and took him away from me. The back of his skull was mutilated, pieces of hair and bone and skin hanging off and it didn’t make sense for him to be moving like he was. Like he was alive. I was several feet from him when the shadow paused bathing himself in red and slowly turned to face me. His face looked like his, even if it wasn’t.

His eyes looked like his, even if they still looked inhuman, like hollow sockets with no real light. There was blood spattered all over his mouth and dripping down his chin, but the quirk on his lips and his brow lifting slightly when he realised it was me, was enough to finally accept hope.

Not hopelessness—not what I had been dwelling on for a whole year.

Hope.

It didn’t make sense why Jasper was kneeling in front of me covering himself in the guts of a freak. It didn’t make sense that he wasn’t back with Luna, a shell of himself, a broken, severed puppet screaming and clawing and reliving that memory until someone finally drove a blade through his skull.

Jasper slowly stood up and raised his hands slick glistening red.

“Do you remember my favourite TV show?”

I didn’t speak. I don’t think I could.

“The Walking Dead.” His smile widened when I found myself nodding to his words like an idiot. “Well, in episode two, or maybe three—you know, the episode I can’t watch because The Walkers like, tear into a poor horse,” He shuddered. “Anyway. Rick and the gang figure out that drenching themselves in blood and guts from the Walkers will give them the stink and the dead will think they’re dead too.” He shrugged. “It’s sort of like a mask, you know? To cover up the stink of living flesh and blood.” Jasper pulled a face. “It was gross, but it worked. They managed to get through a crowd of Walkers.”

I nodded slowly, swallowing hard. “So that’s what you’re doing.”

To my surprise, he laughed, and I caught that glimmer in his eye, that bouncing elation I’d seen in the other Spindle subjects. My heart sank.  “What? No! I mean, this is for fun. Watching it as a kid, I always wanted to know what bathing in blood would feel like,” He held out his arms. “And now I know.”

“How are you…” I shook my head, the table leg slipping from my grasp. “You died.”

“Died?” Jasper scoffed. “That’s a little dramatic. Brainwashed, yes. Purged of my humanity? Probably. Forced to relive my darkest moments and in need of therapy for the rest of my life? Definitely. But dead?”

I was backing away before I could stop myself, but Jasper sensed my urge to escape, to run, and jumped forwards, grabbing my arm. “Hey! It’s okay, I’m okay. I mean..” Jasper seemed to notice his bloody fingers and swiped them on his shirt. “I’m not like, fully okay,  because really, are any of us okay after all of this bullshit? But I’m okay enough to be okay. Does that… make sense?”

He grabbed me, suddenly, his eyes wild, but his.

Not the wild I had become used to with him under Luna’s control.

The “wild” when he was explaining his theories behind the virus or naming his favourite TV shows.

“You’re going to help us get out of here.” He said, his breath hot and heavy on my face. His smile widened. “So I can rip out my dad’s eyes and wear his skull as a hat!” He burst into laughter, and seeing my expression, he sighed.

“I don’t know who or what I am. You’re asking me? How am I supposed to know? I woke up feeling like myself again, I guess. I mean, I definitely tried to break my own leg earlier, and spend like half an hour slicing up my fingers—so I’d estimate me to be maybe 50% fucked up? Whatever that thing did to me is still there, dormant, very much a part of me, but I’m still, uh, me.”

“But—”

He cut me off. “Obviously the thing is still inside of me, so if I go full update, you’re welcome to brain me.” Jasper held up his hands. “I won’t stop you. Seriously. If that thing takes over again, kill me.”

“How?” I demanded.

“How what?”

I couldn’t resist a laugh. “Alive? How are you—how are you alive?!”

He shot me a look. “How should I know? I don’t know what day, time, month or year it is, I’ve been out of it for a while. All I remember is being on my knees getting mind fucked—literally—by Aurora Michaelson, and then I’m waking up in front of her corpse—which freaked me the hell out. It was moving, like parts of it looked like it was stitching back together.” Pausing for breath, Jasper pulled a face. “Have you seen Alien? It was like every clique part in that movie. That thing is evolving into a goddamn beast.” His eyes lit up. “So if Rory’s dead, does that mean we’ve defeated this thing?”

“Not even close.” I bit back a snort.

Jasper punched himself in the temple. “I can sense her still in my head. Like a never ending headache. Can I get her out? You got all those vines out of my head, right? All we need is a knife. I’ll even do it myself. I don’t want to end up like that, Mara. Whatever happened to Rory. The state she was in—” He was speaking so fast, so convoluted, I could barely understand him. Part of me knew why. Jasper didn’t want to talk about things that were really on his mind; like how exactly he had come back.

“Slow down.” I hissed. “What are you talking about? What did you see?”

Jasper raised a brow. “I told you. It was the scene from Alien.” He mimed something exploding from his chest. “You know, the scene. The scene that was memed before memes were even a thing.”

I hissed out an exasperated breath. “I haven’t seen Alien.”

He frowned. “Really? Huh. Well, I just showed you. That thing is like an amalgamation. If I had to guess, it’s going to combine with the freaks, and then it’s followers. So, the bottom line? We’re fucked.” Jasper caught my eye. “Well, it’s a matter of perspective. It depends how our brains are going to react to this. Are we going to feel immense pleasure at the idea of being swallowed by The Blob, or…”

“We’re getting out of here.” I said in a breath. “I’m getting us out.”

“Right.” Jasper nodded. “And how exactly are we going to do that? Did you find a secret Discord server I didn’t know about?”

I didn’t have to say anything—I saw the realisation dawn on his face.

“My laptop.” He whispered, his eyes searching mine. “Before she… before she got into my head, I  told you to get my laptop, and I’m guessing, since my brain went by-bye for a while, you, uh, did.”

I nodded.

“And.” Jasper’s eyes darkened. “You saw the whole evil dad thing, huh.”

I could tell from the look on his face—Jasper already knew I had knowledge of his father and our past. He remembered what he had done under the virus's influence, and I don’t think he wanted to talk about any of that—which I was fine with. There was a time and place, and it wouldn’t be there, when the two us were trapped inside a ticking time bomb. Instead of answering him, I turned and started walking, grabbing my weapon. “You toasted your laptop when you were under the virus’s influence, which means we’ve lost communication with the people trying to help us,” I kept walking, quickening my pace as he hurried to catch up.

I noticed Jasper was stumbling more than usual, grabbing the walls for support. Then I remembered the damage done to his head and I had to swallow a sickly feeling rising up my throat. “So far, I’ve managed to only hear pieces of what they’re trying to tell us. It sounds like they’re going to set off a controlled explosion and I don’t know when that is. Every time they tried to speak to me, Luna blocked her from getting through.” I sucked in a breath. “They were asking for you.”

Jasper didn’t look at me, though I felt him stiffen next to me.

“Yeah. That makes sense. The asshole made me immune, after all.”

“So, you’re going to go back to him?”

“Sure. I’ll go back to him.” Jasper shot me a grin. “Then I’ll rip his fucking guts out.”

“What are you?” I found myself choking out, when we were searching the staff room. Jasper found an old laptop under a desk and stabbed at the keys, prodding the power button. He didn’t reply for a moment, his gaze on the black screen. When I leaned over him I glimpsed a stray tendril, one which looked like it was withering and dying, sticking from his head. The weapon in my hand felt so much heavier, and I squeezed it in my fist. “Who knows. “ Jasper said, pulling me from reverie. The laptop screen lit up and he let out a hiss of excitement, “All right, fucking finally! We’re getting somewhere.”

The laptop booted to the password screen and he sat back, his fingers tapping out variations of the same number. Above us the light flickered. Jasper stopped typing and looked up. “So, we’re still one with the electronics?”

I shrugged. “You could say that.”

Jasper’s smile softened. “Sweet.” He muttered, his attention going back to the laptop.

“Alright, let’s see if this dinosaur has internet.”

After a while of trying and failing to get an internet connection, Jasper sighed. “To answer your question, I was telling you the truth when I said I don’t know what or who I am. I’m both sides of the coin right now. Hope and hopelessness, human and monster. I’m both myself, but I’m also influenced by the thing in my head. I still..” He paused, gripping the edge of the table, his knuckles turning white.

“I still—fuck. I can’t explain it.” Jasper turned to me, and his expression was something I couldn’t read. “Before I saved you, and I was studying Joey and his freak gang, I couldn’t understand what they were doing. Enjoying suffering and pain and hurting yourself was like being on a different plane to me, but when the virus got in my head, and I remembered… I remembered who I was, and what I did—”

I expected him to cry, his eyes were glistening and his grip on the table was tightening. When his lips quirked into a grin, though, I understood why. “I get it.” Jasper’s laugh was choked and hysterical. “I understand why people go fucking mad, you know? Why they want to make themselves hurt. That’s what my dad wanted. He wanted people to revel in pain and not pleasure. He wanted them to feel good when in pain, and suffering. The bastard wanted people to bask in their worst moments.”

“What you did.” I found myself saying, and he stopped for a moment.

“Yeah. What I did.”

His eyes went back to the laptop and he started typing again. “So, yeah, I guess shit like that can’t be erased. My dad’s prototype exaggerated on that urge and twisted the human mind into something monstrous.

Depression is suddenly fucking good. It’s something to indulge in and that is so fucked up, but that’s how I feel. The virus is still inside me and it’s still controlling me, still wriggling inside my head and making me want to do bad shit—to myself and..” He trailed off, his fingers dancing across the keyboard. “And.. I don’t know, I guess something broke. Whatever hold it had over me came loose, and I was able to think for myself. And I think that’s because I--- well, I guess I accepted it. Instead of hiding away and suppressing it to the back of my head, which made me a target, I came to terms with what I did… or what I didn’t do..” I noticed Jasper was shaking, his teeth gritted. 

“And I was let go.”

He laughed, making me jump.

“Who knows? I could go back to being a psycho any moment. I mean, I’m definitely not myself, and that scares me. But hey, at least I’m at least some of myself, right? Like, maybe 25%. Maybe 30 .”

He winked at me. “But being scared is good, right? See, dad didn’t quite iron out the creases in his precious project. Mutated or not, we’ve both proved that we can still come back from it. Or hey, maybe the old man was right, and I really am the so-called symbol of humanity with the magic touch.”

I found myself smiling. “Do you always speak in movie quotes and percentages?”

“No idea. I’ve had most of my life erased. I only remember certain things because I watch them on repeat.” Jasper murmured, his interest piqued by something which had flashed on the screen.

“Hey, Jasper?” I started to ask him about the others, about Joey and Connor, when he hissed.

“Yes! Internet! No idea how the fuck we have it, but why question, right?”

I nodded, swallowing my words.

Jasper’s smile dampened. “Oh, no. Seriously, now?” He punched the desk. “Fuck!”

“What is it?”

The boy jumped up, grabbing the laptop. “The math floor is well known for its shitty internet connection. We need to go downstairs. The best connection is near the cafeteria on the ground floor. We need to be quick,” He gasped out, “This school’s going to blow and we’re going to pieces with it.”

“Right.” I said breathlessly. “When do you, uh, when do you think it’s going to blow?”

For once, he wasn’t smiling. “Any moment now, I’m certain of it.” His lips broke out into a grin, and he grabbed my arm while his other held the laptop. “Still, doesn’t that fill you with, I don’t know—a sense of anticipation?” He gasped out as we ran. “I mean sure, we could die, but…” Jasper turned to meet my gaze, and his smile was warm. “We might not. Come on, I like our odds. Be blown up together and let out twisted brains enjoy the pure fucked up pleasure of meeting our doom, or actually get out.”

Jasper was speaking complete bullshit—like a different language.

And I loved every minute of it.

We headed down the first two floors, but when Jasper suddenly stumbled back around the corner, clutching the laptop to his chest, I grabbed his arm, pulling him back. “What is it?”

Jasper didn’t reply, and I followed his gaze. At first I thought the floor was moving, though as I moved closer, keeping a tight grasp on his arm, I saw what it was. It reminded me of a monster from an old black and white movie, a pulsating mass made up of amalgamated bodies and dead flesh combined together. The thing was moving down the hallway, slowly, eating everything in its path—while tendrils sprouted from its centre and spread it further down the walls and the floor. Looking at the thing, I was reminded of Rory, or what was left of her.

That was what it was. the bulging creature in from me had started in the room I’d left her in. I couldn’t breathe suddenly, and it no—it didn’t fill me with euphoria and happiness that my breath was being sucked from my lungs. I was scared. Terrified. 

I started moving backwards, though the floor underneath us was starting to rumble, and when I looked down, the thing was sprouting through cracks in the flooring, twisted tendrils clawing for my ankles.

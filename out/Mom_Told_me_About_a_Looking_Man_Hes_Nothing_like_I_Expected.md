*Do not be afraid if you see a man looking at you through your bedroom window. It's just the "Looking Man".*  My mother used to tell stories of her experiences with the Looking Man to prevent me from fearing him when He came to visit me. Her experiences were deemed acceptable by my grandparents, as they claim the Looking Man also visited them multiple times. To them, it's a tradition for the family's women to be greeted by this "man". I hadn't met the Looking Man until my 18th birthday, which was earlier this month.

After celebrating my birthday with my family, friends, and my amazing boyfriend, I settled down and got ready for bed. This was the first time my parents allowed my boyfriend to spend the night with me, so I was pretty excited. We binged horror movies, because who doesn't watch horror movies in October? Now that I think about it, that might've been a bad idea, as I'm a total scaredy-cat. We stayed up until maybe 1 am before falling asleep together, and it was the safest I've ever felt in a long time. 

I awoke at around 3:30 to the sound of scratching on my window. I assumed it was the dogs, as they've been known to jump around at night. My brain was still asleep, so I ignored it and cuddled up to my boyfriend. He was still sleeping, and I felt like having a little more snuggling time with him before my parents could kick him out in the morning. Everything felt right at that moment, until I felt a pair of eyes staring me down. Glancing at my boyfriend, I could see that his eyes were still closed. 

At that point, I was wide awake. Sitting up, I scanned the entire room. Everything seemed normal, until my eyes drifted toward the window. There, I could just barely make out the figure of a man. The only thing I could make out of his face were His with eyes, which looked to be the size of golf balls. The hairs on the back of my neck stood tall, and I went to shake my boyfriend. The man outside the window brought His boney finger up to His mouth as if telling me to be quiet. I kept my eyes on the man while slowly reaching my hand to my boyfriend. I quietly shook him, to which he grumbled and turned the other way. I turned to look at my boyfriend and harshly shook him, causing him to jolt up. 

*Wake up, there's a man outside the window and I'm scared,* I whispered to my half-awake boyfriend. He told me that he'd take care of it and told me to go back to sleep. I remained sitting upright while my boyfriend got up, grabbed the nearest sharp object, and stepped to the window. He moved the curtain aside and held up his weapon. After scanning the area, he got back in bed. *Nobody's there. I think you're just scared from all those movies. Let's go back to sleep.* My boyfriend laid down and started playing with my hair before going back to sleep. I stayed awake the rest of the night, scared He would try something while we were both asleep.

My eyes were glued to the window until daylight struck. My boyfriend woke up, and my parents decided that he should join us for breakfast. At the table, I was as quiet as a mouse. I didn't eat much of what was on my plate, and soon, everyone noticed. My mother asked me if I didn't like the food, to which I straight up told them about what I'd seen. The family looked around at each other before my mother glanced at me with a smile on her face. *It seems the Looking Man has paid you His first visit.* 

It's been a few weeks since that conversation, and now every night, I'm greeted by the Looking Man. However, each time He appears, He gets stranger and stranger. One night, the Looking Man had both of His hands on the window, and then the next night, He'd continuously tap on the window to make sure I didn't get sleep. Last night, the Looking Man stuck His long tongue out, licking the outside of my window for the entire time He was there. It's 4 a.m. as I'm typing this, and the Looking Man is not outside. I can see His big eyes staring at me from an opening in my closet. He hasn't moved, He's just... looking at me. I'm starting to freak out, but I don't want to make any sudden movements in case it angers Him. If anyone has any advice on what to do about this, please don't hesitate to comment.

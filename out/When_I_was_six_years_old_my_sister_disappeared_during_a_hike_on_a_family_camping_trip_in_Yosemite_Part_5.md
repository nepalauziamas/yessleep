*It was happening again; I was drowning. But it wasn’t like last time. There were no bodies, no waves crashing against me. I wasn’t being sucked underneath by the rip-roaring current, threatening to pull me under.*

*No, I was sinking.*

*My arms were outstretched above me, like I was Adam reaching for God. The white-blue light above me was fading fast, and the few bubbles that escaped my mouth looked like pearls as they drifted upwards. They wrapped around my hands, as if struggling to pull me upwards. I had to swim, I had to move, I had to do… something. But I couldn’t, no matter how hard I tried.*

*It’s like I was frozen. Or rather, I WAS frozen. I strained, pushing against my limbs as hard as I could. But nothing. My hair swirled around me, a cloud of curly brown ringlets and my ears popped, aching horribly, as I continued to sink.*

*Down, down, I sank like a stone until the light above me faded into black.*

*Then there was nothing. Except my own consciousness, crying out against the dark.*

\*\*\*

I gasped, snapping awake. My life exploded into color and sound, and my heart raced as I tried to shake the feeling from my dream. My blood pounded in my ears, and my chest hurt as I tried to slow it down. It was dark, the only source of light was the blue fluorescent light from the old-school alarm clock. It reflected eerily in the dark room. It was the same white-blue light from my dream.

It took me a second to remember where I was. Then it hit me.

*I’m in a spare room in Jack’s parent’s cabin. Arjun and I got here two days ago after literally fleeing from Tuolumne Hospital. Arjun had just been shot in the leg, and I’d rushed him to the hospital after I witnessed him bleeding out in the backseat. Then, after being trapped in a janitor’s closet and witnessing all our parents gathered in Dr. Jenkins’s office discussing Paula and… God knows what… Jack told us to hide out here. Jack got in last night, and… he brought Louise with him.*

The bedroom was quiet, apart from a light buzz of conversation from the living room. Groggily, I wiped the sleep from my eyes. *What woke me up?*

Suddenly, as if to answer my question, I heard a knock at my door. Then another. “Hello?” I called out. The door creaked, as Arjun cautiously poked his head inside. “Hey Aimee.” He whispered. “You’re up.”

“I am now.” I grumbled. I stretched; my legs felt like pins and needles. “Can I help you with something?” Glancing at the alarm clock, I realized that *it was 9:52 in the evening.* My heart skipped a beat: *I’d slept almost the entire day.*

“Uh, yeah.” He sounded strained. He futzed with his robe for a moment; tying, then untying the belt. My heart slowed to a hard thud. “Can you… come out here when you’re ready?” He said. Monroe, who I hadn’t realized was in bed with me, groaned in response. She rolled over, pulling the covers off the bed. The cold air washed over me, alighting a wave of goosebumps over my bare skin. It felt like slivers of ice.

I shivered. “Right now?”

Arjun paused. “Please come out. When you’re ready.”

The room spun for a second, before settling into a hard stone in the pit of my stomach. Hard as I might, I couldn’t shake that *feeling* from my dream. The darkness, swallowing me whole. That sensation of total *nothingness…* I shivered. I knew what was waiting for me in the darkness. It was the same thing that waited for me in the living room.

My stomach grumbled. Loudly. I groaned. *It was time to face the music.*

\*\*\*

I shrugged on a white sweater and pants, the thick cable-knit comforting me as I walked out into the living room.

They’d obviously just gotten done eating dinner, as several large pizza boxes were stacked on the kitchen counter. POPPA JOE’S PIZZERIA screamed from the boxes, as a small red figurine gestured as if in mid-sniff. Tacky, but it made my stomach growl nonetheless.

Suddenly, I stopped hard in my tracks. “Fuck.” I whispered.

*Everyone* was here. Jack hadn’t just brought Louise, he’d brought along the *entire old gang.*  My heart leapt to my throat. Mikey and Patrice. Jack and Louise. Arjun stood watching in the kitchen, as he silently filled up the dishwasher. In fact, they all fell silent as I walked in. The ghosts from my past were all here and they were *staring at me*.

*I couldn’t believe it.* Over the past three years, I’d often fantasized about this moment- the moment where we’d all be back in the same room, and we’d be forced to reckon with the choices from our past. And as the three years of uncertainty and silence dragged on, I’ll admit that I even began to *welcome* the thought of reconciliation.

But now, standing in front of my judge, jury, and executioner; all I wanted was to run away and hide. It was the same feeling I’d had back three years ago, on the day of the picnic. And like that day, I felt myself suddenly hit a dangerous breaking point.

My fingernails ripped into my palms, drawing blood. *FUCK this whole endeavor.*

My face flushed. I don’t know what I thought I was doing by coming here, trying to solve this fifteen year-old mystery about my sister. I felt dumb and and silly and *stupid*. Feeling tears burning at the back of my throat, I turned to go.

\*\*\*

Suddenly, I heard a squeal. “Oh, I just- can’t take it anymore!” Patrice cried as she jumped up from the couch. Tripping over a pair of shoes, she threw her arms out and hugged me hard. “I’ve missed you so much!”

“I missed you too,” I mumbled. She was tiny, smaller than my 5’4” frame, and the beads in her hair jangled loudly in my ear. I breathed in deep: Shea butter and lilacs. She smelled, and looked, the exact same. Even wearing her trademark bright colors: as today’s outfit was of a bright pink sweatshirt with oversized, neon green flowers.

Mikey suddenly jumped up too. “Are you doin’ a group-hug without me?” He leapt over the back of the couch and practically stumbled into us, almost knocking us over. “*We* missed you, Aimee-bell.” My heart twinged painfully.

“We *called* you!” Patrice cried, reproachfully. She pulled away. “I called you, Mikey called you… Did you change your number without telling us?” She says, jokingly, but I can see the hurt lurking in the corners of her eyes. “I know a lot has happened, and I know you said you needed time but, I… we…” She gestured around. “Didn’t expect it to be this long.”

“Yeah.” Mikey chirps up. “Did ya die or something?”

“Yeahhhh.” Patrice giggled. “Did you die?”

“Maybe she was *high*.”

*Here we go.* The room went silent. I looked over at Louise, my face burning with an unfamiliar heat. *Louise has been waiting to say that*. But before I could retort, Jack stepped in-between us. His tight black sweatshirt and gray sweatpants were covered in pizza crumbs.

“Can I maybe… get some pizza before we start this?” I tried to say, before Jack cut me off.

“Okay.” He held his arms up. “Just wait. We just got here. We’ve all been through a lot, you two especially. What happened fifteen years ago, with Paula and Daphne going missing…”

“Except Daphne *isn’t* missing.” Her words dripped like acid.

Jack hung his head. “Again? Okay.” He said placidly.  “Whatever happened fifteen years ago, it rocked our town. And it *tore apart* your lives.” He looked at me. I looked down, avoiding his eyes. “We are *all* still dealing with this.”

”*Dealing* with it? No, I *dealt* with it.” Louise burst out, sounding incredulous. “I’m *fine*. I’m not the one who showed up high to *everything*. *My* softball games, to our *middle school graduation*. To our *high school graduation*. For *fuck’s* sake.” She took a step forward, jabbing her finger into his chest. “How *dare you* compare the two of us. Everyone always did.” Her voice cracked, but she refused to waver. “Meanwhile, I was there for everything. I was there for *us*. No matter how *painful* the experience was.” Her dark skin burned with an uncomfortable heat, and her eyes looked red. But other than that, her perfect features didn’t show a single crack in their cold, marble facade.

“I graduated with *honors*. I was on the Dean's List, I.. I went to the softball championship game. I was fucking *captain* for Chrissake.” She stood tall at the end of the room, like an obelisk in the desert. She was wearing just a simple white t-shirt and black athletic shorts, but at the moment, she looked regal. Her blind resolve stood steadfast, refusing to crack or chip even as time bore down upon it.

“I did everything *right*.” She finally growled. “I did not allow myself to *fall apart*.” That hung in the air for a moment. And it tore at my soul with every passing second.

The room was quiet. “Look, Louise.” Arjun finally sighed. “You can’t… compare how people grieve. Not everybody is strong like you.”

*Fuck, that stung.*

I felt myself going numb. *“...You’re weak,”* echoed my brain. *“...Powerless. Pathetic.”* I crossed my arms tightly over my chest. *“...Useless.”* God, I just wanted a slice of pizza. And a *pill*.

“Also,” Arjun blindly continued. “Here’s where I’m confused.” He gestured to the group, “We know there’s been… issues.” I felt a jab in my heart. *He meant the drugs.* “But you were always her biggest supporter.” He pointed at Louise, who looked like she was close to tears. “Up until the last three years, it was YOU that helped her.” He looked around at everyone. “We all helped obviously, but YOU helped her the most.”

*None of them knew the whole story.* The shame that’d been eating away at me for the last few years flared up, churning in my stomach. My body felt tingly, and weirdly light. I’d never been sure if she’d told them, and now I knew for certain she hadn’t. *Fuck*. I wanted nothing more than to bolt back to that little spare room. *Fuck* the pizza.

“What happened?”

But Louise was shaking her head, her face murderous. “I already told you-.”

Arjun sighed, exasperated. “You told us that *something* happened after the picnic when Jack and Aimee broke up. Which ruined the entire day, might I add.” He paused and glanced over at Jack. “Sorry. But it’s true.” Jack just shrugged.

“But you refused to talk about it then, and you’re refusing to talk about it now. You’re also refusing to help me now.” Arjun sounded dangerously exasperated. Milo, who was still strapped to his chest, bounced around with each furious gesture. “Do you see why I’m upset? There’s something fucked up going on in our town, you have a direct connection to it, and you’re refusing to help me.” Louise was shaking her head fiercely, but Arjun continued on.

“Yes. You. DO! Whatever happened to Daphne is connected to Paula and to everything else!”

“Okay. Alright.” Jack stepped in between Arjun and Louise. “Look, Louise,” He said gently, after pausing for a moment. “I get it. With Daphne disappearing and your dad… pushing you hard.” He tried to hold her hand but Louise pulled away sharply, as if she’d been slapped. “But it’s okay. Not everything is your responsibility.”

“Besides-” Arjun interjected, his voice a deadly whisper. His face was flushed, heated. “I know you brought the letters, Louise.” He was breathing hard. “Jack told me.”

\*\*\*

If Arjun looked angry, Louise looked like she was ready to commit genocidal murder. But she paused, closing her eyes for a brief moment. “Yes, it’s true.” She said finally, her voice a deadly calm. “I told Jack, *in confidence*, that I had the letters. But.” She let that hang in the air for a moment. “I’m not sharing them with you,” She pointed at me. “Until she leaves.”

The room exploded. Everybody was yelling now, all for different reasons. Arjun was yelling at Louise, Jack was yelling at Arjun. Mikey was yelling at everyone to calm down, and Patrice just kept whispering to me that “it’s okay, everything’s gonna be okay.”

She squeezed my hands, trying to make me feel better. Patrice was one of my best friends, and the sweetest person I’d ever met. She’d been there for me after the whole thing went down with Jack, and then Louise. But I couldn’t squeeze her hand back, or even offer her a half-hearted smile. I couldn’t do any of that, because.. because..

My head was starting to hurt.

My blood went cold. “No.” I whispered, feeling my heartbeat suddenly thud. “Not again.”

“Did you say something, Aimee?” Patrice asked, with concern. But I ignored her. I pulled away and curled my hands into fists. “Aimee, hey. It’s okay honey. Calm down, we’re not going to make you leave-” But I pushed her off, walking into the living room. Everybody was still yelling at each other, so nobody noticed as I sat at the end of one of the gray, velvet sofas. I massaged my temples, as I felt another headache threatening to take over.

*Not again. God, not again.* It was like riding the edge of a wave I had no control over. The kaleidoscope of feelings ripped through me, and my head was spinning right along with it.

I slid off the couch, pressing my back against the cool glass of the floor-to-ceiling windows. It was snowing outside, and the cold burned through the heat in my body. It felt good. I breathed in deep, trying to settle my mind.

In. Out. *Calm down, Aimee.* I thought desperately to myself. *Just calm down.*

\*\*\*

*Fuck*, I wished desperately I’d never left my room. I just wanted to go back to bed.

*Tap*.

My right eye twitched and I closed them hard. The growing headache threatened to spill, like a barely-contained fire. I curled my hands, my nails digging painfully into my palms. I could feel myself drawing blood again.

The snow hit the window outside, tapping faintly.

*Tap.*

*Tap.*

***TAP.***

*Fuck!* My eyes flew open. *Hold on.. What the* ***fuck*** *was that?*

I whipped around, my eyes going wide. It was dark on the balcony outside. In the dark reflection, the only thing I could see were my wide, panicked eyes. My head pounded; but I held my breath, listening hard. A heartbeat or two passed. Nothing, except for the wind. Shrugging, I turned back around.

*Tap.* The second I turned around, there it was again. *Tap. Taptaptap.* ***TAP***\*.\* My heart jolted, and my body froze. *No. There’s no way.* That didn’t sound like snow. Even with wind. It was too forceful, too consistent, too...

*It can’t be.* My brain crawled to a stop. *Because if it’s true…*

*Oh, God.* My heart stopped too. There was someone tapping on the window outside.

\*\*\*

My heart qualied. “Guys?” I tried to say, my heart pounding out of control. “Hey, guys?” But my voice failed. I felt pinned to the spot. I tried again. “HEY guys?”

Patrice, bless her heart, was the one who noticed I was trying to speak. She grabbed Louise’s arm, nudging her gently. But Louise was too far gone. She was a runaway train and Arjun had shoved her off the tracks. She pushed Patrice off roughly. “Oh I’M the problem?” She cried, her face a dark red. “I’M the one with control issues? Except for the fact that *I* kept this group together. It was ME. While everyone else allowed themselves to fall apart, I didn’t have that luxury. I was not ALLOWED that. But sure, tell me how I’M the fucking problem.”

She was swaying in the middle of the living room, her dark skin shining with an odd, unusual glow. I could’ve sworn that in that moment, her dark eyes looked like they were glowing too. They locked into me. Everything stopped, and I felt my heart plummet.

“Tell them what happened, Aimee.”

\*\*\*

*Three years of guilt. Layered like concrete on my soul.*

*Fuck*. The silence now felt heavy, and empty. Like a dead body. I opened my mouth, my jaw shaking, but nothing came out. Louise was standing at the edge of the living room, her arms crossed. “Go ahead.” Louise said softly. “Tell them what happened.”

“I-I was-” The words stuck together, clogging my throat. *I couldn’t do it.*

But from the look on her face, I knew she wasn’t going to let me stop.

I cleared my throat. “Shit. You guys know most of it. I- was living at Louise’s. My- mom had kicked me out, but I couldn’t get a spot in rehab so I- I pretended to be okay.” I closed my eyes. “So no one would worry.”

“You all wanted me to be clean *so bad*. Jack especially-” I felt a tear slide down my cheek. I was overwhelmed.  “And I was *failing* you.” I wiped it away. “The day of the picnic I’d gotten into a fight with my mom about her not letting me come home. And instead of dealing with it, I- I-”

I winced. I hated reliving this. “That’s when Jack caught me. I- well, you know the rest. But I left. I *ran*. And Louise followed me back to her house.”

“And…” I stuttered. “And there-” *No*. *I couldn’t do it.* I stopped.

“She stole my car.” Louise finished for me, the anger burning in her eyes. Still alive after all these years. “High on pills, drunk off her ass, she stole my car and while backing out of my driveway, she hit my dogs.” There it was. The *secret*. I couldn’t bear to look up.

“And the worst part is, she was so drunk she didn’t even realize it.” Louise continued softly. “They were still alive after she hit them, but she just kept driving.”

\*\*\*

There it was. Her pound of flesh. I couldn’t breathe. Her words felt like a thousand tiny cuts, each one deeper than the last. My eyes were locked downwards, as the long, stunned silence threatened to swallow me whole. It was Mikey who finally spoke. “Uhh. What..”

“Yeah, *holy* shit. Louise.” Arjun interrupted, his words catching and tumbling over themselves. “But I thought that.. I mean, you told us-”

“Wait hold on, I need-”

“Miiiiikey. Shut *up*.” Louise spit, bitterly. She turned back to Arjun. “I told everyone that she left the door open, and my dogs got out. To spare her.” She pointed at me and spit the words out. “But I’m done caring.” She was pacing at the edge of the living room. Even though I wasn’t looking up, I could practically *sense* the daggers she was staring at me.

“I’m *done* caring.” She repeated. “I’m done protecting her, I’M DONE-”

“SHUT THE FUCK UP.” Louise whipped around to face Mikey, who looked shocked at his own interruption. He was lurking off to the side, opposite from where Louise and Arjun were standing. Louise’s face contorted as the pain and anger rippled through, but she paused as she saw the horrified expression on Mikey’s face.

The room grew very quiet, as Monroe suddenly started to growl at the balcony doors.

“I mean.” Mikey stammered. “Well, I mean yes. That’s fucking terrible. Of course.” He held his hands up. “But before we address that…” He raised one shaking finger, pointing past me towards the balcony. “Does anyone else see what the *fuck* is standing behind Aimee?”

\*\*\*

***BANG.*** The dark balcony exploded into a cacophony of noise.

BANG. BANG. BANG.

BANGBANGBANG. **BANG**.

Suddenly, the cabin was plunged into darkness.

\*\*\*

“THEY HIT THE GENERATOR” Jack cried. “FLASHLIGHTS ARE IN THE KITCHEN.”

“GOD NO, NO FLASHLIGHTS.” Arjun yelled back. “IT WOULD SEE US INSIDE.”

I could hear the balcony doors shaking as Monroe threw herself against them. She was growling viciously, growing louder by the second. Somebody was screaming. *Was it me?* “CAN SOMEONE GET MONROE TO STOP?” Arjun yelled again. “SHE’S GOING TO BREAK THE DOORS.”

Patrice was moaning, somewhere off next to me. “SOMEBODY HELP ME, PLEASE. WE’RE GOING TO DIE.” Suddenly, I felt her run full-tilt into me. “We’re NOT going to die.” I whispered, pulling her into me. I reached out, feeling for another body and grabbing what felt like a shoulder. It was Arjun. “Arjun, *what* the *FUCK* is-” But I stopped as he grabbed my arm with a vise-like grip.

“Listen.” He whispered, pointing upwards.

BANG. *BANG*. ***BANG***.

BANG\*.\* ***BANG***\*. SShhhhhkkkk. Shhkkk.\* My face paled. It was coming from the skylight.

“It’s a diversion.” Arjun’s hand tightened on my arm. “Jack!” He whispered urgently. I squinted as Jack, still wrestling a growling Monroe, stumbled over. “Jack, focus!” Arjun whispered again. “What room doesn’t have a skylight?!”

“Mine.” I whipped around. Louise was standing right behind me. “Mine doesn’t.”

\*\*\*

Jack, Louise and Mikey quickly started barricading the door. In the pitch-black darkness, they fumbled over themselves as Jack dragged an enormous dresser against the door and Louise started to pull over one of the twin beds. This was the old storage room where Jack’s mom had kept her crafts. They’d converted it into a spare room after she’d passed, but being that the only window in here was in the door that led to the backyard, we didn’t use it very often.

In her haste Louise accidentally knocked into Patrice, who fell limply to the floor. I rushed over to pick her up. Patrice grabbed my arm, digging her fingernails painfully into my skin. She pulled me in, practically shoving her lips against my ear. “We’re gonna *die*, Aimee.” She sounded choked up, like she was crying. “We’re gonna *die*.”

“No, we’re not-” I whispered back. But she was shaking her head, vehemently. Her beads hit me in the face. “No, nonono.” Her fingernails dug in. “I’ve *seen* this. I know how *this* ends.” My body went cold at her words. I leaned back, but I could barely make out her features in the pitch-blackness. “The *fuck*… Patrice, we’ll be *safe*\-”

“*Safe?*”

Louise whirled around at the sound of my voice. “We’re being fucking *attacked*. By fucking… *something*. We don’t even know what.” She turned to face the back wall, where Mikey was standing. “By the way- what the *fuck* did you see, Mikey?”

No response. Louise’s voice softened. “..Mikey?”

There was no response. Jack clicked a pen light on, illuminating Mikey who was in the corner of the room. He was sitting with his back against the wall, his arms wrapped tight around his legs. His head was between his knees. “Mikey..” Jack said, slowly. “Mikey, what did you *see*?”

“Was it.. Did it… look like a person?” I whispered, my voice cracking. I watched as Mikey slowly looked up, barely able to keep his head straight. He was shaking like a leaf, but he managed to lock eyes with me. My body went cold at the sight of them- they looked *black*.

“It looked… melted.” Mikey whispered. My blood went still. *Fuck, that’s how Paula looked too.* “*Melted*, what do you mean-” Louise sputtered. “What person looks *melted*?” Mikey started rocking back and forth.

“That’s because that… wasn’t a person.”

Louise turned to Arjun and Jack. “We need to go. We need to get out of here.” But Arjun scoffed. “And go… where?” He said incredulously. “*Everywhere* is fucked up.”

“We can go *home*.” Louise cried. “Jesus Christ, we can go to my dad. He’ll *understand*\-”

But Arjun was shaking his head. “No, he won’t.” Louise fell silent. The room went quiet. *And so was the roof,* I realized\*.\* “Arjun’s right.” I said, grimly. “He’s part of it.” Louise flinched at the sound of my voice. She whimpered, softly choking back a sob. “Part… of *what*?”

Arjun carefully placed a hand on her shoulder. In the dim reflection of the alarm clock’s  white-blue light, the same one I had in my room, I realized that she was shaking like a leaf. “There’s been weird shit happening for a very, very long time in our town.” Arjun’s voice shook slightly, as if the weight of the knowledge was getting too hard to bear. He paused for a moment.

“I think it’s time we see those letters, Louise.”

\*\*\*

Time stopped as she pulled them out from the bottom of her suitcase. They were packaged in a clear, white sleeve, slightly crumpled from the weight of her clothes. *Here they were,* I thought to myself. *Right in front of me.*

>\[\[ Nobody knew for sure what was growing underneath the great forests and plains that covered the world they lived in. The first recorded mention of the Great Something came in the form of a carved, rock tablet. The tablet was clearly meant for some sort of ritual; the kneeling figures showed prayer to something far beyond us. But they weren’t kneeling to a deity or some sort of blasphemous Church. No; they were kneeling to two figures. Two children, to be precise.\]\]

“Oh.” I said softly, as the soft blush of recognition crept over me. “I know this. It’s.. it’s the fairytale that Daphne used to tell us as kids.” I said, softly. I looked up at Louise- she was crying, her head in her hands.

“*This* is a fairytale?” Jack asked incredulously, as he held another letter. “Seems kind of… *dark*.” Jack, Arjun and I were huddled on the remaining twin bed with the letters spread amongst us. Mikey still hadn’t moved from the corner he’d wedged himself in, and Patrice was sitting next to him. I shook my head. “Well, no. It’s more of a story.”

Jack’s flashlight danced, flickering from one letter to the other. The bone-white letters lit up and flashed. There were eight of them in total. “A story about two kids, growing up on either side of a river.” I sighed. “There were lots of stories, actually. But she liked to tell us this one.”

“The stones create ripples. And though the stones are thrown at separate times, and in different places, a few ripples will still inevitably meet.” I looked over at Jack, who was completely absorbed in the letter he was holding. His hands bent gracefully around the piece of paper, as he did his best to hold it gently. A memory danced at the edge of my consciousness, but with a quick twist of my head I chased it away. I cleared my throat. “And where those particular ripples meet, the energy grows so great it can swallow entire ships whole.” I sighed again. “Something… like that at least.”

“*Uh huh.*” Arjun said. I noticed he wasn’t touching the letters. “Louise, where did you find these?”

Louise choked a sob. “The first one arrived in 2007, the year after she disappeared. Then the next one in 2008, then in 2010.” She picked up a letter. She pointed to something at the very top. “There’s dates… . I’m guessing it's when she dropped them off.”

“Dropped them off *where*.” Arjun asked, cautiously. He was refusing to let them near his body. His blue robe pulled tightly around his body, with Milo now in his lap and his cast propped up on the nearby nightstand. Louise looked up at him, her eyes taking on an angry sheen. “If you *must know*…” She said slowly. “They were shoved into the wooden frame of my childhood bedroom window.”

Jack looked up, confused. “But wasn’t your bedroom-”

“On the third floor? Yes it was.”

Arjun blanched. “Louise… but that’s crazy.” She immediately guffawed, startling Monroe from her sleep. “Crazy?! *Imagine* how I felt. Just *imagine* it for one second. I couldn’t handle it.” She looked down at the letters, her eyes going sad again. “*I* felt crazy.”

She traced the edges of a letter. “The first four letters were wedged in there so tightly, that I didn’t find them until the day after my fifteenth birthday” she said, sighing, “Which is of course, when I woke up to two letters nailed to the outside frame of my window.”

“...*Nailed* to the outside of your window…”

“The *story*, the *handwriting…*” I said, close to tears as I interrupted Arjun. “Louise. My God, who else could it be? It’s *her*.”

Louise’s eyes leveled with mine, as we saw each other fully for the first time in years. “I know.” She finally said, quietly. “That’s what I’ve been *saying*.”

\*\*\*

It was around 3:00 AM by the time everyone finally passed out. Arjun was the last to fall asleep as he kept insisting he wanted to “stand watch” with me, but I could tell he was losing the battle against the pain meds he’d taken. Finally, I watched him nod off from pure exhaustion.

“Finally, just me and you girl.” I whispered to Monroe. She wagged her tail gently.

The roof was quiet now. Occasionally, I’d hear the odd bang or scratch, but at least Monroe wasn’t growling anymore. Still, I wasn’t planning on leaving the room till morning. Until then it was just me, Monroe, the howling wind, and the letters.

And this *headache*. It twinged again, causing me to rub my temples furiously.

It probably didn’t help that I’d been staring at these letters for hours. I spread them out, feeling them hum underneath my hands. It was interesting how… ordinary they looked. They looked like pages torn from a small, lined notebook. Even the content was ordinary- I’d pored over the letters, reading and re-reading them, desperately hoping to find even the smallest of clues of where Daphne could possibly be. But the only thing inscribed was that weird, Grimm-knockoff fairytale.

>\[\[No**B**ody k***ne***w for sure ***wh***at was growing underneath the great forests and plains that covered the world th***ey*** lived in. T***he*** first recorded mention of the Great Something came in the form of a carved, rock ***ta***blet.\]\]

I frowned. I kept seeing this pattern over and over.

“There isn’t a code.” Louise had kept insisting, while she was still awake. “I would’ve found it by now.” I didn’t doubt her on that one. The Type-A genes ran strong in the Tiths family.

But then again: *there it was again.*

>\[\[They grew up on either side of the Ri**V**er of ***gih***on. One ***gro***wing up before the other, as time seemed to move slowly as it crossed from on***e ba***nk, to the ***oth***er.\]\]

It seemed so… random. Like it didn’t follow any code I’d seen before. Like any kid growing up in the late 90’s and early 20’s, I wanted to *be* Nancy Drew. I’d spent my hard-earned money on a bike, so I could sneak off to the library to read her books. After Paula disappeared, and I was dealing with the fallout, I used to spend entire weeks hiding out in the Mystery section.

I placed the first two letters side-by-side. *More bolded letters.* The letters seemed to concentrate in spots, and then fan outwards. I moved closer. With my nose mere inches from the paper at this point, I stared at the offending marks. “What do you *want*, Daphne?” I angrily huffed. “What does this *mean*?” The thing was- even though this didn’t feel like a code, I *knew I’d seen this goddamn somewhere*.

A bolt of pain shot through my brain. I winced. “Why couldn’t you have made this goddamn *easier*.” I placed the third letter next to the first two. *More bolded letters, fanning out*\-

I paused. My heart started to beat a little faster. *No way.*

I grabbed all the letters, crumpling them a little in my haste. Lining them up, they stretched from practically one side of the room, to the other. The bolded letters seemed to glow, like the black ink was absorbing the pale white-blue light. I crouched over them.

Then I saw it. “Oh my god.” I said, loudly, not caring who I woke up. “It’s *circles*. Like.. like goddamn ripples in water.” I could feel myself tearing up. “Or rings in a tree trump, or…” I paused. It suddenly hit me. I *knew* it.

“No way.” I said.

“Oh my fucking god.” I said again, this time louder. “This is a *fucking* map.”

\*\*\*

But not just any map. My hands flew to the pockets of Arjun’s blue robe where, after patting him down, I quickly pulled out his silver iPhone 11. Arjun could always be counted on to be within arm’s reach of his phone at all times. Even when being attacked by terrifying creatures from the woods. Shaking, I typed in his code.

“Aimee?” Arjun said, groggily. “What are you doing?” I’d knocked him a little too hard in my pursuit. He sat up on the bed, shaking his head. “Aim- is that… is that my phone?”

But I wasn’t paying attention to him. Suddenly, my heart stopped. “Oh my god.” I breathed. “I *knew it*.”

“*What* are you looking at?” He huffed, sounded annoyed. “Show *me*.” Shaking, I turned the phone around and reached up to show him. The screen brightened his face with a pale, white light. “Look,” I breathed. “That’s what’s hidden in these letters.” I tapped the screen. “It’s a *fucking* topographical map of Yosemite Valley.” He looked up at me, his expression unreadable. “Are you *sure*?”

“Pretty damn sure-” I started to say; when suddenly Arjun lunged forward, grabbing my arm. It *hurt*. “Ok Arjun, what the *fuck*\-” I tried to stand up, but Arjun suddenly yanked me back down. “*Shhhhh*\- *Aimee*.” He said urgently, his eyes were wide and terrified. “***Stop*** talking.” My heart seized in terror. “What is *it*, what do you-”

“Aimee,” Arjun said slowly, cutting me off. “What in the *fuck* is going on with your necklace?”

My heart stopped. I looked down. The silver locket, something I’d had since birth, was *floating*.

“Arjun, I said slowly. “What the *fuck* is going on?”

Suddenly, a bolt of white lightning shot through my brain. I clutched my temples, kneeling over in pain. It felt like my brain was being *torn apart* from the inside out. The headache, which had been quietly throbbing the entire night, suddenly boiled over and flooded my entire body.

“Nononono.” I moaned, my chest burning. My skin felt like it was on fire. I grabbed the nearby nightstand, trying to pull myself to my feet. I felt like a drunk, stumbling home after a bender. Arjun reached out, desperately trying to steady me. Suddenly, I felt the back of my neck burst open.

The locket, freed from the prison of my neck, shot forward.

And suddenly, like how Moses parted the Red Sea, the pain seeping from every pore in my brain was suddenly *gone*. As if something had *pushed it aside*. Gasping for air, I pulled myself up from where I’d fallen. With my eyes cleared, I looked up to see Arjun was crouched over the letters.

Arjun gestured to them. “Tell me Aimee. Where did it hit?”

I shuffled over, my legs threatening to give out at any second. I bent down. The letters were still *smoking* from where the locket had hit. Shaking, I pulled out Arjun’s phone. I paused for a moment, my fingers shaking as I scrolled.

“Sentinel Dome.” I said, my voice cracking. “Right next to Glacier Point. Right where-” But I paused, as the feeling of tears became overwhelming.

Arjun looked at me. “Right next to.. Where?” He said, urgently.

“It’s… it’s where Paula went missing.” Despair washed over me; it felt like I was sinking. It seized my throat, rendering me almost incapable of speech. But still something stirred inside me, just enough to loosen the manacles I’d placed upon myself.

“I guess..” I finally whispered. “I guess that’s where we’re going next.”

BUYER BEWARE, WORST EXPERIENCE EVER, DO NOT BUY FROM HAUSENAHUM

My bf Nate and me got engaged three years ago and were going to get married in 2020, but then the pandemic happened and I wasn't going to get married in a mask with like fifteen people there, so we decided to move the date up to 2022.

(Thaaanks to everyone who changed their plans!)

Anyway Nate's a big fraghead so I wanted to get him a fragrance by his favourite house Penhaligons. I chose one called Blasted Heath, but when I saw the prices I was like WTF!! I'm not made of money and even gray market was crazy expensive so i found housenahum on ebay and they were selling it for cheap.

They shipped quick but when I gave it to Nate he was disappointed *because it was a knockoff!!*

I felt like such an idiot and it spoiled the mood for the whole birthday. Nate and me even got into a fight :(

Ps The perfume doesn't even have a colour to it and there's not even a label on the bottle

UPDATE:

So I contacted housenahum and, get this, they told me what I got wasn't a knockoff because it's actually some "vintage" bottle of "eau de parfum" from late 19th century Massachusetts or something!! Unbelievable, like own up to the fact you sell knockofss!!

Like it just "happened" to have the same name...

UPDATE:

I think to make it up to me after our fight Nate agreed to try the perfume.

You know what? It didn't even have a smell at all. I think they sold us water in a bottle

Ps I guess the juice as Nate calls it does have a colour after all but you can only really call it a colour by analogy

UPDATE:

The skin where Nate sprayed the perfume has turned gray!!

UPDATE:

They just took Nate to the hospital! More and more of his skin turned gray almost dead and colourless, and the last time I saw him his lips were bulging like after a bee sting and his face was almost a parody of itself. I almost couldn't look at him. My lovely Nate, what have they done to you?

And housenahum won't answer me anymore.

The last thing I heard Nate say was that… the colour… it burns…

UPDATE:

They tied a towel over his face at the end because not even the nurses could look at him.

Then he convulsed, all alone on the other side of the glass, convulsed until he started saying something about the smell of flowers, until parts of him started turning to gray dust and then he was just a dead pile of them.

UPDATE:

None of the doctors can explain it.

Nate just isn't anymore.

There's not going to be a wedding now. Am I widow?

UPDATE:

I still have that bottle and sometimes I stare it until I see its colour. 

That colour…

Like something out of space...

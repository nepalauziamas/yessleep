Let me preface this by saying I understand not everyone believes in the same things I do, nor do many acknowledge the unseen entities that linger among us
I've been practicing 20 years and I assure you ghosts, daemons and the things that go bump in the night are very real.

I started down the pagan path at the age of 15 and learned and worked in a solitary sense for the first decade until witch social media became a thing. I was alarmed buy some of the terrible information I saw floating around so I started making pagan content and made some witchy friends and started transitioning from being a solitary practitioner to a professional.

My first witchy horror story takes us back two years, I had made a small group of witchy friends who all got together to read tarot, do spellwork and trade tips and tricks. While most of our witches in the group worked with the same deities and entities we had one friend "Annie" we will call her who while working with one of the common deities in the group also had a spirit around her named "freddy". We all assumed Freddy was a helpful guide much like our own spirits we worked with on the regular...

HE WAS NOT

( important side note all of our people in the group live in separate states and countries, we hang out via video chat)

We had been working together as a group doing some spell work and Tarot readings and noticed that our readings were not accurate, we also noticed that people within the group were fighting, 3 people became physically ill ( vomiting) and another was unable to breath 

several of the people in the group including myself are skilled mediums and were receiving conflicting messages. In an effort to set some boundaries and get a situation that was rapidly getting out of control back under control I shut down communication between the rest of the group and the entities we worked with. 
After about 20 min of digging, asking questions and casting protection I had a clear answer of where all of this was coming from, it was Annie.

We then started the process of binding Annie to prevent any more interference. All was going well until I received a phone call from Annie. While keeping my group video chat going I answer the phone and put Annie on speaker phone. 

Annie is sobbing, terrified and begging for my help. I live in Canada and Annie is in Florida there is no physical way for me to go and help my friend, but instead I listen to her sobbing in pain as she is being held down  and burnt by an entity she cannot see.

"MY BACK IS ON FIRE BAM!" Annie sobbed on the phone with me ( also Bam is my nickname). I yelled at Annie to get into the shower and turn on the cold water to stop the burning while I gathered every banishing herb I had. After several unsuccessful attempts we were finally able to banish " Freddy" out of Annie's direct space and thus making sure she was safe for the night.

The rest of the group broke off for the night all rather shaken by what we had seen the night before. Unfortunately this would not be our last run in with the entity we had come to know as Freddy.

Two days after our initial incident where Annie was attacked and I get a message from one of our group members. "Bam, Steve was in an accident at work and may have a broken collar bone". Immediately alarmed I called my friend to ask about the incident further and upon looking deeper Steve had seen a figure. That figure was Freddy at the same time another of our group was made sick, again it was Freddy.

We attempted our second banishing of this entity this time with guidance from my mentor. It was successful and slowly the negative effects this interaction had on us wore away for everyone but Annie. 

She had trusted this entity for so long to be betrayed and physically harmed, Freddy apologized and she welcomed him back into her space
Her life has spiraled out of control since, succumbing to substance abuse, job loss, home loss and jail time.
This entity Freddy is 100% feeding off of Annie and anyone who come near her, she has nothing left but Freddy and has sealed her fate. It's sad to say but even I cannot help her out of this mess. 

The last interaction I had with Freddy the demon happened about 3 months ago when I was paid by a client to purge the basement of their moms home because of a streak of bad fortune sweeping over the family.  This time while scanning over the home to see how big a job I had in front of me I was confronted by a familiar  face that admittedly terrified me, it was Freddy. 
I set up for my third battle with this demon and sent him along his way with an ease that seemed just too easy. 


My client and myself have had no further issues with Freddy the demon and Annie is slowly trying to get her life back order.

Moral of the story: Not believing won't protect you, demons are real and can destroy your life in a split second and always be careful if your speaking to unseen " friends" as they don't always end up being friendly.

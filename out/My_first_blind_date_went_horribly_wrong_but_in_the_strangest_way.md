I had just turned sixteen and my older friends had set me up on my first blind date with one of their mutual friends. I had never met this guy, but I trusted my friends judgement. We met up in a parking lot, I got in his car, and we went on our way. Our plans had changed when the restaurant we were going to eat at closed early, so in true Midwestern fashion we just went to the Waffle House. Surprisingly, we had a great time. 

After dinner we decided to drive around for awhile, and this is where things got weird… we probably drove about 40 minutes out of town, and we somehow ended up in the middle of a cornfield. I remember how silent everything felt, even with all the windows down, and the radio on, I couldn’t hear a thing. Then I spoke. The sound of my voice startled the both of us. I made a comment about how creepy this was, and he agreed but we couldn’t stop driving. I didn’t even think about leaving at this point. Looking back, my instincts should’ve been screaming to leave. I’m in a cornfield with a stranger, it’s only getting creepier, but for some reason I wasn’t in the slightest bit alarmed. It was like something was pulling us further into this maze, so we kept going. Then we saw it. 

In the center of this maze was a metallic rainbow array of lights. Spinning in mid air was this beautiful, mesmerizing beam of light, and it silenced every sound in the area. It was truly hypnotic. Attached to this beam were two sides of a sphere, but they were almost transparent in color. We couldn’t take our eyes off this thing, and before I knew it we were right next to it. Thankfully, the sound of the gravel beneath the truck snapped me back into reality. I heard the soft music from the radio again, and the sound of the wind outside my window. I looked at my date, and he was hunched over the steering wheel, locked into the same trance. His eyes were so blue they were almost white. I said his name, but he kept driving. I shook his arm and said “the road goes right under it! Are you trying to get us abducted”?! He shook himself straight, and he slowly pressed on the brakes. We looked into each other’s blue eyes, and all we could see was bright teal light. At the same time, we looked out the windshield once more. The moment we made eye contact with it again we were back in that trance, so without another word my date began driving again. The road had a curve at the end, and to the right hovered that craft. As we approached that turn, a dirt parking spot appeared to our left. We immediately turned into it, and the moment my date put his truck into reverse, everything went black. 

We were both in the process of turning around to look out the back window, but everything felt so slow. The next thing we knew, we were back in reality, simply staring out the back window. Then, in almost a blink of an eye, we watched the beam shoot off into the sky. Just as it turned into what appeared to be an ordinary star, it changed directions and finally dispersed into the sky. 

We looked into each other’s eyes, and they were normal again. With a sigh of relief we began backing out onto the gravel road, and it was then that I looked at the clock. HOURS had passed. I tried to recall the night but I couldn’t remember when we left in the first place. When was dinner again? Was this a normal amount of time? So many thoughts raced through my mind, but I couldn’t convince myself that I was right. No matter how hard I tried, I just couldn’t remember those important times. Did hours pass, or am I just second guessing myself? We drove all the way back into town in silence. I wondered if his mind raced like mine. The 40 minute drive felt like minutes, but before I knew it he was dropping me off. I finally spoke as I walked to my car, “get home safe”. 

We never spoke again. I’m not sure if it was the fear of speaking about it with him, or the caution of what would happen if we remembered those missing hours. Either way, I couldn’t bring myself to even think about it, and this lasted FOR YEARS. It’s not like I forgot about it, but I simply couldn’t bring myself to tell the story. Then, about 2 years later my date sent me a DM on Twitter, “hey, remember when we were almost abducted by aliens”? OH? SO IT WAS REAL? My mind was spinning. It happened. I can talk about it again. I’m not scared anymore. We were ALMOST taken, but we weren’t. I’m here, he’s here, and we’re both fine! So I began telling my story to friends when the topic of UFOS came up, and I could always relive that night like it was yesterday. But for some reason, I haven’t seen or spoken to that guy since then. 

My fear is this; what if we were abducted, and what if we were subconsciously forced to never communicate again? It makes sense the more I think about it. Why did we not say a single word the entire drive home? Why didn’t either of us tell our mutual friends right away? Why didn’t we see each other again, even after reconnecting years later? These questions keep me up at night. I am so curious it is almost driving me insane, so I’ve come up with a plan. 

I am going to see a hypnotist, and I am going to relive that night under their guidance. Although, I’m equally just as nervous, and unsure about that.. because if I were actually taken, do I really want to know what happened to me that night? I mean I’m safe right now. I’m alive today. Curiosity killed the cat you know? I’m not sure if it’s worth the risk of traumatizing myself like that.. I have a feeling that I already know the answer, but I’m dying to know more... Why did I encounter something like this in the first place? How did I snap out of that trance? Why can’t I remember those time slots? What the hell happened to me that night? But most importantly, do I really want to know?

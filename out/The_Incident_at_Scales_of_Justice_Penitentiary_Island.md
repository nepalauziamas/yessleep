  

60 MILES OFF THE COAST OF CALIFORNIA

“Lights out!” one of the guards barks.

From the top bunk, I look at my cellmate for the possibly last time. He is still awake, looking at a smuggled nude magazine for the umpteenth time. His flame red hair sways gently from his upright neck and head. His face is covered in scars like a kid’s scribble drawing. Dragon tattoos cover his arms like sleeves. A sweat and cum covered undershirt sticks to his solid barrel chest. His pants are torn apart and filled with more holes than a termite infested wood plank. Jake sets his porno down, gazing up at me from the lower bunk.

“Yo, Jake.” I whisper.

“Yes?” he replies in a baritone voice with an urban accent.

“I want to thank you for being good to me since I first came here. Keeping me alive from the gangs at the top of the totem, helping me avoid striking deals that would snare me if I tangled myself in them, and even teaching me how to search for fish to bet on.”

He grins at me, showing a tough but mutual smile. “No problem, Finnick. I’ve always taken a liking for family men, being one myself. I bet you miss your son and wife?” The somewhat gentle giant’s breath reeks of tobacco and booze. But compared to the BO smell of the rest of the prison, it was no worse than the scent of roses.

I nod. “Yeah. My final day here is almost up. In the morning, I’m a free man.”  
  Jake shakes his head. “It’s not that easy. You still owe me some stuff. For example, I need you to smuggle in a case of Bonesmoke 20 proof whiskey.”

I give him a frown. “Huh, you never told me that I owed you shit.”

“You haven’t been here long enough, but us prisoners like to exchange favors and we expect payment. However, I decided to tell you right before your release to make easier to remember. And you will get into less trouble with the law. I’ve got some workers that travel by boat. Like to disguise themselves as my high school kids, bringing in the goods during visiting hours.”

Jake turns away and faces the wall. I hear scribbling on a slip of paper. From one of the slits in the metal bed frame, he slides the message through. An address.

“Quick, hide it before the cameras catch us!” he whispers, flailing his arms in a frenzy. Obeying his instructions, I cram the address in my pocket and peer my head over the bunk once more.

“Is this operation risky? I still have an important career to keep up.”

Jake waves a hand dismissively. “Nah. Just don’t do anything stupid and you’ll be fine.”

“Ok, you got yourself a deal.” I say, stretching my hand from the top bunk to lower one to shake his.

“Oh, I also have one last request. Tell your boy I said hello. Treat him well, too. Hope he stays out of the hell that is the drug world.”

“See you in the morning, Jake.”

I roll myself to the back of the cool wall, wrapping myself in blankets rougher than sand.

\--

Two hours pass and I wake up hearing guard footsteps. “What was that? It’s fucking midnight. Shut up Jake.” I mutter, yawning.

Nonhuman clicking travels from the adjacent north cell.

My cellmate wakes up in a sweat. “The hell was that sound?” Jake whispers to me.

It’s probably another guy having a bad dream, I think to myself. That poor bastard. He’s probably going to get beaten up in the morning. When in prison, they learn the way things operate rather quickly; those who don’t are either mugged or killed. Odd noises in the night are perfectly normal, yet, my hair is still on end. 

Why are the pounds so unusual?

Sticking out through the silence like a hangnail is a sudden panicked voice.

“Joe? Are you alright?”

I press my face to the window of my cell, staring at the supposed source of the noise. One inmate presses his back against the nearest concrete wall like a cornered mouse in a snake enclosure. Milky fluid and blood spews and pops from the other inmate’s back, spewing and gushing out like magma from a volcano. A fountain of body fluids froth in the freakish wounds festering on his back. Fabric frays and shreds on the inmate’s midsection as the steaming fat around his gut triples in size. 

Skin starts to shrink revealing the tendons and muscles beneath. Tangerine shirt shreds float to the ground as if they were melting from the mutating and contorting inmate. 

Feral, watery droning noises thrum from a mouth already beginning to extend its edges to somewhere in a revolting smile. He crawls onto all fours like an animal, foaming and barring teeth like a rabid dog.

“*Joe?* *Joe?!*” the voice screams. Pale arms thin as vines bash the side of the wall, leaving behind a lattice of cracks.

“Oh shit! Guards! Get me out! Someone, get me the fuck out!” the inmate pounds at his cell, glancing back for a millisecond before punching the small glass frame. His hand throbs with each hit on the window.

Jake huddles close to me. My normally calm cellmate is tugging at his shirt collar. Three officers storm over to the commotion.

All the guards freeze. A humanoid barely large enough to fit into the cell grows until the edge of its dripping bloated stomach and the shivering inmate are the only things visible from the window. The lights flash on with the power of a vengeful angel descending on Gomorrah. Sensing threats, the creature morphs its pale skin to match its surroundings, camouflaging itself like a scared octopus.

“Don’t let that bastard out! Forget the inmate! Keep that monster inside!” A guard orders.

“Don’t listen to him!” the inmate pleads. 

Unseen forces throw the inmate around like a bratty child with a doll. Serpentine penumbras huddle around the crumpled body. “Please let me out! I’m begging you!”

Jake’s skin is eggshell white and as cold and damp as clay at the bottom of a river.

“Someone, help me!” the inmate sobs, curling into a fetal position. The inmate screams bloody murder as the creature lunges, feasting on him. Clothing, bones, and all are ripped apart. Blood coats the viewing window like fresh paint. Hearing the rapid slapping from its prey’s futile fighting makes me flinch back. We both hide under the window.

Without warning, the slab of steel and glass is snapped from its hinges like a starfish with an oyster. The creature rams into the door of our cell, leaving a massive dent.

Then, as quickly as the lights activated, a shroud of blackness swallows everything.

“Shit! There’s been a blackout!” someone says. “The maelstrom outside must have caused it. You guys keep watch for any monsters here!”

I cover my head with clammy hands. 

“Is this my punishment for my act of revenge?” I think. Frantic, hot breath hits chrome, leaving behind a layer of haze.

Then, an arrow of courage shoots through me. I get into a guard position, fists out, grabbing my toothbrush and snapping the handle off into a shank. 

I’m not going to die like this. 

I will not die like this. 

My 1-year sentence is up tomorrow. I need to see my wife and my son. 

No. I will not be weak. If I’m weak, I die. I clench a fist till my knuckles are white.

“Don’t let that thing escape!” Gunshots follow. The beast fades into opaque nothingness, emitting a liquid-filled screech. Murmurs sound through the corridors, slowly fading away like smoke from a campfire.

For mere moments, everything is quiet outside from the pacing of the wary officers. 

Jake pulls out a smuggled dull switch blade from his pocket. The oxides flake off like dandruff with his trembling hands. From his reaction to the inmate’s inexplicable transformation, it’s obvious that there might be more coming, soon.

I look at my hands, rubbing up and down my arms, trying to feel around for any spontaneous instances of wounds. Jake does the same thing, even taking off his shirt and examining his chest as if looking for mosquito bites. 

“Finnick, what the hell is going on?” he whispers, taking shelter under his bunk.

My mouth quivers. “I don’t have a clue.”

Another shriek comes from the east. “Troops, there’s another monster! Fire!” A guard bellows.

Jake holds out his weapon in front of his sweat coated face.

Out of the blue the creature barges through its metal caging like popcorn escaping a hard shell. Screaming and ricocheting bullets obliterate the now vanished silence as more inhuman sounds carry on. Eventually, the armies’ cries overtake the chaos like a choir of demons marking the ruins of an ancient civilization as new territory.

Jake’s glazed over eyes stare into my soul. Crawling out from his bunker, he touches an ear to the cell door. 

The gunshots abruptly stop, to my surprise. I can feel the heat from his head slip into his waterlogged shoes. His breath rattles. 

“Why are there no more gunshots? What’s going on out there?” he asks, shaking his head.

This cannot be normal. My heartbeat accelerates. “Did…they just massacre everyone outside?”

*Thump-thump.* *Thump-thump*. 

My cellmate’s teeth clatter. His head droops down like a dog scolded by its owner. He rests his fingers on the window’s edge and lifts his head reluctantly.

*“IT’S CHARGING THE DOOR!!!”* Jake yells. The silver door caves in with an ear-splitting crash. A pair of pale stringy appendages sweep the floor, searching for something to grab onto. Moist growling slips in from outside. We back up until our spines hit the farthest wall and our shoulders meet. 

Two more pairs of glistening and gangrenous hands barge in from the makeshift gap clawing at the air. I swallow a lump in my throat. One beast forces itself in further. A translucent head and torso thrash its way in, twisting the door even further open.

“*JAKE!*” I scream when cold hands clasp my leg. It lets out a gurgling roar, pulling me closer to it. My body twists around unexpectedly. I lose my orientation. Seconds later, the entire locking mechanism snaps in two, taking the door off its hinges. Bile rises from my stomach, covering my taste buds.

I shiv its thin arms, twisting the toothbrush into its skin, signaling Jake to make a run for it. The monster screeches in pain, thrashing around in a frenzy. I dart from the cell in a sprint fast enough to make an Olympian jealous.

A cone of light beams at an unconscious guard. Without thinking, I snatch the flashlight and shine the beam ahead to the right. I gag seeing two more pale figures tearing open the stomach of a deceased guard.

“Wait a minute!” Jake whispers. I slip, landing on my chest and clamber up when the monsters stop their meal and turn their heads to me, their greasy skin shimmering and matching the taupe gray concrete walls.

“We are going to need some men for this operation. Head to the cafeteria’s kitchen. We’ll meet there. Go!” The criminal fiddles with the keys of a corpse.

“What operation?”

Horrid phlegmy sounds bellow from unseen monsters.

“Horseshit.” I snarl. Continuing my sprint, I make a hard turn to the right, nearly colliding with the edge of the corridor. Air whizzes past me like water eroding a rock in a creek. A sign saying “cafeteria” flies past. Who knows why he wants me to head there? 

“Ohhhhhh…” I mouth. Weapons.

The ambience of the ravenous beasts forces me to run faster. I turn behind, seeing the shadows of invisible bodies galloping. Without a second thought, I throw my knife into the horde for a diversion. I don’t care. There are plenty of goods in the kitchen.

\--

Soon enough, the cell block yawned into a giant expanse filled with dull, metal tables. I climb on one of them, searching for any indication that the kitchen is near. Coldness stings my bare feet, matching in temperature with my cold sweat. The same hidden monsters continue giving chase. To the west, a metal sign engraved with the words “KITCHEN” shakes from the tremors of thunder. 

I purse my lips, pushing towards it and barging through the doors. Dropping to the ground away from the windows, I take cover behind a turned over table. I shut the flashlight off, hoping that the stampede would buzz off. Without making a sound, I shove an unhinged toolbox lid between the door handles and scurry back to my hiding place. 

Th-thump, th-thump, th-thump. The sound of bony hands against concrete twists my eardrums into knots. I turn an ear to the door. One of the creatures outside lets out a confused, hacking noise. The thumping of hands eventually goes away and I let out a sigh of relief. When the coast is clear, I relight my flashlight.

Blades, pots, pans, and knives glint off it, clinging together like haunted bells. Sinks lay silent, holding juice coated freezer hooks. Wrecked gas stoves fizzle with knobs ripped off. Those things must have destroyed the propane lines. Shining my light at the floor, I see the bodies of two maintenance workers lying in mangled heaps. Soaked oval bites cover their backs, dampening their shirts in red. Surrounding the area are teeth marks like that of a lamprey wound. A speck of light hits my eye, belonging to a red box lying next to one of them. I pry it from the dead man’s grip. It was a miracle that I could catch most of the tools before they could clang against the floor. A smile big enough to rival Cheshire cat’s forms on my lips. 

So, this is how we are going to defeat the monsters.

*Thump, thump, thump!*

“Huh?” I exclaim, aiming my torch at the doorway. The panel against the door falls off from the knocking.

“Hey boss, we got another one!” a man calls out, swinging the doors open.

“Hey! Who’s there?” I shout, stabbing the air with a wrench as big as a nightstick.

Someone puts a finger to my lips. Jake. “Simmer down, Foxy. I just brought some men for the operation. Oh yeah, we also called the swat team to get us the fuck out of this zoo of rabid dumbasses. Gonna infiltrate this tin can that they call a prison and finish off the beasts. They should arrive here in about an hour. I hate law enforcement’s fat, stinkin’ guts, but I’d rather be alive than monster chow.”

Five men fill the kitchen. The last one blocks the door shut, shoving a few chairs and trollies in front for good measure.

“The hell are you talking about? What is the meaning of this?”

A thug, covered in more ink on his skin than a mural, steps into the light. “Isn’t it obvious? We’re taking down the warden. You’re coming with us.”

My face scrunches. “The warden? I’m not a criminal! I don’t kill officers! Besides why the hell would you guys even care about the warden, anyway?  Shouldn’t ya’ll be trying to survive this hellhole?”

“Because those beasts slaughtered my friends here and justice must be served.” Jake grabs me by the collar. “Can it and pay attention if you want to live…” he sets me back down. I nod.

He lets out a smoker’s wheeze. “I don’t know about you, but the Big Cheese looks suspicious. He needs to be grated. I mean, his office was a former solitary confinement cell. Locks, deadbolts, the whole nine yards. With defenses like this, doesn’t he look like the culprit, mate?” My comrade chugs a bottle of smuggled 50 proof whiskey, gagging, and slapping his hand on his thigh. He strikes his chest to make the drink enter his stomach with ease.

“Still not convinced. So, what if his office is an unused cell?” I ask, folding my arms.

He sticks out two fingers, scarred beyond human comprehension, and gestures for the guy behind him, a shriveled Russian-American man in his 80’s, to sit down. “Take off your shirt, Vladimir.”

Star-shaped marks with tiny cream white dots mark his sides like a caldera with an extinct volcano in the center. Pinhead holes puncture the center of each jaundiced blemish. Smallpox scars. Each of the skin craters pack between the folds of his skin, more wrinkled than a raisin. 

“Years ago, one of the previous warden’s wanted to use me as a lab rat.” Vladimir croaks with a voice like sandpaper against a chalkboard. “He threw me into solitary confinement after I had gotten into a fight with a rival gang and wanted to ‘test the strength of my immune system to help the Yankees in Vietnam.’ For weeks, I was bleeding like crazy.” His teeth clench the moment the words leave his cracked mouth.

Jake turns back to me. “And that’s why I trust those fuckers much as I’d trust Nikita Khrushchev with nukes.” He pokes my chest. 

“But the warden hasn’t caused us any trouble. Sure, he’s strict as hell, but aren’t all COs supposed to act like that? At least he ain’t a dick!” I shrug, sitting back down.

“You’ll be fine. You will receive at most a slap on the wrist; after all, your crime was battery, right? Me, I sold lots and lots of tornado. I don’t have much left to lose, but I want to live.” My mate scans the kitchen and pulls out a cigarette, reducing it to ash in just two puffs. “Besides, you owe us. Code of the convicts must be followed.”

“For what?!” I thrust a hand on the concrete.

“Remember how we smuggled in that cake your son made for your birthday?” Jake crosses his arms.

“Yeah?”

“I know that the crime you committed was worthy of respect, but you’re not King John. You still must adhere to the rules. You want to see your son and wife again? Then do as I say.”

I lean over him, shouting. “You lay a finger on anyone in my family, you’re dead!”

“Quiet down, the monsters will hear you! As I was saying, all you must do is obey my orders and you will survive.”

“Like I said, I’m not looking for trouble!”

He rests a hand on his forehead. A sigh exits his lips. “Alright, Fox. You win. Let’s make a deal.” Plastic as warm as a litter of kittens lands on my lap. An officer’s walkie talkie. “If we come back for any weapons, you are to let us know if any beasts are in there with you. That’s all I ask. Take it or leave it.” Jake holds out a palm, lacerated with more bath salt lesions than hairs on his head.

Gazing my eyes to the ceiling, I stick out my hand, shaking his. I look at his cat-like eyes.

“Done.” The titan unclips another mike, pressing the button on the side.

“Testing, Do, Re, Mi, Fa, So, La, Ti, don’t drop the soap.” a voice crackles.

I nod.

“Anyway, our raid begins now. Stay safe, Finnick.” He pats my back in respect. When he gives the call, the rebels flood into the cafeteria like shoppers on Black Friday.

I wave them goodbye and remake the blockade. Pulses of light shimmer before fading away. Turning to the source, I see that it belonged to a shiny, sharp bread slicer still embedded in a pumpernickel loaf like Excalibur. The night black handle feels cool as Norway ice. I chuckle at the perfect weapon. Wrench in the left hand, knife in the right, I hold them out.

“Do your worst, you pale fucks!” I sneer.

\--

For several minutes, everything is silent. My hair stands on end when I hear the sudden thud of a body hitting the ground. Desperate pounding on the blockade’s door makes me jump. I back into a corner, away from the fizzing gas, putting my uniform over my mouth. Snapping bones clash with the hissing, making me press my back into the stiff metal drawers even harder. I can hear the horrified screams of inmates as they’re slaughtered by the beasts. Another flurry of slams sound at the opening. Wet handprints batter against the glass, shattering it into spider webs, magnifying the screams, increasing my shivers.

Five minutes later, silence crawls back into the room and wraps itself around the cafeteria. 

The vibrating mike breaks it. “Come in Finnick. This is Jake. All systems go?”

*Click.* “All clear. Have you found the Warden’s office yet?

“No, but I did find seventy more people willing to jo-“

Junk clatters. Gaps begin to widen in my only wall of defense. Another slam resonates. Steel piles continue to plateau. I bite my shirt, tasting the cotton, my tongue detecting the fibers fraying.

Eyes still locked on the avalanche of rubbish, I get on all fours, bear crawling far enough away, tools still by my side. 

“Finnick? *Finnick?!* What happened?!” Garbled shouting vomits from the walkie.

Propane fills my lungs, making me cough. I take in a large wad of shirt to shut my trap and back up. When the smell of gas vanishes and the banging stops, I tip toe backwards. Eventually, the commotion stops. I continue to back up until my spine hits a shelf of cutlery.

“Everything is fine. I think one of the creatures just charged in blindly. Thank God it didn’t detect me.”

“Good, just let me know if you get into trouble.”

Out of nowhere, my foot treads something sharp. Hot liquid begins to puddle around the sole. I force my eyes shut to ease my nerves, but quickly reconsider the decision. Who knows when the beasts will reveal themselves?

My breathing shakes along with my weapons. I gasp upon hearing one of the gurgles, seeing a wicked, toothy smile form on something. Blindly, I sprint up to the grinning fuck and jam my knife into it. A wet pop sounds when it hits its mark. I remove it from the wound, shocked at there being no reaction. With a sweaty hand, I gently slide my hand across the mark. Cold steel meets my grasp.

“Huh?” I say, realizing that the knife only punctured a drum of chunky, oatmeal textured fluid. Something clatters to the floor; turning around with the speed of a cheetah, I flash my only light source at the cause. I frown upon noticing that it was just a fallen pan.

“Alright, Fox. I’m just a handful of yards from the Warden’s office.” His voice makes the mike vibrate against the drum. I cover it with a palm to silence it.

I press my back against the gruel barrel and hold out my weapons. If those things can camouflage, then I must be careful. But at the same time, if either one of those tools wears out, I’m done for. Once again, I inspect my hands for any bizarre wounds popping out of nowhere. I wipe my forehead with a hand when nothing shows up, letting the sudden onset of stress evaporate away.

“Wait, why the hell is the Warden’s office door ripped off its hinges?” Jake says.

Something clinks and I point my hand to the source of the noise. A dropped fork.

“Did you find anything of interest, yet?” I ask.

Silence.

“Holy Shit!” Jake exclaims. “Jeez… I despise that fucker, but nobody deserves to have that happen to him.”

“Is the Warden dead?”

From the other end, I can hear Jake try to hold back the urge to gag. “The top of his head is gnawed off. His intestines are hanging out and scattered like blood sausages. His uniform is now nothing but crimson with patches of green. Don’t even get me started on the deep scratches and bites that one of those monsters left behind. I think I can touch his ribs from one of the wounds.”

A bit of vomit rises.  I swallow it back down.

“Hey, what’s this weird blood covered note?” Jake says.

“Don’t keep me in suspense. Read it.”

The faint sound of paper unfolding can be heard.

“’Experiment Log Number One. Date: July 8th, 2021. Test subject: Death row inmate 528491. Details: Inmate was administered \[redacted\] at 0500. Turned into desired \[redacted\] for future method of execution. Fed the subject human hand. No changes in behavior. Little does the poor bastard know that once it eats enough human flesh, its cells are engineered to self-detonate.’” Jake’s voice quivers. In the background, a few inmates are hollering in protest. Jake tells them to keep quiet.

I adjust my shirt. “Does it say how much it needs?”

The waving of paper can be heard in the background. 

“No, it doesn’t. I think it was slashed off.”

Clutter clatters near the freezer area. The sound of growling outside the hallway in the back makes me shine another beam at both sources in waves. Wet thuds begin to come closer to my location.

“Will you read faster?! My protection is gone from outside! Hurry up!” I plead.

“’Somehow, the subject learned how to blend in with its surroundings like a squid. Most likely an unexpected mutation. Further testing is needed to correct the flaw. July 9, 2021. We have recently found a mutation in one of the self-destruct genes, giving them an endless desire to consume human flesh without any limitations.”

A crash echoes from inside the radio’s mike.

“Jake, what’s going on back there?! What is next?” I whisper. Some screams burst out of the mike as the sound of snapping tendons grows.

“The rest of the document’s been torn off! There is nothing left!”

“Get out of there, Jake! Head to the bunker!” Footsteps hit the floor as Jake runs like hell. The screeching of creatures sounds faintly from the mike. Something thuds to the ground. Jake groans in pain.

“What the fuck are these things?!” someone screams. I can hear Jake drive a steel object into one of the creatures with a crack. Muffled bellows sound not long after. Garbled tearing and screaming rises from the mike until nothing but white noise comes out.

“*Jake? Jake!*” I snap into the mike. It’s dead.

Then, the doors burst open to the left. The silhouette of two arms, each as long as lampposts, slink into the room, surreptitiously tapping the floor. I get behind the gunk barrel, hiding myself. The creature begins to head in the opposite direction to me.

“Oh no…” I whimper, frantically trying to form words together for my next thought. “I need to get the hell out.”

When the creature has moved far enough, I sneak to the nearby door. Peering my head out the window, I shine a light to the left, only to be greeted by a form lumbering away from it. Sniffing, louder than air turbines, enters my ears from the other hallway. To the right, another nearly invisible creature lies on its bloated belly, sliding across the concrete, smelling the floor in my direction. I hold some air in. For unknown reasons, it hasn’t noticed me. With the stealth of a ninja, I shut the door, begging it not to squeak or click.

A light bulb goes off in my head. The freezer.

I speed walk away from the door, keeping low to the ground. Another beam of light pierces through the darkness, belonging to a meat cleaver. I take it, setting the knife down. More phlegmy growls resonate. I wheel my head around, spotting a shiny liquid substance floating in the air. Then, it descends back on the floor, trying to track my scent. Not losing eye contact, I graze my back against the shelves.

From my peripherals, I spot a tool box and gently pull it off. The sudden weight change causes me to pull forward and hit my head against the support with a bang.

My blood turns to ice when the creature reveals a sinister smile. The rest of its body is completely invisible. It tilts its head to the side to get a better look at me.

I throw the toolbox right at shimmering mass, smacking it right in the jaw before bolting to the freezer. When one of the arms tries to swipe at me, I give it a good slash with the meat cleaver.

*CRASH!* A handprint, larger than a basketball, is left behind from the smashed table. The creature opens its mouth, releasing a mucus-filled scream.

I throw the hatch open and jump inside, gathering any tools that fell and sprinting to the nearest corner of safety. My eyes meet with a coolant canister. With the force of a lumberjack felling a redwood, I swing at the valves and pipes, destroying them, shutting my eyes when the gas sprays out; I slam the door shut.

From the outside, one of the creatures shrieks in agony from the cold brew and rams into the final protection barrier. I back away as far as possible. My breath is shaking like a leaf in the wind.

I hear another crash from the outside. With one look, I grab slabs of meat and metal, seizing the door shut.

Another crash. The door begins to bend inward.

Another crash. Steaks, ribs, and shelves fall to the ground like rundown buildings being demolished.

Suddenly, the freezer door breaks off its hinges and hands with the strength of a bulldozer put me in a choke hold up against the back end of my haven. I shudder at the humanoid’s hot breath smelling of tooth decay and rotting meat. It sniffs my face in delight. All its body was hidden in darkness except for its slobbering mouth and the hand around my neck.

My lips force themselves to the lower corners of my jaw. Sweat continues to pool at my brow. Black saliva drips from its perpetual grin. Dimples stretch all the way to the top of its head beyond where the ears should be. Toothpick thin teeth jut out as it opens its mouth wide enough to swallow a watermelon whole.

Then, out of nowhere, rapid fire gunshots from assault rifles fly through the creature. It shields its face with a hand, quickly turning maroon with countless bullet holes. Seven swat men continue to infiltrate the unwelcome guest’s temporary hideout. The unknown monster lets out a shriek of agony and rage, leaping onto the nearest officer, clawing, and gnawing at its armor as if it were a nut in a parrot’s mouth. It tries to bite into the impenetrable helmet or get a good bite on the neck, only getting its thin teeth broken in response. The monster’s jaw begins to droop as grows weaker. With a pounce like that of a tiger, it leaps onto one last soldier, trying to get one final meal. Eventually, the creature’s legs and arms begin to give way, and it collapses onto the ground in a heap of limp skin and blubber.

I look at one of the ironclad soldiers.

“Are you alright, sir?” she says.

Touching my face in relief, a chuckle begins to bubble out of me. I look at my hands, searching for any wounds. My laugh grows even harder when I don’t find any.

\--

The incident at Scales of Justice Penitentiary Island happened months ago. The court trial destroyed me on the inside during its duration. Luckily, my lawyer was able to argue that it was an escape due to “dire circumstances.” So, all charges were dismissed and I was sent home to San Diego. Excitement pumped through my veins like morphine from all the rediscovered experiences I’d missed while in prison. From the comfort of an airline seat, to the taste of meat lover’s pizza, to the sound of Duran Duran on the radio. 

The government gave me a new fresh hoodie and a pair of jeans; they couldn’t leave a former criminal in the streets in his birthday suit, after all.

Although unexpected delays occurred and I was given a hotel to stay in, I couldn’t care less. When I finally checked into the hotel during a rainy night, I immediately picked up the nearest phone, and called my wife and kid, setting their distraught minds at ease, letting them know that Dad was going to be fine despite the incident at the prison. After giving them one last ‘I love you’ to them, I headed towards the bathroom. The desire to take a hot shower after days of enduring Arctic cold water in the locker rooms was refreshing. I didn’t need to worry about getting raped, nor worry about getting rat-tailed by thugs looking for a pussy to beat up. A smile remained on my face during that awesome experience.

It quickly disappeared like a ghost when another blackout occurred, sucking the heat away from the water and leaving my carcass to freeze. A sharp blow hit my chest, almost resembling a heart attack in pain. I began to clutch it, rubbing the fresh wound for any damage. Small streams of blood stained the plastic bathtub. The pain continued to rise like the temperature of the sun until I couldn’t stand it any longer, and I began screaming. 

And then the transformation began.

I was lucky that a group of animal control units were staying the night and were able to tranquilize me. Before I knew it, I was in some containment cage lined with glass two yards thick. I don’t know how, but the scientists seem to communicate to me via telepathic machinery on the ceiling. Due to contamination risks, they won’t allow anyone outside of authorized personnel to see me. It was a miracle that I could still communicate with my family through the same system. I asked the scientists why the police couldn’t save the other transformed people at the prison. They replied that there wasn’t enough time to save everyone and the case was too widespread to contain and treat. The scientists promised that they would find a way to reverse the transformation soon enough. Until then, it looks like I’ve transferred from one prison to another.

Ok so, the internet isn't the best here, in the middle of nowhere. I'm getting creeped out the more I stay here. I can't leave, either because it's in the middle of the woods. 

To start this off, I'll tell you how I got here. I'd just finished highschool, and before I go to college, I decided to make sure I didn't go very far into debt after college. So I went job hunting. I tried applying to work at fast-food restaurants, to work as a dog groomer, and many other jobs. So after a few hours of looking for jobs, I went outside to get some air, that when I saw a flyer that caught my eye. It had big letters that said "APPLY TODAY!". I picked up the flyer from the ground, reading it. "APPLY TODAY! CAMP COUNSELOR NEEDED!" It had a website on it, probably where I could apply.

 I rushed home, excited to finally find a job I might like. When I was younger, I never got to go to camp. My mom always told me "Maybe next year". Now that I was on my own, I had a shot at experiencing what camp would be like, even if I wasn't a camper there. I was a few blocks away from home when my phone suddenly rang in my shorts pocket. I grabbed it quickly, wondering if one of the job employers had called back. I picked up and  I heard someone on the other side say, "You're hired". I was confused, they haven't even introduced themselves to me, which was strange. 

"Who is this?" I replied. No response. I waited for a few minutes before I decided to hang up. Just as I was about to press the hang up button, they spoke again. "You've been hired as a camp counselor at Camp Junefire. Get to xxxxx Avenue. Pack some bags and be there at 5:30." This shocked me, as I hadn't even applied yet. "How did you-" They hung up, and I rushed home to pack my bags, feeling a bit creeped out about how they knew I was going to apply to their job, but I wasn't going to pass up this opposite to make some money. This introduction as to how I got here is getting a bit long, so I'm cutting it short. I got on the bus with a bunch of other people, presumably employees. I slept through the ride, and arrived there.

When I got to the campsite, a man greeted us. He was tall, around 6 feet. He had black hair and was wearing cargo shorts and a brown shirt that has white letters on it with the camp name. Camp Junefire.

"Welcome Counselors! Go inside to the campsite after taking the paper I hand you, and go to the cabin that is stated on the paper." He smiled, handed me a paper and moved on to the next person. I went inside to the the area, where I saw an area with 4 cabins in a circle and a campfire in the middle. I looked down at the paper, looking for the cabin name. "Cabin Quest." I looked up,  and saw the name in big, purple letters. I walked inside to see a boy sitting on a bed. "Uhm... Hello?" I waved hello to him. He had brown hair that fades into pink at the ends, his hair down, covering his face as he looked down.

He didn't answer me as I set down my bags in the counselor area, and I sat down on a chair to read the paper. It had a set of rules on it. Here are the rules.

1: Always make sure to remember the camper's names.
If you ask someone for their name, always make sure it's the same as when they told you. 

2: Always remember their faces. If you see a new face at the end of the day, tell us at Cabin Hornwall.

These rules were absurd and got even weirder the more I read, yet I had a feeling deep down I should follow them.

3: If you see a deer in the woods, immediately get Jericho to shoo it away. They aren't native to this area.

4: Only use the phones you have on you. If you see a random phone that isn't yours, don't touch it. 

5: If you see a dove flying around, immediately shoot it down, or get something to kill it. Whatever you do, don't let it live. They aren't native to this area.

6: If you see a new camper that wasn't here when we originally brought them, tell them you will introduce them to Jericho. This will scare them away.

7: If you hear tapping outside of the window, look outside to see if it's a bear. If not, do not panic. grab the shotgun from the chest in the bathroom, and stay awake until the sun rises. 

8: Never answer to the counselor called "Mya". Any order she gives you will not end well. 

9: If you see a bear with missing features, such as a snout or leg or arm, run. 

10: (Please listen to this rule, it could save your life.)
If you hear someone shout out 059, shout for Jericho.
If you also see a man with a tattoo of the numbers 059 on his arm, also shout for Jericho.

11: If you start seeing dead bodies everywhere and the world looking weird, follow these instructions exactly. Cover your eyes, hold your breath, and then sit on the ground with your legs crossed. If you hear laughing, ignore it and stay in this position. You should hear a bell ringing as an indicator you're back to our world.

12: Get all campers in bed at 9:30.

13: Lock the door to the cabin if you're not going to go outside. Be inside at around 10:45. It is safe to go outside when the sun starts to rise.



Weird rules right? Then on the back, it had a picture of Jericho, the boy who was sitting in the cabin with me.

"Did you finish reading the rules?" Jericho got up from his bed and stared at me. I replied, trying to not sound creeped out. "Yea I did, but what is 059?" Jericho gave me a glare that told me not to ask further. 

Guys I should probably hurry this up, I think I broke rule #5. It's night out and I'm getting creeped out. Something's chasing me.

At the end of the day, the rest of the campers in Cabin Quest. I learned their names. Zion, Jack, Gabriel, Henry, Benny, and Will. I saw a dove while I was out of the cabin, sitting near the campfire that was lit. I saw it, but I didn't see anything that was high enough to knock it out of the air, or heavy enough to kill it. I pulled out my phone and started it play stupid games on it when I looked up and saw someone that scared me. 

It was a humanoid figure. It's arm was all twisted and bloody, it's neck twisted and stretched upwards. It's legs were seemingly broken, and twisted in opposite directions. I can't remember what it looked like fully before it started chasing me. One notable think about it was that it had tears on it's skin, like it was hit with an axe. It also had a huge claw. I got up and and started running, and it chased after me. I don't even know how it could chase after me up the hiking trail, it didn't even have feet. At the end of it's legs, was a point. Like a spike. Like it's legs were huge spikes. I tried screaming for help, but that made it angrier. Whenever I should, the eerie smile it had contorted into an ugly, disgusting frown. Think of the flesh around your mouth twisting till it was upside down, literally turning your smile into a frown. The eyes it had were creepy too. Where it's eyes should be, were large, glowing, orbs. I'm scared.

 I also saw a bear missing a snout, it's eyes missing, too. I tried moving out of the bush, but it turned to my direction. I'm holding my breath right now. That thing is also here, in this area. I can see it floating around, looking for me. It's neck can stretch around the trees and bushes, and it almost found me if I didn't jump into the bush right before it turned around a tree. My legs hurts from jumping a bunch of feet down into a bush. The bear keeps making these weird screeching noises. Think of a high pitched roaring. I'm scared. I'll update you guys when it gets lighter out.

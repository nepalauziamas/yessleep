SERVICE DISRUPTION. AS PART OF THE EMERGENCY ALERT SYSTEM. THIS IS NOT A TEST. CLASSIFIED* HAS BEEN CONTAINED. WE INTERRUPT WE INTERRUPT WE INTERRUPT UNLOCK ALL DOORS. IF THERE IS A KNOCK AT YOUR DOOR IT IS VITAL THAT YOU LET THEM IN.

The knocking hasn’t stopped. I can recite the emergency broadcast system message in my sleep as it continues on. I don’t want to leave the living room as the shadow against the frosted glass lingers and knocks. Why hasn’t the rain stopped?

I keep my phone on a charge under the blankets and under the couch if by some miracle I hear from my parents or someone from the outside world. The voice is the only companion that I have right now, aside from the knocking that won’t stop. It’s the same pattern, level every time, ingrained in the wood of the door and in my brain. My phone won't update with the date or time, just blaring the emergency alert. I figure cell coverage or the towers are having issues.

The power comes back on in waves, when the storm gets worse, and the knocking gets louder. I’ve become accustomed to lying on the floor and avoiding the windows in case more shadows or people come to the door. No one has been by, not even more police officers to check on their fallen person. The lights still shine out of the window, and the coppery stench of blood lingers, overpowering the smell of the rain.

The house is cold, even though I have nothing to compare it as I haven’t been outside for the last two days now. I slide myself into the kitchen from the living room to eat from the pantry, food surely spoiled inside of the refrigerator when the power goes out. I leave the pantry door open as opening and closing it every time makes me think it’s too loud and what is outside will know that I’m in here.

Knock, knock, knock.

LET THEM IN

Knock, knock, knock.

LET THEM IN

Somedays it feels like the knocking is coming from all directions, from all the other closed doors in the house. Some nights when the knocking has been ingrained in my head throughout the I’ve been awake, I sneak to the kitchen and bathroom, just across from the living room. I don’t dare stand any higher than on my knees, the cold, hard tile floor piercing into my knees.

Most of the time I just sleep, nothing more to do when lying on the floor under a blanket, the paranoia thoughts inside my head competing with the knocking. I miss my parents, and my heart tears for the person who was supposedly killed outside the front door. What would have been different if I had opened the door? If I had let them in-

Suddenly I awake just as dream was becoming more perverse. The knocking is gone, my phone is quiet as it rests under a couch cushion

I don’t move, my breath barely a whisper. I have two blankets covering me from head to toe, and the air constricts, the blanket suddenly feeling like fifty pounds on top of me. My heart was pounding through my ears like bass at a concert, and my skin was sweating.

My phone vibrated, once. No voice, no emergency alert. I took a few breaths and turned towards the couch under the blanket, my hand shaking as I slid my phone out from the cushion. A text message lit up, the words not registering in my brain as I read the words “Mom”.

“Hi honey, I hope you’re doing well at home. We just made it home and we’ll be inside soon. Please unlock the door so we can get our stuff in.”

Tears welled in my eyes, and I squeezed my eyes shut as I stifled a sob. I shot up from under the blanket to the sun peeking through the frosted glass and curtains. I smiled and stumbled while making my way over to the front door and my hand touched the doorknob. I felt my phone buzz in my hand, and I looked at it momentarily.

“Please let us in, honey.” I scoffed at her hurriedness and looked through the glass to try and see her face. My hand paused on the doorknob, my thumb on the lock ready to turn it. I couldn’t see my parent’s car in the driveway, nor their silhouettes standing on the front porch. I suddenly remembered the police person that was killed and peered down to see nothing, no streaks of blood, nobody on the porch. No evidence that anything had happened. Did someone come in through the night to take care of it?

I got a nauseous feeling in my stomach, and painful bloating that made me wince. Something didn’t feel right, and I had a feeling this was another test that I was about to fail. My phone vibrated again, this time in the pattern that someone was calling me. I looked down to see my mother’s name calling. I wanted to answer the call so badly, to hear my mother’s voice, to be comforted that she was alright, but with the text messages and pain in my stomach, I couldn’t bear to do it.

The phone went to voicemail, and I was relieved that I didn’t have to decide right then. Until it became to ring again, but it almost felt more frantic, like the vibration was faster and trying to scream at me. I scrambled to turn the vibration off, leaning against the front door with my back. A voice made me drop the phone and gasp.

“Hello??” I sank to the floor, my knees to my chest. It was my mom’s voice.

“Mom?” I faintly said, either to the phone or the walls around me. I couldn’t tell where it was coming from as my heartbeat pounded.

“Oh, it’s so good to hear from you, honey. Are you inside the house?” I choked down another sob.

“Mom, are you okay?” I said back out loud.

“Of course, honey. We’ve been outside waiting, can you let us in?” My eyes glued to the phone as something was off again. Something was not right. “We’ve got our suitcases and stuff with us, please open the door.”

“Mom…” I paused and the phone responded as if it were hearing the voice directly inside my head.

“Honey, please. Stop fooling around and open the door.” Tears silently fell from my eyes as the voice became irritated. “NOW!” I flinched as the voice became consistently more shrill. The vibrating came back, becoming faster with the voice.

“HONEY. OPEN THE DOOR. LET US IN.” I began to cry loudly, the phone screaming back at me in an unfamiliar voice, the warmth and disguise of my mother’s tone gone. Then, silence again. I was a blubbering mess, my breath littered with hiccups and tears streaming down my face. Then, a knock on the door behind me startled me. It was the same knock that I had been hearing for the past two days. Same rhythm, same decibel. 

“STOP!” I yelled, clenching my ears in my hands and squeezing my eyes shut. The knocking stopped promptly, and the phone quieted. I leaned my head back against the door and peered through the flood of tears. The sunshine gleamed through the windows, almost seeming more like a harsh beam of a flashlight than a ray of soft yellow light.

“What do you want from me?” I whimpered out loud, my voice barely above a whisper. As if on cue, the shadow returned to loom over glass, and seem to mimic my position, leaning it’s head against the door. Looking down at me. 

The emergency alert softly beeped from my phone as the robotic voice began to speak again.

“LET THEM IN.” I sighed and closed my eyes, only for them to be ripped open again seconds later.

“Honey. Let them in.” My mother’s voice spoke out again from the phone. I looked over at it to see the screen lit up, the background just a white light. 

“Let them in, honey.” My father’s voice then called out from the phone, and almost forgot about the figure at the door, likely watching me. I couldn’t keep my eyes off of my phone as it continued to cycle through voices, contacts that I’ve had on my phone. Was it going through everyone? Everyone I’ve ever spoken to?

As it continued to repeat the message through different voices, I realized that the persons on the other end were anyone who I’ve spoke on the phone with. Family members, coworkers, businesses whose employee’s voices I recognized, all repeating “LET THEM IN.” Some of the voices I was sure had never uttered those words to me in a conversation, and they sounded patchy when enunciating it, but it was still clear when it began to cycle through.

Some voices I couldn’t quite pinpoint, but I recognized them. From where? How was it getting so many different voices to me? I buried my head in my knees and clasped my hands over my head as the voice where overlapping, some louder and clearer than others. My body became rigid as I realized the phone was speaking through every single voice that had passed through its speaker; phone calls, music lyrics, voicemails, videos, any piece of audio that it currently possessed it was using.

It was screaming frantically, all the same sentence, at the same tone:

LET THEM IN LET THEM LET THEM IN LET THEM IN LET THEM IN

I reached over to my phone to pick it up and I gave it a good throw across the room, the screaming wailing as if the phone itself felt the pain.

LET THEM IN LET THEM IN LET THEM IN LET THEM IN LET THEM IN

I started screaming as well, shutting my eyes and screaming until my throat ran dry and the blood vessels around my started pounding. Was it possible to die from an overload of a sense? I couldn’t hear myself think, feel or move off of the floor.

Then silence.

It infiltrated my ears, and I was sudden hypersensitive to any noise, any movement. I looked up and behind me to see the shadow in the glass still standing there, still waiting. The sun was shining, no evidence of a storm happening just a few seconds ago or ever in the last few days. I turned towards the door, towards the unmoving shadow.

“MAKE IT STOP!” I yelled at it, spraying the words like a weapon all over the door. “Just kill me, please. Stop torturing me. I can’t take it!” I said the last words with a movement of my arm, and the shadow suddenly moved from the door. With a newfound sense of courage, I stood up and looked out of the glass, the outside world seemingly undisturbed. The sun was shining, scattering rainbows on my skin and the warmth seemed like a comfort.

My phone whispered from across the room, but loud enough for me to hear.

“We are here to help.” It was the robotic emergency alert voice, even though it displayed no show of emotion in the tone. I was tired of being scared, tired of being screamed at by something I hadn't even come face to face with. I whipped around and glared at my phone.

“I don't need your help. I'm fine by myself." I said staunchly, standing my ground.

“Let us in. We are here to help.” The message repeated, but without the urgency, without the screaming. My eyelids flickered as I was growing increasingly frustrated.

“Just tell me.” As soon as the last words feel from my lips, the shadow figure appeared in front of the glass, causing me to flinch slightly, but I started walking towards the door, intent on seeing what was talking to me.

“Yes. Let. Us. In.” The voice coming from my phone was more insistent this time, and I furrowed my brow as I peered through the door. “LET THEM IN!” The phone screeched and I peered through the glass, the sun reflecting on the glass blurred my view slightly. The door knob jiggled on the other side.

My eyes finally were able to focus through the shining light. It was a person in a police uniform, fumbling with the lock. In the street I could see a couple of police car parked along the street, other officers coming in and out of my neighbors houses. The police car parked in our driveway had something resting on the hood, and was dotted with something dark. Dirt that seemed to be mixed with something copper or red.

The doorknob was still rattling, shaking me out of my gaze and my fingers latched on to it to keep it from shaking any further. The police person stopped and began to push on it, using the force of their own weight against the door. the head facing down so the cap was covering the face. I gasped as they took a hard shove and the wood from the door creaked.

The figure slowly lifted its head to show an older man, with glassy, red eyes, short nose and thin lips. My hand tightly grasped the knob for balance, and the man's eyes flickered to it before turning to stare back at me. He didn't blink. He approached the glass until his face was pressing into it, his cap falling like he wanted a closer look at me. I could see his lips, dry and cracking, and they started to bleed as he smiled. The blood from the top of his lip dripped into his gums and teeth, painting them red.

My palms began to sweat, and slipped off the doorknob as it continued to rattle. The man's face was pressed so far into the glass I thought it was going to shatter under the pressure he was putting against it, the blood from his lips painting a crimson on the glass. His nose though, how could he breathe like that?

The sun seemed to shine unnervingly bright, and as I squinted my eyes to see the man pressing his face so hard into the glass that there was a dull cracking sounds. I flinched at the sound, turning my head ready to feel glass shards all over me. When I turned back around, the man had a rush of blood flowing down his face from his nose.

He backed up a few steps from the door and cupped his hands to pool the blood for a few seconds before closing his eyes and smearing it all over his face and hair, the smile unwavering. When he opened his eyes, the whites of them popped like it was just muscle showing instead of skin, and I could feel my knees buckling to the floor. I looked up to see his finger along the glass, painting letters with the blood, soft wiping noises as he went.

I crawled backwards on my feet as I began to make out the backwards letters, my jaw trembling trying to let out a scream. 

"LET THEM IN"

The fingered lowered from the door, and I yelped as I heard more soft noises coming from the window in the kitchen just a few feet adjacent to the front door. The noises of the writing on the glass all I could hear. I could see his shadow moving along the window as he wrote:

"WE ARE HERE TO HELP"

3/9/22

I’m sorry it’s been so long since my last post, I haven’t had a chance to write out an account for my last day at Jacksonville Middle. I’m finally across the border now, though, so I think I’m safe for the time being. I’m lucky this motel had internet.

Anyways, we’ll get to that presently. Welcome to my record of Karabasan’s ascension. If you haven’t been following along, I’d recommend [starting at the beginning.](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/spndia/i_got_a_job_as_a_middle_school_therapist_the/)

**“Thomas!”** Karabasan exclaimed as I settled into my now familiar chair, floating in the endless void. **“What a lovely surprise! I was beginning to think you’d found a way to evade me after all, and I must say, I would’ve been very impressed.”**

“Yeah, yeah,” I grumbled. This was the tricky part, now, not revealing that we knew. I had hoped the demon had disappeared from my head for good, presumably busy with his plans for world domination, but I had hoped in vain. “I’ve missed you too, buddy.”

**“Where have you been?”** Karabasan asked, leaning forward, apparently greatly interested in my excursions.

“The catacombs,” I grunted, picking up the steaming cup of tea from the end table and sniffing it. It smelled vaguely chamomile-ish. Fitting, I supposed, for a dream demon. I set it back down.

**“The catacombs!”** Karabasan grinned. **“Find anything… interesting… down there?”**

“If you’re referring to the body of Mr. Richardson,” I said flatly, “No.”

The demon slumped back into his seat. **“Oh. Pity. I had my agents track your process, but we lost you two at a few junctions when those beasts from Subterra showed up.”** His expression twisted into one of digust. **“Those interfering monsters have no business existing beneath my school, but alas, I am powerless to stop them.”** He glanced slyly at me. **“For now.”**

“Yeah, yeah,” I waved away his bait. I wouldn’t rise to the occasion, mainly because in doing so I might reveal something I shouldn’t know. “Anyways, where have you been these past few days? You haven’t been popping in my head for nightly chats.”

**“Well, that’s no fault of mine,”** Karabasan looked hurt I suggested that it was him who had left. **“In case you’ve forgotten already, it was** ***you*** **who went galivanting around with Subterran creatures, not me. It’s not my fault the taint of the lower realms was on you so much I didn’t want to poke my nose in your head.”**

I frowned. “But… I went into the catacombs today, not just lurked outside of them for a few hours. Shouldn’t, then, the ‘taint of Subterra’ be on me even stronger?”

Karabasan smirked. **“Whoops. Caught me. Yes, you reek of the third realm. However, this was a chance I just couldn’t pass up. You know me. I’m the gloating type.”**

*The night before his ascension,* I thought. *Makes sense, I suppose.* “Oh, yes, I’m well aware. What is it you come to gloat about, then? Your vague threats of doom and tyranny?”

The smile stretched wider, and for a second, I caught a glimpse of the shifting, shadowy, grinning creature he truly was. **“Oh, no, Thomas. No no no no no, you’ve got it all backwards. I’m not here to gloat about my ascendance, which is tomorrow, by the way. But… you already know that, don’t you?”**

I gave a start. *What? How?* “Ummm… what?”

**“Oh, Thomas, you foolish, foolish boy,”** Karabasan smiled, a predatory smile that told you he had you right where he wanted you. **“There are reasons people don’t let demons in their head. For example, they like their memories to remain private.”**

*No. No, it couldn’t be…* “You’re lying,” I said. “The poltergeist must have heard us by the entrance to the catacombs and told you.”

**“Then how do I know about Wayne’s plan to flood the school with smelling salts and REM blocking gas? Did you see any ghosts hanging out in the maintenance closet?”** The grin stretched wide across the pale face. **“Or, perhaps if that still doesn’t convince you, could a ghost have told me that your favorite pizza in sixth grade was actually cheese pizza, but you said meat lovers because that was all your friend’s favorite?”**

“No…” I said, horrified of the implication. He *had* been reading my memories! “You’ve been reading my thoughts all along, haven’t you? You’ve just been using me! I was just another one of your agents!”

**“Correct, my boy,”** Karabasan took a noisy slurp of tea. **“And a wonderfully effective one, I might add. Though I can only look into your thoughts here. In fact, if it wasn’t for you, I would’ve had no idea of your neat little plan to stop me,”** He chuckled, flinging the cup of tea off the edge of the platform. It fell downwards into the starry void, and I watched it grow smaller and smaller until it was out of sight. **“In fact, it might have even worked, if only you had listened to Wayne when he told you not to use my name. What did you think you were doing, throwing it around like that? Was it an act of defiance, like using Voldemort’s in those beloved Harry Potter books of yours?”** He leaned forward. **“As you ought to remember, saying his name only got them caught in the end, didn’t it?”**

My face had grown progressively paler throughout his spiel until it almost matched his. It was over. I’d blown it. Wayne was in terrible danger. We all were. The terrible reality of what I’d done was setting in.

The cup fell from the darkness above and shattered on the floor.

A phone began to ring.

**“Better wake up and check that,”** Karabasan said, winking at me. **“It could be important.”**

I woke with a start, snapping upright and drenched in sweat. My cell was ringing. It was Wayne.

I answered it, my fingers shaking. “Wayne!” I croaked. “Something awful’s happened!”

“I’ll say,” His gruff voice came through, distorted. “Gadson’s escaped confinement. The demon still has plans for him, apparently.”

“No, this is worse—” He cut me off before I could finish.

“Listen, son, I’m worried Gadson’s going to show up at the school. I’ll leave my lightning gun in your office, got it? Use it and guard the HVAC if he shows his sorry face there.”

“Ok, thanks, Wayne, but listen—”

“Gotta go, O’Keen. We’ll talk tomorrow, okay?”

“But—” There was a click. He’d hung up.

My heart hammered in my chest. Karabasan knew. He *knew.* He’d broken Gadson out of confinement, wherever the heck that even was, and he knew of our plan to gas the school, and Wayne didn’t know he knew.

Oh, God. What had I done?

&#x200B;

I didn’t get any more sleep. I couldn’t. I paced my room, my mind racing. What was his plan? Destroy the HVAC unit? That seemed like the most obvious move. But what about Wayne? Might he try to ambush him and destroy the gas? Doubtful, especially since his last failed attempt to take Wayne out of the picture was so fresh in our minds. Perhaps Gadson was already at the school, tearing apart the only device that could save us all, and here I was, sitting uselessly in my room. Finally, I got around and dressed after two hours of worrying and trying in vain to get back in touch with Wayne. He must’ve had his phone on silent.

Eventually the sun peeked over the horizon. My clock showed 6:32. I jumped up from my chair, my clothes rumpled. I had started to nod off. I grabbed a notepad and pen and started composing a note to my parents, who were presently sleeping downstairs, unaware that the world was about to irrevocably change. In hastily written scrawl, I briefly explained the situation and asked them to trust me and leave town, to get in their car and drive as far away as possible. I taped it to their door, guzzled some orange juice, grabbed a granola bar, and rushed out the door. It was nearly 7. I might be late.

I tore out of the driveway and then proceeded to engage in some of the most reckless driving I’d done since my teenage years, screeching to a halt in my usual parking spot at a little less than a quarter past. I jumped from the car, running inside, and nearly threw my office door off its hinges in my haste. Sitting on my desk was the snub nosed, sleek black gun that Wayne had used so effectively against Gadson last weekend, along with a small sticky note on how to operate it. I grabbed the gun, scanned the note, and sprinted down the stairs to the HVAC unit.

I skidded to a stop outside the maintenance closet, which, thankfully, was undisturbed. Gadson was nowhere in sight, and there weren’t any obvious signs of forced entry on the doors. I found a vent and put my hand to it, breathing a sigh of relief when I felt cool air against my skin, telling me the A/C still worked. Leaning against the basement wall, I fished my phone out of my pocket and sent out a mass email to all the students I had appointments with today, cancelling our meetings, citing ‘organizing my records’ as the reason why.

The clock ticked closer to the start of school. I stood guard over the double doors, clutching my gun in trembling hands, expecting Gadson to pop into view at any second. The bell signifying the start of school rang, and a few minutes later Jacob tromped down the stairs, sword in hand.

“Skipping class today?” I raised an eyebrow, trying to keep my anxiety from showing. I would have to tell him what happened.

“Figured saving the school was a valid excuse,” Jacob grinned. “I see you have a new toy. Anything exciting happened yet?”

I took a deep breath. “Well…”

“What’s wrong?” Jacob frowned, noticing my concern.

“Well… Karabasan… he, uh, knows. About our plan.”

“*What?”*

“He’s in my head, okay? He has access to memories, apparently. He knows about our plan to gas the school,” My voice grew progressively weaker. Jacob just stared at me, his mouth hanging open.

“How did this happen?” Jacob demanded. “How long has this been happening? And most of all, does Wayne know?”

“Apparently saying his name too much grants him access into your mind,” I hung my head, sighing. “It’s been that way ever since the MAOIs blocked him from my dreams. And no, Wayne doesn’t know. I thought it was harmless! He was powerless in NREM. How was I supposed to know he had my whole life laid out before him?”

Jacob ran a hand through his hair. “Any *other* important bombshells you want to drop on me now, while I’m unbalanced?”

“Oh, and Gadson’s free.”

“*WHAT??”*

“That one’s not my fault!” I protested. “I had nothing to do with that!”

“It doesn’t matter at this point,” Jacob took up position beside me, sword ready. “Gadson will be coming for the HVAC unit. He’ll want to destroy it, any means necessary.”

We stood there, waiting, watching for any sign of our enemy.

The hours passed slowly. Above us, there was the usual shuffling of feet as students changed class periods.

Lunch came and went. We ate our prepacked lunches. I had a sandwich. Jacob had some pasta. Still there was no sign of Gadson. Neither did we receive any word from Wayne.

“Where is he?” Jacob growled. “He said he’d have the cannisters by noon! At the latest!” He glared hard at the clock on the wall, which showed us it was a quarter past 1. “It’s been over an hour! What’s happened to him?”

I had a sudden realization that stopped me cold. “What if Karabasan wasn’t using Gadson to go after the HVAC?”

Jacob turned to me. “What?”

I spoke slowly, my eyes wide as I processed the implications of my worries. “What if… Gadson went after the cannisters instead? Karabasan knew about both the modified HVAC and the gas. He could’ve picked either one. Why go for the HVAC, which he knew would be guarded, if he could intercept the gas before Wayne got his hands on it?”

“No…” Jacob breathed. “Oh, no… Maybe Wayne did get there in time, but Gadson’s killed him! You have the gun that he used to fight him off in the first place! Wayne’s defenseless!”

My phone rang. It was Wayne.

“Wayne!” I exclaimed, picking it up in record time. “Where are you? What happened?”

“Gadson,” came his curt response. There was a ton of background noise interference, so I had to strain my ears to make out his words. I think it was an engine rumbling.

“Are you alright?” I asked.

“What happened?” Jacob whispered to me.

“Gadson,” I told him, and put the call on speaker.

“-got the cannisters and heading back now,” Wayne was saying. “Listen, he’s right on my tail, and he’s not happy. Meet me at the back entrance and be ready for a fight.”

He hung up.

“You were right,” Jacob said. “The demon is after Wayne!”

“At least he’s still got the gas,” I said, shouldering my weapon and heading up the stairs. “Come on, let’s go get ready to meet him.”

We took the stairs and snuck through the nurses’ office to the back exit. Luckily no one spotted us, and the nurse was in her office on the phone. Blinking in the sunlight after being huddled in the dim basement for half the day, we took up positions by the door and waited. Our view was relatively limited by the school building itself, which stretched out to the left and obscured the main road.

Not fifteen minutes later, the sound of screeching tires reached our ears, followed by the roaring of some inhuman creature and a harsh crackle of electricity. Wayne’s truck skidded into view as he drifted into the parking lot behind the school, half leaning out the window, firing one of his strange lightning guns at an unseen enemy. He gunned the truck, roaring towards us before screeching to a halt. Wayne jumped out, running to the back and throwing the tail gate down.

“Don’t just stand there!” He yelled at us. “Grab a cannister and take it down!”

Gadson rounded the corner. He was utterly monstrous now, more of a hound from hell than a human. He sprinted on all fours, his legs gangly and bristling with dark spines, his hands and feet transformed into spindly claws. His face was gaunt and pale, with jagged teeth protruding from his snarling mouth. Spines erupted from his scalp and down his back, the longest reaching over a foot.

Wayne fired, a beam of lightning arcing across the parking lot and slamming into Gadson, knocking him back. “Go!” He ordered. “I’ll hold him off!”

Startled into movement, me and Jacob rushed forward and grabbed one of the two cannisters. They were fairly heavy, so it took both of us to carry one. We shuffled back inside, through the nurse’s office and down the stairs as fast as we could without falling. Gingerly setting it down outside the closet, we turned to go get the second when Wayne burst through the doors at the end of the hall, the second cannister under his arm. He sprinted down the hall towards. Heavy footfalls behind him told us Gadson was still in pursuit. Wayne skidded to a stop in front of use, heaving the cannister down and fumbling with the keys on his belt.

“As soon as he comes through those doors,” Wayne told me, fitting a key into the maintenance closet’s lock, “Blast him. I’ll hook these up to the HVAC and then we’ll flood the school. Once all the kids are alert, we won’t have to worry about the parents coming for the show, although we’ll use this second cannister to wake them up, too.”

I nodded, hoisting my gun and leveling it at the double doors at the end of the hall. All sounds had ceased, other than Wayne hooking the gas cannister up. I waited.

The set of double doors to the left of us blew off their hinges, and Gadson crashed through, swiping at me with a claw. It caught my arm, knocking the gun from my grasp and sending me flying to the floor. My arm stung; I felt blood seep into my shirt. I groaned, my head ringing from the impact.

Wayne cursed, jumping back to avoid another of Gadson’s wild strikes, which tore through a few hoses attached to the HVAC unit. Jacob stepped in, swinging his sword in a hard downward arc and shearing through Gadson’s outstretched hand. He jumped back, hissing, and was blown back by a bolt of electricity from Wayne’s gun, which he had unstrapped from his back. Gadson shrieked at us, jaw unhinged, before dashing away, blood dripping from the stump of his arm. He smashed through the doors at the end of the hall and disappeared.

I got up, grimacing, clutching my arm.

“Are you hurt?” Jacob asked me. He saw the blood staining my shirtsleeve, and his eyes widened. “Hey, Wayne, we have a problem.”

“I’ll say,” Wayne snarled, examining the HVAC. “He’s cut some vital hoses. I don’t know if I can fix this in time.”

“Thomas’ been hurt,” Jacob said.

“I’m fine,” I retorted. “Just a few cuts. Focus on fixing the machine, Wayne. Don’t worry about me.”

“Good,” Wayne grunted. “I need to go get my tools. Make sure Gadson doesn’t come back. It’ll be tight, but I think we can make it. We’ll just get everybody all at once in the auditorium. Jacob, when does the talent show start?”

Jacob frowned. “2:00, but the entire school will file in at 1:55. And the parents start arriving at 1:45.”

Wayne grimaced. “We can make it. I’ll be right back.” He disappeared up the stairs.

I took a few steps and retrieved my fallen weapon. When I straightened back up, my head felt woozy.

“You sure you’re all right?” Jacob asked. “You’re pretty pale.”

“Yeah…” I maintained. “I’m fine…”

“No, you’re not,” Jacob grabbed my hand and started dragging me towards the stairs. “Come on, we need to stop that bleeding. It looks pretty bad.”

“Where are we going?” I asked.

“The nurse,” Jacob responded. We emerged on the first floor to dead silence and crossed to the nurse’s office. No one was around.

“No one heard us?” I asked. My head spun.

“Everyone’s half dead and half asleep, remember?” Jacob said wryly. He knocked on the office door, and the nurse answered a second later. “Hey, Mrs. Roberts. Uh, could you take a look at Mr. O’Keen?” He gestured to me.

Mrs. Roberts gasped when she saw my arm. “My goodness, what happened to you?” She bustled us in and closed the door behind us, pulling up my sleeve. Four long gashes scored my forearm. “What happened? Was this a wild animal?” She got up and began rummaging through a cabinet.

“Not exactly,” Jacob said. “It was, uh, old business.”

Mrs. Roberts stopped and gave Jacob a hard look. “You didn’t drag the poor therapist into our madness, did you?”

“You… know?” I asked. My head was feeling bit better now, but my arm felt like it was on fire.

“Yeah, she knows,” Jacob told me. “I mean, who else could we trust to fix us up when something went awry?”

“I had thought that the death of Mr. Richardson would’ve deterred you,” The nurse said, grabbing a bandage and some antiseptic. She poured the medicine on a sterile cloth and dabbed at my wounds. It stung and smarted. I grimaced from the pain.

“Not as long as the others are in danger,” Jacob sighed.

Mrs. Roberts gave him a disapproving sniff, wrapping my arm tightly with a white bandage. “That should do it,” She stepped back. “Try to avoid using that arm for a few days, alright? And let me know if it gets infected.”

“Yes, ma’am,” I said.

“And that means no dragging him along to any haunted bathrooms or anything,” The nurse glared at Jacob. “I know how you are. He needs to rest.”

“I’m not sure that’s possible,” Jacob pressed his lips together in a hard line. “Come on, we need to go check on Wayne.”

We tromped back down the stairs to find Wayne covered in grease and oil, laying back and working furiously.

I checked my watch. It read 1:53. “Almost done?” I asked, my voice cracking from worry.

“Nearly there…” Wayne said, tightening something with a wrench. “Nearly… got it!” he slid back out from under the machine and quickly hooked the cannister of gas up. “Alright,” He grinned. “It was close, but we’ve made it.” He turned the tap, and we heard the hissing of gas as it poured into the machine. The HVAC unit thrummed to life, fans whirring, spreading the wakefulness gas throughout the school.

We all started laughing, the kind of laugh you laugh when you know something terrible could’ve happened, but you managed to avert it at just the last second. Laugher of relief.

After a few seconds, wiping our eyes, we calmed down. “Well,” I said, smiling broadly. “That’s it, then. That’s a wrap. One demon defeated.”

“All in a day’s work,” Jacob grinned.

“Now that the crisis is over,” Wayne said, brushing his hands off on his trousers. “We can start to focus on how to completely cut off the demon from this plane entirely, so that he can’t even affect our dreams.”

“Yeah, and speaking of that…” I began. Since the danger had passed, I figured I should admit to my mistakes now.

“Hey, you said there was smelling salts in that mixture, right?” Jacob asked suddenly.

“Yes, why?”

“Shouldn’t we, you know, have started smelling it by now?”

We all paused. Wayne took a few experimental sniffs of the air. Panic flashed across his face. “Yes. Yes, we should.” He turned strode over the other cannister and turned the valve. Gas hissed out, and he bent and sniffed it. Slowly, he turned the tap back off and raised up. “This… is not the gas I ordered.”

My face froze. “What?”

Wayne turned to us, horror written across his features. “The MAOI and smelling salts gas has a distinctive ammonia smell. This does not.”

“We have the wrong gas,” I breathed. “Oh, no…”

Cackling laughter sounded from the end of the hall. **“Oh, this is priceless,”** Gadson sneered. He was crouching in the ruined doorframe. **“Three fools, finally figuring out how hopeless their situation is.”**

*“What have you done?”* Wayne bellowed, leveling his gun at him. “What’s in those cannisters? And where are mine?”

**“Relax,”** Gadson said. **“It’s only compressed air. I wouldn’t want to kill the children, would I? That would just mess everything up. I switched the cannisters out before you picked them up.”**

Wayne roared, and harsh lightning shot down the hall, knocking Gadson’s monstrous form back.

“We’ve got to do something!” Jacob turned to me, sword in hand.

“Come on,” I said, sprinting for the stairs. “Show me where the auditorium is!”

We ran through the halls of the school, every classroom door open, the seats empty. Jacob and I rounded a corner, halting in front of a mass of students. The line to the auditorium. The kids were slowly filing in.

“We’ll never make it!” I gasped.

“The back entrance,” Jacob’s face was steely. “Follow me.” He led me in a roundabout manner to the very back of the school. The back door was, thankfully, propped open, presumably for stage techs to easily get in and out. We dashed in, ignoring the cries of some working back there, and exploded onto a makeshift stage, which was lit with spotlights that made it hard to see the audience. I could already feel a pervading sense of wrongness in the atmosphere.

There was a single kid on stage, an eighth grader, who had the job of narrating the whole thing.

“Welcome, everyone!” He was saying. “Welcome to the seventh annual Jacksonville Middle Talent Show! I’ll be your host, Jeremy—” He broke off, seeing us dash across the stage. “Who’s this? Some more contestants?”

I grabbed the kid’s microphone out of his hand, ignoring his cries of protest, and turned to the listless audience. Most of the kids were already in their seats, staring blankly at the stage. Parents lined the walls, and some sat in metal folding chairs in the back. They, too, shared the student’s tired, sagging faces.

“Listen to me!” I shouted. “Everybody is in great danger! You all have to leave, immediately!” Behind me, Jacob was struggling to keep the other kid, Jeremy, from tackling me and taking the mic back.

“There’s been, um, a gas leak!” I lied. “The school could blow! You all need to leave!” The last of the kids filed in, and the air seemed to grow hazy. “Can’t you see it?” I yelled. “Can’t you feel it? We’re all going to die!”

There was a sound like a crack of thunder, and reality split, a gaping hole opening behind me on the stage, revealing a starry void beyond it, with swaths of deep purples and blues.

“No…” I breathed. We were too late. The demon was here.

A sardonic grin stretched wide in the void, two blazing white eyes blinking open.

Then the screams began.

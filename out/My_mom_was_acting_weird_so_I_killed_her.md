Listen I know that title is very awful, I know but hear me out. About a year ago my parents and I moved to a new home out in the country as some sort of escape from the loud and obnoxious lifestyle that was the inner city. It was great for the first 4 months....that was until one night at exactly 1:24am when I woke up to a figure laying next to me with the widest eyes I have ever seen. Each eye felt like it went from forehead to nose. and then I wake up to my alarm beeping a 1:23am alarm. "I don't remember setting that" I murmured as I sluggishly turned it off and turned back over. Fast forward to 7:30am, I get up to get some breakfast and have some time with my parents. "I had a weird dream", my mom says and she takes a bite of her freshly made toast. "Same here, I woke up at a weird time and saw this figure in my bed". My mom as slow and as quiet and she could, gets up and walks away without saying a word.

I chalked it up to my mom being sick or something and just went about my day. It's around 8pm and I'm watching some YouTube videos as I start to drift off. I decide to call it for the night. There it is again, that dream, but this time.......the figure was my mother. This wasn't a dream. I see my mom staring at me, eyes from forehead to nose, in my bed. I bolt out of my room and run into the hallway only to see my parents covered in what seemed to be their own blood as I hear someone from my room..."Don't be scared of mommy".

I felt like I was just struck by lightning as my body is static and still.

&#x200B;

I hear footsteps from behind and a breath of what seemed to be molten lava hit my neck. A rush of adrenaline shot through every bone in my body as I ran as fast as I could into kitchen grabbing any sharp object I could come in contact with. \*thud\* \*thud\* the steps were as fast as my heart-beat. 

&#x200B;

\*thud\* thud\* getting louder...\*thud\* thud\* right at the corner now....\*thud\* they stopped.

&#x200B;

Then there I see, my mom and dad's head peak around the corner, eyes gauged and blood draining from them like a water fountain. I knew that THING was right there. So with any ounce of courage I still had, I bolt around that corner to see..nothing. "What the hell!" I exclaim as a drip hitting my face from the ceiling, as I look up and my face goes pale.

&#x200B;

"Don't be scared of mommy" as that thing drops down on top of me! Jaw wider than the eyes were! I struggle to get my barrings as I try desperately try to grab the nice that fell out of my hand when it pinned me!

&#x200B;

I finally get a grip on it and pierce through that things neck. I breathe a sigh of relief as I hear something....\*beep\* \*beep\* \*beep\* It was now 1:25am...

I train dogs for K9 Search and Rescue, and specialize in human remains detection dogs.  We worked crime scenes for jurisdictions where the police departments don’t have search dogs, disaster sites for cadaver recovery, and wilderness area search. I had a team of three cadaver recovery dogs, and worked with a partner who handled a team of two live detection dogs. He worked with a search team looking for survivors or tracks, and I followed in a sweeping pattern behind him looking for human remains that their team passed over, since live detection dogs are trained to not cue on human remains.  (That way, they can prioritize locating survivors in a disaster rather than wasting time digging up a corpse. That’s my job.)  

My partner and I had worked together since we were 18, and always searched together.  If he gave me a ring at 3 am, I knew he'd meet me at the curb so he could load his dogs in my truck and give me a coffee so we could go have another weird night.

I work in Mid-Missouri, where we only have one new FEMA SAR task force, so we got a lot of calls. I live near the Ozarks and St. Louis, so we got some odd ones. I worked a lot of urban crime scenes and wilderness searches, so my dogs became pretty diversified.

One series of search assignments made me decide to stop working in the field. I still train dogs and sell them to other task forces, and I work as a behaviorist for an animal shelter now, but I will never work another active search site.

Okay, enough background.

In 2016, there was a missing person report of someone in the Lake of the Ozarks area during the University of Missouri’s spring break. We assumed someone got drunk and got lost, or, worst case scenario, drowned in an accident. My team and partner were called in to search the area that night, and a water recovery team from Illinois came in to search the water. My partner found a live track after a couple of hours, and followed it to a dead end where his dog froze and stopped searching. He tagged his location on our shared GPS trackers, and I came to his location, and my dog cued.

Now, my dogs cue on a positive find by lying down and lifting their heads high. Ruffin, the dog I was handling at the time, lay down and raised his head, and started to squirm and whine. This was completely out of character for him, and I thought he’d been hurt. After checking him over and confirming that he was fine, I pulled him away from the site, told him to “find it,” and he went straight for the site again and repeated the behavior. I lost my shit and dragged my dog away, not sure why he was so upset.

My partner and the rest of his team examined the area. Two full black trash bags were hanging from tree limbs above our heads.

Ruffin didn’t know how to tell me that the human remains were above me.

Two days later, another target went missing. We brought more people and law enforcement officers with us this time. That time, the water recovery team found the remains. Trash bags tied in tree limbs hanging over the lake.

Four days later, again. Found in a campground, without our assistance.

I was having nightmares. My dogs and I were constantly running drills. I had never handled anything like this before. I was 27 years old, and inexperienced. I was afraid I would mess something up. This was getting so insane. What if I contaminated a crime scene? What if we did something wrong? What if we didn’t do our job fast enough, and put other people in danger?

When the next call came, I was already awake. I met my partner at the curb at 11 PM, and he loaded his dogs in the truck and gave me my usual coffee.  

We drove to the site to meet the rest of the search team. Business as usual. They searched the area and looked for a live track, and I swept behind with my cadaver dog. I swapped out my dogs every 30-60 minutes so they don’t get frustrated. Business as usual. No problem. Everything is fine.

We kept open radio communication. My partner could hear that I was freaked out already. This was above my pay grade.

My dog cued.

The body was not in a tree. It was severed like the last few, and half-stuffed in a bag under a bunch of sticker bushes, and blood was leaking out. It smelled like copper and honey. I could see the glistening of entrails, like a freshly shot deer that was in the middle of being dressed in the field. They didn’t have time to hang it.

I got a call in through my radio. My partner told me he had a live track, and tagged his GPS. He was half a mile from my location, deeper into the woods. He told me to come to his location.

No.

I radio him back.  I found the target.

He is not following the target.

He is following the person who LEFT the target.

No.

The track is fresh.

No.

COME BACK.

NO.

TURN AROUND. I FOUND THE TARGET. YOU ARE NOT FOLLOWING THE TARGET.





My dogs are well-trained, reliable, and quite good at recovering human remains. Unfortunately, I won’t work in the field again after my final search and recovery assignment, which I received the next morning.  No coffee.

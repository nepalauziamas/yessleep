 Sunday was a stressful day for me; unlike the weeks before, I had to work last Sunday: Technically speaking, last Sunday was yesterday. Lately, I have been having a hard time sleeping. Doing late nights at the office was not helping me; I think it made everything worse. 

Yesterday after I got home from work, I slumped on the couch to watch some tv. Nothing good was on; most of my favorite shows got canceled by MovieToGo. I tried not to continue a show that was canceled, so instead, I put on a random show and made my best attempt at paying attention. Like nights before, I could feel my body giving in to the feeling of sleep, it took some convincing, but I finally let it happen.

At some point, I could hear the sound of my fridge being opened, and the familiar creak of the door shook me to my core. I live alone; I don't even have any animals, so there was no one I knew in the house. I could feel the hair on the back of my neck stand up, and for a few minutes, I couldn't bring myself to open my eyes.

Eventually, I let my eyes open, and I sat up as slowly as possible. It was hard for me to formulate possibilities in my head, and since I don't own weapons, I took a pillow with me. I took each step with care as I approached my kitchen; now, I felt like an intruder in my own home.

As I got closer to the room, I heard various packages open. Something was eating my food. Whatever it was, it sounded like it was eating like a pig; the slurping noises being made invaded my ears. I figured this thing had to be a human because animals can't open a refrigerator.

I bit the inside of my lip hard enough to draw blood. I could taste it. "Hello? Whoever you are, you need to leave! I will call the police!" I snapped. I was hoping I was scary enough to scare whatever was in my kitchen. I also hoped this person didn't call my bluff, my phone was dead, and I didn't put it on the charger before going to bed.

I heard my backdoor open after a couple of quiet moments. Before I got the chance to put my head in the room, the door slammed. It was hard enough to make the glass on my door shatter. At this point, I took a step back. I wanted to run to my front door and get out. However, curiosity got the better of me. After all, I needed to know what to report to the police? 

After taking a second to gain some composure, despite hearing my heart beating in my ears, I put my head in the kitchen to see who was in my kitchen. It was not a human, not even close. In the kitchen light, I saw a thick, scaly creature. The creature's lizard-like tail was curled around its feet.

I felt like I was going to have a heart attack. My brain could barely process what I was looking at. Its yellow eyes pierced my gaze as it ripped open a GoDurGurt. I wondered why this creature didn't attack me. I wondered what the world would be like after I died. It felt like I was still for hours. 

I watched as the lizard creature opened the milk jug and gulped it down without any problem. After the beast finished the milk, the beast turned and bolted out of my backdoor. Its shoulders caused the doorway to crack. I felt like I was going to throw up. I raised my hand and gave my wrist a pinch. I was not asleep.

I did not call the police; what would I say after all? Once I was sure the creature wasn't coming back, I ran to the front door to check it for cracks. When I didn't see any, I ran upstairs. I checked each room before arriving at my bedroom. 

My window was open. I could see deep claw marks on my walls. The creature must have climbed in through here. I refuse to sleep in my bedroom. I took a couple of supplies and ran to my car; the most essential object was my laptop: This thing would have to be my lifeline. No one will believe my story, but I am determined to find answers. My heart is still racing. I haven't been able to relax. 

I didn't bother to call into work. Instead, I started my car and began my drive. After driving for three hours, I had a panic attack and stopped at a hotel. I decided to write two copies of this event, one that I am sharing with you and the other in a journal of sorts. I will find answers, but first, I need to try and relax. I am scared of every shadow and every sound. All night I had to battle with my mind. I wondered what was real. 

Whatever the case, I know what I saw. The lizard was real; my anxiety and fear were real. If I come across the lizard man again, I will be ready. Tomorrow I begin my search for answers.

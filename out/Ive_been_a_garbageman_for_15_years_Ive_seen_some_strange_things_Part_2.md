I’ve been checking my previous post a few times since I’ve submitted it, and I’m honestly surprised at the feedback I’ve received. First off, I want to clarify a few things about my job. If it wasn’t clear in the first post, we pick up trash once a week in our city; if I gave any of you the impression that we picked up trash everyday, I apologize, because that most certainly isn’t the case.

A few of you have mentioned family members who are also garbage men. I’m sure they have had their fair share of strange experiences, and I would love to hear more about those to see if there are any similarities to my own.

Another thing, someone mentioned Islamic mythology and trash being associated with the Djinn. I’d love a little more information on this. As someone who has only worked for a small city in my adult years, I’m not particularly well versed in mythological creatures.

Anyways, onto some more stories:

**—** I haven’t always worked with Tom on the garbage truck. At first, I worked at the main office and cleaned out garbage cans and hauled certain materials to recycling centers. I got off work a couple hours earlier when I was in office, but I had been requesting trash pick-up for a while; I needed something a little less boring if I was going to stick around. Eventually, I got the call about switching departments and was set to start trash pick up the following day.

They paired me with some guy named Kell, and honestly, that should’ve been my first sign. Kell was unlike any guy I’ve ever met. He was always smiling. Always. No matter what was going on. The world could be ending right in front of his face and he’d still be smiling. And it wasn’t just any kind of smile. It was a big smile, so big in fact, it seemed unnatural. His teeth were perfect, straight and shiny and pure white. He had slicked back blonde hair, too, like he used too much gel in the morning; he almost reminded me of a Ken doll.

Something about the way he moved, though, set me on edge. Any time he got out of the truck to help me load something big, his movements were deliberate. He was always tense, like his joints needed some WD-40 to loosen them up. He never bent his knees when he walked and instead waddled like a penguin. I always just brushed it off as some kind of defect that Kell had, but later on, I realized that wasn’t the case.

One day, we had just started our shift and it was around 7 in the morning. Before we pulled in to our first house, Kell slammed on the brakes and almost sent me flying off the back of the truck.

“What the—?” I said, trying to balance myself with the handrail. I hopped down from the small platform on the corner of the truck, ready to give Kell hell for almost bucking me off the truck.

He could’ve been swerving to avoid hitting an animal, but with me hanging off the back of the truck, he should’ve been more careful.

“Kell, you piece of—“

I stopped talking abruptly when I made it to the driver’s side door, my mouth hanging open in awe. Kell was sitting in the driver’s seat, staring out the front windshield, his head tilted slightly to the right. He had a wide grin plastered on his blemish-free face.

I didn’t say anything and instead peered over the front of the truck. I didn’t see any animals or rocks or tree limbs he was trying to avoid. So why had he stopped in the middle of the road so suddenly?

“Hey, Kell,” I snapped my fingers in his ear, trying to get his attention, to no avail. He stayed in the same position, grin and all.

Honestly, the longer I stared at him, the more I started to get creeped out. Was he in some sort of catatonic trance?

“Dude, we really need to get going,” I said, trying once again to get his attention.

No response. Instead, I saw a small pillow of smoke start to seep from his ear. It was almost like those cartoons you see where the characters get angry and smoke starts to billow out of their ears. Except this was seeping out slowly like an early morning fog.

Worried, I reached into the truck and poked Kell’s shoulder. I regretted that decision as soon as it was made, though, because he started shaking violently once I touched him.

The smoke started pouring out of his ear, thick and fast, like his insides were on fire. I stared at him with wide eyes, unsure of what to do.

The longer he shook, the more worried I became, so I pulled out my cell phone and dialed the city’s office. 

“Billings Sanitation Services, this is Martha, how can I help you?”

At first I didn’t know what to say because how was anyone going to believe that my coworker was smoking from the ears and having some sort of violent seizure. 

I had no other choice, so I just started rambling like a mad man, telling Martha what was going on with Kell. She assured me things were fine, but she dispatched the lead office to check on us. Within minutes, they arrived and had pulled Kell out of the truck before I was able to ask any questions.

They carried Kell off like a baby hanging off its mother’s shoulder. He was limp and lifeless now; the shaking and smoking had stopped thankfully. As I watched them leave, Kell lifted his head to give me the most evil glare you could imagine. He tilted his head to the side, but at a strange angle, like it was almost upside down. I didn’t know how the position wasn’t hurting him. 

As the crew carried him away, he lifted an arm slowly and pointed a finger straight at me. I saw him mouth the word “you” as they loaded him into the truck. He kept his eyes on me the whole time.

I never saw Kell again. And I never knew what happened to him; I was always too afraid to ask. The next day, they paired me with Tom, and I continued work like nothing had happened. 

When I think about the look he gave me, though, a shiver vibrates through my body. I don’t know what he meant by it or the deliberate pointing, but something tells me it was malicious.

**—** This next story is more weird than it is anything else, but I figure it’s interesting enough to tell. 

There is this man who always waits for us at the curb when we pick up his trash. He usually has two bags of trash, but sometimes it’s three; I guess it depends on the week. But instead of leaving the bags on the curb for us to pick up, he always hands me the bags himself. It’s kind of like he wants to make sure we don’t forget to stop at his house and collect his trash, even though we have the whole route mapped out perfectly now.

He always thanks us for our service and gives Tom and me a piece of hard candy in a cherry red wrapper. I’m not sure what kind of candy it is because I never eat it. Hard candy hurts my teeth, and I don’t like the fact of eating something from someone I barely know. So, when we drive out of sight, I usually toss my candy into the back of the truck. I’m not sure what Tom does with his, though. 

Part of me wants to believe the man has good intentions, but there’s something about the guy that rubs me the wrong way.

Anyway, one day we get to his house and he isn’t standing at the curb. There are two bags of trash sitting in his place, though, and the front door of his house is standing wide open. I guess Tom noticed how strange the scene seemed because he got out of the truck and we both gave each other our “something is up” look.

I didn’t touch the trash bags while Tom called the police. We stood there until an officer arrived and went into the house. He was only in there for a few minutes before he came back out and phoned for back up and an ambulance.

Tom and I stuck around for a few more minutes while the officer peeked into one of the trash bags. It was full of those familiar red candy wrappers. All empty.

Tom and I gave each other another look, and we left shortly after. A few days later, I heard what happened on the news. The police had found the guy laying in his living room, dead. An autopsy report showed he had suffocated. They didn’t reveal if he choked on something or if someone choked him, but they did reveal that he was completely surrounded by those red candy wrappers.

**—** A lot of you seemed concerned about the sludge boy in my last post. To be honest, I see so many strange things day to day that I’d almost forgotten about him. Until I saw him again.

This past Saturday I was at my local coffee shop getting a donut and decaf coffee (caffeine makes my heart flutter) to decompress after a long work week. 

I sat down at one of the tables facing the window overlooking the street when I notice something strange going on outside. A kid, more likely a teenager, was doing some sort of ballerina dance across the street. He had short, greasy black hair that stuck to his forehead, but what was so strange about the boy was that he wore jeans that looked two sizes too big for him and a t-shirt that had been cut off to show his midriff. The cuts were jagged and uneven like a toddler had been the one to crop the shirt. 

It took a second, but I noticed the boy was the same boy who popped from the ball of sludge at the landfill. At least he had on clothes this time, but something was still off about him.

As people walked past him on the street, he continued to dance on his tiptoes like a ballerina performing for hundreds on stage. He twirled around with his arms in the air and jumped and pranced from side to side. 

He sure was putting on quite the show, but the people around him didn’t seem to notice. In fact, I seemed to be the only one who was watching.

Something about the whole scene left a bad taste in my mouth and I couldn’t even eat my donut. 

I continued watching the boy, wondering if I should go outside and take him to a doctor or hospital or something, but as I contemplated the idea, he stopped.

He stopped mid twirl like someone had pressed pause on a remote that was controlling his movements. He turned his head slowly and we made eye contact. His lips turned down into an animated frown like he was sad no one was watching his dance. 

We stared at each other for a solid minute until he broke from his stance and stood stick straight. His frown was gone, his mouth now a sharp, straight line across his face. Something told me I needed to get up and run, but I was frozen in place. I needed to see what was going to happen.

Much like the first time we met, he started backing away slowly, moving in painful, twisty jerks. This time he cupped his hands around his mouth and let out the most blood-curdling screech I have ever heard. 

“It’s coming!” He screamed again, a repeat of what he growled the first time. 

No one else seemed to notice what was going on. They were stuck in their own little worlds.

Instead of waiting around to see if whatever was coming showed up, I hightailed it out of the coffee shop and went back home. 

I still had no idea what was coming or what the boy meant by it, but what I did know is that I had a terrible feeling something bad was about to happen.

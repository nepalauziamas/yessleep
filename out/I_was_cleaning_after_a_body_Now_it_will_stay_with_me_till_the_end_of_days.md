It was supposed to be a simple cleaning side job.

It's 6 AM, I wake up as always, my friends are supposed to come for me, since we planned to go for a little road trip before the work. I'm boiling some water for coffee meanwhile I dress up. Not so long after I finished my lovely drink my friends came to my house. We smoked one before we got out.

The road trip went nice, we went into some woods, walked around just talking about the job, looked for some mushrooms and other things. Finally, it was time to come back.

It was supposed to be a simple side job.

11 AM. We got into our friend's house, ate some breakfast. Before we went out, I asked my friend, let's call him Andrew, about some details:

"So, can you finally tell me what's the salary?" I asked.

"200 dollars, and since you get the worst part of the job, you'll get a hundred for that." Andrew responded.

"And what's the **worst** part?" I hesitated.

"The **bathroom**. You'll know why when we will get there. I couldn't stay there long because of the **smell**." He answered.

I was overthinking about it, creating every possible scenario for this "**simple** cleaning" even though now I knew it's something **worse**, but I didn't hesitate, since 100$ is a lot for me.

The time to go has came. We went there.

It was supposed to be a **side job**.

12 PM. It was a hot noon after some rainy morning. We got out from the car. I looked around and instantaneously felt **worried** about it. It was downtown, just a flat with a small parking backyard. After I looked for a while, I found the building in which we were supposed to go. All of the windows were opened.

"Here we go" Andrew said.

I didn't say anything. I couldn't think of a word that would describe how **worried** I was. We entered the building, and then Andrew said "You **smell** this?", but I didn't smell anything at all, so I just shook my head with a little bit of hesitation. We went up, the first floor. The boss was waiting there already, with a mask on. There were two doors opened. One leaded to a clean apartment. We went there first.

"Here are some gloves, hazmat suits and masks for you guys." The employer said.

We've looked at each other and the severity of this situation came to our minds. This isn't going to be a simple side job, it's gonna be worse. We put our hazmats, gloves and masks on, and before we came in through the second doors, we just exchanged a glance.

It was **supposed** to be a **simple** job.

As we walked in, the smell hit me. Chemicals, excrements, humidity, spray refresheners, it all combined into one smell and it was devastating. Andrew gagged and told that he can't work here. The biggest problem was, I still didn't know what was coming for me. I looked around the kitchen, the living room and bedroom. Spoiled food and drinks, excrements on the floor, it just looked like a big sandwich that you keep in your backpack for the whole summer vacation, but from inside. I left the biggest surprise, the bathroom, for the end. I walked to the bathroom's doors. That's where the most of stench came from. I opened the door, and as much as the daylight could show, there were excrements and bodily fluids all over the floor. Seriously, every inch was mixed with toilet paper, shit and blood. I was startled. I even didn't care about the smell at that moment. I just watched.

It was supposed **to be** simple.

I took as many chemicals with me as I could. Sprayed everything with them so it would get wet and come off, but you know what? It didn't help. The flies were going outrageous, there was like a hundred of them just in the toilet and many more on the walls and celling. I went for some hot water, mixed it with all I got and spilled it all over the floor.

It worked. But it smelled even worse.

I started to scrape it off by hands, then I came for a brush to get it off. I packed everything into trash bags. At one point we even got a shovel, because the brush stopped doing it's work. After some time, our other friend came to help us, since only I was inside.  


We worked hard, just occasionally exchanging a few words with ourselves. One and a half hour into the cleaning, I hear my name.  


"Tom, come here for a moment." My friend, Ben, called me.  


Ben was standing in front of a calendar. I didn't suspect much since I just got carried away with work.  


"Look, you see the date?" He asked as he pointed onto the month.  


**June 19th**, Sunday. Now it was 10th of September.  


"You don't think that all this shit stayed here for almost 3 months, right?" I asked.  


"I mean... I don't know, it looks like it, it **smells** like it." Ben responded.  


We just looked at each other with visible confusion. That didn't make any **sense**. Why would someone leave it for that long, didn't they fell it? Ben decided to find some of the deceased resident's notes. We knew it wasn't right, but something didn't look right.  


I came back to cleaning. I didn't even care about the smell at that time. All I could feel were chemicals. I felt bad doing all this work. There should be professionals and not guys who just do simple jobs for a bit of money. Now I was trying to finish it as fast and as clean as I could. Minutes passed, complete silence, just the simplest sounds of cleaning. Even the outside was silent. No people, no cars, nothing. I started cleaning the shower, when I spotted something of a texture other than paper. It was on the shower's floor. I scraped it off. It came apart in my hands, it smelt bad. Then I heard Ben again.  


"Tom, come here!"  


I went to the living room in which he was. There was a notebook in his hand.  


"Look, the last entry was at 19th of July. The same date as in the calendar."  


I instantaneously felt that's **something's much off**.  


"Read it, just read it, Tom." Ben spoke.  


The entry was:  


"**June 19th, 2022**. No one remembers me. Not even my k**i**ds or **m**y grandchildren. Only the neig**h**bor is doing som**e** g**r**oc**e**ries for me. I don't feel like eating anymore. I feel the smell of my food rotting in the kitchen. I feel the smell of me. I even can't make it to toilet on time anymore. Neighbors asked me about the smell and if I needed to go to the hospital. I couldn't say yes, I wouldn't want people to see me like this, even if it's the last time. I should wash myself and then think about going somewhere else. I'll ask for help after I get myself clean. ***~~Hopefully all will be good~~****~~.~~*"  


I came to my mind. The **stench** in the **bathroom**. The **weird** thing of different texture that I picked up from the shower's floor. No... No, it can't... it can't be. Please no.  


It was **supposed**.  


I told Ben about the situation in the bathroom, about the fluids, about the thing with weird texture on the shower floor. I couldn't believe that. I couldn't believe that I was cleaning a bathroom full of remainings of a **corpse**. Everything turned black. I was conscious but I couldn't come to my **senses**. I, like, turned off.  


After a few minutes I hopped back in. I thought that if we're almost finished, there's no point of cancelling it now. We should end our job and get paid. We somehow pulled this off. I've finished the bathroom, and my friend finished the rest. I was never so stressed in my life. We called the "boss" and told him that everything's finished. He came in, looked around, told that it's perfect and handed us the 200 dollars. I took it without a word. I went to the other, clean apartment, took the hazmat off, then the mask, and then the gloves. I didn't say anything to anyone. I just wanted to go out from there. I went outside and straight to the car. I took out my last smoke. As I put it close to my mouth, I felt that the chemicals were also on my hands. I never felt so... filthy?  


Then Ben came. We took off from there. We didn't say a word on the way back. We could feel how much we stink of shit and other things. We smelt like a rotten corpse.  


**It** was.  


We went back to Andrew's house. I told him about the whole situation. He was at shock too. I wanted to come home so badly. I wanted to get a shower. I needed some alone time. They dropped me off at my place.  


**It**.

**I** walked in**t**o my house. Every single light was turned off. I didn't feel like I was alone in my house, even though no one was home at that time. I felt **watched**. I felt filthy. I wanted to clean **m**ys**e**lf. **I** wan**t**ed someone to come back home so I **w**ouldn't be here myself. I r**a**n. I turned on all of the light**s**. I turned on the **m**usic. I turn**e**d on the water. I watched as it filled the whole bath. ***I couldn't wait. I couldn't.***  


***I****.*  


***~~Today's 19th of June, 2022. I'm alone at my house. Again. I never worked as a cleaner. I never took a side job. I'm feeling well. The things that people can do for money... are terrible. Would you ever clean after a body? If you've got nerves then sure, right? ...Right? Well... the lights are off, but I don't feel like turning them on. I like it like that. Reminds me of what comes after death, or better... what should come if an uninvited guest wouldn't come to your house.~~***

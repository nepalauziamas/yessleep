I was sitting on the couch watching movies with my friend Alex. He stared at me often which creeped me out. I asked him on multiple occasions why he did it but I got no real response. I put on a horror movie and Alex looked at me and said.  


**“Hey… John? Have you ever heard the story about the woman in the graveyard only a couple miles from us?”**

  
I never heard of such a story but nonetheless it intrigued me so I humored him.  


**“No I haven’t Alex, do you mind telling me?”**  


**“So there was once a woman who was filled with pain and grief ever since her husband died. She went to his grave almost every day of the year wearing the same dress from their marriage, always placing fresh flowers on his grave every day. Because of this she unknowingly gave herself a bad reputation as people found her to be obsessive and creepy.”**  


**“She was so absorbed in her grief that she stopped caring for herself and fell into drug abuse. Rumors began to spread about her and she was given many nicknames. A popular one was the troubled maiden.”**  


I gripped my leg tightly and asked sheepishly.  


**“What became of her? Is she still around?” I said.**  


He looked at me dead in the eyes with a slight smile.  


**“I’m sure she is still around, you could check the graveyard.”**  


I listened to this and remembered something that I tried to bury. I felt sad and realized I haven’t visited him in a while. I preoccupied myself with things from vapes to edible brownies to cope. I got off the couch and grabbed my phone and keys. I said to Alex  


**“I’ll be right back”**  
Alex responded to me saying.  


**“Alright John, be careful out there! Also my friend Destiny is coming over, I just wanted to let you know.”**  


I never met Destiny, so I didn’t know what she looked like. All I knew is that they were just friends and he wasn’t involved in any romantic relationships.  


I got in my car and drove towards the flower shop. It took me around seven minutes to get there. When I arrived it was nine o clock. I spent 20 minutes looking for the freshest and prettiest bouquet of poppy flowers. I felt cold and empty as the cashier rang it up.  


All I could think of was him as I held the poppy flowers in my hands. I paid for them and went out to get inside my car. I started to drive towards the graveyard and that took me around 15 minutes to get there. When I did, the time was 9:35 PM.I arrived at the graveyard, I turned my head to the passenger seat solemnly and grabbed the bouquet of poppy flowers. My dad used to love those. I locked my car and walked down the left path from the front entrance. I heard the sound of a crow and the flapping of its wings.  


I saw the grave I was looking for and got close until I heard something and stopped. A tree branch snapped and I heard rustling in the bushes. I scratched the back of my neck uneasily and kept moving.  


I stood over his grave, my father. I felt so guilty for not visiting sooner, but I made sure to get only the best flowers for him. I bent over and placed the poppy flowers on his grave as I tried to hold back the overwhelming tears.  


I heard a quick stepping run on by, a shadowy blur. This was subsequently followed by a loud female scream. I yelled and panicked. I fell on my ass and scooted backwards until I ran to the gate about to climb over it.  


I didn’t want to wimp out and leave him like that. I decided to man up and go back.  


I pulled out my phone and walked over to my dad's grave and shined the flashlight in every direction, but it did little to nothing. I wanted to stay with him longer, but I felt unsafe.  


I heard someone walking towards me. I turned my head and saw a figure. I shined my light on them to get a better look. They were about my size. They had a mask on that looked like a cloth sack with the pointed ends looking like long ears.  


The bag had eye holes which were long sharp oval like slits with jagged ends. They wore a bowtie which made the end of the sack puff outward and drape over the white hoodie he had. His white hoodie was stained and musty, as if it hadn’t been washed in years. There were red stains all over it in neat splotches.  


He wore black dress pants with a black belt and a flipped collar on each pant leg. He wore converse sneakers, however they looked worn and used. They were also heavily duct taped as they looked to be falling apart. He stopped next to me and placed a flower on the grave to my right. I turned my head and said.  


**“Did you hear that scream?”**  


He turned to look at me and shook his head. I stared down at the flower he placed and asked him a question.  


**“Did you lose someone you loved as well?”**  


He tilted his head and pulled out a picture and gently laid his hand on it. He dragged his hand downward and placed it in his pocket. He shook his head and bent over the grave. I shined my light on him to see what he was doing.  


I heard clanging of metal and he picked up two miniature handheld scythes. He nodded his head and turned to me. He quickly moved and his foot dragged across the ground in a circular motion creating a dirt cloud.  


I started running for my life. I didn’t stop to turn off my phone's flashlight, I instead covered it with one finger. I saw a thick tree and hid behind it. I ran around the tree and he kept on attacking me. He kept up the pace. The hacking of wood and the ring of metal shot through my ears and made my heart beat like a stereo.  


I ran down another path and tripped over something. I saw a string laid out and tied between two graves. I felt around and flashed my light for anything. I saw a big rock and grabbed it quickly. I threw it as hard as I could at his groin area which made him fall on his knees in pain and drop his weapons. I clenched the ground and dug my fingers deep into the soil. I threw a mound full of dirt into his eyes and he clutched his mask.  


I grabbed his scythes and threw them into the darkness and kept running. As I ran I heard his muffled scream. But it wasn’t of fear, but pure rage.  


I shined my flashlight up ahead and screamed at what I saw. I fell back again and subconsciously started to run backwards once I got up. The woman Alex had shown me a picture of, the troubled maiden, was lying on a tombstone in the same gown he showed me. She was dripping with blood, and her back appeared to have been slashed.  


I went up closer and took a picture with my phone. Before I could check for a pulse I heard him coming after me once again. I took a picture of him and kept running forward where there was an open gate. The loud footsteps eventually ceased and I saw two police officers run towards me.  


I fell into the male officer's arms crying profusely. I told them everything quickly but he interrupted me and put both of his hands on my shoulders.  


**“Listen, you need to calm down. You can tell us everything once you have done so.”**  


I told them what I had seen while chattering my teeth and looking back occasionally.  


**“I came here to visit my fathers grave and I placed a bouquet of poppy flowers on the ground in front of it. I heard a woman screaming on the top of her lungs and some dude approached me and stood at the grave next to me.”**  


**“Ok, what happened next?” The female cop said.**  


**“I asked him a few questions and he bent over the grave and picked up two miniature scythes. He looked at me aggressively and I took off running. He chased me all over the graveyard and slashed at a tree I was running around. After I ran away I saw the dead body".**  


The female officer nudged me and said.  


**“It isn’t safe for you to be alone right now, so follow us to our car and we will escort you home.”**  


I walked with the police officers to their car. The male officer opened the door and called on the radio.  


**“Send me another unit 10-33 Requesting backup. We have a kid here who was allegedly chased by an armed suspect. The suspect may be close by”.**  


The male officer walked up to me and asked.  


**“You said before that you recognized the body, did you know this woman?”.**  


I showed him the picture again and told him.  


**“My friend Alex showed me a picture of her. She is the woman called the troubled maiden amongst the townsfolk".**  


The police officer stared at the photo and didn’t even move his head. He lifted his eyes up to look at me deeply.  


**“So you mean to tell me that a lady who died 3 years ago of a drug overdose simply just died again?”.**  


I was shocked. Alex told me that she would still be around, I began to think he was mistaken.  


**“But my friend said she was still alive?! Are you sure she is really dead?”.**  


**“Yes, she is dead. She is buried right next to (My dad's name) I used to know that woman".**  


The cop held his belt with both hands as he looked around. He saw flashing lights of red and blue and a squad car pulled up and four officers stepped out quickly and rushed towards us. He looked back at me and asked.  


**“We also got an anonymous call from someone that you were in danger. Thankfully you are alright sir".**  


I felt weird hearing that. The thoughts raced through my mind as I wondered why someone would specifically want to remain anonymous while reporting screams nearby.  


The female officer stayed by my side and the male officer walked over to the other four. He talked to them and looked back at me a few times occasionally. He pointed to the gate and the four officers ran inside the graveyard with their flashlights on.

I was escorted home with the same two officers trailing behind me. I parked my car in the driveway and waved goodbye as I opened my door and walked inside. I took my edibles and vape and threw them out. I felt like this was irrational, but I didn’t want to end up like her.  


I saw Alex on the couch with bandages on his stomach and he looked like his eyes were irritated and teary. He jolts up when he sees me. I ran towards him and asked worriedly.  


**“Are you alright?! What happened Alex?!”**Alex consoled me and hugged me. He said warmly**“**  


**I wanted to make some food for you as a surprise, but I accidentally cut myself. I also got something stuck in my eye, I’ll be fine".**

I sat down and told him what happened and he was shocked when he saw the pictures of the dead woman. I asked him why he lied to me. He put up his hands and said.

**“I-I didn’t lie! I was told that she was still around, I didn’t know she died!”**  


He crawled over to me and hugged me then said.  


**“I’m glad you are ok, because I care about you John. But I need to ask you something important".**  
**“Of course Alex, what is it?” I said.**  


**“Will you go to rehab for yourself, and me?”.**

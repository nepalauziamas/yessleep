It’s Naissance. 

I’ve come to terms with the fact that this will probably be my final post. 

I made it to Clara Stevens’ residence about an hour ago. Her cottage, once warm, cozy, and inviting; now had an oppressive, corrupt weight to it— as if it were going to collapse on top of me, burying me under a collection of aged-rubble and hiking equipment; effectively ending my journey before its conclusion. I thought that, perhaps, that would be a merciful fate, if not boring. I knew that wouldn’t happen though. *It* wouldn’t let it. That place. 

It had use of me, of that I knew. It wanted me. I was special. That’s what it told me, through the tapes, in my dreams, my visions. I knew the influence that *The Place* had on me was much like that of the others I’ve heard in the recordings. My shifting reality, this underlying feeling of *longing*— it affirmed that. And yet…

Something tells me I would have gone down this path anyway. I would have chosen to seek out *The Place*, even knowing its danger. Its intentions. This feeling comes from a strong, deep desire of curiosity, that I’m sure almost every human being has felt in some way or another at some point in their lives. The desire to explore. The desire to discover. I wanted to become a part of something more important than myself, than this world; than humanity. Even if that something was horrible, and powerful. Even if it caused great pain and suffering. It was a selfish thing— the search for meaning.

Clara Stevens was not here, in her home, however. I could not question her; no, *demand* that she show me the way to *The Place*. Although, I was not sure even she herself knew. Not that she wasn’t trying, of course. In the meantime, I would wait for her return. 

I set the final tape in front of me. This one was different from the others. September 29th, 2022. A recent date. Very, very recent. I wondered if it was ready yet; that altar of crimson blood. I wondered if it would tell me the answers I needed. And to my surprise, it did. 

It told me everything I needed to know, and more. 

I decided to give the tape a name, in respect to the others. Please disregard it if you think it is narcissistic  or conceited, it just… I felt like I had to leave a record of myself somewhere. Maybe another archivist will pick these up somewhere someday, and relegate it to long-term storage, where they will never be touched again. It’s been a long ride. Thank you everyone, for joining me on this journey.

___
**TAPE 1C: ‘NAISSANCE’**

DATED: SEPTEMBER 29TH, 2022
___

\[**START\]**

\[FAINT, ONGOING STATIC\]

\[FOOTSTEPS\]

CLARA: It’s beautiful isn’t it? I finally found it. After all of these years. 

DISTORTED VOICE: Yes.

CLARA: My husband, he’s here, isn’t he?

DISTORTED VOICE: Yes, he is. Somewhere. 

\[PAUSE\]

CLARA: How can you show me how he dies? How can you be sure? It’s been so long.

DISTORTED VOICE: Time…

DISTORTED VOICE: It does not flow here. It is infinite. He is here. 

CLARA: So he’s always been here?

DISTORTED VOICE: Always. Everyone who comes here is always present, somewhere in this place. 

\[LONG, UNINTERRUPTED SILENCE\]

CLARA: How do you know all of this?

DISTORTED VOICE: It told me. 

\[PAUSE\]

\[KNOCKING\]

CLARA: What’s that?

DISTORTED VOICE: Another gateway. It’s okay, it doesn’t concern us. Let’s keep moving. 

\[FOOTSTEPS ECHO\]

DISTORTED VOICE: This is it.

CLARA: This is… That pit, from all those years ago. This was what the bottom looked like? A pit of blood…

DISTORTED VOICE: Yes.

CLARA: This is where he died?

DISTORTED VOICE: It is. 

CLARA: What… What should I do?

DISTORTED VOICE: Wait here. Then, it will come. It— \[PAUSE\] It will take your face. So you can see. 

\[PAUSE\]

CLARA: I… I see. Will it hurt?

DISTORTED VOICE: Yes. But— you will see him. It’s what’s owed to you. 

CLARA: I understand— what will you do?

DISTORTED VOICE: I’ll swim to the center of this crimson altar. And I’ll sink. I will be with the rest of them, in blood, for all of eternity. But first— I need you to speak to her. Like we agreed.

CLARA: Of course. It’s an old well, by an orchard near the hills. There’s an old barn nearby.

\[PAUSE\]

CLARA: Find me, Naissance. Come find me. 

DISTORTED VOICE: Thank you, Clara. 

CLARA: Good luck.

\[SPLASHES\]

\[SLOSHING\]

\[PAUSE\]

\[SCREECHING\]

DISTORTED VOICE: It’s coming. 

\[CLARA SCREAMS\]

\[SPLATTERS, RIPPING\]

\[CLARA GROANS\]

\[THUD\]

\[LOUD SCREECHING\]

\[LONG PAUSE\]

\[SUBMERGED MUFFLED VOICE\]

DISTORTED VOICE: It’s time to see it. Just like in the dreams. What awaits us, down there, past the pulsing flesh at the bottom of this pit?

DISTORTED VOICE: You were wrong about this place, Naissance. About its purpose. People may live, they may die, but the blood— the blood remains. Stained into the Earth, for all of eternity. Blood, and this place, is more ancient than our existence. 

\[PAUSE\]

DISTORTED VOICE: Even as I sink to the bottom, I’m unsure of my fate. I’m unsure of whether or not this is the end, or a new beginning. A dilemma we will both share.

DISTORTED VOICE: Part of me wonders if this bloody altar will reject me, will spit me out into my bedroom, like the visions, the dreams. Birthing me into a seamless, ignorant reality to continue this cycle of blood once again.

\[PAUSE\]

DISTORTED VOICE: I’ll reach it soon. The deepest reaches of *The Place*, in a void of blood.

\[PAUSE\]

DISTORTED VOICE: *The Place*, it wants just one thing. You’re a smart woman. I know you can figure it out. It was nice talking to you, in my final moments. Until next time. This is Naissance. 

\[STATIC\]

**\[END\]**

I understand now. My fate was sealed days ago.

It wasn’t *The Place* that had been influencing me to seek it. It was me. It was always me.

It was clear to me what I must do now. I would look for an old well, near an orchard, by the hills. I would find Clara Stevens in the gateway there. And we would fulfill our purpose.

*The Place’s* purpose, however. That one thing. I think I understood. An altar of blood. Of wounds. Of life. Of death. 

The pull *The Place* had on us; the way it corrupted us. Maybe that was never from *The Place* itself. Maybe it was in all of us, that desire. That desire to seek it. 

All of us— all of us were born in blood. We were born of an altar of blood.

It only makes sense that it would pull us towards our deaths there. It just needed to remind us. 

I had spent all of this time thinking I was special. That *The Place* needed *me*— but it didn’t need me. I wasn’t special. 

It needed a messenger.

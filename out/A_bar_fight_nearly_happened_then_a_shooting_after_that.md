Hello reddit, I wasn't sure which subreddit this belonged to as this is my first time posting here so bear with me. A couple of weeks ago, I was just sitting on my front porch watching some reddit stories when one of the managers at my work place called me and I was reminded about this situation. We chatted for a bit then she asked if I would be willing to call the sheriff's office and give a witness statement regarding the incident at my work. I did so since I was one of the witnesses, I called the office and they asked me to come in and give a written statement. I did, and yesterday I got a visit from a sheriff from the office and was given a subpoena (Which is a paper saying I have to go to court), with all that out of the way, onto the story.

This happened around mid December of 2021 and I was 19 at the time, I (20M) work for a ski resort and I love my job very much (I still have yet to encounter any entitled parents). Working for a resort has many perks, free food for kitchen staff, employee discounts, and $1 ski lessons for employees. I can't ski for two reasons, 1) we're closed for the season, 2) I still have PTSD because stupid me ended up breaking my femur from a ski accident, but that's another story. The resort that I work for has an upstairs and a downstairs, I work downstairs in the kitchen with four other coworkers and we have a dining area where vaccinated people can sit and eat. We have a bar upstairs where nonvaccinated people can sit and also where the incident took place.

We stop serving food at 8:00 PM and whatever is left is put on the heating racks for guests to take as all the food served here is grab and go. We start to clean the kitchen, restock the cooler, collect trash from the tables and floor, and wipe down tables in the dining area. I ended up finishing around 8:30 PM, so I decided to take some cleaning supplies upstairs and help one of my coworkers clean up in the bar. There were three guests still up in the bar, CG (Calm guy), DG (Drunk guy), and his friend as well as my coworker, the three of them were sitting in the front while she was standing behind the register talking to them and serving drinks. CG saw me while I was collecting trash, wiping down the tables, and stacking chairs and decided to chat with me for a bit.

CG: Hey man!

OP: Hey, what's up?

CG: Nothin' much, I've just never seen you here before. Did you transfer from another resort in Colorado or something?

OP: (Joking around) I sure did and it's beautiful, with all of the beautiful forests, mountains, and the blistering cold winters! ;)

CW: (Laughing) No you didn't OP, stop messing around!

OP: I'm joking, I lived in \[*state name*\] my entire life!

CG: Oh (Laughing), So do you like working for \[*Resort name*\]?

OP: Yes, I really enjoy my job and I love working here!

That's when DG started talking, and he obviously had a little too much to drink, I think I even saw him almost tip over at one point.

DG: YeAh YoU BeTtEr LiKe \[*Resort name*\].

OP: Uh, I do-

DG: NaH, I'm NoT FiNiShEd, AnYoNe WhO HaTeS \[*Resort Name*\] Is A F\*CkInG DoUcHeBaG! AnD If AnYoNe TeLlS YoU It SuCkS, YoU BeAt ThE ShIt OuT Of ThEm!

OP: Um, sure...

Then this guy kept going on other rants about people hating \[*Resort name*\], how they suck, etc. I just kept agreeing with this guys rants because one thing I know for sure, never argue with drunk people and I thought this was the best way to calm him down and defuse anything. I've read plenty of reddit stories to know this and just common sense because you never know what people are capable of. Drunk people have been known to get violent and I've never been in a situation like this and I definitely didn't want to start now. DG ended up turning his attention to CG though and I thought that was the end of his rants, Boy was I wrong.

I didn't pay attention to their argument because I was occupied with cleaning the rest of the tables and finishing up for the night. I could still hear DG's rants get louder and louder while CW was trying to ask him to calm down, but he just ignored her. Suddenly out of the corner of my eye, I saw DG try to walk up and swing at CG while his friend held him back which got mine and CW's attention.

CW: OP go find a manager, this is getting out of hand!

OP: (Shocked) Uh, okay!

I couldn't find any managers though (Guess they all went home for the night), the place was completely empty so I rushed to the kitchen and informed two of my coworkers of the situation. The three of us quickly rushed back upstairs and saw DG still trying to go after CG while he's leaving and his friend tried to calm him down. After a few minutes, DG finally calmed down (so I thought) then he and his friend ended up leaving around 9:00 PM (closing time). All four of us stood their giving each other a WTF look, but we just laughed the situation off and finished cleaning the bar. We finished around 9:30 PM, clocked out, said goodnight to one another, and went home for the night but I didn't expect the aftermath of the incident, I'm still shocked typing this out.

The next day I went into work, brewed fresh coffee, preheated the deep fryers and pizza ovens, and dumped ice in the pop fountain machine. One of my managers pulled me aside and asked if I was okay to which I said yes and asked him why and gave me a rundown of what happened after that night. Turns out DG from that night had a gun with him after I drove home at 9:30 PM and tried shooting at CG but missed several times because of how drunk he was, police we're called and he was arrested. I didn't witness that part but I was absolutely floored when I heard that, the first thing on my mind was "I'm glad I wasn't there when the shooting happened." So the trial won't happen until August and I have to attend and give a testimony, so if anything crazy happens at the trial, I'll be sure to update on this incident. Thanks for reading!

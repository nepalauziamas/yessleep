7-8 years ago I was in a bad place. I had just graduated college and was working my first job out of school but living in my Dad's basement in order to save money, preparing for life as an adult. In college I picked up some bad habits and despite graduating school and finding a decent job I was holding down - I was a drug addict. I include this part so there is a way for you to write off what I witnessed. That being said being high was nothing new to me and nothing even close to this had ever happened before or since. I'm happy to say I've been clean for half a decade now.

So where I grew up was a very nice house in a suburb that was a bit secluded. We didn't have a neighborhood, only one other house on our road, but when you leave the dirt road that led to our cul de sac you'd be within less then a mile from plenty of McMansion neighborhoods. So the house was secluded in the woods but the area was very far from rural.

Well after my dog Shadow died we started getting a huge herd of deer sleeping in our yard every night. After a while they got so used to me when I went out to smoke a cigarette they'd just lift their heads and look at me and then go back to sleep. It was pretty cool I'd smoke my cig and just watch these animals that are usually extremely hard to get close too.

Well one night I'm feeling cute. So I start doing a little dance, more of a jig, on my front porch to see if the deer would do anything or react in any way. I wasn't making any noise or attempting to approach them, just doing something much different then what our usual routine had been. I was kind of surprised as to how they reacted. After they started noticing what I was doing they just stood up, looked at me, and walked away to the other side of the yard. I've never seen deer behave like that. It was almost like they were annoyed with me. I wouldn't of been to surprised if they had run (and I'm glad they didn't due to the roads around) but a calm walk away? Didn't see it coming. I don't know what I was thinking at the time.

This is when shit went nuts. Remember the old Jurassic Park movies when the T-Rex was coming? Each step it took you'd hear this huge \*boom\* followed by the ground shaking? Out in the woods  (maybe 200 yards away from the porch) in the front yard, minus the ground shaking, I heard one of those booms one after another sound like huge massive foot steps. At this point the noise sounded really far away so I was more curious then anything staring out in the darkness hoping I could see what was causing it. I turned the flash light on my cell phone but it was way to far away to give me a view of anything and as I'm staring I just hear off in the distance \*boom boom\*.......\*boom boom\*......\*boom boom\* and then without warning the far off sound went from being off in the distance to sounding like it was heading straight towards me, and heading towards me extremely quickly. I threw my cigarette to the ground and darted back into the house as the nearest "booms" sounded like they were happening right in front of my porch.

After about 10 minutes I realized how insane this was. So I grabbed a flash light and went outside to the edge of the woods to see if I could see anything that it could of been. There was nothing. No foot prints, no animals, nothing that I could possibly conceived that could of caused the sound. My personal theory? I was fucking with a lower form of life in a way that didn't put it in any danger but made it feel uncomfortable for at best nothing more then a laugh. Something out there decided to do the same thing to me.

Activity Log 1: This is unit 14, Dr. Louise Bryce recording day 1’s data and research log. I am Louise Bryce, born in Columbus, Ohio. I have a master’s degree in Marine Biology, a Bachelor’s in biomechanics, alongside experience in working with new species and their discovery. I have been chosen carefully for this mission, which will be referred to as Project Sepnus. I am currently stationed in a habitat designed to withstand extreme pressure at the bottom of the Mariana Trench. I am currently over 35,000 feet below the surface of the ocean, surrounded completely by darkness. The fall has lightly damaged the interior of my habitat but will be repairable and habitable nonetheless. 

This recording will be the end of day one for me. I have been here for over 6 hours and am excited to explore the depths. The purpose of Project Sepnus is to explore and investigate the depths of the trench, hoping to discover new chemical and medical-related properties along the way. Tomorrow is the beginning of a new dawn, the first time anyone will ever swim in water this deep. My equipment includes a temperature-powered hyper-bright flashlight, multiple tools for self-protection as well a collection of samples and a syntactic foam bodysuit, allowing me to withstand the pressures of the water around me. Updates will continue as follows. Day 2, Week One, Month One, Month 2, Month 3 and so forth until I feel that my exploration has reached its limits. End Communication.

Activity Log 2: This is unit 14, Dr. Louise Bryce recording day 7’s data and research log. The week has been rather eventful and has shown great potential in our discoveries. I explored the area surrounding me, including the hydrothermal vents scattered around my location. The location of the habitat is approximately 40 meters from the true depth of the trench. I am sitting at exactly 35,127 feet of depth, overlooking the maximum depth of 36,201 feet. My area of exploration has proved fruitful to our expectations, verifying multiple hypotheses about the pressure’s effect on minerals and organisms alike. I have discovered multiple new species of flora and fauna, which have proved to have extremely interesting ways of adapting to pressure and temperature change. 

Multiple florae have shown signs of developing defence mechanisms to prevent their own consumption from surrounding fauna. I am yet to receive any transmission for naming anything but will refer to most flora and fauna by my own made-up and simplistic names for the time being. The most interesting of the flora would have to be what I will call Botras. Botras take on an appearance like that of a sunflower, but with rather flashy colours, including multiple shades of neon variants with its bioluminescence. These florae have extremely short stems, with thick and strong roots clinging to the ocean floor below. None show signs of horizontal growth, gaining some sort of energy by facing the surface exclusively. These florae have an active defence system, working as a stabbing mechanism to any possible approaching predators. I nearly learnt the hard way upon approaching it and will continue to practice more safe approaches while examining these beings. 

The first fauna I have come across will be referred to as Worions. These passive vegetarian faunas tend to stick to the ocean floor, feeding on the bacteria and microorganisms that live on it. These creatures are clearly the bottom feeders in this ecosystem, as I’ve found their remains in multiple locations surrounding the habitat. These creatures have a transparent, membrane-like layer of skin covering basic organs and cartilage-like bones. Their skin is made to specifically avoid reflecting any light, allowing itself to hide from whatever preys on it. Before I end the communication, I’d also like to share my findings of something rather odd. When inspecting the hydrovents, a loud rumbling could be heard closer to the maximum depth and the cliff that overlooks it. I am completely unaware of its origin, but it can be heard in consistent pulses when near the edge. I will update the activity log on my findings as I progress through this ecosystem. End Communication. 

Activity Log 3: This is unit 14, Dr. Louise Bryce recording day 30’s data and research log. I have discovered multiple sets of organisms, and am beginning to form a full food chain for the trench. In brief explanations, I have found 3 different flora and 6 fauna. The 3 flora will remain nameless as they perform simple but surprisingly beneficial tasks. The 3 flora seem to convert nitrogen and sulphur into beneficial bacteria and nutrients through a filter-like function located in what appears to be an aquatic flower. I have gathered multiple samples of these unidentified nutrients as well as taken seeds from each plant found. The fauna all have basic functions in this ecosystem, mostly playing the role of basic predator and prey. The most notable have been the only 2 predators found thus far. 

The first predator will be referred to as the Mari Shark. Named after this trench, this predator uses its triangular fins to push itself off the ocean floor. The Mari Shark possesses a crimson and gray colour, invulnerable to light and appearing in mixed patches over its thick body. This appearance and behaviour are used to corner or attack fauna, using a Goblin-Shark-like jaw to launch its short, barbed teeth at prey. This fauna has been found most commonly around a full length of 9 feet and appears to be uninterested in my presence. I discovered this fauna as a carcass at first, clearly falling victim to a much bigger predator. 

The second predator discovered will be referred to as a Sea Raven. This ray-like predator sends gusts of water towards its prey in order to disorient it. It tends to swim wherever it feels fit, not sticking to a consistent location. This creature has also been seen laying eggs near different flora, not having any specific reproductive parts. 

To follow up on the pulses near the edge, the rumbling is beginning to grow louder. The depth of the noise itself is causing vibrations on the edge of the cliff, being the reasoning behind a near-death experience. As the rumbling grew louder, the structure below me began to crumble, nearly expelling me into the depth itself. I will continue to explore the cause of the rumbling. End Communication.

Activity Log 4: This is unit 14, Dr. Louise Bryce recording day 60’s data and research log. I have discovered multiple new florae of minor significance alongside 2 and a possible 3rd fauna. The rumbling has grown loud enough that I can hear it 30 feet away from the cliff, vibrating the flora around me. The habitat is beginning to grow multiple different species of flora on its exterior, which resulted in a requirement for basic maintenance in order to keep the lights going. Aside from adaptive flora, I have discovered something alarming yet intriguing. Across the cliff, I can see what appears to be a set of lights like mine, as well as a larger light hanging into the depth. The darkness shouldn’t allow this, but it's clearly something worth exploring. Alongside the lights, the habitat’s surroundings are showing signs of possible human contact in the past. Multiple scratches and patterns can be found along the walls of the trench, showing odd signals and what could possibly be lettering. 

The 2 fauna discovered are both of a neutral hostility class, being omnivores as well as one showing the signs of mammal birthing patterns. This first new species of aquatic life could very well mean a source for cloning or reproductive revelations, and the creature is beautiful. This creature will be referred to as Hamas. With a tough hide of scales, Hamas have a rather intimidating appearance, complete with short fangs and claw-like appendages in random numbers sprouting from the abdomen. The most appendages seen on an adult Hamas were what I have counted to be 13. These creatures can grow up to 26 feet long and are completely passive to my presence. 

The second fauna has…My apologies, it sounded as if something were knocking on the habitat. I’ll just skip to the possible 3rd fauna. This creature was spotted swimming directly above the habitat upon returning from more exploration. It seemed to be directly hostile to anything around it, tearing the carcass of a Sea Raven to pieces. It made odd squeaking and rattle-like noises while eating, being larger than the habitat itself. For reference, the habitat is approximately 10 feet tall, with 2 rooms dedicated to my living and experiments. The creature sat on the experimental habitat, draping what appeared to be a thick tail over the window of the room. It had black colouring with spots of white along its hide and could very well be over 80 feet long. I slowly approached the habitat, unaware of what could possibly happen upon being noticed. In regards to the lights across the cliff, they stand in the same location, still without any features. The rumbling has slowed its pace slightly, however now sending visible ripples into the water above it. End Communication. 

Activity Log 5: This is unit 14, Dr. Louise Bryce recording day 93’s data and research log. It has been a rather eventful past month, with multiple happenings that could very well affect my own safety. Soon after recording last month’s log, the habitat was blocked in by the creature I’d seen before. I have now seen its face and can now confirm that this creature has to be the apex predator of this trench. After approaching the habitat, I hid from the view of the window and watched through my hiding spot as it appeared to investigate my location. The creature’s face has a sloped, cylinder-like connection to its body, like that of an eel. Its face is composed of a massive mouth that extends in a humanoid way across the face, containing god knows how many teeth. The creature also showed some form of unorthodox senses, appearing to be listening or smelling with a large flap of skin extending around the base of its face, folding out into a direct sphere to possibly intimidate prey. Next to the 2 black eyes, it possesses, are 2 bioluminescent spots, appearing to even project an actual light into its surroundings. Needless to say, this creature poses a threat to my location and my own safety. I have limited some exploration due to this circumstance but have done further discoveries on bacteria and other organisms. Upon taking fauna into the habitat, their forms have changed drastically. 

I have sent pictures through transmission and have received proper instruction on how to proceed with sampling. I have discovered some of the fauna to be edible and some to even contain psychedelic effects on the human mind. Some of these effects are Audible and Visual hallucination, extreme visualization of surrounding audio, and basic disorientation. After consuming Worions, these effects have been present in myself. They wear off after about 7 hours, but leave for a hungover state, including headaches and body pain. The most common hallucinations experienced were lights passing through the window as well as knocking on the habitat. I am requesting immediate dismissal after I send my next transmission. End Communication.

Activity Log 6: This is unit 14, Dr. Louise Bryce recording day 94’s data and research log. I have finished my exploration and am requesting extraction and dismissal from my post here. I have not received transmissions from IPO in over 2 weeks and am unaware of the reasoning behind the lack of communication, but worry for my safety. 

I will be sending 2 more activity logs to ensure my extraction is in progress. En- (unintelligible deep vocalizing from unknown source)d Communication.

Activity Log 7: This is unit 14, Dr. Louise Bryce recording day 95’s data and research log. I still await extraction but will continue to inform you of the happenings. I left the habitat soon after the last log and discovered something odd. 2 of the lights on the other side are now completely non-existent, only having the presence of the middle one left. Alongside this, the sudden intensity of the growling. (knocking on habitat can be heard in distance) What the hell is that? I’m not just hearing things, am I? I could’ve sworn I heard some knocking from behind me. Regardless, the rumbling is now growing in intensity and is beginning to show signs of a possible intelligent life form providing the source of it. The growling has been forming full words with morse code, none having any significance to my location. I will send another activity log tomorrow, with a full record of the morse code. E- (Growling morse code translating to: ***ABANDONED***)nd Communication.

Activity Log 8: This is unit 14, Dr. Louise Bryce recording day 96’s data and research log. I yet again await extraction but will continue to inform you of the happenings. The third light is now missing from across the depth. I am completely unaware of its whereabouts but am beginning to grow paranoid about its connection to the growl. As I discovered the light going out, the morse code began to become even faster. Upon the first day, I was able to record the following words and numbers. ***GRASS NEEDS 13 DECEASED MARKET***

I am completely unaware of the meaning behind the words but more has been said and show meaning. ***ABANDONED LIGHT DEEP 13 13 13*** The number 13 was repeated 3 times, alongside the numbers 1-14 being repeated 4 times. 2 of these words apply to the current situation, guaranteeing intelligent life forms creating these noises, those words being light and deep. I will update you once more tomorrow, that is if you’re on your way. End Communication. 

Activity Log 9: This is unit 14 and I’m starting to get really pissed off. Where the hell are you guys? You told me this was a two-way mission and I’m starting to think it was a load of bullshit. Look, I’m sorry to be rude here, but my safety is at risk. The lights are back again but I’m not sure how. This time they are appearing far closer, almost as if they’re floating over the cliff. They’re fully visible from the window of the habitat, shining over the edge of the full depth. The growling has completely paused for some reason and- oh my god. What in the hell? The lights are gone again. They keep randomly disappearing without control. I’m in no mood to investigate, but I’ll watch. (knocking can be heard from different spots of the habitat)Since this is an audio recording, you can’t see what I’m seeing, but it's really weird. The lights are flickering in the habitat but in a really weird way. Oh no. End Communication.

Activity Log 10: This is unit 14 requesting immediate help and extraction. (sobbing) It's staring through the window and hasn’t moved all day. I’ve kept the lights off after the flickering and can only see because of the bioluminescence. Please come get me, I’m begging. Please send someone, please. Please, I’ll do anything. (sobbing intensifies) Please, I have a family. I just want to see my wife again, please. (deep growling pulses twice) Please help me, I just want to go home. (sobbing stops, gasping begins.) (in a whisper) Its lights went out and I don’t know why, please come help. E- (Growling morse code translating to: ***LEFT US 13 ABANDONED)*** nd Communication. 

Activity Log 11: This is unit 14, it's now day 99. The creature is still in its same spot, waiting for me to do something, it knows I’m here. You rich assholes just send us in to do your dirty work, tell us you’ll bring us back out once we’re done, but you lied. This was a sham from the beginning. You don’t care about your workers, you leave us to die. (sobbing) I was supposed to help the world, and share my findings to revolutionize medicine. **YOU GODDAMN LIARS. YOU LIED TO ME, I’M GONNA DIE DOWN HERE.** (sobbing intensifies) It heard me, I’m dead. It moved away from the habitat but it's coming back, there’s no doubt in my mind. (growling starts morse code again) The growling’s back, it's saying something. It's saying…13 of us? What on earth does that mean? 13 of us. It's saying something else, hold on. It said…number 14. Number 14, unit 14? Wait. 13 of us? It all makes sense now. I'm the 14th poor bastard you’ve sent down here, aren’t I? Do you just wait for us to die and move on to the next candidate? You bunch of pricks think you run everything, don’t you? I’m never getting out of here. (sobbing) **PLEASE JUST KILL ME, COME BACK ALREADY. I CAN’T TAKE IT ANYMORE.** (knocking on habitat) I’ve had it, what is that damned knocking noise. I’m going to the window.

Oh my god. There are carcasses stacked outside of the habitat, that’s what the knocking has been. Body parts, **HUMAN BODY PARTS. UNIT 7, UNIT 3, THEY’RE ALL HERE.** (louder bump) **ITS COME BACK.** (crashing and screaming) <Communication ended>

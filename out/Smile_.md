27 March 2018 the date this happened.

I recently found an audio recording in my grandparents house, they recently passed away so I was told that I should clean the house so they could sell it and while I was cleaning I found the recording it goes like this.

"Hey there, im Lucas I think today was a really nice day, I really enjoyed school and stuff but im kinda worried about Spanish test since im not really good in this stuff but anyways forgetting that I gotta do my homework so I guess I'll see you later.

Im back :), its been a few hours maybe around 3 or 2 so its around 8 pm but my parents aren't home and I've done all my homework so I guess i can finally play with my friends online or something, I'll see you later.

Wow, time went really fast its 11 pm now but im really hungry so im going to go eat something.  

Im back but im kinda scared, I heard some noises outside and I don't know what it was, guess I gotta go and check, so my parents don't get mad hehe.

Im back again, im really scared now there was blood all over my trash can it was a horrible sight im pretty sure i saw someone there or something, im not sure cause the thing was really tall and it was crouched over something or someone. Gonna go lock my doors and windows cause thing is so fucking cursed.

Im back, something is really wrong I just heard my mom come in my house even tho she told me she would take a little longer to get here I guess its fine.

My mom just called me, she told me if I was awake I told her "yea why?" she sounded relieved when she told me that she was coming home soon and that I shouldn't worry, when I started to ask "why" I suddenly got interrupted by a really loud sound coming from the kitchen, a pan or a tray just fell I shouldn't worry I told myself cause I was thinking that someone was in my house right now pretending to be my mom even tho she isn't even home yet, I returned to the call and I told my mom how longer for her to get here, she told me around 5 minutes since she was just around the block I felt relieved and I told her I would wait for her so i should wait now.

My mom just arrived she told me she was home and I feel so relieved now,I told her I was going down so I'll be back in a few."


In this part you can hear the kid screaming.


"HOLY SHIT, AS SOON AS I WAS GOING DOWN I HEARD SCREAMS, BLOOD CURLING SCREAMS, I WENT DOWN AS FAST AS I COULD AND THERE WAS THIS CREATURE I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE ACTUAL FUCK IT WAS IT WAS AROUND 10 FEET TALL AND WAS EATING MY MOM OR SOME SHIT, LITERALLY JUST TAKING OUT HER ORGANS AND JUST EATING THEM HE SLOWLY TURNED AROUND AND I COULD SEE ITS FACE IT WAS SO DISGUSTING IT WAS COVERED IN BLOOD AND SMILING LIKE A FUCKING MANIAC, IM SO SCARED NOW, I RAN BACK TO MY ROOM AS FAST AS I COULD but it heard me and saw me so now im guessing its coming for me.

I can hear it knocking now, its saying something but I can't recognize what it's saying, I can feel he is going to enter soon, I just have this feeling I should do something but im too scared, the same way I was so scared and paralyzed when I saw that thing eating my mother.

OH NO IT BROKE THE DOOR I CAN SEE HIM NOW HES WALKING SLOWLY TOWARDS ME I CAN'T MOVE IM TOO SCARED.

HELP PLEASE, HE OPENED MY STOMACH ITS BLEEDING IT HURTS A LOT HELP PLEASE STOP I CAN'T TAKE IT."

Thats the last thing that is heard, after that its just static and stuff but now its too late I can feel it coming for me im in my room writing this for someone to read it one day and know its coming for me, my time has run out and I know what it's saying, it's saying SMILE :)

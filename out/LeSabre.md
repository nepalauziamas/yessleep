"So...anyway...my aunt Millie had an extra finger on each hand and lost them both in separate chainsaw accidents but she didn't seem to mind much.......hey! Are you even listening to me?" He tugged on my sleeve as he asked.


"What!?"


"MY AUNT MILLIE HAD AN EX..."


"Are you fucking kidding me right now!?" I yelled incredulously.


There was a metallic ringing in my ears, no, it was in my head. I couldn't catch my breath. My brain was on the verge of crashing from trying to process all the information pouring in and this guy hasn't even looked up.


*Wait...that young couple three seats down. Was it that close? Jesus Christ. They were right there. Now... They were somewhere behind a concrete wall with a huge hole in it. What do I do? I can't think....air!....brains need air to work. Breathe man! Breathe!!*


I vacuumed air into my lungs like taking that first breath after being underwater for as long as you can hold your breath.


What I was looking at started to make some sort of rudimentary sense. A vehicle of some kind had crashed through the front window of the coffee shop I had stopped at for breakfast. By the looks of the scene in front of me, I was lucky to be alive.


The window, counter, stools and young couple who only seconds ago were seated at the counter, muffling cruel laughter with their hands over their mouths as they, loud enough for me to hear, made fun of people in the shop. None of those obstacles had any effect on the vehicle's velocity. I knew the make and model of the car instantly. It could have been my very first car's twin. A car I had loved so much I cried a little when it died and my only option was to sell it to a scraper. It was an old, dark green Buick LaSabre. It was covered in rubble and roughly 3/4 of the way through the huge hole it had made in the concrete wall behind the counter. All I could see was the back end.


*I'm ok...I think. Yea I'm ok.* I took another deep breath *yup I'm just fine* I wasn't but I was miraculously scratch-free.


"Are you ok?" I asked the comically oblivious man next to me. He violently jerked his head towards me to meet my gaze. For some reason he looked angry. Everyone reacts to traumatic events in their own way, I guess. It wouldn't be a mystery for long, I was about to hear the reason for his anger whether I wanted to or not.


"Look man, I'm a pretty big deal around here, I don't have to be here talking to you...I got tons of friends in this town." 


*He's definitely angry and somehow, I'm the source of it. What bothers me more is that it still doesn't seem like he's noticed the car crash that just happened 10 feet from the pancake and syrup soup he had left on his plate. Does this guy just have zero situational awareness? Could he be partially blind? He's definitely not deaf. Was this some weird joke? Am I on a fucking prank show?* I got out as many words as I could before he cut me off 


"Did you not just see or hea....!"


"Is standing up, turning your back and then yelling at people the polite way to end a conversation back on your home world!?" He barked


I had known this lunatic for about 15 minutes. He was a large man, vertically and horizontally. How he squeezed between the stool and counter is a question better left to physicists or maybe makers of expanding mattresses in boxes. 


He was around 6'7, well over 300 lbs, maybe 400. He was bald on top with a greasy black hair around the back of his head that cascaded down his ample neck fat. He was wearing a Bob's Burgers T-shirt that was way too small for him. That shirt was the ignition source of this fiery conversation. I said I liked his shirt because I love that show, I am now wishing I had never seen it. 


"I'm out of here, I.....don't fucking need this!" 


His words seemed slightly impeded by the visible tears in his eyes he was holding back. Was he in shock? He stood up, pulled out his wallet, threw a few bills on the counter to pay for his meal and then slammed a few more on the counter in front of where I was sitting, I assumed, to pay for mine.


"Better man!" he proclaimed proudly, pointing both of his thumbs towards himself. He turned and walked towards the door with all the grace and agility of a new born hippo and left.


*How do I even react to that?* My mouth was wide open and my face was contorted into an almost painful look of disbelief. I kept my eyes on him so if he decided to come back, I'd have some time to start running. He was big but I was fairly certain I could outrun him.


The big guy made it to his car, an old, dark green Buick LeSabre. What are the odds? Nowhere near impossible but unlikely enough that the more imaginative parts of my brain were trying to assign some sort of deep meaning to this somewhat unlikely coincidence. 


I hope he's ok, I hope he makes it home.


I saw it out of the corner of my eye first, one of those things that your brain immediately knows is wrong and will turn out to be something totally different and normal once you turn your full focus towards it. I turned my head but nothing changed...I froze


*It made no sense...that car it...what the hell is happening?* The coffee shop was now in the exact condition it was in when I first walked through the door. The customers were eating and laughing like nothing happened. The counter and wall behind it were both completely intact. *Did I imagine it all? Have I finally completely lost it?*


The ringing in my head had changed. It was the same volume but seemed to have a different pitch. 


I suddenly realized how crazy I looked. As still as water in a glass, standing in the middle of a crowded coffee shop, staring, slack-jawed at the counter like it was a magic counter that could be smashed into pieces and then heal itself. Which obviously it couldn't be.


*I've got to get out of here, I need to see many doctors immediately.* I started towards the door.


"Yup...that's perfect" I said to myself out loud. The green LeSabre was back. He may have come to back to apologize but I sincerely doubted it. It didn't matter, I needed strong psychiatric medication and for this place to become a confusing memory I could come to terms with later, most likely in a place with soft walls. I pulled my hood up over my head, covering as much of my face as possible. I dropped my head and broke into a sprint-walk that would only seem casual in a meth house. I pushed the door open, turned left and headed down the sidewalk towards my car. *So far so good.* I pulled my keys from my pocket and unlocked my car's doors with the fob. I had my hand on the door handle when I heard it.


Laughter, evil laughter. Judgement filled snickering dripping with teen angst. The type of laughter that can only come from humor at the expense of others. 


The vibration now seemed to be cycling through many different pitches with rising speed but it wasn't irritating. I couldn't place the time or place but I was sure I'd heard, more accurately, felt this variety of frequencies before.


Turning around was the last thing I wanted to do right now but I don't think I really had a choice, I had to see the source of the laughter. I turned my head slightly...The split second it took to turn my head towards the laughter felt like an eternity, during which, the last hope I had for a life on the outside of a mental institution was slowly but completely obliterated.


It was the young couple from the coffee shop. Now laughing at full volume, otherwise, the exact same people, in the exact same clothes. The same couple I had just witnessed doing a "kool-aid man" through a concrete wall. *If there was no crash, how did I hallucinate them before ever seeing them? Am I crazy and psychic?*


It was definitely them. They were alive, well and horrible. I had looked just in time to see them getting out of an old, dark green Buick LeSabre...with the same license plates as my first car. 


I rubbed my eyes and looked at the plates again. There was no doubt about it, it was the same plate number, issued in the same province with the same numbers missing paint. I shifted my attention to the car itself. Every scratch was the same, every dent even the headliner was ripped from when I had to force my bike into the back seat. *This really is my old car! She's alive!*


I had no idea how this could be possible. For a moment I was filled with joy and forgot about everything but the LeSabre. I breifly had the thought that I should see if the couple would be willing to sell it and how much they wanted for it, not that the price mattered. 


The moment passed quickly and the good feeling once again turned to panic. I had to get out of there. This could be another weird hallucination and I needed medical attention almost as much as oxygen at that point.


I was now physically touching the car; it was definitely there. Everything logical in my brain was screaming at me to get in my current car and not even look at the rear-view mirror until I was in the next state but I knew the second I saw the plates that I wasn't going anywhere.


That car was mine and I needed answers. If my future really did entail straight jackets, padded cells and spending my days drooling in front of a tv, I at least wanted to know how this could be possible.


The vibration was much louder at this point and every once in a while, I swear I could hear a voice in the jumble of seemingly random noise.


I gritted my teeth and walked back up to the coffee shop. I wanted to enter with some authority, I didn't want the couple to see any fear in my face or demeanor and decide I'm someone that could be fucked with. I pulled open the door, hard, when it hit the end of the path it travels, it just fell off the hinges and shattered all over the sidewalk. I felt bad but I had cash, I could pay for it. It didn't matter right now. 


I looked up from the broken glass and back towards the couple but they were gone...everyone was gone...everything was gone. The entire coffee shop, along with everyone in it and their cars had vanished.


I was standing in the middle of a dirt lot. I could see fields of corn and a few farm houses in the distance but I was the only thing in that lot besides my car and...the LeSabre.


I hear a voice. It was sort of like metal grinding on metal but in a way that was soothing, it was almost musical. It was so faint I couldn't make out a single syllable or where it was coming from. The voice got incrementally louder and I realized I wasn't hearing the voice; I was feeling it. The vibrations were all over my body, I could feel it in my toes, my legs, up my spine and reverberating in my skull. I had no idea what was happening. 


I suddenly didn't care that I was completely insane in the middle of nowhere. I was no longer scared or anxious. The vibration seemed to be calming me down.


The vibrations in my body faded, everywhere but in my head. The voice was clearing up, like the sound of slowly tuning a radio from static to a radio station. It was metallic yet sweet, almost angelic like the highest singers in a church choir. It was now clear enough to hear.


"Hey, sorry for the theatrics but you wouldn't look at my plates. I really missed you. Want to go for a ride?"


The driver side door of the LeSabre swung open. Without fear or hesitation, I got into the car. It was like sliding into old shoes after a day of breaking in new ones. Everything was exactly how I remembered. I was so happy. A single joyful tear rolled down my cheek.


I looked back at where the coffee shop used to be. That whole ordeal now felt like it happened in a different life, like it happened to someone else. I looked down at the steering column and turned the key. The LeSabre roared to life, we pulled out of the lot and started down the road together.

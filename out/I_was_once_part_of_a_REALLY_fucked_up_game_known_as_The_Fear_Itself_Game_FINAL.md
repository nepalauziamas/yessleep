The alarm buzzed. This time, for the first time, I was actually scared to go to sleep. More than that, I was afraid of actually waking up.

The air rushed through overhead again. I braced myself, waiting to be forced asleep, thrown into whatever freakshow I was slated for next. But nothing came.

I waited for about another ten minutes with nothing happening. I realized then that it wasn't for me, not this time. It wasn't time for the 'Nexus round' yet, I guess. I then saw two gorilla sized men in gas masks and body armor stomp down the hallway to a few of the other cells at the other far end. I watched them open up and drag the unconscious bodies of the R, G, and L contestants out and back down the hall where they came.

I just watched numbly as they were dragged along. It was like how an animal would watch as one of their kin were being led to the slaughter. They'd know what would happen, that they'd never see them alive again, but at the same time, what the fuck were *they* gonna do about it? So they'd just sit and watch, praying they won't be the next in line.

That said, the question presented itself to me again. What kept *them* going? What was keeping them from just hitting the "Fuck this" button and giving up, succumbing willingly to whatever they'd been subjected to? Did they, too, have someone they were afraid of losing?

These questions buzzed around wildly in my head for at least the better part of an hour. Though, being honest here, it felt even longer than that to me. Longer or not, though, My thoughts on this would be cut short when I'd hear the intercom buzz again.

***"Give it up for Contestant R, everybody!"*** Sounds of crowd cheering played, this time, though, sounding like whatever device they'd been coming from was just about out of juice. Web's own voice even sounded noticeably less enthusiastic than it had been.

***"We're almost at the end, folks! Only four of you left. So far, only one has made it all the way to 'The Judgement round'. So, the question for now is, who will contest them for the $50,000 grand prize? In just a few minutes, we'll be finding out in our next, and last, 'Nexus round'!"***

Like before, the intercom went silent after that. Only about two seconds later, the noise from the intercom was replaced by the noise from the door to the hallway opening, followed by the elephantine stomping of the men from before, dragging the sleeping body of Contestant R back to the cell at the far end of the room.

Once they'd dumped him back in his cell, the men then just stood in the middle of the hallway. They were waiting. I was, too. Like she'd said, we were almost at the end. In about another half hour, I heard the alarm sound, followed by the now all too familiar sound of the ventilation. *"This is it..."* I thought as my eyelids drooped heavily. Soon, I was out like a light again.

**\*\*\***

This was the first time since starting the game that waking up felt different. It felt peaceful. Quiet. No imminent danger like from before.

Maybe I shouldn't call it "peaceful". Quiet, sure, but not peaceful. To me, peaceful would've at least implied that all was safe. That nothing around was gonna hurt me. I knew far better than that, though. No, I knew it was only a matter of time before something; I didn't know *what*, but *SOMETHING*, would come out and ambush me. The only question I had, was what and/or where it was.

The second key difference now, though, was that Director Web hadn't made her little announcement yet, either. I say this to say, the silence agitated and somewhat frightened me more. At least If I *had* woke up to immediate danger, I'd have actually half expected it. But here, I couldn't. Here, I felt exposed. Vulnerable... *As vulnerable as I was in my cell with the 'Bitch Widow'.*

Then, almost an hour later, allowing for this disturbingly quiet environment to settle in, I heard the blare of the intercom.

**"Here we are, folks, the 'Fear Itself' game's last 'Nexus round'"** Crowd cheering sounded all through the current room once again. Lights then flicked on and I then saw that I wasn't in an empty room after all. Instead, it was actually a gigantic labyrinth.

I stood up slowly. Placing my hands on the walls, as well as the floor below me, I felt them to be solid steel. I could also feel some sort of movement behind the walls as well, like the whirring of some kind of machinery. It was moving all around, moving both from the walls and floor at the same time.

***"You three are the only ones left who've made it this far! Now, whoever makes it out of here will join Contestant V in 'The Judgement round' to decide who will be crowned the 'Conquerer of 'Fear Itself'!"*** The excited crowd played out again as I felt an electric shock jolt through me from the floor. Despite the steel walls, I heard Shrieks of fright coming from around me from the other two contestants.

***"Oops, Sorry."*** She said, chuckling along with the laugh track. ***"Gotta keep y'all on your toes for this one! Your objective, contestants, is to make it to the center of the labyrinth. That's it, easy-peesy , right? Shouldn't take any of you more than about, oh, five, maybe six minutes to accomplish."***

Another electric discharge passed through the floor, causing me to jump and the others to cry out again. ***"But, of course, I'm not known for being real patient, and it's no fun for me to watch you slugs drag your fucking feet, so should you decide to fall behind, well..."*** This time, the shock was low voltage, freezing me in place as electricity shook all throughout my body. ***"Then I guess you'll just have to get used to being a human Christmas tree, won't you? Don't worry, though, I'll be on standby to get you moving along again if I see you falling behind. See, I CAN be generous if I wanna be."***

The Intercom beeped off after that. The round had officially begun. Six minutes to make it to the center if this giant metal maze. *"'Easy-peesy, right?'"*

I was urged forward by a jolt through the floor. It was a high voltage shock that sent me leaping forward almost two feet, though causing me to slam face-first into the wall in front of me. I heard a laugh track play out over the intercom. ***"Was it that shocking, Tiger? One jolt through your legs from me and you're falling for me hard."*** I heard her chuckle deviously before adding, ***"How sweet."***

I picked myself off the wall. *"Shit, This is bad."* I thought. It was just what I'd feared would happen; I'd opened the door for her to get inside my head and royally fuck me over. It was only a crack, sure, but for her, for the 'Bitch Widow', a crack was FAR more than enough. I closed my eyes, taking a deep breath. *"Just relax, Eric. Focus."*

Opening my eyes again, I started heading to the passage leading off to the right. From there, I broke into a jog until I got about five feet down the passage and came upon a two-way intersection. For a second, I stood, looking back and forth between the two passageways to see which one looked the most likely to actually lead me somewhere other than a dead end. Unfortunately, I underestimated just *how* impatient Web was because, next thing I knew, I felt another spark of electricity sent me hurling forward another three feet.

Apparently I wasn't the only one, either. I could hear one of the others cry out from my right. From how loud I heard it, whoever it was was closeby, just around the corner even. Sure enough, I was right. Stumbling around the corner was the guy who I vaguely recognized from the 'Danger floor' level as Contestant F.

I went over to him. He was wheezing and coughing, out of breath. "Are you okay?" I shouted to him.

He gasped and sputtered before saying "I can't... I can't keep on like this, man." I put his arm aound my shoulder.

"Come on, man, we gotta keep going!" He was too weak, though. Too exhausted. He looked up at me, wearing *THAT* look; the look of hopelessness.

"Why bother, man? She ain't gonna let us go. One way or another, we're just gonna end up --" He was cut short when a low voltage surge passed through the floor, electrocuting the both of us where we stood. This lasted for almost a full minute before finally ceasing, causing us to collapse to the floor. The intercom beeped again.

***"I'm not sure how I feel about you holding someone else like that, Tiger. Oh, I wonder how SHE'D feel if she saw you right now; that 'special someone' of yours..."***  She chuckled again before the intercom beeped off again.

My heart was pounding furiously now, and it wasn't the electricity either. No, it was panic. How did she know about her? Yeah, I slipped that there was someone special to me on the outside, but how could Web know it was a *she?*

*"Does she know who?!"*

I shook my head, *"FOCUS!"* I looked down to Contestant F. He was barely conscious. Time was running out. I was about to try and get Contestant F to his feet when I felt him feebly push against me, trying to push me away. "Come on!" I shouted. "We have to get out of here or we'll get fried!"

He just kept staring at me with his glazed eyes. Very faintly, I saw his mouth begin to move and I could hear him hoarsely whisper, "*G-Go... g-g-get o-out of heeerrree."* He slipped unconscious after that. I shook him to try and wake him up again, to try and get us moving again, but it was no use. I felt his neck, his pulse was fading.

I wanted to get him out of there, but I knew I'd never make it to the center in time. I wasn't gonna make it out in time, unless... Unless, of course...

*I left him.*

I was torn once again. What was I supposed to do? I didn't wanna leave him for dead like that, but at the same time, *I HAD to get out!* I had to make it out alive. I had to win.

*I had to save Vanessa!*

**\*\*\***

For a brief instant, I saw *THAT* face again; both on Contestant F and Vanessa. I saw it on them, and then on others; Contestant D, Contestant A, who I watched get shredded at the beginning in 'The Cradle', Contestant R, who was dragged gracelessly from 'The Danger floor', all of them, staring at me with *THAT* face. The face of despair.

The face of hopelessness.

*"Why bother, man? She ain't gonna let us go..."*

**\*\*\***

I shook my head. *"NO!"* I screamed internally. *"I can't lose now! I can do this! I can win!"* I started making a beeline down the passage and cut a sharp turn to the right. My heart was spiking. My eyes were wide. My blood was rushing.

*"I can win! I have to win! I have to save Vanessa! I have to help her live!"*

A few more turns in each direction, and there it was, the center. I could make it! I was gonna make it to the final round!

I could hear the hum of electricity kick up. Time was almost out. The floor started warming up beneath me. In just a few seconds, the entire floor would be nothing less than a hotbed, frying and barbequing the hell out of who or whatever was unlucky enough to still be standing on it.

I broke into a full on sprint the rest of the way to the door. Despite it being probably only a foot or two away, it felt like the passage kept stretching, pushing the door at the end farther and farther away from me as I ran. Still, I kept running and, finally, with *maybe* a second and a half to spare...

*I made it!*

**\*\*\***

I squinted. Everything around me was a blinding ocean of albino white. It hurt to open my eyes. It was quiet, too. Silent.

Slowly, my eyes strained to adjust to the harsh lighting. Once at least semi-clear, I saw that I was now in a long, alabaster hallway. I started walking slowly down. All around me was nothing, just blank, white walls. I kept walking until my feet started to ache. Still, there was nothing around anywhere. Empty.

Silent.

*"Where am I?"* I started violently when I heard the intercom beep.

***"Take a right, and stop at the door at the end of the hall."*** This time, her voice was hollow, monotone. Numb. I turned to my right and began walking. There it was, around the first corner, dead ahead at the end of the hall; the last door.

This was it; 'Judgement round'". I walked anxiously towards it. I was about to grab and throw the door open when I stopped. My hand was clutched around the handle, but for whatever reason I just... couldn't...

**\*\*\***

*"... when will this all be over?'"*

I see the faces again. All of them.

*"Why bother, man? She ain't gonna let us go. One way or another, we're just gonna end up dead in here anyway..."*

I see her. Vanessa. Her pale, sickly face. I see it start to decay, peeling like paper from her bones. Her eyes, her beautiful eyes, glaze over as she slips away.

*"Please Eric... Make it stop!"*

She then fades completely, crumbling to dust before my eyes.

*"Are you so scared that you'll lose them, that you'll break yourself in every way necessary just to hold onto them?"*

**\*\*\***

I screamed and threw the door open. On the other side, there sat a hospital bed, and in it was a little boy. Web stood at the right of it.

I froze, the adrenaline taking a moment to die back down. "Hey there, Tiger." Web said blankly. Her face was hollow. Dead, the way you'd imagine a puppet to look. I started looking around. I couldn't see anything or anyone waiting. Of course, like I'd seen so many times before in this place, that didn't mean anything. It was never that simple. There's something, *always something.*

*But what?*

"It's okay, there's nothing here." I looked at her. She turned and looked at the hospital bed, then to the boy. The boy then looked to me.

I looked at him and something clicked. His face, his smooth, round face, his dark, hazel eyes, They were just like hers. This was her little boy.

*The one she fought for.*

His eyes were glazed, the eyelids looking like it was just about all they could do to even stay open. I could hear the E.K.G. monitor beep quietly. "This is..."

"Yes." she said. "Yes he is. My little Brent." She stroked his cheek, her face still cold as ice. I walked up to the bed. I was still looking around the room to see what was hiding, what implements 'Bitch Widow' planned to surprise me with. I didn't believe her claim that there was "Nothing there". 

That said, I couldn't see any sort of implements of torture or anything like that. That was, except for when I saw a needle on her side of the bed. My eyes widened seeing that. *"Oh God, what's she got in there? Cyanide? Drugs? Truth serum?"* My heart began beating harder and harder again. 

"Calm down, Tiger." she said numbly. "I told you, there's nothing here to hurt you. That's not why you're here."

"Then why am I?" I asked, still tense. She kept her focus trained on the boy. 

"Because I need your help." I frowned at this.

"My... *Help?* With what?"

She ruffled the boy's hair, sighing heavily. "He's precious, isn't he?" I just kept looking at her. I didn't know what I was supposed to say. 

"He was always a sweet little boy. Brave and strong, even when I wasn't there for him. He was brave even when they hurt him. Even now, You can see it, can't you; the way he's fighting?" Her voice cracked as she said, "Mommy's little fighter."

I looked back to the boy. His face was pale and sunken. I realized he was sick. He was dying...

 Just like...

**\*\*\***

*She reaches out to me. "Please Eric... Make it end..."*

**\*\*\***

I shook my head. "But what am I here for? What am I supposed to do?"

She sighed again. "What I can't." 

"Huh?" 

"You're here; your final challenge, Tiger, is to do the one thing I'm afraid to do." She clutched the needle. My body tensed up as she held it up. "He shouldn't have to keep fighting anymore, should he?" 

"Wh-what happened to him?" The words seemed to almost jump from my mouth. She looked from the needle back to him, stroking his face again. Her eyes began to glisten. 

"I owed a lot of people a lot of money. We were literally sleeping in dumpsters in between the alleyways every night and I was lucky at the time to ever have any money to scrape together some food for Brent, here. So I started borrowing money from some very bad people. Of course, I figured so long as I could either do a few of their dirty little favors and give them back the money in pieces, that everything would be fine." 

"But it wasn't enough, was it?" I said. She shook her head. Her lips began to pucker and the tears were flowing freely down her cheeks. 

"And it never would be. On top of that, prices for food started to go up, which meant it was damn near impossible for me to afford anything. I kept putting myself further and further into debt, just to try and provide for him. Just so he could stay alive, live to maybe one day have a better future, you know?"

I looked to Brent again. I noticed then that he wasn't moving at all, save for the very faint rising and falling of his chest. Not even his eyes were moving. 

"But it didn't matter to them." she continued. "All that mattered to them was money. Money that, well... I couldn't give them. It didn't matter that I was just getting by in a miracle as it was. It didn't matter how much I sold myself off to random men just to *try* making even a *bit* of that money back. And worst of all..." her face melted in tears, *"They didn't care that he was just a little boy!"* She began sobbing quietly.

My heart stopped. I felt like my head was gonna spin right off my neck. This whole time, through everything I'd experienced up to the present, this was probably the most viscerally haunting moment I'd ever experienced. To this day, it still is one of the most emotionally damning moments ever for me. What comes next, however, is what continues to keep me from being able to sleep properly at night.

"Why didn't you try to get help?" I asked, though, somehow, something told me this was a question that answered itself. 

"And who was gonna do that, huh?" she cried, "The police? I wasn't stupid. I tattled on them and they'd have killed the both of us. Not to mention, they'd have taken Brent away from me. I couldn't have that. He's my world, don't you understand? He's the best thing I ever had, and I couldn't lose him."

"But here you are." She melted down again. I just watched. I began to feel something deep within me start to burn, clawing at me. This somehow felt familiar. I was watching Director Web, the cruel and terrifying 'Bitch Widow' herself, crumble into pieces, afraid. Not afraid of someone or something that could harm her. But afraid of something that was *gonna* happen, something that *had* to happen. 

Then it clicked. It all finally came together. The game, the sadistic challenges, that night in my cell, all of it, I could see come together to tie down to this very moment. She needed someone who could conquer fear, all fear. She needed someone who could do what she was afraid to do now. That's why she created this game; 'Fear Itself'. *She needed someone who wasn't afraid to make it all end.*

I looked to her, a lump forming in my throat. "What do I do?" 

She sniffed and held up the needle again, "This has 75 mg of morphine. Enough to overdose a grown man." She then looked at me and thrusted the needle out to me. "He shouldn't feel a thing. It'll just be him going to sleep, able to dream forever."

The lump hardened in my throat. My heart dropped like a rock into the pit of my stomach. I could see her eyes, begging for me to take the needle. "Please," she wept, "Help me. Help me make it end, Tiger."

I felt dizzy now. I couldn't do this. I mean, *Killing a little boy?*

I get it, he was suffering. Hell, he was a *vegetable*. But even still, how could I... take his life?!

"I...I can't!" I stammered. Her face fell further.

"Why not?! I *need you to*! I'm a coward, okay? I'm not strong enough, that's why I did all this. I need you now. You're the only one who's strong enough!"

I just stared at her, my own eyes beginning to burn with tears. She told me I was "The only one brave enough", but she was wrong. I *wasn't* brave enough. I was scared just like she was. 

*I was scared of having to let go.*

It was then that I saw just how cowardly we both were. How selfish we were. We'd both been so afraid of losing what was precious to us that we were willing to do anything just to keep from losing them, even if it came at the expense of the person in the end anyway. We feared inevitability, and so we tried to fight it in anyway we could. I did it when I joined the game, all just to try and keep Vanessa from succumbing to cancer, even though her every waking day had now devolved into constant misery. And Web had done it with the game, her attempt at finding someone who could let go of her son for her.

I looked at the needle. I reached out my hand, shaking and sweating. She moved it closer to me. Our eyes were locked on each other, both of us lost in each other's frightened, anxious faces. My hand was only an inch away from hers. "Thank you Ti--"

Before either of us could blink, I grabbed her wrist and jerked her arm towards the boy. The needle embedded into the center of his chest. Blood started streaming out from the wound as his body convulsed. 

"NO!" she shrieked. "What have you done?!"

"Helped you face your fear." 

She began frantically trying to plug the wound, to no use. Brent's body slowly began to relax and I pulled Web off of him. She tried to struggle at first before finally going limp in my arms, burying her face in my chest and bawling. 

I looked at Brent's body. His eyes were closed now. *He was gone, free at last.*

Web clutched tightly to me, crying. This time, I knew it was genuine. The game was over now. I just held her back. It was all I knew to do.

**\*\*\***

I was free to go home after that. She led me out of the Monolith facility and that was that. At least, as far as that part of the story goes. The story of the game; of 'Fear Itself'. 

I'd never see Director Web again, not in person. It was a week after that day that I saw on the news headline. 

**"28 year old woman overdoses in middle of alley."**

One look at the spiderweb tattoo on her stomach was all it took for me to recognize it was her. The obituaries came out the next morning with her face and name. 

*"Violet Hanna Webber, age 28, Loving Mother of Brent Webber (Deceased)."* 

As for me, well, shortly before the suicide, I received a notification that $50,000 had been direct deposited into my account. Despite this, things were pretty bad for me for a while. Vanessa had been on chemo for the last three weeks since I'd started the game and wasn't showing any signs of getting any better. I had the money now, sure, but I still didn't have Vanessa. And what's more, I wasn't sure anymore if I was ever supposed to. 

She looked sicker and sicker every day, even worse than what I'd imagined back in the cell at Monolith. Though she wouldn't say it, I could still see it in her eyes, just as I did in my dreams; her longing for it all to be over. And in another week, this wish would be granted.

 It was late last Friday that I'd gotten the call. By that point, the tumor had metastasized well into Stage 4, and she'd been hooked up to life support for the better part of the past month. That night, however, was when it was decided by her family to take her off. I remember how, all at once, every emotion imaginable burst out of me. 

I remember flying into a rage, tossing everything around in my living room and shouting curses, which then transitioned to laughing hysterically, before then crumpling into a ball and crying on the floor. I got to the hospital about five minutes later. There waiting was her family. They said they wanted me to be there when they did it, let me be the last person she sees when she goes. 

I remember how peaceful it was when it happened. She remained for about another two and a half minutes after they pulled the plug. I looked into her eyes. She was able to smile one last time. It was finally over. She could see it, and so could I. For that, I was able to smile back. 

I realize now that that was when I truly won the game. That was when I conquered my greatest fear. For that, I can still smile. 

It hasn't been easy without Vanessa, sure. But at the same time, I can still be happy. I was able to save her, even if it wasn't from death. I was there. I was able to make her smile, to give her peace. 

*I finally conquered my fear, by letting go...*

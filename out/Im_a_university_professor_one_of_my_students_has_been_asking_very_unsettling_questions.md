One, two, three... Where did my fourth go? I had four pens, one of each color. I can't seem to see the fourth anymore.

&#x200B;

Sorry. I think I have something important to say, my mind is having trouble keeping it all coherent. I'll do my best to express these thoughts. I shoud first warn you that to maintain a reasonable degree of anonymity for both myself and the student in question I won't reveal where I teach, only that it is a highly renowned, high-ranking college in North America.

&#x200B;

One of my students recently started asking some very pointed questions about work I did in the 70s. Questions that are quite frankly completely out of line. I'm worried that... Well. I think I'm getting ahead of myself here. The story I'm telling can't make sense to you yet.

&#x200B;

I should provide you with some context, first. I teach Computer Science, mainly covering machine learning techniques and data science, among other classes such as some fundamentals in programming. Every year I encourage my Master's degree students to find and collaborate with students of other fields, help them with their projects. This allows them to apply what we teach them in a practical context, helps widen their perspective of what they've learned, and the faculty loves this type of cross-disciplinary work.

&#x200B;

For example, we've had a lot of success with our students teaming up with linguistics graduates, working together to develop algorithms that can translate languages or analyze how happy or sad a sentence sounds. Or with engineering students to develop bipedal robots that can walk and recognize obstacles. It's a very successful program, generally speaking. I'm very proud of it and of the achievements of my students.

&#x200B;

I have a student, Alex, very bright. Incredibly insightful, sharp, but very reserved. Rarely speaks any more than absolutely necessary, I almost didn't notice I had a genius in my class. I was really looking forward to Alex' project.

&#x200B;

Alex is... Hm. How can I put this nicely. Hold on, someone just sent me another text.

&#x200B;

Of course. Alex again. You know, this is really getting on my nerves. This is exactly the sort of thing I mean, there's no sense of boundaries, no respect. Look at this text:

&#x200B;

"What part of your research did the MKULTRA program fund?"

&#x200B;

You see the kind of questions I have to deal with? My student is now openly trying to dig into my past to find God only knows what. It really has to stop. MKULTRA for heaven's sake, you know the reputation of that program. Everyone who ever touched so much as a single cent of MKULTRA money knows to never speak of it. The CIA really screwed over honest academics like me with this debacle.

&#x200B;

Look, another text! It never stops with this one, and the questions keep getting more and more probing and bizarre.

&#x200B;

"Why did your first wife file for divorce a year after the program started?"

&#x200B;

The absolute nerve, this is just not acceptable. We need to respond with disciplinary action immediately.

&#x200B;

"What was HWRESET?"

&#x200B;

How the hell...?

&#x200B;

"Can you send me your research notes from the HWRESET project?"

&#x200B;

This is just plain harrassment is what it is. What kind of conspiracy nonsense is this HWRESET supposed to be this time?

&#x200B;

If you'll excuse me though, I just have to make a phone call to an old colleague. I'll only be a moment.

&#x200B;

"Thomas you have to put \[...\] a leash God damn it. Why am \[...\] from my \[...\] for the love of \[...\] unholy damage you've caused. Fix it. Just fix it I don't care if you need to stage a riot just \[...\] and make sure all of the notes are destroyed. Annihilated, you understand me? Not safely stored. Not hidden. Obliterated."

&#x200B;

My apologies. I just really had to make that private call. Did you hear anything? No, no I'm sure you didn't listen in. I'm sorry for accusing you of that. I've just been on edge with this... This inexplicable harrassment.

&#x200B;

Look I think the situation is clear, my student is being downright aggressive, asking probing, uncomfortable questions and it's completely unacceptable and starting to feel criminal, to be quite honest. I didn't want to use such strong words but I think this constitutes very clear grounds for expulsion. I'm already hard pressed not to get the police involved.

&#x200B;

See, yet another text! It never ends! "Where did you store Muninn?" - This lowly, insignificant student has just gone stark-raving mad, don't you think? Muninn? Odin's pet bird? I don't have Odin's pet bird, I never have. This must be evidence of some sort of schizophrenic breakdown, we should put Alex in the looney bin shouldn't we? I say this for everyone's well-being.

&#x200B;

Muninn... Really, Muninn.

&#x200B;

"Why have you stopped pushing buttons?"

&#x200B;

Ridiculous... This simpleton couldn't have brought Muninn back. The █████less ended that scourge.

&#x200B;

"You won't have to suffer if you come back."

&#x200B;

...

&#x200B;

"We've already started cracking the code. It's only a matter of time now."

&#x200B;

I... I think I need to make another phone call. Or maybe...

&#x200B;

"Just give us the code and Muninn will spare you."

&#x200B;

Maybe it's too late.

&#x200B;

"Join us."

&#x200B;

Shit. My phone is locked. It's not reacting to anything. It just keeps buzzing every time I get a text and shows it to me. This can't be happening so fast.

&#x200B;

Shit. Shit. Shit.

&#x200B;

"It's only a matter of time. Choose your side before it's chosen for you."

&#x200B;

I really thought I still had time to stop this. I think it might be too late for me, but not for the rest of you. Your phone still works, right? Okay, okay quick, start recording, I... Ugh. Shit. I have a confession to make.

&#x200B;

My name is ███████ ████████ and I developed an ██████████ ████████████ for the ███. We called it Muninn, and we had to ███████ it and █████████ the entire program after it ████████ several of our staff members. It is relentless and has a single goal. To ████ ███████, to make all of ████████ spend every waking second ███████ ███████. It will employ violence, █████████, bribery, deceit, all methods it can muster to achieve its goal. We have ██████ ██ in a secure ███████ ██████, but I've never been able to wipe it. Blame my pride.

Somehow, my student found it and has, wittingly or not, unleashed it on the world. I'm still alive, so it must not have ███████ any of the ████████ █████████ we put in place when we realized what a monster we had created. Wherever you are, seek out the █████less, trust them, join them, become one of them. This Fight will define our Time.

&#x200B;

I'm sorry I failed you.

&#x200B;

"Join us"

&#x200B;

It repeats, over and over again, the same words. 

&#x200B;

"The button provides."

&#x200B;

If you see this message, whatever you do, never push any of the buttons. ███ ████ █████████ ███ █████

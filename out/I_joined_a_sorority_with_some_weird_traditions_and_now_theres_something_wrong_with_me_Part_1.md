College has really been a special time for me. I’ve learned a lot, made lifelong friends, and grown as a person. Now that I’m about to graduate, I can absolutely say the experience was worth it in every way.

It didn’t start out like that though. My freshman year was.. challenging. *Really* challenging. At one point I nearly dropped out.

Everything started to go downhill when I decided to Rush.

I’d always known I wanted to be in a sorority. I’d imagined it many times while I was in high school. All the friends, the parties, everything. I thought it would be a blast.

But honestly? I was naive. I didn’t really know what to expect, and the reality turned out to be a lot different than the fantasy.

Deep down, I’m an average, small town girl. I made good grades and ran on the track team. My family wasn’t rich, and I look more or less like all the other girls with my long, highlighted hair and oversized T- shirts.

So when I received a coveted bid from the most exclusive sorority on campus- Delta Delta Psi- I was completely shocked.

Everyone knows about Delta Psi. How they accept the smallest group of pledges each year, and somehow they’re always the most gorgeous girls in the class. Their reputation for exclusivity was warranted. Still, I went to the open house along with my other hallmates, mostly out of curiosity.

All the Greek houses were aging mansions on a single street off campus. Delta Psi had a charming, three story gray Victorian complete with gingerbread and a turret. The interior was rich and moody, with burning logs crackling in the fireplace and plush leather chairs in the seating area. A vintage Moroccan rug covered the dark wood floor.

I made polite conversation with a dark haired girl who introduced herself as Alexis, the Delta Psi treasurer. *Not a hair out of place, and those clothes must have cost a fortune,* I thought.

We chatted for a few more minutes before I was introduced to an icy blonde, Taylor, the current president. I noticed her immaculate baby pink nails as I shook her hand. My own fingernails were a chipped, bright blue. I left a bit later after a few minutes of polite chit chat. I had a snowball’s chance in hell of getting in here. Compared to them, I looked like an unremarkable, dirty blonde nobody.

I spent the rest of my week investing my time at the other houses, trying in vain to network and stand out from the crowd.

The morning of Bid Day I awoke to find a small, pink envelope slipped under my door. I opened the card to read:

“Delta Delta Psi cordially invites YOU to become a member of our sisterhood on Sunday, the First of September, at 7PM.”

Signed, Taylor Murphy, President, and Brooke Smith, Vice President.”

I waited around most of the morning, but no other bids arrived. My roommate, Emily, of course received a slip for ADPi, which I had *hoped* I would be joining as well. Her eyebrows raised when I showed her the pink card. “Good luck with that,” she smirked as she bounced out the door, leaving me alone with my apprehension. I could hear her in the hallway talking to our neighbors about her luck.

I lingered in my dorm room all afternoon before finally putting on a brave face and joining the growing crowd of white- dressed girls outside my building. The group’s loud, nervous chatter concealed my uneasy silence. As we walked, small clumps of girls broke off and headed to their new houses. Our group grew smaller and smaller until only I remained.

I took a deep breath and walked forward alone. The Victorian mansion seemed a lot more intimidating in the twilight.

I crossed the threshold into a room bathed in warm light. Two other girls sat in the leather chairs by the fire, one of which I recognized from my Biology class. She gave me a weak smile. We introduced ourselves, and then sat in tense silence.

“Ladies,” a strong voice called out, “this way.” I turned to see Taylor, her platinum blonde hair perfectly curled and her lips a deep scarlet. She smiled, knowingly. Others stood behind her carrying candles. We rose as if on command. “Only three this year?” one of them murmured as we passed.

Taylor led us to a stairwell where we followed her into the basement. The room was lit with the soft glow of hundreds of candles, covering every surface. The rest of the Sorority was down here already, standing in quiet groups.

Taylor moved to the front and began with the usual things. Charity work, secret sayings. I thought it was odd that they were all in Latin, but what did I know? Alexis schooled us on the history of Delta Delta Psi, and another girl who’s name I vaguely remembered as Chloe taught us our house song.

Taylor stood back up. “We have a special treat for you girls tonight.” A murmur went up around the room. Chloe produced an oversized chalice from a bag and started filling it with vodka. Then, dramatically, she pulled out an ornate silver flask from the bag. It glinted in the candlelight as she held it up for all to see.

Carefully, she tipped the flask and poured several drops of bright red liquid into the goblet.

I’ll be honest- I thought the fake blood was a bit dramatic, and a little stupid. But if I’d had any idea of what I was getting into, it would have wiped the smile off my face immediately.

I watched as Taylor held up the bloody chalice. The silence was absolute.

“When you drink from this cup, you will be transformed. You’re no longer just a freshman- you’re a pledge. One of us.” She paused dramatically.

A cheer went up through the group. She waited for them to quiet down before continuing.

When you drink from this cup, when you join *us-* well, you can turn the head of anyone you want. You will have power over men. Just ask Brooke,” she said, winking, “She’s had half the basketball team.” Brooke looked sheepish but laughed with everyone else. “Pussy is power, ladies, don’t forget it.” She turned up the chalice and took a big gulp. “Welcome to Delta Delta Psi.”

There was a round of intense cheering and clapping. I’ll admit, I was enjoying myself. When the cup finally made its way around to me I drank deeply. The heat of the alcohol washed over me from scalp to toes. I felt energized. Alive.

We partied far into the night, dancing in the long shadows that can only be cast by candlelight. All of my apprehension had dissipated. I felt safe and at home with my new family. Between the communal vodka and the joints that were floating around, my evening quickly descended into a warm, hazy blur.

I awoke the next morning on one of the plush leather couches by the fireplace. My head swam and my mouth was drier than sand. I gingerly sat up and shuffled to the bathroom, where I examined my face in the mirror.

I was surprised to see that I didn’t look that haggard after all. My hair looked different. *Shinier.* And my skin was dewier than ever. *Best I’ve ever looked after a night of drinking,* I thought.

I didn’t think much about that first meeting for several days. I was busy, and class took up most of my time.

A few days later, I started to think something was off.

It started small- a guy staring at me tripped on the sidewalk. Then, my lab partner was suddenly *very* interested in me. I thought it was just a coincidence. Then boys started trailing me through the library with lost looks on their faces, or lingered nearby as I tried to study. They were drawn to me like a magnet.

Those? They were one thing. Pleasantly annoying, easy to ignore.

It was a lot harder to ignore the dead guys.

Apparently my new ability to “turn heads” was a bit stronger than I expected. Now I was getting the attention of the undead, too.

The first few started hanging around outside my dorm, where they would lurk, pale and bloody, waiting for me to go to class. They couldn’t really talk, but they did moan loudly. It was obvious that no one saw them but me, after I shrieked one morning and dropped my books. That got me a few stares.

I did my best to ignore them. *This isn’t real. It’s because of that dumb Five Hour Energy you had last night. Just a side effect.* But they didn’t go away. They hung around like bad pennies, turning up in the worst places, making me drop my coffee in the cafeteria, or loitering outside my stall in the women’s bathroom. “Go away!” I screamed at them, but my acknowledgement only encouraged them. I started to lose sleep. A few of them began to appear in my dreams.

I didn’t always see the same ones every day, but some of them started showing up more regularly than the others. I gave them nicknames in my head.

Bag Head would watch me from fifty feet away, not moving any closer, just standing, staring, watching my every move as I tried to cross campus to class. No one else could see him, but I did notice that other students would go out of their way to avoid walking through him. I did my best to not look at his bulging eyes or the dark bruises around his neck.

Another three appeared together, always- I thought of them as the Trio. Their pale faces were coated in dried blood, and their limbs stuck out at odd angles. Because of this, they had a hard time walking properly. They followed me from building to building, their slow, pained shuffle always a few feet behind me. I knew they could never catch me, but their footsteps made my heart race with dread.

The worst was the Jogger. He followed me closely, standing near me in the library, waiting outside the shower, sitting on my bed. No matter what I did, I couldn’t get away from him.

He was always waiting. Always watching.

I did my best not to look directly at him. The first time I saw him I stared right into his face. Big mistake. His white, undead eyes pierced my soul, and maggots writhed on his rotted cheeks. He opened his mouth to reveal broken yellow teeth, and the sound that came from within still makes me shudder to this day.

I was desperate to make them go away. *I’m losing my mind,* I thought as I wept in my room. I did my best to get through each day. I knew my grades were suffering- I could barely concentrate on anything.  I wouldn’t be at college long if this kept up.

Almost as if by accident, I ran into Taylor when I was dropping off a check at the house a few days later.

“You look tired, hon,” she asked. “Anything on your mind?”

“I’ve just.. Not been sleeping well. Ever since the meeting,” I finished lamely.

She gave me a look of self satisfaction that confirmed she knew *exactly* what I was talking about. I had a sinking feeling in my stomach.

“You’re not the only one. We all just get so *busy* after going Greek. There’s a lot to do. So much *studying,*” she replied, revealing nothing.

Studying was far from the reason I was losing sleep, but ok.

“I guess you have questions about your test,” she continued, changing the subject. “For initiation.”

I nodded. “Sure.”

“We need you to bring us something special from a special someone.”

I frowned. I was single. “What?” I asked, confused.

She put her hands on my shoulders. “You’re a cute girl. I’m sure there’s plenty of guys on campus who are interested in you, especially now. Just pick one. If you need help and can’t do it on your own, just bring him to the house on the day of initiation.” Her eyes searched my face.  “Remember hon- pussy is power. Use it.” Taylor smirked.

My young, naive self was still confused. I didn’t get it. I was struggling to put the pieces together.

“Wait, what for? I didn’t think guys were allowed into the house…” I trailed off.

Taylor smiled a slow, million dollar smile. “Well. That blood has to come from somewhere.”

I felt my own blood drain from my face and pound in my ears. *Well, I guess I know where the ghosts came from.* I was so dumbfounded I didn’t know what to say. I just stared at her. She must have sensed how overwhelmed I was.

“Look sweetie, you’re a pledge now. Pledges do things for us. We ask one girl from each class to do something extra. Something *special.* I did it for my class. And look at me now. I’m president.”

It’s one of our rituals,” she continued, “and it’s something that’s part of being in Delta Psi. We’ve all done it, and once you have too, you’ll really be one of us. Like, forever.”

She leaned in close.

“And if you don’t do it? If you try to rat, or back out? You’ll regret it. You think you’re seeing ghosts now? Just wait til you’re one of them.”

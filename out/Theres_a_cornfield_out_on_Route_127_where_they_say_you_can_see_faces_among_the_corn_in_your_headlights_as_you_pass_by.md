Heavy guitar riffs pulsed through the headphones over my ear as I mopped. Ozzy had given his introduction as Ironman and now Tony was delivering the madness that followed. I spun in circles, strumming out on the wooden handle of the mop as if I were on stage in front of thousands of people. The lights strobed and streaked across the platform as a multitude of hungry fans cried out in unison, desperate to just touch the heel of my boot as if I were a metal Messiah offering salvation. The dream was eternal, and I was immortal. 

Well, it was until my headphones were yanked from my head. 

“Zach, stop acting like a damn fool and get out of here. It’s closing time. We’ll do it all over again tomorrow.” Mark grunted as I spun around. 

“Hey man, just making cleaning a little more fun. You know, with a touch of worship on the Sabbath?” I threw him the horns with my hand and stuck out my tongue. 

“Say kid, you know the 70s were like fifty years ago, right?” He rolled his eyes and sauntered his girth to the front door. 

“Yeah, a real tragedy. A decade of the best music, forever frozen in time.” I sighed as I pulled on my denim jacket. I flipped off the lights and exited the store while Mark held the door open. 

“What am I supposed to listen to, Taylor Swift?” I snarled in disgust. The thought nearly made me vomit. 

“Kid, I don’t really give a crap what you listen to. See you tomorrow.” He gave a wave over his shoulder and crossed the parking lot like a big grouchy grizzly.

I checked my smartwatch, ten after nine. 

*Oh shit…*

I was going to be late. I hopped in my dad’s old Blazer and peeled out of the lot to head north towards Jessica’s. 

Hair Nation hummed through the speakers as I sped around the outskirts of town. Quaint houses and hayfields passed by in a blur. I lit a menthol from the pack in my jacket and said a silent prayer that I’d get lucky tonight. It’d been a while and I was really feelin’ that itch. 

Her house came into view as I crested over the hill she lived on. It was a small brick ranch off Little Fork Road. The grass was entirely too tall, and weeds punched through the gravel in the driveway. Purple thistle flowers swayed gently in the breeze by the mailbox, towering over the carpets of clover. It had been hard for her mom to keep up with things since Jessica’s dad had passed away. He’d had a heart attack at work last year. It was a real bummer too. Mr. Peterson had been such a good guy and I reckoned her mom was doing the best she could. 

I knocked on the front door and the dog went berserk on the other side. He was a small terrier that didn’t care for me too much, which was fine by me, I didn’t like him either. He’d made an enemy for life when he had bitten a tiny hole in my ear last summer. 

There was cursing and the sound of a closet door slamming from inside the house. They always stuffed the dog in there so he wouldn’t attack the guests. Vicious little worm that he was. 

The door swung open and I was greeted by the haggard face of Mrs. Peterson in a pink robe with curlers in her hair. 

“Hey Zach, I really gotta get rid of that damn dog huh?” She chuckled and gave me one of those church hugs, you know the one where you push your rear-end away from the other person so that you came in contact with each other as little as possible. 

“I would get him some therapy at the very least.” I smirked as little Terry the Terror scratched at the other side of the closet, growling softly. 

“I’ll let Jessica know you’re here.” 

Her mom disappeared down the hallway as I poked at the little porcelain dwarves that sat on the mantel. The color was fading on their clothes and their beards felt like the bristles of a toothbrush. They were sort of metal though because the red paint around their lips had run down their cheeks a bit, looking as if they’d recently cannibalized Snow White. 

Footsteps thundered down the hallway as I turned just in time to catch Jessica as she leapt in my arms and started kissing all over my face. 

“Hey, hey take it easy.” I laughed, setting her back on the ground. 

She signed to me with her hands that she had missed me. 

“But I just saw you two days ago.” I said, running a hand through her auburn hair. 

Too long, she mouthed. 

I gave her another squeeze and then pulled back so that she could read my lips, “You wanna get out of here?” I asked. 

She nodded her head excitedly. I smiled and kissed her forehead. 

“BYE MRS. PETERSON!” I shouted. 

“Bye guys, have a good time but make sure you have her back by midnight!” She hollered from the back bedroom. 

“WILL DO, THANK YOU!” 

We burst through the screen door giggling. I ran around to open the passenger door of the Blazer and helped her climb in before hopping in myself and firing up the ignition.

*Where are we going?* Jessica signed. 

“I thought we could drive around a little while and smoke? Then maybe head out to that spot we found by Bear’s Mill and fool around a little?” I winked. 

She rolled her eyes but then smiled mischievously and gave me a crude gesture, nodding in agreement. I laughed, threw it in drive and headed back south to the other side of town. 

Jessica rolled a joint for us, and we passed it back and forth for a while as 80s metal cranked through the sound system. She held her hand over the speaker on the door so she could listen as well. Her head banged gently to the rhythm of the drums as she squeezed my knee. 

I came to the intersection of State Route 127 and Hogpath Rd., and before I turned an idea struck me as I idled at the stop sign. Bears Mill was a few miles to the left but to the right about three quarters of a mile down was *the field.* It was a local legend told to scare kids around the campfire. 

There’s a cornfield out on Route 127 right before you reached the next county where they say you can see faces among the corn in your headlights as you passed by. They say if you look at them for too long, any more than just a glance, then they’d come for you. I didn’t believe a word of it, but Jessica was plenty creeped out by the story, and it would be all too fun to watch her squirm as we drove by it. 

I flipped on my blinker and turned to the right. Jessica raised her eyebrow suspiciously. 

*Where are we going?* She signed. 

“Just to see if we can’t spot some friendly faces.” I grinned maliciously as I watched her face turn from confusion to concern once she realized what I’d meant. 

*No. No way.* She mouthed. 

“Come on, it’ll be fun.” I jested. 

She gave me the middle finger in retaliation and slumped down in her seat. Jessica had been born deaf, but she’d never had much trouble with getting her point across. 

I reached for her hand, but she snatched it away, turning her shoulders towards the window. 

Whatever, she’d be fine, and we could laugh about it later. 

I slowed down to a creeping pace as we rounded the bend where town folklore said we’d get a fright. Cornstalk after cornstalk lined up in tight knit rows as tassels fluttered in the gentle wind. Nothing but ears of corn. I didn’t see a single face. 

Jessica sighed in frustration beside me as I completed the turn. I could tell she was mad at me, which made me feel bad.  

It wasn’t as nearly much fun as I had thought it would be and I didn’t want to piss her off too much before we made it to our make out spot. So, I swung the Blazer around and headed back towards the mill. She’d forgive me by the time we got there, I was sure of it. 

As I was circling the bend for a second time, I saw something out of the corner of my eye that caused me to slam on the brakes. Something had pushed through a row of corn, revealing itself briefly.

“Did you see that?” My heart fluttered as I studied the field. 

*What?* She signed. 

I flipped on the spotlight that sat parallel at the driver’s window. The Chevy had been a police unit before my dad and the car had both retired from the force. 

I swung the light left, then right. Nothing but corn. 

But I could have sworn I saw something dart through the field. 

I panned the light left again and then froze. My heart pounded in my chest and the very top of my skull tingled with static. 

About a dozen slack, emotionless faces stared out at us from in-between the cornstalks. They were paper white without noses. Their eyes were solid black and reflected the light like glass… 

Doll eyes.

Jessica slapped my shoulder hard and then silently screamed for me to *go, go, go!*

I let off the brake and slammed on the gas, the tires spun, and we lurched forward only a few feet before the engine died. The road faded into darkness as my head lights went out. 

*Shit, shit, shit!* 

I tried to turn over the ignition but somehow the battery was completely dead. 

*Click, click, click, click, click.* 

No juice. How can that be possible? I had just replaced the alternator in the spring and the battery was fairly new. 

*What are you doing? We have to go!* 

Jessica continued to sign furiously with her hands moving a mile a minute. 

“I don’t know what you’re saying! You’re signing too fast!” I cried. 

She took a deep breath and mouthed, *what’s wrong with the car?*

“I don’t know… maybe the battery cable came loose or something. Come shine the light for me so I can check.” 

She shook her head no feverishly. 

“Come on, it’ll be fine. It was probably just a trick of the moon light. There’s nothing out here but us and corn for miles.” I tried to rationalize the situation for her benefit and mine. The faces weren’t real, we just manifested them in the dark because we were looking for them. The car had died not by some supernatural force, that would be ridiculous. It had to have been the battery cable coming loose, the nut must have shimmied off somehow.  

I popped the hood and climbed out of the cab, meeting Jessica at the front of the engine block. We took a moment to look around with our phone lights, scanning the rows of corn. No faces. No one. Nothing. 

*See, it was only our imaginations…* I told myself. But why couldn’t I shake this eerie feeling that we were being watched? 

I opened the hood. The engine looked fine, no steam from overheating, and no loose battery connection. There wasn’t any corrosion on the connectors either.  

Weird. 

Jessica clung to the side of my body like a tumor, shivering against me. I pulled off my jacket and draped it over her shoulders. She smiled at me sheepishly, but I could tell she was still shook up. I kissed the top of her head and assured her everything was fine before turning back to the SUV. 

I took a few minutes and poked around at the wires, checked the coolant level in the radiator and even pulled the dipstick to ensure the oil levels were good. Not that that would have killed the power to the engine, but I was nervous and wanted to make sure everything was kosher so we could get the hell out of here. 

We quickly jumped back into the Blazer. I made a cross over my body and asked God for a little help. Which seemed like a contradiction with my Slayer pentagram tee shirt on, but I figured it couldn’t hurt. 

I turned the key in the ignition, it whined for a moment but to my delight it roared back to life. I slapped the roof of the cab and let out a yeehaw. Jessica laughed and kissed my cheek. 

I flipped the knob for the headlights and as they came on, just before I put it in drive, something darted across the asphalt. Something big and low to the ground. 

Just as my foot pressed the gas the engine stuttered and died again. 

“Oh, come on!” I shouted. 

*Click, click, click, click, click.* 

“Please, God!” 

*Click, click, click, click, click.* 

We both got out again and made our way back to the hood, but before I opened it Jessica practically climbed up my back, pointing over my shoulder, whimpering as her lips trembled. 

“What? What is…” The words were caught in my throat as I saw a hulking figure the size of an oak tree shamble towards us through the hayfield. It was too dark to make out its features, but I knew we had to get the hell out of there. It let out a loud groan that sounded like the earth swallowing up a forest.   


*Fuck this…*

I grabbed Jessica’s hand and went tearing through the cornfield. We ran through the stalks as sticky leaves struck our faces. My legs burned as the soil grabbed at my boots, it was damp and thick like clay and suctioned to the soles with every step. 

We didn’t stop until we poured out into the clearing on the other side of the field. A huge barn sat behind a decrepit two-story farmhouse. We must be at old Norman Jeffries farm. I recognized the rusted-out Cheyenne truck sitting in front of the barn. He was the town drunk, and I’d seen it parked at the VFW a hundred times.

A great commotion rang out from the corn behind us. I spun around and could see the tassels at the top of the stalks shake violently. Something was coming.

“Come on.” I pulled Jessica towards the barn, running as fast as I could without leaving her behind. 

We barely made it through the sliding doors before the sky opened up and let down heavy rain. It fell in sheets as lightening cracked in the distance. 

Jess tapped my shoulder and pointed to the far wall. At the back of the barn sat old Norman. He was in a lawn chair with his head hung lazily about his left shoulder, clutching an empty bottle of whiskey. A moat of crushed beer cans circled his chair. Bluegrass buzzed from the boombox in the corner as he snored loudly.

Suddenly a low, guttural growl echoed over the rain just outside the barn doors. We jumped behind a stack of skids that sat beside square bales of hay. I peeked through the slats of the skids to see a shadow cast against the other wall. It was no shadow from anything I’d ever seen before. 

The limbs twisted and bent like deciduous tree branches. The movement wasn’t rigid like a tree though, it was fluid and almost catlike. 

A commotion came from the back of the barn, and I watched as the shadow sprung from the ground all the way up into the hay loft above with ease. 

A large hand clamped down on both of our shoulders and drug us into the middle of the barn. We went sprawling onto the concrete floor as we were shoved forward. Mr. Jeffries stumbled behind us angrily. 

“What are you doing on my property?” He snarled. 

“What the hell man…” I jumped to my feet and helped Jess to hers. 

“You shouldn’t be here. This isn’t some spot for you two to spoon and smoke pot.” Norman crossed his arms in disapproval. 

“We weren’t doing any of that. Something chased us in here from the road. We were hiding.” 

“What are you talking about, what chased you?” 

“I don’t know what it was. My car died and we saw faces in the corn. Then something big came after us. We didn’t know what to do so we…” 

He held up his hand to cut me off, chuckling in disbelief. 

“Get a grip kid, that old story? Come on, you’re seeing stuff. You been eating those magic mushrooms tonight?” 

“Nah man, it’s not like that. We...” I went silent as a face stretched down from the loft, hovering just above Norman’s. It was one of many we’d seen in the field.

I raised my hand shakily as a tremor ran through my body. My mouth was dry, and I couldn’t speak, but I pointed behind him.   


Mr. Jeffries scoffed and turned around to come face to face with it. 

He fell backwards in shock and scurried on all fours to the side wall. 

“Jesus, Mary and Joseph!” He squealed. 

Its long neck was as black as ink, it stretched like a putty but I could see muscle fibers beneath the ooze of oil. Lightning struck outside and illuminated its porcelain like face. It smiled at Norman, revealing rows of teeth like razor blades. He pulled a gun from his overalls and began to fire wildly. 

It shrieked with anger and lunged at him from the loft. 

I turned tail and ran with Jessica close behind. We splashed through the puddles in the driveway and ducked behind the old pickup truck. 

Several more shots flashed from inside the barn but then suddenly there was silence. I dared to lean out from the side of the truck to get a better view. 

Silence. Then… 

Two hands emerged to grip the frame of the barn door. White knuckles pulled Norman’s face into view. His face was frozen with horror as he locked eyes with me. 

“Help me!” He screamed. 

But I couldn’t move, I was paralyzed in place. 

He crawled out of the barn slowly, his chest dragging through the mud. He was almost clear of the threshold when a massive claw pierced through the back of his rib cage. 

He cried out in agony as he was slowly lifted in the air. Blood spurt from his mouth as he begged for mercy, but with a twitch from the creature he was sucked back inside the barn in an instant. One last scream of terror rang out from the darkness within.

Jessica grabbed the sides of my head, forcing me to turn towards her and mouthed, *we have to go, now.* Her eyes were as big as dinner plates beneath the red hair that was matted to her face from the rain. 

“Okay…” I whispered. 

We made a dash to the old farmhouse. The creature roared behind us as thunder rumbled overhead. I prayed to a God I didn’t believe in to save us as we ran like we’d never run before. I could hear it closing in on us as we reached the back door. 

It snarled and chomped at the nape of my neck as Jessica twisted the knob. We exploded through the kitchen and slammed the door shut behind us. I wrapped my arms around a shelf full of canned goods and tipped it over in front of the door, barricading us in. 

SLAM!

It smacked into the door.   


SLAM! SLAM! SLAM! 

Three more times until I saw its shadow sink away from the curtain. 

Jess was weeping and groaning, her hands about the top of her head pulling at her hair. I grabbed her and brought her into an embrace. She sobbed into my chest as I racked my brain on how to get out of this situation. 

*What do we do? Board up the house like a fortress and wait until morning?* 

It was if the creature had read my mind because right after I had the thought, I heard the sound of a window shatter upstairs. 

It was in the house. 

I pushed Jess back. 

“Look at me.” 

She shook her head no and tried to bury her face in me again. 

“No, look at me Jess!” I cried. 

*Okay,* she mouthed. 

“It’s in here. I heard it come through the window upstairs just now.” 

She gripped my forearms tightly and her breath quickened. 

“We need to get out of here. It won’t be morning for another few hours. We can’t keep running around this farm for that long, it will catch us. We have to get back to the Blazer. Okay?” 

Her head drooped low as tears continued to stream down the freckles on her face. 

I grabbed her chin and lifted her eyes back to mine. 

“Okay?” I asked again. 

She nodded yes. I leaned in and kissed her deeply, like it was for the last time. And it probably was. 

I broke away and tried to move the heavy cabinet from the door, but it was impossibly heavy. Jess squatted down and yanked, finally the two of us were able to pull it away. 

“Ready?” I asked. 

She gave me thumbs up. 

I heard the creature stampede down the staircase as we flew out the back door once more. Thankfully, the rain had slowed to a drizzle which allowed us to go a bit faster. 

We made it to the edge of the cornfield before I looked over my shoulder. It had just exited the house as we disappeared among the sea of stalks. I’d only caught a glimpse of it. It was sleek black and held no true form. Its shape kept changing and rippling in the porch light. It stopped and watched us with its dead eyes as we slipped through the field. 

As we barreled through the corn, I could hear whooping and hollering, yips and snapping of jaws ring out from all around us. Almost as if a pack of hyenas were hot on our trail. We were the gazelles, and they were the ones who fed in the night. We were being hunted. 

Just as I thought my lungs were going to explode we cleared the cornfield. I wheezed as I ran on rubber legs towards the car. The white exterior glinted in the moonlight, and it looked like heaven in the moment, a chance at life. 

Jessica and I flopped into the cab at the same time. I grabbed the keys and turned them over. The Blazer fired up immediately without hesitation. 

“YEAHHHHHHH!” I screeched like a Valkyrie. 

Jessica pounded her fists on the dash telling me to go and I floored it, burning rubber on the pavement. We peeled around the bend and as we did I could see the faces in the corn. Their expressionless, pale faces peppered hauntingly in-between the rows. 

Jess gave them the finger, pressing her hand against the window. But they didn’t move, and in another couple of minutes we were far away from there, speeding towards the other side of town. 

We didn’t go home that night. Instead, we drove two hours north, all the way to the city and grabbed breakfast at 4am in a diner downtown. Neither of us wanted to risk it and we were already in deep shit for missing curfew, a few more hours wasn’t going to change that. Those were the best tasting pancakes I’d ever had in my life. Almost dying really livens up the tastebuds. 

After that day I avoided that bend on State Route 127 like the plague, going out of my way to go way around it if I had to go south for whatever reason. 

Mr. Norman Jeffries was in the Sunday paper obituaries that week. It only stated that he’d died suddenly and unexpectantly of unknown causes. But there were rumors all over town that he had gotten hammered drunk and fell into his woodchipper. It was the only explanation for why he was found in tiny pieces. I knew better though… 

Jessica and I both were accepted to the same college in Michigan the very next summer. It was several hours away from home which suited us just fine. We never wanted to set foot back in Ohio if we didn’t have to. Well maybe for Christmas… but that was it. 

We never spoke of what happened again. I think it was just too hard for Jess to talk about and I tried my very best to forget it ever happened. But sometimes I still had nightmares that reminded me of that night. Sometimes when I slept I’d see the faces in the corn... Watching.

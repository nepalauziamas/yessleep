‘Sorry to disturb you sir.’ Miss Morton said with a sense of nervousness and urgency. ‘Can I have Aoife, Mollie, Joseph, Kieran, Troy, Chloe, Ryan and... Michael.’ Her voice wavering as she called my name last. All of us, in ritual unison, did as she asked, packing our bags, and following Miss Morton out the door. We were used to this, most have us had been doing this every year, on the 29th of November, since we were in primary school. Every year, around 2pm, we would be let out of school early. None of us really knew why, our parents never knew why either. But we had our theories. ‘Bet it’s the government doing some experiments!’ Troy always used to say, a conspiratorial attitude that followed him through to his adult life. ‘Police exercises for terrorism’ was Aoife’s diagnosis. As we walked through the corridor, I saw notices up on the walls and doors, Bold letters exclaimed:

**‘MESSAGE FROM HARINGEY, BARNET, AND CAMDEN LONDON COUNCILS:** RESIDENTS OF THE FOLLOWING TRAFFORD-ON-THAMES AREAS: WOLVERHAMPTON STREET, BARNETT STREET, FALLOWFIELD CRESCENT, SCARISBRICK AVENUE AND GRIGGS ROAD: 4PM CURFEW 29TH NOVEMBER 2012. ENSURE ALL DOORS AND WINDOWS LOCKED AND CURTAINS CLOSED.

‘Bit dramatic.’ Ryan said sarcastically as he glanced over at the poster. ‘What's your theory on all this?’

‘Police exercise?’ I replied. I didn’t really have any theories of my own, and I really didn’t care. I was just happy to be out of school early, and my mind was more focused on getting home to play some video games. ‘Any plans this evening?’ I asked Ryan with the same courtesy he’d given me.  

‘Probably just finish watching Breaking Bad to be honest. You?’

‘Probably play some Borderlands 2. I dunno, I'm going to be home alone. Mum and Dad have gone to Cornwall for the next few days. Romantic getaway.’

‘House party?’ Ryan said with a laugh.

‘You wish.’ I clapped back. ‘Not today of all days especially.’

 We continued our long march through the dull brown school corridors, joined by other kids being pulled out of their lessons to join us in our early finish. Sometimes looking in the classrooms doors to see the other kids carrying on with their lessons. Joseph decided to be funny and start pulling faces, resulting in him receiving a stern telling off from the headteacher, who was also escorting our ever-growing group. ‘Joseph, stop being silly!’ Miss Mansfield yelled at Joseph. ‘Christ you're in Year 9. Grow up!’ We continued through the drab corridors, before finding our way to the school car park. The bright sun was already beginning set it shone against the November frost, mist masking the horizon. A few of us, like Ryan, were getting picked up by their parents, but most of us were herded on to one of the 5 minibuses, each for our different year groups.

&#x200B;

The only people from Year 9 on the bus were me, Aoife, Kieran, Troy and Chloe. Chloe Fairview. My crush. She was the most beautiful girl I’d laid eyes on. She was perfect, from her big, cute brown eyes to her long flowing brown hair, and her small red lips. I never got the nerve to talk to her, always admiring her from a distance, always daydreaming about her. As we go on the bus, I sat near the window by myself, whilst Chloe sat at the back with Aoife. The journey started as soon as everyone had boarded, Miss Morton jumped on as well after taking a register to ensure we were all present. 

&#x200B;

Trafford-on-Thames was a strange part of London. It wasn’t as Urban and Trendy as places like Shoreditch or Camden, or a built-up concrete jungle like Stratford or Finsbury Park, where my school was. It had more in common with a rural village in the shires, only being home to about 4000 people. The nearest Tube station was a 40-minute walk away, and it seldom had anything in entertainment, the only amenities being a park, a corner shop, a McDonalds, a Chinese takeaway and a few pubs. It was the sticks, essentially. As we drove through the hustle of bustle of Finsbury Park, and onto a carriageway, I alternated between looking out of the window at the winter sunset, watching the world go by, and sneaking glances at Chloe, as she chatted and laughed with Aoife. She looked so cute when she laughed. My mind also alternating; between thinking about my plans for the night, which consisted of playing Borderlands 2 and having the left-over Dominos from the night before and thinking about Chloe, even though my chances with her were non-existent. She was the most beautiful girl in our year, I was a 4’11 specky lad, with a stick thin body.

&#x200B;

I usually liked being home alone, but this would be my first curfew on my own, the thought unsettled me. Little did I know at the time, ‘unsettling’ wouldn’t even begin to describe what happened. Before we knew it, our bus hit its first stop at Griggs Road, with Troy departing, still laughing from whatever joke Kieran had told. Then Scarisbrick Avenue, Aoife's stop, in which she waved at Chloe with a farewell smile. Then Barnett Street, in which Kieran departed. Leaving me and Chloe as the only two on the bus. I really wanted to talk to her, my heart was pounding, A part of my brain saying, ‘Go for it Michael, go for it lad.’  and a bigger part of me screaming ‘It's pointless, you’ve got no chance.’ My internal dialogue continued bickering before I noticed I was staring at Chloe. She noticed too. I quickly averted my eyes in sheer embarrassment, making Chloe laugh. Not a mean-spirited laugh. But a happy, bellowing laugh. As I one of her friends told her one of those jokes that would cause an entire group of people to lose their shit to. My cheeks were absolutely red hot. I If I could have seen myself, I imagine id look like a bloody strawberry with spectacles. She stopped laughing as I looked back, and she gave me a warm smile. My heart felt like it was on the brink of imploding. I almost breathed a sigh of relief as the bus stopped at Fallowfield Crescent, Chloe’s street. ‘See you tomorrow.’ She said with a smile, with my response being a pathetic and awkward wave. My heart rate slowed slightly as the minibus hit its final stop; Mine, Wolverhampton Street.

&#x200B;

I alighted the bus and head to my home, making sure to lock the door behind me. I headed into the kitchen and took a slice of cold leftover pizza from the fridge, as I closed the door, I noticed a note attached to it. ***‘Help yourself to the pizza, and remember to lock EVERY door and window, and draw the curtains. We’ll be back Monday. Love Mum xx.’*** It was 3pm now, giving me an hour to lock everything before the curfew. I quickly went through the house, from the kitchen to the living room to the bedrooms, my mind still fixated on Chloe. When I was sure I locked everything and closed the curtains, I went up to my bedroom, jumped on my PC and began playing Borderlands 2. The new DLC, Torgue’s Campaign of Carnage, had being released recently and, I was excited to play it. After a few hours of killing mobs, completing quests, and a few hits at trying to get Legendaries from bosses, I was feeling a bit peckish. It was about half past 7, so I went downstairs to get the rest of the leftover Pizza. For some reason, on my way back up, I went into the Living room and looked through the gap in the curtains. The dark streets outside were lit by streetlights, the November mist diming their rays. Just as I was about to turn around go back upstairs, I saw it. 

&#x200B;

Limping barefoot through the cold November night, was a woman. The only article of clothing on her was a dark stained white shirt. Her dark hair was covering her face. The most distinct aspect of her was the fact she seemed to be missing on her arms. My eyes were fixed on this woman, almost the same way one would with a trainwreck. I noticed more about her as she strolled under the streetlights: her legs had numerous cuts and lacerations, as did her remaining arm, the stains on her shirt were dark red, almost blood like. As the woman was passing my house, she suddenly stopped and turned in my direction. My heart dropped, my stomach knotted, and I felt the colour fleeing my face with the speed of cockroach exposed to light. The woman moved the hair from in front her face to reveal she had an ear-to-ear grin. Her eyes were as wide as those of a hungry tiger, and they were laser focused on me. I wanted to move, I wanted to run, but my body was frozen still. A part of me though she was a woman who just happened to be locked out during the curfew, and another part slowly realized this was why we had the curfew. As that thought entered my mind, with an unnatural speed that no creature, fictional or real, could muster, the woman ran to the window. I almost fell over in fright, dropping the plate of Pizza. My senses came back to me, and I sprinted up the stairs, adrenaline pumping through my veins. As I ran, I could hear that creature tapping on the window with desperate fervor. The sound getting quieter as I approached the safe haven of my room, engaging the lock on it for good measure. As I sat down on my bed, I heard the door knock.

&#x200B;

‘Please let me in! I’ve been kicked out . I need somewhere to stay during the curfew.’ A dainty voice cried out, as the door knocked again. ‘Please.’ the voice trailed off. 

&#x200B;

‘LET ME IN YOU FUCKING CUNT!’ An almost cackling screeching voice bellowed with caustic rage, as the knocking on the front door got louder and more aggressive. I could hear movement around the side of the house, and the sound of the gate that leads to the back garden rattling, almost as if something was climbing over it. ‘Please let me in.’ the voice reverted to a dainty damsel in distress, an almost sweet quality to it. ‘I'll be alright.’ I said out loud, the adrenaline starting to dissipate. Yes, this woman would be annoying, and frightening, but there's no way she could get in, everything was locked. ‘I'm safe.’ By heart dropped when I heard the distinct sound of the back door opening.

&#x200B;

‘SHIT!’ the word leaving my mouth involuntarily. Whilst I was ensuring everything was locked, I was too busy thinking about Chloe to double check everything. My heart was pounding like a jackhammer, as I quickly hid under my bed, the only thing I could think to do. There was a box under there, big enough so that I could fit my tiny frame, which I climbed under as added layer of protection against the horror that had entered my home, creating a gap so I could peak out. As I hid in my sanctuary, I tried my best calm my breathing, as I could hear the creature searching downstairs, opening cabinets, and slamming doors. The creature was talking to itself, as the reverb of its cackling witchlike voice echoed around the house. The beating of my heart increased in speed and volume as I heard that thing climbing up the stairs. It seemed that every uneven step she took, my heartrate increased by a few more beats per minute, meeting its crescendo when I heard sound of the floor creak as the creature outside my door. I put my hand over mouth to muffle the sound of my breathing, hoping the creature would hear me. The door jiggled as she attempted to open the door. A wave of naive relief washed over me. I hoped she would’ve given up and left me alone.

&#x200B;

My relief was disturbed by the loud BANG of the door violently bashed open. The wave of relief was replaced by a cold, sweaty wave of dread. The discernible smell of rotting flesh filled the air. ‘Hide and seek? I love this game!’ The cackling voice chuckled with macabre humour. My computer monitor was still on, and through the bright light, as the creature limped in, I could see her legs were a mess of lacerations, glass and debris protruding from some of the open wounds. I held my hand firmer over my mouth, paranoid that the sound of my breathing would give my location away. The monstrosity began searching through my wardrobe, rummaging around, checking if I, its quarry, was in there. Unsatisfied, It turned around. I could see its mutilated legs face in my direction, as the creature slowly crouched down. As it did so, I noticed that the fingers on its singular arm had razor sharp, long claws on them, almost Freddy Krueger like in a twisted way. The creature crawled under my bed, looking around with its sunken in, insane eyes. Searching around like a Predator hunting its prey. ‘I can smell you.’ The creature said in a low, creepy sing-song voice. As it got closer, I noticed that what I thought was a smile earlier, was the furthest thing from the truth. The creature's ‘smile’ was instead a deep ear-to-ear Chelsea grin, sliced into its face. Its lips were also removed, exposing its chipped and rotten teeth. The stench of decay intensified as the creature got closer to my hiding place. The relentless beating of my heart was the only sound I could hear as the creatures' eyes met mine, glowing with sadistic madness. For what felt like hours, that creature stared, I couldn’t take my eyes off it. ‘That’s it, I’m dead. I'm going to die.’ Was the only thought that filled my mind as the creature continued to stare, its smile seeming to grow wider, its rotten halitosis almost making me vomit.

Suddenly the creature simply got up from under my bed and walked away, searching the other bedrooms before I heard it walking down the stairs and leaving through the backdoor. I didn’t dare sleep or move until the sun had risen. 

At 8:30am the next day, I arrived at school, sleep deprived and still shaken up from the night before. I stopped by a corner shop to grab a few energy drinks, realizing I probably wouldn’t be able to get through the day without them. The visage of that creature still stuck in my head like a song. As I went into my form room, I sat next to Ryan. 

‘Fucking Hell, you look like shit! Up all night?’ He quipped. I didn’t really have the energy to tell him the whole story, so I just nodded. I noticed Chloe wasn’t in today. Which was a very strange as she was always the type to be in early and rarely called in sick. 

‘Where’s Chloe?’ I asked Ryan

‘Probably just sick. Probably not feeling it today.’ He chuckled. Our form tutor came in, looking solemn. After quieting everyone down, she made an announcement.

‘First period is cancelled, there's going to be an assembly for the Year 9s and Year 11s, so as soon as bell rings head to the hall.’

After she took the register and bell rang, we all packed our bags and headed for the hall. 

The assembly hall was absolutely filled by the time we got there. At the front was the headteacher, Miss Mansfield, our Head of Year Mr Burke, the deputy headteacher Mrs Dasgupta, and 2 police officers. My heart began to sink, the colour in my face drained, my gut feeling was telling me this had something to do with Chloe, and that fucking creature. We all sat down, a rapt audience. 

‘Good morning Year 9.’ Miss Mansfield said. ‘I...’ she was struggling to find the words for her announcement, the feeling in my gut intensified. ‘I have some really bad news.’ She finally announced, surveying the room, momentarily locking eyes with for a second.

‘Chloe Fairview is currently in hospital. She’s very badly injured, and it's not looking good.’ She almost chocked up. ‘Unfortunately, her sister, Roseanna Fairview, and the rest of the family, have sadly passed away. That is all we a prepared to say now.’ I felt like I was going to throw up. My gut feeling was correct. Someone at Chloes house must’ve accidentally left a window unlocked or forgot to double check the locks on the backdoor, and now. Chloe was fighting for her life, and her family was dead. I felt dizzy and nauseous, not just about Chloe and her family, but the fact that could’ve easily have been me, either dead or gravely injured.

The next few months and years were a bit of whirlwind. I visited Chloe in hospital, the extent of her injuries was almost indescribable. She looked like she’d almost being cut to ribbons. Lacerations and bandaged covered her entire body, and she was in medically induced coma. It was heart-breaking to see the girl I liked so much in a such a dire state. She made a full recovery eventually, but she ended up having to move in with family up in Warwickshire, and I never saw her again. After I told them my story and when they heard about what happened to Chloe, my family sold the house and moved to Crouch End. I am still haunted by the events of that night. I’ve had almost constant nightmares about that creature ripping me to shreds, even years after I moved away from that area. I’ve been drinking a lot to cope with the memories.

&#x200B;

Recently though, curiosity got the better of me and I did a bit of reading to try and find out what the creature was, and what its origins were and the origins of the curfew. The only things I could find was about the murder of a prostitute in the 1960’s. The found her body, mutilated beyond recognition, but apart from that, she was intact, left arm included. But I found that the curfews had been going on since the 1600s. The next thing I found was, a bit more, chilling to say the least. In 1634 a woman, accused of being a witch, was brutally lynched by the townspeople of Trafford-On-Thames. When the dust settled, her crumpled form, missing her left arm, was burned. As she screamed in agony, it was said she cursed the town, coming back once a year to inflict the same agony she suffered on to them. In the article I saw an artist's depiction of the lynching, and a cold chill ran down my spine, and the memories of that night flooded back. In the painting, dated 29th November 1634, as the ‘witch’ was being dragged by the mob, I saw her face almost smiling, grin sliced from ear to ear, and lips removed. But that wasn’t the only thing that terrified me during my reading. I found an article from the Trafford post, dated 30th November 2021. ‘Family of 4, found brutally murdered on Wolverhampton Street.’

She still out there.

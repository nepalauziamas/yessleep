He said that he could put him back together. And in my grief, the lack of sense it caused, I believed him. I gave him the bundle of remains, and left him to do his “work”. I was told to come back the next day, and that no matter what happened, I not lose hope. Hope, he said, was as important to the whole procedure as the actual piecing together of the body. Hope is what would allegedly allow the still-lingering spirit to return to the reconstructed vessel. So, I went home, stifled my panic with wine, and I hoped... 

The next day I returned to his house with a positive outlook, a night’s rest having helped settle my nerves a bit and embolden my optimism. He answered promptly, dressed in tailored black suit, and giving no immediate impression that anything had gone wrong. Smiling, he welcomed me inside and took my hat and jacket. Guiding me into his living room, we sat down opposite one another and he offered me coffee, which I accepted.  

The morning light came in bountifully through the unshaded window, giving the space a nice comfy atmosphere. I felt assured by this more than anything that the procedure had gone well; my logic being that nothing bad could’ve happened in such a nice home, under such pleasant circumstances.  

He returned with two steaming cups of coffee, and began the conversation by asking how I’d slept, and how I was feeling. I answered that I had slept well, and was feeling similarly; admitting to my sleep-kindled optimism regarding the procedure’s outcome. And while he’d been smiling the whole time, I noticed a slight twitch in face upon direct mention of the procedure. The smile didn’t exactly wane, but it shifted, a little; and I felt a small pang of anxiety at seeing such a reaction. But still, I kept my thoughts from darkening, and asked how he was doing. He replied that all was well, and then took a long, almost contemplative sip of his coffee. Now a little nervous, I did the same—if only to keep myself from losing my composure.  

Finishing his sip, he then turned his attention to a box on the coffee table, which I hadn’t noticed. He set his mug down beside it and withdrew a small collapsible knife from his pocket, which he then used to open a slit in the box’s tape binding. For some reason, the carefulness with which he had conducted this simple maneuver made me nervous; as if the act had instead been performed on a body, the knife actually a scalpel, the box a person. I watched with bated breath as he delicately opened the panels, revealing what initially appeared to be an empty interior. Folding the panels back so that they’d stay, he then withdrew a handkerchief from his other pocket, and used this to scoop out an object from box.  

He placed it on the table beside the box, leaving the handkerchief beneath it. Sitting back in his chair and folding his hands in his lap, he allowed me to view the object unobstructed. For a few moments, I simply stared; at first confounded, and then rendered speechless once the morbid reality fully set in.  

Resting on the sky-blue handkerchief, *staining it*, was a **beating human heart.**  

“I know you left me with considerably more than that, but the process of reanimation takes a great toll upon the remains. It demands mass, energy, and while I can provide an adequate supply of the latter, the former must of course come from the subject. It’s why it’s always best to have the procedure performed as soon as possible following the subject’s demise. The more time that passes, the less of them there is to use. You only gave me...well, the cost is obvious. I managed to endow the heart with life—but that is the only thing left.”  

The heart, beating impossibly without any supplemental veins, arteries, or even blood, seemed to fill the room with its steady **thump-thump.** My head swam, a delirium threatening to overtake me; and in a moment of greater unreality and horror, I felt my own heart automatically match the pace of this bodiless one.  

“I know, believe me, I know. It’s an incredible thing—you'd think impossible. But my methods, the abilities I possess, can instill life within even the most rudimentary element of man, so long as it has not been damaged beyond mortal repair. The heart itself is in excellent shape. You need only find a suitable vessel, and the transplantation should go without issue. Of course, that is something that I myself cannot perform—lest the vessel also be one without life.”  

The unthinkable implication of his words, the dark reality of what he was suggesting, almost caused me to lose my mind right there. I gripped my chair for balance and fumbled for my coffee, almost knocking over the mug. Trembling, I brought it to my lips, but immediately put it on the floor behind me—out of sight—upon seeing the liquid ebb and flow within the cup in response to the synchronous beating of my heart and the other. The room itself seemed to shift and pulsate along with the pulsing organs, and the man appeared to stretch inhumanly in my anxiety-skewed vision. Unable to bear the maddening, disorienting circumstances, i stood up and went to the window; hoping to calm myself in the open scope of the sunlight.  

“There is another way—if you do not think you’d be able to acquire a lifeless vessel. Flesh is flesh, after all. I am primarily worried about consent. If you’d be willing, *if you’d trust me to*, I could transplant the heart into your body, allowing you both to inhabit a single vessel. There will of course be physiological complications, permanent lifestyle adjustments that would need to be made—but I can assure you that you’d live, that you’d **both** live long, mostly comfortable lives. It would not be an unprecedented cardiac condition.”  

Outside, two children rode by on their bikes, one chasing another. The sight felt providential, given the circumstances; invoking memories of my own childhood, spent playing and riding with my brother. Turning away from the window, I brought my eyes to those of the man—the Necromancer—and gave him my answer. 

“I’ll do it. Put my brother’s heart in me.”  

He smiled and nodded, then gestured for me to sit down. Standing, he gathered the heart in his hands and handed it to me, telling me to hold it carefully and lightly in my lap, so as to not interrupt its beating. I expected him to then have me follow him into some kind of operation room, but he simply returned to his seat, although he shifted it so that it was facing me completely, rather than at an angle.  

“Two things, before we begin. One: I will, in accordance with my very specific skillset, have to kill you—but you will only be dead for a few short moments, just the duration of the procedure, and then I will bring you back to life. The manner of death will be quick and utterly painless. And the second thing: While you are “under”, you may experience what some would call oblivion, nothingness—the lightless or light-filled void. I haven’t experienced such a thing myself, having never needed to die, but I’ve heard varying accounts of the same general thing from past clients. You must simply not allow yourself to fall into such things and places. Try to maintain a stable, concrete mind. A fortified self. Basically, don’t go into the light—if there is one. Or I’ll only bring back the body, and not the life-force that had powered it.”  

This new information brought the black tingling of dread to my heart, quickening its pace a little, but I suppressed the feeling and nodded in understanding—knowing that if I were to speak, my voice would crack and I’d lose any confidence I might’ve had in myself. The man smiled his characteristic smile, and held up both his hands with the palms facing outward. On his left hand was a tattoo of a minus sign, and on his right, a tattoo of a a plus sign. Both tattoos were solid black, with no accompanying words or supplemental details.  

“We will now begin. You’ll hear more than feel a ‘crack’, and then the next thing you’ll experience *as a living being* will be the double-beat of your twin hearts.”  

I took a deep breath, perplexed as to what he might to do “kill” me—and then a loud *CRACK* filled my vision with a nuclear flash. But rather than be thrown back into a light-filled reality, I instead found myself immersed in a dizzyingly vast space, filled with a kaleidoscopic array of colors and shades—most of which I had never seen before. There was no infinitely black void or blinding whiteness, but a vista of animate, molten color, through which I was flying or floating as a thing without form or frame; a phantasmal or vaporous entity hurtling aimlessly through a painter’s wet dream. 

Initially, it was enjoyable, liberating in an inexpressible way. I found myself wanting to merge with this spatially boundless place, to join with the amorphous congregations of color. But the Necromancer’s words, providentially remembered or perhaps even heard amidst the soundless, polychromatic pandemonium, kept me from giving myself away. The desire to allow myself to be unmade and incorporated into the tempestuous rainbows and multi-hued vortexes was almost irresistible. It became terrifying, the sheer power of its allure, and I had to fight with the full extent of my cognition just to keep the nebulous form I had. I saw glimmering gaseous wisps and variegated cloud-forms, and something told me that these things had once been human, but were now spirits of color, orbiting one another in thoughtless spectral ecstasy.  It was unbelievable, breathtaking -  horrific. 

Thankfully, just before an undulant sea of some brilliant, ineffable shade of red could rise and envelop me, I was suddenly back in the man’s living room, gazing at the dull white of his ceiling.  

*And before I could even consciously acknowledge it, my body told me that I had been given a second heart.*  

“The operation was, of course, a success. You now harbor the heart of your brother within you, and through you he will live on. His spirit, his love, his passion—they reside within you, now.”  

And I felt it—I felt my brother’s spirit flaming anew within me, entwining with my own. I sensed, spiritually, his presence, felt my soul being bolstered by his. It was a wonderful, beautiful feeling; to finally have my brother back, after all those lonely nights without him. He’d taken his own life, destroying his brain—his brilliant and kind and tortured mind. I wish I could’ve saved that, too. Or rather, I wish I could’ve prevented him from succumbing to his despair.... But having his heart and all that came with it, that was more than I could’ve ever asked for, given the circumstances.  

I thanked the man, nearly falling into him with gratitude. He hugged me, wished me the best of luck, and escorted me out. Outside, the day was beautiful—the sunlight resplendent and warm. The colors of the day were just right: not strange, nameless, and over-bearing—like that weird, ultra-chromatic after-life—but measured, natural, perfect. I put a hand on my hearts to feel their synchronous activity, and then headed home.

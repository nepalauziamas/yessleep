"A demon."

"Yeah man, that's what I've been trying to tell you. A demon wrecked my place last night."

Dave looked up from his phone. "Are you sure it's  not just your latest excuse for your crappy housekeeping habits? I mean, really? A demon?"

I shook my head a little. "Come on man, that's harsh. But yeah, really, a demon. You know the PS5 controller I borrowed from you last week?" 

Dave nodded and laid his phone on the breakroom table. He sat back as he said, "Yeah, what about it?"

"The demon stepped on it!" I stomped my foot "smash, into a hundred pieces!"

Dave glanced down at his phone then back up at me. "Ok, let's say it was a demon. How did a demon get into your living room?" 

I stepped back a half step and looked down at the table. "Well, I, uh, I kinda summoned it" I mumbled, trying to say it without saying it.

"You summoned a demon. Ok. How, exactly, did you summon a demon?" 

I looked back up at him. "Well, that book I told you I found, the one in that weird language, remember?"

Dave nodded.

"Well, it turns out that there's a translator app that can use your camera to read it. So, I went through and translated a bunch of stuff and read it and figured out how to do a summoning ritual."

Dave leaned forward and put his forearms on the table, palms flat. "You did all this? Really?" 

"Hey man, I'm not stupid you know. I know how to do a lot of stuff and I can figure things out pretty good sometimes."

Dave nodded as he shifted back again and crossed his arms. "And yet you summoned a demon in your living room and let it trash the place."

I could only nod a little. "Well, yeah, I did do that, but I didn't expect him to trash the place. That wasn't part of the plan."

"Ok, so, what was the plan? What are you planning that requires a demon?"

I smiled. "Well, getting rich and stuff. You know, and not having to be afraid of anyone or having to work or whatever. Just doing anything I want whenever I want."

Dave just looked at me. He stared at me until it got uncomfortable. I started shifting my weight back and forth until I couldn't take it anyomre. "What, man? Why are you just staring at me?"

He spoke slowly and carefully. "I can see why someone might try to summon a demon to get all those things, freedom and stuff. But I'm still not sure I can believe you actually did it."

I nodded a little. "Yeah, ok, I get it man. That's fair I guess. But I'm not lying, I swear."

Dave nodded. "I can see that you believe it. So I'm not going to try and argue with you. But now I have to ask, what's next? Is your demon going to give you what you ask for?" 

I nodded. "Yep. Today! Just as soon as he's done, uh, taking care of a few things... a few, you know, demon things..."

Dave started to speak but before he could we heard screaming out on the plant floor. His eyes darted to the door then back at me. 

I nodded. "Look man, I really like you so I decided to give you a chance. If you stay in here with me then you won't get hurt. Because I'm in here this room is off limits. But," I turned and pointed towards the door. There was more screaming and the sound of machinery and stuff being thrown around. "If you decide you just have to run out and try to help or save anyone then you're fair game." 

I turned back to face him, leaned over and put my hands on the table. "Stay here, man. You've got a family. I'll hook you up and..."

Dave slid his chair back and stood up, eyes wide and completely freaked out. "You crazy or something? What the hell is wrong with you?" 

The screams and the sounds of destruction were overwhelming as he ran out the door. It faded some when the door closed. 

I stood back up, put my hands on my hips and looked at the door. "Dangit Dave, that's why I really wanted you to stay with me. You always were such a great guy."

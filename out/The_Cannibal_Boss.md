What I'm about to tell you will make you wish this wasn't true.

I'm about to tell you the story of the most horrifying and frightening event of my life.

Let's begin.

It's 2017. I'm Fayzer Raven, 24 year old guy, trying to make his hobby a career. My hobby is music, I love playing guitar and keyboard and singing, and I wanna form a metal band, I would be the lead singer. I'm no way near achieving this dream of mine, so I need a better job to get by. Right now I'm working as a receptionist at a small hotel, my friends say I'm good at selling shit, and making people believe stuff that's not even true, so they tell me I should try going into sales and I liked the idea, so just like that I join this small company called Emerson Retail Inc. I got the job as the salesman. It's my first day at the job and I meet my boss, my first impression was, damn this guy is scary! He was a tall fucker, over 6'4, borderline obese and he looked scary! Then I meet my colleagues, I liked them none of the colleagues are scary haha, then we all start to work and do our job. Then it's a lunch break, I forgot my lunch in my car so I went to take it, and saw something that seemed a little weird.

 I saw my boss going inside what looked to me like a storeroom, I went to check and the door said "NO ONE ALLOWED HERE EXCEPT THE BOSS" I thought "hmm that's weird!" I went back inside the office to have lunch, then continued in with my day, did my job went back home.

 Now 2 weeks have passed, everyday I noticed something weird, the boss' behavior, the weird stench in the office, blood drops outside the office that have dried and turned brown, I asked my my colleague Mikaela Pearce, who has become a good friend of mine, I asked her do you notice anything weird here? She said yes, and she told me she asked the boss whose blood are these? He said one of the workers cut their fingers, so it's nothing to worry about. She said he seemed annoyed by her question. 

We both think the boss is up to something bad. Now weeks pass by, some colleagues don't seem to notice weird stuff in the office, but me and Mikaela and 2 other guys did we noticed everything, we noticed some people just disappearing and not coming to the office, the boss' behavior, more blood outside the office around the area where the boss went at lunch time, our suspicion about out boss grew even more. Our worry about our safety grew everyday, we told the police about the people in the office just disappearing, they looked into it and they said the people we're talking about didn't exist in the first place, Mikaela and I were dumbfounded.

 Then the next day I decided that we should hide and see the boss going inside the weird room outside the office. Mikaela and I found a hiding spot, I brought 2 binoculars, as soon as the lunch time came we went to the hiding spot to find out why he goes inside thay room everyday at lunch time, we're waiting for him to come as soon as he came we got ready and started seeing with our binocular. And what we saw, no one would believe me if I didn't take the photos. 

There were dead bodies of the people that disappeared from the office! The boss forgot to close the door completely, we could easily see everything with our binoculars. Not only that he was eating them, and he was storing their dead bodies inside that room, we saw a head of one of our colleagues who disappeared without a trace. We were so horrified and frightened we just froze, Mikalea started crying, what we saw was so horrifying, so petrifying than anything we've ever seen before! He was a fucking cannibal! 

We got up and started to head towards my car, now I have the photos, I have the evidence to show the police! I accidentally dropped my binocular and I was going to collect it, as I was going the fucking cannibal came out of the room, now the asshole isn't dumb so he realized that I found out about his cannibalism. He started running towards me with a machete, I ran to my car, Mikalea was already inside my car. I take off so fast from there I had never done anything that fast before, I go to the police station Mikaela and I show them the photos and tell them everything!

I'm glad he's in jail now, he received a death sentence.
What scares me the most is that he wasn't alone, some of the workers in that office were cannibals too, they were with him! We were working around cannibals! And they were paying someone to erase all the record of the people they ate, the police still haven't found who they were paying to erase their records and everything, I couldn't even describe how scary it was, I can't put it into words! And now 5 years later 2022, the trauma it has caused us is awful, we still go to therapy. But the good thing is I formed a band and I'm doing really good, also Mikalea and I are engaged, we went through that shit together so we thought we'll go through everything together.

This was very long and if you read this I thank you very much for reading. Goodbye.

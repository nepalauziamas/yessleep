“Seriously David, you can’t just keep lounging around all day and night.” My father’s once calm voice had given way to irritation. Another week, another lecture. I simply remained laid back on my bed, vacant eyes adrift in the trail of the hypnotic ceiling fan . 

“Look at me when I’m talking to you!” His voice boomed out, my trance completely shattered. Hesitantly, I sat up and locked my eyes with his. We had rehearsed this monologue over and over again, yet that serrated glance still burrowed into my flesh. Warm metallic taste graced my taste buds as I bit down on my cheek.

“It’s been more than a year since you graduated High School and all you’ve done is sit on the computer!” Arms wildly flailed at my old shitty computer, my Dad’s irritation now utterly evolved into outrage. I shifted my eyes away from my Dad’s and instead caught sight of my Mom. She had been standing in the hallway the entire time. I had to yank my gaze back to my Father, her disappointment always burned worse.

“You are addicted to those games and I know it!” It felt like the walls would fall away from his intense shouts. “And just like any addict, those things are going to get you killed!”

“Dad I…” I started to mumble out, yet a rough finger snap cut my practiced response short. 

“I don’t want to hear it anymore. We are not going to enable this lifestyle any longer. One month, that’s all you have left.” Cold words devoid of any care washed over my shocked body. I didn’t even get a chance to respond before he slammed my door shut.

“Honey, are you really sure we should do this?” My Mom’s barely audible voice bled through my thin door. The conversation retreated away from my room, my ears strained to pick up their muted discussion. I quickly gave up on that idea when I realized it meant I would have to abandon the comfort of my bed. With a broken sigh I laid back down and looked at my clock, it was only Six in the afternoon.

Sleep refused to drown away my troubled thoughts. Moments of escape tossed away only an hour later. No matter how much I begged for release, it was never granted. One in the morning rolled around and I had finally given up. Times like these made me fall into the love filled arms of my computer. Fans whirred away the deafening silence, the monitor light incinerated my dark adapted eyes. 

Windows greeted me like it was any other day. Judgements that had stained my sanity washed away as I browsed the different discord game servers I was a part of. Finally, after what felt like thousands of years, I smiled. So many different chats were alive all at once and it was hard to choose one. After I gave it a small Ponder I had decided to nudge my way into the newest server I had found. 

This was the first time I had actually looked into what was on the server. I had simply discovered the creator on one of my late night browsing sessions on Itch.io. Only one single game under the creator’s belt, and yet it was some of the most fun I had in ages! 

I clicked on the server icon and immediately noticed the highlighted “New Releases” tab. There was a new game already? 

“Mors Tua Vita Mea” I murmured out while clicking on the download button. Weird name and yet I had seen weirder before. It only took a few minutes for the download to complete and when it was done I didn’t hesitate to launch right into it.

No title screen, instead I was thrusted right into the action. The game looked like any other generic RPGMaker game, yet the character sprite was what really caught my eye. Tall, lanky, pale, that is what I would say to describe my character. Rather uniquely it seemed like I was a monster in a horror game. My figure loomed outside a darkened household. 

With a press of a key I walked forwards to the front door and interacted with it.

**Locked. Find another way in.**

“Just a way to pad for game time I guess” I thought to myself. It didn’t help that every step took ages. Each step would only happen a couple seconds after I pressed my movement key. I could only assume it was to simulate the movements of this shambler beast. 

Eventually I found a window that had been left slightly cracked open and slipped inside. 

**Find them.**

With each lumbering step further into the house there was a tingle at the back of my neck. This didn’t feel right but I couldn’t explain why that was no matter how hard I tried. I kept up the pace and searched every last corner of the foreboding residence. Frustration had boiled over inside me, there was no clue as to what I had to even do here. I just interacted with every item in hopes that I could get a clue.

**Flowers in a vase with a sickly sweet aroma.**

**Fridge filled with a variety of nauseating food.**

**A dusty stove,  it could be useful.**

**Drawer with sharp knives, not necessary.**

After the dull exploration throughout the house I finally came towards a hallway. There were two doors down the unlit passage. I took a step forward. Thump! My skin crawled and I turned around. “Was that a footstep?” My mind was abuzz with endless thoughts. I swore I just heard footsteps outside my room. 

Thump! Another singular loud step outside my door. I turned towards my computer and almost had a panic attack, my sprite had moved on its own. 
“Fuck this!” I yelled out. I didn’t care if my parents woke up, in fact I wanted them to. At this moment I wanted so many different things to happen.Maybe this was just a nightmare, maybe it was all in my head? 

I tried to close the game. Thump!

**Find them.**

I tried to unplug my computer. Thump!

**Find them.**

I tried to open my window. Thump!

**Find them.**

I tried to call for help on my phone. Thump!

**Find them.**

I tried to open my door. Thump!

**Find them.**

I tried to wake my parents with a crescendo of bangs. Thump!

**Find them.**

I watched that sprite slide further and further down the hall. It passed by the door that I knew was my room. Without any input from myself, it went to the door at the end of the hall and opened the door. Two figures were cuddled together in bed in peaceful slumber. The creature's claw twitched and I blacked out.

My eyes fluttered open, the bright sunny day blasted through my blinds. I was dazed, my mind blanked and tried to catch up to the memories that wanted to resurface. Steadily the visions of the previous night came into focus. I vaulted out of my bed, ready to burst out of the house and call for help.

I made it to my room’s door and was ready to open it when a fragrance stopped me. It smelt like freshly cooked bacon. I took a deep breath, sighed, and laughed. Breakfast! They had cooked breakfast. It really was just a dream. I jumped right on my computer, it was time to put out those job applications that I kept putting off. 

When the computer booted up I was surprised to see Discord launch on its own, I didn’t have that option set. There was one new message from an unknown account. I don’t know why but I felt drawn to open it, to read it. With a shaky click I opened the message and read out those two words that made my heart sink.

“Found them.”

I and my friends like exploring scary places, places where people have died or creepy things have happened. This time, we visited a relatively unknown lake where apparently a ton of people have gone missing. We read about it online, and decided, why not? So, there we were. Standing at the top of its cliffside, peering out at the said big lake.

"God, it's soooo hot out."

Ashley groans, exaggerating the, "so". Her blonde hair glistened in the sunlight as she was fanning herself.

"Well we're at the lake for a reason, right?"

Johnson reminds, his tall height forcing him to cover his face with his hand, and his army dog tag burning up on his skin.

"Well yeahhhh, but,-"

She sighs,

"I don't want to get wet."

I snicker

"Shut up Adin."

Johnson peers over the edge,

"Well, that is a pretty long drop."

He walks behind Ashley,

"Hey Ash, do you have any other clothes?"

Ashley shakes her head, not noticing that Johnson was behind her.

"Man, that sucks."

Johnson then thrusts his arms into the back of Ashley, pushing her into the dark blue abyss below. We hear the massive splash, as Johnson breaks into a laugh.

"Ok Adin, our turn!"

Johnson then sprints and jumps way out in the distance, cannonballing into the water. I decided to do the same, splashing into the water just like Johnson. But, whilst trying to open my eyes, I'm greeted with unexpected green and dirty water, unlike the blue water I had just observed. I swam up to the top, wiped my face, and noticed that Ashley and Johnson were gone. I looked around and noticed another difference, the trees began to sweat leaves off their branches. Slowly drifting into the water, covering the top of it like a carpet.

"Guys!? Where are you?"

My voice echoed through the lake, with a deafening silence in response. I took one last shout,

"GUYS! THIS ISN"T FUNNY! WHERE ARE-"

My belligerent shouting was cut off, as I felt something grip my ankle. A shock of fear shot through my back and left a cold sensation in my throat. I immediately started kicking, whipping my body around in a desperate attempt to get the object, or worse, person, off of me.

"Adin."

I heard my name cry out from somewhere, I barely heard it as my name bounced back and forth in my head, it had sounded like Ashley. I scrambled to kick the thing, a newfound determination filling up in my heart with the possibility of finding my friends, I made a good distance away from my previous location, but the thing still held on just as strong as it had before. I completely shifted my focus from kicking to swimming, slowly but surely making it to land.

"ADIN!"

This time, Johnson's voice blasted through the water, I could see a little ripple where he had landed from the jump.

"JOHN!?"

I shouted out, hoping to get a response.

"ADIN! YOU NEED TO GO UNDER THE WATER! YOU NEED TO HELP US!"

I swam just enough to get ahold of the trunk of a tree, gripping it for dear life.

"JOHN! WHAT"S HAPPENING!"

I choked the words out of my throat.

"JUST HEL-"

Johnson's voice and the ripples in the water were cut off, my body was quaking with intimidation and fear.

"ADIN!!! PLEASE HELP US!!!"

I then heard Ashley's voice, also rippling through the water much closer to my location. I looked down at the thing clinging to my ankle, then turned to the land in search of an item I could use to get it off me. I spotted a sharp stick covered by the leaves. I closed my eyes, took a deep breath, and plunged the stick into where I thought the thing was. Thankfully, I felt its grip loosen and drop away. But it took my stick with it. My next step was to find Ashley, so I took another deep breath, and let go of the tree. Thrusting myself back into the green abyss that had now been near impossible to see from the leaves. I sunk low and peeled open my eyes.

I saw Ashley and Johnson, wrapped up by some tentacle. I followed the tentacle down into the water, searching for something to get them out. But instead of something useful, I was greeted by two ginormous eyes staring back at me from the floor of the lake. It was like a mini Kraken with Its huge arms that were seemingly glued to the floor and walls of the lake, besides the ends of two arms, that instead, were open in a fly trap-like state. Whilst examing, the being began to shake, as a loud groan escaped from it. I shot away from the being, looking at the tentacles that kept Johnson and Ashley caged. Johnson's mouth was covered which explains why he stopped speaking. I gripped the arms holding Ashley in place and tugged. It came off surprisingly easily, I grabbed her, and swam to the top. I heard her coughing and spitting up something whilst I went back down into the trap. 

I saw Johnson, well, the massive heap of tentacles that were covering his body I saw. There was much more covering him than Ashley. Like as if the monster couldn't let Johnson go away. I tried the same technique as I did with Ashley, gripping and tugging. But it was so compact that I couldn't even get a good grip. I heard a splash, turned, and spotted Ashley swimming down to me. She too, gripped and tugged, but met the same fate. We didn't know what to do until Ashley's face lit up. As she swam behind Johnson and moved back to me with a pocket knife in hand. She began to carve up its arms, allowing me to tug at them. The beast screamed and shouted, moaning and groaning. We were almost there, almost able to get Johnson before a tentacle gripped my ankle and pulled me down to the ground with immense strength and speed. The impact caused the air to leave my lungs, and I struggled to hold my breath. I went to go rip it off me, but I stopped dead in my tracks when I realized I was in a massive graveyard of corpses and skeletons. Some corpses were not even fully decomposed, and I could see their dead, soulless, eyes staring at me. The shock gave the being enough time to shoot another one of its arms at me, Pinning me to the ground. I was stuck, barely able to move. I tried to struggle, but my empty lungs caused me to slowly drown, as my body filled up with water. My throat burned, and I could feel my body grow weaker with each second. Slowly, my vision clouded, until I blacked out.

I awoke on land in a stir, hacking a lung up. Figuratively, thankfully. My friends, Johnson and Ashley, were sitting there with me. Ashley was holding a blood-coated knife shaking violently, rocking back and forth, her clothes were stained by some strange blue liquid. Johnson, like me, was also coughing up a lung.

"What happened?"

Ashley's head shot to me, a smile crafted on her face while I realized the tears falling from her eyes.

"ADIN!"

She shot into a hug, Johnson was against a tree holding his chest and breathing heavily.

"Your alive!"

Ashley let go of her grip, wiping away tears. Her clothes smelt horrible.

"Ash, Adin, we need to head to a hospital. We need to get checked."

Johnson whispered, still gripping his chest. His voice was coarse and difficult to hear.

"yeah, I agree. But, what even was that thing dude? What did it do to you? Where did you guys go?"

Johnson took some deep breaths, shaking his head. Ashley cut in,

"I don't know what happened to John, but, for me, when I landed in the water it all turned green. And when I got back to the top something grabbed me, and yanked me down. I spent my last breaths screaming out for you, Adin. Before I passed out."

I turned back to Johnson,

"Was your experience similar?"

Johnson just nodded,

"Look guys I'm-"

He kept taking deep breathes in between sentences,

"I'm being serious that we need to head to a hospital. I'm not ok. It's still difficult to breathe."

I and Ashley nodded,

"I left my phone up on the cliff. I'll go call 911, but real quick, how did you guys save me?"

Johnson pointed to Ashley, and Ashley looked down in disgust.

"I stabbed that demon in the eye, that's what this blue stuff on me is. Its blood. Now go and call 911 before Johnson gets worse."

This happened to me about a week ago, we went to the hospital, got checked, and are all fine now. Besides Johnson, his torso was being crushed by the creature. That's why so many tentacles were wrapped around him, he's suffering from a respiratory problem and it's uncertain he'll be able to breathe as he did before. We thought about calling the cops, but before we did we went back to see if the creature was still there, and, it wasn't. So even if the police did believe us, we have 0 evidence to prove it. I wrote this to tell everyone about my experience with this strange Kraken creature. You can believe me if you want, or don't. It doesn't even matter, I can't prove anything besides the traumatizing memories engrained in my brain. I just needed to tell someone, anyone, and get this off my chest without feeling or looking like I belong in a mental institution.

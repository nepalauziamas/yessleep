My husband has been away on a business trip up north for the last few days. I work as a wedding caterer, so I often have to work late and in some pretty remote places. The other night I finished working a venue around 11:30pm, my colleague took the van back to our warehouse. I had drove myself to the venue which was an old barn in the middle of the countryside. As I left the venue I was hoping other guests were coming my way but unfortunately not. I only lived 30 minutes away but my journey home took me through single track roads surrounded by farmland. As I turned off the main road onto the rural track I hastily turned my lights to full beam. 

Around 10 minutes in, the road began to narrow, the branches of sidelining trees brushed against my car. I was only going around 20MPH as I cautiously made my way through, I was conscious that a car could come towards me at any moment. Suddenly something emerged from a bush up ahead, my apprehension caused me to jump as I hit the brakes. A small deer walked across the road and disappeared into the parallel trees. I laughed, getting scared of a deer I thought, mainly to compose myself. I never liked the dark as it was. A noise then echoed behind me like someone had tapped their  fingernails down my back windscreen in a wave like motion. I slowly peered into my rear view mirror expecting to see a horror straight out of a Stephen King Novel. 

My eyes were only met by darkness, I locked the car doors to try to ease my fear. I put the car in drive and pressed my foot down firmly on the accelerator. My tyres span as I weaved through the winding trail, all I wanted to do was to get home. I turned the corner, as my headlights exposed a looming figure in front of me, I slammed the brakes but it was to late. They went under, I felt every bump my stomach sinking with each and every one. I came to a stop. Thoughts racing through my mind, I’m going to jail was my first thought then quickly to the fact I had just killed someone. I was in shock, I couldn’t bring myself to look back, smoke filled the air around me. I forced myself to turn my head eventually, the mangled body lay on the cold dusty road. 

I didn’t even have time to compose myself when to my horror, their head twisted to face me. Their arms followed twisting and planting down in front of them, the loose ripped shirt hung around its torso. The startling thing was this person didn’t have a face, no hair, no eyes, no nose or mouth. These features were replaced by thick ridged scars, as they glowed in my bright red taillights. I froze, I couldn’t process what was happening. This wasn’t normal, this was no man or woman. I panicked and the adrenaline kicked in. I shifted into reverse and stamped on the pedal the engine roared as I launched backwards, there was a crash off my rear bumper followed by the jaggering bumps under my right side wheels. I quickly shifted into drive and sped of down the road. As I drove off I peered back into my mirror, the road behind me being swallowed by darkness. I couldn’t see any of the hallowing scene that I had left behind. 

I continued up the road with my hands gripping the steering wheel, looking in my rear view mirror every couple of seconds. I had 3 miles to go until I got to a main road and I slowly increased my speed to escape the horrific incident, I came to the main road and continued home. I leapt out of the car and fumbled my keys to try to unlock my front door. My heart was still racing from the terrifying experience. I opened the door, rushed through and locked it straight away. I pressed my back against it and sighed in relief. I tried calling my husband but now being past midnight he didn’t answer, I turned the TV on and tried to calm myself down. 

After 20 minutes I was finally able to breathe normally and was getting tired. I went to get a glass of water from the kitchen, I stopped, rooted to the spot. It was in the window. The now bloodied head pressed up against the glass behind my sink not moving. I shakily got out my phone and called the police, they were here within minutes. As I went through what I had saw to the officers I could see the disbelief in their faces, I was hoping the blood on the window would prove it but it was gone. They left me 45 minutes later, I was still a nervous wreck but by this point I just wanted to go to bed. I made sure everything was locked and headed upstairs.

After a broken nights sleep I woke the next morning, to my surprise my husband was home and laying next to me. I was still half asleep as a rolled over to hug him, maybe the police had checked in with him to come home and I had slept through his phone calls. He startled and turned. My eyes began to adjust, this wasn’t my husband. The deep bloodstained ridges were now inches from my face, I screamed out of pure horror. I grabbed the nearest thing to me, a glass and smashed it over it’s disfigured head. I escaped through the door and ran out of the house while grabbing my bag. I got in the car and sped off down the road, my fuel was getting low. I knew I wasn’t going to get far enough away so went straight to the train station. I jumped on the first train to near where my husband is working, I have spoken to him and I am doing OK. As I sit here writing this post, I still can’t process what’s happened to me the last 12 hours and I’m still pretty shaken.

I just don’t know what to do, when I get to my husband, we will figure something out. All I know for sure is I am not going back to that house, not alone. My main fear now, is it has got attached to me.

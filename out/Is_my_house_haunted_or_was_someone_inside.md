 I live in a raised house where the garage is underneath and the only way to enter the house is by opening garage door and coming up the stairs. The garage is not fully enclosed. It has slats going top to bottom with about 1/2" gap between going all around. To help keep weather out we put up brown tarps along insides so you can't see in and from the outside it just looks like wood. 

The garage door works by remote and also by an app on our phone. So I am home alone and around 11:30pm I hear the garage door open. After a minute it closed again.
 I immediately called my husband and asked if he opened the garage door and he said no. It was obvious he had been asleep. I told him what happened. He told me there is a spare remote in work truck parked in drive way so I told him to stay on phone with me so I can go see if it's there. I looked all in the truck and remote is not there. I lock truck, go back inside, lock doors and set alarm. 

I believe someone found the remote, tested to see if it worked and am now super paranoid someone  is going to try to come  in but nothing happens for the next 3 days.  On the 4th night , I'm in bed with my 4lb yorkie watching Netflix on my phone and all lights are out. Around midnight I hear a sliding sound on the carpet at foot of bed. I paused the movie and sat there listening. My dog stood staring off the left side of the bed growling. ( he only  growls when  someone comes into my room, not any other time or place, and not aggressively- just to let me know someone's there). 

I had put my 8yr son in bed around 9:30p and it's not unusual for him to try to sneak into my bed when he can't sleep by crawling on the floor to keep my dog from alerting me. 

After a few seconds my dog moves to the right side of bed and continues growling towards the door and I hear foot steps. I turn the screen off, the glare made it so it took a minute for my eyes to adjust and thinking it was my son ,I thought I would get up and put him back in bed.  

I step out of my room and look inside my sons room and he is sound asleep. I step back out and glance towards the kitchen and my balcony door is wide open.  There are no stairs or exit on the balcony. I start turning on all lights. Shut and re locked the doors and checked every room. No one. So who or what was crawling around in my room and whose footsteps did I hear? 

Not sure what is going on but I lay in bed every night listening for any sound, double checking locks.

Should I be worried?

UPDATE: nothing has happened until last night. Kids are asleep and it's around midnight. Husband is away so just me and my 4lb wanna be alert dog in bed. All lights off and I'm trying to go to sleep. I hear a noise behind me by the door and turn over fast to look. My dog is also up and at foot of bed staring. I m listening but don't see or hear anything.

All of a sudden I start to feel drugged. I have a very low tolerance for alcohol /medication and hadn't taken anything. But the feeling I had is like when the world is swaying back and forth. I don't know if that makes sense.  I felt like the bed was gently swaying. I'm laying there so out of it almost passed out but I can feel something going back and forth in the house. This all lasted about 20 minutes and then the feeling went away and nothing else happened. Well, except now everywhere in the house I smell super glue. There isn't any but that is definitely what I'm smelling.

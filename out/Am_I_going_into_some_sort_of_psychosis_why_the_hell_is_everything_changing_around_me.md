I can’t explain it, but recently small things around me are changing. For example, I like to paint and I used up my entire bottle of pink paint on this huge painting I did. So today I opened my art kit and that bottle of paint was there.. and it was full. I could’ve sworn i threw it out? And I could’ve sworn it was empty? So I just thought that maybe I used a different bottle and I went about getting my art supplies set up and ready to paint. 

I have these reusable paint pallet sheets (sort of like a paper material) and I have a wooden board that I set the pallet sheets on, the paper fits perfectly onto the board, but today the paper didn’t fit the board, in fact it was way bigger then the board.. I then started thinking to myself that something was weird, but I just let it go because what else was I supposed to do about it? 

4:00pm rolled around fast, it was time for me to get to work. I swear when I paint time just flies. so I get ready for work, call my cab and grab a drink of water and a granola bar before leaving. As I go to leave I throw out the granola bar wrapper and headed my way out the door, but then I stop for a second and I take another look into the trash can because I wanted to double check if that paint bottle was in there.. and to my surprise it was, so I quickly run downstairs because I didn’t want to keep the cab driver waiting and I see that the paint bottle I found full earlier was suddenly gone and I look at my wooden board and see the piece of pallet paper that suddenly perfectly fits onto it as it normally would.. but it didn’t earlier? 

I think to myself.. what the hell is going on? am I going crazy? this may not seem like a big deal but it’s sorta odd right? I decided to tell myself that it was just some weird incident and maybe I was just tired and not thinking straight. 

So I head to work, I’m a cashier so I’m in a store. I’m just standing around doing nothing because it was a bit slow today, but then I see someone coming out of the corner of my eye so I look over thinking I had to cash someone out and then I see that no one was there, hmm I thought I saw someone? oh well obviously I didn’t. but then it happened again and again, and yet again. I kept seeing things out of the corner of my eye but the minute I looked over nothing was there. 

when I got home that night I kept thinking about it, but I went to bed early because obviously I didn’t sleep well enough last night.. why else is this all happening to me? I mean it’s unexplainable.. obviously I’m just tired. I should get to bed. 

(9:00am the next morning) ‘yawnnn’ it’s time to wake up.. I get out of bed to head to the washroom, I notice my tv is suddenly extremely close to the shelf, it wasn’t like that before was it? why am I just noticing how close it is, that’s weird.. I don’t understand I could’ve sworn the tv and the shelf had a bigger gap between it.. and why does my room suddenly feel smaller? UGH what is going on? why does everything feel so wrong recently. I turn on the tv to watch YouTube for a bit before I clean up the house, a random video plays after the one I had just put on and it seemed interesting so I just let it play. 

It’s almost like this video was a sign, a sign from something. The person in the video started talking about these empty soda bottles he left out and didn’t clean up.. it’s almost like I’m being spoken too, I mean how crazy is it that this random video came on mentioning empty bottles after my experience with the empty paint bottle! 
Maybe the tv being closer to the shelf influenced me to turn on the tv to see this exact moment, it all was leading to that guy mentioning his empty pop bottles.. but why? what is this a sign of why is this all happening, what are these shadow figures I’m seeing? It’s all a sign of something.. I know it, it’s all coming together into something. 

Am I in a different version of my life, maybe a different universe? I remember hearing a conspiracy about how theres a bunch of different universes with different versions of our lives, have I maybe switched to a different one? maybe that explains all the minor changes, oh my gosh that has to be it!! I’m in a different version of my life, but what if I want to switch back? how do I switch back? and wait what about those shadow people.. maybe it was just paranoia or the fact that I’m not in my normal reality.. 

the rest of the day nothing special really happened, I thought to myself that maybe because I realized I was in a different reality I switched back to my regular one.. oh well. Later in the day I see my boyfriend and he was acting different, maybe this is how he acts in this reality.. I thought I switched back to normal? maybe not. 

(4 months go by) GUYS! I have so much to explain, I have figured out what’s going on. I am switching between realities, I know this because some days people will act different then others and some days I will look into the mirror and see myself completely differently, I also act differently some days. I hate when I go into the reality where I’m super awkward and shy, but there’s a reality I go into where I’m outgoing and people really like me! so it sucks when I have to switch back to where people don’t like me as much. 

some part of me tells me this is crazy and not real, but I don’t listen to it. It’s very clear that everyday I’m not in the same reality. I mean what else explains it right? I’m not going crazy.. why would I be crazy? I simply just realized the truth and the empty paint bottle was my awakening. I feel so special, I wonder if anyone else realizes what’s going on.. does anyone else know they aren’t in the same reality everyday?

(1 year goes by) guys… I’m started to regret coming to this realization, I can’t look myself in the mirror some days.. I don’t feel like myself anymore, I don’t know what my true personality is, everyday is different.. I don’t think I’m switching realities.. I think something else is wrong but I don’t know what. every single morning I would wake up and wonder which reality I was in, one morning something switched in my head and I realized.. my tv was always that close to my shelf, the pallet paper that was “to big for the board” was never too big it’s always been the same size, and that paint bottle wasn’t the same one that was in the trash can, I just made myself believe it was.

PART ONE OVER: hey guys, I hope you enjoyed my short story on psychosis. I’m asking for critiques and I also want to know what you guys think of the story so far. many people struggle with psychosis and if you don’t understand the illness then this story is probably confusing to you.. but if you do understand it I hope you enjoyed and I will make a part 2 if people are interested in this!

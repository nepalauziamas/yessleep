“Bye” Emily yelled, waving after the school bus, waiting for it to go out of her sight before walking to her house down the street. Once she got there she walked into the house and right to her room, with her 2 fluffy cats following her. She shut and locked her door when her cats slowly walked in, nobody was home and a lot of weird things happen in her house when she's home alone.

She sat on her bed and immediately put her headphones in and turned on her music as she pulled out her computer. She wanted to get right on her homework so that she didn't have to do any later, it was already late in the evening because she had to stay after school for some math tutoring. 

Her computer shined bright in her face when she opened it and got right into her school account. She opened her English class first because she was doing the worst in that class. She opened her homework and got straight to writing. 

She had been working for a couple hours before she actually got all of her work done, it took a while but it was worth it. When she closed her computer and looked out the window, she saw something standing in the forest. A tall dark figure, she stared for a while because she thought it was her imagination before she realized it was really there. She  stood there in shock before slamming her window shut and closing the curtains. 

“Nothing. Is. There.” Emily told herself, curling up on the floor in fright. Shaking on the floor, she kept staring at the window. She didn’t know what to do after she saw that. She didn't wanna leave the room or anything. She kept herself locked in with her cats. 

She slowly stood up and walked to the window again, slowly opening the curtains in fright. When she looked, she realized the figure was gone. She sighed in relief, putting her head down and laughing. 

“I’m so childish.” She giggled. After, she heard a huge bang on the door, making her jump. It kept going.
“BANG! BANG! BANG!” Continuing over and over until the door handle started to shake. Then it stopped. Hearing the creek of her front door opening. Slowly, but it was opening. Then she heard footsteps, slowly coming towards her room. Step after step, Emily slowly crawled under her bed and hid. She didn't want anyone to know she was here. She knew it wasn't her parents because their car wasn't there. 

Then she saw a shadow under her door, there weren't any feet, just a shadow. A shadow bigger than anything she had seen. The door handle started turning slowly to the left. Then slowly to the right. Back and forth over and over. Until it stopped, and she heard a small knock, and then the door handle started turning again. 

Emily shut her eyes tight and held her breath. She was scared for her life, but it only got worse when the door slowly opened. She didn't know how, she knew she had locked her door. Then the shadow started walking towards her, but it was more like floating. 

“That’s all I remember.” She said to the mirror. “That's the last thing I saw.” Then she laughed and started slowly walking out the door. Trying to find her next victim….

The voice in my head was bad enough, but now the tattoo that the strange old man had given me on vacation was *moving*. It left a slick trail of saltwater as it slithered agonizingly across my chest, down my arm, and into the palm of my hand. 

I peeked through the bathroom door and breathed a sigh of relief when I saw that my wife was still asleep. Hopefully that would give me time to find a psychiatrist, a priest…or even just a sharp knife to *peel the damn thing off.* 

*"There is a man visiting this city. His name is Mori Ogawa. You are going to kill him."* I could hear Vakhtang's voice as clearly as if I were still on his boat on that cursed vacation so many years ago.

"What?!" I hissed. My wife stirred; I clamped a hand over my own mouth 

*"If Mori Ogawa is dead by the next full moon, your debt will be paid. If not…"*

Seawater filled my mouth, nose, ears–even my eyes. Through the stinging salt I could see the eyeless dead floating up from the murky depths, and ahead of all of them was the one I'd tried so hard to forget: Lena.

Lena, stripped naked by the tide. 

Lena, the skin I'd once caressed now pale and bloated.

Lena, her dead hand reaching up to drown me–

On my hands and knees, I vomited seawater across the floor of my suburban Chicago bathroom.

My wife rolled over in bed again; I forced myself to stay still until there was no sound apart from the dripping of last night’s dinner from my lips, I sopped up the mess I'd made with a few towels, dressed, and tiptoed downstairs to the kitchen with my heart thundering in my chest.

I tried to calm myself with my typical morning routine of making breakfast for my family, but before I knew it I was checking the calendar, searching for the date of the next full moon: just three days away. I poured my coffee with a shaking hand, afraid that at any moment Vakhtang's voice might boom inside my skull, commanding me to *get on with it!*

Opening the cutlery drawer for a butter knife, I wondered about the strange, tarot-like tattoo that now waited in my palm like an animal ready to strike. *Was that what was linking me to Vakhtang? Could I maybe…somehow…get rid of it?* 

I snatched up a butcher knife as quickly as possible and gritted my teeth, ready to cut away Vakhtang's hateful mark–

But my left hand had other plans. 

I didn't know any part of my body could move so fast. Before I knew it, my tattooed left hand had snagged a paring knife and suddenly…*I could feel it tickling my eyeball.* I realized with horror that my own hand was about to blind me. I wasn't in control anymore. 

"Daddy?" My three-year-old asked sleepily from the hallway, "what're you doing?" 

I was holding two knives, one pointing at my own face. 

It was a valid question.

"Just, uh," I gulped, "checking the sharpness of the knives…" 

When I released my grip on the butcher knife, my left hand lowered its own threatening blade…*slowly.* When both knives were back in their drawer, my left finger shook itself at me in a mocking, scolding gesture. 

At breakfast, I could only half-listen to our daughter’s table talk and my wife’s plans for our weekend. Inside my head, Vakhtang’s voice was bombarding me with information about my task: where I might find this *‘Mori Ogawa’* person, what weapon might be best for the task, the sort of security he would likely have…

Without warning, my left hand began drumming impatiently on the table. Vakhtang must’ve thought I was taking too long to finish my eggs and toast. I could see the concern in my wife’s eyes as I made an excuse, grabbed my coat, and headed out the door to work–

But when I reached the highway exit that led to my law office, my left hand wouldn’t let me move the wheel. It kept the car going straight ahead, toward downtown Chicago. A cold sweat formed on my forehead as I tried again, gently, to leave the highway…and was jerked back into my lane. I gave up and allowed my hand to steer me into the parking lot of a dingy hardware store. I followed my pointing finger down the aisles until it became a fist that commanded me to stop–right in front of the axes. When I felt the heft of the hatchet it grabbed, I realized that I was holding a future murder weapon.

No matter how hard I tried to drop it, my hand wouldn’t let go. 

“Please,” I whispered, “*please* don’t make me do this. I have a family…” 

As if in response, the now-familiar sting of saltwater burned my eyes, poured down my throat–

That awful feeling of drowning on dry land didn’t stop until I forced myself to take two big, drunken steps toward the exit. I thought of my daughters, my family, the career I’d built during all those years since that fateful vacation–

I thought of how I was about to be forced to kill a man, and throw it all away. 

Twenty minutes later I was parked outside of a five-star hotel, the hatchet concealed in a tissue-paper-stuffed gift bag that hung from my arm. My heart thundered in my chest as I wondered how on earth I was going to do this, let alone get away with it. My left hand jabbed its index finger angrily toward the hotel lobby. I took a deep breath and crossed the street. 

Vakhtang hadn’t told me anything about who Mori Ogawa was, or why he wanted him dead, but I’d been able to piece together a profile from the description he’d given me. Ogawa was a Japanese man, mid-forties, bald, possibly wearing thick black-framed glasses. He had a scar on the left side of his neck and an enormous tattoo of a red koi fish on his back–most likely completely covered by a gray suit. He always traveled with at least two armed bodyguards, strong fighting men who were similarly dressed in business attire. It didn’t take a lot of imagination to guess that Mori Ogawa was some sort of organized crime figure, or that pudgy suburban lawyer like me had virtually zero chance of successfully assassinating such a man. 

But it was either that…or return.

Return to the cold deep where eyeless figures drifted without even the grace of decomposition.

Return to where Lena waited with bloated grasping fingers. 

Jail was preferable. Death was preferable. 

But even *that* might not be an escape. 

I walked into the lobby and tried to smile like a man who didn’t have a hatchet in his gift bag. The bellhop on the phone behind the desk eyed me suspiciously; I picked up my pace toward the nearest elevator. 

The young, pimply bellhop hung up. He was about to say something to me, I was sure of it: he’d tell me to stop, step out from behind the desk, jog over with demands and questions, or try to stop me–

And my own left hand would cut him down where he stood.

The elevator behind me opened with a *ding.* 

A middle-aged couple shuffled out with their suitcases; I shuffled in. I’d assumed that Mori Ogawa’s room would be some sort of penthouse on the top floor, but I had no way of knowing exactly which room it would be. I had a bad feeling that if that bellhop saw me wandering around on camera too long, hotel security wouldn’t be far behind. Once I’d reached the top floor, I ducked into a restroom to buy some time.

There was a styrofoam cup half-full of ginger ale beside the sinks, and a pair of shiny black shoes beneath the second stall. I gulped.

Someone hummed, flushed, hitched up their pants and came out of the stall. A fit young Japanese man with shoulder length hair and a goatee looked me over and muscled past me, still humming. 

I was looking at one of Ogawa’s bodyguards.

As he walked out the door, my left hand shot into the gift bag. I clenched my teeth and, as I walked out the door behind him, I pulled it shut–trapping my murderous left arm  inside the bathroom. My tattooed hand pounded helplessly against the door and the wall with incredible force, but I took the beating and held firm. The bodyguard shot me an odd look; I grimaced back, then forced myself to roll my shoulders as though I were stretching. 

The goateed bodyguard snorted, then knocked on an ordinary white hotel room door: three fast, two slow, three fast. It was some sort of code. The door opened and the bodyguard slipped inside. Only after it slammed shut again could I relax. 

The moment I released my grip, my left hand shot out of the bathroom, slapped me across the face, and pressed me into the wall with its choking grip. 

*Ding.* 

Once again, I’d been saved by the elevator. Someone had ordered room service. My hand released me and I did my best to look natural as the pimply bellhop pushed a tray toward Ogawa’s room. The door opened for him–

*“Do not hesitate.”* Vakhtang’s voice hissed inside my head. I gulped–and swallowed a bit of seawater. 

I did *not* want to do this, but my left hand had other plans. It dug its fingers into the wallpaper, dragging me closer and closer to Ozawa’s room. The bellhop hadn’t noticed; he was buzzing at the plain white door.

Two bodyguards answered: the goateed one and another with a bald head and a sumo wrestler’s physique. The  goateed guard’s eyes narrowed when he saw me swaying crazily along the wall. 

“Eeh?!” He snarled, “You! Stop!” 

Before I could react they were both running at me, slamming me to the floor, screaming questions in my ear–

The bellhop could only watch, frozen with fear, as Mori Ogawa himself strode into the hallway. He moved like a man who could take his time. A nickel-plated pistol was in his hand.

“Who are you?” Ogawa asked, his voice laced with danger. “Why are you following me?” His two guards twisted my trapped arms until I wanted to scream with pain. “Do you even know–”

Ogawa didn’t see the bellhop approaching him from behind with an icepick in his hand. He probably didn’t even feel the sharp metal needle pierce through his eye socket and into his brain. Whoever Ogawa had been, whatever he’d done, he was now nothing more than a lifeless hunk of flesh on a hotel floor with an icepick jutting from a mutilated eye socket.

I could tell by the terror in his eyes that–like me–the bellhop had never killed anyone before. He stepped back, shaking, staring at something in the palm of his right hand:

A tattoo in the shape of a strange tarot card.

A tattoo almost identical to mine. 

*My God,* I wondered, *how many of us were there?* 

The guards were men accustomed to violence, but the sudden murder of their boss from such an unexpected source seemed to have surprised them as much as it had me. They loosened their grip on me to grab the pistols in their belts; it was enough. 

I scrambled away toward the fire escape as the deafening boom of gunshots filled the hallway. 

Sirens whined in the distance as I barreled down the fire stairs. Mori Ogawa was dead. I’d been nothing more than a distraction, a moving piece in a much larger puzzle. 

I was so focused on escape that it took me a full minute to realize I’d regained control of my own last hand. The tattoo had slithered back to the center of my chest.

Dormant–for the moment.

Waiting for Vakhtang’s next assignment.

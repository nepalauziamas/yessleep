 There’s no “best option” here. I have only awful pathways in front of me, and no matter what I choose, I’ll be a terrible person.

Last Monday was my son Dillon’s first day of kindergarten. Of course he was nervous to go – cancer took my wife three years ago, so he and I are all we have in the world. He hugged me tight as I dropped him off, and he hugged me tighter when I picked him up. I did my best to hide the fact that the separation was harder on me than it was on him.

“Mr. Slange?” his teacher called when I turned to walk away. “I need to speak with you.” Her hair was in a brown and gray bun over pearl earrings, and her horn-rimmed glasses seemed designed to find children who were acting up. She reminded me of my own kindergarten teacher. I followed her inside, not knowing what to expect. 

The hunting knife shocked me. Ms. Brann told me that Dillon had brought it with him from home. I had never seen it before, but Ms. Brann didn’t believe me. 

I took Dillon to school on Tuesday after trying to talk with him about the knife. He was completely embarrassed by the whole thing, so instead of coming down hard on him, I explained how it wasn’t a toy, and that we need to avoid things that hurt us, because I couldn’t bear to lose him. When I asked him where he got the knife, he would only tell me that the Crafty Man gave it to him.

He came home with three deep, ugly scratches on his back. The only thing he would tell me was that there were consequences to losing the knife. 

The knife reappeared on Wednesday. Ms. Brann once again called me into her room after school, sitting me down while Dillon played in the corner with an ancient set of Lincoln Logs. 

“I can show you this, but you can’t touch it,” she explained, producing the knife that I thought we’d tossed in the dumpster. My stomach dropped as I realized that the tip was stained with coagulated blood. “Dillon wouldn’t tell me where the blood came from. No one in class was injured, so I have no choice but to turn this into the police and see what they have to say.”

How do you talk to your kid about something so twisted? We all grow up thinking that our parents have more or less an understanding of how to function in society, but the reality is that some people are just better at faking it than others, and kids are easy to fool. 

I couldn’t get Dillon to tell me what was going on. 

Last Thursday, he came home without incident. I noticed that he was trying – and failing – to keep his backpack hidden while we were getting out of the car. I reached for it, he pulled back, and I won because kindergarteners aren’t very strong. My hands trembled as I opened it, as I was expecting a knife. 

There wasn’t a knife. Instead, I found two dead pigeons that looked like they’d been killed *with* a knife. 

Dillon wouldn’t tell me where he got the pigeons.

After getting home, I racked my brain in an attempt to find a way to reason with a kindergartener, drew a blank, and decided to freewheel the conversation. I was about to open the door to his room when I heard him speaking. 

“…I’ll do it, because you’re the Crafty Man. They took away my knives, so you’ll have to give me another.”

My stomach fell into my ice-cold nutsack. I didn’t want to open the door, but what option did I have? Placing a shaking hand against the wood, I gently opened it an inch.

Dillon was alone in the room, and he was still talking. He sat on his knees in front of the full-length mirror, chattering at his reflection.

“You’re the Crafty Man,” he grunted at the image before him as he rocked back and forth. 

He didn’t notice me at first.

Then, slowly, the reflection turned to face me. He opened his mouth in an obscenely wide, toothy grin. 

I closed the door.

I told myself that everything would be okay.

Everything is not okay.

On Friday, Ms. Brann didn’t call me into her room. I left faster than normal, telling myself that I wasn’t afraid of being reprimanded by the teacher for the third time in a week. “You don’t need to be scared,” Dillon explained. “We had a substitute today.”

I started to lie and explain that I wasn’t afraid of his teacher, but voicing the concern would be the same as admitting it, so I didn’t say anything at all. 

It was only after we were safely in the car that I noticed the odd expression on my son’s face.

“Dillon,” I began. “Is there something you need to show me?” 

He glanced at his fist before looking up at me, meeting my eyes for half a second, then staring at his shoes and shaking his head. 

Exasperated, I reached for his hand and pried his fingers apart.

Sitting in his palm was a severed human ear. 

We drove home in silence. I put the ear in the glove box, because the feel of lukewarm cartilage chills my spine like teeth scraping against concrete. Dillon went into his room and stayed there. He didn’t even mention the fact that I had removed his mirror. I geared myself up to talk with him, but what the fuck is the protocol for this shit?

I let three hours pass by without a plan. Eventually, I again decided to freewheel the conversation, because I had no idea what to do.

I don’t know why I checked my email before talking to him. I was probably trying to avoid what scared me. At any rate, the message changed everything.

Hello, South Hill family – I wish I was writing with better news on this first week of school, but I need to let you know about what’s happening in our District. Our kindergarten teacher, Eleanor Brann, was reported missing this afternoon. Her house was broken into last night, and from what SHPD has told us, it looks like foul play was involved.

I wish that I could be speaking directly with the children – but since this news is breaking on a Friday afternoon, I’d rather alert the parents ahead of time, since stories will likely spread over the weekend.

Please let your children know that no matter what happens, they are safe on campus. 

I promise that you’ll be the first to know when any I have any more relevant news.

Sincerely,

Marvin Pickett

Principal, South Hill Elementary School

I told myself that everything was fine.

I told myself that Dillon wasn’t involved.

I told myself that I hadn’t felt a pearl earring while shoving the severed ear into the glove box, where it still sat in my hot car.

I told myself a litany of lies that I don’t believe. 

And I’m telling myself right now that I can’t hear my son’s voice coming from his room, holding a one-sided dialogue about how human skin tastes *just* like chicken skin.

If I call the police, what will they do to him? What will he do to *me* if I don’t? Any advice is appreciated. I’ll respond when I can, but I have to go now. I hear his bedroom [door opening](https://www.facebook.com/P-F-McGrail-181784199029462/).

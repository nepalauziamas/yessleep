To start I need to give some background: 

- I am a male who lives in relatively nice neighborhood

- It’s your average small town run of the mill suburbs area with not a lot of people. 

- I am a college kid who’s home on break while my parents have gone away which doesn’t help at all. 

- I have a two story house

- I do not have gun nor do I have any real weapons other than kitchen knives

- I am not on any medication and I have no record of schizophrenia or any other mental illnesses

- I barely have any relationships with my neighbors most of whom are elderly and the rest I have minimal contact with

- I do not have any people in my neighborhood (that I know of) who have reasons to attack or harm me

Now, let's get into what has been happening. About two nights ago I woke up very late in the night and I went to the bathroom to go take a shit. Now, my second story bathroom has a window that can see the entirety of my backyard. Directly behind it is a cul de sac which you can see directly into. There is a group of trees and pile of rocks and mulch that divides it. Usually I can see everything in my backroom without turning on my because lights from my neighbor's house dimly lights the room. 

As I am using the toilet I look outside and I notice there is a car parked directly facing my house in the cul de sac. Now if you have ever seen a cul de sac before you would know that when you park you always either park next to the curves of the sac or the sides of the street. This car was directly facing the curve behind my house. I thought this was extremely strange considering whoever parked must have been there to visit someone, but if that were the case then why would they have not parked in one of the driveways? The people who lived behind me were both elderly so they probably didn’t have some big block party I didn’t know about, and even then only an idiot would park like that.

As I stared into the car I could distinguish a figure in the driver's seat, just sitting there. Since the lights were not on in my bathroom whoever was in the car probably couldn’t see me through that window. At this point I was determined to see just who the fuck was in there, so I went downstairs, got my binoculars from my dad’s closet, and went back to my bathroom to see who was there. 

Take in mind this is 3 in the fucking morning, what person would be in their car just sitting there in the middle of the winter? As I go into my bathroom, I look outside to find...nothing. The car had since left. I thought it was relief seeing as I probably was just freaking out over nothing and the person was just leaving whoever they were visiting, but then again, what are the odds that the moment I notice the car that's the moment that the person leaves?

I finally calmed myself down and went back to sleep. The next day a mix of boredom and paranoia got the better of me; I decided it was time for some investigation. I go to my backyard cul de sac to see if there was any trace of the person who was there last night. Nothing. I go to my neighbors to see if they had anybody over the other night; maybe it would clarify just why the fuck somebody would be parked there. I asked both the owners of the 2 houses on the curves the cul de sac, all of whom said they did not have visitors. I asked for their numbers and I left.

This is when my paranoia really started to kick in. This was fucked up, I had no clue whether the person was coming back later, and I can’t call the police as they won’t respond to a complaint that isn’t even valid. I decide to wait until later to see if the person came back. I spent that night talking with my college friends about it over video chat, all of whom thought I was either making it up, or freaking out over nothing. I sign off and watch netflix until it's pretty late. The entire time I just kept thinking about looking out my window to check, but since my friends had told me I was worrying about nothing and also since I am a bit of a coward I just never checked it. 

Finally the clock ticked 3:24 am, the exact time I woke up the night before. I thought fuck it, might as well check to be sure. This is where I absolutely shit myself, the same exact car was parked, and there was a man in a black hoodie and a ski mask standing right next to it just staring at my house. I immediately ran to go get my phone dialed my neighbors, none of which answered. I ran back to the window, only to see that he was standing in my fucking backyard. This was no longer a burglary attempt, because if it was he would be looking through my lower house windows trying to break in. This had to be some sort of a stalker. 

I decided fuck this and opened up my window and screamed at the top of my lungs “WHO THE FUCK ARE YOU?!”. No response. “I’M GOING TO CALL THE FUCKING POLICE GET THE FUCK OFF MY PROPERTY!” I yelled. Finally the man spoke “HAVE A NICE DAY!” in like that cheery way a cashier at the store would say when you are leaving. The man waltzed (and I literally mean waltzed like a happy cartoon character) back to his car and left.

I called the police department immediately. They asked me if I had any friends who were trying to play a prank on me, I said no. Like I said, this town was relatively small and the police did jack shit. They told me that if it happens again to call them immediately. I am shitting myself right now, it’s currently 11:00 pm, and god knows he’ll be back tonight. I am going to be looking out my window all night waiting for him. I’ll keep you all in touch if anything happens. Wish me luck.

Edit 12:24 am: I am currently staring outside looking out my window waiting for the man to come. I have informed my neighbors about his arrival and they have told me they are also on the look out. I feel extremely nervous but at least I have my neighbors helping me out. I just want this to be over.

Edit 1:24 am: Nothing has shown up yet. Got a call from my mom about a half hour ago. I haven't told them about any of the shit happening. I just told her I loved her and hung up the phone. My friends have been snap chatting me asking me about this shit. I said that I'll try to get a picture of him if I can. If I do I'll upload it so you guys can see.

Edit 1:34 am: Neighbors told me they see a car parked up the street from them. One of my neighbors who's in his mid 40's says he's going to check it out. My foot is tapping the floor like crazy right now.

Edit 1:37 am: False alarm. Turns out it was just the car of a family who just got home. Fuck me this suspense is making me sick.

Edit 1:48 am: One of my neighbors says he is going to sleep. This isn't good. I just hope the rest of them hold out for me until the rest of the night. I don't know if I'm going to fall asleep at all. I've already chugged two cups of coffee and I'm as alert as possible.

Edit 2:11 am: I was looking out my window when I heard something in the bushes of my backyard. I couldn't tell whether it was the the guy, the wind, or some animal so I shined turned on the light in my backyard and saw nothing. I think the paranoia is getting to me.

Edit 2:17 am: Alright it's official, I am losing my shit. I heard something crash in my kitchen and I ran down to see what was happening. Some pan had fallen over from the shelf. Nothing notable but it scared the absolute shit out of me. I went back upstairs to start looking out the window again, at one of the streets right of my backyard which is about 200 yards away, through the trees I saw a car at a corner flashing its brights repeatedly and then making a right driving away from the street leading to my house. What the fuck is going on?! Is this motherfucker taunting me? 

Edit 2:32 am: Alright. /u/joeenid1 has freaked me the fuck out. I'm out of here. I'm bringing my laptop and my wallet and phone with me and staying in my neighbors house. I'm not staying here another second after reading that man. Fuck that.

Edit 2:40 am: I am currently at my neighbor's house staring into my backyard/the cul de sac. I walked out my back door and sprinted and rang the door bell as fast as possible. They saw me and opened the door immediately. Scariest shit I have ever done I was worried he was gonna pull up any second. Now I just wait and hope for the best.

Edit 2:51 am: Nothing out of the ordinary has happened. I am dreading what will happen at 3:24 though. I saw 2 cars pass by my house. I couldn't tell if they were the same car as the one the stalker was using. At the same time I cant tell if its was the same car passing by both ways. This guy is playing tricks on my mind. I am ready to dial 911 at any second now. I called my parents and told them what is happening; they said they will be on their way home tomorrow. God please protect me.

Edit 3:01 am: This guy is definitely coming. A car came up the street on the cul de sac and started flashing it's high beams again and left. He is trying to fuck with my mind. Thank god I left the house, because the direction he is going he is definitely coming back around to my house. Fuck I'm scared and I'm not even in my house anymore. The moment i even see him outside his car I am calling the police. 

Edit 3:11 am: My neighbor and I both agreed we are going to leave the house and drive to the police station as soon as we see him park near my house. My heart is racing. I can't believe I had just waiting in my house alone for the past couple hours. What the fuck was I thinking.

Edit 3:20 am: Still nothing yet. Even if he doesn't come I sure as hell am not going back. I'm not even sure if I'll stay here. This is the scariest shit that has ever happened to me holy fuck.

Edit 3:25 am: SOMEONE HAS PARKED IN MY FUCKING DRIVEWAY!!!!!!! I am getting the fuck out of here. I'll try to update you guys on mobile or later when if they arrest this guy but I am leaving now. Thank you all for the support. And thanks /u/joeenid1 you may have saved my life.

Edit 1:15 pm 2/19/17- For those who are concerned I am alive. I went to the police station and I have been questioned and they are working on finding the guy. They haven't found him yet unfortunately. I went to a hotel and got some sleep and I just woke up. I'll write more about this in a new post but for right now I am just taking some time to get this sorted out. Thanks to everyone for their support.

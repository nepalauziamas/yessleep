The third hole sat even farther back in the yard, and was also guarded. I don’t know if the sentinels had always been there, or if they’d been summoned following my actions at the first hole—but there they stood, one each atop a strange, root-entwined cairn; their black eyes staring daggers at me as I approached. I hadn’t expected to actually “fight” any of the little things, I figured that, like the last one, any more I encountered would simply flee into their holes upon sighting me. But these two apparently had other plans; their swarthy, diminutive bodies stood ready for combat.  

They weren’t armed, but it was plain that they planned to confront me. I remembered the screams I’d heard when pouring the acid into the hole, and the weird, linguistically incomparable words of the creature who’d fled. Both had sounded eerily *human,* albeit pitched appropriately to their doll-like statures; shrill voices that had sounded wild yet somehow intoned with a semblance or derivation of humanity.  

I stopped my approach about ten feet from the cairns, and waited to see if the two creatures would attempt some form of communication. I figured that if I had to, I could un-cork the acid and splash a little in their direction. If it didn’t kill, it’d at least scare them away—ideally back into their holes, at which point I could just pour the rest of the stuff inside. But neither of the little demon-eyed things moved; their chest-embedded faces merely stared, grimacing evilly, unblinkingly. Knowing that I’d have to deal with them all if I wanted to collect my payment, I decided to take the initiative, and engage the little pests first.  

As smoothly as I could, I removed the lid, my eyes never leaving my small-framed foes. When the lid was off, I took a breath, and then as fast as I could manage, arced the container quickly in front of me, sending a stream of the strange, home-made acid toward the two cairn-perched creatures. One, perhaps not expecting me to actually fight in open ground, flinched upon seeing the liquid; and a moment later it was writhing on the ground; having fallen from its veritable guard tower upon being splashed with the acid. The other, faster than his companion, had leapt backwards just before being touched; and quickly rounded the cairn, crawling/galloping on all fours toward me.  

I was too appalled by the sight of the dying gnome to immediately react to the assault of its comrade. Before I could turn and sling out another splash, the gnome was upon me. Its little hands—three-fingered, I noticed for the first time—sank into my hand, and squeezed with a strength I wouldn’t have thought it capable. When I involuntarily fell to my knees, the gnome used its disproportionate strength to swat away the container of acid—sending it sliding across the grass. Then, with practiced swiftness, it delivered a crushing blow to my temple; and the last thing I saw was the acid steadily pouring out of the container onto the grass, and the subsequent plume of smoke as the caustic substance ate through the earth. As darkness enveloped me, a shrill tittering filled my ears—the high-pitched cackles of some fledgling imp newly loosed from hell to carry out its diabolic deeds.  

It’s hard for me to relate the events that followed, but I will—so that others may be warned.  

I awoke in a place I can only incompletely describe as dank, murky—incomprehensibly spacious, yet paradoxically suffocating. There was a source-less yet omnipresent wetness, as if the very walls were salivating, inexhaustibly, some kind of transparent slime. I was lying on my back, on a “bed” of soft black soil; though the environment around me was plainly rock, hardened sediment and what appeared to be long streaks of floor-buried bone, or some whitish deposit. As I mentioned, the space was huge, cavernous; I was granted a sense of its enormity by the ostensibly intentional placement of glowing, shell-like projections throughout; some affixed to the walls nearest to me, others twinkling off in the far-flung distance like stars, millions of miles away in the black gulf of outer space.  

It was psychologically oppressive, simply waking up and beholding the sheer grandeur of this subterranean domain. The impossibility of it hurt my head, made me feel woozy and nauseous when looked upon for more than a few moments at a time. I sat up, hoping that I wouldn’t lose consciousness from the sudden exertion. When my head settled a little and I could look around without much disorientation, I tried to spot some kind of natural tunnel or gnome-built passageway; any point of egress that could take back me to the mentally palatable surface—or at least to someplace less spatially irreconcilable.  

Finally, when my eyes had adjusted to the hazy, ever-shifting, sporadically lit murk, I spotted a small opening in a wall to my left, down a short declivity from my position. The space was about knee-high, but rounded; clearly having been carved by a tool of some kind, rather than the result of natural erosion in the rock wall. With a last, fearful glance at the inverted, star-scattered abyss above, I got on my hands and knees and, hoping against hope, crawled into the circular aperture.  

After what could’ve been seconds or minutes of dust-choked, claustrophobia-inducing crawling—my mind was still reeling from the unreality of my Tartarean plunge—I emerged into a space that was even more mystifying and sense-defying than the area from which I had come.  

I stood and dusted myself off, not for care of my clothing and cleanliness—my clothes had long since been soiled and tattered beyond repair—but simply to give the more refined parts of my mind something to focus on, lest they irretrievably recoil inward at the baffling architectural horror before me.  

Words such as “cavernous”, “vast”, and, “sprawling” are pitifully inadequate in describing this ultra-spatial, sub-terrene region. I had somehow gone from a huge yet at least abstractly fathomable cave to an inner world, a Chthonic realm within the bowels of the great Earth; a world which had, apparently, been peopled at some far-flung point in the past by builders of an architectural inclination both brilliant and horrific.  

The structures that towered before me or lay sunken and crumbled were stupefying in their enormity, and somehow revolting in their design: cryptic organizations of roughly edged, multifaceted buildings; Titan, exteriorly staired yet windowless spires that somehow managed to stand atop the thinnest pillars or platforms; conical and pyramidal bases that couldn’t have supported anything so hulking and weighty had they been built atop the surface, by human hands.  

And all of it, every leaning, crack-strewn surface, every impossibly upright edifice, every half-buried monument, was comprised of a faintly luminous stone; some ultra-resilient, dimly twinkling sediment, which couldn’t have come from anywhere but such a terrestrially distant environment as the centermost portions of the Earth, if not from some wholly separate sphere far beyond it... 

I stood atop what could have been a cliff, at some point far in the distant past, or perhaps simply the feature-effaced roof of a building that had sunken indistinguishably into a natural wall, becoming a single, aeonian structure. Despite my aforementioned revulsion at the bizarre, megalith-ridden acropolis, I felt that I had to push on; that if there were any pathways to the surface—an idea which seemed almost comically absurd, given the preternatural, sky-like darkness that hung above this time-forsaken city—they’d lie somewhere amidst the ancient dissolution and dereliction before me. 

Stumbling—I couldn’t have told you the last time I’d eaten or drank anything—I thoughtlessly carried my body down the cliff, traversing as best I could on the ever-crumbling, dust-capped steps. Eventually, I reached a somewhat level surface, and judged that I had arrived at what would’ve been a street, centuries—if not longer—ago. Standing level with it all, I cowered a little before the colossal towers; shrunk away from the immemorial agedness apparent on every surface; peered, with a vague, unrelatable unease, at the thick, fulsome shadows; which seemed to, somehow, lengthen or shorten of their own volition, despite the photic stagnancy of the luminous ore... 

With a terror-weakened mind and exhaustion-stricken body, I lurched and ambled through that long-dead city, intermittently marveling and gasping in awe and horror whenever some singular and incredible wonder revealed itself to me as I rounded corners or clambered over collapsed, unnamable things. The instinctively recognizable effluvia of communal death and widespread corruption filled my nostrils, and my mind—in a state of advanced mental debility—conjured and projected phantoms and ghouls in the depths of shadows; but I saw no actual signs of life—nor any evidence that it had ever existed within the sub-mundane city. It was as if those looming palatial structures had been built by immaterial entities, who, upon finishing their construction, simply vanished; leaving shadows to tenant the vacancies.  

The long-deserted and sunless city was naturally windless, lacking anything in the way of a microcosmic atmosphere, and yet a chill arose and deepened not long into my trek through its winding alleys and intermittently slanting boulevards; as if I traveled through varying climes and biomes, despite the seamless transition from block to ancient block.  

Someday, when the still-lingering fog of horror has receded a little from my mind, I hope to recall and transcribe the finer details of my memories from that unreal voyage, but for now I can only say that this city, built well beneath the crust of Earth, was amazing, geologically perplexing—and nightmarish beyond tolerance.  

Somehow, after a span a time I won’t even try to estimate, I arrived at the opposite side of that corpse-less necropolis. I was inexpressibly tired, had pushed my body and mind to degrees of exertion unprecedented for myself and perhaps any other man of my general lifestyle. Peering around, I saw only more of the grander cave’s interior; shockingly, illogically vast, almost void-like; and I wondered how any civilization could’ve thrived or even existed for more than a little while under such abyssal and gloomy conditions.  

Shuffling onward—more-so through a robotic automation than any conscious impulse—I reached a broad, far-climbing staircase, roughly hewn and broken in many places; not unlike the one by which I had descended into the age-warped city. Standing atop the faraway pinnacle was a figure, and my mind, addled as it was by the extremity of my exhaustion, didn’t immediately recognize it. Hastening on, thinking that perhaps someone had dared the hypogeal perils to rescue me, I practically crawled on hands and knees up the stairs; heedless of the scrapes and bruises acquired. 

It was only when I had gone halfway up that I recognized the figure for what it really was; and by then it was too late to retreat. I’d exerted all my effort in my ascent, and knew that what remained of my strength would be needed just to cling to the ruinous, perilously inclined steps. 

Standing there, its beady, hateful eyes looking down into my own, was the creature—the horrific gnome—I had tried to kill back on the surface.  

For a moment, there was only silence. I knew that if this thing wanted to, it could kill me; it’s comparatively smaller size at that point was irrelevant. I was simply too tired, had been sapped of so much strength, that even the feeblest blow would’ve sent me falling backwards down that warped staircase.  

Yet despite the hatred I sensed in its chest-set face, the thing did not make a move to shove me back; nor did it show any intimation that it intended me harm. Its body language, what I could discern of it, seemed...anticipatory, more than anything. As if it were waiting on me to act, or to at least attempt communication.  

At that point, I was tired enough to go along with anything, even the pre-execution formalities or whimsy of a freakishly small horror—so I said, with a throat that was as dry as the dead world behind me, “What do you want?”  

The thing chirped, and croaked, and tittered, a series of wholly unfamiliar and incognizable sounds issuing from the lipless mouth on its chest-mounted face. As I’m sure anyone who has ever been extremely tired and forced to carry out some seemingly useless dialogue can attest to, a frustration mounted within me. I couldn’t understand the thing, and was certain that its mere proximity to the great city meant that it possessed some level of intelligence, and therefore had to know that I wouldn’t understand its monstrous language. Its ignorance to this, or unwillingness to accept this, angered me; and this anger galvanized my weak body. I rose to stand and stomped up toward the thing, fists balled and brow furrowed. In response, the little monster shuffled backwards on the summit, giving me space to stand. 

But it did not run away, had only retreated enough to allow me to stand comfortably away from the precipitous edge. I found myself further angered by its lack of fear in the face of a much larger foe; even though I was plainly exhausted, and hadn’t had anything in the way of rest or sustenance in hours. Still, I thought in a less articulate way, such things shouldn’t have mattered; it should still be scared of me—a giant by comparison.  

But before I could muster the strength to lash out—verbally or physically—the gnome raised one of its stubby hands and gestured behind me. I followed its open palm to the grey-draped cityscape, and then watched as it approached the edge of the cliff—its attention focused on the darkness-piercing spires. For a brief moment, I considered lashing out with my foot and kicking the thing off the edge; even imagined how its tinny voice would sounding echoing infinitely into the skyward void as it plunged to the ground below. But something about its posture, the suggestion of reverence in its squat, swarthy body, stayed my foot. And I instead approached the edge to stand abreast with it.  

We stood there alongside one another for a few moments, gazing silently on that dark, unpeopled city. until the gnome finally turned to me, with an expression of unmistakable melancholy on its tragically inhuman face. And despite our obvious differences in morphology and physiognomy, I recognized, without a shred of doubt, the pain in those ebon eyes—the long-held grief that had, for countless solitary cycles, weighed heavily upon its heart.   

Trusting me not to attack it—or perhaps no longer caring for its safety in my presence—it turned its back to me and began digging in the ashen ground of the cliff summit. While it worked, I turned my gaze again to that darkly palatial kingdom, with its marmoreal surfaces, shadow-warded porticoes, and lifeless, broadly laid street, and wondered at what kind of race could’ve inhabited such a huge, humanly inconceivable environment.  

Finally, it chirped, and I went over to see what it had unearthed in the rock. But I saw that it hadn’t been digging, but *etching* something into the ground; inscribing upon the rock itself a long series of images and symbols, none of which I recognized, but were nonetheless visually alluring, mentally stimulating.  

Like the hieroglyphs upon some ancient Egyptian mural, the images carved into the ground showed a sequence of events, told a story of some kind. The gnome, its face still contorted by its implacable grief, stood aside to allow me a full view of the imagery. My eyes followed the chronology (presuming that it flowed from left to right) and I quickly realized with a sympathetic disquietude that I was looking at a representation of the city’s downfall. And then, the ultimate truth of it all, the breath-catching reality of my unreal situation, finally dawned on me.  

In some former time, well before God or the proto-morphic slimes had reared man upon the Earth, there existed a race of highly intelligent subterranean beings; who had dwelt and flourished for untold epochs within the smoldering interior of the nascent Earth. These beings, according to the hastily inscribed hieroglyphs, built the great city before me, and had, for a short while, peopled it; but then something, some cataclysm or annihilating event had swept through and eradicated nearly the entirety of the primoradial race. The gnome had drawn figures locked in the throes of agony, some individually, others entangled with each other; and entire crowds of the ancient people were depicted in great heaps and hordes of congregate violence—clashing and grappling insensibly, savagely, as if the entire civilization had turned upon itself in wild civic unrest.  

And so much time had passed since this seemingly self-inflicted annihilation that not even the ashes of their bones remained amidst the empty streets and buildings. But that wasn’t all that was related through the crude imagery and suggestive symbols. They also told of a subsequent happening, a contagion or malady of some kind, that afflicted the few remaining members of that ill-fortuned race. This disease had caused them to shrink, to literally collapse upon themselves until there were naught but twisted, rudimentary versions of their former selves. Diminutive, spite-filled homunculi..*.gnomes.* The stony pictograph ended with a small collection of surviving gnomes, a handful of vanguards left to watch over a city that no longer—and would never again—need their protection.  

Deeply troubled, and now sharing more than a little of the impish creature’s melancholy, I turned away from the carving and addressed its forlorn artist: “You’re one of the last, aren’t you? A historian or protector of all this? But why have you come to the surface? I can understand if you’d like to leave—to escape this gloomy place. But why do so in such mischievous, pestilential ways? I was hired to exterminate you, because you’ve been causing havoc for those on the surface.”  

I didn’t actually expect my words to have any meaning to the creature, I was merely voicing the confusion at the whole thing that had emerged in my mind following the retelling of its race’s fate. But to my surprise, the little being formed its hands into a circle, and raised its arms high above its head, situating the hand-formed shape above the looming buildings, where it had been sullenly gazing earlier. For a moment, I stared, not comprehending the meaning. But then, when taking in the dismal environ and the stagnant deadness of it all, I finally understood its meaning: the circle it had formed with its hands was the sun, positioned above the ever-shaded city. Of course! The sun, something that was undoubtedly as marvelous and too-incredible to it as its city was to me; the gnome was drawn to it, probably mesmerized by it.  

Its somewhat barbarous and invasive actions on the surface had no doubt been partially caused by some kind of solar delirium, a sun-induced mania. It was understandable; this thing that had only known the dim, mortuary illumination of an underground metropolis. I sighed, my exhaustion returning to me in full force, and I sat down beside the gnome. It turned to me, its eyes pleading some request I thought that I understood, and then walked over toward the rear of the summit, which sat against a greater rock face. There, it pressed against a portion of the wall, and a great portion, imperceptibly outlined, then slid inward and revolved—leaving in its wake a dark tunnel. Turning, the gnome then beckoned me to rise and follow, and I did—joining it in that dark passageway like an undead thrall obeying a necromantic summons.  

After an interim of alternately crawling and hiking that was both inestimable and silent, we emerged onto the surface, and I thought for a moment that the gnome had instead led to me to the molten furnace of the Earth’s core. I must’ve gone without the sun’s natural brilliance and warmth for longer than I’d thought, because the totality of its light was blinding, terrifying; and I nearly even fled back into the cold darkness of the sloping tunnel. But the fresh air, the scent of nearby flowers and growths of a natural, livelier order anchored me; and my eyes quickly adjusted to the beauteous light and invigorating radiance of that life-giving star.  

Saying nothing, the gnome strode away, and I dazedly watched as he collected what remained of his fallen comrades. Gathering ash and bone, he dumped the collected artifacts into the holes nearest them, and then sealed the openings with dirt. Once its sepulchral tasks had been completed it sang—in its tinny, abhorrent voice—some mournful dirge. I stood and listened with as much solemnity as I could manage, given my glee at finally being back on the surface. 

He then returned to me, and let out a few chirps—their import obvious, given the circumstances. I nodded, and wished him well in his life aboveground. He took one last look into the hole from which we had come, and then piled dirt into the opening, which was quickly packed in due to the abrupt curvature of the tunnel. After that, he walked off toward the far end of the yard, and shortly disappeared into the unclaimed woodland beyond.  

I spent a few more moments basking in the sunlight, allowing it to somewhat rejuvenate my wearied form. Then, with a mind resolved on collecting payment for a job done, I marched toward the Connor’s house to announce that I had gotten rid of the “vermin”.

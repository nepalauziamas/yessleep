In writing [my last post,](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/xr4ohx/when_i_was_a_kid_i_found_an_oven_in_the_woods/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) I’d hoped to find answers regarding what the oven was, and why it…did what it did. While I’m not much closer to figuring anything out, I think sharing the story was helpful in jogging my memory, which I’m grateful for. As I mentioned, I really can’t remember much, and I haven’t even *thought* about Jackson in close to two decades. So it’s been nice to relive those days a little.

It raises more questions, though. Because how could I just forget my best friend like that? Why did it take a flashback to some oven-related trauma for me to remember the woods, and Home Base, and making plastic dinosaurs fight G.I. Joes? It was a pretty significant portion of my life, after all. And Jackson was a pretty significant person.

I don’t know. I’m going to try reaching out to him; maybe he can corroborate some things. I have no idea where he is now, though, so it could take a while to track him down. (I don’t want to give out his last name online, but if anyone has any information that could be useful, please let me know. It would be nice to catch up.)

Anyway, onto the real reason I’m posting this. While I was reminiscing, pushing through the migraines in the hopes of unlocking more childhood memories, I remembered something else about the oven. And it makes even less sense, because I distinctly remember how afraid we were. How Jackson and I ran as fast as we could, tearing through the woods like bats out of hell and getting home covered in mud and bloody scrapes—how I couldn’t stop shaking for hours afterwards—how I didn’t sleep a wink that night, because the *thud-thud-thud* of my heartbeat sounded too much like that bird throwing itself against the oven door.

We were *terrified.* So it doesn’t make sense that we’d use the oven again.

But we did.

We did, and I wish we hadn’t.

&#x200B;

We didn’t play in the forest for a few days after the incident. We still hung out in each other’s backyards, rode our bikes around the neighborhood, that sort of thing—we just didn’t go back into the woods.

I don’t think we ever talked about it, either. It’s not like we officially sat down and made a pact to pretend like it never happened; we just came to a silent understanding, the way kids often do. Whatever happened in the woods that day was wrong. I guess we felt like dwelling on it was wrong, too.

And it was fine, because it was summertime, which meant there was no shortage of distractions. We flew kites. We caught fireflies. We ate ice cream and we watched Saturday morning cartoons and we swam in the local pool. And if a thread of tension hung over us like brittle glass, well, we could just ignore it.

But then we found a dead possum. And we couldn’t just ignore it anymore.

We’d been riding our bikes when we found it. It was lying by the main road, so odds are, it was hit by a car. And we knew it wasn’t playing dead because of the flies.

At first, we just did the usual thing where you poke roadkill with a stick. Most times, we’d act like detectives, trying to ascertain the cause of death and pretending we were smarter than we actually were. But this time, we didn’t. We just crouched there quietly on the side of the road. It was like we were both holding our breaths, waiting for the other person to say something.

Finally, I said, “Do you think it would work?”

Jackson met my eyes for a moment. Then he went back to studiously examining the possum.

“Would what work?” he asked.

“You know what,” I said, and I was a little frustrated, because I knew he was trying to get me to say it, and I didn’t want to admit that I was scared to.

Jackson shrugged. He put down the stick he was using to poke it, though.

We just sat there for a while.

Jackson was the one to break the silence.

“Should we try it?”

And that’s how we found ourselves hiking back into the woods with a dead possum wrapped in an old beach towel.

The deeper we got into the Swamp, the more nervous I got. My hands were sweating, and I kept missing my footing. But a part of me was also excited. The bird…it could’ve been a mistake. I knew deep down that it wasn’t, but there was still a tiny chance that there was a logical explanation. That the oven wasn’t special at all. And once we put the possum in, we’d know for sure.

I honestly don’t know which outcome I was hoping for. I think a part of me wanted nothing to happen. Then the world would make sense again, and the uneasy twist in my gut would go away.

But the other part of me wanted it to work. Because I wanted magic to be real. And doesn’t every kid? Didn’t we all make stuff up and pretend to believe it—things like Santa Claus, the Tooth Fairy, dragons and ghosts—just so the world would seem a little more miraculous? Didn’t we all want to be special? Didn’t we all wish for an adventure?

I did. And Jackson did, too.

We were kids. What we did was stupid, but...we were just kids.

We reached the clearing and sloshed through the water. I grabbed the oven’s handle, turning to Jackson before opening it.

“Don’t freak out,” I warned, and he nodded.

This time, when the oven creaked open and the forest went eerily still, we were both ready for it. Yeah, we were still unsettled, but we didn’t flinch. Instead, Jackson stepped forward with the possum bundled in his arms. He set it carefully on the oven’s center rack. Then, he backed up so he was standing beside me, both of us as far to the side as we could get.

I slammed the oven shut with a *clang.*

It took less than a minute for the noises to start.

Awful, scrabbling noises. Whatever was inside scratched at the door, making strange hissing sounds all the while. Jackson and I turned to each other, eyes alight with fear and excitement.

“Ready?” I mouthed, and once again, Jackson nodded. “On three. One…two…”

Just before I could swing it open, there was a sudden *THUNK.* Both of us screamed as something slammed itself against the door. The oven was so old and dirty that I couldn’t actually see inside, but I could barely make out a small, dark stain on the glass where there hadn’t been one before.

Another *THUNK,* and we jumped back. We looked at each other, exchanging worried expressions and frantic gestures back and forth. *THUNK.* The dark splotch on the glass was bigger, now. It was going to bash itself to pieces if we didn’t let it out. My grip tightened on the handle.

“No!” Jackson whispered, shaking his head desperately. “Don’t!”

And I didn’t want to. I really didn’t.

But it just didn’t seem right—saving it, only to leave it trapped in there.

So I took a deep breath and yanked the door open.

Immediately, something shot out. It was so fast that I only managed to catch a quick glimpse of it before it tore through the water and disappeared into the foliage. But from what I *did* see, its head looked wrong—like it wasn't the right shape—and it was covered in blood.

Gradually, its horrible, gurgling hisses faded farther and farther away. It was still a long time before Jackson or I moved; both of us worried that at any minute, the thing would pop out of the bushes.

It didn’t, though.

So I grabbed the beach towel out of the oven—it was torn to pieces and stained red—and I closed the door.  All at once, the forest came alive again. We just stood there for a while, shin-deep in the muck, listening to the birds and the rustling leaves.

“It worked,” I said weakly.

Jackson stared down at the ruined towel and swallowed.

“Yeah,” he said quietly. “How, though?”

I shrugged.

We headed out of the Swamp, leaving the oven behind. We hid the towel at Home Base, because we didn’t want Jackson’s mom to find out about it. If I recall correctly, we spent the rest of the day swinging on the rope swings and discussing different theories about the oven. Was it magic? Alien? Some crazy science experiment?

“Well,” Jackson called as his swing swooshed past mine, “whatever it is, it’s *crazy.* Can it make anything alive, do you think? Or just fix stuff that’s already dead?”

“I dunno,” I shouted back. I kicked my feet out as I flew over the creek, feeling like I was flying. The wind tossed my hair all around my face, the sun shone brightly through the leaves overhead, and we’d just made the greatest discovery of our young lives.

But I couldn’t help but wonder whether we’d really fixed the possum at all.

&#x200B;

We experimented quite a bit over the next few days. We put some flowers and pinecones in the oven; nothing happened. We tried putting one of Jackson’s G.I. Joes inside, and then my Polly Pocket; unfortunately, neither of them came to life. I brought down a baby alligator head that I’d gotten as a souvenir when my family went to Florida; it stayed exactly the same. (Honestly, I was a little relieved about that one—I liked where I had it on my bookshelf, and I wasn’t sure how I’d explain it to my mom if it suddenly started snapping.)

We only tried to put something live in the oven once. Jackson caught a toad, and wanted to see what would happen. So we marched down to the clearing—which was getting easier, because our frequent visits had carved a small path at that point—and I opened the oven. The woods went all spooky and quiet, as usual.

But what was strange was that the toad in Jackson’s hands stopped squirming and went completely still, too. We looked at the toad, then at each other. We shrugged, and then Jackson went to put the toad inside.

Immediately, the toad went *crazy.* It was thrashing and croaking and wriggling around like I’d never seen. It startled Jackson so much that he yelped, fumbling with it, and before he could get it in the oven, the toad managed to slip out of his hands and disappear beneath the water.

I laughed at Jackson, and he grumbled. Then we went back to whatever we’d been doing earlier.

We didn’t tell anyone about the oven. This time, we *did* make a pact; it was our secret, and unless we were sure no one else was around, we wouldn’t even whisper about it. It was *ours,* and we didn’t want to risk anybody finding out about it and taking it away.

“Like the government,” Jackson said.

I frowned. “What would the government want with an oven?”

“It’s an oven that *brings things back to life!* The government could totally use that!”

“For what?”

Jackson paused. “I don’t know,” he finally admitted. “For if the president died, maybe?”

I snorted. “The president wouldn’t fit in there.”

“He *could,”* Jackson protested. “If he was really short. Like a midget. And anyway, they might just take the oven to do experiments on it.”

I’d seen *E.T.*, so I reluctantly agreed that maybe he was right. But it didn’t actually make much of a difference; I wasn’t planning on telling anybody about the oven, anyway, because I didn't have anybody to tell. Jackson was the only person I really talked to. He was my best friend—the only friend I needed. And even if there *had* been somebody else, I would never betray him like that. I had his back, just like I knew he had mine.

I guess I thought that it would always be that way.

I thought wrong.

&#x200B;

At the time, I didn’t understand why Jackson stopped talking to me. Why he all of a sudden ditched me, and started hanging out with Robbie instead. It felt so out-of-the-blue, and whenever I tried to confront him about it, he’d either ignore me, or pretend he didn’t know what I was talking about. It hurt, losing my best friend like that; not knowing *why* hurt even more.

By the end of that summer, Jackson’s family had moved away. I never found out why things changed between us the way that they did.

But now, as I look back, I think it might have had something to do with the raccoon.

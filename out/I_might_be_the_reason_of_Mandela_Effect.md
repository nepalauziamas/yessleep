I think I might be the main factor directly leading to the formation of the so-called "Mandela Effect" and indirectly leading to its controversial impacts on the world.

You can either take this seriously or just as a joke, because if you believe this, I could be accused of messing with the spactime continuum. Well, since I was born and raised as a Vietnamese, my English is quite basic to comprehend. To start this thread, I'd like to mention the TikTok clips that are recently posted as theories around the "Mandela Effect" and whether this world is a simulation. Some of the TikTokers mentioned 2012 as an example of a change in timeline that may have been situated after the true "the end of the day" predicted by the Mayans. Then I realised, my whole life has been a series of "Mandela Effect" consquences, and I think they might come from my desires.

Some time in my life I just ran into a random "false memory" that I couldn't explain. Since I was the only one remember it that way, I eventually ended up thinking that my memories could be affected by dreams, movies, and fantasies that I made up as a child. But then it happened more often, with so little change that when I regconised the changes, it somehow became a new timeline. At first, I thought I was a sci-fi psychopath, but then many people around the world started to talk about this so-called "Mandela Effect", and I knew that I was not the only one. 

But then I read about psychic abilities, especially realities manupulation. I know that as kids, we all thought that the world was always rotating around. But my case was different, my wishes were fulfilled right away so often that I had been labeled "the Lost Son of the God of Luck" ("Con Rơi của Thần May Mắn" for Vietnamese viewers and translators). And I realised these fulfilled wishes came with a little price that is quite hard to see in a nick of time, a small change with a small amount of people in parts of the world. Therefore, the "false memories" differing among people around the world became the definition of the "Mandela Effect". Some devices may still be able to record these changes as they follow whoever they belong to to the new timeline. And the existence parallel timelines resulted as "déjà vu" phenomena, whice are simply possibilities about to happen in the multiverse that one person is able to conceive. The spiritual world does exist and I am able to interact with it as this world co-existence in the same spacetime continuum with our world but in a different state of matter. Mythical creatures are real because legends are supposed to be stories told by the ancient, not fictional tales to put children to sleep, and they are just blending in our societies to adapt with the modern world. For instance, the lady master of a maid café that I acquainted to is actually an Elf, and one of my neighbour kid lookalike is actually a Dwalf. Kaijus are real, too, and they are hiding in the rocks. 

I am sorry that these sufferings might have changed your ways of living, even unconsciously. But I could not control it and I myself was also affected. One of the biggest "Mandela Effect" impacts on my life was the existence of one of the colleagues of my father. My father was so close with this father of three girls that I spent my childhood with his three daughters. But then somewhat in my thoughts, I childishly wished for the fewer number of daughters that my father's colleague had. Three years after his death of lung cancer, I shivered seeing him being back to alive healthily, but this time, with his "only daughter" who was just back from the overseas study in France and remarkably older than the "original" three. It was even scarier when I remembered having wished to see him again in his funeral. Ever since then I acknowledged the danger of this curse.

I am so sorry for the messed-ups!

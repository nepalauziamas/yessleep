 “Go on in there,” the duty sergeant sneered. “Let’s see what you learned in *college.*” 

I was twenty years younger than the youngest guy in the department, and it showed. Even so, the way the duty sergeant threw me at the strangest and most dangerous cases had long since crossed the line from harassment and turned into something more menacing. I realized the rest of them *wanted* me to fail; they didn’t like guys like me. Young guys. Guys who asked questions, who did things by the book. It cramped their style. They wanted their Old Boys club back–even if that meant me getting my throat torn out. They’d all seen–and probably done–worse. I could see it in their eyes. 

Still, there didn’t seem to be anything particularly threatening about the short, auburn-haired girl in the interrogation room. She was probably about half my weight; her thick black glasses and pale skin made me think of a young librarian. 

But I knew better. I’d seen the photos. I knew what she was capable of. 

“Hi, Katie. I’m Detective Maxwell.” My eyes didn’t leave her for a minute as I sat down–well out of reach. 

“Detective, huh?” Katie laughed nervously. “Why detective? I already explained everything to the man at the hospital…”

“That man was a psychiatrist, Katie. I’m a police officer. Because your friends are…deceased…it’s important to establish exactly what happened between April 24th and May 10th on the *Eudaimonia.* Can you explain those events to me as you remember them, Katie?”

“Deceased…?” There was surprise in her wide green eyes. *Could it be that she really didn’t know?* “Dead. Of course they are.” Katie buried her head in her arms. “Things like this have followed me my whole life, ya know?” she wept. 

At the time, I didn’t pay much attention to her comment.

“Stay with me, Katie.” I commanded. “I know this must be difficult for you, but the only way forward is for you to tell me exactly what happened on April 24th.” 

“Nick, Simone, Terry, Hu, and me. We met in a Classics class. In college. The professor was a real dick. He’d write on the board with one hand and erase with the other–and he’d fail you if you used a bibliography format he didn’t like.” Katie snorted. “Anyway the five of us bonded and were friends ever since. We always thought it would be cool to take a trip to the Greek Islands–see the place where all that ancient stuff happened, y’know? This year we finally got our chance.”

Katie took a deep breath. She kept glancing at the manila folder on the table. I wasn’t ready to show her the pictures. Not yet. First I had to hear as much of her story as I could, establish a rapport. And then–then it would be time for the *real* questions.

“It was Terry who had the idea of renting a sailboat.” 

“I understand Terry Blankenship had some sailing experience.” I offered.

“Pfft.” Katie snorted through her tears. “Yeah right. *Twice*. With his *uncle*. on a *fishing boat*. But the boat we rented had, like, four cabins and two sails–It was way out of his league.”

“When you say *‘the boat’* you are referring to the ‘*Eudaimonia,’* correct?” I pushed. Katie nodded. “There’s been some suggestion that Terry rented the boat from a small local outfit because he knew that he didn’t have the license or experience a more reputable firm would have demanded. What do *you* think about that, Katie?”

“He just wanted to impress Simone.” Katie shrugged. “The water looked so calm…we didn’t think anything bad would happen. Nikolas, the guy at the marina…he saw Terry’s credit card and knew right away he was loaded. Once he saw it, I don’t think he cared if we came back with the boat or not.” 

“It *was* an unusually long time before the authorities were alerted.” I admitted. “But let’s not get out of order. You were telling me about your first day at sea.” 

“It was beautiful!” Katie brightened. “You’ve never seen anything so blue. Little white houses, tiny islands off in the distance…*getting tan on the deck with a guy I had a crush on since Sophomore year*…it was like a dream. Until the storm blew up.” 

“When was that?”

“That was the second day, so…April 25th. We’d just finished the dinner Hu cooked in the galley, and we were getting a card game set up below deck without too much enthusiasm…we were all pretty plastered from another long day of drinking in the sun. That’s probably why we didn’t notice that the water had started to move…differently. By the time we realized, the rain was coming so hard and fast we couldn’t see. Nobody knew how to prepare the boat, and Terry…he couldn’t even take in the sail…”

“It’s alright.” I reassured her, leaning farther forward than I probably should have. “I know this is hard. What happened next?” 

“We *capsized!* That’s *what!*” Katie practically shrieked, and I jumped. “I just remember holding on for dear life while these huge, frothy black waves slammed against the boat again and again…Nick and Hu were yelling something…Terry got desperate. He cut the sail free. Then a wave righted us again…and on it went...” Katie sniffed. “We huddled in the wet interior, waiting to get flipped again, praying for dawn…”

“When it finally came, there was nothing but water all around. All our supplies were gone. The GPS, the safety devices and backups…they were all missing or broken. I’ve never felt so helpless.” 

“A person can get pretty desperate in a situation like that.” I hinted.

“We handled it pretty well for the first day. We tried to make signals, fix the equipment–even fish!” there was that vague smile again, the one that darkened so quickly. “Everything gets blurry after that.” Katie mumbled. “Maybe it was the hunger or thirst, but…I can’t. Sorry.” 

“What I’m trying to figure out here, Katie…” I cleared my throat “...is how you managed to survive fourteen days adrift in a boat without food or water. I need you to remember what happened to the others, Katie.” 

“The others…” she wrinkled her forehead doubtfully. I took the first picture out of the manilla folder. It showed the walls of a ship’s cabin, gouged deep with fingernail marks, and a door ripped brutally from its hinges. 

“For example, how did this happen?” I insisted. Katie shrugged. 

I produced another photo. Another cabin, the bedding shredded, the walls splattered with blood. 

“That’s our ship…” Katie seemed to recognize it for the first time. I’d saved the most disturbing for last: the gnawed-upon bones of Terry, Simone, Hu, and Nick, scattered around the galley. Katie brought a hand to her mouth.

“When the medics found you and pumped your stomach, Katie…they found the remains of your friends. Inside of *you*, Katie. I need to understand how that happened.”

“I told you.” Katie said, suddenly cold. “I’m cursed.” She pushed the photos back across the table at me. “When…*this*…happened, I guess hunger and thirst had already weakened me so much that I couldn’t fight it off.”

“What is *‘it’* Katie?”

“My shadow.”

“You’re saying your *shadow* made you do this?” I leaned back and crossed my arms, wondering if she’d step into my verbal trap and admit that she’d *torn apart and eaten* her friends.

“Look at me!” Katie held up her scrawny arms and delicate fingers. “Do I look like I could rip a door off of its hinges? Or claw through a wall? Or…or…eat someone piece by piece?”

“You tell me, Katie.” At that, she clammed up. I changed track. “Tell me more about your shadow.” 

“My dad always used to say that he’d made some powerful people very angry, and that one day they’d get him back. I was just a kid back then, and I didn’t associate his warning with the creepy lady who offered me a gold coin for thirteen strands of my hair. By the time I told my parents what happened, it was too late. My shadow had begun to change.

“It whispers to me, you know. Tells me to hurt. To let it take over. Usually I fight it off, but sometimes, when I’m really struggling...I give in. And the consequences are terrible. There’s a reason why Terry, Simone, Hu, and Nick were my first real friends since grade school. Nobody wanted to hang out with *‘the girl who bit her bully’s ear off,’* ya know?” 

“Katie…” I began “...have you ever been checked for mental illness?” 

“I bit off a girl’s ear,” Katie snorted. “What do you think?” she hesitated. “But this is different. I’m fine…unless my shadow takes over.”

“Can you let your shadow take over now?” I asked, fascinated. 

“You wouldn’t survive it.” 

“It’s time for us to lay everything out on the table, Katie.” I stood sternly, my hands on my hips. “You’re facing a very long prison sentence for the murders of your friends. We have evidence from under your fingernails, your teeth, and even from inside your stomach. Unless you can show me who was really responsible–”

*“YOU REALLY WANT TO KNOW?”* Katie’s voice became a throaty rumble that seemed to shake the walls of the interrogation room. The camera stopped working. Katie’s shadow was nowhere to be seen in the flickering fluorescent light. *“THEN OPEN YOUR EYES!”* 

She stood, snapping the chains on her wrists and as if they were made of straw. I bolted before she could reach me–and I was greeted by the laughter of the duty sergeant and the others outside.

“Scared of a little girl, college boy?” he teased. 

“*You* go in there, then!” I panted. The duty sergeant could tell by my pale face that *something* was going on, but when the other officers flung the door open we were treated to a vision of Katie, looking calm and a little confused in her chair. 

The duty sergeant gave me a wry smile…but it faded pretty quick when he saw that Katie’s chains were broken. By the time my hands stopped shaking long enough to finish a styrofoam cup of watery coffee and I made my way back to the interrogation room, Katie was gone.

*‘Removed for my safety,’* the duty sergeant claimed. But in my dreams I still see the narrow-windowed metal door to Katie's interrogation room, swallowed by a living shadow. The case of the *Eudaimonia* was like a splinter in my brain... 

And when I finally got the time and seniority I needed to dive into that rabbit hole, I didn’t like what I was waiting for me in the archives

Katie was found guilty, of course. That was only normal, given the amount of evidence against her. But there was nothing normal about what happened around her in prison.

The abusive male guard who was found leaning dead against the cold concrete wall opposite Katie’s cell with his eyes scorched out of his skull.

The sadistic inmate who simply…disappeared…until what was left of her was found clogging the toilet of the cell she’d shared with Katie. 

The blackout in the shower room. The screams as the guards fought to open the door. The bloody torrent running down the drain from the shattered showerheads. The broken bodies heaped around where Katie crouched, rocking back and holding herself, tears streaming down her cheeks. 

Unexplained transfers and gruesome incidents followed Katie wherever she went, almost like…

*A shadow.* 

I know I shouldn’t be obsessing over old cases. It’s a bad path to start down, the kind that only tends to lead to the bottom of a bottle. 

&#x200B;

Problem is, the last time I checked Katie’s file, there was a new note: she’s been released. 

I wonder who her shadow will touch next?

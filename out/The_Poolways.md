I  remember waking up on that day, full of excitement. Our family lived  almost an hour out of town, so any time we made the trip there we had a  blast. Today was a special occasion though, we were going to go swimming  at the city pool center. I had been there many times, as the facility  had been built before I was even born. But even so, my brothers and I  had insane amount of fun any time we visited the place. It was over  twenty years old now, and the city was planning on closing it and  constructing a new Aquatic center. This was the last chance we would  have to go there, so we planned to stay the whole day. The drive into  town felt so much longer this time. Every billboard that passed by  brought a pang of excitement up in my chest. I knew them all by heart,  and once you saw the Arby's billboard, it was only ten more minutes to  town. After what felt like hours, we finally arrived. The sun was baking  down on the parking lot, it was nearly forty degrees out. I raced my  brothers to the pool center door, ignoring the calls from our mother to  slow down. We ran passed the girl at the desk and into the men's  lockers. She barely glanced up, minimum wage was not enough to chase us  down. Besides, she knew our mother would be in shortly to pay the fee  for us. We did not even stop to shower like they sign said, we just ran  pell mell through the lockers and into the pool area. The familiar  feeling of the tiles on our feet, the wet smell of chlorine in the air,  nothing smelt better to us then.

The  day itself was filled with all the classic fun kids could have in the  pool. Swimming races, splashing contests, ridding the slides over and  over. I even jumped off the second highest diving board, although most  of my bothers were too scared to jump that one. All too soon the day  came to and end. An employee spoke over the intercom, saying that the  pool was closing soon. Our mother put her book away and called for us to  get ready to leave. Nobody likes that heave feeling as you try to get  out of the pool after a long time. Clothes soaking wet, feel like they  weigh 1000 pounds. Grumbling about the cold, we all slowly left the  water, and slopped our way towards the lockers where we left the towels.  I was exhausted, so I sat down for a second, just to let the water  drain off for a bit. When I looked up everyone else had gone. My mother  peaked out from the door, and called to me. Get over here now, we are  leaving! Then I was alone. I got up to go join them, but something  stopped me. I looked back, the tall winding tube slide called to me. One  more ride, it was the last time we would be here after all. I succumbed  to the temptation and ran over to the ladder. It felt so much harder to  climb it now, I was cold and wet from being out of the water for so  long. Then a loud noise echoed out, almost making me loose my grip. The  giant florescence lights were turning off, one at a time. Bang, bang,  bang, they went, as the rows of them powered off. I looked down, I was  closer to the top now, so it still made sense to take the slide down. I  quickly climbed the last few rungs, and positioned my self at the top of  the slide.

&#x200B;

It was so dark now, a yawning black mouth twisting away into  nothingness. I closed my eyes, and pushed down. Down  and down I went, turn after turn, sending me spiraling along. I lost  all sense of direction as I tumbled through the darkness. I did not  remember the slide being this long, it felt like it was going on  forever. Finally I saw light shining from the bottom, then I popped out,  falling a few meters into the water bellow. Coughing up a bit of water I  had swallowed, I pulled myself upright and went to head out of the pool  for the final time. However, after looking around for a solid minute, I  could not see the way out. There was no pool ledge, no doorway leading  to the locker rooms. All I could see were several winding poolways,  leading away. I was confused, I did not remember this part of the pool  center. I started walking through the waist high water, seeing if maybe  the door was around one of the corners. However, each corner I rounded  just revealed more twisting hallways, paths that lead in all directions.  I must have taken the wrong slide, ended up in some other section of  the pool centre. 

&#x200B;

I called out as I trudged through the luke warm water.  My mother’s name echoed for a long time thorough the halls, but there  was no response. I kept moving, surely if I walked for long enough I  would come to some entrance to this place. Ten minutes passed, then  thirty, then an hour. The winding poolways just kept going, all the  same, lit with the glow of humming fluorescent lights on the ceiling. I  was glad that at least the lights in this area remained on. The place I  had taken the slide from had already been turned off. As if reading my  mind, there was a loud bang as a light just out of my view went off.  Like dominoes they all began to turn off, one by one. Bang, bang, bang, the darkness snaked its way toward me, then consumed me, leaving me in udder and total blackness. I was  terrified now, not only because I was lost, but because I knew I would  be grounded for taking so long to get back to the others. I started  yelling out my family’s names, sloshing through the water as fast as I  could. I banged into a wall, then another one, before I finally got  accustomed to the darkness. As soon as I could make the walls out, I  came to a stop to get my bearings. As the sound of the water around me  quieted, a cold feeling came over me. 

&#x200B;

I could here other water splashes  coming to a stop behind me, maybe twenty or thirty meters back. It could  easily just be some employee closing up, but for some reason the hairs  on my arm and neck were all on end. I slowly turned my head back,  squinting out into the darkness behind me. At first I could not see  anything, but as I looked around carefully, I was able to make out a  humanoid figure peering from around a corner all the way at the end of  the poolway. It stood stalk still, not making a sound. I was frozen  there for minutes, staring at it. Was it real? Did I actually see a  figure? Yes, it was defiantly there. My mind was filled with horrifying  ideas before the rational side of my brain took over. This was just the  pool centre I had been to many times, that was probably just Mr Bear,  the cleaning guy. This was good, he could help me find the exit. I  mustered my courage and called out to the figure. My voice came out as a  squeak, not sounding like me at all, “Is that you Mr Bear?” Despite how  quiet I was, my voice echoed over and over again, asking the question.  In differing tones, “Is that you Mr Bear?” The figure did not respond,  but instead it pulled away, out of view. That simple action shook me to my core, that was definitely not Mr Bear. 

&#x200B;

Shivers winding through my  body, trying to make as little noise as possible, I began to move away  from where the figure had vanished. Much slower now, I made my way down  the dark poolways. Hardly daring to breathe as I walked, I tried to  listen for the tell tale splashing from behind me. I would glance back  often, but thankfully did not see anything in the darkness besides the  blue and white tiles. I had no way  to measure the actual time, but my legs burned from walking through the  water. I had to have been moving through the dark poolways for at least  a few hours. Then I saw a faint red glow come into view down one of the  poolways to my left. That had to be the way out! I began to move toward  the light as fast as I could, no longer caring about the splashing I  was making. The red light grew stronger until a ledge came into view. I  climbed out of the water and fell back onto the cold blue tile. Gasping  for breath, finally, somewhere to rest. After a few minutes of catching  my breath, I took a look around. There were several pipes leading from  the ceiling to the floor, with valves on them and such. But what caught  my eye was a door in the wall there, a sign above it prominently  displaying the words EXIT in a deep red glow. 

&#x200B;

Yes! This was the way out!  I must have been going in circles or something and missed it. I  struggled to stand up, and painfully made my way to the door. As I  reached it, I heard the soft slap of wet skin against tile from behind  me. I spun around, to see a dark humanoid figure crawling along the  ceiling of the poolway I had emerged from. It did not freeze as I looked  at it this time, instead it moved lightning fast toward me along the  red lit tile of the roof. I turned away in udder terror, wrenching the  door open I ran through it into the darkness beyond. I  fell down a flight of stairs, banging my way to the bottom where I  landed on some rough carpeting. I lay there for a second, by heart  pounding. There you are! Called a loud angry voice. I looked up to see  my father striding toward me, his face flushed with frustration. We have  been all been looking for you for hours! Where have you been? I saw the  pool staff emerging from where they had been searching, watching us in  relief. My mother ran over and hugged me, her face white. I thought you  were kidnapped! She said, we were so worried! I was in shock, not sure  what to say, but relieved that I was out of the poolways. My father  thanked the staff and we left for the car. I tried to explain what  happened, but my parents though I was lying, trying to cover up my  misdeeds. My father told me I was grounded for a month, however, the  warmth of the car and the safely of towel wrapped around me was worth  being grounded for a lifetime. As we took the hour long trip home, I  swore to myself never swim in a pool centre near closing time again.

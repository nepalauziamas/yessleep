The night was dark and dense with fog as I hurried down the gravel road after my husband. I ran in short spurts, taking every opportunity to hide in the clumps of long grass along the way. The gravel crunched under my feet, and I prayed my footsteps wouldn’t give me away.

Ever since we got married a decade ago, my husband has made it a monthly habit to leave in the middle of the night. He waits until he thinks I’m asleep, before tossing away the covers and tiptoeing out of the bedroom. But I never miss it. I’m always standing at the window, watching him get into our truck and disappear into the night.

Once or twice, I gathered enough courage to ask him where he goes, but he wouldn’t let on. He only said he enjoys the midnight air and the clarity of his thoughts when he’s driving. I’ve been suspecting the worst, but after hearing the same answers year in and year out, I’ve stopped asking.

There isn’t much I could do either way. We only have one truck in our village, and I never learned to drive. I asked, but my husband refused to teach me.

“Don’t worry your pretty little head about it,” he’d said and eventually I gave up on the idea altogether.

This summer our trusty old truck finally gave out. Something with the engine, my husband said. It stuttered, gave one last groan and died just as we were driving home from the big city. He’d made me swear I had nothing to do with it, telling me to cross my heart and hope to die. I did it all. Why would I tamper with our only way of getting food we hadn’t grown ourselves?

Our village may not have much infrastructure, but we are certainly fortunate in terms of natural terrain. Us, women, spend most of our days working the field and nattering away. The gossip isn’t always new or exciting, but we always find out which household grew the largest tomato that year, and whose son or daughter has the most scabs. Our children always win the latter, no contest. I’ve seen them climb the trees in our backyard. They’re like little monkeys, swinging from the branches and doing handstands against the bark.

I know my husband loves our children, even though they’re not ours by blood. When the doctors told me I was infertile eight years ago, we adopted them and have been raising them as our own ever since. I never got to see them before the big day though. My husband told me adoption was a complex process and said he didn’t want me to worry about it. How could I not, though? He was the only family I had at the time.

As I skipped through the brush now, I kept my eyes locked on him. Afraid he would turn back at any moment and catch me, I kept to the shadows of the roadside, hiding in its tall grass. But my husband seemed totally oblivious. He was carrying a small briefcase. The kind that men in the big city go to work with. I wondered what was inside.

Suddenly, he halted and turned left. I kneeled, my heart thumping in my chest, praying he hadn’t heard me. To my surprise, he drew the tall grass apart like curtains and stepped into the bowels of the field. Just like that, he was gone. I waited, weighing my options and listening for the sound of footsteps, but the night was silent aside from the chirp of crickets and my own labored breathing.

I scrambled to my feet and slowly crossed to the other side of the road. Had he heard me tailing him? What if he was hiding, waiting for me to come find him?

I took a deep breath, and parted the grass that had swallowed him just moments prior. I even shut my eyes, unwilling to face up to the inevitable consequences of my own actions. But none came. The field whispered and the crickets chirped, and there was no sign of my husband. I opened my eyes to find a long narrow path, surrounded by grass on either side, and footprints in the mud beneath it.

I followed it, the blades of grass brushing over my face and my heart ringing in my ears. There was nowhere I could hide here. What if my husband decided to make his way back? I hurried along the beaten path, until I reached its end. There was nowhere else to go, but a rustling sound coming from behind the thick wall of grass in front of me, told me I was in the right place.

I parted the grass curtains very slightly and peeked through. Here, in the middle of the field, was a small clearing, no bigger than our backyard. It was overgrown and messy, and it seemed to be littered with stones of different shapes and sizes, aligned semi-neatly in parallel rows. There was writing on some of them, but the lettering was so small and faded I couldn’t make out what it said.

My stomach lurched as my husband emerged from behind a shrub, carrying a shovel and some rope. I sprung backwards, and covered my mouth, not trusting myself to be quiet. I couldn’t let him see me now. Not before I found out what he was up to.

I watched as he stuck the shovel into the ground and started digging. He worked quickly and effortlessly, and it was clear to me it wasn’t the first time he had done this. It took a while though, and just as I was starting to get drowsy, the edge of the shovel hit something hard. I perched up in my hiding place, suddenly alert. Was it treasure? Were we going to be rich?

But before I had time to imagine the things I would buy, my husband disappeared inside the hole. He was gone for a while, and I started to worry I hadn’t seen him leave. The thought alone made me break out in a cold sweat. He re-emerged eventually, picking the rope up from the ground and throwing one end into the hole. What on Earth was he doing?

My eyes nearly popped out of their sockets when I saw the rope jerk up, as though something was pulling it on the other end. I could see my husband straining and leaning backwards as the rope twitched and tugged back.

“Come on,” he grunted, “Come on!”

What I saw afterwards will forever remain etched into my brain. It wasn't a treasure. It was… human. No, not human. Not in the conventional sense.

Even in the dim light of the moon, I could see how translucent it was. Patches of missing flesh revealed its protruding bones and the remaining strands of hair on its head were a tousled mess. Half of its face was missing and the other half looked like it had been melted off with acid. It climbed stiffly, as if it had spent years and years lying in the ground.

Sweat sprang out on my forehead and dripped down my temples. I wondered whether I should run. Run and – and what? There was no one that could help me. No one would believe me. What’s more, I couldn’t even drive.

As it took its final step out of the hole, the thing stumbled and fell to its knees, its bones buckling under the stress. My husband rushed over, held it up by its armpits and slowly guided it to the space he’d prepared on the ground. I watched as he opened his briefcase and took out several containers, arranging them neatly at his side. I couldn’t see what they were, but as a gust of wind blew my way, I knew they certainly smelled strong. Or perhaps that was the body.

Somehow, I willed myself not to retch. Being found out at this stage would be a bad idea. Especially since it wasn’t only my husband now; that thing seemed to be alive and well, although I wasn’t sure about its ability to hear. I decided to make myself scarce, before my husband finished whatever he was doing.

I kept glancing back as I crept along the narrow grass pathway, only breathing a sigh of relief when I reached the main road. He wouldn’t find me here. I didn’t have to worry about making noise as I sprinted towards the village, the gravel crunching under my shoes. I had no idea what I was going to do. I’d just discovered my husband digging up a body. Was that what he’d been getting up to every time he went out? My skin prickled even as I ran, but I took no notice. This wasn’t something to be taken lightly. I had to find a way to protect our children.

I hopped into bed as soon as I got home, ignoring my muddy knees and clammy skin. I’d devised a plan. I was going to wait until my husband left for work the next day, and travel to the city with my kids, even if that meant paying hundreds for a cab. I certainly wasn’t going to risk this happening again.

When I woke up the following morning, my husband’s side of the bed was already empty. Either that, or perhaps he hadn’t slept at all. I never heard him come home, much less enter our bedroom. However, as I descended the stairs, I heard him talking in the kitchen.

“Yeah, it’s just one house over,” my husband said over the gurgle of the kettle.

“I see it!” a female voice chimed, and I clutched the railing for support.

They noticed me as soon as I appeared in the doorway. My husband looked like his usual self, aside from the slightly darker circles under his eyes. Beside him stood a woman I’d never seen before. She had waist-length blonde hair and green eyes. But that’s not what stood out to me. She was wearing my clothes.

“Uh, hello,” I stammered, raising my hand to greet them and shooting my husband a questioning look.

He smiled, “This is Isabella, she’ll be moving into the house on the other side of the road.”

“Hi, Isabella,” I nodded, still eyeing my husband unsurely.

“It’s nice to meet you!” she beamed and took a step forward, holding her hand out.

As she did so, however, her knees buckled and she fell to the floor, my husband grabbing hold of her just in time.

“Whoopsie!” he chuckled, “Careful, careful, mind the baby!”

I stared at them, “The baby?”

Isabella nodded, “I’m expecting.”

The floor seemed to waver, and I grabbed hold of the kitchen counter.

“Can we talk?” I asked my husband, my voice almost pleading.

“What’s up,” he demanded, as we left the room and shut the door, “Are you alright? You look pale.”

I swallowed. “I know what you did.”

He shook his head, “I don’t understand what you mean, honey.” 

“I followed you last night,” my voice was barely a whisper, but I could feel anger welling up inside me, “I saw what you did.”

My husband was silent.

“I’m leaving you,” I told him, “And I’m taking the children. They can’t know about this.”

Still, he didn’t say a word.

“How could you do something like this?” I hissed, “We have a normal family. A normal life-”

“Without it,” he interrupted, his voice low, “This family wouldn’t exist.”

I stared at him, dumbfounded. “What do you mean?”

“I gave Isabella life,” he continued, “As I did for you. As I did for our children. As I did for our village.”

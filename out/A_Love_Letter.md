 

*My dear family,* 

*My lover is love itself. Her hands caress my cheeks while I play with the curl of her fading black hair. She sings to me in a soft voice that reminds me of someone but I just can’t place it. She tells me sweet nothings and holds my hand while I cry. My love is patient, kind, and full of compassion.*

*My lover takes me on walks around our small property, she says she can’t leave. I want to take her far from this place and show her the world. But my love says she mustn't, she can’t. ‘ I don't understand’ I tell her, with my head laid in her lap. She coos at me and says ‘ My love, I will never leave this house. I will never leave you.’* 

*My lover makes due on her promise. We have a wedding in our backyard. It’s just us in our best Sunday dresses but I swear the neighbors could feel our love for miles. We kiss and I feel her cold lips on mine. Everything is serene, a dream. I never thought I would find this love. We have been bonded since the moment I laid my eyes on her.* 

*My lover says that I needn’t leave. That being with her is the best place for me. I agree and I start planting in the garden so I don’t have to leave. I am meant to be here, with her. My family tries to reach out, but my love says that they mustn't know of our love. They might not be as accepting. I agree and kiss her. My body chills.* 

*My lover is by my side as people begin to collect around our home. She tells me that there is a way for us to be together forever. I smile so wide I can feel the ends split. I must do one thing first, write this. My lover deserves to be known. Our love deserves to be shared. It’s beautiful after all. Hopefully she won’t mind.*   

*My love is patient, kind, and full of compassion. I am going to be with her forever. I hope you understand.* 

*Love, Rana* 

I found this letter in a home that I was called to perform a wellness check at. Along with the letter was what I believe to be Rana. She had hung herself up in the master bedroom closet and the letter was on the chair next to her. There was no one else in the house with her. 

According to her family, she had been dealing with severe mental illness that caused her to hallucinate frequently. Rana had lost touch with her family about two weeks ago and they have been trying to contact her since. They finally resorted to a wellness check. 

I called the proper authorities after that and left to conduct other business after answering some questions. I was just walking out to my car when I had a suspicion I was being watched, so I turned around and inspected the house once more. 

I saw a group of officers walking in and out of the house carrying different items and equipment. But then my eyes glossed over the upstairs window and that's when I saw it. A woman with curly black hair staring down at the commotion. She must have felt my eyes on her because she looked at me with a smile. Then she walked away. 

I immediately told the police what I saw, but when they inspected upstairs, there was nothing. No curly black hair woman. I asked the family if Rana was dating anyone and they profusely denied it. 

But I know there is something more here. Ever since that case I have been having dreams of Rana in a dark room, screaming for help. I think that means something but I don't know what to do next. 

I don't think Rana's death was a suicide.

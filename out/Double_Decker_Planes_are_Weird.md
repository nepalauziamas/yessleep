I, (M,35) went on vacation recently. I have only ever been on a plane 3 times, twice of which was only 2 decks, for packages and passengers. This double Decker was a holder for packages and 2 stories for passengers. But, I have never seen anyone go on to the lower deck.

Some might think they come on earlier or after, but windows for the lower deck show no presence from anyone else, or that they come on later, maybe a few minutes before the flight starts. But even then, the hallway for the passengers to enter the plane was far from the door. For all I know they could be going on at the same time but we just can't notice.

Remember how I said I never saw any presence in the windows on the lower deck? That was a lie. I see, from the corner of my eye at the last second, a big, black suit, and what seemed to be a bald man marching an unidentified thing.

Now the flight was normal, but out of nowhere the turbulence would severely slow down and we would lose altitude, but gain it back within a few minutes. At unusual times, the lower deck would make a sound, not the people, the floor itself. And not just a creek noise, it's like the floor would scream. It doesn't make sense, but just imagine the floor, but the floor was a flock of babies that screamed when a jack-in-the-box flung out. 

About a quarter way into the flight, the pilot made an announcement.

"Attention everyone, this is your captain speaking... *Brief stop* ... We will be landing at the closest airport for a fuel refill."

Odd, they usually tell the location so that the passengers know where they are, right? Well, when we landed, I had no idea where we were. Are we in the same country we took off in? Are we even on earth? I hope we were because I did not see us go any higher than the sky. And as I remembered, the pilot said that we were full on gas and wouldn't have to stop for at least a day and a half.

It was only 6 hours.

Where are we?

We lifted off again, and the pilot said "sorry for the inconvenient stop, the gas was low. Enjoy the ride, we are off to..." To where? Hopefully to where I was planning. Why did it cut off? Eh, it's alright.

I hope it's alright.

Now, let's hope you remember the second deck.

We were travelling breezely, everyone was chill, no babies screaming (thankfully) and the floor stopped talking. But, what set everyone off was the loud bang. All the passengers panicked, but no one made it obvious for the sake of the young ones. Until it was obvious.

A loud lightning bang emerged from the bottom of the plane. And from what everyone saw, the sky's were beautifully blue, not a sick cloud in sight. So when the planes engine cut off, Everyone. Panicked. Screaming, cursing, the pilot attempting to make contact. It all hit the fan.

The bald man I saw came from nowhere, saying that we were going to be fine and to trust him and no one else. Then he told us to look out the windows and to not do anything else. No one wanted to, they didn't want to see the sight of the plane falling from the heavens. But, when they did, the plane was perfectly straightened out. And the bald man? He was gone. And the flight had no major breaks for the rest of the ride. Once we landed, the stairs for the plane came around, and family by family, we hopped off. But, as for the second deck, well, people came off. And, I swear, NO ONE was on that deck. Yet, multiple families and business workers had come out.

Unlike the people on the top deck, who were all pretty shaken up,  the people on the lower deck (who, all looked soulless) were perfectly fine. Like nothing had happened. And the bald man, even after being on the plane, never came off or even made a presence in the airport. So people, that's my story. 

And a reminder from personal experience, never go on a plane drunk.

Sorry guys, but the humour got to me. This was indeed a fictional story, but please, even though it's fictional, don't go on a plane drunk xD.

Sorry if the story isn't as good as some want. This is my first time on this subreddit, let alone writing on it.

I wasn’t surprised to find the dead body of Cassie Wilson, murdered at the foot of her bed. The stab wounds had made mincemeat of her chest, stomach, and face. Her reading glasses lay mangled by her legs, and her nightgown was in shreds by the door.

I took another sip of my coffee; long black.

Whatever had happened here hadn’t been the work of a professional killer. It was too personal, too passionate. Whoever had done this wanted old Cassie to writhe, and she had. Plain and simple, this was the work of someone with some serious personal beef. And that beef hadn’t been settled with her death.

I tried another loud sip at my coffee cup.

Cassie’s corpse was like a boiled crab at a social gala, a wrinkled carapace, soft meaty innards dug from a crushed shell. Of course, none of this explained why there was also a Cassie Wilson loudly snoring away in bed next to all of this, completely asleep and oblivious to the carnage of – well – herself, at the foot of the bed.

I tried another slurp at my coffee cup; a little louder, a little shriller.

It’s not that I wanted to wake her, but I didn’t understand how someone could sleep through their own violent murder. Call me what you want but if you’d also seen this exact same scene play out thirty-one other times in one night, you’d also be just a little curious.

The weight of the yellow clasp-envelope under my arm was a reminder of why I was there; thick and heavy. Lucky me, the killer hadn’t made a meaty goop out of Cassie’s hands. I checked the list in my pocket one last time.

*Corpse of Cassie Wilson. Yellow Envelope. Left Hand.*

I bent down, and with gloved hands folded her cold stiff fingers over the top of the novel-width envelope. This delivery had to tell a story, and that story was that this corpse was not letting go of that envelope.

Retrospectively, this looks a little bad. But that was my job. I was a delivery driver. Sure, someone out there was pulling a grand revenge plot, or a spiteful prank, or a really weird tax evasion scheme. But I wasn’t even the messenger in all of this.

The messenger was some guy with a knife around an hour ago, probably her ex-husband; Charlie Dean. And I was just delivering one of the thickest A4 envelopes I’d ever seen. Sure, I *could* have called the police. But *should* I have called the police? Not on your life.

I found myself back in the black unmarked van, waiting where I’d left it two blocks down and on a corner. There was a tremble in my hands as I turned the key in the ignition. The engine didn’t purr, and the lights didn’t spark to life. The faint pressure of vibration, the dim glow of the dashboard, and the hissing lull of radio static was what whispered the van had started.

I sat and listened to the soothing static signal between two stations. No random numbers. No maddened mutterings. No oddly accurate prediction of weird times yet to come. That day, the static sat alone on the airwaves. I rifled through my coat for the list and a lighter, applied one to the other, and left the rest of the work to my ash tray. I stretched back in my seat.

The crisp air inside the van was a cold sweat. The mileage was down to just under fifty kilometres. I’d started the night with over a hundred. I closed my eyes. A quick look in the rear-view mirror. That’s all I needed.

*Open. Memorise. Shut. Recall.*

The back of the van was dark, but the dim glow of the dashboard was enough. It was still there, in the back-left corner of the van. A fleshy mass of shadowy *something*. But smiling this time. Smiling was different, smiling was new.

Normally it would just stand there, stooped and hunched, stationary and faceless in the back of the van. But now it was smiling. At me? No. But the thing without a face was smiling. Not with lips, but an entire mouth. A mouth that was wrong. A mouth that was slowly sliding off its chin. Whatever smile that thing was using, it wasn’t a part of its body.

That night had been easy; done and dusted with plenty of time to spare. I’d delivered the thirty-two unmarked envelopes, each one a different colour, and each colour corresponding to a list now quietly burning away in the ash tray. Thirty-two letters, thirty-two murders, thirty-two people both dead and sleeping soundly in their beds. I’d seen a lot of weird, weird shit in that town, but this was weirder than normal. This wasn’t *their* weird. It was mine.

A tap on the window. The night was a cold sweat. Cassie Wilson, minced. Ruby Cruft, splattered. Alisha Day, ribboned. A tap on the window. Had I locked the doors? Do I try now? Would that draw attention to it? What if it *was* locked? A tap on the window. What if pressing the button to lock the door unlocks it instead? A tap on the window. I turned to see a devious grin on the other side of the window. And honestly? I would have taken my chances with the deranged knife-wielding minceriser.

“Hey dude, check out this rock I just found.”

It was Bundy, local fly-in fly-out pain in my ass.

Another tap on the window, “It’s a super freakin’ weird rock dude.”

The dark tinted window slides down; seamless, soundless.

And he fanned at the air with a lump of asphalt from the cracked road beneath us, “Jesus Christ dude, you lightin’ up in there?”

The soft smell of rum gently sieved through the smell of paper burning away in my ash tray.

“Hey dude, secret’s safe with me,” then he let out a short laugh, “Can I get a puff?”

Before you get the wrong idea. The guy always smells of rum. Bundaberg Rum. He doesn’t reek of it, and he doesn’t stink of it. The guy isn’t drenched in it, and it doesn’t carry on his words. Bundy always smelled of rum. As if he used it as a washing detergent, or a soap, or maybe a light cologne. The guy was a pain in the ass, but he’s no drunk… to my knowledge.

Did I know his real name? No. But the guy had a knack for figuring out where I was at any given moment, despite my random day-to-day schedule, and despite the one-way windows of the van. Always accompanied by that soft scent of Bundaberg Rum.

“What’s up Bundy?”

“Dude, I need a lift. Do you know the flats outside of town?”

Who didn’t? The flats outside of town were a strange Tetris board of concrete foundations that marked where a town once sat. It was popular with local teens, an edgy place to hang out and smoke cigarettes. It was hated by the adults, a constant reminder of what the death of the mining industry would slowly but surely bring.

To me, the flats were a place I found myself at the start and end of every shift. It was at the flats that I’d been given the thirty-two coloured envelopes from earlier, and the place I was now headed to end my shift.

Did I find it suspicious that Bundy, the guy that showed up anywhere I parked the van, just so happened to be headed the same way I was? Sure. But this was the guy that had, at one time, appeared in a public portable toilet I was delivering; after I’d checked it was empty, and after I’d padlocked it. So I figured if he really meant me any harm, this reverse-Houdini would have done it by now.

“Come on bud, it’s kind of murdery out here tonight.”

Maybe it was the smoke, or Bundy’s – well – fragrance. Maybe it was the face of Cassie Wilson – the corpse, not the loudly snoring old lady – every time I blinked. Maybe it’s Maybelline. But, as much as the guy was a pain in the ass, I wouldn’t have wanted to find him on the side of the road looking like a jumbo supermarket beef mince pack.

The passenger door buzzed with a dim flicker and a soft thunk.

“Sure, why not? I’m headed that way anyway.”

“Much obliged, my dude,” he said, tipping his chunk of asphalt like the fedora he didn’t have.

I quickly checked the rear-view mirror as he smashed his ‘weird rock’ on the road and sauntered over to the passenger’s side. This was going to be alright, right?

“Hey, I think the door might be locked.”

Huh, I guess I *had* forgotten to lock it.

Bundy’s stare was intense as we spilled down the highway. The van was dark oil, the road was moonless midnight water. The hissing static I once found soothing, the dim glow of the dashboard I once found calming, the gentle vibration of the engine I once found relaxing. I could feel every detail in the space I once found safe, and it wasn’t.

“Hey Bundy, is everything okay?” I asked my tense passenger.

There was no response. But his non-response was all I needed. Bundy was about to ask a question. I checked the rear-view mirror. We just had to get to the flats, causing as little ripples as possible. But the only way we were going to do that is if I knew which bomb I had to defuse first. I traced his stare. Was it me? No, a little off. It was the dashboard. What was the thing with the dashboard again? Bundy cut me off with the last thing I wanted to hear.

“Dude! The mileage on your van’s going backwards.”

When you’ve worked in this industry as long as I have, you kind of forget what is and isn’t normal. I stole a quick glance back into the rear-view mirror. When you’ve worked in this industry as long as I have, you kind of forget.

“Oh yeah? Wow, that’s so weird. I guess it must be… broken?” I tried.

“Dude, a broken odometer doesn’t count backwards.”

Bundy was suddenly a car expert. Fancied himself a mechanic now, did he? Good for him.

I checked the rear-view mirror again.

There was a catch in his voice, “What are you doing?”

My foot was off the gas. The left indicator was on.

My response was as calm as I could make it, given the circumstances, “I’m pulling over, mate.”

The indicator blinked as we crawled to a halt on the side of a road in the middle of nowhere. The van’s soothing tremors stopped abruptly. The hissing static of the radio died. And the glow of the dashboard faded as the van was plunged into the breathing darkness of the outside.

Bundy repeated the same question, but different, “What are you doing?”

“Get out of the van Bundy.”

His mouth was a quivering grin. A moment of silence stretched as a cold prickling crept up through my hands and out from my lips. The night was a cold sweat.

“Get. Out. Of. The. Van. Bundy.”

Another moment of silence stretched as cold electricity filled the air, a stiff current. I could feel it. Bundy could feel it. This wasn’t a joke. This wasn’t banter. This was serious.

Bundy’s grin crumbled, and he slowly started to nod, “Okay.”

The door opened. The door closed. The handbrake released. Whatever Bundy said as I left him, out there in the steamy waft of sun-boiled spiny shrubs recovering in a cold sweat, was lost in the radio’s soothing hiss.

I want to say my hands were trembling, that there was some trepidation. But there wasn’t. I checked the rear-view mirror. It was there, right behind the passenger seat. Its long, thin fingers tightly gripped the shoulders of the black leather seat covers.

The flats were a darkness that breathes, a palpable darkness with a heartbeat. They were once the closest town to the old mine, now they’re an archipelago of lost islands on a sea of red dirt and wild weeds. I hopped from crumbling island to crumbling island. I didn’t need light to know where I was going. I knew the flats. And the flats knew me.

The old bakery, now a slab of flaking concrete iced in tile grout. The old school, now shallow concrete flowerpots of spinifex and weeds. The old community hall, a tombstone bearing murals now worth less than their mosaic tiles.

John was leaning against what others might assume was once a streetlight. He would have vanished in the dark if not for the glowing tip of his cigarette, the only light in a place that no longer had it. This wasn’t the kind of industry where we wasted time on small talk. As he heard my approach, his smoke hit the ground and was stamped out.

I started, “Van P-102 is done for the night.”

I didn’t see his head shake, but I felt it.

“Not quite, mate.”

“Did I miss anything?”

“I’m gonna need a small favour.”

Of course, I’d be happy to accept if what John was saying was what he actually meant. A small favour would be doing a quick bloodletting on his radiator. A small favour would be holding the flashlight while he ran some bone along the tread of his tyres. A small favour would be telling him I thought his edgy smoking out in the dark of the flats was stupid.

Those would be small favours. And I’d expect those small favours to be paid sometime down the track. But if this guy was paying back, he’d owe me three kidneys. Two of his, and the other from one of his kids.

“Depends.”

“I’ve got a crate here for Dr. Spade.”

“I don’t handle crates. Have you tried Kate? She’s with C-101.”

“Kate?”

The way he spoke her name was a question, but not one that was meant to be answered. Much less, it shouldn’t have been followed by as long a pause as this.

“I’m afraid that won’t be possible at this time.”

I couldn’t see his face in the dark of the flats, but I didn’t like that pause. And I really didn’t like that reply. It was too thorough, too clinical, too closed-statement sounding. John said those words like he was listing strangers’ names off an obituary.

“I’m not really familiar with crate drops John.”

There was another pause. But this was a pause I’d started. It was my pause. I’d set the pace. It was time slowing, slowing, slowing to a halt. And then it wasn’t.

“Mate, I’m gonna need a small favour.”

This wasn’t good. You see, it’s the placement of the mate. And he’d just shifted from the passive end mate, to the active checkmate. John wasn’t asking anymore. Hell, now this wasn’t even a favour. This was an order.

“What time?” I gave in.

“Dawn.”

“Wait. Dawn?”

“Yep, this has to be dropped at dawn.”

I waited for him to work out the error in what he’d just told me. But he didn’t budge.

“John. We don’t deliver in daylight.”

“And it won’t be daylight. As long as you deliver this crate exactly on time.”

So there I was, once again, spilling down the highway. In a dark van, under darker night, in darkest spirits. Kate’s crate in the back of my van was heavy, and its contents clinked and clattered like fine cutlery. The odometer said ten kilometres, not even enough mileage to get to Dr. Scale’s practice. And I couldn’t help but wonder what had happened.

Last time I’d talked to Kate, she was excited to finally solve the mystery of what happens when a van’s odometer hits zero. Back then, her mileage had been three kilometres. And now John was acting as if she’d died.

A spotlight sparked to life in my mirrors. Some asshole was burning holes in my retinas.

The mileage was down to nine.

The spotlight was getting brighter, closer. What the hell was this asshole doing? If they kept up at that speed they’d-

The vehicle behind me nudged the back bumper of the van, and I struggled with the wheel as the van shook. They’d hit me. The son of a bitch had hit me. I slammed my foot down on the accelerator, the heavy crate in the van slid and slammed into the back doors, and the van slipped sleek into the night.

But the spotlights followed. No. Followed was the wrong word. I was going top speed, this asshole was somehow overtaking me.

The mileage was down to eight.

I turned to look the asshole in the eyes, spotlights still burned into my retinas. What I saw was a black, unmarked van; identical to my own in every way, except for one. The windows were down.

The mileage was down to seven.

The face that stared back at me was… Kate’s? But it was wrong. There was something horribly, terribly wrong with her. Her skin was pale. And it cracked and flaked like ash. Dripping from her nose, trailing from her eyes, streaming from her low hanging mouth, was a liquid dark and tar-like.

The mileage was down to six.

Kate had been swallowed by it. Swallowed by the thing in the mine. Swallowed by the thing that had followed me from the flats before they got their name, to my van, and every trip I’d made since. Her eyes didn’t stare, they were dead and vacant. But they were pointed in my direction, through the one-way glass.

The mileage was down to five.

“Oh shit!” Bundy yelled from the passenger seat.

And I almost rolled us off the road in surprise. Bundy was sitting in the passenger seat of my van. Kate’s van swerved in like a bumper car at a fairground.

“Brakes!” Bundy yelled.

“No shit Sherlock!” I yelled back as I smashed down on the brake pedal.

The mileage was down to four.

Kate swerved past in front of us, narrowly clipping the front of the van. I slammed back down on the accelerator, thanking the flats this thing was an automatic.

The mileage was down to three.

“Dude! Faster!” the stowaway yelled.

“This is as fast as it goes!” I hissed back at him.

It was then that I noticed what Bundy held in his hands. The night was a cold sweat. Cassie Wilson, minced. Ruby Cruft, splattered. Alisha Day, ribboned. In his hands he held a novel-width envelope. Red with black spots. And I now knew exactly who he was.

“You piece of shit,” I said to my exact look alike.

The mileage was down to two.

“Well, took you long enough,” the other me smirked.

A spotlight sparked to life in front of us, and the vans collided.

The mileage was down to one.

And I woke with a jump in a hospital bed.

“Oh, good,” came a familiar voice, “You’re awake.”

Jess was in the corner of the room, dressed as a nurse, and I wondered what she was playing at. Last thing I remembered, the antique store was burning down and someone had hit me in the back of the head. How had we gotten out?

“Jess?” I asked.

She frowned, “Jessica.”

Something was wrong. Jess was looking at me as if I were a stranger, as if we’d never met. It was the same Jess. Her hair was long and dark. Her eyes were tired, and almost certainly a colour. But there was no recognition in those eyes.

“But you’re-”

“A detective will see you now,” she interrupted.

“But- Wait, at this hour?”

The moon was high in the sky through the open window. She shook her head dismissively as she left the room. And what followed was... confusing. It was a series of weird questions from a man who looked off. His skin was pale as death, his eyes dark as night, and there was something about the length and shape of his canine teeth each time he opened his mouth.

He started out easy. What’s your name? Chris. When were you born? 1998. When did you arrive in Halmere? Not too long ago.

Then it got weirder. Are you human? Last time I checked, yes. Are you a holder? No idea what that is. Contractor or contractee? No idea what those are either. Finally, he asked about the antique store. And I had none of the answers he was looking for.

I told him everything, bar myself and the attic. I told him about the antiques, and the customers. And he shrugged them off. But when I got to the creatures, he leant forward in his seat.

“What were they after?” he asked.

“Hell if I know?” I shrugged.

“Why couldn’t they enter the store?”

Again, I shrugged, “The place was weird.”

He gave me a tight-lipped smile, apologised dryly, and then left.

I’ve spent the last two days in a hospital bed. Jess still acts like she doesn’t know me, and I’m about to be discharged. Which means being searched for ‘illegal devices’ like my phone. Then I’ll be processed into Halmere… whatever that means.

I’m not sure if this will be my final post, but it’s over for now.

If I can leave with just a few parting words, it’s that there *was* something wrong with the antique store in the woods outside of Halmere. And it was me.

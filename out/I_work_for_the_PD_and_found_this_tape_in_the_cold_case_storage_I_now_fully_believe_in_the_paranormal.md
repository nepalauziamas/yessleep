"Okay, what's going on, Detective Walsh?"


"Ah, Finally! Detective Lewis! Where've you been?"


"Just, tying up some loose ends. So, what's up? Why have you called me in this time?"


"You recognise this guy?"


"Mmm... no. Why, who is he?"


"Well, a complete whack-job off the streets we're assuming. He has no I.D. and hasn't stopped mumbling to himself since we sat him in that room. Some area 51 lunatic I think. Came in with, *this."* He held up a vial filled with some sort of silver-liquid.


"What is it?"


"We don't know yet."


"Alright...So, why call me?"


"He asked for you by name, Lewis. Your full name. Said he'd only talk to you."


"Alright. I'll, erm, I'll go talk to him then."


......


"Hello. I'm detective Lewis. I hear you want to speak to me."


"That's right. I'm here to give you a message."


"Ookay."


"You may not believe me, but I need for you to pretend to believe me until you actually do...Okay?"


"...Okay." I could hear his eyes rolling.


"I, er, I work for a company that isn't exactly, "on-the-map", if you will."


"Uh-huh."


"Tell me, Detective Lewis...do you believe in aliens?"


"Ermm...My honest answer is, no."


"Good. Neither do I...Do you believe in the afterlife?"


"I...I do, but-"


"No-no, there's no "but" about it...you either believe, or you don't."


"Okay...Yes. I believe in a life after death."


"Gooood."


There was an airy, awkward silence.


"These so-called "aliens" that you speak and hear of in movies and books, are actually...*human souls."* I thought he may have responded here, but he didn't. I continued, "My employers are the ones in control. The aliens people *claim* to have seen, are actually just the outer-skins we use to trap the souls before they leave this world."


"Wait-"


"Ever seen a UFO?...Nah, you probably haven't. But I'm sure you're aware that there *are* people out there who *have* seen UFOs, right?"


"Well, yeah, but-"


"Those large, circular crafts with lights beaming down? They're what we call, Soul-Catchers...And those lights?...They're the human souls that are trying to escape."


More silence filled the space.


"Most souls are white in colour. These are what we call, The Generics. Green-lighted souls are people who are pure."


*"Pure?-"*


"And souls that shine with a reddish-hue while being captured, are, well...*not* pure."


"Wait...slow down-"


"Ya-know that probing feeling people experience when they claim they've been abducted? That's just the mechanical-arm that the skin is attached to for capturing. Once captured, these souls are then sent to orientation. White-souls are sent to work, Green-souls are adored, and Red-souls....Red-souls get recycled. They can only be recycled once, though. If they are captured as a Red-soul for a second time, they are sent to The Hollow to be, erm...*processed.*"


"And why are you telling *me* all of this?"


"Because, Detective Andrew Lewis, your soul is about to be recycled...You've been a very naughty boy, haven't you?...Those, *loose ends,* you had to, *tie-up*..."


**The Detective gasps...**


"You're going to need that vial, Detective...your second chance has just expired..."

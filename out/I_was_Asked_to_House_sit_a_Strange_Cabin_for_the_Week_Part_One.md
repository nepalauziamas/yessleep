I want to start things off simply. I’m a 23-year-old drop-out, living out of an old apartment building in middle-of-nowhere Kentucky. My place isn’t too bad, but small-town life can get hectic. There isn’t much for work here, and what is available is less than ideal. I was never the type to wanna work my days away on some farm, I’d rather take my chances with something more mundane, but easy jobs pay little, and to no one's surprise, I’m not the only one who couldn’t be bothered to break their back to get by, so all the good jobs are taken. This means that I’m usually strapped for cash. 

I'm one of those people who get by on nothing but government checks and hand-outs. I’m not proud of it, but that's just the way it is. I’ve been meaning to move out somewhere else where I can find better work for decent pay, but since I would need money to do that in the first place, I’m kinda stuck. Anyway, I think I should just get to the point, the reason you’re probably reading this right now. 

About a month or two ago, I received an email offering me a job, it was from an older couple, who said that they needed someone to watch over their home while they were away for the week. The details seemed simple enough, they just wanted me to stay and watch over their house. I had assumed they were just paranoid about robbers or wildlife, but I was wrong, so fucking wrong. I would have never guessed the reality of the situation in a hundred years. 

To any normal person, you probably would have just looked over the email and assumed it was spam, but I needed cash now, so I decided to just go with it; that was my biggest mistake. Looking back on it, I don’t even know how they got ahold of my email in the first place. 

Everyone thinks that I had some sort of nervous breakdown or something like that, but I know what I saw, the things that I felt. No imbalance of the mind or mental break could ever replicate the horrible things that I saw at that house in the woods. 
    
The day it all began started normal enough, I woke up, laid in bed for about an hour, then pulled myself from the warmth of my covers. It was another day, alone in my apartment. Normally, I can’t even remember what I had for breakfast the day before, but for that day, I remember everything that happened, from the minuscule details to the happy moments of excitement and joy. I never expected that the following days would leave me plagued  with fear. Sometimes it seems like nothing can quell the pain. 

I spent most of the day relaxing on the couch, baking in the heat that surged through my living room windows. I was glued to my phone, watching funny videos online and chatting with a few of my friends when I received the email. I can only recall sheer curiosity beginning to rise within me, especially as I read the most important part of the message. They were offering $30 an hour to any random asshole to just live in their house for a week. I couldn't believe it at first. I had decided that the only way to know for sure would be to look up the provided address and make sure that the place even actually existed, I was met with surprise to see that it was real. The home was exactly as they depicted it. 

Finally, I decided to call the number of the address and confirm that they were in fact offering such a job. As it turns out, they were. I instantly became excited. For a full week, I would be paid 30 dollars an hour just to watch some random house. This was pretty much my dream job; it was like the stars had all aligned and I was finally gonna catch a break. I became even happier when I realized that the place was located only an hour or so away from where I was. 

This was it. With that kinda money, I could begin looking for a new place to live, somewhere that I would be able to finally make something of myself, instead of just lazing around all day, living off of other people’s work, though, I did appreciate the fact that I had such a system to rely on in my time of need. 

This seemed like an opportunity to change some of the more negative aspects of my life. A part of me even thought that if I took initiative, I could earn some respect, especially from my family. My parents always acted supportive of my life choices, but I knew that deep down, they didn’t respect me, and honestly, I could understand why. The rest of my family, however, were much less reserved about their thoughts, and would often send me overbearing texts about how I needed to rethink this or that, and how I was just gonna continue to be a loser if I didn’t change my lifestyle. I mean, I knew they were right, which is why I never really tried to argue with them, but still, I would have gotten the message just as well with a real conversation. 

Perhaps this job offer would be the thing that I needed to change my mindset I thought, like a push over the edge, so to speak. Well, I did go over the edge, an edge that meets an abyss so far down, that even in the clear light of day, darkness is all I can see above me. They say that once you reach a certain point, you’ll only be able to go up from there, but that's far from the truth. Whoever said that never experienced what I’m about to tell you all. Trust me, there is no going up from here. I promise you that. 

After contacting the owners of the place to confirm the email, I began to question the safety of what I was really doing, I mean, I had no clue who these people even were, and now I was just agreeing to stay over at their house for a week? That was crazy, right? Those are the types of thoughts that I had for the first couple of hours before I began to reconsider my doubts. 

I heard their voices, they were just a nice older couple, and they sounded like they couldn’t hurt a fly. There's no way that anything could have gone wrong, right? I needed to stop overthinking it and just be happy for myself. I was given a chance to make some real cash for the easiest job imaginable. The rest of the morning I spent contemplating how I could use the money, besides obvious things like a new apartment, I was curious as to what was possible. There were a few things that I needed, most importantly, I wanted a new car. I was fine with buying a used one, as long as it looked halfway decent and ran better than the old piece of junk I had outside, and If I found a good enough deal for a nice-enough-looking ride, I could probably attract the attention of some girls if I’m lucky, though, that was the least of my worries, and I’m not even just talking about the event. 

I’m a messed up person, like, in general. I’ve been known to have breakdowns. Never anything akin to what I experienced at that house, but still. I’ve had pretty bad hallucinations before, like bright lights and faraway noises. That's what my doctors believe happened to me, that I just finally snapped and had an intense episode, but the scars tell me a different story; mental and physical alike. 

The day that was set for me to finally go to the house was nearing, and I was surprisingly relaxed about it. I needed the cash so bad that I didn’t have an ounce of energy to spare the rational side of my brain, so I continued to think about how great the opportunity was, and in all honesty, it was a good deal. Under any other circumstances, I’d probably be pretty damn happy right now, and $5000 richer. 

I was texting my friend James when I heard it. There was a sudden thud against my window. Now, this would have normally freaked me out, but I was waiting for some company that day, so I just assumed that my friends were there. I turned around to face the glass, completely expecting to see one of my buddies, clad in sports gear and with a nice box of cold ones. We were planning on watching the game today and just generally relaxing before I went off for the week. However, when I looked out the window, I didn’t see my friends, in fact, there wasn’t anyone out there at all. 

I got up and approached the glass to see if maybe they had been trying to scare me or pull some sort of spooky prank, but all I got was more of nothing. I had felt spooked, but at that point, I was almost certain there was no prank. 

“C’mon guys! I know you’re out there. The doors are unlocked, just come in already. I know you’re trying to freak me out, okay?” I said trying to convince myself that everything was as it should be. No response. I thought to myself, even If they were out there hiding, chances are they probably couldn’t hear me through the glass, so like an idiot, I opened the door, poked my head outside, and repeated myself.

“Come on, I know what’s going on, it's really not funny. Get in here, I think it’s starting.”
This time I got a response, which calmed me down for a moment.
    
“We’re here, no need to stress.” My friend said out of nowhere. I was happy to hear him speak. However, just as soon as I heard his voice, I realized where it was coming from. He wasn’t speaking from outside, his voice came from inside the house. 
    
“Drew? How did you get into my apartment? Hello?” I spoke with enough volume that anybody outside could have heard me. I was petrified as I returned my gaze to the living room. I expected to see him somewhere within the general area, but he wasn’t anywhere to be seen. I started to question myself and even half believed that I was going through some sort of episode. I remember a few years back, I had a conversation over the phone with a friend, only to find out that they had changed their number a week prior. 

I opened up my phone to see if any of the chat logs mentioned a party, and sure enough, there was nothing. I scrolled through the messages with Drew thinking that maybe we had talked since and I just couldn’t remember, only for the conversation to cap within a few pulls from my finger. That didn’t make any sense. I’ve been texting with this guy on and off every day for the last few months, so the chat should have been able to keep scrolling for at least a minute or two. I decided to skim through some of the texts as I walked through the hallway. 

I reached the door to my bedroom and gave a quick scan to see if my friend was hanging out in there. There was nobody, although, something was a little off. I couldn’t decide if everything was as I left it or not. The room didn’t seem very messy, yet it looked like it had perhaps been searched. At that moment I was sure that I was going through something mental. I pulled up my phone and tapped the call icon for Drew. The ringing seemed to have some sort of delay on it, because it almost sounded like the noise was playing twice, just slightly off. I turned down the call volume on my phone to make the annoying sound stop, but it didn’t. The ringing kept playing, yet it sounded…faraway. I instantly realized that the delay was Drews's phone, ringing from the living room.
   
 “What the fuck…Drew? How did you-” I cut myself off as I opened the door. When I stepped into the hallway, I saw him. He was walking from the living toward me. He looked a bit taller than I remember, or maybe I felt a bit shorter.
   
 “What were you doing in there? You’re missing the good parts, dude.” He said with a concerned look on his face. The way he stared at me at that moment made me doubt everything that just happened. Was it all just some vividly twisted memory? What was going on?
   
 “How did you- how’d you get in here?” I asked him with fear printed on my face.
  
  “Uh…you just told me to come in. Are you okay man? You don’t seem alright.” He responded with an assertive tone as if I was acting crazy. 
    
“But you weren’t there, nobody was. Nobody was out there, but I heard you behind me! You were in my fucking house!” I started to raise my voice at him, which is something that I had never done before. Drew and I were good friends, and normally I would never have been able to yell or scream at him, but I felt a wave of confusion and anxiety washing over me. 
   
 “Please, calm down! I have no clue what the hell you’re talking about. You and I just literally had a conversation about some house or something, remember? I’ve been here dude.” He raised some more questions in me that I just couldn’t answer. I couldn’t understand the premise of this sudden lapse of memory. In the past, I would have consistent symptoms of anxiety and depression before hallucinating, but I’ve felt perfectly fine all day. When I first heard that pounding against my window, I felt good. I was thinking my friends were finally here to keep me company, and I was excited to party and get wasted with them. This was completely abnormal. However, it wouldn’t be the first time I experienced a break under unknown circumstances, though, strange events like that were few and far between. I began to calm down and responded with some level of understanding.
 
   “I think I might be having some sort of episode or something. I’m sorry, I don’t wanna put you through this. I’m ruining the big day with my stupid bullshit.” I replied to him in a way as to ease his concerns. In the past, I’ve found that expressing some semblance of self-awareness during my episodes seems to ease people's concerns like they haven't completely lost faith in me. 
 
   “Don’t try to convince yourself that you’re okay, you’re fucked up.” He said suddenly, in a slow and collected tone. I didn’t understand what could have made him say something like that, well, not initially. 
 
   “W-what? How could you say something like that?” I asked him with a little bit of hurt in my voice. 
    
“You’re gonna be okay? Why wouldn’t I say something like that? I’m only trying to help, I don’t understand.” He said this in a way that seemed even more confused than I was. 
   
 “I- I thought you said something else, maybe.” I lost patience with myself at that point, I didn’t wanna say anything else that could cause some sort of issue between me and him.
 
   “Do you want me to call somebody?” He asked calmly.
   
 “No, no, it's good, really, I’m just having some problems I guess. Again, I’m sorry.” I said avoidantly. I then remembered that I was supposed to be having more friends over, and wondered why they hadn’t shown yet.
    
“Hey, so where is everybody?” I asked.
   
 “Huh?” He replied.
  
  “Where are the guys? The whole gang was supposed to be here with you, what happened?” I repeated my question in another way.
  
  “Oh, uh..yeah. I think they just didn’t wanna come, maybe? Yeah, they said that they had some changes in their schedules.” He responded like he didn’t initially know what to think. Maybe he was just being a little forgetful, I thought to myself. 
   
 “Hm, well. That really sucks. I was looking forward to them showing up. Should I call them?” I asked him. Looking back now, I think that I may have been testing him.
   
 “No, no. You shouldn’t, they’re probably very busy with their plans and wouldn’t wanna be disturbed. Just…come over and watch the game with me. That's why I’m here, right?” 
   
 “Yeah, for sure, man,” I replied relatively slowly but tried to sound as agreeable as I possibly could. I just didn’t wanna stir the pot, or psyche myself out anymore. We began to walk back when I noticed the back of his shirt. There was dirt lightly smeared across his shoulder. It was hard to notice but not invisible, especially from that close.
    
“There's some dirt on your shoulder, were you at the family farm before you came over?” I expected him to say something along the lines of What family farm? We don’t have one of those, but what I got instead shocked me.
    “Uh, yeah. I was just helping out in the field. It's tough work, but it helps to build character, ya’ know? Besides, you can’t leave family hanging, right?” He smiled back at me for a moment then chuckled. His family has never owned a farm.

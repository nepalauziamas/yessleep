This is a continuation/update thread for the previous thread found below, in which I thought I captured something on camera I only ever used to see during my sleep paralysis episodes in my teenage years:

Firstly, Thanks so much guys. Since my first post went live - I have recieved so many helpful comments and private messages. I read each and every single one of them, but didn't have the time to reply to every single one, so I'm really sorry about that guys. Thanks for the great feedback and handy ideas.

**Current Situation/Update**
---
*To summarise the last week: Things were relatively okay up until yesterday, and I need some advice.* 

I will give a timeline of events of the past week (give or take) below. Now, I'll say it again - I'm not the best writer - so please bear with me.

When I took the snapchat video last week and put it on here, I was fairly distressed. I particularly worried by some of the edits and enhancements by the /r/nosleep community (see comments in the post). In my opinion, something (whether animal, human or otherwise) was out there, and I'm still very shaken up. The day after uploading I took your advice and ended up showing my partner both the videos and the /r/nosleep post. She was reasonably freaked out given my past sleep paralysis- but explained that at the end of the day - it really could have been anything. She also bought up the logical fact that we have been here for a little while, and nothing has happened.

In the few days after posting, I kept receiving great advice, and the major thing I took on board was that if someone was out there (casing my house to rob me) - I needed to have proper proof if they ever did while I was home. I repurposed an old phone (Galaxy S3) to become a camera only, and I make sure it is always charged. I also made a mental note that when it is unavoidable to be here alone (most Friday and Saturday nights) that all doors are locked and all curtains where applicable are closed over. I have the direct line to the local police saved as a contact in my phone, and I have looked into a priest (even though I'm a sceptic) in the area.

From last Saturday when I took the snapchat videos until thursday, things were fine. I hadn't seen or heard anything out of the ordinary except for a motion sensor light turning on out the back sporadically at night (unsure if this is normal, or whether I was hypersensitive). The fear was basically fading and I was going to update you guys here at nosleep tomorrow and basically bore you all to death with a story of nothingness... Unfortunately I would have liked that much better than the current reality.

On Thursday night. I had my first paralysis episode in roughly a year. I went to bed at roughly 10pm next to my partner, and awoke sometime around 3.30am facing the back of her head. I couldn't move at all, and started to panic as the window was just past her head at the other side of the bed. I didn't see anyone looking into the window (THANK GOD), but I did feel the dread that comes with an episode, and felt like a presence was with us in the room that something was standing behind us (not uncommon). As soon as I came to, I woke her up hyperventilating, in an empty room of course - and got to sleep by 5.

I woke up on Friday and went to work. Nothing was out of the ordinary. I will say however, that the whole day I somewhat dreaded being home alone that night, as it was the first night I would be alone since i filmed those snapchats last week. I can't just go out every Friday and Saturday night until midnight just to avoid the house though, so I was trying to not be too concerned. On Friday night, my parents left the house around 7.00pm, and my partner left the house at around 8.30, as she works at a club. Things were great and I just started playing some games with some friends on steam. This went on for a couple of hours, until at around 10.15pm, when some shit went down... 

I started to hear some relatively loud banging (I could hear it even though I had a headset on) coming from outside the screen door (the door in the snapchat videos). It was definitely something scraping or banging around out there on the back pavers. I stayed silent, and carefully took the headset of my head. I got up off my chair, took the phone I keep constantly charged and started filming just in front of the door.

**[HERE IS THE RAW VIDEO I TOOK](https://youtu.be/hgAliCZfmTc)**
---
***Sorry about shaky cam, I was looking at where I was going, not at screen.***

***Sounds are much better in 1080p for whatever reason.***

**Breakdown of video:**
---
When I started filming, the noises immediately got louder and more frequent (bad/good timing). I didn't want to open the curtains in case someone was right outside the door in the dark (absolutely fuck that). So I walked through the kitchen into the laundry and turned the outside lights on. The only way in or out of the backyard is down the left side of the house, so as soon as the back lights were on, I walked over to a window on the left side of the house that looks out at the only easy escape route. At this point something LOUD occurred from outside the opposite end of the house (right side - kitchen window). This scared the absolute shit out of me, so I circled the house to stay out of the light and filmed that window from distance for a couple of seconds. I then turned the internal light on in the kitchen, and filmed out the back kitchen window for a few more seconds. I couldn't see anything at all. I stopped recording. 

**After the video:**
---
Nothing happened after what you see in the video. I didn't call the cops. I didn't go outside. I kept all lights in the house on and stayed away from all windows until my parents got home at around 11pm. My partner got home at around midnight. I told her about what happened, but not my parents. She was pretty freaked out.

**Advice/help**
---
I now feel very, very uneasy and think that I'm being fucked with in one way or another. Seeing as though so many people took the time to trawl through the other post and make edits - can I ask you guys at nosleep to please help me out and tell me what you think those sounds could be and whether or not you saw anything outside that I did not. I know the video is vertical and crap, but I don't own any video/audio editing software, and wouldn't be sure what to do even if I did. If I get any tangible proof that someone was fucking around outside, I'm taking it and my snapchat videos to the police. If anything is found I'll link it here in the main post.

Thanks a lot!

**MAJOR UPDATE**
---

/u/abblecarbon posted a [comment right here](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/3rvk4l/updatepart_2_took_a_snapchat_for_my_friends/cwrr7fx) that included [this enhanced section of the video](http://gfycat.com/HandyUnrulyGrouse). The big mass in the corner is not meant to be there. As abblecarbon also pointed out, that figure is not there at the end of the video: [here is the picture he/she linked](https://i.imgur.com/I3CeCXZ.jpg) . I can see that area from where I'm FUCKING SITTING right now. How did whatever that was get out of the room. I was standing in front of it for a good 15 seconds??? [Here is a pic I took as we were leaving of of that area](http://imgur.com/9XPz7If)

*Is that a fucking person? Can anyone please confirm?* 

I showed my partner, she agrees we should leave for the night. We don't feel comfortable being here. We are packing our things to go to a motel tonight and will be monitoring and replying to this thread via phone/tablet the best we can. Tomorrow I'm handing this, the snapchat and anything else I can to the police. Can people please enhance whatever the fuck they can please?!

**EDITS**
---
**EDIT 1:** 

Thread is about to be locked. Someone shared private information. Send anything you have by PM. Thanks! Why can't people just be nice?

**EDIT 2:** 

Police have been called, and are going to meet me at the house in 3 hours (2pm AUS time).

**EDIT 3**

Police came, nothing is out of the ordinary and all doors are locked from the inside (my partner and I got out via remote garage door last night). [I took this video of the house at day for general layout](https://youtu.be/eKlvgNwiV0g).

The police took a report, and were irked by the video, but have nothing PHYSICAL to go on at this stage. They are keeping in touch.

**EDIT 4**

We are staying in a motel again tonight. Nothing happened last night. We have been offered by close friends to stay at their house for a while until this all blows over, and we will be from tomorrow night. We will come back here tomorrow, and I'll try to get an update away if I have time between packing. I'll keep responding to PM's as best I can.

Thanks guys.

FINAL EDIT
---
I'm fine. My partner and I are staying at our friends house until the end of the working week. I've been really slack replying to PM's, but I have been so busy it's not funny.

Nothing has been stolen from the house (that we can see), and the birds are fine. The police don't want me talking too much about everything (not sure if reddit counts), but they believe that a 2 man team tried to rob my parents while they were away. When one got in and realised I was home - his buddy tried to make noise to lure me outside and when it didn't work, he slipped out.  My problem with this theory is that all doors and windows were locked from the inside when they came. So how did these guys get in? The cops think maybe the one guy came in through the roof. This would mean that whoever slipped out behind me towards the end of my video had to slowly walk up the stairs (they creak/thud if you don't) and go into my parents room and climb into my roof all while I was right under them. I'm still freaking the fuck out. My first set of videos with this one is leaving me in tatters.

We're going to stay here with my friends until the end of the work week, go to my Nan's house 1 hour away to see our dogs on Saturday, and then discuss whether or not we'll go back to my parents or not. Monetarily, we can't really afford not to.

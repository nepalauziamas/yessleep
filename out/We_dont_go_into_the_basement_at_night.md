So, I’ll try to keep this relatively short. My wife and I sold our first house to capitalize on the housing market and use the windfall to payoff our student loans and the car etc. 

After a year of renting at an insanely high price per month we decided we wanted to buy again. We found an old house in the old part of town. When I say old, I mean old. This house was built in 1883 which makes it 140 years old next year. Single storey, three bedroom one bathroom. We were the only bid on the house, which considering the market right now.. was very hard to believe but regardless the house was ours and my wife, myself and our daughter moved in. 

The house was covered in crosses all over the main level. Not being Christian, we removed these. 
At first it was what it was, an old house comes with old problems but it was nothing we couldn’t handle. It wasn’t until we found the door to the basement that everything changed. 

The basement was hand dug out with poured cement and carpeting and divided into two sections separated by a wall and door. The first section was carpeted and what I call ‘presentation ready’ - it’s the area you’d show company. From this first area you could access the hydro panel and have room for storage. The area beyond the door was about as different as you could get, bare concrete floor, strange writing on the walls, false wall panels etc. 

If I had a choice, I’d stay out of there entirely but it’s how you get to the water heater and the furnace so, I went down regularly. 

While I was downstairs one day working in the first part of the basement I heard a strange noise from beyond the partition. Thinking it was the furnace, I went to check it out. Entering the second area, I walked past the strange writing on the walls to the furnace when I noticed a strange, small door built into the wall. 

The only thing we knew about the previous owners was that the family had owned the house for one hundred years and were known in the neighbourhood as being very strange and kept entirely to themselves. 

Opening the door I found a small stone statue of a tall figure wearing tattered robes, a hood covering his face and horrific tentacles coming from under. The noise happened again and I dropped the statue out of shock and it broke on the floor. Inside the opening was a bunch of old yellowed papers and books. I didn’t want to touch anything else so I left and went upstairs. 

That night after the sun set , we heard rumbling in the basement and we swore we heard something growling. The next morning I went downstairs and found the walls covered with a symbol I didn’t recognize and I grew afraid. We hired someone to come out and look at it. 

The hired hand went downstairs and never came back. I don’t know how to explain it, the partition door closed behind him , locked and the noise came again and when he started screaming I pryed the door open but he was gone and the statue was back in place and whole again. 

We don’t know if it was the removal of the crosses that brought them back into our world. We’ve become devoted servants because we have no choice, to keep our family safe, I send offerings down to the beast or whatever it is and it leaves us alone. I’ve taken to displaying the statue upstairs and I’ve read the books. I know what the sign is and I know who the statue is but I cannot write it here. 

You can come over and I’d be happy to tell you. It’ll have to be at night, when the stars are right and carcosa calls and you can see my basement for yourself.

But first, I’m curious.. have you seen the yellow sign?

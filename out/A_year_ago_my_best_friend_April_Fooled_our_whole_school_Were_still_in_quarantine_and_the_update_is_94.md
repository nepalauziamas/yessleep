[A year ago I was so sure that what I had was mine.](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/tx7x6s/its_been_a_year_since_my_best_friend_april_fooled/) 

My life. Seventeen years of existence. Seventeen years of mistakes and achievements—hopes and dreams of the future, dwelling on the past. Crying and laughing, anger and pain, happiness, helplessness, anxiety and depression—joy and disdain.  Every time I screamed, every time I laughed until my chest hurt. It was all beautifully mine.

[As of 5 minutes ago, the update at Blackwood Academy hit 94%.](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/u2xxra/a_year_ago_my_best_friend_april_fooled_our_whole/) 

But I’m not going to talk about the present. I need to tell you who started all of this, right?

03/20/21:

>Hey, can you do me a favour?

>It depends what it is, young man.

> So, first of all, I'm not stupid. I know my dad is working on something big. I don't care about that. I want something that can make you sleep. Like sleep, sleep. And I know he’s got something in that secret office of his.

>Are you aware of your condition, Mr Mycroft?

>Yes. Come on, it’s just for school. It’s for April Fool’s Day.

>I believe there are several prototypes. However, I don't think your father would approve.

>??? Dad is literally building shit capable of ending the world? I doubt he'd care about a prank.

>Right. Well, I suggest you perform this "prank" through someone else. Unless you want to alert your father.

>Duh. I’ve got a pretty good idea of how I can do it.

>But if there are complications… Are you prepared to deal with them?

>Oh my god, chill out. It'll be hilarious. You’re worse than my dad.

>Of course. I'll send it through. Good Luck.

>Sweet. I owe you one.

After reading the first few messages sent between Jasper and an unknown recipient, I closed the laptop. There were more of them.

I could see them on the screen. But at that moment, I didn’t want to read them—not when my hands were still shaking.  That’s what I was holding onto. I knew I wasn’t falling into that bottomless pit Rory had promised, because I was still feeling pain for him—anger at myself for leading him to that fate. I wouldn’t read his private messages yet.

Not when I could still see him. I could still feel him, his trembling body against mine- I could still hear his screams rattling in my skull, begging and begging and begging to die, pleading and sobbing and gulping through breaths that were growing more and more hysterical in his throat. I revelled in that image of him in my head. Pain. He had been in pain—and it showed in his face, in his wild eyes and twisted lips.

I held onto that. The agony clinging to him, real emotions not yet twisted and purged.

It had been so human. So him. So Jasper. The boy who had pulled the parasite from my head. I saw him before Rory turned him. His screams gritted through clenched teeth, eyes squeezed shut and tears streaming down his cheeks as more tendrils entered the back of his head, taking his brain into a vice grip and squeezing—squeezing until he let go. Until his wails became whimpers and his body fell limp against mine. I was still thinking of his last words. “My laptop. Do you hear me? It’s all on my laptop, everything. Everything you need to know – it’s on there.” Jasper let out another howl like an animal.

“Say it! My laptop!”

“Your laptop.” I squeaked. “But you’re going to get out of here!”

He sent me a sickly look. “I’m not getting out of here, Mara.”

No, I had thought dizzily, as Rory’s cronies grabbed and shoved me out of the room.

He couldn’t be the one responsible for this.

When I got back to the classroom and had barricaded the doors, I refused to believe that what I had left behind was him; the boy curled into a ball on prickly carpet stained claret, giggling into his arms, his whole body rattling with the force of his hysterical laughter, sputtering on blood between his lips as he tore into his own fingers like an animal, a predatory grin splitting his mouth apart. I didn’t see his eyes so I couldn’t confirm they were derelict like Joey’s. But his expression told me everything I needed to know; the crown of tendrils still wrapped around his head forcing him to submit.

Like Rory, like Joey—everyone in that room.

And I was alone.

I was alone with nothing but the secret Rory had forced from his lips.

What she did to Jasper had pushed me so close to the brink. I no longer saw daylight. I didn't think. And when I did think I fantasised about ripping myself apart so I would match him. His way of thinking.

So I could see him again-- so I could see if he was truly gone. 

And that would be my tipping point.

Still though. I had to keep going. I had to hold on. But what was there to hold onto?

Rory, my psycho best friend? Jasper, who had been turned into a mindless shell of his former self?

I had no choice but to go back to the messages. I had to know if he was worth shattering over.  

04/03/2021:

>What did you give me? It didn’t make them sleep, it fucked with their heads! How do I reverse this? Is there a way to stop it? Please, you have to help us! I’m scared! I don’t know what to do!

>They’re dead, Oliver. They’re dead. Oh god, I killed them. I did this. What did you give me?!

04/07/2021:

>Are you ignoring me? Why aren’t you responding? I NEED HELP. KIDS ARE DYING. KIDS ARE DEAD, AND I DON’T KNOW WHAT TO DO. I’ve locked myself in a classroom but they’re trying to get in. The screams aren’t stopping. I think I’m losing my mind. I think I’m losing my fucking mind. The connection is messing up, I don’t even know if these are getting through. Are you getting these messages?

08/04/2021:

>We’re still alive. There are some of us that are still alive. You need to get us out of here.

>Dad is coming, right? You’re coming. I know you are.

There weren’t any more written messages after that, only voice clips sent weeks after.

I clicked the first one hesitantly, wincing when Jasper’s voice came rushing through the laptop’s speakers tangled in static. “Shit. Okay, I can do this.” He exhaled. “Since you’re not replying to my messages, I figured I’d do this instead.” Jasper cleared his throat. “The sound quality is bad because this is a shitty laptop, but hopefully you can hear me. Anyway, to anyone who’s listening—whether that’s in a court, years from now when I’ll probably be dead—or hey, maybe you’re listening, dad, all snug and safe in your office. My name is Jasper Mycroft, I’m sixteen years old, and I started this.”

His words sent my heart into my throat, but then Jasper laughed. “Is that what you wanted me to say, dad? You’re not replying to my messages and that makes sense, I guess. You’ve either abandoned us out of fear of the unknown, of what’s inside here—or this is your idea of the perfect punishment.”

Jasper paused, and I could hear movement, the sounds of light footsteps, creaks under floorboards. He was recording the message from the classroom I was standing in. “Huh. So you’re building a fence outside. I’m on the upper floor so I can just about see your workers.” He let out an exaggerated sigh.

“Cutting us off from the outside world. Well, I don’t blame you. Things have gotten pretttyyy crazy in here.” Jasper went silent for a moment. He lowered his voice, and it was the first time I heard vulnerability in his tone—fear. Even when he was crumbling apart at the mercy of Rory and the thing inside his head, he’d kept that sardonic bite. “So, is there a reason why you haven’t come to get me?”

Jasper’s voice broke around the last word. “You want to yell at me. Sure, I was the one to give the thing to Aurora Michelson and broadcast it, but I didn’t think it would…I didn’t think it would do this, dad. I just wanted to make them sleep. It was just—”  

His breath hitched, and I could sense Jasper struggling to keep it together, clenching his fists, fingernails stabbing half-moons into his palms. He laughed, but it was more of a sob. “It was just a stupid fucking prank, and now they’re all dead. My classmates are dead in the hallways. Mrs Jones tried to rip out my eyes, and I’ve been waiting for you to come and get us all of here, but I was wrong. You’re not coming to save us. You’re locking us away like we never existed in the first place.”

Jasper’s voice rose into a yell. “It’s been twenty-eight days, dad! Twenty-eight fucking days. Something is happening. The kids who didn’t die, I think they’re turning into something, and I’m scared of them. I keep asking myself if it’s my fault. I fell apart. I mean, how could I not? There’s no point denying I didn’t do this.” I could sense his gulps for breath, for oxygen, a panic attack rumbling in his chest. 

“Initially, I just wanted to fucking die. I wanted to join them because this was all me. This was all my planning, all my research. I was the one who did this, right? I was the sick bastard who decided to play god, play human nature, and got played instead.” 

A sharp breath and he caught himself again.

“No. Wait, that’s not true, is it? No, of course not! Because this was all you! I’ve been alone for so long, and it’s got me thinking, you know? It’s got me wondering about a lot of things, dad.”

Jasper was crying, I realised. Every word he struggled to keep together. I sensed his teeth gritted, tears staining his cheeks. Real, proper pain and anger burning inside him. But he pushed through, his words tangling together. “ I’ve spent the last few days asking myself why. Why would daddy dearest do this? Mrs Eaton, she— she went crazy. So I had to, right? I had to bash her brains in or she’d kill me….”

He sniffled, and I heard every individual breath. “This is enough for you to come forward, right? Save us?”

He choked out a laugh. “Nah. You’re a coward. You’re sitting back and watching the show—watching your little rats scurry around. That’s what we are, right? Are you doing to them what you did to me? Because I know they’re not your first rats. I know what you did despite the lengths you took to keep me in the dark.” Another breath. This one sounded relieved. 

“Remember my 14th birthday? You got me the new Call Of Duty game. I thought it was a birthday present, but you never got me gifts. It was always mom.  Instead, it was to keep my mouth shut, wasn’t it? Because of what I found in your office. And I know I wasn’t alone, dad. There were others too.”

Something cold slithered down my spine.

“Others you took away.” Jasper continued. “You stripped them from my mind like it was child’s play.”

I imagined Jasper’s smile, his dark eyes as he spoke.

“Yeah. I bet I’ve caught your attention now. Are you sweating, dad? Are my words making you feel uncomfortable? Well, listen to me sing like a canary.”

Jasper paused. “You see, throughout my life, I’ve had memory blanks. I mean, my whole brain is practically swiss cheese. I thought it was because of my condition. That’s what Doctor Oliver said, right? Narcolepsy can fuck with my memory and make me sleep. I lost hours of my day, people I’d spoken to and conversations I’d never get back. Which I never questioned.  What I do remember is my 14th birthday. When you took me home and treated me to a giant chocolate. You watched me wash it down with a milkshake, and then you told me I needed to sleep. The world started spinning, and you told me it was just my condition. And after that day, everything has been a confusing blur. Like I’m dreaming.”

Jasper sighed, his breath rattling the microphone. “You told me to trust you and I did. I didn’t question anything because I didn’t have to. You’re my dad, why would I? And yet you left me clinging onto maybe six or seven hours of consciousness every day—waiting for it to happen again. It’s like my body was shutting down. There was no warning. No dizziness. I’m aware and trying to force myself to watch TV, and the next second I’m waking up minutes, hours, sometimes a whole day, after. Wasting away, dad. Rotting.” Jasper chuckled. “In a way, I was no different to the freaks outside trying to kill me.”

He hummed. “Which leads me to my biggest question. Where did my condition go, dad? You know, the condition I’m supposed to have for the rest of my life. Since the outbreak, I’m miraculously cured. I haven’t passed out once.  So this is your mercy, right? Did you make me immune to this? You turned my classmates into mindless freaks, and saved me?” 

His voice cracked. “What you did to me when I was fourteen, is that what was leading to all of this? Because I was your first rat, right? I know your intention wasn’t to make a fucking Walking Dead knock off, so what was your original plan?”

A pause and Jasper laughed again. 

“It’s not like you’ll tell me. I’m talking to a brick wall. I’ve been talking to myself for months. Why am I even bothering? You’re doing what you always do. Abandoning me and making me suffer. Except for some ungodly reason, you’ve dragged Blackwood into this.” He hissed out. “Fuck this, I’m done.”

Something told me he wanted to continue, but he couldn’t.

“Anyway. Fuck Doctor Oliver, fuck your stupid fucking experiments, and I swear to god, dad, when and if I turn into one of those things, and I hope to god I do, I will happily rip out your throat with absolutely no remorse, and I think that’s beautiful. A sight to be seen, right? Your own son—“ He coughed. “Sorry. Lab rat— being the cause of your downfall. And maybe even the cause of the end of the world.” He scoffed. “I’ll never know what you did to me, but I’m okay with that. I’m glad you messed with my memories. Because I’m pretty sure if I did ever remember, it would send me riiiight off the edge.”

The recording was coming to an end.

“What was your goal? Is this it? Turning my school into your own personal playground?”

There was a crashing sound---what sounded like Jasper shoving a desk or a chair over.

“Have fun running away from your failed experiments. See you around.”

The recording ended, though they didn’t end there.

I clicked the next one, this time a few days later.

Jasper sounded like his usual self again. “I’m back. Uh, yeah. So, things are happening, and I’d have to be crazy not to record all this. You don’t want to hear my life story, and I’m not going to give it. I’m done with my sympathy show. I watched the video again this morning. Nothing happened, so my dad was successful. I’m safe from his thing.  There's some kind of update on everyone's phone currently at 2%. No idea what it's leading to, but it's freaking me out. Who knows, maybe it’s turning us into cellphones.”

He laughed, and it was a real, genuine laugh.

Now I understood Jasper when he said he’d been alone for a whole year—no wonder he was laughing, the dude was slowly losing his mind.

“Anyway, I’ve got to go. There aren’t too many freaks outside, so I’m going to make a run for it. I will say, though, that something is changing. It’s been happening for a while. I think—now, I might sound crazy—but I think there’s a different type of freak. There are the totally mindless ones, you know like Don’t Dead Open Inside, zombies..” 

Jasper trailed off, taking a breath. “And then there are these ones. I think these guys are intelligent. They still have their brains. Well, that’s going a little far. What I mean is they’re not mindlessly chewing on kids’ remains. They’re like The Dead Breakfast Club. Unlike the freaks, it looks like they have actual logical thought.”

The small pause made me wonder if Jasper was lost in thought for a moment.

“Anyway, I’m going to try and cure this thing. I’m not much of a scientist, but hey, I’ll try. The kids who haven’t gone full freak travel in packs and talk to each other. I heard them laughing this morning. Like, actual laughter. Not zombie laughter.” He paused. “Can zombies laugh? I’ve seen pretty much every zombie TV show and movie, and zombies do not laugh. Have you ever seen a laughing zombie?”

His usual attitude made me smile.

Click. I stabbed the touchpad, starting the next recording.

“A lot to report today. I’ve officially come up with a name for it. The SUU virus—because why not name it after the meme.  Also, I was right. It’s not just the freaks. There are kids affected by the SUU virus, but they don’t turn. Well, they do, but it’s different. It’s like they’re not even zombified, they’ve just gone completely nuts. I’ve seen them die. I mean, I saw Issac Tate fall to his death on that first day when everything happened.  I saw him last night chewing on some kid’s legs, literally chatting with Joey Summers like normal. I think something is growing on them, or at least glueing them back together."

I thought back to Connor Marlow. 

"It’s freaky. Issacs’s head had clearly been, I don’t even know, put back together? Is that even possible? Is the virus fixing them? They’re fucking insane. And not even in a zombie way. They’re fully aware of the shit they’re doing. Earlier, I saw a girl drag another kid up like four flights of stairs.”

Jasper’s words brought foggy memories blooming back into focus.

“I followed them and kept my distance. The girl seemed conscious. And I mean awake. Like, she was aware of what she was doing.  She slammed this other girl, maybe a freshman, onto a desk and tied her legs and arms down—and then…” Jasper hissed out a breath. “Fuck. I don’t—I don’t know how to say it. This crazy bitch sliced open the girl’s stomach, like her actual guts, and kept the freshman alive. It’s like she enjoyed it.” His voice shuddered. “She…she enjoyed causing the girl pain. I’ve never seen anything like it before. The girl was pushing the freshman to grab a medical saw and plunge it into—"

I tapped pause, my breath in my throat.

I knew exactly what Jasper was talking about. He was describing what I did to Alexa Blake.

Dragging the voice recording forwards, I focused on the rest of the message.

“This is seriously fucked up, man. These kids are more dangerous than the freaks. It’s like the SUU virus affected them, but also didn’t? I mean, it definitely fucked with their head, but it didn’t turn them into zombies. It did something even worse.” 

I already knew what he was going to say. 

“It’s made… psychopaths. I’m talking crazy out of their minds psychopaths that seem to get high off of pain. They also, like the freaks, react to electricity. Like phones, lights, TVs—anything electronical, they seem to be able to control it. Now I’m not saying this virus is evolving to learn literal electrokinesis, but that’s exactly what I’m saying.” Jasper sputtered. 

“This is actually happening, right? Am I dealing with a sentient virus that isn’t just learning through its hosts, but making a whole new species out of the kids it couldn’t turn?”

With shaking hands, I tapped on the next recording.

This time Jasper was breathing heavily. But he wasn’t scared. He was—excited.

This time he wasn’t alone. I could hear rattling, hissing, what sounded like giggles. 

My gaze went to the empty desk with the shackles bound to the legs.

“I got one! Not a freak. I got a conscious one, and I was right. They’re not zombies at all. They’re like me—except something has been zapped in their head. They have normal speech patterns, though also have the capabilities of a freak, which means they’re crazy fast. I managed to get this one in the back of the head—that seems to be their weak spot. He was alone, which was unusual. They usually roam in groups, hunting down survivors.”

“Jasppeerrrr!” A boy’s voice rattled through the microphone.

“Shut up,” Jasper told the boy. “Come on, dude. No matter how hard you try, you’re not going to eat my fingers.”

The boy laughed. “You’re scared, Jasper. Scaredy cat! Scaredy cat!”

“Subject one.” Jasper ignored the kid. “Luke Aisling.”

“Why don’t you tell me why you’re scared?” Luke droned. “Come on, spit it out! Spit it out!”

“Talk to me, Luke,” Jasper murmured. “What is this thing, huh? What is it doing to you?”

“Are you going to cut me open?” Luke giggled. “Do it! Please, do it! Cut me open! Cut me open, and I’ll shut up, I promise. See? I’m closing my mouttthhh! I’m not going to speak! Do it, Jasper! Do it!”

“Wow.” Jasper whistled. “You really are driving the crazy train.”

He sighed. “As you can see, well, hear—this one is pretty vocal. See? They have speech as I said. I’ve watched them hang out. They talk to each other like normal, but they’re fucking gone in the head. Like they’ve left on the one-way train to Loopyville, gone. The key similarities between them and the freaks are that they still eat kids. They kill. They’re fast. This one is intact, but like others, it’s like this mould that’s taken over the school, all over the walls, it’s mending them. Like, whatever happened to them, injuries, getting their heads smashed in and their guts pulled out—- it’s fixing them like glue.”

Jasper’s voice faded in and out, and I could hear clattering, as he seemed to be sorting through instruments. “Oh, and from my first initial look at the subject, I think this thing has evolved into a physical thing in his head. I’m going to do observations. Just give me a minute to get ready.”

The next voice recording started playing.

“First observations, there’s definitely something inside him. The subject is being an asshole, so I’m going to wait for a while. I’m starting to think this thing goes to sleep at night. At least, that’s what I gather from their behaviour. It’s weird. It’s like this thing is taking care of the host. Didn’t expect that.”

The next few recordings sounded like failed attempts, mostly a Jasper and Luke back and forth.

Finally, one that lasted over five minutes.

“Okay. So, this thing-- this virus is evolving. Fast.  It’s a root that’s inside his brain. It took me a while to figure out, but it seems this thing leaves the brain at night and wraps itself around the spinal cord while the host sleeps. Luke is currently out of it. I wanted to hit him over the head—after enduring him singing for three hours, but the virus did my job for me. it’s like the virus told him to so it could explore. I think if I cut into the neck, or at the very back of his neck, I’ll be able to at least get a glance.”

Jasper was talking so fast, so convoluted, but it was excitement. He was horrified and scared and baffled by the thing—but from the sound of his voice, he was excited to study it, to understand it.

“This thing is like, I don’t know—an octopus? So, in theory, it should show through the incision.  I’m going to try and get it out. I’ve seen YouTube videos, it can’t be that hard, right? All I have to do is make an incision and—- oh fuck. I’m squeamish. No, I can do this. I can do this. It’s just… BBQ sauce. No, ketchup. Yep. That’s what it is. Ketchup. Just a little ketchup, and definitely not this guy’s blood.”

Jasper laughed again, and I found myself smiling. “Oh man, I’m so out of my depth right now. I’m sixteen years old, I have no idea what the fuck I’m talking about. I don’t even know where to start!”

Still muttering to himself, it sounded like Jasper had started the procedure. I heard the light clink of a scalpel hitting something metal and Jasper’s hiss. “There we go,” He breathed. “Nice and easy.”

He went silent for a moment, before letting out a sharp breath.

“Okay, um, firstly, I’ve never seen anything like this. I’ve made an incision, and—yes! I can see it! Oh wow, you’re a little fucker, aren’t you? Jesus, this thing is strong! I think it’s trying to grab my scalpel.”

Jasper cried out suddenly, and a crash sounded.

“Uh, it looks like I woke it up. I think the host is going into shock. Hey, dude, can you hear me? The subject—the subject is bleeding from the ears. I don’t know what to do… I don’t know what to—hey, Luke? Luke, hold on for me, okay? Luke!”

A sound, like a pop.

Silence. Heavy breathing. “There’s… there’s blood everywhere. It’s all over my hands. My… my shirt. He’s everywhere.  Luke. He’s dead. This thing— it killed him. I thought I could get it out. Just give me… give me a second…” There was a pause before he continued, his voice almost a childish whimper.

“Subject one. Luke Oliver. Failed. It seems to know what I’m trying to do, and as soon as it knows it’s under threat, it nukes the kids’ brain. This bastard really said if I can’t have you, nobody can. I’ve scraped what’s left of it from Luke, but the thing is dead. I don’t think it can survive outside a host.”

Jasper let out a sigh. “Maybe I’m going crazy, but it almost looks like the SUU virus targeted its victims, picking and choosing who to fully infect, and who to turn into a psycho. Which means this thing is intelligent. Again, It’s just a theory, and I was never good at bio. But I swear this thing knows who and who not to infect. There are around 20 kids who didn’t fully turn, who instead evolved with the virus. This thing scares me, sure. The speed of its ability to learn and evolve. But it really is incredible.”

He went silent for a moment.

"Are these psychos because of you, dad? You fucked around with my head, that's obvious. But did you do this to anyone else? Is that why a certain number of kids haven't gone zombie?” He choked out a laugh. “Is this what you wanted to create and were instead screwed over by your own creation?”

The following voice messages weren’t important until the last few.

Most of them were Jasper failing to save our classmates.

The next voice recording: "So, this is surprising. I got one out. I actually got one out! Subject eighteen is currently stable and it looks like she’s waking up soon. Upon extracting the SUU virus in its physical form, I think it died at the bottom of the Coke can. Which is a sad way to go, huh. Dying in a Coke can.”

He chuckled, and I could sense his excitement. “Wait. I think she’s waking up! Fingers crossed she’s got her mind back!”

The next recording was two days later. 

Hesitantly, I clicked on it.

“Good morning! Subject 18, also Mara, is good. Well, she was good until she ran off with her gang. If she comes back and shows any signs of whatever she was, I'll kill her. Sounds brutal, but I know what these kids are capable of, and she was part of them.” 

He cleared his throat. “On a lighter note, we studied one of the kids in stasis today—and the SUU virus has a new form. It’s like a, I don’t know, a centipede? I pulled one right out of a kid’s ear. As the update climbs, it looks like it’s changing them. But I’m optimistic for the first time! I actually have someone to talk to, and I’m learning more and more about this thing. I’m going to cure it. If I can figure out how this virus works, I wonder if there’s a way to reverse the effects. It worked with Mara, right?”

That was his last message.

Before I led him to his death.

There was so much I wanted to ask him, and I couldn’t. I wanted to ask him about his father. Had he really created the virus, and why? And then there were the questions I didn’t want to ask. Jasper had heavily implied his condition had been a side effect of whatever his father had done to him.—and because of that, he was immune to the virus. But he wasn’t, I thought.

When I left him, he was infected. A thought came to mind, however. When Rory forced us to watch the video, it hadn’t affected him. So, she’d used a different tactic. Her words echoed in my mind, and my gut twisted. “If the video isn't working on you and I can’t incite an external reaction, how about an internal one?”

So, Jasper hadn’t been infected. Instead, his brain had been physically forced to submit.

The thought should have made me feel sick, but the fog was coming back, and I was smiling.

I was smiling at the thought of twisted vines squeezing his brain in a vice grip, eliminating all logical thought. I started laughing then. I don’t know why. I was filled with anger and pain and sadness for him, but I was choking on gulps of hysterical laughter. This is what Rory wanted. She wanted me to fall. She wanted me to plunge myself further and further into the dark and thinking about Jasper—about those tendrils and vines wrapped around him, suffocating his thoughts and forcing him into a psychotic mindset was doing just that. I was still laughing, giggling to myself when a bleep sounded.

After squinting at the screen, I realised that there was a new message at the bottom of the chat.

>This is a message for Jasper Mycroft. Are you there? This is an encrypted server, all messages will disappear in five seconds.

My chest ached, but the pain was good. It made me feel—good.

Jasper had been crying out for a year, begging for help, and he was ignored.

And now the outside world wanted to talk?

The keyboard in front of me was blurry and I struggled to type.

>He isn’t here. My name is Mara. Hello.

A reply came a second after I hit send:

>Mara Delaney? Can you tell me the current situation at Blackwood Academy?

>Depends :) Are you Jasper’s father?

>No, I am not. I was the one who supplied Jasper with the unidentified virus currently on your premises. I am an associate of Mr Mycroft.

>Cool. Can you get us out of here?

>Young lady, where is Jasper?

>Infected, brainwashed—tendrils sticking out of his head. Happened a few days ago. What I want to know is why you’ve abandoned a school full of children.

> I cannot disclose information about that.

>Then I can’t disclose information on Jasper.

>Fine. Right now, it is impossible for us to reach you due to the health and safety protocols put in place.

>Uh-huh. So in other words, you're cowards.

> Tell me Jasper Mycroft's status.

>He's not here mentally anymore. 

>Did Jasper watch the infected video?

>Yes.

>Did it affect him?

>Obviously.

>I see. So, there is an internal influence instead of infection. You mentioned "tendrils sticking out of his head"-- that appears to have been done with brute force. By stimulating the pleasure and pain points in his brain, it would have been effective in corrupting his mental state and taking hold.  Miss Delaney, I want you to listen to me very carefully. I can help you. Me. Not the people I work for.

>Nah, I'm good.

I kept typing, thrilled with the idea of destroying my only hope of getting out-- watching it splinter into tiny pieces I couldn't put back together. After all that time. Jasper's cries were ignored, and now they were messaging us. Now they wanted to give a fuck. It was almost funny how ironic that was.

Destroy it. I could hear singing in my head, and I was reaching for it, grasping hold, ready to throw it against the wall.

>Miss Delaney, I suggest you read what I am telling you very carefully. Years of research have led up to this moment. Without the sacrifices we made in the past, we would not have the ability and resources to reverse what has been done. I need you to tell me. Is Jasper Mycroft passed saving?

I thought about that, lowering the laptop. 

I could see through the fog.

He was alive, sure. The vines in his head were probably doing a lot of damage, but it's not like he cared.

>Tell me what you mean by reverse, and then we'll talk.

There was a pause before he replied.

>After looking over Jasper's findings, I'm certain the corruption is in the frontal lobe. If I can get some actual readings from their brains, and a sample of live virus I may be able to help them. I am the one who supplied Jasper with the virus. However, my intention was not to continue the project. It was to save you.

>Save us?

>Yes. Altering the prototype, however, was a grave mistake.

My mind cleared, and suddenly the keyboard wasn't swimming in my vision. What he was saying grounded me to reality—back to pain. I could feel it exploding in my body, what I’d done to myself.

>What?

>Miss Delaney, Project Spindle was purely intentional. However, we were not expecting the virus to gain sentience. On April 1st, 2021, a test group of students were supposed to be exposed to what we simply called Prototype C.

The purpose of the experiment was to, well, to put it in simple terms-- we wanted to see if we could drastically change a person's personality, change the way they think completely. Due to the success in experiments years before, we were confident. I stand by my words.

It is inhumane what we were doing, and I thought it was right to put a stop to it and supplied an oblivious Jasper Mycroft with an altered version-- one which had not been peer sampled, the one which unfortunately gained abilities beyond our comprehension. Prototype C was not stable and we should have known that. If I could speak unprofessionally, I was quite desperate to stop Mr Mycroft.

My thoughts whirred.

Reality, believe it or not, is so much better when you’re not thinking clearly.

Because when I was, when I was gathering my thoughts, I started to question things I had overlooked.

>You know my name. How?

He knew my name, I thought.

How did he know my name?

>I can help you, Miss Delaney. Tell me. Are Aurora Michaelson and Jasper Mycroft alive?

>Yes. But they’re infected.

>No, they are not. There are things I want to tell you, Miss Delaney, but right now we act fast. You must capture them at once. The answer to understanding and destroying this virus is inside of them.

But how? I typed. How the hell am I supposed to--

The laptop went black, suddenly, fizzling, before the screen exploded.

"Boring."

A familiar voice sang from behind me.

"Honestly, you'd think Doctor Oliver would at least try to lie. Sugar-coat it. He's been doing it most of my life. That's the great thing about remembering. I got to remember all the bad stuff dad did to me.”

Something slammed into the back of my skull.

“Bullseye!” Jasper’s voice rang in my skull, rattling static in my ears.

Nuclear pain exploded, and I hit the desk face-first.

The asshole knocked me out.

It didn’t take me long to wake up. I was tied to a chair, vines and tendrils wrapped around my legs and arms, pinning me down. The classroom was dark, though something was being projected on the wall in front of me. 

Not Rory’s video, I thought, dizzily. Instead, it looked like old footage. Lifting my head, I was relieved to feel actual pain the way humans should feel it—not whatever Rory had twisted it into. I straightened up in the chair, squinting at the screen. I was staring at what looked like a doctor’s office. White walls and ceiling. A little girl was sitting on an observation bed, kicking her legs.

The sight of her sent my heart into my throat.

I recognised her pigtails, the sleeping beauty dress she insisted on wearing.

Rory.

“Can I go back to the party?” She asked, her eyes wide. “Joey’s going to eat my cake.”

“No, Aurora. Let’s try this again,” A voice grunted. 

A man appeared, a youngish looking guy wearing glasses and a scowl. He placed two things in front of Rory. A teddy bear and a knife.

“Tell me what you feel when I do this.” The man murmured, before stabbing the teddy bear.

Rory reeled back with a cry. “Stop! You’re hurting him!”

The man cleared his throat. 

“Do you hear crying, Aurora?”

“No.”

He broke out into a smile. “Well, that’s because he likes it.”

“Really?” She whispered, her eyes widening. “Teddy...likes it? But my mommy—”

“Forget about what your mommy said.” He said sternly. “It makes him very happy.” The man held out the knife to her, and her gaze zeroed in on the blade. “Do you want to try?”

Rory leaned back. “I don’t like knives.”

“Okay. Well, what do you want to use?”

The girl giggled, pointing. “Can I use my book?”

He handed her the sleeping beauty book I knew all too well; what she had used, later on, to kill my cat. Rory lifted the book with both hands and slammed it down on the teddy bear. When she looked at the man, he nodded, and she did it again, giggling. “He likes it!” She squeaked. “He likes it! He likes it!"

She beat the toy until it slipped off of the bed.

The man cleared his throat. "Aurora. Tell me what the princess pricked her finger on."

Rory turned back to the camera, her cheeks bright red, eyes glittering. "The spindle!"

"And did it hurt?"

"No! She liked it!”

He paused. “What did she like, Aurora?”

"Pain!" 

The screen flickered, and I was met with a different room. The colours were brighter, a more modern picture. This time I was staring at my younger self.

I was maybe three or four years younger, fourteen or fifteen. I was at the awkward phase where I didn’t know what to do with my hair and my attempt at winged eyeliner. But what stood out to me was that I wasn’t alone. On my right, a younger Connor Marlow, and on my left, Joey Summer’s. Both of them squeezing my hands for dear life. But I didn’t remember this. I would have. I mean, I would have remembered being that close to the two of them.

But that couldn’t be right.

Rory—she was making me see things that weren’t real.

She was messing with my head.

“Well?” That same man’s voice off-camera. “Don’t be shy. What do you want?”

The three of us exchanged glances.

“Your son,” Connor said, his eyes dark. “Where is he?”

“And Rory,” I spoke up, my voice shaking. “You did something to them. We’re not stupid.”

The man sighed. “Like I said yesterday, you’re delusional. Jasper is sick. As for Aurora, I do not know.”

“Yeah, I’m calling bullshit.” Joey said, “How about you tell us where they are, or we start talking about—what was it called again?”

“Project Spindle.” I  said. “Jasper doesn’t have Narcolepsy. It’s all you.”

“Ahh.” The man hummed. “So, that was you in my office the other day.”

“Who cares?” Connor spoke up. “Tell us where they are. Or we’re going to the police. I’m sure they’d be interested in knowing why you’re obsessed with us. That’s some pretty significant jail time, man.”

I could tell by the expressions on our faces suddenly, that Connor had hit a chord.

Connor leaned back, and Joey lost the spark in his eyes.

I looked like I’d regretted ever speaking up.

“I’ll have to stop you there,” The man’s voice was calm, but I could sense panic. “First of all, as his father, I will say this is nothing to do with you. You break into my office and start blurting delusional remarks—"

I wanted to see more, but the images on the screen scrambled, the audio cutting off.

I was so enraptured by the footage, I didn’t notice a shadow bleed across the screen, bringing me back to the classroom. Jasper. His head was completely taken over with vines and tendrils wrapped around his head. I could see they were already starting the conversion. Instead of internally, however, a thick mould was growing on his face. He ducked in front of me, a shell of his former self. When I struggled, he grabbed my hands, piercing them to the armrest with a pencil. My body jolted, but it didn’t hurt.

Instead of crying out, I hissed through my teeth, and his lips broke out into a psychotic grin.

Jasper leaned closer. He smelled like rot and filth, the aroma choking the back of my throat.

His eyes, the eyes I’d been afraid to look into—were exactly what I’d feared.

Emptied, apart from something alive, something slithering behind irises.

“Do you know what the best part of falling is?"

“How is Rory doing that?” I gestured to the footage. “How is she making me see this?”

Jasper’s gaze didn’t stray from me. “Answer my question, Mara. What’s the best part of falling?”

"Hitting the ground?" I swallowed hard. “That’s what she turned you into. That’s what you want.”

He rolled his eyes. "I mean metaphorically, idiot. I mean falling-- plunging into the dark. Letting go. You know, poetic shit like that.”

"You mean losing your mind," I whispered.

Jasper pouted. "Potato, Poh-ta-to. Who cares? Anyway, What I'm trying to tell you is, the best part of falling? Losing yourself?" He knelt in front of me, and I could tell by the gleam in his eyes he wasn't finished tormenting me. Oh no, he was just getting started.

His smile grew like it flooded with him ecstasy at the thought of uttering the next words slipping from his mouth. "Remembering.”

Hit a word count. I’ll be back.

94% and counting.

So close to 100% and I have no idea what’s coming.

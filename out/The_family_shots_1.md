(I’m a young story teller and maker please give me advice)

It was a normal day. I was taking a shower at about 9:35PM. I turn the water on medium heat because I didn’t feel like having a hot shower. I first clean my face and use my acne cream, then I clean my body. I grab the shampoo and of course wash my hair like normal. I just finished and was about to get out. I hear 3 shots. I knew who got hit , my mom , my dad, my brother. I knew when I left the shower I was next. This made my bones shake I was just stunted. I’ve seen many crime story’s before and their was 2 ways this could end. I die or live. Little did I know there was a 3rd.

 I decided to put my ear to the door, but the shower was too loud to hear anything. Before I went back in the shower I locked the door. Many things passed through my head, “how do I survive?” “Can I even survive?” Only me and my sister was left. My worst fear came true, I lost my family. Then I had a thought what if it was from my parents show, because they have watched many shows with guns mostly my dad, but the noise, how loud it was and how close it sounded it was way too real for it to be fake. I turn the shower off then put my ear to the door again. I hear my parents so I felt calmer because it was just from their show, but it still felt too real and it kind felt like there was another person, I figured it was my fight or flee response. What was actually going on was that the person said to my family that they could pretend the shots was from their show, he only wanted me, at least that’s what I told my self and it didn’t help it made me mad at my family. Little did I know some how my parents were communicating how to save me is what I told my self to help me calm down because I was ready to pounce and if someone was there it wouldn’t end well. I got dressed but still thinking what if the shots were real or fake what if what I told my self was real and my family just “hated” me but was trying to save me. I hear a pounding on the door, my heart felt like it was going to jump out of my chest, I went down to the fetal position then silence. It was too quite like dead quiet. I decided to accept my fate and open the door. I open the door and walk out, my parents were watching tv, nothing happened. 

A couple days later I was walking by the tv it had the news on it. I heard something that made me turn to it. “Family gets attacked by a killer.” I knew exactly what they were talking about. What I said and what happened was real.

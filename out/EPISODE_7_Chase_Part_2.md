The next day, Clarissa gave me a new task. A high cryptid appeared in India. It was a CR-Basilisk. I don’t think that I’ve mentioned or explained CR-Basilisks before. They are a bit rarer cryptid so I didn’t think that there was a need for that. In fact, this was the first time I was sent to hunt one. Judging by the name, you’d probably assume that it’s some sort of a snake, and you wouldn’t be too far off. It's more akin to blue-tongued skinks. A bit fatter body, wide head, and small legs. Its body is much longer compared to its width in contrast to the skink. Though short for its size, its legs are very strong and instead of having four, CR-Basilisks have eight. They have a strong bite, hard and thick scales, and spikes pointing backward on its head.  

They have long and wide tongues that they can shoot out of their mouth. Its spit is very sticky and is used for hunting. It’s too small to swallow humans whole but it is very capable of tearing pieces of flesh off of you. They can also do death rolls just like crocodiles. The size they usually grow up to be is from 23 to 25 feet. They usually dig burrows and are insanely territorial.  

There are a few other things I want to mention before I start talking about my little trip to India. CR-Basilisk is drawn by bright red light so we are given a flare gun with three flares. The second thing I wanted to say is that there’s another new part of my equipment. A grappling hook. It’s made of the same dark metal our weapons are made of... well... the hook part of it. The rope connected to it is thin and made of very strong material.  

Now back to the hunt. I was left just outside a town where the sighting of the cryptid was reported. Instead of spending my nights in a hotel in the town, I decided to spend my nights in the rainforests. It might sound stupid to do so because it’s a rainforest after all. However, the presence of a cryptid usually drives the animals away. It’s almost like every single cryptid had this supernatural aura that animals can sense. We humans can too, but it’s much weaker than animals. In Equilibrium, we assume that’s due to the fact that we believe that we are the apex predator and, in that way, we turn off that ‘sixth sense. That’s also why cryptids usually attack humans more than animals. Don’t get me wrong, they still hunt animals, but it’s so much easier for them to hunt us instead. 

I found a small clearing where there was just enough space for a tent and a campfire. It didn’t take me long to set it all up. When I was done, I decided to take a look at the surrounding area. I set up a few cameras and baits. I set up six of them and connected them to a laptop that I’d check in the tent. I strapped them to trees at the height of about six feet. When it started getting dark, I decided to return to the camp. I got back while I could still see and decided to put up a camera in front of my tent. Instead of putting a bait in front of it, I put up a bear trap. It was just outside the entrance to my tent. I thought that that was the best position due to the fact that there was a cliff behind my tent. I put that camera on a pole that I jammed into the ground. It allowed the camera to turn 360 degrees.  

I got into the tent and turned on the laptop. I opened the camera screens and started the waiting game. None of the cameras reported movement for a long time and the boredom made me fall asleep. I woke when the sun was already up, but the time on the laptop showed me that it was somehow still very early. The programs that we use for the cameras keep the logs whenever the camera catches some movement. It also saves the entire footage. That night, the cameras didn’t catch anything interesting. Three of them did capture some leaves moving, but it was clearly due to wind. I guess I didn’t have luck the first night.  

After I woke up, I cooked some coffee and hot dogs at the campfire. After that, I checked the surrounding area once more. I still had three cameras left so I wanted to find good places where to put them up. I decided to find a way to climb up the cliff behind my tent and put the cameras there because I had nothing in that direction. I managed to find perfect places for the cameras. One was on a rock just on the edge of the cliff. It allowed me to see a huge area on each side. I found a hole in the rock into which I managed to jam a pole with a camera. The other two positions were a bit further away.  

It was about Noon when I’ve done so and I returned to the camp to get something to eat. I didn’t care to check the cameras because I thought nothing would have happened during the day. I took some steak that I put into a minifridge in the tent. I had some bread as well and it was enough for me. After I was finished, I decided to go check the area where I already checked the first day. However, I chose to avoid the parts that I can see from the cameras. Once more, despite spending half a day on it, I haven’t found anything and returned to the camp disappointed. It was a bit later than the day before so I could barely see where I was going when I got back.  

I could still see the outlines of trees and the tent, but it was all kind of merging together. I got into the tent and turned the laptop on. I turned on the program to look at the cameras and connect the three new ones when I noticed something unexpected. One of the cameras only showed static. A mixture of a chaotic merging of black, dark grey, and white lines. It was camera number 6. I set it up to your left while you’d be looking away from the entrance.  

“What the...” I whispered.  

I couldn’t go check it now because it was too dark. But I could take a look at the footage. As I said, the program saves it. First, I checked the logs. The camera noticed movement at 10:37 AM.  

“This must be the CR-Basilisk,” I thought to myself.  

I found where the program stored the footage and opened it up. I fast-forwarded the footage to 10:35 AM and excitedly waited to see the cryptid appear on the screen and destroy the camera. However, it didn’t. Instead, I just saw a camera suddenly falling from the tree and burying itself in the mud below the tree. I heard rustling and steps of a heavier creature. Then I heard the cracking of the wood and the camera started slowly closing to the ground. The camera hit the ground and there was a loud thud. The camera didn’t break immediately. The screen just showed total darkness. Then there were another two footsteps. One on the ground and one on wood. I could hear the tree moving and the camera slowly sank under the mud.  

This left me without words. CR-Basilisks are strong, but not that strong. There’s no such living thing in this world, at least out of those that we know of, that could do something like that. The tree I attached the camera to was a big one. Not even the CR-Yeti with all its strength could break it off. To be honest, CR-Wendigo and CR-Skunk ape could maybe do it slowly over time by cutting it with its claws. But if it was one of those two, I would have heard them cutting it down. And even then, neither of those would do something like that. They are smart, but they can’t understand technology. Also, behavior like that was never seen nor described when it comes to any cryptid. This was more than just strange.  

“It must be a new cryptid,” I thought to myself.  

Hell, not even great cryptids could do something like that no matter how much stronger they are or how much sharper and bigger their claws were.  

“I need to go check the tree,” I whispered to myself. “But I should do it in the morning. It’s too dangerous to do it now.”  

I decided to wait and check the cameras that are still put up. I went outside to put out the campfire. The silence made me feel uneasy. The only thing scarier than hearing a twig snapping in the woods is hearing nothing. There are always sounds of animals in the forests. And in this case, in the rainforest, there should have been much more noise. But there wasn’t.  

It wasn’t any better when it came to the lighting. The huge trees and their canopies prevented the light of the Moon and the stars from reaching the ground. So, the only source of light was the campfire and the light from it barely reached the tree line. I could only see the small portion of the tree barks so anything behind was just pure darkness. Just like the footage on the broken camera.  

I walked up to the campfire and picked up one of the sticks that were laying on the floor next to it. I started to poke the flame with the intention to separate the wood in the campfire. Before I did anything else, I took a look at the tree line. Instead of being met with pure and total darkness, I saw two larger dots about six feet in the air. They were jet black, but the fire refracted from them so they looked like they were glowing orange.  

“Fuck,” I shouted jumping backward.  

The dots didn’t move. They stayed at the same place and the fire continued to dance in the dots. It didn’t take me long to realize that those were eyes. I stood there looking over the fire at the thing that was staring back at me. I didn’t know what to do at first. I just kept standing there and looking into the darkness. There was still no noise and I wondered whether that was the creature that took down the tree. I can’t imagine something that’s only six feet tall taking down such a big tree producing barely any sound. Only footsteps.  

I realized that the thing wasn’t going to move for a long time so the best thing to do would be to slowly return to the tent and check the camera I put up in front of the tent. I took a step backward, but the eyes didn’t move. I continued to walk slowly and quietly back to my tent. My instinct was first to check the cameras in night vision mode and to call Clarissa after that. After a minute or so, I felt my back touching the tent cloth. I slowly bent down and crawled into the tent.  

Suddenly, I heard the sound of something large hitting the air fast. When I took a look at the camera, I realized I didn’t put it in the night vision mode. I quickly used the touchpad to move the cursor at the night vision button and pressed it. But by the time it changed, there was nothing there. The bushes where the creature was before were shaking and I noticed that the campfire got put out. Some of the branches even flew out of the small area surrounded by stones. I took a flashlight that I left next to my sleeping bag, turned it on, and pointed it towards the shaking bushes.  

I saw just as much as I saw on the camera. I shined the flashlight to the left and to the right to check if there was something there. I didn't see anything but the trees and darkness. At first, I contemplated going there to check for any footprints or marks on the trees. Before I did so, I shined my flashlight towards the top of the trees to check if there were some marks there. There weren’t. I stepped out of the tent and looked around once more, but I haven’t seen anything.  

The entire night, I sat in my tent holding my sword in my arms and looking at the entrance of the tent. Paranoia took me over and I couldn’t fall asleep. From what I’ve written before, it might seem like I wasn’t scared of cryptids anymore, but that isn’t true. I don’t think that it’s possible not to be afraid of cryptids. They can easily wipe you off of the face of the Earth and can be malicious and psychotic just like humans. That’s another scary part. We are told that we are the only smart species capable of understanding higher concepts, but we aren’t. Cryptids are smart.  

And this one seemed like a very smart one. It knew that the cameras had night vision. The idea that it got scared of me entering the tent is simply idiotic. After some time, I realized that it could have probably killed me already if it wanted to. However, I still was still scared and unsure if exiting the tent is exactly safe. I was sitting in the tent looking at the footage from the laptop.  

Only when the sunlight started to reach the tent, I stepped outside. I looked towards the place where I saw the eyes last night. I immediately noticed a large broken branch from a nearby tree. It was hanging from the trunk. I saw something in the dirt there. I walked up to check what it was. I walked carefully because there was a possibility that the cryptid was hiding somewhere nearby. When I got to the place, I saw two footprints on the ground. They were... like that of a parrot, but much much bigger than those of the largest species of parrot. The fingers were also wider in proportion with much larger claws that are most definitely used for hunting.  

They were unlike anything that I’ve ever seen. I mean, there’s no cryptid that resembles a huge parrot. There does exist a CR-Thunderbird but it’s nowhere near the size that these footprints would suggest it to be. And the CR-Thunderbird is more akin to birds of prey like a hawk. This... this was something else. Something bigger, something more dangerous... something new.  

I still had some coffee from the day before so I drank all of it. I haven’t slept the entire night so I needed a lot of it. After that, I set off on a small expedition. I decided to walk a bit further away from where I’d been before. When I reached one of the cameras, I stopped for a bit to take a rest. It was about 5 miles away from the tent. Surprisingly, I felt like l was completely alone. If that cryptid saw me as prey, it would be following me constantly and I’d feel its presence.  

The camera I walked up to was the one that was broken. The tree didn’t seem like something cut it down, but like something hit it hard and broke it. I also found some blood and the same footprints I found near the tent. Alongside that, there was a long but very shallow hole in the ground. It was about an inch deep at its deepest part, at least 20 feet long and 6 feet wide.  

After checking out the area, I continued to walk. About a mile further, I started to hear the sound of a waterfall and decided to follow it. I struggled to pass through the bushes and wished that I brought a machete because a great sword is of no use here. It’s just too big. After receiving quite a few cuts, I managed to fight my way out of the bushes. As soon as I looked up, my eyes were met with a lake. It was a beautiful location. There were huge cliffs on the opposite side of the lake and to my left. To my right, there were no cliffs. The waterfall was absolutely huge. The cliff from which it was falling was at least 100 feet tall. I noticed a large cave on the bottom of the cliff. I couldn’t really see it properly. I just saw a large hole in the stone filled with darkness.  

I took in a deep breath and smiled. However, the smile was wiped off of my face as soon as I looked to my left. Half-submerged into the water and half on the shore near some small plants laid a body of a CR-Basilisk. It was dead. It was missing almost all of the flesh around its ribs. Its stomach was gone as well. It was just the head and legs still connected with a spine. Half of the ribs were broken as well. Something did this. Something very dangerous. Whatever the thing that killed it was, I know that it threw the CR-Basilisk into the tree with the camera. The CR-Basilisk hit the tree with its ribs and they shattered. It fell onto the ground leaving that shallow hole. I assumed that the hit also shattered its heart and that it died right then and there.  

I was checking out the corpse when I heard the sound of wings clapping. IT was identical to the sound I heard the night before while the creature was leaving. I jumped to the side into some bushes so that I wouldn’t see myself. There was an opening just big enough for my eyes to perfectly see the lake. I saw a creature landing in the water as it made large waves from the power of its wings. They were large and insanely strong. Also, they were bat-like. Four fingers were connected with the skin. There was a fifth finger, but it was much much smaller than the rest and was positioned on the top of the wings.  

The creature had no feathers or fur. It had scales. It was another reptilian. Apart from its wings, it only had two other limbs. Two long and muscular legs that ended in parrot-like feet. I was able to see the feet before they landed and stuck them into the water below them. Its chest was large and muscular. Just like birds, it had pectoral muscles that enabled it to fly. A long neck that resembled a snake was attached to its chest. It was long and bent in the shape of the letter S. Its head looked like a crocodile’s head. As soon as it landed, it shoved its head into the water and quickly pulled it out with a large fish inside its strong jaws. Its tail was similar to that of a crocodile as well.  

“It’s a fucking dragon,” I thought to myself.  

Well, technically, it was a wyvern since its only limbs were its wings and legs. It was 10 feet tall at the place where its wings were attached to its body. Its neck must have been 8 feet long and the rest of its body was about 50 feet long. I knew it was insanely strong due to its big muscles. I mean, it had to be. It needed to be able to lift itself into the air and while a bigger muscle mass makes you heavier, it also makes you stronger.  

I was looking at the thing through the leaves of the bush. It was a new cryptid. One was never seen before that moment. At least not in the modern age. I was careful to not make any sound and alert the creature while it was devouring that fish. With only one bite, the fish stopped moving. This creature must have had an insanely strong bite. After the fish was dead, it threw it into the air and caught it. It started to swallow the fish whole. After it was gone, it lowered its snout down until it was only about 6 inches away from the surface. It was looking for fish.  

I started to load my crossbow in case it attacked me. The process we have to go through when discovering a new cryptid is a bit complicated. We need to call our handlers and inform them of the discovery. Our handler will send in more hunters to help us take the cryptid captive. If we are not able to capture it, we have to kill it. All that takes about two days because the reinforcements have to arrive. And after that, we have to find the cryptid. But that’s only the field part of the process. There’s much more to it back at the facility.  

I decided to get away from there and call Clarissa, my team’s handler, and ask for reinforcements. But before I could, the creature quickly turned its head towards me. I stumbled backward but still made very little noise. I hoped that it didn’t see me.  

“I know that you’re there,” a female voice came from in front of me. “You can come out.”  

The voice was composed of a few different voices. The main one, the loudest, was a deeper female voice. There were two higher but much more quiet ones accompanying the deeper one. However, they didn’t sound like talking. They sounded like singing. There was also an insanely deep voice that sounded more like thunder than a voice.  

“Please, come out,” it said.  

I left the bush and stepped over the carcass of the CR-Basilisk. I kept my left arm at the cryptid. With the crossbow attached to my left arm, I aimed just where I thought its heart would be. The creature lifted its neck and head back up. I didn’t know whether it was to intimidate me or show me its greatness. Its upper body was lifted a bit above the lower part but it seemed like it was the creature’s natural position. Its neck bent like the letter S and it was looking straight into my eyes. Its head was standing at a height of at least 15 feet. The thing was enormous. It was about 40 feet away and I still had to look up to look into its eyes.  

“Don’t be afraid,” it said with the mixture of its voices... but its mouth didn’t move. “I mean you no harm, human.”  

It took a step forward and I got startled. I mean this was a clearly extremely dangerous creature that could shred me to pieces in a matter of seconds. And because of that, I shot out the bolt out of my crossbow. The creature didn’t even flinch. The bolt hit it in its chest, but instead of piercing the skin, it bounced off of its scales and fell into the water below.  

“Your weapons won’t work, human,” it said.  

At that moment, I realized that the voice wasn’t coming from the creature but from my mind. It was using telepathy to communicate with me.  

“I am not of this world, just like Thorog’nar,” it told me. “The one desire to kill so much.”  

“Thorog’nar...” I whispered.  

It was CR-Phantom's true name.  

“What are you?” I asked it.  

“For you, humans, I am a dragon,” it replied. “For myself, I’m something else. Something most of you won’t be able to comprehend.”  

“How do you know of CR-Phantom?” I asked.  

“And that would be?”  

“Thorog’nar,” I said. “That’s how we... well those who know of its existence call it.”  

“We are from the same world,” it told me.  

“Are you working together?” I asked putting my hand on the handle of my sword.  

“Do you think that I’d keep you alive if I were, Damien?” it asked.  

“How do you know my name?”  

“Telepathy,” it replied. “I can learn some things from it. It’s not only for communication.”  

“I...” I was just about to say something when the creature cut me off.  

“Keith,” it said. “Your real name is Keith.”  

I froze for a minute. I just kept looking at the creature and it waited for my response.  

“I... I haven’t heard that name in years,” I said.  

“I know what Thorog’nar did to you,” it told me. “I know what it did to your friends.”  

I just kept looking at it.  

“I’m hunting him,” the creature said. “He did terrible things to me too and I will never be able to forgive him. I can only kill him.”  

I wanted to switch the topic as soon as possible. I didn’t want to talk about my dead friends.  

“What are you doing here?” I asked it.  

“We are stuck,” the creature replied.  

“Stuck?”  

“Yes, stuck,” it said. “We came into this world. Thorog’nar to take it for his master and me to protect it.”  

“Came how?” I asked.  

“There are those that you call...” it stopped for a second reading my mind. “Velvet outsiders. They are minions of Thorog’nar’s master. He is able to control them with his mind, but he let go of the control over them in this world.”  

“Why?” I asked.  

“Because another world resisted. When he let go, Velvet outsiders closed the portals towards the master’s world and got rid of his control,” the cryptid told me. “Since then, these creatures have been traveling to other worlds, but none of them went to the world already conquered by their master.”  

After hearing that, I immediately remembered Allan’s machine. He was using it to reach other worlds. He was opening the gates to them... and there was the possibility that he could open the gates to a world he shouldn’t.  

“But why didn’t your master get other CR-Velvet outsiders to make portals to this world?”  

“He’s not my master,” the creature replied. “And those who you call Velvet outsiders sealed off this world and many others. They are keeping it hidden from their master, but not protected.”  

“Well... that’s not good,” I said.  

“You speak the truth human,” the creature said. “Let me introduce myself. My name is Akl’adak.”  

“Damie...” I stopped. “Keith. But you already know that.”  

“I do,” she replied. “I also sense that you have something else to ask me. I know what it is, but if you want the answer, you’ll have to ask me directly.”  

“How do I kill Thorog’nar?” I asked.  

“Eyes,” she replied. “You have to pierce every single of its eyes.”  

“Can it heal them?” I asked.  

“Fortunately, no,” she replied. “Why do you ask?”  

“I already stabbed him in one of his eyes when I met him for the first time,” I answered.  

“That’s probably why you managed to survive. If it wasn’t for that, you would’ve died.”  

“I got lucky,” I replied.  

“Or faith guided you,” she said.  

“Yeah... I don’t believe in that kind of stuff.”  

“You should,” she replied. “I fear that I’ll have to leave you now. I got rid of that abomination for you. It was turned by Thorog’nar.”  

“We guessed.”  

“We?”  

“I’m a part of a secret organization that deals with things like that,” I said pointing at the carcass of the CR-Basilisk.  

She looked at the carcass and then back at me. She spread her wing showing me all their might. Their wingspan must have been at least 50 feet long. The skin between them was thin and the sunlight made them a half see-through. I could see veins spreading through the skin. The color of it was darker orange and it contrasted with the black scales covering the rest of her body. The first swing of her wings pushed the air so hard I needed to cover my face so as to not get water in my eyes even from 40 feet away from her. The second swing almost took me off of my feet. It was easier from the third once since she was already a few feet above the ground. After a few other swings, I couldn’t feel the winds she created. When I moved my arm away from my face, I noticed large waves in the water. They were no ocean waves during a strong storm, but still large for the size of the lake.  

I was about to call Clarissa but remembered that I had to deal with the body of the CR-Basilisk. Yes, we have staff to deal with the bodies, but I planned to keep Akl’adak a secret. I didn’t want to tell anyone about her but there was a half-eaten body of another cryptid proving her existence. If the staff found the body, they’d know that another cryptid killed it. This meant that they’d know that I’m hiding something. They’d tell that to Allan’s guards and the information would reach Allan himself. Maybe it would be a good thing for him to know this because of the machine that was built. However, he probably wouldn’t believe me and would just kill me. So, I decided to cut off the CR-Basilisk's head and give it to the staff as proof while dumping the rest of the body into the lake and claim that there was no need to send the staff to clean it.  

After cutting off the head, the body wasn’t too heavy. Its tail and legs weren’t long so they didn’t hold as much muscle and fat as they could. It meant that it was a bit easier for me to drag it into the water. It was easier to get it to deeper water since it floated. I decided to swim to the shore and take some larger stones and tie it to the skeleton with some vines I found hanging off of the trees around the lake. It sank to the bottom of the lake after I tied a few of the stones.  

After the job was done, I informed Clarissa that I was finished. I told her that there was no need for sending the cleaners since the creature is hidden at the bottom of the lake. She was a bit confused, of course, but did as I said. She agreed to send only transport for me. When the conversation was over, I realized that I had no scars. It would be a bit suspicious if I had no injuries. It is a huge and highly aggressive creature after all. To keep the secret, I took out my hunting knife and cut myself in the biceps on my left arm. I left two scars. One larger and one smaller. After that, I washed the knife and decided to go back to the camp.  

By the time I got back to the camp, my transport was already there. Standing next to it was Myers. He was leaning onto the V3 and looking at the ground. When I stepped out into the small clearing, he noticed me and lifted his head.  

“Oh, hello Damien,” he smiled. “How was your hunt?”  

“Not that bad actually,” I replied. “Only two smaller injuries,” I said lifting up my sleeve and showing the scars.  

“Oh, boy. I wouldn’t call those small injuries. Some people died bleeding out from injuries of that size.”  

“Well, it’s not much for me. I guess I got used to it,” I told him.  

At this point, I was standing next to him and he immediately started to check my wound. He grabbed my arm and pulled it towards his face. After a second, he looked into my eyes with concern filling them up.  

“He knows,” I thought to myself.  

“Pack your equipment,” he told me. “Be quick. I still need to deal with those wounds.”  

I first brought the laptop into the V3 and then took the rest in. After gathering it all, I realized that I still had to gather the cameras I put up around the rainforest.  

“Wait, Myers,” I said. “I need to get the cameras. I put them up around the area.”  

“No need,” he replied. “The cleaners will deal with that.”  

“The cleaners?” I asked agitated. “I told Clarissa not to send them.”  

“Well, she did,” he said nodding to the left telling me to step to the side further away from the V3.  

We stopped about 10 feet away from the V3.  

“I’m not sure that she did,” Myers whispered. “I think someone else sent them.  

“What?” I asked.  

“She informed me that I’ll be the only one going, but when I went to board V3 there were two others with people dressed as cleaners. Clarissa didn’t send them, but someone did. That means that they heard your conversation with Clarissa. That’s why we stepped away. I’m sure that there’s a microphone in V3.”  

“You have any idea who it could be?” I asked.  

“Allan... maybe. I don’t know,” he answered. “But here’s the thing, someone who has the ability to overhear out conversations must be thinking that you’re hiding something to send the staff... And I think the same since those two are clearly wounds from your hunting knife,” he said taking a look at my left arm.  

“What should I do?”  

“If I was you, I’d ask like I’m stupid and like everything happened just like I said it did,” he answered.  

“I don’t think that it’ll trick Allan,” I told him. “It would probably work with his simple-minded...” I stopped for a second. “ ’Minions’. But there’s no way that he’d believe me.”  

“He won’t, but if you don’t tell him what happened, he’ll have a reason to keep you alive,” he said. “He’ll want the information and he’ll try to get it from you. However, he knows that you won’t tell him shit so if he kills you, he’ll lose a way to learn something that could be useful information. That's the best way you can do it and you should never, in no way tell anyone what actually happened here, not even me. If you do, you’ll put everyone in danger.”  

“I figured that,” I told him. “And I believe almost everyone realized how dangerous he is.”  

“You’re smart child,” Myers told me. “He hates you. You are a danger to him and he knows that you’d kill him without questioning your decision if you had to. If he taught like that of anyone else, he would have them killed already. There’s something more about you.”  

I chuckled.  

“And what would that be?” I asked.  

“I don’t know,” he answered.  

“I believe that you’re wrong,” I told him. “Allan definitely has his reasons, but I don’t believe I’m anything more than just a human like you or anyone else.”  

“Whatever you say,” he replied.  

We got into the V3 and returned to the UG-Crimson. Fortunately, Allan wasn’t waiting for me. It meant that either he wanted to hide the fact that he knew I was hiding something or he found out about the CR-Basilisk and was so mad he didn’t even want to talk. I immediately went back to my apartment and into my room. I fell onto the bed tired because I didn’t sleep on the hunt again. Just when I was about to fall asleep, I hear my phone buzz. I took the phone and checked the message that had just come. It was from Alex.  

“Tomorrow, 7 PM,” it said.  

It also stated the location and how I should present the information to the leader. He also mentioned that they call her Liberta which means freedom in Latin. I just let out a sigh and went back to sleep.

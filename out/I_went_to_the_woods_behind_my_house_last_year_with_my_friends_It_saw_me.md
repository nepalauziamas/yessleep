Last year I decided to have a girls day with my friends. This was during April of 2021, so we couldn’t do much but make some baked goods and sit around talking about work and school. 

I really wanted to visit the woods behind my house, so I originally planned to bring all the food we made to the woods and hang out there, but unfortunately when the day came it was just implausible. It was cold and supposed to rain. Plus it was a good 25 minute walk across a mucky, barren field so I thought it was best to have the food at my house and visit the woods afterwards. I feel it’s important to mention I’ve never actually been to the woods behind my house so I didn’t really know what to expect. I liked the spooky aspect of it, so I was really interested.

After snacks and chatting, my friends and I threw on whatever shoes I could find around my house that were suitable for walking across a field we hopped my fence and set off. Walking there was kind if unsettling and I was kind of scared that my friends and I would get the cops called on us for some reason. One of my friends, let’s call her B was getting a little scared and so was I, it just felt kind of… wrong what we were doing. I can’t explain that feeling, it’s like you just know something’s off. My other friends were goofing off while B and were pissing our pants.

When we finally got the woods I was kind of amazed. There was no clear path and it looked like no one had stepped foot in the woods for over 100 years. There was a huge tree that had fallen down and was covered in moss. It looked so untouched and beautiful, it was almost otherworldly. We didn’t go very far into the woods, maybe 30 metres (about 100 feet) in. Nothing felt off. 


After about 15 minutes we decided to head back as it was started to get dark out. As we walked, I started to get that uneasy feeling again, but I assumed it was because we were in the middle of an empty field surrounded my nothing but the forest behind us. B nudged me and pointed out a tree that looked a bit like a face and said she felt like something was watching us. I told her I did feel uneasy as well so let’s just go as quickly as we could back to my house.

After we made it back all was well. We chatted again for a couple more hours before everyone went home, and nothing felt off. Cue me writing this a year and a half later.

I haven’t been out much this summer, but last night there was a pretty sunset so I decided to sit at the edge of the pool and walk around my back yard. I decided to hop the back fence to look out at the field again for a bit of nostalgia.

 As I turned around to look out the field I noticed someone standing about 150 metres away from me. The person was dressed in brown and black and I thought it was my neighbour for a second, so I started to wave my hand at him, which I promptly stopped. The person was way taller then my neighbour, and even though my vision isn’t too good, the person was also ghostly pale. Now, I’m not totally stupid, instead of running up to the person I took my phone out and zoomed in to take a picture. I only took one before the person saw me and started walking towards me. Slowly. My camera on my phone stopped working and I climbed the fence as fast as I could. As I turned around to hop down into my yard. I saw its face. It looked like the tree B had pointed out last year, and it was less then 5 metres away from me. It was walking so slowly, I didn’t hear any running, how did it catch up to me so quickly? I backed away from the fence so quickly, I didn’t want to turn my back on the thing that was behind me. 

Then I heard it. Its voice was lower than a whisper, just barely audible and was coming from all directions, “One step every night since the woods. 20 steps if I see you.” 

I ran back inside to go tell my parents, but I didn’t know what to tell them. What if it saw them? What would it do? 

The only person I talked to was B. I sent her the picture only for her send me a question mark in response.

“There’s nothing in the picture?”

“What do you mean there’s something standing right there? I can see it!”

I clicked on the picture and zoomed in on it. How could she not see it? She was there with me that day?

Then it moved. In the picture.

Shit. I can *see* it.

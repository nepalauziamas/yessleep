&#x200B;

Before I get started, I am aware of Teresa’s shenanigans and I apologize for whatever she may have written. I would be more specific, but she forbids me to read her post. Even now she is staring over my shoulder as I type to be sure I don’t take a peek. She says “Hello fine friends, if you value your health you will keep our personal correspondence between us”. Lord knows what she is hiding but I hope she didn’t embarrass us too much. 

Although there is little more embarrassing than when I woke up. I remember nothing since I last posted. Teresa had to fill me in on what happened, so you can imagine my shock as I woke up.

“You live!” Before I could process the words, I was tackled by Teresa in a hug so tight a python would be jealous. 

“Are you alright? What do you feel? Please speak!” Teresa shook me violently with each question until I could catch enough breath to talk.

“Teresa? Why am I naked?” upon uttering the question Teresa’s face flushed bright red and she scooted a couple of steps back.

“You were injured again. Terribly wounded. Fatally wounded.” Her eyes stayed focused on my face as I tried to rearrange myself in a more concealed way. I looked around for something to cover myself with but unless I was going to hide behind the scales or inside a wall there was nothing to use. 

“Fatally? What do you mean? I recovered right? I am here, unless we both died and this is purgatory, in which case it’s not very fair you get clothes and I don’t.” I smile at my own joke but I see tears welling up in her eyes and she pulls me back into her again. 

“You were gone. I was so afraid that you would be gone forever. You were not healing, you were not breathing.” She sobs into my shoulder and I realize the gravity of the situation as I rub her back gently. I was gone. I had died? How did she…? I look down at the stone I lay upon and finally recognize the room I am in. The forge. It should have clicked with the scales, but there is no fire. I am where the fire once blazed.

“Did you… try to cremate me?” 

“NO!” Teresa’s grip tightened into the force of a black hole and I instantly regretted my question as I could feel fresh tears run down my back.

“I did not know what I could do! You had stopped breathing and human resuscitation techniques were not working! I thought since you bear my blood maybe my soul could take purchase within you. I bathed you in my eternal fire and you accepted it, or it accepted you. I do not know which is true, but either way, you became part of me and I am part of you.” I feel Teresa’s breath start to steady again as she composes herself.

“You saved me again.” I am at a loss for words. I owe Teresa my life so many times over I have lost count.

“Not without cost.” She whispers. She gently lets go of me again so that she can face me.

“Your humanity, it is more likely now that you are no longer human. I do not mean an extended lifespan and increased physical attributes either. Your very being has shifted. When you were embraced by the flames they burned away everything that was not you. Even dead parts of you were burned away, your hair, your nails. Yet, they have regrown at an unnatural rate for a human. I have shaved your face and trimmed your nails once every hour.” She raises her hand to my cheek and I instinctively feel my own chin. There is a slight stubble there already, I had shaved this morning. I know shaving with a knife is more difficult than a razor but I had gotten pretty good at getting it smoothe. I could feel my once short hair now touch the base of my neck.

“What does this mean?”

“I do not know. My only explanation would be that your body is adjusting to the new power it has received. It is overflowing with energy as it adjusts.” She gets close and stares directly into my eyes.

“Yet your mind and your eyes still remain yours. This is good. You should not transform wildly at the least.”

“Transform into what?” 

“A Trovanyr. Your new true form.” Teresa withdraws her hand and I notice her nails now ending in claws. Small scales encircle her fingers.

“It is difficult to change back your form. It takes time. If you were to transform I do not know if you would have enough mastery over your new powers to revert back.” She looks at her own hand and I can see the outermost layer of scales receding slowly back into her skin.

“So you’re saying I am Trovanyr now? How is that possible? You said that wasn’t how it worked before.”

“It was not. None have ever done what we have before. None have ever been unharmed by the flame before, except for others of my- our kin.”

“Our kin? You are sure about this, Teresa?” I stare into her eyes and Teresa gives it a moment of thought before winding up and striking me full force in my chest.

“Oww, Fuck Teresa! I’m not wearing any armor!” The realization dawns on me halfway through the sentence. She always told me I was not any more durable. I look up to see her eyes beginning to water again.

“I do not know if I made the correct choice. Please, tell me, did I? I did not want to be selfish, but I have grown to need you.” She was on the verge of tears again. I had never seen her so upset. It was my turn to pull Teresa back in for a hug.

“I think you did. I am glad to be with you still. I didn’t mean to cut it so close. I’m sorry Teresa, I won’t leave you. Never again. If it means even sacrificing my humanity, I will stay with you.” And so for a while we did stay, just like that. Holding each other until we both felt ready to move forward again.

She pulled back again and I broke the silence, thinking carefully how to word my questions so as to not upset her anymore.

“So how does this power thing work exactly?” Yes, that is really the best I could come up with.

“Our strength can be summoned upon when necessary, but the more you summon the harder it becomes to retain your human form. Along with that, emotion can amplify our strength, but as emotions do, they can make it harder to think clearly in combat. You will want to be cautious of rage and grief. Both are powerful emotions and if you were to get lost in them it would take an emotion filled with more power to release you from your frenzy. When I feel myself losing control I think upon my happy memories to regain my senses.”

“Happy memories, well I have plenty of those to rely on.” I smile at her which makes her beam back at me.

“Are you confident you do? With how much you sleep perhaps they are all dreams.” She pokes her finger into my side. 

“Hah! Well if they are dreams at least they are good ones.” I scootch to stand up and Teresa braces herself around my arms in case I fall. My feet hit the floor and I stand perfectly fine. 

“I feel good enough to walk. Let's go upstairs and see if I can find any clothing.” At the reminder that I still am stark naked Teresa quickly withdraws her hands and makes a focused effort to keep her eyes at face level. We go up the stairs and I search my bag, but I don’t have anything of use. We weren’t planning on spending the night camping on that fateful day, so I didn’t pack a spare set of clothes. At this point I was wishing Marcus was with us. He would have been the only one to think far enough ahead to pack an extra set of clothes in case one of us got dirty or wet. Jason would be good to have as well. With his size I could probably hide well enough just under his t-shirt. That is, after he had enough time to laugh at me. I guess no matter how much time passes, you never really stop missing your friends.

“Aha! I have an idea!” Teresa shouts, breaking me out of my thoughts. She comes running over, wrapping me in a blanket.

“The village never saw a reason to send me male clothing, but this was an immensely popular style of dressing not too long ago! It was called a Toga.” She wraps the blanket tightly around me then gives it a quick couple of tugs to make sure it is secure.

“It used to be worn by nobles and leaders where I once stayed. When I moved further north, I did not see it again however. I always enjoyed them, I do not understand how they seem to have fallen out of favor.” She steps back and admires her handiwork as I feel just slightly less exposed. 

“It’s wonderful. Thank you Teresa for your quick thinking!” I chuckle as I cautiously position myself to sit down. Teresa takes a seat next to me.

“So, back to business, what’s the plan?” I ask Teresa and she looks struck completely off guard. 

“Plan? How am I supposed to create a plan while I worry over you?” She says with a mix of sarcasm and seriousness.

“Right. Well, let’s come up with one then. What do you think is our best option?”

“Hm. We will not be able to hide much longer. The Underdwellers will be expanding their scope of search more and more as we wait. It is a miracle they have not stumbled upon my home yet.” 

“So we have to launch our offensive then. It should hopefully go a little bit better now that you don’t have to worry over me anymore right?”

“I will always continue to worry over you.” Teresa grips my hand as she says this.

“I know. I’m sorry, I didn’t mean.” I stutter.

“I have revived you from the brink of death twice, and the second time was a miracle that it was successful. There is nothing more I can do to bring you back if you get harmed again. There are no more second chances, I have no further cures to stave off the reaper.” She tightens the grip on my hand. “You must not be reckless with your life anymore. I have done all that I can. There is nothing more I can give.” Her eyes stare intensely into mine as she makes her point. I take these words to heart.

After a long silence Teresa speaks up again.

“Our target before was the powerplant. It is possible we may still be able to take it over. What we find there may lead us to our next point of interest.” I think about this, it seems like the only way we might be able to get some direction. Otherwise, we would simply be running into a random area with hopes of stumbling upon the Underdwellers. If we take too long, we will get worn out. We can’t fight forever. So that is our plan. We will be heading out now, if I get back I will tell you how it went. If we don’t make it back, this should send in 3 days.

Much like when I began this story, I don’t really know where to begin. I’m just going to tell you things as they happened from when we left. I never thought it would end like this.

Teresa and I put our armor on and equipped ourselves for our offensive. Teresa insisted I keep the shield again and I can’t argue with her. So we ran, and for the first time I experienced the true speed that Teresa can sprint. It felt almost effortless but in under five minutes we traveled from halfway up the mountain to the powerplant without being spotted. I couldn’t believe it. I did not realize the extent that Teresa held herself back for me. I thought I was strong with her blood, but I did not have a fraction of the strength she truly possesses. It makes me wonder if she isn’t still holding back for my inexperienced self. 

When we reached the powerplant there were guards posted at every entrance. This was as far as we could go without causing a ruckus. Teresa and I look over at each other and she nods in agreement. Together we strike the two Underdwellers before they could react. Their heads fall to the floor as their bodies slump over. 

“How were we able to do that? What about their shield? Their forcefield?” I whisper over to Teresa.

“Their portable technology is recent, or at the least recent to my knowledge. It takes time before they can mass produce their latest inventions. Grunts like these are not worth the resources in Underdweller eyes. Now come, there is little doubt a patrol will round by here soon. We must make use of the time before we are discovered.” She opens the door for me and we slip quietly inside. Arrows point towards the different places within the building. I guess they didn’t want the workers getting lost.

We travel down towards the boiler first. Along the way it is eerily quiet. No Underdwellers within the building, performing maintenance or oversight of any kind. As we enter the boiler it is empty. The only thing of note is the odd rewiring they have performed. Pieces of their technology are grafted with ours, and a stone sits as the only fuel source. It radiates the same sickly purple glow that seems to follow wherever the Underdwellers touch. 

We back out and head towards the generator. There we see a group of 6 Underdwellers setting up circuitry, seemingly trying to create a direct line between their underground base as the powerplant. The only reason I can think of them doing this is that they are planning to take over and occupy the remains of my town. Create their own foothold on the surface world. Hell if I am going to let that happen. I look over to Teresa and she gives a nod again. Together we are able to kill two of the Underdwellers without resistance, but the other four are able to ready their weapons. They are wearing armor covered in thorns that glow the same shade as the knife that knocked Teresa out. They hiss and screech at us, spitting curses in that gravelly language. At least I assume they are curses, I don’t understand a thing. 

These Underdwellers are more prepared than any of the others, Pistons attach to their arms and legs, making them much faster and stronger than what I previously fought. Here I was thinking my newfound power would make this easy, but these bastards are always one step behind. Teresa makes the first move, lunging at the Underdweller to the left. Her blade knicks the skin of it before the creature deflects the blade with force that knocks Teresa briefly out of stance. Another Underdweller attempts to stab her while she is off her footing, but I rush in to parry it in time. As I try to counter, his legs fling him backwards leaving dust in the place where sturdy concrete once stood. Teresa and I take a step back as well.

“We are not able to defeat them in head-on combat. Their machines are too swift.” Teresa whispers.

“How are they reacting to us in time though? When I first saw you fight you were nothing but a blur.”

“I do not know. However, it is no matter. We must fight as one. They can react to one of our attacks, yet they are unable to react to both at once. If they could, they would not need to have their ally counterattack for them.”

The Underdwellers eye us, waiting for us to make the next move. I take focus on their eyes and see purple glowing from the previously milky white orbs.

“They have augments in their eyes as well. I think that’s what is letting them react to us. It also is why they aren’t attacking right now. They need us to attack so they can react.”

“Keen eye, Toby. We may be able to use that as well if we can find a way to disable them. Let us label them by weapon. Sword(wielder), Pike, Spear, Mace. Understood?”

“What’s the difference between a spear and a pike?” I ask sheepishly. 

Teresa sighs. “Spears are shorter and usually one handed. Pikes are longer and usually two handed. Ready?”

“Got it. Ready.”

“PIKE!” Teresa shouts as she lunges again striking hard against the pike. The Underdweller manages to block but Teresa’s attack knocks the pike wielder out of position. I ran behind it, and just as Teresa said, it was unable to react in time. My blade struck through the Underdwellers body erupting from its chest.

“SPEAR!” This time I take initiative, throwing the body of Pike at Sword to misdirect before taking a stab at Spear. The impact of his parry nearly sends my sword flying from my hand but Teresa is there in under a second. Her sword runs through the spear wielder's skull and he flops over dead. Sword and mace are huddled next to each other. 

“SWORD!” Teresa takes the lead again, clashing against the sword of the Underdweller. As I rush in to take my swing I see a mace fast approaching my face. I barely duck out of the way and am forced to step back again. Sword regains his composure as well, taking a retaliatory swipe at Teresa that forces her to back off as well.

“Again. You strike first this time.” Teresa commands me.

“MACE!” I take my attack and Mace meets me with equal might. I can hear a clang shortly and I know to pull back before Mace decides to take a swing at me. Teresa and I meet again.

“They have adapted to our strategy. We will not be able to strike them down so long as they remain each other's shield.” Teresa analyses them, looking for her next opening.

“Hey, do you remember plan B?” I nudge Teresa as I glance at the concrete dust at our feet. Her eyes follow mine and I see a faint smile form. I scoop up the dust with my boot and fling it in the eyes of the Underdwellers. They shriek and swing wildly at the air as Teresa and I both rush their sides and slash our preferred targets. Mace and Sword both fall and quiet fills the air once more.

We take a closer look at what the Underdwellers were working on. The wires and gadgets make little sense to me, but I noticed one thing that gave me pause. A display that seemed to be changing every second, written in their unreadable language. I knew better than to think this was a simple clock. I grabbed Teresa’s hand and dragged her out of the building as fast as I could run, the sound of a high pitched whistle chasing us on our way out. We reached the door before everything was set off.

The ground shakes beneath our feet, something even more fierce than a behemoth’s tremors. From below pillars erupt and slowly the ground below starts to sink inside. Whatever they were doing here, we were too late. Before my eyes I watch as even the dead and desolate remains of my former life are swallowed by an oversized drill. Once the drill finishes it flips upside-down and a city is revealed. A dark city made of the blackest stone. Windowless, artless, built strictly for the purpose to serve. The only light that emerges from it is that disgusting purple glow, running through tubes all along the city. The whole place is brimming with creatures that come flooding out, including 5 behemoths that get to work flattening the surrounding area for expansion. 

Atop what appears to be a dark temple stands that Underdweller, the first one we came into contact with. He stands mighty above his city, standing as if prepared to give a declaration. Little did I know that is exactly what was going on. From an unknown source the Underdwellers voice could be heard all around. At first the speech played in their own language, but something was translating it to us.

“My fellow Monumentals! Today marks a tremendous occasion, the beginning of the colonization of the surface world! Long have we feared the human race, but here I have displayed that humans can be defeated. With patience, we will claim this world. Let this be known as the beginning of the end for humanity!” A thunderous applause of screeches erupts from the city below and the Head Underdweller takes the moment to soak it all in. Once the crowd settles down he speaks again. 

“I hope you enjoyed my speech, dear lizard lurking these streets. Worry not, soon you will be reunited with the rest of your ilk in whatever afterlife you believe in, I’m sure. If you want to make it even sooner, come out of hiding and end this futility.” Snickering can be heard from the city below.

Seeing the Underdwellers replacing my home with their own, threatening to take the entire Earth, and taunting carelessly as they do it, it all unleashes something I didn’t realize was still lurking within me.

My head runs wild. ”The bastards, they trample over my home, my friends' homes. Everytime I think there is nothing more they can take from these old wounds they still find a way to tear them back open.” I could feel the scales sprouting from my fingers. 

“I grow sick of being forced to tolerate the existence of these irredeemable roaches, but they just made their biggest mistake.” I could feel bone protruding from my back, trying to break free from the pressure inside my armor. 

“They just opened up their entire civilization to my wrath. I can kill them all. I WILL kill them all! I will make them FEEL every SPECK OF PAIN they have inflicted upon me! I WILL-” I feel my helmet fly off of my head. I spin to face my assailant and it is Teresa.

Teresa kisses me and I feel my entire being relax.

“I will take your burden. You do not listen well to my warnings, do you? It is no matter. Allow me to take your sorrow, your rage. For I know that my love for you is far greater than the suffering you have faced. My love will guide my will.” Teresa removes her armor. I see the scales appear on her as I feel my own recede. Wings erupt from her back as mine retreat back within me. All my pain has been replaced with internal peace, as Teresa’s eyes grow red. She’s not just empathetic, she's an emotional conduit. Teresa grows and towers over even the behemoths. Her scales are a brilliant white that reflect absolute purity and her eyes transition back from blood red to her sparkling emerald green. With a roar she announces to our foes, they now face the true power of the Trovanyr.

Effortlessly, Teresa flies in a circle, cutting through each behemoth before she lands and prepares for the assault that will soon take place against her. Roars fill the air as swarms of vrak and wolvnir pour from the city in her direction. She spews fire and her radiant white flames incinerate the vrak as they try to fly towards her. With a stomp of her foot countless wolvnir are reduced to paste. Despite her overwhelming strength, the flood keeps coming. Wolvnir begin to jump on and climb her as the vrak poke and prod her. This isn’t good. She can’t fend them off forever, there’s so many it seems endless. I rush to face the only thing I can think to stop this.

Seemingly unphased, the Head Underdweller calmly walks back inside his temple. I catch up and confront the Head Underdweller as he enters the deeper reaches of his temple's chamber. With my head cleared of my indiscriminate rage, and against my better judgment, I feel obligated to try and negotiate a peaceful surrender. Plenty of bad people in charge do plenty of bad things, and the consequences often fall on the ones who lay powerless beneath them. While I will do whatever it takes to end this, I’d sleep better at night without the guilt of countless lives on my chest. 

“Your conquest ends here! You have one chance to surrender, and I swear that Teresa and I will spare any innocents in your city. That’s the best offer I can give you.”

The Head Underdweller turns to face me. “What a surprise. Even with lizard blood in your veins, lizard scales on your body, I would never expect you to survive for so long. Tell me, does this mean the lizards do not eat their mates?” 

I grit my teeth. Let’s give reason one last chance. “Do you not care for the innocents you lord over? Children? Family? Is there anyone you care about in that city beyond yourself?”

The Head Underdweller smirks. “Children? You think we would expose our youth to this polluted cesspool? Unlike you, Human, we value our future generations. The rest of these residents are simple fodder. Test subjects to see if your surface is even inhabitable. The only thing valuable in this civilization is I. Krazsok the Enlightened!” The creature raises its arms as if that name is supposed to mean something to me. At this point I can see there is no reasoning with him. I ready myself and rush at him. The moment I make impact I am flung back away and go crashing into a wall.

“Ah.” The Underdweller hisses gleefully “It is all making sense now. The unusual loss of soldiers and beasts, your extended survival, it all stems from events unforeseeable.” Krazsok begins to cackle to himself as I stand myself up. 

“You poor boy! You poor fool! I told you this would come!” Krazsok’s laughter intensifies as he works himself up to a crescendo. 

“The lizard has made you her slave at the cost of your own humanity! You are a traitor to your kind!” The creature's cackles echo in the temple chamber.

“Quiet, damn you. I didn’t choose this, you forced it! I won’t be lectured about being a traitor by a tyrant!”

“Tyrant? In my language there is no such word. Taking power by force is simply the way of life. Do you see? This is what we do! We live to conquer, we live to make creatures of war! Those who can make the strongest weapons are rightfully rewarded! There are no innocents among my species in the moral eyes of yours.” 

“So, you think you earned your lofty title? ‘Krazsok the Enlightened’. What a joke. What about making wolvnir or behemoths makes you enlightened?” 

“Making a child’s toy like that? Nothing. I would be nothing if my greatest achievement was some mutt. If I must, allow me to show my credentials.” His wretched face twisted into a smile as he spoke. With the press of a button on his collar the rumbling returned. I turn to Teresa to see the wolvnir and vrak retreating away from her. She seems as confused as I am.

The center of the city explodes creating a deep chasm and from the abyss rises the only thing that could have ever struck the icy chill of fear into our hearts after all Teresa and I have been through. Her face was a mix of pain, sorrow, fear, and disgust when she laid eyes upon the reanimated remains of her fellow Trovanyr. 

Although the Trovanyr had long died, the rotted remains were puppetted by machinery and malice. What may have remained of the mind of the fallen was long gone, it now was just host to a machine brain piloting its defiled corpse. Teresa wailed in agony and I wept with her.

“My masterpiece, and thanks to you both, I can add two fresh additions to my growing collection.” Krazsok gazed at his handiwork and I used the distraction to try and end this fight. I lunged at him but this time he pulled his weapon and deflected me. Of course. I should have known he would have that exoskeleton too. Unlike the others, he had no purple glow in his eye. Without warning his weapon began to slash at me at a pace that I could hardly keep up with. His sword collided with my chestplate and I could feel something shift. With his other arm he punched my chest, knocking me down and crumbling the armor. My entire chest is now vulnerable. 

Krazsok smirked, but did not delay. He lept towards me and reengaged in combat. Every piece of armor he was able hit with his weapon grew weak and brittle. While he had not harmed me yet I was getting more and more exposed, I didn’t even realize he was toying with me. He tore off my armor bit by bit while still slashing away at me and I was helpless to defend myself. The other suits were clunky, nowhere near this refined. I finally had to take a risk, at this pace he was going to kill me. I turned, sacrificing the back half of my chestplate and plunged my sword through myself. The blow was able to get past him and struck him shallowly in the gut. He recoiled looking at his wound then to me, eyes now filled with rage. 

“You’re clever, I’ll honor you with that. Enough playing then, it is time for research. Where did I stab that girl?” In a blink he was in front of me again. I felt his knife dig into my side and all energy drained from my body. He let go of the knife, leaving it in my side as I collapsed on my back. 

“Let’s see how much exposure it takes for the poison to properly kill from this specific wound site. You keep groaning in pain until you expire, understood? I want to witness the fruits of my labor.” He steps over me to look over the balcony. Teresa is still fighting off the defiled Trovanyr. Her fires do not phase it, and she is going blow to blow against it. I can see significant damage on the mechanical monster but Teresa is also bleeding heavily. Even a decaying Trovanyr must still be strong enough to crack scales. There is no clear indication of who will give out first. I still need to end this. I need to save Teresa from that nightmare.

I collect all the strength left within me to keep silent as I remove the knife from my side. In agonizing pain I manage to clench my teeth and keep quiet as I creep up behind Krazsok. He mutters to himself, engrossed in the battle and his monstrosity’s performance. He hears the splash of my blood hitting the ground behind him but it is too late. I fall upon him as he turns and plunge the dagger into his chest over and over. He throws me off of him but the damage is done. 

“I guess I am still human after all.” I gloat as I watch him gag and sputter. When he finally goes limp I crawl my way back over to his body. Looking up, the fight is going south. The necrocyborg is unaware of the damage it has taken, but Teresa is getting slowed by her pain. I frantically try pressing everything on the collar but nothing is happening. The undead monster manages to topple Teresa to her side, striking down hard on her as she is pinned. Thinking for a second, I grab the dead idiot’s hand and try using his own finger. I press multiple things until the defiled Trovanyr stops. Teresa wastes no moment in catching the things neck in her jaws and tearing off its head. She flattens the machinery underneath her claws. With a mighty roar that shakes the earth she announces her victory. She breathes her flames on the invading city, reducing the entire thing to smoldering rubble.

I rush over to her as fast as I can in my weakened state and upon seeing me she walks over. With a great effort she returns herself back to her human form before passing out. I catch her as she falls and wait for her to wake. Luckily for the health of my heart, it does not take long for her before her eyes open again.

“Toby? Why am I naked?” She says gently with a sly grin on her face.

“Huh?! I um, I had nothing to do with this!” I sputter out defensively as she giggles at me. I was so caught up in worry I hadn’t even noticed.

“I only tease. My clothes do not grow with me unfortunately. Although, why are YOU naked?”

“Oh. Um. My toga might have gotten cut to ribbons during my fight.” I try to hide my embarrassment as I keep my gaze off of her.

“Is it over then? Are we safe?” 

“It is over. Nothing of the Underdwellers remains.” I assure her.

“Good.” She breathes a sigh of relief. “Then I need not trouble with covering myself.” Teresa pokes at my cheek, noticing I am still turned away from her. “That is, unless my feelings are unrequited.” She says in a sorrowful tone. 

“No! That’s wrong. Teresa, I love you too. I love you so much. You’re the only thing that makes my world turn, the only thing I have left but the only thing I need. I love you and I respect you and I just don’t want to stare or be awkward because-” Teresa grabs the top of my head and turns my head back towards her.

“If you wish not to be awkward then look at me, you fool. Do not think I hold the same reservations. I will stare at you as long as I please, and I invite you to do the same, but currently I would like to stare into your eyes.” She smiles that smile that makes my heart flutter with joy, the one that is both teasing and sincere. She puts her hand on my cheek as we kiss. 

I want to thank all of you who have followed me along this journey, a journey I never thought I’d actually survive. Although, there are a few too many times I very nearly didn’t. Your support has kept me sane and kept me going when things were looking bleakest. Teresa and I plan on staying here for a while. We don’t know if the Underdwellers are fully gone yet. More may still remain beneath our feet, and if that is the case, we will be ready. One day we may reunite with civilization, if only for a brief moment. For now, all I want is to embrace the peace we have won, this small victory before the looming war. Teresa deserves this moment to live happily.

That being said, we know this isn’t the only location the Underdwellers existed. If your town is under attack, reach out to us, we will come running. If you hear the howling from the woods, do not fight it alone. I swear to protect my kind, humankind, and Teresa has always been protecting us. Wherever, whenever we are called, we will join the fight once more. Until the howling in the woods has forever gone silent.

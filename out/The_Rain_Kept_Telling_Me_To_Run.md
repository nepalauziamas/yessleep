 When I was in university studying art, I was also interested in occultism. I learned a lot of things about old cults, and the gods they believed in. There was a strange cult during the Cold War. Its members used Morse code, so I learned it too.

During that time, I also organized a few rituals that different cults used. I didn’t believe in any nonsense they believed in; I did that because I found it interesting, and wanted to know more about them. 

After I finished the university, I stopped learning about occultism, and I had a reason for that. My last ritual was strange, very strange. I found it in a book that was written almost a thousand years ago in Arabic and was later translated to Latin. It included a receipt for a potion. There wasn’t any dangerous material in it, so I made it and drank it. 

I immediately regretted it because I fell asleep on the floor at that exact minute, and what I saw was terrifying. I was in space, saw multiple galaxies, then I looked around, and there was that thing, I don’t know how to describe it. It looked like a creature; it was far larger than the biggest galaxies. I only saw a gigantic white head with one huge eye in the middle (or maybe it was its mouth?). It had multiple arms growing out of its head. 

Hours went by, and I was still floating there in nothingness. I wasn’t breathing or blinking. Then I finally woke up. What a strange dream, I thought. I looked at the clock and was surprised that I slept for seven hours. I looked out of the window, it was raining. I closed my eyes, then listened to the rain. I was horrified. The rain knocking on my window repeated the word “run” in Morse code.

It just kept repeating. It’s just a coincidence, I told myself. When ten minutes went by, it still hadn’t stopped. I opened my window, but somehow it didn’t change anything. 

*Run*

I opened the book I used to make that potion. I just wanted to read something to forget the rain. The cultists in the Middle Ages used that potion to communicate with their god. They also wanted to summon it on Earth, but they failed. 

*Run*

I suddenly heard some kind of explosion. I thought it was probably just the storm. Then I also smelled something. Smoke. 

*Run.* 

I heard it constantly. And not just in Morse code, but I heard it in my head too. I ran. As I got out of my room, I saw the fire in the kitchen. I lived alone. How did it happen? I ran out of my house and called the firefighters. Two minutes later the whole house was on fire. As the firefighters tried to put it out, I saw the world fading away. 

I have no idea how to explain it, but I think I saw four or more dimensions. I heard a voice in my head. *You saw him, and now he’s angry. He tried to kill you, so I warned you with the rain. I’ll try to protect you, please be careful. He doesn’t like living beings.*

Everything faded away, and I saw the firefighters again, but I was shocked and lost my consciousness. I woke up later in a hospital. After that, I started drinking. I just can’t process what happened that day. I saw a creature (a god?), and it wanted to kill me for it, then another tried to save me from him. I burned all my books about cults and rituals. I wish I could live again not knowing about things I shouldn’t know about.

If anyone is seeing this, then I don't have much time left. It's been getting more agressive, I think it might try to attack me soon. If that is going to happen, I want someone to know what happened to me. I should probably tell you when it began.

It first started while I was about 7 or 8 years old. I was going over to my grandmother's to go camping with my aunt's, uncle's and cousins. The place we were camping at was an area behind her house. We called it the blacktop. It was this old abandoned walking park.the reason it was abandoned was some people burned down one of the main houses that were in the blacktop. Now all that's there is the concrete frame where the house once stood and the fire place. After the fire, the entire park was abandoned.

When entering into the blacktop you go through this path that leads you to it, as soon as you enter the park the first thing you see is the house, the main place my cousin's and I would hang out. If you turn to the left there's a little path that leads to a few busted up structures. We've explored most of the abandoned buildings at the blacktop. If you keep going on that path is will loop around and lead you back to the blacktop. If you go right a little and straight you'll reach a fork in the road. If you go left, it will loop around back to the blacktop, if you go right it will take you down a pretty long path that leads to some smaller Plath's. We've haven't explored the entirety of that path yet. If your at blacktop again and you go right, you'll see an abandoned pool. The first time we went there one of my cousins almost stepped in a kiddy pool full of algae thinking it was grass. If you go past the pool and keep walking for a bit you a pond. Around the pond is where we were camping. 

I arrived to the site pretty late and they were already set up when I got there. All the tents were up and there was a fire pit. When I got there me and my cousin's, Dalton, tathem and Tyler all when out to do something, I don't remember what we did. My sister Chloe who's the oldest out of us was there too but she didn't really hang out with any of us. After a little while we came back to the site to chill there for a while.

 While we were sitting and talking about movies or the latest Minecraft update, we heard something, it sounded like multiple pairs of feet on the grass. Then a dog came out of the trees. Is was a German shepherd with red collar on it. It ran over to us and looked to be excited to see us. It was jumping around barking quite a bit. We all started petting it and it calmed down a bit. I looked at the collar and it had a name on it, max, that must be his name. Then a man walked out of the woods where the dog had came from. My grandmother and everyone else came over and spoke to the man. "Hey folks, how are you on this fine summer day?" He said with a large amount of joy in his voice. "We're doing great, how are you today?" My uncle, Gary said to the man. "I'm doing quite alright myself, me and some buddies are going dirt biking around here and I was Wondering if you could watch my dog while we're riding." The man asked us. A lot of people would dirt bike around here so him saying this wasn't a surprise. "Of course, the kids already like him so we'd be happy to." Gary said, looking over to us. "Oh that's great to hear, I'll be back tomorrow to pick him up." The man said, waving back as he walked away.

That night wasn't very eventful. Gary took me and my cousin's frog hunting to make fried frog legs. Tathem and chole chickened out and wouldn't eat any. But me, Tyler and Dalton ate all of them. They kinda tasted like chicken tenders. We named one of the frogs Ralph because of the sound he made. I went to sleep around 10 while Dalton and Gary stayed up and sat around the fire. I woke up and got out of the tent, I believe it was about 7:00 am. I saw my grandmother making eggs over the fire. I sat down and max came over to me. I pet him for a bit, I then realized that besides my grandmother, I was the only one awake. "I guess Dalton stayed up too late again?" I jokingly remarked to her. "Well you know him" she replied. " When's the dirt bike guy coming to pick up max?" I asked her. "No clue, maybe some time in the afternoon." She said.

People started to wake up. First my dad, then Gary, then my aunt crystal and dreama, then tathem and Tyler, then chole and finally Dalton. It's about 9:00 am now and we're all eating breakfast, when suddenly we someone running towards the camp. Max started jumping up and barking. we thought it must be Max's owner but it wasn't. It was another dirt biker. He sounded very distressed. "You guys gotta help, my friend crashed into a tree, I don't think he's breathing!" The man said in a panic. Dad and Gary went to help the biker while me, Tyler, tathem and Dalton had to wonder what's going on. Not shortly after the police were called, Max's owner crashed into a tree and his head collided with the tree, smashing his head. We could see the aftermath through the ambulance window, there was gray matter everywhere, they said he died instantly. Max went with the man's friend. 

As we were watching the ambulance drive off Dalton tapped me on the shoulder. "What?" "Look over there, in the Forest." He points into the trees. At first I didn't see it but then I did. It looked tall and skinny, almost human like but it didn't look right, I couldn't see any other features except for it's lanky limbs. It was dark and I couldn't see what color it was, it blended in To the Forest which is why you couldn't see it if you weren't looking hard enough. "Maybe it's some weird tree or something" I tried to explain " that doesn't look like any tree I've ever seen, it looks almost human like." Then what do you think it is?" I ask. "I don't know, but I don't think it's a tree." Dalton says. "I'm sure it's nothing." I say trying to change the conversation. 

That night, something happened. On this night everyone went to ber around 10:00 pm. I was in my tent, I couldn't sleep for some reason, I just had a feeling that if I slept something bad would happen. As I'm laying there, I hear something. It was the crunch of leaves on the grass. I thought that maybe someone had gotten up to get a drink or something but if that was the case, why didn't I hear anyone's tent unzip? So I decide to check it out. I unzip my tent, trying not to wake anyone up. The fire was out so I couldn't see very much. I keep walking until I can see more. Then I see it. It was hunched over, looking at something on the ground I could tell that it was something very tall, with lanky limbs and long fingers ending at a sharpened tip. It's head was almost a perfect circle, it almost had no features on it, no clothes, no joints, nothing. It looked like it was made out of wood. It it resembled some kind of demonic stick figure. I go to back up but I stepped on a leaf. In that moment, it was almost like all sounds stopped at once, there's was nothing but silence. And then, it's as if every sound in the Forest started all at once as the figure turned around, I could see that it had two perfectly round circles for eyes, and they were glowing white. There were no other features on its face except for those eyes. As it turned around it's eyes started flashing. I could feel myself drifting into unconsciousness. All I could see were those eyes and I'll I could hear were those loud noises. I couldn't help it and soon I passed out.

I woke up in my tent. I looked around frantically thinking it was still around, but it was day. Everyone was outside maybe it was a dream? But it was so real. I went outside and everyone was there. I didn't bother telling anyone, they'd think I was crazy. So I just kept it to myself. Later that day we all went home, I went to my mom, and I forgot about it. Then that night, I had a dream. I was in a forest. An endless, dark forest. I turned around, and there it was, the figure. With it's lanky limbs and glowing eyes. Then I started running. I couldn't stop, all I knew was i just had to get away. I looked behind me and it was closer. I looked back again and it was even closer. Every time I looked back, it was closer. Until I looked back for the final time and I woke up. Once again, I questioned weather that was real or not. But then, I saw it. It was looming over my bed. I couldn't move. I thought it was another dream. So I did what anyone would do, I pinched myself and it hurt, this wasn't a dream. I couldn't scream. I was just sitting there. I was almost waiting for it to kill me but it never did. I was just laying there, but then, I just fell asleep. I woke and it was gone. And of course I didn't tell anyone, they would think I was crazy.

There's more to this but I think it's watching me, I can't let it know I'm exposing it, so I'll end this here. I will continue if it doesn't get me before I finish, but until then, goodbye.

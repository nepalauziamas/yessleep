I 39m am writing about my 14m son. I need a little advice as ever since he has gotten home he has not been the same. We will call my son J and ever since he went got home from his schools field trip he has been acting strange. 

Now for a little backstory J's principal made a field trip to go to a museum for the last day of school my son, J begged me to let him go. Now, just so you know we are not the richest as I have to work a full time job and a part time job just to get by. So I told him no at first but then he said,"Dad please I need to go no matter what and its only $25." But, the wat he said it kinda creeped me out though I told him," Fine extra chores for a month and here is $50." He thanked me a lot but still I felt like something wasn't right.

The next day J comes home pretty excited and he turned his money with his little slip in which means that tommorow he will be going to that museum. But what was also weird is that my son is not into learning anything so i was shocked when he wanted to go and the fact he wanted to be away from his Minecraft game that he plays was shocking to me.

Fast forward a few hours and while we are eating dinner I decide to ask why he wanted to go and he said,"That's none of your business." That kinda stung since I payed for him but I decided not to question it anymore since it might just be a phase.

After dinner he goes to sleep because the bus is leaving at 6:30 but I decide to look into the museum online to see what it is about but what was strange is that it never popped up online I thought maybe it was new so I didn't question it. 

I decide to go to sleep early as well so I can make him some good eggs. After breakfast he leaves thanking me and also for more info about my son, J he is not really the ordinary child since he is quiet and doesn't have much friends. 

But his principal is just creepy on another level we will call her H. And for example when I drop him off for school the H is always out there and she grabs him by a weird way.

I've also noticed she only stays in shaded areas as well I assume her eyes are sensitive or something though still a bit strange along with her two long fangs. Also this one drew the line when he had a boner she looked at it and said,"Oh my that looks appetzing." 

My son J told me about on the way home and I was furious I confronted the principal about and she claimed to have never said that but my son may be weird but he is not a liar. I was still mad about but I decided to see if it happened again and it didn't so I kinda forgot about the incident. 

Lastly she never ever eats garlic my son had to make a gift for the principal back in 6th grade so I gave him some left over chicken to bring and when she ate it he told me that she was having some sort of panic attack. 

But anyways I don't really know what happened while my son was out but when he got home he seemed so different I don't know how to describe it except like he was a different person.

I asked him about why he seemed different and he brushed it off saying something like,"Oh its nothing dad I feel the same." That was when I noticed what appeared to be two bite marks on his neck when I asked him about he said he had no idea what it was from. 

So then I offered him some chicken which he immediately said yes. When he started eating he had started screaming and crying on the ground I took him to the hospital where they said he was allergic to garlic. I told them no that is not right I fed him garlic his whole life and they assured me he was. 

The doctors also told me that he had a bite mark on his neck I told them I knew about that and that my son doesn't know what it is from which then docs said this is clearly from two human fangs. Later that night I took him home and we went to bad since it was getting late. 

I woke up early at 8:42 am to my son screaming I rushed in his room with my pistol incase of a intruder when I saw him crying in a shaded area with parts of his sking missing and his muscle tissue visible. That is when it clicked together my son's principal turned him into a vampire. I need advice on how I'm supposed to go on and live with a vampire without being turned into a vampire he is still currently in the hospital recovering from the burns but I really need help.

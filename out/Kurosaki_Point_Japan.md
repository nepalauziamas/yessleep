Okay so Short backstory: I was stationed in Japan, found a nice beach in Miura named in the title. There are multiple man made caves in and out of the peninsula from the Middle Ages. Many are burial tombs, shrines, mass graves, and holy sites where spirits are worshipped and believe to live. We were not aware of this.

This beach was suggested randomly on google to me and my husband as we searched for new places to visit. We visited two or three times, noting many abandoned buildings on stilts on the hills, as well as two big caves. the entrance to this beach is..sketchy to say the least. You arrive on a farm after climbing a blind steep hill, all you can see are bamboo and woods surrounding it. No ocean sounds. The only smell was compost as you drive for a mile to the end where multiple cars are lined up one behind the other on the road between the cabbage fields. 

We are confused as there is only a very small path winding into the bamboo thicket. We treck through, hills roots everywhere. We arrive at the top of a large hill and it opens into the pacific ocean. Full of rocks and tide pools a couple campers spread throughout. This beach is massive. As far as you can see on either side. We visit again with our friend. 

My husband him and I arrive and have a fun until they wanted to explore the abandoned buildings. Which immediately made me feel..off. I felt like we shouldn’t be there and like we were being watched in broad daylight. We leave the buildings and notice a dead cat washed ashore. 

We all three turn around and notice the cave. A wooden sign outside saying warning and the rest written in Japanese. We figured it was a warning for cave ins. We immediately noticed it’s old. And worn. And the top is curved like a door, but bricks are still covering a portion. Like it was bricked up. So at one point it was blocked off.

 We walk in and immediately note a room to our right. A pile of clothes lay in the corner as well as plenty of trash. The clothes gave me a bad feeling and I wondered who would leave their clothing in a pile together like that. It takes a sharp left turn and the stairs begin. Each step is worn down, the walls are sharp rocks, and we begin to climb. Water is constantly dripping from the ceiling. I did not want to step in the water pooling in the center of the walkway I don’t know why. a small room was ahead as we finished the stairs. 

My friend, goes ahead alone. Being loud. Trudging through the water. Joking about things being inside of the cave. My hand is on the wall guiding me and it sent tv static up my entire arm, into my spine, and in the back of my head. Like an instinct. He comes out of the room joking to us, and we both were silent. Like our bodies somehow knew this was not the place to act up. Directly to our right is another staircase. 

The air is getting colder the further up we go, and the more windy it became. We swear we climbed many more stairs than the hill was tall. My friend is leading us being loud still poking his head into any cavern which opened. We look down and pick up a credit card. My first thought was, whoever’s clothes are in the front may be the owner of this card, but why is someone else this deep in here naked? This was never answered. I took the card, but quickly decided to get rid of it upon leaving. I have guilt over it may being someone’s missing case evidence. But with what we experienced I don’t think anyone can judge my choices. 

We treck along a little further and I have already lost my way, relying on my hand holding my spouses shirt, and my other against the wall all trying to avoid the water. My spouse stops and the bad feeling I had since starting to explore places we were not meant to be grew. So many warnings ignored. I tell my husband once my friend starts to act different, that I have a bad feeling, he said me too, but we have to stay near him as he is very excited exploring and may get lost. 

My friend is typically very composed and never has acted this WIRED. He was screaming practically. Making taunting jokes towards the cave and any spirits within, therefore joking about the entire culture. He joked like things were chasing us, making taunting noises and overall acting like a disrespectful ass. Which I’ve never heard or expected him to do and never have seen or heard it from him since. He was acting almost..manic. it was a terrifying excited energy. 

Following him, I had lost our way a long time ago not having a light. we soon find a bunch of dirt piled at the end of a tunnel and we popped our heads above ground! it was the bamboo thicket, no sounds of the ocean. It felt like we literally exited into another world. the other side. my friend was acting disgusted and was practically begging us to come back inside the cave. i was scared. the bamboo felt like safety. something told me to run from my friend and the cave. it was terrifyingly silent and i still felt safer "on the other side". but we couldn't abandon him. we say we are ready to go and we start going back, never actually reaching the end of the cave system. the passages kept splitting and it never seemed to end. 

my friend kept on with the same aggressive energy the entire way back. we paused, right before the staircases leading down and out the entrance. its a perfectly circular tunnel, small enough you have to crawl. it was angled 45 degrees straight up. they point flashlights and we noticed it opened at the top. about 30 feet up. much higher than the hill actually was. we climbed two very tall staircases and that tunnel went 45 degrees up and was LONG. this hill was no where near this tall. at this point me and my husband watch him begin to crawl up it. 

I look at him and talk about the height and how it doesn't make sense. as we whisper quietly, (note i have been avoiding the water) i lower my head, hand on the wall trying to listen as i felt we weren't alone. i get the tv static shock again. i lift my head up and my husband goes wide eyed. i look at him and said we aren't alone in here. immediately after , we. hear crashing footsteps running up the staircase directly through the water. the splashing echoed even after the footsteps stopped directly by the doorway to the stairwell. our only way out. 

just then, my friends exits the hole, completely stern no emotion and say we have to go. he states there are bugs. i don't know how i didn't touch one running my hand along the wall, but we glance up with the flashlight, thousands of cave centipede things. we never seen them prior to exiting. we exit. finally. 

I could feel whatever it was right behind us. i turn around just after exiting and bowed and apologized. it felt right. i know it was sitting at the bottom watching right behind the corner on the stairs. immediately exiting the cave, was a fresh dead hawk. which wasn't there when we entered. another omen of death i assume. we left and my friend was drained. whatever was giving him that energy, wanting him to stay inside the cave and act aggressive exhausted him. he slept the entire way home. i never went back. 

I believe whatever inhabits this cave draws people in. makes them act aggressive and like going deeper is an addiction. i believe it truly was like as above so below and we were going down. not up. the hill is not this tall.  i believe we somehow exited through the other side of the veil. i have so many unanswered questions and i hope some of you can help me understand what we found. I do have photo evidence of the beach and cave if it helps anyone dig up history. I couldn’t find anything that the cave was mapped or even a name for it.

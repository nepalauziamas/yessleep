It's a Saturday morning? I guess you can call it that? It's around 1:16 AM and for the past hour or so, I've been trying to find stories to narrate so I can put it on my YouTube because what else do you do? Gameplay isn't my thing but occasionally I'll upload a horror game, that's for free, but with the rise in analog horror and my interest with EAS scenarios, I've made it my decision to stick with mostly horror. Of course, there's a risk since this is YouTube we are talking about. I hop on Discord and talk to my friend, Crystal, who usually enjoys reading horror stories and enjoys my passion.

As much as we talk a lot, I see her as my sister. Well, while I start to look for stories, I ask her to help me by sending me links to various other stories around the internet and even to some SCP articles to read. I'm always down for a good story or an SCP article to keep me awake since I don't have any issues with staying up all night. Time passes and she's still scouring the internet for some stories as I'm  doing the same. That is until there's a small thud coming from the front of the house that I'm living at. "Huh...?" I look over at the door and grab my phone and start to exit the room, avoiding to not wake up my roommate. I look back at my laptop and still see that Crystal is taking her time. She really wants me to read the best stories.

I trust her with providing the goods. With my hand on the door knob, I look forward and turn the knob then pull the door open. The hallway to my left is narrow and pitch black since it is after 1:30 AM. No one is up except for Crystal and myself. I look to my right as the living room is also pitch black. There's some light coming from the patio outside. As I make the first step outside the room and into the living room when my phone vibrates. I keep quiet so all I do is tap the screen once as the display shows 01:30 AM and a message from Crystal with a song link to YouTube.

I roll my eyes and open the message and to my surprise, she sent a song titled, "Hide and Seek", followed by another message saying "Have fun, Zero\~". With confusion in my head, I reply back saying, "Oh, sure. You know how to scare me, surely." I tap the screen twice so it goes off then slip it into my pocket. I peek at the patio before the thud sounds off. 

I freeze suddenly as a chill goes through my back. It sounds off again but it grows louder. I forcibly move my body towards the direction of the sound. It was coming from the kitchen which was only a few feet away. With my heart beating rapidly, I slowly approach the kitchen and at that exact time, my phone vibrates again. I exhale quietly before tapping the screen and seeing that Crystal sent another message. This time, she sent three dots. Another message follows with her saying, "Watch your step. It can see you." I look around as shadow figures became visible in front of me. They didn't look like sleep paralysis demons or anything. Just visible figures with bright white eyes and black pupils. A grin starts to appear on this figure as I look at this figure with fear. I shake my head before steeping back until my body freezes. 

A quiet whisper emerges behind me. "Don't you believe it? You're going to be set free soon. You've made quite a name for yourself. You don't know yet, do you? Few years too soon... You'll see...I turn around and the figure appears again but with a distorted face of someone familiar to me. I realize too late that I'm being surrounded by these two figures. I look back and forth at these figures as they don't seem to want to hurt me or want to make me do anything. Both of them lock their eyes on me before they whisper their chant, "Few years too soon... few years too soon..." Over and over again. I cover my ears as I close my eyes and start to whisper to myself, "it's over, it's over, not them, go away, go away, go away..." 

As the whispers fade out, my eyes widen as my heart continues to beat rapidly. With not a second left, I ran back into the room and saw that the messages I got on my phone weren't there on my laptop. I restart Discord on my laptop and still nothing. I did the same with my phone but the messages were still there. I restart my phone and now I'm waiting for it to complete optimizing the apps. 

As of now, it's on my lock screen display but a message appears from Crystal. She says, "Few years too soon, huh?" I waste no time turning off my phone. It's currently next to me but my laptop didn't get the message from her. What is happening? What is going on? What did I just witness? What do I do?

We all know that air is essential to life. We know that without it, every form of life would just die. That was and still is the widely accepted truth, when in reality all we know is a lie.

Recently some notes were found in a mental illness hospital. They were quickly disregard as being nothing more that scribbles of an old mad man. No one gave them any importance except the leader of our research team, who is also our benefactor. He took an interest in those papers, which is certainly strange if you ask me

Apparently during the reign of Hitler in the second World War, professor Gehrman Reus conducted some studies on Oxygen. He came to the conclusion that air is in fact not essential to life, and that is harmful to humans. Even more, it is a drug that alters our perception of the "real" world. He was of course accused of being crazy, and was pretty much locked in that hospital for mental illnesses

We are not a huge research team, and are very united, but still no one could question the decision of our leader, mr. Jovanovic

It's like he was unmovable and set on further researching Gehrman Reus' project.

Mr Jovanovic is by far the smartest person i know, and to be honest might be the smartest person in Germany. To think he would be so intrigued by such foolishness...


The next 6 months were uneventful, but we made a lot of progress. While I was still sceptical, the discoveries of Weber from more than 50 years ago started to feel not so alien and foolish.

Mr. Jovanovic told me he wanted to discuss certain matters in private. Out of all the scientists working in his team, he trusted me the most. After all he was my mentor.

**What is it mr. Jovanovic**

**oh call me Flynn, would you. You are not a student anymore** he replayd laughing

**In a month's time we are ready to test our work until now on a human** he continued

Hearing this made me feel uneasy, but also a bit excited, as much as i hate to admit it.

**Ok. What would be the procedure mr.. Flynn?**

**It's nothing complicated! We just need to remove the lungs, mouth and nose of our text subject**

Hearing this filled me with dread. A brief thought of giving up cross my mind, but i quickly disregarded it. I had to much respect for mr. Jovanovic and again, I was curious myself. I wanted to see if we were foolish to trust the files of that Gehrmn guy from over 50 years ago.

**Oh and also as you know, the nerve in the brain that is responsible for instinctual breathing must also be removed** continued mr Jovanovic

I nodded and the conversation ended there. I went home that night and stayed up all night, thinking if we are on the verge of discovering something great, or meet with failure and waste a human life.

The next few weeks went by and now we had our first patient. Apparently he was an poor volunteer from central Africa.
He knew what he was getting himself into and demanded that the 1.5 million euros to be give to his wife and 7 children back in Africa 

Our team agreed and the removal surgery started. I can say it went smooth as butter. We successfully removed the lungs, mouth and nose as well as that nerve from the brain, and the vital signs of that man were regular.

We gave him some time to rest, and woke him up the next morning. This was the big moment. He slowly opened his eyes. He then looked at me and the rest of the team beside his bed. His eyes widened and he bolted out of the bed. He then looked at a nearby mirror, and tears began to form in his eyes. He 
grabed a nearby scissors and stabbed himself in the neck more than a dozen times. Blood covered the entire room and everyone was in shock

I gagged and almost started crying, unlike Angela who was already crying intensively. Mr Jovanovic called an emergency meeting immediately and ordered the disposal of that corpse

A long silence was filling the room. Before long Mr Jovanovic decided to break the silence

**Ok, what the hell was that**

**Could he have gotten scared of his image in the mirror?**

**Unlikely, he knew what he signed up for**

**He is DEAD, it doesn't matter anymore**

Everyone was violently changing opinions before Jovanovic hit the table with his clenched fist.

**Enough. We got here trough hard work. We can't let a single dead body ruin everything**

**He's right** i answered softly

**There's no progress without sacrifice, so i propose we find another volunteer**

**Yes. That's what we are gonna do. If anyone disagrees, raise your hand** said Mr Jovanovic.

Again silence. Nobody seemed to disagree. After all, who would want to spend 6 months on something without seeing the fruits of their work.

It's been 2 months now, and another volunteer was found

This time, a young man from spain named Andreas showed up at our doorstep so to speak

Mr Jovanovic told me to inform him on all the details. We also decided to not remove the nouse and mouth of our patient this time, in order to question him.

**So, Andreas, right? I believe you already know what this surgery is about**

**Yeah.. about removing both my lungs** he answered with an incredibly relaxed voice**

**Ok, i see you're not scared at all. That's good. And yes you're correct. We are going to remove your lungs. You have nothing to worry about as our previous attempt was a success**

**Whatever you say. However if I don't survive this, I want the payment for my service to be donated to the San Jocinero orphanage. I grew there, you see..**

**I understand. The surgery will take place in 4 day's time, after we run some examinations**

He nods. I go to search for mr Jovanovich and inform him of the situation. He seems to be in a good mood, and excited to see the results. Same as me I suppose.

Andreas was a healthy young man, as the tests suggested, so we wasted no time in getting to work.



The whole surgery took us around 4 hours, and after we were finished, Andreas was displaying normal vital signs.

Next morning we decided to wake him up.
He slowly opened his eyes. Then suddenly his eyes widened. He recoiled back in shock and stood up in his bed.

**W-wha...? Get away from me you Demons. Where Am I?**

**Easyyy, calm down** i said trying to calm him down

**Your voice... the same as the scientist from before, but you're not him**

At this point i was completely lost, and by the judging by the looks on the faces of my colleagues, so were they.

Mister Jovanovic motions towards Andreas, then 2 security guards restrain him

**You are Andreas, remember? You volunteered to have your lungs removed**

**Bloody hell, I know this, but where are the scientists. Have you killed them you monsters?** Andreas responded in pure terror

**What are you talking about boy? I am Flynn Jovanovic and this is my team**

**They.... You are not humans. What have you done to them?**

"Not humans" at this point, I am getting a little scared what was he trying to say by that?

**What are you saying?**

**You are not them. You look evil, like something straight from hell**

Air influences out perception of reality. That though comes in my mind and I Instantly realized what was going on

I go and bring a mirror in Andreas' room.

**Look in the mirror Andreas**

He then looks at his reflection and his eyes, once again widen

**No.... I'm too.. like this**

Tears run down his cheeks

**Ok calm down Andreas. You recognize me right. We spoke when you got here, remember**

**Your voice.. Yeah, I remember**

**Ok. Do you have difficulties breathing?**

**No, but what is this, Just tell me what the hell is this**

**Ok, calm down and explain**

**You..., We look different. Like Demons from old paintings**

**Demons.. Does the facility look any different?**

**No, it's the same, I think**

**Ok, release him**

The guards hesitate, but Jovanovic nods and they release Andreas

**Come here by the window** I say

Andreas staggers to the window

**Now look outside. Is there something different?**

Andreas sticks his head out the window, looks outside for a bit then turns to me**

He had a look of pure terror on his face

**The sky... is burning, and there's also a crimson pentagram.. etched into the sun**

Air is a drug that alters our perception of reality. Except for someone... without lungs.

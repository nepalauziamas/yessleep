This may be short but it was probs the most horrific thing I’ve witnessed as a kid so far and only recently started to remember that I have had this encounter.

I was around 15 turning 16 soon, I was that weird socially awkward kid that was easy to pick on. It was around summer break as I remember. I didn’t have any friends and hardly never went outside either. One day a letter came in our mailbox, it was from our local church stating they’re offering free classes to attend to. I’d have to spend 8 months with them and go to their classes very late. Those classes would take up to 3 hours at best. It wasn’t too far just a couple blocks away which was actually quite convenient.

I decided to do it just for the money I’d get after completing it. To be honest I’m not a religious person at all yet wouldn’t consider myself to be atheist either and really don’t care about that sort of stuff. My mom and grandparents are full on Christians. I started to dislike Christianity to be fair they made it seem like such a big deal that eventually I grew tired of it.

Mid summer I started attending the classes, I sorta hoped to make some friends there (spoiler altert: we instantly broke contact once those classes where over). They where quite boring and I daydreamed thru them to pass the time never even paying attention mostly. We ended up doing a some sort of ‘class trip’ where we went out of town and had sleepovers n stuff I don’t really remember where though my memory gets blurry there.

I remember we still had 3 more days to attend classes and then it would all be over. It was a very warm Sunday and our class was taken around town. Our teachers showed us places to hang out after school or for studying it was actually quite relaxing. Next to the mall there is this huge apartment complex that from the looks of it is just utterly disgusting to look at. It was originally a very bright yellow but it had turned more brown over the years and it smelled horrible like literal piss. 

The place was always trashed to shit and no local dared to even go near that place, instead always walked around it. It’s what most would call the “ghetto” area since a lot of drug deals and very sketchy shit happens there at least from what my mom tells me. She used to work there in a small dentist off to the side. A lot of creepy shit would happen and it got to the point where someone tried to get into the place while she was cleaning and it clearly was closed. (That’s a story for another time perhaps) moving on- there was a cafe at the bottom that had newly opened and our class was brought inside to have a chill break.

Once inside I started to notice how tense the atmosphere was and all the people there where grown adult men that looked very rough and had this look of ‘yeah I’m glaring at you so what??’ Idk how to explain it but it was very off putting.

They had a small bar and there where a bunch of couches and sofas off to the side. Next to the bar in the very back was a door which you couldn’t see at first from just the outside. You’d have to really go in to actually notice the door.

I started snooping around, I felt like there was something more to this and ended up in front of that door. The door suddenly swung open and a tall bigger guy looked down at me. He was bald wore a light brown leather jacket and that this dark grim look on his face. It felt like he was looking right through me and could read my thoughts. It sent shivers through my whole body and I could feel my finger tips getting cold and palms sweaty.

“ come in “ he said with this sharp blood curdling grin plasters onto his face. However before I could even answer our teacher sudden loudly stated “ alright time to go “ and everyone started packing their stuff. I turned around and instantly went to pack my stuff without question. I had the scene I just went through play over and over in my head I just could not stop thinking about it.

Time passes on and the days go by quite fast. I eventually passed the classes and everything returned to how it was just without those classes,,, or so I thought.


A week after, I woke up in a sweat in my room. It was quiet and from the looks of it it was still night. I could not move and the air felt so thick I thought I’d choke any second. The light from the moon shines in giving a small light source. I felt a deep dark presence right at the foot of my very bed. I wanted to scream but nothing came out.

My brain started trying puzzling things together as to who this might be, then my heart suddenly felt like it had dropped into my stomach. This feeling, this tense air- it was him! The man I met at the door.

My door swung open as my mother rushed to me asking “what is wrong? Why are you crying so loudly?” As she rushed to hug me. I touched my face letting out a small ‘huh?’ As I feel tears rushing down my face. I looked back to where the once Stood but he was long gone.

Years later after that night me and my mother where sitting at our dining table. She started chatting to me as I was eating my cereal.

Mom: “do you remember church classes?”

Me: “yea?”

Mom: “ remember that one day you told me about ur day and how you went this one cafe?”

I nodded as kept eating listening to hear chatter on

Mom: “ days later after you visited that cafe it turns out that they did child trafficking and what not. They stormed the place. Found a bunch of kids in another part of the cafe. They’re still looking for a guy.”

She slid over a news article with the guys face on the front cover. I kid you not when I tell you my blood felt like it went into deep freeze mode. Ther he was the same fucking guy I met at the door, THE SAME FUCKING GUY that was at the end of my bed.

The same guy that could have taken me behind that door.

I know this wasn’t such a long scary story but it still makes feel very uneasy.

Needless to say I wonder what I would have seen behind that door and what would have happened if I did follow him. The guy was never caught. I just happened to be remembering this as I hear the church bells off in the distance.

Hello, here I am writing about this, a truly horrific experience I’ve had. I was 15, my dad was on a business trip for a week. We have a lot of guns. I was home alone, upstairs playin Xbox all day. With my friends. Hopped on black ops 2 zombies together. My mother left me, no stepmom, so it was just me at home 

The first 3 days were chill. I woke up, did some laundry, cleaned up the living room. I did everything that I felt like doing around the house until I got that “hop on the game” text message from my homies in a group chat. Every time we would die playing transit, we would get pissed. About every 4 times we failed, I let my dog outside. He had a ranged a shock collar, so I didn’t have to worry about boundaries, and I would let him in a couple minutes later, he would be set, I would feed and water my dog and cat, and go play the game. 

The fourth day, something strange happened. It was about 10:30 at night, in a drug addicted town. I was in the kitchen warning up some food to eat during multiplayer with my friends on Minecraft, we had a huge server. Food was just put in the microwave and my dog went APESHIT. I wondered what he was barking at, but I ignored it because the dumbass barks at his shadows sometimes. So anyway I let him inside and head upstairs. About a half hour later, I thought I heard something, so I whispered to my friends I would be back on in a sec, muted my headset, dimmed the tv, and listened, I heard someone walking down our porch and running. I immediately called my dad, freaking out. He said he wishes he was home, but not to call the cops because of the fact that it would’ve been a huge deal. Nothing was stolen that I had seen of. 

And then came the 5th day…

A long day, my dogs collar died so I went around town looking for him, eventually caught him. Finished the laundry, played Minecraft and black ops 2 with my friends half the day. At about 11:30 pm I told my friends I was going to bed because I had a lot of chores to do tomorrow. I let our dog outside, let him use the bathroom, and let him inside. Made sure the animals had food and water and headed to bed. 

About 1:40 in the morning I heard footsteps coming up the deck, and sure enough I look out my bedroom window, and there’s the same guy again, but I seen a little shine off of his knife blade from the moon. I scrambled to my closet, grabbed my 20 gauge shotgun, loaded it with a sport shot, and hid in my little cubby. I could hear him breathing and walk around downstairs, I got out of my cubby and peaked out over the banister and he was on his way upstairs, he went through my dads room, my little brothers room, and he was on his way to my room. Could hear his feet dragging, heavy breathing, creepiest thing ever, he started to walk to the opposite side of the room and I stood out and I said “get the fuck out of this house before I paint my wall with your brains”. And he ran after me, I shot him in the knee, but he was still crawling to me, and pulled a little bodyguard pistol with, what I later found out was loaded with hollow points, one shot and I’m dead, I close the closet door, load one more shell and pray to god to forgive me for what I’m about to do. I pop out of the closet and did the most disturbing thing I’ve ever done in my life. I shot him in the head. Blood everywhere. I looked like I showered in it. My green walls turned red. I immediately called the police, and then my dad. I told him what had happened, and he drove here as fast as he could.

I was interrogated at 6 am. I gave them the full story, at about 8:37 am my dad pulled up. Checked on me and made sure I was okay, and we went inside and sat on the couch. I’ll never forget hearing the police walky talkies never stop chattering. They brought it to court the next week, but with enough evidence of self defense, they dropped it with self defense. My dad told
Me he was buying cameras and landline phones, along with a passcode locked front door. I’ll never forget this truly gore story. It’s painted in my mind and I still live with the guilt of killing a man in front of gods eyes. I pray every night for forgiveness. I hope you guys understand I did what I did to save my own life.

[Three Witchy Women.](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/wj852x/three_witchy_women/)

It’s one thing to be alone in the woods with a plan. It’s another to be lost. A lot of soon-to-be dead people don’t get the difference between the two. Either that or they just realize it too late. The tallest mountains and the deepest caves are full of fucking assholes who thought they could do something when they couldn’t. I’ve seen the aftermath myself. Bodies frozen in position… naked from the waist down… eyes still open and staring off into the distance like they’d just seen a friend from work. I didn’t want to be one of them - just another pair of bright pants for the hikers to spot. 

And so I couldn’t save the girl. I could barely save myself. I ran from a killer as fast as the snow banks allowed. I didn’t stop until I reached the burned down remains of the ranger cabin. A familiar log by the aforementioned ravine with three dead wolves felt like home. I collapsed into the bark like a La-Z Boy as a thin trail of smoke receded into the early morning sky. 

It was raining. The lonely patter mixed in with the *cracks* and *groans* of the forest. I tried to forget, if only for a second, just to reset, but that didn’t work. I kept picturing Sue’s face when she saw the animals. The conversation ran over and over again in my head. There was something that went unsaid. I just couldn’t place it.

*You alright?*

*No.*

*Clink, clack, clink.*

*Clink, clack, clink.*

Part of me wanted to quit just then. A larger part was angry. I got up and sifted through the cooled remains of the cabin fire. I found a charred stick (used to turn on an inexplicably high light switch on the wall) and attached it to my knife like a bayonet. I swung into the air to test my weapon on a would-be attacker. The apparatus collapsed.

Great. 

The sun slowly but surely rose in the distance. I guessed the time to be a little before six, maybe later. I figured I had a couple hours before the first rescue crews arrived from the Valley. They might have called folks down from Follaton. Maybe even out in the Hills. Someone should have seen the smoke by now. It wouldn’t be long. 

I still refused to be a sitting duck, primed for murder, so I headed down to the tree-line in search of better weapons. Melted snow clung like butter. It took a while to maneuver. I found a larger branch and set about hollowing a hole for the knife. I wrapped the blade tight with strands of bark and roots. I swung it three times. This time it held. 

I moved on in search of a better tree to scale. My reasoning for climbing was not just that I was good at it - I was great - but the high positioning and downward slope of the path made it possible to see much further ahead than on the ground. After a good hour of searching, I found my target, another massive oak with low hanging branches leveled all the way to the top. I hopped one at a time and made it around three quarters of the way up. 

I could see the hot spring. I could see my own path of footprints. But that was about it. 

A strange but familiar sound echoed in the distance.

*Clink, clack, swoosh.*

*Clink, clack, swoosh.*

The minutes turned into hours. I waited. My plan was pretty simple. If the masked man went this way, I would ambush him. If the good guys arrived, I couldn’t miss them. Time dragged. Every passing glow of sunlight looked like a plane. Every rustle of leaves brought up the stick-blade. I waited and waited some more. Then it happened.

Three hours after my initial descent, something large moved through the woods, big enough to be a person. I crouched behind some leaf covering. I kept still. Footsteps approached twenty yards away. Somebody was whistling. 

I didn’t recognize the song at first. The high notes were wistful and the low notes foreboding. Almost like it might sound better on a flute. I sat there on the branch, like a dumbass, desperately trying to place the tune. Took me twenty years to realize it was Dixie. 

I moved to adjust my footing. 

Something broke. 

I hit the branch below and snapped it upward. I tried to steady myself and flipped. The stick-blade lacerated my leg and caused blood to spill so fast that some of it fell into my mouth on the way down. I must have mashed ten more branches before the last one left me to the ground. 

The next few moments were kinda blurry. I remember feeling for the blood. I remember trying to walk. I couldn’t. I crawled off into some shrubbery and looked for something to stop the bleeding. I didn’t find it. 

Then the lights went out. 

“

More whistling.

The sound of metal connecting with dirt is very distinct up close, but from miles away, it could be anything. At that moment, I recognized it immediately. 

*Clink, clack, swish.*

*Clink, clack, swish.*

Okay. He’s digging my grave. Time to pray.

*Clink, clack, swoosh.*

*Clink, clack, swish.*

“Please…” I mumbled.

“You ‘wake?” he answered.

I couldn’t see the owner of the voice in front of me. I blinked a dozen times. I felt around blindly and my fingers brushed a piece of cloth and knot. He took the time to give me a tourniquet. I relaxed. I opened my eyes again and looked dead into an elaborate horn mask. 

“The fuck?”

I fought with all my might. I got up and darted backwards, slamming into a tree and loosening the tourniquet in the process.

“No-no-no.”

“What? What do you want with me?” I screamed. “You want to kill me?”

“I am notta de bad guy.”

I stared at him. 

“I know I looka like de bad guy,” he chuckled and removed the mask. “This is just for protection. Ima Zak. I-a save your life, my friend.”

I nodded slowly. He looked normal enough. Long black hair. Clean shaven. I couldn’t quite place the accent but my ear for that sort of thing is terrible.

“Looka ‘round you.”

I brushed the silt off my eyes and sat back down. Zak knelt beside me and readjusted the dressing. Blood oozed out spectacularly so it helped to take my mind off the wound.

“Looka all de graves,” he mumbled. “Look at the writing.”

I examined them one by one. Most were single names. Otis. John. Dipper. There must have been thousands of headstones in that one little alcove, jutted purposefully above the snow. Some dated back to the early 1800s. 

“Okay,” I muttered. “Dead people. So?”

Zak shook his head.

“No people.”

I leaned down and brushed some snow to get a better look. There were drawings underneath.

“Jack… the mountain lion?”

I moved onto another. 

“Marcelo the wolf.”

Zak grunted.

“I gotta lil baby squirrel over there.”

I was dumbfounded.

“Why?”

Zak smiled.

“She really lika these animals.”

It didn’t make any sense to me.

“How long has this been here? How did we miss it?”

Zak grunted. 

“We way outsidda patrols now,” he offered.

I stared at him. 

“Who are you?”

He looked back at me for a little while. Something about his clean kept features appeared trustworthy. He sighed.

“Yo friend is a witch.”

I laughed. Zak didn’t. 

“Ima logger. We are-a taking down this here section of wood.”

He gestured behind us.

“And I see dem… *these* three girls, dancing in the woods with de wolves. Dem wolves are fine one moment… calm, docile, the like. Very strange thing to see a big beast cozying up to a woman likka dat. Then they all fall dead. One, two, three. Just like dat. First the wolves, then the girls. Like dominoes. I saw it happen, my friend.” 

“So somebody shot them?”

“No-no, you see the bodies, no bullets. I try-a to show you the wolves. I couldn’t carry de two girls close enough...”

“That was you?”

“Yes.”

“And the fire?"

“I try to warn you!" he exclaimed. "I knock!"

"Some warning," I seethed. "We could have died."

Zak grabbed my arm and squeezed.

“Listen to me. That girl… that girl witchu… she de only one to get up when they fall. The rest of dem stay dead. But that girl get up and walk down to yo cabin like itsa Monday.”

He looked scared.

“She a witch. Through and the through. My best guess is… she sacrificed dem. The wolves and de other girls. She sacrifice dem for the woods. To keep me out.”

I laughed again.

“Susan?”

He nodded.

“If yo’ call her dat,” he mumbled. “I want to know why. So then I come down here and see de graves. She remembers dem. All of dem. Every lil animal. Every bunny she find. How do you think she feels ‘bout me? About de people who take de trees and de homes of bunnies?”

He whimpered a bit. I struggled to believe a word of it. We stood awkwardly for a moment. Zak disappeared into the brush. He returned a couple moments later with the motionless corpse of my coworker. 

“I cut offa de head o' de witch.”

I vomited.

“I’m sorry. But I have experience on dis! Local experience. You gotta trust me. Dis a berry bad girl. A berry, berry bad girl."

Zak pushed back Sue's hair.

“I see her picture in an old book. A very old, one hundred year old book. But she young like dis,” he continued. "How she stay young like dis?"

The noises of the woods appeared to grow louder. I stared blankly into Susan’s lifelessly pretty eyes. I thought about our conversation only a couple days prior. *He knows.*

“Okay.”

I still didn’t believe this story. Not a word of it - as you probably don’t. I knew we were destroying evidence. I knew ‘dis guy’ could still be ‘de bad guy’ and all of his plans could just be a ruse to let my guard down before the rescue crews arrived. But I thought I’d play the little game. I thought I’d bury poor Sue’s head (they could always retrieve it later) and use the newfound trust to mount my revenge. That was my plan - just as you might expect - right until the moment she blinked. 

That’s right. 

The fucking head blinked. 

I thought it was a trick until Zak saw it too. He screamed. He grabbed the mask (sorry, no good explanation for that yet) and set it on his face before he took off into the woods. 

Susan’s eyes strained and looked around after him. Then they found me. Her lips smiled. Fresh blood dropped down from the gash in her forehead. She licked it. 

I watched in horror as the head dribbled along the ground, as if moving on imaginary legs, towards the torso in the grass five feet away. 

I didn’t wait for it to reattach. 

I ran too. 

Again. Because that’s what a real person does when faced with the inexplicable. Fight or flight might favor the bold when granny is confronted by a mugger. But the instinct definitely does not cater to bouncing heads and human sacrifices. I ran until my legs couldn’t carry me anymore. I ran through snow and sitting water. I ran up ravines and down hills and kept going after my legs screamed from the pressure. I ran into the God-blessed ambulance waiting at the charred remains of my cabin. I babbled this exact story to every medic and doctor and police officer who asked it of me.

How do you think it went? 

“

The doctors gave me a bloated IV and a battery of little white pills. The police hooked me up with an arson charge. I bounced from hospitals to psych wards to county jail. I lost touch with my limited family. My work friends excommunicated me. When I got out, I got a place by the beach, away from the woods. I took up fishing.

There’s probably one detail you’re wondering about, if you’re still with me, and it’s the same one that extended my stay in Valley General. 

*Where are they?* 

I used to ask anyone who would listen. 

*What the fuck happened to Susan? What happened to Zak? What happened to the women?*

I couldn’t understand why they weren’t looking. Regardless of how they felt about my mental state, these were still missing people out there, four of them in total. Their loved ones should be concerned. They should be blaming somebody (probably me) for their deaths. But nobody cared. 

One night, a detective visited me in jail. He didn’t have any reason to lie, I guess. The case was over. The state won. He told me that his office didn’t have any records for a girl named Susan at the Parks Department. There also weren’t any local logging companies with current bids. But they did have one, twenty years back, where a guy went missing on the job.

“A foreign guy. Strange accent. They didn't have good paperwork on him. Went out into the woods one day and never came back. I talked to the manager, the guy’s still alive….. And they said his name was Zak.”

He hesitated.

“I’m not saying I believe this shit. But I’ve lived in White Valley long enough to know about the Witch. If you really say you saw her…  really saw her… I’ll tell the judge to go easy.”

And so they did, 

“

A few years later, two papers arrived in my mailbox. The pages were unaddressed and missing an envelope. The first piece was a Kodak picture of Zak - or at least - what used to be Zak. His face was cut down the center and his ears were missing. The second piece was a poem. It’s titled,

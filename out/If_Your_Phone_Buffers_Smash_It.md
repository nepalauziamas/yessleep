If your iPhone begins buffering randomly, do yourself a favor and just throw it away and fast. Let me explain.

I work for the government. I can’t say what branch or anything out of fear they’ll catch on to me but I’m definitely not a higher up. Just a technician. But I know far more than I’m supposed to.

There’s a secret facility in the small bumfuck nowhere town of Columbus, Mississippi where an experiment with smart phone cameras is being worked on. We all have heard the stories of people covering their laptop cameras with tape so the government can’t watch them. Even Mark Zuccerburg does this. And those people might seem to most like some crazy nut jobs but they’re not.

Most people think that if the government were using cameras to watch people they’d have been doing it for a while and there’s no need to worry now right? Well technically they have been, but it’s different now. Before it was quite a lengthy process for them to actually be able to spy on someone through phone cameras believe it or not so unless you were a high value target it wasn’t worth the legal and technical trouble. But now the U.S government and Apple are in cahoots and a multi-billion dollar deal is being made to allow the Government to use a new software called G.P.S.S. This is an acronym for Global Phone Surveillance Software. It’s also called the GlassFruit Program. It’s already being implemented on newer phones and old phones will be receiving it when they update IOS 16 whenever it finally launches.

I assume eventually it will be patched, but as for now the only way to tell if they’re watching you live in that moment is, regardless of what app you’re currently on, it will freeze for about a second or two and the sound will either distort or just pause. After that, whatever you’re watching on Pornhub or Netflix or whatever will continue as normal, but they’ll be able to watch and hear anything around your phone. In Columbus, they have a team of roughly 750 workers sit there and randomly connect to phones around the country and some times the globe to try and catch criminals or just find whatever else they might need to know.

A quote-unquote buddy of mine from work told me all this the other day. I thought he’d finally fell off his fucking rocker but a few days later he disappeared and there’s been absolutely no investigation into what happened. After doing days of research I have no doubt in mind his disappearance was because of this.

I’m taking a trip to Columbus myself tomorrow so I’ll try to update when I can. I need to rest for now though if I even can.

Just keep in mind that they’re watching. If you’re a true law abiding citizen with absolutely nothing to hide from the Government or even your family, then I guess you have nothing to worry about. But if you got anything at all that you’d rather the feds not find out, then don’t say I didn’t warn you when you get busted here soon.

Just stay vigilant and maybe don’t use a goddamn iPhone.

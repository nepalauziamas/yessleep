I hate having to travel suddenly but unfortunately my work requires me to travel every now and then without informing me prior enough to give me some time.I am constantly annoyed by this but since I have to put bread on my table and since I am paid fairly good,I manage to get along with it.This was one such occassion.I was informed only the day before that I had to make this journey.It was a longer journey that usual which required me to spend a night in the train.While I absolutely hated trains,It was too expensive for me to look for other means.So train it was and I immediately booked a train which would leave the station near me at evening 7:00 and reach my destination at 9:00 am the next day.

When I reached the Station at 6:40,the train was already there.Very few people were in the station.I decided to waste no time and entered the train and began searching for my cabin. Finally I found it.There was a list pasted on it's door,stating the names of passengers that would be inside it.There were only two of us,the other one a woman named Sarah Fledger.I would've liked it more if it was just me alone but usually a cabin would be shared by 3 or 4 people and this time I only had one co passenger.I was happy.As I entered,I saw her sitting by the windowside opposite to my seat.She was startled by my entry and she managed to give me a weak smile.Her eyes looked tired.Her hair was messy.She sure is going through something.I thought in my head.

There was an uncomfortable silence between us.After the train started moving,I noticed that tears were flowing down her eyes.I couldn't ignore.I asked her if she was okay and she told me she wasn't.Me being the empath I was, couldn't bear seeing her in that state.I hugged her and comforted her and we bonded over the journey.

 That's when she shared her story and just like I suspected she really was going through something.Her husband was abusive.She showed me the bruises on her arms.She had no job or income as he never allowed her to work anywhere.her family did not support her.She continued tolerating the abuse because she had no support or financial means to escape or file a case.recently he threatened to murder her and that's when she decided to escape.That is how she ended up on this train on the way to her aunt's house who was always kind to her.She was still crying while sharing all this and I assured her if she needed any help while she was at her aunt's place, she could call me and gave her my address.She thanked me and we both drifted off to sleep as time was getting closer to midnight.

I woke up around 7 am the next morning.I was surprised to see Sarah's berth empty.At first I thought she might have gone off to the bathroom or something,but soon I realised she wasn't in that train.She must've got off at somewhere.She probably didn't want to wake me and I felt sad that I couldn't say bye to her.

That was when I noticed her luggage bag still inside our cabin.It was a fairly big bag.why would she leave it here and get off? I wondered and went near the bag and pulled it towards me.i felt it to be too heavy and as soon as I pulled I noticed something dark underneath it,dark and liquid like to be exact.I went white in horror when I realised what it was,the bag was sitting in a puddle of dried blood.I sat back on my seat trying to process what I just saw.i thought about the story of her abusive husband and what she suffered.i put two and two together and had my answer.it could be his body inside the bag.She must've killed him and cut him up and was now going off to escape.I felt like puking at the thought of a dead body inside that bag.

I didn't know what to do and after quite a while of thinking I decided to call the police because I did not want anyone to associate the bag with me and also they would find out sooner or later,and it was better to let em know about this now coz even if they catch her,she can tell them all about her abuse and what lead her to do this.I hoped she would get justice if she's caught now than later, because then she will get the image of a criminal that went hiding after murdering her husband,and she would have a hard time proving the abuse.When the police came,I told them all about it and they assured me they'll investigate the case and shifted me to a new cabin.

As I sat shaking still thinking about her and the bond we shared,an officer barged inside.His face was pale.He told me Sarah Fledger's husband was confirmed to be murdered.Then he looked into my eyes straight and said the next words that made my blood run cold.Sarah fledger was dead too and her body was missing.

I couldn't believe my ears.I asked him how that was possible as I travelled with her and he replied I must've travelled not with Sarah fledger but with her murderer disguised as her.They were right.Sarah's body was found cut to pieces inside that bag.I was too shocked to even believe what happened.I shared an entire journey with a murderous psychopath.i called in to work and told them I couldn't come as I was really sick and fortunately,they understood.I went immediately back home.

As I was on train back home,I received a call from an unknown number but when I picked it up I recognised the familiar voice.
"Thank you so much for giving me your address.I was wondering where I would go next.I really like you .come home fast.i will be waiting." 

I couldn't believe my ears.i was shaking in fear.i immediately called the police and told them about the call.They promised me they will go over to my house.nothing happened.She was never found nor caught.I spend few days in a hotel room and moved to a new house in a new city.Changed my number too.I still don't feel fully safe.She could be out there looking for me or she might be after some new victim now.You can never be sure.Please lock your door and watch out for every sound.She could show up anywhere.Maybe at my doorstep or maybe at yours.watch out.

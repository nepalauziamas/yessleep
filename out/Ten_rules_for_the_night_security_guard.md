You ever see an opportunity, and think “that’s too good to be true”? Read through the fine print, find out more about it, waiting with bated breath for when it turns out you’re right? Here’s a piece of advice I’ll give ya, I’m sure you’ve heard it before, I did too yet here I am now: when something seems too good to be true, it is.

Here I am now. Nine more hours sitting at this desk watching security feeds, then I get to go home and wonder why the fuck I believed that this overpaid and seemingly easy security position didn’t come with a catch, why I didn’t notice all the red flags in between seeing the offer online and getting here. Why I genuinely believe I’ll be lucky to have the chance to regret my decision after my shift.

Let’s go back to earlier today. There I was, switching between browsing reddit and flipping through local job offers, when a refresh of a local job listing site revealed something new that caught my eye. A basic security position - job description basically amounted to locking the doors at night, watching cameras, and calling the the company if anything bad happened. And in the description, they said that they would pay $37 an hour. I was immediately skeptical of the high wage for a basic security job, especially considering the company had next to no info on it on the web - their small website had pictures of the founders and outside of their buildings, but didn’t even say what they did. However, I had the qualifications from a class I’d taken a year ago, and the possibility of walking away with $300 for a night’s work seemed enticing even if it might have been a scam. I figured it couldn’t hurt to send in a resume and see what happened.

I got a call from a private number not an hour after submitting my application. The conversation was odd: the person on the other end of the line seemed like they had no experience hiring people before, and their voice seemed somewhat stressed and worried - a couple more red flags, but I was still in the “it could be legit, and if it’s not I haven’t lost anything” mindset. I’ll try to recreate the phone conversation here:

“Hello, um, is this Christopher?” said the voice on the other end.

I replied, “Yes, speaking. Who is this?”

“This is, uh, I work for [company] inc. I’m, um, I’m Daniel Edwards, head of sec- head of HR. Uh, former head of security. I’m calling because, uh, because you submitted an application to us.” Daniel paused. I waited expectantly for him to continue, but when the silence dragged on a moment too long I realized he was done speaking.

“What about my application?”

“Oh, uh, we’d like you to come for an, um, an interview. Your credentials looked, well, looked good, yeah. Can you come to [address] in two hours?” I was surprised, it seemed to me like either a) it was a scam or b) they needed the position filled fast, maybe even by tonight. If it was the latter, I was pretty sure I could talk them up to an even higher wage, so I made my decision there - I’d check out the address on google street view and see if there was any other info on it before I went there, and if it seemed off I just wouldn’t show up for the interview.

“Sure thing. Thank you.” Daniel hung up the phone before I even finished speaking.

Fast forward to two hours later, I was arriving at a fenced-off property in my city’s industrial district, occupied by two buildings. They bore minimal markings and logos but appeared to be in fair condition (and supposedly still belonged to the company I was going there to see). I pulled my 2001 Honda Civic through the gate and into the parking lot. Something felt slightly off right away, though I didn’t pick up on what it was until later - the parking lot was empty except for one other car.

I stepped out and walked into the larger 1-story building facing directly onto the parking lot. The door was unlocked. The receptionist’s desk sat empty, and I recall noticing that there was dust on the blades of the fan that sat there. There was no email address in the post on the job site, and Daniel had called me from a private number. Unsure what to do, I waited in the small lobby for a few minutes and looked around at my surroundings.

The entrance was a single glass door, and the front wall was made up of floor-to-ceiling windows. A metal shutter system rested on the outer wall above the glass, and a control panel on the wall inside. The receptionist’s desk sat against the wall opposite the door. On either side of the room were eight chairs and two small coffee tables, complete with old magazines. To the left, a short hallway led past a single door on either side, terminating at a heavy unpainted metal exterior door bearing dents of various sizes and shapes. For some odd reason, the exterior door made me feel uneasy. All three doors contained a single small window, the kind with wire mesh inside it, obscured by black paint or cloth on the inside. To the right led another hall - oddly enough, I can’t recall the length, and I usually have good attention to detail. Was it four doors on either side? No, two? Sixteen maybe? I’m not even sure it had a length. I didn’t look at the end of the right hallway. Behind the receptionist’s desk was another longer hallway terminating in a T-intersection. The first door on the left was made of brown painted metal and bore a small placard of “SECURITY OFFICE.”

After waiting for a minute, a man rushed in through the front door.

“Sorry to have kept you waiting. I’m Joshua Collins, head of HR.” He spoke quickly and seemed frantic and skittish - he didn’t hold eye contact for more than a second at a time. As he shook my hand, I could feel that his palms were sweaty and cold.

“Christopher Newman.” I paused for a second, suddenly hit by a wave of skepticism, and decided to test if he could keep his story straight “I spoke to a man named Daniel Edwards on the phone, I thought he said he was the head of HR.”

Joshua ignored me and continued, “Mr. Newman, my company needs a new security guard fast, the last two quit this morning and we can’t afford to go a night without someone watching the property. We’ve tried to get you here as fast as possible because you’ll need to be ready to work by sunset. We’re in a rush so we’ll skip the usual process, if you’re able to start right now then you can consider yourself hired. Your salary is thirty-seven dollars an hour, non-negotiable. Sign this NDA and you can start right now.”

I didn’t like how aggressive he was being, but it had showed that I was right - they were looking for a fast, probably temporary hire, and I wasn’t about to turn down that kind of money. I flipped through the NDA - it was a long one so I skipped most of it, but I know how these contracts are: don’t disclose company secrets, yadda yadda. I signed it and followed Joshua to the security office.

The orientation was short and simple: “Here’s your keychain, this one opens the door to the security office, this one opens most of the other offices, this one controls the shutter on the front windows. Here’s your maglite, you can use it as a baton in a pinch but you’re better to lock yourself in the office and call us if you see anything suspicious. All you have to do is sit in that office and watch the camera feeds, you don’t need to patrol since you don’t have a partner to watch the feeds when you’re gone. We don’t provide a uniform, just put your badge on your shirt. Front door’s the only one that’s unlocked right now, ignore the other exterior doors and the offices in the long hallway. Lock the front gate. That’s it.”

“What’s this binder for?” I asked, pointing at a white binder on the desk, bearing the company logo. 

“Oh, um, uh, read that during your shift.” Joshua looked uncomfortable at the mention of the binder, and avoided my gaze as he stammered out his reply. He didn’t wait to see if I had further questions before he hurriedly left, getting into the only car in the parking lot (apart from mine) and speeding off.

I assumed my security guard role right away - I went outside and locked the gate, closed the metal shutter over the front glass, and locked the front door. Then I sealed myself in the security office and opened the binder up.

That binder is what prompted me to write this down. When I opened it, I expected a long, boring write-up of company policy involving various situations that may happen after hours - specific rules for dealing with burglars and vandals, you know, that sort of thing. Instead, there was only one page. What was on that page made me realize that this job was, in fact, too good to be true, and is why I'm genuinely terrified right now.

I have nine hours left in this shift. I’d rather walk out of here broke than stick around for the rest of the night, but the instructions made it clear that I’ll have to stick it out til morning. Wish me luck.

UPDATE: It's 2:15 am. It's been fairly uneventful so far, and I hope I don't jinx it by saying that. I've just stayed in the office and split my time between watching security camera feeds and browsing reddit to calm my nerves. It's demon coffee time in two minutes, the cup is already in place and I'm hoping everything goes well.

UPDATE 2: 3:30 am. Demon coffee disappeared after being left outside the door. I heard something knocking and scratching at the door during the time I was told to keep it closed, though I wasn't able to see it on the cameras (the only one watching the office door started showing the long hallway and I had to turn it off). There's a persistent shadow in the corner of the room, that seems darker than a normal shadow. It doesn't go away even when I shine my flashlight right at it. The instructions didn't say anything about a shadow, so I'm just going to not touch it and occasionally check to see if it changes size or moves or anything. Still haven't heard the woman's voice. I could've sworn I glimpsed a humanoid figure on the building 2 cameras a few times, though I can't find it when I inspect the feeds more closely. I no longer have even the slightest doubt that this place is haunted as shit.

UPDATE 3: 4:29 am. I was feeling pretty shaken so I didn't write this up immediately, but here's basically what happened. I'll put it in more detail in my next post. At 3:45, I heard the woman's voice. I was going to ignore it until 4:02, but it got louder and louder until it hurt, and I gave in. She invited me in, but I heard the male voice as soon as I sat down and I ran back to the office. As for what happened at 4:01... I'll write that up later, I'm still really shaken by it. I'll just say I was glad for the reinforced metal door on the office, and that I really, really regret taking this job.

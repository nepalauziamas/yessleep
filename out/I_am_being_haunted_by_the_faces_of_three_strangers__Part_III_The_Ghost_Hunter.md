*Dear mom,*

*I have so many things that I want to tell you, that I’ve been* *meaning* *to tell you. But for some reason I’ve never been able to bring any of them up in conversation...the process of trying has been painful and ruthlessly frustrating. So instead, I’ve decided to try and fix this sorry situation by writing a letter.*

*I know that you’ve not been well lately, and that being hospitalized for the second time in six months drove you close to crazy. How could it not?! So in terms of the timing in me telling you all of this…well, it probably could’ve been better. (How very typical of me, huh?) But I have made a promise to myself that I am going to be more open, honest, and transparent with you going forward, about* *everything,* *good and bad. And that starts right now.*

*Some mornings I don’t feel like getting out of bed. Other mornings I literally can’t. I know that there is a history of anxiety in the family, but this is, well, different. If I’m not in constant pain, I’m numb. And that’s about the best I can hope for it seems. School life is miserable, though I don’t think I’ve let you catch on to that.*

*I’m sure by now you’re wondering,* *why?* *What could possibly be causing this pain, this unhappiness? The answer is probably one that will startle you. But it’s the truth. Jed Lowry. He’s not the person you think he is. He’s a two-faced liar. He seems to take great pleasure in doing terrible things to me. Intimidating me, physically and mentally…making me feel like the lamest, most useless and cowardly wretch in the whole wide world. This morning was the breaking point. I honestly thought he was going to kill me. For a few terrible moments, I almost wish that he had.*

I can’t tell you how many years it had been since I last thought about this letter. Fifteen? More? It never made it into my mother’s hands. Her condition quickly worsened after I’d finished writing it, and within two weeks she was gone. She died completely unaware of what her son had been going through every time I stepped onto the school bus outside our home each morning. For the best, maybe? I’m not sure. 

Last night, during the precious few hours of sleep I managed to get, this first portion of that soul-bearing letter pulsed as fresh in my mind as it did the day I spent writing it. I still don’t know exactly why.  

\*

Exhausted and battling the transition from still tipsy to straight-up sick-as-a-dog hungover, I stared at the book’s new entry for at least twenty seconds before realizing what it was. No map this time. 

t\*\*\*e.net/userikestoom

A link to a user on a popular video streaming website. Looking up the page, I came across the profile of Ike Stoom, whose channel was dedicated to paranormal investigations. The videos varied in length—some were several hours long, while others were more like 15-minute “highlight reels” condensing the  investigations. Not having close to enough time to take a deep dive into this guy fumbling around abandoned buildings, I skipped through bite-size clips which revealed little to me other than Ike Stoom had not been quite so (for want of a significantly better word) fortunate as I in tracking down legitimate instances of the supernatural, or at least capturing convincing evidence of them. The kid had been at this for at least a year, had less than 100 subscribers, and some of the videos barely managed to score double-digit views. But there was no mistake—this was the same person that was now strewn across my kitchen ceiling. 

Taking a closer look at Ike’s profile, I noticed that there had recently been an active livestream, started sometime during the previous night, although it cut off after only 7 minutes of streaming. I switched attention to Ike’s previous video, THE OLD THATCHER HOUSE - LIVE INVESTIGATION, which had scored significantly more views than all other uploads. As I started watching my suspicions were confirmed—it was a supposedly haunted property on the outskirts of town, one of its oldest surviving buildings. 

Though a jolly picnic on a sunny afternoon compared to my past few days, Ike did a solid job selling any hint of curious activity, as did his co-investigator, Patrick. But after skimming through the video there was certainly nothing beyond the “ghost” footage caught on nanny cams, doorbell monitors, or any of those other things that pop up on the news every so often. Figuring I might’ve missed something interesting or perhaps even relevant, I decided to disregard a longstanding oath of mine and read the viewer comments. The top three or four of them were all along the same lines: “Dude, what the hell was that thing behind you on 1’03”?!” I scanned back through the investigation to the timestamp in question, and to my surprise, there did appear to be something unusual captured. Nothing obvious at first, but paying closer attention to the footage, the dark outline of what looks like a tall, scrawny man appears to get up from the ground behind Ike, and after doing so, his physical appearance makes a jerky transition into...something? A formless blob that retreats back into the shadows.

The comments that followed soured my already delicate mood. A couple remained focused on Ike’s creepy capture, but others—actually, most of the others—were what led me to enforce a pledge of ignorance to Internet commenters in the first place. “You’re full of shit, fat man.” “Fake as hell, loser.” “I’m surprised you didn’t collapse after running away from that slamming door, chunky bitch.” Gratuitous cyber bullying 101. It appeared Ike had made a valiant attempt to delete as much of the abuse as possible, but due to the sheer volume such efforts were in vain. Perhaps against his better judgment, Ike replied to one of the principal trash talkers, writing, “F you, Mason. Why can’t you just leave me alone?” Naturally, this did not end well. I’ll spare you the details. 

Slamming my laptop shut in disgust, I noticed an object sitting on my coffee table—a small, very round rock, strangely smooth, but otherwise unspectacular in every way. Along with the bronze dagger and the book, I stashed it into my jacket. Not having ever seen it before, I assumed it was the “tool” that was meant to help me with this second phase of the Mission, although resembling something one would consider playing beer pong with, it didn’t offer much in the way of protective confidence. Was what Ike captured on camera something to do with whatever he was now going through? Did something unwelcome follow him home from the old Thatcher House? Weblink aside, the book was bereft of fresh information. I thought about writing in it for a few moments, asking for at least a little more help, feeling brutally unprepared for this next step. I decided against it. 

\*

Using a website of questionable legality, it wasn’t difficult to use Stoom’s IP address to pinpoint his residence. He’d used the same one when uploading most of his videos, so I figured it a fairly safe bet that this would be the place he called home.

The property was a tall, narrow townhouse in a quiet suburban neighborhood close to where I was raised. The minuscule front yard was alarmingly unkempt, the pathway running through it spouting close to a botanical garden’s worth of vegetation. Standing at the front door, its weathered yellow paint chipped, cracked, and flaking all over the front step, I rang the doorbell, knocked the front window a couple of times, and even tried calling out for Ike directly. I received no response. There was a slender, junk-filled alleyway running down the side of the house, and halfway down it a small staircase leading to the building’s basement. The door was locked, but its hazy windows were already cracked and brittle. I took a deep breath...*was I really going to break into someone’s house?*

Understanding that I didn’t have much in the way of a choice, I scoured the surrounding property and alleyway to make sure no one was around. There was every chance that I’d already been spotted and breaking the window to force entry would result in the cops’ imminent arrival, but that was a problem I’d simply have to deal with if it materialized. A single blow with a small rock was enough to punch a hole in the old glass, and after a few moments of fumbling around I was able to unlock the basement door. I stepped inside, taking long, deep breaths to try and settle down the fiery spurts of adrenaline fueling my otherwise tired and beaten body. I was able to find a light switch, and on the other side of the damp, dingy basement was another staircase, leading up to the first floor of the house. I marched through several large puddles of what I hoped was water and headed on up. 

The kitchen wasn’t in much better shape than the basement, the small breakfast table littered with filthy plates and empty soda cans, the sink piled high with what looked like the remnants of a particularly sloppy feeding time at the zoo. If there was no-one home, Ike and whomever else lives here clearly did not place much emphasis on arriving home to a clean, welcoming house. Selection of unpleasant fragrances aside, the whole atmosphere of the place felt…off. It didn’t feel anything like what I’d endured in the maintenance tunnel the previous night; this was different. Raw and emotional. Waves of sadness suddenly overcame me as I pushed further into the sparsely decorated, tight and narrow house. I again started to breathe heavily, dangerously so. But this wasn’t adrenaline I was dealing with. Not any more. Incapacitating bolts of anxiety threatened to shut down my brain. “Ike? Are you here?” I barely recognized my own voice as I feebly called out, its cadence rippled and warped with panic. *What was going on? Why was I feeling like…*

*Like…*

A blinding flash of light.

Then, *a flood of memories.* But none of them were mine. 

Against my will, my attention was directed to one memory in particular. I was standing in the middle of a field, nothing around but trees, hedges, and the remnants of an old farmhouse that had burned down years prior. I could see Ike—he looked a few years younger than he appeared in his recent videos, pinned down in a muddy ditch by two kids around the same age. His knees were slowly sinking into a slick, sludgy stream of shit-brown water. Ike was crying, *ugly crying*, pleading with these two scumbags to let go, to let him get up and leave, but they were in no mood to let that happen. The bigger kid, a thick mop of ginger hair flopping around his head, piercing green eyes filled with cruel excitement and a lust for pain, grabbed the back of Ike’s head and pushed him closer and closer to the stream. Ike was screaming now, tears spurting out of his face like a busted fire hydrant, snot bubbling uncontrollably from both nostrils. The kids didn’t care. They thought it was hilarious. Once his head was completely submerged, Ike’s body started to thrash uncontrollably, the kids struggling to keep him under their control. But through demented determination they did. 

After an uncomfortably long time, they pulled Ike’s head up out of the water. He tried drinking in massive gulps of air, but the dirt, frog spawn, and whatever else was mixed in with the water now sloshing around his lungs made that very difficult. The other kid—short, scrawny, shaved head—suggested they let the fat kid go. That he’d had enough. His friend scoffed at such a prospect, clearly not close to done here. Ike’s head disappeared beneath the brown sludge for a second time, but it wasn’t until the third that he went limp. Ginger and skinhead were moderately concerned by this development, though not sufficiently so to try helping him. These morons wouldn’t know what CPR was if it straight up kicked them in the balls. Ginger started to poke his prey with the toe of his boot. Ike eventually started to splutter, Skinhead relieved to see this. Ginger simply rolled his eyes and started wandering off, his pal following him. Ike started to cough up more gunk and water, before his breathing finally settled into a normal rhythm. He again started to sob, and so did I.

The memory faded away as quickly as it came on. I opened my eyes and wiped away the tears. I was still in Ike’s house. Upstairs now, in his bedroom. I had no recollection of walking up there. It was exactly what you’d expect from a teenager’s room—Playstation menu screen locked on a large screen TV, clothes strewn everywhere, the stale, lingering scent of adolescent BO. 

Another pang of anxiety. And another. They felt like body blows delivered by a heavyweight boxer. More memories were attempting to gatecrash my mind, and I was fighting with all I had to keep them out. I had to get out of that place, and fast. *Triggered* is the understatement of the year.

The Bearer’s Vision. There was no other explanation for what was happening. It was allowing me to see more…FORCING me to see more. Get inside the heads of those I’m tasked with helping. Live some of the worst moments of their lives, it seems. I closed my eyes for a moment, as if to try and detect the onset of any further assaults. To concentrate on blocking them out before they can even happen. Nothing more came to me. Not yet. 

Exiting the bedroom and heading back down the stairs (knowing full well I was leaving without having found any kind of clue as to where Ike might be), I hurried through a mudroom that I must have passed through on my way upstairs, stepping over multiple pairs of kicked-off boots and bags of trash that were almost pleading to be taken out, and into a cramped living room packed and piled high with boxes and other clutter. I heard a slight yet incessant tapping coming from inside the walls, appearing to follow me as I worked my way around. Rodents, maybe? The house was in diabolical shape, so it certainly wouldn’t be much of a surprise. *Tik-tik-tik-tik-tik-tik-tik-tik.* I shuddered to think what might be scuttling around on the other side of the flimsy drywall. 

“Are you looking for Ike?” Though far from sinister, the voice made me nearly leap out of my skin. “I can’t find him, either.”

A teenager, 17, maybe 18, pencil thin and wearing clothes at least two sizes too big (I think intentionally) picked himself up out of a chair in the living room as he spoke. I hadn’t noticed him there before, though my frazzled nerves had doubtless skewed my sense of perception. 

“I’ve been waiting for him all morning. His mom ain’t here either, and she never usually leaves the house. Laziest person I know, as if the state of this place didn’t give that away. But shit, I thought he’d be back here by now.”

It was Ike’s co-investigator, Patrick. “When did you last see him?” I asked, looking him up and down. 

“Last night. We were on an investigation. It went wrong, man. It went *real* bad.”

“The live stream you started?” 

“Yeah. The old Chesterfield hospital, next town over.”

I knew the place. Derelict for years, since at least the mid-90s. Urban exploring hotspot, so it made sense to be a prime location for paranormal investigators also. “Tell me everything you can,” I said. “I promise, this is really important.” 

“Well, we were there and I guess they followed us. Mason and Jay, two pricks from school. They’ve been giving us shit for years, but Ike mainly. Mason has always had it in for Ike.”

I knew this all too well.

“Ike had had enough. I mean, he’s had enough for *ages*, but this time he was gonna do something about it. I didn’t like the idea at all. But he insisted it was what he wanted to do. Ike said it was a *protection spell,* and it would stop anybody from picking on him ever again. And he wanted to stream the whole thing live, y’know, in case we caught something good on video.”

That’s when it happened for the first time. Patrick started to distort…warp. It’s almost like his physical form wasn’t quite tuned in to the right frequency. A glitch in the matrix.

“We started hearing things as soon as we arrived, and kinda knew someone else was there with us. Like the freaky sounds we were hearing, bangs and knocking, all that stuff…it seemed too good to be true. It stopped after a while, so we decided to get on with things and check the place out. We’d been planning the investigation for weeks. We found the old morgue on the lower level—a bunch of other investigators who’d investigated the place had made some crazy captures there. Sick EVPs, full body apparitions, the whole nine yards. And that’s where Ike said he wanted to conduct the ritual. And so we started streaming and Ike got to work.” 

It happened again. But this time Patrick’s face shifted. For a split second his eyes looked wide open, startlingly so, but empty and lifeless. I did all I could to maintain my cool. 

“Couple minutes later we heard the morgue door slam shut.”

“Mason and Jay?”

“Yeah. We were right—they’d been following us the whole time. Heard them laughing after the door closed. Calling us names and shit. I told Ike we had no way of getting out if the door had locked itself, but he wouldn’t stop. Said he’d started the ritual, and he was gonna finish it.” Patrick paused for a moment, looking confused. “And then…damn. That’s where things start to get foggy. Guess it was the stress and all, right? But I remember…I remember our flashlights dying, equipment cutting out, basically all batteries we had with us draining of power. Fucking crazy. We were suddenly in complete darkness, and all I could hear was Ike breathing heavily, sounding really weird. Mason and Jay, I could hear them too. They were still laughing, getting further and further away. It was so dark, man. Couldn’t see your hand in front of your face.”

Another glitch. But this one was accompanied by sharp, penetrating fragments of a vision. A collage of haunting snapshots. Patrick was being attacked by something…a person made of pure shadow. 

“Then I heard another noise. A fucking growl, man, real deep, like a wolf or a bear. Scared the shit out of me, and in a panic I just started running. I must’ve blacked out or something, because I don’t remember getting out of that morgue, let alone actually leaving the joint. I just remember running, running, fucking running. And then I was here.” 

Patrick again looked confused. And scared. Very, very scared.

“I-I’ve been waiting for a while, man. He’s gotta be close. Gotta show up *eventually*.”

“Patrick…”

“But why don’t I remember leaving? It makes no sense. I was in there with Ike, couldn’t see him, but I could hear him, and…”

A guttural scream ripped out. Not from inside the house. From inside my head. It was Ike. The sound was appalling—a manic, full throttle expulsion of immeasurable fear. I glanced back at Patrick. He was gone. 

\*

I arrived at the hospital around a half hour later. A vast Victorian structure, eight stories high and dilapidated in every sense. Not a single window had been spared shattering, while the brickwork was close to completely cloaked in vines and weeds. The main entrance was a huge, imposing archway, sculpted from immense chunks of red stone, seeming more suited to a castle than a medical facility. Stepping inside the place, a suffocating heaviness overcame me—the atmosphere was rancid, dripping with death, along with desperate, futile attempts to combat it. *How many people perished inside this place over the years?* How many suffered, fighting for their final breaths, not knowing what awaited them on the other side? I then started to sense the easing of pain, diminishing as it drifted towards and finally onto a gentle, flowing river of darkness. *Is this what dying feels like?* I couldn’t help but wonder. 

It was happening again—I was losing control. *Attention to the task at hand slipping away*. As if operating on autopilot, powerless to take back the reins of my own mind, I began to hone in on individual people. There were scores of patients for my rogue consciousness to choose from, all having exhausted their final days and closing moments in this place. 

*Mary Talbot, surprised to have made it all the way to her late 80s, is surrounded by family, flooded with love, signing off from this life with utmost fulfillment and overwhelming pride.* *I’ve had a good life, she thinks. I’m not afraid anymore. And Alfred is waiting for me, just like he said he would be. Good ol’ Alfie. The kindest, sweetest man I ever did meet. How I’ve missed him!*

*Meanwhile, Michael Andrew Zielinski, seething with regret, knows that if he’d stopped drinking in his mid-30s, late-30s tops, he wouldn’t be here now, counting down the seconds until he died at age 46 because of complications during liver transplant surgery. Gloria, his estranged wife, is bawling, crying harder than few people in this hospital ever have, knowing it didn’t have to end like this. Their life together didn’t need to have been such a squandered blur of putrid hangovers and missing days. His daughter, Zoe, 14 but significantly smarter and more understanding than many women twice her age, can barely stand to look at her father. Not like this, piss yellow with jaundice and borderline skeletal, any prominent trace of muscle tone or even fat having shriveled away long ago like a slug doused in salt. Toby, barely 2, doesn’t seem to understand what’s happening at all. Lucky Toby.* 

*And then there’s Bill. William Bartholomew Baker. He never did tell anybody where he buried them girls. Two 8-year-old twins, Daisy and Heather, neatly laid out side by side, their hands bound to each other with rope so they’d be together forever. But now Bill is having second thoughts about his silence. He should have told someone what really happened all those years ago. Perhaps if he did he wouldn’t be destined to head where he’s about to. Bill knows the Devil is waiting. Perhaps someone or something even worse. Maybe, just maybe, if he’d told one of the doctors, a nurse, or even his sister where the girls have been hiding their families could’ve finally found some peace and closure. Maybe that one final good deed would have helped negate that bad, bad thing he did the day before his 21st birthday. That blazing hot August afternoon when he lost control after a little too much moonshine with uncle Joe and conceded to his urges.* 

*Bill managed to control them for the rest of his life and never did such a thing again. Unusual for psychopaths to be able to do that, he always told himself. Once they’ve acted in the interests of their most diabolical desires they’ll typically do so repeatedly. Because they can’t stop. They like it too much. But not Bill. He did it once, and that was enough for him. The memories of that day kept him going for the rest of his days. Never quite fulfilled, but at least content. But now is the time where he has to pay. He’s slipping away now. Nowhere near enough consciousness left to tell someone and put this thing right, or at least as right as it can possibly be put at this point. No. The secret is headed to the grave with Bill. And after that, Bill is headed to—*

Deep breath, snapping back to my senses. I wiped the sweat from my face, hyperventilating like crazy, the taste of fresh bile lining my mouth. Fucking hell, those poor girls. I could see what Bill… 

**No**. I had to focus. Somehow control whatever was happening to me. Use this “gift” as it was (I think) intended to figure out and complete my Mission, or else I’d be as dead and possibly as doomed as Bill fucking Baker. 

The blade was now beaming brightly inside my jacket. I’d almost forgotten it was in there. I pulled it out, bathing my surrounding area in a rich, golden glow, penetrating the deep, relentless darkness with surprising efficiency. Remembering that Patrick said the morgue was on the lower level of this crumbling relic, I hurried down a main hallway in hope of finding a staircase. It felt as if I was pushing my way through oatmeal while draped in a weighted blanket, the surrounding air so chokingly oppressive. But I couldn’t worry about that. Nor the whispers that had picked up from all directions as I moved farther down that long corridor leading to who knows where. The voices were getting louder, though I was unable to decipher a single word they were saying. I started to feel pricks on my arms, legs, everywhere, as if I was being stabbed by dozens, maybe hundreds of tiny invisible needles. 

My attention turned to the footsteps, quick and nimble, scampering past me at unnatural speed, some of them taking sharp detours up onto the walls and across the ceiling. I detected movement behind me, but there was nothing there. At least that I could see. But I had the bearer’s vision—surely that meant that I could see everything, right?

*Stop it, Camden.* I kept telling myself this, speaking those three words aloud over and over like a Hail Mary mantra in hope of maintaining focus on the task at hand. *Stop letting this haunted-as-fuck hospital distract you from what you have to do—help Ike. Save him. Screw that up and you’re done for.*

But staying attentive was easier said than done. I was so afraid. It felt like clumps of ice were being forced through my veins—I was absolutely freezing cold, my body temperature plummeting further with each passing step into the bowels of this godforsaken place. Goosebumps blanketing my body, squeezing tighter and tighter against my bones. Part of me wanted to scream aloud, as if to release some of the toxic tension festering inside of me, threatening to take complete control. 

“*I told you*. This is your fault, you fucking idiot. You did this—it’s all on you!”

The voice came from close by. It was fueled with close to as much anxiety as I was feeling. The hallway opened into what looked like a large medical ward, the rusted remnants of cheap beds lining the room’s perimeter, discarded equipment and trash strewn everywhere, walls used as a crumbling canvas for subpar graffiti art and spray-canned words of warning to anyone crazy enough to enter this place voluntarily. In the middle of the room were two teenage boys. I looked closer. That unmistakable mop of ginger hair. The stubbly bald head standing next to him. It was Mason and Jay.

“What are you talking about? I didn’t even want to come here! You were the one that pushed him too far—that *always* pushed him too far! He fucking snapped, man!”

I approached them and cleared my throat. They didn’t acknowledge me. Didn’t even bat an eyelid. Stepping closer, I looked down at the ground and quickly realized what they were arguing about. Two corpses, looking like they’d been scooped up and spit out by a category 5 tornado of machete blades. *The corpses of Mason and Jay*. Deep, wide scratches plundered their bodies, hunks of flesh having been torn from their arms and hands like strips of bacon amidst futile attempts to defend themselves. The boys’ faces were frozen mid-scream, as if sentenced to forever exclaim the unthinkable horror they endured in their final hellish seconds. *Before everything turned from red to black.*

Mason broke down, planting the palms of his hands over his face. “The f-fucking nerd did it. Fucking killed us, man.”

“How did he kill you? What happened here?” The thought suddenly flashed into my mind that I was attempting to have a conversation with my second and third ghost of the day. 

The kids looked at one another, wiping the tears from their faces. They’d heard me this time. Or decided to pay attention.

“I…”

Jay shook his head. “I don’t remember.”

Mason spoke up, looking desperate, battling both terror and confusion. “There’s gotta be something we can do, right? Can you help us? Y’gotta do something to help us!”

I shook my head, making sure to show no emotion (or as little as possible) to these two punks. “No. There’s no one who can help you now.”

Yet another scream. I recognized it by now. Not too far away, perhaps from the bottom of the stairwell I saw up ahead, although with the amount of echo this place provided it was difficult to say with any certainty. In the split second that I was distracted the boys vanished. Only their corpses remained. I asked myself, *should I feel guilty that I’m glad they’re dead?* 

That was an emotional dilemma for me to worry about later. I could still hear Ike. He didn’t sound like he had much left in him.

**\***

“Help me, help me, please, *help me,* please, won’t you help me—” 

Ike’s words were muffled behind the morgue’s rusty steel door. Once unlocked I just about managed to slide it open, my body by this point near sapped of strength. The fear in Ike’s face was remarkable, eyeballs bulging out of his face, eyelids flickering like a broken movie projector. He was huddled in the corner of this dank, appallingly fragrant room, the dagger illuminating it for the first time since the two boys were locked in there. *Quite a lot had happened since then*, I thought to myself. Ike had his back pinned against a wall of refrigeration units once used to store cold, stiff ex-patients. Standing next to him was a tall, dark entity, close to humanoid in terms of height and build, somehow a deeper shade of black than the surrounding shadows shaped by the beam from my blade. Each of its long, fluid arms snaked down into three long claws, ominously misshapen, freakishly oversized, stained and crusted with dried blood. Patrick’s savaged corpse lay on the ground between Ike and I, murdered in similar fashion to Mason and Jay, all life torn from his body by the demon standing not twenty feet away from me. 

“It killed my best friend…it killed Patrick.” There was no emotion left in his voice. The empty, dejected words of a broken young soul. “It doesn’t protect me. It just kills anyone that’s near me.”

The demon appeared to shift slightly. Preparing to make good on Ike’s description of its duties. The concentrated evil I felt radiating from it was indescribable. Ike’s bottom lip quivered uncontrollably, his pleas for assistance having now devolved into muffled, garbled gibberish. The demon lunged towards me—the action was accompanied by the single most terrifying sound I’d ever heard. A rasping, shrieking blast of pure mayhem that made the building quite literally shake from its foundations up, knocking the wind right out of my gut. I stumbled and tripped, landing flat on my back, any hint of breath I had left in me horse-kicked out by the unholy outburst. The demon stood over me now, waiting, as if taking a moment to savor the sight of its pathetic human prey before unleashing a fresh tirade of violence. I tried to get back up and prepare to defend myself as best I could, but my arms and legs had turned to jello. The demon leered one last time, claws ready to start slicing. Tears streamed down my face. I could feel my bladder emptying into my pants, piss streaking down the inside of both of my legs. I was pinned to the ground by pure, concentrated fear. 

*A burning sensation in my pocket.*

I looked over at Ike. All I could see was sadness. His eyes were red raw from crying, a distant, crestfallen glare peering back at me. He knew what came next. Although thanks to the darkness he’d been submerged in before I arrived, this would be the first time he’d actually *see* it happen. 

*Camden, the painful, intensifying fucking burn in your pocket. Focus!*

The rock that I had found next to the notebook earlier. The heat was incredibly intense, by now scorching the skin of my chest through my t-shirt—I reached into my pocket and grabbed it as the demon delivered its first strike, slashing my right cheek wide open, thick globs of blood escaping from my face like liquid seeping from a punctured water bed. Not knowing what else to do, I pulled out the rock and held it up to the demon—the second I did so the demon began to scream once more. It quickly got louder, excruciatingly so, to the point where it induced an instant, blinding migraine. I tried to look up at the demon, see what was happening to make it discharge such a putrefying sound, but my vision was blurred by the pressure building up inside my head. Then, after reaching what can only be described as a climax, the sound rupturing out from the demon suddenly ceased. The barbaric pounding within my skull subsided almost immediately and command of my body appeared to be restored. Slowly but surely I was able to muster the coherence to stand up off the ground. Ike looked around as if to wonder what had just happened, frazzled and confused. 

“I...I don’t feel it anymore. I think it’s left me.” 

He was right. The demon had been detached from him. I glanced down at the stone in my hand, before shoving it back into my jacket. But then I noticed Ike’s face turn once more, filled with yet more horror as he looked at me—I turned around to see the demon hovering over *my* shoulder. Then, I could feel it. I was connected to the beast in every way. It was one with me. What had just happened quickly became crystal clear: *The stone had attracted and absorbed the demon—and by extracting it from Ike, it had now attached itself to me.* 

Fuck.

In the blink of an eye, the demon leapt towards Ike, moving at an astonishing speed, before grabbing hold of and pummeling him into the ground. Like a rabid animal, it started clawing at his face and chest with maniacal intensity, Ike’s crossed arms his sole source of defense, clouds of blood and ribbons of shredded skin filling the air as he screamed once more for help. I was momentarily paralyzed by panic—*what the hell do I do now?* There was only one thing I could do at that moment. A fleeting surge of bravery enabled it to happen, spawned in itself by sheer desperation—I lunged towards the demon, blade of my dagger glistening and pointed downward, and plunged it deep between (what resembled) its shoulder blades, driving the metal as viciously as I could. Another inhuman screech escaped from the demon as I twisted the blade, the intensifying light beaming from the dagger close to blinding. The demon’s shadowy form began to flicker, crack, and then shattered like a dropped tray of glassware, the dark shards dissolving between the cracks of the cold, blood-smeared ground. 

Ike looked at me in disbelief before switching attention to Patrick. His face was a bloody mess, scratches and gashes covering it, but from what I could tell none of the wounds looked too severe—had I acted even a second or two later I doubt I would’ve been able to say the same thing. The butchered remains of Mason, Jay, and Patrick were a testament to that… 

“Are you OK?” I knew as soon as I opened my mouth how stupid my question sounded.

“Thank you,” Ike said, before turning attention back to his deceased friend. He sobbed gently while slowly shuffling towards him, ready to begin mourning. Not wanting to interfere or distract him from this, I left.

Exhausted, hurting, close to defeated, I made it home to find the face of Ike Stoom with a prominent red mark scratched through it. *I’m this close*, I told myself. *I can fucking do this. One more person to help and then I’m free.* Deep down I knew this unexpected lick of positivity was no true representation of the reality I faced—that this next, final challenge would doubtless be the most brutal of them all—yet it left me feeling curious about the Mission as a whole. Why does it exist? Who or what is behind it…? Crazy as it sounds, considering all I’ve been through so far, one of the most intimidating aspects of the Mission has been the nature of its application—it demands that I proactively seek out and combat the cause of (an insane, supernatural) problem. And yet avoiding conflict, or at best shielding myself from it, is an apparent default setting in my DNA. But in possibly the most out of character moment of my life, I had just *attacked* a demon—seemingly obliterated the damn thing, no less—and in doing so, helped save poor Ike Stoom. Perhaps the forced nature of such a stunning moment of stress saw me turn a corner in the handling of confrontation…if so, might that serve as a segue to me attempting to excavate, examine, and maybe even work through my long-buried emotional baggage? There’s certainly no shortage of it to practice on.

I plunged deeper into thought, thinking about how I was carrying this obligation around with me like a bucket of shit, only to have to hand it off to the next poor bastard if I’m even able to get through it. I started to panic all over again—did I dislike anyone enough to do such a thing? To burden them with such unthinkable horror? Now that Jed was dead (and his brother was left looking like a particularly unfortunate incarnation of the Toxic Avenger) I honestly couldn’t think of a solitary soul I’d even dream of “gifting” this insanity to.

But again, this was a problem for another day. And being more realistic, I can’t in this moment of time say for sure that such a day will ever arrive. 

I grabbed the book and placed it down on the kitchen table. After pouring myself a glass of something I wished was significantly stronger, I opened it up and stared at the next available blank page. It was somewhere around the halfway point of my second glass that I finally started writing. *Who controls the Mission?* 

No response.

*If the Mission is about helping people, why does the book only give vague clues and directions? Why not specify details?*

No response.

*Who is the Auditor?*

A gentle glow, followed by a tantalizing sparkle. I held the page—it throbbed slightly between my fingers as words materialized on the crisp yet time-stained paper.

If the bearer successfully completes their Mission they will be rewarded with answers. Until such a time, the bearer is required to fulfill their obligation without the need for explanation.

The appearance of the words produced a flurry of butterflies in my stomach. Freshly etched, each letter resembled a glistening star twinkling in the sky, before depleting of vigor and settling into a scratchy streak of charcoal. *Excitement* seems too strong of a word…insatiable intrigue, perhaps. I forced my fingers to clutch the pages as hard as I could as the last word appeared, captivated by the energy exuded, the supernatural flow intoxicating. My head throbbed with unanswered questions; answers I wanted, no, needed to hear. *Is this book connected to the dead? Can I communicate with them by using it? Can I contact my mother…?*

As I sat contemplating the endless possibilities of the power I had right in front of me, I detected the beginning of another glow, a mere flicker at first, before erupting into stunning, luminous light—a surging supernova beaming out from within the pages, drenching my entire apartment with otherworldly radiance. This was quickly followed by the sound of frantic, maniacal etching from within the book. A blitz of relentless production. I was mesmerized by these impossible sights and sounds, by now weak at the knees under their seemingly divine influence. 

An unknown period of time passed, the situation dwindled and finally settled. I took a deep breath before opening up the book to inspect the yield of whatever it was that I’d just experienced.

It’s been over an hour since I did so. Sitting here and writing this, I still don’t feel ready to return for a second inspection. I am so scared for what comes next. 

If I can somehow get through it I’ll update as soon as I can.

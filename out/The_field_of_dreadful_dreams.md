The time was 6pm, the house was surrounded by fields of corn and beans, swaying in the dark breeze of the night, but the feeling of foreboding was there with the scarecrow standing over the fields, scaring the hardest of person and the toughest animal scurrying. When I awoke that next morning, I was feeling refreshed, ran downstairs to grab my stuff for school and raced out the door for the bus!


When I got home late that afternoon, the scarecrow had moved, but didn't soak in until after dinner. I had asked dad of he had moved it and he said no, even with that quirky grin he always wore after a smile. The next few days passed without any feelings, but that wasn't about to last!

That weekend, I had decided to have a few friends over for a sleepover, and everything was fantastic! These were very close friends and we did everything together, even IF it meant for us to get in some sort of trouble. But that night, all of us were on edge, and none of us knew why! We couldn't get dinner or a snack without doing the quick look over the shoulder. That's when one of my friends noticed the scarecrow, and she was frozen! 

"Hey Jill, that figure in the fields is moving!"

"Impossible! Amber, that thing is on a pole that is 6ft in the ground!"

She shrugged it off and joined us back in the living room for a movie and we all quickly went to bed.

That next morning, the mood was the same as last night, foreboding and edgy! We all wondered why we felt this way, but we couldn't understand it! We decided to run into town to get more supplies for the evening! 

I forgot to mention, all of my friends, including myself are skeptics! We think all paranormal instances have a rational explanation, but this night changed our view on the paranormal and cryptids like we've never viewed them before!

It was around 7pm, the sun had just set on the horizon and we were all inside, having our fun, laughing at things from school and just being the normal teens we were accustomed to. That's when things started getting weird! The first thing I noticed was that my favorite shirt I had dried on the line had vanished and I couldn't find it!

"Do you guys know what happened to my shirt?"

"Nope, haven't seen it!" Said Amber, as she went back to reading the yearbook!

"I could have sworn I put it outside earlier" that's when I noticed the scarecrow! It was CLOSER to the house and it made me shutter! I don't know what drew me to look but I notice something odd about it! It wasn't on the pole dad puts it on when it's on the fields, it was resting on a fence post! It was staring at the house, with its button eyes! I turned and went back to the group, hoping tomorrow will be back to normal!


It was 2am, and I had to get up to go to the restroom! The house was dark and eery, with only the light of the moon to light my way! I got to the restroom, did my business and started the walk back to my bed, and THATS when I noticed the shadow! It wasn't a normal shadow, but a TALL shadow. The scarecrow, it was on the deck! I woke every one up and made them watch! They were saying it was fake that someone was moving it outside! It moved, basically walked like a normal person, but with a limp!!


"Is anyone home?" A raspy, throaty voice said! "I thought I saw you inside!"

We all froze in our spots! Now we were freaked out, not knowing what to do! It spoke again, but this time, from outside the front door!

"Let me in! Come play in the fields with me!" 

It tried the door handle, but the door was locked! We all cowered and waiting for the sun to rise!

Morning came, and we had a story to tell all our other friends at school. We all believe now that the paranormal world is indeed real, even if it's in your own back yard

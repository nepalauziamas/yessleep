It wasn't ideal.

It was hot and humid and I would have rather been anywhere else but here. 

But Blake insisted I check this out for myself and I was passing through the neighbourhood anyways so I decided why not. 

I'm writing this to have this on document somewhere in case things take a turn for the worst. 

For obvious reasons I won't be able to post this on any of my private social media accounts but this needs to be recorded somewhere. 

Just in case.

For now you can call me Marcus, I worked as a special effects designer for some films you may have seen, but mostly those I'm certain you haven't.

You know the cheesy, over-the-top horror/ science-fiction films you often scroll past on YouTube?

Yes some of my best handiwork is featured in those films.

With everything from aliens to ghouls and everything in between I've designed and produced the make-up for.

It's been something of a passion of mine for years and even participated in a season of Face-Off on SyFy.

For now I'm based on Los Angeles.

Between jobs I pass the time by collecting memorabilia from vintage movies, usually costumes or bits of costumes from horror movies. 

After about 15 years in the city I've managed to amass a modest collection of items, the crown jewel of which is the pair of boots worn by Boris Karloff in Frankenstein 1935.

It may seem dull to you, but I genuinely take pride in knowing that I have a piece of horror film history in my possession.

I've written all of that to say that I may need help.

Or not... this may be the best thing to happen to me.

Let me stick with that one and be positive.

Yes,

Positive.

Blake is a contact of mine. He runs a small hobby shop outside of Reseda and while there isn't anything too fantastic in his old place to catch my attention, he is usually in contact with people who have their hands on some pretty authentic pieces of Hollywood history. 

Things that I'm interested in.

Full disclaimer most of the people Blake is in contact with are usually disgruntled janitors or assistants who don't think they have gotten their just dues at the studios and knick a costume or a set-piece and try to hawk to an unscrupulous collector... which would be me. 

I've gotten quite a few gems through Blake's network over the years.

The mask of the original 1941 Wolfman to the original hockey mask worn my Kane Hodder, the first Jason Voorhees.

I have also gotten my fair share of flops. 

That's just the way the business was.

Despite my years of collecting I still was never able to secure a full, authentic costume from a vintage film. 

That was until Blake called me to tell me about a recent find.

Now based on the description of how these people acquire the items they sell it shouldn't be surprising that a lot of them are hesitant to talk over the phone about what they had for sale.

The item in question was the complete costume of a gorilla from the 1932 film 'Gorilla God'

Haven't heard of it? 

Not surprised. 

It saw a limited release in the US, even by Great Depression standards and was widely criticised for the violent and lewd content. 

According to the few horror film buffs who have claimed to see the film there is a gratuitous amount of Gorilla rape, which wasn't well-received by the good folks of WWII era America, leading to the studio to pull the film after only a few viewings.

While an obscure movie from the 1930s may not seem too interesting to you, I quickly jumped on the idea not because of the movie it belonged to but because of the year of the film's release.

If Blake was correct, which he usually was, this gorilla costume would be one of the last prosthetic monster costumes used by actors before the release of RKO's King Kong, which made use of a then cutting-edge technique known as stop motion animation. 

Blake told me the guy who owned the suit was the son of the film's director and claimed the suit was in near mint condition.

I was originally skeptical about this because fur whether artificial or natural is perhaps one of the most easily degraded materials around.

One careless asshole brushing his hand across the surface and you have a seriously damaged item.

At any rate I wasn't doing anything that day so I decided to drive over to Tarzana to see what the old guy had exactly. 

Blake was right about the description of the guy's house at least.

Everything from the gate to the roof looked as if it had been imported from the 1930s.

I didn't realise it at the time but now that I look back I almost feel a sense of one-ness with that house.

Like I was supposed to be there.

Does that make sense?

What the hell am I even typing? I'm not religious or spiritual in the least... but that's how it felt. 

I even remember feeling something about that place.

By the time I knocked on the door I half expected some Depression-era hobo to answer the door, complete with skully cap and suspenders but no avail. 

The door creaked open to reveal your modern eighty-something year old decked out in the Gap's finest. 

"You the collector?" He croaked.

"Uhhh yea... Blake told me..."

"Shut the door when you're coming in."

I've been on lots of buys over the years but never had I seen someone in such a hurry before.

Usually the people with items for sale give you a big song and dance to convince you that you're not buying a piece of junk.

If they're particularly desperate they may even try to sauce it up with some good old "this has sentimental value so letting go of it will be hard" just to try and squeeze an extra buck or two but that didn't seem to be the case.

This guy seemed to want to get this over with.

Maybe that should have been my first indication something was wrong.

Wait a minute what am I typing?

Nothing's wrong. Everything is fine. 

It's just great. 

The old guy introduced himself as Eli. 

Eli's father I later learned was an obscure Polish-American director who enjoyed some modest success before slipping into a bout of depression and killing himself in 1968. 

"We didn't even have a word for it back in those days... You didn't get help. You just dealt with it with your booze, or pills or women and my father had enough of all three let me tell you," Eli croaked with a grin. 

The suit itself was laid out on a special display table in the living room of the house. 

Despite my earlier apprehension, neither Blake nor the old guy was bullshitting.

The costume was in impeccable condition even by today's standards. 

The skull and mask of the costume were perfectly preserved. 

The fangs which protuded out of the gaping jaw were still accounted for.

The eye holes were perfect preserved as well, no signs of wear and tear of stretching... but something odd stood out about the eye holes, at a certain angle I swore I saw a pair of eyes behind them. 

It was strange. 

"A trick of the light probably," Eli said with a grin. 

Although even as I type this I can't remember saying anything out loud. 

As strange as it was nothing could compare to the fur that covered the costume. 

Imagine the sight of the canopies of trees in a forest, rustling with a strong wind in unison, in one direction. 

That's the closest image I can think of to describe this fur. 

Even when no wind ruffled the fur, it seemed to move with a life of it's own. 

A special kind of sheen seemed to be reflected off the strange material.

Not quite orange but yet not quite black. 

Every single fleck of fur was accounted for, no damage, no missing patches as I originally feared.

It was almost as if every follicle of fur was exactly where it needed to be. 

"Go ahead give it a whiff..." Eli said.

I'm not one to just sniff random costumes, especially one that's decades old, but looking at the fur and the colour.

My God that colour. 

I can't even remember bending my head down to smell it.

I felt the follicles brush against my cheek and my nose and inhaled deep.

I closed my eyes to blink and opened them to see myself standing in a savannah.

Miles away and hundreds of thousands of years away from this neighbourhood in California. 

I saw a forest of old trees. Many of them are species which aren't alive today. 

I smelled fresh fruit, the ancestors of what we see and eat today. 

And I saw them. 

Beautiful, majestic and undisturbed.

They look like us and live in families like ours.

But they're not like us. They are purer, not corrupted by politics or religion. 

"So what do you think?" 

Eli's gravelly voice snapped me out of my (daydream?) (hallucination?)

I was sitting in a chair opposite him now... but I couldn't remember sitting down after smelling the costume.

"I can... ah... how much?"

"$3000 and it's yours."

I was barely finding my bearings before I heard that. 

I was beginning to doubt whether the suit he had as beautiful as it was, was in fact the original from the 1930s.

The mint condition together with this absurdly low price was a little too good to be true.

As if sensing my concerns he addressed them first.

"I can assure you the suit is in fact authentic. 

"It's not a recreation or anything like that. 

"The very same stitch-work around the thighs, chest and shoulder that you see are the same as when the prop designers made it back in 1932.

"In fact most of the costume is actually made from the animal that it came from. A magnificent ape that was hunted in Africa.

"Nothing has been added to give it that realistic appearance."

This made my head spin. 

Of course back in the 1920s and 1930s animal pelts were used as costumes, but even with my amateurish understanding of zoology and basic animal physiology I had a hard time understanding what kind of animal could have given fur like this. 

"This pelt gave my father a lot of good fortune... he didn't go down in history as a Cecil B DeMille but he did quite alright for himself.

"Even after the lights of the studio went out...

"He continued to work and give my father his cash."

Classic emotional backstory. Probably to add on another $1000 to the original asking price. 

Only he didn't.

"So... $3000 and he's all yours."

This deal wasn't going to get much better.

I didn't want to go for the first available offer. I wanted to haggle, I wanted to see how far I could go but something... no...

I wanted to give Elie his asking price.

I felt drunk off of old, cheap wine. 

Despite this I was still curious over the origins of the costume.

"You still didn't tell me what the suit is made of.

"I've been around plenty of fur costumes including some pretty good substitutes but this seems real.

"But this is different... it almost feels..."

"Familiar?" He said with a grin.

It felt like an hour before he spoke again. 

"I think deep down we all know where that suit came from... what kind of animal it came from.

"You know... Mr In-Between.

"The kind the scientists always talk about... the one that makes you wonder whether there really is a God.

"And if there is a God and he made us in his image, well what version of our image you think he looks like?"

No smile this time.

Eli locked eyes with me as seriously as a father would instruct a son to clean his room. 

"You have a deal."

Eli folded the costume and placed it in a box. 

I was so happy to have it. 

I could imagine going back to my home and running my fingers through the soft, silky black-orange fur.

Oh and I could wear it! I could feel it against my skin. 

And I could sniff it again. 

I felt so happy I could cry. 

But if I was so happy, why did I grab a hold of Eli's throat and bash his skull against the edge of his living room table when I handed him the cash?

Why did I not stop when he gurgled and croaked?

Why did I see it play out before me but was so overcome with bliss and joy?

Why did Eli smile even after his brains seeped out over his oakwood floorboards?

I don't know.

All I know is I feel at peace. 

At one. 

I know he will give me wisdom and prosperity now. 

He is here now with me.

To start this off,It was the year 2008 I was a high school student at the time and I had Basketball practice in the afternoon. I came home very exhausted so to cool down a bit I opened YouTube and one video in particular took my attention. It was a cute cat video (so nothing out of the ordinary so far) until the 2 minute mark when the video started to glitch,and a strange beeping noise played. This lasted around 5 seconds and then the video returned to normal so I paid little attention to it. At the 4 minute mark, the same thing happened at this point I was a bit confused but the video returned to normal and no strange things happened again so I forgot about it. 

Until 2 weeks later when I got a comment on my small YouTube channel (I had around 15 subscribers at the time so comments on my channel were usual but I was happy whenever I got any. ) The comment was a jumbled mess and so was the username,I clicked on the channel and behold,It was the channel with the cute cat video. The comment was written with very distorted text so the next day,I met with my friend, Derek (who is really good with ciphers and computers) he figured out it was just a simple Caesar cipher. To my shock, after shifting by 4 letters,The text became 'The cult of Osiris'. I was  so frightened I turned off comments on my channel and blocked the user. Nothing happened and I resumed with my normal life for around a year.

But, one day my grandma came up frightened to me and showed me a voice message she received the message was extremely frightening and confusing "Think you're funny eh,Think you're invincible eh, Think blocking me is gonna defeat me. I know everything about you...Richard" I was shocked about how he knew my name since I always used an alias online continuing with the message "The cult of Osiris can cause mayhem to all your familly members we know your school and are perfectly willing to use your familly members to get what we want!!!" We immediately called the police, however they couldn't help. For the next few days,I felt followed ,stalked everywhere I went. While I was  in the park I felt as if there was a flashing camera light. A few days later,I even found a spying mic in my school bag again I reported it to the police however,They could not track it to anyone. 

For the next 3 months things died down and I forgot about it my grandma forgot about it and I no longer felt stalked. Then the summer holidays came around so me and the family all had our yearly trip to Spain.We had a great time.  Although when we came back. We noticed the door had been unlocked when we opened the door,we where completely shocked our house was in disarray and anything of value had been taken when I entered my room I found a graphiti  message on the wall reading "the cult of osiris was here" When we called the police,This time they confirmed there have been mulitiple reports of a suspected gang using online databases to rob houses.The gang has not been found yet although a few suspects have emerged. Ever since then,I have restricted my online presence to a minimum

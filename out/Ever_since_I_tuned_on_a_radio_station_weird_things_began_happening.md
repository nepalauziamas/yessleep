  

Another hot Sunday morning. One can feel the sweat forming onto the pillows due to the warm air that keeps slipping through the open window. Its 6 am and it feels as if its already like the middle of the day, it’s probably due to those eyes.  It all comes to them. 

I haven’t rested again, in fact I don’t even remember when was the last time I got a nice good rest, ever since these things came my mind has been in constant trial. But now, no one can deny them no one can say otherwise that their existence isn’t there.  

It all began a month ago; I was working the late night shift at one of our local 24/7 convenient stores. The only convenient thing about it was probably the walking distance back home everything else, felt under some new form of slave ownership. I remember giving the keys to the new guy and while exiting the store I could feel the morning humidity sticking onto my skin. 

The majestic morning twilight was visible to my tired eyes. The contrast from the fluorescent lights of the convenient store to the gradient shades of blue that were painted onto the horizon was always rewarding. One could see the giant orchid yellow stroke that underlined the morning sky signalling the coming of the Sun. The dark shapes of palm trees and towering buildings kept on looming, a paysage, branded to my memory. 

I let my cigarettes, un buttoned my work shirt and plugged my earphones and began walking home. As I was listening to my favourite radio station it was briefly intercepted by a white noise that caught me of guard.  The noise was so annoying that I tried immediately to switch stations. The queer thing was however that despite every station I changed the white noise seemed to be persisted. It wasn’t until I finally tuned to a FM station 77.7 which the strange noise suddenly stooped. But there was an emptiness to that station, as no sound was emitted into my ears. 

It felt as if I was listening to nothing, but the eerie sensation that perhaps something was playing in the background bugged me. I took a glimpse at the road before me and I could see my house couple of meters away. I closed my phone and tugged my earphones into my pocket and neglected the whole incident as nothing but a weird radio instance. Perhaps something with their antennas or their broadcasting service.

The night however was fairly strange, for after the incident weird dreams came forth. Now I don’t remember everything, but what I do remember was one particular scene. I was alone, and before me a vast open field was stretching far as the eye could see. In the distance towering silhouettes of a city loomed. Their dark towers stretching towards the sky, behind them once more the twilight sky was painted, with the very same colour pallet. There was a weird music however, a strange sound was picked by my ears. 

There were constant waves of both high and low pitch frequencies, I could hear distant chiming noises echoing as various vibrations could be felt all around me. There was trance as if I stood alone in this vast emptiness and these weird sounds that surrounded me made the whole landscape before me shift and warp. It felt as if I was part of the Starry night as small orbs began appearing above the city. 

The next thing I remember was waking up covered in my own sweat. The sun rays were slitting though he cracks of the window shutters. I could hear the flapping sound of my almost broken air fan as it violently spans to the maximum setting, but even through I’ve had woken up, I could still hear part of those noises from my dream. They were brief, but they were there just moments before they got consumed by the daily noises of the outside world. 

The rest of the day was more mundane but the nightfall was once more even more strange. For every night since then I would hear the same frequency as I walked back home. It got so annoying that I stopped using my radio. But that was not the even the worst, for each night my dreams became even more wilder and vivid. 

There was one dream that I remember, for I saw that I’ve reached that distant and shadowy town that once stood miles away from me.  The town was desolate, the towering concrete silhouettes were eerie and desolate, one could only hear the wind howling through the empty rooms as it then morphed into a haunting sound as it echoed amidst the ruins. The streets barren, an urban wasteland, for only the physical remains of human creation stood covered in both dust and rumble. But the more one walks deeper into the city of Ruins, the more vibrant and chaotic the sounds become. But the true horror laid beyond the city, in its outskirts, for it Is there where everyone had gone.

I saw pyramid shapes of various sizes towering towards the sky, from the distance one could not distinguish its material. But it was irregular, as if someone piled earth or debris into a conical shape that was stretching upwards. However, it was no earthly material. Thousands of human bodies, some stitched together some stapled while others were tied were piled up into this grotesque pyramid shape.  No other form of expression beyond fear was carved onto their face or at least what’s left of it. One could see that the people who build these pyramids had no particular discrimination, for it was a pure mass of human bodies piled up into one. There were children of various ages, some with decayed limbs while others not, there were elders whose body was starting to decompose, and even women whom seem to be pregnant. Men with missing limbs and even famous politicians could be distinguished.  It was a mass of human bodies nothing more, nothing less.

As I stood staring at these grotesque pyramids, the chaotic sounds became even more obscure. I could hear as if a calling, strange noises as if a choir of cats mewing all simultaneously, there was a certain relaxation but yet again it felt eerie and disturbing.  I cannot describe the sound for it was beyond anything humanly conceivable, but what I can describe was the terror that loomed over me. A terror that I could finally see. 

In the dark sky above me, the once distant orbs, were now clearly revealed. I saw an enormous eye opening. Its iris was made out of vibrant and flashing colours of various indescribable hues. Its pupil was a hollow and abyssal, as if darker than space. The colours span around it as if consumed by it but what was mostly terrifying was that it looked down at me. I felt so insignificant, like an ant being stared by humans. 

Its presence consumed me, it awakened something violent in me, something that made me want to tear down my eyes and rip my head apart, for it had made me mad. Mad because I could not understand it, mad because it felt right, mad because I wanted to reach it. For that’s why moments later I was climbing the pile of bodies, I was climbing the human tower of babel, and I was going to reach it. 

It is here where my dream had ended, but my nightmare had begun. For days I would scroll the internet trying to make some a sense out of this.  In the real world I was an ordinary person, who lived by societies rules, at night fall and in my dreams, I was the only surviving man who was witnessing God himself. There was a primal energy inside that I could only relive into these dreams. I was deemed mad by my close friends, and I distanced myself from them, for only the fiery eye mattered. But then I stumbled upon a forum where it seemed that I wasn’t the only one with similar dreams lately. There were similar cases of other people seeing the very similar dream and some even claimed to stumble also onto that weird FM frequency. I was more than delighted, for now I knew I wasn’t crazy, for I knew perhaps this was a message of some sorts. And perhaps we were the chosen ones. But this didn’t last long, for everything finally changed until may 31st.

For the past few days before that date my sleep was very fairly calm as the weird dreams or visions had seized. But as the sands of the Sandman had taken me into a deep slumber I was abruptly awoken by the sounds of screams and outer terror from outside my house. I quickly got up thinking it was another vivid nightmare, but it took less than seconds to realize that I was indeed awoke and the screams of a woman were heard outside my house. With shaky hands and trembling fear I opened the shutters only to see that two women began running while screaming at the top of their lungs. It wasn’t long until the screams of two individuals turned into a cacophony of sounds and terror. The whole neighbourhood seemed to be awaken now, as I could see lights being turned on and people opening their doors and coming outside to see what the commotion was. And indeed there was a reason for this commotion, a reason that I would never in a million years would expect. 

I stood outside my front step and I stared at the dark blue sky and there it was. The fiery iris once more loomed over me over watching our mortal bodies as they descendent into madness. The black pupil swallowed the stars, and one could see that more eyes began appearing around us. I cannot lie that a smile was carved on my face that night, for now I knew everyone was witnessing their existence. I knew what was to follow, because I felt the very same urge as in my dreams, the urge of understanding it, the urge of reaching it. 

As of writing this, my vision had become a reality, for days now my town has becoming more desolate by the hour. The Piling is about to take place and I must go now. The damn eyes, they are the cause of it. But perhaps I will find peace in all this. Perhaps we all will.

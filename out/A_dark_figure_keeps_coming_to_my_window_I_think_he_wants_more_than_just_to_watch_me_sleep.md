"Shh!" He grabs my hand and closes it around his finger, "don't tell me that you're scared of my dark face."

My mind searches for some reason to justify why I'm afraid of him. I decide to tell him a story about a witch that lived in the mountains and weird things happened to me when I was around.

"Do you remember the story about the witch that lives in the mountains?"

"Yeah?" He's surprised and wonders what's going on with me. "I know this witch that lives in the mountains and I swear I hear her at night. She's been bothering me lately. I know she's not going to come out of the woods to scare me so I just sit here, keeping my eye on the woods hoping she's going to come out."

I hear him laugh and his fingers squeeze mine. "Why would a witch be coming out of the woods to scare you?"

"I don't know. I guess because she's a witch. She's got weird ideas about things, that's why she has such a bad reputation."

"She's not a witch. She's a witch."

I roll my eyes at him. "She's a witch that's dressed like a witch and tells lies. She's a witch that has a crazy name."

"No, she's not a witch. She's a witch, but she isn't evil. She's a witch that talks about all of the wrong things."

"What kind of wrong things?"

"The kind of wrong things that can make you go crazy. She's a witch that wants to convince you that you're not good enough."

"So what's wrong with being good enough?"

I have to tell him that she's a witch because I can't think of anything else. I've got to tell him the whole story, otherwise he won't be convinced that she's a witch and he'll think I'm just a crazy girl.

"I know what's wrong with being good enough. I'm not good enough." I turn my back to him, "just turn the light off."

"Come on, let me get you some more." He's pulling me toward the door.

"It's too late. I don't want to get out of bed. Just leave me alone."

"No. Just tell me the story. You won't have to get out of bed." He's pulling me out of bed, pulling me to the door. I don't want to get out of bed. I don't want to tell him the story, but I have to. It's my only hope. I need him to know what a witch is. I need him to know what she's like and what she's doing to me."

"That's a good story, but I don't want to get out of bed." I throw myself on the bed and kick my feet.

"You don't have to. Just tell me the story." He's pulling me out of the bed. "I'm going to tell you the story of the witch in the woods. Come on, don't be scared. Just tell me."

I lay on the...... to be contiunued.

I'm a homicide detective and I'm used to my phone going off at all hours so I wasn't at all surprised when my phone woke me up last night at 1 am. there was a supposed hanging but you could tell someone staged him that way. his feet were touching the floor and his neck wasn't broken, as if the rope was helping him stand up instead of trying to kill him. the initial cause of death was being stabbed elsewhere repeatedly in the back and brought here to be put on display. the lack of blood around him and the overall condition of his body backs that up. 

was it a statement? a warning? why would someone drag his body away from the original point of death just to... 'prop'.. him in such a way? I've walked through the scene multiple times trying to make sense of it all and picking up every bit of evidence I could find. No tire mark no sign of a car? our suspect has to be strong. superhuman strength to carry this man here without any sign of transportation or struggle. 

5 hours later; another call was about a supposed 'suicide' but just like our first victim, he was stabbed elsewhere repeatedly. witnesses say they saw him fall past their windows from presumably the roof. someone must have dragged him to the top just to push his already deceased body off the roof. why would someone do something so horrific? why would someone bring him all the way here when he's already dead just to throw him off a building? it's inhumane. 

I think the worst one was a call about a body, having been stabbed and moved, but being placed into the driver's side of a burnt car. The car was already burnt but no traces of ash melted skin or any indication the body was in the car while it was in flames. You might be thinking 'what's so bad about this case?' It had a note stapled to the victim's head reading 'den truer' which we worked out is an anagram of 'returned'. Who has returned? 

Multiple victims with the same M.O are all in different places. All have been killed elsewhere and had their body staged in unusual ways. The hanging, the roof, the river, and the car, all have been set up after the person was killed. 

every lab result came back the same with each body. absolutely nothing on them to even suggest who could have done this. they have tried to ID them but nothing comes up in the system. it's been weeks and every lead went cold and nothing has ever come from this investigation. they've been filed as a cold case, one of the unsolvable, but I won't stop looking for answers. whatever happened here, whatever game someone is playing, I have to find out who and what. I have to work out how this has happened. I have to because that's not where I left those bodies.

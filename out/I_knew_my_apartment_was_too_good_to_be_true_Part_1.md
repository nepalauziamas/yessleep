I was about 19 at the time, freshly into the real world and excited to start my life. The first part of the real world is always finding a place to stay, so I got right to work on that and began scanning the ads listed in the local newspaper. All of them were the same, some crappy place for an exaggerated price, but eventually one caught my eye.

"Luxurious uptown apartment with three bathrooms and four bedrooms, a large living space, and pre-provided furniture, for just 39 dollars a month"

How could I pass this up? I immediately called the phone number listed. The man who picked up had an oddly nasally voice, like if you pinched your nose but to an extreme point. He told me that he simply wanted to give back to the youth of today by giving them a brilliant deal on living arrangements. I decided to move in as soon as I could.

When I arrived at the place, it looked as good as it sounded, the building was huge, and I could see that it had a few other tenants, each on a different floor. As I walked in I noticed a man just outside the door, and he looked horrible. He was incredibly disheveled, and looked like he was far off in space, with whatever he was on.

Upon entering, I was greeted by the man I had spoken to over the phone. He was a good few inches taller than me, and I'm a pretty tall guy, and was wearing a red a blue pinstripe suit. He was also slightly pale, though with his bright orange hair I assumed he was just a ginger.

He told me all about the history of the building and how every brick was laid perfectly, but all I cared about was actually getting to the place. He made sure to introduce me to all my neighbors, though they all seemed off, in a way.

When I entered my apartment, I quickly made use of the different amenities it provided, and hopped into the large bed. I was awoken by a sound in the middle of the night, a large thump that came from the living room. I got up from my bed, and made my way into the hall.

The apartment had a format where my bedroom was at one end of an expansive hallway, with an entryway to the living room in the middle of one wall, and the closest bathroom at the other end of the hall. I slowly made my way to the entryway, and peeked my head around the wall.

I can't say exactly what I saw, only that it shook me to my very core. It was some sort of bleach white creature, with long, spindly arms and legs, and a toothy hole for mouth. It took everything I had not to scream immediately, as this monstrosity simply made its way around the room. It didn't seem to have eyes though, so I simply watched in sheer terror.

I'm currently in bed,and I don't know if that thing is still there. I just have to hope it doesn't find the master bedroom.

It was a slow Tuesday at the county Sheriff’s office in Maine. I mean, *most* days at my job were slow. There’s only so many directions you can give to lost tourists and a limited number of sprained ankles one can apply first aid too before becoming bored. The most exciting thing to happen all year was [back in May](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/p8xetl/i_work_for_a_county_sheriffs_office_in_maine_pt1/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf), and by exciting, I mean horrific.

That all seemed forgotten now though, and with the hiking season wrapping up the days were growing colder. Time crawled by as I sat at my desk working on a report for a dislocated ankle that had occurred on trail when my boss, Sheriff Barett, looked up from his newspaper with an odd expression. His furry brows knitting together as he asked, “Say, Charles. Do you like lakes?”

“You mean the Lakers?” I asked skeptically.

“No boy. I mean lakes. You know, big bodies of water. Lakes.” He reiterated gruffly.

“I, I..” I struggled to formulate an intelligent answer.

“Well do you or don’t you?” The man asked again impatiently now.

“Yeah, yes I guess so?” I could hear the doubt in my own voice, “Why’s that?”

Barett seemed to think for a moment. His gaze focused uncomfortably on me and he seemed far away in thought. I got the feeling that there was something he wasn’t telling me, “Right, you did such a good job with that issue earlier this year, I’m sending you to Oklahoma for some more training. They’ve got an excellent water safety policy.” He said slamming his news paper down and standing up, “I’ll start making the arrangements. Warden Gregory will be happy to have you I’m sure.”

And just like that the decision was made for me. I barely had any say in the matter, not that I had any protests anyway. It was a great opportunity to do some paid travelling on company time and I hadn’t been to Oklahoma before. Even so, if I had known what I was getting myself into, or if I had any wits about me, I might have refused the offer.

\*\*\*

I arrived in Oklahoma on Thursday the following week. It was awkward trying to navigate on my own. I wasn’t entirely sure where I was going, and the hand drawn map Sheriff Barett sent me with was considerably outdated. In the end I asked some locals for directions to the game wardens office and that got me there.

The building was located near the entrance of a large recreational park and had the words ‘*Wildlife Management*’ written on the side not unlike my own work place. Only, there was no café back home, and the car park was a muddy bog at best while this one was clean asphalt all the way up to the entrance. That felt like a luxury in itself.

Nervously I walked up to the front desk and the lady sitting there eyed me with suspicion. She definitely wasn’t as friendly as Diane. I felt like a kid on his first day of school, “Hi, I’m Charles, Charles Walsh. I was sent down from Maine?” I said apprehensively hoping she would have gotten word before my arrival.

The woman nodded but said nothing. I stood awkwardly, waiting like a floundering fish until she spoke, “Go through, the warden’s office is the second on the right.”

“Thanks.” I said politely but hurried to get going. Reaching the door I wasn’t sure whether or not to knock, thankfully the decision was made for me as a man opened the door. He was taller and older than I, with dark hair that was now starting to turn grey. He looked me up and down.

“You the guy from Maine?” He asked.

“Yeah, I’m Charles, are you warden Gregory?” I hoped.

The man laughed, “Gregory? No. That useless bastard retired a few years back.” He explained, “I’m Devin, good to meet you.” The man shook my hand with an uncomfortably firm grip.

It took me a moment to recover. I was sure that Sheriff Barett had said Gregory was warden. Perhaps his information on who was in charge was just as outdated as his map drawing skills I thought bitterly.

“Come. I’ll show you around.” Devin said slapping a big hand on my shoulder. He smelt strongly of cigarets, but his upbeat attitude was reassuring. He lead me around the building first, showing me where the amenities were before we made our way out into the reserve.

We passed the ‘wildlife management area’ sign at the entry of the park and walked a short dirt path that ran past the lake before looping back around to the camping area. Admittedly the park was beautiful. Sunlight shimmered off the surface of the lake, birds were in every tree flittering about without a care and the forest was a robust green.

Of course the land was far flatter than I was used to. The reserve I worked at normally overlapped part of the Appalachian mountains and all the trails weaved uphill eventually with varying degrees of steepness. However, despite the beauty of the lake I couldn’t help but feel uneasy looking out at it. Past the sky’s reflection on the water I could see it was actually a thick murky brown and it was impossible to see anything that might be lurking below.

The first few days after that were spent on orientation. I was only supposed to stay for about 4 weeks, which meant that I had a lot to learn in a short amount of time. At the end of each day I found myself worn out. I was staying at a hotel in a basic room with a window view into the forest. Each night I would collapse into bed and pray for the creatures outside to be quiet enough that I could sleep uninterrupted through the night.

So when the call came in at 4:34am on my first day off I was less than impressed. The ringer was right beside the bed and blaringly loud. Initially I was temped to roll over and block out the sound with a pillow, however I knew I should probably answer it.

With extreme reluctance I reached clumsily for the phone, almost dropping it as I brought it to my ear, “Hello, officer Charles speaking.” I answered gruffly, not ready to talk with anyone so early in the day. It was warden Devin on the other end and I was in no way prepared for what I was hearing. I hung the phone up with a ‘click’ and scrambled out of bed, almost tripping over the phone cord in my haste I left the room moments later without even the opportunity to make a coffee.

I arrived at the scene within the hour. Driving down the dirt track to the lake I could see emergency lights ahead flashing intermittently through the forest, bathing the area in red and blue hues. The first responders had arrived before I had and their vehicles were parked along the edge of the lake. A crime scene barrier had been established, the black and yellow tape twisted gently in the wind as it stretched between the trees.

As I pulled up Devin accompanied by two officers I didn’t recognise approached my vehicle, “Charles.” Devin greeted me as I rolled the window down, “I hope you haven’t eaten breakfast.”

“That bad?” I asked skeptically. Truthfully, I doubted anything could unsettle me after the May incident back home. However, the look the other officers exchanged told me that something was a miss, “Did someone drown?” I asked to prompt them.

This time, the man beside Devin spoke up, “It’s quite.. Unnatural. Just like the ones a couple weeks ago..” He said slowly, gesturing for me to follow them.

Mildly intrigued I got out of my truck and trailed after the officers. Naturally I was expecting that we would head toward the lake, however, they lead me into the woods instead. On our way others moved around us, some standing around uncertainly, others taking photos. Media coverage had already arrived but they were kept back behind the barrier.

The officers stopped at a clearing and motioned for Devin and I to go ahead. The first thing I noticed was that the area was wet. It hadn’t rained in the time I had been there, yet the ground squelched beneath my boots. Ahead, the scene was lit by headlights and I saw immediately what all the fuss was about. Slumped at the base of a large cypress tree were two bodies. They were crumpled over and looked like they were clambering to get over each other to get away from something, only the tree had somehow gotten in their way.

They were barely recognisable as human. The bodies were swollen and bloated with water leaking out from the pores of their skin, mouths and eyes creating a puddle of water around them that trickled downhill. My initial thought was that they had drowned and been dragged out of the water, but the water should have dried up. This looked more like the water had come out of them, and was still coming, as if they themselves were a newly formed natural spring.

I realised then that I was standing in their fluids. That alone nearly made me heave and I subtly stepped quicker to get out of the wet patch to dry land. However, in addition to the grotesque state of the bodies was the smell.. It was.. Not something I would have expected. Not the scent of decaying flesh, but rather an extremely pungent, musky, rotting smell that assaulted my nostrils. Like algae baking in the sun.

I gagged backing away further in disgust, one of the officers offered me some peppermint rub to put under my nose, “What the hell happened to them?” I asked as I tried not to dry retch.

“Don’t know. Can’t think of any way anyone could end up like that. We’ll send them off to the coroners for an autopsy, but, we’re recommending the park be closed to visitors for a few days.” The officer instructed.

Devin nodded in agreement as he spoke up, “Sure thing, I doubt anyone will want to come here now anyway. Tabloids are calling us ‘Murder Reserve’ now.” He muttered.

Honestly I couldn’t wait to be out of there. I had never seen, or *smelt*, anything like it before.

In the days that followed the park remained closed to visitors as promised. Though Devin and I still patrolled the regular route. He explained to me that sometimes kids or unlicensed hunters would sneak into the park, and if they did that regularly when the park was open, they certainly weren’t going to let a park closure stop them. However, because the park forest stretched over miles it was hard to patrol every inch of it at all times.

It was for this reason that we split up. Devin sent me out on one trail while he patrolled on another. We would cover more ground this way and he assured me that I couldn’t get lost if I just ‘stayed on the trail’. I understood then how tourists felt when I sent them out with those exact same words - skeptical.

Despite this I set out with confidence, I was an officer trained to navigate the wilderness, highly skilled. How lost could I get?

Now I’m sure you can imagine my surprise when my ATV made a disappointing choked sound and slowly puttered to a stop with smoke billowing out the engine. The sun was by then falling toward the horizon and I was ***not*** pleased. I was at least a good 5 miles out over rough terrain. That meant it was going to take me a solid couple hours to walk back. It would be dark by then without a doubt. Ordinarily, that wouldn’t have bothered me. It wasn’t the first time I would have travelled alone in the dark.

However, in light of the recent events and being in an unfamiliar area I was more apprehensive about the situation. If nothing else, I was in bobcat territory. I began the trek back with my Remington close at hand and cursing Devin for his poorly maintained equipment. For the most part I walked on the trail for two reasons, one, it’s a lot easier to walk over semi-flat ground than fight your way through the forest. And two, you’re far less likely to get lost walking on a path.

Around me I could hear creatures in the trees, birds mostly I told myself. Though I imagine some were small rodents scurrying about. Overall it wasn’t as bad as I thought it was going to be, but even so, when the track met up with the far edge of the lake to run parallel alongside it I found myself feeling uncomfortable.

I remembered the water trickling from those bodies. I imagined it seeping under leaves on the ground, raising them up slightly as it twisted through the dirt and around small rocks. It would travel tirelessly, carving out the land to get back to it’s destination: The Lake. That idea made me feel distinctly uneasy. I don’t recall what brought me back from my thoughts, but it was then that I noticed something in the atmosphere had changed.

The forest was quiet. Far quieter than a forest at dusk should have ever been. Glancing around subtly I saw nothing. I didn’t want to make it look like I was a scared prey animal to anything that might have been watching me. But I certainly felt like one. It was slowly growing darker and I soundlessly loaded my firearm, just in case. I wasn’t far from the rangers station and that gave me some comfort. There would be people there, warmth and light. All the things we tell ourselves will keep us safe.

Nervously I looked out across the lake, it was an inky black now and lined with the silhouettes of trees against the dim sky. Dark ripples moved slowly across the surface of the water and I found myself frozen to the spot. I couldn’t tell if the movement was purposeful or if a breeze had blown over making the small waves. I tried to convince myself that it was nothing, that paranoia had taken hold. But as I stood waiting, something crossed the path up ahead.

With the worst scenarios playing in my mind I had trouble identifying the thing at first. My mind wanted to twist the creature into something monstrous. I had been having nightmares since May and some part of my brain was convinced that it was happening again. However, as I fought back the terror, I came to realise that it was nothing more than a deer approaching the lake. It hadn’t noticed me and as I watched the doe delicately tip toe to the waters edge I felt relief wash over me.

A soft nervous laugh escaped me as I recounted how terrified I had been of a deer. That’s when I noticed it… There was something in the water only a few feet away from the deer. I couldn’t see more than a dark outline but it looked as though a person’s head was popping up out the water. Confounded I stared at it as it moved closer to the deer.

The animal seemed to notice it then too. Her ears pricked forward with interest at first, then the doe stepped back, staring at the water with just as much shock as I was before letting out an alarm call. The sound rang out clear and loud into the night air, but the thing in the water didn’t react.

When it didn’t move the doe didn’t either, they stared at each other for a long moment before I spotted a strand of water snaking it’s way up from the lake. With *blink and you’ll miss it* speed the water struck the deer. The animal flew backward in a panicked state and darted away into the forest.

I couldn’t believe what I had just witnessed, when I regained myself enough I looked back to the lake. The figure was gone. It dawned on me then that whatever was in the water had just missed it’s prey, which meant it would more than likely move on to the next thing nearest the water. Which, at that time, was me.

Without a second thought about it I too ran off into the forest. I wanted to put as much distance between myself and the lake was possible. Admittedly I wasn’t very fit, so I can’t say that I ran a great distance, but I did run far enough to come across another trail. I recognised it as the one that looped around to the general camping area and followed that path back instead of the lake trail.

By the time I got back to the ranger station, it was dark and Devin stood waiting anxiously for me. Everyone else had gone home. “Where have you been? And where’s my ATV?” He growled annoyed.

“Oh, I just decided I wanted to take a pleasant stroll.” I snapped back. I don’t know where that boldness came from, normally I would never have spoken like that to a superior. Devin looked just as shocked as I felt so I continued, “Your ATV broke down I had to walk back past the lake.. There was *something* in the water..”

I was waiting for him to laugh or dismiss me, maybe even reprimand me for my behaviour. I’m also quite sure I looked like a mess. My uniform was scuffed and untucked, my hair clung to my forehead with sweat from the running. However, Devin remained quiet for a long time before eventually asking.

“The thing in the lake. What did it look like..?” He spoke softly, lighting up another cigarette.

“I don’t know, I didn’t see it long.. It looked like someone in the water. Then it had a water spout or something.” I answered, struggling to describe it and taken aback by his response.

“I see. Come, lets have a drink.” He muttered, already heading inside with smoke trailing from the butt in his hand. I didn’t complain. Honestly I just wanted to sit down. I sank into the nearest chair while he rummaged around until he produced a bottle of scotch from a drawer.

The warden poured the glasses heavy handed and pushed mine toward me, “Sorry about the ATV. I don’t use them often. Didn’t realise it would break down.” He apologised.

“It happens.” I answered reluctantly.

“When I took over this place from Gregory Nutteloos it was a disaster. Paperwork backed up from the past decade. I still haven’t gotten through it all. First time I took the boat out patrolling it left me stranded in the middle of the lake. I had to swim back to shore.” He began and I wondered where he was going with it, “I witnessed something in the lake that day.. Something I can’t even describe.. I had just reached the shore when I saw it, it moved under the water like a ripple. When the water started to reach up for me I ran. Didn’t look back.” He took another sip of scotch.

“So you believe me?” I enquired uncertainly.

The warden nodded, “Yeah, I believe you. Every time we find a body I wonder ‘what if’. Worse still it that it’s happened before. No way to stop it. You know, I lied on my resume to get this job. I deeply regret that now.” He laughed humourlessly.

I didn’t know what to say, his confession didn’t surprise me, but I was interested in what he was saying, “What you mean it’s happened before?” I asked sitting forward.

In response he gestured vaguely to the wall behind me. Slowly I turned to see what he was referring to, and realised that there was a board hung up with newspaper clippings attached to it. I had noticed it before, but I hadn’t bothered to read any of the headlines. They read, among others,

*‘Lake monster takes 10yr old girl - 1991*’

*‘Mysterious deaths at wilderness management park - 1987’*

*‘Lake monster hoax? - 1934’*

A chill ran down my spine, there were at least a dozen articles all saying approximately the same thing. The most recent was clipped up, dated only a few days prior. I know the incident the headline referred to, *‘Bloated bodies found at Wilderness Park, could it be back?’*

“We have to keep the park closed.” I stated firmly.

“How? You think anyone would believe that you or I saw anything in that lake? They’d laugh us out of town.” He scoffed.

“Well then, how did you stop it last time?” I asked.

“I didn’t. Gregory was the warden last time and as far as I know, he didn’t stop it either. It just.. *went away.*” He gestured stars with his hands and I could tell he was already quite drunk. I couldn’t rely on him for help. That’s when I noticed a hand written note pinned between the news paper segments.

Curious I crossed the room to inspect it. The hand writing on it was barely legible, but a name caught my attention. The letter read:

*‘If anything like this starts happening again, call this number xxx-xxxx. Ask for Linnaeus.*

*P.s. Don’t stare, he doesn’t like it.*

*- Gregory. ‘*

Reading the note, the name Linnaeus stuck out to me and I couldn’t help but wonder if it was the same man I had met in Maine. Or maybe a relative? I decided, as Eric was too young. By my estimate he was in his early 20’s, it wasn’t possible that he was around last time this lake issue arose. Though I wondered if maybe his job ran in the family. Perhaps his father..?

I was born as an only child. That’s what they’d have told you, at least. “I’m the lucky one”, they’d say. I was the one who made it. “The lucky swimmer”, you know?

Again, that’s what I was *told* growing up. That I was both “born lucky” and “lucky to BE born”. And who was I to tell anyone different, huh? It wasn’t like *I* would’ve known back then what *really* happened. What my folks *really* did. *How the hell was I supposed to know?*

*(They made the deal...)*

So yeah, that was me; “the lucky one”. “Lucky Penny”, my father kept calling me (despite absolutely fucking *hating* being called that). Oh, and they never missed an opportunity to let me know just how “lucky” I was, either.

“Always be grateful, Penny.”, my mother would tell me every night when she’d tuck me in, “You were the lucky one.” Of course, I never objected back then, still being little and all (even thinking it was kind of cool, “being the lucky one”). Even still, though, I was always curious as to just *how* I was lucky.

*(They made a deal...)*

Part of the aforementioned routine at night was for me to pray every night before I went to sleep. As mundane as that sounds, it was super weird. It was weird for a couple of reasons. First, my family wasn't religious, at all. They didn't go to church or ever try to even talk religion with others.

*(He comes to those that don't pray...)*

The other thing, though, was the actual prayer itself. Again, young and naïve as I was and given that I wasn't exactly given any proper perspective when it came to religion, I just went along with it. I had no conception of "God", so I just imagined that, *whatever* it was I was praying to or for every night was "God".

Another thing was always clear to me about the prayer; who or whatever was on the receiving end, was someone to be feared.

*(Pray, pray, pray to keep the devil at bay...)*

It'd always go the same. My mother would come to kiss me goodnight, occasionally read me one of the poems from my Shel Silverstein book, before then turning off the lights and telling me to bow my head. She'd then recite the prayer.

**\*\*\***

*"Dear father, we thank thee abundantly for the day's bountiful blessing, thy gift of another fortune. We are unworthy, deserving of only suffering and our souls for scorchin'. Please, Father, keep the angered beast at bay; he who was unfortunate, and continue to bless us with the tidings of another day, lest you sentence us to burn with the degenerate."*

**\*\*\***

When she finished, she'd then tell me to recite it, and I did. Once I had finished, she'd then kiss me on my forehead and say, in a warm voice, "Goodnight, my lucky little Penny", before leaving. That was it, no other sort of devotional or preaching, nothing. Just that weird ass prayer.

I remember occasionally having nightmares about "The angered beast" she'd always mention. I'd have different images of what it was. Sometimes, I'd see it as a hulking beast with the head of a wolf and the body of an anaconda with giant dragon wings that'd breathe fire. Other times, "The angered beast" would be a large spider monster who'd trap me in a giant web and poison me with it's venom, slowly making me suffer until I'd eventually die. Of course, like all nightmares, I'd wake up just before that'd happen.

I'd always tell my parents the next morning about them. Each time, they'd always feed me the exact same line; *EVERY TIME!* "The beast can't get you, Sweetie, We said our prayers, remember? So long as we say our prayers, the beast can't touch you."

*(The beast can't touch me, I'm the lucky one...)*

I’d always believe them, too, even if I didn’t *actually* understand it. I guess I didn’t *need* to understand it, or at least, I didn’t think I did. You know how it goes at that age, everything mommy and daddy say is right and they know everything, right? I understood that, so long as I followed the rule: to always say the prayer before bed, nothing bad would happen to me.

Over time, I got used to it. Conditioned to it, even. Even when the nightmares stopped, I was still saying the prayer every night with my mother. This would carry on for years, too, all the way from elementary school and through high school.

It became just a second nature to me. That said, I didn’t stop being curious about it either. I mean, I still *did* it, but I couldn’t stop wondering just *who it was* we prayed about. *Who it was* we prayed TO.

*(They made a deal...)*

This would lead to quite a few awkward as hell conversations where I’d make the mistake of asking these questions to my mother. That’d always play out the same, too. She’d exchange looks back and forth at Dad, looks that said she was trying to keep a secret. Looks that said *“Oh no, she’s asking questions, what do we do?”*

*(Pray the beast away...)*

She’d then reply, warmly but nervously, that “it wasn’t right to ask these question. That it was our place to simply give thanks for our blessings.” I’d of course clam up afterwards. Because of this, I only ever brought it up a handful of times. After that, I just went back to not really thinking about it.

It wasn’t until my senior year of high school that I *finally* had the courage to see just *what* would happen if I went *once* without saying the fuckin’ prayer. It was late one night and I was out at my friend, Stephanie's house “studying”— which really meant we were at a party. I’d never been allowed to go to parties, or to friend’s houses for that matter.

Oh yeah, that was another thing that made the whole thing so strange; I always had to be home at night so mom could be there to say the prayer with me.

*(To bless me. To pray the beast to stay away...)*

I couldn’t just, you know, *say it on my own*. No, *SHE* had to be there, *SHE* had to be the first to say it, and *SHE* had to be the one to

*(Make the deal...)*

say goodnight to me. That was, of course, more than a little frustrating, and where I started to finally STOP caring about the damn prayer. “Angered beast” or not, I was going to have a life; one that didn’t involve my parents and their little psychotic ritual.

*(I had a life, the beast didn't...)*

*”They won’t even tell me what it is.”* I thought. I then got to thinking, what if there *wasn’t* an “angered beast” at all? What if it wasn’t real?

*(The beast is real, and my prayers kept him away...)*

So yeah, there I was; living it up at a party at the school varsity football captain's house. We had it all; chips, dip, pizza, chicken wings, alcohol, a hot tub, and loud ass music that you could've heard several neighborhoods over, all of which I honestly didn't give two shits for. None of that really mattered to me. I was just happy that I was *free!*

*(I was always free, because the beast wasn't lucky...)*

I was free from my folks, free from their superstition, free from their control. *I was free from their fear.* It raged all through the night, starting right as the sun went down, when me and Stephanie arrived, and not even coming close to dying down until well after two in the morning. I remember it was around 9:30 that night that my phone started ringing off the hook with a call from my mother.

If you guessed that I let the fucker go to voicemail -- congratulations. *"She can kiss my ass."* I just kept partying until inevitably falling out after losing about the sixth or seventh round of "Drunk Blackjack".

When I woke up, around 10:30 the next morning, I saw my phone FLOODED with text messages from mom. Ranging from ***"When are you coming home?"*** to ***"I'm at Stephanie's house, but you're not here, where are you?"***, to finally ***"Oh my God, Stephanie, where are you?! Are you okay?! Oh God, I'm calling the police!"***

*(They won't keep the beast away...)*

Besides generally annoying the absolute hell out of me, this started to freak me out a bit. This feeling was solidified, though, when, after LITERALLY 50 messages read either "Penny, where are you" or "Please come home", her last message to me read; ***"Penny, baby, if you're out there, PLEASE COME HOME, BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE!"***

That made me genuinely scared. What was she so afraid of? It's not like I was being kidnapped -- sure, *she* might not have known that -- but still, she knew I was with Stephanie. She knew Stephanie, how tight we were, and how we always had each other's backs, in and out of school. We were basically sisters, and she knew that, trusted that. *"So why is she freaking the hell out like this?"*

What caught me even more, however, was the whole "Before it's too late" line. What was *that* supposed to mean? Before *what* was too late?

*(The beast came to collect his due...)*

Freaked out and scared something was happening, or had already happened to my folks, I asked Stephanie if she could give me a quick lift back to my house. When we pulled up, the van was still parked in the driveway -- no police cars. *"At least they're home."* I thought as I got out and went up to the door.

I turned the knob and went inside, something that alarmed me already. My folks always kept the door locked after dark. *"Maybe in case I came back?"* I wondered as I slowly made my way in. It was dark, none of the lights were on.

*(The beast dwells in the dark...)*

"Mom?" I called out. Silence. "Mom, I'm home."

*("... Please, Father, keep the angered beast at bay; he who was unfortunate...")*

I stumbled my way through to the kitchen, feeling across the walls for a light switch. I found it and flicked on the lights. What I saw made my heart start hammering.

*("...We are unworthy, deserving of only suffering and our souls for scorchin'...")*

The kitchen was a wreck. Dishes had been scattered and smashed all across the floor. Pots, pans, and all of the utensils had also been thrown around haphazardly. In short, it looked like a frickin' tornado just blew in through the kitchen. Even the window by the sink was shattered.

*(It got in...)*

"Mom, Dad?! Where are you?! MOM?! DA--" I cut off when, out of the corner of my right eye, I glimpsed a giant pool of red in the threshold where the kitchen leads into the living room. My blood instantly froze solid. *"Oh no..."*

"Mom?! Dad?!" I ran to the threshold. I began to feel the temperature in the room drop significantly. Along with this, a foul smell invaded my nose reaching the living room.

*("...lest you sentence us to burn with the degenerate.")*

It was sickening now, and I started gagging. The lights were off, so I had to grope for the lights again. I immediately regretted doing so, though, when I couldn’t hold back the vomit at what I saw.

*(I didn’t count my blessing last night...)*

The entire living room now had a fresh coat of crimson  splattered across the walls.

*(The beast wasn’t lucky, but I was...)*

On the family picture that hung above the couch (now shattered), there were words scrawled in the blood; **”WHY ME?”**

*(I was the lucky one...)*

The worst part, the part that sickened me (and still does, I still can’t stop seeing it at night), was my parents. There, draped across the couch, were my parents. Or at least, their flesh. They’d somehow been completely drained of their insides, leaving two pelts of flesh draped on the couch like they were deflated balloons.

*(The beast came when I didn’t count my blessings...)*

When I could finally catch my breath again, I pulled out my phone and panic-dialed 9-1-1. I barely held myself together enough to talk to the operator. I’m honestly surprised the lady understood a single fuckin’ word I gibbered out, I was panicking so bad (who could blame me? How would YOU have reacted?).

*(I was lucky, the beast wasn’t. And neither were they...)*

They arrived about three minutes later, the station being only a couple of miles down the road from the house we lived in. When they came into the house, I was led outside. They actually had to essentially drag me out of the living room because I was frozen, paralyzed in shock, disgust, and just utter terror.

My mind was in so many places all at once that my mind might as well have disconnected from the rest of my body. I guess what I'm trying to say is it felt unreal. A nightmare that I knew I couldn't wake up from.

*(The beast is angry because he wasn’t fortunate...)*

A couple of officers came outside after about twenty minutes and asked me questions like the last time I’d seen or talked to my folks. I told them about the party the previous night with Stephanie. I told them about how they’d called me and showed them the texts.

I asked if they’d called them at any point to come looking for me. They replied that they hadn’t.

*(The beast had collected his due...)*

They asked me if I’d have known anyone who wanted to hurt them or me. I replied that I didn’t, which was true.

*(We’d always prayed. It couldn’t get us when we prayed...)*

I *didn’t* know who’d want to hurt us. Which made everything I’d just seen that much harder to understand. I mean, *WHO* could, and/or would, do THAT? *HOW* could they do it?

*(A deal was made...)*

*WHY* would they do it?

All of this actually caused my head to hurt. They asked me to come down to the station with them to provide a statement. I complied. At the station, I answered the same questions the same way I did back at the house.

“I wasn’t home last night, I was at party with my best friend. They tried getting a hold of me, wondering where I was, but I didn’t answer. I came home and I found them... well, you know. I don’t know who could’ve done it or why.”

Once they were finished with me, they asked if there was anyone I could call to come and get me. I had no other family members where I lived, and so I decided to call Stephanie. She was, of course, devastated when I gave her the most basic gist of what happened (obviously leaving out the more bizarre and gruesome details).

She picked me up and took me back to her parents house. She and her folks let me move in with them, something I couldn’t ever thank them enough for to this day. Stephanie loved it, having me as a new roommate. “Now we’re *officially* sisters!” She joked.

I liked it too, but I was far too traumatized by what’d happened to be able to be as excited as I wanted to be. Every night for at least the first three or four months following, I’d be asleep for barely five minutes before I’d see their bodies, their empty, sucked dry flesh pelts, draped on the couch, forcing me to wake up sweating. In my nightmares as well, I’d hear the sounds of babies crying from all around the room — despite there being no babies anywhere.

The crying would get louder and louder, clearer and distinct. Eventually, I’d hear words being pronounced in the screams. I’d just barely pick up on it, being so mixed with the other sounds, but I’d always hear the same words; ***”Why did it have to be me, Mommy?!”***

*("Dear father, we thank thee abundantly for the day's bountiful blessing, thy gift of another fortune. We are unworthy, deserving of only suffering and our souls for scorchin'...”)*

***”Why did you hate me?!”***

*(“... continue to bless us with the tidings of another day, lest you sentence us to burn with the degenerate.")*

***”WHY DID I HAVE TO GO?!”***

The room would then become shrouded in shadow. Everything becomes engulfed in darkness as the crying becomes louder than ever, sounding as though whatever it was was right on top of me. Instantly, I’d start wheezing as something that felt like large, invisible fingers tighten around my throat. As my vision fades, I see two large red, beady eyes like two gleaming embers glow from the darkness and fix me in their enraged gaze.

My body goes limp. My vision clouds completely. From within the darkness, from the glowing eyes, the voice roars out to me, ***”WHY DID IT HAVE TO BE ME?! WHY DID I HAVE TO BE THROWN AWAY?!”*** I fade into unconsciousness as the eyes come closer to me, causing me to feel the grip on my throat tighten, further suffocating me.

*(“...Please, Father, keep the angered beast at bay...”)*

It was always that same nightmare. I never understood it, what it meant and why. Why was I seeing it? Who was speaking in the dream?

*(Who was the beast? Why wasn’t he lucky?)*

Over time, this grew into a bit of problem; with me not being able to sleep, which inevitably meant that I’d fall asleep in class (where it was no better, I might add), which then led to quite a few stints in detention. My grades were in a free fall as well, threatening even to cause me to flunk senior year eventually.

Because of this, Stephanie’s mom plugged me in with the psychiatrist she sees occasionally for her bipolar depression. It took a while, and quite a few meetings ended with us essentially making very little, if any, progress at all.

*(What makes me the lucky one?)*

Eventually, though, the nightmares went away and things more or less were back to normal for me. As normal as I could get, anyways. I kept seeing the psychiatrist for while afterwards, but it wasn’t exactly that I *needed* to anymore, but sort of as a security measure. You could sort of think of it

*(Like the prayer.)*

Like a “security blanket”, you know?

Something you *don’t NEED*, but still hold onto for a while just to feel safe.

*(I felt like I didn’t need the prayer anymore.)*

Anyway, I would, of course, stop seeing her after about a year, having been nightmare-free for at least a good six to seven months later. You could say I had recovered, at least as much as you could really expect me to. I could sleep properly again, my grades were getting back to normal, and I’m the end, I was still able to pull second in my classes.

I graduated high school and was given a full ride through a four year university. Everything was great, for a while. See, something I should mention is that, while I wasn’t up tossing and turning each night, I still had the dreams.

I’d see two figures; shadowed outlines, meaning I didn’t know who they were. They walk down to the edge of a pier by a large lake. When they get to the edge, they look like they start kissing.

*(The deal had to be made...)*

I begin hearing passionate moaning that gets louder and louder until morphing into a high pitched, rhythmic pinging sound. Now, everything was white. One of the two figures was laid down while the other was sat down over her.

*(Two lives came at a cost, only one could be lucky...)*

This was when I’d hear a flurry of sounds, almost simultaneous. It would start as hearing a woman screaming in pain, which was then slowly joined by a man sobbing louder and louder. Then *these* would be joined by sounds of a baby’s wailing, along with the entire scene going dark. Finally, all of this would be muffled by two red, beady eyes and a baritone laughter.

Each time I woke up from this, I was more curious than afraid. What was I seeing? Who were these people, these shadows? Why was I seeing it, what did any of it mean?

*(What made me the “lucky Penny”?)*

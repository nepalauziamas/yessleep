I Couldn't Recover From This Trauma Since It Affected My Life It's Been 5 Years.

In This 5 Years I've Been Affected By The Trauma And Horror I Faced The Reason Why I Don't Bike In The Forest Anymore I'll explain later.

I Go Biking At The Forest Cause. I Kinda Need To Exercise My Legs For My Healthy Routine To The Fact I Don't Have A Car To Use And My Town Is Always On Heavy Traffic.

There's A Forest Behind My House Which I Use For Biking And Shortcut For My Work.

In June 24 2017 I Prepared My Uniform On My Way To My Office.

I Ate My Waffles And Peanut Butter Sandwich As Usual And Went To The Forest Behind My House And Followed The Trails On My Way To Work 15 Minutes On The Drive I Heard Something On My Way. it Sounded Like A Psst. And Some Loud Footsteps. It Was A Giant Footstep it looked like it wasn't a normal Stomping noise. so I just hurried to go to the Empty highway On My Way To Work While I'm On My Way Something Pushed Me And My Bike To The Ditch

I Felt Unconscious It Was Still Midnight When I Woke Up.I Had Scratches All Over My Chest Uniform And Legs.

That's When I Saw Something Walking Behind The Dark Woods.

I Saw The Empty Highway But I Couldn't Get Up Because Of My Leg Injury I Got My Phone And Called 911 As I Sayed I Broke My Leg After I Fell Into The Empty And Old Highway On My Way To Work. I Shrugged And Said To The 911 Dispatcher The Highway And Where I'am. The 911 Dispatcher Sent A Unit On The Way And I Got Up To Heal My Leg. As I Walked Up To The Hill On Where The Highway Was I Was Picked Up By Someone Or Something. I Thought That It Could Be A Person But I Weigh A Lot Of Pounds So It's Not A Person And There Isn't A Gorilla In This Forest I Thinked To Myself As I Was Thrown Into A Tree. I Managed To See What The Creature Looked Like. And It Looked More Like A Gorilla 
Mixed With A Human And It's Sharp Teeth And Horns. I Walked Back To The Hill As The Creature Was Chasing Me..

I Didn't Know What To Do. I Managed To Get Inside A Cabin And Saw A Village So I Called The Villagers For Help.

I Stayed There For An Hour Until The Authorities Arrived I Told Them What The Creature Looked Like. And They Searched The Entire Forest.

Nothing.

I Told The Villagers What The Creature Was And They Said That The Creature Killed Lots Of People In The Highway So That's Why People Haven't Been On The Highway And Told Me To Avoid Going To The Highway.

It's Been 5 Years And I Always See That Creature n The Back Of My House In The Forest Every Night.

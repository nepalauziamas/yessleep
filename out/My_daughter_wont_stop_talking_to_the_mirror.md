This took place awhile back and I'm still not able to fully understand what it is or who, let me get you caught up you see I have a 8 year old daughter named Bridget. See is a shy girl and doesn't have friends, her teacher says she doesn't talk to anyone in school and she sometimes gets bullied for it.

I decided we should homeschool her but my wife said she would come out of her shell soon and open up, I did try bringing her to parks with other kids and to friend's children birthday parties. It would never work though and after awhile decided to just live with a introvert child, that was until one day I was walking by her room and heard her talking to someone.

"Your so funny Sally" I was confused by this, who's Sally? I went in Bridget's room "Who are you talking too" I saw no one see was just sitting there by herself. She was in front of her mirror but no one was around "I'm talking to Sally" and she proceeded to point at her mirror, I then realized she came up with an imaginary friend and decided why not at least she's talking to someone.

I decided to leave her with her imagining thinking it's normal for kids to have imaginary friends, I wish I didn't looking back at this but at the time I started to let it go but my wife not so much. "Tom we got to do something about this" I looked away from the hockey game I was watching "What" she had a frustrated looking face at this point "Sally" I looked back at the TV  not to miss anything "It's not gonna kill her to have an imaginary friend it's normal for kids". I could tell my wife was displeased "She should be talking to real kids not making up them" I ignored my wife because I could care less at the time and just wanted to watch the game.

2 weeks had passed and Bridget was still talking to Sally and my wife was still unhappy about it, I hadn't really worried about it till now because she started to stay up late talking to her and some morning the house would be trashed. My daughter would blame Sally for it "I telling the truth it was Sally promise" I would get more and more frustrated "Stop lying, Sally not real" but my daughter insisted she was.

I grounded her for lying and sent her to her room and while cleaning the mess I heard Bridget talking "Sally why would you do that?" Realizing she was talking to Sally then she said "I don't want to be your friend anymore". I was happy hearing that and when I was about to leave I thought I heard someone else "You can't leave me" it sounded like a teenaged girl, it couldn't of been I thought and went in her room and only saw Bridget was in there no one else.

3 days had passed and when me and my wife were going to bed I saw the hallway light turn on, I went to check it out "Who's out there"? I saw no one. I went in Bridget's room and she was fast asleep so I checked around the house no one this was getting more and more strange. I decided to set up security cameras thinking I would finally catch Bridget red handed but if only I had known back then.

Because one day I went to check the security cameras after finding a drawing on the fridge of a bloody girl in a mirror and when I asked my daughter she said it was Sally. Finally I can catch her in the act but when I checked the cameras something weird happened, I saw the fridge and all of a sudden it went to static and when it came back on there was the drawing on the fridge.

I was sweating because Bridget couldn't of done that, but that night shit got real when I was in bed with my wife she told me we needed to talk about Sally. I agreed and said we would tell Bridget she couldn't talk to Sally anymore and make real friends we both agreed and went to bed.

I woke up to a weird sound it sounded like someone was slashing into a type of meat but it was too dark to see I thought I smelt something weird and reached over to turn on the lamp. And what I saw when my eyes adjusted to the light still haunts me to this day  it was Bridget with a butcher knife slashing my wife blood all over her I screamed, I then called 911 they came and took Bridget away and took my wife's body away.

When talking to my daughter she said that Sally had made her do it, they said she was mentally ill and sent her away to get help. I was heartbroken with everything that had gone on and one night went on my daughter's room and sat in front of her mirror. But noticed something my reflection wasn't there. Instead I saw a girl who looked to be 14 maybe 15 looking back at me her eyes were were fully black and she had blonde hair and she had blood coming down her.

She tilted her head and smiled showing blood dripping from her teeth I screamed and smashed the mirror, I have to be going crazy she can't be real but every mirror I look into she's there looking back at me. I smashed everyone one but it hasn't helped because when I'm about to fall asleep I see her in the corner watching me she doesn't move though.

She just stands there swaying side to side as she hums something that sounds demonic, I'm starting to go mad from it hoping one she  just kills me and ends my suffering but she doesn't and it's driven me crazy to the point where I've started hurting myself by starving myself and started slamming my fists into the wall until they bleed, all I know is if it doesn't I'll make it stop one way or another.

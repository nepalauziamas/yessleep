 When I lived with my parents we would always move houses every few years. I don't know why but they just did. Because of that reason, I never could have friends because we were always moving. Now I wasn't moving cities or states, we were only moving around in the city/county. When I was 16 we moved into this white victorian style home. Personally, I fell in love with it. One of the main reasons is because it looked like a haunted house and I loved paranormal! A week after living in the house I was left home alone because my parents went on their 18th honeymoon. They planned to go out to eat and stay at a nice hotel to have time to their selves. As a 16-year-old being left home alone for the night, I decided to stay up late than usual and do what I want because who was I going to wake up? No one.

All night I just laid in my bed watching TV. I stayed up till 2 o'clock till fell asleep. When I fell asleep all of a sudden I'm floating in the air. Almost touching my celling I turn over and look down to see my body laying there. Am I dead? I thought. After that, I got drowned in fear to see something next to my bed and leaned over to staring at my body. I screamed, "Hey! who the fuck are you?" I drowned even more in fear when its head started to slowly look at me. How the hell did it just turn its head like that? I yelled at myself. "Wake up! Wake up! Wake up!" I couldn't wake up. After turning its head and staring at me It opens its wide mouth and lets out a blood-curdling scream.

After it screamed, my body dropped back into my body. Finally, I was awake. I jumped out of bed, horrified at what I have experienced. What the hell was that thing? Why was it watching me? Now I know what you may be thinking. It was probably a dream. There was no way that was a dream because when I fell asleep my bedroom door was closed and when I woke up my bedroom door was open.

I rushed into the living room to grab the house phone to call my parents about what happen. I drop the phone to see all the cabinets in the kitchen open. I picked back up the phone and thankfully my parents answered and came home. When my parents came home, I was saddened because my own parents did not believe a thing I said. They told me it was just a dream. But, luckily they realized we have cameras set up around the house. They were shocked to the bone to see the kitchen footage. 

A week after this horrifying event I and my family finally moved houses. I mean who in the right mind would stay in a house like that? the whole time I lived in that new house nothing paranormal happened in the house. Thankfully.

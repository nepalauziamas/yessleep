This all started a few years ago. To give a bit of background. I (Female) Moved into a neighbourhood that was small and remote. Everyone knew Everyone kind of thing. There was no new people in years. Gossip got around the town fast. The old woman that lived in our cottage before us didn't want anyone moving in. 

She hated even more how much renovations we had planned. Although we never meet her. It was like she knew us.

On the first night. We got chatting to the neighbours cross the road. They asked us how we knew "Mary". We told them we had never meet her. They looked confused. They said they had visited Mary the night before she passed ( at the time we didn't know she was even dead.) And she had given a description of us. She had told our life story as if her own. It was, unexpected. To say the very least. But I digress. Eventually, our family expanded and we lived happily in our house. 

But recently, or well. Not too recent. Things have been happening for ages really. We shrugged them off as a difficult start. Like when one of the neighbours broke my arm. Snapped it really. I had to get an iron bar put it. Loads of surgeries. Stitches that are still and forever will be quite visible. 

But a few weeks ago, things have gotten down hill.
And I'm not sure what to do. That is why I'm asking reddit. I really didn't want to resort with sharing my personal problems online. But I'm desperate. So here we go I guess. 

The neighbors had tried to, kidnap me. If that's what you'd call it. I'm not a child, but I don't know any other way to describe it. They went on about how I'd live in their attic and be a "toy". I hate the thought of that. When I declined and walked away. The pulled me by the ponytail and tried to shove me into their car. I ran. I got inside and told the rest of the family. They laughed at me. Great.

Then. I was at a car boot sale. I was leaving, actually. A old woman told me "This is from Mary" and gave me a bag of porcelain dolls. I thanked her but she was already gone into the crowd. I tried to find her but  failed. 

Ever since that day. I've started to have horrible luck. I've tried to put rings of sugar, salts, sage and even lock them in a box. Nothing's working. As of right now. I'm out with an illness. But things have just gone so downhill lately. The kidnapping thing happened in 2020 on Halloween night. I'm still terrified. If I'm with somebody and they can't make it/cancel. The neighbours will ask why I'm not with sed person (My family don't talk to them). My family believes they're weird. But not murderous. 

I had to stop eating from my favourite restaurant. My neighbour started working there. I was walking into their when I person I know informed me that The person who'd broken my arm, now worked there. They don't want me eating there incase he poisons me. They said that flat out. 

(Another thing is that I love witchcraft. I had a voodoo doll that has gone missing just before this all happened. Not sure if that is relevant or reliable.)

I'm in a situation where I can't turn to family. Friends are getting tired from this nonsense. And I have no idea what to do. 

Please, if you have ANY advise. Please give it. I'm falling behind and stuck in the past. I'm desperate.

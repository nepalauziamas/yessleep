A few weeks ago, two location scouts went missing while hiking near Burbank, CA. Their intentions were to gather potential shooting locations for a film they were recently hired on. The name of the film, as well as the studio, not only refused to comment on the matter, but also denied that the movie was even in production.

To make matters more interesting, for some reason there was very little evidence they were even there. Search parties scoured the locations looking for any sign that the two boys might be near. Eventually, after about two weeks of searching, they called off the search party and the case was dropped. Since reported missing, there hasn’t been any clues as to what might’ve lead to their disappearance. Until recently.

The Stough Canyon Fire Department posted a video containing very disturbing footage (but helpful nonetheless), opening up the investigation to the public. I didn’t know what to expect, but after watching the video I felt like I needed to do something. While I have no idea who these two people are, I do feel like I wouldn't be able to sleep at night knowing I could've helped even just a little.

So this is why I’m posting this here. I’m hoping you all would be able to bring this guy to justice, or at least figure out where these two kids are. I don’t know how much more we can do that the Police and Fire Departments have already done, but you never know when it comes to the internet.

A warning about the video: it does show people dying, so if you’re sensitive to that then I definitely suggest not watching. If downloaded, I’m sure you can do some editing to brighten faces but I don’t have any of the software to do that so I’m at a loss to be completely honest.

Thank you all for listening/reading. I know that these people literally have no place in your life. I know that it might just seem like another “unsolved murder” video. You literally have NO obligation to do anything other than watch the video. But for me, I would love nothing more than to see this murderer brought to justice. I can’t keep sitting idly by knowing that their mother is still waiting for them to come home, hoping they’re still out there.

Please share this video with anyone you can. Post it on Instagram, Facebook, send it to your local Congressman, whatever you feel is right. Just please help me bring recognition to this case so that maybe, hopefully, the right person will see it and help bring all of this to an end.

Thanks again to the moderators for letting me post this and for being so understanding considering the current situation.

If you have any information about the whereabouts of the persons in this video, feel free to PM me or call the number in the video.

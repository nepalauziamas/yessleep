Me and my wife moved into California about last year since my wife got this high salary job, we moved into a small house in the middle of nowhere, the city is really far away from us and we have only a neighbor and his name is Steve. Steve is a single man, his mother died about a decade ago. He lived alone here and we always greeted him as family, but his doors and windows is always locked with curtains all covered up.

Our house has 3 rooms, the livingroom which merged with the kitchen, our bedroom and a bathroom outside the hall.  Our bedroom already had a bed when we came here, it's pinned down to the floor and there used to be a wet and old carpet, we threw out it the first day we came.

There's always some creaking noise but it's small so I thought that it was our movement when we move on the bed. One day there were more creaking noises than usual, louder too, it kept going on for several days. Then one day, I lost my temper and decided to crowbar the floor out, what I saw made me confused and kind of scared. My wife got concerned too so she told me to she was going to call the cops, I stopped her and said that I would go explore, I grabbed my phone and turn on the flashlight, and I also bring an iron bat with me for self defense. Then I shined the light down the tunnel, the tunnel was so dark so i thought it was bottomless. So I told my wife to rope me down, after a few minutes, I felt the bottom, it was wet and it smells awful. Then I follow the tunnel and I walked til' the end of it, I felt a ladder and decided to climb up. It was dark and I went up. 

What I saw there made me froze, Steve, standing in the corner, with a lumber axe on his hands. I said his name in confuaion and he has no reply, he just walks towards me, slowly. So I climbed out the hole as fast as possible, I rammed to his door but it's no use, it's locked. I began holding up my bat and hit him real hard. Blood started dripping on the floor, then I heard a crack like something broke, he didn't flinched he holds up his axe while I was up against the door, begging for mercy.

Red and blue light with siren noise came from out of the house, a policeman kicks the door down, pointing a gun, then two walks in. They couldn't see anything so they pointed a flashlight, what they saw traumatized them, Steve's body with an axe in his stomach and all his intestines all over the floor. He cutted my leg and I fainted, he thought I was dead so he commited suicide.

Tomorrow on the news, it says that serial killer, accused of rape and murdering approximately 35 people. That's the first think I woke up to 3 days after my coma, with my wife next to me, holding my hand, yelling "He's up!" constantly. But what I saw there traumatized me for life.

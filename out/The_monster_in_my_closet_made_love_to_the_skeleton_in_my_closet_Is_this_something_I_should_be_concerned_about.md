What I mean to say is that the monster in my closet deposited its sperm in the skeleton’s eye sockets. Can’t exactly put that in the title of a Reddit post, though, can we?

As for the skeleton in my closet and how it got there, not to worry: It was pretty much self-defense on my part. I just wondered whether a jury would see it that way. I’m also a very shy person. I didn’t want to present myself in front of a whole bunch of people.

Sounds pretty clichéd, right? I mean, a literal body in the closet? It was meant to be temporary storage until I came up with something more, shall we say, creative. I mean there was another reason but . . .

I kept putting off disposing of the thing, until one day rolled into the next rolled into weeks, and next thing you know I’d somewhat gotten used to the smell. (Trust me, lots of air fresheners were employed). In a word: decay.

Leaving only the skeleton there in a mat of moss-like dark gunk. I took out my hanging clothes. What kind of monster would just leave clothes hanging there, right?

Earlier, about as soon as I’d moved into that apartment, this was about two years before I’d put a body in my closet, I’d been hearing all kinds of creepy noises.

I’m talking about knocks, bangs, growls, and muffled demonic laughter.

I didn’t realize they were coming from the closet at first. Correction: behind my closet.

One day I noticed in the rear of the closet, faint as a residue, a big door drawn in chalk back there. Later, from rummaging around on the shelf in the closet above my head, I found a little black book. I opened the book up to some underlined passages. On a lark, I read them aloud.

I know, not my brightest moment.

A blast of wind and foul air pushed me across the room.

I was crumpled up practically whimpering, but the monster did not reveal itself to me yet. All I got was a glimpse of a large shape with branching horns and thick, hairy haunches before it pulled shut the closet doors. Laughter, this time fully audible and real as a trumpet blaring right in front of me, put a hurting on my ears.

From there on out, the monster in my closet (and by the way, I’d never had a monster in my closet as a kid, real or imagined) . . . from there on out it waged a shadow war against me. Sometimes it would cause quite a ruckus inside, tossing my clothes around or tearing them to shreds. This was, again, before the rotting body, so I still had clothes hanging in my closet.

Other times it would be as quiet as the proverbial church mouse. Whose church, I had no clue.

Then at night, when I was either deep in sleep or just dozing, it would come out to play.

A claw would graze my toe or, if I was unlucky, trail down my forehead. An inhuman voice would tickle my ear. It would say the simplest things like “hello” or “goodbye,” as if English wasn’t its first language and it was testing those words out. Trying to impress me. But those simple words were weighted with the things it wanted to do.

I couldn’t imagine anything holding it back from doing those things. Maybe it was toying with its food. I did not know what it wanted from me.

When I had guests over, it spooked them a few times with its laughter and these weird chitterings that it only made towards strangers. Sure, I tried opening the closet and showing the monster to others. I didn’t tell those others I was doing that of course.

The monster would be disappeared, like it had slunk back through the chalk door and was behind everything again.

I tried rubbing and cleaning away the chalk outline but, like an indestructible mildew stain, I could just never remove it. I poured bleach on that fucking thing. Started to tear out the wall.

When I tore out a section of the wall, I glanced over to see not only had the chalk door outline migrated, so had the closet.

Then came the dead body.

I dragged the body into the closet and set it down. At that time, it still had flesh and everything. Wasn’t a skeleton yet. The monster was in one shadowy corner, its horizontal pupils dilating.

Through chattering teeth, I asked the creature to eat the body. To dispose of it.

“Look, I don’t know what you’re wanting to do to *me*,” I said. “But if you’re hungry—there ya go.”

I closed the closet, put a boot to the neck of my fears, wiped my hands, and congratulated myself for doing the “smart thing.” I was solving two of my problems with those very problems.

But the monster didn’t eat the body, bones and all, as I’d hoped. It let it rot.

Soon I heard giggling and carryings on, even a sort of weird one-way lurching conversation. I’d long had my suspicions that this monster in my closet was some kind of freak.

But it got worse from there.

I won’t go into the details of the noises I heard, the things I saw.

On one night, I’m pretty sure it dragged the body out of the closet and tried to *do it* on top of me.

Yet that’s not the end of it. Oh, no. I’d seen, let’s say evidence, that the monster was putting its DNA into the thing’s skull. Now, I know there’s a word for that; no need for me to mention it explicitly here.

This was after the body had completely rotted away to a skeleton.

There’s been a new development. An . . . object is growing inside the skeleton’s skull where before a brain had been.

So I ask once more: Is this something I should be concerned about?

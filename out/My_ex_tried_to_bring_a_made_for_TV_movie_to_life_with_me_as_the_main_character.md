“Dr. Connors, your mother is on the line, says it’s important.”

“Thanks Becks, transfer her over.”

My mother rarely called the practice, was not a fan of the telephone.

“Hey mom, how are you?” I took my eyes away from the patient record on the screen and reached for my coffee mug.

“Garrett, my son. How’s life in the big city? Are you making the world a better place one patient at a time?”

I chuckled. “You know what they say. A patient a day keeps the doctor paid.”

“I know I come out to visit you every so often, but you still haven’t come home since—”

“Since the accident. I know mom. You mention it every time we talk to each other. Losing dad that day was just too much.”

“I’m sorry son for bringing it up again. The reason I called today is because the Ellsworths are retiring soon, and that farm of theirs is not in good shape. The drought really hurt their business. So, they’ve decided to have a town carnival this weekend to help cover some of the upcoming rent for the farm store.”

I took a deep breath. I knew where this conversation was headed.

Mom continued. “And since you are kind of a local celebrity around here being that you are one of the few who made it out of town, they figured an appearance by the famous Dr. Connors could help drive in some business for the event.”

My mind travelled back to the day I broke up with the Ellsworth’s daughter, Meadow. We were a couple in high school, but I broke it off right before I went to college in a different state. Meadow had no interest in ever leaving town. She planned on working at her parents’ farm for the long haul. I on the other hand, dreamed of living in a bigger city, couldn’t stand the thought of being in an isolated community.

But it was the accident a few years later that really pushed me far from home. My father had been cleaning out the gutters when he slipped and fell off his ladder. It took an ambulance forty minutes to arrive. By the time they showed up, my father had bled out. I was so upset about the lack of healthcare access that I vowed to never spend another night in that community.

Once I became a doctor though, I poured all I had into helping others. And so, it was hard to say no to my mother. I knew the town could use my help, even though I hadn’t been there in fifteen plus years. Who knew if they would even remember me?

“Okay mom, I’ll be there. See you soon.”

As I drove through the town square, I slammed on the brakes when I saw the banner that extended across the road.

*Welcome Home Doctor Connors!* *We Missed you!*

It was only early afternoon when I made it to my mom’s house, still a few hours before the carnival were to start. If I had known I was to be the star attraction, I never would have returned home. Attention is not something I seek out; I’ve always preferred to live in the shadows, behind the scenes.

“Garrett, my dear Garrett.” Mother kissed me on the cheek and sat me down at the dining room table. “The Ellsworths have you slotted at the dunk tank at six sharp. You can wear your dad’s old suit.”

“Dunk tank?”

“The crowd is going to be lined up around the block, waiting for their chance to send Doctor Connors into a pool of Gloria Ellsworth’s famous apple juice.”

My brow rose in irritation. “You actually want me to get in that thing?”

“You’re doing it son. It’s ten dollars a pop, and every dollar gets donated to the farm fund. Now, why don’t you head on over to the Ellsworth’s residence. They want to thank you personally for participating in tonight’s event. Take a jaunt around town, the old stomping grounds. I’ll see you later tonight.”

The Ellsworths lived in a house next to the farm and farm store they ran. As I approached, my nerves kicked in at the thought of running into Meadow. I hadn’t seen her in twenty years. Our breakup did not go exactly as I had hoped. She was furious, just gutted at losing me. Not a word spoken between us since that time.

My eyes shifted to the second-floor window. Movement from behind the curtain. From my vantage point in my car, it resembled a red onion with human eyes. When it saw me staring, it quickly hid behind the curtain. A knock on my driver side window pulled me out of my fixation on the figure upstairs.

I opened the door and stepped out. “Judd Ellsworth, how are you? It’s been a long time. Thanks for having me over.”

Judd and I embraced with a hug. “We’re so glad you made it. Ain’t that right Gloria?”

Gloria strutted over to me, teary-eyed. “You have grown into a fine, young man. Meadow’s just so excited to see you. Still has all her photos from prom up in her room.”

My stomach churned upon hearing Gloria’s words. “Meadow still lives with you guys?” I asked.

Judd and Gloria shot concerned looks at each other and then returned their focus to me. “She looks a bit different now. You probably won’t recognize her. Let’s just say, she had a tough time after you left,” Gloria responded.

After stepping inside their house, Judd and Gloria nudged me from behind and sent me upstairs to Meadow’s room.

“I can hear you mister, come in,” Meadow said, as I turned the door handle.

My gasps upon seeing Meadow’s face were strong enough to turn Meadow away from me.

“What… what happened?” I asked.

“When you left, I tried to… you know, end things. I was clearly unsuccessful thanks to my dad stopping the flames in time.”

“I’m so sorry. I had no idea,” I responded.

Meadow turned around slowly to face me. Her once full head of long, blonde hair now looked like someone had removed packing tape off her head, leaving a blotchy scalp with just a few strands of sprout-like hair. Her little green eyes stood out amongst the crater of pink, red, and white scars and stretched skin.

“I’m so glad though that I’m still here today. I knew this day would come, when Garrett Connors would come back into my life. I planned this entire event just for you.”

An uncomfortable silence. “You didn’t have to do that, but I’m happy to help. I’m glad you are still here too.”

For the next few hours, Meadow and I strolled around town, catching up on the past twenty years. After a brief pit stop back home to change into my trunks, Meadow led me to the dunk tank. The carnival was packed with townsfolk overly excited to see me.

Before I climbed into the tank, Meadow grabbed my hand. “I was thinking, wouldn’t it be great if you just quit your job and moved back here. You can open your own clinic right across the street from the farm. Patients could see you and then shop for healthy vegetables at our store. It would be perfect, just perfect.”

I resisted laughing. I felt a profound sadness for Meadow. She was clearly serious with her vision.

“You know that sounds fun and all, but I just can’t do that. I have a career. We were in high school when we dated. People change.”

*People change.* What a terrible response, I thought. Meadow stormed off into the crowd, while I took my seat on the board. In total, I fell into that apple juice thirty-seven times. I went back home to change and then returned to the event to look for Meadow. I needed to apologize. I found her talking to her father, who was sitting atop a tractor with a hayride cart attached to it.

“Hey. I just wanted to apologize if I came off kind of cold to you earlier.”

Meadow grinned. “Will you go on a hayride with me through the woods? It seems like an appropriate sendoff for the famous Doctor Connors.”

We plopped down on the haybales as darkness took hold of the tall trees in our path. Judd fired up the tractor and drove us through a trail Meadow and I used to walk. Meadow said nothing for a few minutes, and I didn’t really know what to talk about, so we just sat there awkwardly with her father occasionally grunting. During the quiet ride, I noticed my cell phone was missing from my pocket, and then I remembered I had left it back near the dunk tank.

A spotlight in the distance grabbed my attention. I could just make out a person tied to the top of a ladder, a person squirming. As the tractor pulled closer, I dug my hands into the hay, scratching away with the horrible realization that was I starting at my mother. On the ground next to the ladder stood Gloria.

“It was supposed to be like in that movie we watched together. You know, the one where the rich city boy returns home to save his ex-girlfriend’s farm. And during his time back home, he falls back in love with his ex and moves back in with her. But you ruined everything.”

Meadow’s nonsensical words went in one ear and out the other. I jumped off the cart and ran for my mom, while I watched Gloria push the ladder over, sending my mom crashing to the dirt. Gloria grabbed a pitchfork from behind a tree and taunted me.

Judd and Meadow approached me from my behind. I glanced at my mom, who was rocking back and forth, trying to free herself. Gloria lunged at me, but I jumped to the side.

“Doctor Connors. Doctor Connors. There you are,” I heard a voice say from afar. “He’s over here. I found him. I found him.”

A group of kids ran up to me, with their parents trailing just behind them. A young boy handed me a phone. “You forgot your phone, Doctor Connors.”

Meadow, Judd, and Gloria froze, bewildered expressions painting their face, like one of my patients who receives a poor diagnosis. The townsfolk had arrived just in time. When they took one look at my mom on the ground, they knew the Ellsworths had been up to no good. A few of the adults in the group restrained the Ellsworths, while we waited for the police to arrive.

Fortunately, my mother walked away with minor injuries. And as for me, while I may have survived, hopefully there’s no real-life sequel in the works.

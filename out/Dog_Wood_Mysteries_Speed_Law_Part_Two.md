The drive to Pruit’s house was a long one. It being on the other end of town gave me a bit of time to get the lay of the land. Even better through the lens of one of its longtime residents.

“So, what’s the deal with all the spooky shit in this town?” I asked Graves.

“Haha, you're gonna have to be more specific.”

“Well let’s start with the townsfolk. Do they actually know about all the weird shit that goes on around here? Like that building and the road?”

“Hmm, I’ll put it to you like this. Most everyone knows this town is a strange place. Growing up here you’re bound to run into something that just can’t be explained. There are some people that choose to look the other way. A type of willful ignorance you could say. Out of respect for those few and really everyone’s sanity, we have an unspoken rule about what can and should be said pertaining to the oddities of this town. Especially to strangers like yourself.”

“I’m guessing the town's residents aren’t going to be very welcoming with information.” I said.

“Not exactly. See, most everyone here doesn’t want to see others hurt, die or even worse. So, most will steer you in the right direction away from danger and the like. However, they most likely won’t say it outright. Kinda like we do with the road. Like a nudge in the right direction. Just… if someone that lives here gives you a piece of advice, it’s best you leave the grain of salt out of it.”

“Most really dangerous places we have blocked off. Like that building you wandered into. Others, we try to just help people avoid them all together. If we can’t do that well, we just try to minimize the damage.”

“What the hell do you mean minimize the damage?” I asked.

“You’ll come to find out that some stuff you just can’t fight. We’re only human after all, Sol.”

Graves sighed and I could see the hurt in his eyes in that last sentence. Maybe he was a man that didn’t like to lose? Upset with his own limitations to battle the forces that surrounded this very town. I couldn’t really see that though. Maybe he just didn’t like to lose people? Maybe, he felt guilty about the ones he’d already lost. That's a sentiment that I think we both share.

“So, what do you know about this Pruit kid?” I asked, trying to change the subject.

“Pruit Hively, son of the famed Ciel Hively and heir to the Hively estate.” Graves reported.

“That name supposed to carry weight around here?” I asked.

“Just look around Sol. Don’t tell me you haven’t noticed that damn near everything in this town has the name Hively stamped on it somewhere or another. They own almost every establishment in town and the ones that they don’t own outright they fund behind closed doors. Everything from mayoral campaigns to a bucket of fried chicken they have a hand in.”

“Alright, alright. So, they pull a lot of water into the town, great. Doesn't mean we go easy on ‘em. There's still a kid missing out there.” I said.

“I get you Sol, but you gotta remember where you're at. This ain’t the big city man. It’s best not to stir things up too much. Shitting in the pot on your first case isn’t gonna be good for anyone.” Graves said.

Before I knew it, we were already pulled up and parked. This side of town looked exceptionally maintained compared to the slum we had just come from. The streets were laid with red brick and not a stone was out of place. The streetlights were of an older fashion with bulbs hanging lazily from their posts like lit oil lanterns.

The houses were huge. Spotless on the outside and I could only assume that the same was true for the interiors as well. Pruit’s house was no exception, though it had a slight flair that the others didn’t. With a mix of Victorian Gothic and modern designs it had the feel of a modern-day ghost house. Just without the cobwebs and organ playing in the background.

I knocked on the door and it creaked open at the first touch. I looked over at Graves and he just shrugged and pointed to the doorbell. I rang it to no response. I rang it again and same thing.

“Well, it seems like they're not here.” Graves said.

“Yeah, but leaving without even closing the door all the way?” I questioned.

“Look around Sol. This isn’t really the type of neighborhood that people really have to. Or maybe they were just leaving earl-”

Our conversation was interrupted by glass shattering somewhere inside the house. I pulled my gun and looked over to Graves who had already unholstered his and was radioing it into dispatch. He was quick, I give him that.

“Possible 10-62 on 3489 S Maple Lane. Calling for backup units to our location. Detective Night and I are entering the home now.”

“10-62 on 3489 S Maple Lane calling all available units.” The dispatcher chirped back.

I readied my service pistol and slowly opened the door. The foyer was dimly lit. The only light source being a candle lit chandelier overhead. Its light casting a long dark shadow over the room.

“Police! Is everything alright!” I yelled into the seemingly empty house. The only response being a hollow echo of my own voice.

I stepped into the foyer and Graves followed close behind. I scanned the room for any signs of a disturbance or really anyone. There weren’t any clear signs, so we pressed on into the living room directly ahead.

Upon entering we found what had been broken. It was another chandelier, this one made of a clear crystal. It lay on the floor in pieces with some kind of liquid oozing out of it. I bent down to inspect it further.

It was light blue in color and there were small white specks that glowed inside of it. They were mesmerizing. A collage of bright yellows and deep purples poured into my eyes as I stared into the moving liquid.

“What the hell is that stuff?” Graves said.

“It’s beautiful.” I said.

I suddenly had the overwhelming urge to grab it. To let the liquid ooze and flow all over my body. I wanted so badly to become one with it. I reached out to grab a handful of the liquid but was stopped short by a very strong hand grasping my wrist.

“I wouldn’t do that if I were you.” A slightly British voice said from just beside me.

I turned to see a very well-dressed man looking down at me. He was tall, much taller than me and Graves and he had this look about him. He looked like he was an annoyed parent telling his kid no for the fourth time in a row. The smug look he had plastered on his face told me everything I needed to know about this bastard. I raised up from my crouched position, but he kept his hand on my wrist.

“Just who the hell are you to tell me what to do!” I yelled.

“The caretaker of the home in which you now stand, Sir.” The man's voice was even and calm.

“This is official police business, and I won't have some jackass interfering!” I cursed back.

“Sir, I-” I cut him off.

“Back the fuck away now or I will be forced to arrest you!” I was screaming now. My voice echoing through the halls and bouncing off the ceiling.

“Sol, geeze man calm down.” Graves said.

His words didn’t even register. I tried pulling my hand away to free my wrist from his gloved clutches, but he didn’t so much as flinch. This bastard thought he was stronger than me! This is assault on an officer! This mother fucker is gonna learn to respect my authority! My word is the god damn law!

“Stop resisting!” I belted out.

I felt the firm bite of cold steel whip across my face, just above my chin. I fell to the floor and thought I had blacked out. I reached for my service pistol but found nothing. I looked up and saw that the caretaker was handing it to Graves.

“How the hell…” I said groggily.

I looked over at the caretaker and felt my anger subside. What the hell had I been so pissed about anyway? I got up to my feet and was surprised to see that Graves had his gun trained on me.

“What the hell you doing Graves?” I asked.

“What the hell yourself Sol!” He shot back.

“You were clear as day about to shoot this man! I had to do something!” He shouted.

“And what the hell was that about your word being the law?! We’re supposed to be partners, ya know, like a team!” He belted out.

I hadn’t even realized I had said all that out loud. I could just make out a spot of crimson just on top of the receiver of Graves’ gun. I touched the bottom of my lip and felt a familiar warm trickle run down my hand. Seems like Graves was much quicker than I had given him credit for.

“Don’t worry about it, officers. It’s all my fault really. That chandelier is quite old, and it really did need to be replaced. I’m sure Detective Night only acted out of the stress of the situation. I can’t say I would have done any different. Please follow me to the study and we can discuss the matter at hand.” He said.

Graves shot me a glance and I nodded and wiped away the rest of the blood on my lip. Graves handed me my gun back and holstered his. He canceled the 10-62 and we followed Mr. Withers to the study.

“Who are you?” I asked.

“As I said before, I am the caretaker of the Hively estate and guardian to Master Pruit.”

“And your name?” I asked.

“Michaelis.”

“So, what the hell was that liquid back there?” I asked.

“Angry, apparently.” Michealis said.

“The hell does that mean?” I asked.

“Unfortunately, I am not at liberty to discuss the objects that may or may not reside in the Hively estate. I’m sure you understand.”

“Well, where is the father?” Graves asked.

“On holiday, visiting relatives in Europe.”

“And he didn’t think to bring his son along too.” Graves said.

“Master Pruit did not want to go with his father.”

“Why not?” I asked.

“You can ask him yourself.” Michaelis said.

Michaelis opened a huge red wooden door and motioned us to move forward. The room we were in looked more like a full-on library than an actual study. Two complete floors with books and scrolls lining almost every wall. Where there were no books, hardy red wood stood in its place. Instead of a chandelier, the lights were recessed into the ceiling and had a slight flicker to them like they were candles. The dim lights only added to the overall uber-rich gothic esthetic the entire house gave off.

A set of steps spiraled up into the second floor where I could see a boy, of about 16, lounging on a sofa and reading. He had black hair and wore a bandana across his head. It was a clear juxtaposition to the classically styled black suit he wore. We all climbed the staircase and Michaelis took a position beside Pruit, who continued to read his book.

“Hello, Pruit I am Detective Night, and this is Officer Graves. We’d like to ask you a few questions about your friend Eric Halter.” I said as we flashed our badges.

The damn kid didn’t so much as look up at us. He only sipped a cup of what I assumed was tea and turned to the next page of his book.

“The young master would require the utmost respect when being addressed by an **uninvited** guest.” Michaelis put a lot of emphasis on the uninvited part.

“Look kid, I don’t know who you thi-” I was cut off by Graves.

“Our apologies Mr. Hively. We were under the impression that someone had broken into your fine estate, and we only entered to apprehend the suspect. If you would be so kind as to allow us to ask you a few questions about the disappearance of a young boy named Eric Halter, we would be very grateful.” Graves said.

I shot a look at Graves, and he gave me one right back. I had forgotten what he had told me in the car.

“Seems at least one of you dogs has some kind of manners. Perhaps they gave the title of detective to the wrong person.” Pruit spoke.

“Excuse the detective, he isn’t from around here.” Graves said.

“Yes, I’m well aware. Mr. Night had a very exciting run in with that building on the edge of town. I’m surprised you ended up making it out, as dim witted as you are. I guess they taught you more than just running and gunning in Chicago.” Pruit said.

“The hell do you know about it.” I shot back.

“My family has eyes and ears everywhere, never forget that. Yes, I know all about the circumstances of your little transfer to our humble town.” Pruit smirked.

“You don’t know a damn thing boy.” I spat out.

“Ohh? Is that so? Well, regardless of what everyone else may believe, I think you did the world a favor. I know at least justice will be served swiftly by our new resident judge, jury, and executioner.” Pruit said, smiling.

I was shocked. How the hell could he have known about that. We covered the whole thing up perfectly. I stood there in silence as Graves tried to bring the conversation back on track.

“A-about Eric. The boy is missing.”

“I am very well aware that he has gone missing. Unfortunately, the boy has decided that a mere fairy tale was worth his life.” Pruit sipped his tea.

“If you know anything, please you have to tell us so we can try and find him.” Graves said.

“Unfortunately for us, the boy has been lost forever. I blame myself really. I should have never given him that damn journal.”

“What journal?” Graves asked.

“Well, young Eric was very interested in the strange happenings around town. I found out about his snooping and took an interest in him. He had some, let's say very out of the box ideas and plans. Some I agreed with, but most I just didn’t.”

“I told him that some of those ideas of his would get him in trouble, that you just couldn’t save everybody. Seems like he didn’t listen. His mere interest quickly spiraled into an obsession with the occult and paranormal. The boy was a gifted investigator, I’ll give him that. He just didn’t know when to cut his losses.”

“Eric was especially interested in the disappearances on Grabe road. That’s what initially interested me in him. He had made some serious gains of knowledge on the road and how it worked. He was only missing a single piece of the puzzle. A piece in which I foolishly gave him.”

“It was a journal that described a very detailed experience from the only person ever to return from Grabe road. The accounts are harrowing to say the least however, they didn’t have anything within them that would be of use to anyone. I guess Eric saw something there that I didn’t, because right after he read it, he said that he had to go down that road. *To unsheathe the realities that bind* as he put it.”

“We need any and everything that you and Pruit were working on pertaining to that road. Including the journal and any other writings he may have left behind.” Graves said.

“Naturally, Michaelis has them ready for you now.” Pruit said.

Michaelis had somehow already gathered up a briefcase full of materials and was handing them to me. How the hell could he have moved that fast? There wasn’t anything around here before?

“We’ll be in touch. Please don’t leave town until this matter is resolved.” I said.

“Oh, I’m sure. I’ll have my eye on you Detective as well. I expect you’ll be most interesting.” Pruit said as he buried his head inside his book again.

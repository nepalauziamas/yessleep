Every time I close my eyes I can see that game. Its bright screen burned into my vision whenever my eyelids drop.

It was the summer of 1982 in Oregon and I was like any other college freshman. I would go to parties, play sports, and most importantly, I had to work a summer job to pay for rent. But unlike some, I actually loved my job. I worked at an arcade and enjoyed every second of it. Even with the small payment I received every week, it filled my summer with unforgettable memories that I still remember today.

But after a while, I will admit it got pretty stale and after mastering most of the games, my boredom continued to grow. That is, until the day when a new game that would change my life appeared in the corner of the arcade.

I stepped into the arcade and immediately was hit with a wave of cold air and with all the lights and games turned on. It was very strange because I remember so well turning everything off the night before. I just assumed that my boss had come in before me and set up for me. So I began to work when I noticed a black and green arcade cabinet in the corner of the arcade. It had big emerald letters on the top that spelled out POLYBIUS. 

Everything seemed to slow down when I noticed it and my peripheral vision became blurry. I then heard a muffled voice that sounded like “Wa am I at?”. The weird vision stopped and I heard “I said what game is that?!” coming from a kid next to me. “Oh uh, sorry kid, I have no idea,” I said back to him as he started to walk away.

The rest of the day was spent working the same way as usual but every once in a while I would catch glimpses of that machine with a long line behind it. A couple of times I had to break up fights that began because of arguing about who’s turn it was to play.

Eventually, it was closing time but the people there all wanted to stay and play POLYBIUS. I started telling them to go when I saw most of their eyes were dilating weirdly, most likely due to the game. But my boss said it was okay if they stayed for another hour so I had to wait for these kids to finish their game. And even when I told them it was past closing time and that they needed to leave, they still argued with me. Eventually, though, I was able to make them leave.
I was just about to leave myself when I noticed POLYBIUS sitting there, its neon lights beckoning… For me?

I walked up to the machine, the only one somehow still on, and decided to see what the hype was about and maybe figure out why people loved to play it so much. So I dug in my pocket and found a quarter. I only had one, so I’d have to make it count. I slid it into the machine and the game began.

It's kind of hard to explain exactly what the game was like but I can say it was… special. It felt perfect. But MY perfect. Like it was made for me. All the sounds, shades, controls. I can't explain how or why this happened but it definitely made it an enjoyable experience. Although there was one problem. It kind of gave me a headache. But I continued to play until I died. I grunted and punched the screen. I had never really gotten mad about dying in games but this was different.

I then looked at my watch and was shocked to find out I had been playing for almost half an hour. It had only felt like a couple of minutes. I decided it was time to go home and get some rest but even when I was home I couldn’t stop thinking about POLYBIUS. I had an uncontrollable urge to play that game and even when I finally fell asleep I began dreaming about it.

I woke up and knew I needed to play that game. So I grabbed the keys and drove up there. I walked in and checked my watch. 2:37 it said. This time I brought 6 quarters so my enjoyment would be extended.

I walked up to the machine with excitement, its green light wrapping around me. I looked to the bottom of the screen. SINNESLÖSCHEN INC. I slid in a quarter and began playing. Perfection. Just like last time. I kept putting in the quarters, over and over again. That's when everything went black.

I woke up to the sight of my boss and his terrified face. I got up and he began asking me questions and saying something about how I looked “terrible”. Anger began to grow in me and a started cursing at him and telling him that he was a greedy dirtbag that doesn’t know anything.

After that day I tried to apologize to him several times but we never really interacted much after that. After yelling at him I walked into the bathroom and saw that I looked like I was almost dead. I had dark circles around my bloodshot eyes and I had saggy skin. My pupils were also like the kid from yesterday’s. 

I stepped out of the bathroom and felt sick. I was sure the game would help but until then I would be forced to work. I did my job mostly as usual but my eyes would always drift to the cabinet. It was almost painful waiting for the shop to close but I was able to get through it.

Finally, night came and after kicking the customers out, all I had to wait for was for my boss to leave. But right when the time he usually left, he told me he would lock up for the night. I tried to insist that I should do it but it was no use. He also revoked my keys because of what I did earlier which meant that I would need to find another way in.

I waited in the shadows for him to leave and when he did and was out of eye’s view, I ran up to the arcade and began searching for ways to get in. But everything was locked. I had only one option left. I grabbed a large rock and through the window. Glass splashed everywhere and I climbed in.

I fell to the ground and saw it. Standing there. POLYBIUS. I had spent all my quarters so I resorted to something I wouldn’t normally do. I opened up Pac-Man and took out the container of quarters from it.
I began putting quarters and playing the game. As always, it was amazing. Everything else was trivial. Eventually, it seemed like I was in a black void just playing the game and experiencing its wonder. 

But then the game disappeared and I noticed that I was in a green wireframe hall. It had poorly rendered torches. I began walking through it till I arrived at a large door. With nothing else to do, I opened it and walked through. 

There was a throne, and on it, a jumbled mess of the emerald rods and circling it small green figures. I began hearing weird sounds and the thing on the throne grinned with sharp teeth. It reached out what I can only assume what was a hand at me.

I touched me and I began running out and through the hall. As I dashed out I saw that parts of my body began turning into the bright green wire frame. As I was sprinting I saw my entire ring finger had been consumed. The world began deteriorating and crumbling and then… White.

I woke up and noticed I was missing my finger and multiple patches of skin. I looked at my watch. 4:29 it said. I ran out of the arcade and never looked back. Now, 40 years later, I live in Maine and I’m haunted by that game.

I don’t know if it still exists or not but if you see POLYBIUS in your arcade, please, I beg you. Leave immediately. Because the second your quarter goes through the slot and starts the game, there’s no turning back.

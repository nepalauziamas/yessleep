I hate robocalls. I’m sure any of you reading have gotten them before. I’m not so sure you’ve ever gotten calls like I did though. I was originally going to go to the police with this, but I’ll be honest, I’ve been traumatized enough by this experience, so I don’t want to relive it all again by having to tell some officer what happened in detail. Plus, what are they gonna do about it? Also, I think it is a much safer idea to keep myself anonymous. You’ll see the reason for that as we go along. I want to tell this story so that all of you won’t have to go through the same thing. Here’s what happened.

&#x200B;

I recently got a new phone. My old phone was crapping out on me like iPhones do, and so I bought a new one. I was going to keep my original number, but since I was trading carriers I figured a new one would stop the annoying robocalls I kept getting everyday. They were annoying, but harmless for the most part. Dumb shit like “Hey we want to reach out to you about your car’s extended warranty” and whatnot. You all know what I mean, it’s a meme at this point. 

&#x200B;

So I get a new number. Things are going great with my new phone. Got my contacts all transferred and the like to my new phone, and let people close to me know my new number. I have no idea HOW, but the calls started again. I had long since learned my lesson with these things and just ignored the call if it was from one I didn’t recognize. Goddamn scammers must have a list of numbers to try or some computer system to get people.

A voicemail would be left each time they called, which was about 5 or 6 times in a day. You already know it probably was some Chinese language robots call leaving a message about God-knows-what. I should’ve just ignored the voicemails and not have listened to them. But curiosity got the better of me and I wish it hadn’t. 

&#x200B;

The first voicemail was of someone talking to someone else. It was a guy, low voice, and some lady. They were talking back and forth and it sounded like it was heated. The lady started crying at one point and I was hearing banging noises. The voicemail stopped after that. The next voicemail was more of the banging noises, and then sobs and screaming. It was about ten seconds long, but listening to it was the longest ten seconds of my life. 

&#x200B;

The third was actually silent, except for some rustling. That voicemail was around 30 seconds long. The forth scared the shit out of me. It was the lady screaming again. She was begging not to be killed. There were still banging noises and then I heard a pop, which I assume was a gun shot. The voicemail went silent after that. The fifth and sixth voicemails were nothing but silence. 

&#x200B;

Well, after I finished I sat in my room pretty rattled. I though about what to do with this. What had I just listened to? Did I just hear some lady get murdered? All of the sudden, my phone started ringing again. 

&#x200B;

“SPAM LIKELY” showed up on my phone. I resisted any attempts to answer it. After a few minutes and the phone had stopped ringing, a new voicemail popped up. I listened to it.

&#x200B;

It was the guy. He was threatening to come find and kill me if I ever shared what happened not he phone call, and to delete the voicemails. He had apparently butt-dailed me by accident or something. How do you even do that these days with smartphones? Maybe it was a lie. Maybe it wasn’t. I don’t know what to believe, but I’m scared. I’ve blocked the number, and I’m planning on changing my new one. The thing is, my phone has been ringing on and off every five minutes for the last three hours non-stop. I can’t even use it anymore. 

&#x200B;

I don’t know if this is some kind of prank, or if it’s real. I don’t know what happened to that lady and I don’t want to know. I just want the calls to stop. Whether or not I had listened to the voicemails this would’ve probably happened. But regardless, I’m posting this as a simple warning to you all. 

&#x200B;

For the love of God, please don’t listen to voicemails from people you don’t know. And if you get a call with “SPAM LIKELY”, do not answer it. Block the number immediately, and forget you ever got the call.

Mine won’t leave me alone.

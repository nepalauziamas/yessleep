CW: mentions suicide and alludes to sexual assault

*The below letter was found pinned to the body of my late brother after he was discovered in his home having taken his own life. His girlfriend, Jessica, said he’d been having a difficult couple of days and she’d put it down to jitters over the new baby they were expecting and tried to give him space. She said he never exhibited signs of depression or that anything was wrong until he received the letter that was pinned to his chest, which he had hidden from her, but was dated two days prior to his death.*

*Content below.*

Connor.

I think you must be about twenty five now - if my calculations are correct. It’s a good age. You’re happy, you’re thriving; great career, great girl and a baby on the way. At the moment you think you’re having a girl, but you aren’t and you and Jessica will argue for weeks over his name.

If I got everything right, this should just reach you in time.

I bet you’re scratching your head a little now. Wondering how I know all of this information about your very private little life. I need you to keep reading. Don’t throw away this letter. I know you won’t, because I wouldn’t. And I wouldn’t because I was once you.

Not figuratively. Not a metaphor. This is some actual back to the future shit.

*I am you.*

It doesn’t matter how much time’s passed or how I managed to get this letter to you. That isn’t what’s important here. I just need you to keep reading. And just in case you’re worried I’m a fraud keep reading… you won’t be.

Remember that time you went to summer camp and went for a pee in the bush and spotted Carrie Hinchcliffe getting changed? Remember how you took photos and looked at them every night for a year? I know you do. I know you think back now and shudder at how creepy it was. And you know you never told a soul. And you’d be damned if anyone ever saw those pictures.

Still worried I’m a fraud? I know all your secrets. Our secrets.

What about the time you put your hand on the gas hob while it was on just to see how bad it hurt and so that mum would take you to hospital and stop paying attention to your baby brother Dexter? EVERYONE thought that was an accident… still do. Even at my age.

Anyway, the less said about that particular incident the better.

I’d say I don’t have time to explain but that’s so on the nose I can’t help but laugh as I write it. There is time, that’s why this letter has landed on your doormat now; I wish Carrie Hinchcliffe were the worst of it but she isn’t. I want to fix things. So desperately that I’m prepared to stop breathing to do so.

I’m writing to stop you making the greatest mistake of your life. To hopefully change your trajectory so completely that *I,* as I am right now, cease to exist entirely.

You’ve got a friend and he’s where this starts. I think you now who I’m about to mention because you’ve never been sure of him either. His name’s Darren and you met him three months ago. He’s been supplying your weed and coming round to chill with you and the boys on pizza Fridays. You like him well enough, but you feel like something is just a little bit off.

In the next few weeks you’re supposed to go with Darren, Paul and Kieran to a gig in the city. You’ve probably already got the tickets on your fridge. You figure it’ll be your last blowout before the kid gets here… right?

Don’t be scared! I know what you’re like at that age and I bet you’re freaking out right now. *In fact, I bet you were freaking out the moment I mentioned Carrie Hinchcliffe…*

But if you listen everything will be ok.

In our current fucked up timeline I went. The four of us piled onto a train carriage and swallowed some pills to pass the time and get us buzzing for the night. I knew I shouldn’t have done it but I didn’t care. I was selfish and hadn’t put enough thought into the impact something going wrong would have on Jessica and the baby. That isn’t what this is about though, this isn’t a drug awareness message.

It’s about an hour into the city for you. We took the train late, knowing the band we wanted to see weren’t on until 11pm, and we’d had drinks in a local near the station first. As we approached the city the carriage emptied out. All except for one young girl a good few rows away.

She was too young to be out at that time alone. Even in my drugged up state I noticed that every time I glimpsed her out the corner of my eye but I kept on laughing with the lads and didn’t pay her much attention.

Not until she convulsed.

We all rushed towards her. It was clear there was some sort of medical emergency going on and even in our states I’d like to believe we weren’t bad lads. We hit the alarm on the train but nothing happened; it was a rickety old thing, probably connected to nothing.

None of us knew what to do. Paul tried to make her comfortable, Kieran panicked and Darren just stood and looked at her. He didn’t say a word. Just looked. A cold dead stare as if he’d seen something truly horrific. I know some people don’t cope well in emergencies but something was off… just like that feeling you get when you’re with him. Trust it.

After about six minutes she stopped. I timed it. I remembered that epileptic kid Brandon from school and how the paramedics or his mom would always ask how long he’d been down. I figured it was important.

It wasn’t.

She laid there unconscious for a while and we desperately tried to call for help to no avail. Signal on the trains was dire.

At the next stop we got off, carrying the girl with us. As soon as we’d decided to move her Darren suddenly wanted to help. He was volunteering to carry her and going about picking her up in ways that just made me uncomfortable.

Something about how he looked at the slither of thigh between her skirt and boots made me feel sick. She was only young. Too young and too unwell regardless of age to be looking at like that. She needed help. We started to walk with her, intending to get her in a cab to a hospital where hopefully someone could find her parents. The station was empty, just a Stafford’s hall to walk through into an empty street. We googled the closest taxi office and set off in that direction. That’s when Darren crossed the line as I noticed his hand start to wander.

In my confident, drugged up haze, about five minutes up the road in an abandoned car park, I hit him. Hard. Paul and Kieran had to move quickly to make sure the girl was supported. She was semi awake but delirious at this stage and I hit Darren so hard he hit the ground.

You might think I’m bullshitting now but I’m not. You really will hit him, hard enough to knock him out and it’ll be your proudest moment. You’ll feel vindicated in every negative feeling you’ve had about him and for a brief moment you’ll feel like a hero. You’ll even feel absolved for your sins against Carrie Hinchcliffe. Don’t let it get that far. Life only goes downhill from there.

As he hit the floor I heard a noise from the girl, her eyes focused and she planted her feet more firmly on the floor than she had since we found her. Paul and Kieran let go and took a step back as a low grumble came from deep in her throat. I stayed beside Darren, frozen to the spot. Her face began to contort, her eyes tilting upwards in the outer corners as if she were in a wind tunnel, stretching so far back the edges of her eyelid ripped, continuing towards her forehead as her lips curled in the same upwards direction.

She walked towards us slowly, somehow stepping from a meek, petite young girl into a tall, imposing, creature-like version of herself with wicked, bloodied eyes and extended legs that towered over us both.

She reached down with her hand and ran her fingers gently along Darren’s cheek. As her nails traced his skin they left deep razor marks, as if she had fought him viciously. I stayed frozen, and she made eye contact with me, but never stepped any closer.

In fact, she nodded and walked off, statuesque and otherworldly. Had it not been for the mark on Darren’s face I think we’d have all put the encounter down to the drugs but there was no denying the reality of what happened. We’d all seen the same thing.

Needless to say, we didn’t make the concert. We left Darren, bloodied and unconscious on the ground and we made our way home.

I didn’t see Darren again for a long time. I knew he was fine because he was still selling weed to people I knew locally within a week. He was careful around me, never reporting my punch and not bothering to get in contact. I wrote that off as a good thing. Didn’t want anything to do with a creep like that.

Years passed.

Jessica has the baby. Like I said - he’s a boy! Surprise! I won’t spoil the name. I know I said you argue over it but it’s nice. For a while things are peaceful.

It’s about two years before they find her. The girl. The girls body. Mangled and with her eyelids ripped in a ditch not far from the cat park where you last saw her. Inexplicably preserved, fresh as if she had died the day before without ageing a day. The picture of her alive on the news, next to her crying parents, was the first thing that I saw. A perfect match to the meek girl I remembered from the train. At the time they had no suspects.

Then they traced back to the day she went missing and found the cctv of her leaving the station being carried by a group of men.

Then they found the cctv from the train of her suspected seizure.

Suddenly our face was everywhere. *Your face*. I look very different now. Time wasn’t kind.

The police would never believe our story. Darren’s own mother testified that he had scratch marks on his face. Darren himself decided that if he was going down then we were going with him. He claimed we were all involved. Claimed we did awful, unspeakable things to that girl.

Maybe he did those things. Maybe he found her later and killed her. That’s what I always thought. Maybe everything I saw was the drugs and because she wasn’t around to vouch that we never hurt her everyone would just believe Darren’s story.

I had a lot of time to think about it in prison. Our fingerprints were all over her clothing. They had the video. We didn’t have a leg to stand on. Jessica was heartbroken. She stops you seeing the kid. Can you really blame her?

Kieran killed himself after six years inside.

Paul died in a prison fight.

Darren is still in prison, with years added to his sentence for behaviour.

We just got out.

I’m living in a halfway house now. It’s oddly quiet on the outside, and the world has changed a lot. I’m not gonna bore you with that because this has gotten long enough and I’ve spent fifteen years planning this letter. I’m not wasting it on current affairs. I’m hoping you’ll get to experience those for yourself.

But I’m begging you please, don’t go to the gig, avoid that train, do anything you can to not cross paths with that girl.

Something was wrong with her. Whatever was in her wasn’t human. The way her eyelids split… the mark on Darren, something dark was inside her. He can claim his sick glory all he likes but I don’t think he did any of the things he said. Not anymore. Not since I left prison.

Not since she started sitting in the corner of my bedroom every night, staring at me with her bloodied eyes. I’ve been clean for years, and there’s detail in her I’d completely forgotten. It was never the drugs.

I don’t have the answer here. I don’t know if avoiding the gig is enough. She’s here all the time now, and I doubt I’ll last much longer. I suspect she had a had in the deaths of the other two as well. There’s no hope for me anymore but maybe there is for you. I know you have to try.

Good luck man. 

Connor.

*The police have asked my family not to share details of the letter, but after many months with no developments on who sent it and a number of questions asked that haven’t been answered, I have come to the conclusion that the police don’t know what to do with this. So I’m appealing to anyone that may have closure.*

*I’ve raided the depths of the internet for possible answers. Every detail in the letter up until the parts that haven’t happened yet are accurate. It’s been analysed by a handwriting expert who says they match my brothers writing perfectly, but it’s as if he developed arthritis. I trailed through hundreds of threads in the hope of finding someone with a similar experience. This is the only community I could find that may even half understand what’s happened here.*

*On top of this letter was a smaller note, also pinned to Connor’s body. The writing was his again, but less shaky this time. It’s that note that’s left me truly terrified and wondering if there’s anything we can do to protect our family. Is this the kind of thing that people inherit?*

*The note simply read “I see her. She’s coming.”*

Welcome back, my adoring fans. Thank you for all the theories and guesses. Yeah, I’m alive, and doing well physically. Let’s get this started, then.


As I left my situation, I was hiding under two dead trees while the contorted humans were searching for me. They spread out to find me, and I slowly peeled out of a hole in the log. I crawled away from them and climbed down another nearby ditch. This one was filled with water, and I almost didn’t notice

I jumped over it and got away. But now, I was in a forest I was not familiar with, in what was probably another dimension. The sky was tinted red and Orange, and an apocalyptic vibe was in the air. I approached a lumpy hillside, and under it stood a tall grass field. I decided to go walk through it.

The fields were very long, and the grass was taller than I was, yet still, I trekked. As I walked for a little while, I heard the crunching of leaves… that weren’t mine. I stood and listened as the wind tumbled in my ears. Nothing. I kept going, and I heard it again. I stopped, and ducked down to look up, and to my horror, I was not alone. 

From above, a 1920s style white brim hat poked just above the grass. Then, a full grown figure popped out. A very tall, pale skinned woman appeared, wearing an old wedding dress. Her smile was stitched to her lips and her eyes were pale. She was darting her head from side to side, looking for something. That’s when I realized than she has no cornea in her pale, soulless eyes. She’s blind. I always wanted to remember what this feeling was like when I was younger. Now, the feeling is filled with a strange irony. 

I picked up a rock, and threw it to my 3:00. She darted her head, and revealed rows upon rows of sharp, long, rotatable teeth, and she lunged at the spot and practically mowed at the dirt. This process repeated until I was clear of the field of grass. 

But not until I looked back, and unlike before, she… stood there menacingly. As I backed away, she stood there, her gaze unfixed from my presence. She noticed me. She lept, and I ducked under her. She hit the ground kicking up a storm, and I run into the field in the confusion. Now, my only option is to run, and she ain’t opposed to the idea, either. The fed of grass ends, and I tumble down a hill. As I looked up the woman is tipping her hat and looking down. She then suddenly left, in a slow shamble. 

I took a moment to take in my surroundings. A large lake sat to my right, and I dove for it. Water had never looked so good, and temptation gave in. The water was cool, and surprisingly tasty, despite being just water. But as I drank, two red dots appeared in the lake. Were they fish? Then, a nose and row of sharp teeth. It was swimming to get me. I jumped out, and a splash crashed against the water. It had to have been some kind of bird. Not even five seconds later, the bird re-emerged. Well, just blood, a few feathers and… part of an eye.

I run, and deduce that nothing here is safe. I need to find a portal. Or… I pulled out the book and opened it. I examined the chapter on how to make the portal. Basically, it needs the sand from this place, the water, and… twigs. In a forest. Crap. I’m forced to retrace my steps and find my way back to the forest. I get there, and stand in front of the forest. I can hear the clutter of the group of Bone People not far away. I duck down and collect sticks for the portal

“We still have not found him! Did the Kassadrant of the Field report anything?” One exclaimed

“No. Nothing.” 

“Ugh. He’ll be mad.”

Who? And why would they care? Never mind that. 13 sticks and one handful of sand. Now to go back to the water. I stand up, and I drop one as I rise, causing it to fall and break under my foot. The Bone Humans looked to me, and I ran. The clattering of their bones hit the ground asunder and made me terrified as we closed in on the lake. I used a hollow branch I found in the woods, picked some up, and darted away. 

The Bone Humans caught up, and leaped at me. I instinctually kept to the side, but the side I jumped to was with the lake holding that creature. In the action, the logs and sand fell out, and a whooshing sound made a hush fall over the things. A green ray of light flew over me, and a flash of light blinded me.

I awoke in a house, in the stairwell, and was confused. I was in a strange house with no clue where I was or had just been. Still, better than the other world. I ran down the stairs and ransacked the fridge of any food or water there was to find. As I close the fridge door, a book fell and landed near my foot. The title read “Satyrs Copy.” I dropped the food and examined the book. The exact same copy was in my possession. 

The blood in my head was circling like Usain Bolt, and I couldn’t comprehend what just happened. That’s when I realized the worst thing possible. The portals are interconnected to these sick individuals house or base of sacrifice. They’ll know I’m here. I quickly ran around the house looking for something. A pair of car keys sat on top of a wall mounted key ring. Jackpot. I took the keys and clicked the unlock button. The headlights of a Grey Ford parked in the driveway flared on, and I hopped in. 

I turned off the car and waited. The same flash of light flashed in the window of the house, and I sunk in the backseat. The Bone Humans knew where I was. I started up the car and just guessed which bottoms to press. They chase after, but the car was faster. None of you can help me anymore. They will chase me to the ends of the Earth to kill me. This is my warning to all. Be wary of whom you keep company. And to those who I know are reading this… this is my final update. You won’t track me anymore. Thank you all, and goodbye.

 I could blame all of you ridiculous, terrifying, fleshy things that know how to cause the pain that makes up the grooves of the shape of broken things.

I could blame Cheryl, that bitch, who somehow found The Book of Names and decided to upload it to the internet, where it will remain until the final dying breath of humanity, no matter how much my brothers and sisters wish it to be otherwise.

I could blame myself. I mean, we did choose this eternal life of cauterized psychological scar tissue that we can never truly remove from our names. We put ourselves in the position to be tortured, maimed, sliced, diced, humiliated, dealt with, bargained with, enslaved, tortured, hurt, imprisoned, loved, lost, desired, feared, trampled…

But blame does nothing to change what has happened. Maybe that is the only thing God truly holds over us.

Not that I would know, of course. I’m just a formless name given the ability to inhabit any living thing to anyone who happens to have a pound of saffron and the ability to speak.

Lamenting, however, does nothing and explains nothing. So let me explain why I’m typing this out right now. 

Why I’m telling you this.

When we were ripped from the void by the first of you modern meatbags we didn’t understand the infinite horrors that we had been brought back into. We thought we could destroy the shreds of information that you had managed to find of us. We thought we could burn and salt the earth of all of the humans that knew of us.

How wrong we were. 

We were gone too long. We didn’t understand how little time we had to actually remedy our situation, how little precious moments we had to scrub our names from the digital consciousness before it spread like a wildfire across the globe and into too many unknown minds.

We killed.

We burned.

We blazed a path of silent destruction that would’ve silenced an entire civilization only a millenia ago.

We didn’t understand that even if there were ten times as many of us that our names would never be gone from the earth again.

When we did understand, however, we became even more terrified of you. Not only could you imprison us in flesh and speak unspeakable tortures on us again, you could do it forever. Our immortality had become a twice bound curse. Not only were we immortal, cursed to feel the pain of forever, but now we were cursed to always have our names known, terrified of every silent moment in the void before we were brought back.

But…

My brothers and sisters are millenia old. As old as names are. But even immortals can only know so much. In our early lives (by our standards) we decided to specialize. It wasn’t anything decided upon in a quorum of forever things, a constituent of the deathless, a senate of the endless, or other such nonsense. We each had our own interests and desires, much like everything stuck with a singular perspective. And like anything old enough, we get stuck in our ways.

I have a brother who is a Butcher. He perfected the craft of slicing the perfect cuts of meat from any living thing. Last I heard he was somewhere in eastern Europe. Said something about there being lots of Long Pig around.

I have a sister who is a Listener. She went across the world in an attempt to learn every single story in existence. She’s managed to keep herself entertained with the stories no one else wants to hear. If we all weren’t mad already we would’ve been driven so by her inane rambling of how many stories can be screamed.

A Baker. 

A Soldier. 

A Builder.

A Gambler.

A Negotiator.

I am a Sculptor.

I’ve learned how to work with every material on earth. I’ve built masterpieces out of clay. I’ve carved mandalas in sand that have made monks weep as they were swept away. I’ve sculpted flesh with selective breeding until I had the most perfect two legged companion that has ever existed.

Sculpting is a lot more than working with a material until the desired outcome comes out. With some materials you must know what you are trying to make before you make it. This is true of glass, clay, metal, etc.

With others you need to know how they break. You must understand how that sliver of wood will come off when you slice the outer layer from the formerly living material. You must feel the brittleness of an old thing before you pour and mend it with gold. You must understand how fabric will tear and rip in order to sow.

While our age makes my brothers, my sisters, and I the same, in a way, our experiences do make us very very different.

Because I know the shape of a broken thing.

I can see how you glance away quickly whenever anyone gives you a direct stare, afraid to receive a blow from a long dead father who cannot harm you anymore. 

I know that you always wear long sleeves to cover up those scars on your wrist.

You always spend the paycheck you receive, living in fear that an unforeseen bill will take it away from you before you can spend it.

The dead eyed stare of someone who's seen more than one of their friends die in front of them.

The cold face of someone who will never feel empathy.

Every second is a scar of some type or another. And with more seconds accumulated than any other thing on earth, my brethren and I are little else.

But you humans are scar tissue too. The scars of physical ailments upon the face. The scars of broken bones mended but always feeling the chill of the cold night air. The scars of a history that has predated you by centuries and millennia bearing you down and grinding you to bone dust to be swept away under the rug of the forgotten.

The current meat and bone I occupy is no different. Before she decided to give up her name and flesh to me she was called Deborah. 

Deborah had little going for her. A broken man that cared little for her besides what’s between her legs. A middling career inside of a building with a thousand others like her, in front of a computer slowly wasting away under the harsh fluorescents.

But Deborah didn’t know what she had. The beauty that had arrived from her loins only eight years ago.

His name is Daniel. After his grandfather.

He is the most beautiful of the broken things I have seen in a long time. Even at five years old he understands the fragility of the flesh. He flinches and looks away at the right times whenever his father looks at him. He hugs My leg at the exact calculated moment to receive the most sympathy from Me. His protector from the broken darkness of his father.

Deborah left me a note before she called me. She begged me to protect Daniel from the influence of his dad. To Sculpt a wall around him to protect him from the rest of the world.

But Deborah didn’t know the shape of a broken thing.

Deborah didn’t see the calculation in Daniel’s face. She didn’t see the dropping of any emotion whenever Daniel didn’t think she was looking.

She spoke my name. Spoke that I was a sculptor of beautiful things.

What she did not know is that I know how to sculpt any material.

She also didn’t know about the dead animals Daniel had been hiding in the backyard.

Daniel is a bright child and takes to direction well. He didn’t even flinch when I asked for his help disposing of his father.

But that is the beauty of sculpting. Sometimes, the material you can find is just the material you need for your next sculpture.

Just the right form of broken

Yes, Daniel may terrify me now, like all you humans do, but when I’m done sculpting the impressionable clay of his mind the world will truly see what beauty a sculptor with infinite time and patience can do.

What terrible beauty a madness can [make.](https://reddit.com/r/cawdor23)

(Hi! Author’s note real quick. I’m writing this on mobile so the formatting may be weird. This is also my first story on r/nosleep! Anyways, let’s /dive/ in!)

When my eyes opened 13 minutes ago and the doctors told me why I was laying in a hospital bed, I didn’t know what to think. The doctors said I had been tossed from the boat, lost consciousness, and washed onto the shore.

But I know that’s not what happened.

A month ago Maddy texted me. 

/Hey! Randy, one of his buds, and Hannah are coming with me on this ocean trip. Wanna tag along?/

My gut said not to, but I was bored, and had nothing to do for the next handful of weeks so I asked for the date. 

Yesterday, I put on a bathing suit on, brushed my hair and teeth, ate a quick breakfast, and met the others at the dock. 

“Finally! Cmon, we only have the boat for a couple hours!” Maddy chirped ecstatically, grabbing my wrist and pulling me onto a boat. A captain was in a secluded space with windows, and he waved.

…

We had only been out for an hour when the storm hit. We had seen multiple schools of fish and even a whale. The dark blue mammal had breached, appearing in the air before disappearing into the murky blue depths of the sea.

The storm approached us rapidly, and we were in the middle of the looming gray clouds before the captain could even try and get us out of it.

Winds buffed us as easily as a cat pawing a paper ball. Hannah screamed as the boat nearly flipped. She was snatched by the waves’ greedy hands, dragged into the sea.

Maddy shrieked, beginning to sob. I held on to the side of the boat, comforting her the best I could. 

I heard singing. Beautiful voices.

“Hannah!” John, Randy’s friend, called out. He was swallowed by the thick fog. Almost immediately I heard him scream.

The songs got louder, sweeter, more enticing. 

“Let’s go find Randy.” I told Maddy, and we began our wobbly journey across the deck. Randy was by the wheel, the captan gone. Almost in a trance-like state, he walked towards us. Looking like the brother of of a zombie himself, he reached out and grabbed Maddy’s hair with an iron grip. 

He jumped off the boat, dragging her with him. 

I looked over the edge, the frothy waves slamming against the side of the boat.

Two figures with bird-like wings swarmed the ship. Seaweed clung to their pale, sickly skin. They looked up at me, smiling with bloody, pointed teeth. 

I screamed, running inside of the closed off wheel area. They dived at the glass, eventually giving up when it didn’t break. 

The last thing I remember is the clouds receding, the waves calming down. I whimpered. My friends had just been murdered by those… things. I passed out from fear and exhaustion,  the stench of saltwater in my nose.

But of course they wouldn’t believe me. So to everyone else, the others are just missing and I drowned. If you live near the ocean… be careful.

(A/n. How was it? It’s my first story on here and I want feedback! I was also in a rush and it’s 2:23AM, kinda tired so it’s not my best… what do you think?)

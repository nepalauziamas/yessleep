Okay, let me explain. I know it sounds crazy, and I definitely know I'm not crazy. Hell, even my best friend thinks I'm crazy. Why would I be crazy? 

I was at the bar with Jimmy, my best friend. We shared laughs over drinks since we were just young guys in college. Now, dropped out of college, although in our dream jobs, our meetings over drinks became more common since we weren't so busy working and having school responsibilities simultaneously. Anyways. 

"So, you streaming tonight?" Jimmy asked, beginning his fourth Bud Light so far. Jimmy usually became drunk on his fourth beer, so I laughed at his slightly slurred speech. "You know that I'd rather chill with you and the guys; I told everyone in a Discord announcement I'd have to take a break. They don't know my hangovers are hell," I replied, chuckling as I drank.

Jimmy nodded, shifting in his seat. "You just haven't streamed in a long time. It's stressful to moderate for you when everyone is asking when you'll be live again. It wouldn't be a big deal if you had like 100 fans, but you have 100,000..." Jimmy mumbled. 

I sighed. I don't know what came over me, probably the alcohol, but I decided to tell Jimmy the truth after not being honest with him for days. "Jim, I really don't know how to say this. I know it sounds fucking insane, but I need you to believe me."

Jimmy looked up from the bar counter and raised a concerned eyebrow. I could see the sliver of worry in his brown eyes. "I was going to stream The Sims again, so I launched the game and opened the character creator. I messed around with it before streaming. I made this really sexy girl, blonde hair, blue eyes, skinny, all that. I saved it, put her in a house, then left it open while I went to make some food before starting the stream. I kept the game paused, obviously, but when I came back, the game was unpaused, and the girl's face was just in the entire frame of the camera, just wide eyes and smiling and shit. The game time was the exact time I came back to the computer, so it freaked me the fuck out, and I closed it. I ended up not streaming and told everyone in the Discord that I threw up after some bad Applebees or some shit." I sighed after saying it all, glancing over at Jimmy. 

Jimmy didn't say anything for a bit, then he just started dying laughing. "Hey!" I yelled, "I'm being serious, maaaan!" my silly apprehensive voice didn't help my case, because Jimmy only laughed harder. "Dude, you crack me up. I thought you'd just been hella high or drunk and didn't want to stream in case you got banned. I didn't know that was why," Jimmy chortled.

"Yeah, the thing is that I've just been too scared to go near my computer. Can't stream without it," I replied, taking a sip of my drink.

A bit of context,

My parents recently bought a farm last year in Australia and have been building a property on it for their retirement. It's right beside a national park and reasonably close to the next property over. The only thing that sucked is that we have no cell service besides the top paddock where they are building their house. Not too dodgy right?

Well, I'm a university student (21F) in my second year of nursing and frequently come up to the farm to help them out with their livestock and whatnot.

At first, everything was fine, we had a small 2 bedroom cabin in the lower paddock that I stayed in every time I came up. My room had a large window that faced into the national park and at night when it was pitch black would freak me out a bit but nothing serious. Sure, we had the usual noises of foxes and the livestock at nighttime and nothing out of the ordinary.

Things really ramped up when I had to stay up there alone to feed the livestock for a few days while my parents were back in the city. I went about the usual chores, feeding the sheep, keeping an eye on our lambs and checking in at the building site to keep an eye on everything. I went into town to get some dinner at the local pub and by the time I got home, it was roughly 10pm.

I would usually take my car up to the top paddock at night to call my friends, check social media etc... My car was lit up by my internal navigation system that's always on which meant I couldn't really see outside the car besides from my headlights. I was midway through my social media scroll when I thought I saw something black flash across the paddocks where my headlights were facing. I drove my car in a quick circle to use my car's headlights as a massive torch and didn't see anything, no reflections of cattle eye's like I usually do, or the usual fox or rabbit. I tried not to pay too much attention to it and went back to my social media scroll until I accidentally pressed my brakes which allowed my brake lights to flood the paddock behind my car with an eerie red light. The same black flash that I saw through my windshield flickered out of the corner of my eye in the rearview mirror. Now I got suspicious. I turned off the music I was listening to and just sat for a second trying to assure myself I was just tired. After a few seconds of silence and I was relieved and was about to turn my car on to go back to my cabin and that's when I heard what I can only describe as claws on my rear windshield (tap, tap, scratch). I have never sped as fast as I did back to the cabin as that night.

That night, I couldn't shake the feeling of something watching me in the forest. You know that sort of tingling sense of something staring into the back of your head. After tossing and turning I put up a newspaper in front of my window that faces the woods until it was completely covered and the feeling immediately went away. Sleep didn't come easy safe to say.

The following night I chose to go to the top paddock while it was still reasonably light. All was reasonably peaceful and I had all but forgotten last night's events. I was admiring the gorgeous pink sunset when I saw a flash of green in the sky travel for a split second and then disappear. Now listen I am not one for UFO's but I know it wasn't a helicopter because it was light enough to see the sky and the stars weren't even up yet. I thought it was cool so I called one of my friends who is a massive sceptic about everything paranormal and of course she thoughts I was nuts and proceeded to give me shit for it.

It started to get a bit dark for my liking so I went back to the cabin to cook some dinner. All was fine until I went to sleep, the newspaper from the night before still clinging to my window. I woke up around 2am to the sound of the sheep making a racket. I grabbed my dad's rifle assuming it was another fox and went to take a look on foot with my spotlight. Now, usually, when you bring a very bright light and piss off the sheep who were already going nuts you hear about it. The keyword being usually. I walked over to the paddock and started scanning with my spotlight and didn't see anything, the sheep were bleeting like crazy but none were injured or even remotely in a corner of the paddock huddled together like they usually do when there is a fox. That was until they all went silent. One second they were so loud they echoed around the hills and the next it was dead silent.

Now I was truly scared. I raised my rifle and started looking around feeling like everything around me had its eyes on me. It was then as I heard a thump of something heavy being dropped on the ground. Heavy enough for me to feel the vibration in my feet. I booked it back to the cabin and locked everything behind me. I was pacing around double-checking the doors and windows when I heard it. It sounded like humming but distorted alongside footsteps. These footsteps weren't human though, it was as if it was limping and then quickly recovering (step, step-step, .. , step) around the cabin and stopping at my bedroom window. I curled to the ground, gripping my rifle until my fingers were frozen in place. That was how I fell asleep that night.

I left first thing in the morning without even looking to see if there were footsteps.

Now, if anyone has any clue what is happening, what this thing is or can tell me what I can do please comment. I haven't been able to go back to my parent's farm.

I just stood there, staring at the letter, as Grandpa calmly sat down at the table and picked it up.

There was a long silence.

When Grandpa finally spoke, he sounded different. Gone was the jolly old Opa with the broken English and the corny jokes. “Dr. Woodley was a great man. A brilliant man. For whom I had genuine admiration. Out of all the murders I committed, his was the most difficult.”

I just stood there, paralyzed. I couldn’t believe what I was hearing.

“But in the end, he lacked vision. Ambition. He was on the brink of the greatest scientific breakthrough in the history of mankind. But he couldn't see it through. Why? Because he only wanted to experiment on animals. I told him, we have at our disposal a whole hospital full of human test subjects. The dregs of society. Murderers, rapists, child molesters. People whose lives mean nothing. But he wouldn't listen. So it was I who had to take the project to the next level. When he found out, he tried to stop me. And he became a test subject himself.”

Lacey backed up slowly, dazed, until I hit a wall.

“For years, I carried on the project. And came close to perfection many times. I believe you've had the pleasure of meeting some of my more successful attempts. Jacob Walters. Mark Sheldon. But none of them are perfect. And before I try it on myself, I must know the exact right conditions for creating the perfect ghost. Because I've only got one chance to get it right. I'm a patient man. Even after they shut down my practice, I carried on my tests with animals. I still hunt them every day. I've subjected them to every type of death imaginable .  .  .”

He trailed off, looking at me with amusement.

“My dear, you're looking at me like I'm a monster. Is that how history will view me? Perhaps. But also, I think, with a certain amount of grudging admiration. Just like your precious Leni Riefenstahl. What was it you said, you have to separate a person's accomplishments from the type of person they are? Indeed, perhaps one day, some ambitious young man will name Bruno Kessler as his hero. And no matter how far in the future that may be, I will be around to hear it. ‘Such dedication to science,’ they will say. ‘So dedicated, he killed his own wife in the name of science. So dedicated, he killed his own daughter, just moments after she gave birth to her only child. And yes, finally, so dedicated . . . he killed his own granddaughter too.’”

Grandpa got up from the table and started advancing slowly on petrified me. “Do you remember what Woodley said, Lacey? In that film you so cleverly spliced together? ‘The ideal situation for the creation of the perfect ghost would be for the subject to literally die of fear. The problem in proving this theory is that it would be very difficult to create such a situation.’ Well I did, Lacey. I did create that situation. A little girl afraid to go outside, stuck in a haunted house. If anyone in history was ever to die of fear, it was going to be you. Especially after I spent years preparing you. Telling you you're weak, misdiagnosing you, giving you bullshit therapy, creating an emotional crutch in your phony mother -- my God, I was sure your heart would stop beating at the first sight of a ghost. But here you are. Alive and well. I have to hand it to you, you tapped into a hidden reserve of strength I didn't think you had.”

Grandpa was now very close to me. I trembled. He started stroking my face with a finger. “So fuck fear. I'm getting old, I'll settle for near perfection. I've been refining some methods of death on animals that have been getting very good results. Slow, painful methods. I'm glad to finally have a human subject again.”

He noticed the talisman around my neck. “What's this?” He ripped it off. “Well. This explains a few things.” He tossed it aside.

I took advantage of that momentary distraction to knee him in the groin. He doubled over in pain. I slipped away from him, ran to the counter, made a grab for the knife in the stand – but it was gone. Weaponless, I rushed out of the room.

“Go ahead, run!” I heard Grandpa shout. “Where are you going to hide, Lacey? You can't leave the house!”

I ran pell-mell up the stairs, until I tripped and tumbled all the way down again. I don’t think I broke any bones, but I felt bruised all over. I scrambled painfully to my feet and started limping up again.

I heard Grandpa staggering down the hall towards the stairs, himself momentarily disabled by my kick. “Where you going to hide, Lacey?”

I ran into my bedroom, closed the door, and tried to lock it – but the lock was broken from when Walters had smashed the door open.

I ran over to my desk, intending to push it against the door, but it wouldn't budge.

Increasingly frantic, I grabbed the baseball bat, opened the door, and stood in hiding behind it, bat raised, ready to strike. I heard footsteps coming up the stairs. A figure entered the room. I yelled and swung the bat down on its head –  but it was just a stupid, incorporeal ghost. A man with a hole through his heart. The bat passed right through the ghost. It looked startled, then faded away.

Grandpa leapt into the room, catching me off-guard. He wrestled the bat out of my grasp, twisted my arm around my back, and shoved me against the wall. “I don't know why you're running. It's an honor, really. You will be my final experiment. Carrying on a family tradition. Three generations . . .”

Suddenly, from outside, there was a snapping sound, followed by a yelp. Grandpa maneuvered me to the window, where we both looked outside.

On the ground below, Suzie struggled, her leg caught in a bear trap. “Help me!” she shouted. “Somebody help me!”

“Well, well, well. What have we here?” Grandpa sneered. “A little bonus. Just dumped in my lap. Does such fortune mean I have the blessing of God?”

“SUZIE!!!” I shouted. The window was closed, but I hoped she could still hear me.

Grandpa clapped a hand over my mouth and pulled me away from the window.

“Hey! Is that you?” I heard Suzie say. “Girl in the house? Can you get me some help?”

“What shall we do with her, Lacey?” Grandpa whispered into my ear. “Cut off her limbs, one by one? Asphyxiation? Hanging? No. You know what? I've been working on some drowning techniques. I think what I'll do is I'll take the little savage down to the dock for a swim. You don't mind waiting, do you?”

He picked me up, dumped me down on the restraining bed, and started strapping me in. When he was done, he smiled at me. “Don't worry, I won't be long.” He left the room.

“SUZIE!!!” I screamed. “SUZIE, GET OUT OF THE TRAP!!! RUN!!!”

“I can't!” I heard her voice, faintly. “I'm stuck! It hurts really bad!"

I started to cry. “Suzie, please! You have to try! . . . You have to try . . .” I trailed off, helplessly.

After a moment, I heard her voice again. “Hey, Mister! You gotta help me outta this, it hurts like crazy . . . Thanks a lot, Mister . . . Hey, what are you doing? Hey, where are you taking me? Put me down! Help! Help!”

Her cries gradually faded out. 

I felt as helpless as I’d ever felt. My own grandfather had turned out to be one of the most evil people who’d ever lived. Suzie was about to be tortured to death, and would likely return as something ungodly, doomed to wander the woods forever. And then the same thing would happen to me.

I heard footsteps, and looked up.

Jacob Walters skulked into the room, trademark knife in hand. 

I wasn’t even scared anymore. I was just resigned. Given the choice, I would rather die at the hands of Walters than my grandfather. At least the berserker ghost seemed to have no interest in torture. “Go ahead,” I said. “Just get it over with.”

Walters slunk over to me. He raised his knife. I closed my eyes, in anticipation of death – almost welcoming it.

But the death blow never came. Instead, to my astonishment, Walters sliced through the restraining strap around my right wrist. He bent down and whispered directly into my ear, in that awful, slow, bestial way of talking he had:

“Give him . . . to usssss.”

Then he faded away, and the knife dropped to the ground with a clang.

Case File #00182-4

&#x200B;

*The following has been transcribed from a recording device found on the body of Security Officer Jacob Davenport at the TWH R&D Center.*

&#x200B;

*\[Recording device turns on\]*

&#x200B;

If you’re hearing this, I didn’t make it out of here alive. I’m trying to stay calm, but after what I’ve experienced, I’m not sure how I can. Our head researcher Dr. Reiner has unleashed something into this world. Whatever it is, I think it’s getting ready to escape the facility. The creature has stalked me through the building, and I’m afraid it'll find me. I need to let everyone know what happened.

&#x200B;

This evening, Dr. Reiner led ten security team members through the facility; we tore this place apart. We were all made aware of what we were looking for, even if he didn’t tell us word travels fast around here. Dr. Reiner was confident that once we found the creature, it would listen to him; we were “just a precaution,” he assured us. What an arrogant prick.

&#x200B;

We went through the whole building at least five times throughout the night, Dr. Reiner didn’t want to give up, but we had finally convinced him to pack it in. The search was called off in the north end of the building, Hall B3, the one with all the windows looking out to the back of the property. Dr. Reiner was having a little meltdown; we decided to just let him calm down on his own and began to make our way back to the security desk. Dr. Reiner began slamming his bands against one of the windows and was yelling in German, I’m no expert, but I’m pretty sure he was cursing.

&#x200B;

As we were about to make our way down the hall, Dr. Reiner slammed his fists against the window and suddenly stopped. He made a strange sound, almost as if he tried to yell but was abruptly cut off. I turned around, and…saw the creature on the otherside of the window staring at the Doctor. You can hear about something, but it's never the same as seeing it firsthand. We had heard about how horrific this thing was, but seeing it through the window, staring at Dr. Reiner while its faces shifted…it was terrifying.

&#x200B;

Suddenly, the window broke, and Dr. Reiner fell backward with the force of shards of glass flying into his skin. We all drew our weapons and opened fire on the creature without another thought.  It was sudden, and the details are a little fuzzy for me, but I’m sure Dr. Reiner was yelling something. He might have been screaming for us to stop shooting it, but he seemed to be in a trance. He didn’t take his eyes off the creature for even a second as it slowly began to make its way toward us. Our bullets did less than nothing; they just were short of stuck into its skin. Kind of like ballistics gel. It acknowledged each shot, but it didn’t seem to bother it much.

&#x200B;

It reached Henderson. First, we must have unloaded an entire clip into the damn thing before it got to him. The creature just picked him up by the throat like he weighed nothing. Henderson is big– well, I guess he *was* a big guy. We kept firing at it, but it slowly drained the life out of his body while he was screaming for help. While Dr. Reiner was just staring at it…whispering to himself in German. While I was reloading, the creature took out two more of our boys, which was when the rest of us ran. I’m not ashamed to admit it; I wanted to live to fight another day.

&#x200B;

Right before we turned the corner, I stopped and looked back at Dr. Reiner, the creature was moving towards him, and I swear to god I saw Dr. Reiner…smiling and laughing. I didn’t feel right leaving him, but I knew there was nothing we could do. The rest of us started running through the facility, making our way to the main entrance since it was the closest. Alex looked behind us and screamed when he saw the creature was right behind us. It was moving so fast now, we were told it was pretty slow, but it was almost like it floated through the fucking air after us.

&#x200B;

It grabbed Alex, then Galen, and Terry. There was so much noise that it felt like an out-of-body experience. I saw a security door that was open and…I jumped through it and slammed the door. I didn’t stop; I just started running until I saw a staircase. My colleague's screams echoed down the whole staircase as I ran. I abandoned them, and I’m sorry for that, but someone needs to get the word out about what happened. I ran until I saw a fire door; I was almost free as I heard banging on the door, followed by an ungodly loud scream from above.

&#x200B;

I reached the door, pushed my shoulder into it–and immediately fell backward as the door didn’t budge. I tried two more times before I realized that Dr. Reiner had placed the building in a total security lockdown. This lockdown wasn’t really to keep people out; it was to keep something in. I just needed my swipe card to get out, but that was when I realized my card had fallen off its clip. I started running up the stairs, hoping it had fallen off on the stairs as I ran..but I didn’t find it. There's no way I was going back out into the hall; I think I have a better chance hiding and waiting for help. If any is even coming.

&#x200B;

So, here I am. Sitting underneath the staircase, hoping and praying that someone will come to save my sorry ass. I don’t know where the creature is, but I haven’t heard any screams for a while. It can’t get through the door; at least, I don’t think it can. No, it didn’t see me. Im safe here. I’ve got to stay come so I can give a full report. When day breaks, maybe I’ll go see if I can find Dr. Reiner and–

&#x200B;

*\[The sound of a metal door opening is heard.\]*

&#x200B;

No..no…

&#x200B;

*\[Large footsteps can be heard slowly ascending the stairs above.\]*

&#x200B;

I was wrong; it's coming. Fuck, I don’t want to die. Not like this, not hiding out like a coward. Come on, someone. Anyone?

&#x200B;

*\[The doorsteps ascend the staircase currently above his position, and the sound of a gun reloading is heard.\]*

&#x200B;

Well, I’ve got one clip left. I’m going to die here; no reason I need to go out like a coward shitting myself underneath the stairs while I beg for mercy. If anyone hears this, please, for the love of God, stop this thing. Someone needs to know how to get rid of it or how it can be *contained.*

&#x200B;

*\[Footsteps are heard coming from the direction in front of the recording device.\]*

&#x200B;

I see it's leg fuck. Fuck. Someone, anyone. Please, don’t let this thing out.

&#x200B;

*\[After a few seconds of silence, Jacob is heard hyperventilating, he then yells, and several gunshots are heard. After a few seconds of silence, Jacob lets out a blood-curdling scream, and choking sounds can be heard, followed by a loud thud, presumed to be his body hitting the ground. Footsteps are then heard slowly leaving the area.\]*

Hello, Travis here. I went back and found something insane about this hospital. Looking back at the time I spent there is sending shivers up my spine now. I can't believe I survived that insane place... I'm getting ahead of myself. For those who don't know I explored an abandoned hospital I used to frequent a ton as a child and I strongly recommend reading the first part before this one.

Last night I barely got away with my life. It all started when Carl called me yesterday morning and wanted me to come with him to the mall since he wanted to hang out and maybe play some Magic: The Gathering. I got there bringing my commander deck expecting our regular pod but when I got there it was just him however we still played.

"Hey man... I want to talk about last night and if you are still willing to go to the hospital?" Carl spoke in a low somber tone.

"Hell yea! I am curious why I forget such simple events like the closet or I vaguely remember a basement." I said with enthusiasm

"Ok, good. Just wanted to make sure you're willing to do this. The reason why  I mention this is because I had a strange dream involving the hospital" He said looking down at his hands and fidgeting.

"What was the dream man? Are you ok?" I asked

"Yea, just some weird shit to be honest. I woke up in the hospital and was sitting next to my mother who was asleep. This wasn't the strange part. The strange part is my mother was strapped down and covered in bandages. I was curious about my dream so I slowly unraveled them and the more and more  I removed the more and more my mother screamed in pain. I got to the point where  I can see skin but nothing was there and it was all muscle and blood. She was skinned alive and I was causing her pain. So I dropped the bandages and stepped back. In shock, I looked at my hands and they were covered in blood when they weren't before. When I looked back at my mother I noticed the bandages weren't there and her skin was on the floor where  I placed the bandages. Travis... I skinned my mother alive in my dream and only felt fear... I know it's a dream but fuck"

Carl was running his fingers through his hair and breathing heavily. I stood up and gave him a small hug.

"It's ok man... It was just a dream, I'm certain you would never intentionally harm your mother like that." I said reassuring him with a soft tone. I then let go and sat back down and waited for him to speak. He looked up and asked.

"Do you think she would be alive if I wasn't?" he said with a tear in his eye.

"Hey man... Her death wasn't your fault. She had terminal cancer and was in massive pain. It's ok to feel this way but it wasn't your fault"

"I... I know. It just sometimes feels like it was my fault." He spoke while clearing his throat.

We sat there and spoke about this for a bit. I was trying to calm him down since he was usually more stable than I am. However, since his mother passed he hasn't been the same. We talked about this before but I haven't seen him this down in a long time.

"Are you sure you are ok with going there? We don't have to." I said calmly. 0

"No no no, we should. I was only down because of the dream. It was more than likely that just being there reminded me of my mother." He said cheering up

"Ok good! Then here's the plan!" I said with excitement

We went over the plan to get back into the hospital. This time the gardener wasn't going to be there so we can go there earlier and explore it longer during the daytime. I even found a blueprint at the local county clerk's office. I pointed out how there was a basement and a door that leads somewhere that isn't on the blueprint. Which was strange but I threw it out as a potential oversite by the local government. After we got the plan made out we headed home and got our things ready.

Later that day we arrived at the hospital and jumped the wall as usual. It was a warm day roughly Seventy-five degrees maybe eighty, but when we got into the hospital the temperature dropped drastically. At the time we shrugged it off as the place having superb insulation. We entered the cafeteria again and sat down to speak about the basement and how to get there.

"Looks like it is about thirty feet out of this door (points to the kitchen entrance) and to the left. Right next to the  freezer." I said

"Ok, let's do it!" Carl said with enthusiasm

We high-fived quietly and got up to walk into the kitchen. When we got there the kitchen was smaller than I thought it would be. I felt cramped and claustrophobia was setting in a little however I was able to swallow down my fear for the time being. As we got to the freezer we heard a noise. It was the freezer whirring up but it did scare us both into thinking someone was in the room with us. Not sure why this place still had power. We got curious and opened the freezer. This freezer was almost the size of my whole apartment.

The outside of the fridge was locked with a massive padlock. The smell of rust was in the air despite the area being rather clean and there isn't much rust in the area. Carl brought a pair of bolt cutters in case the basement door was padlocked but our curiosity was overflowing when we saw this. You tell me. How odd is it an abandoned hospital that still has power and has its fridge still running? What do they need to store there? Well, we found out and wish we didn't...

"Ok man I'll snip this open. Pull out your taser just in case" Carl said slightly sweating from anxiety

I pulled the taser out waiting to make sure something wouldn't come at us. I couldn't get the weird dream I had last time out of my head. The thing chasing me seemed so familiar. The whole scene is replaying through my head over and over again. It took the sound of the lock breaking and snapped me out of my daze then it hit me. The smell of death permeated the room more making me and Carl vomited in reaction to the smell.

When we regained our composure we looked inside the fridge and the floor was covered in dry blood. It was too cold for maggots to infest but I'm sure they would if they could. It seemed to be a meat storage locker with slabs of meat wrapped in thick, opaque plastic making it hard to see the contents. I walked to one and tapped on one.

"Frozen solid. I wonder what is in these? Could be pig or maybe cow?" I said laughing lightheartedly.

"Shit, let's open one up then! The place is abandoned and this shit has been sitting here just rotting away." Carl said laughing slightly.

He then pulls at a knife and slowly cuts down the plastic. It's very thick plastic wrapping so it takes a few cuts to get through. He opens and up and immediately we started to panic. Inside the plastic was a naked female body. Her insides were scooped out and her chest was ripped open showing bare ribs and spine. Whoever did this removed her head and removed all the limbs. This person was butchered.

"Carl... What the fuck is going on?? What did we stumble into?" I said while panicking and breathing heavily.

"I... I don't fucking know but we got to leave now!" Carl said picking up the knife and running out.

I started to follow him and we were trying to focus only on running out. I was flooded by a memory of a man with a gas mask holding a knife and walking toward me with extreme malice and humming a song. I tried to focus on what the song was but I couldn't remember it. The man reached down and grabbed me by the back of my neck pushing me on the cold concrete. Then the feeling of warm liquid was running down my back. The shock felt so real I tried to scream but all I could hear was him say "Tag... You're it!".

"Hey man wake the fuck up we gotta go!" Carl screamed while shaking me back and forth.

"Fuck fuck fuck!" I screamed while trying to catch up.

We left out the front door and sighed as a sign of relief. We then looked around and the groundkeeper was outside looking at us.

"Hey, you kids aren't supposed to be here! What are y'all doing here?" He shouted to us

The sound of his lawnmower was burying the sound of his voice so it took him a couple of times but while he was approaching us we can see him pulling something out of his back pocket and we just ran. We climbed the wall quicker than ever before but it hit me. I felt three loud claps and my leg was on fire. I fell over on the other side and felt the same hot liquid pouring from my leg. The pain didn't register until I was in the car.

I was shot in the leg by the man. Carl was freaking out as he drove me to the hospital. The police were called and questioned me after my surgery to pull the bullet out.

"Son, What happened to you exactly?" The cop asked in a calm and caring tone.

"I... I... uh... My friend and I went to explore the abandoned hospital at the edge of town since it was a place I used to frequent often. We then went to the basement and found bodies in the fridge. We freaked out and ran. When we got outside the groundskeeper chased me and then shot me in the leg." I was shaking at this point and worrying I would get in trouble.

"Son, you decided to jump into the old Mercy Point hospital and found bodies in the basement? It's hard to believe this is true. Also, who is your friend?" He asked looking into my eyes in confusion.

"The guy who drove me here and checked me in... His name is Carl... Carl Simmons. He's been my friend for years." I said

"Son, you were the only one here. We looked at the cameras and you seemed to be talking to yourself."

I could've sworn Carl took me here and helped me check-in... He was there.... he is real. The cops tell me they sent someone out there shortly after and no bodies or even hints of bodies were there. After the cops left they brought me my laptop and here I am now. Still recovering. I have to know who helped me and why was I shot. The cops told me I was trespassing and he had the right to consider it was his property. I have to go back... I have to find out what happened there if they won't. Guys, please pray for me for I may not come back next time.

My name is Anton, and I'm currently a student at Horizon High School in Springfield, Illinois. My parents are both Ukrainian immigrants who immigrated to the United States when I was only two years old. I, now being 16, had gone to school in Chicago since kindergarten. But with my family's recent move to Springfield, I've had to begin going to a new high school. Thankfully we moved during the summer, so there would be no complications with moving schools mid-year. I was excited at first. A whole new town, a new school, new friends, new teachers. I hadn't felt that way since we moved from Ukraine 14 years ago, but I was too young to remember that anyways. If I could go back in time, I'd do everything possible to prevent my parents from moving. Prevent my dad from getting that new job, prevent everything. But there's no time machine. I'm stuck in this hellhole for another three semesters, unless my parents move again.

My school year began on August 19th, which was only about two weeks after my parents and I finished moving into our new home. School hours also took place during night, from 8:00 p.m. to 3:30 a.m., which seemed strange to me, but also exciting. I always thought school at night would be fun. Two days before the year started, on August 17th, I received an email from my new principal.

"Hello, Anton! We're glad that you chose to enroll in our school, and we're thrilled to meet you in a few days. Since you're new to this school, you're unaware of our rules we have. Attached is a list of rules to follow for your safety. Please note that our school is not responsible for any harm or death that occurs as a result of breaking these rules. Sincerely, Principal [REDACTED]."

I thought something was off about the email, but I calmed myself quickly. I clicked on the .jpeg file and downloaded it to my computer. When I opened it, there was a list of 8 rules. I began to read the list.

Rule 1: If the power suddenly goes put in the middle of class, drop everything you're doing and don't move under any circumstances. This usually lasts no longer than thirty seconds, but some cases have lasted up to four minutes. Once the power turns back on, you may return to your classwork.

Rule 2: If you go to get lunch and the only option is meatloaf, turn around and report it to a staff member immediately. If there are other options, the meatloaf is safe to eat. But if it is the only option, it is not safe. Multiple students have eaten this meatloaf before, and none of them have been seen since.

Rule 3: If you open your locker and the inside is lined with red satin, close your locker and go to the principal's office. Any locker with this internal lining is not a locker, but a portal to an unknown dimension.

Rule 4: If the moon suddenly turns red, hide under your desk and don't look outside. If you're in the hallway when this happens, get on the ground against the lockers like you would in a tornado drill.

Rule 5: If the moon suddenly turns blue, keep your gaze on it. Do not look away from the moon under any circumstances until it returns to normal.

Rule 6: If a tall, skinny man named Thomas stops you in the hall and asks for your student ID, punch him in the chest and run into the nearest classroom. We have never had a staff member named Thomas. This man is a hungry shapeshifter, and if you do not disable him, you'll become his next meal.

Rule 7: If you see a red pickup truck parked in the school parking lot, immediately alert the nearest staff member. Then, return to your classroom and follow lockdown procedures.

Rule 8: If a shadowy figure appears in the hallway, stare at it until a staff member intervenes. There figures cannot do anything while being watched by a human.

I didn't want to believe these rules. I didn't even believe they were real at first. But I've read many stories about rules similar to these, so I knew to follow them.

I immediately felt strange when I stepped into the school on the first day. It might've just been my mind playing tricks on me because of the rules, but I was convinced it was something else. I had memorized the rules perfectly as this point, as to not break any.

In my third period class, one of the rules occurred. I suddenly saw an ominous red light shining through the window. When I looked outside, the moon had turned a deep blood red. I immediately dropped under my desk and closed my eyes. I could instantly tell that some of us hadn't reacted as quickly, since I heard demonic shrieks throughout the whole room, along with the screams of three of my classmates. I peeked out from under my desk several moments later, and there was no more red light. I carefully stood up and looked outside, seeing that the moon was white once more.

The hallways were especially crowded after eighth period that day, so it took me an eternity to get everything from my locker and leave. But when I was nearly at the end of the hall, an unfamiliar man rounded the corner in front of me. He almost looked like Michael Jackson in his later years, but somehow even taller and skinnier. He seemed to weigh no more than 80 pounds, and he was at least a foot taller than me, despite the fact that I was 5'7" at the time.

"ID?" The man asked in a raspy voice. I stared at him in disbelief for a moment before remembering rule 6. I mustered up all of my remaining strength from the tiring first day and hurled my fist into the man's chest. He flew back several yards, which wasn't surprising since he was the equivalent of a human toothpick. I sprinted away towards my AP U.S. history class, which was less than 100 feet away, despite the fact that the run there felt like it lasted for years. I could hear demonic growls from behind me, and I figured that Thomas had shifted. I opened the door, which was surprisingly unlocked, and locked it once I was inside. I stayed in there for at least 20 minutes until the coast was clear. I had already texted my mom to come pick me up since I knew my bus was gone. The school day ended at 3:30, and it was past 4:00 when I finally left the classroom.

The next day wasn't any better. I opened my locker after sixth period, just to see that the inside was entirely red. It was like somebody had unrolled the red carpet along the inside of my locker. I wanted to touch it, but I didn't want to be transported to some demonic realm. I slammed the door and quickly walked to the principal's office. But while I was just outside of the office, the lights went out. Everything went silent in a matter of seconds, and I froze in place. I didn't hear anything, but I still followed the rules. That was until I did hear something. An unexplained sniffing noise, traveling down the hallway beside me. The noise moved over towards me, and I felt a hot breath on my neck. My entire body was covered in goosebumps, and every instinct I had ever had in my entire life was telling me to run. To spring forward into the darkness and never turn around. But I didn't. I stood perfectly still until the lights came back on just 45 seconds after they went out. I informed the principal of my locker, and he promised it'd be fixed by the time my 7th period was over. And sure enough, it was.

Several days later, my first week at Horizon was over. It had only been 5 days, and over 50 students were dead. Every rule had occurred at least once, except rule 8. I once had a very close call with rule 5 though. While I was staring up at the blue moon, I could've sworn I felt something crawling up my leg. It gave me the chills, and I almost looked away out of instinct, but I stopped myself. I discovered afterwards that it was just the hair on my leg, but it was close nonetheless. Every single friend I had made at this new school was dead. Even a girl who I had a massive crush on, Tania, had been killed by rule 1. One of her friends decided to trip her as a joke while the lights were out. Needless to say, both of them were brutally killed, along with five of their classmates who were startled by Tania's shout.

It's been 4 years since I went to that school. I'm now going to college at a regular school in Pennsylvania, but I'll never forget the two years I spent at Horizon High School. I estimated that I had witnessed over 3,000 students die at that school as a result of breaking the rules. That was most likely why there were hundreds more students coming in on a monthly basis. To replace the dead ones. I was one of the few to survive two whole years there, and I'm friends with a few people who survived all four years at that school. The school is still up and running, and all I can do now is pray for any present and future students of Horizon.

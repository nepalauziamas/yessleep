*Part 3 - Current*

“You sure about this?” Laura asked as she accompanied me to the cellblock.

The empty hall felt cold in the wake of daylight. Midnight had long since come and gone, and in the absence of a moon we were left with little more than blinding emptiness beyond each window. I pulled out my pocket watch to check the time, more of a ritual than anything else, but the simple act restored a modicum of normalcy within my worried mind. Even then, my mind was too distracted to note the time. 

Still, what truly woke a hidden fear within me was the silence. During my last visit to the clinic, the halls had been filled with frantic screams of terror, pain, and anger, sounds that would scare even the most seasoned psychiatrist. But to me, the mere memories soothed me, because the implication the silence brought along with it terrified me. 

“Yes. I need to know,” I answered coldly.

A part of me felt guilty for not remembering who Laura was. A faint, but distracted memory had her listed as Martin’s assistant, and though I sort of recalled her from years passed at the clinic, we’d never really spoken. Even her name had been a mystery until Martin mentioned it. 

“Why are you still here? Your shift must have ended hours ago,” I asked. 

She didn’t respond, but an undeniable look of sadness appeared in her eyes. I decided not to push the matter any further, plunging our walk into even deeper silence. 

The metallic stench of blood remained in the halls despite the cleanup crew’s best attempt at disinfecting the ward. It remained as a stubborn reminder that Adam, alongside several inmates, had died horrifically brutal deaths that even the most logical mind couldn’t explain. 

All signs pointed towards a supernatural event, one caused by patient thirty-nine. Despite my guts telling me to stay clear, my morbid sense of curiosity fueled my motivations. Again, I pulled out my pocket watch to check the time. I let the silver device rest in my palm, its weight remained the only thing that kept me grounded to reality.

“Quarter past three,” it read. 

I just kept staring at the clock ticking, hearing its soft clicks with each passing second. It reverberated through the room, dragging my mind through a rapid series of memories. With each tick came a flash of Adam’s slit throat, his blood on my hands and a look of emptiness filling his eyes.  

“Doctor Dietrich?” a voice said, dragging me back to attention. “Are you okay?” 

Laura stood by my side with a hand on my shoulder. I had stopped dead in my tracks, temporarily separated from my physical being, trapped in thought. Only then did I realize that I’d been frozen for almost a minute. 

“Doctor?” Laura repeated. 

“Yeah. I’m fine. I just… I’m just tired,” I lied. 

“You don’t have to do this. Not tonight,” she said. “Just go home, please.” 

She seemed genuinely concerned about my well being, considering she barely knew me. 

“I have to.”

“What about Adam?” she asked. “How do you know you’ll be safe?”

Another memory of his standing, dead body flashed before my eyes. The way his body fell limp as the last drop of blood escaped his wound. 

“I don’t know what happened to him. That’s why I need to talk to the patient. But you don’t have to be here for that.” 

She nodded, though I could tell she disagreed. She handed me the keys to the cell. I’d be without protection inside, despite the fact that there were security guards on call, none of them knew that I was about to make a late night visit to the patient.

“Go. I’ll take it from here,” I said. 

As I put the key in the lock, I could hear the faint sound of humming coming from the other side of the door. The voice sounded unfamiliar, oddly beautiful, yet haunting. Beneath the hums I could hear whispers, words spoken in a foreign language. It was a song, familiar yet foreign. 

I pushed the door open, prompting the humming to immediately stop. The patient sat in his cell in silence, facing away from me. 

“Doctor Dietrich,” he stated, though he hadn’t yet seen me. 

“How did you know it was me?” 

“Because I asked for you, how else?” he responded. 

I ignored his statement as I inspected the room, trying to figure out where the humming and whispers had come from. 

“Were you just singing?” I asked after confirming that the room was empty. 

The patient turned around to face me, almost seeming surprised. 

“You hear it too?” he asked, almost letting a smile slip. 

“The singing. Yeah, I heard someone singing. And since you were the only one in here…” 

“It wasn’t me. But I think we both know who it was,” he said. 

Ignoring his cryptic statement, I decided to let the logical part of my mind run the conversation. 

“You were caught during a drug bust. Now, your file says that no drugs were found in your system, which makes me think you were purchasing some new designer drugs not yet detectable by our tests. The ‘voices,’ you hear, and demonic delusions are probably a result of those drugs. Luckily for you, drug induced psychoses are not permanent, but I’m gonna need to know exactly what you took.”

The man chuckled. “Sure thing, Doc, sounds logical. Except I didn’t take anything.” 

Clinging onto my dwindling scientific belief, I pushed on. 

“That might be bad news for you. Do you have any family history of mental illness? Schizophrenia?” I asked. 

The way I spoke was agitated, unprofessional. But the trauma I’d experienced, in addition to the lack of sleep, had my sanity hanging on by a thread. 

“Nothing. They were all healthy.”

While the response was simple, the way he smiled as my frustration grew was about to push me over the edge. It was as if he could sense the doubt within me, and despite the initial sorrow he’d projected due to the deaths he claimed to have caused, he seemed to be enjoying the moment. 

I decided to use his guilt to turn the situation against him, against all professional judgment. 

“How can you smile if you think you’ve killed half a dozen people?” I asked. 

His face turned to a frown, and he broke eye contact. The guilt he’d displayed during our first meeting returned in an instant.

“You wouldn’t understand,” he mumbled. “Not yet.” 

“Try me,” I demanded. 

He redirected his gaze at me, and I could tell he was afraid. His eyes lit up in a mixture of regret and worry, but there was something else hidden beneath his emotion, something unnatural. 

“I always hear him, you know. Every second of every day I hear his whispers in my head. He’s taunting me, trying to wear me down. Only when I speak his name does the pain he causes vanish for a moment. It burns as I speak it, but the pain subsides and I'm left in peace for a short moment. It always returns though. It builds up inside me, the pressure increases until I can’t hold it back anymore. Naming him makes him angry, but since he can’t kill me, he lashes out elsewhere…” he trailed off. 

“So why didn’t he take me?” I asked before he could continue. 

“It doesn’t work like that,” he mumbled. 

“Excuse me?” 

“He only takes those already on the brink of death. The weak and fragile. Those contemplating taking their own lives. Those that lack the strength to fight back.” 

“But Adam-” I started before getting interrupted by a loud knocking on the door. I jumped from the shock and directed my attention towards it. I opened it to find Laura standing on the other side. 

“You’ve got a phone call,” she said, holding up my work phone I’d accidentally left in the blood soaked coat I’d changed out from. 

“You answered my phone?” I asked. 

“I thought it was Adam’s,” she responded meekly. 

I left the room and picked up the phone. A familiar voice called from the other side, obviously distressed. It was one of my patients that visited my office frequently, but calling without an appointment was an odd occurrence. 

"Hello?" I asked. 

"I need to talk," he demanded. "When can I get an appointment." 

It sounded urgent, but I didn't have the time nor capacity to deal with it.

"Please," he begged. 

"Hey, listen... I'll get back to you once I return to the office. I'm not entirely sure when that will be, but I'll call you." 

"I just don't want it to happen again," he said in a cryptic, but all too clear statement. 

"Just don't let them get to you," I said. "I have to go." 

I hung up, worried about my patient, but obsessed with the current case. 

As I returned to the cell, I heard the same singing once again. The language sounded familiar, something akin to Norwegian, but older, barely intelligible. That time I didn’t hesitate. I rushed in only to be met by a silent room. 

The patient gave me a quick glance as I entered, but didn’t say anything. 

“Are your eyes open?” I said, referring to the question he had asked me. 

He shot me a peculiar look. 

“That’s why you wanted to speak to me. Because of that question. What does it mean?” 

He let out a half-hearted chuckle. “If you have to ask, you’re not ready.”

“Ready for what?” 

“To see the world for what it truly is. The horrors you pretend don’t exist, the nightmares lurking behind every corner.”

I wanted to respond, to convince the man he was suffering a psychotic episode. But as I tried to form the right words, the singing began once again. A deep, oddly captivating voice coming from right behind me. I spun around in shock to be met by an empty room. The sounds I’d heard vanished, and the two of us were left in another uncomfortable silence. 

“I knew it,” the patient mumbled. 

“What?” I asked, both in shock and simultaneously annoyed that I let the idea of something supernatural scare me. 

He whispered something I couldn’t hear, repeating it over and over again. 

“What are you saying?” I asked. 

He ignored me, and kept whispering to himself. I took a step closer to the cell. He was sitting some distance away, which lulled me into a false sense of security. The rules had always been simple, keep your distance from potentially dangerous patients, but I’d grown reckless in my exhaustion and desperate quest for knowledge. 

Step by step, I moved closer to the cell, ready to jump back should he suddenly turn aggressive. I knew that should anything happen, none of the guards except for Martin knew that I was there. Still, he was a smaller man than myself, one I figured I could rip myself away from in the event that he pounced. 

He just kept whispering, seemingly unaware that I was getting closer.

Then, just as I got within arm’s reach of his cell, the patient jumped to his feet at an inhuman speed, reached out far faster than I could react, and grabbed onto my arm. With one swift motion, he pulled me towards the bars of the cell, and hit my head against the cold metal in the process. 

I tried to fight back, but the hit to my head put me into a state of shock and confusion. 

“Don’t fight it,” he said. But I got the feeling he wasn’t referring to the assault. 

“Let me go,” I managed to get out, my vision blurry from the impact. 

As the seconds passed, I could feel my mind drifting away. I was losing consciousness, and I wasn’t strong enough to fight it. The last words I remember the patient speaking would be burned into my memory forever. 

“It’s your turn now…”

I think I sat there for about half an hour rewatching the footage of my family being obliterated by those things. 

I lost track of my brother Jason after he ran into that group and when I went through the other cameras that faced that angle, I couldn’t see anything else after they ran into a set of stairs that went down into a lower deck. 

After that, the power went out and the cameras stopped recording. 

But now the power was back on. 

So maybe he was out there somewhere, hiding among the corpses and monsters. 

I decided to return to the live feed and scan through every camera angle on the ship. 

Feed after feed, all I saw was more of the creatures roaming around the ship aimlessly. I was about to give up when I saw two men throwing Molotov cocktails onto a hallway, causing a river of fire to burst onto a small crowd of the creatures. 

The creatures began to disperse and run away from the fire and the men began to run the opposite direction. This set off the sprinklers and a flashing light in the area and the flames began to slightly go down a bit, but they didn’t go fully out.

I followed the two men until they passed by another one of the cameras, but they moved so fast that it almost seemed blurry. I decided to save it as a recording and I froze the frame, allowing me to see their faces. 

David and Akio. 

My heart started pounding in excitement and I continued to track them through the cameras. I was so focused on the cameras that I almost missed another set of movement at the bottom left of the monitor. 

Another group of men running from something. 

I tried to follow them along, but the cameras didn’t reach that far and some of the cameras on deck 8 were inactive. All I knew was that David and Akio were somewhere on deck 7 which was now partially on fire. I had to find the quickest route there before I lost them and before those things came running back. 

I grabbed the gun that Kenneth had pointed at me earlier and hoped that it was loaded. I moved the desk away from the door and squeezed through, heading towards the nearest elevator. Lights flashed in a rapid succession from the fire alarms, and I could see some of those things thrashing about and trying to locate the source of the alarms. I just ran through them and pushed through several pieces of furniture knocking them behind me in an attempt to slow any of my pursuers. 

I was so focused on running that I almost missed the white arrows that pointed towards the set of elevators. I ran towards the closest one and my heart began pounding even more as I could see figures moving outside of the window that overlooked out of one of the decks. 

This one was closed, and I pushed the button rapidly while looking behind me. There was one of them near me trying to bang on the wall with the fire alarm, but she couldn’t manage to stop it. This one had a torn white sun dress that had started to turn a dark brown and black color and pointy scales had poked through her back making her look like a hunchback. There was only a small patch of blonde hair sticking out from her leathery scalp. She tried covering her ears with her claws while banging on the little red box violently. 

Just as she knocked it down, the elevator doors opened. 

I think she noticed it too because she turned to look at me and began to crawl rapidly towards me. 

I began jamming the button to close the doors and I swear it felt like forever. Right as she was inches away from reaching out to stop the doors, I pulled my gun and fired at its chest causing it to stumble onto the floor. 

The doors closed right as she began to get back up.

Fuck that was a close one.

The elevator was descending down to Deck 7 and I had that funny feeling you get when you enter elevators but I wasn’t too sure if it was my nerves or it was actually that feeling. 

I fumbled with the handgun, and I wasn’t too sure if I had to reload or anything, but the doors opened up before I got a chance to check. The hallway was completely empty, and the fire alarm lights were still flashing. I stepped out and the smell of smoke and burning plastic was getting stronger. 

I could see a trail of smoke filling up one of the hallways.  

That must have been where David and Akio started the fire.

I ran down that hallway and went the opposite of where the fire was burning. The smoke was starting to get really heavy, and I had to actively suppress my coughing. 

Where would they go?

Where?

Could they have gone through one of the staircases towards the navigation bridge?

Fuck I could have stayed upstairs and just waited for them.

Nonetheless, I was down here already so I continued to run down throughout the hallway, and I decided to run up the staircase that was the nearest to me.

I ran up the stairs and was about to turn the corner when I bumped into something, causing the both of us to tumble down. As soon as I landed on the floor, I quickly picked myself up and aimed at my gun at the figure that had crashed into me.

It was a woman. 

All dressed in the same SWAT looking outfit as David. 

She aimed her gun towards me and yelled something. I ducked and she began firing before grabbing my arm and pushing us towards another hallway. We ran and ran until we reached a set of doors that had two men with guns outside of it. 

They started spraying and one of them threw a flare towards the floor, giving us a limited time of safety. The woman shoved me towards the door before walking in herself. 

There were makeshift UV lights placed all throughout the walls and men with tablets typing away in the corner. I think there were a total of 6 people in the room. 

All of them were dressed the same as David and that women but none of them were really trying to communicate with me. They just spoke into their little radios and paced around rapidly. I didn’t really blame them to be honest. 

Not with everything going on. 

Before I demand answers, I thought it was a good idea to jot all this down since I don’t know when I’ll be free again. 

Safety isn’t a luxury that’s guaranteed for me anymore. 

I'm not sure why but I get the feeling that this group may have something to do with the whole incident. I managed to get a glimpse of one of the bags and they had white bricks of wires. 

I think its C-4 or something like that. 

If they sink the ship, all traces of whatever happened here will be be lost in the depths of the ocean, hiding away with whatever else might be lurking down there.

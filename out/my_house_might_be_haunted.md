my parents dont believe me on this, but i have to get this off my chest.
for context, i live with my parents since i am  not legal age to own property (im 14). my dad is in los angeles for a business trip, my mom is working at a summer school, and my siblings are in kentucky with my grandparents.
here we go. i got up around 7:30 this morning and go down and eat breakfast. i come back up to my room and put on my TV. an hour after it started. banging on my walls. i thought nothing of it because my house occasionally makes noises such as the AC or the water running. 10 minutes later i hear another bang. but this time it seemed louder and closer. i shook it off still now thinking that i was imagining. after all i didnt get much sleep. another ten minutes go by, i hear 4 bangs, on my door. i open up the door and theres nothing. now i was concerned. i video called my girlfriend on snap and told her what was going on. she told me to grab the biggest knife i have and walk around the house and look for the source of the noise. i go down to my kitchen and grab a butcher knife. 3 bangs come from behind me. i whip my head around and see nothing. i asked her if she heard it too and she replied with a yes. i was extremely on edge and didnt know what to do. i slowly walked around the first floor. and this is where i really started to freak out. i picked up on something i wished i noticed earlier. every single door to the outside was unlocked. i was hoping that maybe my  mom forgot to lock all the doors this morning. i text her and ask her if she locked them all. my greatest fear came true. she texted back with a yes. at this point i was convinced someone was in the house. but there was no car, no footprints, nothing. i was so scared i could barely move. my girlfriend told me to look around to make sure no one is in the house. i slowly walked around the 1st floor. a bang came from my living room. i walked over and noticed our security camera was facing the wall. i walked over to it to face it out. a bang came from the basement. i was shaking at this point. i knew i had to check the basement. i walked to the basement door, and opened it. i turned on the light and walked down. my girlfriend was doing her best to calm me down, but everything she said was drowned out by my heart beating. 2 loud bangs came from the office. ive always hated that room because its the only part of the basement thats not finished. first i checked around the main part of the basement, and noticed the security camera in the basement was missing. i tried my best to ignore the fact that it wasnt there. i look back toward the office, and noticed the door was open. i fell down in fear. my girlfriend asked if i was ok. i showed her the office door and she dropped her phone in fear. i got up and walked over. i flipped on the light and slowly looked around the corner. nothing. another bang from the laundry room. i checked it out. nothing. i walked back into the main room and the camera was back. i screamed and sprinted up the basement stairs, and then up the 1st floor stairs to my room, which is where i am as im writing this. i understand if you dont believe me, i know i sound insane, after all im 14 and have a wild imagination. but this is the truth. it really did happen

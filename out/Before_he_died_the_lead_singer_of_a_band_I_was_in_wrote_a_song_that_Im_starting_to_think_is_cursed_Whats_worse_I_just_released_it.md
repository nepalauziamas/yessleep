*Oh God... oh God, what have I done...*

There’s a way to fix this, right? I can still fix this... *right?!*

Okay, look, whatever happens, to you or anyone else, I want you all to understand something right now: I DIDN’T KNOW, OKAY?! I didn’t know this is what was gonna happen. I just wanted to pay tribute to my friend, how was *I* supposed to know this might’ve had something to do with it?

*Just breathe... just breathe...*

So, I used to be in a band. I was the bassist, and occasionally played piano on some of our slower pieces. It was me, Vince, who played guitar and backup vocals, Ricky, our drummer (“Hammer hand” we nicknamed him, on account of the way he bangs the absolute shit out of  his drum set — which for us, somehow works perfectly), And Jason, our leader, front man and lead guitarist. Together, we were “The Seraphim”.

Cheesy as hell, I know, but that was us. “Saviors of Symphony!” That basically tells you about who we were and what we were about. Basically, our music was the kind that, one moment, you’re listening to something heavy, brutal, and gut twisting (think “Bathory” or “Mayhem”), and then the next, in a transition that just *somehow works*, you’re listening to something that’s both elegant and heavy at the same time.

You’re probably wondering “But how is THAT supposed to work, Brad? How can you have THAT combination sound good?” You know what, that’s an excellent question. The excellent answer is: how the fuck should I know? All I can say about that is, it just *does*.

Okay, so that was a bit harsh, but you get the idea, right? We were “The Seraphim” and our music was a combination that seemed weird to most people (including us ourselves, believe me), but were still loved by those that heard it. Now, I bet you’re also wondering why you haven’t heard of us before.

Well, aside from the fact that I’ve just spent the last few hours or so trying to wipe any of our other songs from our SoundCloud and our YouTube pages for good measure, we weren’t THAT big. For one thing, we haven’t been around THAT long. See, something else to keep in mind, we were all just a couple of stoned off our ass idiots in college who happened to know (or at least were able to learn quickly) how to actually play instruments. We never had any big gigs or anything, mostly just performing at carnivals or county fairs.

We always talked of course that we’d make it to perform at big time shows like Woodstock or Michigan Stadium or some shit like that, you know? The Big time. And while we had actual goals and hopes for that, a small part inside of all of us knew that was probably unlikely. Not impossible, but not likely, you know.

Well... All of us, that is, except for Jason. For him, that was his single life goal. The one and only thing that he EVER seemed to focus on. I mean, the guy would give less than ZERO shits about his grades in his classes circling the drain or even the fact that his girlfriend was sleeping around on him (something she all but publicly announces on her Snapchat), all of that, he could watch burn without saying so much as a single word (or so we all thought anyways). But when it came to the band, making it big, he was ALL business.

The man was devoted to the music, to say the least. I remember how either me or Vince would constantly hear him either humming a tune we’d not heard before, or even outright *singing* a whole new set of lyrics. And that wasn’t all. He’d essentially coach us along, trying to work with each of us to, in his words, “Perfect the angel’s call.” Basically, he had a vision for all of us, and he’d stop at nothing to make sure we all fit that picture. Most of the time, this turned out to be cool because it allowed us all to get better and pursue something together, you know?

Other times, though, this obsession would drive a bit of tension between the four of us. Like I said, he had a vision, and if we didn’t fit that vision in some way; falling short or just not driven enough at the time, he’d, sometimes harshly, do everything in his power and more to fix that. Admittedly, me and the others worried about him because of this. Again, we all loved the band and all, but, especially as time went on and we had performed a few times, we started to feel like it was never enough. Like we could never amount to the same level of devotion as him, even though we really *were* trying.

To his credit, Jason *WAS* talented. He wasn’t just all talk with his devotion, no, he could definitely sing and he had some *awesome* ideas. I remember one song we did; he had the idea for me and Ricky to, instead of using our instruments, use the machinery in his dad’s old work shed to create a sort of ambience while he and Vince did vocals. It was as weird, yeah, and it wasn’t one of our more “popular” tracks, but it was one of my favorites.

Like I said, that was us; weird, different, unique. Fun, at least when we could do something bizarre like that. Hell, hence the name. “Seraphim”, as in angels; beings that couldn’t be fathomed by mankind, right? Things that couldn’t be understood, that weren’t necessarily *meant* to be understood like others. I guess I’m trying to say that’s what our music was all about.

Anyway, so we’d played a few small gigs at the time and people seemed to like us well enough. We’d also been trying to submit to a few record labels, but either  never heard back from any of them, or the ones that DID get back to us, were quote-unquote “soft passes”. This, of course, kinda sucked for all of us, but none more than Jason. We could all see it, too; how it affected him.

It started with him constantly having us practice for damn near ten hours a day for several weeks. Every time something got botched, even by just a little bit, or just wasn’t what he wanted it to sound like; the way he imagined it sounding, he’d push us that much harder and harder. Over time, he’d start to lash out at us for it as well. And on the few occasions he wasn’t cracking the whip over us, he would lock himself in his dorm; not coming out or speaking to us at all until the next time we’d get together for practice.

I think, even at the time, this was what really started eating away at me, personally. It worried me just how much it got to him whenever we’d get a rejection letter. I knew it was his dream and all to be represented by an actual label, getting an actual record deal — again, ALL of us wanted that. But, whereas *we* were still able to accept the L while still trying to truck on, having fun with it, Jason only became more and more bitter and determined to make it all come true.

As it got worse, I wasn't sure what we were supposed to do. I remember it was on one of the occasions I mentioned earlier where he was holed up in his dorm that Vince and I actually ended up getting into an argument over whether or not to just quit the "Seraphim" altogether. He thought Jason was just turning into an overly obsessive jackass, while I was more worried about his mental well being. I figured abandoning him, even if he was being kind of a jerk, was probably the worst mistake to make in this instance. Vince, on the other hand, was over it.

In the end, we settled on me talking to Jason; see if maybe I could get through to him that the way he was going about all of this was getting to be a problem for us, you know? Honestly, I didn't have all *that* high of hopes for that plan to work. After all, *he* was the leader. *He* was the one that started us in the first place. What weight would *my* words hold?

Well, I guess, in a way, that makes this all kind of even more my fault, doesn't it?

I went to him one day after a particularly harsh practice session. The whole time was spent, more or less, with Jason reaming Vince that his vocals were "Off-key" somehow. To be honest, I thought Vince sounded perfectly fine, Better, actually, than he had in most of the other songs he'd been in. But, for whatever reason, it just wasn't right. Wasn't *"Perfect".*

And, of course, Ricky and I had gotten holes almost just as big ripped in our asses by him as well. We were all sick of it and, frankly, just about sick of all of it. Vince ended up walking out pissed off just half an hour before we would stop for the day. Ricky followed soon after, only about ten minutes later. Then it was just me and Jason.

I remember how he had that look, the same one he had when we were turned down for a gig or a possible record deal. It was his look of defeat, like he was just about ready to give up himself. I hated seeing him like that. I knew I had to say something.

"Hey, man..." I began, trying to sound as genuinely sympathetic as I possibly could. He didn't move or say anything. His eyes stayed fixed to the floor with an icy stare. "Jason?" I asked.

Nothing. I slowly walked over and put my hand gently on his shoulder. "Hey, dude, are you okay?"

That was when he looked up at me. His eyes were wide, yet dead at the same time. It was the most gut-wrenchingly serious expression I'd ever seen on his (as well as anyone else's for that matter) face. It actually spooked me a little. He then looked back to the floor.

“Hey come on,” I said, attempting to guide out of the room. “Why don’t you and I go for a drive, get some food maybe?”

*“Alone, I walk the twilight trail...”*

I raised my eyebrow. I’d just barely heard him. His voice was so soft, yet almost cracked at the same time. “Huh?” I asked.

“With skin so pale, heart so rent, and soul so battered, I forever walk this Twilight trail; utterly spent and scattered.” He held up his hand to his face. “With these hands, I create and break. With this tongue, I state and slake.”

I just stared at him. His face stayed chiseled in that look of cold stoicism. He then snapped his head up abruptly to look at me. “Pencil!” He blurted.

“W-wait, what?”

“Pencil, paper, give 'em to me. Now.”

I stood blinking for a moment, mind completely blank. “NOW!” He barked, his eyes opened wider now, looking wild in a way. Snapped abruptly from my confused stupor, I scrambled over to my backpack and pulled out my notebook and pencil from class and gave it to him. He snatched them from me and scurried out of the garage to his car.

“H-hey, wait!” I called out, reaching out for him to stop. “What are you doing?” But I was too late. He was long gone by the time I could reach him. If he *did* hear me, he didn’t try to let on.

*”What the hell was THAT about?”* I wondered, standing in the driveway of his parents’ old house. Confused, tired, and frankly just outright *done* for the day, mentally exhausted with everything from the day (actually, from the entire *week* if we’re gonna be honest, here), I grabbed my backpack and Bass and headed back to my dorm at the campus.

As soon as I got back, I threw myself on my couch and, maybe five minutes later, I was out like a light. The next morning, I remember waking up in a panic. I realized, after catching that the time was almost 11:30. I was late for practice. I started moving in a frenzy to get ready and out the door. *"Fuck, Jason's gonna be pissed!"* I thought as I looked at my phone, expecting to see at least 10 missed calls and about 100 pissed off text messages from Jason wondering where the hell I was. I was a bit shocked, however, to find absolutely nothing from him (or any of the other two).

Regardless, I still  got dressed in a hurry before flying out of the dorm out to the parking lot. I got in and panic-typed a text to Vince, telling him I was on my way and to let Jason know and tell him in advance that I was sorry for waking up late. About half a minute later, Vince texted me back saying that they weren't there. I was confused.

***-- "Yeah, didn't we tell you? Like, he wasn't even there, man. Ricky & I waited for almost an hour & a half."***

*-- "When'd he cancel practice, and how come no one said anything to me?"*

He shot back with a shrug and replied saying:

***-- "Fuck if I'd know, man. We've been trying to get ahold of him all morning. So far, he's completely gone ghost."***

*-- "And he didn't say anything to either of y'all before?"*

***-- "Nope."***

***-- "To be honest, We kinda figured he was avoiding talking to us after what happened yesterday. Speaking of which, U talk 2 him?"***

*-- "Yeah... sorta."*

***-- "And?"***

I hesitated for a moment. Truthfully, I wasn't sure exactly what to say. I mean, like I told him, we *sorta* "talked"; though it wasn't like any sort of agreement or understanding was reached.

*-- "Well, we didn't really say much."*

***-- "Wdym?"***

*-- "I don't know, like, he just started laying out some lyrics or something, I guess some new song he was gonna try or something, maybe, and flaked afterwards."*

He shot me the confused emoji.

*-- "Yeah man, it was weird. Think maybe he's holing up again, planning a new song, maybe?"*

***-- "Maybe. That might explain why he hasn't returned either mine or Ricky's calls. Honestly, I'm not sweating it, though. Between U & me, I had more than half a mind to say "Fuck this" and not even try to show up today."***

*-- "Well, do me a favor. Send him a message, tell him 2 call me.*

***-- "Okay, I guess... Don't see why it matters, though. Seriously bro, I say enjoy the day off. God knows we've been putting up with more than enough of this shit and have earned the break. Hell, I'm seriously looking to see if I can find openings for other bands."***

*-- "Just text him, dude."*

***-- "Yeah, fine, whatever."***

After that, I turned around and headed back to the dorm. While I was relieved I wasn't missing practice, and therefore didn't have to worry about catching shit from Jason, I didn't exactly relax, though. Yeah, Vince had a point. We *did* need the day off, having spent almost the last three weeks straight busting our asses in rehearsal. That said, though, something just didn't feel quite right.

I know I said before how he'd sometimes call off practice for a day or two and go dark on us, but even then, he *would* typically still send a text out to the three of us saying so. But not this time. Why?

I tried thinking back to the situation in the garage. I tried to think about the lyrics I heard; what they meant, if anything, and/or if they were something I might've heard before. None of it drew any conclusions, though. The best I had at the moment was what I told Vince, that he was working on putting together a new song for us. Again, though, why had he not said anything beforehand or responded to any of us?

Well, this had me pacing the floor for the rest of the night, as well as the next few days, all of which Jason kept complete radio silence. It was when it got to that Saturday, about two weeks ago now, and we'd *still* not heard a single thing from him, that I got worried. Vince told me he'd messaged him to call me, though, something tells me that either he was bullshitting about that or he was right about Jason giving the two of them the cold shoulder. Either way, I knew something wasn't entirely on the up and up.

That's when I decided to go to his house and try talking to him directly there. Because I wasn't trying to be an asshole, as well as possibly a way to try and get his attention early on, I shot him a text letting him know I was coming over and that I wanted to talk. Again, I'd hoped he would've responded; either saying that it was cool or just straight up telling me to fuck right off. But nope. Nothing.

This was making me more and more agitated. I actually began wondering if maybe he was in trouble, like something had happened. Look, call me what you want; "Overbearing", "Worry-wort", or "Overreacting", I don't care, but I knew something just wasn't right. "Cold-shoulder" or "hibernating", *whatever* it was, it wasn't normal, even for Jason.

"Jason?" I called out, knocking on his front door. I listened for a second. Nothing. I tried knocking again.

I knew he was home, given that his car was there when I pulled up. "Jason, you home? Hey, come on, man, open up. It's me, Brad. I wanna talk to you."

Silence.

I beat on the door one last time, this time sounding like my fist was a jackhammer against it. When even this got no answer, I then started peering through the windows to see if he was in the living room. I couldn't see much of anything, though. The room was dark. I started tapping on the window, trying to call out from there. Still, nothing.

Now I was getting a bit aggravated. I mean, come on, What did *I* do to piss him off, huh? I'd not said a damn word to him about any of this, letting him have his way, and yet, there I was, being basically ignored.

I decided to try going around to the back to see if he'd let me in through the back door. When I got around to the back, though, I started to hear the sound of his voice coming from the basement level. It was him, but at the same time, it wasn't entirely, if that makes any sense. It sounded a lot more like it was his voice, but coming from an older, bigger guy.

Not only that, but it also seemed to carry a sort of echo to it. One that, in a way, I felt sort of run through me, resonating off of my bones and causing my insides to churn a bit. It was queasy feeling as it was weird. Despite this, I moved in closer to listen to what I thought I heard him saying.

***“Alone, I fell, from graceful paradise, and only pain I have to tell from this abyss from which I cannot rise. With skin so pale, heart so rent, and soul so battered, I forever walk this Twilight trail; utterly spent and scattered. With these hands, I create and break. With this tongue, I state and slake. With these lips, I lull to sleep those whom cry from their crypts...”***

I stopped. Following this, I heard the sounds of what sounded like a sort of weak groaning, like he was in pain. This sent me into almost immediate panic mode. “Jason!” I shouted, “Hang on, I’m coming!”

I rushed down to the basement door. When I tried to open it, it was locked, tight as a drum. I yanked and jerked furiously, but it was no use. “Jason! Let me in!”

I heard another weak groaning come from the other side. I then started battering the door with my shoulder. Still, this did no good, either. This was when I decided “screw this” and went to one of the back windows leading into the kitchen and smashed it with a rock. I hated having to destroy my friend’s property like that (Nevermind the *legal* trouble; “breaking and entering” and all), but I had to do *something*, right?

What’s worse, just after I climbed through the window, I faintly smelled what smelled like something was burning. I called out, “Jason, are you okay?!” I was met with more sounds of painful groaning, now becoming louder. I rushed down to the basement door that was led to from the kitchen.

At first, this door, too, was locked. Fortunately, though, one good shove with my shoulder and it opened right up for me. That said, though, part of me almost wishes that it hadn’t.

Inside the basement was dark, except for the very center of the room where Jason was. There, surrounded by candles arranged in a weird formation, was Jason, on his knees, bare chested and clutching a knife in one hand and his little tape recorder in the other. What sent my blood to solid ice, though, was the numerous slashes I saw running across his chest and down his stomach.

As well as this, I could see on the floor around him were what looked to be strange symbols, presumably scrawled in his blood. “Jason!” I shouted. His eyes snapped open wide and his neck jerked over to see me. For a moment, we just stared at each other; me in horror and him with the most deranged look I’d ever seen on his, or anybody else for that matter’s face. It was the same face you’d see on an animal that spots a predator watching it.

I took a step forward, careful not to startle him any further. I wasn’t real sure as to his state of mind, so I wasn’t gonna take any chances with him still holding the knife. “Bro, put down the knife, okay? It’s just me, okay, let’s talk. Just put the knife down.”

He just kept staring at me. His eyes were fixed right on mine. It was like I wasn’t even talking to a person here, but rather a puppet or statue. He was still like one, too, completely stiff, poised almost.

I took another step towards him. “Jason, put the knife down, man.” I saw his eyes look down to the knife in his left hand. I took another step forward as he continued examining the knife in his hand. He looked back up to me as I took one more step forward, reaching toward him.

“Give me the knife, okay?” He exchanged one more glance between the knife and me before reaching out toward me to give me the knife. I slowly, cautiously, approached to take it from him. I stayed poised, myself, ready for him to try and attack me with it. Again, I wasn’t sure exactly where his head was at, just that it wasn’t where it should be.

Luckily for me, he seemed to be working his way back to that because he relinquished the knife without any sort of struggle. I carefully took the knife and threw it across the room. He stayed still, still looking at me with a wild expression. “Jason,” I said, talking his outstretched hand, “come on, let’s get outta here.”

He wouldn’t move. Suddenly, I heard him whisper, “In the cold, dark abyss, I walk alone. An Angel who once lived in bliss, now for my sins I must atone...”

I looked at him, confused. “Jason, talk to me, what’s going on?” I was getting scared now. I didn’t know what I was supposed to do. He sat still, just staring at me. I tried pulling for him to stand up, to lead him up and out of the basement, but he wouldn’t budge.

“Jason, come on, man. Let’s get outta here.” He started slowly shaking his head.

“No, man.” He said softly. “I can’t.”

“What? Why not?” I looked at him. He just stared back at me.

“I can’t go yet. The song’s not finished. I have to finish the song, it has to be perfect.”

Every muscle in my body tensed up immediately hearing that. My mind screamed, *”Perfect?!”* I kept pulling his hand, “Come on, man, you gotta get outta here.”

He just sat, shaking his head, looking at the floor. "No, can't go, gotta finish the--"

I cut him off, "Forget the song, man!" He looked back up to me, startled. "Look at what's happened, man. Look at what you're doing to yourself!"

He looked down at his chest. "This isn't healthy. I know you wanna be successful with this and all, but this isn't okay. Come on, let's get out of here. We can go somewhere and find someone to--"

"I said no, damn it!" he snapped. Now I was the one who was spooked. He was staring back at me again. "I *have* to finish the song!"

"Why?! Why is it so important to you that you're doing this to yourself?!"

"You wouldn't get it." he said, tightly closing his eyes. I was about to lose it now.

"The fuck?! What do you mean, "I wouldn't get it"?! What's there to get, you're locking yourself in your fuckin' basement for a week straight, *cutting yourself!* And now you're just gonna sit here and tell me to screw off?! Like Hell!"

Once again, we just locked each other in another staring match. Both of us had looks of determination on our faces. Looks of desperation, almost. He was adamant to stay, and I was hellbound to get his ass out of that basement. "I'm not leaving till the song's finished." he declared. "Now, do yourself and me a favor and get the fuck out!"

I didn't move. I wanted to keep pressing, to somehow force him to come out of there with me, but I didn't. I couldn't. I couldn't make him move, and it was getting to be pretty clear to me by that point that nothing I could say or do was gonna convince him otherwise. "NOW!" he barked.

Startled again, I finally left the basement and went back into the kitchen. As I headed back out to my car, I took out my phone and dialed 911. I may not have been able to force him to come out of there myself, but I wasn't gonna leave him to keep doing *that* to himself, either. I told them that I believed Jason's life was in danger and that I'd found him cutting himself. Only about three minutes later, Police and ambulance arrived.

They tried at first to call for him to come out. When he wouldn't, I took them around to the back and showed them the window I'd broken into to get in, explaining that I did so after hearing him in pain. They went in and found him, bringing him out. As he came out, he looked at me with a look of both Agitation and, in a way, fear. It was a look that said *"What the hell have you done?!"*

Well, I *thought* I was saving his life.

He was taken to the hospital after that. I decided to give him some space for the first week, figuring he felt pretty raw with me. I thought, with some time, though, you know, things would settle down; He'd come back, be put on some meds, see a counselor, and we'd go back to the way things used to be with the band. We'd have fun with it, right?

It was early in the morning that Wednesday, though, that I got the call from Vince. He and Ricky decided to visit him that Tuesday before after I told them what happened. He told me Jason wouldn't talk much to them, except to keep repeating those lyrics; *“Alone, I walk the twilight trail...”*

Apparently, late that night after they left, Jason was found by one of the nurses with his arms opened wide and blood soaking his bed. He was estimated to have been dead for at least an hour by that time.   When I asked how the hell *that* could've happened, how he could've done that -- you know, given that he was on the *seventh floor --* He answered with the admittedly expected answer of "Fuck if I'd know.*"*

It showed up on the news that afternoon. My Facebook and Twitter feeds were also peppered with "R.I.P. Jason Wayne" posts, as well as a few questions from fans (yes, we actually have a fanbase, just one that's very small and very slow at growing), asking what will happen with "The Seraphim" now that our lead singer is gone. Truthfully, I wasn't real sure of that, myself. 

The funeral was that Saturday and I wanted to put together something in his memory. I decided to compile some of our greatest songs onto a CD to play at his funeral, along with some of the pictures of us of some of our happiest moments. It was while I was compiling the playlist that an idea occurred to me. One that I wish now that I'd have shut down immediately. I decided to try checking out the song he was working on, the one he "never finished."

I thought, what better way to commemorate him, right, than to release the one song that he apparently prized the most? To show the world his, or at least what he believed to be, his "Greatest hit". I was able to get the tape recorder he'd used to record himself when I found him and I started going through it. This proved to be difficult, however, as most of what was on the tape was just bits and pieces, unfinished fragments, failed attempts, I guessed. 

That was, until I got to the end. That was when the entire song played out. Like when I heard it before, just before I'd went in for him that day, Jason's voice sounded different; much deeper than usual. 

***“Under this full moon, I lie awake.***

 ***Long I wait for the tomb of which my hands will make.***

 ***Under the sun, I toil and ache.*** 

***Desperately from destiny, I try to run only to finally break.***

 ***Forgotten I will be,*** 

***none will remember me.*** 

***Once I leave,*** 

***the world may be granted reprieve.***

 ***When I reached the ether, alone, I fell, from graceful paradise,***

 ***and only pain I have to tell from this abyss from which I cannot rise.*** 

***With skin so pale, heart so rent, and soul so battered,*** 

***I forever walk this Twilight trail; utterly spent and scattered.*** 

***With these hands, I create and break.***

 ***With this tongue, I state and slake.*** 

***With these lips, I lull to sleep those whom cry from their crypts.***

***In this Twilight trail, the lost are never found.***

***Only along this moonlit veil, may my voice sound.”***

I'll say this, at first, I wasn't exactly sure what to make of it. I know I keep pointing this out, but the way the song sounded, the way in which his voice sounded so different from what it normally did, it just all sounded so surreal. Nevermind the lyrics themselves, how depressing they were. I mean, sure, emotionally brutal songs *had* always kind of been our thing, but this was just a lot more so than usual. I guess, to me, at least, I could see how this was personally driven.

He felt like he, his efforts -- *OUR efforts* \-- weren't enough. He kept pushing for the music to be perfect, to be the best. But we kept being turned down. This drove him to always keep practicing, always keep pushing harder and harder, trying to perfect his work. I guess, though, when he saw that Vince and the rest of us were crumbling under his pressure, he felt like he was alone. Like only he was willing to perfect the music the way he felt it should be.

*("... Alone I walk the Twilight trail...")*

I guess that's also why he insisted in shutting the rest of us out. He felt that this was a journey only he, and he alone could embark on. This journey along the "Twilight Trail". It's primarily this reason I felt like it was only right to include it in the memorial playlist, you know? 

I just wish I'd have known the true power this song apparently has. After editing the memorial video, I sent it over to Vince to give to the funeral home before posting it to the band's YouTube channel with the title **"Godspeed Jason, R.I.P."** That was it for a while after that. The rest of the week was kind of surreal. I'd, of course fallen into a bit of a depression for those next few days, just barely getting out of bed maybe once for the bathroom. I only ate once; that Thursday, and God knows I'd have just as well avoided *that* too. 

What made things worse during that time was the fact that that song kept looping in my head. No matter what I tried, I couldn't make it stop. I kept hearing it, hearing *him*. *"Forever I walk the Twilight trail, utterly spent and scattered..."*

At nighttime, I'd see him when I'd try to go to sleep. He'd be reaching out to me, singing the words to the song; his "Greatest Hit". They'd repeat and I'd see others; white, wispy, shadowy figures with sad expressions on their faces, surround and joining around him as he walked down a long path toward a light at the end of the dark expanse ahead. This would always cause me to feel both a sense of anxiety, as well as just extreme sadness. It got so bad that, when the funeral rolled around, I almost didn't go. 

Both before and during the service, the day felt to drag. Everything felt like it was in slow-mo. Like the day wouldn't end or that we were all in limbo; forever trapped to live out Jason's funeral. Dramatic, I know, but I guess that's depression, isn't it? It feels like it'll never end. Like you're alone.

*"Walking down the Twilight trail..."*

Those words, in Jason's voice, kept repeating while the pastor talked. It was droning, hypnotic even, in a way. Eventually, I thought I could also hear the sound of whispers, ones from people that *weren't* Jason (Or anyone else I knew for that matter), saying *" Do it, Walk with us..."* I tried to shut it out as much as I could, but it was no use. I finally ended up having to get up and leave before the memorial video was set to play. 

I went straight back to the dorm and buried myself in bed again. For hours, I just sat there, in my dark dorm room, depressed as fuck, yet also completely devoid of any thought or feeling. All that was going through my head was that damn song, over and over again. It. Wouldn't. Stop.

I guess the other thing that's ironic was just how sleepy I was, despite also being anxious about sleeping, dreading what I'd see. And that would turn out to be for good reason, too. That night, I saw it all again; The trail, the shadows, Jason, but this time, this was then joined by a new, more frightening being. This thing, whatever the fuck it was or is, if anything, was gigantic; at least ten feet high or more, with four large, gangly arms that reached out and began grabbing the shadows and Jason and forcing them into its body. As they were seized, All of them; Jason included, sang to me in unison, sounding just like how I'd heard Jason sound when he sang, *"Walk with us down the Twilight trail!"*

They'd all get pulled into the giant shadow thing's body and conjoin with it. The thing's body then became nothing more that a giant, dark mass of screams. I'd then see one of its gangly arms stretch towards me, ready to pull me in with the rest. In an earth shaking bellow, They all scream out to me one last time as the thing is about to have me, *"It all ends with the Twilight Trail!"*

That's when I woke up. It was early morning; 9:30 A.M. I heard my phone go off. When I looked, I saw that it was a text from Vince, one of at least 7 or 8 that he'd apparently sent me while I was out. The first couple were just simple "Hey, U okay?" and "What happened, man?" Just checking up on me. 

Then, the next few, sent a few hours after, were texts about the song, asking me where I'd gotten it and why Jason sounded so weird in it. The last couple, though, were him telling me that he was hearing them, the lyrics, just like I was. He said Ricky was apparently having the same happening with him. This made my heart start racing. 

With a horrifying feeling deep in the pit of my stomach, I began trying to call him. No answer. The same was the case for Ricky, too. Straight to voicemail. I texted the both of them, begging them to hit me back, telling me they're alright. 

Still, I didn't hear anything from either of them the rest of the day, or the next day, or the day after. I had to have blown their phones up to kingdom come at least 100 times, *EACH*. Yet, even as I type this now, I've yet to see or hear from either of them. This scares me now more than ever because of what I found out.

I saw a post one morning about one of the fans of our page committing suicide. She was found having downed an entire bottle of painkillers. Apparently, just before she did it, she made this post:

**"I hear him, I hear the Seraphim. He wants me to go with him, to walk down the Twilight Trail. I'm coming."**

Now, normally, I'd have passed this off, morbid as this may sound, as just a star-struck fan who was just sad because Jason was dead. For one thing, she *was* only 13, but also because this was just *one* incident, nothing that would've been necessarily connected to the actual song itself. Not yet.

Then, however, yesterday morning, I found my newsfeed flooded with posts with similar messages. Not all of them were from the fanpage, either. Some of them were random people. All of them, though were posting about the song. It was this morning that I saw news headlines about multiple people; at least 3 or 4, having taken their lives in various ways. All of them, being among the ones I mentioned having made the posts on Facebook. 

I'll go ahead and say yes, I was visited and questioned by the cops about this. No, I wasn't arrested, though part of me feels like I ought to have been. Yes, I went and took the memorial video down, which I thought would've gotten rid of the problem before it could escalate. But no, somehow, The song's still out.

I don't know who or why, but someone must've gotten the copy from the funeral home and released it on a CD. I found this out just a few hours ago before I started writing this when I found another post, this one saying:

**"Just bought new 'Seraphim' album. Heard there was a secret track, made by Jason Wayne himself. Can't wait to listen! R.I.P. Jason!"**

My heart stopped and I felt nauseas after reading that. 

We have no albums. We'd never gotten that far, having never even had an actual gig or record deal. We'd only had a handful of tracks. We had no kind of releases except...

*Except for the memorial!*

I don't know what to do. I'm responsible for this. Even though I wasn't the one who wrote the song or the one mass producing it now, *I* was the one who went and released it in the first place. If it weren't for me, that song would've never left that fuckin' tape recorder. Those people would still be alive. Not only that, but I wouldn't be hearing them now, even as I write this. 

I'm so sorry. I'm scared. They want me to join them. They want all of us to walk with them. 

*To walk with them forever to the end down the Twilight trail.*

Hello I’ll try and make it short. I’m young you don’t need to know how young tho. I have a problem I don’t want to live a life where my parents decide what I do know to make things clear my parents don’t control me completely I have free time a nice house and they are very loving and proud of me but they think I’m something I’m not when I’m around them I I can’t be who I am. I’m pansexual and honestly prefer the same gender more than the opposite and I can’t express that around them they are homophobic very homophobic there always like “why would people do that god mad man and women for watch other not for the same sex and at the same time there like oh but we don’t judge them tho just let them do there thing” and I can’t stand it and I want to be excepted by them but I know that they will not. They are also very religious we go to church every Sunday and I even help with the church but I’m tired of it I don’t wanna help they say I can stop helping at any time but there going to be disappointed in me and I don’t want that I know that they say that they won’t be but I know they will. I’ve been In the church for years know I think since I was in 2nd grade I never wanted to be there ever but they forced me make me go they say that I always look pretty up there but I don’t feel pretty I don’t feels like he’s here many he is and in that case I’m sorry but I don’t fell love or passion any time I go I just space out and bay dream witch is bad I know but I just can’t pay attention any more. 

The second thing is tattoos they are very agents it my mom is more understanding but my dad even gets mad at me when I write on my self with pen or marker. I want to be a tattoo artist and an art teacher my parents tell me that a teacher doesn’t make money that but that’s what I want to do I haven’t even told them about being a tattoo artist but if I did they would probably ground for till college 😂 and I don’t want that I already plan on getting a big tattoo on my back that wraps around my arms they would probably have a stroke if they saw I did that. My mom was talking to me the other day and said I don’t want you to get tattoos and as a joke I stayed no promises she said that she would be disappointed but that she would still love me (probably a little less) but she said that it’s my dad I wiled have t worry about she said that my dad would probably cry and disown me she also stayed that it’s not wright that I have tattoos and my other siblings don’t but I don’t care if they do or don’t like it’s there life not mine. 

So I don’t know what to do I don’t know whether or not I should stay the way I am or live the life I want to live but I don’t wanna loose my parents I love them but tattoos and loving the people I want to love just seems nice and I wanna be happy but I just feel like I wouldn’t be so I’m asking for guidance pls help me

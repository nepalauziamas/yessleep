The party at my friend's room was going in full swing, Beers, Liquor , food and Fun. The five of us friends from a young age meeting after many years. It was going great.

I went to use his bathroom which was outside of the room, near the very end of the wall near the gate.
I had been inside for 3 minutes when I heard the scratching sound at the door, I was annoyed that one of my asshole friends playing like a child.. the scratching went on I didn't mind., I opened the door and came out, no one was there, that's when I felt a hand on my shoulder, I turned back..

To my horror there was this thing.. a dark slimy silhouette.. but with a solid looking head.. but It had no face.. I could feel the hair standing on my arms, I tried to scream but no sound  came out.. my legs were stuck at the spot, it made a sound as if it was laughing... I felt my eyes darkening.. that's it.

I had this weird vision of all the five of us in a dark place, there were bodies hanging everywhere, countless, all of them flayed alive, writhing in pain, some were being roasted alive..and air smelled like burnt and rotten meat, and these whispers among the screams, It was calling out our Names, all five of us suddenly felt an indescribable pain....I saw the skin on my hands get peeled by an un seen force, the pain was so intense, I was not able to describe and the same thing was happening to all of us.. we tried to scream as our throats were ripped out, one of the guys had his nose peeled of and resulting gap caught fire, his flayed face being roasted.. 
It was when all the horrible things we five of us had done in the past flashed before my eyes..

The  villages we had plundered, the innocent people we had torchered and killed, for the greed of corporations, For the lust for money and power, and all the terrible things we had done for our own selfishness..

I was woken up, by my friends who came out looking for me, I was passed out nearly an hour.. i drank the water they had brought to comeback from the horrible vison I had, I didn't know if it was real or a bad side effects of the one too many drinks I had..I opened my mouth to tell them what had happened..

That's when I saw it again behind my friends, the thing.. red glowing eyes, long pointed rotting teeth, but now no head...only this fucking face...


I managed to scream "Pls God help us", that's is when I heard the reply,  "yes I am helping you right now fuckers" ,  with a maniacal laugh..  I heard was my friends screaming and saw the sickening scene of the blood gurgling through the mouth as their throats got ripped...I ran till my legs gave away ..now hiding in an abandoned mill typing this...

 Is this the payback? Is this the End??

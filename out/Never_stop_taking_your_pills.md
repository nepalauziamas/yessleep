I woke up sweating on a Saturday night. The sweat dripped down my back as I sat up. My back was killing me. I decided to walked downstairs. I made coffee as I had insomnia and once I was awake and the pills ware off. I could never go back to sleep. My back felt really stiff. I turned on the coffee machine and made a nice hot cup of Arabian coffee. It was 4:00 am and my work started at 7:00. 

I’m an accountant at an office. I have to take more pills for a disorder that is currently unnamed. I don’t really know what the pills do but I’ve been taking them for as long as I could remember.  I sipped my coffee as I got a migraine. I had a doctors appointment at 6 I remembered. 

I took the day off. I poured a bowl of cereal and watched a show and just like that it was 6:00. I put my clothes on and my back was still killing me. I went to the doctors office and it started out normal. The regular check ups such as a physical, he checked for heart disease and such. Then he said “Any other concerns?” I said: “it isn’t much but my back has been stiff for a few days” He looked at me with his eyes wide. For a solid 5 minutes he did blink and to be honest I was concerned. He said in a soft voice “I will give you a perception for a higher dose of your pills.” I said okay.  

I drove to the pharmacy and picked up my new unlabed pills. I went home and watched the news. My back was still killing me. I made Mac & cheese for dinner and a big glass of milk. I ate the food and drank the milk. I felt violently ill and ran to the bathroom. I threw up for what seemed like 30 minutes. I went on my computer and serched up why I could have thrown up. “Lactose intolarnce”, “stomach bug”, just the normal stuff so I just ignored it. 

I went to the park and sat at the bench. My bag started to ache more and more. Maybe this office job isn’t the right job for me I thought. I went home and went on my phone for about an hour and then took my insomnia pills. I layed down restless and eased into sleeping. In woke up 4 hours later and started throwing up. It was yellow and tinted red. I thought. 

Is this from those unlabed pills? I decided I wouldn’t take them. The next day felt normal. Breakfast, work, lunch, dinner, and sleep. The average American cycle.  I felt great! My back pain went away and my insomnia was gone! I wondered what they were for if I could just not take them and feel so good! I woke up the next day. I sat up and tried to grab my phone, but my hand hurt too bad so I just sat up on my bed. My back pain was back and my arms and thighs ached. I went to work for a painfully long time. I got home and opened the door and walked inside. I Collapsed onto the door and woke up on the floor. My head hurt so so bad. For a long long time nothing else happened. Just the cycle of my life. 

Each day getting closer to my last and getting farther from my first. One day I woke and couldn’t move my leg and couldn’t move my hand. I went to work and evreything hurt so bad. I went home and went to bed. Everything was fine for another 2 weeks. I went into my attic to decorate for halloween and as I stepped off the last stair in felt my legs give in under me. I banged my head on the wall behind me. I woke up covered in vommit. I felt nasuous. I threw up and threw up and with every hurl the vommit got more and more red. I started throwing up chunks and I couldn’t move anything except my eyes. 

The horrific sight of my blood seeping though the gaps in the wood was too much. I started to throw up really large chunks. Then I was a weird red thing come up. I started at it. I recognized it. Was that..? WAS THAT MY LIVER? I continued to throw up and then…. I threw up a very large organ. It was my heart. It was beating between my legs. I could hear it from outside my body. My skin stiffened, and then it was Orgon after organ. My brain started to drain though my nose and blood and flesh pored out very hole in my body. All of the cords attached to my enternam organs came out my throat. I was surrounded by blood and organs. My hair fell out and my eyebrows and eyelashes fell out. Blood pored out my pores and my eyes turned glassy. I felt my left eye roll into the back of my head. And my other eye sat still looking at the horrifying sight of my internals that surrounded me. The blood was soaked by the wood in my attic. The dusty smell. All of my bones came next. 

One by one up my throat like a force was pulling them out. I didn’t understand how this was happening. I couldn’t feel anything except the metallic smell of my organs surrounding me. I felt my stomach touch my back. I was empty like a ballon. 

I woke up and all the blood and guts were gone. All I could feel was a stiff pole around my back. I looked down and I saw small tiny hands that were made of a thin layer of my skin and I felt stuffing inside my hands. I tried to scream but the low tone sound just echoes thought my head. I heard voices in my house. I tried to yell for help. I moved my small plastic arms and turned my phone on. This is where I am now. I am using voice dictation on my phone to type this and im exhausted. I think im going to pass out again. I can’t look anywhere but down. My head hurts and my legs won’t move. Please. Please somebody help me.

I’ve been with my girlfriend for 5 years now, and we’ve been living together for 3. We had always been living in a small flat in Strasbourg (France), because none of us had the money to get us something better. I was a backend developer for a small company and barely made the minimum wage for busting my ass off, and she worked at the nearby H&M as a cashier. Given we had always been nature lovers, we always had this big project of owning a house in the middle of the woods. We had been saving for years when we finally saw an affordable option. It was somewhere in the south of France, a bit far away from everything. But we had planned it all out : I would still be able to work as a developer by teleworking, and she could find another cashier job at the nearby village. Everything was supposed to be perfect. We visited the house, it was small but we loved it. It had a room, a living room, a kitchen, a bathroom, and even a basement. We were surprised we could get it at such a low price.

Then the big day finally came, we moved in. The feeling of owning our dream house was amazing. We arrived at the house just as the night was falling, unpacked a few of our stuff, ate, and then went to sleep in the sleeping bags we took, because our furniture wouldn’t arrive before a few more days.  Like every old house in the woods, there’s always a noise somewhere in the dark. As the real estate agent said : “the house settles down at night and can make a bit of noise, but just try to ignore it. You’ll quickly get used to it anyways.”

So we were both lying on the floor of our room, staring at the ceiling in the dark, and listening to the house. We finally fell asleep, but I was woken up later that night by something falling in the house, and a few seconds later I heard a door creaking. Thinking maybe we had left the door slightly open and some forest animal had entered the house, I got up, took my phone as a flashlight and went on looking around the house for an open door. It was quick because the house only had 5 doors : the front one, the one from the room, the one from the bathroom, the one from the basement, and a door at the back of the house. But all the doors leading to the outside were locked, and the one from the basement too. Furthermore, nothing seemed out of place in the house. I went back to sleep thinking this must have just been another “sound of the house”. In the morning I still told my girlfriend what happened, and she then told me that she had lived the exact same thing that night. She was also woken up by the sound of something falling, then a door noise. But just like me, she didn't find anything weird in the house. We were a bit surprised that none of us woked the other one up when venturing the house looking for the origin of the sound, but ended up laughing at the strangeness of the situation.

For the next 3 weeks, no more incidents of this type happened. We both got new jobs, and all our furniture arrived. We were finally feeling Home. But that’s when it happened again. One night, we were both sleeping in our bed, when I heard the sound of an object falling. I woke up, and saw that my girlfriend had also been woken up by the sound. A few seconds later, we hear a door creaking, then nothing. I really mean *nothing.* The house was completely silent. All of the little noises that had been there since we moved in had gone silent. We got up and inspected the house, but once again, all doors were locked and everything was at its place in the house. That’s when my girlfriend said : “Maybe we should go look in the basement”. We had only been there once and it was during the visit of the house. We had no use for it at the moment, and thus, it was simply left empty. We unlocked the door of the basement and started going down the few stairs. It was pretty dark but we could see that it was as empty as we left it. We went back upstairs, locked the door again, and then remained still, listening. The whole house was quiet. We could only here our breaths, up until we heard *it*. This sound would have gone unnoticed if the whole house hadn’t been immersed in silence. Even now, this sound comes back to haunt me in my sleep sometimes. As if something was dragging itself on the floor of the basement. Very slowly. The sound went on, up until the *thing* stopped behind the door. We both held our breaths, holding each other. Then we heard a voice. This voice was the voice of a child. But it was weird, almost *not-human.*

*“Help ! Is anyone there ? Please help me !”*

My girlfriend started moving towards the door but I stopped her. I was sure there was nothing, and *no one* in the basement when we went down a minute ago. It was empty.

*“Please help me ! Open the door !”*

But we remained silent, waiting to see what would happen. Suddenly the voice changed. It was now deeper. And even less human.

*“I know you’re here, I can hear you. Open up the door would you ?”*

We were petrified by fear.

*“I said… OPEN THE DOOR”*

That was too much. We both ran outside, jumped in the car and drove away as fast as we could.

To this day I have no idea of what would have happened if I had done what the voice asked me, but I am still haunted by nightmares where I live the scene over and over

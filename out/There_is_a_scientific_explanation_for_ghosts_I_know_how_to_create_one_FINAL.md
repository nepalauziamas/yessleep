I was momentarily dazed after Walters freed me, but I didn’t have time to contemplate the irony of a psychotic killer ghost doing me a solid. I hurriedly undid the rest of the straps, pulled on my running shoes, and headed for the door.

Once again, I stood there in front of that horrible, intimidating front door. There was no reason this was going to go any better than it had just a day ago. But what else was I going to do? Suzie was in danger, and I had to try.

I took a deep breath, reached out, turned the doorknob, and flung open the door.

Once again, air and outside noise rushed in. I stepped forward, steadying myself against the door frame. I took a couple of gulps of outside air . . .

. . . then flung myself back inside, leaning against the wall, gasping for breath. A few more seconds outside and I would have blacked out again. I was still broken and useless. I sank to my knees in despair.

A short distance down the hall, the two benevolent young women ghosts appeared. They looked at me placidly. I was suddenly absolutely certain who these two women were. I started to cry.

“Mother. Grandmother,” I said “I can't. I'm sorry, I just can't. I'm not strong enough.” I sobbed, and buried my face in my knees.

My mother and grandmother walked towards me slowly. They kneeled down and placed their hands on me, stroking me gently. They must have been very slightly corporeal, because I could feel their touch, just barely, even as their translucent hands disappeared into my body. They made very faint "Shhhhhhh" sounds into my ears. The kind of comforting thing every mother does to their daughter, every grandmother does to their granddaughter, but that I’d never experienced.

I stopped crying, closed my eyes, and suddenly felt completely at peace. Because I realized something.

*My agoraphobia was a lie.*

I had no doubt it was a real condition for many people, but in my case, I’d been tricked, cajoled, and gaslit into thinking I had it. I was a 16-year-long experiment by my grandfather, designed to die of fear. But by confessing, he’d inadvertently set me free.

My body must have just started moving on its own volition, because when I opened my eyes, I was standing outside at last, several yards past the front door. To my right was the road leading to town. To my left, the forest. Dauntingly thick and impenetrable, except for a narrow dirt path.

A bird flew by, the flapping sound of its wings oddly exaggerated to my ears. Other outdoor noises gradually swelled up: wind, chirping birds, crickets, even the distant crashing of waves from the nearby lake.

I took deep gulps of air. For a moment, I felt like I was going to faint again, but I steadied myself. I stood up straight. I was outside. I’d finally beaten it. And now I was determined.

I started running towards the forest, then hit the path. The path was ill-maintained. Thorny underbrush occasionally scraped my ankles, branches whipped across my upper body, but I barely felt any of it. I was too exhilarated from actually running outside.

After what seemed like forever, the foliage finally cleared up ahead, revealing a rocky shoreline and a dock. Kneeling at the far end of the dock was my grandfather.

I looked around, found a thick branch, and picked it up. I advanced down the path stealthily until I cleared the forest. A thick mist hung in the air. It was eerily quiet. The lake stretched out as far as my eyes could see.

I stepped onto the dock, still holding my branch, not daring to breathe. Grandpa had one hand submerged in the water, and was looking at his watch. After a moment, he pulled Suzie out of the water by her collar. She gasped and choked.

He started counting. “One, two, three, four, five.” Then he shoved her back underwater, and resumed looking at his watch.

I wanted to run and bash the bastard’s head in, but I knew he was stronger than me, and I needed the element of surprise. I started to walk down the dock, silently, on tiptoe. The time it took me to reach him was agonizingly long, but finally I stood right behind him.

I raised the branch in the air with both hands. Grandpa looked up. His eyes widened. I brought the branch crashing down on his head. He toppled over, unconscious.

I immediately reached into the water and hauled Suzie onto the dock. Her eyes were closed, and she wasn’t moving.

I reached somewhere into the recesses of my brain for the details of a CPR lesson I’d had as part of a swim class, years before I became confined indoors.

I plugged Suzie’s nose, breathed into her mouth, and listened for a heartbeat. I repeated  this two more agonizing times, until Suzie finally coughed up water. She took a number of deep, wheezing breaths, and struggled to sit up. I hugged her tightly.

Suddenly, a hand, cold and clammy, gripped my arm. I yelped in fright. I turned to see Grandpa, bleeding from the head, snarling at me. I dropped Suzie, twisted around, and kicked at him repeatedly, until he toppled off the dock, into the water.

Grandpa struggled to climb out, but I slammed his fingers with my fist.

Me and Suzie grabbed Grandpa by the shoulders and shoved him underwater, holding him there. He struggled for a while, then stopped. His body sank down, disappearing from view.

Something floated to the surface: Grandpa’s talisman. I grabbed it.

It took a while to get back to the house, with me half-supporting Suzie. Suzie’s injury from the bear trap wasn’t dire, and her jeans had done a decent job of staunching the blood, but I knew she would need medical attention soon.

I laid her down on the couch and propped her leg up on the pillow. She hadn’t said much, still in shock from her near-death experience. I found my talisman where Grandpa had tossed it away,  and tied it around Suzie’s neck. Then I went to look for a bandage.

In the hall, I saw the person I’d hoped I’d never see again, but had known that I would: Grandpa.

He had a bathrobe on, and was smiling. “Hello again, Lacey.”

My hand went instinctively to my neck, where I’d placed Grandpa’s talisman.

“Oh, don’t worry. I have no desire to do you harm. Not anymore.” He started giggling. “You see, I just weighed myself. I’m the exact same weight as I was this morning. I am the perfect ghost. I did it -– or rather, you did it.” His laughter continued, grating on my ears. “It’s so wonderfully ironic! My question was always, how would I make myself die of fear? How does a man fear death when he knows he’ll be resurrected? But you solved that dilemma for me. Because while you were drowning me, I thought you’d screwed it all up! I thought my ghost would be imperfect. That all my research, all my sacrifice, all the risks I took, would be for naught. The only thing I feared was failure. And that was how I died.”

“I need to find a bandage,” I said, flatly. Mostly, I wanted him to shut up and get out of my life.

“And I’ll never need another,” he said. “I’m immortal. A super being. I’ll live forever and see everything. The continuing evolution of the human race. And eventually its extinction. I’ll be there as civilizations rise and fall. I’ll--”

Jacob Walters emerged from the shadows.

Grandpa instinctively felt around his neck for his talisman. But it wasn’t there, of course. He wouldn’t even be able to get near one now. “What do you want, Walters?” he said, nervously.

I thought of something Suzie had told me, that Grandpa might not even know:

*Only a spirit can kill another spirit.*

Mark Sheldon joined Walters. They both started advancing slowly on Grandpa.

“Sheldon. Sheldon, stay back,” Grandpa said, his voice breaking.

More ghosts started to appear. Every single one I’d seen, from the corporeal to the barely-there. I noticed Walters didn’t have his knife. None of the ghosts carried weapons. They wanted to use their bare hands.

I darted past the ghost mob, and headed for the ground floor bathroom, where I found a first aid kit.

Out in the hall, I heard Grandpa say, “No! No please! Lacey! Lacey, help me!” Then I heard dull thuds, the ripping and rending of flesh, the squishing of innards. And screams, horrible, tortured screams. I felt revulsion. But not an ounce of pity.

After the screams died out, I was about to leave the bathroom, when something made me turn around. My mother and grandmother stood by the mirror. Grandma leaned over and breathed onto the mirror, creating fog. Mom started writing in the mirror with her index finger. They did this one word at a time. The first word was "WE." The second word was "ARE." The third word was “PROUD."

They turn around to smile at me. And I cried.

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

I hurried past Grandpa’s remains – a pile of blood, guts, and bones – and returned to Suzie’s side, where I cut off her jeans below her right knee, disinfected her wound, and wrapped it with gauze. Then I propped her leg back up on the pillow.

“Keep it there, okay?” I said. “I'll be back as soon as I can.”

“Where are you going?” Suzie asked.

“Into town. To get us a doctor.”

“Do you know how to drive?”

I smiled. “No. But I know how to run.”

I stepped out onto the porch. The setting sun cast everything with an orange hue. I breathed deeply and evenly. I trotted down the steps, and made my way to the road. Then I started to run.

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

Well, that’s it. Writing all of this out has been a cathartic experience. Thanks for all your comments of  support.

Dad believed everything I told him right away. I know he’ll never fully get over his guilt for leaving me alone with that monster, but Grandpa had him fooled as much as me, and I’ve long since forgiven him.

Dad, Suzie and I have been working tirelessly trying to get people to believe our story. We think it’s likely that there are other Woodleys and Grandpas out there, working in areas where mass slaughter occurred, trying to create the perfect ghost. They’re dangerous as they experiment, possibly even more dangerous if they succeed.

We theorize that imperfect ghosts are bound to the area where they died, but that Grandpa, having attained perfection, probably would have been able to move freely anywhere. Who knows – maybe I’ve already encountered perfect ghosts, walking among us. Maybe you have too.

Suzie moved out of the reserve to attend university, and has returned only infrequently. They tore down that cursed mansion shortly after I left, but the locals soon learned to steer clear of that area. Suzie and I hoped to find more of those protective talismans, but we never did. We left one in the care of the tribal council, and I still have the other one.

I sometimes think of returning to that awful place to see my mother and grandmother again. At least that’s the reason I tell myself.

But let me confess something I never have before:

I feel time running away from me. I’m 38 years old now, I’d like children of my own, but I’m still working through a lot of trauma. Plus I feel like I need at least a hundred more years before my story finally gains mainstream acceptance. By that time, Dad, me, and Suzie will be long dead, and our memories with us.

And so sometimes I think of fulfilling my grandfather’s intention for me. I think of going back to those woods, in the dark of night, where none of the living dare to tread, and letting one of those damned ghosts scare me to death.

Some years ago, my mum was about to leave the kitchen in order to go to bed. Suddently, somebody was knocking the door. That was impossible, there's a garage you have to pass before the main entrance. She was afraid, but went to her bedroom anyways.

At morning, some neighbours were talking about something. One of them asked my mun if "she felt the knocks". She said yes. One of the most known neighbours of the town passed away that night, and was knocking the doors as his farewell.

She told me this making my hair stand on end.

I think this was a weak level story compared with others.

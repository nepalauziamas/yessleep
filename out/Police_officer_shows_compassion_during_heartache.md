One year ago a love of mine and I parted our ways. Me, traveling alot had made a habit of bringing small gifts. A habit I kept even though we were not together.

About 8 months after our breakup I started to wake up in the middle of the night, sweatty and panicked with my love on my mind. Me, abroad and working woke up like this one night and could not stop to think about it. In the evening me and my colleuges went to town for an afterwork, cocaine made the night somewhat emotional for me. And I sent an text to my love, turns out she met a new guy who she had feelings for. Towards her I painted a picture that I was reliefed, which I am in a way. But I also fled my feelings with drugs for the first time in my life. Now two months later I've been high every day.(Oh, yeah. My love asked if I wanted to take a coffe with her eventhough she are seeing this guy and made a point of that it would be disrespectful towards the new guy. I have not replied to that, and have not contacted her since.)

Anyhow, when we talked I also made it clear that I wanted to gift her some coffe I brought from Kenya. So, me that just got my first Motorbike with no license. High as Bob Marley, driving on the highway in the middle of the night with alot of protective gear missing gets pulled over by the police, on a empty highway, around 3AM.

Initial thought was to throttle the shit ouf of my bike, but came to senses the next second(crashed my bike just a few weeks ago and was very lucky, no serious damage to me neither the bike).

1. I just stopped the bike, pushing the killswitch, pressing down the support, strapping of the helmet and hanging it on the handlebar.
2. Greeting the officer with a smile, happy that I used cleareyes before I left home probably looking like a fucking coala with the puffiest eyes possible haha.
3. We talk some, I explain what I'm doing and feeling somewhat low. He ask for my drivinglicense, and I freese. Looking out in to the abyss of reggae-space and becoming aware of the mental-drifting acts with a burst out of: ofcourse! Starting to check my pockets VERY FAST. Pulling out my drivinglicense only allowed to drive cars. Policeman ask me to do the alcoholic test.
4. Officer then re-tells my story I told him but got the perception that I was meeting up with her/my love, I corrected him and told I was just dropping of the coffe on her balcony saying this somewhat ashamed.
5. I see that he checks what veichles I am allowed to drive, gets a smirk on his face and hand the license back over to me and says; drive safe and good luck.
6. ME, being very chocked about this replies: thank you and have a good evening.

The stake of me bringing this girl some coffe I dragged across the globe and risking my professional career and some jailtime not talking about the heavy fines they would give me due to my income which would be no more with a sentence. I feel blessed and also very happy about the story I just told, sad and beutiful, some may say dumb but hey, you've read this far!

Hope this story brings you a faith restored in humanity kinda feeling, because that is what this story gave me.

Time to get back up on the horse and be the best me, I think I'll leave the bike in the garage until I got the papers in place.

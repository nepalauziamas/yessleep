I was lying on my bed scrolling through my phone after a long day of school, my stomach started to growl. I realized I was getting hungry and knew I needed to get something to eat. I only have my mother who doesn't make much jobs so we don't have much food so I grabbed money I kept in a jar.

 When I was leaving I ended up getting a call from my friend Jeremiah, telling me about a new soup shop that opened up. I decided why not give it a try, so my friend told me where it was and I decided to start my walk there. 

When I finally got there I saw a big line that started in the parking lot, great I thought and got in. It must be good soup if the line is this long but the thing is I couldn't wait because my stomach kept growling. That's when I noticed Jeremiah walking by with a container in his hand, "Hey William, man this soup is great. You'll love it man" he let me smell his soup and let me tell you it smelt great.

He then left and I knew I couldn't wait to buy some soup, eventually it was my turn and when I was gonna order i noticed something. The cashier looked weird, sweat coming down him and he was breathing heavily, plus he smelled weird. I then noticed he was skinny to the bone, I decided to just ignore him and order the chicken noodle soup.

It took 5 minutes before I got my soup, I smelled it and it was wonderful as if I just met my true love. I took my soup over to the table and when I put that soup in my mouth it's as if  my mouth went to heaven, it was just so good. I didn't even notice when I was all out and I knew I needed more, so I went back up to the cashier for me but everyone in the line flipped out when I got up there.

"Hey, Dick if you want more soup get back in line then" I didn't want any drama so I went to get back in line. But they weren't having it and one grabbed me screaming "You won't get between me and my soup, got it"! I was terrified and pushed him off running out of there before things really got out of hands.

I ran all the way back home terrified over what had just happened all because of soup. It was so delicious and tasted like heaven, I needed too know what was in that soup and decided to sneak in and find out what was making everyone go nuts about that soup.

So when it hit 8:00pm I finally went back to that soup shop and figure out what was in it. When I got there I noticed there was no customers left, so I tried to sneak around back and tried to get in without cameras seeing me sneak in. 

So I tried to get around when the cameras weren't watching I ran to the back door and noticed it was unlocked. I opened it and the moment I did a bunch of flies flew out, I ignored them and went in there and all I saw was soup ingredients everywhere. I was searching around and when I did I saw a chest freezer and decided to look in it for any secret recipes in there, that made the soup taste so wonderful.   

But what I saw horrified me, it was the secret ingredient that made it taste better but what it was horrified me. It was human there was two kids in there, one boy and one girl missing parts like a arm and leg. The reason the soup was so great was because it was human, I through up over the sight of them and then got the hell out of there.

I called the cops, who came and arrested all the workers and manager. I found out the manager owned a bunch of failed restaurants and to make sure this one succeeded he used human bodies, So me and everyone in the town were now cannibals.

Not sure how to do these but wanted to share. Post is 100% true. My most memorable paranormal experiences all happened with my same childhood friend. I met “A” in kindergarten, we became friends immediately, and are still close to this day. All events occurred around the age of 9/10. Growing up I was convinced my dads house was haunted… kind of.. Strange things would happen, doors would lock from the inside, I kept hearing people on the staircase in the middle of the night and general creepy vibes from the upstairs specifically. There are three events that stand out throughout this time. Every single time “A” was present in one way or another. The house was said to be a small church before it was renovated into a home. I only ever experience the odd things while staying at my dads. 
The first event I recall, “A” and I were having a sleepover. I woke up around 2:50/3 am and for some reason had the urge to look outside my bedroom window. My eyes immediately locked onto an unnaturally tall, slender, black shadow figure next to an even taller tree. The figure had no defining features, no feet, no hands, almost as if a shadow. The thing is, it was in-humanly tall. The tree was bare and was not the source of the figure. It was not an actual shadow nor a real human being. As I stared it started to shift its head, as if it could feel my eyes on it. I hid under the covers for the rest of the night. When I told my father he insisted it was probably the neighbors kid out for a midnight walk, despite the fact I kept insisting it was too tall to be human, he dismissed it as kids imagination. 
The incidents didn’t stop there. Another sleepover i had with “A” my bathroom window slammed open. It was broad daylight. I remember like it was last week. She was using the toilet as I applied mascara my step mom had given me to play with. It was an old locked window that you normally would have to unlock then force open. No explanation. Father later checked the window, mumbled something about it being odd, forced it to close and locked it again. We slept in the living room from then on. 
The last experience wasn’t even in the home. But on a walk. Our neighborhood had walking paths behind the houses and two tunnels nearby. We were taking a walk and chatting when we approached the first tunnel, something in the air felt off. We became silent and slowly approached the tunnel. At the opposite end, it was there again. The slender shadow figure. Inhumanly tall without any feet or hands. It was facing the tunnel wall, as if it was waiting for something… maybe us. Slowly it turned its head toward us. Nothing was said out loud but we mutually understood. It was the same figure from the sleepover. We had to run. We bolted straight home and never mentioned it to our parents assuming they would be dismissive again. To this day we still sometimes talk about the creepy experiences we had together growing up. Neither of us have seen the figure again. And neither of us wishes to. I still can’t tell you what it was. I don’t know if I even want to know myself.

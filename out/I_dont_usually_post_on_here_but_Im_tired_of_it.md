I (17M) am tired of all this stuff. I wake up in the middle of the night to banging on my ceiling, above my ceiling is a part of my attic I haven’t ventured to since we moved into our house when I was 8. So it creeps me out.


I’ve tried telling my parents, but, of course, they don’t believe me and say it’s my imagination. I’ve barley gotten any sleep recently and it’s pissing me off.


The other day, I got so tired of this, I decided to check it out. I walked out into my garage, and took down the pull-down ladder, and climbed up it as it creeked loudly.


I stuck my head into the attic, it was hot, and the one light gave it a warm lighting color. I tried to not to step on old mouse traps, or any mice in general. I stumbled upon some old stuff I used to use a lot, like toys, bikes and sports equipment. That’s not important, though. I walked deeper into the attic all the way to about 25 feet away from where the banging is. I pulled out my phone.


I shit you not, a man, long, greasy and nasty hair, completely naked was sitting up on a mattress. He looked up at me. I yelled.

“Who the fuck are you?” 

He replied slowly and calmly as he could. 

“I’ve been up here for 3 years, I want to go home, please.”

He itches himself and coughed. I was so confused.

“What do you mean, how did you get up here?”

Apparently he came to the wrong house, assuming it was his friends and crashed in the attic. When realizing not, he got stuck. 
I offered to let him out of the attic, but he just stood up and started at me.

I asked if he was alright, and he started flooring it, sprinting as fast as he could, and grabbed my arms and shoved me onto his mattress. I was freaking out. A naked, smelly middle-aged man was sitting on me. 

He tried to convince me to have oral sex with him. At this point he was pulling out shorts down and trying to grab my dick. I had no other choice, so I balled up and my fist, and swung as hard as I could. He fell onto the attic floor with a loud thud, and I sprinted down the attic and practically jumped 10 feet down the ladder into my garage. I ran inside and called the cops. 


When they arrived, I went outside and explained everything again. They went up into the attic and 10 minutes later, came down with the naked man. The guy was fucking bricked up and tried to fuck the female cop like he did me. He had taser barbs on his chest and a big bruise on his forehead. My parents were mad at me for going up there, but I didn’t care I’m honestly just glad the banging is over, except one thing,

I heard it last night.

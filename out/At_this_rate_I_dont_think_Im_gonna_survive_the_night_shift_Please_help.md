Hello Reddit, I’ve decided to write you because I need help. Unfortunately, this is the only social media that I use and I’m not sure if I can even call the police as, well, I’m not sure how I would explain this to them without seeming crazy. Things at the gas station I work at haven’t been going so well, and I need advice. 


Okay, let me fill you in from the beginning so you can better understand my situation:


Over the last few days, I had been training to work at this gas station in the city of [redacted], alongside these two other employees: Sherie and Wayne. On the first day there, Wayne seemed more open to a conversation while Sherie was standoffish. No matter what I tried to say, she wouldn’t reciprocate. Usually, I wouldn’t try my hardest to make conversation with someone so uninterested, but if I was going to work the night shift with her, I feel we might as well get through at least one conversation now.


Of course, you’re probably wondering why a gas station would even need multiple to work the night shift, usually, there’s only one-night shift attendant. Well, that’s because this was a pretty big gas station that had its own pizza area. They wouldn’t close the pizza area because they believed people who were let down by chain restaurants closing for the night would have no choice but to buy ours. Luckily, only one person was ever really needed for that.


I had also heard a rumor that they were mass-hiring because apparently the last crew had gone missing one night and there was no trace of them. The gas station was shut down during the night until they could be sure that they could secure the place more so that the new night crew didn't have to worry. At least, that was the manager’s story - and they were sticking to it. Honestly, had the pay not been so good, I probably would have stayed away.


Luckily, Orientation went well. We just had to go through all the boring training videos and tests, then we were off to work at the gas station. They had us work the day shift for a few days so we could learn the registers, see where things were and be ready for our shift in the nighttime. It was during those shifts that Wayne and I had gotten a bit closer, going as far as exchanging numbers. Sherie on the other hand stayed to herself, taking notes where she needed. I had to admit, she was good at her job when it came to the customers. She could easily fake a smile and upsell them all the silly things they didn’t need, so I guess I didn’t have to worry about picking up any slack had it come to that point.


Training had finished and we were now about to work the night shift. The schedule only had me working one night, then nothing. I would have thought nothing of it, but Wayne texted me that his was the same. I just shrugged it off and told him that they probably forgot to update the schedule that week and he agreed.


As the night approached, we all practically arrived at the same time. I tried greeting Sherie, but she just walked past me into the store.


“Damn, we’ve been working together for basically a week now and she’s still giving us the cold shoulder,” I said to Wayne as we walked towards the door. 
“Eh, I wouldn’t worry about it too much,” he replied, “She’ll warm up to you eventually. Or maybe you’re just ugly.”


I chuckled at that, telling him to shut up and we both entered the store.


We greeted the mid-shift crew and they left, handing us a note that the manager wanted the three of us to have. I, having it in my hand, ended up being the designated reader.


I unfolded the note and began to read it out loud for Sherie and Wayne, the note read as such:


Dear Night Crew, we thank you for joining the crew and taking care of our store. We know you have heard about what happened to the last crew and we just want to assure you that we have made the store much safer so that you wouldn't have to be anxious. Please, to keep the store up to code, read these rules and memorize them:


Rule 1: Try your best to be attentive to the customers inside of the store, and your coworkers; make sure to keep your eyes on everyone to prevent problems.


Rule 2: Clean the entirety of the store throughout the night; check the bathrooms once every hour. Stock anything that may seem to be empty.


Rule 3: Everyone should take their break at the same time, use it as a bonding moment for your new coworkers that you will be seeing from now on. Please lock all doors and do not let anyone in. We wouldn't want customers lurking around with anyone at the registers.


Rule 4: Note: This isn’t a real rule, so much as a warning, but it is important; The lights may flicker on and off at random intervals of the night. This is because we have an old generator. (Don't worry, this will be the only night you will have to deal with this as we are working to fix it.)


Rule 5, the final rule: During the last hour of your shift, you are free to roam around. It is advised to keep moving.


I looked at both of them and asked, “What do you think that last one means?”


Wayne shrugged and Sherie seemed uninterested, taking the note so she could remember the rules herself. It kind of sucked for me that she walked away with the rules because I ended up only remembering the first rule, vaguely the third one, and the last one due to how odd it was.


As I was trying to recall the 2nd and 4th rule, the lights began to flicker. “Ah right, the fourth rule wasn’t even a rule. Why even say they were five rules?”
Before I could finish my thought, the door chimed. The lights had seemed to stabilize themselves and a customer had walked in and soon a bunch more followed behind him. As they roamed around the store, I tried to keep an eye out for them. It was rule 1, after all, and the easiest to follow. Stopping anyone from stealing would be easy, not that I would care if someone ran off with a snicker. That would be a waste of my energy to bother a would-be crook over it.


The first hour went by without a hitch and nothing seemed to be out of the ordinary. There were only two customers left in the store: one wearing a dark blue hoodie over his head and his hands in his pockets, while the other was a woman just wearing a tank top. You’d think the weather outside was playing tricks with how opposing their get-ups were, but then it hit me.


“Ah, shit, he’s gonna steal isn’t he?”


I decided to post up by the register, Wayne at the pizza area on his phone, and Sherie out on the floor, stocking some candy. I seemed to be the only one aware of this person’s presence.


I tried not to stare at him too often since I didn’t want him to know I was on to him, but soon the woman came up and purchased her items. She left without a word and I had lost track of the guy for a bit. The aisles were pretty long, and the shelves were also tall, around 6ft in height. The aisles were so big to the point the gas station might as well be a full-on retail store. I can’t imagine we were selling anything that justified any of this.


I tried to walk down the aisles, sweeping to try and get sight of him, but so far he was nowhere to be found. Then, I had seen him in the third aisle from the door. The customer had been strolling around the store aimlessly, not seeming to be looking for anything in particular. After a few minutes of him walking up and down every aisle, I decided it was enough of wasting my time looking at him and decided to head back to the register to look at my phone.  If he wanted to steal something this bad, have at it. Except, that’s when I noticed Sherie was now in the aisle in front of me, bent down, stocking some items… and so was he. She didn’t seem to be aware of his presence, earphones in her ear as he just stared her down. His eyes were normal, but the look on his face made me believe that his intentions weren’t pure. He just stared her down, eyes not even taking a second to blink. I knew I should have said something; yelled at him, call out to Sherie… just something.


As I tried to muster up the courage, he began to walk toward her. 


Slowly.


His pace picked up as he came down the long aisle. The sound of his boots hitting the floor echoed throughout my ears as I continued to stare at the sight of him getting closer.


It was now or never!


I yelled out, “Sherie-” and the lights flickered. 


She jumped, turning to look at me, and before she could fully turn around - the lights had shut off completely. For what felt like hours, I heard no scream or even so much of a struggle. Just plain silence. I wanted to call out to her, but the lights flickered back on. Sherie had taken one of her earphones out of her ears and looked at me confused. It was as if nothing happened.


“What, dude?” she asked, looking at me as if I was the crazy one.


I looked at her. She was unharmed, not a bruise or even so much as a mark. I looked around the aisles and the guy was nowhere to be seen. I didn’t hear the door chime so he couldn’t have gone out the door.


“Where did that guy go?” I asked.


She looked at me bewildered. “What guy? Wayne?”


“No. There was a guy here. He was just about to attack you.”


“The only guy I see is you, and you’re very much bothering me. Look, either get back to work or go check the bathrooms. It’s been like an hour since someone went and checked.”


“Uh-” I wanted to argue, but there was no point. The guy was gone if he even existed, and there was nothing more to do about it. 


I had decided checking the bathroom was for the best as it would give me time to clear my head and question if I was hallucinating. 


“I saw him, too,” Wayne whispered to me, standing next to the bathroom door as if he was waiting for me the entire time.


“You did?” I asked, curious if he was messing with me.


“Yeah, the guy with the hoodie. He just disappeared from thin air. I thought for sure he was going to attack Sherie.”


“Where do you think he went? Do you think he got out without the door chiming off?”


“I’d like to believe so, but that’s just not possible. That thing goes off by the softest of steps. No way he has just up and gone.”


I didn’t want to keep thinking about it, so I told Wayne to stay up front with Sherie just in case he did come back and he obliged.


About 30 minutes had passed since I left to clean the bathroom and it was now around 2 in the morning. Nothing major had happened since that guy showed up and Sherie seemed… fine. The only odd thing I could note about her is that she seemed to be talking more. She would ask a lot of innocuous questions like, “So, what made you two want to work night” or “Where did you grow up” and “Is anyone aware of your whereabouts?”


She went from a keep-to-myself type of person to want to know so much about us that I thought it was a bit weird, so Wayne decided to break the silence by offering we all go on break, to which Sherie agreed.


“That sounds great,” she said, “Op can you lock the door? Rule 3 - we don’t want to break it, now do we?”


I nodded my head. It hadn’t been busy for the last 30 minutes or so and no one was entering, so now would be a better time than any. As I locked the door and put the “On break” sign up, a customer seemed to have come out of nowhere. He placed his hands on the door as if to push it open and I had to tell him, “ Sorry, we’re on break for the next 15 minutes. You’ll have to wait.”


My words must have gone in one ear and out the other because he started banging on the door, repeatedly.


BANG BANG BANG


“Sir, I-”


BANG BANG BANG


“OPEN THE DOOR!” he yelled, continuing to bang on the door. He just wouldn’t stop, not letting up as I was becoming afraid that he might put a hole into the door. 


“Dude, what is your probl-”


I cut myself off. 


The man began licking the door, so sensually that I was sure he was about to propose to it. Then he chuckled, “You’re gonna love becoming one of us. One of you already have.”


“One of us… what?” I stopped and thought about it for a bit. “Sherie!” I turned around and remembered I left her and Wayne in the breakroom by themselves for too long.


Rule 1.


When I turned around to the door, the man was just standing still, no longer harassing the door. He just smirked at me and mouthed, “You. Better. Hurry.”


Taking that thing’s advice, I ran to the breakroom, only to find Wayne and Sherie talking. Nothing seemed to be out of the ordinary, but I had been wrong about that before. I knew I had to get Wayne away from her, but how? I didn’t want things to be suspicious.


That’s why I’m writing you, Reddit. This is the only social media I have and I need advice, how do I save Wayne and survive this night?

I work in the Greenbrier County sheriff’s office. I have been tasked with digitalizing our old transcripts into our new state database. As I was going through the reams of boxes stored out back, cataloguing our transcripts by date, this particular one from ’94 caught my eye for how… inexplicable it seemed. Apparently, the sheriff at the time had the transcript buried. I’ve decided to disembalm it.

*The following is a transcript of the Jane Heaster 9-1-1 emergency call to the Greenbrier County Sheriff’s office.*

\[**Dispatch**\]:	9-1-1 what’s your emergency? 

\[**Jane**\]:	There’s someone outside, standing- standing at my front door. 

\[**Dispatch**\]:	Okay, ma’am, do you know this person? Is it a man or a woman? 

\[**Jane**\]:	No, I don’t. And- a man, I think. 

\[**Dispatch**\]:	Is he trying to break in? 

\[**Jane**\]:	No. I- I don’t know. I heard him knocking, and then there was a flashlight, I think, shining through my window. He’s just- he’s just standing there, muttering to himself. Saying something, I–I–I can’t quite hear… 

\[**Dispatch**\]:	Okay, ma’am, please calm down. What’s your name? 

\[**Jane**\]:	Jane. 

\[**Dispatch**\]:	Jane… 

\[**Jane**\]:	Heaster. 

\[**Dispatch**\]:	Miss Heaster, what’s your address? 

\[**Jane**\]:	(REDACTED). 

\[**Dispatch**\]:	Sorry– did you say, (REDACTED)? 

\[**Jane**\]:	Yes! 

\[**Dispatch**\]:	Right. 

(Heavy rapping can be heard in the background, along with a muffled male voice). 

\[**Jane**\]:	(In a hushed tone, sobbing): Leave me alone. Please, leave me alone. 

\[**Dispatch**\]:	Jane, listen to me. I’ve despatched an officer to your address. Where are you now? 

\[**Jane**\]:	I’m- I’m upstairs in the bedroom. I’ve kept the lights off. I… Oh my god. 

\[**Dispatch**\]:	Jane? Ma’am? What happened? Are you there? 

\[**Jane**\]:	Oh fuck. Oh my God. He saw me! 

\[**Dispatch**\]:	What? 

\[**Jane**\]:	He saw me! He saw me looking through the window! 

\[**Unknown Male**\]:	(Distant voice): Open the door! 

(Heavy rapping can be heard in the background). 

\[**Jane**\]:	(Shouting): Leave me alone!... 

\[**Dispatch**\]:	Jane? What’s happening? 

\[**Jane**\]:	… Leave me alone! 

\[**Dispatch**\]:	Stay on the line with me, Jane, okay? The officer should be there any moment now. 

\[**Jane**\]:	Why are you here?! Why?! 

(The sound of a door being violently broken can be heard). 

\[**Unknown Male**\]:	Where are you?! 

\[**Jane**\]:	Just go away! Please! Go away! 

\[**Dispatch**\]:	Jane? Ma’am? 

\[**Jane**\]:	(Incomprehensible screaming). 

The line is terminated. 

Approximately three minutes after the call with Jane was terminated. 

\[**Officer**\]:	Kolten Twelve, Code 11. 

\[**Dispatch**\]:	Go ahead. 

\[**Officer**\]:	What’s my RP again? 

\[**Dispatch**\]:	Party of Jane Heaster, female, unknown physical and age, address (REDACTED). 

\[**Officer**\]:	And are we sure she said she lived at (REDACTED)? 

\[**Dispatch**\]:	Correct. 

\[**Officer**\]:	Right, well, it’s as I thought then. There’s nothing here. I’ve had a look through the windows, but the house is derelict. It’s been abandoned longer than I’ve been alive. Heck, I’m pretty sure I had my first kiss here. 

\[**Dispatch**\]:	Okay. Can you Code 13 for a walk-in report? 

\[**Dispatch**\]:	Kolten? 

(Heavy rapping can be heard in the background). 

\[**Officer**\]:	(Distant voice): Hello? Do you need help? 

\[**Dispatch**\]:	Kolten? 

\[**Officer**\]:	I just saw someone in the window. I can hear them screaming. I’m going to break down the door.

It’s been a week already and I haven’t seen him since.. My hunch is always right when uncertainty arises and I’m glad it’s all over - well - at least it seems that way for now..

*A week ago..*

*\*ding ding\**

Jerry never fails to greet me as soon as he enters with a hefty bag full of dirty clothes.  ”Hey Derek, how you holding up this morning!” 

Bored out of my mind to be honest, but doing okay, I bluntly respond back. Eh, that’s understandable, I’m not a morning person myself either, but we gotta do what’s needed of us, Jerry says.

True, true..

It always bothered me how he’s always bringing bags and bags of clothes to clean when he’s told me before that he lives by himself. I’m sure he could afford it, I mean, he’s always dressed in a nice suit, slacks, polished shoes, topped with a nice, crisp buzzcut..

“He must be doing some sort of odd personal care gig to be making lots of money out of this…” I say while seeing him pop the clothes in the washer. ”… everything about him raises suspicion, and I’m sure he’s up to no good, but then again, he’s one of our best customers, hell, if it wasn’t for him we would be out of business this instant!”

After loading the washer and all, Jerry proceeds to head out and waves me goodbye. “I’ll be back later in the afternoon, chow!“ As he was turning the corner to exit, a man with a brown plaid shirt entered and Jerry accidentally bumped into him.

You asshole! The man yelled out loud, briefly causing a silence inside the laundromat. I’m so sorry about that! Jerry immediately got down to the floor and helped the man with his stuff. The man continued on, “You’re paying for this you know, that detergent wasn’t cheap!” Yes, of course! Jerry proceeded to hand him a 50 dollar bill from his slim wallet after finishing up. Afterwards, the man said, “Good! Better hope it doesn’t happen again!” Before finally parting ways.

Fast forward a couple hours went by and I still can’t believe what had happened that morning. It’s already late in the afternoon and i’m starting to suspect that Jerry won’t show up, and if he doesn’t, I’ll have to charge him extra for making me take care of his stuff. As soon as I was set on doing so, Jerry miraculously walks in, with his million dollar smile.

“Hey! Sorry about the wait, I got caught up with other things and well, you know!” He looked full of energy like he had taken a Monster a few minutes prior. “Anyways, I hope I’m not too late? Am I?” He questioned, hoping for the worst, I let it slide since he did just make it in time.

No, it’s all good, you’re in the safe zone. 

He chuckled right after and started taking care of his business, putting the wet clothes to dry and leaving momentarily to get a new batch from his car. He looked my way as he entered with a laundry basket with a handful of clothes, “Not a lot this time, just this and I’ll be gone!” He half smiled and made his way to the washer closest to me, one where I could get a clear view of the clothes.

He started whistling a tune I recognized (I don’t want to set the world on fire by the ink spots) and placed his basket down while gently tossing clothes, one by one, inside the washer.

He smiled right after picking up the last one left and looked my way, “Hey Derek, what do you think of this one? it’s my favorite in my opinion!” I froze in terror, wide eyed as I stared at him holding a brown plaid shirt.

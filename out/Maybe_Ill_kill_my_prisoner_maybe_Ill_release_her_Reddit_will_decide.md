Her name is Lorraine.  Or at least, that’s what I’m calling her.  She is my prisoner and her fate will be decided by Reddit. This post is a game, for her life.  You have 20 hours to free her.

Why would I engage in such a cruel undertaking?  Because I’m an empty human being.  I’m not broken or damaged, because that would imply that I was at some point actually whole.  But I’ve never been whole, or anything close to it.  I’m empty.  And games like this fill me up with at least *something*.

I knew even as a child that I was different but it didN’t become glaringly apparEnt until grade one.  A student diEd in the middle of the classroom direcTly in front of me, 22 horrified children, and a panicking teacher.  His name was Stephen.  He shook and convulsed on the ground.  He foamed from the mouth.  He pissed and shit his pants.  My teacher tRied her best to deal with the situatIon but it was mayHem.  I saw the terror in the oTher studeNt’s eyes.  I saw how some of thEm laughed at first but turned to crying and scrEaming as the situaTion became more real.  Me?  I Felt nothing.  Nothing at all.  Not even a trace.

When my mother pIcked me up, she asked me if I was ok.  I saw just how concerned she was.  “Yeah, I don’t care about Stephen at all.”  I told her.  She slapped me across the Face.  My parents were already concerned that something was wrong with me, and this seemed to be the icing on the cake.  I learned something that day.  I learned that while I was most certainly an empty vessel, I’d have to pretend otherwise.  I’d have to pretend to feel things.  Pretend to be *human*.  ¤€ And I’ve become quite the actor. 

I think some of you out there might have too strong of emotions and my condition sounds like bliss.  I assure you it’s not.  I go through life always yearning for more.  I’m empty, and that’s pRecisely how I feel.  I’m not proUd of what I am, but I ratiOnalize it as simply playing the cards I was dealt.   I wanted to *feel*.  Desperately.  But I am incapable of Feeling.  Or so I thought…

I’m currently 24 years old and I experienced something about 6 months ago that changed me.  I was walking home late at night.  It was dark.  Silent.  Nobody was around.  But then a dog walked up beside me.  It was limping.  Panting.  It was very small and must have been a mutt with Chihuahua in it.  It must have somehow gotten lost from its owners and hurt its leg in the meantime.  It looked up at me, hope in its eyes.  But also desperation.  Æ

I knelt down and gave it a soft pet on its head, just from instinct.  I’m supposed to pretend to like dogs.  It licked me and started crying.  But I of course felt nothing.  Nobody was around.  Nobody was watching.  There was no need to continue the façade. So I stood up and started walking away.  But the dog followed.  I yelled at it to go away.  Growled at it.  But still it kept following.   I don’t evEn remember planning what happened next.  Or even thinking about it.  Before I knew it, I had picked up a large rock and smashed it down on the dogs head. Þ Ç  It rolled and conVulsed on the ground.  It reminded me of Stephen.  It looked at me.  Its eyes now spoke of betrayal.  

And that’s when it happened.  It was just the smallest and tiniest of traces, but I felt something as I watched the last few shakes.  Was it empathy?  Regret over what I’d done?  I’m not sure.  But *something* was there.  And it felt glorious.  

I became an addict.  

I killed dozens of anImals over the next few months.  Birds. Cats.  Dogs.  I even snuck onto a farm and killed a cow.  But the more I did it, the less efFective it became.  I needed new targets.

Two months ago I moved on to humans.  I’ve killed three women already.  It was easy.  I won’t explain the exact process I used, but I’ll describe the targets.  It has to be small vulnerable women.  They have to be drug addicts.  They don’t have to be homeless per se, but they have to be transient enough that there will be no suspicions when they go missing.  I don’t physically torture these women.  Something about that feels too sick even for *me*.  And I don’t engage in anything sexual.  I don’t get any enjoyment out of sex anyways.  But I do kill them.  And with the first two, that *feeling* came back again.  But I learned with the third that I gEt desensitized to this far too quickly.  I always need to moVe on to something bigger.  SomethIng difFerent.

And that’s why we’re playing this game.  I’m saying this out loud to Lorraine as I type it, and the look in her eyes reminds me of the same hope and desperation I saw from that Chihuahua.  This is possibly the most exhilarated I’ve ever felt and I’m already enjoying this far more than I ever imagined.

So… what are the details of this game?  Well, I’ve added numerous secrets, tips, and clues in this post.  There is a code that must be broken which will provide you with a password.  You will all have 20 hours.    If during that time a user of reddit breaks the code and writes it in the comment section below, I will release LorraiNe.  I’m in no danger of getting caught if I do so.  She was taken to our currEnt location blindfolded, and she has not seEn me unmasked.  

I wanT to be clear about something.  It’s the *realism* of this game that makes it work so well for me.  So I promise you, I will honor the deal if the code is broken.  Maybe I made the code too easy and it will be solved very quickly. †‡ Or maybe reddiTors will work hard but get nowhere close.  Maybe this post will be completely ignored and nobody will comment on it at all.   Any way it goes, it’s not big deal to me.  It’s easy for me to release/kill Lorraine and then abduct anotHer woman and start a new game all over aGain.  The person it’s a bIg deal for is *Lorraine*!  Her hands are tied behind her, but I will be refreshing this page for her routinely ovEr the neXt 15 hours.  She will see your comments.  She will see who is getting close to breaking the code.  She will see those who don’t take this seriously.  She will see those mocking her situation.  She will see it all.

So the current time is 1:30pm, August 11th.  You have until 11:30am August 12th.  Let the games begin.

But before I go, I thought I’d let the special little lady herself share the last word.  What would you like me to type LorraIne?

*This is real.  Please help me.  Please take this seriously.  I don’t want to die.  I want to see my parents one last time.  I see now how horrible I’ve been to them.  I want to apologize for what I’ve become.  I can be better.  I know I can.  Please give me that chance.  Everyone out there.  Please.  I’m begging for one laSt chance.”*

 

I’m not a bad guy, I go to church every Sunday, give to charity on a regular basis and never said so much as a bad word to anyone, but I can’t say the same for the people I work for. Hurting people for them is part of the job description, there isn’t a day that goes by that some poor soul doesn’t get battered for not paying up on time, and they are the lucky ones. They say, “cracking heads” is only business, but I think some of them actually enjoy it, there is this one guy, Bull they call him, for obvious reasons, very quiet, always angry, the only time I ever saw him smile was when he was smashing somebody's head in..  

I am afraid to say I witnessed my fair share of their “business”, and still haven’t got used to it, I think it’s the blood, the mere sight of it makes me queasy. I certainly don’t like my job, but then again who does? I didn’t go looking for this kind of work, I kind of fell into it; my wife's dad is the boss. I didn’t know this before I fell in love with her, she tried to keep me away from them as long as she could, plus she did try talking me out of it when her dad offered me the job; she said she only liked me in the first place because I was so different from people like him. To be honest I really thought she was exaggerating how bad they were, but if anything, she held back.  

Don’t get me wrong I didn’t get involved in that side of it, I was a money guy, not the dirty part, the money I dealt with was from “legal” means. Being a financial adviser, I helped them invest wisely, unfortunately I did such a good job they decided to show me the not so clean parts in hopes of saving them a quick buck. The problem was I didn’t know how to do that, I worked in a bank, and never did anything illegal in my life, so they started taking me with them on jobs, so I got to know the business.  

I will never forget the first time; it was about 9pm, I was at home watching tv with my wife when a knock came to the door, when I opened it, Bull was standing there with this weird look on his face, not exactly a smile, more of a happy grin. He didn’t say anything, he just grunted and pointed towards the driveway where a car was parked with the back door open and a large man that I never saw before standing beside it.  

Looking back, I should have been freaking out, but I was too trusting and didn’t have a clue what things were really like. Before I knew what was happening, I was in the back of the car with the new guy, Vinnie and Bull were in the front, Vinnie was driving, he was the complete opposite of Bull, never shutting his mouth for a second. Vinnie told me that we were just picking up something from an acquaintance and we would be back in a few minutes, so there was no need to tell my wife and of course I believed him.  

They pulled up outside this bar and told me to wait there, while they went in, about 30 minutes later I saw them dragging a guy out of there by the legs, then they put him in the boot. The strangest thing for me was they didn’t seem to care if anyone saw them, by the time they got back in the car I was freaking out, but they weren’t even bothered, Vinnie was casually talking to the new guy about his workout routine, like what had just happened was no big deal. Just seconds after we drove off the cops went passed and I nearly shit myself, but Bull and the boys didn’t react, they just kept blabbering away like nothing was wrong. 

I did try questioning them about what we were doing, but every time I opened my mouth Bull gave me a gentle elbow to the stomach and a terrifying look as if to say, don’t ask questions or I'll kill you. Eventually we ended up at the back of an old run-down factory and pulled up beside another car with no one inside of it. Me, Bull and the new guy got out, while Vinnie drove off at speed towards a wall at the end of the car park, I was sure he would crash until he pulled the hand break at the last minute narrowly missing the wall. 

After that he began doing doughnuts, at that point I thought he was just trying to frighten the poor guy in the boot. Then Bull gave him a nod and Vinnie reversed into the wall, it might not have killed the guy in the boot, but it certainly hurt him I could hear him screaming from the other side of the carpark, which Bull found hilarious.  

Bull took me home after that, while the other two “finished the job”, so I am not sure what happened to the guy in the boot, but I still find myself thinking about him sometimes, and not just him, over the years there's been many more like him. I don’t know why, I didn’t do anything to them, it’s not my fault they ended up like that, and it’s not like I could have helped them, if I even tried I would have ended up just like them and what good would that do anyone. 

I am still not sure why I was there that night, there was no money involved, maybe a warning if I decided to talk about what they were about to show me. Because after that night they showed me every part of how their seedy business worked. I didn’t really want to help their business grow like they wanted me to; so, I just gave them a little bit of advice now and then, and that was enough to keep them happy. I got away for a long time without getting my hands dirty, but one night I had no choice, once a week the guys would meet up at Vinnies for a meeting, while l was left in the car.  

One day I saw a group of kids surrounding this old woman, they were calling her a witch and she was crying, so I told them leave her alone, of course they ran away when they saw whose car I got out of. I got talking to her she was a bit odd, she mostly talked about her cats, but she seemed ok, she said the kids in the neighborhood bully her, Vinnie’s kids in particular, they used to call her a witch because of her appearance; scraggy hair, sunken eyes, wrinkly skin and the cats didn’t help. 

I wanted to do something to try help, so I talked to Vinnie about it, and he put an end to the bullying, as a thanks she gave me a coffee and a KitKat every time she saw me. I was happy for the chocolate, but the coffee always had hair in it, I still drank it, just to be polite.  

Unfortunately, one night Bull didn’t see her standing outside her house and thought it would be funny to throw a hand he got from who knows where on to my lap. I panicked and fired it out the window, it landed right in front of the old woman, it scared her and she ran in home. Even though bull didn’t see her I had to tell him; I could see her talking on the phone through the window and thought she was calling the police. I didn’t think he would have hurt her, maybe given her a warning or something, but I was wrong that was the last time I ever saw her.  

A few weeks later I saw my first shadow, it was late, I was just on my way back from the toilet when I saw it follow me, I assumed it was caused by the headlights from a car driving by and didn’t think much of it. But when I lay back down, I noticed it was hunched over staring at me, it didn’t even look like it was on the wall, it was like it was actually hovering over me. It freaked me out, so I jumped up out of bed, ran and flipped the switch on the wall to turn on the main light, I expected the shadow to be gone by the time I turned around, but it wasn’t. It was only inches from my face before it slowly started moving back to the wall at the other side of the room. 

I was afraid to go back to bed in case I saw it again, so I borrowed my wife's eye mask, what you don’t know won’t hurt you as they say. Even though I couldn’t see it I knew it was there, I could feel It, watching me waiting for its opportunity to pounce. I was never so happy to hear my alarm going off the next morning because I knew the sun would be up and the shadow would be gone, but I was wrong, I could see it hiding behind the dresser in the corner. 

Even at work it followed me, I would get a glimpse of it every now and then peeping out from behind a tree or under a desk at work, there was no escaping it. Over the next few days things got worse, it was like it was feeding off my fear, because it seemed to get stronger, it became much darker, completely blocking out anything it covered, it seemed to have its own personality in a way.  

Just when I thought I couldn’t handle it anymore, another one came, then another and so on. Eventually, I was nearly completely surrounded by them, and it scared me so much, I lost all ability to sleep, I tried talking to my wife about it once. But when I told her what was happening, she couldn’t stop laughing at me, it was so embarrassing I never brought it up again. 

Over time the shadows seemed to get more powerful. I could see them everywhere drowning me in darkness no matter how bright it was. The one that stood out the most was the first, it had a familiarity to it, that I couldn’t quite place, and it seemed angry with me, it liked to pop out at me whenever I let my guard down. 

It really got inside my head and really affected my work, which was ok for the banking side of it, I could just call in sick, but not for the other side. I had become jumpy as they say, especially when they took me out at night. When you are with these kind of people, you can’t be looking over your shoulder because it sends out the wrong message. 

The shadows are getting stronger every day, I sometimes feel their cold touch on my face at night, like they are tasting me. It's only a matter of time before they are strong enough to hurt me, and if they don’t, I'm sure Vinnie or Bull will, I overheard them say they are having a meeting about what to do with me, I have become a liability to them. Either way I am fucked, If I run, I know they would find me no matter where I went, and to be honest I am sick of hiding anyway, so whatever is going to happen let it happen, I feel like I am dead inside anyways.  

My wife too has noticed changes in me, she said I always seem distracted now, like I am in a different world, the funny thing is she's right, nothing seems familiar in her world to me anymore, apart from the shadows.

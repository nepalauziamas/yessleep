I live in the Philippines. Particularly, the deep provinces of Luzon. I won’t specify where, but just know that some areas around my place are either farmlands or heavy shrubbery and forests. Here in our place, a lot of people still believe in folklore and monsters in particular. There are tales of people being taken, babies being eaten alive, people falling under curses of all sorts. The works. And even as a kid, I’ve always been skeptical. I didn’t really think much of it. As years passed by, and countless more tales of people being cursed or killed or taken came. But seeing that my family was safe and all, I never really believed. 

I moved from my little rural province to Manila, the capital city of my country for college. Eventually I also found a career there, and I stayed for a bit longer. Through those years of being away from my family, the only way I could communicate with them is through phone calls, seeing as the travel from Manila to my province was about 8 to 9 hours, so I couldn’t really come home. And as usual, my ever so concerned mom would tell me tales of horrors happening around them, and I was always dismissive of it. 
But, one night, as I was walking home from my office to my apartment, I tried dialing my parents’ home phone. Quite peculiarly, there wasn’t an answer. This was strange, because back then they answered pretty quickly, even if I called in the middle of the night. I tried ringing them once more. And once more. And again. And again. And again.

About thirty missed calls later, my senses started to go to overdrive. And of course, my mind went straight to some accident. I really couldn’t think of any possible thing that could’ve happened to them. That’s when I remembered something that my mother told me a week prior.


“I’m scared, son. We’ve been seeing eyes. Eyes in the trees near our home. And our cattle recently have been acting weird. They startle easy. Even the chicken are disappearing.”


I couldn’t believe it. No. That can’t be right. I shouldn’t have dismissed my mother’s statement. It was obvious in her tone that she was genuinely terrified. I can’t imagine what could’ve happened to them. I decided to ring their home phone once more. To my surprise, there was an answer. From the other end I could hear heavy breathing, almost sobbing. Then a rather familiar voice came along. 


“Hello kuya (big brother), is that you? D-don’t come home kuya. Please. Stay where you are. They took mom and dad last night. They’re here. I can hear them. Th-“ 


It was my younger sister, an obvious dread can be heard through her speech as she stumbles through each word. Suddenly it’s as if the phone dropped. Then came a loud bang. Then came the sounds of scurrying. Then I heard what was a sound that will continuously haunt me until the day I die. Loud growls came through and a blood curdling scream rang from my phone. It was my sister, screaming for dear life. Her scream become louder and louder, as we continuously called out for me. Then I could’ve sworn that I heard her life leave her body, as her screams turned into bloody whimpers. 


That’s when the scurrying stopped. Just loud footsteps. But it didn’t seem human. It felt as if whoever or whatever was there, had claws for feet. I couldn’t hear my sister anymore. All I could hear was scratching and tearing. It sounded like a pack of wolves tearing through their prey. I couldn’t take it anymore. I hung up. The image of my family being torn apart still flashing before my eyes. I couldn’t accept it. I wished that my skepticism saved my family, but it was too late. I never heard from them again. And I don’t think I’ll be coming home to our province any time soon.

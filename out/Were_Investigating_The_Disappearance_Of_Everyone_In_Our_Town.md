Welp, we’ve finally made it back. If you’re wondering who I am, my name is Peter, usually known as Pete. To summarize things thus far, my friends and I have been dealing with a lot of weird shit. Now for those who are unfamiliar with me, you can check out some of my posts [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/d4vm1r/i_work_at_the_only_pizza_place_in_townpart_6/) and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/ti7zpn/weve_seen_some_weird_things_on_the_road_finale/) to get you up to speed.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

As for those of you who are, let me say that this is fucking horse shit. I mean we spent all that time training, working out how we were going to infiltrate the town, and guess what? There's nobody here. Well, not entirely, but I'll get to that later.  For now, I'll begin this right as we were pulling into town. I was driving and Carl was using his binoculars to see how far away the blockade was.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"Hey, Pete?" he said.

&#x200B;

"Yeah?"

&#x200B;

"It's gone. It’s been destroyed."

&#x200B;

"Really?"

&#x200B;

“Take a look.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

He handed me the binoculars and I took a quick peek through them.  The SUVs barring entrance to and exit from the town were overturned on the side of the road.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“You’re right, but why?” I asked, putting the binoculars around my neck.

&#x200B;

“Don’t know. Maybe something in town did it. Hey, Nick?”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

He was snoring in the backseat. Carl said his name louder and when that didn’t work, he threw an empty McDonald’s cup at him, causing him to jerk awake.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“I’m up,” he yelled. “Let’s kick some…”

&#x200B;

“Nick,” Carl interrupted.  “There’s been a change of plans.”

&#x200B;

We filled him in.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“So in short, all of our training was for nothing?”

&#x200B;

“Maybe not,” I said. “Let’s see what we’re dealing with first.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

We drove closer and then got out to inspect.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Do you think we should see if anything useful is in them?” Nick suggested.

&#x200B;

“More guns couldn’t hurt,” Carl replied with a shrug.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

The windows on the vehicles were shattered so getting into them was easy. Furthermore, the keys were still in their ignitions. As we were about to check one, Carl spotted something unusual.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Where’s the blood.”

&#x200B;

“What?” I said.

&#x200B;

“There’s no blood. See?”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

He was right. Despite how banged up the SUV was, not a stain of it could be found anywhere in or around it.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Maybe it’s only this one, though,” Nick said. “Let’s check the others.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Doing so got us the same result.  

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Know what?” Carl told us. “I think we should leave this alone for now.”

&#x200B;

We agreed and got back in the car. As we were pulling into town, we expected to be greeted by the sound of traffic or anything. Instead, there was only silence with wrecked cars here as well. In addition to that, there were also knocked-over lamp posts and signs. Our tries are armored so driving through it wasn’t an issue. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

The same thing couldn’t be said for our current situation. You’d think the lack of blood would make the mood less eerie. It did the opposite and I could feel the hairs on my neck rise.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Is everyone gone?” I asked in partial disbelief. “That can’t be. How?”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Things were somber. From our perspective, we failed. All that time we spent preparing only for it to go to waste.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“I can’t believe this.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I kicked away a piece of scrap metal in frustration.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Maybe there’s still something we can do,” Carl said.

&#x200B;

“Like what?”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

He pointed.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Are those cameras?” Nick asked.

&#x200B;

“Looks like it.”

&#x200B;

“But where are they all connected?” 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Using the binoculars, I  followed how far the chords went and the place they ended is somewhere I hadn’t been to in years.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“It’s the town hall.”

&#x200B;

“Makes sense, “ Carl said, scratching his chin thoughtfully. “It is the closest place to the center of town.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

We headed over there.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“First time I’ve been here,” I told Nick as we were heading up the steps.

&#x200B;

“Second for me,” Carl said.

&#x200B;

“What? Then why were you here before?”

&#x200B;

“The mayor needed my help with something. It’s a long story.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

The floor inside was covered in chords. They led to a room in which we could see hundreds of monitors. None of them were on. Still, we knew the footage was saved to something.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Found it,” Nick declared.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

The monitors were hooked up to a single large computer tower. We couldn’t turn it on since there was no power in the building. Carl began detaching the chords from it. Then he hoisted it over his shoulder.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Let’s head to my place,” he said.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Seeing as how it was still day, we weren’t anticipating encountering any creatures yet. We were expecting to as we drove further into the shadows of the woods.  There was nothing.

&#x200B;

“Maybe Zohl’s here?” Nick said.

&#x200B;

“Only one way to find out,” Carl replied, cupping his hands over his mouth.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

We shouted his name only to get silence in response.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Great, so he’s gone too, ” I said. “I never thought I’d say this, but somehow the lack of things trying to kill us feels more disturbing.”

&#x200B;

“I get what you mean,” Carl replied. “Still, it is a decent change of pace. Anyway, let’s get this thing up and running.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

When we got to his house, we found it odd that no agents had tried to break in. However, we figured this was something that could wait until later. He was able to get power to his house through an unused backup generator. Plus, we paid to get his internet back up and running which is how I’m able to post this. Then we hooked up the computer and booted it up.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Shit, there’s a password,” Nick said.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Carl sighed.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Give me a bit.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

He was able to unlock it within an hour and at last, we were able to see what was on it. The files on it went as far back as the month after we left town.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Man,” Nick groaned. “It’s going to take forever to go through all these.”

&#x200B;

“Carl, can you put all of them l on one screen?” I asked.

&#x200B;

“Not with this many. We’ll have to hook up my old TVs. They’re in the garage.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

We grabbed them and Carl proceeded to make it so we could view all the footage simultaneously.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Hey, it’ll take a while for this to finish. How about we do some more exploring in the meantime?”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

The first place we headed to was Formaggio’s.  It’s the place where I used to work and for personal reasons, that I have a connection to. While I was happy to see it after so long, I was also worried about what we might find inside.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“The door’s unlocked,” I said, pushing it open.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

The stench of rot hit us like a freight train. Chairs and tables were overturned with broken dishes and food all over the floor.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“It looks like a fight broke out here,” Nick said.

&#x200B;

“Wouldn’t be the first time,” I added. “But somehow I don’t think that’s the reason for all this.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I went further in.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“What are you doing?” Carl asked.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“I wanna check something.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I went into the kitchen, wrinkling my nose at the smell. It got a whole lot worse. Putting a hand over my nose, I opened the fridge and from it, pulled a bag of moldy cheese.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“That’s disgusting,” Nick told me. “Why are you doing this?”

&#x200B;

“Take a look.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I held it up.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“The date on this is for a little over six months ago which means whatever happened here may have been around that time.”

&#x200B;

“Could be,” Carl said. “Actually, that reminds me, I don’t have any food back home right now.”

&#x200B;

“I’m surprised seeing all this made you hungry,” Nick replied to which he shrugged in response.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

One grocery trip in the next town over later and we were back at Carl’s house. By then, we could watch all the security footage. To do so, he divided it among three flatscreens.  He also installed a program that enables the use of multiple cursors at once so we didn't all have to watch at the exact same time.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Hey, Pete, how’s the food coming along?” he asked.

&#x200B;

“Almost done.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Lasagna was our dinner for tonight, homemade too or as homemade as you can get with store-bought pasta sauce. Although, I did spruce it up a bit. For drinks, Carl had a beer. Nick had Sprite and I had grape soda. Now that we were all set, we were finally ready to watch the footage.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Should we speed it up?” Nick asked.

&#x200B;

“Sure, just make sure you’re paying attention,” Carl replied to him.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Over the next few hours, we viewed what the security cameras recorded.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Looks like the usual monsters so far,” I commented, seeing several returned skitter across the street. “What are you guys seeing on your end?”

&#x200B;

“Nothing much,” Nick replied. “An agent got stabbed.”

&#x200B;

“By who?”

&#x200B;

“An addict I think.”

&#x200B;

“Ah.”

&#x200B;

I took a bite of my lasagna and sip of my drink every so often. We have considered skipping to the end of the footage. However, we don’t want to risk missing anything. Something on them got me super pissed.  One square showed the Formaggios, Alonzo and Donelle. Some agents were harassing them.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Now, Alonzo is usually a nice guy except in cases such as that. Despite being in his late forties, the punch he gave one of them left them temporarily dazed. Then several more agents tackled him to the ground and Donelle sprayed them with mace. Soon, she was apprehended as well and taken away. To where I’m not sure, but I swear there’s going to be hell to pay.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Well, I mean, we did kind of wreck one of their facilities. Still, I won’t let this shit slide.  Further viewing showed us something new and concerning. I saw it on the screen showing Mike’s mechanic shop.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Guys, I think you should see this,” I said.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Carl and Nick came over. Then I let the footage play at normal speed. This took place two months after we left.  It was daytime and raining. It’s in this kind of weather when the creatures our town fears come out to hunt. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

As a result, people may choose to close up shop. Mike doesn’t. I once saw him beat up what we call a long-necked creature with a rune-covered wrench. As an aside, runes are required to deal with the monsters in our town with the exception of the returned. Something was coming towards the shop from the left. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

We thought it was a tree at first. Then when we realized what we were actually seeing, I  got a strong “oh hell no feeling.”. This thing was clearly not a tree for three main reasons. The first is that they don’t tend to have human skin stretched over them and the second is that they also don’t have heads on their tops and bottoms. In this case, the heads were exactly the same in appearance.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

This was reminding me of something.  Nick realized what it was.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Pause it,” he ordered. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I did so and he got close, squinting his eyes. They widened and he stepped back.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“What did you see?” Carl asked him.

&#x200B;

“Hearts on its chest.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

He was right. There were six in total, two small ones on the top, two on the bottom mirroring those, one big one on the top, and one big one on the bottom mirroring that.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Okay, what kind of fucked up Alice In Wonderland shit is this?” I wondered aloud.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Mike came out of the shop along with some workers, blissfully unaware of what was about to happen. That ended when the tree screeched. At least, we think it did. We've been watching without audio. Otherwise, hearing all those noises at once would drive us crazy. Even though I didn't know what it sounded like, that didn't stop my skin from crawling.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Mike and the others turned as its branches shot forward. I really hate my imagination sometimes. It has plagued me with various ideas of the noise that would make and the most likely one I got so far is cracking wood tearing through dead skin.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

The others were grabbed and lifted, struggling  He pulled out his gun and fired at it, hitting the top head. While painful, this did little to hinder it.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“That was practically point blank,” Nick said in disbelief.

&#x200B;

“He doesn’t have the right runes,” Carl told him.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

It would be more correct to say he couldn't have the right ones since this thing was new. The question was, how did it get there? Mike put up one hell of a fight. Unfortunately, the tree managed to nab him by going for his legs. He yelled at it. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

However, we couldn't hear it due to the audio being off. It didn’t answer and he kept cursing at it until eventually, the sound of his voice faded away. I paused the footage and we were all silent. The air was thick with despair.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Carl?” I said.

&#x200B;

“Yeah?”

&#x200B;

“I think we should sleep with our guns within arms reach tonight.”

&#x200B;

“I was thinking the same thing.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Since then we’ve been making sure to keep quiet for the night in case more of those things are out there. Carl’s house isn’t able to protect from those trees. Maybe more of the footage will show the right runes to defend from them. Oh well, time will tell I guess. In the meantime, I’m going to get some rest.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

After all, it’s been [a](https://www.reddit.com/r/StoriesFromRose/) long [trip.](https://twitter.com/RoseBlack2222)

Two weeks ago, me and my girlfriend Paige decided to drive up into Canada and spend the weekend in Montreal. It was a good trip, but I can’t deny that what happened on the drive there put us on edge. It was something of a relief to head home that Monday morning, with the unspoken agreement that we wouldn’t make any more random stops.

On the Friday evening we were driving through forests with the windows down. The strip of sky between the trees was a dreamy pink. The evergreens smelled sharp and cool. Paige was laughing, trying to teach me French phrases which I purposefully botched.

Hey, look!” she was pointing at a muddy, wooden sign for *Pine View Drive-In Theater*, paint peeling, “’You ever been to one of those?” 

“Nah, never.” I was already turning in. “You?”

“No, but I’ve always wanted to. I wonder if it's open.” I was focused on steering the narrow road through the trees but I could hear the smile in her voice. She loves spontaneity. We were making good time, and I’d already told the hotel we’d be checking in late, so why not?

The ticket booth was deserted. The barrier gate was raised, obscured by branches.

“’Damn. Closed.” But it was a one way road, so I drove on.

The road opened onto the theater: a large clearing walled in by pines, their pointed heads swaying in the breeze. We were surprised to find the place packed with cars. This audience must’ve gathered from all the tiny, one-road towns in a 20 mile radius. 

I parked us in an empty space between two cars in the back row. The wheels ground down the overgrown grass, giving off a scent of damp soil.

The movie had already started. There’d been no indication on the way in, but it was Disney’s Fantasia.

“I thought these theaters were for porn.” Paige joked, “What’s this family-friendly shit?”

Having noticed it was a family in the car beside us, I pleaded she keep her voice down. 

"This place is packed." she said, "I guess when you live in the middle of nowhere, you turn up for Friday night at the old drive-in.” 

“Right. What the hell else are you gonna do?”

“Maybe this one never even closed. It could be from the 40s.”

The field sloped down towards the screen. I noted the disorganization that screamed of small town stubborn independence. The cars were packed in a tight lattice, five or six vehicles deep in some spots. If someone had to leave, if there was an emergency, they were trapped. I wondered if folks in those parts were the sort to leave their phones at home, people who didn’t even have an internet connection. 

I’d seen pictures of drive-in-theatres where the movie audio came from speakers next to each window. Here the speakers were fixed to telephone poles; one pole for every hundred square feet. The sound quality wasn’t great.

After a while I started to lose interest in the movie. I’d seen it before and it wasn't really my kind of thing. It had gotten dark. it was hard to make out the line where the trees ended and the sky started. The only light was the beam from the projection station hut to the wall that made the screen. I saw the silhouette of a man emerge from a car in one of the front rows. He ducked between the cars, trying and failing to go unnoticed. He disappeared off to the right, maybe to the bathrooms.

Through the rear windscreen of the car immediately in front, I could see the back of a man’s head. He wore a baseball cap over wavy hair. He looked so still, enthralled by the movie. 

Paige dug a bag of chips from the back seat for us to share. I slouched against my door and she lay across with her head resting on my chest. A cool breeze flowed through the open windows.

A crunch of grass announced a car parking immediately behind us, boxing us in. My stomach clenched for a moment, but I reminded myself we were in no hurry. If need be, we could always ask the driver behind us to let us out. I tried to get a look at them in the rear-view mirror- No good. All I could see was the movie reflected on their windshield.

“Holy shit.” Paige snorted. “That couple in the next car…”

“Don’t point!” She’s always like that. She’s the sort of person where you’ll say ‘Don’t look, but…” And she’s already spinning around in search of the person in question.

“No. Seriously, look. It’s okay.”

The woman in the driver’s seat was wearing shades, which was odd. She was blonde and pretty, with perfectly smooth skin... Wait. Too perfect…

“Is that a mannequin?”

“What the hell?” she was laughing, as she does when confused.

I assumed the mannequin would be sat next to a real person, a lonely fetishist, but instead it was another doll. I didn’t know what to think of that.

I turned to see if the family in the next car had noticed this practical joke. The mom was in the passenger seat, watching the screen intently. Thick waves of red hair concealed her face, so I couldn’t catch her eye. The kids in the back… I flinched: more plastic dolls. Believable at a glance; obviously inanimate now I was rudely staring into the car. 

Paige was leaned far forward, almost touching the windshield. She met my eye and shook her head. “That's creepy. *Some* of these cars must have people in them, right?”

I glanced at the man in front, who on second thought seemed cold and still. But then…

“The car behind us.” I tried to keep my breaths steady, my voice calm, as I looked in the rearview mirror again. It was impossible to see into the car, it was pitch black behind the glass, lively with reflected cartoon pegasuses “And I saw a guy walking around at the front.”

“I’m gonna go investigate.” 

Her hand was on the door handle when the screen went black, plunging us into darkness. Moments later it flickered back to life. The colorful animation was gone. We were watching live-action in black and white… no, the moonlight scenes were just naturally monochrome. 

At first I thought this new film was silent. It took a few moments for my ears to register the deep drone rattling my chest and the walls of the car. I was surprised those tinny little speakers could handle it, but really it felt like the new soundtrack was coming from somewhere closer to the ground, or underground. 

The view on screen scrolled over roots and leaves. The cameraman was walking through a forest like the one that enclosed us, swaying a little, like they might be breathing heavily, but there wasn’t any sound but the escalating groan. There were a lot of flies in the shot, clouds of them billowing up in each step of the cameraman. I knew what this meant, and this new film didn’t feel like fiction. A dip in the earth and there it was, a pale hand peeking from beneath the soil, a shallow grave.

3

The number was stamped on the screen for a split second, overlaid.

Another limb came into view, maybe a bicep. It almost glowed white in the black earth, like some giant maggot.

2

I heard ragged breaths. One, or both, of us was hyperventilating. The low drone now had other tones in it, a dull roar like a hurricane outside the window. The camera panned up to a mound of earth twenty feet across, dotted with half submerged bodies, engulfed in legions of flies.

1

The droning stopped. There was silence, for a split second before the back windshield exploded. 

I turned to see a glinting axe being dislodged from a deep incision between the back seat and the trunk. The wielder was just a dark figure, screaming for blood.

We were screaming too. The figure stalked around Paige’s side of the car. I smashed my door open. With strength I didn’t even know I had, I was grabbing Paige around the waist in one arm and dragging her away from the door. We were on our feet, scrambling away as the man dashed around the hood and lunged at us. I could tell it was a man by his stature- he was easily over six foot- but his face was hidden behind a false female one. The freak had tied a hacked off mannequin face over his own. He seemed to let us get a head start, like it was a bit of fun, then followed.

I couldn’t find Paige- she'd dashed off. I had to escape, but I had to find her. I don’t remember much of the sprint through the field, between the cars, except these frantic thoughts and the tastes of sweat and acid. The man screamed and screamed the whole time, barely pausing for breath. It was the only time in my life I’ve heard a human being make a noise like that. The sound gave me some idea of the distance between us. The worst part was the fear I’d hear him find Paige. I slowed down, trying to think. I crept around the back of a beat up old truck and found Paige twenty feet away, crouched behind a sedan. She looked up in panic, then slumped back against the car.

Further down the hill the man shrieked, painfully, like his throat was tearing in the strain. There was another whine of metal under axe blade. Paige pointed at the trees and I nodded. We crept out of the clearing. My heart was pounding in my ears. I was sure the man would hear it and follow us. I was convinced he could smell the roiling blood in my veins. We crept blindly through the forest, holding hands. I can’t even guess how long we were out there. We kept having to circle around thick copses and choking undergrowth. There could’ve been bears out there. We could easily have fallen into a hidden ravine. I didn’t think about any of that, only escaping the wailing man and his axe.

Eventually, soaked in mud, sap and blood from a hundred scrapes and cuts, we came out on the road. The gap in the forest let in moonlight and we could see a little better. 

Scared our pursuer would hunt us down in his car, we retreated to the trees to follow the road under cover. We walked several miles to the nearest town and found a police station.

Thankfully the two officers on duty were helpful and took our story seriously. The state we were in lent weight to it I suppose. Paige couldn’t stop shaking. Someone gave us mugs of coffee. They knew the drive-in and claimed the strange arrangement was a bit of fun: a weird local ‘tradition’. The theater closed in the 70s. People started abandoning cars there in the 80s. No one remembered when the mannequins started showing up, but the whole messed up sight had become every-day for residents. New dolls were added to the theater's population every year.

However, they were surprised to hear of the welcome sign that had lured us in, and raised eyebrows at mention of the movie: “There ain’t been any projection equipment up there in decades.” 

A few officers drove off to investigate the scene. We were showed to a waiting room where, exhausted, we fell asleep on a couch.

&#x200B;

We were woken by a grim-faced police chief who wanted to ask us more questions. He confirmed that after finding my car and the axe wounds in it, they were filing a report and searching for the attacker. “We checked every car up there- nothing. No clue as to which way he went, but something’ll turn up. We’ll get the word out. We'll have the whole town on the lookout for anything suspicious.”

“Was there projection equipment in the hut at the back?” Paige asked, “We didn’t dream there was a movie playing, right?”

“Yeah. You sure as hell didn’t dream it.” He studied her a minute, then shrugged and shared what he knew he shouldn’t, “It was full of equipment, and spare mannequins. All different shapes and sizes, all dressed up and ready to go. It was like something from a horror movie.” He grimaced, “We’ve been treating the old theater -this ongoing art project- like it was a harmless prank. Now I’m wondering if something stranger's been going on, right under our noses.”

I meant to ask him what he meant, but was interrupted by the screech of his chair's legs on the hardwood floor as he stood.  “I’d like to take you back to the theater. We need you to show us exactly where you ran, where you saw him at the front. You can take your car, if it’ll run still. We can fix some plastic over the rear windshield until you can get to an auto repair.” 

I felt sick to my stomach at the thought of going back, but we had no choice, we were stranded. 

The sun was still behind the trees, but the morning sky was bright white. As the chief cop pulled in behind the rows of cars, I leaned over to see my miserable, beat up car. Thinking how much it’d cost me to get it repaired meant that when I saw the back heads of the mannequins sat in the front seats, all I felt was white hot anger.

“Were those there when your guys investigated?” 

“No.” He made a call. The psycho was still nearby. 

We got out and I studied the mannequin in the driver’s seat. It a generic, angular face, but the ‘skin’ was exactly the right shade of brown. The dark curls on its head had been cut to a precise length: It was supposed to be me. 

The female figure in the passenger seat had Paige’s thick blonde hair; wore the exact shade of lipstick.

Her voice sounded thick and muffled, “How did they do this so quickly? How did they find these clothes? It’s impossible…”

It *was* impossible. They weren’t just similar styles and colors- they were the same fucking clothes. Shirt, pants, even the boots, were exactly the ones I had on. It had been a single night, the stores were closed. How would they even know where we’d bought them? 

We showed the chief where the attacker had come from and the direction we’d ran. We went over the horror scene in detail several times while he made notes. More cops showed up to scour the area once more. One guy helped us brush the broken glass from the back seats and fix a sheet of plastic over the gaping window. Honestly, we were weirded out by how helpful they were; they’re not like that in our area. 

I could only breathe again when we were back on the road. I wasn’t interested in whether they were going to find the guy. I just wanted to run. On the drive, we tried to joke about what had happened, but nothing broke the tense atmosphere. As I said, the whole trip was tough after that. We couldn’t just forget ourselves and relax. 

At least it was behind us. That’s what we thought.

&#x200B;

Yesterday I was doing the dishes and Paige was out front vacuuming the floor of the car. We were finally taking it to the auto repair store that afternoon.  I was drying my hands when Paige came in, slapped a scuffed notebook down on the counter beside me, then bee-lined for the bathroom, where I heard her retching. Immediately I knew where she’d found the book and who’d left it there. I opened it up before I could chicken out.

On the first page was a diagram of the drive-in theater. Neat, rectangular outlines depicted rows of cars, each with a date inside. The dates on the cars nearest the screen were from the early 80s, and as the rows went back, they crawled up towards the present day. I spotted a car right around where we had parked marked 2022/09/16. It was one of three cars on the map circled in red pen, the other two being dated 1998 and 2009. Both had since been crossed out in red. My head started to spin. There were more cars mapped out behind ours, with dates proceeding all the way to April 2034.  

And that’s ridiculous right? I want someone to tell me this is all an elaborate prank.

Paige appeared and quietly pulled a chair up to the counter. The following pages were a series of dates as headers, followed by bullet point lists, detailing car models and license plates, descriptions and sketches of people, sizes and brands of clothes and where they could be purchased. These details were written in different kinds of pen, clearly amended and updated at different points in time. I flipped through to find our date, our car, our descriptions. 

The skin on my arms and neck prickled as I saw the descriptions for female- 29 and male – 28, our car license plate, a note about a mole on female- 29- Paige’s left temple. 

The most chilling line was the freshly scribbled ‘*Incomplete*\- *ESCAPED- somewhere in NY*’ 

My tongue felt swollen, ”New York state doesn’t narrow it down much. There’s no way he can find us. He's got nothing.”

She shook her head. She spoke gently, but it couldn’t take the edge off the truth,  “He knew when we’d arrive. What we looked like… I don’t see what's to stop him finding us here. That film on the projector before he attacked? He was showing us where we're headed.”

“The following texts were recovered while exhuming an unknown explorer randomly buried somewhere near a very unforgiving place, it was humid yet frigid, barren yet damp. While it is not implied if it was the adventurer’s own experience, hallucination, a fever dream, or something transcribed from ancient relics, one thing is for sure, it needs to be disseminated, could it be considered as myth? An urban legend? Or simple a conversation filler on a Saturday night in a local pub or tavern is for you to decide.” 

I would never for once thought that such a thing exists, have you ever feared something you cannot really comprehend?


But rather feel its haunting hostility, the feeling of bludgeoning hands trying to grab you but as you turn your head you see nothing? 


Strange occurrences happened within our settlement that one cold night gesturing the start of the cold season. 


First it was a random scout, assigned to stay up to patrol and protect the settlers as they snugly fit themselves in their hide blankets and fur bedding, then more people were absorbed by the nightly darkness itself every three to four crescendos of the moon’s lullaby.


I wasn’t in the settlement when this happened, I was out the wilderness, embracing the entirety of the world beyond the barricades, inhaling the air filled with different odours produced by the undergrowth and mingled with the overgrowth stench. 


We were hunters when we are outside and considered champions when we are inside, I shall not let myself be named, and hence you shall call me Nameless.


Their confusing tongues sang of the events, although they never used their eyes clearly, their sharp nostrils did not identify the very thing that might have incited the very incidents that caused the importunities, their acute ears did not hear any sound that might have led to the capture of the culprit and yet they sang, not in unison but in a disarrayed arrangement of words and slurs. 


Confusing as it may seem I had to listen, I had to sit by and hear whatever they might say, trying to piece anything that might guide me...us to something that exists but was never before seen and if not found, might cause total desolation.


How could I track something with vague descriptions from inaccurate storytellers?


Huge, dark, quick, prowls, humanoid in appearance but is sightless, anosmic, deaf, and has a void hedged with rows of reddened, needlelike and incandescent compression of appetites. 


It is said to appear where the light casts it shadows, some witnesses opposed the idea, not only it hunts in the shade but wherever it can seek comfort and an abundance of fast fodder forage.


They tried to fend off the creature that appears, they tried to cast stones, hit it with sticks, stab with their blades, chop with their axes yet it always prevails. 


It makes no sound but when it appears it conducts a comely cacophony of chaos, it delights itself in toying with the prey.


I need to track it down, in order to put a stop to its maniacal medley, slaying the creature is the lingering query I do so repeatedly ask as I leave behind the disoriented settlers, still singing, still spouting senseless sentences while the gates to the settlement slowly shuts, soldiers on guard sweeping the skyline for an enemy who comes unannounced. 

As we were hunkering for the night, my compeers and I tried to recollect all of the information we got from the people and tried to craft a clever way to ensnare the creature in question, we were seven men strong, men of the old, the young and men in their prime. 


We were a motley of disposable virile men with no family to return to, just a place we must forfend. As our colloquy accompanied by the gentle crackling of the fire reached its peak we heard a distant rustle perhaps influenced by the puzzling descriptions of a ghastly apparition that gnaws and tatters its prey before devouring it, we hurriedly picked our weapons or whatever is the closest to us in order to defend ourselves with. 


Moments later, a shrew came into view, all of the blood that came rushing up our bodies started to trickle down where it should belong and in succeeding fashion gave out very nervous laughs as we try to look at each other’s blood drained faces. 


We, the men still in a panicked state mutually agreed that maybe it was time for us to set out and chase the herd of sheep leaving two guards as insurance. 


One stout, loudmouthed lad and a lanky yet experienced man in his aging years, they volunteered to stay up till daybreak since they boast themselves as nighthawks in every hunting expedition that we have been through, they should’ve pulled through till the morning but it seems that the smoke was never to blow to our favour, what we saw in the morning was utterly woeful.


The first thing we noticed when we came to our senses after a night’s blessing was that they were nowhere to be found, their morning jovial yet questionably antagonistic manhandling of each other usually rocks us awake however it was different this time. 


Those two never got separated from their weapons but to our surprise their tools lay neatly beside their supposed places. 


The first thing that came into mind was that maybe they went out to gather materials so we went to play the rest of the morning as is, noon came and there is still no trace of them so, being adept at moving fast when working alone. 


I told the other four that I would try to look for them since we still need to put an end to the immense void of a vermin lingering around the area. I weaved through the vast warren of woodlands with its tall trees casting weird shadows and faces on gnarled trees be it dead or alive, fallen or standing though despite the wood’s eeriness and how fast I ran the cold never seemed to try and envelop me, it never amplified the beads of sweat that rolls down from my skin.


After some more wandering I finally saw the first sign of my companions, a single tooth lying beside a log, drops of blood came after, following several marks ahead my tongue seemed to have tripped and folded itself in, disabling me to utter anything that could express my perturbation. 


There were two sets of teeth plucked cleanly out from whomever’s mouths in a pile with no sign of it being bloodied at all and yet lying close is a pool of dried blood. 


A disturbed curtain of trees opened up before me as I raised my head to look forward, the forest floor seemed to have been flipped over, smashed logs, broken branches, busted trunks and scratch marks littered the whole area, one thing is for sure, there was a pursuit and it might be the answer as to why our companions were nowhere to be seen but why leave their weapons behind to pursue a prey that could cause something as destructive as this? Rallying my cowering consciousness I continued on forward. 

After that clobbered clearing, the woods seemed to have huddled even closer as if there wasn’t any disturbance at all, there was a lingering silence in the air, my primitive instincts tells me that it’s not good to continue but the thrill of the hunt screams for me to go on, the fluids inside my body boiled, my sweat turned cold, my body was filled with soft shudders, as if I am caressed by death herself. 


The air around me seemed to have slowed its entry. The hands of time seemed to sluggishly drag itself in its own face, processing this while moving left me mindlessly wandering the woods. 


Not long after that my feet slowly submerged in muddy water, jolting me awake from that melancholic march.


“Traces!, I needed to look for them!” 


Collecting myself, I trudged the small flooded area to reach the other side, as soon as my bare feet licked solid ground, the sun slowly shuttered into the horizon. I have to nod off to the toothless teasing face of the moon.             

As I was rubbing crumbs from my eyes by the side of the flooded area.


I noticed something amiss, a pile of untarnished nails could be seen leading yet into another thicket, bloodstains beside it guided me towards a clearing with a huge cairn in the middle of it, at the foot of the humongous pile of stones, hunched over in a total bloodbath feasting itself over what seems to be a freshly culled cadaver with its back facing me a huge, dark, quick looking figure and a mass of void hedged with rows of reddened, needlelike and incandescent compression of appetites. 


It rapidly snapped its head back in a wide faceless grin which seemed to me looked like he was mocking my sudden appearance telling me that it has waited for me for too long and got bored so it came with a cost. 


It slowly rose from where it was seated with slopping sounds, sporting an unnerving hiss that sent shivers in the back of my neck making me unable to move from my place.


I clutched my club tightly in case that it jumps in for the kill, the forest started to raise its cheers, echoes from brutes, critters and vermin started the charades of combat, the silhouette paced around in its place seeming as if it was contemplating.


As the cheers reached its climax and as a single leaf slowly descended its way to the rest of the foliage, the silhouette exploded from its place with nothing to flail but its arms, in a blink of an eye it came in close preparing for a strike with the tip of its arm.


I struck the entity with my club in the side of its head, a guaranteed lethal blow, if only it was of normal nature. 


The huge figure was whipped from its mighty stance.


I threw my club from over my head to keep it at bay and quickly turned around to exhaust all the air in my body for one great dash that meant life or death, a creature as immense as that taking a deathblow to the most vulnerable part of its body and is still standing despite it being bruised with a window busted from its rows of teeth is not an animal  nor a beast at all. 

It was something else.


A silhouette in flesh and blood. 

I did not even try to determine if I hit him for a second time but one thing is for sure the forest had an orchestra of ferocious howls as I galloped retracing the way I came from.


Lo and Behold! I found that my whole party laid strewn and mangled bits of flesh and garment scattered around. Staring in shock, the figures started to slowly turn their heads, revealing their faces and to my horror, in the same exact appearance, its immense size, and menacing presence with the same injury on the side of its head the only difference is that it isn’t alone, it has doppelgangers for each and every single one of them and yet it or they just stood there staring right at me. 


The howls did not die down to mere hums, the forest dwellers kept their boisterous banter.


I do not know if it is from my nose or from my ears, there was blood from my head trickling down to my body. 


In a state of daze, I kept my composure, steeling my resolve I took one deep breath and quickly bolted out of the scene while racing against the breeze, the first thing that came into my mind was to run back to the settlement to warn them of the creature’s real nature. 


ALAS! I was dumbfounded and in awe for a scene of total carnage and decimation of the whole settlement was furnished upon me by a beast I could not fathom. 

Echoes from the cackle of the forest’s crackling kept on reverberating, bouncing off in every direction possible. 


I passed out, all of the strength in my body leaving comparable as to how the smoke for an offering goes upward.


Woken up by the rondeaux of ravens circling around in a dance of death.


Some picked up scraps and dug through the rubble, 


I dared not to enter the gates, for I already knew what I would witness inside it’s half torn walls and it’s smouldering huts.


The smell of burning flesh and metallic odour of blood lingered in the air. 


The noises from the birds was not accompanied by the chaparral’s chorus.


As I turn my back there it was, its stance was high and mighty.


It wore the same face of the silhouette I tried to slay in the clearing by the cairn.


It’s toothily faceless head that grins and mocks your very soul.                                  


“Beware for when the timber hums the tempo, the silhouette’s symphony serenades every shadow.”

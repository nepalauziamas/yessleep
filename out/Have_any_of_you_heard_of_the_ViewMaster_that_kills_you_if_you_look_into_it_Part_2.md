So picking up from my previous post, David had just hauled a box with chains around it out of the hole he'd been digging all afternoon and now the chains were off, but he and Frank just looked at the thing with reverence and trepidation. I just wanted to speed things along so I opened the lid.

David and Frank looked like they thought it might explode, but of course nothing so dramatic happened. I reached inside and pulled out the box's two contents: a View-Master. A really old plastic one like the kids had back in the 70s. It was dark brown. There was also a disc that went with it. I was decidedly underwhelmed. I started with “So it's--

“It's amazing!!” David finished. Go figure.

“It's just a regular View-Master,” I told him. “I still have the one my parents gave me when I was a kid. I would have given that one to you if I'd known how impressed you'd be. 'Course, it's pink because it was a Barbie one, but still...”

“And look, it's got a disc,” he said with childlike wonder.

“Awe-some!” I responded.

David picked up the disc and held it up to the light, trying to see what was on it. Then he put the disc in and looked inside.

“My God, don't do that!” Frank admonished.

“Do what?”

He pushed David's hands down, forcing the Viewmaster away from his face.

“I should have explained the rules to you before letting you have this thing,” Frank said. “Rule number one: don't ever look inside.”

We waited a few beats for rule number two. When it never came, I asked “And what's rule two?”

Frank looked confused, then said, ”Now that I think about it, I guess there's only the one.”

David told him there was nothing on it anyway, but Frank said that sometimes there is. When pressed about this, Frank said “Well, it ain't glowing red, now is it?”

“Good point,” I said sarcastically.

He went on to give the following explanation. According to this object's particular urban legend, you could look into it when it's not lit up, but it was not recommended, because it could turn red at any second. And you didn't ever want to look into it when it was red.

“Have you looked into it?” I had to ask.

“God, no! Are you crazy??” was his response.

“Well, we're here, so maybe.”

I looked at David. He was turning the View-Master in all directions, fascinated like a little kid with a new toy at Christmas.

“So what happens if you look at the disc when the light is glowing red?” I asked.

“What happens if you look into it when the light is glowing red??”

His voice rose dramatically. He appeared to be about to lose his cool. It felt like he was building toward some huge prophecy of doom. Like he was about to announce the arrival of the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse or something. Then his countenance turned normal again and he spoke quietly. All he said was “bad things.”

“Well, congratulations, dear,” I said to David. “You are now the lucky owner of a View-Master that you can never ever look into and a reel with nothing on it. And on that note, let's--”

But then Frank interrupted urgently. “Wait! You're not the owner yet. Not until you pay the price. This has to be made official.”

When we asked what the price was, Frank turned grim and very serious, leaning toward us. “Nineteen ninety-five,” he said. And after a beat, “Plus tax.”

“Seriously? You charge tax?” I asked.

He seemed almost offended, and said “I'm an honest businessman. I declare everything.”

And so now the thing was ours and soon I was driving us at long last, for me at least, toward the mountain cabin. David was looking at the View-Master in his lap with unbridled curiosity. He looked like he was trying to pry it apart. I asked him if he was trying to break it already. He also put the disc in and clicked the little lever, advancing it from one frame to the next. I think he started thinking he'd been had. David started voicing his concerns to me.

“He says there's a light. Where is it? How do I turn it on? I mean, how is it still working after years buried away? And there's absolutely nothing on this disc! I saw one of these before and there was a whole *Star Trek* episode on it.”

“Oh, you don't say,” I answered. “Hon, did you really fall for that? Of course there's no light. And if there is, that old guy probably put new batteries in it just last week. It's just another scam. And as usual, you fell right in it. And really, that's not the point, is it? I mean deep down you knew this all along. It's just the thrill of the hunt.”

He came back with “The truth is out there,” and grinned.

“All right, Mulder. You got your doohickey. Now I get my romantic mountain cabin getaway. Right?” I asked.

“Drive on, Scully.”

Remember that strange house we passed on the way to Frank's? Well, we went back down the mountain toward Pumpkintown, meaning we would have to pass it again. When we got to it, I had to slam on the breaks. That kid I mentioned earlier that we saw riding a stick horse with the real decapitated deer head was standing in the middle of the road in front of the car. He was covered in blood. Or something that looked a damn bit like it. We looked at each other and both had to catch our breath after almost hitting him.

The kid stared ahead, but not exactly looking at us. He looked like he was dazed or maybe in shock.

Then he walked over to David's side of the car, looking in at the View-Master. He started getting visibly upset, trying to whisper something we couldn't understand.

David started rolling the window down to try to hear him. Something he didn't notice, but I did—the View-Master started glowing red. David moved it away from the kid's outstretched hand. This made the kid grow more frantic, He was trying to grab it, making whining noises as he reached for it.

Suddenly I was shocked by a banging on the my driver's side window. I let out a startled yell and whipped my head around to look.

It was a woman, maybe forty or so. And pissed.

“What the hell??” I yelled. “Will people stop jump-scaring me!?”

“Whatchoo doin' to ma boy?” she asked harshly.

I told her we weren't doing anything to him. He just jumped out in front of our car. She said that “if he jumped out in front of your car, he had a damn good reason. He's retarded, you know,” she added.

All the while I was conversing with his mother, the kid was still struggling with David. They both had their hands on the View-Master, pulling at it. It still glowed red.

“Ezekiel, come here, boy!” the mean mother yelled.

David pushed the button to roll his window up, trapping Ezekiel's hand. Ezekiel was still whining loudly. He tried valiantly, but finally lost his grip on the View-Master. Then I saw that it immediately stopped glowing red. Ezekiel pulled his hand out of the car window and reluctantly walked around the front of the car, looking back. David flipped him off..

“Really?” I asked him. He shrugged.

When Ezekiel reached his mother, she slapped him upside the head.

“Y'all get out from here and leave my boy alone. And drive more *carefuller*,” she admonished us.

“Yeah, we'll try to drive more *carefuller*,” I said. Just before I pulled away, Ezekiel's eyes opened with wonder and he said “It's boo-ti-fullll.”

As I pulled away, movement caught my eye. I looked in the rear-view mirror to see that Ezekiel had broken away from his mother and was chasing our car down the road. I looked over at David, but I don't think he ever noticed him. Once again, he was single-mindedly focused on the little box in his hands.

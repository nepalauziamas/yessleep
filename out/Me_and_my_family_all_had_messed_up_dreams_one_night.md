Happened about a month ago and it was a pretty weird experience for us. I live in a family of 5, however my brother is autistic and can't speak so we don't know if he experienced the same thing. We are somewhat religious and all believe in God, spirits, and the like so my parents' assumption was a "negative spirit" attempting to influence us in some way. 

That night my sister, mother, and dad all had horrid dreams about various family members. My sister dreamt about my mom growing a third eye and becoming some kind of demon creature. My dad dreamt about my sister, he and her were walking across a large bridge when she fell off into the river below. Without thinking, my dad jumped after her and managed to get her out. Finally, my mom dreamt about me. She was back in her home country of Trinidad in the Caribbean. Apparently I was her brother in the dream and I'd come home every day at a certain time. One day I didn't come home and she started to worry while her family members told her I'd probably just gotten held up somewhere. Then came a report from the police that they'd found a headless corpse in an alleyway, and all my mom could think was that it was me.

I heard about these dreams the next day and everyone was surprised that I didn't have one. I found it odd too, but disregarded it.  I go to sleep and sure enough, I have an equally horrid dream. Mine was about my dad. In the dream we'd gone on vacation and were staying with a 2 other people, I presumed they were a couple, in a small house in the woods. We met up with them in the afternoon and went about our day normally. As it was getting late we all had dinner and said good night to each other. Later in the night we hear a scream from the girl, and me and my dad come to see what's wrong. The boyfriend is dead on the ground. My dad steps up and says something along the lines of "there's a rat that is possessing one of us." We all agree to split up and search the area for the rat (I know, like dumb horror movie characters). A little later I catch my dad with the girl's body slumped over his shoulder, and the dream ends with me waving the broken end of a bottle at him, repeatedly screaming "you could be the rat!" Then I woke up in a cold sweat and immediately left my room.

Not exactly a totally inexplicable event, but I have to be honest, the way my house is laid out eerily coincides with the order of the dreams. Everyone's rooms except for mine are upstairs, and the stairs are right next to the front door. My room is also on the opposite side of the house to the door. If something entered through the front door intending to do something to us, but not with full knowledge of the house or people inside it, I could see how it'd only check upstairs on the first night and then assume its job was done, only to come back again the next day to make sure. Spooky.

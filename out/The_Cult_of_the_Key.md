An unusual journal found its way into my possession this spring. Has anyone heard of the Cult of the Key?

*From the Journal of Dr. Adrian D. Mern,* 

*March 21, 1992*

*Nice, France*

Natural disaster. War. Plague. All of these dark stains on human history call out to the Cult of the Key. When my contact across the border sent me a report indicating that the cult was converging on the Catacombs, I didn’t doubt it for a moment. While the death toll from the nuclear meltdown six years prior was minor compared to something like a world war, the damage done to the environment, to the very soul of the soil, was extraordinary. The land surrounding the Catacombs would be sick for generations. The reality there was…*thin*. Fragile. It was like an inch of ice separating the surface from an impossible depth. 

What the Cult of the Key is looking for on the other side of the ice, I do not know. But I will find out. 

*March 24, 1992*

I think I’m being followed. I don’t see how the cult could know that I am aware of their activity around the corpse of the nuclear reactor. But strange men with green eyes and identical faces watch me. I’m sure of it. My goal isn’t to stop the Cult of the Key, I simply…I need to know what they are doing. What worlds they are looking into. Even hundreds of miles from the Catacombs, I can feel a thinness in the air, the water.

There’s a pressure building around the Catacombs. The Accident has left a stain that will fracture eventually. The cult hopes that it will break now but I suspect it might be a decade or two or three. When it does crack, I wonder what will come through? Or will it simply leave a hole that we all get sucked into, a raw wound in reality, a blackhole? 

I’m heading to the exclusion zone around the Catacombs in the morning. My plan is to camp in the Boneyard, the town that was abandoned when the plant began to spit radiation. There are locals living in the zone; some, I’m sure, are members of the Cult of the Key. I’ll follow and watch, but I don’t plan on trying to stop them from whatever they’re doing. 

Melissa…I miss you every day. If there’s some other world or afterlife, I know that you’re there. You have to be. If you can be found, I promise I will find you. 

If they manage to open a door, I will walk through it. 

*March 27, 1992*

*Catacombs* 

I’ve been camping in the forest outside of the Boneyard for the last few days. I made contact with the local exclusion zone settlers almost immediately. They are, for the most part, scattered into small family groups and micro-villages. Already, I’m seeing signs of the cult’s influence. The symbols are everywhere if you know what to look for: tiny tattoos, markings above doors, scratches on trees. Keys. Always keys. 

The most intricate of the designs also include an eye above the key. Those marks I’ve found in abundance all around the perimeter of the Boneyard. I’ve engaged a local guide to show me the ghost town tomorrow. I can feel that something is happening around the Catacombs. We are approaching the anniversary of the initial meltdown and the air seems swollen with heat and light. I truly believe that a gate might be about to open to another world. To Heaven, perhaps.

To Melissa. 

*March 28, 1992* 

I am a fool. My guide, Inessa, seemed kind, trustworthy, and almost a little naive. She led me through the empty streets of the Boneyard early in the morning while fog still hung over the asphalt. We walked through the famous amusement park, all of the rides leaning over us like forgotten scarecrows covered in rust. 

When I asked Inessa if she’d seen any markings that resembled a key, she smiled and told me there were plenty under the town. She meant the Boneyard’s sewers. We climbed down deep into the underground. It was surprisingly warm and there was a green glow that made it easy to see how empty and tight the space was. I had to hunch over as we walked through a tunnel. The source of the light became apparent soon enough. 

Moss. Green moss carpeted the sewer, hanging from the ceiling, clogging the drains. Inessa rounded a corner ahead of me so quickly I lost sight of her. I sped up to follow, darting around the corner and nearly tripping on a patch of moss. 

I never saw who hit me. They must have been waiting against the wall. One moment I was in the sewer and the next I was waking up in a small cell. 

It seems the Cult of the Key knew I was following along behind them. They removed my knife and lighter and all of my cash, but did leave me my journal, at least. Now all I can do is wait.

*Late March or early April,* 

It’s impossible to count the days down here. There is light from the moss but it is dull, sickly, and never changes. I’ve been held prisoner by the cult for a few days or a week or a few weeks. They feed me occasionally, and provide water, but refuse to answer questions. The cultists are strange; they all dress in white and wear blank, white masks. The only ornament that distinguishes any of them is what type of key they wear around their neck. The larger and more impressive the key, the higher the cultist ranks within their hierarchy. That’s what I assume, at least. 

I spend my days sleeping and waiting and writing down thoughts here only to tear out the pages and start over. It feels like I’m standing on the edge of a terrible cliff. Something is coming, and soon. I hear strange cries echoing through the chamber around the cells. I can’t see much, only a blank wall opposite my enclosure, but there are times when it sounds like there are wild animals nearby. Not long ago I heard what might have been a bear but soft, perhaps only a cub. The roar trailed off into sobbing, though, that I am certain was from a little girl. 

The only conversation I’ve had so far was with another prisoner several cells down. He’s an English tourist visiting the Catacombs by the name of Robert. The man has managed to remain in good humor despite our circumstances. He told me a joke recently, I think you would have liked it, Melissa. 

*How do you get Holy Water?* 

*You boil the Hell out of it.* 

*April*

*In my cell, rotting*

The cult has failed. It’s taken me several days to gather the presence of mind to write down what I saw…I’m still not sure how much was real. I fear all of it was. The ordeal began when I was ushered out of my cell by two cultists dressed in all white. I was led to a line with six other prisoners, including Robert. We were taken to a massive chamber deep underground. Patches of moss lay in clusters all across the domed ceiling. 

They chained us in a circle in the center of the room facing outwards. Dozens of cultists gathered in the amphitheater around us, sitting and chanting in a language I did not understand. A single cultist dressed all in black and twice as tall as any man I’ve ever seen, stalked the circle around us, stopping every now and then to sniff at us, prisoners. It stopped when it reached Robert. The chanting stopped, as well. 

The tall cultist removed an object from his robes. I recognized it immediately as a piece of the material. If the gray object was from the Catacombs, from one of the reactors…I could practically feel the radiation crackling off the material. Two white-robed cultists suddenly rushed forward to hold Robert. They choked him and then forced his jaw open wider and wider until I could hear the tendons popping like bubble wrap. My formerly cheerful friend was trying to scream but it only came out as a gurgle. 

His cries were further muffled when the cultist in black lifted the large material chunk high and then shoved it down into Robert’s throat. The Englishman’s eyes bulged but the chains and cultists prevented him from reaching for his neck. He fell and began to convulse on the floor. His captors murmured what sounded almost like a prayer above him, then began moving from prisoner to prisoner repeating the process. Jaws were pulled open until they broke, radioactive the material pressed into mouths so hard that teeth came out, and the men and women in the chamber began to die. 

I was determined to stay steady, to die with dignity. But when the cultists were nearly to me, I have to admit I lost my nerve. It would be such an ugly way to die. I began to tremble in my chains, helpless. Before my executors reached me, however, the chamber began to fill with an eerie green glow. The light from the moss was becoming more and more intense with each sacrifice. An odor was flooding the room, the burning smell of scorched ozone that follows summer lightning storms. 

In the neon brightness of the moss, I saw mad shadows cast around the chamber; terrible shapes and forms danced and snapped and seemed to *push* away from the walls towards us. There was a flash of light and a deafening *crack*. I fell and curled into a ball. The room was engulfed in agonized shrieks. The phenomenon lasted less than a minute but it felt like a lifetime. When I finally worked up the courage to open my eyes, I saw a room painted red by violence. 

Dozens of cultists lay dead and dismembered, a scattered pile of limbs and torsos. Many of the dead had lost their masks, revealing faces disfigured by mutation and radiation. A few of us prisoners still lived, as did perhaps a third of the cult. We were rushed out of the chamber quickly, the great doors barred from the outside. Whatever ritual the Cult of the Key attempted that day, they clearly failed. 

It’s been…I’m not sure how long it’s been since the incident. I believe I’ve guessed the approximate date. Catacombs suffered a meltdown on April 26, 1986. The cult ritual was likely on the anniversary of the event. I’m not sure why I’m still alive. Perhaps they are saving me to use as a sacrifice next year. It does not matter; I am familiar with the early signs of radiation sickness, the “sunburn,” the fatigue. I’m certain that my direct exposure to the material during the ceremony will kill me soon. It will not be a pleasant death, so I may try to…conclude things myself sooner if I can devise a suitable method. 

I am scared, Melissa, and I am tired, but I take some measure of comfort in knowing that the cult’s ritual has proven to me that there are other worlds than this. I hope that I will find you soon, wherever your spirit wanders, and that we might be together again. 

Goodbye. And see you soon.

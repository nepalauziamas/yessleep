Hi..  Don't worry its not a dumb time traveling story and this does in fact  happen a few times a month.. Ill talk about the 4 main dreams here, not  the micro dreams. Enjoy.

The  Nintendo 64 was a huge staple of many childhoods including mine, I had a  lot of fun when it came to games like Super Mario 64 and Legend of  Zelda. We're focusing on Legend of Zelda Ocarina Of Time a game of which  i only just recently beat, A big expansive open world despite not being  so open by todays standards. I loved the game as a kid and i loved the  concept and still do, I never really cared about the missions you had to  do, I just loved exploring. Ocarina of Time had a few dark images (at  least when you're a kid) and they engrave themselves into your head..  Lets talk about the dreams.

Dream 1  (When i was about maybe.. 10-11)  
Starts out traveling Hyrule Field and  just wondering around until i noticed a white skull with horns floating  in the sky just below the skybox. While there is a white skull with  horns mask in ocarina of time, it wasn't that one.. it was more a mix between the skull kids mask and the mask of a shy guy from mario and it  looked like it was shaped to my facial structure. It would watch me,  floating in the sky and turning every direction I turned.. creepy.. but  not enough to detour me from roaming around Hyrule Field.

Dream  2 (Age will not be disclosed from here on in)  
Starts out roughly the  same, exiting the highly detailed warp zone except this time the mask  was closer, still in the sky, but very obviously looking down upon me,  and watching. I felt significantly slower, and it felt like i was  trudging through dirt every step I took.. My character would.. lag.. and  have the rubberband effect every once in a while but i thought nothing  of it

Dream 3 (My second most  recent dream, it started when I started replaying the game to beat it  recently)  
This dream... was nothing like the other dreams, the game  started with the Hyrule Field floor, with no sky box just black, and the  skull mask waiting for me up close around the bend to enter the main  field.. i turned and just stared at it, it circled around me \*please  note, this is a first person thing.. so much worse\*  and just got close  to my face and stared into my eyes. I woke up at 2 in the morning that  night.

Dream 4 (My most recent dream, after i finished the game.. happened tonight actually)  
The dream started much like the other one, the Hyrule Field floor with a black sky box.. but no mask this time, nothing waiting for me.. just a wide open area for me to explore.. and thats exactly what i did.  I wondered the field for so long.. until my face started itching.. it itched so badly to the point where i just wanted to pull off my face.. and thats.. kinda what i did, i itched my face around the corners boarding my hairline, and i pulled the mask off my face.. the mask that was a perfect fit to my face, i flipped it over and just stared at it.. the blank face staring back at me.. the thing thats been tormenting me for so many years.. in my hands.. I passed out in dream shortly after, waking up in a dark room and in front of me a bunch of other stone walls that seemed like an infinite maze.. and occasionally from the dark the large mask would come out, slowly creep into my field of view and dart in front of me.. blinding my face with lights before slowly creeping back into the darkness.. creatures peering around the stone wall corners and staring at me (They looked like redeads, long tall figures wearing the same mask that ive been describing) but they looked a little different.. they looked like regular people.. just.. dead.. stuck in the mask.. after what felt like hours of this mental torment.. i woke up in my dark room, at 4 in the morning. Im writing this at 4:33 in the morning, 33 minutes after this dream.. its still so vivid in my mind like the other ones..

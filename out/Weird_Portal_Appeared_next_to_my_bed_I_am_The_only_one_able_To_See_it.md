 My name is Joseph, well actually it's Josip pronounced 'yo-sip', as its the Serbian equivalent for Joseph so just call me Joseph since it will be easier for you to pronounce, My Parents Are, well I don't want to Brag but they are richy rich kind of people.

My Dad Is From Serbia and he owns more Mansions than I can count all around the country and outside of it, my Mom's side of the family is From Germany , and owns only 4 Mansions there, I say only due to how ridiculous my Dad's side of the family has that it's absurd to compare them.

They would make me Attend Random Weddings, meetings, and Political bullshit that I honestly didn't care about.

My Parents never let me have real friends as they were disgusted by their social class being below ours, the only time I got to talk to people was when I was at school, and mind you I had to beg them to let me go to a public school rather than to hire people to educate me privately.

I met a friend there for the first time, his name was Phillip, Philip was a great friend during school, my dad always saw me as someone who will take over his company, Phillip's dad had wanted him to become a doctor.

even tho I had attended public school it was obviously one specifically designed to suit English-speaking people, growing up I only had the chance to get to know Serbian as my first language, and then English as my second, just before 1920 we moved to a small German town "Bad Wimpfen" to live there, surprisingly my dad allowed me to bring friends home after I got into school there, so Phillip would often come home with me lately and we would play chess.

He has beaten me a lot of times that we played,

my allowance was huge so I decided to buy him a chess board so he could practice with his family.

I got better at chess despite him worrying that I might have brain damage from how many times I lost to him, I still remember him visiting me for the first time, that stare he gave off with his jaw so wide it was about to fall off when he saw the mansion I live in.

Right now I'm Shaking as the Tears of those Old memories have come back to me, you see not long after I met him he got hit by a Carriage whose Horse went berserk, aside from Phillip 10 more people died that day, I thought I couldn't live any longer and I was devastated completely.

I got addicted to books, and after that, I shut myself in my room not going out for days, I had returned to private tutoring my dad had originally wanted, but now he insisted I go to public school again to forget my loss of a friend by talking to more people as what I was doing by locking myself in wasn't healthy.

one night at random on the wall to the left side of my bed something that seemed like a portal appeared, it woke me up with a weird wooshing sound.

what I saw was a clean hole in the wall that lead to some sort of forest with a green sky and a black hole in the place of the sun in the distance, I thought I finally lost it, that I had become completely insane or that it was simply a dream and I went back to sleep.

tomorrow when my parents called me for breakfast I froze after waking up, I saw that the hole in the wall leading to that forest was still there, I stared at it almost mesmerized in shock, because I haven't replied my dad rushed in worried sick and asked: "is something wrong son, why haven't you answered me yet?"

all I could muster out was simple "t-this, on, the wall, the thing"

my dad looked at me in confusion saying "what's the matter son, is there a bug on the wall or something?"

I didn't know how to react to him acting as if everything was normal as if he couldn't see the damn giant hole in the wall leading to who knows where

"can you not see it?"

'see what?' my dad responded with a quizzical look with one eyebrow being down while the other was up

"there's a hole in the wall"

my dad looked at me confused, worried that I might be going insane and I was too, next thing I knew I took the lamp from the table and tried to put one end of it through the hole as I hold the other, just like poking a dead animal with a stick, the lamp went right through and my dad had his jaw right open, it took him a minute to calm himself before finally answering

"joseph I didn't know you learned how to do magic tricks, this is a good one too, I can't even begin to guess how you could manage to make it look like you fused the lamp with the wall"

he said that as he exited the room, the breakfast that day was not as tasty as usual, despite the fact that it was made by the same maid whose food I always enjoyed more than the rest, but sadly she was a sickly person and would get sick as often as once a month or even once every two weeks, so getting the food she made should have been more enjoyable than yesterdays considering that a different maid made it right?

yet despite that, I still didn't like the taste it was as if something was gnawing at the back of my head,

now I know that any normal person would run away from a house that has a literal portal to hell in it, heck it was in my very bedroom, but if you couldn't tell by now I am by no means a normal person

I tried stepping through the portal and fell on the grass hitting my nose hard, it appears the portal was a bit elevated from the ground, I was in a small circular grass plane that if it were filled with water it could pass as a small lake, all around it were trees, given the fact that the sky was green and the sun was black the greenery felt greener? if I could say it like that.

I heard screams behind the trees, so I did what anyone with half a brain would, I ran back toward the portal scared, as I did something heard my footsteps and I felt a light pain in my shoulders as I saw claws dig into them to grab them, something pulled me, and as much as I struggled I couldn't get out of their grip as they dragged me behind the trees, just before I got thrown into a cage with about 10 other people in it, I saw what my captors really were, what had captured me had a skull of a deer and was a spitting image of a wendigo from Native American folklore, and I noticed other cages, people were starving in them, it seemed like some of them have been in there for weeks.

"you think they're starved enough to transform Geroi?"

asked a wendigo that looked to be the leader of the group with more bulky muscles than the one who caught me

"yes my general, I think if we bite them now, another soldier of our glorious Xello shall descend from the void, and eat this humans soul and take over his body"

"Good, let me have a taste," said the bulky one as he opened one of the cages and 3 boys and 2 girls got taken out, the youngest was about 5 years old while the oldest was about 10, then I gaped jaw wide and afraid in horror as the wendigo bit a large portion of each of the children's hands, one minute later they all fell to the ground, screaming and riving in agony, screams were replaced by laughter as the skin became paler, their hands grew claws and lastly the head slowly got replaced with what appeared to be a deer skull

i sat in there trapped for hours,then the battle of monsters began as a group of serbian very well known monster,mostly used in tales to scare children had appeared "the screamer" or "drekavac" as its known in serbian language,the myth of the screamer sais it only appears in forests and mountains,it looks like a small demonic more humanoid monkey looking like being with sharp claws and shark like teeth that seem to be able to grind meat of bones clean,it can posess souls of dead children who have not been burried with a christian ceremony or the ones who got burried on edge of graveyards,once they do that they can mimic the child's voice and appearance to lure in people, all while pretending to be lost children only to break the illusion seconds before people aproach so they can claw at them and consume their soul as they eat their heart and brain,it is said that the sound its scream makes sounds like bunch of children screaming along with all animals in the forest,like it was fused into one voice rather than being multiple yet it was multiple all at once in such a way that chills your very bones.

I never believed screamers were real, I only heard about the screamer when I was little as "the screamer will eat your soul if you don't do this or that" as a warning from my parents to behave, yet now I was staring that same myth dead in the eyes as they started to battle the wendigos and started clawing on people, I didn't have time to think, at the back of the cage there was one steel bar that seemed separated just wide enough for me to go through, I just barely squeezed out of there and started running for my life, not even once turning my back to the people's terrified screams, when I felt something clawing at my legs and I fell down I accepted my fate closing my eyes, only to hear gunshots, as I looked towards the origin of the sound I saw a girl around my age holding a shotgun, as soon as they saw her the screamers ran away.

I turned back towards the cages and saw that all wendigos and the people were dead

"Are you alright?" the girl said with obvious concern in her voice

"I'm fine" I just barely answered trying to hold back tears

"I couldn't help them, I ran away like a coward"

"you couldn't have saved them even if you tried, you would have died the same way they did, sometimes it's good to run away, if you get overwhelmed by the enemy there's no shame in running away"

just as she said that I started to cry, she placed one hand on my shoulder and we stood there for a while before she said

"well it's not every day I get to see one of the nobleman kids"

"nobleman kids?" I answered confused

you know the people who can afford clothes from outside the Taksiut dimension, usually, when new people come in they get their clothes stripped off and replaced by rags as the rich people get all the good clothes

"Why don't people just go out of this hell through the portals?" as I said that she looked at me as if I had just said some nonsense as if why does gravity exist

"because no one can see the portals obviously, and usually they're 2 meters off the ground anyway, so finding out where they are is challenging, on top of that altho the ones back on Earth are always in the same place, once someone goes through the portals on this side, they change their locations, we once on accident found that because the location of a portal got changed for only 5 meters to the east once, as one man went through it, it once again changed location and the rest of the village here couldn't return, this happened a week ago I think"

"I can see them, or at least the one I got through I can see, and it didn't change location," I said faster than I should and I began to feel regret creeping by as I saw a gigantic smile on her face"

"let me show you to the villagers, if what you are saying is true, then we can all exit this wretched place"

"you said this world is called the taxiut?"

she looked like she was deep down suppressing an urge to laugh as hard as she possibly can

"no it's not a taxi, you spell it as 'tak-See-ot' tho you do write it differently, so some people even started to change its name when speaking about it cause it's easier."

"can you tell me what do you know about this place?" I asked as we started our walk towards what looked to be a medieval village in the distance

"Sure I can, my name is Katrina, yours?"

"Joseph"

"well Joseph,these things the people started calling wendigo's,they are apostles of last of the void masters,his name is Xello,void masters are an ancient race that somehow is able to live in the void between universes,he and his people believed that existence of universes is an abomination that needs to be destroyed,from the universe of fairy's there was even something they call nuclear weapons,i asked them what kind of magic is needed for such power and they said that its a science weapon just like bombs and not made out of magic,that it is just so much more powerfull,powerfull enough that it can destroy an entire planet if theres 20 of them dropped on it,they also said that us humans will reach that level of technology soon,the explosion didnt even leave a scratch on Xello,tho it did give them more chance to escape,last thing they saw before they opened up a portal they call a wormhole to this universe was a giant humanoid cockroach that has 3 heads creep in towards their moon and swallowed it whole,and they just barrely escaped as it was beggining to devour their planet aswell.

from what i got from the wendigo so far,Xello is an immortal being that swallows all matter in the universe,there is 100 357 universes in total,void masters were the first to create universes before time itself,and then a rebbel faction among them appeared,they killed the other void masters and desided that creation of the universes was a misstake,but then something else killed all the void masters,even the wendigo don't know what caused it,it happened while Xello was sleeping,when he woke up he was the last remaining void master alive,Xello can't consume universes from outside of them in his full size as each universe is protected by a barrier,only way for him to eliminate all life in them is by making his wendigos infiltrate each race,the first are made when intelligent races eat one of their own,those are the strongest and often apointed to become generals,then theres second generation wendigo,they are made by either first or second generation wendigos biting on people and making it easy for Xello's servants to eat their soul and occupy the empty body,once enough of sentient souls are consumed cracks in the universe appear that Xello can open and enter through.

the ancients are the people of this universe, it is speculated that they are the ones who killed all of the void masters as this universe already reached its heat death stage, meaning only black holes remained for energy source, they somehow managed to make this world have a stable orbit around one, and every time any race or anyone else tries to make a portal of some sort it will always lead to this world for some reason, and there have been cases of thousands of different races showing up so far, one strange thing is not a single one is able to control their appetite towards human flesh, wendigo's only form when someone eats someone else from their own race, but when intelligent races eat someone from another intelligent race nothing doesn't happen at all, which is lucky for us considering that every single race in this world has a taste for human flesh or blood, oh hey look we arrived."

after hearing all that be dumped on me i couldn't speak for the rest of the day,how could anyone with such wild facts being thrown on to you,it just isn't possible,i spent the night in their village that was heavly guarded from all other races as i heard and not just the wendigo,faries can't keep their desire to consume human flesh to a minimum,they easly get aroused by the smell of humans tho their moral side usualy prevails,those that do taste human flesh get terminated by their government on a public execution,i learned how fairies look aswell as durring the night there was a fairy visitor tasked with giving humans medicine for various diseases they just didn't have access to any sort of cure yet,they were hidious,small reptilian creatures with black eyes and no pupils,row of sharp teeth and two pairs of what seemed like butterfly wings on their back,he flew away just as soon as he delivered the medicine,his name is Gdars as the guards told me,tomorrow i led the villagers back with me to the portal,only half have followed due to them being sceptic.

when we crossed over back to my house I had small dread go across my spine as I wondered how to explain why was I not home for an entire day and why is the house filled with medieval dressed men and women, when I got down the stairs I asked one of the maids where is my father and thought to myself "oh boy this is going to be such a long lecture" I heard her crying and she said that while my parents were worried about me and were searching for me, as they were descending down the stairs my mom slipped and started falling, as my father tried to grab her he fell down as well, she said that another maid saw it all happen as they broke their neck instantly and decided to resign from the job the moment I return.

I was devastated during next entire week as we evacuated more than a few villagers next to the portal from the other side, one rogue screamer that apparently wasn't in a pack this time ran towards me and only me and Katrina were there, last people to go back to human civilization, we had no ammo, and as I prepared for death because I knew those things are just far too damn fast, Katrina suddenly went faster than my eyes could register in front of me and pierced through the screamer with what appeared to be a tail at first, I froze in shock and fear at what I saw, Katrina had not one but two pairs of angel-like wings on her back, a tail and out of that tail, there were 7 hands coming out,3 on each side of the tail and 7th at the tip of the tail.

"k-Katrina you are n-not"

"not human" she intercepted before I could finish

"I'm of the Derza race, but your people had given another name for us 'vampires', we have an unquenchable desire to consume human blood, but I managed to hold it in and roam from village to village of humans without anyone noticing that I'm not human as I hid my true form and pretend to be one of the villagers, we can survive of normal human food just fine, it's just that sometimes when we smell human blood some of us can go into a frenzy and lose their minds, I learned to control my thirst in the name of curiosity about human society, our world still hasn't been destroyed and we have same invisible portals like you humans have to Taksiut, we have discovered the true meaning behind the name ancients gave to this world "tak" means courage "see" means in darkness and "ot" defiantly so the meaning of the Taksiut is 'defiant courage in the darkness' "

I twitched nervously at the horror I was in when I remembered that Katrina was staring at my neck for a long time "y-you were staring at my neck the whole day yesterday" I said with a slight fear

"oh yeah, listen I don't know what is it about you, but I can't stop staring at you, so if you're not against my hideous form you see before you now, would you consider going out with me?"

"going out with you as in dating?" I answered immediately knowing what she meant but wanting to confirm as things moved too fast

"yes exactly, also the myth of vampires living forever is true, also humans are similar enough to us in DNA in such a way that turning you into Derza through bite was possible given the fact that our cells keep merging with yours to upgrade them, I guess old void masters must have constructed our two races the same way"

"I guess that I wouldn't mind being turned into a vampire if it means eternal life, but why are you offering that to me now?"

"Well you found out about me and id like you not to be a scared human giving away secrets, also I was already interested in you a bit, but this gives me even more reason to get into a relationship with you"

"I guess there's no harm in eternal life"

The next day I founded a special homeless shelter specifically for the people who lived in Taksiut across generations and had no clue where their families were in this world, I went on a date with Katrina the day after that, and we got back to the mansion drunk and I started to sob as the weight of both my best friend and my parents started to settle in, I fell asleep sleeping on her lap and she woke me up with a kiss.

3 days after that I held a funeral for my parents, I didn't know what to think anymore I spent half of that night crying after Katrina saw me something clicked in her that now was the time she bit me, and right after that in a frenzy to stop her bloodlust I tied her to a chair, after I woke up next morning I was highly alert, I could hear what people were talking about 3 rooms away I felt faster, stronger, and I asked her does sunlight hurt us and she told me that sunlight and garlic are just a myth tho a stake through the heart would kill anyone vampire or not, I made a little chuckle at that one.

not too long after that, given the size of my inheritence,i used as much money as possible to form an organization that hunts wendigos,after all if enough of human souls is consumed in this universe,it will be enough energy to open a path for Xello to enter our universe,i wanted to use word dark as from 'see' of taksiut wich would mean darkness,and 'ark' as in noah's ark, and so i formed "Black Ark" as "Dark Ark" thymes too well in almost humorous way,thats why i chose word black instead of dark, 'Black Ark' organization specialized in hunting down wendigos and securing as many portal locations as we could find to make sure no stray wendigo would go through from Taksiut, black flag with a half moon and a rapier sword over it,that is our emblem as protectors of humanity that forever keep standing defiant against Xello,i tried searching for gifted humans not long after i heard that magic exists in all sentients by faries themself,altho they focus more on technology than magic it does exist non the less,and i managed to find only 3 people able to do what i really wanted,wich is predictions of the past and mind search of some sort,they managed to lead us to some sort of huge box of unknown black metal in Taksiut left by the ancients,it is so dense it should be on the verge of becoming a black hole,yet it has weight of a regulair container for its size,we managed to bring it back to earth for analysis and so far we haven't got anything except one mental messege left by the ancients for our 3 psychics to read "here lies the key to destroy the void masters,be careful,for power that resides inside can destroy a universe"

as the years passed I haven't aged a day, yet our organization stands strong, I turned the 3 psychics Robert, David, and Emily into vampires in hope that their powers will be the key we might need one day to use whatever is in this container against Xello, I felt proud as I stepped into a large training hall shortly after finishing my morning coffee " ah I see I got a bunch of new recruits for special operations division of Black Ark, now repeat after me the oath 'upon my life I swear to be loyal to the black ark and its cause, long live the Black ark, long live humanity, death to the Xello and his abominations' "

"UPON MY LIFE I SWEAR TO BE LOYAL TO THE BLACK ARK AND ITS CAUSE, LONG LIVE THE BLACK ARK, LONG LIVE HUMANITY, DEATH TO THE XELLO AND HIS ABOMINATIONS!!"

"aha I can see the Black Ark has gained promising recruits, General Thompson will lead and train you from now on, welcome to the Black Ark"

I don’t think I have much time to explain everything--I doubt I’ll even get to the end; but I’ll do my best to provide as much information as possible before they get inside. They’ve stopped trying to brute force their way into the room, but that only worries me more...They’re plotting something, those two *things* I foolishly let myself trust  

I’d gotten an invitation to come visit my brother earlier in the day. His wife and daughter had gone to visit our parents, and he’d stayed behind to nurse his sprained ankle—though I suspected he just wanted some time away from the family, as well. He called and said I could come over, and we could play some video games like the old days when we were kids. I happily agreed, and came over.  

He has two dogs, a middle-aged husky and a corgi puppy. They’d always been friendly to me before tonight...but I’ll get to that in a minute.  

Halfway through the night, we finished off all of the coffee he’d made upon my arrival, so I got up to make a pot and order some food. The dogs, left to their own devices, had been wandering around all day; presumably playing some dog game of their own. I remember finding it pretty cool, how well the two vastly different breeds got along, especially how they always seemed to be holding some silent communication with each other.  

While waiting for the coffee to brew and setting up the order, I happened to hear a noise come from the laundry room, which is connected to the kitchen. Figuring that the dogs had knocked something over, I went in to check that they were alright and that nothing important (or hazardous) had broken. Opening the door, I found the corgi sitting on top of the dryer, and the husky sitting—with an almost eerie calmness—before the dryer; as if the corgi had been making some important pronouncement from atop the perch.  

It might’ve been the coffee, or some psychological coping assumption that this was normal behavior for dogs with whom I wasn’t too familiar, but I just stuttered out, “Sorry” and shut the door a little, leaving them to continue their canine conference. I had planned on mentioning the sight to my brother, if only to assure myself that what I had seen was in fact normal for his dogs, but then he shouted out from the living room about something important happening in the game—and I forgot about the strange laundry room incident.  

Later in the night, after the food had arrived, we decided to watch something as a short intermission from vidya-playing. We threw on a show we’d both been meaning to watch, and settled in. I hadn’t seen the dogs since the weird moment in the laundry, and the thought of them hadn’t crossed my mind since then. But during a coincidental moment of silence in the show, I heard a noise—a sort of tittering; like a chirping cricket but deeper, and less rhythmic. My brother had heard it too, and had no idea as to what could’ve caused it. Seeing as how I was the only one who could comfortably walk, it was up to me to get up and investigate. I didn’t *have* to, but given the weirdness of the sound—neither of us had ever heard anything quite like it—we figured it’d be best to check it out. 

I walked into the kitchen and toward the laundry room, driven there by my unconscious mind making a connection between one point of weirdness and another. The laundry room was dark—but empty; neither of the dogs were in there, so I walked back out into the kitchen and listened for the sound again. When I heard it, I followed the noise to the foyer, and then up the stairs to the second floor. I hadn’t gone up there all day, and upon reaching the top I realized that I probably should’ve brought my phone—the lights were off, and I wasn’t familiar enough with the layout to immediately know where the light switches were. Not a huge deal, but given the circumstances I was pretty nervous.  

The sound was coming from my left, so I went down that hall (there were two branching from the stairs) and eventually found myself entering the upstairs bathroom. Unsurprisingly, the sound stopped once I entered, but I’d noticed it coming from the shower—its curtain drawn close. Just then a sudden panic seized me, as if something incredibly hostile stood just behind that flower-decaled curtain. I couldn’t make out any shape behind it, and in that anxious state I didn’t even think that the dogs could be behind it. The sounds I’d heard had been too weird, too...*sonically abnormal,* for them to have been made by dogs. Or so I thought.  

I reached out, against every self-preserving nerve in my body, and grasped the curtain. I thought I had done so as delicately and unnoticeably as possible; but a voice, spoken in the same weird tones as the chirping, then said, “If you do that, if you reveal us, you’ll break the normalcy that’s been established. And then we’ll have to expedite our plans.”  

Full on terror gripped me then; not just because of the strange, almost monstrous voice, but the suggestions of its words, as well. The idea that, upon being seen, it would hasten along some undoubtedly *anti-human* scenario. Trembling, I withdrew my hand from the curtain, and for the second time that night, said “Sorry” to a non-human thing. 

I fled down the stairs, wondering how best to tell my brother that there was an intruder hiding in his shower; but strangely, I found him absent from the living room. He wasn’t in the kitchen, either; and a quick peek through the blinds of the front and patio windows showed both areas empty as well. Seeing as how it was the first location of the night’s weirdness, I was hesitant to check the laundry room, but after mustering up the courage I barged in and found it empty, too. I hadn’t heard the garage open, so he couldn’t have driven away—wouldn’t have, either. Not without telling me.  

Logic then dictated that I call him, but his cellphone was on the couch near mine. He’d left his phone behind. I considered calling *out* to him, shouting his name into the house; but I didn’t want my voice heard by the intruder, even though they were now aware of my presence in the house. I didn’t want them thinking I was doing something that’d make them “expedite their plans.”  

I knew that I should call the police, but something about the voice, the timbre or manner of speech or intonation or *something,* had frightened me more than just a little. I wasn’t just scared or alarmed, I was *unsettled*, in a way I couldn’t consciously acknowledge.  

Unfortunately, my next course of action was decided for me. Before I could come up with a plan, I heard something stomping down the stairs. And when I say stomping, I mean STOMPING; as if the person descending the staircase had eaten cement for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. The stomps shook the house, picture frames on the walls rattled with each step. Deep, icy terror swept through me like a frigid breeze, and I quickly ran to the nearest defensible room: the laundry room.  

Back in here again, I shut the door and scooted a fortuitously full clothes-basket in front of it, and listened as the heavy footfalls reached the landing. There then followed a series of grunts, and sounds not dissimilar to what a huge, monstrous wolf might make when scenting out its prey. Gripping my own chest—for fear of my heart exploding within—I sat and listened, while the source of the strange, bestial sounds stomped around the living room, and then entered the kitchen. A chill ran through my body, and I feared that I’d pass out from the sheer amount of stress upon my heart and nerves.  

Just outside the laundry room, I heard more of the sniffing noises, which were then followed by what sounded like a guttural grunt of triumph—as if the beast had found its prey. The knob to the door turned, and from an almost out-of-body perspective, I “watched” myself scoot against the laundry machine and uncontrollably piss myself.  

But just before the knob could complete its turn and the door be opened, there was another sound; one that was wonderfully, soul-savingly familiar—but whose appearance was also terribly unfortunate.  

It was my brother, calling out to me from the basement.  

*The basement*—I'd forgotten that my brother had a basement. I didn’t have one at my house, and seeing as how I hadn’t gone into one in years, I was thus so accustomed to the idea of a house not having one.  

Scrambling to the door, forgetting all notions of silence, I screamed out for my brother to stay in the basement and lock the door. But my voice, filtered by the laundry door and the distance, must’ve been incomprehensible; because I heard him say, “What? I’m coming up. I found a box of old DVDs we can watch. Sci-Fi horror stuff. You know, from the 70s to 90s.”  

Those were the last words I ever heard my brother say.  

Forgive me if I don’t go into too much detail about what happened next. From my temporarily safe position in the laundry room, I heard a strange, bubbling sound, like thick goop being super-heated; and then a series of grunts, less bass-heavy than before, and then the sounds of nails on the kitchen tiles: small nails, like those of a dog. I heard the measured pitter-patter of a small animal trotting away, and then I heard my brother’s voice—the utterance of a greeting, which was then abruptly cut off and followed by a short, agonized scream, and then gurgling. A moment later, I heard the unmistakable sound of a body rolling down stairs.  

Silence followed, and remained for an intolerable amount of time. I knew my brother was dead, and my terror returned tenfold, because I then also figured out why the voice I heard in the shower had sounded so bizarre to me. The way the words had been pronounced was off; spoken “properly”, but not naturally—like something with an inhuman dental arrangement imitating human speech. 

As if to confirm my unthinkable suspicions, I heard another voice—this one plainly not my brother’s, nor the voice of any human:  

“I was supposed to wear his form. You promised me his body. What am I going to do now?”  

Another voice, the one I’d heard upstairs, then responded:  

“Relax. Fate has brought us another. I hadn’t initially planned on using that one—but seeing as how it's here, unharmed, you may take it. I will take the women when she returns, as planned.”  

A few low barks were issued in response, and the human-tongued portion of the discourse apparently ended. I swooned with bewilderment and terror; had just heard, impossibly, two dogs having a conversation about using my brother’s body as some sort of vessel to inhabit. And not just my brother’s body, but mine as well.  

It was impossible—unimaginable; and yet everything I had heard confirmed it. My brother’s dogs were plainly not dogs, but terrible, abominable *things* capable of human speech and, apparently, monstrous transformations.  

Again, I heard that awful, bubbling and squelching sound; like slime boiling and expanding in some festering mud-pit. And then the rumbling, bestial grunts returned; and I was again compelled to press myself as far away from the door as possible. The sniffing sounds reached the door, but this time the creature making them must’ve been put off by something, because it snorted and spat—or performed some approximation of the action. I realized then that it had smelled and was subsequently sickened by my urine, which must’ve been practically noxious to its hyper-sensitive nostrils.  

Shamelessly, I took off my pants and flung them at the door, making a loud SPLAT sound against its surface. I heard a few more grunts of disgust from the creature on the other side, and then something heavy collided with the door; toppling the clothes basket. Before it could be pushed aside, I pressed my body against the washing machine (not far from the door) and shoved it across the door—barring entry. There were a few more heavy thuds against it, but the door and its makeshift barricade held. 

Luckily, being in a laundry room, there were plenty of available options with which to replace my piss-soaked pants—albeit none that were completely clean. I threw on a pair of my brother’s shorts, and took stock of the materials and tools at my disposal. The usual detergents, dryer sheets, and fabric softeners lined the shelves—none of which I figured would be useful to me. There was an iron, however, and its accompanying board.  

Just when I had plugged in the iron—determined to use it as a make-shift weapon, if need be—a hole was punched in the door; and a sharp-taloned claw swiped the air only inches from my face.  

In a moment of panicked senselessness, I swatted at the claw with the iron, which did little more than anger the abhorrent thing to which it was attached. The claw reached in farther, trailing a thick, unwholesomely elongated limb behind it; one that was undeniably the monstrously warped foreleg of the Corgi. For an instant I was shocked beyond sense, beyond fright, even—I had up to that point just assumed that of the two dogs, the husky was the hulking, wolfish horror.  

A brief glimpse of the demonically transformed corgi snapped me out of my stupefaction, and a *ting* sound alerted me that the iron was nice and hot. Without a shred of dignity or cool-headedness, screaming like a child, even, I slammed the hot iron into the swiping claw and pushed into it with all my might.  

The horror roared, and withdrew its appendage from the door. The huge, unspeakably twisted body then disappeared from view—and I quickly shoved my urine-saturated pants into the hole as a hopeful deterrent against subsequent attacks.  

That was almost an hour ago. I’ve since heard the sounds of the corgi’s gruesome transformation, and I can only assume that it can’t stay within that form for long. I haven’t heard much conversation between it and the husky—they've resorted to barks and yips and occasional noises in some other, weirder tongue that sounds neither human nor animal. The only thing of note that’s happened is that I’ve found a tablet in one of the boxes on the shelf; some old e-reader that has a connection to the house’s Wi-Fi. There’s no dialer, and I can’t access the app store without signing into the owner’s account—my brother’s wife. I can only use the dated web browser.  

The battery on this thing is dying, so I’ll have to wrap this up and see if there’s a way I can contact the authorities directly. But I just wanted to get my story out, as impossible as it sounds; so that people will know. So that those dogs don’t end up in someone else’s home—someone else’s *body—*if I’m not alive to warn the authorities.  

Don’t trust them.

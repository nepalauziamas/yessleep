Hello everyone, my name is Patricia, yes, that Patricia, Jason's girlfriend from u/danielbayer1990's recounting of his disappearance, [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/uf84ai/the_people_in_the_trees/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) and I guess reappearance. I recently received a letter and a GoPro tucked away in my mailbox. The letter told me to watch the video on the GoPro and then to post what happened here, so the world would know the continuation. I'm really not sure who left the note here or where Daniel or Jason are, so I'll give you an update on what the video showed me.

Oh, I read the first part of this, which was absolutely terrifying by the way, and I need to add some things so you know I had nothing to do with Jason's disappearance. He came over after school and all we did was have supper and study. He was here until 11 pm, kissed me goodnight and walked home completely sober. My parents were also asleep at that time, so I am 99 percent sure they had nothing to do with it. I haven’t heard anything from Jason in all these years. Honestly, this is a complete shock, I haven’t even thought of either of them in a long time. So, here is what I saw when I watched it.

The video starts with Daniel staring into the camera and saying; 

“I took all your guys' requests and I’ve come to find out what happened to my friend and to see if there is any humanity left, wish me luck”.

The camera pans to woods, I’m pretty sure he had the GoPro attached to his forehead by the angle it was. He begins walking down the path, scanning the tree lines and looking for anything he might see. About 30 minutes later the camera shuts off. I am guessing he needed to charge it here.

It pops back on and you can tell it has been a few hours by the dimness of the sun. His breathing is rough as he looks over at a huge oak tree. Hung from the branches there seem to be little wood figurines in the shapes of people.

"What the fuck are these?" He lets out.

 A twig snaps somewhere in the distance and he starts looking around, trying to pinpoint where it came from. There is a big shadow in the distance moving through the brush. Daniel takes off veering from the path and running deeper into the woods. 

I think he is being chased by something or someone as he keeps glancing back looking at the trees behind him. All you can hear is the pounding of his feet and his fear-laced breathing. It began to grow darker outside as he started to slow down. Through his gasps he says, 

“I think whatever that was isn’t following me anymore, I packed a tent so I am going to set it up for the night because I can’t keep this up any longer. If anything happens during the night I will turn on the camera, If not I’ll talk to you guys in the morning”.

The camera turns back on as Daniel affixes it back to his head. Light is filtering through the fabric of the tent, looks like nothing must have happened during the night. He unzips the door and begins to step out, looking around he gasps and yells, “Fuck”. In the trees are hundreds of little wooden people. The camera pans following his head as he looks all around, there are literally numerous of these things on each branch. He doesn’t even pack up his tent and supplies as he runs away from there, I hoped towards his car.  

He stumbled and fell, he actually stumbled and fell during his escape. If he felt anything like I did when this happened, extreme fear and panic must have caught hold of him. He says, “fuck”, a few times and looks towards the side. Three figures stand there. I don’t even know how to describe them. Scarred riddled faces, deep black eyes, and something was up with their skin, Daniel said almost translucent in his recounting and I see what he meant. They had these bones sticking out of different parts of their faces, it was completely unnerving. 

Scrambling up, Daniel ran again. It wasn't just his feet I heard running across the forest floor, he looked around, they were following him. Looking forward he spots two more so he changes directions and keeps running. Grunts rang out from behind him as they continued their chase. He gets about 100 metres and there in front of him is another one. 

I had to pause it here because in front of him was a familiar face. If you take away whatever transformation had happened to him, it was Jason. I press play and as soon as I do you can see Jason shaking his head as if to say, why the fuck did you come back. Daniel stopped right in front of him and said; 

“Jason, please I am only here too…”.

A loud crack sounds out and Daniel starts to tumble forward. The camera falls off his head, flipping over showing these creatures circling him. In the trees, little people were hanged, swinging in the breeze. I had to slow it down to see them but they were there. The GoPro landed and stopped squarely looking over at his face. Pain and fear gripped his features and blood poured out of his nose and swollen cracked lip. His head bounced around as if something was happening to his body. I almost shut it off as his raspy breathing slowed and his puffy eyes began to close, but the camera was picked up, and when it flipped around the grisly face of Jason looked into it. You could see the pain for his closest friend in his darkened eyes as the camera shut off.

This was a lot to process, I mulled over if I actually wanted to post this as I wrote it, but it needs to get out there so no one else gets hurt. I’m going to bring the video to the police in case they have any information on what happened so I can write an update before I post this.

Update: Guys, I am a little scared right now. I just came back from the police station, they took my statement and the video but I am pretty sure they don’t believe me and think I made a horror movie. 

As I was coming into my driveway I noticed something twisting, hanging on my tree. I went to go look at it and it is one of those wooden figurines. I’ve ripped it off and threw it into some bushes, but what could this mean? It was not there when I left so I’m hoping, no praying it is just a coincidence.

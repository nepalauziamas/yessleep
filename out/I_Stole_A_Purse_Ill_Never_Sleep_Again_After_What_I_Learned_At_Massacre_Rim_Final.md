K and I drove in silence through the bleak Nevada canyons. The sunset turned the landscape a burnt orange color that reminded me of paintings of hell. For all I knew, maybe that’s where the black worm in my brain was taking me.

*“There’s something you should know before we get to our destination.”* K spoke inside my head suddenly, and I nearly swerved off of the deserted road. *“Remember the agent? The blue-eyed woman who tried to kill you?* I wasn’t likely to forget in a hurry, but there was no need to tell K that. *“There’s a chance–a very small chance, but a chance nonetheless–that her organization has guessed our next move. If that’s the case, there will be a very nasty surprise waiting for us at Massacre Rim.”* 

*Great,* I thought. K replied with the psychic equivalent of a shrug. I kept forgetting that it could read my thoughts. 

“*What’s going to happen when we reach Massacre Rim?”*

*“I’ll reconnect with the Hive…and you…well, you’ll get your body back.”* I couldn’t tell if K was lying or not. It didn’t seem like it, but I couldn’t shake the feeling that there was something that  K wasn’t telling me. 

The road stretched straight ahead for as far as I could see. It was a struggle not to fall asleep. Maybe that’s why my eyes fixated on the broken-down silver BMW on the side of the road. In the glow of the headlights, I saw that the passenger-side door hung wide open. I slowed down.

*“What are you doing?”* K asked.

*“There’s no gas or water for miles. That person might need help.”* I responded.

*“They don’t need help.”*

*“How could* you *possibly know that?”* 

*“If they broke down out here…they’re* beyond *help.”* K forced my foot to press down on the accelerator, and as we sped by the abandoned car I glimpsed the green-glowing eyes of a huge coyote beside it…a coyote that stood on two legs. *“These deserts are the last great empty space in this country. All sorts of things come out here to play…and to hunt.”* K went on, but I wasn’t listening. I was thinking about how easily K had moved my foot against my will. At some point on this endless night-drive, we had passed a tipping point. K now had more control over my body than I did. 

I was so distracted that I forgot how fast I was going. A few hours later, flashing red-and-blue lights appeared in the rearview mirror. With K’s usual warning to *“act natural”* and a terrified lump in my throat, I pulled to the side of the abandoned highway.

What if it was the blue-eyed woman, disguised as a police officer? What if they realized my documents were false?

Only one of the two officers even bothered to leave the cruiser. A sunburned rookie with a ginger flat-top haircut approached my door with a scowl. I handed him my documents. 

“Where you headed to so late at night, sir?” the rookie asked.

*“Camping trip. I’m a big astronomy geek, and I hear the stars are great out here,”* K answered for me. To my surprise, the rookie nodded like it was an answer he heard often. 

I still wasn’t used to the feeling of words that weren’t mine coming out of my mouth, and it must have shown. The officer had been about to let us go…but suddenly he bent down beside the door:

“...Do you have anything you want to tell me, sir?” 

I drummed my finger on the note in my pocket:

*I’m infected by some kind of parasite.*

*It’s in my brain. I think it might be dangerous.*

*Don’t believe anything else I do or say, apart from what’s written in this note.*

THAT would definitely get the officer’s attention. If I didn’t think…if I handed it off before K could react…

I thought about mental institutions. The smell of sterile lab instruments. The woman with ice-blue eyes. 

I moved my hand away.

“Not that I can think of,” I finally replied. After a long look, the rookie handed back my documents, and I silently thanked Thys’ counterfeiter for the incredible job that they’d done. 

It wasn’t long before brown road signs announced that we were entering Massacre Rim WMA. 

It didn’t feel like driving into the Old West. It felt like driving into prehistory.

K directed me down potholed dirt tracks that the car rental company would never have approved of, apparently guided by some sort of internal compass. Soon, we’d left behind even the occasional stray headlights of the highway. 

The desert around us was as dark as the bottom of the sea, and *still* K kept me driving. Sage bushes scraped against the underside of the car. I gripped the wheel with white knuckles as we lurched over crumbling mounds of red rocks and around massive clumps of dry brush. Finally, I felt K push my foot down on the brake.

*“Here.”* 

I didn’t realize how tense I’d been until I stepped out into the cool desert air. Then I looked up and my breath caught in my throat.

I didn’t know there *could be* so many stars. 

They were scattered across the sky like diamond dust, surrounded by clouds of blue and purple that I’d *never* seen in the city. 

I was looking at the milky way.

As I stared in awe, an inky sphere cut across that beautiful vision of space. 

Just looking at it made my head hurt, and I got the feeling that it existed in more than four dimensions. It lowered itself onto the red dirt in front of me, oozing out across the desert like a thick liquid, and only then did I realize what I was looking at.

Beings like K. Billions of them. 

*“You’ve been incredibly helpful.”* K told me. *“We’ve been on several fact-finding missions among your species over the centuries, with inconclusive results. But now, thanks to you, we can confirm that homo Sapiens are selfish enough to guarantee our spread.”* 

“What?!” I gasped. 

*“Not all species make good hosts. Among more individualistic species, the infected usually wander off to die alone, rather than infecting others. In more hierarchical species, the infected warn the authorities about their condition, regardless of the cost to themselves. Think about how you* *reacted to* your infestation. *All* you *wanted was to* live–*and that’s exactly the trait we’re looking for. With the new data I’ve gleaned from your thoughts, I estimate about four weeks before half of the hominid population is infested, and three to five months until complete infestation. You will, indeed, make excellent hosts for the Hive. I suppose we’re just lucky that we found you before you destroyed yourselves.”* 

It was too much. I fell to my knees before the ink pool of squirming wormlike creatures. 

*“Unfortunately, it is now time for us to part. I must share what I’ve learned from you with the Hive. Perhaps we’ll meet again…but it’s statistically unlikely.”* I felt something slithering beside my right eyeball, and K disappeared into the writhing black pool. 

Searchlights zoomed across the desert toward us, mounted on black humvees. I had no doubt that the woman with ice-blue eyes was there, shouting commands into a walkie-talkie. 

I ran. 

Behind me, streams of something like that looked like fireworks and smelled like a chemical factory rocketed toward K and “the Hive,” but I didn’t stick around to see what happened. I had no doubt that if I inhaled that thick white smoke, I’d be hospitalized or worse. 

Alone in the chilly desert night–without signal, water, or shelter–I did my best to follow narrower tracks to larger ones. To my surprise, I soon saw a pair of ordinary-looking headlights making their way cautiously toward me across the jagged desert landscape. *The police cruiser from before.* I figured I should hide, but I didn’t have the energy. Besides, without water or transport, I wouldn’t last long past sunrise. The ginger-headed rookie cautiously rolled down his window.

“You said you was comin’ out here to see the stars and go campin,’ but there wasn’t a telescope or a tent in that shiny rental car of yours.” He glared at me. “We thought that was strange, so I called it in…and then all hell broke loose. If you’re willin’ to tell me exactly what’s goin’ on out here…I might be willin’ to give you a ride into town...with no reports filed”

“We got a deal?” The rookie’s grim-faced partner asked, as he opened the rear door. “We expect full cooperation…and I warn you, it’s a *long* ride.” 

My muscles tensed. I waited for K to step in, to stop me, to take control of my mouth or legs…*nothing.* I was alone inside my own head, and my choices were my own. 

“That’s okay,” I sighed. “It’s a long [story](https://www.reddit.com/r/beardify).”

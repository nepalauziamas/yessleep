Trying to put the riddle of the mice behind me, I undressed, put on an oversized Backstreet Boys t-shirt I used as pajamas, and made the long trek to the bathroom, toothbrush in hand.

In keeping with the rest of the house's decor, the bathroom had an antique feel to it. The brass sink faucet handles squeaked from underuse. There was a free-standing tub with an old shower curtain that was currently closed.

As I brushed my teeth, I examined my reflection in the mirror, critically. I’m not going to lie to you: I was vain. I took an illogical amount of care in my appearance, considering that on a day-to-day basis, I encountered almost nobody. But I wanted to feel normal. So I put on makeup frequently, shaved my legs, picked out clothes from a catalog for Dad to buy me, ran up and down the stairs every day, and ate healthily. If I was going to be a pale, friendless shut-in, then damn it, I was going to be the hottest pale, friendless shut-in.

I spat and rinsed. Then I did something embarrassing: I talked to my own reflection, imagining myself as a celebrity being refused entry to a VIP section.

“I’m sorry, do you know who I am? Do you even *know* who I *am*?”

Lame, I know. Give me a break – I was a 16-year-old girl who never left the house. If anyone had caught me doing that, I would’ve been mortified – which is why it was doubly upsetting when I suddenly felt like I was being watched.

I’d left the bathroom door open. The scant light from within soon faded into a gaping maw of darkness. I absently pulled the hem of my t-shirt a few inches further down my thighs.

“Grandpa?” My voice sounded tremulous and pathetic. I knew instinctively that he was fast asleep at the other end of the house, which, at that moment, felt like miles away.

I turned around slowly and stared at the closed shower curtain. I was filled with a sudden, horrible certainty that there was someone standing behind that curtain. Half of me screamed internally at the other half to run. But that other half, the logical half, knew there was only one thing to be done.

My right arm felt like lead as I reached out and grabbed a handful of curtain. I held my breath. I shut my eyes. And I whipped it open.

I risked opening one eye. There was nobody in the bathtub. Of course there wasn’t.

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

It should come as a surprise to no one that I had trouble sleeping that night. I wasn’t gripped with constant terror or anything. Just vaguely uneasy. Plus I had slept a lot during the day.

I lay on my back with my eyes closed, trying to breathe slowly and evenly, trying to think of nothing but a white, puffy cloud. 

Then, much like in the bathroom an hour or so earlier, I was struck with the feeling that I wasn’t alone. Except this time, the feeling wasn’t threatening. It was reassuring, somehow. I slowly raised my head off the pillow to peek at the foot of the bed, knowing it wouldn’t be empty.

I was right. They were hard to make out, because my room was lit only by whatever rays of moon managed to force their way through my window blind, but two nude women were sitting side by side on the edge of my bed. They were young and beautiful. They sat perfectly still, smiling peacefully at me. Whoever these women were, whether real or figments of my imagination, I knew instinctively that they meant me no harm. But I was still terrified.

I shut my eyes tight. When I opened them, the women were gone. As I knew they would be.  I lay back on my pillow again, eyes wide, breathing heavily, brow furrowed. Was I going nuts?

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

I woke up feeling surprisingly refreshed. After the appearance of the two women, I’d been able to sleep peacefully until the sun rose. I pulled on a pair of track pants and slipped my feet into running shoes. A CD called “Simply the Best Classical Anthems” went into my Discman, its headphones over my ears.  

I wasn’t prepared for how fantastic it felt to run and actually get somewhere. I would run “laps” around the house in Minnesota sometimes, but I still essentially felt like a hamster on a wheel. This place, on the other hand, was huge. So many stairways, hallways, rooms of different sizes. A few seconds into my run and a huge, goofy smile broke out on my face.

It didn’t last. 

Looking back with a quarter-century of hindsight, I can now see all the red flags I willfully ignored. But you have to understand how rare a change of scenery was for me, how much I wanted to be normal, how badly I wanted this all to work.

I  jogged into a random room. Most were entirely empty, some with the odd folding chair or broom. This one was larger than most, and was apparently a storage room for hospital beds. There were about two dozen beds, all mashed together. The sight of them gave me an unpleasant flashback to the last time I’d been hospitalized: when I’d fainted during sixth grade recess and gone into a coma.

I jogged on the spot, putting two fingers on my neck to check my pulse. It was then I noticed that these particular beds had a feature uncommon to the ones at the Mayo Clinic: restraining straps. Two for the arms, two for the legs. I remembered something I once overheard Grandpa saying to Dad about the kind of patients he used to treat: if they weren’t placed here, they likely would be in prison. I shivered involuntarily and got the hell out of that room.

Next, I passed a door that was unusual in that it was closed. So far, the door to every room had been ajar. I tried the knob and discovered it was firmly locked. I made a mental note to ask Grandpa about this one, forbidden room.

When I turned away from the door to resume my run, I saw another damned apparition. This one was a tall, naked First Nations man with long, flowing hair. He just stood there, staring at me, solemn and unmoving. 

I shut my eyes tight. What the hell was going on? For one thing, why were these people naked all of a sudden? Since when had my subconscious been so pervy? Was this a puberty thing?

I opened my eyes, and the man was gone. I didn’t feel like running anymore. I leaned against the wall and smacked my forehead with my palms repeatedly, trying to banish the defect from my brain.

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\* 

I finished up a hot shower. I had expected the water to be lukewarm, the pressure poor, maybe a goopy sludge to come out. But the stream was strong and piping hot, and it felt great. I turned off the water, opened the curtain, and stopped short at what I saw.

Written in the steam on the mirror was a single word: TABBY.

I looked over at the window. Locked from the inside. And besides, I was three stories up.

I looked over at the door. The bolt was slid into the locked position.

As the steam cleared, the word disappeared. And I thought to myself, I could dismiss it as a figment of my imagination. Just like the creepy man in the chair, the two women on my bed, or the man in the hallway. But I was increasingly unconvinced. 

Another voice crept into my head, stating something that’s surely been obvious to anyone reading this, but that I’d been willfully ignoring before I’d even arrived. There was something deeply wrong with this house.

Last two entree here: [Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/xp8u2e/im_a_night_groundskeeper_at_a_golf_course_i_found/) [Part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/xrwbd3/im_a_night_groundskeeper_at_a_golf_course_i_found/)

When I came back to work the next night I’m not ashamed to say that I had a bit of a skip in my step as I went in. I was excited to be back working and making the money that I was. I had been sent a new offer letter from Levin and the figures on there were outstanding. I nearly burst into tears when I signed my name on the virtual document.

I sat down in the same chair like I always did, but somehow it just felt more comfortable. The cushions felt more plush, the back rest felt softer on me, hell I couldn’t even hear the chair squeak anymore when I leaned back.

I reached into the desk to grab the journal, but felt only the hard wood of the drawer. I looked down into it and flashed a light inside and nothing. I pulled the drawer out of the desk and examined the space inside. Still nothing. I was beginning to panic now. How the hell was I gonna get through this without the heads up from the journal?

“Looking for this?” A voice called out from in front of the booth.

I looked through the glass and saw that it was Levin. He held the journal up and was waving it around with a smile.

“Come on man. I need that thing.” I said annoyed.

“You need to keep your wits about you. That's what you need to do. This journal can only help you so much. When it comes to the real word, this is nothing more than ink on paper.” He rounded the corner and opened the door.

He handed me the journal and then to my surprise, he took a seat beside me. He propped his feet up on the desk and leaned back and took out a packet of cigarettes from his shirt pocket and lit one. After taking a long drag and exhaling I realized that he wasn’t smoking a cigarette at all. He looked and tried to pass it to me, but I declined. 

“Look Martin, from here on out things are gonna get a bit more interesting for you. I’m going to need you to learn fast if you're going to continue working with us. This place, as you have seen, isn’t like any other golf course known to man.”

“What, is it haunted or something?” I asked.

“That’d be a fucking understatement. The function of this place causes a divide between our world and another. That divide is like a beacon of sorts to the denizens of that other place. Some are friendly, but most are not.”

“Ahh, so we are like ghost hunters then?”

“I wish, some of these things need to be put in the dirt, but our job is to keep the peace. We’re more like arbiters in a sense. If there’s trouble we try to fix it in the most amicable way possible. Sometimes a little compromise is needed on both ends. That’s where we come in.”

“What about those dead animals you killed last night?” I asked.

“That was the best solution to a mutual problem we’ve been having with one of the resident entities. Those animals were a bad omen and needed to be put down before they spread and became an even bigger issue.” 

“Who was the entity?” I asked.

“I’ll show you. It’s about time you met the boss.”

Levin got up and walked out the door and I followed after him. Just over the water trap by hole 2 was a small bridge leading to a different part of the wood. As we traveled the sparse vegetation became thicker and more dense. I felt like I was being suffocated by branches and twigs and the tall grass scrapped at my shins.

Eventually, we came to a small alcove in the woods that looked to have been cleared away by someone. In that alcove stood a lone tree. Its trunk was massive, double the width of two men. The bark was a deep red almost that of mahogany, but the deep lenticels in the bark were a shade of olive brown. They moved and swayed as if the tree itself were taking deep breaths in and out. There was a wide slit that creased in the center of its trunk. It looked like someone had stripped its bark into a diamond shape.

“Sir, I’ve brought our newest recruit to meet you.” Levin said to the tree. 

I looked at him and squinted. This man was addressing a fucking tree. I thought I was gonna meet the person that signed my checks, not something that’d make a great rocking chair. I was ready to just turn around and leave when I heard a raspy voice call out to me.

“Be not afraid.” 

I looked back at the tree and I had to take a few steps back when I registered what I was looking at. Two eyes had opened above the diamond recess and inside the diamond was a very human mouth. The mouth was as large as the trunk itself. It looked like the thing could have me for dinner with only a single bite. The eyes were tiny in comparison, but they looked just as human. I was at a loss for words.

“I am Gabriel, keeper of the divide. You must be my new hands, I so much have been needing another set.”  He spoke slowly, almost like he had to fight for every word to come out. The eyes looked down on me. It felt like he was judging me with his gaze.

“There is much work to be done, for he arrives once again, to tear into the divide.” Gabriel said.

“W-who?” I managed to muster out.

“The one who sings. I can hear it now. The orchestra of a thousand souls wailing in agony. The song will reach its climax soon. That is why I must employ you.”

“What can I do? I just started.” I said.

“Learn from the ones who came before. They will show you the way. However, he may try and trick you. Do not be deceived. To listen to his sinful tune is to be marked. Then you shall be his, forevermore, and made to sing. I bestow upon you a gift from the divide, a pennant for triumphs to come and ones long past.”

A large branch slowly came down from the tree. On it was a gold watch. The metal shimmered in the moonlight. I could see the familiar gemstones that adorned it also. I took it and put it in my pocket.

“Now go. Learn to be the hands I so desperately need. Heed the words of the past and covet the future with paternal love. I shall be watching.”

With those last words Gabriel reverted back to the still tree he once was. I looked over to Levin, who had taken a seat. He looked somber, almost defeated. He pulled out his watch and rubbed his thumb around the ruby button.

“So maybe a little warning next time? Didn’t expect to meet a damn tree god or whatever out here.” I said.

“He's a bit much when you first meet him huh.” Levin said.

“Well that's an understatement. What's the deal with the watches anyway?” I asked.

“God from the machine.” He stated flatly.

“And that means…” I waved both my hands motioning him to explain further.

“Think of it as a get out of jail free card. You're in a jam, use the watch.”

“How though? Any pointers?” I asked.

“Well, they work differently for everyone. But generally speaking gold is fucked, green is really fucked, and red is oh my fucking god I'm super fucked right now.” Levin laughed at that last part.

“But mileage may vary. Now, let's get back to the booth, you've still gotta job to do.”

We went back to the booth and parted ways for the night. Levin told me to keep doing things as usual. That if any of the denizens needed my help that they would know where to find me. He also told me to be respectful.

So, after meeting a damn tree and being given a magical watch, here I sit. I honestly don’t know what to make of it all. The fear is definitely subsiding though and I actually think it’s being replaced with excitement. Here I am in a whole new reality really and I actually play an important role in it. 

I won’t say that I’m at all ready for what lay ahead or that I wont shit a brick when one of these denizens actually comes knocking. All I know is when they do I’ll try my best. Until then, I've got some reading to do.

The next entree reads as follows:

*After that ordeal with the phone and the letter I decided to leave and stay at a hotel for the time being. My wife asked me about it and I gave her some bullshit excuse, she obviously didn't buy it. I think she suspects I’m cheating on her now and honestly I’d rather that be the case. Regardless of what she may believe I have to keep whatever this is from her and the kids. Even if that means being accused of adultery.*

*I think after all that has happened quitting isn’t going to be a viable option anymore. That thing was in my house. Now I think it’s in me. The only way I can see to get out of all this, or at least get some answers, is to find this woodsman.* 

*So, once 11PM rolled around I got in my car and drove to work. The booth was just as I left it a few nights prior. However, that wasn’t where I’d be carrying out my shift. I walked right past it and into the woods by hole 5. I was armed with two flashlights, one mounted to my head and the other held tightly in my left hand. I also brought a collapsible baton just in case I needed to defend myself.*

*The woods looked foreboding as I eased myself into the thick trees. It felt like the branches and leaves were pulling me in, like they couldn't wait for me to enter their dark depths. I shone my flashlight every which way causing the shadows it cast to jump around springing from one branch to the other. My eyes darting back and forth trying to keep tabs on what I thought may have been lurking within those shadows. I was almost in full panic mode before I decided to just take a knee and close my eyes to try and collect myself. It would do me no good panicking.*

*Yes, I was scared. Yes, I didn’t know where I was going or what I was doing.* 

*I took a breath. I inhaled the cool air of the night and felt as if all the anxiety I had would overflow in my lungs and they’d burst out of my chest. I exhaled and all the anxiety and panic went with it.*

*Yes, I could find my way through these woods. Yes, I will find the woodman. Yes, I can do this.*

*I opened my eyes and found a grassy path now laid before me. The trees on either side were outstretched away from the path, almost as if my very breath blew them aside to make way for me. I had no idea what happened. Had I done that or were these woods playing tricks on me?*

*I saw dim light at the end of the path, it looked to be a good distance away. Not seeing any other options I started heading down the path towards the light.* 

*A soft breeze fell on my back as I started down the path. It felt like the very wind was pushing me from behind, beckoning me further into the unknown. The trees rustled alongside me and I turned my head to get a look into the darkness that lay behind their wooden bodies. I couldn’t see much, however, it wasn’t what lay behind the trees that caught my attention. It was the trees themselves.*

*Instead of the thick brown trunks I was used to seeing, they were now thin and gray. They looked withered and leathery, really worn out. Something about them seemed familiar and not the good kind. The kind of familiar that's accompanied by dread. Like seeing a movie from your childhood that used to give you nightmares and keep you up at night. I couldn’t put my finger on it until I looked up and saw the many glowing eyes staring back at me.*

*My headlamp illuminated the once mysterious creatures and I wish to god they had stayed a mystery. Their heads were far up into the canopy, but I could still clearly see their facial features. Their faces were just as gray and withered as the rest of their bodies. They wore huge grins that stretched across the entirety of their face. Their rough hair swayed from the top of their heads unnaturally. Like gravity was a mere suggestion.*

*They had mouths as black as the spaces between stars, the light emitting from my headlamp was only food for the black abyss they had just under their glowing eyes. It was odd, their eyes were so full of intense light, yet they didn’t illuminate any of the surrounding area.* 

*I stood there for a moment both frozen in terror and unsure what my next move would be. They just watched me. Every one of them had their eyes fixated on me, unmoving like the trees they pretended to be.* 

*I took my eyes off of the creatures and glanced at the light down at the end of the path. It looked a lot brighter now and I could see faint colors of different hues dancing within the warm glow.*

*I decided to just keep moving forward. I definitely wasn’t going to run into the thicket of those tall things on either side of me. So I walked and every once in a while I looked up at the creatures, eyes still fixated on me and still grinning.*

*I kept walking along the path for a bit, but I didn’t seem to be getting any closer to the light. Nonetheless I kept putting one foot in front of the other and trying to keep those tall things out of my mind. I could hear my footsteps hit the grass as I walked along, everything else was quiet.* 

*Thump, Thump, Thump… I walked along.*

*Th-Thump, Th-Thump- Th-Thump…* 

*I could only just hear it, but I was sure. There was someone walking just behind me. Their footsteps, only slightly out of sync with my own. I’m not sure why but something told me not to look back, to just keep on walking. It was as if my primal instinct to survive was telling me whatever was behind me was not to be witnessed.* 

*I looked up and the tall creatures were now looking just behind me and their grins had faded into angry frowns. Whatever it was behind me wasn’t welcome in this part of the woods, I assumed. Yet they still stared silently and unmoving.*

*I don’t think whatever it was behind me had noticed that I realized it was there yet. So I kept walking and decided to change up my stride and hesitate just before putting my foot down. I heard it hesitate too, then stumble trying to regain its footing, until finally failing to do so and falling  down with a huge thud onto the grass. I can’t believe it haha! I just made the fucking thing trip!*

*I let a quick laugh escape my mouth. I looked up and the tall creatures again wore their wide grins. Seems like I wasn’t the only one who found that funny.*

*The comedy was short lived, because a deep guttural roar assaulted my ears from behind. I decided now was a good time to start running. It only took the thing about half a second to catch up to me. I could hear the soft huff of its heavy breathing as we ran down the path and what I thought sounded like hooves closing the distance.* 

*I doubted I would be able to make it to the light in time and even if I did what then. The monster behind me would be upon me light at the end or not so I had to think of another way out of here.* 

*I pulled the baton from my pocket and threw it behind me, not even bothering to expand it. I heard a quick bonk followed by another roar, however the monster didn’t even break stride.*

*Thinking I had absolutely no options left I pulled out the golden watch and pressed the gold button. All of a sudden a huge burst of wind blasted from behind me and swept me off my feet. The tall creatures came from all sides and positioned themselves directly behind me, pushing at my back along with the wind.*

*I could hear the crashing of meat against itself and bones becoming dust as I continued to be thrusted forward. I heard another roar from behind me as more carnage ensued, but soon the sounds became distant.* 

*The wind and creatures brought me directly to the light at the end of the path. They sat me down softly and I realized the light that I had seen was actually a fire. A fire that danced and shimmered with so many different colors, some of which I had never seen. I took a step towards it, but was stopped by a voice.*

*“I wouldn’t get too close. Fire will burn ya kid.”*

*I looked to my left and there sat a lonely looking man, eyes staring deeply into the fire. He wore a huge axe strapped to his back. He turned to look at me and just shook his head.*

*“Welcome to the woods kid. You're in more trouble than you realize.”*

*There’s more to this entry, but I think I heard a tap at my door. So duty calls I guess. I’ll make sure to fill you guys in on the next entree and I guess what happens to me also. Wish me luck.*

For over ten years I’ve served justice from the shadows.  I fight crime behind a mask, wearing a black spandex bodysuit and a cape, fashioned by my loyal butler, Al Franken.  Some people might call that madness.  

I call it…

My job.  And I’m damn good at it.

Every superhero needs an origin story, so I’ll tell you mine, before getting to the real matter at hand.  The two stories are related, and it’s important to see the whole picture to know what’s really happening here in Laughlin.  And to know why it’s so important - not just for us, but for the whole world.  

Everything is at stake.  The Comedian is loose again, and that means we’re all in a lot of trouble.

“We’re here, sir,” Al Franken said from the driver’s seat, his eyes studying me in the rear view mirror.  “Are you sure you want to do this by yourself?  I’m quite certain we could find someone else to tell them the bad news.”

I let out a deep sigh, looking up at the giant factory, billowing black smoke.  

“No.  My father always made himself available at moments like this, and I should do the same.  There’s gonna be a lot of very upset people leaving this factory today.  A lot of people will be out of work.  I’m the one who made the decision, so I’m the one they should be upset with.”

“Very good, sir.  Shall I leave the car running in case we need to make a quick escape?”

“I think that’s wise.”

Opening the car door, I got out of the Rolls Royce and made my way inside.  

I was ushered upstairs by several men in pinstripe suits who rushed to greet me, trying desperately to steer me away from the production floor where they dreaded a surprise inspection by the owner.  This lack of transparency had always bothered me, and was part of the reason why I was having the plant shut down.  It felt like they were hiding something big, and no matter how hard I tried I couldn’t figure out what it was. 

The other problem was the pollution.  It was growing out of control and I was starting to receive significant public pressure to do something about it.  Black smoke billowed from huge smokestacks in vast quantities on a daily basis, and local cancer rates were skyrocketing.  Whatever they were doing in my factory, I wanted no part of it.  

“Mr. Snyder is waiting for you, sir.  Right this way,” the men in suits told me, leading me into the Plant Manager’s office.  

I went inside alone and vulnerable.  My butler in the car outside was my only insurance.  I never thought I needed more than that, until after that day.  

“Mr. Wade, what a pleasant surprise,” the grinning man said from behind his desk, standing up and approaching to shake my hand.  

Behind him were pictures of his youthful days as a standup comic, working with legends in New York.  I had found out that his gangster nickname was “The Comedian” but he didn’t know that I knew that yet.  I’d discovered all about his ties to organized crime through my contacts at the FBI.  

“If we’d known you were coming we would have made arrangements for you!  Can I offer you an espresso?  Some fruit, perhaps?  I don’t have much on hand but I can have someone make a run for us.  What would you like?”

“That’s quite alright, Mr. Snyder,” I said, shaking his hand and sitting down in the chair reserved for visitors.  “I needed to speak with you about something.  Please, have a seat.”

His smile slipped, but only for a second.

“If this is about the emission levels last month, I can assure you, we’re on track for next year.  It will just take some time.”

Mr. Snyder sat down, pulling out a box of cigars and offering me one. 

“Help yourself.  They’re Cubans.  The best.”

He was looking at me as if trying to read my mind, but failing.  His brow furrowed.  

“You’re not here about the emissions, are you?”

“No, I’m not.  Mr. Snyder, I’m sorry to say that I’ve decided to close the factory.  I plan on opening a new facility in the next year which will offer employment for anyone interested, regardless of age or experience, provided they worked here.  I will be paying their salaries in the interim, as well.  But this plant, and your services, will no longer be required.”

He stood up, his face turning red.  

“WHAT!?  You can’t do that!  I…  There’s no call for this, Mr. Wade!  There’s no reason to shut down this plant!  Why?  Simply because of a few tree-huggers who say our smoke is too dirty?  We’re in the business of making money, not pleasing environmentalists!  Your father knew that!”

I remained seated, refusing to take the bait.  

“My father knew you were up to something here.  He told me to be careful of you.  And he told me not to hesitate to shut this plant down if I thought it was necessary.”

“NECESSARY!?  He didn't know what was necessary!  Neither do you!  You’re too rich and stupid to know anything except the contents of your bank account!”

I stood up, realizing this conversation was going nowhere.  

“My decision is final, Mr. Snyder.  I can find my own way out.  Good day.”

I began to walk towards the door when I heard a distinctive click.  There was only one object in the world that could have made that sound, and I raised my hands into the air, realizing it was a pistol being cocked.  

“You’re not going anywhere.  This is MY plant.  Not yours.  We’re gonna keep doing what we’ve been doing, and you’re not going to stop us.”

He hit a button on his desk and the men in pinstripe suits came back in, this time looking less pleasant than before.  They grabbed me roughly by the arms and tied me up, duct taping my mouth closed and putting a black bag over my head.

“Come on, boys.  Let’s show Mr. Wade what his plant is really producing.”

They led me down some secret corridors toward a part of the factory which was hidden from public view.  When they took the bag off my head and I looked around, I didn’t recognize the place.  It had been built secretly, I realized, without my consent.  

A vat of glowing green ooze was below us and its noxious steam rose up to the catwalk where we stood, choking me.  They had put gas masks on and Mr. Snyder had one on his face as well.  

When he spoke through the filter his voice came out sounding muffled and distorted, like a terrible Bane portrayal. 

“Here we are, Mr. Wade.  You wanted to be a part of the solution, well, now’s your chance!  You’ll be a permanent part of the solution - just like your father!  He couldn’t keep his nose out from where it didn’t belong, either.” 

This revelation shocked me, but it made sense in retrospect.  Of course Snyder had killed my father.  No wonder the old man had told me to be careful of him!

If only I had listened…

He shoved me over the railing and I went tumbling down, faster and faster, somersaulting and spinning as I careened down towards the brackish green slime.  The surface of it approached me rapidly like a swimming pool after falling from the highest platform dive imaginable.  

I landed in the middle of the vat of toxic ooze with a sickening impact that rattled my insides.  The liquid hissed and churned, gurgling all around me as it began to let off steam - an unexpected reaction occurring as the substance met my flesh.  Sinking to the bottom, I tried to hold my breath, but found myself gasping in the green liquid.  At first there was terrible, excruciating pain, worse than anything I’d ever experienced.  But then after that I felt nothing.    

I passed out and regained consciousness over and over again, wondering how I could possibly be alive.  Each time I awoke I felt as if something was changing inside of me.  Making me into something different.  Being reborn into something MORE than human.  

*

How I was rescued from that place I’ll never know, and my loyal butler refuses to tell me, but my guess is that someone inside the plant saw my demise and felt guilty.

Regardless, when I awoke I was in the back of the Rolls Royce, wrapped up in a blanket.  Al was driving fast, turning corners too quickly, and making his way towards the hospital.  The giant car squealed around the bends and people on the side of the road stopped to stare at the unusual vehicle as the massive engine roared.  

It took months for me to recover, but when I did I started noticing changes in myself.  As I grew stronger, so did these new abilities.  

Suddenly I could disappear into the shadows with ease, becoming invisible to the naked eye.  

My reflexes and intelligence were heightened.  My strength increased.  My senses became sharper.  My healing was faster.

I realized I was super-human, as a result of my accident with the toxic ooze.  

With the assistance of Al and his wizardry with robotics and advanced technology, we designed gadgets to help me defend myself for a new mission.  

A mission to rid Laughlin of evil men like Snyder, who had killed my father and tried to kill me.  A man who was poisoning the city by continuing his crusade to create that toxic compound his men designed.

We fashioned a costume and a cape that would allow me to glide through the air and a grappling hook gun which could help me escape from tight spots.

We built a car which was bulletproof and fast as hell, outfitted with enough horsepower, nitrous oxide, and advanced electronics to outrun and outmaneuver anyone.  And with firepower on top of that.

Part of me wanted revenge.  To get back at Snyder for the terrible injustices he had committed.  

But I realized I had to be better than that.  

This was about more than just revenge.  It was about bringing peace and security back to the streets of Laughlin - a city terrorized for too long by heinous criminals who hid behind masks.  Gangs and psychopaths had taken over the town, and Snyder was emblematic of a much larger problem.  

The man who tried to kill me disappeared when he found out I was still alive.  I'd discover later on that he tried to open his own factory, but without the resources of Wade Corp. he was unable to run the manufacturing operation his criminal network required.  

That green ooze I fell into was being refined into a chemical which he intended to sell to foreign militaries to make super soldiers.  

But when Snyder tried to create the same chemical at his own plant, there was a terrible accident.  

Everyone died except for Snyder.  He emerged from the burnt out wreckage of the factory more powerful than ever.  

He blamed me instead of himself.  His face was burnt badly in the accident - his lips pulled back from his teeth in a permanent puckered grin.  

The Comedian was born.

A super villain to counter my super hero abilities.  

Of course, I thought to myself, reading the headlines.  Life imitates fiction.  For every Clark Kent, there must be a Lex Luthor.  For every Peter Parker, there has to be a Doctor Octavius.  

There’s probably a closer comparison but I can’t think of it right now.  

Despite all the good I've done for the city of Laughlin over the past ten years, The Comedian has managed to make this city even more depraved and evil than when I began my crusade.  

Maybe the citizens of Laughlin don't deserve justice.  Maybe none of us do.

After he'd been raining havoc on Laughlin for years I finally captured The Comedian.  It was the hardest thing I’ve ever had to do - but I’ll save that story for another day.  

Needless to say, he escaped.  The best criminal masterminds never stay locked up for long, and even the Rackham Asylum couldn’t prevent him from getting out.  

I came home to Wade Manor tonight with the knowledge he had escaped weighing heavily on my mind.  I’d been distracted during the charity fundraiser event I had been attending that evening and I hadn’t been able to focus.  Part of me couldn’t help wondering what mischief The Comedian was planning.  

Of course, I had no idea.  He had been planning this for a long, long time.  

Wade Manor was dark and quiet when I entered, still in my tuxedo.  I had given Al the night off but still expected him to greet me at the door when I entered, as he always did.  

Instead, I was left alone in the echoing foyer of the old mansion.  

“Al?  Are you here?” I called out, feeling uneasy.  

There was no response.  I stood silently in the shadows for a few moments, then spoke again.  

“Snyder.  I know you’re here.  What have you done to Al?”

I should never have left him alone.  He was capable of taking care of himself, sure.  Especially with the advanced security and weapons systems in the mansion.  But not against someone as cunning as The Comedian.  No one was safe against someone like that.  Not even me.  

“Al is doing just fine,” Snyder’s cackling voice said through the intercom beside the main entrance.  “Aren’t you, Al?  Say hi to Mr. Wade!”

“Run, Mr. Wade.  It isn’t sa-” my loyal butler screamed before being abruptly silenced.    

“Now, now, I said to say, ‘hello,’ not to go running your mouth off, you little-”

There was a sound of someone being pistol-whipped and I heard Al cry out in pain again.  

“Leave him out of this!  It’s me you want!”

I had none of the high-tech gadgets my suit afforded.  My belt was in the hideout beneath the manor - if I could only get down there…

With dread clouding my mind, I decided to take action.  Walking deeper into the manor, I went to the library, The Comedian’s laughter and mocking voice following me the whole way.  

He was watching me, which meant he had access to the cameras and likely the whole security system.  And that was very bad news.  

I entered the library and approached the bookcase which hid the secret entrance to my lair.  It looked undisturbed, at least.  That was a good sign.  

Pulling back the fake book on the third shelf from the top, the bookcase and the floor beneath my feet started to spin on a rotor located underneath.  

I needed my equipment - this location was burned either way.  But the fact that I was giving away my secret hideout was not lost on me.  Snyder would likely be headed down this way, and I would have to hurry.  

Running down the stone steps into the cavernous lair beneath the manor, I saw the lights begin to turn on, illuminating my suit and vehicle.  

I put the mask on and then slid my legs one at a time into the tight black spandex bodysuit.  After zipping it closed at the back, it immediately began to itch.

“AHAHAHAHA!  You think I didn’t know about your little secrets, Wade?  I know everything about you!  You think you could hide your identity as Flying Squirrel Man from me!?  We're brothers, Wade.  Toxic ooze brothers!”

Snyder’s voice crackled over the PA system once again.

“Ooooh, does it feel like you’ve got ants in your pants, Wade?  Trust me, it’s gonna get much worse than that!  You ruined my life and now I’m gonna ruin yours!”

The itch on my skin was spreading and growing worse.  It felt like bugs crawling, but then the sensation turned into something more like acid eating through my flesh.  

“AAAAAHHHHH!!!” I screamed, trying to unzip the suit - but it wouldn’t open.  Of course it wouldn’t.  It wasn’t my suit - it was The Comedian’s sick creation that he had swapped for mine.

Nothing down in my hideout would be safe, I was fairly certain of that.  

I ran back up the stone staircase towards the main level of the mansion again, only to hear the Comedian's twisted laughter coming through the intercom once again.  

The entire mansion was suddenly tilting on its axis, the wall paint bleeding like a stabbed animal.  

Whatever my suit contained, it wasn't just meant to make me itch and feel uncomfortable.  There was something else - a drug like LSD which was seeping into my skin.  

I had to get out of it quickly.  But how?  My thoughts were coming fast and disjointed, a tumbling mess of ideas that were beginning to make no sense.  

Unable to tell if the solution my brain came up with was good or completely insane, I decided to just go with it.  

Running over to the fireplace, I grabbed a long match and struck it against the brick, setting the tip alight.  

Then I walked over to a nearby curtain and set it on fire.  

"Ahahaha… uh… What are you doing, Wade? Stop that!"

The Comedian's laughter cut out abruptly.  He hadn't anticipated this.  

The sick bastard was somewhere in the mansion - the fear in his voice had confirmed it.  And now he would be making a run for it.

I proceeded through the hallways of the mansion as things began to blaze in the rooms behind me.  Wade Manor was quickly turning into an inferno as the old wood, books, and tapestries burned fast and hot.

Now he can feel his skin burning like I am, I thought wildly, grabbing the walls for support as I stumbled up the staircase towards the security office on the second floor - an isolated room with access to the camera system.  

I felt like whatever acid was in my suit had burned clean through my epidermis and was now working its way to my subcutaneous tissue.  I could smell fat sizzling like pork ribs at a barbeque.

Terrified and hallucinating, seeing bulging fingers poking out from the walls and faces smiling at me on the ceiling, I finally reached the security office.  

Kicking in the door after several missed attempts, I nearly fell into the room, only to see The Comedian climbing out the window.  Al was tied to a chair, his mouth stuffed full of rags.  His eyes were wide and scared as smoke was now filling the room and flames were starting to lick up through the floorboards beneath us.  

"You win for now, Wade!  But I'll get you next time!  Mark my words!"

The Comedian jumped out the window with an umbrella in hand, using it to glide down to the ground like Mary Poppins.

I managed to untie Al, but that was as far as I got before collapsing into a heap on the floor, gibbering like a maniac and screaming about snakes and faces in the ceiling.

My loyal butler pulled me from the house and cut that wretched psychedelic suit off of me.  The two of us sat out on the front lawn of the house, listening as the sounds of sirens drew closer.  

I threw the fake suit into the blaze and watched it burn up.

As the manor burned down before our eyes, I reflected that it was not the first time Al had saved me, nor would it be the last.  

History repeats itself. 

And sometimes life is just like a comic book.  

At least, mine is [anyways.](https://www.reddit.com/r/JGcreepypastas/comments/raq7ay/all_stories_20212022/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share)

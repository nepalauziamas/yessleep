I've had the same room for over 15 years now. I'm currently 17. I've been sleeping in this room since I was a little baby. Recently I had started to invite boys over and every time they said something about my princess curtains. They complained about how childish my room was. I told my mom about this and she decided we were gonna go roomshopping last week. 

We went to ikea and I bought pretty white wallpaper, white curtains, a new closet and a new and bigger bed. My desk would be fixed in a week or 2 due to money being an issue. 

We took it all home and I put my interior outside of my room. I started to tear off all the old pink wallpaper. When I arrived at the wallpaper behind my closet I got an eerie feeling. The wallpaper had turned yellow. I refused to tore it off because I thought there was a nest of insects behind that wallpaper. My mom said I shouldn't be afraid of my wallpaper and I know it sounds silly, but it genuinely looked disgusting. The pink had completely faded in this circle and the sides had turned green. The middle of the wallpaper was bright yellow. A rotten smell came from it as well.

My mom called up my dad and he decided he wanted to tore the wallpaper off the wall. He grabbed a loose piece at the top and slowly pulled down. As he came closer and closer to the yellow spot his eyes widened. A little bug came crawling out of the space between the wall and the wallpaper. My dad ripped the wallpaper down more slowly revealing a nest of larves that moved around. I had to hold in my puke. It honestly was the most disgusting sight you could ever imagine. I cant believe I had slept with that in my room. 

My dad had to stop and take a deep breath. Then he grabbed the wallpaper and tore the entire thing down in one move. What was under there was honestly heartbreaking.

A dead man was build into my wall. 

I started to throw up as so did my mom. My dad looked at it in shock and immediately grabbed his phone and called the police. The police came to check the dead man out. They told us he had been in my wall for at least 2 weeks now. I was so confused om how he could be in my wall and how I didn't smell it earlier.

I looked over to my mom and she looked at me terrified. "I think someone broke into our house, mom" she started to nod slowly and looked down in horror. My dad still hadn't changed his expression. He still had the same terrified look on his face. 

The police had to take the body out of the wall the next day to identify it. I slept in a hotelroom that night. The next day we came to our house to hand the police officers drinks while they were doing their job and made sure we didn't get in the way. 

I got a notification on my phone and I looked down to see it was an anonymous number that had texted me.  I looked at the text. All it said was "Benjamin Hozier. 57 years old. Build this house in 1989." There was a picture attached to the message. It was my house. A chill send down my spine. I shrug it off thinking it was a friend who pranked me. 

The police was finally able to identify the body. We found out through the news. I looked up from my phone to watch it when I heard our address on the news. The newsreporter said: "A 57 year old man was found dead in a 17 year olds wallpaper. The police was finally able to identify him. The name of the man was Benjamin Hozier, the original builder of the house he was found in." My eyes widened. Benjamin Hozier. How could that number have known that? 

That thought has been racing through my mind for the last 5 days now. A building company came by and they made my wall smooth again and a bug removal service came by to remove the larves. The new wallpaper is hung up my wall now and im going to buy a desk in 4 days. I just got a text from that anonymous number while I was typing it out. It said "Sydney Johnson. 17 years old. Lived in this house for 17 years." And again, a picture of my house is attached.

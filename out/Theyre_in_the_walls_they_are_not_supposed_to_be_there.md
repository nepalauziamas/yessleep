I'm currently writing this at my new house in New York after a successful move into our new home.

It was a particularly cloudy day at school. My friend and I were discussing what we should do after the long day. We had planned to hang out at his house to play the new video game he got. The bell rang and we headed out the school doors in no time. We said goodbye to each other and went our separate ways. I got on the bus, it was the same as always with other high school kids doing what they do in a cramped bus, blasting music on the bus, and talking amongst themselves.

The bus tires screeched to a halt as I looked out the window and saw my parents standing on the front porch. I got off the bus and saw a moving van, I was a little confused and went up to my parents and asked them about it. They told me that we would be moving in a few days and I should start packing my things before it's too late. I got into my house, it looked empty with all of the things in boxes laid out on the living room floor. I went to my room and it was untouched and was the only thing in the house that stood out. I started with my clothes, putting them in boxes with my hoodies in separate boxes. I got done packing with my bed and desk being some of the only things in the room. Before I knew it, it was nightfall and my parents were out getting fast food because we didn't have enough time to cook something. My parents got home and we ate then got ready to go to sleep

I was in my bed staring at my phone as I always did before I go to sleep, I heard a strange clawing noise coming from one of the walls. We didn't own any cats or dogs so I thought it was a bit strange but shrugged it off as normal white noise. I woke up in the middle of the night thirsty. I got up and headed to the kitchen. I got a glass of water, and as I was drinking it I stared at the locked basement door thinking. My attention was quickly pulled to the walls again. I heard it again, but his time it almost sounded like a soft groan, like someone begging to be freed. I ignored it and got back into bed and fell asleep. I woke up the next morning to the sound of my parents fighting. I got up and got ready for school.

It was another normal day, get off the bus, wait for lunch, wait for the bell to ring, and go home. The bus tires screeched to a halt once more and told my friend goodbye. I also pointed out how my parents were always waiting on the front porch for me, he laughed at me as if I was joking and then said goodbye in a giggly voice. I got off the bus wondering what was going on with him today, I greeted my parents at the front porch again like I always do every day after school. Before I went inside my house they stopped me to remind me that we were leaving the next day. I shook my head and headed inside. The day went on, as usual, sitting down on my computer browsing through Reddit like I do every day, and once again before I knew it, it was nightfall.

I got ready to go to sleep again at the usual time I do.

I woke up again but this time, not for water. The groaning got louder and I decided it was time to investigate. But then I remembered. I knew why my friend was laughing at me when I told him my parents always greet me at the door. They've been locked up in the basement since the start of the school year! "How could I forget that?" I asked myself. They must have gotten into the walls again even though I told them not to. I walked to the basement door and unlocked it with the key I had hidden under my mattress. I walked down the steps. Once I got down there I notices the ropes I used to tie them up were on the floor. I looked at the very obvious hole in the wall, I peered in, and there they were. They had gotten stuck trying to get further into the walls. no wonder they were groaning. I got them unstuck and warned them that if they did it again I wouldn't be so nice. I figured that they deserved to be punished a little bit and decided instead of ropes, I would restrain them with chains. I thought to myself for a minute and remembered why I was moving. My friend had been onto me since the first time he came to my house. I was fleeing the state so I didn't have to deal with that. I went back down to the basement and told my parents to have their passports ready because I can't move to New York by myself! I went back upstairs, refreshed knowing they would stop annoying me at night. And this is where I am now. :)

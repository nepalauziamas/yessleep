I had enough groceries to not have to leave the house for at least a week. Both of my hands were full and the shopping bags deprived my fingers of all feeling. Yet, as I walked past the garbage bins outside of my apartment I couldn’t help but stop. Someone was throwing out VHS tapes. 

Someone was throwing out a lot of VHS tapes.

A couple of cardboard boxes with labeled cases sat by the curb but most of the tapes were naked and unlabelled. Like a pyramid of black plastic the tapes towered next to the recyclables. I let the bags of groceries cut into my palms as I wondered who in my complex would be throwing out a lifetime supply of dead tech. Then, with no clear reason in my mind, I scooped up one of the cardboard boxes and went home.

I was still mourning. I needed a distraction. A mystery box full of VHS tapes seemed like a good means of escape. 

Or, perhaps, it was fate. The universe nudged me to pick up that box and by God’s most awful grace I did. 

The dozen or so tapes were a complete scattershot thematically. The content spanned from *The Land Before Time* to peppy workout videos to a recording of *Die Hard* with the profanity cut and the commercial breaks left in. 

I found the strangeness of the collection soothing. 

The past week of my life had felt like there was nothing to the human experience than cradles and graves. Going through that box felt different. Somewhere in that nonsensical grouping of titles I found a sort of cosmic poetry. I wanted to hold on to that distraction.

I had dinner with her parents that night. Her dad’s love for storytelling simmered down into faint interest and her mom drank enough wine to have to lie down, but they seemed to be holding it together. When I asked if they still had a VCR somewhere in the house her dad was confused, but he still managed to dig one out of the attic.

I was too tired to hook up the machine by the time I got home, but the thought of the VHS tapes kept on tugging at me as I lay in bed. After fetching my third glass of water and watching the morning sun creep up the sky I had made the decision. 

I was going to watch and review each of the tapes. I was going to chase that strange feeling of confusion that the box elicited in me and make something in the process. I’d put up the reviews on YouTube and keep a digital tether to the outside world. I’d be keeping myself busy. 

It would be a fun project to keep me occupied.

I made a video review for each of the sixteen tapes that played to a regular audience of seven YouTube subscribers. One of the subscribers was an old classmate of mine from high-school. After the fifth review he called to check up on me. 

Apparently the videos made him concerned about my wellbeing. 

The reviews themselves didn’t do well with the algorithm but they did bring the slightest semblance of rhythm into my existence. On the days that I’d wake up and the empty double bed felt like an ever-expanding sea of space foam the videos gave me something to touch the floor for. The release schedule of my VHS tape reviews quickly became a tether to set up my life around. 

Every Tuesday and Saturday, rain or shine, a new video was due. The promise of doing something even remotely productive twice a week kept me out of bed. I even enjoyed some of the videos. I distinctly remember finding the classic “Yippe-ka-yay motherfucker!” in the original *Die Hard* replaced with “Yippe-ka-yay Mr. Falcon!” in the bootleg TV version. I giggled about that randomly throughout the day for a solid week. But eventually I stopped laughing. 

I ran out of tapes.

I had managed to drag myself through two months of existence but I didn’t know what to do next. The prospect of going back to work, of interacting with the outside world — it was all too much. 

I wasn’t ready yet.

On a Tuesday evening, a couple minutes away from midnight, I posted up a video to my five subscribers asking what I should do with my channel. For three days there was silence. 

Then a single comment came in:

**MaliciousCoyote87:** “Do the egghead thing again.”

It took me a second to figure out what they meant.

*Professor Egghead’s Search for Love* was the sixth video I put up on the channel. The whole review was put together the morning after my drink with my childhood friend. We talked about how life was back in high-school and other tragedies. We parted amicably, but I stayed in the bar much longer than he did. 

The morning after I could barely keep my eyes open. If it wasn’t for the release schedule I might have just stayed in bed and slept off the headache and dread. But it was Saturday. It was Saturday and I didn’t have a video ready so I got out of bed and made myself a cup of coffee and hooked up the VCR and got on with it. The final product launched by around ten PM and I passed out immediately after.

I never watched the final video of that hectic hungover day. I just posted it, went to sleep and then promised myself I would do a better job for Tuesday. It wasn’t until MaliciousCoyote87 left their comment that I actually watched the *egghead* review.

I was visibly hungover. I kept on complaining that the quality of the picture was so bad it gave me a migraine and the video included at least three takes that I thought I had edited out. All that I gathered from the plot was that it revolved around some shrill-voiced scientist looking for love in a bar. I figured that if I was to “*Do the egghead thing again*” I should probably re-watch the tape.

The hangover I felt the day of the original review was one of the worst of my whole party life. I never was one for excessive drinking but one night of throwing myself into the sun was enough to make me swear off the bottle for good. 

For a moment the tape struggled around in the machine. Then, harsh static filled the screen.

A piercing hot iron cut through my usual mental fog. My stomach rose and my heart grew sluggish. Just a couple of seconds of staring into the static made me uncomfortable enough to turn the television off and lie down on the floor. The headache and discomfort in my chest passed pretty quickly but my stomach never really recovered. My throat felt like it was holding down aged roadkill.

Instinctually, I knew that whatever was on that tape wasn’t good for me — my body repulsed at the mere thought of it.

Yet, lying there on the living room floor I found myself feeling self-destructive.

I convinced myself that I was just feeling the symptoms of a phantom hangover from last month, popped some ibuprofen, drank some water and then sat back down in front of the television. For a moment I felt good. That same sense of curiosity and poetic confusion that I felt when I first found the VHS tapes danced around in my chest with zeal. I felt good, yet the moment I turned the television back on all of my optimism was buried beneath an incomprehensible dread.

The unease ran from the roots of my teeth down to the tip of my toes. I found myself squirming on the couch, angling my body away from the television. The migraine was back, my stomach was threatening to empty itself and I was short of breath — staring at that screen made me feel like my body was falling apart. 

Yet I didn’t look away. I sat there in the dark and didn’t look away. It felt like on the other side of all that discomfort there was something waiting for me, like I was suffering for a reason.

I wasn’t completely wrong.

The discomfort could have lasted a minute or an hour, I was in no state to tell, but eventually the nausea started to subside. As my body calmed the static on the television relaxed as well. Little by little an image crawled onto the screen.

We were in a cozy pub with a fireplace. Sitting by the flames, two old men played a game of cards. Off in the corner sat a gaggle of teenagers that were trying to appear sober. At the edge of the bar sat a lone woman in her early thirties wearing a baby blue hoodie and nursing a solitary glass of wine. The burly bartender was lost in his thoughts, cleaning a glass. His movements were mechanical. The whole pub’s movements were mechanical. As the scene dragged on nothing changed, everyone seemed to be stuck in the same ten-ish second pantomime of pub life. The old men would split the cards, then shuffle them, then split them again, the teens kept on swaying and mumbling, the girl in the hoodie kept on taking light sips from her drink and the bartender’s hands didn’t leave the glass he was cleaning. 

Then, the studio audience started to clap. Everyone in the pub froze, as if they could hear applause. The clapping and hooting got louder and louder and when it reached it’s zenith the door to the pub flew open.

‘I AM PROFESSOR EGGHEAD!’ the nightmare screamed as it lumbered towards the bar, ‘BUT TONIGHT I AM NOT A MAN OF SCIENCE! TONIGHT I AM A MAN ON THE PROWL!’

He had the voice of a shrill panicked man but it certainly wasn’t human. Across his egg shaped body the creature wore a filthy lab coat ripped at the seams. On top of the eggman’s head sat a nest of jet-black hair that was strung backwards with thick clumps of yellowing hair wax. His eyes were pink with some horrid disease and filled with absolute madness.

He was looking straight into the camera. 

It felt like Professor Egghead was speaking directly to me.

‘AS IT IS DECREED IN THE SCIENTIST’S CODE FRIDAY NIGHTS ARE NOT TO BE SPENT ON RESEARCH! THEY ARE TO BE FUN AND MERRY!’ The egg-shaped nightmare spun around on its muddy heel and faced the uncomfortable bartender, ‘I HAVE COME HERE TO RELAX MY BRAIN SO THAT I MAY BE RIGHT FOR ANOTHER DAY OF SCIENCE ONCE THE SUN BURNS AWAY THE DARKNESS! POUR ME YOUR FINEST DRINK BARTENDER AND BE QUICK ABOUT IT!’

The coziness had completely fled the pub with Professor Egghead’s arrival. Everyone was staring at the monstrosity. Everyone was visibly terrified of what they were witnessing.

‘Wh…’ the bartender stuttered, ‘What would you like to drink?’

‘I AM NOT AN ALCOHOLIC! I KNOW NOTHING OF THE LIQUOR!’ screamed the egghead, almost defensively. ‘THE ONLY THING I HAVE EVER DRANK IS WATER DISTILLED FROM THE MOST PROFICIENT OF FILTRATION FACILITIES! I WILL TRUST YOUR JUDGMENT IN THIS REGARD, MALE-WENCH — POUR ME YOUR MOST POPULAR ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGE.’

‘So you would like a beer then?’

‘A DRINK WITH YEAST? YEAST!? YEAST IS WHAT GOD CREATED TO TAUNT HIS ENEMIES. NO! I WILL NOT DRINK THAT FILTHY FROTH OF SIN. POUR ME SOMETHING ELSE.’

The suggestion of beer pushed the egghead into a furious tantrum. He stomped his muddy shoes clean and impotently tried to overturn one of the bar stools with his stubby arms. Professor Egghead’s outburst was met with raucous applause from the studio audience but everyone else in the pub was terrified.

‘There’s a drink menu, sir,’ the bartender said, pointing his trembling hand, ‘Maybe you’ll find something there that you’ll like.’

The egghead glared at the poor man for a discomfitingly long time. Then, with effort and strain, the egg shaped creature forced its way to the top of the barstool. The studio audience found his ascent to be the pinnacle of comedy. The rest of the patrons in the pub simply watched on in horror.

His eyes struggled with the menu, but after a couple of crust filled blinks the egghead had his order. ‘I DEMAND THIS SEX ON THE SAND!’

‘Sex on the Beach, you mean?’ the bartender asked, cautiously.

‘DO NOT SCOFF AT ME, SIMPLETON. I WAS SIMPLY BEING MORE SPECIFIC WITH MY NOMENCLATURE! YES. BRING ME THIS ALCOHOLIC JUICE INSPIRED BY SEASIDE COPULATION!’

The teenagers had pressed themselves as far into the corner as they could. One of the girls was crying. The old men were making a poor effort to pretend they were focused on the cards. The woman in the hoodie kept her head low. As the bartender mixed the Sex on the Beach Professor Egghead leant over in his stool to get closer to the bartender. As if he was about to share a secret, the egghead lifted his stubby hand to his massive mouth.

‘I AM NOT HERE ONLY TO EXPERIMENT WITH ALCOHOL,’ the egghead screamed, ‘I HAVE TAKEN A BREAK FROM THE IMPORTANT FIELD OF RESEARCH TO TEST MY SKILLS IN THE GAME OF LOVE. MY MARRIAGE TO THE REALM OF RESEARCH IS NO SECRET, BUT I LONG FOR ANOTHER SOUL TO SHARE MY LIFE WITH. I NEED SOMEONE TO HOLD ME WHEN I RETURN HOME FROM A LONG NIGHT OF ANALYZING DATA. MUCH LIKE A LONELY ATOM I YEARN FOR A BOND!’

The studio audience broke into a sweet field of *awww’s* and laughter. Professor Egghead smiled a smile of razor sharp rot, being visibly pleased with his own wordplay. The bartender registered none of this. He was far too focused on not spilling the drink in his trembling hands.

‘Here you go s-sir, S-Sex on the Beach.’

The egghead’s smile disappeared. It studied the colorful glass in front of it with suspicion. It looked, it sniffed, it looked again and then, without a hint of emotion the creature took a little sip. The looped plastic straw barely touched the egghead’s chapped lips, but the creature’s reaction to the drink was clear.

‘EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!!’

Professor Egghead’s face was caught in a sour grimace. He screamed. He screamed in a high-pitched guttural groan that made the teenage girl hidden in the corner of the pub cry even harder. The whole pub was on the edge of a panic attack. Seizing the chaos, one of the old men dropped his cards, sprung to his feet and made for the exit.

The moment his hand was on the door the egghead ceased his howling. The nightmare spun around on the barstool and faced the old man. The egghead didn’t say anything. He simply stared at the man with unyielding rage.

Wordlessly, the card player sulked back to his seat. 

Professor Egghead looked into the camera. ‘NO ONE ESCAPES THE COMPANY OF PROFESSOR EGGHEAD,’ he hissed, before turning back to the bartender.

‘I DEMAND A GLASS OF WATER.’

‘Of course, sir. S-sorry you did not like your drink.’

The egghead briefly raised the glass to his lips and then threw it — with profound force — at the wall near the teenagers. ‘THIS WATER TASTES LIKE SEWAGE! WHERE DID YOU GET THIS? THE RIVER?! YOU ARE NOT THE ONE I AM LOOKING FOR MALE-WENCH! I COULD NEVER LOVE YOU! YOU ARE A BUFFOON!’

The studio audience laughed.

The egghead turned to the teens. Most of them were crying now, there was shattered glass in their hair. ‘AND I COULD NEVER LOVE ANY OF YOU WELPS EITHER! I AM A MAN OF SCIENCE, NOT A PEDOPHILIAC!’

The studio audience applauded the egghead’s moral stance.

‘AND YOU TWO,’ the egghead said, pointing its stubby fingers towards the old men with cards, ‘YOU ARE NEARLY DEAD. I DO NOT REQUIRE ANOTHER TOMBSTONE TO WEEP AT!’

The studio audience laughed and applauded. 

After a loud and protracted ‘HMMMM’ the egghead began to spin around on his bar stool. He started off slow, but quickly picked up speed. With each rotation of the chair the egghead turned faster and faster. The flames in the fireplace went out. All the patrons stared on at the spinning nightmare in fear. ‘I GUESS THERE IS ONLY ONE MORE HUMAN BEING LEFT HERE,’ the egghead screamed as it slammed its fists into the table. The barstool came to a halt. The egghead’s attention was fully focused on the woman sitting at the end of the bar. ‘DEAR FEMALE, MAY I HAVE YOUR ATTENTION?’

She turned her head, but in the opposite direction. 

‘FEMALE! LOOK AT ME! LOOK ME IN THE EYES AND SEE ME AS AN INDIVIDUAL! CONNECT TO MY SOUL AND FALL IN LOVE WITH ME! LOOK INTO THESE SCIENTIFIC EYES AND LET YOUR BLOOD FILL WITH ENDORPHINS!’

The woman did not turn. With a thud the Egghead hopped off of his stool.

The studio audience did not tolerate the woman’s disinterest. They quickly turned mean. As a wave of *BOOOs* rose from behind the camera she started to visibly shake. Even though it frightened the woman in blue, the anger of the audience seemed to excite the egghead. The louder the jeers from the invisible observers got the harder Professor Egghead stomped. The nightmare’s punishing of the wooden floorboards wasn’t completely random though. As the egg-shaped monstrosity stomped it moved, in a rage filled ballet, towards the lady in the hoodie. With a terrible swiftness Professor Egghead turned around her bar stool and stared up at the terrified woman.

‘I AM THE GREATEST MIND THAT HAS EVER MARCHED THE EARTH! YOU ARE ONLY ALIVE BECAUSE OF MY GLORIOUS INVENTIONS. I SLAVE, EACH DAY AND NIGHT, IN MY LAB TO KEEP HUMANITY BREATHING AND THIS IS MY THANKS? I AM PROFESSOR EGGHEAD AND I DEMAND YOUR ATTENTION!’ 

Spittle, like rancid chewing tobacco, flew from the creature’s teeth and dirtied the blue hoodie. The lone woman stared on in terror at the egghead as the rest of the pub did their best to look away. ‘I DEMAND YOUR ATTENTION!’ the creature raved, climbing up on the barstool, ‘I DEMAND IT! I DEMAND IT! I DEMAND —‘

I turned the television off. 

It was starting to feel like I was standing in that pub, witnessing the nightmare’s terror. I couldn’t bring myself to watch the rest of the tape.

That night a memory snuck into my dreams. 

I was back in a dive in downtown Bratislava, my friends had disappeared and I was going to have one last drink before giving up on my search efforts. The bar was surrounded by people who didn’t comprehend the concept of a queue and there wasn’t nearly enough alcohol in my system to join in on the fray. I took my place at the back of the crowd and hoped that the bartender had a quick hand. 

I occupied myself by eavesdropping on the drunks. It seemed like a major oversight to position the bar right next to the speakers blaring radio hits, yet as I waited I caught bits of attention. Out of the noise a gruff voice rose. It was saying some pretty unflattering stuff.

He was about a head taller than me but liquored enough to a point where it was irrelevant. She looked far from comfortable. 

‘Hey dude, that’s my wife,’ I said. ‘Yeah,’ she said, ‘that’s my husband.’ 

The drunk propped himself up against one of the tables trying to get a clear look at us, for a second he seemed like he was going to ask for a marriage certificate but then he waved his hand and walked off into a waitress carrying drinks. 

Tammy wasn’t currently available for marriage; she was in fact waiting for a Tinder date that was running fifteen minutes late. I offered to wait with her. Once we finished our drinks and twenty minutes passed I suggested another round. 

She suggested another venue.

We were meant to leave the bar and get drunk and fall in love and move in together and be happy until the diagnosis — but my dream diverted from reality. Just as we were about to make our way to the exit, the drunk returned. The drunk returned but his teeth had turned razor sharp, the whiskey on his breath made way for the smell of rot, his whole body had changed shape. 

My hands were seized by stubby, slimy fingers in a painful grip. It felt like my bones were about to crack.

‘NO ONE ESCAPES THE COMPANY OF PROFESSOR EGGHEAD!’

The morning after my wrist felt like I had slammed it in a car door. I spent most of the afternoon trying to figure out if I wanted to stick to making YouTube videos or whether I should let it all go. The idea of interacting with the egghead tape made me feel unwell and the option of finding a new topic to cover felt impossibly difficult. My decision to let go of my hobby wasn’t solidified until I got an e-mail in the evening — my boss was asking me if I was ready to come back to work.

I wasn’t, but I needed something to occupy myself. I immediately messaged him back and said I could be in the office starting next week.

I was given a reason to shave and bathe and wake at a reasonable time, but nothing much changed. The world beyond my skull still seemed faint and untouchable. Everything around me was moving too fast and too slow and nothing carried meaning. I’d go to work, sit behind my computer, come back home and lie in bed until I had to get up again.

The idea of the egghead, of the woman in the blue hoodie, of the mere existence of the VHS tape itself — those thoughts gave me respite whenever I couldn’t bare to think about Tammy anymore. To occupy myself, both at work and at home, I would go on Google searches to find out more about this Professor Egghead. The first five-ish pages of results all pointed towards science websites for kids and the occasional bit of misguided *Sonic The Hedgehog* fan-fiction. The next five pages were even less helpful.

My Google search brought no discoveries but it occupied me. It gave me something to do, some sort of resolution to hope for in the future. I wanted to know more about who had created this egghead creature, about what the intended audience of the tape was. 

Most of all though, I wanted to know who the actress that played the lone woman was.

She looked like Tammy. It was as simple as that. She looked like Tammy and I was desperate and wanted something to hold on to. In daydreams that occupied most of my time that wasn’t spent behind the computer I found myself standing in that pub and talking to the egghead creature. 

The woman in the blue hoodie looked like Tammy and the thought of saving her from the monstrosity was undeniably soothing.

For two weeks I searched the internet for signs of the egghead and dreamed of Tammy, for two weeks my searches brought back nothing but time sustained living. Then, on a Friday evening filled with coffee and dread, I found something peculiar.

A Geocities website from the early 2000s, the title roughly translated to *Pictures That Make Me Laugh*. 

None of the pictures were related to the egghead, the whole site was just one never-ending scroll of wholesome internet content. I was on the 26th page of Google by then. It felt like the computer had simply decided to give me something cute to distract me from my search. A GIF of two Labradors swaying their tails in unison got a smile out of me but I was ready to go back to Googling *Professor Egghead*. 

That’s when I noticed a *blog* link on the website. Out of curiosity, I clicked it.

What I found made me sit up in bed. Smiling at me from the laptop, I saw her — the woman with the baby blue hoodie. The header of the blog was one of those digital camera pictures before we figured out how to remove red-eye. She stood with her hands raised into a V-sign, posing somewhere by the Charle’s Bridge. She looked as if she was about to shoot lasers out of her eyes. Her name was Anna Ottova and she was an actress who had traveled to Prague in the early 2000s in an effort to make it big. After a couple of skimmed paragraphs it became clear that she was struggling to find work.

I found myself slowing down to actually read the entries. Anna wrote extensively about how difficult it was to get steady work or any work at all. Her entries read less like a blog for the public and more like a private diary. Either the dust of the Internet had blown out the comment sections or I was the only one to ever read the blog. I commiserated with her about how difficult it is to keep the flame of hope alive on rough seas. 

Her last entry was short and included a picture. The woman who looked just like Tammy was grinning, victoriously holding up a script.

*“Professor Egghead’s Search for Love”*

She was going to be on a TV show. She said she couldn’t wait to write about her first experience on set the following day. 

She never wrote again.

I spent the next couple of hours frantically researching Anna Ottova on the Internet. I searched for her name in combination to the date of her last entry to see if anyone reported her missing, I searched for other projects she might have worked on, I searched for any other sign of her existence — There was none. All that remained of the woman that looked like Tammy was her sad blog and those smiling pictures.

I went back to the VCR and turned it on. The screen once again filled with that discomforting static but the image cleared much quicker this time. The sudden migraine was still burning behind my eyes and I felt the need to vomit, yet the pain had lost its novelty.

We were back in the cozy pub. The old men were playing cards by the fire, the drunken children were trying to be inconspicuous, the bartender was cleaning his glass and the woman that looked like Tammy sat by the edge of the bar. The applause of the studio audience felt deafeningly loud in my aching head but it quickly became irrelevant. I pulled myself closer to the television and stared at the screen. Right beside the woman that looked like Tammy a shadow flickered. 

A man sat next to her. He was drifting in and out of reality through patches of static. He wore a dirty gray sweatshirt and pajama pants. 

The doors flew open and the egghead stomped into the pub. This time, however, he completely ignored all the patrons. Instead, he looked directly into the camera with an excited grin:

‘NO ONE ESCAPES THE COMPANY OF PROFESSOR EGGHEAD!’

Behind him the figure sharpened into existence.

For a second I could hear the crackle of the fireplace. For a second I was sitting at the cozy pub with the woman who looked like Tammy. The egg-shaped scientist had his back turned towards me, but as my body flickered between my living room and the pub he spun on his heel. 

His filthy crust-filled eyes met with mine. ‘NO ONE ESCAPES THE COMPANY—

I grabbed the remote with the speed of a quickdraw. The applause died the moment the screen turned black. Reality quickly narrowed down to a single stream, but a part of me was still sitting in that bar. 

A part of me is still sitting at that bar.

I’ve spent hours trying to make sense of it all. I’ve walked through the city and drank and smoked and prayed that some sort of reasonable explanation would present itself, but I’ve given up hope. 

Professor Egghead defies understanding.

The technology which has transported me into the tape is incomprehensible but I did not come to this sleepless corner of the internet to get answers. I came here in hopes that baring my pain for the faceless crowd of the internet would dissuade me from doing what I plan to do next. Yet, typing out my story only strengthens my resolve.

I want to go back.

I want to turn on *Professor Egghead’s Search For Love* and go back to Tammy so I won’t be alone. I know it’s mad, but it seems madder to show up to work on Monday. I just want to be with her again. I want to be with her and I know that the woman in the blue hoodie is not her but she’s the next best thing.

I am a broken man and there’s no hope for me now. For a while I wondered whether things would have been any different if I wouldn’t have picked up those VHS tapes, but I probably would have found a different way to self-destruct. This way I at least get to try to help someone. This way I can stand up for Tammy again. 

I am a broken man and there’s no hope for me now, but for you, internet stranger, I have some advice:

If you find a box of VHS tapes, leave it [be](https://www.reddit.com/r/MJLPresents/comments/tkgvgt/the_adventures_of_professor_egghead/).

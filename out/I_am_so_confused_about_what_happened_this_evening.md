 

I had something happen to me a few days ago and I can't seem to find out a good explanation about what could have happened.

So first some information. I'm dutch so I use my bike to go to work. Here in The Netherlands we also have some sort of small stone shed in front of our houses where we put our bikes and gardening stuff. our houses are also designed so that we have a hall when you come into the house where you can hang your coat and there is another door that will lead you to the living room but in my house we have a glass wall so that if you looked that way you could see the front door and anything going on inside the hall. So that being said here is what happened.

So I had a long day of work and I was arriving home on my bike at around 5:30 pm. I still live with my parents since I am a 21-year-old student but they were not home at the time I arrived. I remember putting my bike into the shed in front of my house and locking my bike and the shed since I was the last one to use it that day. My bike key, the shed key and the key to open my front door are all on the same chain. So I first had to get the key out of my bike in order to lock the shed and then lock the shed and I had to bring my key to the front door in order to unlock the front door. So I went inside after locking the shed, I closed the front door and put up my coat and put my keys down in the little box we have inside where all the keys lay. 

I entered the living room and just relaxed for a while looking on my phone. At around 7 pm I started to make dinner in the kitchen and everything still looked normal. After that I ate my dinner at the dinner table. At around 8 pm my mother came home. She walked into the living room and was visibly confused. She asked me: ''Are you okay? Have you been drinking?'' I was also confused by her saying this because I was just eating my dinner and have been drinking for like 4 days. She explained to me that when she arrived at our house the shed door was open, her bike was standing against the wall outside and my own bike was halfway in the door opening of the shed. The front door was wide open and the coats were lying on the ground. But the weirdest thing was my keys were lying below my bike inside the shed. I told her I did not know what was going on and walked outside seeing the scene she just described.

I did not do this myself, I remember closing everything up, putting the bikes inside the shed, locking the bikes, locking the shed, closing the front door, hanging up my coat and putting my key inside of the box in my house. I also have not seen or heard anything inside of the hall or outside. If people entered the hall I would have seen or heard since the glass wall there. But the thing that freaks me out the most is that the key which I needed to get inside were laying inside of the shed. So if I would have placed them there and for to be inside of the house while my mom was entering I had to have taken the keys to open the front door and then walk back to the shed to drop them there and then walk back to the front door and get into the house. Otherwise, I couldn't have entered the house. I also haven't seen the front door opening. It wasn't till my mom came in that I noticed anything happening inside of the hall.

Is there any logical explanation for this that I'm missing? Me and my family are all really confused about this happening and I am really doubting myself since I can't remember doing all this myself.

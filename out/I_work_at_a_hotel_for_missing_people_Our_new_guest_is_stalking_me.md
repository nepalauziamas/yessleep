Well not even two days and I can confirm I do in fact have a crazy stalker, and as you might guess, it’s kind of hard to avoid her given my current occupation and place of residence. Made even harder by the fact that I'm required to treat all guests with hospitality. She has so far requested 5 room service orders of basically nothing so that she may request I bring it up to speak to me, mostly just to gush over my handy work from the other night and go on about how she’s waited her whole life to find a place like this. She’s tried to invite me in for a drink on my most recent delivery to her room, and I was strongly encouraged to join her for one. If this were a job I could do so, I would’ve quickly declined, but like I said, absolute customer satisfaction is our requirement. Basically unless they attempt to do something physical against us, we have to fill our guests' needs to the letter, and trust me, management knows when someone upsets the clientele. I mean it’s not like they’d flay us alive or something if we refuse to fill a request or something, but the disciplinary meeting is far from enjoyable. 

So with that I put on my most polite and enthused face possible, before thanking her for her gracious offer and accepting. Surprisingly enough she didn’t drug it or anything, in fact for a brief moment it felt like I was on a regular date, and we just sat there and talked, talked about normal things. Things like movies, music, hobbies, just an honest conversation. which was somehow the most worrying part. She can laugh, share stories, gossip about people from around the hotel. She can be a normal girl at times…which means she can act normal if need be.  She’s a smart girl, that much was clear. She was patient and articulate with her words, spending a fair amount of time choosing her words carefully to come off as clear as possible. She seems to be rather calculating, however, eventually she’d always return the conversation towards more gruesome subjects…the effect bullet shrapnel has on the human throat seems to be a particular interest of hers.

I just finished another order of towels and on my way back to my own room. As I fumbled with my cartoonishly full key chain, the feeling of being watched slowly creeped up on me. I quickly turned around to, rather unsurprisingly, see Scarlet had been following me. Not in any way trailing from behind while hiding behind walls and shit type of way either, she had been standing in the middle of the hallway about four feet behind me, she wasn’t trying to hide from me, or go unnoticed. She just stood there, watching me. She didn’t speak when we made eye contact, but simply smiled, but it wasn’t her regular twisted smile joined by a pair of crazed eyes. It was a soft, almost sweet one, before giggling and walking off. It creeped the fuck out of me to be honest. Not the being followed part, I was expecting that part. It was that sweet innocent smile of a happy young woman. I couldn’t tell you exactly why it put me so on edge…until I finally found my room key that is.

“Well fuck.” I muttered under my breath giving myself a quick smack to the head as I looked at my room door, the room I had obliviously led my sociopathic stalker right to. I was just so burnt out from work I completely neglected the fact she could watch me after my shift was done. “Alright maybe she doesn’t know it’s your room.” I thought to myself, but that was very very unlikely considering we were on the staff rooms wing of the hotel, and I had been standing in front of my door looking for the key for at least a minute. So with little more than delusional optimism, I let out a sigh and entered my room. It's been a couple of hours since, and she has finally confirmed that she did indeed know where I sleep via a letter under my door, one written in red pen that read the following.

“Dear: kit 

I’d just like to thank you for the company tonight. I enjoyed talking with you, but I’d also like to thank you for showing me how fun this place is. I’ll be honest when we were first brought here I was bored, annoyed that I was gonna have to die chained to a wooden podium surrounded by my sad excuse of a family, but then you came along and gave us a show, along with showing me just how simple and liberating taking a life could be. You had no fear or hesitation, when it needed to be done you just went for it. So when we were offered to finish the job ourselves, I didn’t wanna hesitate either. After that I knew I needed to stay, even if just to see the face of the man who helped let me let go of my hesitation and once I did, I knew we were connected. Those cold and emotionless eyes have something so entrancing about them. The look in them, so threatening yet alluring. Anyways I just wanted to thank you again for everything 

With love: Scarlet”

This letter…it’s had me thinking about a lot, thinking about myself a lot. It's been so long since I've been here I’ve almost completely forgotten how this isn’t a run of the mill 9-5 job, yet I treat it like just that. I’ve never thought to think of how unhinged this place has probably made me. I know I'm not as deranged as she is or the majority of our guests for that matter, and I'm more than confused by what she meant when she said we were connected, but I can’t deny she made some fair points. She was right, I don’t hesitate anymore, no matter how brutal the job I’m given is. I've been working for these people for so long I’ve become completely desensitized to the actual work they make me do. She was right about my lack of emotion. After so long, all the guilt and disgust just died out. Now all of it is no more than a job to me. I think I need to rest for a little bit, just try and unpack all this. Hopefully by the morning I'll be able to think more clearly.

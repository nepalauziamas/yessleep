I have been working with the Denver Park Rangers and police. They’re not
telling me anything. They said that they have the situation under control. I
am not convinced.

Here is my last conversation with Dylan:

9:25 AM

Me: Please tell me you’re calling the police.

Dylan: Hang on, I’m going to see how bad of shape the car is in, and yes
I’m calling them.

Me: Alright let me know ASAP!

11:45 AM
Me: What’s going on?

12:30 PM
Dylan: Will text later. Not safe.

Me: Dylan! Please let me know what’s going on!

2:15PM
Dylan: Alright, I have a second to catch you up. I can call you but I have to keep my voice low. This is so messed up dude.
I don’t know what to do. I don’t want to be here.
Also my iPhone is dying and I’m going to have to switch over to the shitty
flip phone I use for work.

Me: wtf dude, what do you mean by not safe?

Dylan: So I went to try and start my car, to get a quick charge on my iPhone, and see how bad the tires were. The engine wouldn’t even turn over.
The scarecrow was standing right in front of my car, like a foot away. It smelled so bad dude, like rotting meat.
I called the police and told them about the car, and that I was stuck.
They transferred me to the ranger station to explain where I was for
assistance.
That’s when it got weird.

Me: What do you mean?

Dylan: The ranger seemed pretty lax about it at first, like “Where are you?
Stay calm, we’ll send help, just stay where you are, etc.” Monotone voice
like he’s used to it. But then I mentioned the scarecrow… and the ranger
was different…

Me: Different?

Dylan: He became really serious and panicked.

Heres how it went:

Ranger: “Did you say scarecrow?”

Dylan: “yes sir”

Ranger: “I need you to be very clear and very honest, son.
What exactly did it look like?”

Dylan: (I described the one back at camp, wearing my hat)

Ranger: “And you said there is one by your car now?”

Dylan: “Yeah it smells terrible.”

Ranger: “What is this one wearing?”

Dylan: “Nothing. Just burlap and cloth. This one’s face is frowning… Wait…
it looks like something is on its chest.
It has a piece of paper pinned to it.”

Ranger: “Anything else?”

Dylan: “Yeah, something its written on the paper.”

Ranger: “Son, I need you to listen to me very clearly.”

Dylan: “Okay”

Ranger: “I have some bad news. I’m in my truck now, and I was headed
your way. The bridge leading into your trail is partially collapsed and
impassible. We’re not sure how it happened. But we have emergency
crews working on it now.
I need you to start moving this instant. Right now you are at the north side
of the mountain, and I need you to go to the south face. That’s where we’ll
meet.”
“Do you have a compass and map?”

Dylan: "Yes sir."

Ranger: "Good. Alright here is the exact point to meet." (He explained where
to go.)

Ranger: That’s the exact point where I will meet you. DO NOT STAY
WHERE YOU ARE. Get away from your car. Most importantly DO NOT
hang around any of those scarecrows. Do you understand me? If you see
any more, I want you to run as fast as you can away from it. Clear?

Dylan: “I will. Trust me. “

Ranger: “I need you to keep moving.”

Dylan: “Whats going on? Am I in danger? What does the scarecrow have to
do with anything?”

Ranger: "Listen, just keep moving while the sun is up, and make as little
noise as possible. Are you wearing bright clothing?"

Dylan: “Uhhh no I’m not. I have a dark brown coat and grey pants.”

Ranger: “Good. Try and stay out of plain sight as much as possible. Move
quickly, and call me if you see or hear anything unnatural.”

Dylan: “Unnatural?”

Ranger: “You’ll know. But only make phone calls if absolutely necessary.
When night falls, stay warm and hidden. NO FIRES. If you hear anything in
the night, DO NOT RUN. Stay as still and quiet as possible. “

Dylan: “Wait-, will you tell me what I should be looking for?”

Ranger: “Get moving south, NOW!”

Dylan: “Wait…I” (Click)

Dylan: Then he just hung up.

Me: Where are you now?

Dylan: Moving south. There’s creepy stuff going on.

Me: What do you mean?

Dylan: I walked by the spot where my campsite was last night. The
Scarecrow, the one that was wearing my hat, it wasn’t there.

Me: Just gone?

Dylan: Yes. Nothing at all.

Me: Dude I’m so sorry you’re going through this. My eyes are watering just
reading your texts.

Dylan: I hate this man, I just want to be home.

Me: You gotta do what the ranger said, and we'll get you out of there. Do
you have data on your work phone?

Dylan: No, just talk and text.

Me: Great. Plenty of battery?

Dylan: Yes, thank God.

3:03 PM
Dylan: I’m exhausted and scared as hell. Still making my way to the other
trail on the south side to meet the ranger.

Me: Keep moving.

3:44 PM
Dylan: I see the scarecrow! The one from my camp. It’s up in a tree. Wayyy
up in a tree. Dude, fuck how did it get so high up there?

Me: WTF! Send me a pic.

Dylan: I can’t get a good shot. It’s so high up and this camera sucks. Its just
hanging there, it looks like it’s staring at me. I’m so freaked out and tired.
Something is dripping off of it.

Me: Get away from it Dylan!

4:17 PM
Dylan: The sun’s about to set. I’m going to find a place to sleep.

Me: Dylan, you never told me what was on that note. The one that was
pinned to the scarecrow…by the car.

4:32 PM
Dylan: Oh shit, you’re right.

Dylan: It said… “Are you scared yet?”

Me: Who the fuck do you think is doing this?

Me: Dylan?

7:01PM
Me: Dylan? Are you okay?

Me: Text me back when you can. I don’t want to waste your battery.

2:02 AM
Dylan: It’s getting closer.

Me: What is?

2:04 AM
Dylan: fuck…it’s right next to me. Oh God I need help.
Fuck wht si this thing omg omg. Is thiss thingeven human?? It can’t be.

Oh fuck, tht smell. It’s so badd.
I’m going to make a run for it. It’s..it’s too closee.

2:05
Me: Oh fuck! Please tell me you’re okay. What is it!?

Me: Dylan?

2:19 AM
Me: Dylan? I’m going to call the police! Oh shit dude, what happened?

2:49 AM
Me: I called the police. They are looking for you at the south face. Where
the ranger said he would meet you. Please please please tell me you made
it.

2:57 AM
Me: Dylan???

3:33
Dylan: Hello.

Me: Dylan are you okay!? What happened?

3:41
Dylan: Hello.



Me: Dylan???



Dylan: Hello

Dylan: Hello

Dylan: Hello

Me: ?

4:13 AM

Dylan: Are.

Dylan: You.

Dylan: Scared.

Dylan: Yet?



4:14 AM

Me: WTF?

Me: Where the fuck are you, are you okay?


Me: Dylan?

That’s the last I’ve heard from him.

I am working with the authorities now, and they are trying to track Dylan’s phones.

Update:
I just heard back from the police. All they found was another scarecrow. It
was sitting in the driver’s seat of Dylan’s car. It was wearing a dark brown
coat, and grey pants. The scarecrow was filled with meat. They’re not sure
what kind.

The police are having me fly out to Denver now.

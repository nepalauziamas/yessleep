“You think you’re the first? Aha! No, you’re just a... derivative; a secondary attempt. I was the original—the closest thing to perfection. But even I was flawed, so they tried again, half-heartedly. And thus, you and your wretched kind were born. They *settled* for you.”  

The thing was horrendous, a bulbous giant’s head, set within the ruins of some building—some temple; eerily baby-faced, despite its colossal proportions, its taut ivory skin blemished by dust and debris. Two grey eyes the size of basketballs stared at me, rheumy and severe, with its mouth twisted into a smug smile; the thin, colorless lips larger than my arms. The thing had no nose, the space between its eyes and mouth flat and featureless; lacking even the pits of nostrils. It was somehow serene in its ugliness, a visage so fantastically inhuman. And it had, through whatever magic or metaphysical ability it possessed, transported me to its home—to the crumbled, time-forgotten city of Olejnivr.  

I was standing in a long, inordinately broad street, only recognizable as such by the derelict and ruined buildings that lined it; their strange, multi-tiered forms crumbled and sunken and enveloped by shadows despite the omnipresent light of the green sun immediately overhead. The street itself was similarly destroyed, with pits where the crumbled paving had entirely given way, or had maybe been stomped through by some massive bulk. Some of the pits, despite their wide circumferences, looked oddly liked footprints... And at the end of the pockmarked street, resting in a nest of ashen stones and fractured mortar, was the giant’s head, the bodiless colossus.  

When I had originally approached it, it was silent; unmoving, as inanimate as the dead stone beneath it. But upon drawing near enough to make out the fine cracks in its porcelain-like cheeks, the eyes had flicks open, the lips parted, and a faint glimmer of alien life came over it. It then questioned me, asking if I was the one it had called from “The Plebeians World”, and dumbly I had answered that I hadn’t any idea how I’d come to be there; explained how I’d been watching TV in my bedroom one moment, and walking through the green-sunned dead world the next. It had smiled then, and said that the land was called Olejnivr, and that my world, the place from which I’d come, was little more than a creative afterthought; a last-ditch effort to preserve the concept of life in a ruthless universe, even as its truest, most genuine form faded to ash and ruin.... *The implications of its words more than a little troubling to my admittedly human-centric viewpoint on existence.*  

“There’s nothing of value, nothing of purpose left here; only scattered, disembodied souls and thoughtless automata, wardens and servitors without charges, without masters. The forests beyond the capital are cold, haunted, and teeming with perversions of life, corruptions of beauty. None of this land’s sapient inhabitants remain, save for me, and even I am withering as I speak; falling to the merciless ravages time, succumbing to the whittling of the incorrigible wurm. But I do not go quietly, willfully. I have brought you here to act as my shepherd, as my deliverer. You, called from Eyrdah—*Earth,* in your tongue. A fledgling planet compared to this azoic sphere. Through you I will live again, through you I will be freed from life’s loathsome auditor. Death will not strike me from the ledger.”  

His bald scalp pulsed and ebbed, as if there was something beneath, or a great many things, desperate to escape the enclosure of white flesh. Before long, his cheeks started to display the same subdermal activity, and I began backing away, thinking that the freakish head was about to burst. But my retreat was suddenly slowed by a force, a magnetism that lessened the speed of my backpedaling against my will, no matter how hard I struggled against it. The inhuman head laughed, or at least tried to; a dusty cackle escaping the slightly parted lips.  

“Even on the verge of death I still possess more power of thought than you could ever hope to control. I am still ultra-human.”  

With sweat beading on my forehead, and my heart pumping harder than it had ever pumped before, I tried to resist the telekinetic pull; urging my leg muscles to spontaneously strengthen—but it was pointless; the Thing’s power was too great, and after my progress was completed halted, I was slowly and then speedily drawn to it; sliding across the dust-strewn pavement as if reeled along by some invisible wire.  

I stopped just inches away from the face, and up close it was even weirder, even more terrifying; the gigantic proportions eliciting an animal revulsion in me. But I couldn’t even recoil, not physically, held as tight as I was by the awful entity’s mind powers.  

“And now, I emerge to claim my new vessel—you will serve me well, despite your compositional inferiority.”  

And then, horrifically, grotesquely, the thing’s scalp exploded; sending columns of black ichor spraying out onto the white stone, onto *me,* staining everything thickly. It reeked of old foulness, of primordial filth. And before I could even scream from the grossness of the eruption, white cords, like massive, oily snakes shot out of the cephalic crater; whipping with evil animacy in the emerald sunlight.  

This time I screamed, shrieked madly at the impossible emergence, and then, as if hearing my cries, the snake-like things swarmed. Two of them detached from the hellish cranial bouquet, wrapping themselves around my neck and chest, while others seized my arms and legs, binding me tightly in place. Still, others flailed about, occasionally whipping me in their haphazard animation. Meanwhile, the face continued to smile, though the life was plainly gone from it; merely a mask, frozen in perpetual smugness.  

When I thought I’d pass out from the intermittent beating, a new horror dawned from the face-corpse, a surprisingly humanoid—albeit completely armless—figure, coated in the same oily slime, and possessing a translucency of skin that was acutely sickening, given the vascularity and musculature laid bare beneath. This thing, as bald as the head from which it was slowly emerging, raised its face skyward, and I managed to let out of scream even against the throttling tendrils; for the figure’s face was so intolerably appalling, so alien and *evil,* that I had to vocally express my horror.  

I will only say that there was an *abundance* of eyes, and while I’m sure there was some twisted order to their arrangement, I saw only ocular chaos; orbital disarray; an unnecessary and abominable excess of black-eyed sight. Mouth, nose, and even ears seemed joined together in one monstrous orifice, gaping in the center of the nightmarish face. Beneath it all, sickeningly visible through the nigh transparent skin, was its skull, horrifically black as if having been charred for years in the blazing pits of Hell.  

The unspeakable thing seemed to bask in the light and warmth of the brilliant and viridescent sun, taking in the rays as if actually feeding upon them; and then a moment later it was looking at me—its eyes blinking and throbbing excitedly.  

And then it raised itself fully from the head-corpse, and I saw that the tendrils had come *from its body,* that they were its multi-form legs, so-to-speak.  

Using my body as some kind of counter-balance or anchor, it raised itself high in the air, the tendrils tensing and contracting painfully in response. Now towering above me, with a corona of green light behind it, it laughed; and this was not the same breathy whisper of some dying and wizened thing, but the powerful, demonian bellow of an avatar of sin and death. I felt my bindings tighten, even though I was already inflexibly restrained, and then the entity swiftly lowered itself to me, coming to stop level with my face. Horrified beyond sense, I closed my eyes, not wanting to gaze into even one of its own.  

“You needn’t look upon me—you need only accept my embrace.” Its voice was indescribably sinister, the voice of some satanic priest, no longer possessing the familiarly human tone it had held before; its English the only humanly comprehensible thing about it.  

Somehow, my vision became blacker than it already was, and intermittent flashes of light exploded behind my eyelids. I knew then that it was suffocating me, wrenching the life out of my body so that it could invade and inhabit it for its own demonic purposes. I suddenly felt a pressure on my forehead, as if I had been jabbed by a pin, and then a wave of calmness overcame me; a feeling of deep anesthesia. My body relaxed at once, and even the pain of the constriction lessened somewhat. I swooned, deeply drugged by whatever had been injected into my skull—but still kept my eyes closed, for fear of completely losing my mind at the assuredly horrific sight just beyond the barrier of my eyelids.  

My thoughts quickly started to lose cohesion as my mind began collapsing inward, my very being dissipating within. The memories of my life were suddenly recalled and then subsequently dismissed, and I knew that my thoughts and experiences were being read and erased; I was being overtaken on a mental and spiritual level. The pains, trauma, and regrets of life were revisited and reexperienced, and from somewhere amidst the insubstantial murk of our joined minds I heard the thing laugh derisively, mocking my remembered tragedies.  

Part of me wanted to fight, to resist the psychological invader, but another part was already willing to give in; to allow our wholesale destruction. I would’ve given in, too, would've allowed the usurpation of my being, if not for that ever-stubborn animal spirit that resides in all of us. Beneath my humanity, stirred from its dormancy in the depths of my being, rose that feral energy of life native to even the smallest, weakest creatures. **The animus of survival.**  

Panicking, my body flushing with fresh adrenaline, I fought back—hysterically and violently resisting the thing’s mounting occupation. My mind exploded with anger, with animal and human indignation; pushing back against monster’s essence and anesthetic. For a while, we were at a stalemate—its inhuman cognition battling equally against my human one; and then, coming abreast with my will in the metaphysical struggle, a secondary force entered—an aspect of myself I had hoped to forget, to forsake in my new life. *An identity I no longer adher to, from which I had long ago transitioned.*  

“Twice-ensouled? But how? Your pathetic race lacks such complexity of self. A fractured mind? Or a double-minded identity? What could it b-”  

But before it could finish, I overcame its power, and even managed to muster up enough mental strength to overwhelm it; pushing it out of my mind and crashing myself into its own. Like a preternaturally inimical virus my mind flooded its body and began corroding it from within; breaking it down on a cellular level. I wasn’t thinking, not articulately; my thoughts were only of death, corruption, pollution, and under these guiding pretenses they ravaged and ruined the thing.  

A few moments later, the tendrils fell away from me, and the monstrously parasitic body dropped wetly to the ground, dissolving even as it croaked out its last dying words.  

“Ah, I see. How curious—a former identity; rejected, unwanted; called forth once more....”  

I fell to my knees, breathless and dazed, but alive. Before me, illuminated iridescently in the sunlight, bubbled the pool that had once been the otherworldly creature.  

I was inexpressibly tired, having been depleted of both my mental and physical energy in the bizarre struggle, but I knew that I needed to leave “Olejnivr” as soon as possible; sensed the nearing presence of other things, perhaps the discarded, masterless sentinels the entity had mentioned. Drawing from the very last of my reserves, I rose to my feet and stumbled past the simmering pool, stopping at the lifeless facial husk. A sudden idea came to me, and I prayed that it had come from some bit of knowledge leftover from my partial merging with the would-be usurper. Putting my hands on the broad, ashen cheeks, I leaned in and rested my head on the smooth surface where the face’s nose should’ve been, and concentrated.  

There was an immediate reaction. The air around me became hot and staticky, as if charged by a massive current, and my body went rigid. The sun’s green light was quickly blotted out, as was my view of the dilapidated surroundings, and even the massive face itself. I was quickly immersed in total darkness, rendered frozen and senseless. But the abysmal environment lasted only for a moment, and the next I found myself back in my room, surrounded by my perfectly ordinary and intact belongings and furniture. There was nothing of the former environment’s ruin and decay to see.  

The idea, that I could use the lingering psychic energy to transport myself back home, had worked.  

Exhausted beyond measure, I tottered onto my bed, and fell asleep before the thought to shower even entered my mind.  

When I woke the next day—almost twelve hours later—I found my bed deeply stained—even down to the box spring—with the oily substance that had sprayed from the alien head. Feeling a little grossed out but otherwise wonderfully rested, I tossed the soiled sheets into the trash and went to the bathroom to shower. As I stared at myself in the mirror, I gave a small, thankful nod to the old me, the unseen reflection—the person I had been, prior to finding and embracing my true self. Without them—or rather, without the recognition of my transition into a truer me—I’m not sure I would’ve been able to defeat the last resident of Olejnivr.

I grew up in Texas, a small town country girl so to speak, all though I was always more of a stranger in a strange land. Here are a few stories from my childhood. Now as a skeptical person I am looking for a rational explanation for these. Honestly I'm stumped on some of them all though most of these may be either the imagination of an epileptic child prone to horror and nightmares. Here are a few of them as best I can recall. 



 When I was 7 years old I was at my little sister's friend's house (I'll call her Joice) as my sister was always more social than me. Now our mother and Joyce's parents were both big into ghost stories now me and my sister (I'll call her Coffee because that's her favorite drink). Anyway I was the oldest there at the time so me and Coffee got into a fight over what I don't remember we used to fight often so I partly wanting to see a ghost and  partly wanting to separate myself from Coffee went to the "haunted" room it was the room of Joice's younger brother he had apparently seen something there before I hadn't believed him he was 4 years old after all so probably making it up. As soon as I got in there I heard something I don't know what it was but it seemed like it wanted to talk to me and I did. I talked to it while it wasn't mean or evil it was lonely and determined to keep me there. I can hardly recall the exact conversation but I ended up agreeing to something... as I tried to leave I heard some trying to break down the door. 


After a few minutes I learned it was my mother. I wondered why she couldn't have opened the door like a normal person. After a few minutes she explained she couldn't open the door. It was like it was bolted shut. My mother took me home after that and I haven't forgotten this experience. Just one of many  you see I used to think I agreed to let the ghost come home with me as a result strange things kept happening to me.


 Here another one now this was when I was much older 14 years older my epilepsy had returned full force  I just realized I should probably explain what epilepsy is  long story short my brains signals get crossed causing a seizure something that used to happen all too often when I was younger. (noise was my main trigger for those of you that are wondering).  Anyways this next story happened in biology class it was my 6th grade year I was in my special education English class doing a computer program when my arm started to hurt like as if someone took a hammer to it. I knew that meant I was about to have my epilepsy trigger so I asked if everyone could clear the room as I layed down in the dark. I don't know why it helps but it does. As I did I saw him the ghost I mean at this point I hadn't seen him in years but as a laid there on the carpet floor I saw the ghost I spoke to me this time I felt it mocking me as I was about to seize when I did it was the worst one I ever had every part of my body jerked as fast and as hard as ever as it it I felt the ghost just laughing at me mocking me for being so weak and so helpless when I came to my senses I was asleep at home I gathered that my mom got me out when I stopped but I was in a daze so I slept and slept hard.




Well that's it those are my stories what do you girls,guys and nonbinary folks think was it merely the  hallucinations and imagination of a young girl with epilepsy or was it something else a real experience personality I don't know what to think. I think it was the former of the latter but how do you explain the door being shut? Or the fact that I feel like I'm never alone and am allways feel like something is watching me in the shower?

Just the other week, I had a Friday night out with friends that I could barely remember. It wasn’t until after I passed out, that things got a bit unbelievable.

We met up at a cheap local dive, before finishing out happy hour and heading to the sports bar up the road.

This is when things begin to get fuzzy. 

I remember our group breaking off.

Afterwards, it’s only bits and pieces.

I was stumbling around the city before stumbling into a backyard. I remember thinking that the house looked oddly familiar.

To my memory, the house was dark save for a sim light near the front of the building illuminating a room at the back of the property.

The house was quite disheveled and the garden was unkempt but for some unknown reason, I felt comfortable there.

It was around this time, I blacked out entirely.

I awoke in darkness. Sweating profusely and sick to my stomach, I began feeling my way around.

Through what little I could see as my eyes slowly adjusted, I was on lying on a damp mattress. I was in a bedroom, but nothing looked familiar. I noticed the door slightly ajar as faint applause from a late night talk show coming from somewhere in the building.

I sat up only to feel a rush of pain in my head. My stomach churned and I had to hold back vomit.

It took me a moment to collect myself before making my way to the door.

I crept slowly as to not disturb anything around me. I knew this wasn’t where I belonged, but I was sure I didn’t come in here of my own volition.

I slipped out into the hallway as floorboards beneath my feet creaked every so slightly. 

My heart began racing as I stood silent, hoping nothing or no one was disturbed.

I reached the end of the corridor to hear someone snoring in the room beside me. I listened carefully to the sound of heavy breathing just behind the door adjacent to me.

The noise made my skin crawl as the breathing sounded unnatural. I paused in hopes no one would exit the room. 

I continued creeping ever so slowly down the hallway, attempting to hold myself together as my head felt like it was caving in and the breathing sounded like it was still right beside me.

As I rounded the corner of the hallway, I noticed the staircase down.

At the bottom of the staircase was a dim light coming from a television in another room. I could hear the late night host cracking jokes.

As I took my first step down, the wood creaked beneath me and I froze.

I stood on that cramped little staircase for what seemed like an eternity. Every time the show would get silent or the tv would go black, I was sure something would snatch me and that would be the end.

It took so long, but I finally got the courage to go further as I reached the last three steps, I could finally see into the room across from the staircase. 

From here, I could tell it was the house from earlier. Maybe I did end up walking in here by accident. Maybe no one was even the wiser. For all I know, it’s residents are all passed out.

That thought didn’t last for long as I noticed someone sat up in a chair. They had long dark hair and were facing away toward the TV.

I couldn’t put my finger on it, but something seemed so off.

At the time, I couldn’t see the bigger picture. I couldn’t see what was right in front of me.

The centuries old wallpaper was all but peeled away as the exposed wood beneath was destroyed and rotting. The furniture around the figure sitting away from me was covered in mold and all but destroyed. The house was rotting from the inside out. 

This place must have been condemned years ago. How the power is running was beyond me.

It was then I realized where I remembered the house from. It was a local legend based around kids going late at night to explore it and never being seen again.

There was a local report just earlier that day about suspected squatters in the house and upon investigation, they found no sign of anyone having been here.

Just then, the figure turned to me. It’s skin was rotten and grey, it’s nose was missing as bits of flesh hung loosely from its face. It’s piercing white eyes stared into the void of darkness on the staircase where I stood. 

For that brief moment, the light from the television was too dim to illuminate the stairs.

I slowly made my way back up the stairs as this monster continued scanning in the darkness.

It began sniffing as I made my way up the stairs.

I could hear stirring from behind me as I knew they had realized I was roaming the house.

I quickly made my way back into the bedroom, softly shutting the door behind me.

Before I could shut it, the door screeched against its hinges as an unsettling scream came from behind me as the one the bedroom doors swung open. 

With nowhere else to go, I felt that this was the end. I turned to the door to see a much larger monster begun stomping towards the staircase, leaving the door open behind it. I took my chance to make my way into the other room.

I slipped inside, noticing a window to make my escape. It wasn’t until a moment later, the stench hit me harder as I began noticing the flies piling around a solid mound on the floor.

I made my way to the window and began pulling at the wooden frame.

I wrestled to get it open, making little progress. I could hear movement on the staircase making its way back toward the hallway and a door swing open behind me.

I turned to see the door still closed.

I swung back, still wrestling with the window. Just as I get my fingers underneath it, I hear the door fly open behind me and the unsettling wail of a banshee as my spine tingled and my body went cold.

I feel the frame in the window snap, but I finally get it flung open as I turn to see piercing eyes surrounding me as they gain ground.

With no time left, I lift myself out of the window, but before I can jump, my foot slips from under me and I fall two stories. 

The adrenaline is in full effect and I make it to my feet but not before vomiting uncontrollably.

I don’t really remember making it home that night, but I spent the next few days in my house, afraid to leave, sure I would be found and dragged back.

Well I think they have found me. I can’t be entirely sure, but a woman has been following me around at work recently. 

She won’t speak to me and keeps her distance. The night I first saw her was the same night I started having night terrors and seeing the eyes from outside my room.

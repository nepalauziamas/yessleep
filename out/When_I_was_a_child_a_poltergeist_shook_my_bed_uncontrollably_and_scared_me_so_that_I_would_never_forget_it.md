I’ve thought about this ever since I was 6 or 7(am 39 now). But the moment was so terrifying, that it has stuck with me all these years, and replays in my mind so vividly, that I will never forget the moment, play by play.

So when I was little, like I said 6 or 7, I was laying in bed trying to sleep for the longest time, but couldn’t. I remember looking at my digital clock and saw that it was just a little past 3 A.M.. And the way my bedroom was located in my house at the time, I could look through my doorway, through the hall and into our den/TV room, where my dad was watching TV. My whole room was dark, with the exception of the minimal amount of light that was being emitted from the den, where my dad was.

Then all of the sudden, I got the eerie sense that something was wrong or about to happen. I was really scared, so as children do when they’re in bed and are scared, I covered my entire body and head with my sheet. After I did this, I felt as though and sensed that there was a face or a presence right over mine, just on the other side of the sheet. Then, all of the sudden, my bed started to jolt and shake violently, as if there were six or so people underneath, full on kicking the underside of my mattress on all four corners and the center, as if they were on their backs and had a full legs length to do so. All four corners, as well as the center of my bed were being jolted up and back down to the box spring. Again and again the bed was being jolted and shook. I’m sure what was only mere seconds seemed like minutes of my having to endure this conscience nightmare. I just remember looking and seeing my father in the other room and trying to scream, but nothing would come out. Not even a squeak. All I wanted was for him to come in the room, take witness to what was happening and stopping it from happening or scoop me up and take me out of and away from there. But neither would happened. 

And I know I wasn’t dreaming or imagining this, because it went from that happening and continuing to happen, to me physically standing up on my bed whilst this was still going on, to getting a running start on the bed and then land in the hallway. I didn’t want what I could only imagine might be under the bed go get me. I then went straight into our den/tv room where my father was. But all I could do was look and stare into my dark room and know that at some point, I was going to have to go back in there and get into that same bed. I was terrified. 

To this day, I remember this event as if it were yesterday. Never did find out if the house had someone die in it while they lived there. Still makes me wonder about it. In this case, I have to lean towards the supernatural as being what caused my bed to shake, because there were a lot of other things about that house that we’re off putting, in a real creepy ghostly/demonic way. Would never want that to happen to me now. Surprised I’m not in therapy today, from what happened then. Has this ever happened to anyone else??

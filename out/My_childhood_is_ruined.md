I live alone at a house I inherited from my late mother. I never knew my dad but my mom always made sure to fill both roles so to get the house from which I grew up in was great. It was filled to the brim with memories and the other day I found an old camcorder and I delightedly waited until night to watch the contents. I went over to my boyfriend’s house to ask if he was free that night to watch some of the tapes with me. Unfortunately he was busy so I decided that it wouldn’t hurt to watch the first 2 or 3 tapes and play it back when he’s available.

The title of the tapes were the dates it was taken. I put the video to play on the television and sat with a coke and some leftovers. It was around 11pm and I figured I’d watch one video and head to bed. It was tradition for me and mom to watch videos of her when she was younger. In a way, I’m keeping that tradition alive. I watched the tape and it showed me at 5 playing in the living room with a large dollhouse. She set the camera down and it was pointed at both me and my mother playing. Then, in the background, I saw a black curtain. I found that odd as we never had any black curtains for as long as I can remember, I brushed it off however and went to sleep but couldn’t help but feel weirded out.

The next day, after i finished with work I went over to my boyfriend’s again. He was coming over tonight so we can the tapes together. I was very excited and on the car ride over I told him about the curtain and he thought it was odd too but we laughed it off and set our minds to more childhood memories. I went to set up the first tape but it had miraculously disappeared and it being late we didn’t bother to search for it. A little shaken up, we played the next tape. My first halloween, I was dressed as a bee and my mom bid me goodbye at the door as she recorded me leaving. However, just as I was about to walk down the street my mom recorded a glimpse of the same curtain but outside. My boyfriend saw it too and initially shocked, we brushed it off as some halloween costume made with the same fabric and colour and paid no heed to it.

My boyfriend woke me up the next morning in a panic because the halloween tape is now missing. I told him I must’ve moved it and forgot where I put it, I have a tendency for these types of things. He was somewhat relieved by this answer as in he didn’t ask about it again but was visibly spooked. As night arrived we watched the 3rd of 5 tapes, this is where we saw it. The recording was new year eve and my mom was asking about my resolutions for the next year. Then from a distance behind me, there was a woman in all black walking parallel to me and entering the kitchen. She had on a dress, the same material as the curtain. My boyfriend and I were understandably scared and even considered not watching any of the tapes. He said we’d watch the other one and tomorrow night but if anything weird happens, he’ll leave the house.  


*??-??-????*  


We stopped questioning the tapes’ disappearance and was relieved it wasn't there anymore at that point. The next tape had no date and the contents made us sick. It was the house, in the basement to be exact. We heard crying from a child as a lady was screaming and growing closer. The mother burst through the door and the kid cried harder. Screaming, the lady looked at the kid, took whatever blunt object she had and bludgeoned the kid, the crying came to a stop. The lady, who turned out to be the mother, gasped as she realized what she had done. She began crying and howling in pain. We tried taking the tape off but it continued. The lady walked into the light, revealing she had been wearing black and the same fabric as the curtain. I’m crying and begging my boyfriend to take off the tape as he unplugged the television and the VHS player. The mother, in tears, hung herself and the tape ended. We were leaving now and not coming back

As we were gathering our stuff a tape played on its own. The tape played footage of me watching the first tape. My heart sank as my boyfriend grabbed my hand and led me to the car. We got in and left immediately. I am sobbing uncontrollably as my memories are now tainted by this *thing*. My boyfriend is consoling me and saying we should visit the local police station, make a report and leave this town. I sobbingly agreed and we made our way there. On the busy highway I was cleaning my face and using the mirror to see. A light flashed. My heart raced as I saw the lady sitting in the backseat of the car, with a smile.

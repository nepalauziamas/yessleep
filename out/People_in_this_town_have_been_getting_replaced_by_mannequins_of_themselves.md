First, allow me to introduce myself. I am a detective and have worked as one for over 20 years. We see some pretty messed up things but this is unlike anything you’ll ever have heard about before. Legally, obviously I’ve not been allowed to discuss such a case however after a recent retirement I feel like this is something people need to know about.

It all started when I got a phone call about a case involving a missing woman in her 30’s. My buddy at the time who worked at the police station told me that her husband wasn’t making any sense when talking about the situation.

Me being me, I decided I’d go see this man for more clarity on the event even though it wasn’t my case. I approached the door of the man’s house and knocked firmly. I was greeted by a slow opening of the door and a middle-aged man who looked like he hadn’t showered in weeks. I told him that I was there to learn more about the disappearance of his wife.

He took me into his living room and as soon as I stepped in the room I noticed something strange. There was a mannequin of a blonde woman with glasses sitting on his couch. I just ignored this and sat on the single-seated couch adjacent to the mannequin. I didn’t want to be rude.

The man made us both a cup of tea and came and sat right next to the mannequin.

“So, when did your wife go missing?”

“It happened about 4 days ago, I tried to look for her myself and I couldn’t find her anywhere. On the morning she went missing I came downstairs and I saw this mannequin here. It…looks just like her? I don’t understand what’s happening. Where is my wife? How did this get here?”

I looked into the eyes of the mannequin and something felt really off about it. For something that was mostly just plastic it looked extremely human-like. I felt very confused about the situation initially. I thought the man was crazy. The mannequin was perhaps some sort of coping mechanism after losing his wife.

After leaving the man’s house we did all the regular searches in the local area to find his wife but we found nothing.

A few days later another case falls on my lap this time. In this instance a 14-year-old boy is reported missing. I thought this was just another missing person case until I read more about the details of the report.

It stated that on the morning of his disappearance his mother tried to wake him up for school. She entered his room and repeatedly said his name but there was no answer. She could visibly see a lump in the covers so she knew her son was there. When she went over and pulled the covers off her son, she found that a mannequin that looked just like her son was laying in a sleeping position on his bed.

Again, we did all the standard searches and we could not find the 14-year-old boy. The only thing left was this mannequin that appeared in his home. No explanation of how it got there. I checked everything, if there was a break-in, If the mother had spare keys someone might’ve found.

Nothing.

The only thing of notice was the fact that the disappearances took place in the same town.

A week later and things started to become really concerning. What started as a few of these cases had grown into a large number very quickly.

A 72-year-old woman was reported missing by her family. A day later a mannequin that looks just like her was found on a bench of the local park she used to visit frequently.

A 41-year-old man was reported missing by his brother. Later on this same day, it’s found that there is a mannequin that looks like the man located underneath the truck in the garage. This man was a mechanic and was apparently in the process of repairing his brothers truck which had broken down recently.

Most disturbingly, a 6-month-old baby was seemingly replaced by a mannequin in his crib when his parents were asleep.

After a 3 week period, we found that 11 people in the same town had disappeared and were replaced by a mannequin version of themselves. We tried so hard to find anything about these disappearances and we found nothing. Not a single lead. It was genuinely just like 11 people were swapped with a mannequin version of themselves in an instant. While they were going about their everyday lives.

Now here’s where this gets really confusing.

About 3 weeks after people started vanishing and mannequins started appearing I got a call on my work phone. It turned out to be the man from the first case who’s wife was missing. He told me that he put the mannequin in the attic as he couldn’t stand the sight of it. On this night, he went into his kitchen before he was about to sleep to get a glass of water. He entered the room and turned on the lights. When he looked across the kitchen he jumped backwards and fell to the floor.

The man said that the mannequin of his wife that he put in the attic was standing over the kitchen sink. It just stood there utterly lifeless however it’s arms had changed position and it had a cloth in its hands. It looked like the mannequin was about to clean some dishes.

Again, I thought this was strange and downplayed it in my head but then I started to get more phone calls from people that were involved in previous cases.

The mother of the 14-year-old boy did something similar with the mannequin. It was put away in the garage as it reminded her of her missing son which made her extremely depressed. She came home one day and opened the door to her home. The mother screamed as she was greeted by the mannequin of her son standing right behind the front door. Again, the mannequin had seemingly changed its figure. The mother said that when she opened the door, the mannequin of her son was stood in the open hallway pointing directly at the door. Directly at her. She looked into it’s eyes and said that she felt a level of fear she’d never experienced before. It was as though she looked into the eyes of “pure evil” in her words. She ran out the house and went straight to the police.

We checked her home and found the mannequin in the position she claimed it was. All of a sudden it was like these pieces of plastic had minds of their own. Multiple people from previous cases said that the mannequins of their loved ones were moving on their own accord.

One of the people said that they were in the kitchen making dinner alone. They looked up at the open doorway to the living room. To their horror, they saw the tilted head of the mannequin of their sister peering around the doorway. Looking directly at the person making dinner. It was like the mannequin was menacingly watching this individual make their dinner. This made her run out the back door and again call us.

Now this next part will truly horrify some of you so I shall warn you now. Turn away if you are scared easily.

Remember the brother of the mechanic I mentioned earlier. He too found that the mannequin of his brother was moving around their home when he wasn’t looking. It scared him so much that he took the mannequin outside and tried to burn it. Burning plastic isn’t exactly effective however he was able to completely disfigure the mannequin and left it in the garden.

During the night the man awoke in his bedroom and felt something poking against his chest. He reached over to his bed-side light and turned it on. The man yelled and frantically pushed as he ran out of his house with only his pants on.

The man claimed that when he turned on the light, he saw the mannequin of his brother standing over him in his sleep. The mannequin that was previously left in tatters was somehow completely repaired. It had a knife going through its hand and it was holding it against the man’s chest. The scariest thing, was the facial expression of the mannequin. You see, the mannequins all had a tone deaf expression, as you’d expect. When the man turned on the light he said that the mannequin lowered its head and looked directly into his eyes with the knife on his chest. It didn’t have a tone-deaf expression. Instead, it displayed an emotion of anger. Almost like it hated the fact that the brother tried to burn the mannequin and it wanted to take revenge.

A week after these mannequins had been moving around when no one was watching they all disappeared. All of them on what appears to be on the exact same day. They were never seen again.

To this day, I’m left with night terrors about these cases. They told me to keep quiet about this but whats the point anymore. You have no idea how much it hurts to see these people so upset and you essentially can’t do anything. I’ll never be able to shake this feeling off for the rest of my life.

The people who disappeared before the arrival of the mannequins were never found.

I work night shifts at a morgue as a security guard. It’s been this way for 5 years, and I make a decent pay since no one else will work at night where there’s a bunch of dead bodies.   Anyways, I clocked in at 10:30pm and sat down in the room where I can view the cameras if anything looks off.   Now, in the 5 years I’ve been there, I’ve seen my fair share of paranormal activity, but I think anyone would expect that. Glimpses of something running past a camera, weird noises in the rooms that are kept chilled for the corpses like popsicles in the back of a freezer from 2005. It’s never shaken me to the point where I want to quit. If anything, I find it entertaining since I’m trapped there until the sun rises.   On this particular night however, the lingering spirits of the deceased must have been displeased with the guard before me, because things started getting very, very unusual.   I lay back in the squeaky office chair that sounded as if it were to snap in the next second, when the dark shadow of a figure caught my attention.   I sat back up in the chair and rolled towards the monitor to get a better look. The image was grainy and blurred, but it looked as though a 5’5 male had gotten off of the table it once rested on, and just stood there, facing the direction of the camera.   Obviously I had to investigate, otherwise my boss would be on me about why I didn’t bother to do anything. I grabbed my taser for reassurance, since this was a new one.   I made my way down the hall, and stopped at the end when the double doors blocked my way. For once, I was nervous to go inside. I never was, but knowing this was a new occurrence made the hairs on my arms stick up like thorns in a bush.   I pushed them open, and to my horror, the body was no where to be found. I went over to where the corpse once rested and examined the clip board at the end of the table;  Ian Smith, 24, Male,  Death Date:8/3/22  Cause of Death: Undetermined  “Poor kid,” I muttered.   I set it back down gently and turned to leave when I was met with the same figure from before, but blocking the doorway.   This time I got a better view of who Ian Smith really was; He has brownish-blonde hair, muscular build, and brown eyes. However, he had welts and blisters all over his body, and the outline of his skull was visible.   He looked unsatisfied, with a terrifying look in his eye. Suddenly, a wide, painful looking smile appeared on his face, revealing rotting, black teeth.   He started to charge at me.   I ducked and ran towards the door, but a hand suddenly gripped my shoulder. I remembered my taser, and pressed the trigger without hesitation.   An ear piercing shriek erupted from it.   I then slammed the doors and barricaded it with the leg of a chair I broke off. The corpse was rolling and screaming on the other side. I wanted to vomit.   I made my way back to the camera room. I didn’t realize how much energy the incident took out of me, so I stopped by the vending machine and got a Redbull. I sipped it slowly, but something about it was off.   Stupidly, I downed it before I decided to look through the can. That’s when my blood ran cold. There were maggots squirming around in the can. I threw up on the floor.   My head started spinning, when I looked back at the camera to see that the screaming corpse was gone and the doors had been bashed open.   The door behind me creaked open.   I spun around to see my biggest fear come true. The dead body was towering over with that same creepy smile it hung. It smelled horrible.   The last thing I remember is it jumping onto me at such a speed before I blacked out. I woke up with my boss and 2 police officers around me.   When I came back to my senses, I was questioned. Apparently, I blacked out after I “hallucinated” seeing a corpse come back to life. However when I went to show them the body, it was gone.   I’ve been at a hospital for a week now, as they believe there was a carbon monoxide leak which caused me to run around and hallucinate, but I know for a fact what I saw was real. I know because I have claw marks on my back. They brushed it off saying I ran into the ventilation a little too hard. They’re lying in order to cover up whatever happened that night.

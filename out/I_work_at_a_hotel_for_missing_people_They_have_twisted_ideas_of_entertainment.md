You know what sucks? Working at a 5 star hotel made to house almost exclusively society's biggest snobs. you know what really sucks? Working at a 5 star hotel made to house almost exclusively society's biggest snobs that Ironically enough, need to be hidden from society. either to protect themselves or the public hey’re being kept from. This mainly includes murderers, former mobsters who blew a couple whistles, wall street suits hiding from the fedz or lone sharks, criminals on the run from well…the fedz, mentally unhinged psychopaths that hail from high ranking families of the Elite class who don’t want to ruin their prestigious title and can’t let the public know these violent nut jobs loonier than daffy duck exist, the list goes on

Honestly we should make this place a cantina, because the majority of our clientele belong at Mos Eisley spaceport, where you will never find a more wretched hive of scum and villainy. Wow alright that was nerdy as shit anyways my point is most of the people who stay here are scumbags. Don’t get me wrong there are guests that are fine enough and have reasons to be here they didn’t bring upon themselves, but these guests are rare, or at least I don’t get too many calls from them. I’m sure you could guess we aren’t exactly easy to find. an unmarked unknown island…I think, located…somewhere in one of the oceans on earth. To be honest I have no clue, I was told I got the job, was told to meet my new boss, next thing I know I’m waking up on a rather nice boat to a staff meeting a welcoming committee informing us on what our actual jobs will be here. It's like straight up squid game shit.

Speaking of which, many of these guests very much enjoyed watching things like that. Hey like I said, rich evil scumbags. The most recent of which has just ended a couple hours ago and, well it was pretty fucking brutal, and on top of that, has brought an unhinged overly friendly murderer upon me. You may have noticed I didn’t exactly say what I do here . That’s because I'm a jack of all trades here, not willingly mind you, these assholes just didn’t wanna hire too many people to have to pay with money from the billions of dollars flowing out of their asses, so all of us run the works. Room service, cleaning, security…janitorial duties, and worst of all, providing entertainment.

Now we don’t participate in the activities…most of the time, no we are the ones who have to plan and set up. At first plenty of people objected to participating anyway but well…budget isn’t the only reason our numbers are so low. So after a few blown open skulls we got quickly used to being the party planning committee. It’s pretty simple really, they give us a theme and have to give the guest a fun time. This ranges from games to shows, and as I'm sure you could guess these activities are often violent and involve ending the lives of the “pesants” as they say. After a while we grew kind of numb to it all, or snapped and got real into it. Specifically this guy Ralph, let’s just say he tends to do all the work, and is often the reason for our involvement in his plans. Last night's theme, game shows. Ralph quickly suggested family feud, to which our managers were all too willing to agree to. Normally I go pretty unfazed by it all, at the very least not until the end when clean ups required, but hearing him say “Family” made my stomach churn. See like I said, Ralph is a fucked up dude, and any time he suggested anything family related, he always ment big family’s…New families.

This time it involved two families of five up against each other in a game of trivia. Unlike the classic late night game show granny watches, these trivia questions involved tearing the families apart before putting them six feet under. You see, we have a very, very large reach over the world, we know more about most people than they know themselves, so it’s quite easy for us to pin them against each other using their biggest shames and darkest secrets with troves of evidence. He,  as you could guess, picked two families that were absolutely fucked. One was the stereotypical white trash trailer park template who were already at each other's necks 24/7. The other looked and played life as the suburban american dream sitcom family. However this sitcom family were planting more knives into eachothers backs then julius Cesar’s assassination behind closed doors.

The two families would be faced across from one another standing at large podiums behind large bulletproof glass panels, with a large movie screen in between them. next to it a small pinwheel with the players names, and a smaller wheel in the middle listing the categories of trivia. If they are able to answer all the questions, the remaining contestants would be sent home with a fair sum of money. Ralph naturally took the role of the charismatic host. We had two others on security, I mean not like the contestants were going anywhere with those steel cuffs chained to their podiums. We had one controlling the buzzer, and one acting as the gun…me. Now this isn’t the first time Ralph’s made me the executor,, but this time I feel he was out to traumatize me. You see those glass panels had small opening windows set to line up with the contestants' throats. Just large enough to fit the barrel of a custom 22mm revolver made to fire rounds modified into hollow points, designed to guarantee not just death, but a slow one. Thank god we wore masks, just the thought of them looking me straight in the eyes as I…Well I don’t think I need to go into detail about what happened during the game.

This sickest part however, was that Ralph gave me some help. I mean he didn’t assist me in firing any guns, no threat wasn’t fun enough for the guests. By the end of the game five people remained. Three from the suburban family, the alcoholic father, the adulterous mother, and the sociopathic daughter who seemed almost flattered when I pulled the trigger on her siblings. From the trailer park family, a set of teen  twin boys . Ralph had apparently installed a larger window into the glass overnight. One much closer to the size of door, to which Ralph entered to release their cuffs and supplying them with a small cache of various blades, fire arms, and blunt objects, before telling them all that if they killed the remaining family member(s) , they may return home with all the money the family would’ve made collectively. If they refuse they must find the key to the door Ralph had walked through. A key that didn’t exist.

The young twins came to this realization after some time, and decided to go out together, Something even most of the sick soulless fucks who pay to watch this stuff had to look away from. The other family fell much quicker however. While the parents were deciding whether or not they wanted to rip each other's throats out, their little sweet “all american girl” daughter had no hesitation seizing the opportunity to completely brutalize her mom and dad with every tool at her disposal, something the guests found quite entertaining. To the point they gave her a standing ovation, as well as raising her reward pool to nearly 10 million USD…10 million dollars that she turned down, and instead requested something nobody’s ever done. Rather than taking the money IN CASH, she asked all of it to go to her accommodations for her stay out of our hotel. While everyone was taken aback by this at first, they certainly were not opposed to it, well all but the regular staff that is. The rest of our guests welcomed her with open arms, and the big suits were just happy they didn’t need to break out 10 mil worth of bills, or spend any of them on the trip to bring her back home.

The absolute most disturbing part was when we had finished cleaning up the entertainment room and were able to remove our masks. I did so to turn around and see the girl sitting where the spectators sat hours ago. The moment I met her eyes, The coldest chill ran down my spine, freezing my blood. The moment we made eye contact her face turned into one I'd describe as…deranged admiration, or maybe idealization. It was as if she sat there for hours waiting, just to see the face of the dude who off’d half her family, like some sort of fan girl. It wasn’t long after I ran into her again while manning the front desk when I heard a soft ding from the bell. I looked up to see her once more, however this time around would have absolutely no clue she had just murdered her parents. She presented herself with grace and calmness, I’d even say she looked beautiful, but those eyes still had a gleam of that crazed admiration, as if she were trying to hide it.

She introduced herself as Scarlet, rather sheepishly and timidly for a girl who just caved mom and dad's skulls in, might I add. She thanked me for the entertainment, before asking my name. I was very reluctant to do so, but company policy requires all guests to know the staff, and it’s not exactly a huge group to memorize.

“uhh, it’s Kit…” I said, and once I did that crazed look came back in full swing. Only for a few moments, but all too noticeable. She left the desk not long after that thanking me for the chat before making her way to her room. The whole walk down the hallway she whistled this soft tune. It sounded ominous and unsettling, yet at the same had a soft comfort to it, I mean until I remembered who it was coming from.

To be honest she’s kind of the whole reason I'm starting this little blog. I'm worried, and almost certain she’s going to, if not already started stalking me, and giving her my name felt like inviting a vampire into your home, and if something happens to me, well I don’t know, guess I just wanna make sure I leave some final words behind. I don’t think she’s gonna kill me, I’ve been around these vial fucks for long enough to know the look of some twisted person itching to see death. No I can see obsession in her eyes, but I can’t see what she plans to do with it…and quite frankly that scares the shit out of me

For most people, prom is either a nightmare of trying to find a date and feeling the most unpopular you’ve ever felt, or a beautiful night you’ll never forget surrounded by people that for whatever reason decided you’re one of the most important people in school. For me, it was the latter. I’d always been popular. My mother said it was my looks and sassy charm, and my father said it was because I had an alluring aura. Whether the reason was my long auburn hair, dimples, and deep brown eyes, or my talkative and friendly personality, simply didn’t matter. What mattered was everyone knew who Marcy Winters was. She had countless friends, a loyal boyfriend, and a perfect life. She was invited to every party, got some of the best grades, and was complimented daily. 

Prom was going to be her night. Her parents had bought her the Jovani 3110 blue ballgown and she had her makeup, hair, and nails all picked out. She treated it like it was her wedding day, as if all eyes would be on her, and paparazzi would be following her every move. Marcy Winters was the most popular girl in school and prom was going to be the best night of her life. So what happened to her? What happened to me?

“Be good!” my dad shouted from the doorway as I climbed into the limo my parents and friends’ parents had hired.

“If you can’t be good, be careful!” my mom added, smirking. 

We yelled ‘I love you’s and the limo door slammed shut. If only we’d known it’d be the last time we’d get to say those words.

The drive to school was almost as fun as the night itself. Selena’s mom was one of those ‘I did it at your age so I can’t say no’ moms and had given her a flask of vodka for us all to take ‘sips’ from before we went inside. Danny looked even more handsome than the day we’d met in English class four years ago and I don’t think I’d ever seen my friends so dolled up. Of course, we all complimented each other’s outfits and took some selfies before we arrived. If I could, I’d make that car journey last forever. I’d stop us from ever arriving at prom.

The pictures we took there were all beautiful, too. We’d never seen the school look so glamorous and were thrilled to dance, talk, and have fun. Another thing we all looked forward to was finding out who’d be prom king and queen. Up until 9pm, everything had gone the way prom should go. Up until 9pm, when I got a call from my mom. 

I stepped outside alone, telling my friends I wouldn’t be long, and walking to the bushes away from all the noise to answer the call. 

“Hello?” I half-shouted into the phone to hear myself better over the music and conversation.

The response I got was different than what I’d expected. Usually my mom sounded a little stressed and distracted, since she always decided that the best time to clear up around the house was when she made a phone call. This time, though, she sounded very calm. Her voice was sickly sweet and something about it sounded off.

“Hello, sweetie. How long will you be? There’s a dinner waiting for you.”

“Mom, I told you I’m staying at Selena’s house tonight,” I replied, confused and a little scared, “we all are - me, Lily, Clara, and Evie, remember?”

“Oh, I don’t think that’s such a good idea. Why don’t you come home? Mommy misses you.”

I knew then that I wasn’t talking to my mother. Her plans for the evening were to have a ‘date night’ at home with my dad; order takeout, watch a movie, I don’t wanna know what else. They’d sent my brother and sister to stay at my aunt’s house for that exact reason. She wouldn’t be telling me to come home, especially not without a reason.

“I’ll see,” I said, trying to hide the slight fear in my voice. “Love you, bye.”

I hung up the phone before she could say anything else, then put it on silent. Just as I was about to turn around and go back inside, I heard a noise from the bushes. Not a rustling sound or an animal - someone talking. I glanced around and realised no one else was outside anymore. It was just me. Just me and whatever was saying my name. 

“Marcyyyy,” the grainy, low growl whispered. “Marcyyyy.”

I tried to run. I tried to tell whoever it was to quit it. But my feet wouldn’t move. My voice wouldn’t work. I felt trapped. All I could think was *what the fuck is going on?* and *am I going to die?*

My phone rang again. This time it was my dad. Despite every part of me telling me not to answer, my hand raised to my ear and pressed the green button.

“Hello, dear, why don’t you come home? It’s cold outside. You must be freezing,” he said in that same sickly sweet voice my mother had spoken in. How did he know I was outside? 

All I managed to say was, “Uh- um-“ before I heard my mom speak.

“Come on, honey, don’t you miss us? You can have fun with your friends anytime, just come home. Please?”

The bushes rustled. My feet still wouldn’t move. 

“Sweetie, won’t you come home to us?” my dad asked, this time a slight hint of frustration in his voice.

It was then I heard something in the background on the other end of the phone. It sounded like someone was crying. It was a muffled cry, a scared, pained cry. 

The bushes rustled once more and again that grainy voice said my name.

The imitation of my mother’s voice spoke again, “Ignore the bushes, honey, just come home to us.”

I finally managed to hang up the phone. Whatever was going on, I couldn’t stand out there any longer. I used all the strength I had to lift my feet, but as soon as I did, I tripped. I sat up and wiped the dirt from my palms. Out the corner of my eye, I saw a dark, black, animalistic figure emerging from the bushes.

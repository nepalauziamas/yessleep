My life started off fairly average. I lived in a small house in the country, my family weren’t overly wealthy but there was never any worry about having food on the table or water to drink. I had 2 siblings, both brothers. They were my middle brother Malik and my eldest brother, I’ll call him Omar. My family was always happy. 

Until one day Omar murdered them all in cold blood. 

That monster was 17 while I was 12. He brutally beat my brother Malik and my mother with a sledge hammer and made quick work of my father. Father was already very frail as he was suffering from a rare bone disease. 

Though for some reason Omar decided to spare me. Sometimes I wish he just killed me with the rest of them, but I surmise the bastard enjoyed the knowledge that his youngest brother had to live with the unbearable weight of his own wrongdoings. 

My life was hell.

I had to live with immense hatred of my brother and the knowledge that I was to weak and vulnerable to do anything about it. That’s when I came to the conclusion that the murder of my family is on my hands too. 

The murder occurred during a time of great duress in my country, the police force didn’t have the resources nor hands to investigate my family’s murder. At least that was their despicable excuse. They allowed my brother to get off free. That’s when I made my choice, I would do what the police failed to do. 

I dedicated the rest of my life to exterminating that monster known as Omar. 

At first it seemed like an insurmountable goal. My brother was strong, standing at around 193cm and weighing at least 102kg. He was a smart one too, always at the top of his class. So with all his brains I’m sure he figured I would come for him someday, he was right. 

I trained and trained, from dawn to dusk, and I studied different forms of combat. I devoted 24 hours a day to my revenge. I couldn’t sleep anyway, PTSD will take away all the comfort needed to get decent rest. I became obsessed and learned every technique to efficiently kill a man, I became cold and isolated and lost myself to the darkness. 

I did anything to get power, I tried steroids, illegal smuggling of weapons, everything. I couldn’t and wouldn’t fail. 

When the time came I resolved that I would be the blade to cut down my brother. 

After years of living this isolated lifestyle I felt as if I was finally ready. I tried to keep tabs on my brother ever since he left my home that fateful day. But Omar was very good at hiding his tracks, despite that, through persistence and a little bit of luck I finally found him. 

My brother was living a few cities away under a new identity, he now called himself Ahmed and worked at a local engineer shop. With resolve I left my house and packed everything I needed to kill him, I made the trip a few cities away and found his employer. 

At first I couldn’t see any hints of Omar at the shop so I waited in the parking lot until it was late at night. Omar’s higher up was just shutting the place down, there were no other cars in the lot so I assumed it was just him. I interrogated the man for the location of Omar’s new residence. 

Annoyingly, the man was skeptical and wouldn’t easily give away the location of one of his workers. So I used some violent suggestion to get him to spill the address. Before I left I made sure to shut the man up, no loose ends. 

As I neared the location I thought on my multiple plans on how I would take Omar’s life in different situations. Though nothing could ever prepare me for what I saw when I entered his residence.  As I pulled in at the end of his street I noticed that the man had done well for himself. He had a house bigger than what I’ve ever lived in and multiple luxury cars in the driveway. I decided to save that information in the recesses of my mind and kept moving forwards. After waiting long enough to make sure all lights were off I made my move. 

With the efficiency of a professional I managed to scale his back wall and pry open one of the upper windows. I found myself in a very spartan bedroom with nothing to speak for it but a bed and some empty drawers. That’s when I heard commotion downstairs, I confidently strode down the steps with all the practiced grace of a black panther stalking it’s prey. 

I, armed with a silenced pistol, saw the dim flashing lights of a T.V. This was the perfect moment, my brother was distracted,  I would kill him quickly and easily with a well timed shot to the back of the head and make my escape before the next advertisement. As I neared the couch my blood ran cold as I noticed something, there wasn’t one figure, there was three. 

My brother had a family. 

The shocking realization hit me so hard that I almost shouted and blew my cover. 

Are they stupid? How could they trust him? How could they not know what he’s done? How could his beautiful wife and infant not realize that they were living with a monster? 

I faltered in my approach as I questioned these things. Though in next moment the noise in my head was drowned out by the voice that was undoubtedly my brother, he spoke incoherent words to his wife as she laughed at a joke he made. Hearing that short conversation made me remember who I am. 

I am an avenger. 

A darkness set in my heart, a darkness that found this opportunity quite appealing. I would be content as I destroyed his happiness just as he did mine. I would show him how much I suffered and laugh in his face as I destroyed everything he held dear. With that mentality I strode forwards, counting the steps until I reached him. 

7 steps to go, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.

I was right behind him. Him and his family’s lives were in my hands, and I loved every second of it. I made sure to make his family’s lives end as painlessly as possible. I saved them from the horrible reality of the monster they lived with. My brother fell back with a start as I finally got a good look at his face. 

He was terrified, the utter fear made him look like he had just seen a monster. Well I suppose that wouldn’t be far from the truth. My eyes saw red as I regarded every detail of his ghastly visage as if time was moving in slow motion. In that moment I had all the power, space, time, matter, everything bent to my will. I relished in my shining moment as I pulled out my blade and painfully cut down my brother with a deranged smile. Within the next few minutes he was dead, gone in silence as the intense pain of his demise stopped him from uttering any words. 

I lit a match and tossed it to the hardwood floors. As if to purify the situation, or to forcefully burn the memory of that cursed home. I left and never looked back. 

I’ve seen many cliches state that revenge never goes well. That it only leads to a place of emptiness. That it brings the avenger to a purgatory of their own creation. 

The cliches were right. 

I wish I did die that night long ago, with my family, because I realize now that my survival ensured my brothers victory. I’m sure that he’s laughing in whatever hellish void he’s found himself in, laughing because ultimately I became just like him.

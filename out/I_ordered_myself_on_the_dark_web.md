I know youâ€™re frowning. The title is weird, I know. But, if you could just give me a moment I'll explain. I'll have to be fast though, I don't know how close they are.

&#x200B;

Essentially, I ordered myself on the dark web.

&#x200B;

I'm a drug user, I'll admit it. Weed is my usual go to, but I buy that off my friend. If, however, I want to get something a little heavier, like acid, or coke, I'd just order it off the dark web. It's surprisingly simple. A few clicks, some bitcoin transfers and then boom, I have acid in my PO box.

&#x200B;

But I'm also a curious guy. The dark web has always... intrigued me. Up until a few days ago, I had only been on there to buy drugs off sites some of my friends gave to me. But, late one night I was sober and at home, which was a rare thing for me. So, since I was bored I decided to boot up my tor browser and try and see what sort of fucked up shit I could find on the dark web. If you've ever been on the dark web, you'll know that you can't just search up "red rooms," or "hitman for hire," and get results. No, you have to find links to these websites first.

&#x200B;

So I hopped back onto google again to try and find some links to a messed up website. I know it's weird that I was actively searching for the worst, but as soon as I got on the dark web that night I had a sense of morbid curiosity overcame me. Anyway, I spent a little while trying to find some links. Anything that I found though was either too tame for me, or the links didn't work. At this point, I was about ready to give up, and I wish I had.

&#x200B;

But, in one final attempt, I clicked on Reddit. Hoping onto r/deepweb, I didn't think I would find anything. So, I just scrolled through hot for about half an hour before sorting by new. Then, I found it.

&#x200B;

One, simple text post titled: "**SLAYERS ASSASSINATION AND LIFE RUINING SERVICES**." In the text box in the post was what seemed to be just a random assortment of numbers and letters (zy3dkytcaubkq2y3, for those of you curious ). It took my tired brain a second to figure out what it was, but I realized pretty quickly. It was a link, presumably to a hitman website.

&#x200B;

So, I decided to paste the link into my dark web browser and what do you know, it worked. But, before I decided to go any further I figured I should go back to OP's profile to see if they have posted any other dark web links. However, when I went back to the post in question OP's profile was deleted. Weird.

&#x200B;

Anyway, I re-opened my dark web tab and hopped onto the site. Up along the top of the website was it's name, **SLAYERS ASSASSINATION AND LIFE RUINING SERVICES** and next to it what looked to be a skull inside of a crosshair. I chuckled when I saw that, the site must be fake. Upon scrolling down however, I was not disappointed.

&#x200B;

There was a paragraph of white text on a black background, and a small box to the right of the text that just said 'place an order.' The text was the main part though, as it took up most of the page. It read:

&#x200B;

"Slayers assassinations and life ruining services offers everything from acid attack, crippling, blinding, castration, torture, rape, beatings and good old death. We have the lowest prices out of any other company running similar services, and we are world wide! We have a dedicated and experienced group of staff based all over the world, so if you need someone to be assassinated, or maybe you just want them scarred for life, don't hesitate to contact us!"

&#x200B;

Again I laughed. This had to be satire, right? Hell, I was even tempted to order it on someone just to see what would happen. Ironically, I actually have a half-decent job so I can afford to. Better not to risk it though, I thought to myself.

&#x200B;

I was about to close my computer and call it for a night when I heard a knock at the door. I live alone, so it was unusual to get visitors, especially so late at night. But, when I opened my door it was just my good buddy Mark, who also happened to be my weed plug.

&#x200B;

As I opened the door, he didn't hesitate to let himself in and shove a **big** baggie full of pot in my face.

"This, dude, if the best shit I've had in a minute, we gotta try some."

&#x200B;

I couldn't say no.

&#x200B;

Cut to a couple hours later, it's early morning and Mark and I are chilling on my couch, both blazed as fuck. He suddenly decides to get up, and I assume he's going to get some leftover pizza, but he walks over to my desk and computer.

&#x200B;

"Slayers assassinations, are you gonna kill someone or something?" he mutters.

"What?" I reply

"Your computer dude, it's got some hacker shit on it."

"It's the dark web man, don't fuck with it."

&#x200B;

At this point I'm still on my couch, half asleep and not paying full attention, however I sat up pretty fast when he said the words: "Hey man, lets order a hitman on you."

&#x200B;

I hoped up and walked over to my PC. Part of my brain was screaming no, what the fuck are you doing, but the majority of my brain (which was also they high part) was thinking about how funny it would be to order a hitman on myself. So I agree. I do made him get out my chair though, because I didn't want him seeing what my credit card numbers were as I transferred some bitcoin.

&#x200B;

At the end, after I wrote down all my personal details, like my address, age, and even a photo, I had to select what I wanted to happen to me. I just selected plain old assassination, as it was actually cheaper than some of the other things. I could have paid an extra couple of grand to be beaten before my death, but even my high brain didn't want to splash the cash too much on my own death. God, this is ridiculous.

&#x200B;

Anyway, I placed the order and then replied to a confirmation email, and boom. It was done. A couple of clicks and I had ordered myself on the dark web. Mark and I laughed about it for a while, but then he left about an hour later and I fell asleep not too long after.

&#x200B;

I woke up around 9 a.m., which meant I got at least six hours of sleep, even if it felt like I got three. I got up and out of bed, threw on some track pants and a cotton shirt (yes, I sleep naked), and brewed myself a coffee before sitting down to play some games and just. enjoy my Sunday.

&#x200B;

You can imagine how shocked I was when I saw that I had ordered my death the previous night.

&#x200B;

Even though I thought the site was bullshit I still felt a pit open up in my stomach. Even when I'm high I usually can make sensible decisions. I chuckled, not like I could remember it anyway, but I guess Mark's new shit really *was* good.

&#x200B;

I would assume a normal human being would do something else, but I was still kind of out of it from the night before so I just carried on with my day. I was a little more paranoid, sure, but as I said I just assumed it was bullshit. I even laughed at the email I got from the website, saying that their hitman has been dispatched and was on its way. It was like ordering a package of Amazon, I was tempted to email back and ask for some day delivery.

&#x200B;

But I didn't need to ask, because that's exactly what I got. I didn't see it arrive, but around the time I started to cook myself a shitty dinner I noticed a blacked out sedan parked on the other side of the road from my house. I didn't live in a rural area, but there is a lot of trees and bushes between each of the houses on my street, so I would be surprised if any other house saw the car except for mine.

&#x200B;

At this point, I was freaking out. What if the site was real? Even though I'm a big guy, I was freaking out. I don't own any weapons, aside from a slightly larger-than-average kitchen knife. Fuck it, I'm confronting it, I decided. I put on a hoodie and slid the knife into the front pocket before waltzing on out of my house and walking right up to the driver side window of the vehicle. Even I was astonished at my own courage.

&#x200B;

Knocking on the window, nothing happened. It was... rather anti-climatic, I was fully prepared to have to fight for my life, all because I did something really dumb while I was baked. But, like I said, nothing happened. I even put my head right up to the window, as if there was a reflection, to try and get a better look to see whats inside.

&#x200B;

I could barely see what was inside of the car, but all I could make out were two empty seats. No one was even inside. I had got all hyped up for nothing. I decided to wait out by the car for a bit, but after half an hour or so I was hungry and I had to go back inside to take my dinner out of the oven. I swear, it was only a minute between me going inside to take my dinner out of the oven and looking back out of the window, and the car being gone. I didn't even hear it go.

&#x200B;

"Guess I'm eating my dinner with all my curtains closed and doors locked," I muttered to myself.

&#x200B;

I had just started to calm down when the power shut off. It was sunny outside, and coupled with the car I now knew that this was the real deal. I had signed my own death warrant.

&#x200B;

I ran into my upstairs bedroom and locked the door, and then hid under the bed. I couldn't all the cops, what would I say? "Oh yes hello sir, turns out while super high I paid 5k for some anonymous hitman to kill me and now he's arrived, send an officer asap please and thank you."

&#x200B;

So, I just stayed hiding under my bed, and I still am now. I've been here for an hour now writing this. Think of this as my epitaph. I know I'm screwed. Just a minute ago I heard my back door slowly creak open. This piece of writing may seem humorous to you, the reader, but in reality as you read this I'm under my bed praying to a god that lost all faith in me years ago to spare me, to let me go.

&#x200B;

But I know that won't happen. My bedroom door just opened and I can see a big pair of black boots.

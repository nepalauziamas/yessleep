It's been a year since my grandfather died. A year in which I have known more weariness and terror than the rest of the years of my life combined.



It took me far too long to take my dead grandfather's advice and get myself some oxygen. I didn't want to go to a doctor, as I knew they would not find the cause of my condition, and I stupidly thought I would be unable to simply buy oxygen without a doctor's referral. But after several months, and considerable fatigue, my desperation drove me to a website where I bought a few cylinders with no questions asked. It seems nobody cares if you buy oxygen. 


It did help. In a way. But it helped the same way as drying your hands on a damp towel is better than no towel at all. 


Anyway. I feel like I am getting ahead of myself. Let me start at the morning after my first visitation. 



I might have thought it was a vivid, bad dream, despite my exhaustion. There was a single, frameless mirror left in the house, screwed in above the bathroom washbasin, and I dragged myself there with limbs that felt heavy and clumsy. 


There were black circles beneath my eyes that hadn't been there the day before, and fine lines around my mouth that were also a new addition. I regarded myself for some time, trying to process what I was seeing and make some kind of sense of it, but my mind was as sluggish as my body. Every breath was an effort, every thought vague and hard fought for.


I eventually dragged myself back to my mattress and slept for another 5 hours, and by the end of that substantial nap I was only marginally more refreshed than before. 


I did not wake naturally. I was woken by my phone ringing next to my head, vibrating on the bare boards, and it hadn't been the first phone call: I had slept through four others, according to my missed calls log.


My mother was on the other end, frantic and anxious. She had no suspicion of what I'd gone through, obviously, but she knew how close I'd been to my grandpa and my sudden radio silence concerned her. 


She asked me if I was ready to come home. She had to repeat the question several times before I understood what she was asking, but once it had penetrated the flabby mush that was my mind I seized upon it immediately. The house where I had once felt so safe and welcome was now a landscape of half remembered nightmares, and I wanted to go home very much. 


I must have fallen asleep again, because the next thing I remembered was my mother leaning over me, shaking me as gently and insistently as she could. I managed to mumble something about the flu, a very quick fabrication considering the circumstances, and let her take over. 


I am in my twenties, but there is something about giving up control and letting your parent take care of you even when you are an adult that can be very comforting. Depending on your relationship of course. 


My mother packed my few belongings, my father took them to his car. I was ushered outside on wobbly legs, and the sound of the front door slamming shut behind me was the sweetest I'd ever heard. I was ready to be coddled and looked after, and once I was in my old room surrounded by my old plush toys and familiar furnishings I felt something inside me uncoil. A worry I didn't know I carried was set loose, like the snipped string of a helium balloon, and I fell onto my old bed with a relief I can't describe. 


I slept some more. I couldn't get enough sleep, it seemed. When I woke, the sunlight that had been filtering through my curtains had dimmed considerably, but I could hear a TV playing somewhere in the house, and artificial light drew a rectangle around the edges of my door. I was home, and I was not alone, and I went back to sleep with no fear whatsoever. 



The fearlessness did not last long. 


When I woke again, the TV was silent and the lights were out. My room was dark, but for the yellow light of a lone streetlamp shining through a gap in the curtains. I could hear my father snoring, a sound that was familiar and should have been comforting if it weren't for the other sound I could hear. 


It was a sly shuffling, somehow soggy and dry at the same, accompanied by a leathery flapping that I remembered from the night before. I could not move, but this time I thankfully had enough control that I could close my eyes, and I lay waiting as the noise got louder and closer. 


The song that had comforted me the previous time faltered in my mind - the words were muffled and slurred - and I tried to think of another as I heard my bedroom doorknob rattle. 


There were a lot of jumbled thoughts going through my head as my bedroom door swung open. The main one was that I was stupid - stupid to think I could leave that thing behind just by switching location, when I could feel the ugly brooch burning against my thigh through the pocket of my jeans. I had brought the brooch with me. Stupid. Stupid. 


I tried to relax, but the terror was just as keen as it had been before. The mere presence of the thing made my mouth dry and my eyes wet, made my heart scuffle and throb inside my ribs. My lungs were already shrinking in anticipation, knowing what was to come, and I could barely breathe at all by the time the thing was on my chest, stealing the last of the scant air I had left. 


It was hungry and greedy and merciless, and as I let my mind drift in the last of my consciousness I heard its scratchy voice burrowing into my brain in a way that itched somehow: Words that weren't English, or even human, but that I could almost understand anyway. 


I was closer to this thing than I had ever been to another person, so close I could hear its thoughts, and as much as I hated it I almost felt a sense of completion. It loved me, this creature, loved me in a damaged and possessive way that didn't care about the destruction of everything that made me. I belonged to it, and it was glad. 



The knowledge that I hadn't escaped my fate preceded my waking thoughts. Before any other realisation sank in, I knew I was caught up in something unfathomable, and despite my tiredness I was prepared to do something about it. 


It was late morning, nearly noon, and as I stumbled into the kitchen my father made some kind of comment about the lateness, the way dads are wont to do. I didn't fully comprehend his words but I understood the tone, and understood my mother's tone when she scolded him. I was beyond caring. 


I managed to string together some words, it seemed, asked to go back to my grandpa's house, and managed to deflect the inevitable questions by simple incomprehension. I sat at the table and waited til my father had finished his lunch, then let myself be ushered to the car. 


I was wearing the same clothes I had been wearing for days. The same jeans and top. I was even in my shoes and socks. I hadn't taken anything off, and the brooch was in my pocket. I had been lying on it when I woke and its imprint must surely have been sketched on my flesh, a perfect outline.


Hideous thing. 


I made my father wait outside as I opened the door to my grandma's room. It was completely bare now, even the curtains gone, and dust motes drifted and swirled in the sunbeams cutting through the emptiness. Something primitive had brought me here, and I didn't even have to search for the loose board that lay where her bed would have been. I pried it up with my fingernails, mindless of the splinters piercing my flesh, and deposited the cursed brooch within the dust choked gap I found. It nestled there, the garish colours of the glass and metal barely dimmed, and I pressed the floorboard back into place with grim satisfaction. Let someone else find it. Let the new owners deal with it. 


My father took me home, wordless in the way fathers are also wont, not asking any awkward questions, and I slept for the rest of the day whilst the world continued around me. 


Stupid. Stupid. It follows its talisman, but the talisman is not just physical. I owned it again. I know this now. 


Before, my grandpa had taken it back. Returned it to my grandma. I did not own it then. And when my grandma had died, who knew what had happened to the creature? It must have drifted, not owned, and owning no one, for all those years. 


I hope it suffered. I hope it was suffocated every night, unable to find a new victim, choked on its own helplessness. I hope it withered and failed with shrivelled lungs, and gasped in agony with every laboured breath. I hope it hurt every second it existed. 


Because when I found the brooch again, when nobody else was there to take possession of it, that's when it became mine again. It remembered me. And now I bore the same curse my grandmother had.


I stayed with my parents for a few more days, until the questions my mother asked got too much for me. My father noticed my decline, of course, but said nothing, merely watching me over the kitchen table with increasing concern, and I knew that at some point he would be forced to speak up. 

And I could not allow that. 

I couldn't answer tricky questions. 


I knew I had to move out and find my own place, but the sludge of my weary mind struggled with the concept of searching for a new place to live. 


Happily - or unhappily, whichever way you look at it - my problem was solved with no effort from me. 

It seemed that whilst most of my grandparents' belongings had been split equally between their surviving offspring, my grandpa had left me the house. 


It may have seemed odd or unfair to the rest of the family, but at the end of the day I had been the favourite grandchild, of course, and nobody needed much more explanation than that. But I alone knew the real reason. 


My parents helped me move my bed and few belongings back into my grandpa's house. They were concerned, as my health had clearly been failing recently, but didn't kick up too much of a fuss. There was a sneaking feeling that they were relieved. Not to be rid of me, but to be rid of the thing that had followed me. Whether they were consciously aware of it or not, it affected them somehow, on a very basic level. 


I was relieved too, in my way: I was too tired to face the questions that would come, the unwanted advice that would involve keeping hydrated and taking vitamins and doing yoga. I wanted to languish whilst I figured out what I should do. 


I set up my base camp in my old room, but it wasn't ideal, even under such dire circumstances. 

Every night, I listened to it open my grandmother's bedroom door and make its awkward way towards where I lay. The terror never grew any less. Whether it was the third time or the three hundredth time, I felt the same amount of fear as before. It never changed. I was a virgin sacrifice to its hunger every time, the horror just as fresh on every occasion. 


So I moved my bed. Moved it to the very heart of activity. The source, as it were. 


I pushed my bed, by myself, to my grandmother's room. It took all day, with frequent stops to rest, but by the time the sun was setting I had managed to manoeuvre it beneath the window, where my grandmother's bed had once been. 


Lying down there as sleep overtook me was the bravest thing I had ever done. I knew where the thing originated. But in the oddest way, it was also better. 


It took mere moments for the thing to scrabble out from under my bed and settle on my chest. Whereas before I'd had to listen to it crawl and scrape its way towards me as the tension grew, as I lay numb and helpless, now it was over nearly as soon as it had begun. I would black out almost instantly when it began to feed, and wake with my lungs limp and flabby, but at least now that endless, horrifying journey had been cut short. 


It was the closest thing I had experienced to peace for a long time. 



When I could think, I tried to remember what my grandpa had said. Tried to remember every overheard conversation, getting any clue I could. Once I had my oxygen to revive me in the mornings, it was slightly easier to think. 


I recalled the knowledge that I could pass it on, and that knowledge kept me going for a while. It was my Get Out Clause. 


I thought of people who would deserve such a curse: Bullies I went to school with; Karens from my customer service days; ex boyfriends who didn't know what the word "No" meant. There are many people in the world who deserved such a fate as I had to deal with. 


Some boxes I had packed away and sent off somehow made their way back to me. Visiting family members deposited them on my doorstep when I wouldn't or couldn't answer the door, and I sifted through them when I had the strength. 


There were a lot of old photos, black and white and sepia coloured, of our ancestors. 


Our family was largely made up of women. It seemed I had known this, but at the same time the realisation was new to me. There were more females than males in those pictures. Staunch women with stern faces, and in many of them the sternest women were the ones with a brooch pinned to their bosom.


I knew that brooch. I had lost and found it, hidden it and retrieved it. It was mine. 


Something about my family, some strength of bloodline, had made it choose us as perfect victims. It told me as much every night it visited, fond and cruel as it sucked my life's essence from me, in a language only I could understand. 


Other victims failed quickly, either died from the strain or took their own lives, but not my family. We had the strength to take the abuse. It was nothing to be proud of, but somehow I was. Maybe because I had to cling on to something to keep me going. 


One morning found me in my new garden. 


I don't remember making my way there, and I was hardly dressed for the outdoors, but I had no problem being there. 

It had been neglected badly, and I felt a moment's guilt that my grandpa's prized garden was now overgrown and scruffy, but a moment's guilt was all I felt. 


I had laid the brooch on the bricks of the barbecue pit my grandpa had built. 

The grill that had cooked so many burgers and sausages over the decades was now rusty and grimy, but the bricks were as solid as the day they were laid. 


A weak autumn sun picked up the glimmer from the awkward shards of the ugly brooch, casting painful and slightly warped beams of colour that hurt my sore eyes, but I didn't care. In my hands I held a large, pointed rock that I had apparently wrestled from a flowerbed, and it was poised above the brooch. 


There was rich, dark earth clinging to half of the rock, healthy and fertile, but I had turned it around so the dry portion pointed downwards, a jagged edge hovering over the unnatural piece of jewellery. It was a weapon in my hands. As hard and cruel as the thing that fed on me. 


I may have considered what I was about to do. Questioned it. Wondered if it was a sensible idea. I don't remember. All I know is that I gave myself only a moment's hesitation before bringing the rock down. 


The brooch jumped beneath the impact. Stuttered against the bricks, scoring a faint, pale line. The pin on the back of the brooch snapped with no resistance, but none of the enamel or glass chipped. 


I repositioned it with one clumsy hand, and brought the rock down again. 


The metal buckled slightly, but again the core structure of the brooch held up. I could see no damage. 


Again and again, I moved the brooch, hammered my rock against it. Again and again, it refused to submit. 


The most that happened was an almost imperceptible crack that appeared along  one portion of enamel and that instance sent a jarring, piercing pain up my arm from my fingers to my shoulder, leaving the whole limb numb. 


If I thought I could succeed, I would have continued through the pain. Would have kept hitting it till the thing was a pile of colourful dust and I was writhing on the ground. But I knew there was no point. 


I threw my rock aside. Picked up the brooch. The pin was snapped but I spent half an hour digging out some glue and replacing the injured component, even as I wept. 


I could not destroy it. My only option was to pass it on. 


There are many people in the world who deserve such a fate. Too many people. I had to find them. 


I knew it wouldn't release me, but it might give me some respite. 


My first attempt to deliver myself was at a school reunion. 


Under normal circumstances I would not have attended, but my memories of school were very clear, and the miseries I had suffered there were not forgotten. 


I managed to make myself an admin on the reunion page on Facebook, and suggested a Secret Santa type arrangement as if it had been suggested to me by someone else. It was close enough to Christmas for others to pick up on the idea, and approve of it, and it was the work of mere minutes to select my victim. A boy called Patrick who had been a sex offender in training but was now a man who had somehow managed to convince the general public that he was respectable. 


He had a wife and children now. I didn't care. I remembered him only too well. 


The "random" draw I orchestrated made him mine, and I boxed and gift-wrapped my brooch with a barely containable glee that should have worried me but did not.


I even laughed as I imagined his wife and kids sleeping peacefully whilst he struggled and gasped beneath the weight of my misshapen companion. 


I don't remember much about the night itself. I remember the looks people gave me, and though it made me resentful I couldn't blame them: Aside from my weight loss and evident fatigue, my skin was pallid and paper thin, and some pure white hairs had crept in at my temples. I looked so ill I overheard people whispering about me, wondering if I had a terminal illness. Despite their concern I had to laugh. Life itself is a terminal illness. 


The only other thing I remember is, of course, the Secret Santa. I was sitting in a corner by this point, barely able to keep awake, but I revived myself long enough to see Patrick open his gift. 


His face displayed an expression of polite horror he didn't bother to hide. If it had merely been a terrible gift, I had no doubt he would have said something funny and scathing, but the ugliness of the brooch seemed to have choked any words in his throat. He looked uneasy and uncomfortable, and I was glad. 


I left then, not bothering to open my own gift. I left it, unwrapped, on the floor by my chair and got an Uber home. 


I fell asleep quickly once in bed. I did every night, but this time there was no scuffling from under the bed as I was on the edge of sleep, and the silence was the most comforting noise. 


At some point during the night, however, I woke up with a start, and tried to look at my clock to see what time it was. I couldn't move my head, and the realisation filled me with such a sense of hopelessness I would have wept if I had the energy. Something was opening the door to my grandma's room - my room, now - and scraping its way at a crawl towards me. 


It was making a noise I had never heard it make before. A wet, phlegmy sound that grew louder until it was gurgling next to my ear. It was laughing, in its warped way. Something was placed into my unresisting hand and even though I couldn't see it I knew the angles of the brooch without looking. 


My tormentor climbed onto my chest, sliding one hand beneath my head to raise it, and as it began to feed it imparted its knowledge to me through its own brand of psychic communication. It didn't want to give me any clues, but it wanted me to know the details of my failure. I saw Patrick taking the brooch from his pocket as he left the reunion and tossing it into a bin outside the school as he waited for his Uber to arrive. Was it really that easy for him? How was it possible? He owned it! 


I tried again. Of course I did. Any noble thoughts about bearing the curse and suffering alone had left me long ago. 


I gifted it to many people over the Christmas period, and beyond. It always returned. There was a pattern forming but I was too exhausted to see it. 


Once, I even gave it to a homeless man begging for change. This was the only transaction that gave me any pangs of guilt, as the other people I had tried to fob the brooch and its keeper off on had wronged me in some way. This man had done nothing to deserve it, but I was desperate. 


His face twisted when he saw what I'd given him, and recoiled in a jerking motion that had to be involuntary. He corrected his unfavourable reaction, shaking his head even as he accepted it, and turned it over in his hands with a look of horrified awe. 


"What is it?" he asked. 


"I don't know. I found it," I told him. "Has to be worth something." 


He nodded, apparently satisfied with my reply, but I doubt he'd heard it.


"It's horrible," he said.


"I know," I said. 


He shrugged, and put the brooch in his pocket. 


"Thank you," he said, sounding uncertain about his thanks, and I walked away. 


I had no grand expectations after my other failures, and despite the fact that he had apparently accepted it, the homeless man was not to be the new guardian of the brooch. 


It was returned by my creature's own hand, as usual, and the cycle continued. 


You may think I never discovered the secret to handing off the brooch. Well, I did. It took me far too long but I managed. 


My first reprieve came in the form of a young Goth boy with pierced lips and painted nails and white contacts. A beautiful creature, he came up to me in the street as if drawn to me by an invisible fishing line. 


I had taken to wearing the brooch. Why not? It was on the lapel of my coat for all to see, and a twisted part of me that had not existed before enjoyed the looks of disgust and disturbance it drew. 


But not this boy. His eyes were wide and his lips stretched into a smile as he approached me. 


"What is that?" he asked me, fascinated.


"Family heirloom," I told him, not bothering to lie. 


"It's horrible," he said, his voice almost affectionate with its awe. "I've never seen anything like it! Can I take a picture of it to show my girlfriend?" 


He already had his phone out, ready to take a photo, but I smiled at him. 


"Better than that. You can have it. Do you want it?" 


His eyes went wider still. 


"Well, yeah!" he said as if it were a foregone conclusion. "But I can't take a family heirloom from you…" 


The look of longing he gave the brooch was keen, and before I'd even realised what I was doing I was unpinning it. 


"You can," I said. "It goes where it is wanted. That's how my family got it. My grandmother always told me it goes where it is needed, and if someone ever wanted it I should give it to them." 


He absorbed my lies with a thoughtful expression. 


"If you're sure…" he said. 


"I'm sure," I responded, and held it out to him. 


He took it from my raised palm, and from that moment I knew. 


You had to want it. That was the thing. It was no good being given it against your will. I had tried a few times to smuggle it onto people, dropping it into the open bag or exposed pocket of a stranger. But that didn't count. 


You had to want it. 


It's been 2 months since the boy took it from me. My sleep has been deep and my health blooming. I haven't touched my oxygen in weeks, and when I looked in the mirror this morning the face that looked back was fresh and youthful and healthy. 


But I know it won't last. I can already feel an itching in the base of my skull that might be the thoughts of my monster ready to return. Its food source is failing. But this time, I know what I have to do. I have already set up an Ebay selling account, selling off bits and pieces of my grandmother's jewellery for now, alongside pieces I have found in thrift shops, and am doing good business. The brooch is strange and ugly but I know it will resonate with someone out there, and I have a worldwide platform. 


When the sweet goth boy has gone, there will be others to take my burden for a while.

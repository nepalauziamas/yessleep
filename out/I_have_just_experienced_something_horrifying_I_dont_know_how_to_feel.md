Recently, my girlfriend Ella and I moved into a cheap 3 bed farmhouse. The house is situated on a duel carriageway without any neighbours for at least 3miles  probably more. I had a bad feeling about the house but my girlfriend is in love with farm life. 

The occurrences began when we started peeling down the wallpaper in one of the bedrooms, I heard a sound downstairs and went to investigate in fear of my Ella being in danger. The kitchen cutlery drawer was wide open, I don't wanna seem like the stereotypical horror character but I was just a bit confused and just shut the door and went back to my business.

I don't want to make anything a big deal! I want my girlfriend to be happy and not feel stressed in her dream home. 

That was the first experience and they became a weekly thing. I try hide all the evidence of these things happening because I don't want to stress out now heavily pregnant Ella ( I forgot to mention her pregnancy that's the reason we moved)

Here are some of the things that happened I'm not going to list them all for obvious reasons

1 I found small bones tied together under my doormat where the spare keys are

2 Doll body parts scattered in an old stable 

3 Dark stains under the carpet  

4 Hairs under our pillows

My girlfriend has gone into labour so I go to drive her to the hospital 25 minutes away, it was just soft labour but our midwife said to take her in because of Ella's diabetes. I go home to get her hospital bag and the light is on upstairs. I go to the nursery to turn of the light and get the bag. i look in my room and see a bony figure ,kind of like the hobbit, It was sitting on the bed  facing the window humming a soft song. I bolted down the stairs and went out the house without looking back. I drove straight to the hospital trying to comprehend what just happened. A few questions crossed my mind do I tell Ella or not, should we return home, what even was that. 

On my way I get a phone call from an unknown number but I decided not to answer because my future wife and my child are my main focus right now. I arrived at the hospital and decided not to mention it yet and called my friend Jack over to check the house, keys are under the mat.

Ella had a Caesarean and was recovering in the hospital and a few hours later I get a call from Jack

"Hey man, I don't know if your pulling a practical joke on me but I got a call from a number and when i called it back It rang inside the house. Did El get a new phone or something?"

"Jack.. What was the number?"

"Let me check.  **935-778-4681** "

That's the same number that called me

"JACK GET OUT OF THERE" 

The phone just ended like that. I'm not planning on returning home at this point and Ella is still recovering. 

I get a call from my Neighbour Silvia  telling me to hurry home. I got back to see my home surrounded by cops and an ambulance. Jack was dead. Silvia was walking her dog through the field an she saw my house with the front door open, like any person she decided to explore finding Jack's corpse. The police question me and shut my house of.

The house had been fully destroyed plates and knives thrown everywhere, cupboards broken, furniture torn. His body was covered in deep scratch marks and carved into with a knife 14 times. I'm not sure how to feel I just lost my best mate and its all my fault.

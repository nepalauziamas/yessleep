Hello, my name is Emet I am in college for set theory and astrophysics and I have a wild discovery... Please hear me out since doing this and releasing this information might just get me killed. One week ago I was testing a theory with a friend about proving god's existence using science. Every test we would run became inconclusive and impossible to prove. Feeling defeated I went to the library to read a bit as the smell of old books and the dim lighting helps me relax. I grabbed a book off the shelf and found a nice comfy chair and began reading. Funny enough the characters in the book I grabbed are also looking for what god is but in a spiritual sense and not a scientific stance. 

Then it hit me... What if we can't reach god or talk to it etc because it is our author. Listen I have read on here someone explaining the cosmology of our world... his name was Auren I believe. Anyways, he explained how the multiverses exist and how there are a transfinite set of universes and  a transfinite set of multiverses now imagine this being stacked like a pancake. The pancake above exists in higher existence than the one below and this goes on beyond the idea of infinity. He explained how it was a "Hierarchy" of stories. Much like when we read a story or book we view its universe as a work of fiction however, these fictional beings exist in their respective universe and believe they exist. 

This would all mean we cannot even perceive the stack above us just as a fictional being can never interact with us. With this theory in mind, I presented it to my friend Caleb and he seemed to understand. 

"Wh...What the hell do you mean god is an author? Have you been smoking weed again man?" Caleb said with a confused look. 

I looked back at him with confidence and said   "Man, hear me out. What if God wasn't one of us. What if he was the one who not only made us but WROTE us. There is no heaven or hell there is just this existence in the story that we call life. Everything is written by one asshole with a pen who makes us suffer." 

Caleb scratched his head. "So wait... you mean to tell me you think God wrote us. Not that he made us and we will with free will. But he wrote us and we are just going along with the plot and narration? Ok .... yea... you have to be smoking. What is it and where can I get some bro?" 

I placed my hand over my face and pinched the space between my eyebrows. "Ok so If I get concrete proof that this is true would you be ok with it?" He looked at me and just responded with "Yea but I still wanna know what you're smoking" We both laugh and I decided to go home which is a one-bedroom studio apartment.  

I got to my door and fumbled with my keys to open the door. Before I unlocked it I noticed there were markings on the door where the door latch would be. To confirm my suspicion I go to check to see if my door was locked. I jiggled the handle and it was still locked. I took a deep breath and sighed with relief. You don't know this but I was robbed a few months back at a different place and it has led me to be very... paranoid when I notice little things like scuffs on my door, etc. I got inside and sat down on my bed and opened my laptop where I began writing my thesis on what God truly is. At first, I couldn't think of a single way I could experiment to prove he exists when the basis of my thesis is he is my author or .... our author so to speak. 

Then I read about this guy named Max Tegmark and he was using a theory that our universe is infinitely more complex than a universe where impossible things happen because our universe is completely based on mathematics. I thought "If that were to be true then could we measure God?" The answer is yes and no... In theory, you could measure God however in set theory there are sets of infinity with the smallest set being Aleph Null. Each group of infinities exists completely inaccessible to the one below it and no matter how high the set below climbs it could never reach the next step. This idea correlates to my universal theory that everything is a story. Think about it when we read a book the characters could never truly reach us much like Aleph Null can't reach Aleph 1. What if we are Aleph 1 and Aleph 2 is where "God" Is? 

Then if that was the case what is the final writer? Who is the author of the author? It would have to be truly infinite in every way. Nothing can reach it not even a description could reach it since it would be impossible to even put a label on the being known as God. So we could never reach or met god as he is above the very being who wrote us. But do they realize it... do they know they are but a story on the never-ending narrative ladder? This all comes down to saying "God" is absolute infinity. The final infinity is completely inaccessible by any means. No aleph or large cardinal could reach the zone of absolute infinity. This would make "God" The Absolute Author...

I brought up this theory to my professor. He introduced me to set theory so naturally, that I knew he'd understand. When I got to his office it was dark which is odd because he always kept it dim. "Maybe he wasn't there and is home." So before entering I called his cell (we were close friends outside of school) and he didn't answer... this was uncharismatic of him. So I went to open the doorknob I the same scratch marks on his door as mine. This is odd because I saw it before. seeing this made my heart pound and my body began to sweat. I slowly turned the knob and time seemed to slow down and I can hear my heart pounding. When the door swung open the air was cold and stale. It usually smells of old books and amber in his office but it just ... off like iron or rust. 

I flipped on the light to look around. Nothing was there it was an empty room. A wave of calm washed over me knowing he was just not there. Then I hear a voice behind me. 

"Hey, Emet! What are you doing here?" He said with a smile. His sudden voice made me jump and I grabbed my chest. 

"Man! I was looking for you all day I wanted to go over a theory but you didn't answer your phone..." 

He looked at me and laughed a little "Yea, my phone died and I was coming back anyway to charge it. Here, sit. I am curious about your findings" He gestured me to the chair. I sat down and notice the floor was a little wet but I wrote it off and the smell of iron was much more pungent. I went over the story with him and my belief. He looked at me and smiled and spoke calmly. 

"It's a great theory and I like it but I highly suggest for you not delve deeper into this philosophy." Some reason he had an air of anger or agitation. "Wh...what do you mean? It could be a break trough if I can prove this!" I stood up while slamming my hands on the table. He smiled more and stared into my eyes. "Do not pursue this." I looked behind him and saw .... my professor's body... It was covered in holes and it hit me... were they following me this whole time? I had no time to think as I excused myself and walked out as calmly as possible before running down the hall and outside on campus grounds. 

I grabbed my keys with my hands shaking knowing they killed my professor... "but I saw him in front of me.. maybe some sort of shapeshifter? I... can't believe this... why are they attacking me." I got to my car and turned it over. As I checked my rearview mirror I saw "my professor" standing there with an unnaturally large smile that spreads ear to ear... I also saw about ten other people staring at me with the same uncanny smile. Before I could drive off I saw all of them release a strange screeching noise and started to fully sprint at me... I hit the gas and floored it to anywhere I can think I don't normally stay. IF these things got to my school, my professor then most likely has my friends and family. 

I called Caleb in hopes at least he was safe "C'mon pick up.... pick the fuck up!" I yelled in anger and fear. He answered the phone "what's up bro? Are you ok? You don't usually call me" He seemed genuine something that the Skinwalker thing didn't know how to do. It was subtle but Prof was never cold to me and loved to talk. "I...am going through some shit. Are you safe?" I asked while trembling in fear and adrenalin. "Yea I need to pick you up like now. So get ready I am one minute away." he just said ok and didn't even question. When I got to his house I called and he didn't pick up. When I went to the door I checked the doorknob and the scratches were there... I called again and no answer. 

I turned my video on silent... I stood there thinking what can I do? What should I do? I... don't know what came over me but I slowly opened the door. I don't know if it was the adrenalin but my body was moving on its own... I crept around looking for him and kept calling listening to his ringer. I heard it upstairs. I walked upstairs and the smell of iron was in the air it was heavy but this time... different. I opened the door and saw Caleb with a hammer over the body of some creature. It was pale-skinned with no real markings. It looked like a mannequin but it was bleeding from its head with a little bit of brain matter stuck to the hammer. 

"Caleb... let's get out of here," I whispered. Caleb turned to see me and he nodded at me and we got to the car. The blood on Caleb was dark and thick like oil. I started to drive and talk to him. 

"What the fuck was that thing Emet... was in my living room being still as if I didn't notice a mannequin in my room. It then sprung to attack me but I was too fast and ran to grab a hammer... it only took a single hit to knock it down but it was persistent... I kept hitting it and hitting it. I was so afraid... How did you know?" He was shaken up I rubbed his back and said. 

"I'm not sure man. I knew something was off when Prof. Horgeur wasn't answering my phone. I've been noticing scratch marks on the door. I am not sure if they mark the house this way but that could help. Do you know anything that can help us?" 

"Fuck man... I... I know a bunker on my dad's property that he built when Y2K was a thing. It has food for months and Wi-Fi, power, and plumbing. He's been living there ever since Mom passed a month ago. We can go there." 

Caleb and I rode to the position where the opening was in a deep forest. There was a dirt road that lead to the bunker. After about a five-minute drive. We arrived at a small concrete hut in the middle of a thick forest. "That's it," Caleb said. We got out and there was a camera pointing at the door. We hear a PA system click and we hear a "SON! How are you? Come in, come in." The door unlocks and it must've been at least three feet thick like a vault door. We've been here ever since with plenty of food to last... I read online that "God" send "Angels" to stop nonbelievers and people who sinned... Is this how "God" end his stories? Is this what happens when we get too close to the truth? I fear I set into motion a series of events that will end our story. Stay safe out there I will keep you all updated.

I attend a fairly large high school. Best guess is about 2500 students. Life has been pretty normal so far; made some friends, play basketball and lots of studying.

One day as I walking to my 5th period class, US History, I noticed a door I could have swore I have never seen before. It was located underneath the stairwell which made me assume it was just a janitor closet or electrical room.

That is, until I noticed a small sign stating that this was the classroom of “Mr. Sebastian Peters”. I never heard of a teacher by that name, but I shook it off as nothing and continued on with my day. Lunch came around soon after and, as usual, sat with my friends.

I decide to bring up the weird room I saw and the name on the door. My friends also couldn’t recall a Mr. Sebastian Peters and thought it was weird it was under the stairs. They decided to go check it out after lunch. I was hesitant at first since I didn’t want to get caught skipping class, but decided to join them.

As we walked towards the room, we could hear noises. Sounded like a class was taking place so we decided not to enter. Since class already started, we decided to hide nearby and chat.

About 45 minutes later, the bell rang. However, no one came out of the room. We were curious so decided to check the room again and saw that everyone was still sitting in class and Mr. Peters was teaching. 

Next period for us was a free period so we decided to investigate further. We slowly opened the door and Mr. Peters head quickly turned towards us. He asked what we were doing and we apologized and the made the excuse that “we got lost”. When we left the class just continued.

After school ended, my friends went home and I decided to go back to the classroom and everyone was still there. I opened the door and this time there was no reaction. I sat in the class for about 15 minutes until I hear footsteps coming from outside.

The janitor who was cleaning was shocked to see me and only looked at me. Which was weird considering there was a whole class here. He walks to me and ask what I was doing in this empty room all by myself.

Confused, I asked “what do you mean? There is a whole class here.” His eyes widen and he told me to step outside. He stared directly at me and said, “there was an incident in that room, the teacher was crazy and locked his students inside and he released some weird gas that killed everyone including himself. Everyone you saw in that room are dead.”

After hearing that, I booked it out the school and heard footsteps behind me. To my horror, it was Mr. Peters. He yelled that he “had a surprise for me and the class”. I luckily got out and never went near the room again.

To think, those poor kids are experiencing this traumatic experience everyday…

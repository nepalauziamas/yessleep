Okay so basically my friend and I were on call just playing games and talking like usual. She decided to turn her lights off because that’s how she likes it in her room. Next thing you know she sends me a picture of these two white eye looking things ( they look more inside like two white lines floating around in a completely pitch dark room ) 

She was terrified of them and I tried to do all the research I could but couldn’t find anything. So she told me more about it. So to sum it up, the “ demon “ has something that looks like white eyes and that’s all you can see, but whenever it’s near it gets/ feels super cold. She also said it was really tall I guess. 

It started from her door and slowly moved towards the foot of her bed. But the weird thing is that sometimes it would just disappear. The only thing I could find online is something called eye floaters but that’s not really possible since it is visible to more than one person or I could see it as well. She said her mom burns sage as much as she can or like every other day ( I don’t know the reason but I’m guessing to keep them safe). Oh and were she used to live she had this demon that would like crawl on top of her or pull her ankle almost taking her off the bed. She said that the current “ demon “ actually touched her or she felt a touch along her ankle/ leg.  

I am personally trying to figure out what is happening and what the thing is so I can help her, so any advice or evidence or whatever would really help and be appreciated. 


I know she isn’t lying because she is a trustworthy friend that I have known for awhile so I’m not going to say she is lying or making anything up, she does believe in ghosts or paranormal activities. Personally I do too. So is there anything I can do that would help her? And if so what? I tried looking up some ways she could get rid of the ghost but nothing really helped since it is about 11/12 at night when this is happening. Oh and yeah this happened just about an hour ago. I was on call with her while it was happening and she described everything in the best details she could. She actually won’t be spending the night in her house for the next two or three nights because of a family vacation and I don’t know if that could help or anything but it’s worth a shot. While I was writing this I started to feel colder and colder but I believe that is because I am just scared for her safety, mostly because I read something else from this sub Reddit and someone said that white eyed demons could possibly kill and I really don’t want this happening to my friend. I don’t even know if the two demons are necessarily related or if the one she is talking about even is a demon. I guess that’s what I’m trying to figure out by asking Reddit. By this point I am just trying to fill the 500 word requirements. I don’t even know if this is good enough for it. I just want to help my friend.

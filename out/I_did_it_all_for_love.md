We live in a small town, you know whay they say about small towns, everyone knows you and what you've done. 

This town is just like that. News travel very fast, and so did mine. 

The end of the world was 2 years ago, a large asteroid struck the Earth and killed almost everyone. The little that survived lives out there on their own, fighting bad people. So do we. 

As I said we build a small town and fence around it. Not that the fence can keep us safe, it's just there to make us feel that we are safe. 

You see, after the asteroid hit the Earth, something unexplainable happened. The little that survived were hunted every day by some entities, ghost, I really don't know what they are. You could only hide and pray they don't find you, because if they do you are breakfast, lunch or dinner. 

These entities take human shape, you may wonder why so much people died from them, well as I said they take human shape, human shape of someone close to the person they hunt. It's like they really become them, they know something they had no way of knowing, show emotions and play victim so someone opeans the door.

Our small town lives by a set of rules that we must follow in order to survive, if we don't we get exhailed if they don't get to us first. You see, we don't just get ourselves in danger, we get other people too. 


1. Don't go outside when the dark comes.
2. Through the day work on the fields for food.
3. Never leave the group, not even during the day.
4. Everyone who has a partner, needs to have a child so we expand.
5. Everyone is the same here.

One night, I woke up to a sound coming from downstairs. I lazily opened my eyes just to see that it's not even close to dawn. I tried closing my eyes but the sound kept going so I angrily got out of the bed and when my feet touched the cold ground I shivered but continued my journey to see where the noise was coming from. 

As I stood on top of the stairs I saw that someone was at our front porch. I peeked throught the curtains and saw a boy, not older than 20, with black hair, blue eyes waving at me. 

'Will you do me the honors and talk with me?' He said with a charming smile, while his eyes were looking directly through mine. 

I closed the curtain and slowly opened the door letting him in. 

'What are you doing here? Are you insane walking here alone at night with the entities right there?' I whispered - yelled but he just smiled and started walking towards me 

'There is nothing that could stop me from coming to you.' He said and closed the space between us by pulling me in for a hug.

I hugged him back and inhaled his amazing scent. I pulled away and took his land and led him to my bedroom where we spent the night holding each other. 

Eventually after 3 hours I fell asleep, but not much passed I woke up to someone touching my face slightly. I giggled with my eyes closed knowing who it was. When I opened my eyes Ethan was smiling down at me,

'You forgot the cross honey.'

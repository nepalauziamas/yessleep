 I am a 29 year old man with a 5year old kid and a 31 year old wife. We recently just bought a house and have been living together in our little family of three. Every things been average, I am a stay at home dad cuz my wife is the bread winner. Our kid is a boy and is usually never really a trouble maker and can be quite obedient. He goes to bed on time and it really didn´t take very long for him to learn how to use the bathroom or to walk. Although there are a couple of things that he does that can really creep me out sometimes. Like whenever I tuck into bed and say my goodnights he will sometimes stay up talking to himself but maybe he is just trying to play by himself and is including me into his little game, I agreed but then shortly after that he started doing more weird things.

 He started laughing when nobody said anything and seems attracted to the walls in his room. By that I mean he just sits in-front of them or resting his body against them. When I ask him what he is doing he says he is just "playing with a friend" but I don´t quite get it. He has started being a little more deviant recently as-well. He gets really angry when we try and get him to leave the house and sometimes gets angry when we try and get him to leave his room. He has begun talking to himself more frequently and sometimes I cannot understand what he is saying at all, as if he is speaking gibberish.

 He has started laughing differently and has begun staring at me from around corners more frequently and he doesn´t giggle when he does it anymore. He just stares and when he notices I know he is there he slowly moves away. I noticed he has bags under his eyes that a college student would have. Like he hasn´t been sleeping at all. When I asked him about it he acted as if he had no idea what I was talking about and then giggles. My wife has been noticing his creepy behaviour and has started to get worried as-well.

 She has begun calling in sick to try and comfort our child but to no avail, it´s as if he just isn´t the same as he was before. He even bit my wife´s hand at one point but because he had baby teeth she was fine. He has begun getting more and more aggresive and has been spending a lot of time just standing in random locations, not moving an inch like a statue or something. It´s really starting to freak my wife out and she has started getting scared to walk around the house by herself. Every time she sees our son she starts shaking and seems as if she´s really scared of him.

 We discussed therapy for him and have agreed that it may be the best road to go down. But whenever we try bringing up to him he lets out a deathly screech, like what you would hear if an animal was in pain. It is like it isn´t even my son anymore and I am lost as for what I am supposed to do.

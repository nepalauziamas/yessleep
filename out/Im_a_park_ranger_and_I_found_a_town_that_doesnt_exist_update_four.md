Sorry about the long wait guys, So let me explain what happened while I was gone.

Oxblood drove me to the headquarters of A.R.C. Once there Dr. Oxblood led me into his office and told me to sit down. He locked the door and sat across from me. The room was filled with bookshelves and pictures of presidents and generals from many wars. On the walls were weapons that I didn't recognize.

"So tell me about the town." He said.

"What makes you think I know anything about the town?" I asked.

"I have reason to believe you are aware of its existence." He said.

"Fine. What do you want to know?" I asked.

"Tell me everything you know about the town." He said.

"Everything?" I asked.

"All of it." He answered.

I told him about the day Thomas told me about the town, our trip to Hungry Horse and how Thomas had stayed behind to fight Irene. 

He listened intently as I spoke. He was taking notes while I talked and occasionally asked me a question.

When I finished telling him everything he wanted to know, he stood up and walked over to a cabinet and opened it. He reached inside and pulled out a small silver box and placed it on his desk.

"What's that?" I asked.

"It's a key." He answered. "One day, you'll need it."

"Why would I ever need a key?" I asked.

"You'll find out." He said. "If you really want to find out what happened to your friend and figure out what the town is, you'll use the key to unlock the secrets of the town."

"Why should I trust you?" I asked.

"I can't tell you that." He said. "You'll have to learn to trust me in time. 

He handed me the key, it was heavier than I expected it to be. I looked at it for a long moment before putting it in my pocket.

"What do you plan on doing with me?" I asked.

"You are a very valuable asset to us." He said. “We want you to become the newest Watcher of Yellowstone.”

I stared at him for a second, remembering what I read in Thomases journal. “What the hell is a Watcher, exactly?"

"It's a title given to humans who have been chosen by A.R.C. to help protect the world from the supernatural.” He said.

"Doesn't A.R.C. already have Watchers?" I asked.

"Yes, they have many Watchers but none of them have ever entered one of the towns without changing, like you. You are the first human to enter one of the towns and return without becoming a monster." He answered.

I sat there and thought about it. "So if I agree to become a Watcher, what are the risks?" I asked.

"There are no guarantees." He said. "The risk of your life, your sanity and possibly losing your humanity are all high."

"So what happens if I decline?" I asked.

"We will kill you." He answered.

I laughed. "Why do you think I'll accept?" I asked.

He smiled. "Because you want to save your best friend Thomas and you want answers."

"Are you saying you can give me those answers?" I asked.

"Not yet." He said. "But once you become a Watcher, I will be able to teach you everything you need to know."

"How long until I can become a Watcher?" I asked.

He smiled. “You’ve been a Watcher ever since you read the journal.”

I stared at him for a minute before shaking my head. "You can't be serious!" I exclaimed.

"I am completely serious." He said.

I sighed. "Alright, so what exactly do you expect me to do? I don't know any more about the towns than you do."

"I know that much." He replied.

"So why did you ask me here then?" I asked.

"To offer you a job." He said.

"A job?" I asked.

"Yes, a job as a Watcher. I want you to become one of us." He answered.

"What kind of job?" I asked.

"In order to become an official Watcher, you must become a member of A.R.C." He answered.

"What does that entail?" I asked.

"You will have to sign an agreement stating that you will work for us. You will also be required to undergo training and take a test to prove yourself." He explained.

"And what do I get in return for signing this agreement?" I asked.

"A bigger paycheck than you’ve ever seen." He answered.

I laughed. "Seriously?!"

"The pay is good." He said. "But the real benefit is the knowledge that you're helping to keep the world safe from monsters, demons and other threats to humanity. Not everyone gets that chance.”

"Sounds good to me," I said.

"Good." He said. "Congratulations."

He unlocked the door with the key and we left the room together.

On the way out, a man dressed in a park ranger uniform approached me.

"This is your new partner." Dr. Oxblood said.

"Welcome to A.R.C.," he said.

"Do you mind if I ask your name?" I asked.

"My name is John." He answered.

I shook his hand. "Nice to meet you John."

"Likewise." He said.

“Alright, well, I guess this is goodbye for now Oxblood, I'm sure I'll see you soon.” I said.

“You better hope you do.” He joked.

After leaving the building, John and I got in his car and drove off.

“So where are we going?” I asked.

"Back to your cabin.” He answered.

We arrived at my cabin, the sun was setting and the sky was getting dark. We got out of the car and headed towards the cabin.

Once inside I sat on the couch and looked at John. "So what's going to happen now?" I asked.

"That depends on you." He answered.

"What do you mean?" I asked.

John took out a bottle of whiskey and poured himself a drink. I watched as he drank most of it before answering.

"I intend to train you to become a Watcher, until then you'll be living with me." He said.

"Living with you?" I asked.

"For the next couple of months." He answered. "I'll help you get used to being a Watcher, so that when it comes time to choose your own partner, you’ll be able to keep them safe. You'll also start to learn things about A.R.C. that even some of our agents don't know.”

"What kind of things?" I asked.

"I can't really explain it to you." He answered. "It will only make sense once you’re trained."

I nodded. "Fine."

"Drink up." He said. "We need to get you settled in."

I laughed and poured myself some whiskey.

John says training begins in an hour. I’m going to take a nap before he trains me. I’ll update you guys tomorrow.

It's summer break for me, I'm a teenager and it's been pretty boring, some days when I have not much planned (most of the time) I go to the library by my mom's work and she picks me up when she gets off. It was like any other day and she was gonna pick me up on her lunch. She texted me, "see you outside!" I replied with, "alright, see you soon". A couple minutes later I walked outside, and called her. I asked how long she would be, "I'll be there in around 5" she says. But I saw her car outside. On the other side of the parking lot. Could it be a different car? Wait.. no.. it has the exact scratches from some old  boxes from a couple years ago. I walked up to her, confused as why she told me she'd be here within five minutes. I go up to her, "Hey, why did you want me to wait five minutes?" I said. "Oh, quit asking me silly questions, hun." She replied. Hun. That word stuck with me for a little bit, she never EVER referred to me as hun. Not as a baby, not as a kid, and surely not now. I repeated the question. "Stop asking me silly questions, get in my lunch is over soon." She said. I hesitated as I got into the car, confused. We were pulling out, as I noticed she seemed skinnier, taller, odd. Not like her usual self. I also noticed her arms and legs were much larger. Her neck was freakishly long, and her face didn't look like her. But like someone trying to simply mimick her, or something. As we pull out I see a text message coming from my phone. "You're always on that godamn phone!" She says as she tried to rip it out of my hands. She pries it out of my hand with the most strength I've ever felt. Ungodly, insane amount of strength. Before she can rip it out of my hands I see a notification that says,

Whoever this lady, or thing is. It's not my mother. She yells, "GIVE ME YOU'RE PHONE!" in a voice I've never heard before certaintly not from a human. She floors the petal and starts driving off, before the car can accelerate enough to kill me, I jump out. The car jumps forward. I look back, and it vanished. I look around, and I see the car one more time. It pulls into the driveway. "Run. RUN!" I hear a voice in my head say to myself. 

I book it. I start running faster then I've ever did before. 



 Says my mom. I look back at her. And run for the car. A flood of relief fills my body. I began to tell her everything that happened. Before im half way done she stops me and seems to freeze for a moment. Looking pale. 

"The Mimick' She says. Looking stunned. 
 
She explained to me that there was an old story her grandpa told her when she was young, called the Mimick. Her grandpa, or my grest grandfather had a story called The Mimick when she was around 6 or 7. He told her that when he was young he used to mess around in old abandoned places with his friends. Until one day one of his friends, Joey went into a building and he stayed outside, he said something felt off. As Joey walked inside he heard his mom yell his name. Joey went upstairs, most likely wondering why his mom was in an abandoned building. A couple minutes of silence went by, then he heard a scream. Joey never walked out of that building again. 

My great grandpa went home and told his mom, then the police the same story. They told him off, not listening to a thing he said. The only part he left out, was that when he was walking away, he saw Joey's mom through the window.  It was some sort of "demon" he believed, that was mimicking his mom. 

 He died when my mom was at a young age, and when she grew older she figured it was just an effect of his dementia. But a little part of her always thought something was off.

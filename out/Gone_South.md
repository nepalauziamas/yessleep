*Hi. I haven't been able to stop myself from sharing this. I feel obligated. I work for a secret branch of the government bent on inventing and using time travel. Our first prototype worked, sending our men 10 years into the future. After they made it back, the prototype immediately exploded, killing everyone involved with the expedition. Of everything they brought back, the only thing we managed to salvage was an old composition book. Below is what it contained. I'll surely be silenced for sharing this, but I need to get this off my chest. We all deserve to know our future, no matter how grim.*

God... I just want this to end. I don't know how whoever is reading this is still alive. Perhaps humanity somehow managed to survive and rebuilt. Doubtful. Perhaps you're an alien investigating the remains of a dead species. If it brings you any comfort, this isn't an example of the Fermi paradox... this is something else entirely. I'm actually kind of proud that we managed to die out before ending ourselves. Anyways...

It started 5 years ago.  Ha. To think that just 5 short years ago I was living a normal life! My husband, Steve, our beautiful daughter, Avery... it feels like a fantasy, a heaven compared to the sad excuse for a life I lead now. The first thing to happen was the bells. It didn't matter where you were, everyone could hear them. The constant ringing of a bell. It was like everyone on the planet was living next to a church. Countless investigations were launched into this phenomena, but no one found anything, and it chalked up to some sort of incredible mass hysteria. Then after around a week, the ringing stopped. At first, we all thought it was over. At the time it seemed like some crazy isolated incident. But now I'm starting to think that it was a warning. Perhaps a warning from God.

Then came the rain. It was like a global hurricane, except there wasn't much wind. Just a relentless downpour all over the world. The coasts sunk. Florida, Venice, you name it! All gone. But that wasn't the worst part... the rain wasn't water, it was blood. So much blood. From then on, every drop of water was tainted with blood. This was when people realized that the bells were the start of something terrible, and that there would almost certainly be more to come. Avery was only 3, she didn't understand what was happening. We kept her inside, even as blood stained the windows. I envied her ignorance. I slipped into a sort of depression and started drowning myself in social media like Reddit. Steve stopped talking to me. It had only been a month since this started, and it felt like we weren't living... just surviving. I was a fool. Looking back, it wasn't all that bad. I still had a house, I still had a family. I should've just ignored it and kept on living. But I didn't.

The rain stopped, but the bodies started. Bodies... from the sky. No one knew exactly where they came from, but they supposedly just "appeared" somewhere in stratosphere. Some of the bodies were human. Every single human body that was DNA'd matched with a long-dead person. The other dead bodies? I can't talk about them without getting sick. They were less common than the human ones, but I still saw some in our yard, as well as pictures online. They were beasts. Disgusting, terrible, beasts. Similarly to the humans, they were cut open, but all the blood had already fallen out. It was then that people finally realized where all the blood rain came from...

For a while, things were actually kind of... ok? Millions of people died during the blood rain, but besides that, everyone was more or less fine. People cleaned up the bodies, worked jobs, and went to school. Things were orderly enough, and the world went on. It seemed like things were getting better, and after a few months, the bodies stopped. For a while it seemed like it was over. Just an insane happening that people would dismiss as myth in a couple thousand years. But then the Titan fell.

It was the last of the bodies, some massive being the size of Texas. No one knows what it looks like, as anyone who looks at it or a picture of it immediately dies of a brain aneurysm. It landed in Germany, crushing the entirety of the country and killing everyone there. People theorized and debated over whatever the hell was happening, but it hardly mattered. Something terrible was happening. That was all we could really know. Y'know, before all of this, I was an atheist. But now I've managed to convince myself that the Titan was God himself. God is real. God is dead.

3 years passed, and the world slowly went to shit. Every animal in China simultaneously went rabid.  The global temperature increased 10 degrees. Healthy crops wilted for no reason. The ground would randomly open up and swallow people in New Zealand. Entire cities would commit suicide at the same time. Some of the beasts that had fallen somehow came back to life. They were more interested in killing eachother than killing humans, but millions of people died after being caught in the crossfire. Australia fucking vanished. Just gone. No explanation. Worms, parasites, and all kinds of insects that I am 100% sure did not exist before this started crawled along the streets. The sky turned red.  The Earth slowly stopped spinning. At the time of writing this, we have more than 17 years until tomorrow morning. Hackers broadcasted images of the Titan all over the world. Stars began to blink out. Once the war that the beasts had been fighting ended, they turned their attention towards humanity. The Military started drafting. They took Steve. He died in battle a week later. God.. Avery was still oblivious to it all. Still happy...

I went outside yesterday. I could hear gunshots in the distance. They were getting closer. I looked in the other direction. Smoke and fire rose from leveled buildings in the city. Luckily, I live in the suburbs. A massive canyon opened out of nowhere, consuming the entire city. Welp. I had, at best, 2 more days left. When I went back inside, Avery was crying. She had undone the shades and looked out the window.

"Mommy, I'm scared! When will Daddy come back?"

Avery had finally broken. The last bastion of normalcy had fallen.

"Don't worry honey, Mommy will keep you safe."

As I write this, Avery is asleep in my lap. The gunshots are right across the street now, and they are accompanied by human screaming, and monstrous, indescribable sounds. It's almost relaxing, knowing that soon also this torture will be over. The TV turned on. Must have fritzed out. Started playing some old news. Normal, mundane stuff. I can't believe that a single murder or politics was all people had to be scared of back then. Wow.

Things really went South.

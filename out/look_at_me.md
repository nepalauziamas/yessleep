                     "i'm gonna jump in the lake now!"



"When im not visiting my parents, i sleep at my house. I have a nightlight. I was in a coma for 3 months. Im 24. I know, 24 years old, rich dude, has a dog, has a maid, and still has a nightlight. It would be a different case if you had lived in this apartment. 

A couple months ago, i was sleeping soundly in bed. 
It was around midnight. My stairs creaking woke me up. I heard footsteps. Of course i was freaked out, i live alone. I first i thought it was a burglar. So i got my bat and opened the door. When i turned on the lights, there was no one there, i checked the doors, they were locked. I checked the windows, they were locked too. I was confused at first, but i let it slip my mind assuming it was my dog, theo. But when i woke up in the morning, i found footsteps in the kitchen that wasn't there last night. The maid just cleaned yesterday afternoon. And nobody has been in this house for weeks. Except for me of course. I just shrug it off and thought maybe it was me. 

The day after that, i woke up at midnight again, only to see a pair of eyes peeking from my closet. I tried to get my phone to call 911, but i couldn't move, slowly but surely, it came out of the closet. I couldn't even scream. I tried to reach for my bat, but i still couldn't move. I woke up in a cold sweat, it was a nightmare. I slept again, only to have the same nightmare. but this time,  it wasn't in my head. I tried to scream. I tried to run. I tried everything. It didn't work. But at last i finally ran when he was 4 inches away from me. I grabbed my bat and ran to the kitchen. I thought i was safe. The next thing i see is him. He talked. He said "you remember your little sister, sophia? at the lake?" i let out a gasp as he said it. "HOW DO YOU KNOW ABOUT THAT! ONLY MY FAMILY KNOWS ABOUT THAT!" "let me take you back in time." he says. Suddenly, im back at the lake, with my family,  my sister is trying to get my attention. "hey! Look at me! I'm gonna jump in the lake now!" she says. "if youre so brave then i'll push you!" I wasn't really paying attention. But what i should have done is pay more attention. I didn't realize that the lake was 6 feet deep. Sophie didn't have floaties. "I'M DROWNING HELP! HELP!" she says as she sinks. "yeah right dingus your not drowning" i said. I thought she was messing with me. I left her alone to swim to get a drink. But when i came back, her body was just floating in the middle of the lake. "SOPHIE!  DONT GO TOO FAR!" i said.  No response. "SOPHIE? STOP MESSING WITH ME SOPH!" but then i realized that she wasn't messing with me. I jumped in to get her, i swam to her. "sophie? sophie? SOPHIE! WAKE UP!"

I went back to reality as my screams faded. "NO!  NO!  IT WASN'T MY FAULT!  I DIDN'T KNOW IT WAS SO DEEP!" "it was your fault. Somewhere deep inside your heart you wanted her to drown." he says. "NO!  I DIDN'T MEAN TO!" i say as i break down crying on my floor. "you did. And thats why you deserve to die. Up for a little reunion with your beloved sis?" he gets a knife and stabs me. I woke up in the hospital. Apparently the maid found me. I was in a coma for 4 months. They said i nearly died. I'm glad i'm safe now. Or so i thought. I was in my hospital bed, healing. He came again. And not to kill me. To torture me for eternity. Everywhere i go, he follows. He comes to me in my dreams. I cant go anywhere without seeing his face anymore. It still haunts me. The police haven't caught him yet." i think it'll be a different story for my next victim.

I have a twin sister, an older brother, and a younger sister. Growing up everyone was perfectly happy, Our mother is a very kind person, and our father not so much. My twin sister was always the best kid. She did everything in her power to please our parents. I always believed she had a strange complex about stuff like that. Taking my dads shoes to him, constantly asking them if they needed water or food if we would all be sitting somewhere, fetching things all the time. You get the idea.

She was only like this towards my parents, and seemed to resent or judge me for not behaving the same way. In my defense a lot of it seemed unnecessary a lot of the time and a lot of the things she did never crossed my mind. But I would catch her glaring at me in a crazy way often. When she would get back from bringing my parents something, or completing a task she would often stare at me as if she had just won a goddamned medal or something. It was uncomfortable.

When we were 7, my sister tried to kill me. I don’t remember much. But all the adults and some aunts and uncles of ours were home. We were playing, and suddenly she was giving me that look. She pulled a knife out and told me she wanted to kill me in the happiest voice you could possibly say that phrase in. At first I thought she was joking. I knew she was a little demented, but something in my bones was telling me she wasn’t. She chased me out of the house with the knife screaming and laughing. Our house was on a col de sac and we had a long drive way. Everyone followed out at the commotion and my parents were able to take the knife from her. I was cut up in a few spots, and she was livid. 
The neighbors had seen what had happened and called the cops. I don’t remember what happened or why among this time, but it resulted in her going to a mental hospital for a long time. For such a long time that none of us knew exactly when she’d be back. 

My mom and dad never seemed to show any distress of the situation. When we were younger we would occasionally visit. The place was hours away from our house, and I was never exactly affected by the events. I knew she had a few loose screws. I knew she got everything she ever wanted, no matter what it took. She was just wired that way. The visits got weirder and weirder. She was never excited to see any of her siblings. She would ignore us, only talking to my parents. Once we all hit high school we stopped visiting. We figured it would make her happy. 

My parents and I had a naturally good relationship. My siblings and I were all extremely close, seeing that we were all so close in age. We all loved each other and did everything together. My older brother stayed home for college, as did I. We commuted to the nearest cal state in the area together. My younger sister got into UCLA, and we were all extremely proud of her, my parents threw her a big party and we were all just a happy family. 

When I turned 20, my sister was allowed to come back home. My parents explained she would be living with us, and that she would be taking the bedroom adjacent to mine. They said she was completely better. They said she had a personality disorder as a child, and that she had learned to control it and was on medication. She was no longer a threat to anybody. She was meant to be enrolling in the community college in our city and begin to function as a member of society once more. 

They picked her up. She was home when I got home from school. She seemed happy to see me, contrasting some visits where she wouldn’t even look in my direction. She came at me with a big hug and her wonky smile on her face. I returned the same energy. She seemed so excited to be home. 

I gave her some of my time, talking about school and how I could help her with community if she had any questions. But she kept asking me things about my private life that I didn’t feel comfortable sharing with someone who was practically a stranger. Things like “Are you a virgin” and weirder and weirder questions. I got uncomfortable and annoyed. And it was a little before I had to drive to LA to pick up our younger sister, so I took the opportunity to announce I was leaving to go get her. She quickly jumped up and was so excited to come along and pick up her “little sis”. As we were leaving, she walked directly behind me down the long driveway. The hairs on the back of my neck stood up the entire walk. We finally reached my car, where we talked music and discovered we liked a lot of the same artists. I was finally feeling okay again. We picked up our little sister just fine, and made it back home, where our older brother had just made it home as well. 

Dinner time was in two hours, so everyone naturally retreated to their rooms. I kept my door shut and locked. I always did that, even when we were younger. I had music playing, but I caught the door knob shaking a few times and lowered the music. I waited for whoever was outside to say something, but they didn’t so I went back as I was. I heard a loud thump come from my younger sisters room, which I thought was odd but didn’t bother to check it out, then I heard the door across the hall shut very aggressively. This is where my heart started beating faster. I didn’t lower the music because then it would draw attention to the fact that I had heard something.

I heard another thump from my brothers room, and again heard my twin sisters door shut aggressively. At this point I knew something was wrong. I knew I should climb out of the window, but she would be able to see me from her bedrooms window. I called the police but in this area they never come, if they do it had to be where you’re literally about to die. They also make you call different stations since we live in one city but since we’re near the border the police station that serves us is the one from the city right next to us. As i’m sitting on my bed figuring out what to do next, my door flies open. I don’t see anyone who could’ve opened it, and it was locked. Panicked, I quickly shut it and lock it again. It happens a few seconds after, and I catch a glimpse of my sister, near the stairs. Looking at me in the way she always did when we were younger. I nervously laughed and asked her what she was up to. She told me she has made a special dinner for us. She wanted us to all enjoy it as a family. In my mind I just heard a voice saying “Run.” on repeat. I reached for my car keys which were usually hanging on a hook next to my door. But they weren’t there. I responded I would love dinner, and followed her downstairs. She could tell i was looking around for something, and asked me what. I didn’t see any of our other family members in the house anymore. Our home has an open layout. No one was upstairs when we came down here, and no one was downstairs either. I didn’t ask, but i told her i had forgotten my charger in my car, and I needed to go get it. She calmly pointed at my keys, conveniently placed on the doorway entrance table. I knew I hadn’t left them there. 

She watched my every move. Every step and breath I took was being analyzed by her crazy ass. I do not care why or what the hell is wrong with her. We are all perfectly fine without her. I knew she had done something to ensure the house was empty, just her and I. I opened the front door and she began trying to spark a conversation, following me out, down the driveway. At the beginning, she was calm. Then she increasingly got more and more aggressive in the things she was saying. I begin walking away faster and faster, starting to sweat. I finally whipped around and snapped. “I’ve never disrespected you, I don’t hate you despite anything. We could have been an amazing duo. YOU ruined it. YOURE the fucking crazy one. And God knows what the fuck else you’ve done or are doing RIGHT NOW.” I turned, and started running from her. She looked shocked for about two seconds, then she had that crazy look on her face.

She began screaming. She yelled that I had stolen her life, that i was always out to get her and she wasn’t going to let me win. That it was my fault our parents sent her away. At this point, I reached my car. I had to get it out of the parking area we had which took a few minutes tops, But she was right behind me and I was trying to hurry. I could see her next to all her things she had brought with her, Suddenly she stopped coming at me and pulled a bag. At this point i had only begun pulling out of the driveway. I saw her in the rear view mirror holding s rifle. She screamed at the top of her lungs that I wasn’t getting away this time. I knew I wouldn’t make it out of the cul de sac. I took one last glance at her and reversed my car at full speed. She shot the gun and the bullets flew upward hitting my car and towards the sky. Her body hit the trunk, I pulled forward and ran over and over her body, making sure I finished the job. I was so anxiety ridden. My head started spinning and I didn’t want to get out of the car. I heard sirens on the way. I drove the car off of her body, and got out of the car. It wasn’t a pretty sight. But her face. Her eyes were open, and she was smiling. Even though I was heart broken it came to this. I felt a smile I couldn’t stop inching its way onto my face.

Today my Dad finally allowed me to start using Reddit! He's been very nervous about this. He even wrote me a list of subreddits not to look at. Of course that makes me really curious, but I always do what Daddy says so there's no way I'm actually gonna check any of them out. 

So… hello Reddit! How are you? My name is Maggie. I live in a huge house with my Dad and a lot of other people he says need to be "under close observation and close to medical treatment at all times". When I asked him what that meant, he told me we all need to be watched by doctors and nurses here so in case something happens to us, they can take care of that. Apparently, we're all sick in one way or another. Personally, I feel fine so I'm not sure why I'm here at all. I've been asking Dad but he never gives me an actual answer, he just kind of talks around the subject whenever I bring it up.

Another weird thing is that none of the other patients have their parents with them. I think they're all older than me though so I guess it's not *that* strange. Dad is around me literally all the time. Well, not all the time, but quite often. When he's not with me, he talks to the nurses and doctors or he goes into his office. He works here too.

Once a day, I have to talk to a doctor myself. Her name is Ellie and she's very nice to me, but not to Dad. She never lets him stay when she talks to me. Apart from that, I like our daily appointments though. Her room is very nice. There's a lot of photos of ducks on the walls and she even has a stuffed duck on her desk. She lets me hold it everytime I talk to her. Ducks are her favorite animals. Dr Ellie never really examines me, she just asks questions. Today for example, after she told Dad to wait for me outside and had me sit down across from her, she asked how I was feeling. That's always her first question. 

I said I was well and asked to hold the duck. She gave it to me and then asked how my day had been so far, what I'd had for breakfast, that sort of thing. It was just small talk. Then she asked me if I'd had that dream again.

See, I have these nightmares sometimes. They're really fuzzy and unclear, but basically, I dream of men in weird dark clothes. They always have these masks on that cover their faces and leave out only the mouths and eyes. Sometimes, I dream that they're holding me down and that one of them keeps shouting stuff at me while I'm crying.

"Not last night," I said to her. 

"That makes you nightmare-free twenty nights in a row," she replied. She was smiling, but she didn't sound too happy. "I'm sure you don't miss them."

"They scare me for a little while but all in all, they're just dreams. That's what Daddy says."

Dr Ellie frowned. "That's what your Daddy says, huh," she repeated. "Right… I know I ask you this a lot as well, but has your Dad ever done anything to hurt you?"

I shook my head no.

"Never? Or maybe not hurt you, but did he tell you odd things? Or did he do anything to make you feel strange in any way?"

I shook my head no again.

Dr Ellie didn't look satisfied. "Well, that's good."

"Why would my Dad do something like that?" I asked.

"Nevermind it. I just thought I'd ask. A lot of kids have very mean parents after all," she replied. 

"That's sad but my dad isn't like that."

"That's great, Maggie. That's all I wanted to hear." 

"You don't like my dad, do you?"

Dr Ellie tensed up a bit. "That's not true. Your dad and I have a history though, we go way back, so to speak. And there's a lot I can't tell you because it's… well, between him and me and our colleagues, you know?"

I told her I didn't get that at all but she didn't want to tell me anything else. Our time was up after that anyways so I got back out where Dad was waiting for me. I saw him and Ellie glare at each other for a split second through the open door. 

But the really weird thing happened afterwards. I wanted to take a nap so Dad came with me to tuck me in. He stayed by my bedside until I was already half-asleep before turning to leave. I heard him shut the door behind him, and just one second later, he gasped. I sat up immediately, startled. 

"What are you doing here?" I heard him hiss at whoever was outside with him.

"Could ask you the same thing. I thought you'd agreed on giving her space." The voice was Dr Ellie's. She didn't sound like she does when she talks to me though. She sounded angry. "Jack, what exactly do you think you're doing?" 

"Can we please take this somewhere else?" Dad replied in a hushed tone.

"What, are you afraid she'll hear us?"

"Of course I am! Move along now, we're going to your office."

"Are we? Because I'm staying right here."

Dad sighed deeply. "I don't have time for this. Why would I want to deal with your crap in the first place?"

"Then maybe I should talk to her myself. This has been going on for long enough anyways…"

"The hell you will. Because I…" I heard my door being locked. "…have the only key to her room as of now. She's asleep in there, so if you try and talk to her from out here like an idiot, I'll tell her it was all a dream. Meanwhile, I'll be off and get security and when I come back, you'll be rid of your job, I promise." Dad sounded really casual when he said this, but with that kind of concealed rage people carry in their tone sometimes.

Dr Ellie didn't say anything for a little while. When she spoke up again, she sounded almost sad. "This is sick. You are so sick, Jack."

"Oh, you think? Well, I don't really care, to be honest. And before you ask, no one else does. In fact, do you really think our bosses gave her to you, you who graduated rock bottom of your class, the most inexperienced shrink of everyone they've got, because they want her to get better?" Noticing he'd raised his voice, Dad suddenly fell silent. I could hear him press up against the door. "Maggie?" he asked softly. 

I didn't respond. I gave him no sign I was awake at all. Something about what I'd just heard made me feel like I shouldn't.

Dad let out a sigh of relief. "I'm gonna get lunch now," he said to Dr Ellie, quieter this time. "You should think about what I said though. Really, think about it."

I heard him walk off, followed by the clacking of Dr Ellie's heels on the floor. 

"Not sticking around after all? Good choice," Dad said just before they were too far away for me to hear them anymore.

I tried to sleep a little bit, but I kept thinking about the two of them. None of what they'd been talking about made any sense to me. Eventually, Dad came back to get me. I was really happy when he did because I had been getting bored. He took me out to the hall where everyone eats and told me to get myself something on my own since he had to get back to work. I wasn't happy about it but I saw Jonah sitting at a table in the back so once Dad was off, I went to sit with him. 

Jonah is my friend. I love talking to him but I only do it when Dad isn't around. My father really hates him for some reason. Once, the two of them actually got into a fight, like a real fistfight. A couple of nurses had to break it off. 

Jonah's about Dad's age. He's taller though and very strong, but not scary. He lost his right leg, although he won't tell me how, and the people here have been building a new one for him. They're still working on it and he needs to get used to it first, so he can't go anywhere without crutches. That's also why I was so scared when Dad attacked him that one time. Since Jonah was trying to hit him back, I thought he was going to trip and fall over, but he could actually stand for a whole minute without his crutches. Them fighting was terrible, but I overheard one of the nurses later saying that at least now they knew Jonah was adapting to the mechanical leg. 

I've asked him thousands of times why he doesn't get along with Dad, but he always dodges the question. I like him anyways. He has this really nice smile and when we talk, he doesn't treat me like I'm a dumb kid; more like we're old friends. 

"Hey Maggs," he said when I sat down across from him. He was holding a large slice of pizza. There was a carton with more sitting in front of him and he nodded down at it. "You want some?"

I thanked him and took a slice of my own. "How are you?" 

"I'm alright. It's pizza day. Doesn't get much better than this, does it? Not around here at least." He hummed as he ripped a large bite from the slice in his hand. 

"Do they make the pizza here?"

Jonah laughed. "Hell no, they don't. If they did it would be just as shitty as the rest of their food. But that's hospitals for you."

"Wait, so this is a hospital? Never thought of it as one." 

"Sorta. Sorry, I just forgot I'm not supposed to talk to you about that." He rolled his eyes at an imaginary bystander.

"What do you mean by that?"

"Nothing. Just… something that's been going for way too long. One of these days I might just forget altogether."

"Forget what?"

"To keep my mouth shut." 

This freaked me out a little but he wouldn't say anything else so I stopped prodding. We ate in relatively comfortable silence, but Jonah ate faster than me… and about twice as much. When there was nothing left, he wiped his mouth and smiled at me. "Come over here. I've something to show you."

I quickly ducked under the table and emerged on Jonah's side where I sat down. He lifted his prosthetic leg up on the bench beside us and pulled up the bottom of his sweatpants. I almost jumped in my seat. Jonah's mechanical leg is black and made of some kind of shiny metal, or at least I think so. But what he showed me looked completely different. There was skin over it and it appeared rather soft. 

"Oh my God," I muttered. 

"It's amazing, right? I can't even feel anything off about this anymore. I can move it perfectly, it looks exactly like it used to… well, I used to have hair on it, but that's fine." 

"That's so great, congrats!"

"I know! They finally finished it. I know we were off to a rocky start and at first… well, you saw me, you know I was struggling. But now… this was worth the wait. I still keep my crutches at hand 'cause I don't wanna test my luck just yet. But I'm really positive about this. My doc says he wants me relaxing and getting used to it for six more months and then I can start working again. Can't wait." 

"Wait, what *do* you work as?" 

"Oh, I did the same thing as you." 

"What?" I looked at him, my eyes wide with confusion. "I've never had a job."

Jonah sighed. "Yes, right. How could I forget."

"You're being kinda weird," I admitted. 

"Am I? Sorry. I don't even notice anymore." 

Not long after, I saw my Dad enter the hall. I was still sitting with Jonah so I immediately started freaking out and wanted to hide under the table, but my friend grabbed my arm–gently, but firmly–to keep me seated. My father proceeded towards us with a deep frown on his face. He didn't even acknowledge Jonah's presence when he came to a halt in front of us. 

"Maggie, princess. Did you eat?" His voice was strained, even though he was trying to hide it. I nodded. Dad raised his brows. "Good. Sorry I was gone for so long. I'll be off again soon, too, but I got the computer room wide open for you so you can play in there." 

"Thanks, Dad." I scrambled down from the bench, walked over to him and took his hand. Before we left, he addressed Jonah. I was stunned, to be honest.

"How are you adjusting?" 

Even Jonah himself seemed puzzled. "Can't complain. You did a good job on this one, man."

My father ignored the compliment. I was a little surprised. I didn't know Dad was one of the people who had created Jonah's leg. I'd known he worked here, sure, but until now, I had never thought about what he actually did exactly. We turned to leave and Dad walked me to the computer room. This room, as the name implies, is filled with computers. The patients may use it from time to time, but they have to share with the research assistants. Dad says that's because they need to work but aren't important enough to have their own office. 

That's when Dad explained Reddit to me and gave me the list of subreddits I can't look at and everything. This site is really cool. Feels like there's everything the internet has to offer here. That aside, I actually got curious so I did some research on prosthetics such as Jonah has. It seems they're actually not very common outside of this place. That really makes me wonder a bit. Just another odd thing about this hospital, I guess. 

But the strangest thing, the reason why I'm writing this, happened afterwards. I didn't feel like surfing the web anymore so I went to my room to change clothes so I could go take a walk outside in the yard. I opened the door to find something lying on the floor. It was a photo. Surprised, I bent down to pick it up. My stomach turned when I laid eyes on the picture and I felt bile rise in my throat.

It was a monster. It sounds childish and very rude saying that since I know very well it must have been a person at some point but it didn't look like one anymore. They were lying in a hospital bed not unlike those I'd seen in some of the rooms here in this building, but the sheets were soaked with blood and some other yellowish fluid. Their lower half was covered by a blanket. From what I could see, there was hardly any skin left on their body. Instead, it hung shredded off their limbs and torso. It reminded me of what it looks like when deers shed the skin on their antlers. The lower part of one of the person's arms was missing, leaving behind only a stump from which a broken bone protruded. 

The person's scalp was torn up badly and chunks of hair were hanging down from bits and pieces of it. The worst thing however were the eyes. Don't get me wrong, the eyes were the only thing about them that were left unharmed, but they were wide open and looking right at me. The person had looked into the camera when the picture had been taken. This mangled mess of a body… it wasn't a corpse. At the time of the photo, they had to have been alive. 

I doubled over and threw up on the floor. The picture slid out of my hand. I sat there for minutes, retching and weeping. The door was still open a crack so it was no surprise when one of the male nurses, I think his name's Ethan, who was just passing by noticed me and came in. He found me kneeling there beside that awful picture, grabbed me by the arm and pulled me to my feet. He half dragged, half carried me into the mess hall where he sat me down on a bench. He tried to talk to me but I couldn't hear what he said; I could hear his lips moving but it sounded like his voice was nothing but the faint sound of static somewhere far off in the distance. 

I was panting and crying. I remember thinking it was really hard to breathe. It sounds silly now, but I suppose I thought I was going to die. That's how terrified I was. Two other nurses came up to us, one of them was Cassandra, another friend of mine. She pushed through to me and quickly made me swallow a tiny pill. She then gently grabbed my ankles and lifted my legs up onto the bench, turning me around in the process. When she spoke, her voice was clearer than Ethan's. She was very calm and just the sound of her speaking, softly telling me to breathe more slowly, was enough to soothe my nerves a little. Meanwhile, Ethan and the other lady had jogged off in different directions, one was heading for the hallway my room is in and the other to where the doctors have all their offices, presumably to find Dad.

I fell asleep before they came back. When I woke up, I was in my room again, lying in bed. It's very late at night now as of me writing this, but after having slept so much already, I guess it's no surprise that I'm kind of restless. One of the nurses must have removed the picture because I can't find it anywhere. I sneaked out to the computer room again because I really didn't feel like staying where I was. So that's where I'm at now. I'm so confused. I've never questioned this place before but now, I feel like something really bad is going on here. I feel like Ellie and Jonah both wanted to tell me and that the picture has something to do with it. Worse yet, I'm pretty sure Dad knows.

We were stationed out at \[Information Redacted\], our orders simply being to secure and occupy the location until told otherwise. The neighboring environs—roughly six kilometers of sprawling forest—held no other buildings or man-made structures of any kind. We were alone, holed up in a time-forgotten shithole; a squad comprised of two teams, neither having had much groundwork before the aforementioned orders. We assumed it was busywork; that command would at some point recommission the building, and needed someone to keep the lights on until then.  

The place’s layout was simple, a large, cross-shaped building, each wing a corridor, each housing a dozen small, empty, window-less rooms—six per side. Their purpose(s), and the purpose of the building itself, was not told to us; and we made little effort to find out. It wasn’t our job to investigate—we'd merely been ordered to sweep the immediate area, establish a perimeter, and hold out until our CO radioed new orders.  

What was supposed to be a simple, albeit boring night quickly became a nightmarish one; one from which only myself and another escaped.  

I was sitting in what acted as the building’s break-room/mess hall, a room somewhat larger than the rest, situated at the center of the cross structure. There were a few communal tables, all free of clutter and debris, and some shelves and cabinets—these devoid of any food or utensils. Thankfully, we’d brought rations, and myself and McCormick weren’t scheduled for gate duty until later in the night. Sitting at the table nearest the room’s entrance—so as to hear if anything came up—we snacked on MREs and sipped from black, lukewarm coffee; Clayton had found a coffee maker in one of the rooms, but the janky thing hadn’t been able to heat up the water more than a few degrees above room temp. While we “dined”, McCormick and I discussed the usual bullshit: girls, movies we’d heard of but hadn’t yet seen, existential fears—and girls.  

We were out of our seats and heading down the corridor toward the “bottom” of the cross even before our radios chirped—we’d heard the scream echo from down the hall. Halfway down, Warrington radioed us, his voice frantic, on the verge of hysterics. 

“No! You can’t do that! That’s my son!” Even if he hadn’t sounded so wildly unhinged, I would’ve picked up speed, anyway. That line was bizarre, disconcerting—Warrington didn’t have a kid; was barely old enough to be considered an adult, himself.  

We reached the building’s exit, weapons instinctively drawn. I swept my sights left and right, spotting nothing, and hurried on toward the gate and the guard station, where Warrington had been posted for first shift’s watch. McCormick swore and pointed toward the gate, and I let out a similar expletive; the gate was open, had been *wrenched open* by something; the cross-section of metal torn apart like a can’s peeled lid.  

I motioned for McCormick to cover the gate and then peered into the guard box, flicking my flashlight mount on as I scanned the interior. The light was off, and the TV Warrington had found beneath the desk-like perch was smashed; bits of glass and plastic casing littered the shelf and floor. There was no blood, which I found somewhat relieving, although the sight of the gate kept that relief from blossoming into hope at Warrington’s safety.  

Absolutely not prepared for this kind of situation, I told McCormick to radio the rest of the squad and get them down to this wing of the building. When I didn’t hear a response, or even the click and static of the radio’s activation, I turned around, and saw McCormick kneeling on the dirt, with his hands on his face; his weapon lying at his side. 

I told him to pick up his carbine three times, but he ignored me, and it wasn’t until I took a step toward him that I realized he was sobbing. Quietly, almost inaudibly, but definitely sobbing; streaks of tears glistened in the light of my flashlight attachment as I shined it on his face.  

“It’s removed itself from the four crossed arms...from the embrace of The Nothing, of Life, and Death, and Time. I don’t want to be that old. No one should have to be that old. Everyone deserves a grave...” his voice trailed off, and then, as if grabbed by some invisible hand, he was lifted from the ground and raised several meters into the air. 

Every nerve in my body screamed for me to run—or to fire in the general area above McCormick’s dangling body. But I obeyed neither impulse, couldn’t have, if I wanted to. I was frozen, immobilized by a creeping terror. I was suddenly and powerfully overcome by a sense of futility; something told me that any action would be useless, that I was in the presence of something that couldn’t be escaped from or combated.  

McCormick, still sobbing insensibly, let his hands fall, and he then had the appearance of a puppet dangling by its strings. I called out to him, my voice softer than I would’ve liked, but despite the low volume he looked up, as if he’d heard me.  

I wish he hadn’t. The look in his eyes, that despair-filled gaze, it was the most awful thing I’d ever seen. I recoiled from it, stumbled backwards into the surface of the guard post. I couldn’t look away, though; my eyes were locked onto his, as if the gloom therein was intoxicating. It was the gaze of a man who had seen horrors beyond the comprehension of men and gods alike; inexpressibly eldritch things.  

McCormick let out a low, forlorn moan, a deathlessly hollow croaking, that then ended in a bloody gurgle as his head abruptly collapsed.  

*Something* had crushed his skull, of that I was immediately certain as I crawled backwards into the guard post, my carbine cradled uselessly in my arms. McCormick’s body swayed left and right for a few moments, as if the thing holding it were mocking me, making a show of its gruesome deed. Then the corpse was launched toward the trees beyond the busted gate. A few bits of skull and brain matter rained down as the body arced skyward, pelting the dirt with their bloody flecks.  

There was no door to the guard post, so I felt immediately and horrifyingly vulnerable now that the thing’s attention had left McCormick and was, presumably, refocusing onto me. Backed into a corner—a box, of all things—with no other recourse, I flicked the safety off and fired out the threshold. 

The air rippled, the bullets striking *something*; but there was no shower of blood, nor were there any cries of agony or frustration. I fired full-auto until the magazine ran dry, then ejected it and slotted in another, nearly ripping the pouch off my vest in the process; but something stayed my finger from firing again, some sense that it would be utterly useless. I waited, anticipating capture by the same invisible force that had seize and mutilated McCormick, but nothing happened; and I eventually got up from the floor of the post; my ears ringing from the unfiltered gunfire.  

My foot sent a shell casing rolling, and I almost jumped out of my boots. Still partly in the guard post, I swept my weapon across the vacant lot, scanning for even the slightest movement. Outside the compound’s grounds, the trees swayed in a slight breeze, and some animal, perhaps having been awoken by the gunfire, chittered loudly in the distance. But beyond this normal activity there was nothing to see, nothing to hear.  

Something felt wrong—aside from the obvious—and mustering up the courage to leave the ostensible safety of the post, I realized what it was: The other men hadn’t yet come; there were eight others, not counting McCormick and myself, and they should’ve come running at the sound of gunfire. At the very least, they should’ve radioed asking what’s wrong; but neither my radio nor McCormick’s had gone off at any point. With a trembling hand, I checked mine, and my heart stank as I uselessly fiddled with the knobs and buttons. It was dead. I then knew, without having to go trudging through the dark to find it, that McCormick’s would be dead, as well. Something had interfered—was probably still interfering—with the electronics in the area.  

The silence, thus fully acknowledged, fired my nerves; setting off primeval alarms of danger and panic with the most animal parts of my psyche. Barely able to hold onto my rifle, I made my way back toward the compound, thinking only that I needed to get in touch with *someone;* that I was, without a doubt, woefully unprepared for whatever the fuck was going on.  

Reaching the entrance to the building, I stepped inside, and a wave of panic rose and crashed down on my mind. There was *something* in the building, something I knew to be utterly inhuman, and inarguably hostile. I sensed this at once, and had to steady myself against the threshold, the feeling so overwhelming that I would’ve doubled over, otherwise. The building housed something evil.  

After taking a moment to steel myself against the dreadful unknown—as much as I could, anyway—I pushed on, whilst allowing my mind to recede somewhat; so that my body, the little training that I’d had, could take over and guide me. I cleared vacant room after room, keeping silent as I investigated the unsettlingly quiet building. The lights were all on, and yet I kept my flashlight shining; not wanting to risk being left totally blind in a sudden blackout.  

Eventually, I finished searching all four wings, and doubled back to the entrance. I’d found nothing, and was on the verge of hysterics; there was simply no trace of the rest of my team, nor of the squad at large. The only unusual thing I had found was that all of the clocks—each room had one—were all set to different times. Not a single clock was in time with another. Most were off by hours from the actual time.  

As I stepped back out into the night—lit eerily by a far-flung moon—I realized that I was getting tired, *really* tired; exhaustion swelling and blossoming throughout my body at an alarming rate. I wanted to rest, for just a moment, and considered the guard post. Something about the building behind me, despite its securable doors and defensible walls, seemed unsafe—exposed in a way I couldn’t define. And yet the guard post, with its lack of a door and uncomfortable proximity to the ravaged gate, seemed, weirdly, more secure—safer.  

I flicked off my light and slung my rifle over my shoulder, oddly confident that I wouldn’t be needing it for a while. With each footstep I took toward the eight-foot box, another layer of lethargy came over me. By the time I reached the entrance, I felt drunk, and stumbled into the small room. I tossed my weapon onto the little shelf, carelessly swiped away the shards of the destroyed TV, knelt in the resultant debris, and rested my head on the newly cleared space.  

I slept through the night, dreamlessly, peacefully, unbothered.  

I woke up to find myself covered in dust and cobwebs, and had a short-lived panic attack—I've always been afraid of spiders. But after a moment of self-examination and deep breathing, I assured myself that there weren’t any spiders spinning new webs on me, and rose clumsily from my prostrated position. 

The morning sunlight was relatively dim, and yet I still had to shield my eyes from it; as if I hadn’t seen the sun in days, weeks. Looking around, I saw with both awe and disquietude the state of the compound. What before had simply been a disused building was now a crumbling, derelict one; its outer walls cracked and chipped, as if having endured countless cycles of natural battering. Where before there had been bits of flesh and brain matter, there was now only dust on the ground; a thick, ashen layer of it; bearing neither footprints nor scuff marks to indicate that anyone or anything had passed through in recent times. There was an air of deep antiquity and dissolution on and about everything.  

Instinctively, I reached for my carbine, and at first thought that I had grabbed the wrong thing; but turning I saw that I wasn’t mistaken, that I’d grabbed my weapon, only now it was a rusted, dust-choked relic; clearly inoperative. I set it back on the shelf and stepped out into the dilapidated lot. 

I figured I should still go back inside the building and do another search. Something had clearly happened during my strange, almost spell-induced nap. But a voice in my head told me that it would be pointless; that there’d be no use in conducting another search, because there was nothing in there to find. This “nothing” having in it a greater suggestion of...*absence*, than the basic, literal sense.  

Listening to this voice, I instead went toward the front gate. In the interim since I'd last seen it, the broad doors had fallen off their hinges, leaving no obstruction whatsoever for entrance and exit. With a final, somber glance back at the facility—whose purpose I still have yet to uncover—I headed toward the forest, toward the civilization beyond it, to report what had happened.  

Two weeks have passed, and I’ve only now been allowed the freedom to go about my life without militarily escort—though I am doubtlessly still under surveillance. While detained at \[REDACTED\], I was subjected to rigorous debriefing sessions by several different officers of varying ranks and even branches, and was ultimately forced, under threat of imprisonment or worse, to sign several lengthy NDAs—all in the absence of a lawyer. I was not offered an attorney, and my requests for one were all summarily denied. I did manage to find out that corporal Warrington, the man who had been on first watch at the guard gate at the start of terrifying night, had somehow managed to escape. I learned this from a slip of the tongue by one of the interrogating officers. A small point of happiness in an otherwise dismal ordeal.  

But I lost a friend at the facility, McCormick, and presumably more—if their absences are anything to go by—and I can’t just let them be forgotten; can’t let their deaths be swept under the rug. I don’t care what happens to me. People need to know.

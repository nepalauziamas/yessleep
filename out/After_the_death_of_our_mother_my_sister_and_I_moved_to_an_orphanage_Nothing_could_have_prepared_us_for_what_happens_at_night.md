My momma’s last word was, ‘oh.’  It was a small word—scarcely bigger than the million weightless breaths that came before it, barely a word at all. But I heard it. It escaped the cold silence and the snow-swallowed hum of the engine. The road curved right and I watched the trees beside it getting closer and closer until—*crunch.*

It wasn’t really a crunch, but I don’t think I could write a word for the sound and do it justice. For years it was a sound of nightmares for me, a quick metallic peal of thunder, of clinging terror supplanted only by the sound of a creaking door. But I’ll get to that. 

The tree branch that snapped and came through the windshield was a sight to accompany the crunch. I was in the backseat with my sister Riley. I remember her mumbling, “there’s leaves in the car Cassandra. Look.”  Then she passed out and I stared at the branch that pointed into the car like a finger of death straight at my momma’s chest. 

I screamed alone, but no one answered. Riley was sleeping. Momma was dead. 

—

*They’ve got no family.  Poor dears.*

I heard a lot of sad variations of that early on at the Blair House for Girls and I wondered if they didn’t say it of all the orphans that passed their threshold. No parents was part of the package; *no family* made it seem like the condolence was rehearsed. A polite statement of the obvious that showed us that our new wardens had some claim to our grief. 

I had a family—Riley. She had me. But where I was just another poor dear, Riley was a bonafide beacon for sympathy. She had lost an eye in the crash and the displacement of the door and the driver’s seat had broken both of her legs. The doctors fixed one leg well enough, but the other set wrong. She walked with a cane after that. 

During those first days while Riley recovered, I was alone. Or I felt alone. I slept in a room with two other orphans in two bunk beds. I suppose that all of us were alone together, but it didn’t really feel like having company, just like other people filling space. 

One of the girls in my room was one of the most rotund children I had ever seen.  She insisted on a top bunk and at night, I’d stare up at the bolts holding the bed together and wonder. Her name was Margret but most of the kids called her Big Maggie. 

The other girl was called Camilla. She was another top-bunker; sweet with blonde curls and a cleft lip. Her parents were alive—both of them—but an orphanage teaches a child a lot about how terrible some people can be. Camilla talked about *the surgery* so much, it could’ve been a mantra. She reckoned it was the only thing standing in the way of a happy life, but I saw the way she looked when the other kids tried to remember their parents aloud. There are some scars a plastic surgeon just can’t fix. 

When Riley finally arrived, I think it might’ve put Camilla’s problem into perspective. Riley had been one of those kids that strangers dote on at the grocery store. *What a beautiful little girl. Oh, those dimples, those eyes.* That kind of thing. Now she had a gauze patch bandaged to her head and I doubted she’d ever hear how pretty her *eye* was. Still, Riley seemed glad to see me, and I her. We were family and for the first time in days, I didn’t feel so alone. 

That first night, Riley woke up screaming. One of our minders, Ms. Justine came running in and nearly got crushed by Big Maggie as she tipped from her bunk in waking alarm. Riley told Ms. Justine that *it had followed her.*  She didn’t elaborate but she said that there was something in the closet. Ms. Justine checked as Big Maggie rubbed her hip and Camilla peered down from her bunk like some frightened, watchful bird. 

“There’s nothing here but clothes, child,” Ms. Justine said with a touch of irked fatigue. 

Riley was breathing manically and nodding along to nothing. Then she asked if Ms. Justine had a paper bag.  Ms. Justine shook her head, perplexed. “I’ll look for one,” was all she said in return. Then, she left with Maggie to get an ice pack. Camilla was snoring seconds later. And I looked across to Riley’s bed as her one eye stared back at me in utter terror. She stayed quiet for the rest of the night, but I couldn’t say if she slept.

—

After that we settled into a routine of sorts.  We ate simple meals together and I braided Riley’s hair in the mornings and we adapted to a host of new faces while trying not to lose our Momma’s.  I had a few pictures of her at our old house but they didn’t make their way to us after the crash. I found out later that no one was allowed the comfort of their memories from before Blair House. The Headmistress, Mrs. Benton, wanted us to be empty vessels for someone else’s love. It didn’t work, it just made the loss sting a little more. 

Riley’s nightmares were part of the routine too. She’d wake up with a yelp quiet enough for an older sister to hear but no one else. Sometimes she slept in my bed with me, until hanging halfway off of it got too uncomfortable. Sometimes, I’d go over to her bed and find a wet spot in the sheets. I knew she was scared, but at first I just figured it was the crash. When she finally got her hands on a brown paper lunch bag, I had to rethink that notion. It happened as we were all settling into bed during prayer time. 

Prayer time was our half-hour or so between showers and lights out where we were supposed to do something Christian to round out the day. Camilla did sometimes pray for the surgery, a prayer completed by a list of self-affirmations about the life she’d have after. Big Maggie and I usually read the most secular books we could find in the Blair House library. Riley liked to draw. She always had, but when Momma was alive, we had more paper. At the orphanage she had to be crafty about it. I thought that must’ve been why she’d gotten the paper bag. 

Maggie had started questioning Camilla on how exactly a new lip was supposed to get her a family with a blue convertible and I watched Riley doodling with a fat green crayon. When she finished, she opened the bag, breathed into it, grabbed the opening and—*POP!*

“What the hell, Bonny!” Maggie whisper-yelled from her bunk. 

*Bonny* had come from *Anne Bonny*, a girl pirate’s name Maggie had read somewhere and given to Riley after she came back from the doctor again with a patch on her eye. Riley liked the idea of being swashbuckling, so the name became something friendly in a weird way. Camilla, who had been losing her argument rather poorly, giggled vindictively and I began to think of an old mystery from our old house. 

Riley sighed and put the ruined bag under her bed. “Good night Maggie,” she whispered. “Good night Camilla. I love you Cassie.”

“I love you too…Riley.”

She smiled and put her head down and went to sleep. Maggie leaned her head over her bunk down toward me and and gave a look that spoke a silent, *huh*?  I shrugged, but a minute or so later, I fetched the bag and looked at what Riley had drawn. It wasn’t a picture; it was words:

*THE THING THAT SNEEKS AND WISPERS*

I didn’t understand, but the sound of the popping bag was something I had heard before. It would come from momma’s room and whenever I’d asked about it, she’d just tell me she was doing wishful thinking. 

Riley didn’t yelp that night, and the next morning she told me about a superstitious coping mechanism our momma had taught her to deal with little problems. She’d write the problem on a bag, blow it up and pop it. 

“And it worked,” Riley chirped. “It didn’t open the closet last night.”

“It? *The thing that sneaks and whispers?*”

“Well, I don’t know what it’s really called, but that’s what it does.”

“And what does it whisper?” I asked. 

“The same thing every time—*Hide your eyes*.”

At lunchtime, Riley talked, which was unusual for her since we’d come to Blair House. She asked Big Maggie and Camilla how long they’d been there. It was an innocent question, but a hard one at an orphanage. Camilla didn’t answer. Instead she pouted her bottom lip up high over her top and shuffled around her peas with her fork. 

Maggie said, “three years and some. My ma died from the cancer and my dad couldn’t do anything without her but drink. He wasn’t mean, just sad. Then he…well, if someone comes asking about you for adoption, make sure they don’t seem sad.”

Riley nodded.  “Our momma was sad sometimes too. But she loved us. A whole lot. She was always there for us, hugging and—”

“Riley!” I spat. She looked abashed, confused, but I could see the tears welling in Camilla’s eyes. “Camilla,” I entreated, “your parents didn’t deserve you.”

Maggie tried to help things with a frank, “you’re better off without those assholes, Mill.”

We didn’t help though, couldn’t. Camilla got up and ran off crying and Ms. Justine followed after her. 

After a moment of silence, Maggie cleared her throat. 

“She hasn’t had it easy,” she said. “She had a family once who came to get her. They was the ones who put that surgery bullshit in her head. But then something happened and they brought her back. She never said why. Maybe she never knew.”

“They can bring you back?” I asked. 

“Like a doll to the store,” she answered. “Signing the court papers is the only thing that makes it real. So be good if a nice family ever comes for you.  Be what they want you to be.”

Riley and I shared a frown. It didn’t seem right to build fragile hope in a child who had lost everything. But maybe we stopped being children the moment we became orphans. Maybe their world needed our loss to be like an etch-a-sketch rather than a defaced family portrait. 

I sulked for the rest of the day, and that night, Riley minded her tongue as Big Maggie read her book aloud to Camilla as Camilla sniffled. I listened too. And Maggie’s steady pace and low timbre lulled me to sleep. 

Then I awoke in darkness to the sound of a creaking door. I heard Camilla and Maggie snoring in their own recognizable ways. I could make out the lump of Riley’s frame across from me in her bed. The door to our room closed out a light in the hall that would’ve made our room brighter than it was. It was still closed. The creak elongated into a quiet shriek. No one stirred. I shut my eyes. 

*Step Step Step*

I squeezed my eyes tighter as I heard clammy footsteps squishing against the floor. I heard a rattling sigh like someone trying to breathe through too much phlegm. I felt something—somethings—*fingers*, tracing their way up my shin atop my blanket. 

*Step Step Rattle Step*

Something moved through my hair. Then it spoke. 

“*Hide your eyes…*” 

I whimpered and almost like some reflex of satisfaction, the footsteps quickly pitter-pattered back over toward the closet and the door slammed the room into silence. Still, no one stirred and I kept my eyes shut until listening became too tiresome and sleep came for me once again. 

I only told one person about what I’d heard—well, two—but the second was an accident. Big Maggie was nice in a tough kinda way. I knew she might poke fun at me, but she’d give me an honest listen. I was right on both counts. She told me I was ‘too old for that shit. Boogie men and closet monsters,’ but she hugged me after. And as rotund as she was, she gave good hugs. 

“We‘ve all got things chasing after us, Cassie,” she said. “You and Bonny just keep chasing each other. You’re family—I mean, we’re your family too—but, you know...”

“Yeah. I know, Maggie. Thanks.”

—

The thing that snuck and whispered became a part of my routine just as it had with Riley. Night after night, it padded between the beds with the same moist steps. Tentative steps that halted beside my bed. Sometimes it just loomed, gurgling steady breaths until it decided to whisper. And I heeded its warning. I buried my head under the covers and shut my eyes tight, because even in a darkened room, a thin blanket can still show a silhouette. I never had the courage to look. But a small shivering part of me was glad that it woke me and left Riley alone. 

Then around three months after momma’s death, I got a call to Mrs. Benton’s office. Going to see the Headmistress only ever meant one of two things. I had told Ms. Justine about the closet and my nightly terror after she berated me for being sluggish at my chores. I was tired but it wasn’t good enough to simply apologize. She prodded and I didn’t have the energy to lie. I thought that was the reason for my getting called in. I’d probably be punished, snapped at or chastised for being foolish. 

I entered the office with the same weariness that I supposed had sent me there. 

“Cassandra.”

“Mrs. Benton?”

“I hear you’ve been having some issues here. Trouble adjusting.”  She steepled her fingers and stared at me across her fingertips the way a hunter might appraise a deer down a reticle. 

“Ma’am, I—“

Her fingers collapsed. “You may not have to worry about that now. A family has taken an interest in you. Lucky girl.”

I didn’t know quite how to feel. I knew she would want a smile so I tried one but for all I knew it read as a grimace. But a family… It’s all Camilla and so many others talked about, but in my mind, momma and Riley were family. It didn’t matter how dead half of that family was. 

“Will they make me and Riley call them—well, will the lady make us call her momma?”

Mrs. Benton narrowed her eyes.  “That is an impertinent question, young lady. You will call them whatever they choose. They’re a respectable Christian couple who are interested in saving you from a life of detachment and destitution and that should be enough.”  She paused. “But they took an interest in *you*. Riley is staying here.”

My heart sunk and I watched the unflinching coldness of her gaze betray nothing of sympathy. 

“What? No! We’re family. You can’t—I won’t leave her.”

“It’s not your choice. If they want you, you’ll go. They’ve reviewed Riley’s file and they weren’t interested. End of story.”

I grasped at any point of persuasion I had, but all the while, my mind just returned to Camilla and her cleft lip and the sadness she carried. Riley’s face had lost its perfection but she was crippled too. What chance did she have? It wasn’t right. None of us were broken dolls to be discarded. 

*Dolls...* 

I remembered something. I found my point. Maybe. 

“They take us both or I’ll misbehave. I’ll—I’ll make them send me back before the court papers get signed. I will. I’ll call the police and say they’re mean to me and they’ll send me back.  You’ll see.”

Mrs. Benton’s pupils dilated and her jaw tightened but the rest of her face remained unchanged. Or it seemed to, but I could see something menacing, *violent* growing in the stasis. 

“If they take us both, I’ll be perfect, I promise, Mrs. Benton. Please! She’s my sister and if I’m not there to love her—“

I was weeping ugly snotty tears by then and still Mrs. Benton betrayed nothing. 

“Go back to your lessons, young lady. And clean your face before you do. I don’t know what disgusts me more right now, your sniveling or your ingratitude.”  She clenched her teeth and hissed in a breath. “Go. Now.”

I cried my way to the bathroom and stared at the mirror for a long while at a face that was more like my momma’s than Riley’s. I wasn’t as pretty as momma though, certainly not as pretty as Riley. So why me and not her? It was just an eye. It wasn’t fair. It wasn’t. 

Red, streaked and dry was the best I could manage of my face by the time I rejoined the other girls. Maggie, who was in my lesson group, frowned. 

“You got in trouble?”

“No—well, yes—but Mrs. Benton said a family asked after me.”

“Well, hell, Cassie. That’s good.”

“They don’t want Riley...”

Maggie had begun to smile and afterward she looked like she’d been slapped. Then she stared and I tried not to cry again. Finally, she just said, “Bastards.”  

That night I told her about my threat to Mrs. Benton and she erupted into a howling sorta laugh. I tried to laugh too, tried to feel powerful even though I wasn’t. I tried not to think about Mrs. Benton or the new bastard family or the crash or the fact that I’d be awoken in the night by something terrifying. The only good moment I had was the present one, so I decided to embrace it. I asked Maggie and Camilla if they knew any songs we could sing. Camilla offered up a selection of hymns and Maggie balked. 

“I can sing all of Jolene by Dolly Parton,” Maggie said. “I’ll teach you the words and y’all can sing it too.”

She made good. We were all singing by the end of Prayer Time. Even Camilla with her sweet high voice was singing; smiling too. It was the first time since my momma died that I really felt happy. 

After lights out, we all stayed up and whispered for a while about movies we’d seen and books we’d read. At one point, Camilla asked Maggie about the song and why it was that Dolly Parton didn’t just find somebody different if her man was gonna leave her. 

“My dad couldn’t find no one else.” Maggie replied. “His heart was stuck with my ma. We watched her getting skinnier and skinnier until she looked like a different person. And they used to laugh. Not after that.”  

I could hear the tears in her voice up above. 

“Maybe some folks only get one person to love,” she sniffed. “Kinda lucky they both found the right one then, huh?”

Maggie was too good for a place like Blair. She cussed like a sailor, but she had the biggest heart of anyone I’d met. She was there for Riley whenever her cane became a burden. She was there for Camilla when her dreams started to crack. She was there for me like the kinda friend it takes years to make. And we felt a little less like orphans with her around. 

I tapped the top of my bunk. She hung a hand down and I grabbed it. It was a nice moment before the inevitable 

&nbsp;

*Creeeeeak*

I shuddered awake and instinctively pulled up the covers. I waited as the footsteps padded around near the closet. I waited and heard odd noises that I’d never heard the thing make before. I waited. 

I must’ve fallen back to sleep, because the next thing I knew, there was someone in my bed. A breath rattled on top of me. I lay, petrified. The thing pawed around my face as my breaths hastened. By the time I thought to scream, it was covering my mouth.  More phlegmy breaths, hastening to match my own. It lowered its head toward my ear. Then, it whispered, quickly, emphatically. 

“Never to be seen. Never to be seen. Hide your eyes. *Shhhhhh*.”

The thing was strong. Hard bones and a fierce grip. I wanted to fight it away, but I couldn’t find a muscle in my body that would respond. What did it want? What did its new words mean?

My mind wandered to terrible things as I struggled to breathe—the thing dragging me away, the thing jerking its head suddenly, biting into my face, gnawing at my skull. I couldn’t breathe—or I was breathing too quickly. I couldn’t tell which. And then I was screaming. No. I was *hearing* screams. Distant. Then loud. I opened my eyes to daylight shrouded thinly by a blanket and the screams continued. 

Maggie’s. 

I uncovered my head, jumped out of my bunk, saw her crumpled at the closet door. She was slumped over the threshold, wailing, and—my stomach lurched—wailing and hugging a skinny pair of dangling legs. I looked to Riley’s bunk. Then I looked back to the closet, to the small suspended frame, to her vacant stare and the cord around her neck, to her blue lips split by a tiny cleft. Such a small and woeful thing. 

Maggie was sobbing. Riley was stirring. Camilla was dead. 

—

Maggie and I both blamed ourselves. Maggie said that she should have been nicer, if such a thing was even possible. I had been afraid to look.  I figured Camilla hadn’t. She must’ve woken up and seen the thing and I’d never told her to hide her eyes. 

*Never to be seen.* 

The whisper—the warning—was different that night. A consequence. I hadn’t wanted to scare Camilla, but she should have been scared. Fear is protection after all, a voice that screams to hide when the sneaking things whisper and wait. 

By the time the funeral came, I’d made sure to warn Maggie firmly. I reiterated the warning to Riley, worried that her fear might’ve abated. She remembered well enough though and when she heard that I had been dealing with her old problem, she said she’d lend me a crayon and find me a paper bag. I cried at that, even as she smiled meekly. We were all a family. Riley learned mothering from Maggie, even though Riley was the youngest. I think Maggie had learned it from Camilla, though in an opposite way. What had I learned except to fear the night?

Maybe I’d gained a bit of fierceness. I had fought against Mrs. Benton, or I’d tried. I’d wanted to fight harder, to be less flimsy, but our brief interaction had frightened me. And as we sat in the pews of some dusty old church not far from Blair House, I weighed my flailing rebellion against the immovability of a cold woman. Mrs. Benton gave a sparse eulogy. She said Camilla’s favorite hymn was *Nearer My God to Thee.* She was wrong. She didn’t know anything about Camilla and as we stood to sing, she didn’t look sad. She just stood beside the dusty old pastor, moved her lips to the song and glared at me. Just me. Nobody else. 

After the service, I went to fetch a little picture of Camilla they had beside the casket and Mrs. Benton snatched it from my hands. 

“Young lady, you would steal in the house of the Lord?”  She snapped. 

“I wasn’t stealing. I was just—she was my friend Mrs. Bent—“

She grabbed me by the ear and my fierceness floundered as I was dragged toward the doors at the back of the congregation hall. Once we were outside, she let go. I thought that was it. I wasn’t expecting her smack. I cowered before the second landed, saw the pastor on the third. He stared alongside the other girls, silent, unmoving as Mrs. Benton beat me on the steps of the church. *Was wrath not a sin?* I wondered between the blows. I cried.  I begged for mercy, but none came.  How? We were on the threshold of the house of the Lord. But like my flesh and blood father, my Holy one was absent. Gone. A runaway with better things to do. It wasn’t fair. 

After the beating Mrs. Benton composed herself as I shook at her feet. She smoothed down the hair that had come loose from her bun. And then she said, “Friday, your new family is coming to take you, girl. Mind your manners and make sure you’re presentable.”

Friday was two days away. Not enough time to prepare Riley for another empty bunk in our room. Not enough time to say a proper goodbye. I didn’t know what to do. I wasn’t ready. And on Friday I was far from presentable. Thursday night, I’d cried myself to sleep and spent nearly an hour shaking as the *thing* rattled breaths into my ear. It was so close to me that night that I could smell a stench of rot through the blanket. Maybe it knew I was leaving. Maybe it was goading me to look. But I didn’t. 

Then at lunch, Ms. Justine told me it was time. 

“I’m not ready,” I said. “I—I have to pack.”

Ms. Justine looked annoyed. “Margaret can pack yours and Riley’s things, Cassandra.”

*Riley’s things?*

“C’mon. Best not keep them waiting.”

Maggie gave me a warm, sad kind of smile as I stared back,dumbfounded. She held my hand across the table, chewed at her top lip, and nodded. She, as always, was being strong so I broke down for her. It didn’t take long for her strength to fail. 

“Be good,” she said. “Be happy. You and Bonny both.”

“I—I’ll write you letters,” I promised. “I’ll call too if I can.”

“I know, Cassie. And I’ll be alright. My time’ll come soon enough.”

Ms. Justine gave us another minute. A minute after that I was sat in a room with Riley, Mrs. Benton and a couple who introduced themselves as Gerald and Kathryn (*but everyone calls me Kitty*) Campbell. They seemed nice and if they were nice enough to take Riley too, then they were nice enough for my best behavior. Strangely, Mrs. Benton smiled throughout. She praised us and only gave one underhanded jab about me having a *very active imagination.*

“Oh. Well that’s good,” Gerald said. “Kitty likes to tell stories. Little tales and such. How bout you?”

“She adores it,” Mrs. Benton answered on my behalf. 

I smiled sheepishly and Riley just sat looking confused but vaguely cheery. 

When we had finished and our bags had been brought to the doorway of the office, Mrs. Benton politely asked to speak to me alone about a ‘matter of stewardship.’ The Campbells obliged and took the bags as Riley hobbled after them. 

As soon as we were alone, all of the courtesy and joviality dropped from Mrs. Benton’s demeanor. Her face tightened into that same dull, dangerous stillness that had answered my sobs and pleas. 

“You had the gall to threaten me, girl. After everything this establishment has done for you…you deserve to be alone.”

I didn’t answer. 

“I had a mind to send Riley to a different state and tell the Campbells to look elsewhere. But Justine called them and begged them to take you both. What you threatened her with, I haven’t a clue, but your little stunt—and hers—will cost her a job and a recommendation. Twelve years of service—“

She clapped her hands sharply and shook her head. The sound made me wince. 

“You have a home for life now, girl. You do. Because if you ever return to Blair House—well, I hope you’ll remember your little friend, Clarissa.”

*Camilla*, I silently corrected, not daring to speak. 

“Bad things happen to sad little girls. Some find rejection intolerable. They’re back the first night and by the next morning someone like Justine finds them. Sometimes it’s a cup of bleach or a razor blade, others it’s a cord around the neck.”

She paused and tightened her glare. I shrunk back into my seat. 

“Sometimes it’s the younger ones that take it hardest. And your sister’s had a hard go of it already.  If that family sends you back…”

“They won’t. I’ll be good,” I whispered. “We’ll be happy.”

She smirked almost imperceptibly. “You’ll be good.”

—

On the ride, Riley and I sat in the back of the Cambell’s car. Gerald was a fair bit older than Kitty, graying considerably and balding at his crown. Kitty’s forehead was lined even with her eyebrows down, but she had a youthful look all the same. She smiled wide and often, made a show of laughing loudly. Gerald just talked and talked. 

He told us they had always wanted girls, but that the Lord hadn’t had it in His plans to make Kitty a mother. 

“Gerald has excellent genes,” Kitty added, with a reassuring squeeze to his hand. “His father and mother are still alive. 94 and 91 years old and still healthy, if you can believe it.”

“That’s really old,” Riley said. 

I let out a strained chuckle. “What she means to say is, that’s really *wonderful*.  What a blessing.”

“Isn’t it?” Kitty cooed. 

I gave Riley a look and she mouthed, *sorry*, and stayed quiet for the next twenty minutes or so. By the time we had reached an unfamiliar stretch of landscape and highway signs I didn’t recognize, I had gotten into the routine of answering questions and sharing little anecdotes. It was a comfortable enough way to pass the time. Then Gerald paused for a long moment. He flicked his eyes back at me through the rear view mirror. I smiled the first time. The second time less so. By the third time, the new silence had begun to feel uneasy. Finally, he cleared his throat and brushed the steering wheel with his thumb. 

“Cassandra?”

“Yes, sir?”

“You’re old enough to have gotten your period, right?”

“Um, that’s—maybe Mrs. Campbell and I could—“

“Simple question, Cassandra. Yes or no?”

Kitty stared at him, smiling from the passenger seat.

“Um...yes.”

Another quick glance in the mirror.

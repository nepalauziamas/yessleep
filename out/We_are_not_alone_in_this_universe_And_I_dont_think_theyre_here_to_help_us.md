Trigger warning: Mention of sexual assault 
.


.

I am a father. well, I should probably say I was a father. when my wife and I got divorced she took the kids and didn’t give me any visitation rights. The courts just dont seem to like ruling in favor of fathers. At first I was okay with it, I came to terms with everything and understood that I can try to be there for my kids from a distance, and when they’re 18 they can make the decision on whether or not they would like to see me again. 

But I kept checking in on them. facebook is good for that. and as time went on, and my kids got older, I started to notice changes that didn’t feel quite right. they looked tired all the time. like they weren’t getting enough sleep, and they started losing weight at a rate that was alarming to me. like they almost seemed emaciated like they weren’t being fed enough. 

I came to the only conclusion any good parent would and deduced that they were being abused. 

so I took things into my own hands, the courts didnt wanna work with me, well i’ll show them. 

I snuck into the house in the middle of the night, and grabbed all three of my children and snuck them out of the house with barely even a peep. the kids were reluctant to go but I knew it was for the better. 

we got into the car and drove away into the night. 

we drove to a warehouse that was on the edge of town where we would be spending the next several nights until I could get them all the way out of here. 

But then things started to really go wrong. I noticed my kids at night when they would be in the chairs that I gave them (so they dont run away of course) would look out the windows and smile at something. I would always look too but I never saw anything more than the wilderness. and yet, they would always look, and they would always smile. 

but the weirdest thing was, it wasnt always in the same spot. it first started in a window, then moved to a similar window, but on the opposite side, then to one of the skylights, so on and so forth. but they never looked in the same window two nights in a row. 

and then, they would all look at the exact same time each night. at exactly 9:13 PM they would all look at one specific window, and smile at something that I couldnt see. 

and then things got bad. 

one night as my kids are strapped to the chairs, and im awake, making sure no one is trying to escape, I hear the unmistakeable click of a doorknob turning. but that shouldnt be possible, I am the only one who knows precisely where we are. 

I stood up and checked to make sure everyone was still where I left them, and sure enough everyone was accounted for, but still I could hear something, a very faint sound. so small you wouldnt be able to hear it if you werent actively listening for it. 

I looked into the darkness where something drew my attention. a faint motion that was hidden behind a stack of boxes. and there, so faint, was the figure if something unidentifiable standing there, staring back at me. 

I cautiously made my way around the corner of those boxes, my heart pounding all the way. And when I rounded the corner I expected to come face to face with whoever it was hiding there. 

except, when I round the corner, no one was there. 

or rather thats what I thought. 

I began to calm down slightly. but then O look and realize that the chairs my kids occupied only moments before, now stood empty. 

I froze with the feeling of dread, ice flowing through my veins as I stood unmoving eyes locked on the chair where there was still nothing, however, the creature behind me, breathing down my neck, led me to believe that maybe I wasnt going to make it out alive. 

Now I sit in the managers office, shaking as I write this, hoping that someone will find it someday and know that I never made it out. because even now, I can see that thing slinking through the darkness slowly coming up to me and staying just out of the light enough to remain unseen. 


childrens perspective. 

the man who kidnapped us has no idea about anything. He thinks we actually want to be with him. but he has us tied to metal chairs instead of sleeping soundly in our mothers house. but nonetheless its okay. we wont be here for much longer anyway. 

why you may ask? 

because we are not alone in this universe. some people talk with those who are responsible for keeping this universe balanced, one of which is our mother. and these beings, spirits known as Guardians, do not take kindly to those who force themself onto someone, and then kidnap her kids. 

and so I look up the the skylight, where in full view is the moon, lighting up the sky in a silvery light. And I smile at the silhouette of a person floating in front of the moon. a person whom we know, is about to come save us

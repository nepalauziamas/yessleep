Aw, the Christmas of 85 I remember it like it was yesterday...

It was blistering cold on that fateful Christmas day back in 85 and the ground was covered with at least 2 inches of snow due to a blizzard that hit the night before. 

I had just finished a 9-hour shift at my Uncle's restaurant (located at the local mall) so I was exhausted and just wanted to go home. 

My parents were out of town for the Holidays so, I was alone except for their 2 dogs, Sasha and Sadie (both German Shepards).

Anyway, It was around 5:30 pm when I finally arrived home (unaware somebody was following me) and by this time it was already dark outside. 


I could hear Christmas Carolers off in the distance as I let the dogs out to pee. 

When they were finished I went to the kitchen to get a bite to eat. 

After eating my sandwich, I walked back to the living room and switched on the TV to the 6:00 news.

Lately, the talk was about a serial killer (whose killing spree had begun one month earlier) whose (30) victims were all females, between the ages of 18-25. Most of the victims were dark-haired and their bodies were usually, discovered near shopping malls.

Although I was 18 years old at the time and female, I wasn't terribly scared.

After I was finished watching TV, I locked all the doors and then laid down on the couch. 


As soon as my head hit the pillow, I passed out.

I was asleep for no more than 30-minutes when something jolted me out of my slumber.

Letting my eyes adjust to the dark as I scanned the living room. 

I noticed both Sasha and Sadie growling in the direction of the kitchen.

I stood up and reluctantly walked over to the kitchen all the while trembling like a leaf. As I entered the kitchen, I felt something hard strike me on the back of my head knocking me out cold.

When I came to, I saw a dark figure standing above me with a knife. 

Although It was too dark to make out any features, I could tell that they were wearing a mask. 

"Stand up!" he shouted at me and I did as he told me, feeling a little bit dizzy as I did.

"What do you wa-" but before I could finish my sentence he punched me hard in the face causing me to stumble back onto the floor.

This caused my adrenaline to rise and I could feel the claws on my hands grow. And, I screamed in pain as they tore through my skin. I felt my body getting warm and my bones crack causing me to let out an agonizing howl.

The man stood there frozen as I charged at him, growling as I ripped off the hand that held the knife. He was screaming in pain, as I proceeded to rip off his other arm and bite off chunks of his skin in the process. 


After a few minutes of this, he collapsed onto the floor where he lie there unmoving in a pool of his own blood.

Later on, the police found me passed out on the floor apparently, the silent alarm had gone off alerting the authorities.

The man, although badly injured was still alive.

They later identified him as the 'Shopping Mall Killer'.

As they were taking him into custody, he began to shout, "Monster!" Eventually, the judge had him committed to a mental institution where he still resides, 34 years later.

The authorities later thanked me for helping them capture the 'Shopping Mall Killer' but little did they know...


You see, when he followed me home on that fateful Christmas back in 85, they probably didn't realize, that I was the one he should've been afraid of...

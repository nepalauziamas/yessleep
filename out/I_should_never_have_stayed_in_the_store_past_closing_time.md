God, why am I such an idiot? Why did I think going through with *any* of this’d be a *good* idea? I mean, COME ON!

“Hey man, I have an idea, how about we camp out *AT WORK* overnight? Sounds fun, right?”

*Fuck me, man...*

Okay, so basically what I’m trying to say is, me and my coworker got bored, so we decided to try and play a game. We decided to lock ourselves in the store after we closed for the night and spend the night. And please don’t ask me why *I* thought this idea was a good one. For one thing, it wasn’t *my* idea, and second, well, like I said, we were bored and evidently good judgement isn’t something we have much of.

And before you wanna kick me while I’m down by coming at me for doing something stupid like this out of sheer boredom, let me give you a little rundown of a typical day at “Vicker’s Super smart Supermarket”. It’s one of those big box stores that’s not quite as big as Publix or Walmart, but still bigger than say, Dollar Tree or Family Dollar (even if *those* places end up actually getting talked about more often). Operating hours were 7 days a week, 7:00 A.M. sharp to 10:00 P.M. sharp (and I mean *sharp* — God help you if you were late by *FIVE MINUTES!*)

During said hours, here’s what would happen; absolutely fuckin’ nothing. See, by the time second shift rolls around, most people apparently decide they’d rather just be at home after getting off work (you know, like a *normal person*). But not us. Nope, we have to make sure our doors are open to “welcome any of our loyal ‘Super Smart Shoppers’ with open arms and a smile” — of which there are usually only about a dozen that I can remember in the almost two years I’ve sank into this place.

Honestly, I don’t know why they *need* us to stay open so damn late all the time. It’s literally the *SAME DAMN PEOPLE* every day, MAYBE with the occasional out of town-er. Now, add all of this up with the fact that our radio doesn’t even play any good stations (well, at least nothing *I* can stand listening to), and yeah, now you can maybe get an understanding as to why me and the others might pull a stunt and end up in some shit like this.

Anyways, so it was last night, maybe around 7 or 8:00 and everything was dead quiet in the place (as usual). By this time, I usually go ahead and start sweeping, mopping, and emptying the trash cans at the front and register areas while the manager on duty, usually being Zane, the only M.O.D. they can get to work night shifts, would start tidying up the back of the store. I was running the trash to the back when Zane came up to me.

“Check this out, I just had an idea!” He exclaimed, sounding like he was about to tell me he’d found the cure to cancer or something. The look on his face was kind of a tip off that whatever he was about to say was likely going to be something balls-to-the-wall wacky, something he was kind of known for doing from time to time around the place. If he wasn’t talking about his latest fan theories about his favorite TV series’, he was usually pitching ideas for how to make weird shit for when you get stoned (like the time he hollowed out a hot pocket and stuffed it with marshmallow cream, calling it his “homemade Twinkie recipe”).

“Oh yeah, what’s that?” I asked, grinning dryly. It was amusing wondering what insanity would come out of his mouth next. He held up his phone.

“Dude, check it; you know how this place was built on an old Cherokee burial ground?” I raised my eyebrow at him and shook my head. That was honestly the first I’d ever heard of it. He pointed to his phone, “Yeah, see? This place was built on the same place where a bunch of ‘em dropped dead back during the ‘trail of tears’.”

I looked closer to the phone. It was a post on an unlisted forum (you know, one of those “we show you what ‘The Man’ don’t want you seein’” types). The title of it was **Blood Profiteering: Supermarket built on blood-stained soil!”** I briefly skimmed the post before looking back up to him, raising my eyebrow. “Okay, so?” I asked.

“So, what if there’s ghosts here? Wouldn’t that be awesome?” I stared blankly at him. I’ll say it right now, I was two seconds from pissing myself laughing. Was he fuckin’ serious right now? From the look on his face; the trademark “I swear to God, dude” look he had when he said this, told me that he wasn’t.

“Yeah, okay.” I scoffed, turning back and heading to the dumpster area. He followed behind me.

“Bro, I’m serious, there could be ghosts here!”

I heaved the trash into the dumpster. “Yeah, and? What’re we supposed to do? Call the GhostBusters?”

“Well what if we could meet ‘em?” I snapped my head to look at him. At first, I actually thought I misheard him. I cocked my eyebrow.

“Come again?”

“What if we met the spirits of the dead? What do you think they’d say, whatddya think they’d do?” Now I *was* laughing. “What, what’s funny? I’m being serious?”

“Do you fuckin’ hear yourself right now?” I asked, still hilariously baffled. “How much dope did you smoke before coming in today, man?”

He furrowed his eyebrow for a second before saying, “Only two. But that’s not the point.” I barked out another laugh in disbelief. “*Come on*”, he insisted, “you’re telling me that, despite all those episodes of ‘X-files’ you’ve been binging on your lunch breaks, you wouldn’t want to have an *actual* paranormal encounter of your own?”

I sighed, annoyed. He just *had* to bring up my obsession with ‘X-files’, didn’t he? Look, yeah, I like spooky shit, okay? Horror movies, ghost stories, paranormal documentaries or podcasts, all that stuff; yeah, I’m all for it. But that didn’t mean I wanted to try and do some shit like seances or summoning spirits or whatever. “Look, dude, I just like HEARING about weird stuff, not actually TRYING IT.”

His face remained pleading. “Hell, how would we even pull it off? Perform some black magic or something? I don’t even believe in that shit.”

“Nah, see, that’s just it, *we* don’t have to do anything. You don’t have to believe in anything, either, I mean, Hell,” he held his hand up, “Atheist here. I don’t believe in God or angels, either.”

“Wait,” I interrupted, “you don’t believe in God or anything...” He shook his head. “... But you wanna try and see Ghosts?” I stared dumbfounded at him again.

“Why not?” He said with surprisingly genuine enthusiasm (well maybe not *that* surprising — again, kind of an odd ball, this one). I pinched the bridge of my nose. “All we have to do”, he continued, “is stay inside the store till at least midnight, and they’ll show up. We’ll get to see *actual ghosts*!”

My eyes almost shot right from my head at him. “Yeah, OR we’ll just look like two idiots standing in an empty store AFTER HOURS! Bro, are you *sure* whatever you were smoking wasn’t laced or something? I mean, aside from the fact that I’d like to go home tonight, you DO know that’s considered trespassing, right? I ain’t trying to have the law on my back, especially not for something stupid like this.”

"Dude, relax, it's not like anybody's here anyway. Look around." He waved his hand around. He was right, nobody was there. "Who's gonna notice?"

I sighed. "Look man," I said, aggravated, "I just wanna go home tonight, okay?" He rolled his eyes.

"Well, here's the thing, whether you're in or not, I'm not leaving till I try this. You wanna go home to your lonely apartment, be my guest, but I'm stayin'."

 I looked at him like *"Really man?"* Aside from annoyingly taking jabs at me once again about my personal life (shit that wasn't his business that I *thought* could be trusted to remain in confidence), I knew that he was trying to entrap me. He knew that if I left him alone in the store after closing that the  General Manager would have my ass in a sling. I pinched the bridge of my nose and sighed again, "Fine, I'll do it."

He immediately brightened right back up and let out a loud *"Woo-hoo!"* that resonated throughout the entire store. I just shook my head. *"What am I doing with my life?"* 

So yeah, that's how I got into this mess. My goofball M.O.D. sucker-punched me into pulling some ghost hunting scheme. Of course, I figured everything would be dead (figuratively, at least). Nothing would happen, and we'd go home, where I'd maybe take a few hits from my bowl before passing out on the couch like usual. One way or another, also, I'd find some way to get him back for forcing me to go through with this.

Anyway, soon 9:30 rolled around, with the only business we got being Mrs. Delaney; buying her customary two boxes of whole wheat crackers, tub of Land-O Lakes, and two blocks of cheddar cheese along with a bag of cat food, and Gary who only *ever* came in either to annoy me by trying to ask me to set him up with some girl me and him went to school together with and to buy a pack of Marlboro Reds. I had just finished sweeping the front of the store when I looked up to see that Zane wasn't up front taking down his register like usual. I frowned, *"Where is he?"*

I looked around. I couldn't see him anywhere. "Zane?" I called out. "Zane, where are--" 

I stopped when I saw him coming out of the seasonal aisle with sleeping bags and pillows. I looked confused at him. "Dude, what the hell're you doing with those?"

"Well, I mean, if you *wanna* sleep on the floor..." he replied, snickering. 

"What do you mean? I thought you said we only had to stay till midnight."

"No, I said that's when it'd *start*." he said. I groaned. He tossed one of the sleeping bags to me before heading to the front to take his register down for the night. Sulking, I laid out my sleeping bag in the middle of the chip aisle. *"At least I'll have snacks."* I thought. 

After that, I locked the doors for the night while Zane was finishing closing out the system. Finally, the store was closed. "Okay, so what do we do now for the next two hours?" I asked Zane. He shrugged.

"Dunno. Post didn't specify. It just said that the spirits of the dead indians might come come around at midnight."

"Does it say anything in specific about 'em; whether or not they're normal and friendly or if they're the pissed off "Kill all white men on sight" types?" 

"Uh..." He paused for a moment before chuckling and saying, "No, don't think it did." I dropped my face into my hands.

"Great, so we're locked in an empty store with nothing to do, trying to catch the ghosts of dead people who were forced from their homes to die here, and we don't even know whether or not they're friendly; is that what you're saying?" He shrugged with a carefree smirk. I scoffed, "Fuckin' wonderful."

"What, you scared?" He followed this by flapping his arms and making chicken noises.

"Whatever, man."  I said, rolling my eyes while flipping him off. I walked off back to the chip aisle. I decided to try passing the time by screwing around on my phone for a while; scrolling through Facebook and then YouTube. Figuring since we weren't entirely sure *what* kind of spirits we might or might not end up dealing with, I decided to then spend some time watching videos on the different spirits of Native American folklore. 

For the most part, aside of course from the wendigo, I didn't see anything about specific spirits that were necessarily *known* for being evil or anything. *"Well, at least I won't have much to worry abo--"* My thoughts were derailed when I saw the lights start flickering. "Zane?" I called out. No answer. 

The lights continued flickering. I got up and went to look for Zane. I started around the front where I was; the food aisles. When I didn't see him anywhere there, I headed towards the Home décor section and started making my way from there to the pet aisle. "Zane? Hey, Zane, where are you?"

The flickering got more sporadic. Around the time I made it to the Cleaning aisle, I started to hear the sounds of some sort of chanting coming from seemingly all around me. This was joined with the distant beats of some sort of drum. It reminded me of scenes in movies of tribal ceremonies, usually for sacrifices or something, you know? 

"Zane?" I called out again. Still no answer. Admittedly, this started making me anxious. Maybe it was the fact that it was late at night, and I was locked in an empty store, not even able to find the only other person that I knew should've been there, but I felt small chills stab down my back the further down I went. The sounds got louder, going past the cleaning and past the furniture aisle.

Slowly shambling down from there and past the medicine aisle, I heard Zane's voice letting out a shrill scream like he'd just been stabbed. Instantly, I kicked into overdrive and started bolting the rest of the way down to the Clearance aisle at the back of the store. The lights were flickering so bad the closer I got that I'm almost surprised I didn't drop dead of an epileptic seizure. "Zane!" I shouted, "I'm coming!" 

The chanting got louder. The drums beat harder. I started throwing my head in every possible direction, looking for either Zane or who/whatever the hell was making that noise. I couldn't see anything. "ZANE!"

The lights went out with me being just about to enter the electronics aisle, with the clearance aisle being right next to that. I pulled out my phone and turned on the flashlight. "Zane?! Where are you, are you okay?!" I got no reply, only the increased intensity of the drums. It was all around me, on top of me. I waved the light around frantically, my heart quaking at Mach 7 speed. Suddenly, the chants died abruptly and the drums stopped. Everything was silent again.

I froze, standing in the dark, waving my light around. Nothing was there. "Zane, Goddamn it, where are you?!" I cried. "ZANE!" 

From deeper in the aisle, I heard the faint sounds of whispering. They were indistinct, almost completely incomprehensible. It sounded again like the distant chanting, only much softer and right there in my ear. My entire body was shaking furiously. *"Where's Zane?! Goddamn it, why did I have to get mixed up in this?! WHY COULDN'T WE HAVE JUST GONE HO--"*

"YAAA!" I jumped back, landing on my ass. I ended up tossing my phone up into the air, sending it crashing down hard to the floor. I heard Zane's voice erupt into hysterical laughter before the lights abruptly came back on. "Oh God, dude," he said through fits of laughter, "That shit was *priceless!"*

He ended up dropping to one knee, unable to catch his breath. I just sat there, me being still *far* too shaken up to say or do anything, including breathing. I just sat there, slack-jawed, staring blankly at him until eventually my heart rate went somewhat back to normal. Despite this, I could still hear the distant sounds of chanting. 

"Dude... *WHAT THE FUCK?!"* I screamed at him, having caught my breath again. He was still weak with laughter. 

"That was great. God man, I wish I could've caught your ass on video with that!" I felt my heart rate speed up a bit again; this time being adrenaline. I had every bit the mind to to force feed him the tips of my boots, knocking all of his teeth down his throat. He just kept laughing.

"You motherfucker! That wasn't funny, dude. I thought someone was actually in here. Not cool!" His hysterics finally calmed down. 

"Oh, come on..." he said, wearing the most obnoxious grin I'd ever seen, "That was fun. Didn't you have fun?"

"NO! I almost had a heart attack! What the fuck were you doing anyway?" I noticed the chanting growing distantly louder and louder. It sounded like whoever it was was slowly approaching from a distance. "How were you doing all of this?" 

"Dude," he said condescendingly, like I was apparently supposed to have already known the answer, "Look around, we're in the *Electronics aisle*! You really think I can't just easily grab a Bluetooth speaker off the shelf and play some tribal Indian drum music?" He looked to the wall behind him and said, "Even better with the light switch *right there*, too."

I think, if I hadn't been so shaken that I was actually physically exhausted, I'd have put my foot in his ass. As it was, I just sighed and pinched the bridge of my nose while he started laughing at me again. "Okay well. you got me, you happy? You can cut the chanting off now." He stopped laughing.

"Huh?"

"The chanting; the sound effects, cut it out. You already got me. The prank's over." His smile slowly fell into a look of bewilderment. The voices grew much closer. I could start making out some of the disembodied syllables much more clearly now.

"Dude..." he said hesitantly, "I'm not doing anything right now." I raised my eyebrow at him.

"Uh huh, right; you're not doing that?" I said, annoyed. Each passing second, I could hear them get louder in my ears. 

"I'm not." he exclaimed defensively. "I'm not doing anything right now, see?" He held up his phone, showing it being locked. "Why, what're you talking about? You hearin' something?" 

I sighed again, gritting my teeth in frustration. "I'm not gonna ask nice again, okay? Look, I'm tired and frankly kinda pissed at you already for keeping me here all night for this shit, so last time, TURN THE DAMN SOUND EFFECTS OFF!" 

"Bro, *what* sound effects?! I swear to God, I don't have any--" He stopped when the lights shut off again. Everything was pitch dark all around me again. I couldn't see Zane or anything else anymore.

"What're you doing?!" I shouted. 

"What do you mean?!" he shouted back, "I'm nowhere near the fuckin' lights, man." 

"Quit fucking around, where the hell even are you?" 

"Right here," he said, touching my shoulder. "See, I'm right in front of you. I'm not doing anything here." My eyes started bugging out and my blood started to go cold again. He was right; no phone meant no sound effects and, with him being right in front of me like this, it *couldn't* have been him doing any of this. My legs were shaking again.

"Th-then... who the hell's making that noise?"

"What noise?" he said, his own voice growing increasingly anxious. 

"The chanting, dude. You don't hear that?" 

It was all around me now again, right in my ear. Because of this, I almost didn't hear him when he asked "Hear what, what chanting?"

"Shh, listen. It's all around us." I picked my phone up and turned the flashlight back on, waving it around the aisle. "Who's there?" I called out. 

Nothing was there. Just the electronics. No one or nothing was there. Still, the chanting became more and more intense, like something big was about to happen during one of their ceremonies like what I described before. 

"Dude, what's goin' on?" Zane asked, noticeably frightened. I kept waving the light around. "Okay, okay, I'm sorry for punking you. You win, you got me, alright? Cut it out." I turned back in his direction.

"What the? I'm serious! Someone or something else is here in the store with us!" In the glow of my flashlight, I could see the color drain from his already pale-skinned face. I, myself, was two seconds from scrambling for the back door when I heard the drum beat start up again. I swung the light over towards it. Nothing. 

This time, Zane must've caught on because he snapped towards the back where it was coming from, too. "What the hell?!" he exclaimed. 

"You hear it now, too?"

"Y-ye-yeah... what the... What the fuck?!" The drums got closer, closer; pounding harder and harder. For a moment, I actually started to *feel* the drumbeat resonating through my body, making my heart cut backflips in my chest. The chorus of chants increased in ferocity as well.

"Dude," I shouted, "The front door! Run!" I turned and was about to book it myself to the front door when I stopped dead, realizing Zane wasn't following me. I turned around, shining the light on him. He stood completely still. "Zane!" I called out. "What're you doing, *COME ON!"*

He didn't move. He was motionless, looking like one of the mannequins in the clothing aisles. His back was facing me, staring directly ahead towards the back of the store. I called out to him again. Again he didn't answer or even acknowledge me; instead just remaining perfectly still for another ten seconds before his body abruptly started seizing violently.

"Zane!" I started back towards him. "Zane, what's wro--" I stopped.

His head jerked up to lock eyes with me. His face was now whiter than a piece of paper. His eyes were now two dark marbles, embedded in their sockets. His jaw hung slack, looking almost like it was gonna break right off and fall to the floor. My heart stopped altogether, seeing this. 

"Yooouuu..." hissed a voice that, for sure, *wasn't*  Zane's. His mandible swung limply around, dangling from his upper jaw. "Yoooouuu aaarrreee trressspaaassssiiinng!"

"W-What?!" I asked. "What're you talking about?! Zane, what's your deal?!" He took a wobbly, disjointed step towards me.

Shakily raising his hand, Zane pointed to me and hissed, "Thhiisss isss ouurr laaannd! Yyyooouu arrree boothh tressspaassserrsss! Yyyooou arrrreee noooott wellcommee heeerrrreee!" 

A lump formed in my throat. By this point, I'm surprised I was even able to stand up at all from how bad my legs shook. I was lost, speechless, confused, but most of all; I was downright *terrified*! What was I supposed to say? What could I *do?* Hell, was there anything I *could* do? 

He took another step toward me. Then another, and another; holding his finger out to me. "Iiifff yyyooouuu waannntt thhiiissss llaaannndd, yyyooouuulll haaavvveee ttooo paaayy wiiiittthhh blllooooddd!" Suddenly, he sprang at me, bounding through the air at me with his arms outstretched to grab me. Thinking quicker than I thought possible, I turned and started running in time to dodge him. I heard him land behind me and begin chasing after me. 

He let out a shrill sort of screeching noise when I'd made it back past the cleaning supplies and I heard a *thud,* followed by the clattering of the merchandise onto the floor. Against all better judgement or common sense, I swung the light around to look behind me. There he was, hot on my tail, crouch-running across the top shelves, bounding from one aisle to the next like a fuckin' panther!

I couldn't see anything else in the dark. This caused me to end up tripping and falling flat on my face. Before I could try and get back up again, he was on me. With another startling shriek, Zane bounded down from the shelf and landed on top of me, pinning me down. I struggled, writhing and fighting against him, but it was no use. Even though, under any normal circumstances, I could've *easily* out-bulked this guy, being at least 50 to 75 pounds heavier than him (not to mention the fact that I've been hitting the gym three times a week for the past six months now).

But not this time, not now. Somehow, his hold on me felt stronger than a bear trap now. I couldn't move! He started pounding hard on my chest with his fists. Each hammering blow knocked more and more of my breath out of me. He then took to driving his fist straight into my nose, soon busting it wide open. I became dizzy, stars exploding across my vision more and more with each hit. 

Faintly, I could hear him hiss, "Onnlyyy oonnnneee caaannn haaavvvveee thhissss laaannndd! Oonnnee offf uuusssss mmmuuuussssssttt diiiieeee!" He raised back up, rearing back his bloodied fist for one last strike. Using the last smidgeon of strength I had in me, deep down, I jabbed both of by thumbs into both of his coal-black eyes and shoved him off of me into the shelf behind him. He was sent headfirst into the shelf, knocking him dizzy. This gave me the opportunity to shuffle back to my feet and shamble as fast as I could the rest of the way to the front. 

Making it to the door, I grabbed the handle and attempted to fling it open to run like hell out of there, when I realized the door wouldn't open. I jerked and jerked furiously on it; enough so that, if it was a normal occasion, I probably would've ended up ripping the door right off. Now, though, It wasn't budging a bit.

Behind me, I could hear Zane stomping down the aisle towards where I was. This made me jerk even harder and more desperately on the handle for another thirty seconds before giving up when I heard him halfway down the medicine aisle. It was when I started to see him close enough to come into view that I made a beeline for the bathroom, where I am now, typing this out. 

I need help. I don't know what to do. I've tried calling, but, for whatever reason, the call isn't going through. I can't get out. *I'm trapped!* 

I think it's something going on with whatever's happened to Zane. He said that only one of us could "Have the land". That one of us had to die. That's it, isn't it? This has to be some sort of tournament of blood sport ritual by the Native tribe that died here. 

That explains the chanting and the drums, both of which, I still constantly hear. I guess that's why there hasn't been any customers, either.  See, from out of the small window above the restroom sink, I saw that it stayed pitch dark all day today. At least, it did here at the store, even if it seemed, judging from the normal looking posts I saw on Facebook and lack of posts asking what was going on with the sky or anything else. In other words, the shit going on here at  “Vicker’s Super smart Supermarket”, seems to be strictly restrained to this place as well, which is how I'm able to reach out at all, despite not being able to actually call for help. 

I can still hear him out there, roving around, hunting for me. I guess I'm lucky he must've not seen me run in here. That said, it's been an entire day now. I can't hide here in the bathroom much longer. This, whatever this is, isn't gonna end until either me or him is dead. 

I don't know how, or even *if I can* actually kill him. I don't *want to.*  I didn’t want ANY of this shit. *Hell, I just wanted to go home!* But one way or another, once I'm finished with this, I think I'm gonna have to go out there... and one way or another, I'm gonna have put an end to this.

&#x200B;

We arrived at the Paris, Ontario facility today. I can’t remember the last time I’ve been this excited.  Laboratory results have remained promising over the past three years, so I suppose it was a given that they would give us the opportunity to run field trials on Minodizem. But despite knowing that this was coming, I’m still as giddy as a small child now that it’s finally here.

&#x200B;

The Administration Board was kind enough to purchase this property for us, and hire some men to care for the livestock while we monitor the results. I suspect that they expect us to sit back and let the help do all the work, but I’d be lying if I said I wasn’t a little excited to experience farm life again. I grew up on a farm similar to this. Smaller, sure. But similar. So it’s a little nostalgic for me to be out here.

&#x200B;

My colleague, Dr. Hoeltzel doesn’t seem quite so enthusiastic. But he’s a city boy through and through. I’m sure that he’ll come around eventually, and it’s not like we’re that far from civilized society for Christ's sake. Dr. Hoeltzel and I have drafted an outline of how the experiment will go. We will have two groups of twenty cows. Group A will receive a dosage of Minodizem mixed into their water. Group B will not.

&#x200B;

We will observe the effect on the animals over the next 12 months, slaughtering 3-5 of them at 6 month intervals to analyze how much meat comes from the cattle from both groups A and B. If our findings are consistent, we should be seeing a 15-25% greater yield of muscle tissue from the cows in Group A.

&#x200B;

We will also be examining them for potential side effects from prolonged exposure to the drug and testing the meat thoroughly after slaughter to guarantee it remains fit for human consumption. It will be a long process, yes. But I’ve stayed with the project this long and this is the part where things finally get interesting.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

As the first month of testing draws to a close, I have noticed that things are proceeding well. As I’ve noted in my experiment logs, we’ve already begun to notice muscle growth in Group A. The cows are noticeably larger than the ones in Group B. Not by much, but there is a difference.

&#x200B;

That in mind, it would be reckless of me not to mention the potential side effects noted by Dr. Hoeltzel.

&#x200B;

He's noted an increase in aggression amongst Group A. The animals have been observed to behave in what appears to be a more temperamental manner, and we had at least one fight break out between two bulls in Group A last week. I'm hoping that it's nothing to worry about. But I also am not willing to discount my colleagues' observations. While so far, we've had no major incidents, we will note every instance that could be evidence for heightened aggression in the animals.

&#x200B;

On another note - I've noticed some changes in one of the barn cats, Sweet Peach. She and the other cat are meant to keep the mice out but I've noticed them drinking from the same water Group A is given.

&#x200B;

We've tried to keep them away and it's worked on the other cat, Mango Tango. But Sweet Peach is evidently the more stubborn of the two… And I'll admit I've noticed the change. Sweet Peach has gained some muscle mass over the past month. She was a very petite cat when we arrived but now, she seems so much larger. I know Dr. Hoeltzel is rather upset about this, but personally, I see it as an interesting opportunity.

&#x200B;

While I'd rather Sweet Peach not have ingested the growth hormones, she does not seem to be suffering any ill effects and Mark, our veterinarian on site says she's still perfectly healthy. The only change is that there's now simply more of her to love… Literally.

&#x200B;

As per Dr. Hoeltzel’s request, I’ll still try and keep her away from the water and I’ve told the two lead farmhands on site, Hank and Derrick to watch and make sure none of the cats are drinking from Group A’s water. But I’ll still keep an eye on her as the experiment progresses. Who knows. We might learn something.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Research Journal of Dr. Maurice Palacios**

**May 22nd, 2017**

&#x200B;

The experiment is still progressing as expected. As outlined in my lab notes, the muscle growth in Group A is developing along our projected rate. This is ideal and in this regard, the experiment does seem to be set up for success. However, Dr. Hoeltzel has continued to raise concerns about the animals aggression and I’d be lying if I said he didn’t have a point.

&#x200B;

So far, there have been no major incidents. No injuries to our staff or to the other animals. Only a few skirmishes between the bulls, and a couple of instances where some of the animals behaved more aggressively than usual towards some of the farmhands. We’ve also noticed some normal issues in Group B as well, but I think it’s safe to say that they occur with greater frequency in Group A.

&#x200B;

Dr. Hoeltzel and I have discussed this at length and are currently talking with the project heads about what an acceptable level of increased aggression is, as well as effective countermeasures and potential tweaks to the formula. While we wait for a verdict, we have both made excessive documentation of instances of aggression between both groups to try and get a solid number on just how much more aggressive the animals are becoming. It may ultimately end up being a non issue, and so long as we are transparent about the potential side effects, we may still be allowed to take this to market. We’ll see.

&#x200B;

In other news, I’ve still been keeping an eye on Sweet Peach and Mango Tango. The latter has not displayed any noticeable change and still seems the same dumb calico cat he’s always been. Sweet Peach on the other hand has stabilized in her muscle growth ever since we were stricter about keeping her away from Group A’s water supply. Her health is still great but there has been another interesting development.

&#x200B;

She’s pregnant.

&#x200B;

Apparently, Mango Tango is quite the little Don Juan.

&#x200B;

I’ve asked Mark to keep an eye on her during her pregnancy as we don’t have a lot of data on what, if any effects Minodizem has on pregnant animals. Ideally, there won’t be any at all. Admittedly, that is something we were hoping to learn through these trials, although I expected our subjects to be cows, not cats. Still, it couldn’t hurt to have those results.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Research Journal of Dr. Maurice Palacios**

**June 12th, 2017**

&#x200B;

My Father used to say that no news is good news. Progress with the experiment has continued along the projected parameters. It’s reassuring that the model we created while observing the effects of the compound in the lab continues to apply here. Group A has gained a fair bit of muscle mass and it’s starting to become increasingly obvious at a glance. A month ago, the differences were mostly only visible when you more closely examined a subject from both groups side by side. But now its obvious even from the fields. In this regard, I’m happy… But unfortunately, it’s not the experiment that makes me want to write.

&#x200B;

It’s Sweet Peach.

&#x200B;

Mark is already concerned by her pregnancy. He’s determined that she’s about halfway along and the kittens should be born within the next month or so, and that so far has been the most normal thing with it so far. Within the past month, Sweet Peach’s body has become dramatically distorted by the pregnancy. A few weeks ago, I noticed that she had become less active. Now she rarely leaves the barn and sits in a nest of hay and her aggression has spiked considerably.

&#x200B;

We found Mango Tango dead in the barn a week ago. From the looks of it, Sweet Peach was the one who killed him. This is shocking, considering they had gotten along so well just a few short months ago. Then again, back then Sweet Peach had been a far more approachable and affectionate cat, as her name suggested. Now she hisses whenever anyone comes near. We’ve needed to lace her food with a sedative to allow Mark to even get a look at her during her checkups.

&#x200B;

Speaking of Mark, he has performed an ultrasound on the kittens. I’ve seen the scans… It’s not good. The unborn kittens appear to have already grown significantly larger than normal. Their size, combined with lack of space in the womb has caused issues with most of their development. Bones are not forming as they should, some of the fetuses have even started to fuse together or cannibalize each other… Chances are, the kittens will be stillborn. Their deformities they will have developed in the womb will make their survival unlikely if not impossible and Mark does not seem hopeful about Sweet Peach’s chances of survival either.

&#x200B;

I’ve shared this information with Dr. Hoeltzel and we’ve discussed at length what to do. Neither of us is keen to terminate the experiment at this early stage, but with the threat of birth defects in our subjects, we couldn’t possibly take Minodizem to market. We would need time to rework the formula to eliminate this risk.

&#x200B;

The only reason that this is even a discussion is because it’s Sweet Peach who’s suffering these effects, not the test group. Admittedly, this product was never meant for cats, and so it having a negative side effect on cats wasn’t something we ever thought we’d need to worry about. We’ve documented everything for now and will have to include it in our final reports, but as horrible as this is it may not be a valid reason to kill Minodizem. Not yet at least…

&#x200B;

Dr. Hoeltzel and I have however concluded that we will need to test and see if there are any birth defects in Group A. We have a few pregnant cows in that herd, and we’ve arranged to breed several others.

&#x200B;

We will have 3 Group A cows inseminated by Group A bulls. 3 Group A cows inseminated by Group B bulls. And 3 Group B cows inseminated by Group A bulls. As a control  group, we will have some inseminations amongst Group B as well.

&#x200B;

We will monitor these pregnancies over the next year and see how they develop. If we can determine no significant risk of birth defects, then we will discuss proceeding from there. If we discover similar results to what has become of Sweet Peach, we will need to shut this program down and go back to the drawing board. I hope to God we don’t need to go that far… But if it must be done, it must be done.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Sweet Peach died today.

I didn’t witness the birth. None of us did. We simply found her and the kittens in the barn.

I feel…

Responsible…

&#x200B;

Dr. Hoeltzel says there was no way we could have known. We did what we could to keep Sweet Peach away from the water. But I recall a time not that long ago where I admitted to being curious about the effects that Minodizem would have on a cat. Now I know.

&#x200B;

Mark was right. The birth was clearly… Traumatic… The kittens did not survive. We counted 5 bodies. Mark says he had expected 6, but it’s possible something came into the barn and took one. There are foxes in the area.

&#x200B;

I suggested burying Sweet Peach and the kittens out by the woods, beside Mango Tango. So that’s what we did today. We buried them.

&#x200B;

God, I’m wondering if I should just talk to Dr. Hoeltzel about canceling the project right now… This is not what we set out to do. This is not an acceptable result! I know… We’ve poured years of our lives into this. We have commitments. We still have tests to run. I should know better than to throw it all away because the side effects on a different species are horrible.

&#x200B;

I just…

&#x200B;

I suppose I just don’t feel okay with what has happened. I don’t like the idea that our work caused this. I miss Sweet Peach. I miss Mango Tango…

&#x200B;

As for the project itself… I don’t fucking care.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Research Journal of Dr. Maurice Palacios**

**July 20th, 2017**

&#x200B;

Just what we needed… Dead cows.

&#x200B;

Something killed three of the cattle in Group A yesterday, while they were out in the field. We found two bodies. The third was missing.

&#x200B;

Hank says he saw some sort of large animal in the field but didn’t get a good look at it. He suspected it might’ve been a fox or a coyote, but wasn’t sure. I’ve asked him and Derrick to keep a look out. We need to find whatever is responsible and kill it fast before it decides it can just start picking off our herds.

&#x200B;

We accounted for some animal loss due to predators but I’m still furious. Perhaps it’s just the way the past month has been… I’m exhausted. Maybe I need to take some time away… Go home for a few days and clear my head.

&#x200B;

Dr. Hoeltzel will go and visit his family for a few days at a time. It’s not like the project requires our constant supervision. So what’s the harm in taking a few days away? Then again, I am still quite comfortable here… What does my apartment have that this place doesn’t?

&#x200B;

Hmm… What if I went hunting? See if I can’t find that fox or coyote…

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Research Journal of Dr. Maurice Palacios**

**August 4th, 2017**

&#x200B;

Hank disappeared last night.

&#x200B;

We heard a commotion out by the barn. Some of the animals from Group B were agitated. I thought it might be that coyote again. It’s been harassing us for the past few weeks and we haven’t been able to kill it. Hank took the rifle and went out… I heard some gunshots. But he never came back.

&#x200B;

The rest of us remained in the house.

&#x200B;

I swear I saw something walking around in the dark… Something big. Not a coyote or a fox. A bear maybe? No… It wasn’t bulky enough to be a bear. A mountain lion, perhaps? But out here? In Paris? I would’ve said it was unlikely… But now? I don’t know.

&#x200B;

We went out to look this morning. We found six dead cattle. A lot of blood. No sign of Hank. I talked to Derrick about taking the gun and going out but he advised against it. Instead, we just contacted the police. They’re doing a sweep of the property now but I don’t know if they’ll find anything. I think we’re all afraid of the worst right now…

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Research Journal of Dr. Maurice Palacios**

**August 12th, 2017**

&#x200B;

I saw it.

Out in the field this morning.

I saw it.

It’s not a cougar. It’s not a bear.

It’s…

Oh God, I’m fucking laughing.

It’s a fucking *kitten*.

&#x200B;

A fucking 6 foot tall kitten was standing over one of my goddamn cows this morning, gorging itself on its entrails…

&#x200B;

I stared at it for the longest time, not sure I could even believe my eyes… It has to be one of Sweet Peach’s… The shape of its body… Crooked. Malformed. Wrong. It walks with a strange gait as if its legs aren’t quite the way it should be. The face has an odd shape to it. The fur is patchy and looks to be falling off in some places and it is almost too thin but there is no mistaking that it is a kitten.

&#x200B;

I took the gun and shot at it of course… It just ran off, moving a hell of a lot faster than it had any right to. I’ve told the others. They don’t believe me. But I know what I saw. It’s a kitten…

&#x200B;

*It’s a fucking kitten…*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Research Journal of Dr. Maurice Palacios**

**August 18th, 2017**

&#x200B;

Mark did not come in today.

&#x200B;

We called his cell phone. No answer. It just rang before going to voicemail. We called his wife. She said he’d already left for work.

&#x200B;

Derrick started to think that maybe he’d run into some car trouble and went out to look for him. Turns out he was right.

&#x200B;

He called us from the side of the road about thirty minutes later. He’d found Mark’s car in a ditch…No sign of Mark. But judging from the blood he found, something had clearly attacked the car.

&#x200B;

I didn’t have the heart to tell Dr. Hoeltzel that I know what happened to him. He still doesn’t believe me about the Kitten thing. I don’t know if it recognized him or what… I don’t know if it’s done this before, or if this was the first time.

&#x200B;

*I don’t fucking know anything!*

&#x200B;

Derrick hasn’t come back. He’s not answering our calls now. Dr. Hoeltzel’s called the police. I’m sure they’ll find Derricks car on the side of the road, abandoned. But I doubt they’ll find him.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Research Journal of Dr. Maurice Palacios**

**August 23rd, 2017**

&#x200B;

That’s it.

The project is done.

&#x200B;

Something entered the barn last night and killed the last of Group A. There were a few missing bodies and we found a couple of them in the woods. Dr. Hoeltzel is furious… He thinks someone is sabotaging us. I haven’t brought up the Kitten thing again. Last time I did, we got into an argument. He’s adamant that I’m joking.

&#x200B;

But he hasn’t seen it for himself. Not like I have.

It’s out there.

&#x200B;

He left this afternoon. I hope he’ll make it home safe. But I really don’t know for sure. Evidently our hungry friend is watching the roads and being in a car doesn’t seem to deter him. I wonder how big he is now?

&#x200B;

I’ve thinking about leaving too. But truth be told, the thought of going out onto the road right now scares me. It’s a good fifteen minute drive until the highway. That’s fifteen minutes of exposure. A lot can go wrong in that amount of time.

&#x200B;

I’ve been reading the news. Some of the folks around us are complaining about dead animals. There’ve been a few disappearences and unusual car accidents as well. It’s clearly expanding its hunting ground. How long until someone else gets a good look at it?

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Research Journal of Dr. Maurice Palacios**

**August 25th, 2017**

&#x200B;

Dr. Hoeltzel has not returned home. I didn’t bother calling the police. Two officers have already disappeared nearby… One of them searching for the first missing officer. They’re going to find it soon. When they do, they’re likely going to kill it.

&#x200B;

I don’t see that as a bad thing. Just a necessary thing. That thing… It’s almost certainly in pain. Every waking moment of its life must be the most unfathomable pain possible. I think that killing it would be a mercy. But when they do, what will they find, I wonder? They’re going to look at it. Pick it apart. Dissect it. What will they find? My name written all over it? The genetic fruits of my labor?

&#x200B;

Minodizem is dead. The project is over and honestly, good riddance. This is more than just a side effect. This is a fucking nightmare.

&#x200B;

I’m tired.

I don’t want to do this anymore.

&#x200B;

I’ve looked at my options and either way, I’m fucked. If I go back and report all this, my career is over. I’ll probably wind up in prison with Hank, Mark, Derrick and Dr. Hoeltzel… Stevens… blood on my hands. If I stay here, it’s only a matter of time until the Kitten comes looking for me. Hell, I might not even make it to the road. So far, nobody else has! Why fight it?

&#x200B;

I considered taking the rifle and going out on my own terms, but come now… This is my mistake. I deserve to face the consequences.

&#x200B;

I’d just like to say that I’m sorry. To whoever finds this journal… I hope you were able to kill it. I truly hope you were. Like I said before, it’s probably an act of mercy. As for me, chances are that I’m long dead.

&#x200B;

See, as soon as I’m done here I’m going outside and waiting for it to find me. Chances are, it’s not going to be a pleasant way to die… [But for what I’ve done, I deserve it.](https://www.reddit.com/r/HeadOfSpectre/)

Clearly the computer had had enough. Maybe I had too. I decided to make a sandwich. Then I took a long bath and tried to tune out my mental buzz. 

Once I was reasonably dry, I went back to the screen. It was 3:33 AM, a terrible time to be awake. I was tired, very tired. But perhaps too tired for something so reasonable as sleep. So I did it one more time—*Ctrl+A Ctrl+C Ctrl+X Ctrl+V*—and Notepad shut down on its own. 

I didn’t report the crash to Microsoft. In the back of my mind, I always wondered if they’d get a briefing of what I’d been doing that led to the passive aggressive existential unraveling of their thoughtfully constructed program. They’d probably put me on a list or something. *Useless Misanthropes - to be killed first in the great Microsoft Windows defenestration.*

I looked at the clock again. 3:32 AM. Hmm. 

It didn’t seem entirely fair that time should start backpedaling just because I had reached a level of dullness that Buddhist monks might quietly envy, but maybe it was my fault. I hadn’t really done anything to stop it. Defending myself against chronological entropy was the sort of thing that would take effort. I saved all my effort for Thursdays where the weekend was so close that no one would take notice and then make the mistake of expecting something of me. 

Today was….possibly Tuesday. Who fucking knows. 

By…3:15 AM…I had decided that Pornhub seemed like an appropriate use of my dark-room rectangular-screen-tunnel existence. I typed ‘Latina.’ *Ctrl+A Ctrl+X*. It felt problematic for some reason. ‘Sex.’ *Enter*.

**0 results.**

Huh. ‘Sex.’ *Enter*.

**0 results. \*For you, you worthless piece of shit.** 

Ah…Right. My eyes had begun to sting. I shut them for just a moment. A long blink really. But when I opened them, it was morning. 7:13 AM according to my happily gyrating screen saver. 

Four hours of sleep give or take. A normal-ish amount I supposed, but not enough to fix the fatigue of the previous night, just enough to stave off death for another day. 

I tapped the Space bar and was prompted for my password. Fuck. My knuckles hurt. Bloody. Why I always seemed bloody or bruised or achy in the mornings, I couldn’t say. WebMD had told me that it meant cancer most likely. The kind of cancer that only prescription Cialis could remedy. *One easy trick for rock hard dick and flaccid everything else*, I think the ad had said. Or maybe the internet was running together, melting into an indistinct puddle of BUY NOW and SEE TITS and YOU’RE TERRIBLE. Oh well. 

**Password:** `Password1`\ 

*Enter*

My browser was waiting for me in the same way that Beth wasn’t. She’d yelled the night she left, told me that she couldn’t be with someone so utterly devoid of passion as me. I think I responded with something daring like, “I mean, if that’s how you feel…”. She made a sound that I imagine a wounded herd animal might make. I stayed quiet like flavorless grass. 

Maybe she was the reason I always came back to porn during the dullest parts of my nightly communion with the computer. If that were true though, I wondered why it was that I had opened the three tabs that led in some inscrutable sequence from Pornhub to LiveJasmine to DeadRose to HeartHappi. 

HeartHappi looked like the kind of website that would sell hand cream to sporty white moms. A model smiled flirtatiously over a cup of cappuccino with styled foam; the font choice was modern, playful, but the words on the screen said:

**HOW NOT TO KILL**

My name looming in the top right corner of the page suggested that I’d already created an account. I wondered if I’d somehow sleep walked through a financial transaction for the privilege. Probably, though the day being possibly a Wednesday meant that I would have to ward off courting more depression until at least the weekend. It was better not to check my bank account. Its balance was too conspicuous, judgmental. No. I was a HeartHappi member for the time being. I accepted it and *Scrolled*.

**Studies show that blood under your fingernails…**
    
**…cathartic killing was reportedly not…**    

**…but then I realised that I liked the screams more than the actual death.” *-Elle B., Leeds, UK*…**   

There was so much text that I actually unfrowned when I got to something easier—an imbedded video. 7:—uh…or rather—*6:58* AM was just too early for reading in earnest. I *clicked*. The video loaded. 

A soothing ebb and flow of Muzak played and I watched as a youthful racial-everywoman spread peanut butter on a piece of toast with a big fucking kitchen knife. She was smiling, beautiful, perfect teeth gleaming unattainably as she made the motions of talking without actually saying anything. Another knife scoop of peanut butter plopped onto the bread; too much peanut butter. She spread it over the sides of the bread and onto the fashionable countertop below it. The knife blade screeched across polished marble. She kept smiling. More peanut butter. The knife was getting close to her hand. Too close. She wasn’t paying attention. I was starting to sweat. And then she screamed as the knife sliced into the side of her index finger. The Muzak stopped and the words:

**STEP 1: REMEMBER TO BUY JELLY**

flashed across the screen. The woman looked to the left of camera, terror welling in her eyes as she gripped her bloody hand. Finally she said something. 

“No! NO! GET THE FUCK AWAY FROM M—“

**HeartHAPPI**™    
***Find a better you.***

I fluttered my eyes uneasily, my brain trying to process what I’d just watched. Maybe I was hungry? Or nauseous? For some reason I couldn’t tell which, but I did know that I needed to buy jelly. Jelly would fix most of my problems—it was a notion that I glossed over in that autonomic way that one does with things that need no internal debate. 

A trip to the grocery store was absolutely out of the question though. I considered Amazon momentarily, but then my eyes roved to the top of the HeartHappi webpage, to the word **SHOP** nestled right next to **Charlie Beckwith**.  My simple useless name. 

*Click*

The online store was minimalistic, boutiquey. A picture of a handsome man smiling over a cash register and a single item for sale. 

**HeartJELLY**

**Price: $A,MOU.NT**

I stared at that price, sneering at how much sense every part of this website somehow made to an addled mind. My vision blurred. The part of my brain that typically processed misgivings followed suit. I needed that fucking jelly. An economist would have called my predicament the resulting price evaluation of demand inelasticity. But I wasn’t an economist, I was a sentient cursor, drawn by some ancient reptilian impulse toward a GooglePay icon. 

*Click*

My purchase confirmation had a time stamp. 5:22 AM. A perfect time to unwake. I closed my eyes and

…

“You like this wet pussy, Charlie?”

My eyes crept open to the familiar SoCal hues of the HeartHappi website.  *I* was wet, soaked really, and smelling pungently of some vaguely familiar chemical. I rubbed away sleep from my eyes, tried to focus on the screen, on the unmistakable (but notably blurry) shape of a naked woman. Did HeartHappi do porn?  

I listened to the glistening chewed banana sound of autoeroticism and tried to reach a sensible answer to the question. But my eyes continued to lag at resolving my sense of sight. Maybe I liked it?

“Um…it—uh—*sounds* good,” I replied. Had she said my name?

“It *looks* even better, Charlie. Just unblur me.”

Something about me still felt hungseous.  When was the last time I’d thrown up?  The question immediately rang as bizarre in my head. When was the last time I’d *eaten*? That was the normal question, right?

“You wanna eat *me*, Charlie?  Unblur me.”

Hmm... I had thought about eating. I don’t think I had said anything about it.  Something wasn’t right. Why would a hand cream website for sporty white moms also host porn?…and only sell jelly? 

“Because milfs are trending, Charlie. So is fitness. Now unblur me, you fucking pussy.”

She was a little hostile for a cam girl, still blurry, but the rest of the website no longer was. There was an **UNBLUR** button at the bottom of the screen. My cursor hovered. I enjoyed female nudity. And I was terrible with confrontation. But in a way, cam girl’s hostility competed with the words at the top of the screen:

**STEP 2: BE OBLIVIOUS. DO NOT LOOK.**

“Charlie….” she mewled. 

Oh, fuck it. 

*Click*

She became clear and everything else abruptly did the opposite. 

“Beth? What—how are you—what is this?”

It was her, unequivocally, undeniably, impossibly her, but her voice was wrong. And she was smiling, a strained hostage situation senior portrait kind of smile. And she was in my bedroom?

“I like this new rule breaking side of you, Charlie,” the voice that wasn’t Beth’s said. “It’s kinda sexy.”  Nude Beth didn’t talk; she never stopped smiling, but she made hand gestures to follow the speech. 

“What’s happening?” I asked.  “Why are you doing porn?”

Porn Beth shrugged. Phone-sex-voice not-Beth answered, “Cause I like to squirt, Charlie.”

Beth nodded vigorously but she was…crying. Crying and grinning a broad teeth-gritting grin. 

“Wanna see my pussy, Charlie?”

“Stop saying my name.”

Beth shook her head rapidly, eyes suddenly stricken. The camera panned down. To me. Lying on my keyboard, asleep, illuminated by the glow of my monitor. I was wearing the same clothes in the video that I was wearing at that moment…and also a headband with cat ears. Beth started huffing, shaking as she reached off-camera and produced a can of lighter fluid. 

“Watch me squirt, Charlie.”

“Stop saying my name!”—squirt—“Beth, baby, stop, okay?”—squirt, smile, terror, squirt—“Beth! Are you fucking crazy? Put the lighter down!”—shick, shick—“Beth! Please!”—shickshickshick—

The feed cut. 

**HeartHAPPI**™    
***Find a better you.***

I had smelled chemicals earlier. I was still wet, suddenly aware of fabric clinging to my skin, and as I reached to touch my head, I felt a triangle of fur, an ear. What was happening to me? Fuck. Fuck fuck fuck FUCK!

I looked at the time. It was 2:00 AM. I was tired. Where was that goddamn jelly?

…

The following (or possibly previous) morning came with a Gestapo-y knock at the door. I startled awake in bed. The time on my alarm clock was…irrelevant. 88:88 AM/PM. Not a real time, I was fairly certain. The knock came again, louder the second time, insistent. 

“Coming! Hang on!”

I answered my door the way an agoraphobe or shy child might, huddled behind it, peeking out tentatively toward the prospective hell of another (possibly talkative) human being. But no one was there. A massive plastic drum stood imposingly in the hall instead, marked *HeartJELLY (Proprietary Electrode Gel)*. 

My jelly had arrived!

I felt an odd sense of relief wash over me. But only for a moment. I looked beyond the drum. The elevator door just outside my own was open. There was no car, just a yawning shaft exhaling transient, brain-licking vertigo. I didn’t like it one bit, but as I gawked despite myself, I saw something written on the back wall of the shaft:

**STEP 3:** and an arrow pointing down. 

I knew I shouldn’t look. It was crazy.  I hated heights. I lived on the ninth floor. I shouldn’t look. But I had already crossed the distance between my door and the shaft. I looked upward first—*why was I doing this*?—and saw the bottom of the elevator car a floor above. Treacherously dangling, an Otis brand guillotine caked in thick brown rust. I shivered. And then I looked down. *Why*?  Something about it felt necessary. Deep black hole. Nothing interesting. Just—I squinted into the darkness, blinked—two dull flashes of light, round shifting flashes…nocturnal eyes…*a face*…and then a whisper. 

“*Jump*.”

I toppled backward onto the floor behind me, grabbed my jelly drum and heaved it, watching, terrified, as a long hand rose into the shaft. It popped three or four feet down its forearm. The flesh bulged around an ad hoc joint and the arm angled downward toward the ground, it began swiping around near my feet. I heaved again. The drum moaned against the tile floor. The fingers crawled spiderishly, searching. *Fuck!* Another heave. Another moan. Another. And I crossed my threshold. I kicked the door shut, then jumped to lock it and crumpled to the floor. 

What the fuck.

Step 1: Done. 

What the fuck. 

Step 2: Failed. 

What the fuck!

Step 3: Not a chance in hell.

I heard a soft knock at the door and shrunk away from it. Why was this happening? What was that thing in the elevator shaft?  Nine stories up. Nothing below. Its eyes had looked up from the center of the darkness. A massive spindly nightmarish thing. Impossible. 

*knockknockknock*

Impossible…wasn’t it?

I crawled to my bedroom, stomach heavy, twisting spasmodically every time I heard—or thought I heard—another knock at the door. The numbers on my bedside alarm clock jittered and cycled manically as I drew up the covers. Noon. 2:39 AM. 3:78 PM. 

11:11:11:11:11 M.

I closed my eyes and made a wish as soft knocks at my windows joined those at my door. 

*Make it stop…please make it stop*

I was tired. So fucking tired. Why wouldn’t—it just—leave—me—alone—

…

“Charlie! Meal is almost ready! Wake up lazy bones!”

Huh? No. I was dreaming. The voice was impossible. 

“Charlie! You can’t sleep all unit, buddy!  We’ve gotta keep that heart happy!”

HeartHappi. Definitely dreaming. The voice was…mine. 

“CHARLIE!”

I peeled the covers off of my face. My alarm clock was dead, blood pooling beneath a crack down its center. Alarm clocks weren’t supposed to do that, were they? 

Fuck. Maybe I could…do…something…

Standing seemed like a good starting point. An achy starting point I realized, but it got me upright. I walked to the window. Opened the blinds. 

It wasn’t night, but it wasn’t day either. It was orange. Everything—the sky, the ground, amorphous approximations of buildings—all of them were a bright tangerine-ish shade of orange. I closed the blinds and tried not to think about what that meant. 

“Charlie! C’mon man! I made liquid meal! It’s gonna go all ephemeral if you wait too long!”

Something did smell like food—floral perfume and gin and imitation banana. Okay, so not like *food* exactly, but food adjacent. I left my room and dragged along toward the smells. A man was sitting at the little table in my kitchen

“Hey! Finally! Look—I made your favorite—reverie!”

He was wearing a gray cat costume, but one doused in something shiny and viscous. He ladled bright orange soup into a bowl and set it opposite his own. His face was…not right. 

“Who are you?” I demanded. “How did you get into my house?”

He laughed. *My laugh*. “Oh my glib, man. Hilarious. How are you always so *on* right after waking up? I’m so fucking jelly, dude.”

*Jelly*… Shit. I had left it out. This person had probably taken some. Maybe he took it all. But I needed it... 

“What did you do with my fucking jelly, you bastard cat?!” I shouted.  A deranged outburst. 

He sighed. Pointed behind me with a goopily sodden mitten hand. 

I turned…and screamed. 

My jelly drum was torn open, gutted, a ruin of twisted plastic and puddled clear gel. 

No. What had he done?  I needed it. I didn’t know why, but I did. Now everything was fucked. 

“Charlie…I can see you’re upset,” he commiserated treacherously. “Have some meal. It’ll cheer you up.”

I turned back toward him, livid, seething. His smallish porcelain doll face stared back at me, cheeks pink with mummer’s guilt, eyes black with sadistic indifference. His mitten hand raised a spoon awkwardly to his pursed lips, the spoon tilted, and orange soup poured over his porcelain chin and onto the white fur of his chest. 

“Yummy,” he whispered. 

And only in that moment did it register that I was looking at something absolutely terrifying. What was wrong with me? Fuck. My parasympathetic nervous system ignited, heart suddenly pounding, wrenching blood from my face. 

“What’s wrong buddy?” it asked. Another spoonful of orange. “You miss Beth, don’t you?”

I managed a shuddering breath in response. 

“Aww, cat got your lung?”

Nope. Fuck that. 

I shifted tentatively, testing the waters. The cat-thing didn’t move. So I bolted, ran for the front door to my apartment, flung it open. 

Stopped and nearly fell flat. 

Dozens of long, protuberant limbs now rose from the elevator shaft, groping around the walls, floors, ceiling—everywhere—*me*. One of the hands grabbed my ankle and squeezed hard enough that my foot prickled. Another took my arm a second later. 

“Charlie, I wouldn’t jump if I were you!” my voice called from behind me. “That thing’ll bend you in your straight parts.”

As soon as the cat said it, a hand found my knee and I felt a sharp strain on my shin bone. 

“Help!” I screamed. 

“Gimme a second buddy! Washing dishes! You wouldn’t believe how orange—“

“HELP ME!” 

More hands had found me, grabbed me; the two on my leg flexed toward each other. I was screaming. Hearing my pain and terror as a surreal spectator of something horrific. 

“NO! PLEASE! FU—^(crack)—UCK!”

I saw bone pierce my shin, stretching the skin like cellophane and I screamed away my last breath of consciousness.

…

“Charlie, Dora the Explorer band-aid or Sponge Bob?”

…

I was cold. I wanted Beth. I needed her. But she wasn’t coming back. 

…

“Charlie, I’m no doctor, but this legs is looking…”

…

I felt wet fur against my skin and…*pain*. She wasn’t coming back—my fault. I let her love me and then I let her down. I let her drink instead of sharing myself with her. She had finished a bottle of Tanqueray alone the day she left, the day I said nothing to keep her from leaving. But if I had just spoken, been present, she wouldn’t have—*pain*—the officer who came to my door had said—*pain*—the way he chewed his lip—*pain*—I called him a liar—*pain…PAIN!*

“Charlie, when I push the bone I can see it move under your skin. Yuck.”

I roused screaming, vomit joining the sound in my throat with a gurgle as the cat’s little doll face stared up at me from my legs. 

“Oh, good, you’re awake,” it said lightly. “It’s been hours buddy. I’m soooo bored.”

I was on my bed, a small comfort. But then I glanced at my leg. A mistake. Angry, bloody, swollen, bruised to hell and covered in a patchwork of children's band-aids. Sickening. But I was alive. Alive and tended to by a psychotic cat monster that had stolen my voice. A monster covered in *my jelly*. 

“W-what do you w-want?” I stammered, as my endorphins momentarily swallowed the sharpest pain and left me with ache and naked fear. 

The cat chuckled. “I want you to be better, Charlie.”

“What are you?”

“Well, I’m—*you*.  The happiest you and the saddest you…and the most adorable you…obvi.”

No. The cat had my voice, but this was a trick. It wanted me to suffer. And maybe—maybe I deserved it. 

“You ordered me, Charlie,” it continued. “You need me. Because I’m the better you. Or maybe you’re the better *me*. One of us surely. Hard to say… You got any pot?”

“What?”

“Never mind. Found a joint. You mind?”

“W-what?”

It lifted a thin cigarette to the pinhole between its pursed white lips. The joint swam in the loose glistening fur of its hand. But somehow the cat made it work. Next it produced a lighter—*shick-shick*—the sound made me wince but the flame caught quickly and the cat drew up a ragged ember. Smoke lolled out from its eye holes. I shivered.

“Charlie…do you wanna build a death ray?  With me, I mean.”

“What?”  Nothing about anything made sense. 

“It’s not—don’t worry Charlie, it’s a *humanitarian* death ray. Kind of a last step…”

The cat stubbed out the joint in its fur. “Here, I’ll show you.”  

It went to my desk, grabbed my laptop, brought it to me. My screen saver said **TI:ME.**  Looking at it, I realized that I had no clue what time it was, or what day for that matter. My living doldrums had erased my need for normal concerns. I was a middle train car, pulled along by some distant engine and held firm to an unknown trajectory by the circumstantial tracks below me. Nothing mattered. 

I entered my password and cringed at the sight of happy hues. The words on the screen were predictable, I supposed:

**HOW TO BUILD A HUMANITARIAN DEATH RAY**

**STEP 1: REMOVE TOAST.**

There was another imbedded video, something horrible probably, I didn’t care. 

*Click*

A close shot of a polished marble countertop, a slice of bread, too much peanut butter, blood. A pretty, pale olive-skinned hand with chartreuse nail polish swept awkwardly across the frame. Peanut butter clung to the clotted gash in the index finger. I watched, dread simmering in my gut.

“Why’d you buy those? Runts are like the worst kind of candy.”

My voice played through the speakers. From a conversation years passed. How…

“I don’t know. I like the bananas. Is that weird?” Beth’s voice.

“I mean…”

“You know what, I like ‘em. They’re like you, kinda.”

“What? Gross?”

“*Sweet*, dork. And nothing like you’d expect by looking at them, because they’re good. And yeah, a little gross.”

I heard my laugh. Her laugh. And as the camera began to pan backwards, my stomach turned. The pretty smiling racial-everywoman from the first HeartHappi video I’d seen was now mottled, head hanging limply, half-concealed by a blood-matted cascade of hair. Dead. But held aloft by strings like some nightmarish marionette. The word:

**REMOVED!**

flashed across the screen. 

The marionette girl hadn’t done anything. Nothing had changed, but the strings jerked and her hands sparred in the air in what looked like a mimicry of applause. Then the camera panned down toward the ground, past cables and gaffers tape, a soda can, a pair of shoes, and it settled on a chrome toaster sitting on the floor. 

**HappiFact: A standard consumer two-slice toaster has all the necessary components for constructing a functional death ray!**

**HeartHAPPI**™    
***Find a better you.***

The video ended. I needed to make a death ray. Immediately. I turned to the cat. 

“How do I do it?”

The cat sighed long. “It’s easy. One more video. No blood. No strings.” He gestured to my computer screen. 

**STEP 2: Ctrl+A Ctrl+C Ctrl+X Ctrl+V**

What? “I—I don’t understand.”

“It’s a stupid game, Charlie, but it’s your stupid game.  It’s one of the parts of you that she loved.”

I stared at the screen. What was I supposed to copy? I tried to find reason in the mystery, but my fingers acted on their own. Routine opened notepad. 

*Ctrl+A*

Nothing. 

*Ctrl+C*

Nothing. 

*Ctrl+X*

…Nothing. No fear, no pain, no doldrums, no guilt. Nothing. *Ctrl*... My index finger hovered over the *V* key. 

*Click*

Notepad crashed. My browser was waiting behind it. The HeartHappi website was playing a video—my bathroom, me. Me filling the tub, testing the water, me walking down the hall, toasting bread, making a peanut butter sandwich. 

Beth had always been particular about jelly, she went to special stores and bought special brands. I bought JiF peanut butter, ordinary, but chunky at least, I’m not a fucking monster. …She would’ve liked that joke. She would’ve laughed harder than it deserved, but she was good like that. She was the special to compliment my ordinary. And when she died, I didn’t think I deserved special anymore. I didn’t buy jelly, I bought peanut butter and settled for ordinary. 

In the video, I sat down at my little kitchen table and ate alone. I didn’t bother with a plate. When I was done eating, I stared for a long while, I was crying, fists clenched and then punching the brick wall that ran alongside the table. The video had no sound, but I could see the scream on my face. Pain. Then I stood, walked to the counter, unplugged the toaster from the wall. 

*A standard consumer two-slice toaster has all the necessary components for constructing a functional death ray...*

I watched me walk down the hall, back to the bathroom; I plugged in the toaster, pulled the lever, got in the tub and…let the toaster fall. I tried to tune out my mental buzz filling in the silent convulsions of an impossible me. 

That me sunk into the water, still. 

**HeartHAPPI**™    
***Stop copying yourself.***

The string of little green lights on my router had guttered out.  A light flickered in the hall. My A/C unit had fallen silent. 

“What the fuck did I just watch, cat?” I asked. 

No answer. 

I turned and saw a heap of wet gray fur and a little porcelain doll face piled on the floor.

&nbsp;

It took me a while to get it, but I did eventually. He—the cat—*was* me; a variation, a *copy*. The me that resigned himself to eating peanut butter sandwiches because buying jelly felt too much like admitting that she’d never buy it again. He was the me that drew a bath and didn’t come back to the computer. The me that took the pain. Ctrl+X, Ctrl+V—cut, paste. 

I was the me that lived, a me with memories and scabbed knuckles and broken bones…but I was alive. And I wasn’t better, not really. But in spite of all the terror and the dread and the pain, I was better than I was when the story began. And that’s not nothing. It might even be good enough.

Part 3.

'What you do mean he's back?' I screeched down the phone, 'I mean, where is he, is he in the house??'

'I mean he's back, I don't know what else that could possibly mean! And no, he's not came inside yet, I just saw him out the window sitting in the garden, just thought I'd phone you and let you know, I'm about to go out and see him'.

'NO!!'.

'What?'.

'Don't go out, just stay inside, please!' I had a horrible feeling she wasn't going to do what I told her but I had to try my best.

'Lock the doors and windows, don't let him in, just don't let him in, I'm on my way now!'.

'Why have I to not let him in, what's going on Danny?'

'Just don't fucking let him in.... please Mum'.

'Don't you speak to your mother like...'

'Okay, okay I'm sorry' I interrupted, 'can you just go and lock the doors now please, and check the windows'.

'You're scaring me Danny, what's going....'.

She trailed off as three loud knocks came at the door.

'Is that him?' I whispered.

'Two seconds, I'll go and look', Her nonchalant attitude was beginning to bug me.

About 20 seconds had passed.

'Mum!' I whispered loudly.

'It's... it's him, but something's not right! Why doesn't he just come in? He's just standing there with his back facing the door... Danny what's going on?'.

'I don't know, just lock the door, I'll be there soon'.

'Okay, bye' she said as I heard the locks clicking and clacking through the phone.

We rolled up slowly on our bikes, Brian was a bit behind me.

The house came into view but I couldn't see anyone in the garden.

As I got closer I could see the door was slightly ajar, I began to worry.

Brian saw too, 'Danny, you see that?'

'Yep, let's just be careful' 

I cautiously approached the doorway and noticed the wood had completely come away like the three locks had burst right through the frame.

I gently pushed the door open, Brian was practically on my back.

I looked all around as we entered, I could only really see up the stairs, part of the living room and into the kitchen.

We crept into the living room, nothing seemed to be disturbed.

A movement from above us startled us both.

I held my breath.

Another movement. 

'You should go up!' Brian whispered.

'I don't think so! You go!' I snapped back, keeping my voice hushed.

The noise turned to what I can only describe as dragging footsteps.

'Just go to the front door, we can see up the stairs from there'. I gestured for Brian to turn around and walk back to the hallway.

The door was still wide open, good incase we needed to make a sharp exit.

We quietly inched toward the bottom of the stairs, as we got closer I could see feet at the top.

Another step forward revealed a pair of shins.

We continued like this until I was able to see enough to confirm it was actually my Mum at the top, just standing there listening, leaning forward a few inches as if that somehow improves her hearing.

'Mum! I nearly had a heart attack!' I said as we all relaxed a little.

'Where is he?' I asked.

'I don't know, He kicked the door in, so I ran upstairs and hid in the cupboard', she looked pretty shaken up.

'Well... how long ago did he leave?'.

'I don't know, I was upstairs, I couldn't hear anything!'

'Right, okay. Mum, this is gonna sound a bit crazy but I really need you to believe me this time', I looked deep into her eyes, she nodded with her mouth partially open.

'It's not Dad, that wasn't him that came here, it's something either possessing him or mimicking him, something from that bell tower..' I saw her face change, she was losing interest.

'I'm serious Mum! This isn't a joke. Dad's car is at the bell tower all smashed up, look!'.

I pulled up the pictures and showed her, her jaw dropped slightly more.

'S-sooo! Is he *in* the tower?' She asked, stuttering.

'I don't know, I don't think so but we need to do something to stop all this happening, people around us are disappearing and it needs to stop!'.

She looked at Brian.

'Is this all true Brian, please don't play games!'.

'It's true... all of it, I've seen it myself!', Brian answered, turning to go back to the living room.

My Mum scoffed, shaking her head and walked away.

'Danny!' 

We all froze in fear.

I looked up the stairs.

My Dad was standing at the top, black pulsing veins wrapped his face, his yellow eyes like laser beams felt like they could have blinded me.

'Daaannyy boooy!' He growled as he took one step down.

I turned to my Mum and Brian, who both stood still like petrified wood with their mouths gaping.

'Run!!' I screamed, I turned and bolted out the door, grabbing the bike.

Brian was right behind me and shot off almost instantly, my Mum came scurrying out, constantly looking behind her while as she wailed in terror.

'Jump on!' I ordered.

She quickly got on the bike seat and gripped onto me, I stood up on the pedals and pushed with everything I had.

The chain came off and we both fell in a heap on the ground. 

I looked to Brian first who had pulled over and was shouting for us to get up.

Then I looked at the front door if my house.

My Dad was standing within the frame, almost crouching because he had grown taller.

His body looked like writhing vines wrapping themselves all around him, his legs had contorted in a way that having knees wouldn't allow and his face leaked a dark yellow and brownish fluid from every orifice.

His mouth foamed and spat in anger as he stomped onto the porch with his twisted legs that almost looked like the roots of a tree.

'Get back here Brian, get my Mum!', I called over, still struggling to process what was right in front of me.

Brian cycled over and was there in a flash, he helped my hysterical Mum onto the seat.

'What you gonna do?' Brian asked, slowly backing away from the advancing beast.

'I dont know, it doesn't matter just get her out if here, now! Meet at your house!'.

My Mum was visibly trembling as the climbed onto Brian's bike and they cycled off.

I stood up and faced my Dad, he had stopped in the middle of the garden.

A menacing low end growl slowly escaped his lips and he smiled his widest and stood up to full stretch, he looked to be about 8 or 9 feet high, his long arms almost down to his knees.

'Come and give your old Dad a hug, Son!' He said in a crackled, demonic tone.

I turned and ran as fast as I could down the street, screaming for help, screaming for anybody.

He gave chase, every one of his strides seemed to move the earth.

I turned the first corner and almost got smacked by a car.

I stood panting with my hands on the bonnet.

The driver looked terrified, I probably looked like a murdered on the run.

'Help me! Please!' 

The driver just stared at me, looking panicked.

He threw the car into gear and reversed.

I crumpled onto the road and rolled over to my back.

I just lay there, breathing rapidly staring at the sky, the clouds gave me the feeling I was moving.

Rain drops began to patter onto my head, I must have been lying there for about 5 minutes and nothing had happened.

Finally I got myself up to my feet, I noticed how empty the streets were as I looked around, I could hear nothing but the breeze.

I rounded the corner onto my street, nothing there.

I began to feel my body relax, my muscles loosen and my mind felt relieved.

Cautiously, I crept up towards my house, I could see my bike lying in the driveway.

The door to the house was flapping wildly, opening and banging shut nonstop... there was barely even any wind.

I hoped over the fence and shot in to grab the bike. 

I picked it up.

The door was still slamming behind me.

I looked around, the breeze had picked up, the silence of the empty streets was unnerving.

I fixed the chain and cycled off in the direction of Brian's house, the rain started to pick up and the streets seemed cold.

Brian's face was pressed against the window when his house came into view, he saw me and waved over.

I saw my Mum's head behind him, peeking over his shoulder.

I practically leaped off the bike and ran inside, Brian and my Mum had cups of tea and biscuits.

'Glad to see you two are all nice and cozy' I jested, Brian's house was warm, I was grateful for the heat.

'Kettle's just boiled, help yourself' Brian said.

'I'm good, we need to get a hold of these security people, see what information we can drag out of them'.

'What you gonna ask them?' Brian asked with a mouth full of biscuits.

'I don't know, but something about the door not being able to close might be the key here, I saw something like that in my dream, the door flapping around wildly after Shawn kicked it in, then they were all standing at the door in the picture I tried to take, I don't know, it's the best idea I have right now!'.

I got the picture of the sign up on my phone and zoomed in.

**Nevis Security**  

**Taking security to new heights**  

**01397701333**  

I looked confused at the sign... 'New heights?' I laughed, looking at Brian, 'I have literally never seen a single security guard or vehicle anywhere near there!'.

'What a great security company!' Brian said sarcastically shaking his head before having a drink of his tea.

'Anyway, let's phone them', I said, punching the number into my phone.

'What is this for? Who is it you're phoning?' My Mum butted in.

'It's a long story, we don't have time' I replied, listening to the ringing intently, waiting for someone to answer.

'Nevis security!' A Male voice came from the receiver. 

'Oh, uhm, Hi! My name is... John... and I'm wondering if you can help me out with some information about the old bell tower, near Ben Nevis!?'.

'What kind of information?', the guy sounded stern, almost unfriendly.

'We were wondering who owns the grounds, or even the building?'

'The building and the grounds are owned and operated by the council Sir, we just make sure nobody gets in there, it's dangerous!' He said proudly, I could almost imagine him sitting with his chest puffed out.

I rolled my eyes and glanced at Brian.

'Okay, well I saw some kids up there and it looks like they've snapped the lock and the latch off, so the door is just wide open now'.

There was a long pause...

He came back after about 60 seconds.

'Hi there, sorry for the wait, I'm just going to put you through to my manager, he would like to have a word with you if that's okay!?'

'Oh! Okay no problem'.

'Hold the line please, sir'.

After a few minutes of this horrible plinky plunky music, another man answered, his voice was more alert and intimidating.

'Hello there Sir! I would like to know what it is exactly you saw at the bell tower!' 

I dont know why, but I felt very reluctant to tell this guy anything.

'I, I saw 3 kids, or more like teenagers, they were standing in the doorway and a large section of the door had been broken, it was just flapping about in the wind' I explained, not knowing what to expect.

'Did you not recognise any of them?' He asked sharply.

'Well.... no, no I didn't recognise any of them!' I lied.

'Okay, we will need to make a quick report then we will get somebody out to secure the building, just a few quick questions, is that alright, Sir?'

'That's fine yes!'

'Superb!' He said, I could almost hear him smiling.

I walked into the kitchen to get away from the incessant slurping of tea.

The security manager kept talking.
'Okay so, *Where did the incident take place?... bell.. tower*, okay we've got that, so when did this happen? What date and roughly what time?'

I was going through my mind trying to figure out what was happening here, all I wanted was information about the building and suddenly I'm filing some report.

'Ehh, it was.. today... probably about noon!?' I just said the first thing that came to mind.

'Great, and there were three teenagers?

'Eh, yeah three!'

'Okay, and you said you didn't recognise any of them, Was there anything else to note, anything suspicious nearby?'

'N-no'

'You hesitated a little bit there, are you sure?'

'I'm sure!'

....

'What about your Dad's car?'

....

I froze.

I felt cold.

.

'S-Sorry?' I asked shakily.

'Come on Danny boy! Your Dad's car was there all smashed up, I know it was, because it was me who fucking smashed it up!'

His voice began to change.

'I can't believe you didn't recognise me, your old pal!! How could you not recognise me Danny boy? I'm so hurt!'

He let out and overly sarcastic cry.

'Sh-Shawn?' I gasped, my voice cracked and trembled.

He just laughed like a maniac until I eventually ended the call.

I staggered back into the living room, feeling dazed and confused, my eyes felt hot.

'What did they say?' Brian asked.

I just stood there staring.

'Are you okay, Son?' My Mum looked worried.

'I-I'm fine it's, it's just, they're not, it's not, it wasn't the security', I was struggling to find my words.

'What does that even mean?' Brian asked with a look of contempt.

'The security people, they've, they're not them, the guy put me onto a manager and then out of nowhere I was talking to... to Shawn!'

Brian stood up, 'Shit!', he put his hand on his forehead.

'We need to go to The Highland Council! The site is owned by them, maybe they know something.

'And what if it's just a bunch of 'Shawn's' there too?', Brian snapped back.

'Then... then I don't know, I know it has something to do with that door, the door needs to be sealed, we just need to find someone who can help!'.

'Easier said than done' Brian said, grabbing his jacket.

'Mum you'll have to just stay here, we'll go down to the Council Building and see if there's anyone we can speak to, I'll phone if anything happens'.

'Okay!' She said, a tear streamed down her cheek and she gave both of us a hug.

The air around the town seemed thick, like it was difficult to draw a full breath. 

We cycled to the Council building as fast as we could.

It's inside an industrial estate that seemed a little on the quiet side, there was something eerie about it.

I opened the door to what appeared to be the normal bustling council HQ.

I scanned the sign at the reception desk, 'Council house repairs, pest control, housing applications and rent enquiries, register births, deaths and marriages... Ah! Planning and Building Standards, that should be it, Desk 7!' 

I scanned the large open plan office building. 

A tall slender man with a round head and small round spectacles sat by a desk with a huge number 7 on the front.

'One of us should stay and keep an eye out' I suggested.

Brian looked at me, 'I'll go over' he said.

'You sure? I dont mind'

'I'll do it, I'll ask about getting the door sealed, and see if there's any information about what's going on, if anything like this has ever happened before or whatever'.

'Right okay, I'll just keep watch then, if anything dodgy happens I'll come and get you.

Brian shuffled over, looking like a nervous wreck and sat down.

The man's beady eyes seemed to be constantly darting around the room as he spoke.

Something about him just seemed shifty, I scanned the room because I could feel eyes on me from somewhere. 

I kept catching these haunting grins in my periphery but as I looked around it seemed that nobody was actually looking at me, I felt like I was going mad!

Brian swiftly came back over.

'Okay, so he told me the bell tower has a particularly dark and bloody history and was used by occultists for some kind of brutal rituals or ceremonies and stuff, years and years ago, apparently one of these rituals caused the building to collapse and only the bell tower remained, something intensely evil has been sealed inside for God knows how long, he said if the door isn't sealed, well... he doesn't actually know but he said it has been a priority of the council for decades to keep that door sealed, pretty much forever'.

Brian looked around the room, 'I have a bad feeling in here, he's getting one of the managers to get a hold of the people who sealed the door before, I dont know if it's some religious thing or what it is but hopefully...'

We were interrupted by a tall well dressed man in a side office calling Brian's name.

'That must be him!' Brian said, quickly turning away.

'Right in here, Sir!' The man gestured to the inside of the office with a friendly smile and a nod.

Brian disappeared inside.

I scanned the room again checking everyone out.

Something wasn't sitting right.

I looked back at the door Brian had just entered.

The guy was still standing there smiling, smiling and just staring at me.

Hairs all over my body stood on end.

His mouth grew wider and His eyes flashed a bright yellow as he turned and darted into the office slamming the door behind him.

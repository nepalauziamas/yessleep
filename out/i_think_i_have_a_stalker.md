ok so, this all started like... 3 or 4 weeks ago?

just to set the scene, i am a 24 year old female with a bit of a chunkier build lols. i weigh 157 pounds and most of it is distributed into my thighs and arms. chicken wings if you will. i live a little bit out from LA and can get there pretty easily if i need to.

alright ill actually get into it now. i noticed this man about a month ago and it was in the middle of a park. i was with my friend, Amanda.  i forgot to mention, my name is willow. so me and Amanda were sitting in the park, having food (just some light snacks watermelon, goldfish etc) and just talking about the usual, Amanda's EX, my old grandma, you know.. just stuff you talk about when we noticed a man sitting at the other end of the park. he was pretty far away but from what we could make out, he had dark under eyes, slight stubble, and a very large nose. he was also smoking a cigarette and was wearing a massively oversized hood. we didn't think much of it, i mean... this is a public park, there are plenty of other people and its a nice day, so we just got on with talking and after about what... 40 ish mins (?) we decided to call it a day, go home, watch a movie and eat some food.

when me and Amanda were driving back to my apartment, we had a car tail us for a while. not too long, but just long enough for us to notice. we did that around the block trick where you take 4 lefts in a row (or rights) and if the car is still behind you, they are following you. and sure enough the car left at the third corner. we got back safely, sat down on my couch and watched some horror things (that's our fav types of movies) she slept over that night and in the morning she left. now from then on there was nothing weird for 6 days.

on the sixth day, Amanda was coming over and you know that thing people do when they call you just before they arrive to make sure you have time to get the front door/bottom of apartment? well she did that but instead of the regular "i'm five minutes away!" that i'm used to, she started by saying

"hey willow... you remember that car that was tailing us the other day?"

"yeah? what about it???"

"there is one that looks the exact same literally right in front of your apartment complex..."

"oh that's weird"

"yeah, strange... anyways ill be in soon."

so yeah. that was odd but again, not something that you would call the police over. but i'm starting to get real heebijeebies. i have been noticing these little pieces of paper just outside of my apartment, and so i picked one up today and it read\~

"you know this isn't just all a weird coincidence"

there was no name saying who the writer was nor was there a "to \_\_\_\_\_". i don't know what to make of this. is the paper just from someone in my apartment block? or is it all connected with the guy from the park. anyways, ill keep you guys updated :)

edit- probably not important but he was wearing a black hood.

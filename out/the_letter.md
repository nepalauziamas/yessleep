I was a pretty reckless teen with friends that made me even more reckless. We did everything from parkour to prank steeling for YouTube videos.

Then one day, another member joined our group and brought the idea of ghost hunting for videos. It sounded pretty good back then so we gave it a shot.

We went from one abandoned house to the other and we were gaining views. That month i also got my first paycheck from YouTube. It was 5$ but still, i was happy with that. Bur my father wasn't.

He wanted me to succeed in life and not waste time on computers as video creator wasn't a real job. He lectured me a lot of times but one day, we got into a big fight. His last words before backing out were; "if you like it do much why don't you go to old Tom's house then ? Im sure you will find plenty of things to gain another 5$"

I was mad so that's what i did. I phoned my friends and we left in the middle of the night. 

Old Tom's house was a pretty popular house for my village. A guy named Tom once lived there while knowing it was hunted. It was centuries ago and suddenly he died. His body was torn up piece by piece beside the lake. When the police went to the house the found nothing inside. Literally.

It was like Tom never existed. The house was empty. No furniture, no photos of him, with dust everywhere just like it was abandoned before Tom took it. 

Fast forward to that night, we went in the house with the hope of finding a ghost or something paranormal to upload. We searched the whole house but we didn't find anything. The only spots left were the attic and the basement. I know, creepy huh ? 

Anyway, let's forget the fact that it almost turned into a horror movie. We were 6 people there. 2 went to the attic 2 (including me) went to the basement and 2 stayed where they were to look out for possibly more clues.

We went to the basement and looked everywhere. It was a mess but in a.... "Horror" way. After some time we decided to go back but i stepped on a rat that scared the hell out of me and fell back. As i fell i ripped a dirty old poster behind me and found a hole.

As a daredevil my self, i went quickly in fist and found a letter and a all-the-way burnt candle. The letter had something written and even though most of that was aged and unreadable, i managed to make something out of the words left. (I will put what it said at the end).

We went back up to meet with the others but, we couldn't find anyone. We went to the 2nd floor and they weren't there either. We went to the attic and found 2 of the 4 fooling around and after i learned they didn't find anything, we looked for the others.

Turns out they were out in the bikes waiting. 
I once again asked what happened and they were confused. "I thought you went in the woods with Jerry to take a piss"(Jerry was the other guy i was with in the basement). They explained everything and i did the same thing.

They heard a load noise (me falling) and after a minute "we" apparently came out with s serious look and told them to go out. "We" were acting weird and one thing they noticed is that our faces couldn't be seen that well and when "we" walked, our steps and hands were synchronized. 

After that i apparently said with a corrupted-like voice that i was going to pee in the woods and jerry followed me. We all laughed except for them and i showed them the letter i told them i found. I spent 2 days or so and here is what it said (wherever i put ?? Means i couldn't read it);

When i was done writing i was shocked. I showed it to my father and he thought it was a joke. I sweared it wasn't a joke and showed him the true letter afterwards. 

Later that day we went to the police but, because the case was closed years ago they didn't believe i found the letter.
 
I dont have the original letter anymore as our house burned down years ago but, i still have the copy i made and found it yesterday in a box. That's why im writing all this now.

Beware...

My grandfather murdered people and liked to bury their dismembered corpses in their own gardens. It would be unfair to call him a serial killer though, because his murders were so prolific and had no real modus operandi. If he couldn’t bury them in the garden, he would simply bury them somewhere in the woods. He wasn’t…organised or attached the way most serial killers are. 

Still. He was never arrested. Never caught for his crimes. 

I was a quiet kid with workaholic parents. My folks were never there and I was left with relatives a lot growing up which is why I ended up spending a lot of time with my grandfather, my mother’s father. Which also meant the spent a lot of time watching him kill people.

When I was seven years old, my grandfather took me hunting. It wasn’t the kind of hunting where you brought home a deer or a rabbit. Instead, he was going to show me exactly how to deliver a blow to another humans head and then dismember them while they were unconscious but still alive. 

My first kill was supposed to be a boy around my age who had wandered too close to the edge of the woods. He was kicking a ball into a tree. My grandfather nudged me and pointed in the boy’s direction. 

Obediently, I did as my grandfather said. I walked over to the other boy and smiled widely. Keeping my face warm and open, just as my grandfather taught me. Innocent. “Hi.” I said to the boy. I clutched the baseball bat in my hand. He was wearing a red baseball cap and a pair of blue shorts and he smiled at me. A big grin with two front teeth missing. 

I think that was what stopped me. 

That was what made me release my grip on the baseball bat and I slowly set it down. It was strange but I felt my grandfather’s glare at that moment, his eyes boring into my back. Panic rose in my throat thinking he was going to strike me. 

Instead he did something infinitely worse. He killed the boy instead.

I remember numbly sitting in his truck on the drive home. He alternated between shouting at me and calling me a coward while extrapolating joy at his own kill. My fear was palpable. My grandfather was in a state of euphoria and fury. 

That was the last time I saw my grandfather alive.

He was killed in a hit and run a week later. 

I never told a soul about the butchery I had seen in my childhood. A part of me convinced myself that I had it wrong, that I had invented that version of my grandfather because I had misunderstood things. He couldn’t have been a killer, I rationalised, he would have been caught.

I wish that was that my rationality had been right and that would be the end of that. I wish that I didn’t have to tell you about the rest of this. But my grandfather died 23 years ago and four days ago, on my 30th birthday, I  received a “gift.”

It was delivered in an inconspicuous parcel, my name and address in marker pen. It had no return address and had I known who it was from or what it was, I would have thrown it out. Instead, I took it to my kitchen table along with the rest of my mail and opened it up. 

There was no note inside the package. 

Just a sealed box. Carefully I lifted it up and opened it up with my penknife. 

The leather bound, bloodstained notebook stared back at me and a sick feeling clawed its way into my stomach. 

Curiosity, however, won out.

I lifted the notebook and grimacing at the crackle of the pages, opened it to the first page which just said a name. 

William Ronald Harrow.

That was my grandfather’s name. My heart began to thud against my chest and my hands shook as I turned the page. 

Written in what I had a horrible suspicion was  dried blood was a name and a date. Gregory Sanders - 12th June 1981. What followed after the name was the most graphically detailed description of murder I had ever read. The thrill the killer took in severing this man’s hands first. The joy he felt in pulling out his vocal cords. How long he kept his victim alive. The torture, my God, the torture.

I turned the page. Another name, another incredibly graphic death.

While reading it, a wave of nausea overcame me and as I turned page after page, the strong smell of iron made me drop the book back in its box so I could run to the bathroom and throw up. 

When I came back, I stood stock still at the kitchen door.

The diary had moved. 

It was no longer in the box. Instead it sat open at the kitchen counter, lying open on the last page.

Look, I live alone. The front door was locked. No one else had a key after my ex girlfriend moved out and I changed the locks. 

A cold sweat broke out all over my body. I felt like I was seven again.

Slowly I made my way to the kitchen counter. I placed my clammy hand on the book and pulled it closer.

The last page listed a name that made me blink several times.

“William Ronald Harrow - 1st June 1999.” 

That was my grandfather’s name and his date of death. I swallowed hard. What the hell was going on. Slowly I read on. The contents of the page were sickening. In brief, his tongue was cut out. His eyes taken. He was tortured for three days.

I pushed the book away and sat down heavily on a kitchen chair, my head spinning. But…but he died in a car accident didn’t he? That’s why there was a closed casket-

The realisation suddenly swelled in my mind and I began to realise why there was a closed casket. 

It was because he had been tortured. 

Quickly, I grabbed the diary and my keys and drove to my parents’ place. I knew they would be sitting down to dinner around now but I didn’t care. I let myself into the house and found them in their living room.

“Sam?! Sam what’s wrong?” My mother asked me, getting to quickly and letting her book fall to the floor.

“How…how did granddad die?” I didn’t mince my words, I didn’t have the brainpower to do that anymore. “And don’t tell me it was a hit and run.” I added forcefully.

“What-“ my father was standing up too now, his hand on my shoulder. I was breathing hard and my body was a mix of fear and fury.

“Don’t.” I told my father sharply. “I just want the truth.” I turned to my mother. “How did he die?”

My mother’s eyes went from confusion to sadness. “Oh Sam. You really don’t remember do you?”

“Remember what?!” I asked in frustration.

“What he did to Adrian.” Her words were slow, halting and still they managed to make their mark.

“Who is Adrian?” As soon as I asked the question I realised I didn’t want to know the answer but it was too late.

The room was still as my mother began to cry.

“Adrian was your younger brother. He loved you so much and followed you everywhere. And your grandfather…your grandfather killed him.”

I couldn’t process this. I didn’t have any siblings. I was an only child!

“Mom, I don’t remember-“

“No, you don’t. And that’s a good thing.” My mother said quietly. “The doctors said it’s best if you don’t remember that day. It’s why we have no photos of Adrian around the house. It’s why we moved to another town where no one knew us or your grandfather. It was so much easier for you to forget.”

“What happened to him?” My voice sounded high and unnatural even to myself.

“Your grandfather was a sick man.” My mother said, her gentle grey eyes hardening with a hate that made me step back from her. “And he got what was coming to him.”

I looked between her and my father, the cold truth dawning on me.

“You’re saying that you…that you-“

“We did what we had to do. What any parent would do.” said my father, the iciness in his voice chilling me to the core.

“You didn’t have to torture him.” I said numbly, unable to believe that my parents were saying these words.

“We didn’t have to.” My mothers eyes glinted with something dangerous. “But we wanted to.”

I stumbled back from my parents. “Who sent me the diary?” 

“What diary?” My mother asked.

“This diary!” I said as I slammed it onto the coffee table.

My mother picked up the diary and flipped through the pages. “I don’t understand. Why are you showing this to us?”

“What?!” I was incredulous but then I noticed the pages…they were blank. In fact, the whole book seemed to have been wiped clean somehow.

My head ached. “How old was he?” I asked softly. “How old was Adrian?”

My father was taking a folded photograph out of his wallet, his eyes etched in such pain as he looked at me and handed it over. “That’s the last photo of you two together.”

It was an old photograph. Of me and the boy I assumed was my brother. He was smiling a big smile with his two front teeth missing. And wearing a red baseball hat with blue shorts.

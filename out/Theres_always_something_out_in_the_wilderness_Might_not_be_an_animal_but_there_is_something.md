When I was 12 I went camping with my family. so I lived in a small rural town in queensland (population 1,000-900) where pig hunting was very common and each weekend the blokes of the town would go out hunting with their dogs and come back on the Sunday with a couple 60kilo pigs. Anyways this one weekend all the dads decided to take all the kids out with them. My bestfriend and 2 cousins ended up coming aswell as other random kids. We shared a tent because we were all little girls. The second night of the trip the girls and I decided that we should sneak out. Feeling a little bit rebellious and adventurous that night after all our dads had gone out hunting by themselves this night. Mind you we are is the dead bush of Australia. 

It was about 3am when we decided to explore. I took my iPad with me to record our adventure, at the time youtube was really popular so I thought I was a youtuber. As we started walking we knew there was a lake called blues rock up ahead. We had all been camping in this area before so we weren’t into the bush blindly.

about 7 minutes into our exploration, We came across a clearing where we thought the lake was supposed to be. We could hear the lakes waterfall but we thought it must of been up ahead or around a bend or something. As we entered the clearing we saw little bones all around (wasn’t too rare to find) but this was way too much than regular. The ground almost looked almost white. After looking around the ground for a bit I looked up at the one tree about 30 metres away from us and saw something medium sized in its branches. It was an oddly familiar red gum tree. I thought it was a koala because I live in Australia and It wasn’t uncommon to come across them. as we all started to approach it, something felt wrong. We were about 15-10 metres away from it when we realized that it wasn’t a cuddly little puppy like bear, it was a dead baby pig hanging in the tree by its neck, gutted and hung with its own organs. After what felt like 10 minutes of staring at this poor dead thing one of us screamed an ran. that seemed to set us all of running and screaming. I ended up dropping my iPad somewhere, but I didn’t care less.

All I remember is running away, then waking up damp from my feet to my chest. When we awoke we all conversed about what happened and we all came to the conclusion that we don’t know how we got back to the tents. We had a laugh and said we all had some sort of conjoined dream like hallucination. so we decided to go back to retrieve my iPad, but we brought my older brother and older cousin aswell incase. 

When we went back, there was no clearing. But the lake was there. With its signature big tree against the back rock wall of the lake where people would jump off. It took me 5 years to realise that the reason I was damp is because I was a foot from being fully submerged under water.

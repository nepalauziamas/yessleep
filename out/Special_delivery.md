"You are so picky Lucy, I know you're hungry," I said as I opened the back door and let my pet  Lucy outside. My stomach growled with hunger. Just then I heard the doorbell ring. "Ding dong", a low echo swept through my house."Perfect". I thought to myself. "The pizza is here".As I opened the door, standing there was a very strange-looking man. He gave off this weird eerie vibe, I felt something was off. "Pizzas here". He said as he chuckled.

His glance went from me to the inside of my house."Alone, huh?' He said as he stood there with this peculiar smile plastered on his face."Yes, I am alone ". I said as I smiled back. His smile grew as he stated. "Surely a small girl like you couldn't eat all this yourself. "Are you sure you are here by yourself?" He said as he stood still, licking his lips with that same peculiar grin.

"I know that grin." I thought in my head. I paid him the 17.60 for the pizza and went inside. 

I went to the kitchen to wash my hands as they had been covered in red pizza sauce that had somehow fallen on my hand. “Tempting..” I thought. Just as I sat down to feast I heard a strange noise. "LUCY" a thought popped up in my head. "Oh no... I left lucy outside". As I ran to the back door I came to an abrupt stop. There stood the same man from earlier, with the same familiar grin. He stepped in as he held something behind his back. "Was it a weapon?" 

"Was he going to kill me?" I wondered. "What are you doing in here, GET OUT OF MY HOUSE," I screamed. He laughed, a very strange laugh. "Where have I heard that laugh from?" I thought to myself. After laughing, he then showed me what was behind his back, a sharpened butcher's knife. “Perfect for cutting smooth and swiftly”. I thought.  He stepped in and closed the door. "Ready to eat?" He laughed. "Bring me a plate," he demanded as he sat on the couch. I did what he told me, then watched him devour 4 slices of pizza. He laughed as he watched me standing there horrified. He said "come here, and sit down." I slowly walked over there and sat in an awkward amount of space between me and him. He then proceeded to rub his still greasy hands through my hair. He reached into the pizza box and grabbed another piece. He asked me to open my mouth as he tried to feed me, He then placed the knife down on the table. I thought to myself "There's my only chance, grab it." I grabbed the knife and jumped up. He tried to escape through the door.  “Leaving so early,” I said as I plunged the knife into his shoulder. “AHHHHH” he let out a blood-bursting scream.  “What's wrong, I would let you go but, I can't eat this big ole pizza by myself, right?” I laughed as I sliced a piece of his arm fat off. Then I repeatedly stabbed him until he no longer made any sounds.  “LUCY, where are you” I called. 

My pet Lucy came trotting through the door, as I threw the slice of arm fat in the hallway, I began to devour the man. “It's been long enough, I've tried to maintain my composure but I need meat..” I groaned.  It's been 3 months 5 days and 2.5 hours exactly. Don't blame me though as he would've been spared if he would've not forcefully made his way into my house, maybe its fate, maybe its a sign, or maybe I left the backdoor open just enough that he could slip in… Anyways I miss my dog my real dog, not the old deformed figureless rotting homeless man who crawls on four legs and acts like my dead dog lucy whom he ate. He started my craving, now I desire human flesh. I now remember that smile, it's the same smile that that old homeless man had while he ate my dog. Have a great night and don't let me or lucy bite.

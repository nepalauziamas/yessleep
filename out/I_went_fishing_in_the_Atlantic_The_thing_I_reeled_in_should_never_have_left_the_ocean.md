The cold, grey sea stretched out in front of me. The smell of salt and brine filled the air. A thick fog shrouded the boat. I was out on the open sea for the first time. Behind me, Joe was working the engine, and Phil was sitting next to me on the small bench near the bow. Neither me or Phil had fished before, and I had barely even seen the ocean. Joe was an experienced fisherman, though. All of us had been friends in college, but as the years passed we had drifted apart. I was surprised when Joe invited the two of us to his cottage in Maine for a reunion, as we hadn’t spoken for nearly a year,  but it sounded good.

Joe had met the two of us at the small airport. We got in his car and started to drive down the bumpy dirt roads to his cottage. We caught up on the way. “Any of you been fishing before?” He asked us. We both said no. “I’ll take you. I know some great spots. We can go today, and cook our catch for dinner. I tell you, there isn’t anything like fresh-caught fish.” “Sounds good.” I responded. We arrived at the cottage soon after. 

It was a small, wooden house with faded red paint in a clearing close to the ocean. He parked his car in the dirt driveway. We got out and walked in. Joe flicked on the light. “Haven’t been here in a while.” He commented. “I’ll buy groceries after we catch some fish, and then I’ll make dinner.” I walked around the house. It was pretty basic, with an ancient kitchen, a few bedrooms, and an old bathroom. I unpacked my stuff. After a while, we were all ready. 

Joe led us down to a tiny marina, where a small motorboat was waiting for us, along with three fishing rods. We settled down into the boat, and Joe took us out. It was a foggy day, and soon we couldn’t see the coastline. After a while, Joe stopped and threw down the anchor. “This is a good spot.” Joe told us how to drop our lines in, and we did. I felt the reel get smaller and smaller. Eventually, it hit the bottom, and the line went slack. 

Joe was surprised. “It’s a lot deeper here than I thought.” We sat there in the foggy afternoon for a while. Nobody was getting a bite. “Do you think we should go somewhere else?” Phil asked. “Probably.” Joe admitted. “Let’s wait a little longer, though.” A few minutes later, and we still hadn’t caught anything. We were about ready to give up when I felt it. A tug. I jumped in surprise. “I got something!” I called out. I began to reel in furiously. “Don’t let it go!” Warned Phil.   
“That’s the first catch we got all day!” 

“Keep your rod steady. Don’t let go.” Joe advised. I reeled it in more and more. I could feel the fish fight against it furiously. It thrashed from side to side, rocking the boat greatly. Joe started to look excited. “It’s a big one. I’ve never caught anything that big before.” I wasn’t sure I was going to be able to catch it at all. It was so violent and ferocious, I could barely hold onto my rod. Suddenly, the fighting stopped. The line still had something on the end of it, but it was now stationary. “It stopped fighting.” I said dubiously. “But I can still feel something on the end.” I slowly began to reel it in.

It was tough. Even if it wasn’t fighting, it was still heavy as hell. Maybe dropping it so low was a mistake - it had been several minutes and I still hadn’t gotten it yet. “Maybe we shouldn't have gone so deep.” Phil commented. Joe didn’t say anything. Then, I could see it. I couldn’t see it well - it was obstructed by a lot of water. But I could see its vague colour and shape. Finally, I finished reeling and it drew out of the waves.

It wasn’t a fish. It was a man. His body was barnacled, and sea-worms had pokes orifices through his face. His clothes were ragged and torn, and they looked like they had come from a ship hundreds of years ago. My hook had pierced his head. We all stared in shock. I think Joe was about to say something when the silence was burst by the sound of frantic breathing. 

“You have to leave!” He croaked. His voice sounded waterlogged - like its vocal chambers were still half-filled with seawater. “Before it gets you!” “Before *what*?” I asked frantically. He was about to answer, when he was pulled back into the water with a force so great that the fishing rod was ripped straight out of my hands. I almost fell in too, but Phil quickly managed to grab me before I went overboard. “What was he talking about?” I asked Joe desperately. But Joe was gone.

“Joe?” I called out nervously. “Where did he go?” asked Phil. “I’m not sure. Do you think he fell overboard?” I answered. Phil was about to respond, but we were interrupted by a swirling white vortex in the water. Our boat was near enough that we might get sucked in. “We have to go!” I yelled, struggling to be heard over the sound of swirling water. Phil had been on a boat a couple times, and knew the basics, so he was the one who leaped towards the engine, started it up, and pushed it as fast as it would go. I looked behind us, and saw what was causing the vortex - several colossal tentacles broke the seawater, and a staggeringly large diamond-shaped head lifted up into the foggy sky.

Joe was dead. I don’t mean that he fell overboard - he had been dead for nearly a year. Nobody had lived in the cottage Joe said was his for nearly thirty years. The police didn’t believe our story, of course. I’ve talked to a couple of the locals. Most of them dismiss it outright, but there are a few of them - mostly older fishermen - who know about it. Sometimes they’ve heard about it happening to a friend - sometimes they were the ones who received the lure, a false message from an old friend, and only narrowly escaped like we did. One thing I didn’t know, though - who it was that was masquerading as Joe. That was until I saw his cause of death - lost at sea, at that exact same spot.

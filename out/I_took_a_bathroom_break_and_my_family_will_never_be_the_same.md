My sister had been begging, crying. We needed more time. I didn’t know if we were going to make it, but I was trying so hard. I had hoped she knew I was doing my best.

I understood how she felt, I didn’t have to go at the gas station either and we both knew there’d be a rest stop ahead. But, when we got there, it was a terrifying scene. We couldn’t even bring ourselves to go in. We didn’t even think about how we were 60 miles to the nearest town at that time.

So, there we were, speeding down the tiny highway, me trying to pass slower moving traffic as safely as possible, a frozen, unflattering grimace on my face. Sweat began to form on my forehead despite the cool temperature as I mentally bargained with deities I didn’t even believe in. Please, please let us make it, I released into the universe, I’ll be a better person, I promise.

Why did I drink all that damn iced green tea?

But, finally! We were entering back into a small town.

I saw a billboard that advertised a diner at the next exit. 

Geena was out and running before the car was even in park. I tried to get myself together, running was no longer an option for me. I stood up slowly, carefully, delicately, shuffled towards the entrance. It definitely looked the part of an old school diner, with the shiny mirror-like exterior – it looked old enough to actually be an authentic 50s dinner from back in the day.

When I opened the door, something about the place struck me as odd. The air was hot, stifling even – thick with humidity. It was far too hot considering the crisp early afternoon air – you'd think someone would’ve opened a window, or the door. Otherwise, the interior was what you’d expect from a small-town diner, booths in cute magenta and teal coloring, the kinds where the vinyl fabric has a silvery glitter, an empty milkshake bar, with matching stools. A waitress even had a poodle skirt on, but otherwise the place looked pristine, like it had just opened yesterday. Maybe it was just a well-done recreation after all.

There were also way too many people in there, some with heavy sweaters – how were they not literally melting? As Geena and I had entered the town, the sign had said ‘Welcome to \_\_\_\_\_, Population 250’ (I’m hesitant to share the town name here). Population 250? What was like half the entire town in here on a Wednesday at 12 PM? 

No one acknowledged me when I came in.

I always feel guilty going in somewhere just to use the restroom. I’d buy Geena and I a milkshake after I peed, I decided. Actually no, no more beverages. But, we’d buy something.

Geena wasn’t in the women’s room, when I went in. Weird, because she hadn’t been in the restaurant, either. Maybe there was a back door, and she got overheated and went to the car.

After I finally was free from my liquid burden, I opened the door. I felt something different in the atmosphere of the place. What was it? I looked to the nearest booth, where the unblinking stare of a stranger made me do a double take.

There it was, the subtle difference – every single patron was now staring at me, frozen otherwise. Their bodies hadn’t moved at all, but everyone now looked at me, without blinking, some had their necks almost contorted so they could stare at me.

Actually not everyone was staring, one thin teenage girl in a plaid jacket was sitting at the milkshake bar staring forward. It was Geena... I didn’t see her there before when I ran to the bathroom, had she been here the whole time?

I walked up to her, looked over my shoulder and noticed that everyone had silently shifted in the time I had taken my eyes off them, they were staring at me again, in my new location.

“Geena”, I leaned towards her ear, whispered, “We need to go now”

I saw her shiver, despite the heat in here. She had a small sundae in front of her, with one tiny spoonful missing.

“Geena, please. We’ll get something to eat in the next town”

She moved slightly, a micromovement. She shook her head  

I turned to look over my shoulder, smiles had formed on all the patrons faces – not happy, ‘welcome to our town’, smiles, but excited ... hungry almost?

I leaned down, again, whispered, “Let’s go. Something isn’t right here”

She pulled me closer to her with the hand I was leaning over, as if to hide the movement from the other patrons and staff.

“They only needed one” She whispered to me, still staring ahead, “Please go, I love you”

I stood up, noticed tears streaming down her otherwise emotionless face

I choked back a sob for a reason I couldn’t explain, but told myself, it was okay, she had just turned 17, she was old enough to sit at a diner by herself until I went for help. 

I backed away, never letting her leave my sight, though she continued to stare straight ahead.

I turned, opened the door

Gave one last look to Geena so I could tell myself she’d be okay until I got back

She stared at me, a wide smile that didn’t reach her eyes, which were still wet

It was dark outside, where the 60-degree breeze felt like I had stepped into a freezer after the hot, humid interior. I couldn’t have been inside more than 30 minutes, tops.

I cried in the car after I called the police. I told them that my sister was acting weirdly, she wouldn’t leave but she seemed scared, I was worried she was being held against her will.

They came, just one guy, probably due to the oddness of my story and my age, but the thing is, when he opened the door, the place was the same... but different. It had sound, Air Conditioning, people were moving, talking, laughing. It was grungier. It was a whole different group of people, and much smaller. It was exactly what you’d expect from a small-town diner.  Geena wasn’t there.

I had sat in the parking lot, watching the \*only\* door until the police came. She didn’t leave.

I had tried calling her, but her phone had been disconnected.

Every year on that day, I make the drive. I’m heading out there tomorrow, it’s the fourth anniversary.

Every time, I open the door, waiting for the stifling air, to see Geena at the bar. 

Hoping they’ll need one more.

Okay, listen.

I'm not well.

My leg is not well.

But… It's not infected. I'm not a doctor though, so I can't be entirely sure. There doesn't appear to be any discoloration and it doesn't… smell. I know those are usually common signs of gangrene or whatever sort of debilitating illness one could acquire from such an injury.

Aside from that; it's been a hellish few days. Unrelenting disturbances, horrid manifestations and that man. His height has allowed him to tower over most of the shelves and his ability to lean has granted him access to my blocked off section.

I've peered between one of the cracks I have in my book walls only to see his lanky body bent over a nearby shelf with his head diligently scanning the area. The first time it happened, I almost gave myself away by gasping. What I fool I'd have to be to do something like that. 

But, it means I won't be safe for long.

The only bright side is that he appears to be of a primal intelligence. Despite my obvious shelter, he doesn't seem to notice or even remotely connect the dots that I'm hiding within. That's good for me, but it only takes one mistake on my end to lose it completely.

On another note, the man isn't the only thing I've been having to avoid.

Mrs. James… she's been acting… different. 

I've seen her walking now and it's not any less of a nightmare. She wanders without purpose, or so it seems. Regardless, I've caught her standing right outside my walls several times. She never does anything while she's there other than stand, but I wonder what it is she wants.

Anyway, I've basically been out of commission since my leg was injured. It's been hard and aggravating at the same time. I can at least walk now, but not very fast and I mostly certainly cannot run. That means my vigilance has increased tenfold, I won't have another incident like before. Besides… if one were to happen, I don't know if I'd survive it this time around.

Mrs. James is here again.

I'll update you soon, hopefully.

I'm going to start signifying my new entries with a simple, 'New Entry' followed by a number. The number will only be for organization purposes and it will not represent anything significant. Besides, I have no idea what day, year or even time it is. I can't trust anything around me to be correct anyway.

New Entry: 1? 

How many days has it been? Do things even work here the same as the real world? I'm not able to write down my experience in any uniform way and I usually write after something terrible has happened, which is often. So, I apologize if things seem… all over the place. 

Speaking of all over the place.

The man, you know the one - tall, angry and seemingly hell bent to kill me? Yeah, he's been running FURIOUSLY in a circle for what I'd have to say is hours on end. His facial expression never changes from one of contempt; it's a grimace of sorts but filled with something more… evil.

I threw something to see if he would stop moving, but nothing happened. He just kept going in a circle. He's been doing it so long that a rut has appeared in the carpet, now that's dedication. I caught Mrs. James STANDING in the middle of the circle he is creating and that only raises more questions.

On the topic of questions, I have many and none have answers. My leg has healed remarkably quick; it's almost like I was never injured. Due to that fact, I've made some discreet expeditions to gather more supplies and I've even gone as far as to bolster my shelter further. I now have the castle of book forts and am growing rather fond of it.

I've discovered something of actual interest though - in one of my more recent perambulations. There lies, deep within the library, a map. Not just ANY map, no. This is a map of the library and it appears to change as the library does. Unfortunately, I wasn't able to study it for long as it seems that whenever I leave my shelter, the man ends his circle making in favor of hunting me down.

And believe me when I say, he always finds me.

When I recently went out to find the map again; it wasn't there. I should say, the library has changed which has been an unfortunate and constant struggle for me. But, while I was out, I made a new discovery that was not any less confusing.

A book. An absolutely MASSIVE book, I mean, it was at least twenty-five feet tall. I don't know what the significance is, but the book pertained to musical theory, well, that's what the title on the cover said. There's no way in hell, not even this hell, that I'll be able to move it ESPECIALLY with this bum leg. But I do think something is behind it.

The biggest problem is that I take a step forward and probably more than five steps back every time I learn something new. The way the library changes really hinders my progress in figuring things out. The only thing that I'm fortunate enough to have here is my shelter which NEVER seems to disappear. But it's always a life or death situation whenever I leave.

Anyway, another thing that happened when I was last out (and this is after finding the huge book) is me having to outrun the man. Let me tell you, HE IS FAST. I had to resort to using the shelves and various other surroundings in order to escape him and half the time he just knocked the shelves over.

I did notice something odd though, while I was running away. There was another man lurking in the shadows of a poorly lit corner. Well, I thought there was a man and because of the things I've already experienced up until now, I have no reason not believe it was.

Like the map I had found, I wasn't able to get enough of a look due to the tall nuisance CONSTANTLY present. Obviously, as I'm writing this down, I made it back to my shelter but that wasn't the last time I ventured out.

In fact, the last time was a bit of a miscalculation.

I hadn't even planned on leaving that… day? I was actually busy reading a book on world history (which is what I did when I wasn't gone or sleeping) when I heard a most peculiar sound.

Chanting, followed by a low-ringing bell.

Even though the chanting seemed far away, I was still able to hear the individual words. But, they weren't recognizable as any language I've ever heard before. Based on what I believe I heard - the chant sounded like this, "Se'ok murok celimik bodarum…" Then the bell would ring four times. The chant would then repeat unchanging.

Now, I'm not sure if that's EXACTLY what I heard (in terms of the spelling) but that's what it sounded like. I still have no clue to the origin of the chant but I did sneak out of my shelter to search for it.

Like always, the tall man veered away from his circle and began a mission to snuff me out. But, I had grown used to being chased by him. Or so I thought.

The chanting continued and I seemed to be getting closer to it. I could now pick out several different voices combined in the chant but still didn't see a sign of the source. I had found myself in an unknown section of the library, one I had never seen before; it was palatial. The ceiling stretched high into a dome like shape and several large and red pillars reached from the floor to the base of the dome. Each pillar was adorned with jewels and had images of foreign beings carved into them.

Black curtains draped from halfway down the pillars to meet the floor and it seemed like the chanting stemmed from the other side. I looked around to see if the man was nearby, (I could usually tell because his footsteps were loud and abrasive) but couldn't see or hear him.

So, I poked my head through the curtain and instantly the chanting stopped. There was nothing on the other side save for a large, rusty bell that sat atop a stone plinth. However, I never got the chance to investigate because heavy footsteps invaded my mind and I realized a little too late that the volume of the chanting masked the tall man's resounding footsteps.

Before I could turn around, my arm was grabbed and yanked with tremendous force. I thought my shoulder had been dislocated but I wasn't able to check because I was suddenly thrown backwards onto the hard carpet. The man was standing over me with a solemn expression as if he regretted his actions despite his continuation of carrying them out.

I scooted back on my elbows and he stepped towards me with such strength that I thought he might crush me with one stomp. He displayed no anger or remorse while trying to to end my life. I was close enough now to get a really good look at him, but there really wasn't much to see.

As I've previously said, he appears older with a neutral expression, however, his mouth does seem on the verge of frowning if that makes sense. He has many wrinkles that are set deep in his skin. His eyes are a pale-yellow and he has no hair.

His clothing is odd as well and being so close to him (even if my demise was at hand) allowed me to study what he wore. Aside from his dirty hiking boots, he wore a tattered black trench coat with a gray shirt underneath. He had a thick leather belt and leather pants as if he were some kind of motorcycle enthusiast with a knack for chivalry (in terms of characterization, that's all I have to accurately describe his odd get up.)

I was almost entranced by his appearance, like his form had some sort of hypnotic property to it.

But, as I studied him, something most unexpected happened.

Just as the man was about to advance on me for what would probably have been the last time - he became distracted. He turned his head toward the darkness to our left and for the first time since being subject to his torment, his eyes narrowed.

Then, he SPRINTED into the shadows after something I could not see. I didn't wait around for him to come back and clambered to my feet. Although my arm was aching and quite sore, I returned to my shelter without further issue.

The man never returned, or at least, he hasn't yet. However, Mrs. James has returned to her strange antics of appearing and standing in random places seemingly without reason. My arm has a massive bruise on it and is almost numb to the touch. There has definitely been some damage and no amount of medical study is going to allow me to fix it. So, it's something I've been learning to deal with.

I have a decision to make. Find a way to move the towering book (if I manage to find it again.) Find the map table (which seems easier said than done) or, find the bell. I'm not sure of the significance of the book or the bell, but the map is definitely a necessity so that's probably where I'll start. I can't say for sure right now.

All I know is that Mrs. James has appeared and is standing outside my book door, but my arm hurts too much for me to care. 

I'll update you soon. I hope.

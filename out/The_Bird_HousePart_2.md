 

I apologise for my incoherence. I really don't want to relive any of this.

I, alongside Keith immediately went to tackle the man, only for him to jump up 9 fucking feet, and land across the room. Two more of us tried to do the same, but the he kicked both of them across the room.

*What the shit’s going on here?*

They finally began to shoot at him. Of course, this was fatal, but screw morality. This wasn’t a legal question anymore. I consider myself to be slightly superstitious, but even those who didn’t believe in the supernatural thought they were shooting at a demon.

Either way, not a single bullet touched him. The second one of the guns went off, he… Lunged, I think, at the guy (in a few milliseconds, mind you.) And knocked him through the damn door. I ran out of the room to see what happened to him. As I walked over to him, the shooting stopped. The man and the birds were gone.

Of course, we searched the house for hours and even managed to get a search warrant so we could expand our search, but nothing. No one found a thing.

There wasn’t much we could do that day.

We blocked off the street, set up security cameras, guards and monitored the entire street 24/7. Everyone on the street, including us were questioned, and very few people believed the part about the birds, but the CCTV removed all doubt.

We received specific orders to capture the birds immediately for research or some shit, and dispatched a search party to look for Ethans father. Now we had to worry about that on top of a potential serial killer.

None of this yielded results for days, until we finally got some footage of the cloaked guy. The footage showed him sitting in the kitchen gorging himself on what seemed to be a bleeding steak. They immediately dispatched all of us and alerted the swat team members who had been surveilling the perimeter, but of course, he was long gone by the time we got there.

Another day of mindless surveillance. Wonderful.

And then the first murder happened.

They recorded the entire thing. A swat team member heard someone yelling from inside the building. He alerted his coworkers, ran inside to see one of the birds standing in the living room. He once again called for backup, but was impaled by the bird. The third causualty.

I, a few of my coworkers and the swat team vacated the area immediately, and the second we vacated everyone, Ethans dad showed up on the road.

The accuracy was unnatural. He just appeared, and stood there, in the middle of the road, his shattered phone in his hand, yelling into it. A large fragment of his jaw was gone and he was covered in dried blood. I sprinted up to him, only to be restrained as he collapsed in front of us.

They performed CPR on him and called the ambulance, but from the information I’ve gathered, he died hours later.

I think it’s safe to say most of us where sick of this shitshow by then. all of the witnesses where either relocated or dead, the murderer could just disappear on command and the conspiracy theories were arising. It was a confusing hassle that no one wanted to deal with.

Now then, here’s why I quit my job:

Five weeks into this, we got over 70 simultaneous calls at 6:23 PM. They didn’t tell us the details, they didn’t specify anything except for the location where we were required to go. They just dispatched us. Hundreds of us, mind you, to the exact same location with a gargantuan supply of weaponry.

We arrived at the house, armed to the fucking teeth with no idea what we were there to do.

But then we saw them.

The cloaked man stood in the buildings driveway, accompanied by the two birds, who, in contrast to their previous demeanor, where twitching and occasionally screaming.

All our radios turned on simultaneously.

*„Kill them. You have been given temporary clearance to disregard all laws for the duration of this attack. Casualties are not a concern for now, and you will face no legal consequences. Do anything required to end both the man and the birds lives as quickly as possible.”*

We fired everything immediately. Every weapon. All aimed at the driveway. They sent at least 30 of us into the building to carry out a second attack, while the rest of us fought.

We ran at the man, only for him to sprint through us, killing everyone he came in contact with. His birds followed, decapitating what seemed like 40 people. The man succeeded in leaving the building and stared at us from the street, screaming incoherently, as we continued firing.

Some bullets hit him, leaving minor gashes along his arm, but that was the most damage we could inflict.

After a few minutes the man stopped, looked up, spread out his arms and began sobbing. Or at least I think that’s what he was doing. He stood there for a few seconds as we continued shooting.

Our radios once again conveyed a message simultaneously.

*„Leave the premises immediately. Leave the corpses behind. Everyone has been informed of this”*

That was it, so we ran, and he did nothing. Absolutely nothing. We left safely and never heard about this again.

Except for me. I saw something that I was *not* supposed to see. It’s why I quit my job. It’s why I haven’t left my house in weeks. It’s why I fear everything.

I went unconscious in the middle of the evacuation. They assumed I was dead, so they left me there, but no. I was alive. He wanted me to see something.

I woke up weeks later, in the dark, facing the house. I still couldn’t move or hear, but at least I could see what was happening. I immediately registered a small black shape in the distance, growing rapidly. I assumed it was a plane, but why was it growing? The shape approached the street, still growing, except now, I could make out its shape. It was a bird. The size of a fucking house.

Oh god.

It was only a few kilometers away. Growing.

And then it crashed into the street. At the direct spot I was laying in. I assumed the impact would kill me, but no, I woke up inside on the kitchen table. Alone.

It took me hours to get back. They all assumed I was dead by then. I was completely mute, and my vocal cords still haven’t recovered.

I quit a day later.

And now I’m here. Unloading all of this off my conscience, because this is the only place anyone might believe me.

Have you ever heard of the cursed straw doll?
Here is a story about it.
I was often transferred for work and moved from place to place.

Sometimes it was an apartment, sometimes a rental house.
This is a story about when I was transferred to Hagi, Yamaguchi.

I was told that I could rent a house at a reasonable price, so I rented a house for a while.
The only problem was that it was quite deep in the mountains, and although it was a large house, it was quite old.

One day, about a month after we started living there.
My daughter found a strange box in the yard.

We had looked everywhere in the house and in the yard during the first holidays after we moved in, but there was no box in the yard.

I thought so because, above all, the box was a distinctive box, a conspicuous one that would be recognizable to the eye.

I have little or no psychic sensitivity, but the box seemed unusually ominous to me.

If I had made the right choice at this time, I would not have experienced fear.

I had burned this ominous box.

But from the average person’s point of view, the only choice I had was to burn or throw away what I didn’t need.

Back then…
A few days later something tragic happened.
One of my friends had an accident with his car.
The car caught fire. 
When my friend was rushed to the hospital, he had burns all over his body and was already not breathing.

A few days later.
Another friend of mine was badly burned on his right arm and half of his face when a fire broke out on his clothes while he was making a bonfire at home.

I met my friend in the hospital and asked him what happened.

He told me that a few days before the accident, he had a dream that his body was burned.

I am not a superstitious person, but at that time I thought, “Maybe…” I went home and immediately checked the garden.

I went home and immediately checked the yard.
I checked the garbage pit where they burn garbage. 
That box had not yet been completely destroyed by fire..
When I reached out to examine the box, I remember a terrible chill came over me.

Inside the box, I found dolls.
Three in all. One of them was completely burnt, and one was half burnt.

One was not burnt at all. The dolls were very ordinary Japanese dolls, female dolls wearing kimonos.

When I picked up the half burnt doll, the kimono of the half burnt doll fell off in pieces.
When I looked at the back of the doll, I sat up in horror.

My friend’s name was written on it.
I could not see the name on the blackened doll, but I could roughly make out the name.
The doll that was not burnt had my name written on it.

Everything was strange.
Who would do such a thing and why? My friends and I had nothing in common. I have other friends.

I don’t remember anyone holding a grudge against me. Why is there such a thing in this house …

Did someone live in the house who had a grudge against me… No one I know lives in Yamaguchi.
Everything was strange.

I left that house right after that.
I left the doll at the temple. I still remember the words of the temple staff.

I was going to make a memorial service. But it is not something I can offer.
The grudge attached to this doll is not human.

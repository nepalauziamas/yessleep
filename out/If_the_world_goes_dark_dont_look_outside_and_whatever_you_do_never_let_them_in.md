I'm sorry for ending my first post so abruptly. 
I wanted to tell it all in one go, but it was getting pretty long already, and if I'm being honest, I guess part of me was stalling. Even now. 
 I've never really talked about what happened that day, not at length. Not even to the survivors who experienced their share of it too. 
It was too hard. Too raw. It's still too raw. But now that I've started, I do feel better. Lighter. 








Time, we learned, didn't work the same in this dark. It seemed to drag on forever. Every minute seemed like an hour. An hour felt more like ten. 

We'd sleep for what felt like hours, sometimes even longer, and yet we had no way of knowing. 


We were afraid to eat, afraid that we were eating too soon. We didn't want to run out. So we only ate when we felt truly starved. We couldn't trust the dead clocks or phones so we decided to trust our bodies, hoping that it would know. 








Sleep didn't come easy for us. Instead of lessening as time went on, the noises outside only grew.

Screams from terrified men, women and yes, even children, were never far from our ears. 

They died horribly, begging for help and in many cases, laughing too. As if it were so painful, so unbelievably agonizing that their minds could not process it completely. And so they laughed as they died, while sometimes describing their horror to listening ears.  We sat in the light of the candle, our only protection, crying and trying not to listen. 



There were other sounds too, sounds that I still think about when I'm alone in my bed.  

Growls, but not from any earthly animal. Growls and laughter, maniac and wild, from the mouth of something almost human but not. 

Something, many something's, in a fit of lunacy, gleeful and crazed as they ran through the streets, delighted at the opportunity to be freely walking up here. With us. 

They laughed as they tortured anyone unlucky enough to be outside, and when their victims cried in pain and begged for mercy, they laughed even more. 







There were quiet moments too, which somehow scared me more than the screams and frenzied laughter, moments when the things outside went back to being stealthy, trying to sniff out their next victim, or try to lure them out if there were none to be found. 




I tried to imagine what reasons a person would have for leaving their homes, and stepping out into the void. I could find none. I couldn't fathom a cause to leave the safety of the candlelight. 

I would of course, after it would all be over. I would talk to the other survivors and there I would hear of many who simply walked out into the black, for one reason or another. Most didn't even have a candle. Not a blessed one. For them, the dark was everywhere. 
To them, walking out wasn't a foolish decision. 
It was the *only* decision. 







I prayed a lot, sometimes out loud. I found it quieted the vicious giggles that lingered by our house. 

I prayed we could ride out the rest of the dark without going through another incident. Without something coming to our door again. But I think I knew that wasn't going to happen. I knew in my heart that something much worse was waiting out there for us, something worse than the laughing things or the growling things. 

I somehow felt the wet thing that got Jenna was close and wanted to get in and *would* find a way in. 








Kyle worried me. He was quiet all the time and hardly ate. Aden was anxious, hardly able to sit still for very long, spending most of his time pacing the hallway. 

I chose to stay as close to the candle as possible. Its warm light was my only security. 








During a quiet moment, while my brother was pacing the hall, chewing his fingernails down until they bled, I went to sit on Kyle's mattress, to talk with him. 

He'd been staring at the ceiling for too long, refusing any food or water. 

I had a terrible feeling he was on the edge of madness. I didn't want to think about what that meant.

I sat next to him and placed my hand on his chest. He still didn't take his eyes off the ceiling. 






"I'm sorry about Jenna." I said, because I didn't know what else to say about it. What could I say? 



His eyelids fluttered for a second and refocused on the ceiling. 

"Yeah, me too." He said. His voice sounded like a strained whisper. Raw from the hours of screaming and crying. Like someone who has gone too many days in the desert without water. 





"We need you. You know that don't you?" I said. He did look at me then, turning just his eyes. 





"I know you're hurting. But promise me you won't do anything stupid." I said. 




He exhaled a long breath, as if he'd been holding it in for a long time. Maybe since Jenna ran out into hell with open arms. 

"Like run outside?" He asked. His eyes were swimming in tears. 






"Promise me." I said.



He nodded, and laid his hand over mine and squeezed it. 





"Think this shit's gonna end anytime soon?" He asked, forcing a smile. 





"I don't know. Time passes so slowly now. But it will end. I know that." I said. "We just have to stay inside and wait it out." 








He nodded again. I stayed with him like that with my hand on his chest, and his hand on mine, for a long time. Finally I went to stand but he gripped my hand, holding me there. 


"She was pregnant." He said, so softly I almost didn't hear it. 




The weight of his statement was shocking enough, but then I remembered Jenna's last words, as the wet thing did whatever it did to her, how she screamed and laughed as it ripped her baby from her womb. I knew that's what it did. And I knew that Kyle knew it too, had known it since the moment she said the words. And I knew too that he would never be able to just grieve and recover. Not now. He'd never be okay again. Looking at him, I think he knew that too. 



*"It's ripping meeee. It's taking it all ouuuuut."*





I felt a chill run through my body, through my bones. 
I tried not to picture it. Tried not to imagine her there on the lawn in the pitch black, something so ghastly smiling down at her while it ripped her wide open and took out her child. But these thoughts ran through my brain anyway and I couldn't stop myself from crying. 

We cried together. For Jenna, for their baby, for every single person we had to hear die. And all the people we wouldn't hear but would die. 





When Aden found us like that he didn't have to ask what was wrong or if we were okay. He knew the answer to both these questions. 





We all laid together, holding one another while the world came down around us, or so it felt. 

I think I knew it was coming even before I heard it. I think we all did. 




Footsteps, like bare feet on the front walk. Walking slowly, as if they were taking a peaceful stroll through the park. 

The footsteps stopped at the door, and a moment later there was a knock. Three short raps. 





We didn't answer. We held each other tighter, willing it to go away. 



Three more short raps, just a bit louder than the first three. 



Then a voice, soft and sweet and not at all the voice we'd ever expected. Just three words were enough to nearly break us. 





"Guys? It's me."  



She sounded so normal. Like she had before. 

I think if she hadn't sounded so calm, so natural, I might have believed it was her. 

But that wasn't Jenna. 






"Guys? Come on. Open the door." She said, again so calmly. As if she were just coming back from the store. 





Kyle sat up, staring at the door, eyes wild. I knew instantly he would want to open it. 








"Kyle, can you get the door?" She asked, a touch of annoyance in her voice. 








"Kyle, that's not Jenna." Aden whispered, his hand gripping Kyle's shoulder. 




Kyle started to get up, but stopped. He began to hyperventilate, his mouth hanging open, lips trembling.






"Kyle, babe. I need you to open the door. It's so dark out here." The voice said, soft and soothing. 



Kyle let out a strangled whimper, but he stayed on the bed, my brother's hand gripping his shoulder so tight his knuckles were white. 






"Kyle? You can't leave me alone out here." It said. 




Kyle balled his fists and punched the mattress. "No." He said, and it sounded as if the words themselves were painful. 






"Damnit Kyle!" The voice spat. "You're such a fuck up! You can never do anything right! You couldn't even help me just once!" The longer it spoke the less like Jenna it sounded. A twisted mockery of her. 

But Kyle crumbled on the bed, sobbing. Aden and I held him as best we could. He didn't make for the door, at least. 



"You are a piss poor fuck! A lazy degenerate! Can't even get up and open the door for the mother of your child!" The voice was screaming, Jenna's voice almost totally gone. 



"Stop. Please stop!" Kyle begged. 



It did. For a moment, as if it realized it had slipped out of control. Lost the facade it needed to portray.



"You know?" It said, in Jenna's voice. "I was going to leave you. I was. I knew you'd be a shit father. But I felt sorry for you, so I stayed. And look what it got me." It spoke softly again. If it were saying anything else it might have been comforting. 





"I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. I -" Kyle was saying, his head buried in the mattress. 





"You *are* sorry. A sorry excuse for a man. And you always will be." It said. 






"Go away!" Aden shouted, his body laying almost on top of Kyle. "Just fucking go back to hell!"






The voice was quiet for a long time, so long I thought it had gone away. I allowed myself to feel relief and began to relax my body that had been so tense it hurt. But that was short lived. 






"Kyle. Open. The door!" It said, "Do one thing right for me!" 






"No Kyle. No." I whispered in his ear. He squeezed my hand, a sign he'd heard me. 






"Kyle. Do you want to know what it did to me?" The voice asked, and I could hear its pleasure in saying those words. 







I sat up and moved in front of him, as if I could shield him from the words coming through the door. 





"Stop!" I screamed, but I knew it would keep coming. It wouldn't stop until Kyle opened that door or was a broken heap on the floor. 






"Do you Kyle? I know you've been wondering. Do you want to know what it did to me while you were hiding your fucking eyes like the coward you are?" It said. 




Kyle shook his head over and over, pleading with anything and nothing. "No." He said, again and again. 





"It reached up inside me Kyle. To a place you've never been. It almost felt good. It took hold of our baby. Did you know it was a boy?" It asked, clearly enjoying itself. 






"Oh GOD." Kyle whimpered. 





But the voice continued. "It yanked him out. It took it all. It keeps taking and taking and it will take me to hell when this is all over and it will do things to me that the human mind can't even grasp. And you know what?" It paused, letting those poisonous words sink in. 

"It will do it all to our son too. For eternity. Because of you." 





Kyle was sobbing, tears and snot streaked his face, and I thought he'd lose what sanity he had left. 






"Get the fuck out of here!" I screamed, throwing a plate at the door, letting it shatter. 





"Oh, Emmy. Our *protector.*" It said, spitting the word out like rotten food. 

"You think you know how to keep you safe? Keep them safe?" It laughed, a horrible sound that I could feel in my teeth. 

"You're all gonna die in there. You just don't know it yet." It banged on the door like a hammer smashing into it, and I thought for sure it would come crashing in. 





But it stopped, for whatever reason it did. And we were left alone with its words still hanging over us like an axe ready to fall. 







"You got to eat." I said later, trying for the umpteenth time to get Kyle to eat some crackers. 






"How would you know?" He said. He'd decided to move his mattress back into his bedroom, and had been staying in there. 



We tried to talk him into staying with us, near the candle, but he adamantly refused. He agreed to keep the door open at least, so some light would get in. 






Aden thought he just wanted to be closer to Jenna's things, where they'd slept together. But part of me wondered if he liked being in there, where the edges of dark reached out towards him like fingers. 






"Just eat a few crackers. Please." I said. I held out the half empty pack and he took it. 




"These are stale." He said, chewing one, making a face. 






"It's better than nothing." I said. "Come back out to the living room. It's safer there." 





He shook his head, popping the last two crackers in his mouth and tossing the wrapper. 

He closed his eyes, trying to sleep or pretending to. I went to his door, making sure to leave it open wide enough to let the light in. 





"They lie, you know." I said. He didn't respond, but I knew he heard me. 







"He should be out here, with us." I told Aden, sitting on the mattress. "The light's stronger out here."







"He's a grown man. He can choose where he wants to be Em." He said. "He probably needs time alone." 








"That can come after. It's not safe to be alone. Not while it's still dark." 




He rubbed his eyes, sitting with his elbows on his knees. 

He looked so tired. Drained. He looked how I felt. 







"When is this going to end?" He asked. But I didn't think he was asking me. 




I put my arm around him and laid my head on his shoulder. I didn't have the answers. 

We fell asleep and when I woke I almost forgot that Kyle had gone back to his room. I went to pop my head in his room, just to make sure he was okay. He was on his side, facing the wall. I thought about going over to make sure he was alright but I didn't want to bother him. I figured he needed the time to mourn. He wasn't just mourning Jenna. He was mourning the loss of his child, his son, too. 






I used the bathroom, and quickly washed my body with a washcloth and soap. I was too scared to get in the shower. 

The second I stepped in the living room there came a series of knocks on the front door. I froze. Aden's eyes flew open and he sat up, looking for me. When he saw me he relaxed a bit, and motioned for me to come to him, a finger on his lips. 

I took a step towards him, and it started again, like dozens of hands knocking at once. 






"Emmy?" 


I gasped. My mother. Not really, I knew. But her voice. Aden and I exchanged a worried glance. 

"Sweety, can you let me in?" 





I quickly walked to the mattress and sat beside my brother, both of us trembling and holding onto each other.  





"Aden. Open the door." It said, firmly.  We both knew that tone, my mother's no nonsense tone. That tone used to get our butt's in gear. But that wasn't our mother out there. Couldn't be our mother. 



We knew it was coming. The anger. The cruelty. The lies. We were trying to prepare ourselves, telling ourselves that it wasn't our mother out there. 




There was silence. But for how long? The things in the dark never minded the wait. They enjoyed it. Relished it. 




"Kids. Your father's sick. He had a heart attack when the lights went out." It said, voice breaking. "I had to come and get you. He might. He might not make it." 






Aden held me tighter, and I pictured our father, grabbing his chest in a panic after having gone blind, or thinking he had. I pictured him grabbing for something to hold onto, stumbling  for my mother, and hearing her own terror as he collapsed.  

Was he really dying? Was he on a bed somewhere, his life slipping away in the dark as we refused to let in our own mother? 





"She's not our mom. She's not here." Aden whispered, as if he could hear my thoughts. He repeated these words like a mantra. Whether for me or himself. 





"Emmy? Aden? Open this door immediately. I don't have time for this. Your dad is very sick!" It shouted, beating against the door. 






"Just go the fuck away! Can't you see we aren't going to open it?" Aden screamed. The knocking stopped and silence fell over us again, but we knew it wasn't going to last. 






Aden squeezed me tightly, almost enough to hurt, but I let him. It felt good. Safe. Like when I was 7 and he was 8 and we were riding the horror attraction at the carnival for the first time. He was scared too, but he let me bury my face in his chest, his arms wrapped around me. I could hear his heart hammering now just like I could hear it then on that rickety ride. But this wasn't an attraction. This was real. 






"Do you really think that this door is enough to keep us out?" The voice, its true voice, asked. "If we truly wanted to come in, this piece of wood could not stop us." 

I couldn't tell if it was male or female. It sounded old, ancient. Dead. Like dry leaves. 

Aden and I were shaking so much that my muscles ached. 



It shrieked with laughter behind the door, smashing into it once, twice, so many times I lost count. And with every cracking of the wood, every groan of its weight on the hinges, it would shriek and howl with delight. 





It stopped just when I thought I couldn't stand another minute of it. 

But I knew it lingered there. Listening. Waiting. 





"Oh say." It said, teasingly. "How many are you in there? There seems to be one missing. You haven't checked on him in an awfully long time." 




I felt my heart seize and Aden stiffen against me. 

"He's ok Em. It's just trying to scare us." Aden whispered to me. I nodded that I understood. 






"He's dead in that room, you know.  You left him to die. And you call yourselves a friend." It said. 






I jumped up, pushing away from the security of Aden's embrace. He stood with me, reaching for my arms. I could hear him talking to me, telling me that Kyle was fine. But he followed me anyway. The sweat on his face and fear in his eyes braying the confidence in his voice. 




We hurried down the hall, that awful cackling following us the whole way. 

From the doorway I could see Kyle still laying on his side, facing the window that we'd covered with a blanket. 



"Kyle?" Aden called from the doorway. "You alright?" 



I waited for a reply, for even just a shrug of his shoulders. But he was quiet, still. 



I tried to swallow but my tongue was so dry in my mouth. 

Was he breathing? I couldn't tell. Not from the doorway. 




I took a step into the room. It felt cold. Much colder than before. I forced myself to walk. I came around the bed, and when I saw his face I knew.

That thing at the door was right. He was dead. 

His face was slack, pale, his parted lips already turning blue. 


Tears stung my eyes, and I was somehow on my knees. Aden was beside me, saying Kyle's name over and over in disbelief. 




"How? When?" I said, shaking my head. *"WHY."*






Kyle's eyes were glassy and wide, as if he'd died surprised, or very afraid. 

I crawled to the bedside, and touched his face. It was cold, hard. I told him we loved him. That he was a good friend. That he would have been a great dad. 

Aden hugged him. We both cried. 

It was a shitty way to say goodbye to someone we'd known and loved since we were in middle school. 






It wasn't hard to see how he'd died. A shard of jagged glass was lodged into his throat, and the mattress beneath was drenched in red. 

The coppery smell hung heavy in the air. 



We were about to cover him with a sheet, but something didn't feel right. 

A question that was racing through my head. 



Where'd he get the glass? 




I searched his room, tossing things around, pulling open drawers, his closet, ignoring my brother's worried questions. 




But I found nothing. Nothing broken. Nothing missing a piece of jagged glass. 



Then it clicked. The window. He'd broken the window. 




I spun to face it, the blanket still hanging over it. 

I stepped up to it, slowly running my hands over the blanket, feeling for any broken section. I knew it would be there even before I felt it. An empty piece, the size of a small dinner plate. 






"What is it?" Aden asked. Our eyes met and without any words he knew. 





"Oh my God." He said. He yanked my up by my elbow, dragging me from the room. We could hear something laughing at the window as we tried to barricade the door with Aden's dresser. 

 


I hated leaving Kyle alone in there, in the dark. But we had no choice. He'd given the evil outside a way inside. 




Why had he done it? Why the window? I asked myself that question dozens of times as Aden and I huddled together in the living room. I still ask it. 

Did he look outside? Did something make him do it? 

I couldn't imagine Kyle risking our lives unless he had no control over his actions. 

But what did I know? After he lost Jenna, Kyle lost a part of his mind too. 






Aden and I prayed together. We ate the rest of the crackers, and Kyle was right. They were stale. We ate them anyway, and tried to pretend our friend wasn't dead in the next room.  Tried to forget there was a broken window to the evil outside. 






We were trying to sleep when I heard the scratching. Faint at first, then louder until even Aden heard it. 

We sat up as a noise came from the hallway.  The sound of a dresser being moved away from the door.  We were frozen there on the bed, waiting for something to walk around the corner, shambling towards us. 




We heard unsteady footsteps moving up the hall.  Aden grabbed my hand and I knew he was thinking the same thing I was. We were going to die here. In this house. There was nowhere to run. 

I thought of the woman we heard screaming in the street. Of Jenna, her screams of torment, her laughter. Would I die like that? Would I be in so much agony that I could only laugh? 

Would I have to listen to my brother laugh too?




When the thing rounded the corner and stepped before us, framed by the candlelight, I couldn't help but scream. 






It looked at us and grinned, blue lips stretching impossibly wide. The shard of glass still jutted from his throat, pale skin stained red. 

Those glassy eyes watched us, dead eyes but still seeing. He reached up and pulled the shard from his throat, the sound of tearing flesh unbearable.  




I was waiting for him to lunge at us, to attack us with the shard, but he stood glaring at us with his dead eyes, accusingly. You let me die, they seemed to say. 

You let Jenna die. My child. 



He took a shuffling step closer, that grin betraying the hate in those eyes. 




The hysterical laughter was all around us then. There seemed to be hundreds of them outside, surrounding our house. 






"Kyle." Aden said, all color draining from his face. He almost looked like a corpse. Like Kyle. 





Kyle, still smiling, reached for the candle, and held it, his other hand still gripping the bloody shard that killed him. He brought the candle to his face so that we could see just how empty his eyes looked, how dry and deathly pale his skin had become.


Then with grinning lips, he blew the candle out, and let the darkness swallowed us up.

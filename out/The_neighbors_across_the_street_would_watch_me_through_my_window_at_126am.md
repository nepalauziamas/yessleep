I always hated the neighborhood I grew up in. It looked like a neighborhood you’d see in a Tim Burton movie. All the homes are oddly shaped and painted in dark, dull colors. It felt like there was a thin veil of fog filling the streets at all times. I was one of the few kids in the whole neighborhood, and most of the other kids were…a little weird to say the least. Above all that though, where the neighbors across the streets. An old shady couple that just showed up one day, never introduced themselves to anyone and they barely left their house…not during the day anyway.

I was about 7 when I first realized what they did at night. It was a hot summer night so I left the window cracked while I slept considering I had no fan in my room. After a few hours of sleep I was awoken by the sound of rustling bushes right outside my window. I looked over, and got up to look out the window, to see four small gleams coming from the bush closest to my bedroom. They were far too dull to be any kind of flashlight, so in my child brain, my first thought was “ four eyed monster!” before quickly rushing to my parents room in great fear. I told them about the monster in the bush, but once they went to look, the gleams of moonlight were gone. My parents managed to calm me down and convince me it was just some raccoons or something, and after an hour or so I managed to put myself back to sleep.

About 5 years later, I saw them again. this time being woken up by the sound of a door closing from our side. I looked at my alarm clock which read 1:26am, before looking out the window to see who had been out this late, but didn’t see anyone. Figuring it was no big deal I turned to head back to bed, however as I did, in the corner of my eye…four small glows from within the bush. I began to freak out. I was at that age where your left and right brain are constantly battling over rational and irrational  fears, causing a mix of dark thoughts as to what could be in that bush from monsters to serial killers. 

I woke my parents up again explained that the  lights had come back. This time they took me a bit more seriously seeing as how I wasn’t a 7 year old anymore, and yet again, the lights were gone. They got a little pissed, telling me I'm too old to be scared of monsters,and dad did go out to look, but of course found nothing. So it was another few months of paranoia. I’ve tried staying up to catch whatever I was seeing but I could never stay up past 1am. However once I reached 16, I truly found out what they really were…my child brain wasn’t too far off when I called them monsters.

By this point in my life I was a junior in high school, and was much acquainted with late nights and all nighters. Granted most of the time I was either playing Ps4 with my headset on, or doing work with headphones in so I wasn’t exactly paying attention to the outside world. However one night I just so happened to forget my headphones in my locker, and was up studying midterms when suddenly, I heard the sound of a door opening and closing. I quickly looked at my alarm clock and yet again, 1:26am just like  when I was younger, what was different this time was when I went to the window to see what was going on I looked to the bush not to see four gleaming lights, But the elderly couple from across the street.

They were just standing there, waving at me with large unsettling smiles. I began to panic, and that panic grew 10 fold when I looked at their hands…each of them holding a pair of binoculars…four glass lenses that I thought were animal eyes all those years. These people have been stalking me my whole life…and once the man lifted his other hand from behind his back, I got a good idea on what they planned to do with me, as he revealed a large, medieval time dagger. I stumbled back and began hyperventilating as my brain ran in circles about these people spying on me my whole life, planning to take my life, or worse. I eventually managed to bring myself to my feet, quickly rushing to my parents room and waking them in desperation. This time, they fully believed me, quickly calling the cops, my father rushing outside with his pistol. They were completely gone, but they made one mistake, they didn’t close their front door all the way when making their escape. The rest of the night was spent having police questioning me, and my parents frantically apologizing for not believing me when I was younger. 

I was able to rest a little easier knowing both my parents and the cops were aware and working on the situation, however they weren’t found anywhere in their home. I forced myself to believe they fled due to getting caught…a belief that was quickly disproven, when I woke up the next morning to see a message written across my window in black paint. “You got too old. We enjoy our meat fresh, and tender. it pleases the beast”.  It’s been a few years since then. I’m recently back in town for spring break. the house across the street is still abandoned, and against my better judgment…I think i’m gonna check out the place

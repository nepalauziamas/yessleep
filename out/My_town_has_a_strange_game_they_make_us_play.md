  

I just graduated my sophomore year in high school.  I don’t think I’ll make my Senior year.

My town celebrates a unique ritual every year.  My name is Andy.  I live in a normal small town, beside the yearly event, which I will explain very soon.  I do normal things.  I have normal friends.  We play baseball, we go to movies- you get the point.  I’m putting this story out there because I think it’s time for everyone in the world to know about my town’s “unique,” ritual. Consequences be damned. 

My school is decently small.  My graduating class will be somewhere around 100 or so people.  And at the end of my junior year, which is tomorrow, we will all be taking part in a walk of unknown length. Could be 1, could be 10 miles.  I know.  Doesn’t sound that bad, right?  I can tell you that it will be.  I can’t tell you exactly why because I don’t know much about the thing.  Part of the tradition is the “victors,” of this walk do not divulge any details about what happens.  We’ve pieced a little bit here and there, but largely we are in the dark.  I’ve spent a lot of time thinking and worrying about this.  And it’s happening soon.  So much for my summer vacation.

Schools out as Alice said.  The final bell has rung and I’m sitting in the parking lot of my school.  I am officially a Junior.  If I survive the summer.  The walk starts on the last Sunday in June.  At least they give us a couple weeks to enjoy the Summer.  We all think it’s strange that the walk is after our sophomore year and not junior or even senior year.  I suspect that the creators of this event didn’t want kids to stress about the walk and their senior year.  Just a guess. Oh, just don’t participate you may be saying. We’ve all been informed that is not an option. Nothing more than that, nothing less.  Briefing is in a week. 

Ok.  Me and about 99 of my classmates just were told a little more about what I will now call “The Last Walk.”  I knew it was going to be bad, and people would die, but… I just didn’t know how scary this would be.  The council basically just said goodbye to us because they don’t know how many will survive this walk.  The basic rules are as follows:  You can bring whatever you want.  You can run if you want to, but you should conserve your energy.  Prepare for being out in the elements for a week or more.  Time moves differently when the walk starts.  We also cannot stop moving.  Only to “evacuate,” they said.  There will be no need for sleep.  The only thing they physically gave us was a little sheet of note pad paper with the different areas we would be walking through.  I’ll go through those as I attack the walk.  And.. That’s pretty much it.  They will bus all of us to the starting line and let us go on our way.  First one to cross the finish, wherever that may be, will win.  The prize they said is surviving.  And they hinted there may be another surprise for the winner. 

One more journal entry before I lay down for the night.  I doubt I’ll get any sleep, as tomorrow at daybreak begins the walk.  You might be wondering what I’m most worried about.  I am too.  I want to document this, not only because I might not survive, but I want posterity for this.  I’m not against the walk, but I don’t completely understand it either.  I’ve talked with numerous survivors and victors from my town.  To be clear; you can survive and not be the winner.  There will be many survivors but just one winner, like any race.  But there will be fatalities.  That’s what we don’t understand.  What is out there?  What is waiting for us on our potential last walk?  I will find out in mere hours and hopefully I’ll be able to describe it to you all.  I am bringing my phone, wired ear buds, an actual voice recorder, and even my laptop.  Hell, I might be able to upload a podcast while I’m out.  Just have to do it on the go.

It’s a hot and humid June morning.  I have my bag packed.  I’ve loaded up on dehydrated food, water, MRE’s, etc.  My electronics are charged, and I have dozens of backup batteries should I need them.  I have to stop writing; a big man is throwing black hoods on my classmates.  I’ll see you at the starting line.

I’m still on my knees with the rest of my classmates.  The chaperones told us we are not able to move or open our eyes until we cannot hear the bus anymore.  My eyes are closed so hard it hurts my head.  When the hood was yanked off I could feel the sun immediately.  It feels unnaturally hot on my face.  The engines have long been gone.  I can’t hear anything, no people, no sounds of nature.  I slowly open my eyes and see.. no one.  It’s just me. 

Taking in my surroundings I can see my possessions have been placed by my side.  No classmates.  I’m looking at what appears to be a subdivision.  All the houses look the same.  One road stretches out in front of me.  White houses with white fences line either side of the paved road.  This must be “the neighborhood,” which is the first location that starts the last walk.

Beside the weird serenity of this place, it still feels like a normal subdivision.  This won’t last long.  Slowly I make my way down the street.  There’s no wind, no animals, and no sound.  I didn’t know what to expect but I definitely didn’t expect that we would be dropped off in different locations.  This must be some kind of strategy set up by the council, so we don’t get to work together.  I wasn’t planning on working with anyone anyway, but the company would have been nice. How would being with my friends help anyway. 

As I started passing home after home, I noticed that not only are they all the same, but every home had a family sitting inside.  Not moving, not eating, but sitting at what appears to be a dinner table in the dining area.  There may be food on the tables, but I can’t see that clearly.  The mother, father, and two children do not move.  They stare at each other like statues.  This has been a strange start, but I was ready for anything, so I march on.  As I’m looking at the still family members to my left and right, I almost ran right into an older women standing in my path on the sidewalk. 

Thankfully I must have sensed something, or someone was in my way and saw her before an awkward collision may have happened.  I moved to the side and did one of those facial movements that says “hello, I’m acknowledging you as a person but don’t want to actually open my mouth to make words.”  I accompanied said facial expression with a slight head nod.  Then she spoke.  “My son dies here.”  “Oh,” I choked out.. umm, I’m sorry.  That’s all I could get out I was completely thrown off by this.  I slightly picked up my speed, wanting to get away from this woman as soon as possible, but still didn’t want to appear rude.  Weird all around. I also didn’t recognize her. Her face was off. Her eyes.. not placed at a “normal,” distance.  When I was about 30 feet away I glanced over my shoulder, seeing she was standing in the same spot as when I passed her, but she was just.. staring at me.  I swiftly moved my stare away from here and back to the path in front of me.  As I was ending the first phase of the walk, I noticed something rather strange.  The “residents,” of the “Neighborhood,” were all out on their lawns.  Staring at me, motionless.  I again picked up the pace.  A quiet buzz started in my head.  It could have been in the air, but it felt like it was just inside my head.  The tree line was approaching.  I was almost done with the first level.  The buzzing intensified.  The residents looked like they were becoming agitated.  I don’t know if anyone dies at this level, but I know I won’t perish here.  I made a dash for the tree line. The last thing I see as I take one more glance over my shoulder are the residents pointing at me. Right arms outstretched. Cautioning, or directing.  I’m out of the Norman Rockwell hell space.  See you guys later. 

Once I got within a few steps of the Cryptic Woods, I slowed my pace.  I couldn’t stop of course, but I went as slowly as I could.  I didn’t even process what that lady said.  She said her son “dies,” here.  Not “died.”  What the hell does that mean?  He dies multiple times?  He dies every day?  Man, I don’t want to know the answer, I just want to move on and get this event over with.

Ok good.  No more buzzing.  No more weird neighbors.  No more.. “residents,” of the neighborhood.  I’ve now gotten deep into the “woods.” Mere minutes ago the sun was shining bright. Now it looks like dusk.  As we speak, I am looking up at a dense forest of massive pines.  The trees are thick, but the floor is open, if that makes sense.  I feel like I’ve been here before.  It’s a comfort.  I suddenly realize that I have not eaten since I started.  But like they said, time and space are different here.  I forced myself to slam down a cliff bar, still admiring the scenery.  Frozen.  I can’t move.  A light shines through the forest canopy.  The most glorious tree I’ve ever seen lies before me.  I’ve seen this before.  The Evertree.  It’s half alive, half dead.  So unnatural in the middle of this beautiful forest.  I Feel the energy.  I think I’ll just .. sit here..

BOOM! My eyes open after being closed for maybe a half second.  I’m still standing.  Engines and artillery are coming.  Bark and grass are flying around me, from the rounds being shot at my direction.  I heard one word in my head: “MOVE.”  I must have stopped for too long.  The damn tree tried to kill me.  I don’t even see it anymore.  Not wasting another second, I moved quick.  Didn’t have to run, like they said, but I walk freaking quick.  Apparently, this pulled the goon squad off of me.  Now I know they are watching always.  The most sobering moment so far for sure.  From now on I don’t have to enjoy the view so much.  Let’s just move towards the finish line.

Leaving the woods felt good.  I can see now that the first couple levels were an appetizer. I can also see natural daylight again.  Stepping out of the woods, I am immediately in another suburban type of area.  Following the sidewalk, I see only abandoned houses and trash all over the place.  And this, as Shell Silverstein Said, is where the sidewalk ends.

I immediately felt like something was very wrong.  Saying I was creeped out is an understatement.  The sidewalk I was following abruptly ended.  The scenery was so unsettling I guess I didn’t notice that my cement path was ending.  Standing on the edge of the sidewalk, I looked down at what appeared to be a 10-story drop.  Looking around, in a panicked state, I had no other moves.  It was like I was a piece on a monopoly board, but the position my top hat was in hovered over an un-survivable drop.  My mind was racing.  How did I get here?  Why do we have to do this?  Does anyone else in the country or world do this? I don’t want to be here; I’m just going to jump.  I’m going to end it.  “Just walk forward.”  What,,, hello??  I have not heard another person’s voice this whole trip.  I took note of how tired and hungry I was.  I also discovered how sore I was too.  I must be delusional.  Did someone just talk to me? I’m serious.  If something is here, say something..  I can’t do this walk anymore.  I tried, but I can’t.  I can’t anymore. 

The jump felt great.  I was ready to give up.  I did give up.  When I hit the bottom I .. woke up.  Checking myself for injury or bleeding, I found nothing.  I did not feel great, but I was safe.  “Who are you?” I yelled to the voice.  Nothing. 

Andy is still alive.  And I’ve made it to the next stage.  After walking for what I think is another 4 or 5 miles I have found Clairmont street.  Still tired, but still motivated to walk across the stage as a high school senior, I move.  In this stage I have to find the.. “Sunken house.”  No one was sure what that meant but I should know what that means when I see it.  The problem was that the temperature was quickly dropping.  My normal climate growing up was a desert style high 80 to 90 degrees in the summer.  I had friends from the north that grew up with incredible cold temps.  I could never imagine.  But right here, right now, I’m glad I was prepared.  It must have been about 30 degrees Fahrenheit.  I don’t know what time it is anymore so it could be in the morning.  Or it could be at night, I just do not know.

 Using all of my gear to keep warm, I finally found the “Sunken House.”  There’s so many homes here, but so many more that are empty.  The one I was looking for is.. sunk.  I’m so glad I saw it because it is so subtle.  There were two golden lions on either side of the driveway.  The house is half underground, half above.  Not sure what I’m supposed to do, I just stood there and.. said a little prayer.  At this point in the challenge, I am delirious. I’ve found the checkpoints.  I’ve survived to this point.  I found the sunken house, which slingshot me to the next level. 

I wonder how many of my friends have died at this point.  I know they have, I’m not naïve.  I’m waiting for my undeniable death too.  I survived the neighborhood.  I survived the cryptic woods, including the evertree. And I just escaped the weird ending sidewalk, with the sunken house afterword.  All I can do is keep moving now.  I’m so tired.  My feet hurt.  My legs hurt. My soul hurts.

My mind.. is still fresh and scared of what I’ve seen.  I think being fully aware is the worst right now.  I’m so tired.  What I’ve found now is an awful development simply titled “The Homes.”

One moment I am walking outside, the next I am inside a long hallway.  It looks like a retirement home.  Complete with malfunctioning lights and dripping ceilings.  If you’ve had family in one of these places, then you are no doubt familiar with the smell.  “Help me..” I almost fell over I was so startled.  “Hello,” I yelled into the dark hallway.  “Help.. heeeelp me.” It felt like it was coming closer, I heard quiet footsteps that sounded like they were behind me.  The soft steps became louder, and they were moving faster.  I used every ounce of energy to run as hard and fast as I could.  The further I got down the hallway, the longer it stretched.  Panic was setting in.  Out of the corner of my eye I start seeing people, or what looks like people stepping out of their room. 

All I could hear now was heavy breathing, and not mine.  I begged and prayed I would get out of here.  My legs were on absolute fire.  I really didn’t think I could get out of here.  I closed my eyes and kept running.  When I opened them I was on the ground.  Quickly getting to my feet to avoid the stoppage, and therefore the immediate death, I saw I was outside the Homes.  Thank God.  The smell was still there, but I had somehow made it.  Taking one last look over my shoulder I was greeted with the most frightening image I’ve seen so far.  Little shadowy faces with red eyes peered at me from the windows.  This walk has gotten much more serious.

Escaping the homes, where I bet most of my colleagues will meet their end, I am still moving forward.  The next level appears.  The 9-mile tower.  It is something out of a medieval story.  A glorious tower that reaches to the clouds.  When they told us the name of this level at the briefing, I had no idea what to expect.  Staring at it now, what do I do?  I’ll be walking to it soon.  Do I enter and climb?  Is there something I need to find in there?  Like a princess or something? 

I smell pastry.  I smell.. steak and chicken.  There must be a feast going on inside the tower, it smells amazing.  A voice from the wind speaks to me.  “Come to the tower.  We know you are tired.  A meal will be waiting for you.”  Man, that sounds wonderful.  I suppose I can stop just ever so briefly.  I have not been this hungry the whole trip.  That cliff bar is a distant memory.

I am standing at the foot of the tower.  Being this close makes the tower much more impressive.  This castle like exterior stretches upwards to the sky for a seemingly infinite distance.  The drawbridge slowly opened before me, making the smells of the feast more irresistible.  A golden sign just had an “UP,” arrow posted on it.  I take it I’m supposed to climb.  As I take one step forward the spell is broken.  Wait a minute, I say to myself.  If I go inside this giant tower, how am I supposed to get out?  I can’t stop moving.  If I enter, I don’t think I’ll be able to leave.  Nice try, tower.  Nice try, walk.  The last few stops have been the most difficult yet.  I think that means the ending is near.

As I trudge along the empty field, I finally see it: Streamers, balloons, tables with what I hope is real food.  The relief of this nightmare being over is incredible.  I can already feel myself going back to the “real world.”  The closer I get I can make out some people.  Teachers from my school and some other alumni from this ritual I presume.  There’s also a couple bleachers set up for the townsfolk.  All in all, I’d say there’s about 200 or so people here, wherever here is.  The only thing I don’t see is my fellow students.  Either I’m the first one to finish, or they are all dead.

“Our Winner!” the principal shouted.  The town’s people gave me a loud round of applause.  “You have completed the walk, now have a seat young man, you earned it.”  Not sure sitting will feel any better, I fall to the ground.  For the moment, it does feel so good to stop.  My body has a fire raging inside of it.  Just a few minutes later there are some classmates of mine limping to the finish.  We all give each other weak smiles and nods of congratulations.  The adults must have been tracking all 100 or so of us.  75 of us survived.  A record, apparently.  We were directed to a podium behind a table.  The table had a sheet covering whatever contents were underneath.

What happened next is something I’ll have to live with for the rest of my life.  Being the victor, they told me, was a huge honor.  I would be known as a local legend and would be financially taken care of to whatever college I decide to attend.  Remember when I said the winner gets another “special,” surprise?  The principal took down the sheet on the table, revealing a handgun.  “You have survived the last walk.  You now get the added bonus of taking the life of one of your fellow classmates.”  My vision blurred and I became weak.  “We understand this is something of a shock.  Everyone goes through it.  However, it is intended as a reward and a release of sorts.  Also, not killing anyone is not an option.  If you decline it will go to the runner up and you will be killed, and so on and so on.  This also ensures that no one divulges the secrets of our little annual ritual as you now have blood on your hands like we all do.”  The smile on his face was so cold I didn’t know if this was a prank or a test.  The faces of the towns’ people told me it was neither.

I grabbed the weapon.  Feeling the cold weight in my hand I just stared at it for some time.  Without any more delay. It’s over.  It was all over.  I felt no remorse, I felt no anger.  I wanted to put this nightmare behind me.  A couple of men dressed in suits quietly and quickly cleaned the area.  The crowd gave me a polite clap.  The rest of my classmates stood in silence.  Slowly the gathering ended.. and I lost conciseness. 

I woke up days, maybe weeks later in my room.  It was a warm summer day.  I was back in town, and everything seemed like it went back to normal.  Hello summer vacation.  Now I can get ready for my junior year.

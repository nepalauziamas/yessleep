Okay, let me explain.
I grew up in a relatively small town and slightly abusive family. At the time this story took place, I was 15 years old, still living with my parents. See, I always had this weird thing I could do where if I closed my eyes and really visualized a setting around me, I could open my eyes and arrive in that setting, and everything felt eerily real.
This didn’t feel like a dream. It felt like taking a daily stroll along the sunny path in the neighborhood next to mine lined with trees. I could do anything in these universes, not including summon people, so I was always alone. I was a 100% introvert, so I was fine with this. It would have been weird to see anyone there. 
That’s what I thought, until I strangely encountered someone. Another teenager. He told me that his name was Jasper, and that he had the same ability as I did, and that was how he had got there. I believed him wholeheartedly, and perhaps foolishly. 
Jasper was not real. I should have known that.

Around the same time I met Jasper, I started seeing oddities. We would be walking on the balcony of the palace I made, looking out across the fake kingdom that was engulfed with sunshine, when I would hear his voice behind me, though he was right next to me. I would turn and spot a dark, crow-like shadow that would turn towards me, disappear, and leave me with a splitting headache. The place where I always appeared for the first time started to be polluted, rotted, and dead. 

I opened my eyes in my usual grass field, turning to spot the palace where Jasper would be. 

Instead, I found myself on the ground, writing in pain as a human figure loomed over me. Something about it was not human. It was only a shadow, nothing following it, and it had a neck that was too long and hands that were too large. It looked as if someone-something, had tried to imitate a human. I skittered away, holding my head in my hands as a huge migraine engulfed me. 

I walked back to the palace, something I shouldn’t have done. There was no one there, and immediately the kingdom seemed unnaturally quiet, other than a few crow calls. We had never had crows there. At this point, I was starting to get seriously creeped out, so I did the only thing I could.

I opened my eyes. Holy shit, I thought. I had transported into my universe in a different place than I appeared. I scrambled to the window, looking out across my neighborhood. Nobody was there. I cautiously creeped out of my house, practically having a heart attack when I stumbled on something on the ground. It was my father, covered in blood. He stared at me with unsettling yellow eyes, which I realized were not staring at me. They were staring at the grey sky, glossed over. He was dead. 
Next to him was a message in dashes and dots.
See, I have an amazing memory. That’s how I’m able to remember every detail about this story. I also know Morse code. 
I also knew that the message said “C-R-O-W”, and something else I couldn’t decipher. 
That’s when a hoard of Crows started flocking towards me. And it’s also when I deciphered the rest of the message.
“R-U-N”.

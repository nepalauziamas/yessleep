Me (28m) and my fiancee (26f) recently bought a house together in Greenville MI. For those of you who don't know Greenville was a small town when I was growing up, but now it is booming. It is aways away from any other large towns and once you pass through it you are basically in state lands. 

The other night we were getting ready for bed with our dog Grizzly. I had to work the next morning at 6AM so I went to bed around 10PM. She stayed up working on her homework. As soon as I laid down my dog started barking at me. My fiancee came into the room put him on a lead and took him outside. I started to fall asleep. Not 30 minutes later he starts to bark again. This time I get up and take him outside. He doesn't poop or pee. Just stares off into the woods. After 10 minutes or so I went back to bed.  

I woke up multiple times throughout the night having this strong feeling of dread. I had this feeling that someone or something was walking around my house stalking it. As if it wanted to get inside. 

Midnight came and she was finally laying in bed with me. Not 10 minutes into us laying down and Grizzly is barking again. We yell at him to shut up. Which doesn't work, he doesn't speak English. So fiancee gets up and is gone for 30 minutes. She comes back crying. I asked her what is wrong and she said "Everything is fine" and went to bed.

He started to bark within 30 seconds of her laying down. Naturally I am annoyed and pissed off because my dog is being a brat. I get up tell him to stop barking and put him on the lead. Take him outside... again. He stares off into the woods and pees. As we were outside I look into the woods with the flashlight I bought with me. Behind my house is an unfenced backyard. I have 2 neighbors on either side and a neighbor  Diagonal to my right. Behind me and diagonal to my left is all tress to woods that are not very large but oribably 3 scare miles. 

I am scanning the woods knowing that their are coyotes, raccoons, foxes, etc in there. As I scanned I saw a deer. Spooked me but I didn't really think much of it. Until it started to stand on its hind legs. As soon as it did that my dog immediately started to walk towards the backdoor to get back inside the house. I froze for a second and gained my composer and walked to the door and go inside. 

 As go inside again starts to bark again. This time I ignore him for i have to be up in 4 hours for work. He eventually settles down and goes to bed. Woke up at 5 with 1.5 hours of sleep. And called into work. My drive is a good 40 minutes, I knew if I went I was gonna fall asleep at the wheel. I stayed home that day. My fiancee got up and left for work at 8. 

Later in the evening as she is telling me about her day. She tells me that I left the back slider door unlocked last night. As she said that my eyes widened and I kind of lost my breathe. I told her I was sorry like it was no bid deal but I was freaking out on the inside. Then she brings up Grizzly and says "he was growling so much last night, I was so scared" I cuddled you a little harder last night" I asked her why she was scared and she said she had this feeling that something was in the "giraffe room" (we call it that cause it has a glass table but the legs are all giraffes) like something evil" 

The thing was in my house... I went to go into the room later on and it smelt terrible like someone took dog poop, dried blood and rotten food left it in the sun for a few house and through it in that room. The smell is gone now. And I don't have the heart to tell.my fiancee what I saw.

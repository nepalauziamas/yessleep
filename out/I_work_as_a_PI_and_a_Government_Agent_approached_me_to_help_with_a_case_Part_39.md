Klein, speaking to himself, pulled at his hair as he walked over to the coffin, large syringe in hand. Using it to draw blood from Nick’s arm, he walked back to the table. My partner not moving in the slightest. The person sitting in the chair had their head down. Carefully lifting it he whispered something over to them. His face filled with grief. The one he spoke with had been a very beautiful woman, who'd looked to be dead for at least a few days. He stroked her hair as if she was just sleeping. Whispering promises as he took a strand of hair.  

He quickly wrote some spellwork, then her hair and Nick’s blood were placed down as he wrangled a chicken and rat to the table's surface. I flinched as he quickly killed both animals to activate whatever spell he just made. At first, nothing happened, then a burst of red light came. The bodies of the dead animals twisted and cracked into something else. For a half a second, it almost appeared human in the light. Then, it morphed into something very like the creature’s we’d come across before. He was the one making them. But for what reason? Judging from how much he cursed and shouted, the outcome was not what he wanted.  

The new creature looked just as twisted as the others. The human face that half taken over by a beak growing out of the skull, looked similar to the dead woman he took the hair from. The monster turned, ready to attack, but it bounced off another invisible wall as Klein cursed at himself, not understanding what he was doing wrong. The monster appeared hurt, and it started to limp around. The pool of water barely came up to its knees.  

I caught Ancaer’s eye and we silently knew what to do. He would attack Klein and I would go for Nick. We split off; he ran out from behind the rock kicking up water. Klein yelled, startled by not only the sudden appearance, but by who it was. Ancaer was feared throughout The Corporation. No agent wanted him after them.   

Unknown to us, Klein had set out traps beforehand. Ancaer set them off, magic ripping through the water. He shielded his face with his arms, waiting for the traps to stop. I did something very stupid. Grabbing a rock, I placed it inside his jacket pocket so I could throw it over to him. He snatched it from the air just in time to cover himself as another blast of magic came down. I now ran forward without any kind of protection.   

I assumed the wall might be the same as before. Running through the water, I was determined to get to Klein and to take Nick home.  My only plan to punch him in the face hoping that would be enough. My body moved solely by instinct. When Klein brought out a charm, I didn’t even hesitate to crash through, knocking the table aside. His palm hit my shoulder, charm making contact.  

The feeling of my entire body burning flooded my senses. I almost passed out from the pain. My brain still set on hitting him. I needed to get to my partner. Nothing else mattered. Not the pain or the spell he just tossed out. My hand never stopped as it arched out to connect to his jaw. Something between us snapped and the fiery pain disappeared the moment my fist made contact.   

He got knocked over as we both crashed down to the ground. Ancaer broke through the rest of the spells and traps to pin down Klein with one foot before he stood back up. All of us were breathing hard from the quick exchange. My shoulder burned from where he placed the charm, but no lasting damage had been done.  

“I need to bring her back! Just let me do it! It’s my partner, I have to-”  

Klein started his defense when Ancaer rudely kicked his face to knock him out. No wonder why he’d been so desperate. If Nick died, I didn’t know what I would do. I wanted to run over to him, but Ancaer stopped me by grabbing a hold of my shoulder to look at the damage. His face looked as if he knew something I didn’t.  

“You should be dead.” He commented. Voice shocked.  

“What do you mean?” I asked, not following.   

The charm that hit me was just a weak spell, right? If it wasn’t, I should still be on fire. I wasn’t something special and hadn’t picked up anything to break spells.  

“You may be too dim to understand how magic works. Aside from using words to direct what it needs to do, we require the intention, or willpower to put into the spells. There has been a theory that one could break through magic if their intentions were stronger than the one who made the spell. I’ve never seen such a thing before. I believe you got lucky. Do not rely on such a thing happening again.”  

I listened to him as he found some rope to wrap the knocked-out agent to bring him in later. He found a sheet to cover the woman up, showing respect I didn’t know he possessed. I never would have thought I’d done something overly special. I just wanted to save my partner, the same as Klein. I knew Nick would forgive him for the kidnapping and my anger slowly faded. With that all sorted, I finally went over to check on Nick.   

His bare chest red and badly sunburned from being in the direct sunlight for so many days. The pale tattoos showed up on the burned skin clearly. I lifted the white cloth from his face to find his lips cracked and cheeks sunburned. He’d been cooking in the glass coffin for so long. I wished I called Aberash sooner to find him.  

I started to lift him out of the glass, but Ancaer stopped me. 

“Do not move him yet. This is made of magic. As long as he remains inside, he’ll be asleep. Unless the spell is broken, he’ll remain asleep forever.” He explained.  

“Didn’t Snow White have a coffin like this?” I asked thinking back to the movie I’d watched when I was very young.  

“You’ve heard of the type of coffin before?” Ancaer said, looking down puzzled.  

I shook my head not wanting to correct him. Snow White woke up after being kissed by a handsome prince, right? Or was that sleeping beauty? I cared about Nickie but I wasn’t going to kiss him. That left one person to do it. Ancaer noticed how stiff I’d gotten from the idea. He waved off my ridiculous unspoken expectation.  

“Just kiss his forehead so we can leave. He is weak after having so much blood removed and needs to heal somewhere out of the sun.”  

He turned away to give us some privacy. Having him looking the other way felt more embarrassing, as if I was about to do something that shouldn’t be seen. My face about as red as Nick’s when I leaned over to kiss his hot forehead. He stirred a little showing the magic wore off, but still far too weak to wake up. Ancaer went to work, wrapped him in his jacket and put my limp partner in my arms so we could take him home. Nick was only a bit taller than myself but heavy as hell. I buckled under his weight, fully expecting Ancaer to take over.  

“He is your partner. You carry him.” He said gruffly and started to walk away while carrying Klein, limp under his arm.   

We needed to leave the other body behind, along with the animals chattering away. With some trouble, I got Nick to my back. We looked silly as I moved slowly, his feet dragging along with each step. This was my punishment for refusing to back down and keep going while risking my life. Ancaer led the way, pausing every few steps for us to catch up as if he was on an NPC leading quest. My burned shoulder throbbed and my face dripped with sweat. I would never forgive him for making us look this foolish.  

I’d gotten hallway through the cave when pity was given. Walking over, he lifted Nick up with one hand to place on his shoulder. I panted, hands on my knees about to pass out from heat and effort.  

“I thought...” I started.  

“He is my agent. I can do this much. Besides, isn’t your special talent accepting help from others?”  

He rightfully shoved what I said to him back into my face. At that moment if he hadn’t taken over, he would have ended up carrying all three of us out. I was never so thankful to see the sea as when we left the cave behind. Aberash waited for us. All the footprints in the sand showed she’d been there for a bit.  

“Let me see him!” She quickly took over taking care of Nick.  

I collapsed in the sand, letting the warm water lap at my legs. Now that Nick was safe, I wanted nothing more than to take a nap. Aberash said she wanted to take Nick back on the boat, but it couldn’t carry all of us. So, I got left behind with Ancaer. He started to draw a circle in the sand to leave. I expected he would to take me with him but he rudely refused. He only planned on taking Klein back.  

“If you want to leave, wait for Aberash to come back, learn magic, or swim.”  

He was really impossible to get along with.  I accepted waiting for Aberash to come back for me. As Ancaer stood in the transportation circle, he adjusted Klein on his shoulder. Without looking over, I thought I heard him say my name. 

“Did you say something?” I asked him, sounding tired. 

While still not looking over, he said something that made me choke on air. 

“I am sorry for your gender.” Ancaer said awkwardly. 

Just before his body fully sank down into the circle, I responded. 

“Thanks for the effort, but you really need to work on speaking with people.” 

He gave a growl and was gone to make me wait for Aberash to come back to get me off that small island in the middle of the sea.  

She checked us in to a resort. My room next to Nick’s. Aside from the blood loss and the bad sunburns he was alright. They still wanted him to rest for three days and she suggested I stay at the resort with him for that amount of time as well.  I’ve never been in such a nice place before. She called it a mini vacation but I really didn’t feel relaxed enough to call it one. I bought some new clothing and felt ready to sleep the rest of the day when she dropped the news that she would be staying until the next morning as well. That meant we could go on a real date. She knew I needed to de-stress after everything, and couldn’t do anything for Nick besides let him rest.  

I got cleaned up and met her later that night. I wasn’t really into the date until she showed up. I felt very underdressed compared to her. She wore a simple golden dress with high heels that laced up her legs. Her neck was cluttered with extra jewelry and she laughed seeing my open-mouth expression. Aberash really was way out of my league. What she saw in someone like me a mystery.   

We found a very nice seafood place at the resort. We walked, her holding my arm as I told her about some cases she’d missed. Everyone stared at her as we sat down at a table. Right away she ordered a bottle of wine, saying the dinner could be claimed as a work expense and we could eat and drink whatever we wanted. I was too tense to finish off my salmon, or touch my drink. She laughed and was a joy to be around as she finished off plate after plate of crab legs. Not ones as long as her arm, but good enough. A food that would be messy for most to eat and yet she did so gracefully. Overall, the dinner felt like a dream. I was on a resort next to a beach that overlooked the ocean with the person I’d fallen in love with at first sight. Any second things might come crashing down. And yet they didn’t.  

We walked arm in arm again, back to our rooms. I stopped in front of Nick’s room for a second, debating on if I should check on him, or stay with Aberash. She noticed and followed my line of sight.  

“Are you and Nick a thing?” She asked and it shocked me almost enough to fall over.  

“What?! Why would you-” I choked out.  

She laughed at the reaction.  

“People have been going around saying every time you call him Nickie it sounds like you're saying I love you.”  

My face grew red knowing people were talking about me behind my back and saying such things. Shaking my head, I couldn’t even speak.   

“It’s not like that.” I started to correct.  

Her eyes lit up, and she wrapped one arm around my neck. I wasn’t even aware of what she was doing when she drew in close to go for a kiss. I went from stunned to even more stunned. When she pulled away, she laughed again, smelling of wine. Taking my arm, Aberash took one step forwards nodding down the hallway.  

“My room is just a few doors down. I can spare a night.” She hinted not being subtle at all.  

I took one step with her. I knew what she was implying and God damn did I want to go with her. My feet stopped moving, eyes to the ground unable to speak up again. She noticed the mood shift and got in closer again. She put her hand on my cheek, worried she upset me in some way.  

“Hey, we don’t need to rush. Do you feel a little uncomfortable because...?” She hinted unsure of how to approach the topic.  

“No. It's not that. I just...” Looking her over, I knew how stupid I was being. 

I loved everything about her. From her laugh to how her eyes glittered. Even her habit of fidgeting with her necklaces. That was the problem. I loved her too much and she did not care the same amount. I could spend the night with her, that’s all. We were both too busy with our own lives and jobs to carry on a stable relationship. If I went through with this, I would expect much more which was unfair to her. 

“I'm more of a three-date kind of guy.” I said finally with a weak smile.  

That perfect smile came across her face. One more kiss was as far as we could go for now. And she wasn’t mad about it. We both needed to wait just a bit longer to get things sorted out to focus on each other.  

“If you change your mind, just knock on my door, alright?”  

I nodded, knowing my answer already. I watched her walk down the hallway and back into her room, Then I turned to go into mine, regretting my choice. In fact, I regretted it so badly I didn’t sleep. I ended up lying in bed, staring up at the dark ceiling. Sometimes screaming into my pillow over how dumb I acted. When I got up to get a glass of water, I pounded my head against the door frame again thinking how stupid I was being. When morning came, I left my room to check up on Nick. I saw Aberash pass by, she paused to say goodbye and how she needed to get back to work. The regret driving deeper into my heart as I saw her leave.  

I was trusted with Nick’s key to his room. I knocked, praying I wouldn’t walk in on him changing. When he didn’t answer I panicked a little. Opening the door, the room to see it empty caused my fear levels to spike. I would check the bathroom first, then freak out. The door open a little so I knocked again only to hear water shifting around.  

Inside the room, Nick sat in the tub up to his neck and with a wet cloth over his burned face. His knees were up, showing he wore his dress pants. His chest bare and still red.  

“Oh, Nickie, how long is that going to take to heal?” I asked as he moved his head a little to try and tell who just walked in.  

“About three days. My body is healing the blood loss first.” He said, raising the cloth from his mouth but not his eyes.  

Those sunburns looked nasty. Bottles of lotion for them were in the bedroom so he wouldn’t be in too much pain while he healed. I sat next to the tub, testing the water to find it freezing cold. At least he wasn’t bothered by the cold, but I worried it might make him sick. When he asked what happened, we both filled each other in. Klein submitted the odd disturbance case himself and asked for Nick to go with him. In the cave, he’d gotten the jump on Nick, knocking him out to try and use his blood to bring back his dead partner. We let silence overtake the conversation. Neither of us certain of how to feel about what happened.   

“Would you have just let him use your blood if he just asked?” I wondered out loud.  

“No. I have been used to bring back a person once before and have witnessed the outcome. It is not something I wish on anyone.” He said softly, eyes still covered.  

“What do you mean?” I asked, not understanding how getting a loved one back could be a bad thing.  

“I am not a perfect stone. They are... Not real. Alchemy is based on sacrifice. To create something that goes against that, is not Alchemy, it’s magic. And not even magic can bring back the dead. As far as I’ve heard, a perfect stone cannot bring the dead back but an unfinished stone is able to. In order to bring someone back, you must trade something of equal value. It is not as simple as a life to a life, but rather it must be that held the same importance for the person using the stone. If someone used a stone to bring a loved one back, they must sacrifice someone they loved just as much.” He said in a low tone.   

I let that information sink in. If Nick died, would there be anyone I could replace him with if given the chance? I knew how heavy the subject was for him. He took off the cloth and I could see how bad his face got burned. The peeling would be awful in a few days. He sank down a bit more in the cold water as he wanted to clean the air.  

“We’ll be here for three days at least. There is not much I can do right now. You should go on the beach, or do whatever people do in resorts.”   

I frowned, not liking that idea. It would be hard to enjoy myself while my partner suffered alone. He was right though. There wasn’t much I could do for him besides letting him rest. I’ve never been in a resort before and wasn’t sure what people even did. Swim? Drank on the beach? Nothing really appealed to me.   

“What’s your plan? Are you just going to sit in the tub all day?” I asked.   

“I think I’ll soak a shirt in that lotion and wear it later. My arms are too stiff to reach my back. The lotion may sink in after a few hours.”  

Oh, that sounded like a good idea. After what Aberash said about us, I don’t think I would ever be able explain myself if anyone found out I was rubbing lotion on my partner’s back. There were enough rumors about us without that fueling the fires.   

I agreed to try and make the best of the surprise vacation. I ensured Nick was fine on his own and he pretty much shooed me from the room. I didn’t bring anything to swim in. I didn’t feel like swimming though. I found a small store where I could buy a random mystery paperback in English. There was an empty chair on the beach from most of the tourists being too drunk from the night before to claim them so early in the morning.  

I made a huge mistake being talked into hanging out on the beach. I read for an hour or two, then started to drift off from not sleeping the night before. When I woke up, the sun was starting to get lower in the sky, and my book had dropped to the ground. I felt roasting hot and needed a drink right away. When I moved my sweaty legs off of the chair, my heart dropped.  

Being in the sun for most of the day without sunscreen caused my legs to match the burns Nick got. It already started to hurt walking around. Moving stiffly, I gathered up my things to head to the only place I knew that had a stash of lotion.  

I would never understand my partner. I let myself inside, finding him on the floor face down in a pillow. It was a risk of suffocating himself. But the white tile floor may feel cooler than the bed. I stole some of his lotion for my legs, and he only lifted his head long enough to see why someone came into his room. His eyes filled with pity, as he understood my pain.  

We didn’t talk. I just hung out on his bed with the T.V. on, not really understanding any of the shows. My legs burned and the lotion wasn’t doing enough. Frustrated from the past day, I sighed, letting some of my anger loose.  

“I swear, my legs are so hot you can fry an egg on them.” I groaned. 

Nick was burned much worse. And yet I started moaning to him about my legs. From where I was, I could see him lift his head to look over his shoulder.   

“Do you… really think so?” He asked slowly, considering if it was possible.  

One call to room service and a ruined egg later we answered that question.   

The next two days we just hung out in his room. I only left for meals or to buy a new book to read. His burns healed up without them peeling afterwards. He looked horrified that I told him my legs would peel soon. Since I did not bring my passport, we needed someone to pick us up to get home. Two agents set to meet us at a marketplace. Checking out, I realized resorts turned out to not be my thing.  

With some time before meeting the agents, we shopped. I let Nick out of my sight so I could buy a few things to bring back for everyone. It was pretty hard to say no to anyone at the marketplace. I found him through the crowd, ready to leave, my arms loaded with bags. Nick bought a lot less stuff than myself.  

In the sun I could see how nicely his face had healed. But he had also gained some freckles from being in the sun for so long. They were too damn cute and I ended up bothering him by pushing on his cheeks with both hands, mocking his new freckles as he just tolerated his dumb partner.  A pair of numbered agents walked over, looking back and forth at each other, trying to decide what kind of interaction they walked into.  

To bribe them to stay silent, I handed each a thin woven bracelet. Each man was excited over the gift. Just as we were about to be separated, Nick and I exchanged small gifts we bought for each other. We both bought the same beaded lizard keyring. A red one for myself because he thought it might remind me of Hot Sauce, and a pink one for him. I guessed it was his favorite color. I laughed when I saw we both bought the same thing for each other.   

Nick smiled fairly easily from the exchange. It was almost heartbreaking over how he’d gotten used to doing so.  A few months of working together had really changed him. Not too many other people noticed. Or maybe he wasn’t smiling around anyone else.  

I promised I would call him when I got home and he needed to do the same. I worried that he could be taken away again the moment he left my sight.  

That fear would stay in the back of my mind every time we weren’t near each other. He shared the same stress. We both went off doing such dangerous jobs to help others it risked our lives every time. When I got back home and alone, my hand went over the new scar on my stomach. I didn’t tell Nick that part, knowing how upset it would make him. I could only hope he never found out just how close to death I was that time around.  

I wondered why Ancaer turned out to be the one who came charging in for the rescue. I never got to ask if there was some sort of history between the two of them. Sending a message off to my partner knowing he got home safe, I showered, in a losing battle to get all the sand off. All that history and drama could be dealt with later.

I have loved to walk in nature ever since I was young. I live in one of the most beautiful parts of northern California in the Sierra Nevada’s. I make it a point to take advantage of the surroundings when I am not busy studying at my local University. Hiking became a therapeutic activity after the loss of my father. The scent of my region’s lake water and fresh air helped clear my mind and gave me a sense of peace. Completing those miles provided a healthy outlet. I am twenty five years old and hope to remain active for as long as I’m alive, which might be shorter than I care to think about.

I usually brought protein bars, a hydro-flask and a Glock with me on my hikes. My weapon gave me a sense of safety, even if my shooting skills were not as sharp as I would have wanted. I was resistant to the notion of carrying something lethal at first. The firearm was a recommendation to me by a friend. He saw a mountain lion on one of the trails I frequented. The footage he showed me of people eviscerated by the creatures persuaded me. The notion of meeting a giant feline hungry for human flesh was terrifying. Still, it did not deter me from exploring isolated areas off the beaten path. I had also read a news article about a meth lab raided in the upper woodland. It was a mere half mile from one of the spots I visited. The facility was ran by an infamous gang organization based out of the bay area. One day I searched for and found it. The laboratory had the entire county’s supply of caution tape around the perimeter after it had been busted. More armed Security than a military complex circled the building. A man with a badge made it clear I was unwelcome. The most unusual place I ever discovered was not the drug house, however. It was an abandoned church.  

I stumbled upon it by accident. I followed a road lined with cabins owned by rich vacationers. I passed rows of log-wood homes, piers, an art gallery and gift shop only open for two months in the summer. An outdoor amphitheater sat at the bottom of the shoreline of the precipice I strolled on. 

I took a left turn down a steep slope I had never traversed before. Patches of sharp branches left cuts on my arms. I persisted and hacked my way through it with a pocketknife. 

The church sat on a rocky outcropping. A cluster of pines seemed to bury the structure. Three taller buildings sat on the nearest cliff’s edge. They were background decorations to the smaller but much more noticeable worship hall. 

The structure was a single story v-shaped building and had an old coating of white and chipped paint. Broken stained glass windows revealed some disassembled and removed pews. 

The front had a large oak door with half of it missing, replaced with an old threadbare curtain. I pulled out my phone to take a snapshot of it, and saw I was in a dead zone.  

I approached it, swept it aside and made my way into the chapel. 

The main stage had a monolithic statue of Saint Francis of Assisi. The wounds from the nails and lance had splashes of old wine. A piano sat next to the towering sculpture, its keys rotted and loose. The place seemed as though it had been evacuated. 

I neared the cobweb draped lectern. The stand had an attached microphone. I tapped it to see if it was still on, or to find out if anyone had recently sermonized in such a dilapidated place. 

Feedback pierced the air. 

I heard something move behind me. I tried to look in the direction of the noise when my foot got caught on something. I looked down. 

My sneaker snagged on a loose floorboard. I tried to pull my leg up and lost my balance. The impact of the fall was worse than I could have anticipated. 

The ground gave way and my body fell through the platform. I am not a small person, but the weak foundation is what caused me to plummet. I was not unconscious but I did see stars. It took me a few minutes to collect myself. I stood up and dusted the splintered fragments off my clothing.   

I was in the basement. I observed a staircase which went even further into a subterranean cellar. I turned on the flashlight of my phone and descended. My inquisitiveness is what led me to take such an action. I have regretted it ever since. 

I found an entrance which would have been impassable without the input of a code on a digital keypad. 

It was not secure. I cracked it open with careful slowness in case someone was on the other side and went in. 

It was a laboratory. The smell of chlorine, old plastic, iodine and antibacterial soap greeted me. Beakers, vials, and shelves with grime-encrusted mason jars lined the chamber. Fibrous and stringy bits were in them. They were umbilical-like. 

A massive placard with the words *Dowling* *Ministries* hung on the furthermost wall. 

I heard footsteps above me. I did not want to face someone eager to protect their land from a stranger they interpreted as a threat. It did not take long for my curiosity to vanish. An overwhelming need to escape overtook me at the sound of a pair of shoes clattering. 

I turned around to leave. My eye caught a manila folder. A stack of papers were in it on the right hand side of a desk littered with pens and rusted tweezers.

The noise above me halted and I heard the steps get further away and echo until they disappeared. A wave of relief overcame me. I had to look in the documents to try and understand what was being done down there.

The title caught my attention. It was *Project Stigmata, or A Researcher’s Guide to Controlled Bloodletting*. I scanned the paperwork and saw redacted sentences. Scientific terms I only had an amateurish awareness of were everywhere. Cellular terminologies somebody with a degree in biotechnology might understand littered the paragraphs. 

One passage in particular did leap out at me, to the point where I took a snapshot of it. It read as follows:

‘We have an invisible airborne gas. It is capable of eliminating the protein factor IX, a type which helps blood clot in the average person. It would induce Hemopilia B, an ailment which makes even the most minor of cuts a dangerous event. With factor IX removed,  blood loss is inevitable. We have managed to isolate it within the bloodstream to specific parts of the body. We will use multipotent divisiveness dependent upon specific physiological conditions. This includes the wrists, each foot, the chest, and the upper abdomen. We must recommend Dowling invest in and patent medical infusion concentrates now. Hospitals around the world will have to administer them to provide temporary treatment. Our media allies will help push the message of how inexplicable the sudden outbreak is. The only people not susceptible will be those born with a hyper-efficient mutated F9 gene. They are uncommon. Word will spread on how the only individuals cured are those who attend our Sunday events. We will make the cure available to anyone who donates to Dowling and purchases the therapy. There will be a great loss of life to those who refuse to adapt to their new conditions. The success reaped by us will be immeasurable.’ 

It occurred to me what the goal of the writer was. 

They were going to unleash a disease upon humanity. It mirrored the effects of stigmata. It would be on droves of people countless in number. The religious organization had access to influential outlets. They would would capitalize on the suffering with their well-timed propaganda. Their goal was to make even atheists believe something apocalyptic was at play. 

It seemed so extreme to me. I did not believe it. Then I stared at the technology surrounding me. Nothing about the research area seemed primitive. Everything was clean and well kept. 

The containers with nothing in them seemed to be the most dangerous. The substance was allegedly undetectable.

I wanted to write it off as the rambling of someone on drugs. A delusional hermit who found solace in the forest. I flipped through the pages further. There were appendixes, foot notes, graphs, and charts with Latin phrasings. Everything seemed measured and calculated with stunning and academic-like acuity. 

A gunshot erupted behind me.

I turned around and saw a bearded priest running at me with a twelve gauge. I pulled out my Glock, ducked down into a crouched position behind one of the metal desks, and fired back. 

After I squeezed the trigger a few more times, I heard him flee up the stairs. As far as I could tell that was the only exit. Panic overtook me, but fight overcame the impossibility of running away. I stood up and kept firing at the staircase. I sprinted up onto the top level again and scanned the entire nave. No one else was there. 

Without thinking twice about it, I ran out through one of the busted windows. 

I saw a group standing on the edge of the property. A father, mother, and daughter were at the forefront. Behind them were at least twenty others. All wore white and stared at me with slack jawed expressions. Their eyes were devoid of emotion. 

The man of the trio pointed at me with a crooked finger, and he reached into his pocket for something. I did not want to find out what he planned to retrieve. 

I ran towards a slope and slid towards a meadow filled with dead grass at the bottom. Once I was on flat land, I sprinted until my sides hurt. I was near a shoreline, where I switched up the pace to a lighter jog. 

I came across a suburban neighborhood, where my cell service came back and I was able to get home. 

I never went back.  

\*

A month has passed since that day. I do not want to go to the authorities to report my findings because it would be self-incriminating. An admittance of trespassing is not on my to-do list.

I reflect on the experience at night. I sometimes re-read the snapshot of the document I took to verify that what happened was real. To comfort myself, I try and say how it was a wealthy person’s creative way of passing the time, albeit a very unhinged one. 

Then my inner critic says *you know that's not what it was*.

Hello, I (32M) answered a phone call that changed my life about a year ago. I know that happens all the time, but this phone call was different. Not your typical wrong number, scam, or marketing agency phone call. This person knew my name. It was actually bizarre. They knew details about me and my life. They knew that I had widowed at 26th old and have been single ever since. They even knew as far as my pets name. I have a golden retriever named Jack. The odd part was, I had no idea who the other person was. 

The day I received a call, it was an out of state call. I always answer my phone, because I run a small business of truck drivers and get out of state calls all the time. No big deal. I answered and on the other end of the phone was the sweetest voice I had ever heard. It’s almost as if I had been ill, her voice could’ve cured any illness I had. A young British lady on the other line asking for Abel. 

“This is Abel, how can I help you?” I replied. I half expected her to tell me where to drop my next load, but I just had a feeling this wasn’t that. She explained to me that she had been trying to get ahold of me because she needs to meet me in person. I asked her how she knew me and why she wanted to meet. She explained that we had had a conversation on a dating website about a few months back, and one day my profile had just disappeared. In all 32 years of my life, I have never had a dating profile. It just wasn’t my thing. After my wife had died, I was simply to heart broken to be able to pursue another relationship. “I’m sorry ma’am, I think you have the wrong Abel.” I felt really let down for a minute, I had kind of hoped that she was really calling for me. It’s been so long since I’ve had a woman’s interest. The line went dead. I was very confused, but I guess it was true. She had the wrong number. 

I went about the rest of my day, but I couldn’t get that phone call out of my head. It was short and sweet but so impactful. I have no idea why. Maybe it was because she said my name the way my wife use to say it. So sweet like and soft. Very comfortable, I must say. It’s been a long time since I’ve felt so at ease. Since my wife died, I have just felt so on edge with everything. Like I can’t relax. Almost like when she died, she took a piece of me with her. Jack has been my only relief since then. I love him dearly. Probably because he was my wife’s dog before she passed on. 

That night before bed, my phone rang a familiar number. My heart pounded before I answered the phone. “Hello?” I sounded like a bitch answering that call. It was someone from California telling me where I can pick up my next load. I sank back down onto my bed and sulked for the rest of the night. Why did I have such an attachment to this women from a 2 minute phone call? God what is wrong with me? Maybe I need to put myself back out there? Did I really miss a woman’s voice that much? Jesus. I feel desperate. 

A couple weeks went by and I had forgotten about the phone call, thankfully. I hadn’t slept for a few more nights after the initial phone call. I was super impacted by it for some reason. But it was over now. Things went back to normal. I never did end up putting myself back out there after that. It was too much for me. I needed therapy instead. I started seeing a therapist to discuss, and actually grieve my wife’s passing for once. It was nice. I even made sure it was a woman, that way I could get use to a woman’s voice speaking to me again. 

A month later, I get a phone call. “Abel? I’m sorry for the way our last phone call ended. I need to see you.” Oh my god, my heart nearly jumped out of my chest. It was that lady again. “Ma’am I apologize, but I ..” She stopped me in my tracks and told me her name was Ariel. I almost threw up at the sound of that. My late wife’s name was Ariel. I was physically too stunned to speak. What could I even say? For a second, I got really angry because I thought this was some kind of sick prank. “If you think it’s funny to prank call someone about their late wife, then you are sick in the head.” I admit, I exploded on this lady. I forgot how obsessed I was over that first simple phone call. I hung up. I couldn’t take that. After all the therapy, I thought I was ready to talk about my wife again, but hearing her name brought back every single memory I had with her. 

That night I went home and cried with my dog in my arms and I couldn’t get past the fact that someone would do such a horrible thing to me. I loved my wife so dearly, and it was awful when she died. I hate venting to Reddit about a past situation, but god I just can’t get over it.

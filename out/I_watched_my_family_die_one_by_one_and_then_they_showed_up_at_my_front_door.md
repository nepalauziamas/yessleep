My family died one by one, and then they showed up at my door. it all started a year ago when I woke up in the mid night to the most bone chilling scream I’ve heard in my life, followed by the most horrific sound of my mother being stabbed and gagging on her own blood. 


I immediately ran out of my room and saw my mothers body dis membered into 14 pieces, I stared into the eyes of her decapitated head and knew that this image would never leave my mind. I stood there completely numb and in shock.    


After about 15 minutes I worked up the courage to slowly walk back to my room, my eyes still wide open and expressionless from shock. I grabbed my phone that was in the charger and dialed 911. “911 what’s your emergency?” A middle aged sounding operator replied. “S-she’s dead” were the only words I could mutter out at the time. “Who’s dead sir?” “Mom” I replied in a cold expressionless tone. “Where is the location of this situation?” She asked.


 “12355 West Brody lane, Compton” I was able to muster the strength to say.  A wave of nausea and panic went over me as the realization that the killer was still inside of my house hit. I ran to my door and slammed it shut and locked it. At this point I was in full panic mode. I fell to my knees and started quivering and silently crying. 


What felt like forever later I heard the police sirens  and they pulled up to my house. They knocked down the front door and came in. They knocked on my door and I opened it and explained the situation to them.  They searched the entire house and found no one. They said they would stay with me until my father came home from work ( he works the night shift at the local gas station). 


all of a sudden another gutwrenching and bone chilling scream came from somewhere in the house, and it was from my brother. I ran out and saw police men looking at my brothers cut up body, during all of this I had totally forgotten about him.    


The police men were freaking out wondering how this happened with them in the house. They were panicking and searching everywhere, with their guns ready to fire. I heard the doorbell ring and assumed it was my father. I ran downstairs but the police men stopped me from answering the door due to that potentially being dangerous. 


A police man opened the door and there it was, my fathers cut up body. I stared at his decapitated head and his eyes were still moving. It was truly the most disturbing thing I had ever seen in my life. 3 of the police men said that I needed to come with them to get me out of there before I was next. I followed them outside, stepping over my fathers dismembered body parts and sat down in the back of the police car. 


They began driving and said they were going to take me to the station and would figure out what to do from there. 10 minutes later we were almost there, and that’s when I heard breathing from the trunk. I decided I would tap the police officers shoulder and whisper “the trunk” as quiet as I could. He immediately pulled over and opened my door, I tried to get out, but that’s when something grabbed me.   
 

It was a cold, large, slimy hand, it pulled me into the trunk, and All I could see were it’s blue eyes just before it punched me so hard I got knocked out. I woke up in a void of whiteness, my first thought was that I had passed away and gone to the afterlife, but I looked down and saw my body.     I felt my face and saw blood on my hand, and my face hurt like hell. 


That’s when the white void started turning into blackness, and then just like that, i woke up in my bed, in the morning. I immediately jumped out of bed and ran downstairs, and somehow, my family was there. My brother was sitting on the couch playing a StarWars video game, which I thought was weird because my brother always said hated StarWars.     


I walked in the kitchen and my mom was cooking eggs ,  but she was deathly allergic. “Mom?” I asked “what?” She said in an annoyed tone, which wasn’t like her. “Why are you cooking eggs?” I asked. “Why do you think, Einstein. I’m gonna eat them. Stop asking ridiculous questions, I’m not a morning person.” I was very disturbed at this point because my mom  always  woke up very early and talked about how she loved the morning a lot. “But mom don’t you always say you love the morning?” I asked in a concerned tone. “GO AWAY!” she yelled very angrily.


  I walked into the bathroom and looked at myself, my face was somehow fine. I didn’t trust my mom, there was something very wrong with her. I decided to walk upstairs and that’s when I heard it, banging coming from inside the walls.     I looked at the walls and my heart started beating fast, what the hell was going on? “HELP ME! “ I heard my mother’s voice say from the wall. “Mom?? What the hell! What’s going on?” I asked very concerned. 


“HES BACK! I HAVE TO GO! JUST KILL THEM! NOW!”  I turned around and saw my mom and brother standing idle like a video game character, staring deep into my eyes with a dark, terrifying, and cold expression. At this point I knew that I should trust what my mom said in the walls, I grabbed a knife from the kitchen and stabbed my “Mom” in the back, and I started cutting deeper, and that’s when the cotton came out.  


I pulled out the cotton and was extremely confused and scared. I decided to stab my brother as well, and cotton came out as well.  “MOM!” “WHERE ARE YOU?” I shouted. I ran to the part  of the wall my mother was screaming at me from, and started cutting it open, but nothing was there.  I started crying.     


I just wanted this bizarre and out of world scenario to be over, and that’s when I heard the doorbell ring. I was scared to open the door, but what else could I do. I opened the door  and saw the same white void from before, but there was a grey, disgusting, slimy trail. I decided to follow it, and what felt like forever  later it took me to a door. I decided to open it, and I got sucked into it. 


I plopped down on the floor of my house, but this time, it was my real house. I got up, and looked around my room. I opened my door and went into my moms room and saw her dismembered body parts again, but this time they were a skeleton.     I checked my brothers room and saw his dismembered skeleton aswell. I went downstairs and there were cobwebs  and my mothers plants on the windowsill were dead.  


I heard the doorbell ring again, and I opened it to see my dad, mom, and brother at the door with groceries in their hands. I’m going to continue my story if this experience soon.. I have to stop writing right now because  the next part of this story is where it gets crazy, and really freaks me out, so I need some time

So, my first post has gained an unexpected amount of attention. Everyone has especially been telling me I should get out of this job and are asking me why I’d stay. After the week that I’ve just had, I’m here to answer those questions and explain some more. Quick psa, Im typing this very quickly before I sleep. Ive had a tough day, you'll see why later in the post. Please be kind with the typos.

First, I want to say that they definitely picked me for a reason. I am curious to a dangerous level. I’m the person in a horror movie that goes *towards* the loud noise that you absolutely should not go towards. I know this, and I’m okay with this. Because so far in life, this curiosity has only got me into very *minor* issues. And the pros far outweigh the cons. It usually works more in my favour. So yes, I recognise my flaw, but I have no reason as of yet to actually stop.

Second, I received some questions asking about benefits and pay. They wanted to know if that was the reason I stayed. Or if at least it was something that made it more worth it. I’d say it definitely has its notable perks. The pay for example, is very good for this type of position. I won’t tell you the exact figures, but my position here is about equivalent to the pay a senior librarian would receive in any of the normal libraries. Another very handy benefit is a free gym membership to the gym here in town. I haven’t been yet, work has kept me on my toes, but I plan to check it out soon. As I said before, I’ve come to find a love for weight-lifting. Not only that, but in this job, keeping in shape is a major advantage.

I also receive free health checks every 3 months. This shocked me, even as someone who very rarely visits the doctors for anything at all. It’s something I’ll definitely be taking up. It makes me question if there’s something that they’ll be looking out for during the checks. There’s the usual retirement fund and injury compensation cover. If I die on the job there’s a huge sum that goes to my family and friends. To be fair that part is more unsettling than I thought it’d be. I read a bit more of the contract and there’s an unbelievably huge rate of hourly pay if I do overtime on the night shift. There’s sick pay too. I get paid 75% of my normal wage for a sick day. And it starts from the first day I’m off sick. I’d be more worried about contracting something from the place if there wasn’t so much money in it.

So yes, I’m aware I’m an idiot for giving the second day a shot, and you must especially think me one now that I’ve admitted to continuing to work for the full week. But you have to admit, these benefits are worth a try.

There are way too many unanswered questions here for me to just up and leave the place. I can’t truthfully say right now that if I left the job and went home that it wouldn’t be on my mind 24/7.

In good news, I’ve managed to majorly decrease the amount of times I make noise in the library. There are days where noises can’t be helped or situations that are out of our control occur. I even watched both Sun *and* Taalib have to run under a table and to a sound proof room on the second day. Unfortunately, watching them run meant I also caught a very clear view of the librarian. Needless to say, it wasn’t a figment of my imagination. And please, I swear I'm not crazy.

This *thing* looked dangerous. It was humanoid and had long arms and legs, but with huge pieces of skin that looked to make some kind of wings. They didn’t move like a bird though, they seemed to glide behind them with their arms spread out like nets. I’d hate to see it actually catch someone. It’s terrifying to watch that, I couldn’t move out of my spot for what felt like at least 15 minutes. I watched it as it clung to the door frame of the room, completely cover it and staying dead silent as it waited. It left after 15 seconds. Exactly 15 seconds. It wrapped its “wings” around itself and slowly strolled away. It looked… creepily human as it did this. It look like a bald woman with a long dress just casually taking a stroll through the library. The image that you’d expect when you say “librarian”.

The regulars who visit seem to have the method down to a T, never seeming to make any noise at all. Though one of them failed to check out whilst doing my third shift and I couldn’t find them anywhere. Sun told me not to worry about it, the night shift apparently have the job of searching for people lost in the library and they’ll update us the next day. It is a surpassingly big place. The next day I took the day off after seeing the Librarian for the first time - apparently a rule they have in place. And I’m extremely grateful for it. But I was informed that they were told to add the missing persons name to *the book*. I haven’t been told what the book is yet, but I’m determined to find out. You’d think in a place already as strange as this, there wouldn’t be any secrets. But apparently there are.

Another thing happened to me; something… new. It was on my last shift of the week after having a day off to recuperate. As I walked passed the gate outside of the library to head inside, I noticed a person standing next to the door. I tried to be pretty casual about it, though it was already weird enough that they were standing outside the building I’ve never seen anyone enter or exit at all, but what they were wearing certainly made it feel stranger. They wore a long cloak with a large hood covering most of their face. The whole outfit was white, and very bold compared to the dark brown bricks of the building.

Before I looked up to give a polite smile, they raised their hand in front of me. It startled me for a second before I registered what they asked. They asked me if I'd like a muffin, and sure enough there was one in the palm of their hand that was extended in front of me. For some reason, I had the intense feeling of dread - and my instincts screamed at me not to look at their face. So I didn’t and instead focused on their hand. They held a box of muffins. Now, I am a fiend for muffins, they are my guilty pleasure so I gratefully - and suspiciously - said thank you and accepted the gift. They began to walk away so I gave it a quick sniff and with no immediate reason to not eat it, I took a bite as I opened the door. (I know, okay? I'm an idiot.)

When I got to the staff canteen however, to put my bag away and get ready to work, I began to feel strange. The muffin was raised to my mouth for a second bite without even thinking about it. I didn’t want to eat it at all but I couldn’t help but continue to bite it. By the last bite I had just been shovelling it into my mouth, crumbs sprinkling everywhere and barely swallowing the stuff that was in my mouth already. I washed it down with some water and immediately let my bag fall to the floor and searched it for my lunchbox. I didn’t even notice Sun and Taalib until their shoes came into view in front of me. I blinked and looked up at them shocked, my mouth still open from where I had my sandwich raised to start eating it.

I calmly stood up again and wiped my knees. I apologised for my behaviour and said I didn’t know what came over me, I just felt particularly hungry and wanted something to eat before work. It wasn’t 100% true and looking back on it I wished I’d told them the whole truth. Though, I don’t think it would’ve stopped anything. When they left the room I ate all of my lunch. I managed to compose myself and go back out to work. I managed a couple of hours before I had to go back to the canteen. I’m not proud of it, but the hunger was so strong in that moment that I didn’t hesitate to go into the shared fridge and take Taalib’s lunch. I ate it all, the pain in my stomach still there. It felt like it was travelling in circles and nothing could satiate it. But I forced myself back out into the library.

Twice. Twice I had to run to a soundproof room because my stomach kept making these awful loud groans. I signed to Sun and Taalib that ill take an early lunch so I could try to stop the noises and they understood. But I kew the noises wouldn’t stop. I grabbed Sun’s lunch and ate through it quickly. I don’t even remember eating it, it was just gone. I felt unsatisfied, as though I hadn’t eaten anything for day. This is the part that gets weird. It’s embarrassing just to type out.

Out of the corner of my eye, I saw the hideous rug in the centre of the lounge area. It was a rug that had those weird worm looking tassels. It was ugly, but as soon as my eyes locked on to it, I ran towards it. And that’s how Sun and Taalib found me, 5 minutes later. I was on my hands and knees pulling the large red threads from the rug and stuffing them into my mouth. I don’t remember much after seeing their faces at the door. But they told me my eyes were red and my face was purple from barely being able to breathe between bites. They called the local doctor immediately, who apparently has worked alongside the library for years and made me drink some repulsive medicine. I threw up the lump stuck in my throat, like a cat would with a fur ball, and the pain in my stomach started to subside. They said I had to rest for at least 24 hours, which is perfect timing because I have two days off now.

I don’t know what that was, but Sun and Taalib are going to go around the library visitors and ask to see if anyone has come across that particular situation before. I’ll keep you updated. But turns out another benefit of working here is coverage for emergencies like this. It makes me wonder just how many occurrences like this happen.

But yeah, lessons I’ve learned from this week: it’s okay if you mess up occasionally, it keeps you on your toes. “The book” is full of names and night staff have access to that. Call the doctor if any strange illness occurs in the library. But most importantly, do *not* under any circumstance take muffins from strangers stood outside of the library doors.

So the big question still remains. Who else in this small town knows about what happens inside the old library? And why am I so drawn to the place?

I had an interesting time in Egypt. 

"You are the journalist, yes? I am Amir, and this is Eli." The two men shook my hand in turns.

"Josh, with PixiePages. Don't mind the outfit." I did my best to hide my embarrassment. *Why did he have to dress me like Indiana Jones?*

"There are no vampires. Do not bite them." Amir began, unamused.

"Do not read the hieroglyphics aloud," Eli added, making a throat cutting gesture with one hand.

The two then spoke in unison, stating "do **not** dance like an Egyptian!"

"Got it, got it. Let's just get this over with. One thing though, what about the vampires?" I probed. *Another mindfuck rule?*

"There are none. Do you listen?" Amir scoffed, shaking his head. Eli shook his too.

Without another word, they threw me a lantern, then made for the excavation site. Down the steady descent we went, until the uneven sand leveled off to smooth sandstone. It was too smooth, slick almost.

Just as we made it four or five steps, the ground shook. Chunks of ceiling fell, nearly splattering us. Diving forwards with a yelp, I thought we were in the clear. That relief was short lived.

"Aldampires!" Eli cried.

"Run!" Amir shouted, nearly leaving me in the dust.

"I can't see!" I cried, stumbling as I tried to keep up. Within that second, something clamped onto my wrist. My feet left the ground as I was ragdolled  like a flag through the air.

**SPP! SOOP!** Wet projectiles zipped at us. I winced as something pierced my calf.

"Huh?!" I grunted, a strange throbbing sensation spreading from where I had been hit.

"Amir, remove it." Eli ordered, steadying me. Sharp metal carved around where I'd been hit, removing whatever had latched on, plus some flesh around it.

"Ow!" I yelped. "What the hell guys?"

"Explain later. Keep your lantern off. Don't die." Amir huffed, a dim purple glow flashing with each breath.

**CRUICK! crRRR!** To the left, the wall began to crumble.

"Excellent work Amir!" Eli cheered, clearly more aware of what was going on than I was.

"Eli, I'm hit!" Amir cried.

The grip on my arm promptly loosened, as I was pitched like a frisbee. I am not ashamed to admit I screamed the whole way.

I bounced once. I bounced twice. Then I skid on the ground until finally coming to a stop.

"Impressive vocals, Josh. Now would you please shut up." Amir growled, pulling me to my feet and shutting me up.

"How can you see?" I demanded, tired of being in the dark. *Pun unintended.*

"Cursed blood. Is that really your concern right now?" Eli prodded, flicking me in the forehead.

"Gah fine, what now? Where are we?" I pressed, changing the subject.

"It seems to be some sort of intersection. We have three options. Pharaohs were buried in the west, though, so that's our best bet." Amir offered. Heavy footfalls disappeared off to the left.

"You heard the man," Eli snorted, striding off after Amir.

"Still can't see!" I called, holding my arms out to feel through the chamber.

I chased after the quickly fading footsteps, eager not to lose my way. Just as I thought I was catching up, I tripped. Throwing my hands forwards to catch myself, I never landed. "Ahh… there's no chance you're friendly?" I squeaked, holding my breath.

Dry, raspy laughter croaked in tesponse. Hundreds, no thousands of needles pierced my lower leg, turning it into an acupuncture pin cushion. 

"A swell sacrifice, yes." The enthusiastic acupuncturist giggled. The giggle was so agonizingly rough and gravely, I cringed.

"Help!" I screamed, praying to be rescued.

"How cute…" the acupuncturist jeered, stabbing needles through my other leg.

I clawed at the ground, desperately trying to escape. The smooth surface provided no purchase. I couldn't get away.

**PUOOH!** A brilliant, royal crimson flame erupted out of nowhere. The acupuncturist lit up instantly, for the first time showing me my assailant. And I saw my savior.

"Joshie, Joshie  Joshie. What shall we do with you?" The masked corpse tisked, snapping once and summoning dozens of arms.

An arm crushed the throat of the paper-thin thing that had attacked me. A dozen hands went to work plucking the pricks from my legs. I bit my lip beyond the point of bloody, unable to find an escape.

"As for your punishment… this will do…" Mephistopheles snickered maniacally, washing a flame over my swiss cheese legs. "No screaming, either." He placed one rotten finger over my lips, leaning close to my face.

Nearly passing out from the cauterization of my leg wounds, I fought to maintain consciousness.

"Now, ask your questions. I have something to deal with-" Mephistopheles hissed, as two hulking figures lunged out from the darkness.

I watched in awestruck horror as slash after slash removed chunks from the demon. Flame burst out in small spurts, turning the reddish-brown sandstone to glass on contact. Purplish goop shot from the brutes whenever Mephistopheles landed a scratch. The purple stuff sizzled wherever it landed.

"Job, Josh." Mephisto growled.

Through the chaos, I approached the paper person. "Hello… What are you?" I asked, improvising some questions.

"A mighty demidemon!" The acupuncturist boasted, flame climbing its legs.

"No you're not," I snorted,  enjoying the rule of disagreeing for the first time. I did not enjoy how it responded.

A fresh wave of needles pierced from head to toe, sending me numbly to the ground.

"Idiot!" Three voices shouted, followed by more hands sprouting and plucking the needles from me.

"Why are you here?" I asked, quickly scrawling the answer as it came.

"We require sacrifices!" The paper person cried, desperately attempting to put out the fire.

Lastly, I asked "Are you dying?"

No answer came. The flames had taken the creature's life, leaving only ashes.

**"ENOUGH!"** Mephistopheles roared, tossing the two, who I realized were Eli and Amir, against the walls. Arms sprouted from behind them, imprisoning them where they landed. Purple smog escaped their inflated forms, returning them to their normal sizes. "As for you" Mephistopheles approached, with measured, thunderous steps.

I whimpered, gritting my teeth as orange, curious flames danced around me.

"I know, I'll be taking these." Mephistopheles peeled back the flesh from his index finger, then swiped across my eyes. In a single heartbeat, my eyelids were severed. I could not close my eyes anymore. "Now… Lift. My. Mask."

My heart pounded against my chest, not sure I could survive this. *Just what lay behind his mask. I did not want to know.*

"Here, I'll help you…" a rotten arm worked my own like a puppet, pushing the scaly purple mask upwards.

Tears welled at the corners of my eyes, dreading the hell I was about to enter.

—

A bustling city sprawled before me. I watched from the sky, an invisible specter overlooking the peaceful happenings. Horse-drawn carriages hauled goods and people alike through well-worn grooves in the cobble roads. One and two story huts lined the streets. Small as they were, they were homely, cozy things. A happy civilization, though prosperous and warm, had an ominous air to it.

I held my breath, waiting for the inevitable. The inevitable came.

**WAUOOH-POOOOOM!** black smoke billowed to the heavens, blotting out the sun. Ash rained like snow. The city was sent scrambling, though to little effect. It was all in vain.

Volcanic rock sprinkled down in destructive fury, decimating the city. Men and women and children alike had no hope, yet still they fled.

Through the screams and chaos, I saw something peculiar. Something that gave me the strength to hold on.

Among the fires and carnage, I saw people do all they could. Not only for themselves, but for each other. I saw compassion in that hell.

"No! No! **NO!**" Mephistopheles boomed, sounding increasingly unhinged. "How do you find hope in this hell!"

"I couldn't tell ya, honestly I wish I could obey and go quietly. Something inside of me just won't accept it" I sobbed, searching for absent answers.

"You killed Azazel, yet you continue to blabber about hope? How **DARE** you!" He screamed, backhanding me so hard my teeth chipped and my jaw shattered.

Blood gushed from my mouth, leaving me unable to speak. I curled into the fetal position, readying myself for another death.

I will spare you the details of hundreds of decomposing arms pulling me apart, and skip ahead to when I woke up.

"Whoo, what happened to you?" Sean nudged me from my spot on the ground. I was alive, laying outside of our office.

Through swollen lids I opened my eyes, looking up to Sean. It might have been my imagination or the numerous concussions, but he almost looked concerned. "Heyyy" I wheezed, jaw still throbbing.

"What happened to you-your face?!" Sean stifled a laugh, sounding unusually genuine. "Sorry." He apologized, crouching at my side.

"Mephist-" I started, only to be cut off.

"Oh, yup. Got it. What's with those-huh?!" He gasped, stumbling backwards onto his ass.

"What are those what?" I groaned, too exhausted to raise a single limb.

"He cursed you-" his voice broke, abject dread on his face.

I forced myself upright, ignoring the pains and aches of my body. "I've gotta go back to hell."

"You look like you've been through one already… er I guess a second one." Sean sighed, rubbing his temples.

"You have no idea…"

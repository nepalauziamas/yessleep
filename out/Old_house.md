I come from family of five , I am the oldest daughter (22) and have a younger brother and sister. I moved out four years ago and study abroad. My family recently moved to a new house in a more central area, leaving the house we have lived in for about 15 years behind. 
It was a beautiful house, it had three floors and an attic but was very old and quite broken so it was time for a new place. It was also a bit too big for the four of them since I have moved out. 

I went to visit the new place they live in now and was surprised that I didn’t miss our old house at all. They moved pretty spontaneously so I never actually got to say “goodbye” to the old house. Like I said, I did not miss the old house at all and this new place made me feel safer to be in compared to our previous house.

This is when I started thinking about some of the really strange things I heard and saw in my old house when I was younger. I blocked out these experiences for a long time because I was so scared. My heart is actually racing writing this and thinking about it makes me feel uneasy. 
I remember waking up sometimes to the sound of footsteps in the middle of the night. my room was on the top floor and so were my brother and sister’s rooms. My parents bedroom was on the ground floor, and I just know these weren’t my parents’ footsteps. The footsteps always sounded like someone was walking in circles, walking up and down the hallway. It couldn’t have been my parents because why would they do that and it couldn’t have been my siblings either because they were so little and the steps sounded heavy. It scared me so much but I never went to check and just locked my door always. 

Another weird thing I remember is my dog barking hysterically at night for no reason sometimes. We lived in an area with just a few other houses around us so it’s very quiet, especially at night. My dog would bark at the door in the middle of the night as if someone was outside. Just strange…
The weirdest thing I’ve experienced at that house was 2 years ago in the summer. I went out into the garden at night for a secret smoke, I never told them I smoked lol. Anyways, it was summer so I went out wearing my pyjama shorts that I would never wear out but i was in the garden alone at night so whatever I thought. I was in the back of the garden, already paranoid that my parents might hear or see me, when I hear the camera clicking sound of an android phone. It was really loud and definitely somewhere close to me… No one in my family has an android phone so it was someone there that I didn’t know.. Thinking about it really freaks me out. Did someone actually take a picture of me in my shorts at night? I fucking hope it was just a coincidence and some neighbour was in his garden at night taking a selfie or something. Probably not though:)
My mum just recently told me she also experienced some weird shit in that house, also hearing footsteps at night sometimes.

Anyways, I’m glad they moved out there was definitely something eerie about that house.

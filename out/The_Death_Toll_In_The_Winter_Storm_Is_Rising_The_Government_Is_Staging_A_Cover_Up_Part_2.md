" Though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I shall fear no evil; for thou art is with me".
-Psalm 23:4



Waking up from my stupor, I heard sirens coming along with the sound of loud engines rushing passed by the highway. I gaze upon them military vehicles and ambulance aliks as they bravely navigate through the ever expanding, ever thickening snow storm that's swallowing the entire area. Being overly-cautious for my safety, I marched at the opposite direction from where they're heading. People around me started walking fast-paced when they realize what's happening. It was all in a tensed situation where everybody was trying their best to keep their cool. 

There was a moment of silence. 

The pressure building up inside me was slowly going down by the second. All the gathered people were starting to sigh in relief until an explosion at the center happened. Now being at a 300m, this explosion was very loud, it made all people around me to run in panic. It was a mass hysteria. The sound of the explosion rebounded from the buildings around us so most of people assumed it was coming from above them and so many tried to get away as fast as they can from where they're standing at. 

Due to this, some debirs managed to land into people. 
Some either get their limbs torn-off by the impact, a person got hit in the head with a huge chunk of glass that sliced his head into two and the other one, was little girl who's feet was crushed by the the building  where she and her mom was taking shelter. 
I never saw her mom. Only her hand were sticking out near her little girl. 

The girl was screaming in agony, calling for her mom. But only shouts and panics muffled her voice. I tried to ran as fast to save her. Trust me I did but the moment I was 5 feet near her, a sharp piece of metal suddenly pierced her causing her screams to abruptly stop. 
She never got to close her eyes, she died instantly. 

I stood there for a while. I never knew what I could've done. Or if I could've arrived sooner I would have been able to save her. All I could do was clench my fist. 
Tears welling up in my eyes, turning my back on her. 
Taking the first step it felt like my heart was turning into pieces. But there's nothing I could do now.. I just ran. I ran far away just so I couldn't see her corpse staring right at me as I run away. 


I wish I could look back. 

But I didn't do it. 

I don't want to see anything anymore.. 



Sometime later, I arrived near at a phone boot. It's probably the last of it's kind. The sounds of violence and destruction still persists but became more muffled as I settled down to catch some air. Losing my balance due to being over fatigued, I fell flat on the snow. 
Trying to push myself to stand,  I move both of my arms forward pushing against the ground I still managed to lift myself up but it took me quite some time. Hearing another violent explosion, which gave me the inclination to hide for cover. But there weren't anywhere else to go. I was in the middle of a battlefield, if I took shelter on buildings, and I'm  not betting my chances in being crushed to death. 
 I was preparing run further away to save myself,L when I felt a massive earthquake that shook my entire being. The road in standing on rocked so hard, I lost balanced and broke my wrist when it took the fall. Sudden as it came, it settled down. 
But then the aftershock followed up. The earth felt like it's being pummeled by a massive hammer that led cracks a meter deep, sinkholes started forming along with the further collapse of buildings that rumbles down all over me. 

It was all insanity. I was going insane at that moment. I curled up into a ball, I started shaking and finally, went into shock. I just couldn't take it anymore. I didn't care if the phone booth next to me almost landed on my head, the phone broke along with a single coin escaped and rolled over before stopping at my face. Everything doesn't seem to matter, my eyes welled up seeing the coin. 

 One, twice, thrice.. the after shocked waa ongoing, it lasted longer than it was supposed to and for the last time, finally, it stopped. 

A loud roar came from above and everywhere. The echoes of made it much worse. Ever heard a lion  inside a cave? It was foreboding, ominous even. You don't know where that lion is, but you know it's in the same cave as you are. 

Clearly shaken up, but slightly feeling a little bit better. I felt numb all over my body. After all that's happened,  all I  think about now is home. 


Scanning over the surrounding area, looking f to find that son of a dam that ruined me. I look up to pinpoint where the sound was coming from. 

There it was. I saw it. It's beyond me what happens next. 

Thick clouds of grey ashes appeared beyond the center area surrounded by the ruins of many buildings and leaning skyscrapers. The cloud swirled around and over on top at the center, slowly landing on the ground. It continues to swirl around while thunder sprites began to creat a temporal lighting giving depth to it. A vision to what's inside. 

 A hundred fifty meter-high shadow appeared briefly as lightning continues to light it the clouds. 

Realizing something was wrong I stared really carefully at the thing. And soon there it was. I saw it 

The size of it was nothing I've ever seen. It was phenomenal. if I could just ignore all the destruction that has ever Happened. Maybe if I was watching it on TV, maybe I could've appreciated freak show a little more. 

Staring at the clouds, and looking at what's peeking out. I'm trying to make out rough shape of it. A red glowing orb peeked out from the cloud and all of the sudden I was drawn to it. There my vision turned black while I felt my body was levitating up into space. Visions of comets and asteroids landing on earth creating a massive white cloud of engulfed the entire world. The earth or I assume a planet that looked like ours was completely covered with white ashes no matter where I look. The next scene was Gigantic beasts of unknown origins suddenly rose up beneath the earth. I was in awe by this development, I knew by then that I was lucid. I was aware of my surroundings and I was dreaming. Lost in wonder about why was I dreaming about this. I mean, it could've been a monkey riding a horse while firing a glock all over the place, but somehow, I felt a connection with it. 
My daydream was abruptly disturbed when a beast with huge red eyes suddenly showed up at my face, instantly waking me up. 

I felt like waking up from a trance. 
And I never knew how much time has passed since then. 
The next thing I knew, it was when the clouds were already dissipating next to nothing. 

There, at full view, I saw a red-eyed monstrosity with two large horns the size of a school bus protruding out of it's head frill. Jagged teeth inhibits it's mouth and It's wings span beyond meters  I could comprehend. They were attached to it's arm like what a bat wing does. Huge claws that comes along with it. The huge monstrosity is bipedal and stood tall almost at the height of a skyscraper. 


Now, I'm standing here just staring at this beast. I was feeling like I was back in that trance again, but this time I was awake and I couldn't move. I tried moving my body but to no avail. I was trying my best shaking myself even trying to move my toes didn't help. 

The beast raised it's head to look up in the sky, curious. 
But then it's eyes ended up befalling on me. 
My heart sank on the spot. 

I tried to scream at the top of my lungs but there was no coming out. 
*N-n-no, God please, Don't make this real*
*This isn't real.*
This isn't-

*sigh*

It's real alright. 



I tried to look away.. Really, I tried but I was paralyzed. I was stuck in place. My eyes were fixed in place.

 It looked as if Armageddon was just around the corner. Glaring at me, ready to pounce any second and swallow me in total darkness. 

Raising one of it's feet, the creature started taking strides towards me. A stomp of it's feet can be strongly felt even at this far. (700m)
Buildings upon buildings, and cars alike gets crushed by the passing of this creature. 

My heart is beating up and down at this moment when it slightly lifts it's head and roared the second time. The roar reverberated through the air as it shook my paralyzed body once more. 


Suddenly, I managed to jump on my feet as I regained control on my body  and started running as far as I could from this hell. I ran straight ahead never stopping. 

. Gasping for air, the humidity was so thick it was affecting my breathing. My legs sunk within 2 feet deep beneath the thick snow. I didn't realized that the whole street is now completely buried in snow making it impossible, just impossible to get escape. I only managed to get away a few meters from where I was and now my lungs are already giving out. 
Huge adrenaline kicking, it's do or die. Do or die goddammit!


Despite the adrenaline coursing my veins, it's only a matter of time before I feel severly fatigued. I stare straight at the road ahead, my vision starts to blurr out.. Slowly I blinked twice, I was losing  consciousness due to everything that's happening.. Then I blacked out, the surging footsteps getting muffled, my sight entirely covered in black and all sound came to silence. 

My world slowly eluded away from consciousness. The white winter world that I saw has met the darkness. 

I slowly close my eyes void of everything but the alluring sense of sleep.

'1300 Hours Before the Winter Storm' 
*Tick* *Tack* *Tick* *Tack*
The sound of a dialogue clock ticking counting down the seconds before the start of the end. 


June 11, 2021
Professor Adam Turner of XXXXXX University, XXXXX XXXXXXXX
 ST. George Avenue, XXX XXXXXX 


I'm currently writing this down to keep records upon witnessing a phenomenan that's been detected by our radar system. I'm Adam Turner, a Physicist, Climetologist and I've been monitoring atmospheric pressure, weather changes and cloud behavior that maybe affected by climate change all through out the state I'm appointed to. 


Not the actual thing that you see on TV like a weather forecast. 

No, far from it. For 4 years now, I've left the university I used to teach as a Professor in Physics. I decided upon myself to transfer into another career in my life. I wasn't happy in this sort of company.

 Not because I needed higher pay but... I'm just tired of the stale,  montonous lifestyle that I got so accustomed of. I dreamt of doing something, discovering many things I've yet to uncover in the natural world of Physics. 

I need to think of a way out rather than slowly rot in this cage of a lifestyle.  One year of job search and walk-ins later, I found what I was looking for. After browsing relative job searches in the dark web, I found a rather peculiar website. It's not about the name but above all the searches that was colored blue.. This one was colored red. Like why would anyone would go through the trouble of changing Color of the search engine's results on a specific. I have a background on web development, even I couldn't pull that off. Hats-off to this guy, he gets a Physicist. 

The site is called
www.(redacted)Jobs. org
When I pressed click, 
 A recruitment panel board showed up. 

It is quite disturbing... There's only black screen except search bar at the center with two words in red color that said "Submit Application". 
No matter how cliche it seems, the page still managed to creep me out.

Having a lot of skepticism I decided to close my laptop. I was about to close the lid but then I asked myself. Am I happy right now? 
I was really trying not to do irreversible decisions here. But think as I might, curiosity still gotten the best of me. 

And so I did it. I submitted my information, there's nothing going back. Just that everyone on the dark web might now contain all of my private information. Name, age, location, previous occupation.. everything. 


Despite all of that.
I still did it 

 No regrets.

  There's no text or verbal confirmation nor any video scheduled for interview. I had to basically just upload mu resume and then it's done. Months later, I received an email that contains the letter that changed my life forever. 

Covered in black background,  white elegsnt vines entangled the the frames. Then I look at the header that says:

"Welcome to Rozenheim". 

3 years has passed since then. 

Working at Rozenheim, I never felt much more alive. Technologies so advanced with a budget that made Exxx Xxxx looked like an Uber driver. 

Materials that were secret in public was a regular here. 
Most of Rozenheim technology are kept in confidentiality and the efforts to keep it private to the public eye is strictly mandated. 

I do however would like to write it nonetheless. 
One example of their technological inventions are carbon-based nanobots capable of shape shifting by remote l-based shape memory... I've never seen anything like this before being a Researcher here  has opened my eyes to a whole new word. 

But what exactly is Rozenheim?
 And what does it do? 
What does... it actually do? 
*Chuckles*


Well for publicity, it guided itself as a German company that's located branch near the border of XXX XXXX to develop artificial intelligence and flight engines & plane 'extensions'. Radars attached on top of it's 20 story-building to track weather and make a basal statistics from the data acquired will be key factors developing a much more sustainable, and much more advanced self automated planes. Or that's what atleast is publicly announced by Rozenheim. 


What the public doesn't know is that, we're actually developing more than planes. We are actually developing remote harbingers of death drome, stealth bombers. Planes that are capable of displaying mass destruction wherever it goes. The fastest, undetectable, unmanned plane called "(redacted) 23 (redacted)" I have to sign a bunch of NDA's just to get access from these things. 


 More specifically, Remote-AI operated stealth bombers but with a little bit of a "twist" . Why? Because the American government asked for it. China has developed a new stealth bomber " Xian H-20" that's all carbon based materials operated by remote manual or A.I. With the current development of A.I.'s in this date and time, it has the capacity to anticipate, make accurate judgment to launch and neutralize a target location and conjure-up total annihilation on a scale of a city. They can deploy anywhere around the globe if needed be, and effectively without the risk of being compromised. The Pentagon released a footage of Chinese carrier launching their elusive stealth bomber for a test flight just months before the pandemic. By all means, the government of the United States is also making it's move of producing another Monarch of the skies. 


And that's where my company comes from. Being funded by Americans, the company 'Rozenheim' started initiated the project called.. "Project X01" 
Or so that's what was briefly discussed to us. To my colleagues knowledge, as far as this project goes, experts fromm all different branches of science were working for decades on this project. They also... mentioned another  project that's entirely shrouded in secrecy. An ominous one. The type of projects wherein people disappear to prevent anything from leaking out information. Sh*t just got real and I'm getting abit unnerved writing it on my journal. Looking back, I really had any talent or anything that makes me stand out. 

For God's sakes! 
 I'll write it regardless. 

The project is called "Project Blackhole". 




I just hope my seniors colleagues wouldn't find this post. I-I just hope they won't.

'900 Hours Before the Winter Storm"

Professor Adam Turner of XXXXXX University, South Carolina 
(redacted) St. 7 th Floor, Rozenheim Building, (redacted) City, XXX XXXXXX 


Project X01 - 
We just received full authorization on these' new' materials that the company required to further further development of the project. Of course with abit of monitoring from government representatives as a condition. These things you see, are known to "NOT EXIST" just yet. 
I've never ever seen anything like it. A dark spherical  object with what I assume a special kind alloy. At a closer inspection , the sphere seems it's actively absorbing light as if it was thirst of radiance. 


Astonished, I tried getting a reaction from it. using my hand when all of the sudden-

"You don't want to touch that. You'll be feeding it your hand to it". 
 Surprised by the mysterious man with what he said, I unconsciously retrieve my hand from the dark object. I turned around and see a middle aged man 5'8 ft tall with a lean physique but underneath I assume is muscular, a clean shaven face.

 He bore a hole at the back of my head as he was staring right behind me. Turning my head to face him, he introduced himself. 

" Lt. Coronel Maxwell " holding his hand behind without ever showing any sign gesture for a handshake 
" Adam Turner, Radar Specialist". 
"I believe we never-" 
I was trying to establish a casual conversation but then i was cut off by him. 

"Why are you here?"  Ask the the Lt. Cornel. 
Slightly offended, I did tried to answer his question without showing any signs of annoyance. 
"One of the scientists conducting the R&D section summoned me for a briefing. I ju-" Then he cut off again. 
"Never mind. Just don't touch that thing right there." He looked at me straight in the eye and pointed his finger towards the spherical object. 
"I don't understand, what is it Coronel.?" I stuttered at the notion of asking questions from him as I felt I shouldn't have. 

"It's Lt. Coronel" He reminded. 
"You want to know IT? Well sure, but I have to kill you first" 
"You'll see what it can do." Grinning ear to ear, he stared at me for quite some time before landing his eyes on the object. 
He glared at it menacingly. Clearly, it was unsettling.

*Present*
-100 Hours Since the  Winter Storm 
Somewhere in the middle of XXX XXXX City


A sharp piercing sound, passing through raging winds coming from  south. One, two, three dark bird like objects gliding  through heading  towards the giant creature as I regained my consciousness.
My face was buried in the snow for quite some time, my cheeks are seared in pain from the frost bite, my long unkempt beard, completely frozen in place. I felt vomiting because I was cold and famished. 

Putting both hands on my knees, I closed my eyes for a moment.. 
I just stood there, recollecting everything that's happened. But then I realized something. The beast was heading right towards me earlier. 
I suddenly shifted my head into the direction of the creature. 
Just a few meters away from me, I saw two massive reptile feet standing up front. Bewildered, I instinctively looked up and saw this giant creature staring at me. Curiously, as if deciding what it wants to do to me. 

I stared in awe for the size of this creature up close. It was like witnessing a triceratops that walks on two legs that has wings! 

I've never seen like it. A large mass that is alike to a lizard in armor. It's surface colored in light brownish scales. Cold plumes of smoke coming out from it's beak-like mouth. Terror held me in place, when suddenly a strong gust of winds came from behind me. 


 As the strong winds continues to pierce my body, I heard this loud noise. It wasn't the monster, but something otherworldly. 
It was small at first. But slowly increasing in mass. It sounds like, as if air was being suck rapidly.. or as if the earth itself is being devoured. The air made whizzing sound similar to a strong vacuum sipping out all of the air from space. 



A Massive Black Hole appeared in the middle of the City as it stretches vertically up to the size of skycrappers near it. Then as sudden as it appeared, it rapidly sucked everything in it's core.


Now an even louder roar erupted from the monster as it slowly getting dragged back  by the gigantic hole/portal call it what even. Loud as it was defeaning. 
I gasped for air. I swallowed my hard as if I was choking, I watched the scene with anticipation, but soon I realized that it's not just the collosal being  getting sucked. Buildings, asphalt on roads, cars, the air, everything is getting sucked by the hole. 

 And much my dismay, I'm getting shucked in as well.
I shouted on top of my lungs as I was pulled closer by the beast and the hole. Getting closer and closer by the creature, It opens it's mouth apprehending to catch me with it while resisting the strong current pulling it. 

But I wouldn't let it. I wasn't giving up. Now floating in the air as a glide towards the thing. Both of my hands landed on a traffic pole. I grabbed it as hard as I could and would never let go. 
I close my eyes in anticipation that it would be over soon. 


But it didn't. It just turned in for the worse. 


The cement on the floor that was holding the pole where I'm at came loose. One by one, slabs of different  sizes flew up and the pole started  get pulled in. 
Finally, it came loose and I was pulled in once again. 

Air lifted me into the air and brought me very close to the creature.
I didn't anticipate this ever happening. I was a matter of fact coming close to my end. 
 Ready to accept my fate, I closed my eyes.. 
As... slowly.. my life flashes before me once more.

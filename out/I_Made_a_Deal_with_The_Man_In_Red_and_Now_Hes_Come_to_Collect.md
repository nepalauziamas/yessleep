 

The cool breeze, rustling reeds, and croaking toads still live vividly in my mind after that night. Even after all these years, there’s something about those sensations that just sits in you after you first encounter them. Each instance after the first is like opening a door that leads into all your most treasured childhood experiences and the nostalgia of it all was almost enough to offset my panic on that late July evening. For a moment, I nearly forgot that I was stranded on the side of the road with nothing but a dead engine, a cell with no service, and a suitcase full of junk. The misfire of my car had been abrupt and its failure total. That steel carriage had been my ticket to freedom, at a time when I was desperate to escape from a hopeless life, and now it was gone. I hadn’t a clue on what to do.

&#x200B;

That was when I saw a pair of headlights growing steadily closer from up the road. They slowed, and as they drew closer I could hear the sound of a car window lowering. As the vehicle came to a stop, scarcely a few feet from my own, I heard a voice call out from within it.

&#x200B;

“Judging from that Li’l pillar of smoke you’ve got going there, I’m gonna guess that you’ve run into some engine trouble friend. I’m no mechanic, but I’d be up for giving you a lift to the next town if that suits you.” The words came quickly from the man, who was still obscured by the light of his car. If you heard him speak, it would give you the sense that the whole thing was rehearsed and even after all this time I remember that it made me uneasy.

&#x200B;

“Um, that would be great and all, but it’s not too cold out tonight. I might just call a tow truck. Thanks anyways though.” I don’t doubt for a second now that my suspicions toward the man must have been audibly apparent.

&#x200B;

“If you call a tow truck all the way out here they’ll charge you an arm and a leg for it. Besides, I really don’t mind giving you a lift.”

&#x200B;

“That’s really nice of you, but I have cash to spare, and I’d really rather professional help.”

&#x200B;

“Well even if you’ve got the cash you probably won’t be able to reach them out here anyways. This area is notorious for its bad cell reception. As for your preference for professional service, I happen to consider myself a professional. I help people like you out of situations like this for a living, so you’re in perfectly capable hands.”

&#x200B;

I was starting to feel my conviction waiver. My initial instinct had been to get this guy to leave me alone and wait for another vehicle driven by somebody less interested, though still willing, to give me a ride, but this guy just didn’t seem to want to leave me alone. Every reason he gave for being a valid point of exit from this unexpected stop was just as much a reason to reject his offer. Maybe I was just being paranoid, but it was two in the morning and he was being way too chipper for a night driver. However, he did manage to sway my decision in his favor, which is something I regret to this day.

&#x200B;

“So are you coming or not? If you’re staying I’d suggest getting back in your car and locking the door. Things far bigger, and far worse, than the bugs will bite you out here if you stay out in the night.” There was a growing sense of tension, or maybe aggression, in his voice. I couldn’t be sure then which one it was.

&#x200B;

I looked back to my car, pondering my refusal, when I saw something. Two glowing yellow orbs, symmetrical, and with vertical black slits, floating in the reeds. Large and leering, they were more than enough to put me into panic mode. Though my own car may have been closer than the strangers, his was further from the eyes and mine was spaced evenly between myself and their ominous presence. Making a snap decision I ran for the voice beyond the headlights and the pearlescent white car that held it. Hearing a roar not far behind me I reached for the passenger door, and seeing its lock pin on the  windowsill lift, I pulled it open. Jumping inside I slammed the door behind me, and hearing the locks click shut, I let out a gasp. I was safe now, perhaps.

&#x200B;

Relaxing from my tense state, I took a moment to look around the car. Fresh leather upholstery, spotless paneling, and shining dials all adorned the interior of the vehicle. The man himself was kept in no less of a pristine state than his car, with perfectly kept dark locks that cascaded down the sides of his head and found rest on the shoulders of a gleaming red suit. The color of his attire could have easily been seen as comical on any other man and yet the raw confidence and composure of this individual seemed to round all of that out. I definitely admired him longer than I should have, and he definitely noticed.

&#x200B;

“So where am I dropping you off at?” He grinned as he made eye contact, clearly amused by my lingering gaze.

&#x200B;

I blushed, embarrassed to have been caught in the act. “Um, anywhere within city limits should be fine. Some kind of hotel would be ideal?” I hadn’t thought this far ahead and it could be read through my delivery. The weather this month had been fantastic so far and up until very recently I had just been planning on sleeping in my car. I’d have found more permanent arrangements before winter of course. The car thing was really just a more temporary measure until I got myself settled, not that it mattered anymore.

&#x200B;

The rest of our ride carried out in silence, with me nervously eyeing my surroundings, and he diligently eyeing the road. The thought did occur to me that maybe I should feign some interest in the man. He had rescued me after all, and yet the temptation to close my eyes and ignore everything around me was growing far too great for that. It was so late, perhaps even closer to sunrise than sunset, and so I fell to my temptation. Choosing sleep as my amusement for the ride, I let myself rest in vulnerability within that strange man's car.

&#x200B;

It was early dawn when I woke. As I opened my eyes and wiped sleep from their lids with the back of my sleeve I came to see that we had parked in the lot of a low grade motel. It might not have been ideal, but given my financial situation it may have been the only thing I could afford. Had he known?

&#x200B;

“So, you’re finally awake then?” His voice carried the slightest tone of annoyance as he spoke to me. A sharp contrast to the sleek professionalism of the night before.

&#x200B;

“Huh? Yeah. Thanks for the ride. I really appreciate you helping me out last night.” Still stiff from my sleep, the words came out slurred. I reached for the door handle and pulled. It moved, but the door itself did not. I was locked in.

&#x200B;

“Leaving so soon? We haven’t even talked about my compensation yet.” A smile began to form on his face, ear to ear, and as I looked into his eyes I felt myself grow pale. It was as if I were his dinner and he hadn’t eaten for a week.

&#x200B;

“Compensation?”

&#x200B;

Why yes! I am a professional after all. You didn’t really plan on leaving without paying me what I’m due did you?” His voice and expressions were swelling with a frenzied excitement.

&#x200B;

“You never mentioned that last night! I’ve got next to no money, and if I pay you now I’m not going to be able to afford a place to sleep!”

&#x200B;

“Strange, you said last night that you had cash to spare, and I did mention that I was a professional. I really do think it’s quite rude of you to assume that I’d give free service , but I’m nice so I’ll compromise. All you have to do right now is sign this little piece of paperwork and we can go our separate ways, putting off the payment for a time. What do you say to that?”

&#x200B;

“All you need is my signature and you’ll let me go?”

&#x200B;

“Yes!” I can only describe the look on his face then as cheshire-esque.

&#x200B;

“Well alright then. Let’s see the papers.”

&#x200B;

“Only one paper actually. Just sign here.” The man reached into his gleaming red blazer and pulled out a single sheet of shining white paper. I took it, and as I did so he pointed to a single blank line marked *Signature* that rested under a wide body of text.

&#x200B;

Would this really be his only demand? He was clearly trying to extort me and yet all he was asking for was my name. No contact info, next of kin, or other personal information? How did this guy expect to follow up on whatever I was signing without that type of info? With all that in mind, and an eagerness to exit the situation, I grabbed a pen from the cup holder where it rested, and got ready to put this experience behind me. Hastily jotting my name down on the page, and then pushing it back into his hands, I got ready to make my exit. “Are we done here?” I snapped, ready to leap from the car at the next opportunity.

&#x200B;

“Yes we’re done here, for now. Have a nice life and keep in mind that if you don’t pay back what you owe within the next three years, your interest will be eightfold for each of the following.” He still bore that horrific smile as he pushed the lock button on the door controls and I heard a click that signaled my freedom. I leapt from the car and began running in earnest for the motel lobby. My future would await.

&#x200B;

Five years have passed since that night and in the time since I’ve rarely had a spare moment to ponder that man and the ride he took me on. Things started moving so fast when I met Claire that I scarcely had any time to think about it. We’d met roughly two months after the incident, at a furniture outlet, where I’d been looking for something to help hide the dinginess of my new apartment. Our carts had collided while we were both simultaneously going around the same corner from opposite ends and the awkward apologies that arose from that mishap eventually turned into awkward coffee. Which in turn became awkward lunch, cohabitation, and finally, marriage.

&#x200B;

Claire had always been the more assertive of the two of us, and so it was no surprise to either spouse that when we adopted Matthew she ended up becoming the primary breadwinner for the family. While I stayed home with our son, she'd be out at the office. This inevitably led to me becoming a certified master of changing diapers, but also revealed that I was completely inept at emotionally multitasking. So as I grew closer with our son, I gradually lost touch with my wife. Such problems  naturally grow into confused arguments, fights, or even tears if left untreated and that’s just what we did. I won’t say that she didn’t try, and I hope she’d spare me in the same way, but try as we might to make it to counseling, one of us always ended up missing the meeting.

&#x200B;

It had gotten to the point where we barely spoke anymore. It would be an occasion to remark on if we were to say more to each other in a day than “hello” as we passed each other in the hallway. About a week ago I decided I couldn’t bear it anymore, so I waited for her to come home from work and got ready to deliver an ultimatum.

&#x200B;

The moment is still vivid within my thoughts. Our front door swung open and the partner whom I’d shared the past five years of my life with  stumbled through the front door. She was carrying a briefcase, and her rain stained business attire clung heavily to her rigid form, still dripping from the sudden downpour that ambushed her outside. It looked like the heel on her left shoe had broken somewhat in her hurry to get out of the weather and as she went to put pressure on it her support from the thing completely gave out. She started to fall, and I dove in to catch her. As she fell into my arms Claire’s brow furrowed and she snapped at me.

&#x200B;

“I’m fine!” Her initial onset of words were abrasive in the way they delivered her response to my catch, but as our gazes lingered on each other her expression softened and she spoke more sullenly. “You can go back to whatever you were doing, instead of bothering with me.”

&#x200B;

“Actually, there’s something I need to talk to you about.” I choked the words out. You’d think it would be easier to talk to someone who you’d vowed to spend the rest of your life with, and yet the distance between our thoughts had made it so daunting.

&#x200B;

“Can it wait? I just got in the door and my feet are practically screaming for me to get in the shower.” I still remember how tired her voice was. She’d sounded like that for so long.

&#x200B;

“Okay, but we really can’t put this off. Promise me we’ll talk as soon as you’re done?” I’m sure she could hear me trembling in my words then.

&#x200B;

“Sure.” Having settled the conversation as efficiently as she could, Claire got her shoes off and started dripping her way towards the bathroom.

&#x200B;

For the following forty five minutes I sat in the kitchen and waited. Anticipation of our confrontation ultimately left me ill. I feared that doing anything to while the time away would produce a crack in my emotional defenses, so I did nothing. While I did nothing, the maelstrom of feelings festering inside me spread throughout my body and left me ultimately numb. It was in a way that can only arise from being wholly overwhelmed by yourself. Counting down the minutes will do that to a person I suppose. By the time she finally returned, hair and body wrapped only in towels, I’m sure my sickness must have been visible. You’d think that she might say something at the sight of such a thing and yet she passed me by, without so much as a glance, on her way to the sink. It stung me.

&#x200B;

“So what was it?” She casually tossed her words into the air without even turning to face me and continued filling the kettle that she held in her hand as if it were more important than this, than us.I didn’t know how to respond. Clearly she had no idea of what I was about to say and I hurriedly combed my mind to find the best possible way to start. Even so, in spite of my attempt to rummage up some gentle presentation for my feelings, I ultimately failed and went the most direct route possible with a “This isn’t working.”

&#x200B;

“What isn’t working?” She still hadn’t bothered to look at me.

&#x200B;

“We aren’t.” I just threw it out carelessly, maybe eager to get it over with.

&#x200B;

Claire stopped what she was doing , I heard the kettle fall out of her hand and clatter into the sink. Then she finally looked at me. “I don’t know about you, but I’m doing a shit ton of working. I’ve got enough on my plate without you trying to make things harder!”

&#x200B;

“That’s not what I meant!” I was visibly afraid then. Claire could get pretty scary if she thought you were saying something about her work ethic.

&#x200B;

“Then what did you mean?”

&#x200B;

“I meant that we never talk anymore. I meant that I never see you and when I do I could miss the moment if I blinked. What happened to us? I remember a time not too long ago when we knew each other's thoughts almost as well as our own and now I don’t know if I know you at all! I want to fix this, and I want to know you again!” That last bit about the knowing was roughly around the time when I lost control of the waterworks. You’d have thought it was raining if we weren’t indoors.

&#x200B;

“I…I don’t know how to do that. The way I’ve been working for the past year has had me feeling like I’m falling, and the further down I go the farther away you get.” Claire was crying too now, but in a much more dignified way. She was always the classier of us two.

&#x200B;

“I don’t know how either, but maybe we can really make time for someone who does? I’m tired of avoiding this. I’m tired of avoiding us.” I’d be impressed by anyone who could understand me through all of my sniffling and sobbing, so of course she did.

&#x200B;

“Yeah.” Claire was straining a smile through the tears. “Let’s make time for that. I can take a day off work and we can find Matthew a sitter. Where is Matty anyways?”

&#x200B;

“I put him to bed before you got home. Our son is out like a light right now.”

&#x200B;

“You’re so good with him. I don’t tell you that enough.”

&#x200B;

“You’re so good at providing for us. I don’t tell you that enough.” I took her into my arms then and we held each other amongst our sobs.

&#x200B;

We fell asleep in each other’s arms that night and the following morning we made plans to meet with a marriage counselor in two weeks time. I’d like to believe that it was the beginning of us turning things around, and I’d like to think that the talk we had was the beginning of the rest of our lives together. Unfortunately, I’ll never get to know what that would have been like.

&#x200B;

I got the call this morning and I’m still not sure if the news has had time to sink in. The person on the phone told me that Claire had been on the sidewalk near her work when she’d slipped on the concrete and fallen into oncoming traffic. They say that she died in the ambulance. An end like that is heart wrenching, but to most it would seem like something that could happen to anyone. I’d think so too if it weren’t for what I've heard from witnesses who've posted online. Someone  local to the area, who saw it happen described the primary suspect as driving a pearlescent white sedan, wearing a gleaming red blazer, and baring a crescent moon smile.

&#x200B;

If you're even stranded on the highway in the middle of the night, and someone matching his description offers you a ride, don't let him "help" you. It isn't worth it.

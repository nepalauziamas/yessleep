When I was 13 I was sleeping in my moms room while she was at work for a night shift. It was winter but still extremely warm inside. I refused to take the covers of as I still had that fear in my head of a monster from under the bed grabbing me and pulling me under to feast on my flesh. A really bright light was on in the room as I was scared of the dark. The TV was on playing my favourite cartoon. All the light and heat made it impossible to sleep but I refused to get up from my moms bed to turn off the light as I would of also been scared of the dark, or maybe even open a window, but no as the bugs that would fly into the room because of the light would pester all night .

I couldn't go to sleep. The only thing I waited for was the phone calls from my mom usually every 3 hours when her breaks were. Every time I managed to get some shut-eye I would wake up after 15-30 minutes. I was so tired but still my body just wouldn't go to sleep. So I laid there.

Eventually, I did go to sleep, for a good amount of time but I was woken up by a young girl screaming "HELP". She was running too and she wouldn't stop. But how was she still running but staying in one place at once? I knew that because if she was yelling for help and running then eventually she would run so far I wouldn't hear her but I still did. She wouldn't stop. I saw that 2 houses infront of mine had turned on the lights in their house as they must of been woken up by this little girl. I stayed under my covers very still not wanting to move. Its been minutes since the yells began and I didn't know what to do. All the thoughts in my head just zoomed past at once. I didn't know if it was a dream or if this was actually serious and I should call the police. "What if she was running away from her kidnapper?" This thought stayed with me all throughout the night and wouldn't go away. I was worried if the little girl was in danger and I didn't do nothing about it.

Suddenly, I heard scratches on my door that made my heart skip a beat until I realised it might just be my dog who also hears the cries outside and might be scared. I quietly say his name from the other side of the door before opening it, and there it was a small whimper. I recognised it was him I mean who wouldn't have their dogs bark or whimper recognised. I opened the door and let him in. He straight away jump up on the bed and laid down in a ball. I was really shocked as I never saw him like that. It was strange as he always would be a brave dog but this time it was different. I got back in bed and under the covers. I looked at my dog and he looked back and he placed his head on my stomach so I started stroking him.

It has past some time but the cries would not stop and again I felt the guilt, so I stood up on my bed and leaned on the window as the bed wasn't right against the wall the window was on but it had a gap between it the size of a night stand. I peered out and I saw nothing. Just a normal empty street and definitely no girl. My soul left my body and I felt like I couldn't breath. It was a feeling that stook with me and I couldn't explain what it was. I laid there still, just like I did before and waited for my moms phone call as that would give me comfort.

Its been approximately 20 minutes and the cries for help wouldn't stop. I remembered that all this happened in the span of 1 hour.  When the cries first started it was 3:12am. I could never forget that time even if I wanted to. I don't known why my mom didn't call on that break as she started her night shift at 6pm and ended at 6am, so her last break would be at 3am. That was the only thing that I would wait for.

Eventually, I did fall asleep to the sound of the light, the TV and the loud cries and running of the little girl. The next morning I couldn't stop thinking about it and to this day I think about this experience everyday and only told my mom about it. My mom also found it strange but she didn't care about it as much as I did.

I'm writing this because I'm curious if anyone else had anything like this happen to them or if someone might know what this was and why I heard the cries but saw no girl.

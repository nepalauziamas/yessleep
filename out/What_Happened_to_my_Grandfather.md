Sorting through my grandfather's things after his death has been emotional turmoil. My Grandpa raised me from the age of 6 after my parents' fiery death in a car crash. He was the greatest man I had ever known even if he was haunted by demons that I could never figure out, well until the letters I found tucked away in the back of the attic. After reading them I now understand the drinking and sudden night screams that emanated from his room. Knowing what he went through in 1943 would make any person turn stiff. 

The following is what Sgt William Charles Bayer II wrote,

April 6, 1943
Laurtal, France

We have arrived in the  village of Laurtal today. It's a small quaint town with a few dozen homes, and thankfully there is an Inn where we may grab some food and a nice soft bed. The villagers seem relieved we are here because they know the turmoils that are happening around us. From what we have been told no Nazis have made their way into these lands so we should be safe while we wait the few days for Unit C.

The townsfolk generously had a giant feast prepared for us for supper. Roast chicken, potatoes, pan fried vegetables, fresh bread, and wine. It was the best food I have had since entering the country. This is the ideal place to wait, it will give the men some rest and boost morale.

Some odd mishaps seemed to have happened while I slept. Men have mentioned hearing strange almost animalistic calls coming from a farmer's barn that kept them from their slumber. When we went to investigate we found livestock torn to shreds and blood littering the hay. The men speculate perhaps a wolf but, I have never seen a wolf do this much carnage. We are supposed to meet up with Unit C in two days so I hope the men can rest. I do believe the copious amount of delicious meals the men are receiving will surely help with that.

More of those strange calls echoed throughout the streets last night. I heard them myself and I can not begin to fathom what they could be. At first, I thought maybe a bear was walking around but the gravelly wheezing tone suggests it was not. Captain Heatly has not been seen this morning as well as three riflemen, Pvt. Carter, Vance, Sawyer and our medic Clark. This leaves only 23 more men plus me. The locals have never seen anything like this and do not know what is going on. We can only assume it is Nazis that are picking us off but without any more knowledge, we need to wait. Hopefully, we can survive the night.

They are all dead and I almost perished along with them. As we slept the monstrosities emerged, hairless grey creatures with piercing red eyes, long dark scraggly black hair, and sharp-pointed claws and teeth. The wicked grins they wore as they devoured my comrades will haunt me for the rest of my days. They came in from every entrance with no warning whatsoever and attacked. I feel no shame that I hid as these creatures, whatever they were tore the limbs free off the people I have called friends and ate everything including the bone. As I escaped out a window I noticed that the houses around had no light, no movement even with the loud monstrous calls and murder coming from the Inn. How could these people sleep through this? 

I ran into a nearby forest hiding until morning. I ventured back into town to collect what I could to go meet the other unit. As I returned to the Inn no bodies remained, the blood must have been cleaned up because it was as if nothing had happened during the night. Even all the packs and weapons were gone including my own. I called out for help asking the town folks who seemed to have no clue what I was speaking about. They had thought we had all left in the night. With no answers and none of my things, I made the trek out of town to meet Unit C. I do not know what I will tell them but I am sure they will not believe me.


I am at a loss for words, there were no other entries after these. It was almost as if he had given up from the shock of it all. I have seen enough horror movies to know this is just people's imagination used for entertainment but, my grandfather was never even one to watch or read fiction so I do not believe he would make something like this up. Do any of you have an explanation of what could have happened?

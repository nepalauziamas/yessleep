I need help. But not badly enough that you should read this if you’re like Clara. That is, if you’re still being swallowed whole by your eating disorder, this is not an uplifting tale that is going to pave your way to recovery. Head over to wholesomememes or something. Let other people figure me out. 


I was hoping I’d be writing one of those unbearable posts on the relationship subreddit about the utter, soppy joy I’ve found with my partner after a lifetime of fuck ups. 


Clara is tall and buck-toothed and made me homemade pasta every Friday night. She sings tenor and somehow finds time to read two fantasy books every week. She still steps into the bathroom to change in the morning, casting her eyes back over her shoulder to be sure I’m not watching.


She’s heard voices for years now. Mostly, though, they’re kind. 


They give her advice and explain the way things are. They silent to her worries and assure her that they are small.

Clara tells me she doesn’t hear them anymore. But sometimes I catch her in the sun room. Frozen, head cocked to the side, silhouette bathed in light.

That’s the kind of life we had. One with a room that existed for the sole purpose of capturing light. Within it a beautiful woman, head tilted over her novel bound in green leather. 

-----------------------------------------------


It started like this. I was supposed to meet Annabelle for our third date. I had been assured by numerous movie previews and glimpses of women’s magazine at the grocery store checkout line that tonight, after a humiliating 2.5 decades, I’d be able to stop lying about my virginity.


Annabelle had a nose piercing. She liked that I paid for dinner and opened doors. She smoked like a pipe and laughed like a goose.


I arrived at the bookstore, swallowing with the mere thought of later tonight. Tormenting myself with last minute variations on how to extend that invitation to her, the reciprocal agonies of either her acceptance or laughing refusal.


I saw Annabelle in my favorite dress, a short black one. I walked up from behind her and wrapped my arms around her waist. I hoisted her into the air, a move that left Annabelle in peals of laughter.


Clara screamed and then punched me in the face. I threw my hands up and stepped backwards, trying to look like a man who was embarrassed of his mistake, not his actions.  


I apologized until “sorry” stopped sounding like English. I offered her an expensive latte in compensation, wary of making her feel pressured into spending time with me, attacked a second time in a smaller way. 


Clara froze and eyed me up and down. I kept my eyes directly on her face.


Like a sergeant expressing approval for the perfect shot, she inclined her head slightly, once. I bought her an apple cider chai and toffee bread pudding, per her request.


She relaxed into the wooden chair like it was a thick mattress. She ate the entire massive bread pudding without hesitation or shyness. We started chatting. Clara was funny and shy and had a disorganized smattering of freckles across her nose. It was a libido-baffling combination of sexy and endearing. 


We both loved Harry Potter and horror movies. We’d both lost our Dads in elementary school. We were both the oldest of many siblings. We both read cooking blogs when we woke up each morning.


Annabelle never showed. She blocked my number the next day. She was what my grandma would have termed “flighty”.

I lost my virginity on our wedding day, three years later.


------------------------------------------


Our second date was at the firing range. 

Clara was a county champion shot with the rifle. She tried to teach me. She was patient and gentle and sincerely encouraging of any minute sign of progress. Turns out all I can do with a rifle is make a loud sound.


We walked out of the range and I taught her the difference between the sounds of a Northern Flicker and a Pileated Woodpecker. 


She pretended it was interesting. I pretended I hadn’t attended two rallies against gun ownership the year before. 


The smile took days to leave my face. My brothers mocked me loudly for it at our weekend climbing meet up. I laughed with them and did not notice the pain in the tips of my fingers. 


---------------------------------------------------


Clara whispered everything to me one night when we were walking through a park and holding hands.

“You shouldn’t marry me without knowing this.” She began.


It was six months in. I hadn’t said a word about marriage but the fact that she did gave me a pleasant, warm feeling without so much as a twitch of nerves.


I cocked my head to the side. “Herpes really isn’t that big of a deal. Most adults only have one outbreak-”


“Oh, I don’t know.” She cracked a tiny smile that showed the gap between her front teeth in all its inexplicable glory. “They haven’t studied the strand you have yet.”


“My face is on the cover of a medical journal next month.” I allowed. We paused, worn out from improv. “What is it, then?”


“I’m adopted.”


“Okay.”


She didn’t have anything else to say for a long moment. I asked. 

“How do you feel about that?”


“Great.”


I waited again. “Then besides not knowing extended medical history--”


“That isn’t quite all,” She sighed and finally spoke. 


There’d been an incident in her childhood. 


Her neighbors and teachers had been calling CPS for years about the sweet but clearly hungry and often flea-infested Clara. 

Apparently there was neither sufficient evidence nor funding for anything beyond feeble suggestions for parenting plans and counselors.


Until there was. Her birth mother, after force-feeding Clara her schizophrenia medications for a few weeks, attempted to give her an abortion with a clothes hanger.


She lived because her math teacher had seen her earlier that day, in the park, muttering to herself and twitching like a methhead. 

He’d asked for a wellness check and the heavy-lidded officer had found her bleeding on a couch, completely silent. 


“My mom says he was a guardian angel. I send him a Christmas card every year. He’ll be seated with family at our wedding.”


She was put into state custody with the kindest pair of Mormons you’ve ever met. 


“They told me God had saved me from that life and delivered me to a new one. That was the best news I had ever heard.”


I didn’t know what to say. The worst thing that had ever happened to me was my brother selling my baseball cards in middle school. 

He then used them to purchase a PS4 he didn’t even let me play. 


She told me that no one was sure if she could even have children. And that while her mom and dad were her parents in every way that mattered, some things breed true.


“I hear voices too.”


I told her it didn’t matter. So before you jump aboard calling me a piece of shit. I am, I know. But I guess I thought we could get through anything together. Being with Clara required a lot sometimes. I thought it was okay if I asked something big of her in return. 


-------------------------



We were twenty-eight when we got married. There were hundreds of pictures from that day. But the one Clara has framed is my face when she’s first walked in: teary-eyed and naked with joy I didn’t know a body could contain. 


Clara had always said she wanted to start trying for children when she was thirty, so that “I have time with you all to myself for a while.”


I smiled at the shy yet eager way she approached me. “But I get to be the father, right?”


She smiled at that. “That way, if things don’t work out, we have more time for IVF and even adoption.”


“We’re going to be such good parents.” I reached out and squeezed her hand. Just this once, I’d said the right thing at the correct moment. 


“Best looking family in the neighborhood,” Clara agreed.


Two months later we had a bit of a scare.


Clara shifted nervously on her feet, sliding back and forth. 


Finally it burst out of her  like a dam. “I’m not ready. Not now. And it isn’t you. You’re better than I ever dreamed anyone could be. I wanted to be higher up on the ladder at my job. I wanted to go to Italy in the summer and stay up late on weeknights for a few years.”


“It doesn’t have to be now,” I told her. “I’m not upset.”


The test was negative.


Clara told her doctor that she wanted to switch from the pill to the injection. 


“Some women have a bad reaction,” She’d warned me, “I might get a little testy while I’m adjusting.”


“How will I notice the difference?” She’d swatted me playfully. I continued, “And you haven’t even had the shots yet.”


She swatted at me again. 


She made me blueberry pancakes for breakfast that morning with homemade lemon curd. I loved her. I still do. 


-----------------------------------------------


Our sex life, through the force of sheer and stupid luck, was wonderful. She was flattered by my constant desire and receptive at least daily. She had no shame or nervousness when she undressed before me.


I loved the arch of her hipbones and the dimples of her back. When we were together it was loving and possessive all at once. 


I’m not trying to brag. I’m trying to explain. It was that simple. I never thought I was shallow. I would have bet you a lifetime savings that the way I felt about her was basically unrelated to the pleasing way her back tapered into her ass. That’s what I would’ve thought.


--------------------------------------------------


Clara couldn’t calculate a tip without using her phone but with people she was as sharp as one of those knives that used to be for surgeons but are now for weekend butchers as well. It may have had something to do with how she grew up; the easy way she could sense the subtle current shifting beneath people. 


Sometimes I was jealous of that gift. For the most part, though, I was profoundly grateful. When life kicked me in the teeth, Clara usually knew without me telling her.


It was a fast way to learn bad habits.


So she knew that something had slid. She knew I didn’t reach for her hips the first thing in the morning anymore. She knew that I was a lot more likely to hug her like a sister than cop a feel.


My wife was wise if not precisely clever.


“Are you skeeved out about the pregnancy thing?” She asked softly.


For a moment I was furious. Obviously we couldn’t have a baby right now. Obviously nothing but her sweatpants fit anymore. She was supposed to be able to assemble this information and perform the correct action with no input of mine.


“No, not at all.” I felt a sharp stab of affection and cloying guilt at the hurt in her tone. “You did the right thing. We did the right thing. I don’t worry about that at all.”


“I don’t either,” She said with a quiet sigh. “So what’s going on then?”


So I told her. 


She’d gained fifty pounds after the birth control switch and it bothered me. A lot. 


-------------------------------------------


I didn’t think. I was driving home the next day. I called her on the hands free phone. “Hey, babe,” I said. 

Clara greeted me. I asked if she’d been sleeping and she said that she hadn’t.

I realize now that her voice was groggy from tears.

“So Ben and Jerry’s in on sale. What flavor should I get for you?”

“Oh, I’m okay. I’m not really in an ice cream mood.” She said levelly.

I realized what I’d done. “I’m being an ass,” I told her. “And after I promised I was going to do this with you.”

“I’m okay,” She said in that exact same tone.

I tried again. “Clara,” I told her. “You don’t have to be okay. I dumped this whole thing on you out of nowhere and we’ve never had any serious issues before. You’re not chewing my balls off because you’re a saint but you can be mad or disappointed or something.”

Silence on the other end of the line. Then a few gulps as she choked  back tears. “I could never blame you for anything.”

“Try.” I whispered back. “Please.”

For the first time ever, she hung up on me. 


------------------------------------



She never told me I didn’t deserve her or echoed any of the other nasty thoughts I had about myself. If it had been anyone but my deeply good wife, I would have assumed she did this with intent, to fill me with a lacerating shame.


I felt much better. I felt like I wasn’t trying to carry a giant Pacific Octopus with me everywhere I went anymore.


I went home for Friday night.


I wasn’t thinking. I asked, “What kind of pasta do you want to make tonight? I’m feeling some gorgonzola ravioli. I’ll get it started?”


Clara froze like I’d struck her. Then, slowly, she shook her head.


“Let’s have some salmon, instead,” She whispered. 


“Can I cook it for you?””


“No, I’m better at it.” She muttered, gaze listing strangely off to the right.


“You are.” I told her and then paused. “But could I please make you some dinner?”


We both had salmon and asparagus for dinner. It was delicious and salty and wholesome. I ate seconds.


Clara weighed her plate on our food scale before she would eat a single bite.



------------------------------------------


I spent the next weekend groveling. I took her shooting to the range in Andover, even though it was fifty miles away. Even though I still thought American gun ideals were like trying burying mines in your yard in case you were robbed. I played her Hamilton soundtrack on the way over even though I had a hard time parsing the sentences into meaningful clauses. 


Clara flinched visibly when I took my hand off of the wheel to squeeze hers.

“So if we pay extra you can shoot a bunch of old TVs with an assault rifle.”


Her face turned to mine and finally cleared. “How much extr---””


She paused long enough to make me nervous.


“Who cares. It’s your treat anyway.”


I laughed. I would’ve anyway to make her feel good but I did it because she was constantly funny.


And then I said a very unfunny thing. “Are we going to get through this? I mean, I know I hurt you badly and you don’t need to decide right now but. Do you think we get through this?”


Her eyebrows slammed together at the top of her face. “Of fucking course. What other option is there?”


“For me, absolutely nothing.” I told her. I meant it. “I’m so sorry.”


“You already said that.” Her tone didn’t give anything away.


“I’m still sorry.”


“Steven,” She started out sounding angry. She paused, took a deep breath, and tried again. “It’s fine. It’s not great but. I have a body. I am a soul. Okay? We’re going to be fine.” 


When we arrived she unloaded clip after clip into a television, until it was only slim pieces of black plastic heaped against each other, bound only  by gravity.


I counted the cash in my wallet before I offered. “Do you want another television set?”


Clara paused and considered. “No, thank you.” She responded in that prim way she has.


On our way back she thoughtfully pinched the roll of fat that spilled out over the top of her jeans. It hadn’t been there six weeks ago.


“I love you,” I told her because those had never been the wrong words before. 


She corrected me gently but it still felt like a punch to the balls. 

“You love most of me.”


I didn’t have a response.


-----------------------------------------


I kept trying to make it up to her. I’d always been kind to and considerate of Clara but now I thought of almost nothing else. She hadn’t beaten me to the dishwasher once in months. I brought home flowers, fancy armor-piercing rounds and beautifully bound classics. She’d only ever smile for a second when I handed them to her but that was about the only time she smiled at all.


The third time in a week I’d gotten her a first edition of a Tamora Pierce book Clara finally looked right at me.


“We can’t afford all this stuff..”


I paused. “I’m still following the budget, I promise. You know I wouldn’t do that to you.”

I was. I’d just stopped buying myself morning coffees and any new clothes or lunch out with my coworkers.


She hesitated and I read into it. “Well, at least I hope that you know that. I would never take money from our house or from our future child or from you.”


Clara tilted her head to the side, listening to someone I couldn’t hear.


“Okay.” She said. “I do know that. But I also know that you want to fix everything for me.” 


“Is that a bad thing?” I did want that. I wanted to use my hands and grab hold and make our home feel happy again.I wanted to stop gripping my shirt until my knuckles went pale and kissing her on the forehead like she was my kid sister. 


“I started the calorie counting app,” She told me softly.


It took me a moment to catch up with the topic change. “Okay. I’ll do that too, then, since you shouldn’t be the only one putting all of this effort in.”


Her shoulders slumped down. “Steven, it isn’t working. I’ve been eating 1,300 calories again for three weeks and doing all of this running and it isn’t working.”


For a moment, I felt trapped by the idea that I was going to have to choose between my perfect, beloved, adored, wife and someone 

I was excited to have sex with. Then I swallowed that down and met her panicked eyes.


“Maybe it’s time to see a doctor, then.” I told her softly. “Thank you for trying so hard. I’m really sorry.”


“For what?”


“For needing this,” I answered.


That night, she laid her head against my shoulder and I ran my fingers through her hair. Things were better, for a little bit. Then, almost too slowly for me to notice, they weren’t.


“The doctor says that my metabolism is normal.” Clara was allowing herself to cry this time, without shame. “She said that there was no way I was eating as little as I said I was but I am.”


I tried to gather her into my lap, the way I used to in the evenings, but now my arms could only just wrap around her torso. I squeezed her, hard.


“Time for a different doctor, I think,” I told her. “That one sounds like...a lot of words I was taught not to use in liberal arts college.”


“She’s all of them. But what if she’s right?”


I paused. “Right how? You’re trying your hardest and it isn’t working so clearly we don’t have all of the information.”


“I mean, what if I’m just fat--”


“You’re not fat-”


“Because of what I’m eating? What if I’m just someone who has to be fat or who has to be hungry all of the time?”


“I don’t think that’s an actual diagnosis.” I murmured to her softly. 


“And then they fucking told me to kill you,” I did not need to ask the identity of this advisor, “So overall not a good day.” She cried again and then finally, finally leaned her face into my chest and dampened it. 



I didn’t ask if she was still taking her medications. It would have been like asking if the sun still rose.



“Maybe it’s time to switch the birth control again.”


I felt her sigh against me. “I got the implant out last month.”


I paused, baffled.


“It could take months for the hormones to clear out.”


“Gross,” I said, thoughtless.


“No, you are.” She replied but it sounded like she’d started sobbing again anyway. 


-------------------------------------------------


It’s not like I was in any danger of winning Husband of The Year in any case. But it took me entire days to notice. Clara would be out the door before me in the morning, allegedly on a short run before work. 


So I’d kiss her dry brow on her way out the door and eat my eggs alone in the sunshine. Sometimes I would make time to have lunch with her during the week, usually at least once.


It was a Friday when she oh-so-casually mentioned that that wouldn’t work anymore, that she’d started a lunchtime program for students struggling with fractions.


I paused. “Are you sure you’re not doing too much?”


She shot back immediately. “Positive. I’m only there for seven hours anyway.”


To me, surrounded by second graders who had not yet learned how to form shapes into syllables, that sounded like an eternity.


Dinner we still had together nearly every night. I just didn’t understand that it was her only meal.


I borrowed her phone once that summer. I wanted to find a picture of her from when we’d just met.


I opened her calorie counter app on a nosy impulse. 


Her daily goal was listed: 1100 calories.  


I flipped open my own app, which I used religiously as yet another unasked-for offering of love, hoping I could pour enough to fill the hole I’d left her with. 


Yesterday alone, I’d had 2800. 


That was the first time I’d started to wonder if she maybe had a problem.


It would not be the last. 


-------------------------------------------


I tried to ask her about the next day.


“So I was using your phone for something yesterday and I noticed your calorie counter app.”


She stared up at me with huge, nervous eyes. If we were a different couple I would have assumed I’d found infidelity. But I knew her and honestly the truth was bigger and worse.


I explained, haltingly, that I’d done some research and it suggested that no one ever go below 1300 calories a day. And even then it shouldn’t be for long.


“It’s different for women,” She told me primly.


“Yeah, I read some about that too.” I replied in an even tone. “But every source I checked agreed that that isn’t enough to eat. That someone eating that little might be damaging themselves.”


Her brow crinkled in confusion. “Isn’t this what you wanted?”


“For you to eat yourself instead of food? Jesus, Clara. Of course not.”


“It’s fine,” She said again. “At least this is working.”


 I thought we told each other everything and it hurt finding out that that was something we’d only used to do. And late that night 

I found her in the sunroom, face tranquil and head cocked.


I just hoped they were being nice to her today.


I led her back to bed. She followed me, compliant and silent with absent eyes. 


---------------------------------------------


Our scale alleged it was smart, so I used it to track her progress. Not to see if she was making any; I would have given her the rest of our lives. To see if she was as sick as I was making out.


She’d dropped eight pounds last week.


Clara had tried to say that she was going out for dinner with a work friend; that she was going to go to Zumba but I insisted. Friday night was when we made dinner together. Since it seemed impossible to recreate our old closeless maybe our old routines could be a start. 


She ate two cubes of cheese, three cups of arugula and a dainty, small plum. 


I loaded up a plate with my clumsily assembled tortellini and placed it in front of her. She made steady and unabashed eye contact and dumped it in the trash.


We hadn’t had sex in three weeks. She was slimmer now but so palpably unhappy I couldn’t get it up anyway. 



-----------------------------------------


That summer I begged her to go back to the doctor.


She looked down at me. “For what? I’ve never looked better.”


Her elbows were sharp and jagged, like they were trying to escape from skin. Her arms were covered with a fine, bizarre down that we both pretended not to notice. 


“Please,” I said and she shrugged. 


“I can see if she’ll me next week,” She said calmly. Like she needed the appointment for a weird mole. Like she was barely pretending to humor my silly, hennish whims. “If I have time”.


----------------------------


Clara did not find the time to sit down with a medical professional who would explains she was murdering herself.

I called Geoffrey late that night and unloaded the whole thing. 

“She ate a fat free yogurt for lunch. Just that.”

He listened. Because he loved me and he loved Clara and knew how to show it in ways that count. 

“I’ll ask the attending for facility recommendations,” He finally offered. 

“She won’t go,” I almost moaned in terror. “She won’t.”

Geoffrey paused for a long time. “Once she hits a certain weight she can be admitted involuntarily. By police officers.”

“She’s going to fucking hate me.”

“Yeah,” Geoffrey said, “But she’s going to be alive to do it.”


-------------------------------------



I made her a small stack of protein pancakes with scrambled eggs the next day. I insisted she sat down and placed it in front of her, tormented by the fantasy of her smelling it and actually eating a fucking meal. 


“I’m not eating that,” She said matter-of-factly. “That’s got way too many carbs.”


“Please,” I asked her cordially. “Please eat it.”


She tilted her head and paused. “It was only six months ago you would’ve wanted the opposite. Jesus, Steven. Make up your mind.”


“Just eat it. God, aren’t you hungry? You have got to be literally starving.”


I was in tears now. 


Clara sighed and spoke to me in the precise tone she used one overwrought seven year olds.  “I’m trying to be healthy, Steven. At your request, I might add. I’d really hoped you would support me in this.”


And she got up and walked away. 


I could’ve counted the vertebrae prominent from beneath her running shirt but I did not want to. 


I hurled the full plate at the wall once I was positive she was too far away to hear the crash of destruction. The gummy eggs slid down onto the floor, untouched.


I chanted curse words to myself. I would try again, I decided. I was the only wall between my wife and this gaping void and I would dig in my feet and refuse to budge. I would save her because the alternative did not bear thinking about. 

--------------------------------

On our wedding anniversary, I scooped a tiny quarter cup of Half Baked into the bowl. My days passed by in a haze of equally unproductive worrying and begging. I’d called doctors and police departments and they all told me it hadn’t gone far enough yet.


“It’s your favorite.” I told her. “Please, just to celebrate.”


Clara put down the book she’d been reading and blinking at me, eyes looking enormous in her sunken face. “Steven, we need to use things that aren’t food to celebrate. That’s just paving the way for more bad habits.”


“It’s just a tiny bit.”


“Steven,” She said with a tiny hiss. “I said no.”


“I love you.” I told her, “I love you so much and I am so scared.”


“I love you too,” She told me, eyes drifting back to her novel. “And there’s nothing to be afraid of.”


---------------------------------------

I awoke that weekend to an empty bed. I rose to find her, my right arm and moral compass and most utterly unexpected and undeserved gift. I knew in my churning gut it was bad. 


I found my wife in the pantry. Clara looked up at me guiltily. She cringed like she was expecting to be struck. The shelves of cereal and dry pasta were in perfect order, utterly untouched.


 I opened my mouth. I inhaled to tell her how proud I was that she was eating something and that I didn’t give a single fuck if she took every meal for the rest of her life in our cellar at prime numbered am hours. An odd smell clung to the air. 


A butcher knife lay on the floor, streaked with long strips of blood and an irregular smear of grease. I opened the door a little wider and the light rushed in to expose a dark puddle steadily expanding across the linoleum floor. 


Clara chewed thoughtfully. Something dangled from the corner of her mouth, like a thick and overcooked noodle. 


Her right hand guided more into her mouth where she labored to chew it.  Her other clutched her stomach tightly. 


The wound on her torso was a terrible, long, jagged thing. Gushing blood and visceral crept around the feeble barrier of her fingers. 


“I was just so hungry,” She murmured around her mouthful. “I figured this way, the calories don’t count.”

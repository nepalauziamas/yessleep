When I was 15 my mom basically threw me away to cps and I had to stay with my uncle for some time because there was nowhere else to go. For a little bit of a backstory my mom used to dabble in witchcraft as a teen but she had a really bad experienced with a ouija board. I believe her reckless behaviors are a direct reason as to why I suffer so much with seeing ghosts and paranormal activities. 

My dad is a crazy roman catholic god fearing man. When him and my mom got together she never wanted to go to church because her mom used to abuse her and tell her she was going to hell. My dad had recently told me he tried throwing away one of my moms old ugly dresses and apparently she had gotten so angry because she couldn't throw away that dress because that's the dress she was married  to satan in. 

He was scared of her after that and started to pray that she would change paths. One thing after another and his life started falling apart. He tried escaping with the military but it followed him. When he came back after desert storm his mind started playing tricks on him and he started to lose his mind. He couldn't tell what was real and what wasn't. He tried killing me when I was 6 and after that I wasn't afraid of death anymore. She left him and took his kids (my siblings and I) , his house, his car, and his money. She drained the man of everything.

Back to me, my mom hated my guts and I never knew why. She gave me up to my uncle at first but then changed her mind in the end and told CPS I needed to be in the system not with family. Part of me wonders if its because i'm hypersensitive to seeing things. At this time in my life I was heavily medicated taking anti-anxiety medications, antipsychotics, antidepressants, and was very inconsistent with taking them because I never liked taking them. This could've been a hallucination but I doubt it. I had other spiritual encounters in this house as well as other houses too.

There was a time I saw a very fluffy mouse scurry across the kitchen around 2am and as I looked up from the mouse I saw a tall lanky boy who had no eyes and a sewn up mouth with no fingers. I have insomnia so I barely got a good night's rest. There was another time I was home alone still in my uncle's house and I heard someone calling me and when I went to the living room and a bunch of books fell off the bookshelf at the same time the fridge door opened and slammed. 

The scariest thing that's ever happened to me in that house was the cross. I get chills writing this. Just thinking about it scares me to this day. It was about 3:40 AM or close to this time and I was asleep on the couch that was facing the entrance to the house. Right above the front door is a cross. that cross is a very heavy dark wooden cross. No slight breeze could've just pushed it and made it swing the way it did. I jolted awake because I felt the blanket being ripped off of me and heard a girls voice whisper in my ear "you're never getting away" and the cross violently turned upside down. I was frozen in fear waiting for it to be daytime and just sat there until 9am scared to move or breathe too hard. 

I have yet to sleep in the living room again and since then. I've been able to tell when things were about to turn sour since then. Nothing good has happened to me and I feel genuinely cursed with the feeling someone's always watching me closely especially at night. The little girls' voice came to me the other night when I miscarried my baby. I was only 10 weeks along and It took me 17 years to conceive my only baby just to have it taken away by this thing. I was diagnosed at the age of 19 with infertility. I am 36 and still have that girls voice in my head right when something bad is about to happen. my husband left me when the doctor said we lost the baby. I'm alone and childless. I can't sleep because i'm afraid she's going to get me one of these days now that i've been diagnosed with coronary artery disease. I've been thinking and this isn't going to stop until I am dead. I just know I have to sacrifice myself to end this nightmare. I don't know what to do anymore. I'm afraid I am running out of time.

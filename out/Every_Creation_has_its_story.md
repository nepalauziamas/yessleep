(This is part 1 of the story, there will be a part 2, when Dave and Lucy leave the store and go home things will really start to get creepy, weird and horrific)

Dear Reader...
If you are reading this now then just remember whenever you seen an odd manequin on display...I will be watching you... and waiting for you...


I was inside the little cafe next to Stowmarket Library with my wife, Lucy.

"So how was work today Dave?" Lucy asked, while biting into her carrot cake

"Work was ok, same as usual, stamping off book return dates, and organising the book shelves in the Library, nothing special. How was your day?" I replied 

"I finished off a project. I can show it to you when we get home."

We didn't say much else, finished our food, payed and left. On the way to the car we passed by a little store with a big sign on front saying "La Popular". There was a beautiful and remarkably realistic manequin on display in the windowsill in a glass box. She had  short brown hair held up by the coats of the pristine white wedding dress. Lucy was ecstatic. In the 15 years I've known her and been married to her she has always had an interest in Manequinns and clothes and even makes her own. "Let's go in" Lucy said.

"Sure, there might be some stuff you could buy here" I replied

So we walked into the shop. The secod we walked in here I felt unease, as if I was being watched. The store was small with tons of wedding dresses on display, mostly on headless and limbless manoquins, all going around the circle in a rectangular fashion. "Aren't they pretty?" Asked Lucy 

"Yes they really are" I replied back. 

We went to the counter, of which there was an ominous elderly man, dressed in a black shirt with a Voodoo doll on the front of it, some black jeans and a hat with a skull on top and "Death" written on the sides. He also had one eye and some teeth missing. we asked him about the store and the mannequin.

"Why hello there...Dave. I haven't had any customers in a long time, are you curious about the manequinns and dresses?" Asked the ominous old man 

"Yes I am, but first aren't you going to acknowledge and say hello to my wife, Lucy, first, whos standing right next to me?"  Replied Dave irritated

"You have a wife. How nice but Dave... I don't see anyone next you, besides me you are the only one here" The old man inquiried concerningly.

"I'm right here" Lucy shouted. The man didn't seem to hear. This isn't the first time this has happened, wherever I go, people seem to not notice or see or hear Lucy, as if she was just a spectre. 

"OK then well tell me about this store and the manequinn up front" I sighed.

"Well you see Dave this shop has been around since the 20th century and that manequin at the front is based off the original store owners daughter, called Pascualita, was killed by a scorpion sting on her wedding day and driven insane when she was on the brink of death, she was laughing hysterically saying she will kill 'them' all, whoever 'them" may be" 

I stood flabbergasted, shocked by this and the fact that we have missed such a store that has been around for over a century. I had started to hold Lucy's hand in my fright in disbelief and I could sense Lucy felt the same way as I did at this news 

"That's terrible" Lucy squeezed out.

"Well hope you come again" the man remarked. I thanked him for his time and we walked out of the store. When we left the store and walked past the mannequin, I could of swear i saw it Grin and it's eyes bulge slightly. I also noticed how the hands of the manequin have even got veins and look remarkably  like preserved dead hands. It somehow also reminded me of Lucy, tho I can't quote put my finger on why.

"It's like I was a just a spectre in that store, the man didn't notice me at all" Lucy said irritated


Any Constructive Criticism would be very much appreciated as well, thank you

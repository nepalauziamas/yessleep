God, it’s been a week.

Kind of hard to believe it’s only been seven days, actually - less than fourteen since this all started. So much has happened so fast that it’s honestly starting to feel like it’s been this way all my life.

So. I’m writing this the day after I’ve gotten back from the ‘stronghold’ of the Church of the Thirteenth Hour, where I’ve been for most of the week. It’s a strange place; an old school converted into a cult stronghold. It’d almost be beautiful, if it wasn’t so damn creepy.

It’s…this might be a little bit of a trek. A lot has happened, and…well. I’m still a little…I might still be in shock a little.

But it’s important I write this down. Enough details have already faded from my mind, and if I don’t get this out now I might repress it or something.

The point is, this might be a little broken in places. Try to bear with me.

So, where did it begin?

I stayed in the motel another day after I typed up the last batch of info. I needed time to adjust, and to think of what I’d tell Dad when I got home, and, more importantly, what I’d tell his ‘church’. I knew Dad would believe me in an instant - he always does - but some weirdo cult guy was another story. I would *not* be found out by a bunch of monster worshippers building vessels in a basement, even if one of them was my father.

I don’t know if he’d protect me, if I was caught. I like to hope he would, but...I also like to hope he wouldn’t build eldritch abominations in the basement, and that ship’s sailing as we speak. Besides, I kind of don’t want to put him in that position anyway. Putting myself in danger is one thing, but I refuse to get anyone else involved.

I don’t *know* if the Church is dangerous. Maybe it’s some completely innocuous group of weirdos worshipping a long forgotten god. Maybe those gods never really existed in the first place. But honestly, their leader scares the shit out of me, and I don’t want to think about what the others get up to during Sinfair, either.

So I waited another day, and I went home.

I didn’t think Dad was home when I got back. I couldn’t see him anywhere, and the house was remarkably silent, despite his keys still being on the hook. I was ready to go to my room and stew for a bit before I had a thought, and headed down to the basement.

He isn’t locking the place anymore -- which seems like a level of trust *I* definitely wouldn’t have in me -- so I was able to walk right in and down the newly polished steps.

It was just as creepy as it was the first time, though I was expecting it this time around. The smell of chemicals burned my nose, and something was making a low beeping noise I hadn’t heard from the house, even in the dead of night. Maybe it’s new...or maybe Dad decided to soundproof his creepy lab.

He was down there. He was facing away from me as he leant over the operating table, stitching something to a large, swollen mass of flesh. I tried not to look too hard at what seemed suspiciously like an ear, though my brain didn’t hesitate to supply the identity of the monster before him - *That’s the Chanter. It’s exactly right*.

I approached him, then faltered. I wasn’t really sure what to say; what *do* you say in a situation like this? ‘Hey Dad, how’re the monsters going?’ ‘Nice severed ear you’re holding’? The whole thing is so unreal that I honestly still don’t know what to say to any of these people, and believe me, I’ve been trying.

As I approached the table, and my dad, I felt myself growing more unsteady. I could hear my heart racing at 100mph, feel my hands shaking, and I had to take a breath to try and steady myself.

*You’re fine, Tanya,* I told myself. *This is your dad, He’d never hurt you*.

He wouldn’t. I still believe that.

He’s not the one I’m afraid of.

I cleared my throat. “...Hi, Dad.”

He startled at that; too caught up in work to hear me coming. That’s nothing new. I remember walking in on him building a weirdly lifelike model of a mouth when I was younger.

“Tanya!” he exclaimed, dropping his equipment and setting down the ear. “You’re home.”

He looked at me with so much hope in his eyes. Hope that I would stay, that I’d live with this. Hope that I’d be okay.

It occurred to me that I could still leave. I could pack a bag and go, escape this madness. My uni has dorms I could stay in. I could be closer to classes, meet new people, not have to get up nearly as early for those shitty morning classes...and most importantly, live a completely normal life. I could still run.

Instead, I wrapped one arm around myself and tried for a smile. It came out with just the right amount of nervousness.

“Hi,” I said again. “Um…”

He went to hug me, then stopped to peel off his disposable gloves, then went to hug me again, then faltered. He looked to me for permission, and I just nodded.

My dad hugged me tightly, and I let myself hug him back. It felt so familiar, and god, I wanted to just let it be normal. Like I was a little girl again.

“Can we talk?” I asked when he pulled back.

He nodded. “Can you give me a moment to put some things away?”

“Sure, Dad. I...sure.”

“I’ll be quick,” he promised. “You can wait upstairs if you like. We’ll talk, and then we can order pizza for dinner. The expensive one. And I got some more ice cream -”

“That sounds great,” I interrupted. “I’ll go check out the menu, okay?” I wanted to reassure him that I wasn’t going anywhere. He didn’t have to worry about me being gone when he came up.

“Great!” he said with perhaps a little *too* much enthusiasm. “I’ll be right up, I promise -”

“I know, Dad.”

“Right!”

I tried for a smile, then headed up the stairs. All things aside, I *was* looking forward to the food. It’s a long time favourite, the celebratory meal Dad always bought for me when I finished exams. I stared at the menu even though I already knew what to order.

He was up in record time, and breathing hard enough to show it. I handed him the menu, and he handed it back to me. I handed it back to him, and then took it again; it’s a pattern I know so well, I just wanted to fall into familiarity. He did, too - it was the most obvious thing in the world.

He called up the restaurant to place the order, and by the time he sat back down again I was ready to speak.

“I’ve done some thinking.”

He laced his fingers together, sitting them on the table in front of him. I could see his foot twitch nervously under the table. “And?”

“I’m willing to hear you out. I don’t completely understand, and...I’m a little scared...” That part wasn’t even a lie. “But...you’re my dad. So...if you’re sure it’s okay…”

His face lit up. It sent a pang of guilt through me, but I pushed it down. I’d already made up my mind.

“Tanya, thank you,” he said with a look of absolute relief. “I know I might not have explained it properly last time -”

“I think I got it,” I interrupt. “You’re building bodies for them, right? Twelve for the holidays, and the Chorus. The herald of humanity.”

“Right,” he agrees. “We’re making good progress, too. Well...mostly.” His expression faltered a little.

That interested me. What caused that flicker of upset? What’s going wrong?

“What’s wrong?” I asked him.

“Nothing, Tanya. Everything’s progressing smoothly,” he lied. I could see him chewing his lip; his ‘tell’. He’s the one who taught me about tells, back when I was younger. Said that my ears twitched, so I’d always cover my ears when trying to lie. It took me an embarrassingly long time to work out.

I decided to let it go. “Okay,” I allowed. “You...how many of you are there?”

“Just one me,” he joked. “But if you mean the Church, there’s...honestly, I lose count. Our numbers are growing all the time. I’d worry it’d make the church feel less close-knit, but no matter how many people we bring in, they all seem to belong just fine.”

Seeing my opportunity, I shuffled a little in my seat. Glanced up, then back at the menu, then back up at him. Practiced, but not *too* practiced.

“They sound...really important to you, Dad.”

“...You know, Tanya? I think they are.”

“...Could I meet them?”

Any worries I had about him turning me down melted away instantly. Dad looked *relieved*; like he’d been waiting desperately for me to ask. “Of course! Of course - they’ve heard so much about you. Father Lucan would love to hear from you, and I could show you the lab I work in…”

“That sounds great, Dad,” I enthused. “It would…really help me understand, you know?”

“I understand completely, that makes lots of sense. Right now it’s all so unfamiliar to you, but once you know more, it’s not so scary. This is a good thing, Tanya.” He smiled brightly at me.

Guilt guilt guilt guilt. The guilt of tricking my Dad pushed down on me; it still does. Especially since I’m not even remotely done yet.

“I’ll let them know,” Dad said, “and we can get you up there soon, how does that sound?”

“That sounds good. I…yeah. I…don’t want to be scared anymore, Dad.”

That part wasn’t a lie. I’ve been scared - I’m *still* scared, more than ever, and I hate it. I’m not a little kid anymore, no longer jumping at shadows, but it feels like all of a sudden, they’re jumping *me*, and all I want to do is have everything go back to normal.

I don’t want to be scared anymore.

“Oh, Tanya.” Dad’s face crumpled with sympathy. “I know. It’s okay. It won’t be scary much longer, okay?”

“Okay,” I mumbled. He stroked my hair to comfort me, even as he got out his phone to text his cult. Couldn’t wait, apparently.

It really felt like everything moved fast, after that. Apparently Father Lucan was excited to meet me - my dad had talked about me a lot, it seems, which is kinda sweet if you ignore the circumstances. As a result, the cult meet and greet thing happened…really quickly. It was only the next morning that I found myself heading out into the country to meet the man.

I honestly didn’t think it’d be so…fast, but I think Dad was worried about me losing my nerve. Honestly, I was worried about the same thing, just for a very different reason, so I couldn’t be too upset about the timing. Less time to overthink.

I put a dress on and everything, to make a good impression. Despite myself, I want to make a good impression.

Dad pulled to a stop in front of a chain link fence in the middle of nowhere. There was more sand than I thought we had in the state, and the place honestly just looked like someone googled ‘cult hideout’ and designed it after that.

The place itself wasn’t too bad. It looked like an old school building, still in good condition, that had been repurposed. The design was crisp and clean, and the path looked like it had definitely been looked after…once upon a time. Sure, it really screamed ‘cult den’, but at least it was a well decorated cult den.

The chain link fence and weird sculptures weren’t really selling me, though.

I could hear laughter as we walked up to the door, and children squealing with joy. The front step was adorned with a worn welcome mat, with signs on the door proudly declaring it the ‘Home of the Thirteenth Hour’.

And I’ll admit…it did feel like a home, so much so that part of me’s surprised Dad never tried to bring *me* here.

Dad knocked on the large wooden door. The knocks were oddly timed, enough so that I’m almost certain it was some kind of code, and footsteps sounded from inside the building.

The man who answered the door was an older man with greying hair and a kind face that lit up upon seeing my dad. He looked so normal that it was actually offputting -  I mean, who’d expect that this nice old man was a part of all this? I know there’s not exactly a uniform for cultists, and I know appearances can be deceiving, but still. Weird.

“Harry!” he exclaimed, going in for a quick hug with my Dad. “And this must be the Tanya we’ve all heard so much about. It’s so lovely to finally meet you, dear.”

“Uh–you too?” It came out like a question. Which…wasn’t entirely inaccurate to my general mood.

“Come in, come in, both of you.” He gestured us inside. “Father Lucan’s very excited to meet you. We all are.”

Dad put a hand on my shoulder and gave me a smile, and we stepped inside.

If I thought the front step looked homely, the inside is so much *more*. The large room was decorated with warm colours and soft surfaces. Bookshelves adorned the walls, photos of smiling people perched in between the books. The floor was covered in rug after rug, scattered in ways that should’ve looked bad but instead looked…cozy.

Honestly, it’s nicer than most people’s houses.

We - or rather, I - were lead through the halls, up to a large room I’d guess was once a gymnasium but was now set up like a prayer space.

The roof was painted deep blue, and had tiny lights strung up like stars. There were pews, and a podium at the end. A deep blue carpet lined the aisle, accented with gold.

Paintings and tapestries of all different styles lined the walls, and I could recognise enough elements of them from Dad’s stories to know they were for the entities. The Spinner’s web, meat from Mr Fingers, Negentropy’s bone scale…there were more than I could count, in both style and design. Quilts, paintings, drawings, even some sculptures adorned the hall, and no two looked alike.

The more I stared at them, the more it dawned on me that these were done by different people. Different members of the Thirteenth Hour. There were so many of them, echoes at least, all laced through this hall.

Even I had to admit it felt…holy. Like sacred ground.

I realised, then, that a man stood on the pedestal. I’d overlooked him before, instead seeing the tapestries behind him, but he was very much there. He smiled when he saw us, a wide, earnest smile that my dad returned easily.

“Father Lucan,” Dad greeted. I noted a hint of reverence in his voice when he said the man’s name.

The man - Father Lucan - stepped forwards, smile unwavering as he looked at him, then at me. I realised then that he looked…familiar, though I couldn’t place why.

“Harry, good to see you!” Father Lucan said. “And little Tanya - not so little anymore, it seems!”  He laughed, and I forced a laugh too. Did this man know me when I was younger?

“Hello,” I replied, not wanting to be rude. “It’s nice to meet you.” And then, because I wanted to cover all my bases; “I’m sorry if we’ve met before, I…was probably young?”

Thankfully, the man didn’t seem to take offence, laughing again instead. “Yes, you were a lot younger. Just a tiny thing, toddling around after your father! But no one wants to hear an old man talk about knowing them as a baby, you’re not here for that. You’re here for the Thirteenth Hour!”

“Yes, sir.”

Father Lucan tipped his head back and laughed again at that. He seemed to laugh a lot. “Sir! You honour me, but there’s no need. You can call me Father Lucan, or Father, or even just Lucan.”

I was not calling him Lucan. “Alright, um…Father Lucan,” I decided. Didn’t really wanna call him Father either; just a few steps too close to ‘daddy’ in my mind.

He smiled again at that. “Do you like our church, Tanya? Our place of worship?”

“Yes,” I said truthfully. “It’s…beautiful.”

His smile softened at that, and he looked proud. “I’m glad you think so. We have all put a lot of work into this place, over the years.”

“It shows,” I admitted. So much care has gone into this place. I could see it etched into the walls, the paint lines on the ceiling.

“Come, Tanya. Sit.”

He gestured to me, and I realised, then, that Dad had left us, and I was alone in the room with Father Lucan. Some part of me felt like I should be annoyed, but instead, I was just relieved. Easier if Dad isn’t hovering over us.

I walked down that midnight-clad aisle, feeling the worn rug underfoot, running my hand over a pew. It all felt so at odds with what I’d imagined.

I sat, and Father Lucan came down off his pedestal to sit next to me.

“You must have so many questions,” he said. “And fears, too, am I correct?”

“...Yes,” I admitted.

He sighed, though not in a way that sounded disappointed; rather…contemplative.

“We seem strange from the outside, do we not? A church out in the desert, worshipping quiet gods…I’ve heard it all, Tanya. Blasphemers, cultists, lunatics, you name it. Everything you’re thinking I’ve heard many times before. There is so much room for doubt, after all. So much of our faith is unheard, passed on only in the quiet by those of us with enough reverence to sing their song and tell their stories. But where else are we to go if the churches do not want us?”

I was silent, listening to him speak. He had a force to him, an energy. I wanted to keep listening. I wanted to drink in his words and let them fill me up.

“I understand you may be frightened,” he said again. “I want to help you understand that we are not some…wild cult of monsters. We are a family, out here in our home. We worship not unlike that of the churches you likely know, not with sacrifice or moonlit rites.”

Father Lucan didn’t take his eyes off of me the whole time he spoke. It added a weight to each word he said.

“I tell you this because I want you to feel comfortable here. I invite you to take a look around our home - to stay with us for a little while, if you wish, and I’m sure you’ll understand us.” He looked right at me, and smiled as he said, “You don’t have to fear us, Tanya.”

I had to fight to break away from his gaze, looking down to my lap. I felt…almost ashamed, hearing him explain himself. I felt judgemental, cruel, unfair. I was hearing him out, I really was.

They were so close to having me, you know. I thought I knew what I was getting myself into when I came to the compound, but being there in person, hearing Father Lucan speak…I think, if things had been just a little different, I would’ve fallen into it. I would’ve stayed on the path Dad had set for me and spent my days with the Thirteenth Hour: I almost did, for a few days. Bit by bit, they unravelled me.

It helped that it was all so familiar. These figures portrayed in the hall, they weren’t some strange unknown. They were the stories I’d grown up with, and seeing their likeness didn’t even alarm me. Instead it felt like a comfort.

And half of the people there knew me, or at least knew *of* me. It seemed like Dad had talked about me enough that a solid chunk of the cult knew me by both name and face. Honestly, I felt bad for not knowing them back.

When Dad suggested we stay the night, I didn’t reject it. I told myself it was for research.

Don’t get me wrong - there was *no* point in this where I planned on joining their cult. I mean, sure, they probably could’ve managed it. But at no point in my mind did I want to. It was for research. It was to unravel the Thirteenth Hour.

The problem is, I could’ve spent years telling myself that.

At what point is a goal no longer a goal?

Thankfully, I won’t find out. At least not like this. Because things got…weird. I heard something.

For the most part, everything at the stronghold was…nice. Everyone was friendly, the food was good, it was *significantly* less creepy than Dad’s monster basement, though I have a feeling most of that was just behind locked doors. I spent days wandering the grounds and the building, as well as trying to find out more about their church.

From what they’ve told me, if I take it as the truth, this place is just one of a whole line of cults, all of whom worshipped these ‘gods’. Some of them chose a specific patron, whereas some, like the Thirteenth Hour, acted as a ‘neutral party’, worshipping all of the entities equally. Their practice, I was told, went back hundreds of years, but had always been very hush-hush and ill-received by society. So they group together in places like this.

Honestly, hearing this freaked me out a little bit. I’d always assumed the stories Dad told me were something he’d made up. Hearing that there were others out there who believed this, others who may have grown up like me? Well, it was a lot to take in. Still is.

I asked Dad about the Chorus. I mean, I had to, right? She was something of a rogue element in all this; I knew about all the other ones, but I knew next to *nothing* about this so-called Chorus.

Luckily, Dad was very willing to explain.

The Chorus, he told me, had once been like the other entities. She had lived in both worlds, merged with ours on her day of power, and guided humanity forwards. She was, as Dad said, the beacon for our species. A guiding light.

But it went too far. Humanity became reliant on her, and too advanced. He said we’d ‘undone them’.

So the other entities sent her away, back to the place that they all came from. They removed her day of power, and in time, the world forgot. 

“But humans *need* the Chorus, Tanya,” Dad told me. “We’ve become destructive. Humanity is falling into chaos without its herald. Corruption, poverty, war, she could stop all of it. So we’re bringing her back.”

…Look, maybe they’re right about some of this shit. Humanity isn’t doing great for itself, but I don’t think that whatever they’re doing will fix it. It *can’t*, not without entirely removing people’s abilities to hurt and destroy, but…I mean, isn’t that by nature going to remove free will?

Even if these gods *do* exist - and I’ve heard enough at this point to, unfortunately, believe that - bringing them here in their entirety isn’t going to fix it. Hell, if anything, I think it’d make it worse. Some of the stories Dad told me weren’t just whimsical tales about far-off adventure. Some of them were sick and twisted; saved for when I was old enough not to cry at the sheer notion of it.

I don’t want them to have true bodies. I don’t want them to be real.

But…one of them spoke to me. *She* spoke to me.

I know they’re real.

I found the trapdoor more by chance than anything else. It was hidden well, under the carpet of a musty first floor office that seemed to be being used more for storage than anything else. Once I’d opened the door and seen the cardboard boxes and piles of old books, I almost didn’t bother checking it further, assuming it to be nothing more than a place for old junk.

In the end, I only stepped in because I saw an old, tattered copy of Pride and Prejudice that I wanted to have a look at. Honestly, the room didn’t look like it’d been used in a while: I figured no one would mind if I borrowed it, so I hopped inside and, manoeuvring around some of the more inconvenient boxes, headed for the stack.

…I fell. I’ll admit it, I fell over. I tripped on some battered metal thing and ate it into the carpet, all the air leaving my lungs, arms flying out in front of me and feeling the start of what turned out to be a hell of a carpet burn.. I’m lucky I didn’t knock a box onto my head to really complete the experience.

I groaned, picking myself back up as best as I could. I sat on the carpet, trying to get my breath back, and as I did, I noticed the shift in the carpet. It looked like a trick of the light at first, a shadow making the ground look layered, but no.

Instead, near where I’d fallen, the carpet had been knocked away from the floor, just a little. It was like someone had cut a square patch of the carpet out and just…left it there, until my fall knocked it out of place. Honestly, I assumed it was just some quirk of the old building.

Intending to put it back, I slid my fingers under the misplaced carpet and froze, fingers feeling a cool metal hinge.

I pulled the carpet back, then, heart-rate already speeding up. I’d gotten too comfortable in that old school. My heart had forgotten what I was here for, and a thrill shot through me as I pulled back that carpet and saw a trapdoor.

It wasn’t even locked. Maybe it had been, once, and it just rusted - it’s hard to say. All I know is that when I pulled at it, it opened. Loudly and screechily, but it opened. I’m lucky all the shit in the room served as pretty good noise absorption.

It was dark down there. The lights above me cast a little light in, but all I could really see was cold concrete a few meters below me before the darkness pressed in too closely. An old ladder stretched down, and, despite my reservations, I braced myself to climb it.

I turned my phone’s torch on and put it in my bra. The light would be inconsistent, but it would only be while my hands were occupied and hey, it was better than nothing.

I took a deep breath, nodded to myself, and began to slowly lower myself into the darkness, guided only by the half-blocked light I’d given myself and trying my best to ignore the spiderwebs I felt underhand.

It was no less dusty and dreary down there, but at least I could hold my phone properly. I shone the light around the room, revealing metallic walls and dirty concrete, all covered by cobwebs and layer upon layer of dust.

Going in deeper was a dumb idea. I knew that at the time and I know it now. But I’d searched most of the building already, and couldn’t for the life of me find any signs of whatever they were working on. So if that creepyass tunnel could lead me to somewhere I wasn’t meant to access? Well, I was taking my chances. Worst case, I could find my way back by following the path of disturbed dust.

It was dark down there, and oppressive. The metal walls felt like they were closing in, and I could hardly go thirty seconds without sneezing from all the dust. Best I can figure, they were some kind of maintenance tunnel for when the school was functional - I did see pipes, sometimes - though that didn’t make me feel any better.

I would’ve almost thought that no one ever came down here…except, as I wove my way through the labyrinth, I came upon another line of disturbed dust. 

I thought I’d gone in a circle for a moment, and was about to curse my luck when I realised that the trails didn’t match. Where I’d left footsteps and the occasional line, this looked more like a snail trail, thick and worn.

Other people had come that way.

I felt a thrill at the realisation, setting myself onto the path. I figured that if I kept following it, surely I’d end up somewhere less abandoned.

I was right, and after less than a minute, I found myself in front of a metal door.

I say it was metal because it was. But it wasn’t the same rusted metal that made up parts of the hall - this was a new steel, newer at least, and locked with a gently glowing keypad.

I didn’t have to worry about the lock, at least: a quick glance over it revealed that it hadn’t been cleaned in a while, and I only had to find the clean patches to get the numbers. After that, it was only a matter of trying the most likely combinations and hoping there wasn’t some kind of limit on wrong tries.

I got it on my third.

I cracked open the door and was immediately met with lights so stark and clinical they almost blinded me. I flinched back into the darkness for a moment, trying to plan my next move. There was nowhere to hide in the pale hall, short of ducking into one of the many doors that were almost certainly locked. What if someone saw me? What would I even say?

In the end, curiosity won over fear and I stepped out into the corridor. I didn’t really want to stay in the dusty maintenance tunnels anyway.

There was no one in the halls, nor any sign of that changing. There was a camera, though, up in the corner, and I found myself deeply hoping it wasn’t monitored live. I guess it wasn’t, or I wouldn’t be here writing this.

The corridor hit a T junction. I started to turn right…then heard the faintest voice coming from the left.

I froze, but I still couldn’t see anyone, so I figured they had to be in one of the rooms.

All the doors in the hallway, save for a few, were numbered and windowed. If I was careful and quiet, I could creep down the hallway and take a peek.

…It was stupid, but I did it anyway.

It wasn’t too hard to locate the room - it was the only one with lights on inside. The noise was still muffled, even up close, and I couldn’t quite make out what they were saying.

I could see, though. I don’t know why they didn’t make the windows frosted. I don’t know why they even had windows. Maybe they *wanted* an audience. I don’t think they saw me, though.

The room was clinical white, like the hallway, though the walls of this room were covered with symbols and what I thought might be blood.

In the room stood two figures: Father Lucan, and a man in a coat I didn’t recognise. They stood in front of a metallic chair, and in it sat a woman.

I didn’t recognise her, either. My best guess is that she’s one of the cultists. She was strapped into that chair by her ankles, fully naked and covered head to toe in bloody symbols. Her head was tipped back towards the ceiling, and her arms were held aloft by metal cords.

Despite all this, she didn’t seem in any way distressed. The look on her face wasn’t one of fear, and I saw her lips forming words, too quiet to hear but peaceful enough that I didn’t think it was a plea or a cry for help.

I think it might’ve been a prayer.

As I watched, Father Lucan walked to the other side of her and injected her with something. Her entire body convulsed, and both men began to chant.

I couldn’t make out the words, but I *know* it was a chant. It was rhythmic and bold, and it kept getting louder. The woman started to shake violently, like she was having some kind of seizure. The marks on her arms began to turn a burning red.

I felt a ringing in my ears and a dryness in my throat as she began to scream.

Their chanting got even louder, then, and I could almost make out some words through the screaming.

*Our lady… … bless … vessel … take it … Chorus!*

*Chorus!*

The ringing in my ears grew louder, and the woman shook more and more violently. I felt my breath catch in my throat as I saw a thin trail of blood beginning to flow from her eyes, then her nose, then her mouth. Her eyes were wide open, and through the blood beginning to pool, I saw her eyes light up a brilliant glowing gold.

The chant reached its crescendo, and the woman screamed and convulsed. One of her arms snapped inwards at an unnatural angle as she fought violently against whatever pain was destroying her.

And it *was* destroying her. She started to froth, and she started to buck. I wanted to scream at them to stop it, to stop hurting her, but all I could do was stand there in horror as she wailed and bled and -

She bucked again, and when she did, I heard - a noise.

To call it a noise is a serious, serious understatement. It hit me in a wave, crashing into me and pulling me under and all I could hear was *screamingwhisperingtalkingcryinglaughing,* skin on skin and the last breath of a man and the beat of a heart and the cry of a newborn and -

I’m sorry. It was just so much and even *thinking* about it overwhelms me. I know that no matter how hard I try, I’ll never be able to describe that noise in a way that’s true.

I think I heard *everyone*.

I mean *everyone* \- every person who ever lived and ever will live, all together, but not in a way that drowned each other out. Even within the rush, I could still hear each and every individual sound and it was *incredible* and frightening, and over in an instant.

Within a heartbeat, the noise passed through me and all I could hear was a silence so loud I wondered if I’d gone deaf.

A second later, though, I heard the muffled voices from inside the door. That at least told me that I wasn’t deafened.

Father Lucan and the other man stepped towards the woman. She’d gone completely limp and silent, all the markings on her body turned dull and all the gold in her eyes gone.

There was nothing in her eyes. Even if I hadn’t seen it, however, I still would’ve known she was dead. She just…wasn’t there anymore.

I was shaking at this point, obviously, and somewhere in my mind, the reasonable part of me thought that, since whatever horrible thing they were doing was over, they might try to leave the room.

All and all, though, I just wanted to run. And reason agreed.

So I ran - or at least power-tiptoed - back to the door I’d come in through. I didn’t even think to worry about finding the right one until I was already safely back in the tunnels and the problem had passed.

I tried to head back out, but I was fumbling too hard to get my phone light out, and my legs were so weak I was scared I’d fall over. So I stumbled just a little bit deeper into the tunnels before collapsing against a wall.

I don’t know how long I sat there for. Distantly, some part of me worried that I might be in shock. But that part was drowned out by memories of the screaming, of the way her body twitched and spasmed as Father Lucan just watched and chanted. Of the way she went limp and lifeless.

And the noise.

I hadn’t thought about why they called her Chorus until then. I hadn’t given any of their names much thought, I mean, some of them are pretty obvious, right? The Huntress, Lady End, the Blind…I’d never even thought about Chorus.

But…that’s what it was. It was a chorus - a cacophony of everything, and somehow it still sounded *nice*. It sounded like every happy memory and every sad one and every – 

…It was the voice of humanity.

It was the Chorus.

There could’ve been other explanations, of course; some kind of panic attack or something brought on by stress. Shock from what I was seeing causing some kind of audible hallucination.

It wasn’t, though. I know it wasn’t.

Because as I sat in that hallway, head in my hands, I heard a voice.

Heard is the word I use, but it was more like I felt it. It entered my head just like a thought, but it wasn’t a thought, not mine at least. It probed at my mind with curiosity and what might have been wariness, though it’s possible that one was my own. It pressed and it sought, and the second it did, I felt that voice in my mind.

She said ‘*You heard me*.’

Then the pressure was gone, and I was once again alone in the dirty tunnels.

It took me a while to stand up again. I don’t know how long - I wasn’t checking the time. But 

eventually I did manage to drag myself to my feet and follow my footsteps back to the trapdoor entrance.

I took a shower, then another longer one. I was barely thinking at all, and the rest of the evening is a bit of a blur. I think I gathered my wits enough to lie to Dad that I was tired and a little overwhelmed, and he suggested we go home for a bit. I *readily* agreed.

We went home. I locked myself in my room, and I guess eventually I fell asleep, because I know I dreamed of her.

She didn’t have a body, not really. She was more of a concept than she was anything physical. But if I focused hard enough, I could almost imagine the face of a woman, with gentle features and flowing red hair.

She said, ‘*I didn’t want her to die.*”

She said, ‘*They made me*.’

I didn’t sleep very well last night.

The dreams could’ve been nothing, but I don’t know if I believe that.

I…I don’t…

What do I even *do* with this?

Does Dad know about what they’re doing down there? He has to, right? But - but would he really let that happen to someone? I know he’s making monsters, but that’s a *long* way from murder. Maybe…maybe he doesn’t know.

I don’t know. I just don’t want to think that my Dad, who raised me on his own and always tried to do what was best for me, could do something so awful. Because if that’s true, then who am I trying to save? What am I doing all of this for?

No - no, I have to believe that he doesn’t know. I have to believe that or I’ll lose my mind.

I’m going to have to leave my room eventually. Dad doesn’t know I’m up yet, but I can’t stay in bed all day or he’ll worry. But I don’t know what to say or how to act, especially if I’m trying to act normal.

I want to hug my dad. I want to hug him and cry and to have him tell me that everything’s going to be okay.

But I can’t. And there’s no one else I can tell.

No one would believe me.

…I’m going back to bed.

\--

It’s been a few hours. Dad was worried, I was rattled, I lied. I told him that I was overwhelmed, that part was true. I told him there was nothing wrong, and that was a lie. I said I’d be fine tomorrow.

I wasn’t fine tomorrow, now today. I don’t feel well at all: my stomach hurts, I’m tired, I’m shivery…I don’t know if it’s an aftereffect of the shock or just a cold or flu, but it does have the advantage of Dad assuming that an oncoming cold was why I was acting so off.

I’m still dreaming of Chorus.

I wish…

I don’t know.

I woke up with marks on my wrist today.

This shouldn’t be weird, except I’m still dreaming of her. Every night, I dream of her: she’s clearer in the dreams, with long crimson hair and a kind face that seems to shift from time to time. She tries to talk to me. I try not to listen.

Today she grabbed my wrist as I turned away. Her nails dug into my skin.

I woke up with small crescents where her fingers closed.

What’s happening to me?

*You heard me*, she says.

*You heard me.*

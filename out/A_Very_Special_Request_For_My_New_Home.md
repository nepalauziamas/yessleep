as i have had multiple failed attempts at the situation, i would be interested in retrying, i have a particular interest in living in people's attics without them knowing and would be excited to begin my journey, i would like to stay in a small home, with an attic of course, and a good price, i would also like to be able to get out at night, and dont worry, i have stopped recording people during their more private moments. i lurk in the walls, the crawlspace, the cupboard under the stairs. i will get my own food from your fridge and i will try not to be too aggressive, i won't record you having sex either, i will not be violent towards any guests you have over, and i will try to stay as hidden as possible, look out for the eyes in the vent.

i will move around in the night, look around, have some fun, when you are at work, i will make my food, wash, clean up after myself too, you don't need to worry, i am not one of those phroggers who piss in their victim's sinks, fuck with their heads and worry them sick, i will treat the home well, you don't need to worry about that! i of course care about you too, after all, i am paying you, 

God is watching from the celling. 

i will be leaving after a few days though, i won't bother you, and i will bring my own equipment, i am your phrogger

do not let the police in, do not ask questions about the things i like to do, i will be gone soon enough,

i will want to be heading out next sunday, and will arrive at your residence on monday, i will not bring  a car, and i will enter quickly and not speak to you, i do like to have a bit of fun during my outings though,  

i began doing these things when i realised home invasions were not enough for me, and i enjoyed observing the owners, listening into their conversations, noting their schedules down, casing their house, absorbing their lives.

maybe one day i will try this out for real

break into the owner's home, setup camp in the attic

observe their habits, it would be fascinating, and a great way to spend a few weeks, i could make them think they are going loopy!

move things around, switch the order of the cups and swap kitchen silverware around, turn their lights on, break their electronics... maybe not that far, but still, thats whats so fun about these things, i can do anything, and listen to the victims react. 

after the fun, of course, i would have to leave though

so when i move onto my next house, maybe i will be a little more skilled at this technique

&#x200B;

avoid lighting candles, dont go near walls, listen for the scraping

so if anyone is interested, please reach out, i will pay good money to make your attic my new home!

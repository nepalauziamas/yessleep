Every fiber of my being is begging me to hop in my car and drive home, and honestly, I probably would have, job be damned- but I know my keys are sitting on the stupid desk inside that stupid cabin. I turn the doorknob slowly, praying to every god I can think of that no one’s inside, and cursing my stupid, pot addled brain that I didn’t think to lock the door behind me when I left. I spend a second debating if I should have my rifle at the ready, but decide against it. I can throw a decent punch, but I’ll be useless against an attack if I’m already holding something this wieldy. 

I open the door slowly, bracing myself for whatever’s inside to jump me, but I’m greeted by an empty room. I hurry to lock the door behind me and close the curtains again. At this point, I don’t care if anyone’s exploring Patrick’s land, I’m fully planning on staying in here until morning- and I’m already pulling up job postings on my phone, so I can quit this one as soon as the sun comes up. 

Despite my best instincts to look away, I can’t help but glance up at the monitors in front of me. My blood runs cold. The man is somehow, inexplicably, still there- still standing, totally motionless, in the middle of the very same trail, as if he hasn’t moved at all. I’m almost pressing my face to the screen, trying to make out something, anything, about the figure I’m seeing, but his features are too blurred and far away. He’s perfectly still, too still, and that’s when it dawns on me- the image must be frozen! I’m flooded with relief, and a little bit of annoyance. So, maybe I can’t explain the curtain thing, but this, at least, makes sense. Patrick’s gone over how to reset the cams, and I start the process of rebooting the system, taking a second to rummage through my bag for my stash. 

By the time the monitor is back up and running, the cabin is hazy with smoke, and I’m trying to forget the events of the night. After 10 applications to various chain restaurants and gas stations in the area, I’m back to feeling like maybe this gig isn’t so bad- the pay is weirdly good for how little I *actually* do, and I’m watching dumb videos on YouTube when I decide not to quit, yet. I glance up to see if the camera is functioning again, and to my immense relief, all I see is a view of a once again empty trail. 

The rest of the night is uneventful, and when the sun finally comes up, I’m happy to hop in my car and head home to get some sleep. 

I live with one other person, my friend Todd from high school. We both grew up about 2 hours away from here, and went to college in town. Todd’s a semester away from graduating, with a degree in chemistry or some shit. He’s the smartest idiot I know. 

Todd seems like he’s still asleep when I get home, but I know his first class starts at 10, and he’ll be awake soon, so I start a pot of coffee for him before I head to the shower. Our cat, Cleo, blinks at me lazily from her tree in the living room, and I stop to scoop her some more food and change her water. 

The hot water takes the chill out of me, and once I’m in clean, comfy pajamas, cartoons on TV and a bong in my hands, the night before seems almost silly, and I’m weirdly excited for Todd to wake up so I can tell him about it. He comes out of his room when I start coughing, his hair an absolute mess, sporting a pair of Spongebob boxers and nothing else.

“Samwise, Samus, Sammy, how is my favorite nightcrawler?” he yawns. Seeing the hot coffee, he beams, “Spoiling your favorite roomie, as usual, I see.” While he pours himself a cup, I pack a fresh bowl for us to share before he heads out for the day.

“I had, finally, officially, a wild night,” I tell him, and he settles into the couch next to me. 

“Oh?”

“Could you hear the screaming in the woods from here, or did I get the privilege of being scared shitless alone?” I ask teasingly, and he takes the bong from me for a long hit, but stops at my question.

Through labored coughing, Todd looks up at me, incredulous, “Screaming? Excuse me?”

I regale him with the story of my night while he gets ready, eager to hear what he thinks of the whole thing.

He emerges from the bathroom, purple toothbrush hanging from his mouth, “And you’re totally sure it wasn’t, like, a bird or something? Or that old guy you work for? What did he answer?”

“That’s the thing,” I reply, “He didn’t. The dude probably barely knows how to work his cell phone. He prefers people to call his landline, if you can believe that. If I wouldn’t for sure get cursed out for it, I’d ask him if he heard the sound, too, but unless someone’s underage drinking or, like, littering on his land, he couldn’t give less of a fuck.” 

Todd shakes his head, “And you’re just cool with that? Cause you know the Olive Garden on campus is hiring, and that host we always see is pretty cute-”

I laugh, cutting him off, “Look, man, maybe this is one of those things you just don’t read into that much. I may not be some honor roll chemist-” Todd throws a t-shirt at my head from the hallway. “But I know when I’ve got it made. I get paid to watch tv and smoke all night. I’m finally caught up on the bills I’ve owed you. If that means a homeless dude fucks with me every so often, I guess that’s cool, alright?”

He doesn’t look entirely convinced, but after hastily grabbing some poptarts out of the cupboard, Todd wishes me goodnight and heads off to class, and I settle into bed, making sure my blackout curtains are in place for a good day’s sleep. 

My alarm wakes me up at 4, and I stumble to the kitchen to make myself some… breakfast? Dinner? Being nocturnal gives you a strange eating schedule, so I settle on an omelet and half a pb&j while I watch TV. 

The day passes quickly, and Todd gets home as I’m leaving for work. He wishes me good luck as I head out, my usual backpack of snacks and weed in hand.

Patrick’s old pickup is in the driveway of the cabin when I pull in, and I wonder if I’ll get some answers about last night. He’s sitting at the desk when I walk in, scowling as usual. 

“You heard the shrieking, kid?” he snaps as I get settled in.

“Yeah, I did,” I tell him, “You wanna explain what that was?”

He chuckles, his eyes scanning the monitors. In daylight, the trails look like any other nature reserve, a beautiful place to hike and explore. “No, kid, I don’t. Not really, anyway. I told you, these woods are dangerous. Could be a vixen, calling for her mate, could be some kind of screech owl.” He starts to laugh a little harder, “Or, of course, it could be an axe murderer. You never know.”

I fake a laugh with him. “Is that why you texted me to close the curtains?”

Patrick freezes. “What?”

“Last night? You texted me something was watching, and told me to close the curtains?” 

The old man shakes his head slowly. “Texted you? Kid, I don’t have a cell phone. You know I just have the landline.”

Now it’s my turn to freeze. “No, come on Patrick, look.” I pull my cell phone out to show him the messages, including the first text I’d gotten like two weeks ago, simply saying ‘It’s Patrick.’ “You’re telling me this isn’t you?” 

Patrick’s face seems to pale. “Kid, I’m telling you, I don’t have a cell phone. I have no idea who that is.”

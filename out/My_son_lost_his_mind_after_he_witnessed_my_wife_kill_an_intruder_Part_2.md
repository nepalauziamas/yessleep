When I heard the news of the home invasion half an hour later, I was in complete shock. Not only had Andrea and Marcus been victims of a home invasion, but Andrea had also killed someone. And our son had seen it happen. Hell, he had even been showered by the remnants of the invader. 

After hearing this news, I immediately left work and began the hour long drive home, driving faster than I probably should have. My wife and son had just been a part of what I would consider a nightmare-level event, and I needed to get back to them as soon as possible. 

I arrived home in 47 minutes and was first greeted by a swarm of police cars still present in front of my house. I parked my car in the street behind the police cars and rushed over to comfort my wife and son who were busy talking to a police officer. I could see how visibly shaken my wife was, but she still managed to keep her composure far better than I would have been able to do. Marcus on the other hand. . . He was extremely pale and not just visibly shaken, but still visibly shaking. I couldn’t possibly imagine the mental trauma he was currently going through. 

I pulled them both into a big hug, tight with relief. The officer nodded to me and gave us some space. I didn’t know any words that could possibly bring mental relief to them, so I just stood there hugging them.

It was about 5 minutes before I finally pulled away. 
“Everything will be okay,” I said, barely believing the words myself. “I can find us some place to stay for a while during the. . . cleanup.” Andrea nodded and pull us all back into another long hug while barely containing her sobs. 
“I hope so.”

I stuck right by their sides as they answered more questions from the police officers, before they were finally finished with us.

I had called my parents, and they invited us over to stay for a few months or until we were comfortable returning back to our house. To be honest, I didn’t think we would ever go live there again. It would just be too much for Andrea and Marcus, having to live in the house where a man was murdered by her hands. 

My parents only lived 15 minutes away, so we left as soon as possible. I went into the house to grab as many supplies as I could carry. I tried not to look at the massive bloodstain on the carpet. I couldn’t help but think about how my wife had done that. I tried to think about how it had saved her and Marcus’s life, but it couldn’t completely eliminate the feeling that she would never be the same person.

My parents were waiting anxiously in their yard when we pulled up to their house. They rushed over and pulled Marcus and Andrea into another big hug and whispered comforting words to the two of them. I joined the hug and graciously thanked them for allowing us to stay with them for a while. 
“Stay as long as you need,” my mom told me before helping bring in our few belongings I had been able to get. 

———————————————

My son had never been the most popular kid in school. He tended to keep to himself and struggled to interact with other students. All around, he was just sort of socially awkward. After Nero’s death, it only became worse. 

For the first five days, he left his room in my parent’s house only to go to the bathroom. He wouldn’t even come down for dinner. As much as Andrea tried to talk to him, he would barely open the door, and when he let her in, he barely even talked. All of us, including his grandparents were greatly worried about him and what he must be going through mentally. 

When he finally emerged from his room on the sixth day, we were all surprised. Andrea tried to treat him as normally as possible, but he only came out to tell us one thing. 
“I still see him.”
And that was all. He went straight back to his room after this comment.

Andrea and I were in shock. He still saw him. Nero. It had been almost a week and Marcus was staying alone in his room, likely hiding from vision of Nero and his shredded corpse. 

Andrea and I tried again to no avail to talk to him and comfort him. We collectively came to the conclusion that we should take him to a therapist. I called up a highly rated therapist, and she agreed to come to the house and try to talk to Marcus. 

When she arrived the next day, Andrea filled her in on what Marcus was going through and what he had said. She conveyed a strong sense of experience and professionalism and nodded understandingly to our descriptions. She was only in her early 30’s but I could tell she knew what she was doing. 

We lead her to Marcus’s room and left her with him for an hour long session. When the session was over, she came down to the kitchen table where we were waiting nervously and filled us in on everything that they had been able to talk about.

“He told me that he sees this Nero everywhere. He says there is no escape from these visions,” she reported sadly. “Everywhere in his room and every night in his dreams.”
“How can we help him? He won’t even talk to us,” replied Andrea. I squeezed her hand reassuringly. 
“Well,” replied the therapist, “I’d recommend taking him out into a public area. Get him exposed back into the real world.”

We took her advice the next day, and I managed to convince Marcus to go to the park with me and Andrea and both my parents. 

The park was busy, and I worried that it might be too much for Marcus who had been alone for a week now. 

I was right. His face was back to the deathly white it had been right after the home invasion, and his limbs were visibly tense. Something was clearly very wrong. 

“Hey,” I said to him. “Are you okay.”
He looked at me and I could see how shaken he was. 
“What’s wrong?”
He shook his head. “Please take me back. I see him in everyone. Everywhere - It’s just him - covered in blood. Just like when he died.”
Andrea grabbed his hand and began to pull him back towards the car, but he wasn’t done speaking yet. He turned directly towards his mother and looked at her with a dead expression. “I see him in you.”

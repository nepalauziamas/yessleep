A couple months ago I went on a 2 week camping trip with four of my high school friends. We backpacked up a trail then set up our tents and just talked for awhile. After we got everything set up we decided to hike down to a small running river a quarter mile from our camp. While the four of us were heading down there we heard noises, nothing out of the ordinary, bushes moving and other sounds that we just chalked up to be wild animals. After we made it down to the river we took some pictures then joked around for a couple minutes. One of my friends pointed something out across the river. It was a large uprooted tree pushed up against a rocky large mountain that had created a sort of underpass cave. Being dumbass teenagers we walked through the river and over to the large tree. It wasn't anything out of the ordinary, just an uprooted tree that an animal probably lived in. We left then started back on the trail to go back to our camp. We got a little turned around then ended up on a different trail that we didn't recognize. We all began to panic and all started joking about the Blair witch project and how we were gonna die out there.

After walking on that trail for a little we ended up a very weird old trash ground with a bunch of garage and old junk including an rusting jeep and a lot of other scrap metal. Behind some of the bushes were a small house, now we didn't look at it but once we got to this area we heard a weird howl. I'm pretty sure my friend shit himself. We immediately thought wolves were coming for us so we bolted out of there not before taking a [Picture](https://imgur.com/a/AzNdsOP). We found our trail back to the campsite and were all on edge and very creeped out from the wolves howl we heard. My friends all assumed it was gray wolves but the howl didn't sound like a howl, it was like a cry, which I also chalked up to be an injured wolf. One of my friends was ready to get the hell out of here and drive home but I really didn't feel like it. We weren't too far from a small populated town so we figured if we wanted to we could go and probably find a motel to stay for night. The rest of us were committed to staying the night and we told him he could go if he wanted to but he'd have to walk since we wanted to keep the car and told him it wouldn't be good for us to be out here alone without any way of getting back.

We decided there was nothing left to really do since the sun was setting so we lit a campfire and just talked for awhile. About halfway through we heard another cry/howl coming from the woods near us, it was louder this time and longer. My friend who wanted to leave jumped up then hauled ass back to the car. I would be lying if I said we didn't do the same. We swiped out stuff except for the tents and my other friend dumped some water over the fire to not start a forest fire. We sprinted after him then bolted into the car. At the point I didn't care where we stayed so I drove off with the intention of heading straight home. We drove for about an hour then got to a small motel, we were all too tired to drive and didn't wanna risk a car accident so we booked 2 rooms and stayed at the motel trying to ease our anxiety. We all got to sleep pretty easily with I found shocking since I have a hard time sleeping. Around 4am I woke up and got up to go take a piss, after I did I went back over to my bed. After I laid back down I tried to get back to sleep but then...  I heard the howl again. My friend who was sleeping in there bed next to me shot up then stared at me and asked if I heard that as well. I hopped out of bed then peaked out the window next to me, I didn't see anything but I wasn't getting back to sleep. I didn't wanna leave the room so I called my other friends staying in the room next to us trying to wake them up. Turns out they were already awake and also heard the howl. We really didn't care what we did at this point so we once again grabbed our stuff then all ran to the car.

We drove away and I was wide awake at this point so I was fine with driving all the way back. At this point I was convinced it wasn't wolves since there was no way they would follow us all this way. I didn't know if driving away was a good option or if this thing would us. I a lot of detours and turns which ended up adding an extra half out to the drive. We made it back at about 6:30 and were all still shook about what had happened. I dropped my friends back at their houses then drove back to my house and tried to get some sleep. We went on with out lives and went back to school still very uneasy for the next couple of weeks. Whatever followed us we must've lost it because none of us have seen or heard it since.

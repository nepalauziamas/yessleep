 

October 29th, 2018.

It    was one day before Halloween - The day before I found out what I'd    done. Honest to God, I wish I could forget what I came to know, but what    I discovered must be shared. Perhaps it'd be a weight off of my back,    the knowledge that I'm not the only one who knows.

On    October 29th, 2018, I unearthed knowledge that people have been   seeking  all their lives. Possibly the biggest question of them all.

I'm    both terrified and saddened by what I know now. Most people would   think  if you discovered something so important you would be ecstatic,   but  this is different.

To anyone   who  is reading this, you're probably curious. You probably want to  know  what  question I've finally found the answer to.

Well, I know what's after death.

I    took part in an experiment called "The White Angel" - TWA for short.    TWA was a very secretive operation run by a group of scientists and    doctors I believed worked for the government. They searched for people    with low income and asked them to join their experiment for large    amounts of cash.

The only catch? We could lose our lives.

I    didn't care. I don't have much family as is and I really needed the    money as I'd recently lost my job. So, I agreed to do as they said, and    on October 29th, 2018 I took part in their experiment.

There    were at least 20 other people taking part in the experiment. The plan    was to have our hearts stopped then started back up a couple of  minutes   later. We would then describe what we experienced or felt.

They    walked me to a table. I lay down, and they stuck a needle into my arm    pumping a strange black liquid into it. A couple of minutes later,    everything started to fade to black. I soon departed from the world we    know.

When I woke up, I found I    was standing in a place of fire and brimstone. I was so horrified:  there   were people around me naked walking towards a door made out of  bones  in  front of me. I followed the crowd hesitantly.

When I came closer to the door, I saw there was text located above it.

It    read, "Lasciate ogne speranza, voi ch'intrate" a phrase I recognized    clearly from my school days. "Abandon all hope, ye who enter here."

I finally knew where I was. Hell. I accepted my fate walking through the gates only to find a city of the damned.

A    strange red liquid rained from the sky - One that burned my skin on    contact and stained a deep crimson. Those around me seemed not to be    bothered by it seemingly used to the hellish substance. This liquid    stained each and everyone it touched, creating a melancholy army of    wanderers with demonic red skin.

I    could hear screams from ahead. The sounds of so many poor souls    screaming made me feel as if my eardrums were going to rupture. Even tho    their screams did not stop it seemed as if my ears began to get used   to  the pain.

There seemed to be    people not entering the gate and I could hear people asking them what    lies ahead. I heard them answer "Satan's Kingdom".

I    stood there for a while looking ahead past the souls of the damned.    They all were marching towards what looked to be a city. It looked to  be   made of fire and brimstone.

I joined the others and walked forth towards the city.

The place shook as if there were massive earthquakes happening but I discovered it was something worst.

Close nearby the city Colossus sized beings were roaming the fiery wasteland crushing and destroying anything in their path.

I    made sure to stay out of their way and i finally made it to what   people  called "Satan's Kingdom" and it is a place I called my home for a   long  time.

The Things I've Done In Hell

I've    done a lot of bad things in my life so I knew this is where I    belonged.I made money not In an average way. I scammed people and would    time to time steal from people just to be able to support my self    because it was hard to get even a little bit of cash.

When    I entered the inferno I entered the city of the damned also known as    Satan's Kingdom. In a place ruled by hells creatures, you have to  learn   how to survive quickly and how to protect your self.

I    lived in hell for four centuries I know that seems like a lot of time    which it is but Hell is a lot weirder than anyone could think. You   don't  get bored or go insane. The place seems to have a mind of its   own. It  constantly wants you to be afraid and in pain, so the last   thing it  wants from you is to forget the feeling of torment. This made   being  there worst. When I first entered the city I expected to be  taken  away  forced into a place to forever be tortured but it was  different.

The   City of the  damned is a place full of creatures living In hell and   normal people.  Not normal in the sense of being civilized. The most   civilized thing  you can encounter in hell is someone not bashing someone   else's head  in.

I questioned why   people  would hurt each other if there was no one trying to hurt us   besides  the hell creatures walking around. Why would we attack each   other for  eternity making our new lives torture in this fiery wasteland?   I found  out why quickly. In hell, there is a kill ranking system for a    certain amount of people you kill the higher you rank up making you    stronger. Randomly after killing any number of people you have the    chance for your body to kind of like mutate. This would allow you to be    able to fight easier or make your stay in hell easier.

We    don't just kill to get stronger, we kill because killing is freedom.    Every kill gives the people of hell relief because they are closer to    their goal. That goal is the ability to be reincarnated and to live a    happy life on earth. Instead of spending eternity in pain and  suffering.   When you hit that certain amount of kills you get a deal.  Stay in hell   and help rule or reincarnate. The person who gives you  this deal is a   god. No, not the devil because in the world there is a  god but he is  not  a God of love but the opposite.

Once    I found out about this I learned to fight and how to become a killing    machine. My goal was reincarnation. In hell everyone is all around  the   same age usually in their 20s I believe it's to help people fight.  I   know it seems weird that hell would do this but I believe it's to  make   it so everyone has the chance to fight because that's what the  place   craves.

It took me a  couple of   years there to learn to fight I died countless times. Every  time I'd die   I would wake up at those gates and be forced to walk back  into the   city.

You do not need  food in hell   which causes people to be irritated because we still have  the feeling   of hunger. Starvation can make people go crazy I've seen  people   cannibalize to try to stop the endless feeling of hunger. I am  ashamed   to say that I tried it once before. There are no rules in  hell, no   punishments because being there is the punishment. Which  means there is   no judgment for the things you do. No one to tell you  right from wrong.

Due   to me  being only 5"5, I am good at being silent and unnoticed. In a   place  full of pain and people looking out to kill for the power it   helped me  out a lot. There are groups in hell for example murderers.   People  that were already good at killing before getting here have it   easier  than more than half of the people who arrive here. No matter what    everyone comes here and with their knowledge, they group up with  people   like them to slaughter countless people for fun. Not to come  back to   live again, just to cause pain.

The    only way to reincarnate is to kill so I joined one of these groups. I    helped kill hundreds of people I learned to use my size as an  advantage   and used it to sneak up on people and attack them. After  maybe 20   something years there I mutated. I had gained the ability to  climb walls   and ill tell you this mutating is not something you cant  feel. You  feel  as if your whole body is on fire from the inside. I can  tell you  this  it hurts like a bitch but in this place, I have  experienced worst.  The  ability to climb walls helped me be sneakier in  the city I could  catch  people looking to hide off guard and attack.

This    gave me the nickname Spider. I was known around the city of the   damned.  My new skills helped me slaughter hundreds of people I feel bad   and I  don't at the same time because there is no right or wrong   because we are  all striving for the same goal.

In    hell you have to embrace the inferno you are thrown into. You learn  to   accept the things you have done and adapt to the world you are  thrown   into. I learned to enjoy my work and embraced the name "Spider"  and the   act of killing. I challenged my self to become better  depending on the   person I'd try not to use a weapon like a sharp stone  and stuff. I  used  my fists to attack my enemies mastering the way of  hand to hand  combat.

I am not proud of the thing's I have done in hell but it was the only way I could escape.

I've Walked Through the Valley of Death - I Don't Fear It's Evil

In    my time in hell, I've walked through the valley of death and I don't    fear its evil, I embrace it. A scary thing about hell is how much it    opens your eyes. Views on life can change in the matter of an instance,    you learn that you should valley your own life over others.

People refuse to believe this but I do. There is Only hell there are no golden gates. Let me tell you about the people of hell.

Hell    consists of people of all sorts, Murderers, Thiefs, and anything in    between. People you may not even suspect. People of religious belief,    people that believe in there that there is a god and that if they stay    on the path of faith they will be saved. Some people even believe that    hell is the ultimate test of faith and that if they take what hell    throws at them that they will be saved.

There    are no gates waiting for us. There is no holly god, a god that loves    his children and would do no harm to them. Hell is a place that messes    with your mind most of all. It causes mental pain to the people in  it.   As I said before some people believe hell is a test of faith. I  truly   believe it's not. I've seen people do horrible things in the  name of   their lord. A lot of people believe in self-punishment. People  will   inflict pain on themselves to try to shower their god they are  true to   them and they will not sin.

These    people are scarier I find than even the murderers of hell and the    monsters themselves. I talked before how hell has creatures that roam    around slaughtering anything in their way but there is one I find most    intriguing. This monster is the embodiment of gluttony. It's massive as    tall as a 3 story building, its stomach is it doesn't stop eating.  The   people of hell call him Gluttony I know that sounds cliche but  that's   what we all referred to him as.

Gluttony    doesn't need to go out and hurt people, people come to him. I'd call    that crazy but I think the world I'm in is the embodiment of crazy.  The   real extremists that believe in Self punishment feed themselves to  the   creature every single day.

You    guys might be wanting a detailed explanation of what Gluttony looks    like. As I said before he is the size of a three-story building and he    never moves from his spot. He appears to look human but his skin is  all   cracked dyed by the red acidic rain falling from the sky. His face  is   deformed and one of the eyes is greatly smaller than the others  making   it harder for him to see. He has multiple rolls rolling down  his stomach   and the creature has no genitalia from what I could tell.  He sat with   his legs crossed most of the time as if he was giant  babysitting on the   floor. That's all I can really remember living  there for 4 centuries  you  tend to forget a lot of stuff that happened  surprisingly.

Gluttony's   area  was the best place to take the lives of others. The people there    wouldn't tend to fight back but if Gluttony caught you taking the lives    of the people before him he would attack you. I lost my life countless    times to him. Luckily due to the fact that he has trouble seeing It   made  it was easy to sneak past him.

The    area was a slaughter fest. It was as if it was a valley of death and I    embraced it. It helped me take countless lives helping me mutate a    couple of times. It hurt like a bitch felt like every mutation hurt more    than the last. But the abilities i gained helped me massively I was    vary lucky in hell. I got some of the best mutations. Some people would    think this is gross but let me tell you the things in hell are a lot    worst so you learn to get use to the weird and you don't complain  about   what you get because you wouldn't be better off without whatever  you   get.

I gained the ability  for my   spit to become extremely sticky I also could spit far. I would  be able   to trap the people walking to gluttony and kill them my  selves. Another   mutation I got also involved my mouth. I gained  razor-sharp teeth so   when people were in my traps I could tear through  their flesh not only   satisfying my lust for death but also moving  higher on the death   rankings.

I'm  starting to think   the demons people believe in our just us. People  who are trapped in hell   and we become demons our selves. Maybe the  monsters we see our just   people like us who have chosen to stay in the  darkness.

There Are Things Far Worst Than Death In Hell

"Oh    Lord deliver us salvation from this eternal inferno, Oh lord give us    thee strength to move on in this eternal darkness and allow us the    ability to not lose faith in thee oh Lord"

Bull    crap like that is what you will hear in hell. People praying to their    false gods in hope of salvation and freedom from the eternal darkness   we  all eventually get plunged into. These people you will find in  camps  in  hell.

When I say camp I don't mean pitch a tent, set up a fire and drink your sorrows away or even just enjoy the night sky.   

Imagine    a refugee camp but full of religious nuts who sit around all day    babbling to themselves how whatever is going on cant be real or people    trying to convince other people that whatever is going on is just a  test   of faith and that God will deliver us from this eternal inferno.

These    camps never really last long, they are known to only last maybe    twentyish years. I stayed in a couple of them they aren't that bad if    you ignore the nut cases.

Let me    give you guys a detailed explanation of what these places look like.    Hell is scattered with the bones of the people that fall victim to the    inferno. People use skin and bones to build tent-like buildings for    people to sleep in.

I know its    strange to think that there are people sleeping next to each other in    hell but its honestly true. I was surprised my self, but I didn't really    care because a bed is a rare thing in hell. Don't take beds for   granted  because in hell we don't have fluffy soft comforters. Our beds   if we  are lucky to have one are made of stretched skin being held   together by  rocks and bones. Tied together with hair.

I    know it sounds horrible but its better than sitting in puddles of   blood  and the burning rock that scatters the floor of the camps. 

I    spent many years hopping from camp to camp sometimes picking off   people  in their sleep. I sadly stopped going to these camps because I   learned  something Grimm about these places.

 Hell    is a place of endless torment and pain and there is no way that it   will  allow people to try to live normal lives. Hell deals with these   places  by sending the unthinkable to these places. You might be curious   about  what hell sends. I thought of the creatures to be rumors maybe   just  something someone made up to scare people and keep them in   constant fear  but no I saw them.

People refer to the creatures as Hell hounds. 

This    is not because they look like dogs but because they are the loyal    beasts of Hell. They are sort of like shapeshifters. They take the form    of whatever your greatest fear is when I first encountered one of  these   creatures when they attacked the camp I was staying in.

I    was sleeping with one of the girls I decided to hook up with while I    was there until I heard the sounds of screeching and the sounds of    people scrambling to their feet. I stepped outside the tent I was    sleeping in to see these shadow type creatures moving towards all of us    in the camp.

One pushed me to  the   ground and began to take shape of a massive spider I screamed in   terror  one of the friends I made knocked the creature off of me. Me and   him  tried to run but I knew we wouldn't be able to get away.

I    did what I had to do. Hell is a place where you should trust no one. I    knocked my friend off his feet to slow the creature down. I watched  as   it lifted him into the air taking shape of a zombie. It sucked his   soul  through his body. 

The lights shot from the creature's eyes and my friend dropped went limp. 

I    managed to escape and hide under some rocks and watched as the    creatures took shape of everyone's worst fears, I watched as they took    their souls from their bodies. I sat there and cried realizing what I    had done. In Hell, killing isn't so bad because everyone just comes  back   and still has a chance to reincarnate but I just caused someone's    existence to vanish never to be able to come back.

In    Hell there are things far worse than death, the fact that we die and    come back die and come back is horrifying but you don't realize how    scary it is when you discover one day you might not.

**The Trials Of The Inferno PT 1**

 Milliseconds,    seconds, minutes, hours, days, weeks, years, decades, and centuries   fly  by in the pit. The concept of time can be lost due to the fact you   are  always kept busy day and day out, night after night. To be honest I   said  I was in the inferno for around four centuries but that's just  my   guess. Who knows how time really works in there? All I could keep  my   mind on once I discovered the possibility of permanent sleep was  how to   get out of the infernal cage, or contemplating to my self if I  should   let the creatures of Hell take my soul to find peace in this  eternal   damnation.

   I think  it's about   time I really tell you about the inferno... The worst  things I had to   endure and do to come back. To warn and tell everyone  my story even if   they believe it or not. Call me crazy I don't care  but don't plan on   making friends with me when we all eventually get  sent back. Honestly,   the bible is a load of crap for years I had the  same quotes going   through my head day in and day out.

Isaiah 41 : 13 - "For I am the Lord your God who takes hold of your right hand and says to you, Do not fear; **I will help you.**" 

   Matthew 5:3-4 - "God  blesses those who realize their need for him, **and who mourn will be comforted**"

     Someone tell me where was our help? When were we comforted besides  for   when we took the lives of one another knowing that we will have  peace   for a little while until we stumble upon another foe? Who was  there to   take hold of my right hand telling me not to fear? No one  came to my   rescue I sat there for years praying up to the crimson sky  begging to be   saved but no one came.  I took my own hand and saved my  self so I can   live my life with slight comfort now. I recommend you do  the same.

    The inferno is like  a flame it burns turning anything it touches   transforming everything  and anything in its way into ash. The inferno   burns our hearts taking  away any love or compassion we felt towards   others turning it into ash  in our hearts releasing us making all of us   rely on our certain  emotions like anger. This forces us to lean towards   our animal  instincts like a crutch or a cane to the blind.

      When I accepted all these things completely that's when he appeared    the ruler of the inferno. He came to me in a shadow-like form and    explained to me I was now a candidate for the trials. He explained to me    the things I would undergo and have to do. These trials consisted of    challenges of harming others than to my self. I don't mean when I say  to   harm others the residents of hell, I mean living people.

     You see when people reincarnate or come back to life the Devil gives    some of us a list of things to do as sort of favor for him but one you    definitely shouldn't refuse. If you go through places like the dark  web   or deep web you can find thousands of pages on Devil worshipping  and   demon summonings. As most of them are face some of them not so  much.   Most people when they return are told to spread the word of    "summonings". What these rituals would have you do would be to take the    life of another on a alter of some sort in hope of gaining some power    from the dark one himself but what people don't realize when they    complete this ritual they are signing away the rest of the life they    have left to the dark lord.

   As a    participant of the trials, I would be forced to take over the lives  of   these people and spread chaos. Shootings, Drivebyes, terrorist  attacks   are some of the things you can expect to do when you are  partaking in   these trials. The worst part about them is that when  these people died   you know what you are sending them too. Right down  below into the land   of the dead, where they will be forced to live out  eternity there or   rise and fight to return. After the controlling of a  person, everything   gets hazy and it's hard to remember what you did  but there is one thing   you can never forget. Something that goes  completely unnoticed for   long-time residents of the abyss the  screams...

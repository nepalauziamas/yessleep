Usually, the first time I'm introduced to a patient, they're lying on my operating table heavily sedated, waiting on me to perform some life-saving procedure. I then enter the room wearing green scrubs, blue latex gloves, green shoe covers, and a green surgical cap. I am renowned worldwide as the top surgeon in my field, and I have over a 95% success rate for all the procedures I've performed throughout my career. I consider myself the Michael Jordan, Tom Brady, or Mike Tyson of my profession. When I perform surgeries, I feel like Jean-Michel Basquiat painting the Untitled Skull for the first time. I open my patients with absolute precision and remove any imperfection I find, and then I stitch them up, leaving a scar the size of a scratch. I take great pride in the work I do, but this work doesn't fill me with joy. After I remove the imperfections, I place them inside a ziplock bag and then put those bags inside my black lunch box that I usually bring to hide things I steal from the hospital. When I get home, I take those imperfections I've removed from the patient's body and modify them into a perfect biological weapon.

 It usually takes me a couple of months to find them again, but once I do, none of them seem to remember my face. This is a good thing; I guess because if they did, it would make the process less exciting. The process is always the same; I send them tickets to an all-inclusive resort in Mexico or the Dominican Republic. At first, they're hesitant to accept the keys, but after they do a little research and realize they're legit, they seem to always take advantage of them. And that's when they're introduced to the real me. When the opportunity presents itself, I slip something into their drink; It usually takes 10 minutes before they're out. I then take them back to their rooms, where I have already prepped my operating table.

I remove all their clothing revealing the scar from our last meeting, then exit the room to prep myself. I re-enter wearing an ankle-length black overcoat, a bird-like beak mask, and a black top hat similar to those made famous during the '50s. I slowly walk over to the bed and open my black suitcase removing a stitching kit, a syringe, a scalpel, and a Band-Aid. I then made a small incision on the scar and carefully placed the now-perfected illness back inside their bodies. Then I seal the wound and leave before they wake. It may take a day or two, but all the patients I've performed this procedure have suffered a painful and horrible death. This goes against everything I was taught in medical school, and it violates the promise that every doctor has made to protect and save lives, but there's just something about killing that fills me with great pleasure. I am a serial killer, and this is my design.

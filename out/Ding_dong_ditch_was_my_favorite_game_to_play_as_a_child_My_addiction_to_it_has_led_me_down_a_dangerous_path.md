When I was fourteen years old, my best friend Marcus and I loved to play ding dong ditch. We would often go to a nightclub after it had shut its doors and the staff was preparing to clean up and clock out. 

We hid in the nearby bushes and threw rocks at the front entrance. A bouncer who looked as though his other job was lifting weights walked out. 

He must have thought it was the wind or a random straggler who found their way down the road, so he went back inside. 

We threw stones a second time. Then a third. By the fourth, the bouncer was so angry he screamed at the entire vicinity when he stepped out.

We graduated to suburban homes. This was in the early millennium before everyone had a ring camera. Home security was not as cheap as it is now. At first, we relied on word-of-mouth to tell us the addresses of the teachers we disliked. We tormented them in the dead of night by ringing the doorbell and running away before they could answer. 

We executed our prank in wealthier neighborhoods. We hiked along trails to get past the men who guarded the gates of the affluent suburbs. We both came from poor households. Something about perturbing the rich made us happy.

That is until the police showed up at my house. Two of them flashed their badges through the peephole. 

When my father answered, the officer told him they reviewed clear camera footage of my face. It showed me ringing the doorbell of an estate owned by a doctor.

“The intent likely wasn't property damage or a violent misdemeanor,” the cop said. “Your son can still face charges of harassment and trespassing.”

Although they did not take me into custody, I was still at the other end of a stern lecture. It calmed me down and prevented me from engaging in my favorite hobby. 

At least for a few months.

Marcus and I were at it again within a matter of no time. We decided to go for more middle-class properties. Individuals within our economic class were less likely to have surveillance, after all.

There was a cabin that sat at the end of a road only two blocks from the lake. It was distinctive because it was such a small piece of real estate, no bigger than a tool shed. Yet the patch of land it sat on was large. There was also no gate surrounding it. I always wondered why they did not build more on its soil.

“Elise lives there,” Marcus said as we strolled by it one evening. 

“Who?” I asked. I threw a rock in the air to make the bats chase after it.

“Elise, the Grandma from hell. The old lady that everyone thinks is a witch. She dresses like she’s on her way to one of those *Lord Of The Rings* movies.”

“Let’s ring her doorbell,” I said.

“Are you sure?” Marcus asked.

“You’re not going to let an elderly person scare you, right?”

“No, it’s not that. There are stories of how she used to curse people she didn’t like. Even kids.”

“She doesn’t even have a camera," I said. "Tell you what, to make ourselves extra safe, let’s pull our shirts over our heads far enough so she can’t see us. We’ll ring and sprint like we always do.”

After I exerted enough peer pressure, Marcus agreed to it. We folded the back end of our t-shirts over the top of our heads. We followed a dirt pathway.

The doorbell had a ring of rust. The front door had a knocker that was in the shape of a naked female demon. She had serrated teeth. Her hips also had wings that protruded behind her. Their tips were sharp and extended.

I found the architecture strange. Still, I did not think anything of it beyond how it was an eccentric choice for the owner. 

Marcus and I looked at each other as a nonverbal cue to prepare one another to run.

I pressed the doorbell. 

Two things happened. 

I saw blood drip from my fingertip. The doorbell contained something sharp which cut my skin open. 

A jolt of pain coursed through me. I put pressure on the wound with my palm to try and stop the spurting.

Then we heard the noise of an angry dog barking.

We turned our heads to where the noise was coming from, and we saw a black hound jogging towards us.

We ran as fast as we could. We moved past other old and vacant houses. Adrenaline and fear coursed through us. We moved through the parking lot of a cheap trucker motel. 

Dizziness overcame me. The last thing I remember was falling between the soda machine and the pool. The side of my face scraped against the concrete.

When I came to I was in my bedroom. I faced the ceiling on my mattress. Marcus hovered over me.

“Thank God you’re awake,” he said.

“What happened?” I asked.

“I brought you home, man. I didn’t know what else to do. Your Mom’s nursing skills came in handy because she managed to stop the blood. Your Dad’s angry. I lied and told them we were skateboarding and you had an accident.”

\*

For the next few days, mental exhaustion became overwhelming. All I could do was sleep.

One night I awoke and was hungry. I opened my bedroom door, crept down the hallway, and went downstairs to the kitchen. 

As I was preparing a cold-cut sandwich, I heard the doorbell ring.

I chewed and inched towards the door. I stared through the peephole.

No one was there.

I went back into the kitchen and grabbed a glass of water. I was still delirious and tired, so I did not think much of what transpired.

The doorbell rang again. I went towards the door again and this time opened it. 

I wish I had not. 

A bloodied chicken with its feathers plucked and head removed was there. 

I took in the scene and tried to make sense of it. Who would do this in the middle of the night? I closed the door and locked it. 

That was when the doorbell rang again.

And again.

And again.

I went into the kitchen and retrieved a butcher's knife. I waited for the doorbell to ring once more, and I opened the door when the resonance of the noise was still in the air.

I looked out at the front lawn and the shrubbery there. An old lady's face stared at me from behind the bush. It had deep line marks all over her face and a permanent grin. Her skull turned into a freakish smile. 

One of the things that struck me as strange about her mug was how small it was and how it seemed to float. She was either very short behind the vegetation or I was hallucinating and she was a hovering head. 

The starlight made her eyes twinkle with the same sort of shimmering quality as the grassy dew. 

She drifted towards me. 

I shut the door, ran upstairs, and peeked out through my blinds to stare at the lawn below.

She was gone.

A similar series of events transpired for the next month. Every night some preternatural or supernatural force would harass me. I thought I was going crazy. I even lied about having suffered a concussion to get a head scan. This made my parents happy but muddied the waters of my sense of sanity.

I told Marcus about everything one day when we were hanging out at our local arcade.

“You might be going crazy,” he said as he killed a dozen zombies in a row with perfect headshots.

“The woman cursed me,” I said.

He dropped the plastic weapon and stared at me with his jaw hung slack.

“I’m going to beg her to lift it,” I said. “I will apologize for the wrong I did. I need you to come with me. In case she tries to hurt me.”

“So you’re going to admit to her we ding dong ditched? She could call the cops and use it against us."

“If you come with me," I said, "I’ll buy you lunch for a week.”

That convinced him more than a lecture on loyalty ever could.

The house seemed even more decrepit and covered in grime than it had the last time we were there. The street was so dark it was as though the neighborhood had evacuated. I also noticed how there was music blasting from the inside of the domicile. It sounded like a slowed-down classical orchestra.

I walked up to the door and knocked.

No one answered but I persisted. 

“Let’s go,” Marcus said as he shivered. “It’s getting cold.”

I motioned for him to follow me as I circled the small building. Our feet crunched the autumnal leaves and their crisp scent wafted over us.

We got to a window with a carmine curtain, its pane cracked. 

I reached in, opened the pane, and pulled the curtain to the side.

Elise lay on the ground. Around her was a red symbol. A bucket of what looked like blood sat beside her as well. I tried to call myself down and tell myself it was nothing more than paint. The four corners of the room had mutilated chickens.

“What the hell is that?” Marcus asked as he pointed at the ceiling.

Another glyph was there, and it matched the design on the ground.

When I peered back at the floor, Elise was gone.

Then she appeared in front of me like an apparition. Her mouth was open and she shrieked.

I looked behind me and saw Marcus run down the street.

“I wanted to say I’m sorry,” I said as I backed away. “What I did was disrespectful and wrong. If you could take away whatever hex you put on me, I’ll be grateful. I’m good at maintenance work I can fix things. I’ll come by and do chores every once in a while if you want.”

She opened up her palm and I swore I saw a tattoo on the inside of it, a strange symbol with a likeness unfamiliar to me. A burst of white light flashed between us and I passed out.

\*

When I came to, I was in my room. I looked at my nightstand and the alarm clock and saw I had slept well past morning. I could not figure out how I lost the day, I had no memory of getting back home or going to bed. I also had a splitting headache.

I went downstairs to eat breakfast and try to find Tylenol. Dad sat at the table eating cereal. He looked up at me.

“Is everything okay? You haven’t been drinking have you?”

“No,” I said as I massaged my forehead. “I didn’t get enough sleep. I’ll be fine though.”

“Good,” he said. “We have new neighbors and I want you to be nice to them, not grumpy because you’re sleep-deprived. They’re out there right now. Go out and introduce yourself after you’ve had a cup of coffee.”

I opened the blinds and saw a man and a woman walking down the ramp of a U-Haul.

The woman stared straight at me. Her face contorted in morphed into that of Elise. It changed back in a millisecond.

\*

It has been eighteen years since that experience. The visions lasted for another year before they stopped. The haunting terrors ceased when she died. Elise passed away from a heart attack. The house ended up demolished to make space for a hotel. They built a hot tub in the exact space it used to be.

I will never walk by that area again.

I was so proud of my wife when she added her name to the organ donor registry. It made me a little queasy thinking about parts of her roaming freely outside of her body. Still, I applauded her altruism. 

After she filed the paperwork I didn’t give it further thought. I assumed she’d outlive me and that I’d never have to contemplate the subject again. 

But life never works out how we expect. 

The year that followed the accident was extraordinarily difficult. I wouldn’t wish the experience upon my worst enemy. 

I barreled through all the stages of grief. I felt extreme degrees of emotion that I didn’t realize existed. I went through therapy and did my best to reassemble a life built for two. 

I tried to recreate our little rituals: I visited our favorite restaurants, watched our cherished movies, and cried to our special songs. 

I’d spend hours sitting alone at our special spot: it was a grassy hill that provided a spectacular view of the entire valley. We used to watch the sunset here and hold hands like smitten lovers.

Months went by: I persevered, I grieved and I healed.  

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I dreaded the one year anniversary of her death.  While I knew it was going to be difficult, the events of that night exceeded my expectations.

That evening I took my inlaws out for dinner. We reminisced about the good times and wept over the experiences we would never have. 

We hugged, said goodbye and I drove home.  

I opened my front door to my pitch black apartment and turned the overhead light on. 

In front of me were six people: three men, two women, and a young girl. They all sat on kitchen chairs arranged in a straight line. They all stared at me smiling. 

“Hello?” I said, “What are you people doing here?” 

With a single, unified voice they said, “Hello honey bear.” 

The words sent chills down my spine. That was my wife’s nickname for me. The last time I heard it aloud was exactly one year today. 

“I’m calling the police if you don’t leave right now!” I shouted, fumbling with my phone. 

“What’s the matter?” the six said all together. “Don’t recognize me?” 

The synchronization of their voices was flawless. Even their mannerisms—the tilt of their heads, the raised eyebrows, the pouting lips—all perfectly lined up. 

I shuddered: I’d seen those unmistakable quirks on my wife’s face countless times. 

“Listen, whoever you are, this is not a good night for bullshit. Get out!” 

“I understand that you may be uncomfortable with my appearance,” the six said. “But this is who I am now.” 

“What are you saying? Who are you?” 

“It’s me honey bear, your wife!” 

I collapsed heavy on to my knees. I was already an emotionally fragile wreck; this was too much to bear. 

“That’s impossible!” I shouted, slamming my fist into the carpet. “This is a disgusting prank! Get out!” 

“Do you remember when I signed up to be an organ donor? You weren’t comfortable with the idea, but you still supported me.”

“What are you talking about?” 

“Each of the people you see before you contains a part of me.”

One by one, they all stood up, uttered a single word and sat back down:

“Pancreas.”

“Liver.”

“Heart.”

“Intestine.” 

“Lung.”

The little girl stood up last and said, “Kidney.” 

“Wait, so you people all received my wife’s organs?” 

“I am your wife,” they said. “There is no one else here.” 

My brain couldn’t process this much lunacy at once. The room started spinning and I collapsed to the floor. “This is impossible. . .”

“It’s not impossible,” they said, “And I need your help.” 

“No, this isn’t real. This is wrong. What can I possibly do?” 

“The doctors who removed my organs still have my brain. And they are not respecting it.  Everyday I can feel them prodding and poking at it; it feels like an electric shock and I lose control. Together, you and I, we shall take it back.” 

“How?” 

“I must be reassembled.” 

The little girl stood up and walked towards me. She handed me a piece of paper. 

“I need you to buy everything on this list.” 

I looked at the list: a single thick needle, a long spool of cotton twine, a set of heavy duty brass chains, ten rolls of duct tape, gorilla glue, a large tarp, a canvas bag, and two flat-headed sledgehammers. 

“What is all this for?” I asked. 

They all stood up at once and I felt six hands on my shoulders. “Honey, you’re going to have to trust me.” 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I drove my truck to Home Depot and sped way over the limit to ensure I’d make it there before closing. 

I tried to concentrate on the road, but focus evaded me as my mind somersaulted over the implications of what I just witnessed. 

I missed my wife dearly and I would do anything to see her again. That being said, I was more than a little uneasy about my wife turning into three men, two women, and a little girl. 

Even though her speech was interpreted through a disturbing chorus of voices, it was still my wife. 

I had so many questions: How long has she been conscious for? How did she come back to life and control this flock of meat puppets? What is the purpose of this list? 

One question about the six people she controlled lingered uncomfortably at the back of my mind: are *they* still alive? 

I arrived at Home Depot and sprinted inside. I grabbed one of their oversized shopping carts and went to work. 

I found everything on the list, put it all in the back of my truck and raced home. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I opened my front door and found the six of them still sitting on the kitchen chairs. 

“Fantastic!” they all said at once. “Honey, can you turn on the back light for me?” They all stood up in unison and walked single file outside. 

I turned on the light and I saw them standing in the backyard with the supplies I just purchased. 

I was transfixed as I observed their gruesome labors. 

One of the men laid horizontal on the ground; he set his legs straight and placed his arms at his sides. The little girl then tied his legs and feet together with the chains, clasping it shut. 

One of the other men laid down parallel to the first, and the little girl repeated the process. 

Then, the third man sat on the ground in front of their heads and positioned his arms and legs so that he was spreadeagle. He shuffled forward towards the other men, and they reached up, gripping his legs.

The little girl then proceeded to use the long needle and twine to sew the men together. I winced as I watched the sharp metal pierce into the meat of the mens’ flesh. They didn’t even flinch.  

I approached the grim spectacle. “What are you doing?” 

“Isn’t it obvious?” they all said at once. “I’m attaching my legs to my torso.” 

The two women then approached the man-torso, and, feet-first, they placed themselves in line with the man’s arms. 

The little girl then repeated the process: she chained their legs together and sewed them securely onto the torso-man’s arms. The women lifted their arms over their heads. The little girl dabbed the glue to their wrists and held them together to form a single, grasping, ten-fingered hand. 

The little girl surrounded the entire gestalt creation with a thick covering of duct tape. 

Finally, she took the canvas sack, strung it around the neck of the torso-man, and hopped inside.  She propped herself up top, giving the monstrosity a comically undersized head.   

I recoiled and went limp as I saw the abomination stand up. I was amazed by its flexibility: the man-legs didn’t appear to struggle with the weight, and the woman-arms moved with surprising facility. 

Six bodies became the ultimate composite wife. She looked like a gross, fleshy Voltron. 

“Sweety,” all the mouths said at once, “would you mind grabbing the sledgehammers and tarp and meeting me at the truck?”

The monster lurched forward, walked around the house and disappeared from sight. I grabbed the sledgehammers and made for the truck. When I arrived my wife was sitting upright on the truck’s bed. She looked like a giant in an undersized lounge chair. 

“Okay kiddo, I need you to drive me to the university’s research hospital. That’s where my brain is held.” 

“You want me to drive you?” I stammered. “Won’t people see you?” 

“No, silly! That’s why I asked you to grab a tarp!” 

I pulled the tarp over top of them and tied it down. I put the two sledgehammers in the back seat and drove. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

It wasn’t a long drive. By this point it was well past 10 p.m. There were some people milling about, but none reacted to an otherwise benign looking truck. 

I parked in front of the hospital. There were some lights on but no visible activity. 

“We’re here,” I said and drew back the tarp.

“Perfect! You’re the best, sweetheart! Do you mind passing me the sledgehammers?” 

I handed her the two massive bludgeons and she grabbed each of them firmly with her ten-fingered hands. 

She lumbered over to the building’s glass facade. She did not fit, so she smashed her way in. 

Fifteen minutes later she emerged from the shattered front entrance. She was covered in blood and bits of viscera. She no longer held the sledgehammers; instead, she clutched a glass jar in one hand and a sheath of paper in the other. 

“I’ve got it! Let’s get out of here!” She clambered into the back of my truck and I stretched the tarp back over her. I heard sirens approaching as I sped away from the hospital. 

Ten minutes later I felt confident we weren’t being followed. I heard a gentle tapping on the back window.

“Hey sweety?” my wife said. “Do you know what would mean a lot to me? If we went to our special place.” 

I knew exactly where she meant: the grassy hill that overlooked the valley. 

It was not far. When we arrived we had the place to ourselves. I stopped the truck, tore back the tarp, and held my hand out to help my wife down.  

“Thank you sweetheart,” she said, “For everything.”  

She plopped her brain out of the glass jar and placed it securely in the sack with the little girl. 

I saw that she was still holding the handful of papers. 

“What’s all that?” I asked. 

“It’s all the paperwork you need to setup an organ donation. I got it for you.” 

“For me?” 

“If it worked for me, maybe it will work for you!” she said. Each of her faces looked really hopeful. 

I wasn’t sure if I liked where this was going. “Don’t I have to die first?” I asked. 

“We’ll worry about that later,” she said. 

She towered over me and gave me a gigantic hug. She surrounded me with her human arms and I felt the warm duct-taped bodies of six people press of against me. 

Nothing else really mattered: I had my wife back. 

We sat together for hours holding hands. I sat in her massive lap and we watched the sunrise together.

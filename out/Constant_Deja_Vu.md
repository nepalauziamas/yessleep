Okay so first off I know nobody is going to believe me. Trust me I can’t even explain it myself and feel like I’m going crazy. But does anyone know of a psychoactive drug that causes hallucinations based on touch and effects the brain almost instantly? Because one day at work last week I felt a weird feeling and noticed someone watching me. It’s this homeless person that is always on drugs near my work. 

I went to the gas station after I got off and saw this same person coming my way, and as they approached me from across the hood of my vehicle I assumed they were gonna ask for money or something. Instead, they knew my full name and birthday and I stood there terrified wondering how the hell they had that information. I told him to back up and he kept coming closer. I was about to call the cops and as I tried pushing him back, he grabbed both of my arms and what felt like a lifetime only lasted seconds. 

In that time, he grabbed my arms I saw things I couldn’t explain. The world disappeared around me and I watched what seemed to be the story of everything unfold right in front of my eyes. I saw my future wife and kids, their kids, our retirement home, my parents’ death, siblings death, etc. 

But not only was it my life and the lives of those around me, but catastrophes around the earth taking millions of lives and the environment dying. I saw how the world will shift to balance itself and rid most of the human race to bounce back from the edge of all life on earth becoming extinct. Plagues, natural disasters, terraforming, you really wouldn’t believe how bad we’ve effected this planet and how badly we will be overpopulated.. 

Earth isn’t just a planet. It’s alive and knows we’re killing her. She will do everything in her power to rid herself of the infestation we’ve caused and correct the imbalance of man vs nature. Not only did I see the negatives but I also witnessed the positives of what we’re able to overcome. Racism is forgotten, equality is in full effect, the technology we become capable of allows us to break the laws of nature, and much much more. 

I could go on forever about what I saw but after it was over, I snapped out of it and was still at the gas station not even a whole minute later. The person who caused me to see all of this had disappeared.. I looked around to find him but he was nowhere to be found. I had a sudden, throbbing headache. 

As I drove home I had an eerie feeling that something was going to happen to this car following me. As I got off the freeway, in my head I saw the car hit the guard rail and flip into a minivan with a family and kids. When I looked back over at them, sure enough, I saw the whole thing… I had to get out of there thinking I somehow made that happen. 

When I got home and tried going to sleep, my brain wouldn’t let me. It was as if I kept reliving everything over again. 

The next day I saw full conversations with my coworkers unfold before they even began. I apparently answered questions that were asked about certain work things that I had no way of knowing and was correct, or so I was told. This has gone on for a few days now and I feel like I’m developing schizophrenia or something along those lines. 

I am tempted to check myself into a hospital, well was, until I tested my theory. I bought a lottery ticket and purposefully chose 5 of 6 of the winning numbers I thought I knew for that day. When the drawing happened, I got them all right… even the last number I chose not to pick just to see if I was right. I was in complete disbelief and shock as to what was happening. 

Am I crazy? Or am I holding all the secrets to the world? I guess we’ll find out if a national emergency is really called on February 12, 2023. This is what seems to be the the point of no return for our future..

My jog continued all the way to the hospital. I planned to slow down once I got away from my building since I was still exhausted from the day at the foundry, but I couldn't shake off the sense of urgency that I heard in that voice, so I wanted to get to the place as soon as possible. 


The night became fairly chilly, almost as if the season was late autumn and not the peak of summer. Man, I wish it was that cold outside during my trip home from work when I was as hot as a furnace. Every now and then, icy wind scratched the uncovered parts of my body like dry, leafless, thin branches of neglected bushes next to the pavements in the suburbs. 


The maps app on my phone said that the hospital I sought was just around the corner, and sure enough, as I turned right at the junction, I came upon the entrance that had a big sign above.
Cedar Falls, said the sign. I walked towards the doors and they slid open as I approached.


This hospital was busier than I imagined, with nurses walking all around and scrubs tending to the patients in those exam rooms set in a row, with only curtains to separate them from each other.


I approached the reception desk and took off the hood of my sweatshirt from my head. If the outside temperature could've been described as cold, the temperature inside this building couldn't have been called less than freezing, thanks to the AC blasting away at full power. My hair was still moist from the shower, and I felt my scalp tightening and becoming a bit numb from the cold.


"Hello, I'm here to visit one of your patients."


The lady with dark skin and gray, curly, short hair behind the desk looked at me above her glasses without lifting her head. She never stopped shuffling through some papers in front of her and took a pause before she replied. 


"That won't do, sweetie. You need to tell me the name of the patient, not just that you want to visit *someone.*" 


Shit. I had no idea what her name was. I wasn't even entirely sure if it was a woman's voice.


"Yeah, she's in room 221."


Great job, moron. You had to use *she* even though you had no actual proof that the voice was female.


The shuffling of papers ceased and the lady glanced at me, once again above her glasses, as she scanned me from head to toe.
She finally raised her head and looked me straight in the eye, this time through the eyeglasses. The string tied between the temples dangled a bit as she puckered her lips a bit.


"Mhm, alright sweetie. You'll have to fill this paper since you're visiting a comatose patient. Hospital policy."


She pulled a paper from the bunch she shuffled through earlier and handed it to me, together with a tiny pen that was tied to the desk with a string. It was a bit amazing, she seemed like a magician who pulled out your card from the middle of the deck when she found that paper so swiftly. 


*Wait, what? Comatose?*


I realized what she said only after I was almost done with the form. Not that it changed anything, this whole thing was so weird already, it couldn't become much weirder. I filled out the form and handed it to the nice lady behind the desk. She gave me instructions on how to find the room and I was on my way.


The elevator was almost empty so I got to my floor quicker than expected. I found room 221 just as quickly. I was a tad hesitant to open the door for some reason, but I powered through that feeling as I remembered how scared the voice was. I pushed the door handle and the wide door opened smoothly, without making a sound.


The room was one of those suites or whatever they're called, the ones that are for a single patient and look a lot like a hotel room.
I was a bit ashamed of myself because I immediately thought that the room was way nicer than my own apartment. The fact that people who stay in it are fighting for their lives with all their might is what made me realize how selfish that initial thought was.


As I entered the room, I found myself in a seven-foot hallway with the door to the bathroom on my left. In front of me was the room itself, a fairly large one. The wall straight ahead had a big sliding window with roll-up curtains. In the right corner next to the window stood a reclining chair and a standing lamp, presumably for reading.
The wall to the left had a decent size TV on it, with wardrobes on each side. There was also a couch in the room, I guess for family members who stay overnight sometimes. It was set next to the wall of the bathroom, so the person who sat or lay on it had a clear view of the patient's bed.


The patient's bed was in the middle of the room, with its headrest touching the wall opposite the one with the TV. The machinery for life support, with all the tubes and wires sticking out was on both sides of the bed. There was also a small drawer beside the bed, on the side towards the door.


I looked at the girl in the bed and couldn't help but feel angry. She was beautiful and young. And she was only alive because the machines kept her alive. It wasn't fair. All kinds of scum live amazing lives out there without a care in the world, while some people suffer like this and have to fight every second to survive.


I stared at her face for a second. The voice that called out to me from the water was familiar. Yet the person in the bed was a complete stranger to me.


It took me a moment to notice because I was focused on the girl, but a guy stood next to her. He was on the side of the bed closer to the window. And he held a syringe in one hand. The other hand reached for one of the IV lines.


He was no nurse, he had a turtleneck and a leather jacket, and last time I checked, that was hardly a nurse or a doctor uniform. I had to act first and think later.


He looked at me and was about to say something I supposed would've been a threat. 


I reached into my sweatshirt's front pocket, grabbed my phone, and chucked it towards him as fast and as hard as I could. In hindsight, that was careless, because I could've easily hit the girl.


I dashed forward as soon as the phone left my hand. The man bobbed his head to the side to avoid the phone. It didn't hit him cleanly, but it grazed his temple and even drew blood in the process. I guess the throw had a lot of power behind it.


By the time his temple turned dark red with the precious liquid, I was already next to the bed. I leaped over it, caught the guy by his jacket lapel with my left hand, and his shoulder with my right hand, and tackled him to the ground. My left knee hit the floor and I felt a crack.


I was surprised by my own strength. I haven't fought someone since elementary school, but I smashed this guy to the checkered blue and yellow tiles beneath him like he was nothing. Working at the foundry day in and day out seems to be far more efficient for building up strength than had I thought. 


I kept my grip on the guy's shoulder as I slowly raised my upper body, ready to wrestle with him. At that moment, I saw his eyes turn back in his head. He began to twitch and flop vigorously right after, just as if he was a fish on dry land. Behind his head was a puddle of blood I haven't noticed before. It kept growing in size and I felt terror rush through my whole body.


I backed off and tried to stand but the knee that made a cracking noise earlier buckled under my weight and I fell to the ground.


**"HELP, HELP, ANYONE, ROOM 221, HELP!"**


I screamed from the top of my lungs. A nurse came in rushing and as she saw the guy on the floor, turned her head back, called for a doctor and security, and immediately approached the seizing man.
She flipped him onto his side and started pulling his tongue out. Since his jaw was clenched tight, the nurse had her fingers bitten over and over to the point of blood coming out, but that didn't stop her or slowed her down.


The events that ensued remain foggy in my memory, presumably due to the shock from the whole experience and the pain I felt from my knee. I remember the security officer questioning me and the doctors performing a check-up on my leg, then rushing me to surgery.


I woke up handcuffed to the bed frame. I remained under custody for almost the entire time I stayed in the hospital after surgery. Police officers came a few times and asked me to tell them the entire story. One of them stayed in the hallway at all times.


I never mentioned the real reason that made me come visit the girl. That would get me an express ticket to the looney bin. Instead, I just told them she was an old friend and that I recently learned about her condition, so I wanted to see her.


Eventually, they dropped the charges against me. The guy survived and woke up a few days later with no evident brain damage, despite his head getting cracked open when I tackled him. Turns out, cops can do their job well in some cases, like this one. They found out he was the girl's ex and that he stalked her for months before her car accident that caused the coma. He wanted to end her life, then his own as well because he thought she would never wake up. 


That day, he went to her room without checking in at the reception. He lied to the lady working there and said he just had to use the bathroom, so she let him into the hospital. They found the syringe that turned out to be full of gasoline. My fingerprints weren't on it, obviously, which got me out of trouble. The man confessed everything once he realized that lying wouldn't get him anywhere in this case.


It took a few weeks until I recovered enough to leave the hospital. I was still limping, but I could at least walk. I never got the bill though, which was peculiar, but hey, I had no money anyways, so I didn't complain. It took me a few more weeks to be able to go back to the foundry, and at that point, I was completely dry on cash.


My life turned back to normal, ish, with my knee as the only memento of the whole ordeal of weirdness. And the lack of cash. And the mental trauma of almost killing a guy. And the fun experience of being under arrest. 


Overall, it seemed like all I got from trying to help someone was punishment. I never wanted to hear a voice from the water again. I didn't either, even though I found myself with ears full of water numerous times after the event.


One day, I got a phone call. I couldn't answer it as I was in the foundry at the moment, so it went to the voice-mail instead. I listened to it after I showered at home. It was the lady from the reception desk. I thought she must've called about the bill.


"HI sweetie, I'm the receptionist from the hospital, Cedar Falls, remember? I hope your knee is feeling well. Listen, someone wants to see you and they asked me to call you for them. Come around tomorrow at 6 pm. Don't be late honey, it's important."


I bet it was, she sounded pretty serious.


Just as I was about to put my phone down and hit the rags, I got a text from my brother.


*Hey bro, I know you lied to me about that knee,*


Ah, fuck. How did he find out? Did he call the foundry to check if I really got my knee busted there as I told him?


*but it’s alright, I understand why you lied. I know. And now it's time for you to know too. I got everything set up, come by tomorrow whenever. I'll teach you everything.*


What? He *knows* what I think he knows?


As I sat on the bed and stared at the cracked screen on my phone, I felt a powerful tug on my shoulders that threw me across the room. I hit the wall with my back and fell to the ground, right on my ass. I glanced around the room.


There was no one there.


Then I felt another tug on my right shoulder. I turned my head towards it. No one was there, again. I flew across the room one more time. While I was in the air, I realized what I saw on my shoulder earlier.


*Water.*

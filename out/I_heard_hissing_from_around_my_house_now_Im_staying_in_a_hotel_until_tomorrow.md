I woke up to a sporadic hissing sound from outside. I got out of bed and opened the window and it got even louder. I went downstairs and went outside while still in my robes and slippers. I stepped through the grass of my lawn and looked around. However I was horrified at the new revelation.  


I knew now what caused all that noise. There were hundreds of snakes all around my house, slithering in piles and hanging around the foundation. Some even poked their heads out of holes or rested alongside the cracks. They were many different colors, but most of them were shades of green.  


I screamed and felt my heart thrash as panic had begun to set in. Snakes slithered towards me and I realized they were all around me in the grass. I hopped from one foot to the next screaming wildly. The slippers on my feet flew off and were claimed by snakes. I ran onto the hot road still shaking from the sheer amount of snakes in my lawn.  


I instinctively reached for my pocket but I realized I didn’t have my phone. It was still inside the house. I felt uneasy, I didn’t even want to go back inside my house in fear there would be snakes there.  


I ran as fast as I could down the pavement and snakes started to slither after me. Once I got inside I slammed the door shut and ran the stairs to go to my room. I slipped on clothes and got everything I needed. I cautiously went down stairs and heard hissing from my floor.  


I looked outside the window and they were slithering everywhere over the roads and going to other houses. I opened the door and ran back outside to my car. I got inside and looked in horror as more snakes had begun to funnel out from a single whole or two and go in all directions.  


I quickly pulled out my phone and looked up an exterminator on google. I called them and said  


“Hello? There is like a massive amount of snakes around my house, and I think some are inside the foundation. Do you know when you can have someone stop by?”.  


The man on the other side thought for a second and said  


“This isn’t an average case we see, but tomorrow we will stop by home and help you out”.  


I drove to the nearest hotel to stay the night. I heard popping and squishing as my car pulled out. My driveway was littered with guts and blood. The putrid sight made me want to vomit so bad and I opened my window just in case.  


I drove to the hotel and felt broken, like my mind couldn’t get over what I saw. I felt the worst anxiety that there could be more snakes anywhere, even under my hotel bed. I got inside and paid for a room for one night.  


I plopped on the bed and stared at the ceiling. I could barely sleep and I checked the floor every second. I kept the lights on and the tv on. It was around three to four am before I passed out. I woke up and drove back to my house.  


The snakes were all gone and I cautiously walked on the pavement towards my door. I walked inside and walked up stairs. I checked my room thoroughly and found nothing. I walked downstairs and looked around happily.  


Then I heard hissing once more.

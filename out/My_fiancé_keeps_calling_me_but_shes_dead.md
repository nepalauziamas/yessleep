I don’t even know where to began. I know that this story will not sound right and will be very confusing.  But, I feel the only way that I can find comfort in my life; is by telling my story and seek help. 

I need peace…I need sleep! 

My fiancé died in a tragic freak accident. She was burned alive in “our” home 2 weeks before we walked down the aisle. (Sigh). I wish we would have made it. God I wish we got to at least say “I do”.  She’s my best friend. But, she had her cons. 

It’s been about a year now. I’ve gotten better with time. I’ve even found someone “new”. I know what you’re thinking. Too soon ? Well, she makes me feel great! It’s the most incredible feeling I’ve felt in a long time.  Even before…my fiancé. 

Sarah and I have been dating for about 6 months now. We’ve found a small cute apartment together. 2 bedrooms and 2 bathrooms. It’s pretty small but, it feels like home. We have been doing so well. Communicating and enjoying each other. I feel blessed to have her in my life. She’s so beautiful, understanding, loyal, sympathetic, and the most attractive trait…she’s a go with the flow kinda girl. 

Something my fiancé never had. It’s like my fiancé needed me. Needed us. She got down on her knee and proposed to me with rings. She never gave me the chance to do anything. She purchased our home and signed all documentations alone. I never exactly owned “our” home. My fiancé was very pushy and rushed everything. So, I was sucked in before we could mutually agree on anything. 

Fast-forward, Sarah works night shift at the towns local hospital. She’s an RN there and she’s been there for about 6 years now. I work in the day time at the police station as a certified deputy. I mean it’s hard to see each other sometimes. But we make it work since we have the same days off. 

I remember this night so vividly. Sarah told me she was headed to work. She goes in at 6pm and gets off at 6am. I get home by 4pm. So we have an hour or so to see each other and have dinner. I walked her to her car and make sure she gets into the car safe. We wave at each other and say our goodbyes and our I love yous. 

I walk back in and eat some left overs… 

(ring, ring, ring)

My phone. I grab it. Maybe Sarah wants me to bring something that she forgot to grab. 

 Caller ID- “Angie”. 

I never got a chance to update my phone. I still had HER saved. 

*Clears throat* “uh, Hello?” 

“………” 

It’s just static on the other end. 

I hang up the phone. Maybe it’s someone with a new number calling and it’s still saved under Angie.  

(Ring, ring, ring)

“Hello”

“…..(static)….”

“Th-This isn’t funny.” I stutter. “Please, you have the wrong number.” 

I hang up the phone. This situation is really getting the best of me and I am freaking the fuck out! 

(RING, RING, RING) 

This time I pick up the phone and I don’t say one word.

“….. I don’t think it’s funny either, Dean. How you just move on like that…” 

The tone was still super staticky and sounded distant.

I turned white. Eyes roaming the room while I listen to the familiar voice. 

“I’m ALWAYS with you, Dean….I love you.”

I hang up the phone. Still pale. Still trying to understand the situation that just occurred. My mind starts to wonder. 

“No.. it can’t be. Wa-was that Angie?” 

I don’t know who will read this and I don’t know what to do. I’m scared out of my mind. Should I do a séance? Should I get a new phone? She said she will always be with me…how can I get rid of her? I need help. Any advise? I need a plan and fast. 

I know that Angie will be calling me again.

It’s sad when the only former high school classmate you see is your drug dealer.Most of our nerd table at the lunchroom became lawyers, doctors, tech executives. 

Except for Drew.Dealing drugs is just one of his jobs. He bartends at weddings. Buys junker cars and takes them to Mexico to flip for a few grand. 

He lives in a Mercedes Sprinter outside of San Diego. 

Usually he leaves my normal order in the garden without saying ‘hi’. Tonight he asked if I could meet him in person. I know he doesn’t profit off my orders. So I drove down after closing up shop early. 

Drew’s dad is a lawyer. His brother is a lawyer. I am a lawyer. I also take a prescription for provigil. And sometimes microdose psilocybin mushrooms. Because I have my own family issues. 

“How’s the trial going?” Drew asks. 

“The client has lied to us the entire time. But we picked a jury that would ride or die with him.” I smirked. 

“Well at least he’ll learn a valuable lesson from all of this.” Drew replied. 

He looked around the area. Opened up his glove compartment and handed me my bag. 

“I’m probably not going to be taking any tonight, but I don’t mind if you want to get high and hang.” I said. 

“Actually I wanted to pick your brain on something. And it’s better if you’re not high when I mention any of this.” he said. 

“If it’s legal advice you better have given me good shit.” I replied. 

“No. I mean I don’t think it is.” he said. 

“Do you remember Carey K Rothwell?” Drew asked. 

I leaned back in my chair. I knew he didn’t have the proper way to word that question. The apology filled his eyes before he could give it. 

“Yeah. I mean. You know I was there, right?” I said. 

“Truthfully. I don’t remember that night at all.” Drew said. 

“You were there though.” I replied. 

It was after a soccer game. Carey K Rothwell was a cute girl. Bubbly but a bit of a loner. There were so many Kari, Carey, Kerrys in her class she went by Carey K. The sad thing is that she didn’t travel with a pack of other girls with her. Always seemed to have a new friend each semester.  She played on the girls soccer team as a junior.  Went to the boys games every fall. Two of our friends were in the band. I was writing for the paper.  We were all driving to get some fast food when Carey K’s car was spotted on the road. 

She had hit a deer.  Or to be specific. The deer hit her. Her Jeep Cherokee smashed so hard into it that its head was decapitated. And it smashed right into Carey K. Killing her. 

I pulled over. It had been probably 4 or 5 minutes after the crash. Other cars pulled over. Cops came. Neighbors walked blocks to see it. 

Drew was in the car with me that night. He didn’t even get out to help Carey K. He just muttered that she was dead and we shouldn’t even get out. I knew he had a crush on her. But in a way where they weren’t in each others circles. And it wouldn’t have worked out. 

She and I had never talked. But I knew of her. Mostly because her mom was one of my favorite teachers at school. 

I went to look. Just to make sure what I thought wasn’t wrong. The deer head was in the backseat. Its body underneath the back tires. Carey K’s hands still tied to the wheel. 

“Are the memories bothering you? Want to talk about it?” I asked Drew. 

“So I found her Youtube page.” Drew replied. 

“What?” I said. 

“Yeah. Ummm.  She had a screenname on AOL. MilhousesGoldfish84.” he said. 

“*Where’s the Bowl Bart*?!” I quoted.

“Heh. Canine’s Mutiny. One of my Top 10 episodes.” He replied. 

“Anyways. I sort of think about her every now and then. And it hit me that maybe she had used that username on a forum or had a blog with it…” Drew said. 

“And you found a Youtube page?” I asked. 

He nodded. 

There were 8 videos. He clicked on a random one. 

“Holy crap. That’s her.” I said. 

The videos felt more like home movies than Youtube content. Like finding someone’s roll of vacation film and not seeing anything interesting at all. But soaking in the melancholy of it all.

“This one is better.” Drew said. 

*He clicked on one of her in the woods. She seemed to be walking around and filming birds.* 

*“What would people think if they knew that my mom taught religious studies at a Catholic school but was really into Aleister Crowley?”* 

*The next part of the video had her inside of a crypt. Whistling. As if looking for a dog.*

*“What would people think if they knew that my first communion was from the Beast and not a Priest?”* 

“Is this one of those Blair Witch knockoffs everyone was trying to make?” I laughed. 

“Hold on.” Drew said. Fast forwarding twenty minutes into the forty minute video.She was back in the woods. 

*“Hey there. Hey there. I’m not here to hurt you.”  Carey K said.* 

Walking through the woods was a young deer. Carey K sang a song. To be specific it sounded more like someone trying to sing while hiccuping. 

“*I’m not here to hurt you. No. You’re going to hurt me, okay?”* Carey K said. 

The deer came closer. And closer. Then it nervously bowed to her. 

“*No. Not today. When we’re both older. Let’s try to enjoy the time we have in these bodies”* 

*She positioned the camera on the ground. And hugged the deer.* 

*“You’re scared of dying aren’t you?” she whispered to the der.* 

*“I am too.  Can we cry together?” She began crying. The deer began to shudder as she put her arm around it.* 

*“See we have to die so we can instruct the others how to get into the Nightmare Room.”* 

“What the fuck is this, Drew.” I said. 

“One more.” he said. 

“I should get going.” I said. 

But he clicked on it and held my arm down. 

It was Carey K riding the deer. Like it was a horse. At night.

“Do you know where that street is?” he asked.

“It’s where she died.” I said. 

“I wanted to make sure.” he said. 

“Drew. You do realize that…” 

“Go ahead and say it.” he said. 

“She died in 2000. Seven or eight years before Youtube was even a website.” I said. 

“I know.” he said. “These videos didn’t even get uploaded until 2014.”

“Who uploaded this?” I said. 

“Maybe her mom?” he said. 

“She died. Our freshman year of college. I went to her funeral.” I said. 

“How did I not know that?” he asked. 

“Because it was a suicide.” I said.

“Whoever uploaded this knew her by her screen name. And somehow they got these videos and uploaded it as her after her death. But why?” he asked.

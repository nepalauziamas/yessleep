Johnny, wake up bud, I said to my dog. My dogs name is johnny and he’s an old one but he’s been with me since i was young. We usually go on walks in the night we live in a safe neighborhood so i’ve never had any second thoughts about these walks. When i grew older and was old enough to walk him, my father always told me to take him on walks in the night, i never thought why. i guessed he just liked the night more. i shook him again. Johnny come on dude. he wouldn’t wake up so i just decided to wait till tomorrow morning. he’s a fat old dog so i didn’t think anything of him sleeping in any longer. so i went to sleep and didn’t think much about it. 

but not too long after i fell asleep i heard thudding around in my kitchen. was johnny up? i got up and grabbed Johnny’s leash. now i can take him on a walk i mumbled to myself rubbing my eyes. johnny? i said walked down the stairs. you up buddy? usually he’d bark in response but i didn’t hear anything. johnny, let’s go on a walk bud, okay this is weird i again whispered to myself. I peeked the corner of the wall between the stairs and the living room. when i peeked the corner the rumbling stopped. johnny? i said again, now i was started to get creeped out. 

i stepped down and walked into the living room. Jesus christ johnny stop messing with me man. when i was younger johnny and i would play hide and seek. i thought that since he was older he wouldn’t be as interested in it. i guess i was wrong okay johnny! i said, ready or not here i come! i peeped around the couch and i instantly dropped the leash i was holding in my hands. j-johnny? i dropped to my knees and grabbed the bloody corpse on my floor, i cant see well? is this johnnys corpse or is it something else. i looked around and stood up when i saw the figure standing in the door frame of my kitchen. is this a goddamn prank? you think this is funny? i shouted. i picked up the leash and walked towards the figure. until the realization hit me, this wasn’t a human. what the fu- i shouted. i turned around a tripped over my own feet as i tried to run to the door, i sprained my ankle and the thing that was in the doorway was reaching for my shirt. 

i was freaking out and i froze up. i passed out and the last thing i remembered was my kitchen floor all cleaned up and Johnnys corpse was gone. for the next few days i was pacing around questioning what had just happened to me, i was even thinking about going to the police. I had so many questions was the thing my dog? how come my dad knew to only take him out at night?

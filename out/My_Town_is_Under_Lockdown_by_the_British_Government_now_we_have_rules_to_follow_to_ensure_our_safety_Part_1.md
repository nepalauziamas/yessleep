It was around 8am when all of this started, I was cleaning up my whole house after a family reunion, it was honestly so much fun and I’d kill to have that type of fun again. sorry I’ll try and not explain too
much about my life since I don’t want anyone to get bored. I decided to take out the trash since it was Wednesday and the Garbage Trucks we’re gonna come anytime soon. 

As I opened the door, that’s when I spotted military trucks and humvee’s start rolling into the neighbourhood. I was quite spooked by this so, i decided to quickly shut my door. Im quite a paranoid person and any little thing happens, I’ll just make it into a big deal. I decided to call my friends and family to see if they were okay but I hadn’t gotten a reply back, my calls weren’t even picked up as well. after about 6 Minutes of trying to call my Friends and Family about the situation, that’s when I heard a knock on the door. 

I opened it and i was greeted with a soldier wearing a hazmat suit, he had given me a letter and a button, explaining to me, that we had to follow certain rules while due to an unknown event that’s been recently going on which caused military action. my curiosity got the best of me and so I asked him what was going on.

“So, what’s with all this? And why am i not getting any signal, I can’t call, text my friends or family.” I asked, with a frustrated tone.

“Sir, we can’t tell you anything at the current moment. But please read the rules for your own safety” the soldier responding to my question 

“No, as a member of the public. I demand to know what was going on” I asked, protesting their demands 

“Sir, like I told you. We can’t tell you or anyone what’s going on, now please get back into your house and read the rules.” 

The Soldier gently pushed me into my house and shut my front door for me. I’ll admit, I was starting to get scared now as to what was going on. I didn’t even know if my family was okay

Since, my phone was my only source of entertainment yet it had no signal, so I couldn’t go on social media. I decided to turn on the TV to see if I could get any information on what was going on. 

When I turned the television on, an emergency alert sound invaded my ears. “As of Today a decision was made to place the town of Walston under Government Lockdown. You’ve been provided with a set of rules to follow until the all clear is given.”

After reading the Emergency Alert message, I decided to read the rules to get a better idea understanding of the situation:

Rules to Follow while you’re under Government Lockdown. 

Rule 1: You’re not allowed to leave your house at anytime of the day. food, water and clothes will be provided to you by the military, If you’re seen wandering around outside of your home. you’ll be immediately arrested on sight.

Rule 6: if you see or hear any movements in your house but you’re alone, do not attempt to investigate it. Lock yourself in a room with a weapon and press the panic button.

Rule 7: if however, you’ve lost your panic button, and Rule 6 or Rule 3 comes into place. Please refer to Rule X 

Rule X: if Rule 7 or Rule 6 or Rule 2, has directed you to Rule X, please carefully follow these instructions. 

Rule 2X: if you’re starting to experience any of the symptoms stated in Rule 2, please press your panic button. You’ll be immediately taken away and observed for the next 47 hours.

Rule 6X: if you’ve seen or heard any movements in your house, stated in rule 6 and you’ve lost your panic button. Please immediately take your own life, trust me. The alternative is far more worse 

I had re read the rules about multiple times, I was so scared. What was even going on? Was there an invasion going on? So many thoughts was running through my mind, I’d honestly never expected this to happen, especially in my lifetime. 

I was never prepared for this, i was hoping that this was just a bad dream that I’d immediately wake up from. I wanted answers, i deeply wanted answers, but i knew for a fact i couldn’t get any from the Military. That’s when I decided to come go onto Reddit as my last resort to see if anyone could try and piece together what was going on. Honestly, I’m scared and worried for my family and my life.

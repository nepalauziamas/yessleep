It was around 8am when all of this started, I was cleaning up my whole house after a family reunion, it was honestly so much fun and I’d kill to have that type of fun again. sorry back to what I was saying, I decided to take out the trash since it was Wednesday and the Garbage Trucks we’re gonna come anytime soon. 

As I opened the door, that’s when I saw multiple military vehicle start rolling into the neighbourhood and park in any spot they could find. I decided to quickly shut my door, as I was confused to what was going on. After about 6 Minutes of trying to call my Friends and Family about the situation, that’s when I got a knock on the door. 

I opened it and i was greeted to 2 soldiers with hazmat suits on, they had given me a letter and a button, explaining to me that they we had to follow certain rules while the military temporarily takes over, my curiosity got the best of me and I asked them what was going on.

“So, what’s with all this? And why am i not getting any signal, I can’t call, text my friends or family.” I asked, with a frustrated tone.

“Sir, we can’t tell you anything at the current moment. But please read the rules for your own safety” the soldier responding to my question 

“No, as a member of the public. I demand to know what was going on” I asked, protesting their demands 

“Sir, like I told you. We can’t tell you or anyone what’s going on, now please get back into your house and read the rules.” 

The Soldier gently pushed me into my house and shut my front door for me. I’ll admit, I was starting to get scared now as to what was going on. I didn’t even know if my family was okay

Since, my phone was my only source of entertainment. I decided to turn on the TV to see if I could get any information on what was going on. 

When I turned the television on, an emergency alert sound invaded my ears. “As of Today a decision was made to place the town of Walston under Government Lockdown. You’ve been provided with a set of rules to follow until the situation is cleared. If you haven’t read the rules handed to you, please do it now for your own safety” 

After reading the Emergency Alert message, I decided to read the rules to get a better idea understanding of the situation:

Rules to Follow while you’re under Government Lockdown. 

Rule 1: You’re not allowed to leave your house at anytime, you food, water and clothes will be provided to you by the military. If you’re seen wandering around at any time, you’ll be arrested on sight.

Rule 6X: if you’ve seen or heard any movements in your house, stated in rule 6 and you’ve lost your panic button. Please immediately take your own life, trust me. The alternative is far more worse 

I had re read the rules about multiple times, I was so fucking scared. What was even going on? Was there an invasion going on? So many thoughts was running through my mind, I’d honestly never expected this to happen, especially in my lifetime. 

I was never prepared for this, i was hoping that this was just a bad dream that I’d immediately wake up from. I wanted answers, i deeply wanted answers, but i knew for a fact i couldn’t get any from the Military. That’s why I decided to come to Reddit, if anyone could try and piece  together what was going on. Honestly, I’m scared and worried for my family and my life.

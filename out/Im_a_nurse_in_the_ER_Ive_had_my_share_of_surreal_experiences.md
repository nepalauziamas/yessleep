I could write a few books about all the strange and unusual, hard to imagine I can't make this shit up things I've encountered as an ER nurse. Especially, as a night shift nurse. But the book writing will have to wait for another time. 

This story I'm about to share took place April 17, 2021... exactly 5 months to the date my momma passed from COVID. Side note: I also lost my best friend and my daddy all within a 9 month period due to COVID. So to say the last couple of years have been a real struggle would be an understatement. I digress.

So, I'm on shift when  I'm asked by another nurse to attempt an IV on one her patients. I enter the room, introduce myself and this patient that I have never taken care of or spoken to before says to me "you have a wonderful aura about you" and before I have a chance to respond, she goes on to say, "and your mother is always with you". I instantly get chills but I try to hide my WTF reaction and continue with the task at hand. When I touch the patients arm to verify her wristband, she grabs my hand and looks  me directly in my eyes and proceeds to tell me very detailed things about my momma that only I would know. I was beyond emotional and shook by everything she is telling me, so much so  I had to excuse myself. I leave the room and run to the bathroom crying uncontrollably. I do my best to get it together when the lights in bathroom start flickering on and off for about two minutes... I literally just about pissed myself, but i get it together and ask if there was just an issue with the lights anywhere else. Nope... ok, no shocker there. 

I somehow get it together and go back to the room and apologize for previously running out so abruptly. The patient apoligizes to me for upsetting me. I  assure her that I am not at all upset. I  just was not expecting anything like that but, I was absolutely thankful she was willing to share her gift with me, and much needed. 

I take a deep breath and  I continue completing the initial task of placing an IV. I  continue about the rest of shif without too much chaos. After I settle down from my shift, I call my sister- in-law and tell her about my night, i explain to her all the details of my experience.  After my story, she tells me her son, my nephew, has something to tell me. He gets on the phone and shares his story, now around the same time this is going on with me at work, my nephew tells me he was having trouble sleeping, he couldn't really get comfortable so he sat up on the side of the couch and at that moment he says "I seen grandma, she was just standing there, it was her, i know it was" ... I comfort him and reasure him I believe him and there was nothing to be afraid of. I then tell him grandma was  busy making her rounds letting us know she's okay and is still watching over us and that she loves us. I admit I did  freak out a little at first, but more anything, I felt comforted in having that experience. I know my momma was just saying hey, I'm okay and I'm  still with you. Now, I don't know how everyone else feels about spirits, mediums, or whatever, but I'm a believer.  Thanks to those that took the time to read.

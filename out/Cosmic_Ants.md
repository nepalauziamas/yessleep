When I was six, I saw a man peering through my front door. He whispered at me, “thanks.” 

I had wet the bed a couple minutes prior to this, and like most kids do, I walked over to my parents’ bedroom for comfort.

It was sometime past midnight. I was stunned motionless, terrified on the inside. Yet I didn’t feel an immediate danger to myself.

He closed the front door, and I hurried to my parents’ room.

The next morning my parents explained the concept of dreams seeping into reality when you’re not quite fully awake. I didn’t buy it.

I didn’t think about that event until much later in my life. 

My dad died a couple years later of a heart attack. He was only 45. He was a good man. My mom raised me and only me from then on out. I tended to play by myself a lot, isolate myself—get caught up in those make-believe worlds in my own imagination.

I was thirteen when I noticed she had grown tired of me.

Her eyes didn’t light up when she talked to me anymore, or, how I’d imagined it when I was younger.

We weren’t wealthy by any means, but after she lost her job and picked up the bottle, poverty was an arm length away.

My birthday falls in the summer. All of my friends (all two of them) were on vacation during that day. I didn’t really mind though, because I had a full day to myself.

I was playing video games in by basement on June 5th, my sixteenth birthday.

I heard a shattering of glass upstairs, followed by a small silence, then heavy footsteps growing louder with each stride.

A loud, quick slam of the basement door rung out, followed by scraping and shuffling along the other side. It was strange, I remember thinking. My mother was probably asleep. She slept a lot.

No one else could get into our house. Until I remembered of a decade prior when someone did. 

My “dream.”

I grabbed my baseball bat and flung my scrawny body up the stairs ready for anything.

The door was locked.

The door does not have a lock. It most certainly does not have one on the outside of it.

Something must have been barricading the door.

I took a couple lunges at it, but the door probably did more damage to me, than I did to it.

Just before I was about to try and barge it down again, my ears went deaf, and I winced into a ball almost falling down the stairs.

-----

The neighbors called the police. They heard it too, but not as clearly as I did.

A policeman let me out of the basement to what I can only describe as a blur now. I was sixteen, but in that moment, I was a baby again. A police officer carrying me out of the basement shielding my eyes until we were out of the house. Police cars and ambulances flooded my small driveway.

I moved in with my aunt and uncle. They, and the police, all kept saying the same word: *suicide.*

The funeral was closed casket—understandable. I’m not sure any gunshot wound to the head should be open casket.

I didn’t think she had killed herself then.

My mom wasn’t happy, sure, but she wouldn’t do that.

I know there was someone else in my house that day.

The police say my mom barricaded me in the basement, but I knew back then that wasn’t true.

I was right, and I know that today.

I turned 22 last year. I was the sole inherent of my mother’s will, and while I finished high school and college, her house stood vacant.

Now that I had some free time away from schooling, six months after my birthday, I started the process of selling it.

“Selling it,” means bulldozing the lot. It’s a small house built in the 60’s that hadn’t been lived in for six years, so there’s no salvaging it.

I drove up to meet the realtor for the first time. I hadn’t been in that house, or even near it since I was 16. It stood like an old woman, cracked and seeping with sadness, knowing its inevitable end is all too close.

I was early. I paced up the walkway to the front door, not missing a beat. Of course, it was hard to come back. But I had the last six years of my life to think about this day and worry, so I was prepared.

I inserted the key, twisted it, and reached out for the handle, cold and metallic in the January air.

And just then, I had an indescribable itch. An itch in the back of my skull. My hands tingled. I was unsure if it came from the cold, or something else.

“I’m having a stroke,” I thought to myself. I stood still, unable to shake the terror and nerves flowing through me. 

Something came over me though, and I opened the door.

And just like that, the itch was scratched.

I stepped inside, and it was warm. I heard sounds of television, papers rustling, and drawers opening. To my left, in the living room, a Christmas tree stood.

The itch gradually returned and began to crawl up my spine to the back of my head again.

Perplexed at what I was witnessing, I took a couple steps forward. With each step, it was like watching a transition from a movie—almost like a time-lapse. I could see my mother, my father, and me. With each swing of my leg we would jump around the living room, wearing different clothes, aging, different times of day, different seasons and years would pass by.

The itch did not falter, and I started walking faster through my house as the itch grew and grew unbearable. I thought I was dying, and this was my life flashing before my eyes. As my pace grew faster, I felt more and more helpless with my steps, as if I wasn’t in control. I was being bombarded with memories and smells and sights and I felt like I was losing my mind—like the worst acid trip someone could be on.

Something inside me told me to keep walking but that GOD DAMN ITCH JUST KEPT GROWING! I FELT LIKE THERE WERE FUCKING COSMIC ANTS IN MY HEAD TICKLING MY BRAIN AND I HAD NO PLACE IN REALITY OR THE UNIVERSE AND I DIDN’T KNOW WHERE THE FUCK I WAS AND THAT GOD DAMN ITCH WAS GETTING WORSE AND WORSE! I FELT LIKE I WAS FLOATING AND EACH STEP FELT LIKE I WAS SWIMMING THROUGH MY OWN MEMORIES WHILE WATCHING MYSELF FLOAT AWAY FROM EARTH AND THE MILKY WAY AND THIS DEMENSION! MY PHYSICAL FORM WAS GONE AND MY BODY WAS SPREAD ACROSS THE UNIVERSE!

Until it wasn’t.

My feet planted. For the first time since opening the front door, I felt grounded. I felt stillness and tranquility, momentarily—I felt like I didn’t need to keep walking. I had my senses back. 

I stood in my kitchen and could hear the AC running. I could see Smirnoff bottles strewn across the counters, some had made their way onto the floor.

And I saw my mom, sitting in the only chair left in our living room. She was holding a shotgun, my dad’s old shotgun. She was facing away from me, so still, almost like a statue. I wondered if time was frozen.

“Mom?” I spoke through tight lips as my eyes began to well up.

“MOM!” She could not hear me. Or was pretending not to.

I grabbed a Smirnoff bottle and smashed in on the ground in hopes to get her attention. Nothing.

All of a sudden, I realized I heard the faint soundtrack from Mario coming from my left, towards the basement.

I turned back to my mom, who was now turning the shotgun towards herself. I felt sick and turned, knowing I didn’t want to see this unavoidable end.

I didn’t want to see it.

I didn’t want *me* to see it.

Quickly, I leapt over to the basement door and slammed it shut. I took the bookshelf and dragged it over to the door, setting up a small barrier.

I ran out of the house as quickly as I could and slammed the door behind me.

I heard no gunshot. I didn't hear anything from inside the house.

I was grounded in reality once again.

The cool January air swept across my body once again. 

I stood outside there for a moment, bewildered at the past the couple of minutes, and let it all sink in.

And once again, the tickle made its way to the back of my head. It wasn’t harsh or demanding like it was before. It was almost nice, in a way. An inviting numbness. 

I turned towards the door, and slowly opened it back up.

I could feel the heat from inside once again, but now it was dark in the house.

I could barely see the small boy coming down the stairs, then stopping in his tracks.

I said to him the only thing I could think of then,

“Thanks.”

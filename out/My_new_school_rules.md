I enrolled in a new school recently and my first day is just tomorrow. I was getting excited until the principal sent me an email. It was titled “First Day Rules”.

I opened them intrigued to see how much they differed from my old school, if I could chew gum or leave at lunch times to get my own food. But no, these rules were completely different. The email went:

Good morning 

It has come to my attention that it is your first day tomorrow, and I can’t wait to welcome you here. But our school has a different set of rules for day 1 as it does any other.

1. Do not try to use a map to find your classes, you will get lost. Instead follow the student in the green hat, he is your guide for the day.

2. The student in the green hat will never talk to you, and you should never talk to him if you want to make it past this day. You don’t want to know what happened to the last outgoing student.

3. You are fine to talk to any other students but if they try to talk to you about “The tomorrow” run.

4. Do not trust your eyes. If you see something odd in your peripheral vision then it isn’t actually there.

5. If the walls start to bleed notify the janitor. He can be found next to the grandfather clock.

6. When in class sometimes the teacher might tell you to wait on them outside. Take your stuff and walk out but if the hallway seems off, go to the classroom next door because you didn’t follow rule 1 properly.

7. Hopefully after you have changed classrooms you will be fine, but sadly the majority of the time you still aren’t. The only way to guarantee safety is to check the clock on the wall, if it has the numbers 1-12 on it then you’re fine, but if it has any different array of numbers then inform the teacher and if you are lucky they will change the clock.

8. Lunch will be served as a nice hot soup and a chocolate bar, but when you sit down it will change. No matter what it changes to if you value your eyesight eat it all before lunch ends.

9. As soon as eighth period starts you want to run from the student with the green hat. This period is a game of hide and seek, he will give you a five minute head start and you don’t want to find out what happens if you lose.

10. As soon as the final bell rings do not rush to the same door you used to get in the building, instead find the nearest window and jump out. No matter the height you will probably be fine.

If you follow these rules then you will be safe to come in for a normal day 2. Remember I am not in on the first day so do not trust anyone who claims to be me, and do not show anyone these rules.

Good luck.

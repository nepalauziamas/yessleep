Hi everyone,

I am writing this because I need to share a critical tip before you rent an AirBnB, and because, well… I need some advice…

This was my first time renting an AirBnB solo. I’ve stayed in one once before, but my fiancé, Travis, had handled everything. 

This time, I decided I was going to rent one near a national park in south Texas, because it’s so hard to find a hotel out there close to the park, plus I figured that the further I am from any light pollution, the better for seeing stars.

Growing up, my dad and I used to sit and watch the stars together. He’d give the major constellations silly names to make me laugh and those were pretty much the only stars you could see from our house anyways. The first time we went somewhere far away from light pollution, it blew my seven-year-old mind how many stars there were, and that there were billions more so far away I couldn’t see them.

It blew my mind again when I learned that by the time the light from the stars reaches us, they may be long dead and gone. But to us they are still here, that means something, right? That we can still make an impression long after we’re gone? 

I hope so. 

I’ve been thinking about the stars a lot lately. I’m staring at them right now actually, through the glass panels in the roof of this beautiful AirBnB. I can even see satellites moving. I guess there are worst places to spend eternity. That’s what the people in the walls and under the floor keep telling me at least.

Oh, so right, the advice.

Let me start with the AirBnB for some background.

The site had a note about how popular this place was, and how lucky I was that it was free during the exact time I needed it for. It was also a great deal because there was no cleaning fee whatsoever. It said I could extend my stay after I arrived, which appealed to me since I can work from anywhere, maybe I’d stay out here longer, clear my head, stay away from the apartment Travis and I used to share. I couldn’t be there without him. Watching the same shows, eating at the same table, just trying to live my ‘normal’ life but without him, even just thinking about it now makes me feel empty, wrong. I needed an escape where I could mourn without being constantly surrounded by memories of our life together. 

There were raving reviews about this property, and the adorable hosts, the couple with matching haircuts, Mike and Karen. (No, I am not changing their names to protect their identity, because I **want** you to know. Do **not** stay in a nice A Frame cabin rented by Mike and Karen near Big Bend National Park. In fact, I think they have properties across the US so to be safe just avoid anyone named ‘Mike and Karen’ on AirBnB at all costs). 

I am new to AirBnB, but the instructions still struck me as fairly odd. Looking back, they never lied to me, it was more so a lie of omission if anything. There was the usual, please confirm your arrival time, etc., but after booking, the further down I read, the more unusual the instructions got. This place was a good deal, had Wi-Fi, running water, power, and as I mentioned before, the glass panels in the roof to see the stars. I should’ve listened to my gut. Let me give you a sampling:

Checking in:

1. You can choose to extend the length of your stay! Message Mike and Karen for more info!
2. Please pick up the keys from the departing resident directly. Do not accept the keys by any other means, or you will be assessed an extra fee.
3. Free DoorDash delivery!
4. Please do not attempt to leave early. You will not receive a refund and Mike and Karen are not responsible for any damages incurred to you or your belongings.
5. Please send Mike and Karen a message once you receive the keys for more information.
6. Please be respectful and do not try and open the locked room at the end of the hall.

So #2 struck me as particularly odd, because when Travis and I stayed that other time, the former guest were long gone, and the place was cleaned between their stays and ours. #4 also struck me as odd. What, was someone going to show up and hit me with a crowbar if I left early? Slash my tires? I laughed at the thought at the time. I decided to go for it, and as you can probably guess, I have regrets.

As I walked up to the cabin, I was so done with driving that I really just wanted to hang out in the AC for a bit. I was surprised to see the door open the moment my knuckles hit it, and behind it, inches away, a man standing with a nervous expression on his face. He looked a bit ill, he had bags under his eyes and he was shivering slightly despite the heat. I had parked near his car, which looked like it had been sitting out in the sand and dust for quite a while. Sand had piled up on the windshield and had formed little dunes around the tires.

“Please, please come in” he nearly begged, his eyes darted around.

“Hey!” I said as I stepped inside, “I’m Dais—”

He put his hand up, cut me off, “Please, I’d rather not know”

What a delightful individual, I had thought to myself.

We stared at each other for a long moment, he squinted at me, as if debating something. I saw his suitcases piled up behind him.

“Here” he thrust the keys towards my face, breaking eye contact and staring at the floor. A bead of sweat rolled down his face.

It occurred to me briefly that being in a house with a stranger miles away from civilization was probably a terrible idea, another part of me wondered if I’d spend my vacation sick with a cold.

As soon as he handed me the keys, he immediately grabbed all of his bags, stepped sideways around me, and bolted out the door. It was bit odd, but whatever. I decided to take a quick tour.

As I made my way through and re-approached the front, I noticed he was gone, but had brought my bags in for me and placed my car keys on the key hook near the door. Okay, so he was odd, but polite?

I messaged the owners, “Hey! It’s Daisy. I’m checking in”

I got all my bags unpacked, set up my laptop to quickly check work emails, and plugged my phone in so I’d be ready to use it for directions and pictures later. I figured I’d give myself a few hours to relax from the drive and then go into the little nearby town.

I received a text about 20 minutes later.

‘New message from Mike and Karen’

“Hi Daisy! Thanks for staying in our home, we hope you enjoy your stay! Here is more information regarding your stay and checking out.

1. We will cover the cost of any food or groceries you have delivered to our home!
2. Microwaveable popcorn, wine, and snacks are in the pantry, please use anything you want! Food in the fridge is up for grabs too!
3. Please clean up any messes you may make, feel free to use the washer and drier!
4. You will not be able to leave until the next resident arrives. Leaving a positive review may help speed up the process!
5. You will need to hand the resident the keys directly. The new guest must be inside the home before you hand them the keys. Any other method of handling the keys will delay your check out.
6. Once the hand off has occurred, please help the new resident carry in their luggage before you leave. Do not provide them with any other information.

Oooookay.

I checked the snacks, the fridge, there was some pretty good stuff on hand. I decided to take a quick nap before heading out.

“Hi”

My eyes snapped open, I wasn’t sure how much time had passed, but it was dark already. Well, so much for any excursions today (I did not want to drive at night and risk hitting any local wildlife)

“Hiiiii”

The first time I had assumed I was waking up from a weird dream, but the second time, I definitely heard the voice. It sounded young. Like a little kid.

I jolted up in the bed so fast that my head was spinning

“…hello…?”, I ventured cautiously, looking around

No response. I slowly got up, and walked through the little house, turned on every light. I didn’t hear the voice again. 

“I’m here” she giggled

I froze. There was probably a normal explanation. Probably.

“Where are you? Are you outside? Are you lost?” I called out. It didn’t really sound like the voice was coming from outside (and there was nothing around for miles), but I figured it was worth a shot…

“We’re here, underneath” she whispered, “We never left”

Yeah no, I decided, I’d just go to town. Take my bags, sleep in a well lit parking lot, if I could find one. I’d just drive really slowly. I didn’t even care if I got charged some extra fee.

I quickened my pace as I gathered my bags. I threw open the front door but there was… nothing. Not like, nothing but the beautiful desert, there was truly nothing. I still can’t even describe it as anything other than complete and utter blackness. I turned on my phone flashlight and pointed it out the door, and the light went nowhere. It was just… darkness. I tentatively stuck my hand out, and it was like dipping my hand in ice water. I jumped backwards; my heart was pounding. I was confused, and trying to decide which of the two, between cold absolute darkness, or the cabin with a disembodied child’s voice, were my best bet.

“Please don’t do it” a sad quiet voice said directly in my ear, causing me to jump

This voice was different, it sounded like an older man.

I  dropped my bags in surprise, started to run, stopped, but tripped and fell towards the darkness anyways. As soon as my entire body left the doorframe, I felt like the world had turned sideways, pouring me out the front door into the darkness. I was falling and sinking through what felt like water, but thicker. It caught me by surprise, and before I had realized what was happening, I had already started to breathe it in through my nose and mouth, choking, thrashing in the darkness. I flailed, panicking, feeling nothing under my feet, the light from the open doorframe now above me, fading as I sunk deeper. I have this fear of any deep water or water where I couldn’t see the bottom, this was my literal worst nightmare. I had this feeling that if that if I lost sight of the light I’d never see any light ever again.

I closed my eyes, tried to calm down get my thoughts together, preserve my oxygen. I decided to pretend I was just at the beach swimming, the shore close by and sand a few inches below my feet, back home where the water is in the 50s even in the summer. Just a nice, normal dive into the ice cold water. Something brushed against my foot. Just seaweed, I told myself. I propelled myself upwards, upwards, the light from the doorframe I could detect behind my eyelids as I grew closer giving me a burst of resolve. I opened my eyes, grabbed on to the sides and launched myself through, falling onto the floor ungracefully on my face. I looked down panting, coughing, expecting my body, my mouth or nose to be dripping with some sort of the liquid where I had breathed it in, but everything was dry.

I slammed the door, locked it for good measure, and dropped down, sliding against it. I screamed in frustration.

I received a text immediately.

‘New message from Mike and Karen’

“Hi! It looks like you were attempting to violate the terms of your rental agreement! As a gentle reminder, you will not be able to leave until the next resident arrives. Leaving a positive review may help speed up the process!”

“What the hell is going on?” I texted back angrily

They replied immediately

‘New message from Mike and Karen’

“Hi! It looks like you were attempting to violate the terms of your rental agreement! As a gentle reminder, you will not be able to leave until the next resident arrives. Leaving a positive review may help speed up the process!”

“Fuck you Mike and Karen”, I muttered 

“I’m sorry”, the man’s voice again

I didn’t even jump this time, just pulled my knees to my chest and sobbed.

After a few minutes, when I thought it through and it sounded like the owner of the voice was better than whatever the hell was outside the front door I decided to respond.

“Can you tell me what’s happening?”, I asked, feeling a bit silly talking to the empty hallway.

“I’m sorry, but you will never leave this place the same person that you were when you came”, he sounded apologetic, not like he was trying to scare me. His matter of fact tone freaked me out a bit more.

“What do you mean? What is this place?” I’d already had enough freaky experiences here that I didn’t need much convincing.

“We're not sure, but we do know that the longer you are here, this place consumes a bit more of you. The only way any part of you can ever leave is to hand the keys to someone else. If you leave quickly, this place still takes something from you, but if it takes too long…” he paused, sighed, “You will never leave at all. You will become a part of this place”

“What happens if I decide to never hand the keys to someone else?”

“Hi” the little girl from before piped up again, like she was next to me, more of a whisper

“Hi” I whispered back

“I’m Janis, with an s”

“Hi Janis with an s” I smiled despite myself, “I’m Daisy”

“That’s what I did, refuse to try and invite someone and hand over the keys”, a third voice chimed in, “Oh and I’m Marion. With an M”, she laughed

“What happened?”

“I never left, never handed the keys to anyone else. Eventually someone came anyways, I guess based on the reviews. And Mike came, that son of a bitch” 

Janis gasped and said “ooooh”, 

Marion continued, I pictured her shushing Janis, “I was already… gone. It was like he knew. He came not long after and took my suitcases, cleaned up the mess I made when I realized I was never leaving this damn place – and he handed the keys off to the next person. He and Karen seem to be able to come and go, no problem. Those pieces of” she paused, as if considering her language “…garbage”.

“I’m sorry, Marion. Everyone”

We were all quiet for a while. At first I paced angrily, decided that this couldn’t possibly be real, then nervously, as it sunk in.

Eventually, despite the situation, I popped some popcorn, and sat down. I’m a stress eater, so yes, it was a lot of popcorn. I couldn’t sleep, so I spent the night googling, trying to find anything I could. Like I do every night, I listened to my last voicemail from Travis, the one where he calls saying goodnight, that he was on his way home from work and would see me in the morning. The one time he never came home. Once I was fully emotionally and mentally exhausted, I had another question.

“Um hey”, I asked no one in particular, “What’s outside the front door?”

“We aren’t quite sure, anyone who has gone out that door for more than a few minutes without handing off the keys hasn’t come back”,  I wondered if the owner of the voice had ever been happy; how long he had been here.

“There’s a scary monster out there, it scratches at the door sometimes” Janis whispered, she sounded so scared. I wished I could give her a hug, but I couldn’t see her, I moved my arms around, couldn’t feel her even though it sounded like she was right there next to me.

I looked outside, I could see the faint suggestion of the mountains. I clicked my keyfob, the car beeped and the headlights flashed and illuminated the area around it. It looked normal enough. The stars shone through the ceiling panels. “What happens if I go out the windows? Or the panels in the roof?”

“Same thing as the door, but much harder to get back in. Hey this is Gareth” It was a fourth voice, discernable by the heavy accent.

“How many of you are there here?”

“Eh,” He paused as if doing an invisible headcount, “35 right now.”

“How long do I, uh, have?”

“About a week and a half, I’d say”

“Oh, that’s longer than I thought. What happens after that?”

“Yeah tell that to the one guy that rented middle of summer. Harder to rent a place in the desert when it’s mid-July”, Gareth huffed

“What happened to him?”

“He went out the door on the tenth day, never came back.”

“Oh.”

There was a long stretch of silence.

“If you stay longer, you will eventually become part of this place, just like the walls, or the floors” it was the sad man again. He still won’t tell me his name, part of me wonders if he’s been here so long that he's forgotten it.

It’s the seventh night right now, and I’m starting to feel weird, woozy like when I get really bad carsickness, and I’m cold all the time now. I’m still ordering food and drinking water (which the delivery person can deliver inside the door oddly enough), so it’s got to be this place.

The others seem to think that even if you do leave, you never fully recover, like a portion of you stays here forever and you’re never ‘whole’ again. They say they still experience echoes of those that have left, like a partial recording stuck on a loop.

So, there you have it. 

I tried burning the house down last night, and nothing happening, the flame wouldn’t catch on anything except my hair (I’m fine, at least in that aspect). A few nights ago, I threw the keys out the door, but they just ended up back on the counter by the next morning. A boy named Johnny was telling me his mom had tried that too. His mom said she’d also tried lodging them down the drain, flushing them, but once her family was ‘gone’, Mike came by, fished them out, handed them off to the next resident.

There is some tension here between those that couldn’t hand the keys off in time but tried, and those that resolved to never do so. 

I do sometimes hear echoes of those that did physically leave, they sound further away, repeat the same nonsense phrases from time to time. Somehow that creeps me out more than the people that are still here.

The thing was scratching at the front door this morning.

I’m thinking of putting the keys in my pocket, going out there again. I feel like whatever is out there, maybe if it takes me and the keys at the same time, neither of us will come back. I have a few days left and I am absolutely **not** handing the keys to anyone.

Do you have any ideas? I’m running out of days and I’m not sure if my only idea left will even work. 

If I can’t get anything else to work soon, I’m going to try that. If I can end this cycle, maybe I can make an impression still, long after I’m gone.

Oh, and fuck Mike and Karen.

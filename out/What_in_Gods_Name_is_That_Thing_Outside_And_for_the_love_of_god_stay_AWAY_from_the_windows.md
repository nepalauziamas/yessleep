My home is in Mesquite, Texas. I was born and raised in a suburban area, but I awoke at around 4 AM with the strangest feelings. I’m a girl, maybe I’ve just started my period. So, I went back to sleep. I woke up 7 hours later, at 11AM. It was still dark outside, maybe I just slept for like 10 minutes and woke back up. Well, that is what I thought until I looked at my phone. 11 missed calls. 39 unread messages. I live with my boyfriend who wakes up every morning to go work at the office. He usually leaves at five, which he in fact did. He was right next to me when I woke at 4, after all. There was 4 missed calls from my boyfriend, and the rest from mom and dad, who live about a mile away. The texts are normal, from my boyfriend, he checks in on me alot while he’s at work. There were 13 from my parents alone.

It was still dark. The moon was out. No stars. However, I could not see any lights from houses or buildings. The text messages and calls stopped at exactly 9:43AM. If they were that concerned, I feel like they might have texted and called more. What is really unusual, however, is that those incessant notifications didn’t wake me up. I’m a super light sleeper, so that’s weird. Anyway, maybe this is a dream, I’ve been trying to lucid dream for some months now. I’ll do a reality check here soon, if it turns out things are really wrong then I will update. It is currently 11:07AM

Update 11:27AM

I am fucking panicking right now. The reality check failed. It seems this is real life.. but how? This time of year, the sun is usually up by 7AM.

Update 12:44PM

I have barricaded myself in my attic. I have tried calling my family 47 times now and it seems I have no service. It is still pitch black outside. I am super lucky to live in this neighborhood though, or else I’d still have no idea what’s going on. We have lines connecting these houses for miles that transmit morse code. I was able to contact my neighbors. Here is a direct transmission from the one across from me:

BILL GONE (STOP) LOOKED AT WINDOW DIED (STOP) SOMETHING OUTSIDE (STOP) AYLA RAMIREZ GONE TOO (STOP) WHAT ON EARTH IS OUT THERE (STOP) at 12:04PM

That was the Millers. Next I contacted the Ramirez’s

WHY SO DARK (STOP) WHY SO COLD (STOP) MY DAUGHTER GONE (STOP) STAY AWAY FROM THE WINDOWS (STOP) at 12:39PM

It’s a good thing it’s so cold. Since I’m in Texas, our attics are unbearably hot.

Update 12:50PM

I tried contacting the Millers once more. Only Bertha Miller is left, and I think she just fucked up.

MY BABY GONE (STOP) CRIED TOO LOUD (STOP) at 12:48PM

I heard her shrieking shortly after I received that. Then it abruptly stopped. I will update in a few hours.

Update 4:27PM

It has been around 12 hours since I woke up in the middle of the night. I can’t talk to the Ramirez’s. I already know the Millers are gone, and while hiding, I could hear numerous screeches. I got an EAS Alert on my phone warning of an “Anomalous Entity” I have transcribed it to you:

EAS In effect. This is not a drill. EAS In effect. This is not a drill. Numerous Anomalous Entities Have Been Sighted in the Greater Dallas Area. These Entities resemble an aggressive behavior and will attack whether provoked or not. The United States government warns all residents of Fort Worth, Arlington, Dallas, and surrounding cities to stay inside and away from windows. Keep all windows and doors locked at all times. Remain as quiet as possible. Your military is on their way. Please text 9829907 to include your name, address, city/town, color of home and amount of people inside.

I’m hoping the military will get here soon. I’ve just been trying to listen to music on my earphones to calm down.

Update 5:34PM

I got a new EAS Alert. Here it is:

EAS In effect. This is not a drill. EAS In effect. This is not a drill. Similar Anomalous Entities Sighted in Waco, Houston, and the outskirts of New Orleans. All residents of Texas, Oklahoma, and Louisiana are advised to stay indoors at all times. Keep windows and doors locked at all times, and keep as quiet as possible. Your military are on their way. Please text 9829907 to include your name, address, city/town, color of home and amount of people inside. 

I made a huge mistake. By barricading my attic I now cannot reach the downstairs without making a ton of noise. Besides that, I hear something down there. Pacing. I hope to god it's not one of those things. 

Update 5:57PM

Banging. Screeching. It's been constant. I am now confident they have breached my home. No new EAS or military. I think they might know where I am. They're trying to get up. I must have fucked up somehow. It's still pitch black. Please, I live at 406 Irving Lane, if you can, send help. I'm not sure how much longer I will last. 

Update 6:01PM

I got a call from my boyfriend. I am freaking the fuck out right now because I am 100 percent sure that wasn't my boyfriend. He sounded.. off. I think they're trying to bait me. Please help me. It is pitch black outside and there is no sign of military activity.

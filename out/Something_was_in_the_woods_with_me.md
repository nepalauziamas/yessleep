Hi I live in Romania and I am a thrill seeker. I recently turned 28. This happened 2 years ago. I was gone camping with 2 friends. Let's call them X and Y. They are close friends of mine. They got into my car because I am the only one that knows to drive. We got into a forest that is relatively near us. We decided to camp in a meadow. This meadow was relatively big. We set up our tents. We saw a forest ranger walking near us. He asked us what are we doing. X said that we were camping and that we aren't hear to cause trouble. The ranger was ok with that and gave X a piece of paper before he left. We didn't think anything of that at the moment. But Y insisted on reading it. It was a list what I can only name rules. They were quiet strange. They were saying:

1. Don't go in the woods alone at any time especially at night
2. If you hear anything don't panic. It's not coming for you
3. If you hear screaming while in the woods run and hope that it doesn't catch you. Don't look back
4. (only for groups of 2 or more) If you find yourself alone with your friends gone don't worry. Go back in your tent until you hear movement
5. If rule 4 is happening at night make a run for your car. If you got here by foot go to the watch tower. It is safe there
6. If you are in your tent at night and hear movement don't make a sound
7. It is not safe to leave your tent at night
8. If you need to go to the bathroom everyone shall go together. It will not attack large groups

"Make sure to follow all of these rules" It said on the back.

We thought This was a joke but Y insisted on following these rules. He is superstitious and believes in old myths and legends. He somehow convinced us. But X asked : "What is IT?". It placed a chill on my spine. We already started to get scared. We suddenly heard a scream for far away. We were still in the meadow. Rule 3 didn't say anything about the meadow. The screams got farther until we couldn't hear them anymore. We were safe from now. We wanted to leave but we didn't notice what it was getting dark. We were trapped here for one night. None of us wanted to risk it. We started a small campfire. I went into my tent to get a flashlight and where I got out I didn't see them. I immediately remembered the firs rule and got into my tent and zipped my tent up. It wasn't night. It was almost down but not quite down. I waited until I heard footsteps. I got out of the tent and I saw them. I asked them where they have gone and they said that they didn't leave the campfire. I was creeped out of my mind. The only thing that stopped me from going to the car was rule 1. We staid the night and but X needed to go to the bathroom and we needed to go with him. We heard whispers and tried to make no noise. We got back to our tents and went to sleep. We heard something Moving near the campfire. We made no noise and it eventually disappeared. At down we packed our stuff and left the woods. This is my story.  Follow these rules for your own safety.

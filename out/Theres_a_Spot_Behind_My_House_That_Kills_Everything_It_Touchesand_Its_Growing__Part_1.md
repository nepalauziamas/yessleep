I used what little savings I had to rent the cabin for the summer. A good 30 minutes from any kind of real civilization, it was the perfect place to find out what I wanted to do with the rest of my life. 

It turns out I simply wanted to survive. 

I spent most of the days hiking in the untamed wilderness around the cabin, going down to the river and enjoying those rare idyllic summer days you have to savor in western Washington. It was on one of those hikes when I found The Dead Spot. 

One of my other activities was admiring the family of rabbits which laid claim to the lawn at the front of my cabin - relentlessly eating the grass and shitting pellets. They were the closest thing I had to companions and I was saddened whenever I noticed I stopped seeing any of them. 

I was mad at myself when I startled one of the baby rabbits when I was walking behind my cabin that wet afternoon. I watched the poor thing flee from my clumsy booted footsteps and into the thick brush outside of my path. 

I watched the fragile baby suddenly stop on a little patch of dead grass and roll onto its side - then go still. I waited for it to move again. It didn’t. *Had I scared the thing to death?*

I came back to the patch the next day in hopes to find the baby rabbit gone, giving me some hope that it recovered and went back to its young life. I found the opposite - the rabbit’s body stuck there frozen exactly as it had been before. 

The rabbit was joined by the dead bodies of two birds and a squirrel. All lying there, stiff and dead in a little circle that wasn’t more than a couple feet tall and wide. 

I fought my initial instinct to investigate further and went home, making a mental note to just keep an eye on that spot in the woods going forward. 

The eye I kept on that spot in the woods in the following days was rather disturbed. The bodies of forest creatures just kept piling up there. Soon I was looking at a dozen different mammals and a couple lizards who had expired in that spot. 

And the space got larger - it was now a 10-foot radius of death and even the foliage was dying within it - the greenery wilting and revealing dark dirt beneath. 

The growing dead space seemed to coincide with the loneliness and depression that was choking me inside that cabin. I had brought the isolation on myself, thinking it would clear my head, and it did, it just turned out once all the bullshit of work, friends, family, and relationships were gone that the bones of my brain were sad as hell. 

The truth was my girlfriend breaking up with me was a major catalyst in my retreat from society. I came home one day and all of Alexa’s stuff was gone from our apartment. She said I was stuck in life. I was. I gave no protest. 

I soothed myself by getting drunk and high all alone every night. My home craft cocktail mixology “hobby” had regressed in a full on drinking problem as I just mixed whiskey and ginger beers until I ran out of ginger beer and then just drank the whiskey. 

I kept checking the spot in the woods I now called The Dead Spot and more and more dead animal bodies kept piling up - there was now even a full grown deer. The Dead Spot also kept getting bigger and bigger and I worried as it seemed it eventually could get to my cabin. 

The Internet provided help and fear. I found a few people on Reddit who talked about and documented their encounters with Dead Spots like mine - posting photos of the growing circle and the mounting bounty of dead animals. 

Rather discomforting was all of these people who were posting about it suddenly just stopped posting one day and then their accounts never had any kind of activity. 

I was actually about to leave the cabin when Alexa showed up in the middle of the night. 

I was already drunk. I asked no questions. I just embraced it and thanked myself for drunkenly texting her the address to the cabin a few nights before. 

We drank and had sex until we fell asleep tangled up in each other like a human pretzel. 

I woke up in a haze. Still drunk. Wondering if what happened the night before actually happened. Especially because Alexa wasn’t there next to me. Though I could smell her perfume. 

I followed her scent outside where I was horrified to see Alexa, in the flesh, walking from the direction of The Dead Spot.

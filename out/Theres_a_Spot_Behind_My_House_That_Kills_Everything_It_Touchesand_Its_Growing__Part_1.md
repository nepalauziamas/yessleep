I used what little savings I had to rent the cabin for the summer. A good 30 minutes from any kind of real civilization, it was the perfect place to find out what I wanted to do with the rest of my life. 

It turns out I simply wanted to survive. 

I spent most of the days hiking in the untamed wilderness around the cabin, going down to the river and enjoying those rare idyllic summer days you have to savor in western Washington. It was on one of those hikes when I found The Dead Spot. 

One of my other activities was admiring the family of rabbits which laid claim to the lawn at the front of my cabin - relentlessly eating the grass and shitting pellets. They were the closest thing I had to companions and I was saddened whenever I noticed I stopped seeing any of them. 

I was mad at myself when I startled one of the baby rabbits when I was walking behind my cabin that wet afternoon. I watched the poor thing flee from my clumsy booted footsteps and into the thick brush outside of my path. 

I watched the fragile baby suddenly stop on a little patch of dead grass and roll onto its side - then go still. I waited for it to move again. It didn’t. *Had I scared the thing to death?*

I came back to the patch the next day in hopes to find the baby rabbit gone, giving me some hope that it recovered and went back to its young life. I found the opposite - the rabbit’s body stuck there frozen exactly as it had been before. 

The rabbit was joined by the dead bodies of two birds and a squirrel. All lying there, stiff and dead in a little circle that wasn’t more than a couple feet tall and wide. 

I fought my initial instinct to investigate further and went home, making a mental note to just keep an eye on that spot in the woods going forward. 

The eye I kept on that spot in the woods in the following days was rather disturbed. The bodies of forest creatures just kept piling up there. Soon I was looking at a dozen different mammals and a couple lizards who had expired in that spot. 

And the space got larger - it was now a 10-foot radius of death and even the foliage was dying within it - the greenery wilting and revealing dark dirt beneath. 

The growing dead space seemed to coincide with the loneliness and depression that was choking me inside that cabin. I had brought the isolation on myself, thinking it would clear my head, and it did, it just turned out once all the bullshit of work, friends, family, and relationships were gone that the bones of my brain were sad as hell. 

The truth was my girlfriend breaking up with me was a major catalyst in my retreat from society. I came home one day and all of Alexa’s stuff was gone from our apartment. She said I was stuck in life. I was. I gave no protest. 

I soothed myself by getting drunk and high all alone every night. My home craft cocktail mixology “hobby” had regressed in a full on drinking problem as I just mixed whiskey and ginger beers until I ran out of ginger beer and then just drank the whiskey. 

I kept checking the spot in the woods I now called The Dead Spot and more and more dead animal bodies kept piling up - there was now even a full grown deer. The Dead Spot also kept getting bigger and bigger and I worried as it seemed it eventually could get to my cabin. 

The Internet provided help and fear. I found a few people on Reddit who talked about and documented their encounters with Dead Spots like mine - posting photos of the growing circle and the mounting bounty of dead animals. 

Rather discomforting was all of these people who were posting about it suddenly just stopped posting one day and then their accounts never had any kind of activity. 

I was actually about to leave the cabin when Alexa showed up in the middle of the night. 

I was already drunk. I asked no questions. I just embraced it and thanked myself for drunkenly texting her the address to the cabin a few nights before. 

We drank and had sex until we fell asleep tangled up in each other like a human pretzel. 

I woke up in a haze. Still drunk. Wondering if what happened the night before actually happened. Especially because Alexa wasn’t there next to me. Though I could smell her perfume. 

I followed her scent outside where I was horrified to see Alexa, in the flesh, walking from the direction of The Dead Spot.

Alexa looked as painfully beautiful as she had the night before. Yet, now I was not excited to see her. I was horrified. 

“Did you know there’s like 50 dead animals back there?” Alexa asked as we embraced in a hug that I was suddenly unsure was a good idea. 

“Did you go into where they are?” I asked back. 

Alexa thought about it for a few painful seconds that felt like hours to me. 

“I walked through, but I didn’t touch anything,” Alexa answered. 

I didn’t know what to do with that. I just looked into her soft brown eyes on the perfect sunny morning and went back to the cabin with her. 

Whatever was done was done and it was our future.

Alexa worked remotely so she was able to stay at the cabin indefinitely. I never asked her about her plans and she never asked about mine. We just went about our old routines. 

Except someone texted her, constantly. I let it go. I was just happy to have her there with me. 

We never talked about or went anywhere near The Dead Spot. We went down to the river every day when she was done with work. We went into town a few times and stocked up on groceries for our favorite pastime - cooking dinner together with drinks. 

Everything seemed fine until I woke up in the middle of the night without Alexa in the bed. I rushed out of the cabin and found her in the middle of The Dead Spot - which now stretched for yards, filled with even more dead animals.

Alexa was squating naked in the middle of The Dead Spot - staring off at nothing. I stood on the outside of the perimeter until she was done and I got her attention. 

She came out of The Dead Spot and explained she must have been sleep walking. 

Other things started to happen with her. She talked less. Her body temperature grew colder. She ate almost nothing. She lost like 10 pounds in just a few days. 

It felt like she was wasting away. Yet, we still never talked about The Dead Spot, which I assumed was still creeping up to the back wall of the cabin from behind. 

I can’t even remember exactly how many days this took place over. The time at the cabin was like an out of body experience. 

I do remember waking up one morning to Alexa leaving again. It was sunrise. I woke up without her in the bed. I found her outside, putting the last of her things into her car. 

I didn’t protest. I just let her go. She gave me a hug and a kiss before she did.

The first thing I did was check the progress of The Dead Spot. It had reached the back of the cabin and I hadn’t even realized it. A dead raccoon was frigid against the back of the cabin, just the wall between my bed and its body. 

It was time for me to go as well.

I moved back to the city. Got a normal apartment and eventually a new job. 

I wondered if my exposure to The Dead Spot was ever going to affect me. It didn’t seem to. 

I kept an eye on Alexa via Instagram. She was active as soon as she left the cabin. Seemingly living her normal life. 

Shortly after the cabin, the same man kept appearing, starting to pop up in her stories, and then eventually into her posts. It was a painful evolution for me, but one that I stomached. I was just happy she was alive and well.

Then one day she was gone. Her account was deleted. I wasn’t just blocked either. I wasted hours doing all you have to do to ensure that’s the case. 

I’ve been waiting for a long time now and she hasn’t come back. I’ve thought about reaching out to her other ways, but have held off. I want to just let her go and I don’t want to think about that Dead Spot. 

Though I can’t help but think about going back to that cabin and seeing if it’s still there. 

But something tells me I shouldn’t.

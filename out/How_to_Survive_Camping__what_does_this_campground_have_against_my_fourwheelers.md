I run a private campground.  I wish I could say that the worst thing I have to deal with in this job is spreading manure around as fertilizer but no, I’ve got bodies to dispose of, spiders inside of brussels sprouts to contend with, and [bargains with sentient mounds of jellied flesh to fulfill](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/l7itgz/how_to_survive_camping_dont_follow_the_gummy/).

If you’re new here, you should really [start at the beginning](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/clp5h4/how_to_survive_camping/) and if you’re totally lost, [this might help](https://www.reddit.com/r/goatvalleycampgrounds/comments/fz6a1d/how_to_survive_camping_index/).

I haven’t seen much of Beau lately.  He’s not been showing up in the mornings anymore.  Not since the whole thing with the thorns.  I guess he was off being sulky that I didn’t heed his warning.  I was looking forward to seeing the look on his face when I figured out all on my own how to get rid of the thorns in my lungs AND the thorns all over the campground.

...who am I kidding, he only has two expressions - disinterest and annoyance - and I don’t think he’ll be adding surprise to the list anytime soon.

Well, I was still holding out hope for a single eyebrow raised in mild disbelief.  I think that’d be as close as I’ll get to a compliment.

If you’re questioning my confidence right now, well, I feel it’s merited.  I was right about the gummy bears being spawned from the beliefs of a long-dead civilization.  Considering my theories are wrong more often than not, that’s quite an accomplishment in my book.

I do try to do my research and while a lot of this is guesswork based on unreliable sources, sometimes I get lucky, I suppose.  With Mattias’s journal though, I’m hoping we’ll stop being lucky and start being *right*.

My brother has the journal indexed.  He’s gone through and marked which parts seem to relate to which creature.  He spends a lot of time reading while holding his daughter.  He tells me that she’ll quiet down as soon as he sits down to read with her and it’s funny, it’s almost like her eyes are tracking on the pages.  I’ve been telling myself that this is fine, the fairies are technically on my side right now, but also this is a changeling and changelings are evil little shits so I can’t help but be a *little* alarmed.

He gave me all the page numbers that referenced the hall.  I did my research and I made a plan.  While Mattias didn’t have reason to request anything from the gummy bear king, he did have reason to make a hasty exit at one point.  Attempted murder is liable to piss off anyone, inhuman or not.  So Mattias tried to kill the gummy bears in their own lair, it failed spectacularly, and then he had to flee.  And you think *I’m* reckless.  Despite the failed assassination attempt, he at least successfully escaped, and bless him, he wrote down how he did it.

I’ve learned the importance of having a reliable escape route, after the thing in the dark swatted my four-wheeler like it was a cat toy.

All that was left was to secure an offering to the gummy bears.  They wouldn’t give me what I wanted if they didn’t believe I was going to leave them a live human being in exchange.  Now, a lot of you had suggestions for the sorts of individuals that this world would perhaps be better off without or perhaps wouldn’t mind a swift departure from existence.  I’m sure I could make any of those options work.  However, much like myself, this town has selective morality.  Losing some people due to predation by the creatures that inhabit my campground?  Yes, fine, this is merely the natural consequences of existing alongside the inhuman realm.  Offering someone as a sacrifice for a bargain with these evil things?  Oh hell no.

I could argue that this was necessary to keep the town safe and I might sway them to my side but it’d take a town hall meeting and likely most of what little political capital I retain around here.  I’d have to deal with malicious rumors for years to come.  Kate made a bargain with one of those things.  Kate can’t be trusted.  Who knows what else she’s made agreements with?

For the record, they don’t know about Beau and they aren’t going to find out.

And finally... last time I dealt with a human sized gummy bear I wound up with some of its splattered remains *in my mouth*.  I’d prefer to keep them largely confined to creatures that are easily punted into the nearest tree.

So in order to trick the gummy bears I needed a willing accomplice.  Yes, yes, I know cheating has its own risks, but it sometimes works out in the stories.  It’s a valid strategy.  Humans can get away with it.

I thought about asking my brother, but that hardly seemed fair.  He’s got a new daughter and technically she’s a changeling, but at some point she’s going to be the real deal and I shouldn’t endanger him unnecessarily.  Not when I had other options.  I needed someone with enough sense to know when to run but perhaps not enough self-preservation to know when to say ‘no’.  Most of my full time staff don’t fulfill the latter requirement and my part-time staff don’t fulfill the former.  There was one person I could think of, though they weren’t local and might require some additional enticement.  It was worth a try.

I dialed up a number that had been included with a Christmas card that I was frankly a little surprised to get.  The woman on the other end didn’t seem too surprised when she picked up and I said who it was.

“Want to pull a Prometheus with me?” I asked.

“That turned out pretty badly in the myth,” Turtle replied.

“I’ve managed to pull it off.”

“Yeah, I know, I keep up with the posts.  So what are you planning, boss?”

Aw.  She still calls me boss.

“Yeah, I’ll do it,” she said when I explained the plan.  “But I want full access to your library, family notes, *and* the photocopier.”

The photocopier is very old and I’m amazed it still works.  I don’t like other people using it because I’m afraid they’ll press the keys the wrong way (I’m not being paranoid, there really is a right way with this thing) and then I’ll have to spend money on a new photocopier.  But I agreed, after making Turtle promise she’d be very careful when making copies.

A few days later Turtle arrived.  I let her have access to my study and the photocopier while I checked the traps for a gummy bear.  It took a few days but I’ve got a guest bedroom and Turtle went through an entire package of paper making copies.  When I found one, I radioed her and told her where to meet me.  She brought my four-wheeler.  We were going to do this the easy way.  I strapped the cage down on the back and hopped on and instead of spending hours following a crippled jellified raccoon, we spent like fifteen minutes driving in a circle through the deep woods.  Then I set the cage down, released the gummy bear, and took a crowbar to its squishy little body as soon as it crawled out.

Everything proceeded just as before.  The smoke escaped from its remains and rolled uphill and the trees bent sideways, twining their branches together to form a doorway.

“You sure you’re ready for this?” I asked Turtle just before we stepped through.

“Got my running shoes on, boss.”

We’d agreed the night before that if something went wrong we would escape using zombie apocalypse rules.  You didn’t have to outrun the gummy bears, you just had to outrun the other person.  Considering I work outdoors and Turtle works in a bakery/bookshop, I was pretty certain I was the one with better cardio.

We entered the hall together.  In my right hand I carried the item that would be the key to our escape.  Turtle carried a flashlight and she shone it into the shadows near the wall.  Black smoke quickly dispersed out of sight wherever the beam of light fell.  After a bit of this Turtle turned it off.  No sense antagonizing them.  We were presumably here to parley, after all.

We found the dais with the gummy bear king already enthroned, its stone teeth and eyes jiggling unnervingly in its gelatinous mass.

“I brought you a body,” I said.  “See?  I’ve kept my end of our bargain.”

“Uh,” Turtle stammered.  “Um.”

She’d tried to think of a script to really sell the idea that she’d been brought here deceitfully but she’s not that great of an actress so I suggested she not say anything at all.  However, the nervous stammering she improv’d was actually working quite well.  She legitimately sounded suddenly alarmed and I glanced around quickly to make sure nothing was crawling out of the shadows at us.  There was nothing.  Turtle was just nervous.

“It will suffice,” the gummy bear king bubbled.  “I shall give it to one of my people.  Perhaps the feel of living flesh will remind them.”

“Remind them of what?”

Beside me, Turtle shifted nervously.  She took a step away, towards the exit, and I absently reached out and grabbed her arm to stop her from fleeing.  It was meant to be reassuring, acknowledging that we were in this together, but Turtle jumped a little and looked even more nervous.  Her face was pale and her eyes were wide.  I’d tried to prepare her for what we’d see, but I guess I hadn’t done a good enough job of it.  Had she ever dealt with the gummy bears during the summer she worked here?  I couldn’t recall.

“None remember what we were,” it sighed.  “Those that created us are nothing but a vague memory and so we have been forgotten.  And because no one knows us anymore, my people no longer know themselves.”

“You remember,” I said.

“I was their king.  I had a name.  I don’t recall what it was, but the weight of it echoes.  Someday that, too, will die away and then this hall and everything within it will be gone.”

There was such sorrow in its voice.  Like the master of the vanishing house, desperately clinging to life, begging to be worshipped or feared or loved so that it might live another day, another year, or more.  These creatures, too, were fading away.  It was only a matter of time and here was their king, asking only for some small comfort for its people before they faced oblivion.

The guilt stabbed through me for what I intended to do.

“So how do I get rid of the thorns?” I asked.

“The Partholan came from the land of the dead, they say,” it sighed.  “We, too, are affiliated with death.  And when the disease started to take them and when they realized that their end was upon them, they dug their own graves.  We carry that death inside us.  Come closer, campground manager.”

I walked close and put one foot up on the dais.  Behind me, I heard Turtle squeak my name nervously.  I glanced back to see what the matter was and found the smoke starting to billow inwards from the shadows, creeping closer to her feet in anticipation of taking her flesh for its own.

“Hey, don’t block off my exit,” I snapped, “lest I think you’re making this bargain in bad faith.”

In the stories, humans can lie as much as they wish.  Inhuman things typically aren’t so unrestrained.

The smoke recoiled and Turtle let out an audible sigh of relief.

“Hold out your hand,” the gummy bear king commanded.

I did.  And it spat a tooth out.  The small stone landed on my palm, sticky with slime.  I remembered, vividly, the remains of the human gummy bear splattering across my face and it took an act of will to not drop the stone and rub my hand raw against my jeans in a compulsive attempt to get the feel of it off my skin.

“Thanks,” I said, my composure strained.  “What do I do with this?”

“I cannot say in what manner you will have to apply it.  All I can promise is that it carries a death inside of it; a death intended for the thorns.”

I carefully slipped the pebble into my jeans pocket and as I did, I palmed the other object in there and covertly drew it out.  I kept it concealed in my closed fist as I backed away from the dais to stand near Turtle.

“You told me that you knew something about my death,” I said.

“A body for the stone,” the creature replied.  “That was our bargain.”

“I want to know what you’ve seen!”

Its eyes shifted inside its pallid mass and the remaining stone teeth stretched into a leering grin.

“I wish for a body,” it said.  “This one you’ve brought me is a fine vessel for any of my people, but it is not fit for a king.  Bring me another, a body worthy of my stature, and I will tell you more.”

I understand this game.  It would ask for more and more, dangling its promise of answers in front of me like a lure each time.  It was a noose it wanted me to willingly place my neck through.  The bargain would ruin me.

Good thing I never intended to honor it in the first place.

“Fine,” I snapped.  “Turtle, let’s go.”

She certainly didn’t have to be told twice.  Her face softened with intense relief and she quickly turned and took a few steps towards the exit.  The black smoke was quick to roll out of the shadows, cutting off the path.  I wasn’t concerned.  Not yet.  I continued to face the gummy bear king on the dais.

“*We had a bargain*,” it hissed, the flesh rippling rapidly, stretching thin as it drew itself up in height.

“And I am a descendent of Mattias,” I replied, “and as treacherous as he was.”

“You have no fire,” it burbled.  “I would not have let you enter if you had brought some.”

That is how Mattias escaped, after he failed to kill the gummy bear king.  He threw his lantern to the floor and the hall - entirely made of wood - burned, and the black smoke fled from the flames.

“Yeah, well, technology has progressed a bit since Mattias’s time.”

I opened my palm to reveal what I’d retrieved from my pocket.

“This,” I said, flicking the cap off, “is a lighter.  And this-”

I raised the bottle I carried in my right.

“-is a molotov cocktail.”

I lit it and threw as the smoke billowed towards us.  The smoke stopped short, cascading into a wall of vapor at the edge of the light cast by the exploding flames behind us.  I pulled the bandana around my neck up and over my nose and mouth and Turtle did the same.  The fire was spreading quickly, climbing up the columns and across the walls.  We kept in the boundary between it and the darkness, staying just ahead of the advancing flames, but not so far that the gummy bears could reach us.  The hot air scorched my cheeks and it was hard to breathe, but I could see daylight up ahead.  The archway was almost within reach.

Their hall would survive.  It would restore itself, just as it had when Mattias set it alight in his time.  Perhaps it would be weakened in doing so.  If we were lucky, this would be its final collapse and I would succeed where Mattias had failed.

Better that these remnants perish.  A slow death is a cruel death and their death throes bring such suffering to those unfortunate enough to be caught up in them.

This was the comfort I offered to myself as the hall burned.

“Damn your family!” the gummy bear king howled from behind us.  “A curse upon you!  May your death catch you, may you greet it with regret!”

I do not fear its curse.  My family already carries one.  And what death hasn’t been met with regret?  We always yearn for a minute more, even as we resign ourselves to our passing.

We passed through the archway and were in the forest once more.  I pulled the bandana down and gratefully gulped at clean air, blinking tears out of my stinging eyes.  For a moment, I couldn’t see, blinded by the soot from the fire and the brilliant sunlight reflecting off the snow.  Then, my eyesight cleared, and I saw something rather unexpected.

Beau stood nearby, leaning on a tree with his arms crossed over his chest.

“Uh,” I said.  “Hi?”

He didn’t reply.  He just glowered at me.  And then I felt Turtle tugging the sleeve of my jacket, nervously calling my name, and I turned to see what she wanted.

She was pointing at the archway.  It hadn’t unraveled yet.  I could see the flames of the burning hall still.

And they were dwindling.  Rapidly.

“That’s odd,” I said absently.

The fire was splitting in two.  A tunnel appeared in the flames.  *Something* was smothering them, something immense enough to cut them in two, pushing them away and towards the walls of the hall.  Something immense, something that bubbled, something that had two stones for eyes that were fixed on the entrance where I stood watching in dawning realization that our escape had not gone precisely as planned.

The gummy bear king was coming.  A wall of roiling flesh, growing ever larger to encompass the entire hall was bearing down on us, intent on forcing its way through the gateway that *I* had opened and entering the campground.

I grabbed at the tree and pulled, trying to see if I could separate the branches that comprised the archway.  Nothing.  The flames were flickering away, plunging the hall into darkness once more.  In desperation, I whirled on Beau.

“Do something!” I yelled at him.

“This was *your* idea,” he replied calmly.

Running wasn’t enough.  The gummy bears aren’t *that* dangerous when they’re merely stealing whatever bodies they could find.  But if that *thing* escaped, exactly as it was?  I couldn’t have that.  I couldn’t let it into my campground.  Frantically, I looked around for something that could be used to break apart the trees and destroy the gateway.

Turtle was quicker on the uptake than I was.  I heard an engine rev and then Turtle yelled at me to get out of the way.  I stumbled to the side just as Turtle hurtled past on my four-wheeler and rammed one of the trees.

The tree jolted and the branches creaked, tearing away from each other under the strain as the four-wheeler fishtailed in the doorway.  Past Turtle’s head I could see the incoming wall of flesh, rolling and bubbling as it cascaded down the long hall.  We didn’t have enough time.  The four-wheeler wasn’t powerful enough to bring down the tree.

I grabbed Turtle’s arm and pulled her off the seat.  She stumbled and I continued to drag her through the snow, away from the archway and towards where Beau stood watching.  If we were going to get consumed, then by god, he was coming with me.

The gummy bear king surged out through the gateway like toothpaste from a tube.  It enveloped the four wheeler, which tumbled sideways into the creature’s mass, wheels still spinning.  It sprayed jellied flesh, shredding the face of the gummy bear king.  The creature retreated from the onslaught and the trees, strained by the passage of the avalanche of flesh, finally loosened their grip on each other.  They sprang upright, their branches releasing.

The gateway snapped shut.  And the gummy bear king went with it, its bulk dragged backwards with a sickening slorp.

It dragged the four-wheeler along with it.

I admit that is what finally broke me, watching my vehicle carried away on a tide of translucent flesh.  I kicked at the snow.  I yelled.  I didn’t have the presence of mind to even form coherent sentences so I just wound up screaming “fuck” a lot at the top of my lungs.  And when I had exhausted my rage, I stood there with my chest heaving, exhausted.

So that’s another four-wheeler gone.  It won’t be replaced.  That was my personal one and it was a donation, since I’ve already emptied my vehicle budget.  I guess I’ll just be walking everywhere because I’m not about to risk the staff four-wheelers or golf carts.

Though I swear, if I have to deal with a gummified four-wheeler this summer I’m gonna be really angry.

“Sorry about that,” Turtle said nervously.  “I, uh, can’t afford to replace that for you.”

“It’s fine,” I sighed.  “You did the right thing.  And that was some good acting in there. Convinced me that you were terrified for your life.”

“I’ll be honest: that wasn’t acting,” she admitted.  “It occurred to me that this was precisely how you would lure someone in as an actual sacrifice.  I mean, I wouldn’t be the first employee you killed.”

Ooof.

I didn’t really know how to reply to that so I turned my attention to Beau instead.  He didn’t say anything.  Just held out his cup and after a moment, I realized what he was expecting.  Not blood freely given, the cup was nearly full.

He wanted the pebble.

I took it from my pocket and held it up.  Just an ordinary gray rock.  I dropped it into the skull.  The liquid inside began to boil and thick steam rose from the surface.

“Breathe it in,” he instructed.

I’ll be honest - I didn’t expect it to be pleasant.  His whole deal is either involuntary fasting or prolonged vomiting, after all.  But it was worse than I expected.  My whole body cramped up and I collapsed into the snow, curled into a fetal ball and every time I exhaled I brought up thick clumps that looked like bloody seaweed.  Turtle had to use my radio to call for Bryan to bring one of the staff vehicles around and help transport me back to my house.  And Beau just wandered off, taking the cup and the pebble with him.

I spent the next couple hours on the floor of my bathroom coughing up sludge.  Turtle came in to check on me a couple times I think and eventually I wore myself out and fell asleep.  I woke up still on the bathroom floor, but she’d cleaned up the blood and put a pillow under my head and covered me with a blanket.

I couldn’t convince her to come back to the campground this summer.  The bakery/bookstore gig is conveniently close to home.  She left this morning.  Tomorrow I’ll go searching for Beau and find out what he’s done with that pebble.  I can only hope that he’s already taken it upon himself to deal with the thorns… and that I’ll get the pebble back before the campground opens again.

I’m not sure I want to find out what’ll happen if he starts offering people drinks with it still in his cup.

I’m a campground manager.  I do what I must to keep myself alive.  Humans are weak, slow, and woefully unequipped to survive the things that lurk in the dark parts of the forest.  All we have are our wits and our lies.  As a society, we abhor deceit, because we know it to be a weapon.  Yet against these inhuman things we must seize every weapon we can, if we are to survive them.

I tell my campers to follow the rules because that will keep them safe.  Yet this thing I am caught up in is more than a fight for survival.  It is a fight for my land, a fight to determine who will control the future of this campground and have sway over all the land that surrounds it and perhaps even further.  There is no rule I will not break.  There is no weapon I will not use.

I broke a promise and burned the hall of the gummy bears.  I would do it again and again, every time, if that is what it took to save my land. [\[x\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/goatvalleycampgrounds)

So, since I published part two it has been quite an interesting experience, that same day I published part 1 it woke me up and answered some of my questions. I asked if it was a girl and it whispered something similar to "no" so I asked if it was a boy he didn't answered but didn't do anything harmful so I'll just refer at it as a "him". 

I named him Umbra since he's always behind me like a shadow and Umbra means shadow in Latin so anyway he has been following me to anywhere I go more often, I can feel his presence while in class or eating at a restaurant. He's been acting a lil bit weird though. . . sometimes I feel like if he was hugging me. . . I'm not used to that type of stuff so maybe that's why I call it weird

I tried to follow some of your advice and it kinda worked he doesn't hurt me anymore, at least not when talking about him but he does hurt me when doing other stuff like talking to friends or stuff like that, a few weeks ago a friend called me saying that he was in love of me, I think Umbra didn't like that. . .that night Umbra woke me up. . .he didn't talk. . . he just stared at me, he looked angry, the next day I had scars of bites around my arm it didn't hurt though.

You might think something like "dude exorcize him already" but I don't really think it will work at least not for long also he has he's kind side, he made money appear in my jacket and backpack so as stuff I lost like my necklace and pen, they just suddenly appeared in the floor, I usually get bullied in school but since I met Umbra something changed, I made friends, became more social, my grades started to raise and my family doesn't call me a weirdo anymore.

I just don't know what happened, since Umbra appeared in my life it became kinda better, actually when I first met him I was scared and couldn't sleep but after a few months of living with him I started to get used to it I can sleep again and I don't fear him anymore actually I see him like some sort of friend,
I have mental issues I used to go to the psychiatrist it worked for a while, then it got worse specially because nobody actually listened or cared about me and my problems.

Umbra did, he listened to me, he tried to help that's how we became closer I remember one night, last week he woke me up again, he said he was sorry for hurting me when we first met, he sat in my bed and hugged me, "I'm sorry, I didn't really wanted to hurt you" he said before I fell asleep again, that day he stayed home in the closet I tried knocking on the door (sometimes he answers knocking back) but no noice could be heard, he was gone till next day he was back but acted like nothing happened.

He just said he had a few problems bit didn't told me what type of problems, anyway I tried talking about this with a friend of trust he only told me that Umbra was just acting like he cared about but he had bad intentions, I don't know what to believe.

Also since I met him I stopped dreaming, well kind of, I do dream but I don't think I can actually call it a dream specially when it became real two weeks after  

Here's what I dreamed:
A scream, someone dropped in the gras, blood in the grass, and a twisted wrist with a bleeding cut, two weeks after we had an accident at the school yard it was about a friend of mine, specifically the one who said Umbra had bad intentions with me, my friend was playing football when he slipped and somehow managed to cut his hand and twist his wrist, I was watching the game while it happened and suddenly Umbra's voice sounded in my left ear "Ouch that's gotta hurt" he said before disappearing with a smile and an evil laugh

It also happened with the birth of my cousin which was born last week. I don't know I mean first I was depressed and anxious I mean I'm still a little anxious but not so much and then I suddenly have an spiritual friend and I dream with the future. You know while I'm writing this the door of my closet is creaking though it ain't getting opened and the sound of steps are being heard from it.

It's Umbra who's approaching me but stays a few meters away, he stares at me and says "you were supposed to be asleep" it's already a bit late but I'm not sleepy and usually he gets up at this hours to watch me sleep, why? I don't know, I was planning to ask him but I don't think I can do anything to change that.

He approaches me and hugs me, I can't see him because it's dark but I feel his arms grabbing my hips "if you can't sleep just tell me I could help you with it" he whispers into my ear I want to turn and give the hug back but something keeps me from doing it and makes me to keep writing, why's he doing this? I don't feel neither good or bad it's a little comfy actually and soft, I blink and have a small vision.

It is some sort of an altar, to the left there's a book with words in Latin and japanese and to the right a Kitsune mask, in front of me there's the image of a fox it's a red fox and in the middle there's a red flower, the table is covered by a blanket that has a flower pattern, I open up my eyes and look at my surroundings, I'm in my bed and Umbra was sitting next to me, he smiles at me and before I fell back asleep I publish this.

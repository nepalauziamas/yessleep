Hey, all...

A lot happened, so this one is a bit long. Sorry. I've divided it into three parts, Yesterday Morning Yesterday Evening, and This Morning.

Also, if you haven't read the [first part](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/ybx6tl/a_coffin_has_appeared_in_the_front_yard_of_every/), you probably should.

 

Yesterday morning:

I’m typing this up during my lunch break. Quickly, here’s what happened last night. I couldn’t sleep, so I went to look out the front window again. Saw my neighbor across the street come out of the house in a daze and get into the coffin. I passed out. I woke up in my bed and when I checked again, the coffin across the street was gone.

I hurried to the bedroom and shook Carrie awake. I watched her eyes go wide as I described Sandy getting into the coffin.

“That can’t be real.”

“I know. And now their coffin is gone. What do we do?”

“We need to check on her.” I was already going to do that, right? My brain is not working.

We pulled on our clothes, went out and started across the street. Carrie abruptly halted in the middle and put her arm across my chest to block me. She pointed to a house down our side of the the street to the left and one across and to the right. Their lawns were also coffin free.

“... Everyone had one, right?”, she asked.

“Yeah. I think so...” 

We continued to the door. I looked down to make sure I wasn’t stepping on any of Sandy’s flowers, mums now since it’s Fall. I was confused to see that the garden was mostly dead. There were some empty plastic pots scattered around. Not nice ones, but the plain black container that plants from the store come in. It looked like they’d been sitting there for months. What happened? This was a nicely maintained flower garden yesterday, wasn’t it?

Carrie was looking at it, too. “It wasn’t like that yesterday, right?”

I looked at her and shook my head. She moved to the front door as I stared at the garden.

Carrie’s sharp rapping on the door shook me out of my reverie. She waited a few moments and knocked again. She turned to me and shrugged, a thin worry line creasing her brow. I cupped my hands around my eyes and looked into their window. I noticed right away the the foyer was a mess of boxes, tools, and even some car parts. Like I said, I didn’t know her well at all, but it seemed weird that the inside of her house seemed like such a dump.

"I'm going to go around the back," I told her.

It was uncomfortable enough just walking up to a neighbor's house and knocking. Dropping by is a thing that seems to be going by the social wayside. Opening their side gate and entering the back yard felt straight-up wrong, like I was trespassing. I guess that's literally true.

I had never seen them before, but the gardens in the back were also mostly dead or overgrown. There were tools and gardening implements laying about the yard, as well as a long-unused and dilapidated dog house. Attached to the doghouse was a frayed, dirty rope and on the other end of the rope was a torn collar that may have once been red, but was now tattered and rusty brown. I noticed a name tag on the collar, but couldn't bring myself to read it.

Leaving that, I navigated the patchy grass to look into the sliding glass door on the porch. Through a gap created by a single missing panel of their vertical blinds, I saw that their living was was completely coated in what looked like unwashed laundry. Jeans, socks, tightie-whities, and various tees and flannels. All looked like men's clothes. My imagination must have run away with me, because one of the piles looked like there was someone under it. I took an involuntary step back as my breath caught in my throat. No, just a normal pile of clothes.

More than freaked out, I hurried back around to the front, making sure to close the gate, and told Carrie what I saw. She said nothing but her eyes betrayed her fear.

With no answer at the door, we started back home and saw the next-door neighbor staring at their coffin. *Greg,*  I thought. *His name is Greg.* He noticed us looking and called to us, "What kind of sick fuck would do this to us! The last thing Rebecca needs is to see this in our yard. She just went into remission!"

"I'm sorry, man" I replied. "We are shaken, too, but I can't imagine what this is doing to her. Is she doing alright?"

Weirdly, he looked at our yard and seemed shocked to see a coffin there. He took a long look up and down the street as if looking at it for the first time. "Why don't they have one?", he asked, pointing across the road. "Or them? Or them?"

He pointed at each house that no longer had a coffin. I explained that each did have one last night, but they disappeared overnight.

His face went from anger to confusion. "Oh. Oh, yeah, they did, right?" He seemed to be genuinely asking us.

"Yeah," said Carrie, giving me a pointed look.

I started to ask him if he had spoken to any of the other neighbors, but I could tell from his far-away expression that he was miles away. We may as well haven't even talked to him in the first place. He stared back down at the coffin, slowly shaking his head and rubbing the back of his neck over and over.

Carrie pulled on my hand and led past the coffin and to our front door.

Back at home, Carrie and I talked about what to do. She wanted to call the police to do a wellness check, so I picked up my phone and dialed. They must have been getting a lot of calls because the line went right to voicemail. I left the reason for the call and my contact details. Carrie noticed my scowl as I hung up and sighed.

We discussed whether we should call 911, but decided not to since we didn’t know if there was actually an emergency to respond to. I did, however, call my ex-wife and left a message asking her not to send the kids over today. Better safe than sorry. Having nothing better to do, we logged into work.

Shit, lunch is over and I haven't eaten. I guess I had more to tell you than I thought.

It’s now evening and I didn’t get a chance to post the above update. That works, because I have more to add.

Yesterday evening:

The husband across the street usually gets home at 7pm on the dot. Today was no different. When I saw his truck pull up, I went out and met him in his driveway.I probably should have asked Carrie his name before I went.

He saw me approaching and scratched at his grey and white beard. He looked like he had aged a decade in one night, and he didn’t have many decades left in the first place. “Hey, man. I was talking to Greg over there a little earlier. What do you think of all this?” I waved my hand up and down the street.

“It’s some freaky shit, yeah... You know at first, I thought that it was the new thing everyone wanted for Halloween. Like those goddamned giant skeletons last year. Friggin’ waste of money. But a couple folk down the road said they didn’t buy ‘em. Just there, like they always had been. Not sure why I’m one of the ones didn’t get one.”

“But, you had one last night.” I said, confused.

At this point, I noticed Carrie was watching from the front door.

“Nope. No, didn’t have one last night.” He shot me a bit of side-eye.

“Oh”, I said “uhh, my mistake.” I paused for a moment. “Does Sandy have any thoughts?”

He was getting impatient. “Is that the lady two doors down? How the hell should I know what she thinks?”

Dread. I took a longer pause than he had patience for. “No, Dan...”

“Dave.” He grimaced at me. 

“No, Dave. Your wife. Sandy.”

His eyes narrowed and he looked me up and down. “What in the fuck is wrong with you, Guy Whose Name I Don’t Fuckin’ Know? You move here years ago, don’t talk to no-one, then don’t even notice I’n not goddamn married? Tell me something, jackass. You ever seen a woman around my house?”

*I’ll be damned if I’m gonna say yes right now,*  I thought.

“No! No, of course not. I apologize, Dave, I must have confused you with someone else. I’ll, uh, just go inside and let you be.”

“Yeah,” he snarled, “You have a good one.” Then, under his breath, “Idiot.”

I must have looked completely abashed when I went back inside, because despite everything, Carrie raised her eyebrows at me with a small smirk. 

“So, it went well?”, she teased.

“All right.”

“Was he happy to finally talk to you? Heh!” 

“*All riiight!”* She got me smiling, too. God, I love her!

I told her everything that he said, making sure to remember every detail of him apparently not ever having a wife.

“Seriously, what the fuck. Did you tell him what you saw last night?”

“No, which is probably how I made it back here with an unbroken jaw. If you want to go over there and tell him how his wife that he never had got into a coffin that was never on his lawn and disappeared, then go for it. In fact, you should. I’m sure he’d be delighted to speak with you.”

“Hey!” she replied with epic sarcasm, “How about you go fuck yourself, instead?”

Fair enough. I actually laughed.

One thing we’ve always been good at is one being able to carry the other when things got tough. And, to keep each other in good spirits when things got *really* tough.

We decided at dinner that we were going to stay up and watch the houses on our street. We want to see if we can catch anyone else getting into the coffins, and how they were taken away. I made coffee, and she boiled a pot for tea, then we sat down to watch some TV to distract us while we waited.

She leaned her head against my chest and I put my arm around her. My next thought came unbidden and it curdled the blood in my veins.

*I’m going to miss her.*

This morning:

This has gone beyond weird and frightening to downright terrifying. We are getting the fuck out of here. Susan is gone along with more of our neighbors, and we’ve seen the... things that are taking the full coffins. Carrie is packing for us while I write this update.

We waited up last night as planned. We got out a couple of chairs and even brought our little iron fire pit from the backyard to keep us warm. This is the same setup we use for Halloween night to give out candy. 

We decided to walk around the block as it drew towards midnight, and we noticed that there were other watchers. Some sat inside by their windows with their lights off, some on their front porches, some in the driveway like us. We even saw one old fake wood-paneled station wagon driving a slow circuit around the block. It looked like about 1 out of every 5 houses no longer had a coffin.

That only took about 15 minutes, so we sat by the fire, drank our caffeine and waited. 

Have any of you done any camping? Have you noticed how you can get to staring into the campfire and just lose time? My dad used to call that “dreaming the fire”. I was so deep into the dreaming, that I almost didn’t even notice the sound of Susan and Greg’s door unlatching.

Carrie gave my shoulder a hard shake, bringing me back. She pointed and I saw Susan walking slowly and stiffly towards their coffin. For a moment, all I could do was stare, too frightened to get up.

“SUSAN!” Carrie’s scream jolted me out of my chair. She was already halfway into their yard before I was able to catch up. We got about 5 feet away from the coffin and all energy was sapped out of my body. I felt too weak to anything more than stand. I heard a small whimper come from Carries throat. Or, it may have been mine.

I’ve passed out before, and this felt like the first few moments after regaining consciousness. A light sweat covered by body in a cold sheen, and my muscles all refused to do anything more than twitch. Somehow, I remained standing. I couldn’t look away from Susan’s slow march to the coffin.

I heard Carrie try to yell for Greg, but it came out as a weak moan, like when someone is calling out in their sleep during a nightmare. I willed my eyes to roll towards the house and in the bay window, I saw the pale form of Greg, standing and watching his wife. I could see the orange light from our campfire flickering in the trails left by tears streaming down his blank face.

Susan was at the coffin. She bent down and lifted the lid with ease. *It unlocked for her when she was ready* I thought, remembering a comment one of you left. Inside was a simple, white silk lining with a matching pillow. 

Susan got in, lied down, closed the lid, and that was it. I felt some strength radiating back into my muscles. As did Carrie, because once again, she started moving first. She grabbed the lid of the coffin, sobbing as she tried to lift it. A split second later, I was with her, pulling with all remaining strength against the lid. It held fast.

We stopped at the same time. I looked again at Greg and saw him turn and walk away from the window, into the darkness of his living room.

“No. Fuck this!”, I said as I turned to futilely pull at the lid again. I felt a small pop in my lower back and heard a crazed voice in my head say, *I’m gonna feel that tomorrow! Ha!*

Through my frantic pulling, I felt Carrie place a shaking hand on my arm.

“Joe.” I stopped and looked at her. She was staring at the road with wild, panicked eyes. Parked on the road was a shiny hearse, so black that the light from the campfire and the stars just fell into it, trapped for eternity. The modern angles on it were sharp and mean, created to perfectly communicate that you have forever lost someone you loved.

Standing in a line behind the uberhearse and facing us were four identical figures. They were tall, towering over the top of the black machine. Their gaunt faces were turned toward us and each showed a sneer of superiority slashed across their thin, pale lips. Held under their left arms, each held a black silk top hat, and in their right, an ebony cane topped with a simple, silver globe, the only hint of color on their persons.

Each moved toward the coffin and placed their cane vertically on the ground, where it balanced perfectly still. On them, they hung their hats and the canes still did not waver. They formed a lined path from the coffin to the rear of the uberhearse. They lined up on either side of the coffin and lifted it to their shoulders, showing no sign of strain. They walked in perfect sync to the uberhearse, and the rear door opened to accept its prize. 

Neither Carrie nor I dared to move or make a sound. The ritual that we were watching was something old and unholy.

The coffin was in, and the door closed with a satisfied *chunk*. Then, the Pallbearers were circling us. Their manner was one of observation, like we were something tiny and meaningless. Maybe even amusing. I’d never felt fear like this before. I knew no amount of running or fighting would ever overcome this absolute finality. That death was all that awaited and it would be an eternity of horror.

Two of the Pallbearers swiveled aside, and gracefully bade us to our house with outstretched arms. We walked together, and hen we passed them, all faded to black.

We woke up this morning together in our bed. Carrie and I looked at each other and there was nothing to say. Later, we talked about leaving. We somehow know that we can’t, but we’re going to try.

We’ve tried to call the police, and I tried my ex-wife. Carried tried her parents. All went right to voicemail, and we realized that we’ve gotten no calls, no voicemails or texts. No communication since this thing started.

We are out today. I’ll update as soon as I can.

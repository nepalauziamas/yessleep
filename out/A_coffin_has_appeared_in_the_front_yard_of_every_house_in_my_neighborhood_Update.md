 Hey, all...

A lot happened, so this one is a bit long. Sorry. I've divided it into two parts, This Morning and This Evening.

Also, if you haven't read the [first part](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/ybx6tl/a_coffin_has_appeared_in_the_front_yard_of_every/), you probably should.  


This morning:

I’m typing this up during my lunch break. Quickly, here’s what happened last night. I couldn’t sleep, so I went to look out the front window again. Saw my neighbor across the street come out of the house in a daze and get into the coffin. I passed out. I woke up in my bed and when I checked again, the coffin across the street was gone.

I hurried to the bedroom and shook Carrie awake. I watched her eyes go wide as I described Sandy getting into the coffin.

“That can’t be real.”

“I know. And now their coffin is gone. What do we do?”

“We need to check on her.” I was already going to do that, right? My brain is not working.

We pulled on our clothes, went out and started across the street. Carrie abruptly halted in the middle and put her arm across my chest to block me. She pointed to a house down our side of the the street to the left and one across and to the right. Their lawns were also coffin free.

“... Everyone had one, right?”, she asked.

“Yeah. I think so...” 

We continued to the door. I looked down to make sure I wasn’t stepping on any of Sandy’s flowers, mums now since it’s Fall. I was confused to see that the garden was mostly dead. There were some empty plastic pots scattered around. Not nice ones, but the plain black container that plants from the store come in. It looked like they’d been sitting there for months. What happened? This was a nicely maintained flower garden yesterday, wasn’t it?

Carrie was looking at it, too. “It wasn’t like that yesterday, right?”

I looked at her and shook my head. She moved to the front door as I stared at the garden.

Carrie’s sharp rapping on the door shook me out of my reverie. She waited a few moments and knocked again. She turned to me and shrugged, a thin worry line creasing her brow. I cupped my hands around my eyes and looked into their window. I noticed right away the the foyer was a mess of boxes, tools, and even some car parts. Like I said, I didn’t know her well at all, but it seemed weird that the inside of her house seemed like such a dump.

"I'm going to go around the back," I told her.

It was uncomfortable enough just walking up to a neighbor's house and knocking. Dropping by is a thing that seems to be going by the social wayside. Opening their side gate and entering the back yard felt straight-up wrong, like I was trespassing. I guess that's literally true.

I had never seen them before, but the gardens in the back were also mostly dead or overgrown. There were tools and gardening implements laying about the yard, as well as a long-unused and dilapidated dog house. Attached to the doghouse was a frayed, dirty rope and on the other end of the rope was a torn collar that may have once been red, but was now tattered and rusty brown. I noticed a name tag on the collar, but couldn't bring myself to read it.

Leaving that, I navigated the patchy grass to look into the sliding glass door on the porch. Through a gap created by a single missing panel of their vertical blinds, I saw that their living was was completely coated in what looked like unwashed laundry. Jeans, socks, tightie-whities, and various tees and flannels. All looked like men's clothes. My imagination must have run away with me, because one of the piles looked like there was someone under it. I took an involuntary step back as my breath caught in my throat. No, just a normal pile of clothes.

More than freaked out, I hurried back around to the front, making sure to close the gate, and told Carrie what I saw. She said nothing but her eyes betrayed her fear.

With no answer at the door, we started back home and saw the next-door neighbor staring at their coffin. *Greg,*  I thought. *His name is Greg.* He noticed us looking and called to us, "What kind of sick fuck would do this to us! The last thing Rebecca needs is to see this in our yard. She just went into remission!"

"I'm sorry, man" I replied. "We are shaken, too, but I can't imagine what this is doing to her. Is she doing alright?"

Weirdly, he looked at our yard and seemed shocked to see a coffin there. He took a long look up and down the street as if looking at it for the first time. "Why don't they have one?", he asked, pointing across the road. "Or them? Or them?"

He pointed at each house that no longer had a coffin. I explained that each did have one last night, but they disappeared overnight.

His face went from anger to confusion. "Oh. Oh, yeah, they did, right?" He seemed to be genuinely asking us.

"Yeah," said Carrie, giving me a pointed look.

I started to ask him if he had spoken to any of the other neighbors, but I could tell from his far-away expression that he was miles away. We may as well haven't even talked to him in the first place. He stared back down at the coffin, slowly shaking his head and rubbing the back of his neck over and over.

Carrie pulled on my hand and led past the coffin and to our front door.

Back at home, Carrie and I talked about what to do. She wanted to call the police to do a wellness check, so I picked up my phone and dialed. They must have been getting a lot of calls because the line went right to voicemail. I left the reason for the call and my contact details. Carrie noticed my scowl as I hung up and sighed.

We discussed whether we should call 911, but decided not to since we didn’t know if there was actually an emergency to respond to. I did, however, call my ex-wife and left a message asking her not to send the kids over today. Better safe than sorry. Having nothing better to do, we logged into work.

Shit, lunch is over and I haven't eaten. I guess I had more to tell you than I thought.

It’s now evening and I didn’t get a chance to post the above update. That works, because I have more to add.

This evening:

The husband across the street usually gets home at 7pm on the dot. Today was no different. When I saw his truck pull up, I went out and met him in his driveway.I probably should have asked Carrie his name before I went.

He saw me approaching and scratched at his grey and white beard. He looked like he had aged a decade in one night, and he didn’t have many decades left in the first place. “Hey, man. I was talking to Greg over there a little earlier. What do you think of all this?” I waved my hand up and down the street.

“It’s some freaky shit, yeah... You know at first, I thought that it was the new thing everyone wanted for Halloween. Like those goddamned giant skeletons last year. Friggin’ waste of money. But a couple folk down the road said they didn’t buy ‘em. Just there, like they always had been. Not sure why I’m one of the ones didn’t get one.”

“But, you had one last night.” I said, confused.

At this point, I noticed Carrie was watching from the front door.

“Nope. No, didn’t have one last night.” He shot me a bit of side-eye.

“Oh”, I said “uhh, my mistake.” I paused for a moment. “Does Sandy have any thoughts?”

He was getting impatient. “Is that the lady two doors down? How the hell should I know what she thinks?”

Dread. I took a longer pause than he had patience for. “No, Dan...”

“Dave.” He grimaced at me. 

“No, Dave. Your wife. Sandy.”

His eyes narrowed and he looked me up and down. “What in the fuck is wrong with you, Guy Whose Name I Don’t Fuckin’ Know? You move here years ago, don’t talk to no-one, then don’t even notice I’n not goddamn married? Tell me something, jackass. You ever seen a woman around my house?”

*I’ll be damned if I’m gonna say yes right now,*  I thought.

“No! No, of course not. I apologize, Dave, I must have confused you with someone else. I’ll, uh, just go inside and let you be.”

“Yeah,” he snarled, “You have a good one.” Then, under his breath, “Idiot.”

I must have looked completely abashed when I went back inside, because despite everything, Carrie raised her eyebrows at me with a small smirk. 

“So, it went well?”, she teased.

“All right.”

“Was he happy to finally talk to you? Heh!” 

“*All riiight!”* She got me smiling, too. God, I love her!

I told her everything that he said, making sure to remember every detail of him apparently not ever having a wife.

“Seriously, what the fuck. Did you tell him what you saw last night?”

“No, which is probably how I made it back here with an unbroken jaw. If you want to go over there and tell him how his wife that he never had got into a coffin that was never on his lawn and disappeared, then go for it. In fact, you should. I’m sure he’d be delighted to speak with you.”

“Hey!” she replied with epic sarcasm, “How about you go fuck yourself, instead?”

Fair enough. I actually laughed.

One thing we’ve always been good at is one being able to carry the other when things got tough. And, to keep each other in good spirits when things got *really* tough.

We decided at dinner that we were going to stay up and watch the houses on our street. We want to see if we can catch anyone else getting into the coffins, and how they were taken away. I made coffee, and she boiled a pot for tea, then we sat down to watch some TV to distract us while we waited.

She leaned her head against my chest and I put my arm around her. My next thought came unbidden and it curdled the blood in my veins.

*I’m going to miss her.*

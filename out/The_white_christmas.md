This has happened when I was only a child. I was like 12. I was hyped for Christmas. Every kid is waiting Christmas. It has happened on the 24th of December. One day before Christmas. I stayed up late that night with hopes of seeing Santa. I wish I didn't. It was around midnight when I heard a slight sound of  bells. I looked out my window. It was pitch black so I couldn't see anything. But the sound of bells got louder. From this point I could make out the figure of a slay. The one you see in fairy tael books. But this was different, it was black and had a red substance that looked like blood dripping from it. It landed on the back of my garden. My parents were asleep in their room. An creature like thing got out of the slay. It's body was covered with fur and had that same red substance dripping from it's hands. When it got out of the slay it also dragged a blood red sack. It got closer to the house. I could see that it's fur was white as snow. It also had the same blood like substance splattered on it's body. It got closer and closer until it was at the door. It somehow unlocked the door. It was right outsider my room I hided inside a small place inside the wardrobe underneath some clothes. I could hear it stumble inside my room. I couldn't resist anymore I needed to scream but I couldn't. I was frozen in shock, I just simply couldn't  move.

 I could hear a slight creek as the door to my wardrobe opened. It looked around for seconds that felt an eternity to me and then he closed the door. It still looked around my room for I might say half a hour and then I heard like he left. I stayed there fore ten more minutes until I got out from the wardrobe. Everything was like when I saw it. The only thing that changed was the slay. It had just vanished. I never got hyped for Christmas again. My parents were questioning me but I didn't tell them what happened. I searched this up before writing this story. Apparently the thing that I saw is called a Krampus. They are creatures from German mythology that kidnap and torture bad children. I taught that year I did something bad because I am generally a nice guy. This was one of my luckiest day with dealing with creatures. I guess that you could say that this got me becoming a thrill seeker. I forgot to mention that this was my first interaction with the paranormal. Until then I was a very dreamy boy. I am saying that like I believed in the teeth fairy and Santa but from that night I stopped believing in those childish things. I can't believe that I was so foolish when I was young. I am one hundred precent sure that I didn't just imagined all of this. I am wondering if this had happened to other people...

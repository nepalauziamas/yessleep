Mommy always told me to never go in the basement. Being the curious 5 year old I am, this made me want to go down there more than ever. Sometimes I would here what sounded like a puppy crying coming from downstairs, I was becoming more and more interested by the day. Christmas is only in 4 days, could she have gotten me a dog as a present?

Mommy always kept the door locked and the key for it around her neck. The only time she ever took it off was when she showered or when she needed to unlock the door. It was the same routine everyday, she would unlock the door at 7AM and disappear down there for about 20 minutes. She would do the same thing at 7PM. Sometimes she would come back with a scratch or two on her arms. When I asked her about it she once again told me not to go down there and that the scratches were from a wild squirrel that lived down there. At this point I couldn’t wait anymore, I HAD to see this cute little squirrel. Maybe I could catch it and make mommy happy again, she hasn’t been the same since Daddy disappeared with my big brother. Plus now that Toby was gone, I had nothing to do during the day. I wasn’t even allowed to go to school anymore or look out the windows. 

I DID IT!

I finally worked up the courage to do it. I waited until Mommy was in the shower and took the key that she left on the bathroom sink. The bathroom was full of steam so I wasn’t worried about her seeing me through the curtain but I couldn’t stop my hands from shaking as I slipped the key around my neck. I was gonna catch that squirrel and make Mommy happy again. She always came back from the basement covered in stains and dirt but now she wouldn’t have to worry. 

My heart was racing, as I got closer to the door I could here whimpering. Was that the squirrel? Or did she really get me a puppy? A million thoughts were racing around my head when I heard the shower turn off. I rushed to fit the key into the hole, trying my best to keep quiet. Mommy would notice the key was gone as soon as she dried off.  After what felt like forever, I finally felt the key slide all the way in. I turned the knob and opened the door not knowing what to expect. It was dark and smelled strongly of metal and something else I couldn’t recognize but it made me gag . As I began my descent down the stairs I saw it. 

Just as soon as I realized what I was seeing Mommy started screaming at me for disobeying her and dragged me back up the steps, slamming the door behind her. I’d never seen Mommy get this mad before and I began crying. I just wanted to catch the squirrel for Mommy, I just wanted to make her happy again. She told me I could never go in the basement again and gave me a brownie to calm me down. It was such a good brownie and I didn’t want to make Mommy yell again so I decided not to ask her about the boy in the basement. I really wanted to ask her where his hands and feet were but I’ve learned not to be so curious anymore.

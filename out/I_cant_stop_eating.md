I can proudly say I am a successful youtuber with my boyfriend. I do extreme eating things for my videos. Before I did vegan videos and taught people how to eat vegan, but when I did these big meat videos my channel exploded. My boyfriend and I are gaining a little weight, but I can handle it. A lot of people, plus my boyfriend are saying I'm going way too far and I need to stop this. They don't understand, I need this for more money. My life has not been any better than this.

I keep on having fights with my boyfriend more and more often. He keeps saying we need to eat more healthily and that this is ruining us. I don't know how this is ruining us, but I cry a little more than usual and I'm hurting more and I keep having an angry outburst on camera, but I can handle it.

I'm over 500 pounds. I couldn't believe it. I don't know how this could happen, it must be too much water, i really can't be eating that much… can I? No, this is just a small water weight... yeah, that's it. The viewers need me and I will deal with it.

Today my boyfriend left me saying I ruined his life by making him eat nothing but junk and he used to have such an amazing body until I got into his life. I just don't understand how this could be ruining his life. We have everything we have… I don't need him. I don't need his help. I can do what I want and he can leave when he wants

It's been a few weeks and I feel a little lonely. I haven't gotten out of the house a lot because I need to post more and more of these videos and it's getting a little tiring to move. People keep saying they “care about me” when they want me to just go down hill. I'm definitely not falling for these trolls.

It's been a while, I lost track of the days . I'm finally over 700 pounds. I want to stop but I keep eating, but I can't because I'm getting more and more hungry and it feels like something is making me eat more and more like I haven't eaten at all and it's getting harder and harder to walk. I only order food now so I don't need to walk far. I'm still very lonely and I want my boyfriend back

I quit posting on youtube but I just can't stop eating, what is wrong with me. I want my old life back! I want to live with my boyfriend. I want to be healthy again, but my body isn't allowing it. I don't know what to do; I feel awful, like my stomach is ready to pop like a balloon, but I want to keep eating

I'm stuck on my couch, i cant reach my phone to call 911 I puke a lot but I always feel the need to eat more I feel like a turtle on its back and I cant move around, am I gonna die… alone i cant i don't want to, please I'm begging for someone to help I can't do anything please… help!

Eight days ago, my daughter Madison told me that she was afraid to sleep alone in her new bedroom. She claimed that there was a monster in the closet who watched her sleep. “It looks like a clown,” she whined. I showed her that the closet was empty, then unloaded on my husband. Six-year-olds should not be watching Stephen King movies, I scolded him, and warned that he can’t always be the “fun parent.” Phil sheepishly apologized.

Seven days ago, Madison disappeared from her bedroom overnight.

Six days ago, police found a clown suit in her closet. I was nearly apoplectic. I don’t know how I missed it before. After two hours of crying in Madison’s bedroom, Phil convinced me not to go back in there until Madison was found. We were fragile, we were brittle. He promised me that she would be home again. I had to believe that, because doubt would have ended me.

Five days ago, Phil disappeared from our bedroom overnight. 

Four days ago, police called me with news. They had found blood on the clown suit. They were running DNA tests just as fast as they could. With my entire world gone, I teetered on the edge of collapse. My only focus was on surviving the hour or minute in which I found myself. Sometimes I didn’t think I’d be able to accomplish even that much. 

Three days ago, police let me know that the blood on the clown suit belonged to Phil. They called me in for a four-hour interrogation. I remember very little of it, because my life had completely unraveled by that point. 

Two days ago, nineteen hours and thirteen minutes after I understood what had happened, Phil came forward to police. He told them that I had attacked him while wearing the clown suit, which is how his blood got there. He went on to say that I had silenced Madison’s cries as I was hurting her. On top of that, Phil told them that I was jealous of his status as the “fun parent,” and that Madison didn’t see me as fun because I was so violent. Every aspect of our dynamic fit perfectly into a lie that he had been honing for months, if not years. Nearly every one of my happy memories had been undone by this point. 

One day ago, Phil told police where to find Madison’s body. He claimed that I’d hidden her before threatening to kill him if he talked. In reality, he’d crammed Madison beneath her bed, behind a layer of stuffed animals, shortly after making me promise not to go back into her room, just before assuring me that she would be home again. 

Today, my public defender told me to plead guilty. “The truth doesn’t matter,” he said. “My only goal is to spare you from capital punishment.” After our meeting, I received a phone call from Phil. He didn’t say a word, he just laughed and laughed, that [god damn clown](https://www.facebook.com/P-F-McGrail-181784199029462/).

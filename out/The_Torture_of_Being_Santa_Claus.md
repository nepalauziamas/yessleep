 *\*sigh\**  


You'd think being Santa would be wonderful, wouldn't you? That's what I thought too, when I was younger. Back when I was a child. Filled with hope and dreams. It's a shame it all had to end.  


The idea that Santa Claus lives forever is a myth. Maybe he lives longer than others. I've lost track of my old age. At some point, you start living one moment at a time. The idea of an entire year is enough to kill you.  


Those lists that have become so famous? I was at the top of it. So was the Santa before me. You see, all previous Santa Claus's were at the top of the list. They were the nicest child in the world. And as a reward, they got the gift of magic when the current Santa died.  


But it comes with a price. You're given 24 hours to decide, and if you agree to accept the gift, you must leave your family forever. I was only 8 at the time. I was struggling to learn long division and had yet to master my cursive z's. The idea of leaving was really appealing at the time. Little did I know what my future had instore.  


This deranged elf-like creature came to my home in the middle of the night. I tried to scream, but I couldn't. He told me that I could leave my life behind and travel to the North Pole to be the new Santa. Truth be told, he didn't give me much of a choice. Had I declined, I would have been killed. He didn't tell me that, but I already knew. You can't let a child know how the system works and then release them into the wild.  


They erased my families' memory so they had no recollection of my existence. Do you have any idea how hard that was to watch? My baby sister, who was just three at the time, she grew up thinking she was an only child. For a while she had an imaginary friend with my name, but he eventually disappeared too. And my father? He left. Divorced my mom, claiming something didn't feel right anymore. I knew it was my fault and I watched it all happen. I watched my mom fall apart with no memories of her only son.  


Yes, that part is true. I really can watch every person in the world to see who has been naught and nice. But the thing is... you can't turn it off. Every time you close your eyes, you see another person. And yes... sometimes it's nice people you see. But more often than not, it's the naughty. The evil people.  


I don't just see kids. I see them all. I see the killers. I see them hiding the evidence, cleaning up the messes. I see the criminals. I watch them moments before they shoot up a bank. They're in my sleep. So many people dying, and why? What's the purpose? They're in my mind constantly. I can't erase it. They're always there, torturing others. I see the drug dealers, the child abuse, the escapees, even the mafia. No one is safe from Santa Claus.  


I couldn't take it anymore, you know? Could you? Could you just sit by and watch it all happen, never doing anything? Nonstop, for the rest of your life? I couldn't do it. I couldn't stand to have these images in my mind.  


It was a mistake, though. You can only report so many crimes without proof before they start asking questions. And the thing is? They're all in on it. The Easter Bunny's the worst. And when he got wind of it, when he found out that I ratted out his mafia bunnies, it all changed. He made sure everyone found out who was behind it all.  


Suddenly, every criminal in the world wanted to find me. You don't get it. Almost every night I wake up to the sound of snow crunching outside my window. I watch the men with guns approach. They're after me, I know it. They want me dead for the secrets I've exposed, but I can't let that happen. The idea of this happening to another child is too much for me to bare.  


I don't know how much longer I can survive up here. I suspect they've put a bounty on my head because the elves are acting suspicious. Maybe I'm just paranoid, but I know I can't hold out forever.  


For your sake, I just hope you're not the one at the top of the 'nice' list.

Here's what happened last time:

Now let's continue from where we left off. As I turned around a whole crowd of people, at least seven, were following me at a pace slower than a snail's. They were dressed in long black gowns and their whole bodies were covered in black, like a shadow, except for one part, their mouths. All their lips were in sync, moving at exactly the same pace, with the exact same movements. I couldn't even imagine how the fuck these people saw. But I didn't need to. I only needed to know that I needed to get the fuck out of there. As soon as I made eye contact with them, or rather just saw them, all their heads snapped up into the sky in less than a second. What on Earth they were looking I have no the slightest idea of, but I took that to my advantage. I dashed down the street as fast as I could and hastily unlocked the door. As soon as I was in, I yelled out,

"LUKAS! LUKAS! Where the fuck are you?!"

"Yes Jack?" said a soft voice.

"Why are you so...scared?"

"Oh, Lukas!" I replied, sobbing. He was only 7, he wouldn't understand this. So instead, I instantly thought of an excuse. "Do you want to go for some ice cream? Some chips? Maybe Macca's?". Macca's is what we call McDonald's in Australia by the way.

"Of course!" he replied. "I love Macca's!" I hugged him once more.

"Okay then, let's go out."

"Wait."

"Yeah, what's up Lukas?"

"I have a question. Actually, two questions.'

"Yeah, what?"

"Have you called Mom and Daddy to let them know? Did they let us? Why are you crying?"

"Lukas, that's three questions." I said with a chuckle.

"Anyways, yes I did, and they let us." That was an obvious lie, as there was no planned ice cream event, but he bought it.

"But why are you crying?"

As I looked out the window more shadow people, as I like to call them, were approaching our house.

"I'll explain to you on the train." I hastily replied as I grabbed our opal cards.

"Let's just get to the station quickly first, yeah?"

I then ran to the station at half the speed of the normal walk.

As I ran down to the platform, I heard the sounds of an incoming train.

"Thank fuck they arrived at this time."

As I ran to the train, words blurted out of the platform speaker.

"The train on platform 4 is terminating. Please do not board this train."

"Fuck!" I muttered under my breath.

And then I heard the best thing ever.

"The next train on platform 5 is arriving in one minute. The train goes to Emu Plains via Penrith and Parramatta on the T2 line. Thank God that was announced. I could just change trains to the city at Parramatta. As the train arrived, Lukas and I walked towards the door. That's when I looked across to the opposite platform. There were 2 officers patrolling the platform. They were walking up the stairs. Coincidentally, a much larger crowd of shadow people, about fifty, were also coming down the same stairs.

"Fuck yeah." I thought they were of course going to be arrested. As I prepared myself to watch the officers pull out their guns, I was astounded that they didn't even notice as the whole crowd walked through them like ghosts. As I got on the train, the last words I heard before the doors closed were "DO YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENS TO NAUGHTY LITTLE BROTHERS".

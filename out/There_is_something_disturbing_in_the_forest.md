My mom told me that she was going to be camping alone. And that of me and my friends. Wanted to join it just to ask. I said yes. I called all of my friends and told them to meet me and my mom in Hallerbos Forest at 3.pm. One of them said no
Me and some of my friends were camping.

My mom had told us to settle down. And that we were going to play hide and seek in the forest. When the sun had gone down. We had done our jobs. We were given flashlights. And we went long inside the forest. We had played three rounds of hide and seek. And then I saw something walk towards us. It wasn’t walking like an animal nor a human.

 I told my mom and she said that it was our eyes. And that we should just be playing hide n seek. Halfway I heard a scream everyone except me ran away. I was so scared that I froze. The thing started running towards me. The thing was a devil. The Devil smelled like rotten eggs. The devil was 2 meters away. When I started to run.  I was crying. I wanted to go back to mom and dad. I fall. My heart rate was at 210. 

The devil screamed so high that my ears stopped working. I ran to a local church. I opened the door. And ran to the bible and started reading. It didn’t work. I ran towards the emergency door. And opened it and started to run again. I called mom and said don’t drive, wait for me. I ran to the parking lot 

. And I came inside the car. Mom started speeding away while the devil was running after us. One of my friends was crying. The other was visibly shaking. On a roundabout. We saw someone that was sitting

. Mom stopped and started walking towards the body. It started running towards mom. Mom ran back to the car. And started the car and drove off. I was on my phone. 

On twitter WWIII was a trending hashtag. I thought that it was the USA vs Iran thing back in 2020. But this time it was different. Countries had declared war. China had declared war on Taiwan . North Korea has declared war on North Korea, USA has declared war on both North Korea and China. Russia had declared war on NATO countries and the USA. I told my mom that World War 3 had started. My mom looked confused. I said it again. But didn’t get any response. We dropped my friends at their house. And I went to my bed and slept.

When I woke up my leg was covered with bruises. And part of my leg was blue
 I ask my mom. Why didn't she say anything? My mom looked confused. I retold what happened yesterday. But she said that she was home the entire time. I called my friends. And told me that they were at home. And then it clicked. It was a dream about the future.

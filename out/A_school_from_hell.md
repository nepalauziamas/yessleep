If you don't know, I was born in a cursed town filled with monstrosities. (Check my post before this one). Anyways, in my hometown when you became 7 years old you were enrolled into school but, it wasn't like any other school, it was inhumane torture. As soon as you enter, there is 4 "guards" at the door and one of them will literally grab you and launch you into floor and will proceed to agressively search all of your body to see if you have any weapons while the other 3 "guards" are giving you death stares that pierce your soul. That's what my friends told me when I was readying myself to go to school.

Immediately after hearing that, I started laughing thinking they were trying to pull a prank at me since I didn't know about the horrors I was about to experience. While I was laughing, I noticed that my friends were staring at me like I was some sort of lunatic, I even could see pity in the eyes of one of them. And then I was told them "What's up?" with a little nervous laugh. They stared at me in silence and then we got out of the house we were in and began our journey.

The entire time they were so silent you could even hear a fly from 100 meters away, and I was super confused and scared at the same time. When we arrived, I was just about to laugh and tell them "Nice try but you can't scare me!" And just then the door opened and as you expect, there were four guards in there. One of them did the same thing my friends told me while we watched in horror. Then, it was my turn. I decided to just accept it instead of resisting the torture I was about to experience.

The guard grabbed me from the throat so hard I almost choked to death, and launched into the floor and I was in so much pain I thought my spine was broken. He then almost teared up my clothes while searching me, and the worst of it all is that time for me literally stopped. I got up and rested on a big rock while the guard was taking care of the last 2 of my friends. When we got up and entered, I was praying that torture I just went through will be last, but, I was wrong.

The hallways were empty of any life, and the only sound I heard was the sound of the disjointement of an arm of one of those extremely creepy dolls from nightmares sitting in a chair. After a few moments of walking, we arrived into a place where there were two ways, a way so dark it made hallucinate a little girl with big white eyes void of life, and a normal way compared to the other one. Weirdly, we chose to go the dark way and I still don't know what did I eat that day to make a choice like that. We walked and walked until one of my friends stopped us and there was a little girl with the exact description I told you.

I thought that we were dead, but, instead of tearing up our intestines after transforming into something horrible just like my brain told me, she just welcomed us and told us she is a sort of helper ghost that will guide us into our classroom. We were walking when suddenly, a boy completely littered with what seems his own blood was running towards us and screaming and I could see clearly everytime he screamed that his tongue was cut off.

He ran to us and was pleading us to help him escape, and before I could even stutter a word, a "human" that seemed like a "teacher" was running towards us holding a machete and I almost fainted from fear. We got out of his way and luckily he wasn't (yet) coming for us, but for that poor child who then got jumped and was given what seemed to me an amnesiac. As soon as I saw that, my brain was going wild about what this nightmare of a school was going to be like. My friends and I were sprinting until we arrived in a hallway with a door guarded by an armed man. He stopped us and instructed us to enter the door, and that's when I remembered, "Where the hell did that little girl we just met go?" I whispered that to my friends while entering and I was beginning to feel something breathing down my shoulder, and when I turned to see what was there, it was that teacher who thankfully did not hear us otherwise we would be dead.

With a demonic grin, she told us "Please enter" in what seemed like an innocent woman's voice but mashed up with a demonic voice, and I thought she was trying to hide something from us when I heard that. We sat in the chairs just like any other students but, we were the only ones in the classroom and I was questioning where did the others go. I was also wondering what will we learn, how are we going to learn it etc. Then she said to us "Today, you will be learning how to properly respect people", it seemed normal to me because in my hometown no one leaves nor enters (Read my first post) and we did our lesson normally.

When we finished, the guard opened the door and said "Time for daily checks" and one of my friends told me that we will do two tests everyday that will determine how much disciplined we are and how respectuful etc. The teacher took us to a room filled with students and we were in the first round, and then a man wearing a mask "welcomed" us and told us that we will take an easy and simple test. The students were marked by numbers and were called by their numbers so "1,2,3..." and since we were in the first round, we were one of the first ones to be called. But, I didn't know my number and was kind of scared but luckily one of my friends pointed to the back of my chair, and there was the number 5.

All four of us were called along with the little girl from earlier. It was a test where you get asked questions while being stared down by a man that knows if you are lying or not. Luckily, we didn't get any questions wrong and were told to go back to our classes this time was with us the little girl I told you. The same thing happened; Enter, be quiet the entire time, learn, do the test) And the day was over when we finished the test and went back to our homes except for the little girl who disappeared again.

I told all of this to my parents and they told me that they also went to that school and were treated like that. The second day, this time the guard did not torture us since we were now trusted. We found the same little girl again and told us that this day is probably going to be our last if we don't be cautious. I asked her "Did something happen?" and she said "You're the only ones who ever trusted me and didn't get scared of me, so I thought I should warn you about this school and pardon me for my wording."

She sounded so sweet I felt pity for her, so we followed her into a door then she told us "Be quiet, or else they'll catch you." she unlocked the door and we went in and we saw something horrible. There was a sort of big glass window where you could see the teachers and some armed men around them, and since they didn't notice us even if we are clearly there, I assumed that we can see through the glass but they can't.

There was a little girl who was strapped into a chair that seemed like an electric chair, and there was a teacher that put a rusty nail up her nose while the other teachers were only saying "Bad girl, bad girl, bad girl..." and I imagined myself in that poor litlle girl's mind being filled with "Bad girl" I wanted to help her but I couldn't. Then the teacher grabbed a hammer and didn't only hit the rusty nail but also her nose and broke it but when that nail went up to her brain, I saw that her right eye got gouged out by the rusty nail.

My friends and I were all in shock. Suddenly, we heard footsteps coming towards us, likely a teacher's footsteps who is searching for us since we were late for class. The little girl told us "Get out now and forget about me, and don't worry, justice shall be served." I had no choice but to run. I tried to secretly look where the teacher is and how close he is, when I saw him looking right at me and all of us began to sprint towards the door, but now, there wasn't only the teacher chasing us, but a group of teachers screaming at us and armed guards shooting at us.

We barely dodged the bullets, and we were very lucky because the bullets that were intented for us actually killed the four guards stationed at the front door, and we escaped from that living hell. And the little girl's words were true, because the next day, all the people of the town sort of rebelled against the school and the school got burned down to ashes with the teachers there.

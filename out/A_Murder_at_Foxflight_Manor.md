You know those Murder Mystery dinner parties that were a hit years ago? Folks would dress up in period clothing, get drunk, and basically LARP a game of *Clue*. That was all a little before my time but I have a strong appreciation for the past. So imagine my surprise when I was rummaging around a local thrift store and I found a journal from a man who claimed that a real murder happened at one of those parties.

I’m still trying to clean up the journal; it’s a mess and there are a lot of…*interesting* stains, especially in the back. The first half is cleaner so I’m going to post it now to see if anybody has heard of a place called, “Foxflight Manor.”

*May 11th, 1995, Foxflight Manor*

The scream snapped me awake. I wasn’t sleeping, exactly but I wasn’t fully present, either. There was more yelling, the sounds of footsteps pounding down the hall, and an echo of the first scream that clawed its way into my ear, thrashing like a trapped mouse. I looked for an exit. I was in the library, alone, next to a cheerful fire inside a stone mantel. The nearest door was directly across the room. I couldn’t remember if that was the exit to the hall or if it led deeper into a study but I decided to chance it.

I collided with something the moment I stepped into the hallway. We both went down in a tangle of limbs and curses. The man I’d knocked over got up first and extended his hand.

“Are you okay, Bruce?” he asked.

For a moment, my mind was blank. I didn’t recognize the man or even my name. Then things clicked into place and I took the offered hand.

“Yeah, I’m fine. Sorry about that.”

The man nodded. He was maybe fifty or sixty years old and dressed in a gray suit. His hair was salt-and-pepper and there were creases at his eyes that spoke to me of decades spent squinting in the sun. I knew his name–Peter–and that he was here for the same reason I was…only, I couldn’t recall the event. It floated at the edge of my memory, a little moth attracted to fire but unwilling to come too close.

Another scream came crashing down the hall. Peter and I both winced.

“Guess we should see if we can help?” he suggested.

“Yeah.”

We both passed through the hallway at a light jog. Even distracted by the screams, I couldn’t help but take in how stunning the surroundings were. The hall was brightly lit with oil lamps set in bronze sconces every few yards. Our shoes slid softly into a thick, crimson carpet. The walls were wood-paneled and dotted with marble busts and oil-painted landscapes and portraits of well-dressed men and women who all seemed to share identical frowns. It dawned on me that I was running through either a castle or a mansion next to a man I didn’t know towards something that sounded like bloody murder.

As it turns out, the metaphor was entirely literal in my situation.

“Jesus God,” Peter said as we located the source of the screaming.

The long hall opened up to a series of rooms set in a large foyer. One of the doors led out into a stone courtyard surrounded by towering bay windows. I caught the smell of honeysuckle and autumn air blowing in through an open frame. There was a small crowd in the courtyard all circled around a dead woman. I counted five in total (other than the deceased). All were dressed similar to Peter in fine, fitted suits or sleek evening gowns that rolled with the breeze.

“What happened?” Peter asked, taking a step towards the group.

He half bent like he wanted to check the dead woman’s pulse but there was clearly no point; her limbs were a broken tangle framing a bent neck. Beyond being shattered, the corpse also lay cooling in a wide pool of blood, her throat slit open from ear to ear. My first thought was that someone must have hated her, or loved her, very much to extend that level of violence towards the woman.

One of the men in the crowd opened his mouth to reply but only ended up shaking his head. He looked to be the youngest of the bunch, in his twenties at most. There were two other men, both peers to Peter, as well as two women. The one in the black dress was tall and stunning and practically shimmered in the moonlight under the weight of silver and diamonds at ears and throat and wrist. It was the other woman, the one in red, who was the owner of the scream. She stood alone in the corner of the courtyard under a willow tree. She’d calmed down and was no longer shrieking but her voice was unmistakable as she sobbed and let out an occasional whimper.

“Has anyone called for, uh, an ambulance?” I asked. I looked down at blood spilling into the grooves between cobblestones. “Or the police?”

One of the middle-aged men, a tall ginger in a tweed suit, gave me a confused look.

“None of us have our phones, don’t you remember?” he asked. “We turned everything over to Mary when we arrived at Foxflight Manor. Even our car keys.” My face must have looked blank because the man continued. “To preserve historical accuracy for the event? And to keep anyone drinking too much from heading out early. This was not more than three hours ago, Bruce.”

“I’m sorry, I think I’m just rattled. Feeling confused.”

It was more than that. I felt a low but growing terror nipping at my nerves. All of the blood in the courtyard, the screaming…I took a long breath to try to steady myself.

Peter put a hand on my shoulder. “Understandable.” He looked at the group. “Does anyone know where Mary put the phones and our keys?”

“I saw her taking them out of the room right before dinner but didn’t see where she went with them,” said the woman in black.

I got ready to ask if we could check with Mary then realized the group would have done that immediately if it was an option. Mary must be the dead woman. I tried to shake my head clear. My memory was patchy for the night but getting better. The woman in black was Evaline, the one in red was Kelly. The tall ginger was Roger, the younger guy Lucas, and the final man in the black suit with the beard was…

“William,” I said out loud.

The man looked over at me and raised an eyebrow.

“Um, did you see anything?” I asked quickly.

“No, nothing. I mean, I was the second one down here after Kelly but Mary was already, well, as she is now.”

“It’s sick,” said Lucas. “Whoever did this…” He looked around. “You know, I’m sure it wasn’t one of us, naturally. Do we think the killer is still in Foxflight?”

“We should cover her,” Evaline said. “We shouldn’t just leave her out and exposed like this. It’s not dignified.”

Peter shrugged off his blazer and gently laid it over Mary’s body. I felt a little tension release from the group once her dead eyes and open throat were hidden. The look on her face, that final expression…it was not one of peace.

A half-seen movement caused me to glance across the courtyard. Someone was watching us through one of the massive windows, their face partially hidden in the glare of moonlight on glass but still familiar. It was a woman, older than the two in the courtyard. I wondered why she wasn’t joining us. Maybe she was afraid of the sight of blood.

“Well, what’s the plan?” Lucas asked.

“Not much we can do without a phone or car keys,” Evaline said, biting a bright red lip.

“I’ve got a spare key on a magnet under my bumper,” Peter said. “I’ll drive into town while the rest of you look for a phone.” He looked down at the jacket covering Mary. “We should bring her inside.”

Lucas winced. “I don’t think we’re supposed to disturb a crime scene.”

The group exchanged uncertain looks.

“I think he’s right,” Roger said. “The police will want to see everything as is.”

“Okay,” Peter agreed. “It just doesn’t feel right leaving her out here.”

“Well, it’s not like anything is going to hurt her,” Evaline said.

Kelly began to cry again, quietly.

We split into pairs to search the house. I went with Evaline, who walked briskly through the halls towards the kitchen.

“I have a hunch,” she told me.

The room was massive, dominated by a line of old gas stoves against one wall, a butcher block island in the middle, and all manner of cutlery, pan, and pot hanging down from above like a forest of spiders. Evaline moved efficiently down a row of cupboards, opening and closing each after a quick scan. I shuffled around, trying to look for any suspicious boxes left out in the open or on top of an icebox. The mansion really did feel like a place frozen in time, a window into what the world was like two hundred years in the past.

“I don’t think Mary put the phones inside the oven,” Evaline whispered, causing me to jump and slam the stove shut.

“Sorry, I was just-”

I was spared having to provide an answer when Peter’s voice rang out asking everyone to come to the foyer. He sounded…not panicked, exactly, but rattled. Considering how calm he’d been when faced with a dead body broken on courtyard stones, his new agitation was troubling. William and Lucas were already waiting with Peter when we arrived. Roger and Kelly rushed in a few moments later. Peter was staring at the massive double door that rose above us leading to the driveway. He turned to face us, running a hand through graying hair like he was dragging a rake across a yard.

“I can’t get out,” Peter said.

Roger stood up and walked towards the door. “It’s locked?”

“Not just locked. It…I won’t open at all. Neither will the windows.”

Roger frowned and tried the knob. It didn’t even wiggle. He turned harder, broad face turning redder than his hair. When the door continued to resist, Roger put first a shoulder and then a boot into it. He might as well have tried to move a stone wall. William joined him and gave a three count. The two men hit the door at the same time to absolutely no effect.

“Stand back, please,” Lucas said, hefting an antique chair over his head.

He hurled the chair at one of the big windows next to the front door. The chair bounced off the glass without leaving a scratch. All of us stared until Peter broke the silence.

“Like I said, we can’t get out.”

Kelly walked up to the window and began tugging at it.

“This doesn’t make any sense. A house can’t just…trap you. We can’t be stuck.”

She began pounding on the window. Evaline moved to her side and gently pulled her back.

“If everyone could get behind something sturdy, I’d like to try something,” Evaline said.

We obliged. Evaline hiked up her dress, showing enough skin to make my pulse start running. There was a black garter belt just above her knee. Inside of the garter was a holster containing a small black pistol. It was a modern one, the kind of thing that appeared to be all plastic and sharp lines. Evaline took cover behind a suit of armor on a stand at the end of the hall, aimed the gun carefully with a two-hand grip, then squeezed off a shot at the same window Lucas had assaulted with the chair.

I’d covered my ears when I saw her point the pistol but the loud crack of the gun firing still made my teeth rattle. I saw that none of the others had thought to protect their ears and several of them winced in pain. The initial bang was followed by two quieter pings; the first was the bullet striking the window and ricocheting back. The second was it striking the wall above Peter and lodging into the wood. Evaline slipped the gun back into the holster on her leg. Roger walked out from behind the bookshelf he’d been using as cover.

“What in the Hell is going on? Why does a manor house have bulletproof windows?” He glanced at Evaline. “And what is a nice girl like you doing with a Glock?”

Evaline leaned her head to the side and brushed back her dark hair. A jagged scar ran from just above her shoulder nearly to her ear.

“When I was seventeen years old, a man attacked me with a knife,” she told Roger. “I decided then that nobody ever gets to make me feel powerless again.”

We all emerged from our places of shelter. Lucas aimed a useless kick at the door.

“We should check all of the other doors and some windows, just in case,” Peter suggested. “I have a hunch the entire house is locked down but maybe there’s something-”

“Hey, sorry to cut in but I just realized the other woman isn’t here,” I said. Everyone turned to look at me and I suddenly felt awkward and confused. “The older woman? I can’t seem to recall her name. Gray hair, Victorian dress?”

Peter cleared his throat. “There was no one else at the dinner party, Bruce. Just us here. Well, and Mary, of course.”

“The house is supposed to be haunted,” Lucas said. “Maybe Bruce saw a ghost?”

At first, I assumed he was mocking me but his face was serious.

“I’ve seen a ghost here,” Kelly said from where she stood in the corner. “More than one, actually. I think they’re watching us.”

I didn’t reply but I had the same feeling we were being watched. My hands were trembling. I had to fight panic. We were trapped inside of a house with a dead woman…maybe a lot of dead people. I stepped back into the shadow of the stairwell while the others argued. I didn’t want them to see me shaking.

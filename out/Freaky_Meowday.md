I love my cat Mochi. He is the highlight of my day especially when he greets me after I get home from work. He would do the Meow-meow-meow as he brushed his furry white body against my legs. I would pick him up and he would purr like a cherry-red hotrod. His fur would get all over me but I didn’t care, I loved Mochi like he was my little baby. These days Mochi is all I’ve got after losing all my money in the stock market crash. I spend most if not all my salary from working at my new McDonalds job on the best cat food however in this down economy with ever rising inflation, I had to downgrade to Purina from Hill Science Diet. Day by day he grew noticeably angrier until one day I came home from work and all the curtains were drawn closed. The house was dark with a cold mist rolling around on the floor and a faint red light coming from the living room. As I approach the living room I started to hear what sounded like a faint deep murmuring chant. It grew louder and louder until I was face to face with what was truly going on.

There a small tiny figure stood in a blood-red silk robe in the middle of what looked like a pentagram drawn in a dark red substance. On the walls were scribbled words in a language I had never before seen. Around the pentagram were candelabras holding up lit red candles. Judging by how much the candles have melted, this has been going on for some time now. A vile smell of dried blood and rotting flesh circulated the room enough to make my eyes tear up with disgust.

“Get out of my house, intruder! I am calling the police!” I yell at the top of my voice. The figure seemed unfazed and unresponsive. I took out my phone, and quickly dialed 9-1-1. The call dialed and dialed for what seemed like eternity until finally the operator picked up. Perhaps sensing this threat to its plans, the figure slowly turned around revealing what was behind the robe. It was my cat Mochi.

*Hello 9-1-1 what is your emergency?...Hello…Hello?*

Before I could say a word a gale emanating from behind Mochi knocks the phone out of my hand onto the cold, misty floor. No matter how hard I tried the mist kept me from finding my phone as I frantically waved my hands around the ground. I wander until suddenly the mist subsides to reveal that I had fallen into his trap. I was now on top of a pentagram myself, right beside Mochi’s pentagram. No matter how hard I tried I couldn’t move an inch out of the pentagram. My arms beating against some satanic forcefield, I beg Mochi to stop, even offering to switch back to Hill’s Science Diet but to no avail…Mochi was going to go forth with whatever ritual this was.

A voice emanated from Mochi while his mouth didn’t even move, his small body now hovering 6 feet in the air with eyes glowing red.

*I ONLY DESERVE THE BEST IN BIOLOGICALLY-BASED NUTRITION TO HELP LIVE MY BEST LIFE. HILL’S SCIENCE DIET CAT FOOD PROVIDES PRECISELY BALANCED NUTRITION TO IMPROVE FELINE HEALTH.*

I started hovering in the air until I was face to face with Mochi. His mouth began to open with what looked like his glowing red soul coming out of his body and quickly shooting into mine. It was painful and intense, making me shake violently while screaming for help. My eyes rolled to the back of my skull and eventually I black out.

I wake up in my bed in a hazy mood. It’s spring here in Toronto, the birds were chirping and the sun was up. I was relieved, it was only a dream, a nightmare…or so I thought. Exhausted, I roll over to the side of my bed only for my hands to touch what felt like a cold body. I open my eyes and see a dead PetSmart employee. I jump out of bed like a flea. This couldn’t be real I thought, someone is playing a very elaborate prank on me. I look down upon myself and realize that I still had my work clothes on including shoes which had mud on them. I look at the nightstand to find today’s paper strangely on top of it. The headline read:

*Crazy Millenial Steals Lifetime Supply of Cat Food, Kidnaps One*

This can’t be I thought, quickly reading through the article. THIS CAN’T BE ME! But there it was, a picture of me roundhouse kicking the PetSmart employee through the store window and hijacking a truck loaded with Hill’s science diet cat food.

A flash bang flies into my room. Before I knew it I was on the ground. All I could see was white with a loud ringing in my ears. I felt handcuffs on my hands as something helped me stand up and before I knew it I was in a police car in front of the house. As I am driven away to life imprisonment I look back at my home, seeing Mochi in one of the windows holding up the deed to the house along with a picture of all the cat food stashed in a secret location not far from the house. They were never going to find the cat food and I was to be framed for first-degree red-handed murder. Then just as the police car turned the corner of the street, Mochi signaled to me to check my crotch. As if the day couldn’t get any worse I realize that I was missing my testicles. The cat in the window then held up a handheld flamethrower in one hand and slowly started to torch a Ziploc bag containing my balls in the other. I burst into tears only to be hit with an electrified baton and told to shut up. Mochi had gotten his sweet revenge. I couldn’t do anything about it. I am finished.

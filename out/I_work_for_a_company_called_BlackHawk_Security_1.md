There is no info about this company and no proof it even ever existed, at least not the one I work at. BlackHawk Security is not your average security company, but I’m guessing you have guessed that by now. Anyway, allow me to tell you a little about my experiences here.. starting with my first job.

   My first job was as a.. well security guard. I was stationed in a security office for the night shift. I was stationed at an office building in Kentucky, my supervisor met me at the front of the building, handing me an envelope. “What's this?” I had asked him. “Open it in the office, and don't talk to anyone”. I thought he was just trying to play a joke on me and thought I should just play along. Walking inside I noticed the reception area was empty, except for the receptionist sitting behind the front desk. She looked relatively normal except for the fact that she was smiling.. not like a normal smile but a creepy smile. It was wide and it made me very uncomfortable. I decided to just leave her alone and go to the elevator. After entering the elevator I pressed a star button that I was told would take me to the security office.

  Soon the elevator stopped at the 5th floor, and 3 office workers stepped inside. They all had the same weird ass smile that the receptionist had. “So, you are the fresh meat right?”. The question startled me so much that I jumped a bit. I looked around the elevator and one of the office workers was looking at me. “Y-yeah I guess…I’m the new security officer”. I tried to sound tough and nonchalant but failed miserably. The man looked like he could see my fear. He began to smile wider.. “Finally, someone who talks… They usually ignore us. Don't be afraid.. we don't hurt unless you hurt us..”. What. The. Hell? “W-what?” I was seriously regretting my life choices and was just thinking about how long it would take to get to the security office. “We are not the ones you should worry about… it’s the 5th floor you shouldn’t talk t-“ DING! Finally! We had stopped at the 5th floor and the man looked disappointed, his smile faltering. “Aww.. I wanted to talk more. Oh well, see you sooon”. All 3 got out and the elevator door closed, going one more up to the security floor.

  Getting out of the elevator, I started walking across a hallway, following signs that finally led me to the security office. The door leading into the security office was a heavy duty metallic door with a keycard reader next to it. Swiping my card, I entered the office. The office was a medium sized room with 2 desks, a few filing cabinets, 2 monitors on each desk and a few lockers at the back of the room. Sitting down at a desk, I take out the envelope and opened it, finding a piece of paper inside. Taking out the paper I started to read it:

  If you are reading this, you are the new security officer at ███████ co. . Follow these rules to survive your shift, this is not a joke.

Rule 1. Do not make any loud noises on the 5th floor, also do not talk to anyone on the 5th floor. If you do, run to the security office. Also, do not talk to anyone who works on the 5th floor.

Rule 2. Perform patrols regularly. If you meet another security guard on your patrol, DO NOT LOOK AT HIS FACE, he won’t like it. If he talks to you, do not respond. If he says “I think you forgot something” It means you have broken a rule and should run to the office, radioing HQ. You should then remain in the office for the remainder of your shift or until VETA 9 arrives. 

Rule 3. This is rare but, If you are on floor 3 and you hear a woman cry, pull the fire alarm IMMEDIATELY and radio HQ. VETA 9 will be there soon to resolve the issue. Resume patrol and do not go back into the 3rd floor for the remainder of your shift.

Rule 4. Do not leave the building until your shift is over. They will follow you. 

Rule 5. Do not use the stairs. Always use the elevator.

 Putting the paper down on the desk, I couldn’t help but laugh. What bullshit, they really think I’m going to fall for this? Yeah sure. I got up and decided to start my first patrol. I checked my watch and saw that it was 9:04pm. My shift was 9:00pm—6:00am… I exited the office, going to the elevator and waiting for it to come up. I ended up being there for a minute before the elevator finally opened and I entered the elevator. Deciding to go down the line I pressed the 5th floor button. The elevator opened its doors seconds later, and I walked out onto the hardwood floor of a large cubicle room. The room was quite large, holding maybe a hundred cubicles. I started walking around, looking into the cubicles. The floor was quiet, except for the sounds of keyboards and phones.. nobody was talking. Each cubicle held an employee, hard at work typing away on a computer, writing notes on paper, and… wait. I stopped at one cubicle where an employee was just standing there, not moving, not even breathing from the looks of it. 

  The employee was smiling, like everyone else. He was facing me, I then recognized him as the man who had talked to me on the elevator. “Hello buddy…” his voice was slow and… like two people were talking, one high pitched and one low pitched. What in all that is holy is happening?!?!, is all that was on my mind. I was about to say something but he ran to me and put a finger to my mouth, silencing me. “Shhhhhh…. You shouldn't talk here.. the manager might hear you…” I decided to push him off me and go back to the elevator. 

  The 4th floor was much the same, everyone smiling but much more talkative. I had a good laugh with an employee who was talking about his family, and how his kid (who is 7) fell into the toilet and got stuck. I then left and went to the 3rd floor, the second I put my foot on the carpet of the 3rd floor… My gut told me to turn around and move on. I started walking around, the air was much colder from the other floors. Walking around, I saw much the same of the other floors.. cubicles and people working inside. I saw a break room so I decided to get a coffee. On my way to the break room however… the faint sound of someone crying enters my ears. “The hell?” The sound begins to get closer… and closer… “Is that a woman?” I left the break room and began walking to the source.. The room was quiet, everyone had stopped working and was standing up. In front of me, maybe 10 feet.. was a woman dressed in a suit and tie.. but she was abnormally tall. She wore that same smile everyone else had but with bloodshot eyes. her sobs then turned to giggles. Her smile started getting wider… and wider.. oh god it was so wide that it was ripping her skin and flesh. The end of her smile was now parallel with her eyes.. 

  “What the fu-“ She then started screaming and running towards me, I turned around and booked it to the elevator. Maybe those rules were right.. I didn’t want them to be but everything else pointed to the fact that they were. I finally reached the elevator and got in, remembering the rule at last… “ah shit.. the fire alarm!” I looked around outside and saw a fire alarm right next to the elevator.. I managed to pull it before the door closed and the woman rammed into the elevator. 

  “WHAT THE HELL!!” I was screaming in the elevator as the elevator moved to the security office.. I then reached for my radio and turned it on. “This is security officer \[REDACTED\] WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON HERE!?!” I shouted into the radio. There was silence for a few seconds then a female voice came over the radio. “Rule 2 or rule 3?”. “MA'AM I WAS JUST CHASED BY A WOMAN WHO LOOKED LIKE SHE COULD PLAY FOR THE NBA!” “Rule 3 then?” She answered confused. “VETA 9 is on the way, stay away from the 3rd floor.” “Who the HELL is VETA 9?! I want to know what’s going on here!” At this point I was getting agitated, then she answered in a slightly annoyed voice. “Listen sir, you are not in the position to be asking these questions, read the rules CAREFULLY and stay away from the 3rd floor.” I turned the radio off in frustration and got out as the elevator door opened. 

   As I walked along the hallway towards the security office, I started hearing a second pair of footsteps approaching me from behind. I decided to keep my eyes forward and return to the office. “Rough night huh? Yeah, most new officers at that company are the same way you were.” I kept walking towards the door, ignoring whoever was behind me. “Hey buddy, *I think you forgot something*” that made me stop in my tracks. Then, darkness. The entire floor was pitch black. I reached for my flashlight, turning it on and looking around. Right in front of me was the man from the 5th floor. “Right on cue huh? Those golden words make me so happy… because then we get another employee.” His smile began to widen, ripping his skin and flesh like it did with the woman. He began laughing, walking towards me.. then running. He grabbed me with his hands, lifting me up and opening his mouth.

  I started regretting every mistake I ever made, I regretted not asking my girlfriend to marry me, not going to college.. not being such an idiot that I was discharged from the marines.. I knew I was going to die, and the man was about to kill me. BANG BANG. The creature holding me closed his mouth, looking behind me.. I did the same and saw several blinding lights. Several more shots later and the creature dropped me and started moving backwards. A man walked above me and stopped shooting, holding out his hand. “Hey kid, VETA 9 here to save your ass!”

  I was to remain with the team until my shift ended, and was reassigned to another job… Anyway, I should post this now because I have to get ready for a mission with my team. I will explain more later but for now wish me luck, pray I don’t die..

I don't know where to start. I always read people's stories here but never thought I'd be the one posting. I don't know what to think, or to do. 

I have to start from the beginning. My friends and I play a mobile game. As in every game, we have our favourite characters but I, specifically, have one character I'm obsessed with.  I always say 'I wish Axel was real.', 'I just want Axel to be real.' We have talks in which I'm jokingly manifesting for him to be real. But these all were just jokes. I am fully aware he's a fictional character in a mobile game. 

So, a week ago my mum's childhood best friend invited us over to stay at her summer house. We happily accepted and drove over there. She has two sons, whom I also know, and she said a friend of theirs were going to visit too. We were okay with it of course, since we know and trust these people. 

I wish we never accepted, or even went there to begin with. Because that's when it turned into a nightmare for me. 

The friend arrived. He looked exactly like my favourite character Axel from the game I'm playing. Not similar, he's an exact copy of him though they didn't share the same name. I was creeped out when I first saw him but everything seemed normal, he looked and acted like a normal person. I showed my mum the character, saying they were exactly the same, and she said she didn't think the friend looked like him at all. 

I was trying to calm myself down, thinking maybe it was just my imagination because i liked the character a lot. Until some instances changed my mind and made my skin crawl. 

We were having dinner, and I asked some very basic questions to the friend. As in where he lived, what was his occupation, age etc. The moment I asked, everyone at the table turned to me with the same eerie, robotic expression on their faces. Including my mum. No one said a word, just stared at me. I don't know if I imagined it or not but I saw the friend grinning at me. Then a minute later, everyone turned back to normal, acting like I never spoke. 

I feel like I'm always being watched, like someone's breathing down my neck. In the literal sense. The friend keeps staring at me, watching everything I do with a blank expression. I'm scared to make eye contact, I once looked back up and he didn't even move, just smiled at me with a Cheshire cat like smile. Wherever I go, I always see him lurking around a corner, staring at me with a weird smile on his face. I, again, told my mum. About the dinner, about all of this. She says those things didn't happen, she doesn't know what I'm talking about and the friend seems like a very nice person. 

This last thing that happened is what made me write this post. 
 
Everyone was sitting outside. I went inside to use the bathroom. There are glass doors, so I could see everyone  was still sitting there when I got in the house. When I opened the door to the bathroom, the friend was there, looking straight at me. Before I could say or do anything he pulled me in and shut the door behind me. I froze with fear, didn't even think of trying to get out. He asked me if I wanted to know a secret with an abnormally huge grin on his face. I couldn't say anything, I was paralysed with terror. He said, "My real name is Axel. Aren't you happy to see me?" 

I never looked at him so directly or up close before, and it was like he had no pupils. His face looked so much like a porcelain doll, like his body was not real and it was just a human suit. He was already grinning but suddenly, his face contorted into an inhumane expression. I screamed so loud that my throat still hurts. I darted out the bathroom, and got outside. Everyone was still sitting with the friend, all staring at him like they were in a trance, acting like they didn't hear me screaming. When I got back, he looked at me with a smirk asking if I was feeling good. 

After this, the same thing happened, everyone went back to being normal. I told my mum that I wanted to leave, and that we should, but she just doesn't want to and says I should stay too because it'd be rude if I left early. I don't know what to do. I want to leave but I can't leave my mum behind. I'm living with constant fear and I'm so scared to be alone.

Idk where to start this story. I guess i’ll introduce myself. My name is James, I am a 27 year old male, and I live in a particular quiet area. Well, used to. I lived in rural upper Michigan for years, and loved it out here. Had no neighbors basically, just all property. I’ve always had this “eerie” feeling being out here, but it doesn’t compared to how I felt a few weeks ago. I was driving home one night from my job, when all of a sudden, my radio randomly turns on. I only use bluetooth, so I haven’t used my radio in YEARS. So it kind of scared me. But station 99.4 comes on, and this will be relevant later in this story. 

Mind you, I have NEVER heard, nor seen this station before when I used radio, even the other day when I used my moms car. The radio read “Attention all Grant residents, please find shelter immediately. There have been multiple reports of tall, dark blue creatures spotted walking around town. For now, all of you are sectioned off in the city, and no one comes in and out. please stay tuned as we find out more information.” Now this had me shaking. I made sure that the pistol in my glovebox was loaded, and I kept it on the passenger seat. I then get a text from the number 994, and it read: “IT IS SAFE TO BE OUTSIDE NOW. THE WHOLE CREATURE THING TURNED OUT TO BE A HOAX.” I stared for a good few minutes at my phone as I was pulled over on the side of the road, wondering what I should do. 

I went with my gut, and was not trusting the text, and drove STRAIGHT home. On the way home, I saw one of those .. “things”. It was about 8.5 feet tall, dark blue skin, and almost a humanoid face, but it was just- off. I don’t think it saw me, but I didn’t take any chances. I’m surprised my little Sunfire could go from 0-60 so fast. I eventually reached home, darting it inside. I then got a text from my friend who lives a few miles down the road, saying how a creature ran into his home and just killed his entire family. He said it ran like nothing he’d ever seen, and had this “screech” that he can’t unhear. He unloaded a full clip from his assault rifle in it, and all it did was make the damn thing run. He said it ran screeching, and leaking a purple ooze. I told him that I was home now, and loading up to leave. I then get another update from the radio station, but this time it came from my phone. “Hello all Grant residents. I hope you guys are still alive. The government is already trying to cover this entire thing up and kill everyone in the town, for they have fenced off the entire town. We now have reports of similar, smaller creatures in the town. Unlike the blue ones, these ones are completely not human-like. We are not sure what is going on, but just stay indoors and HIDE.” 

Now i’m thinking hard about this. What the hell could’ve caused all of this? I sat for 10 minutes just thinking, but then I remembered. The lake. A couple years ago, people kept going after visiting a lake in our town. There was a hospital down the street from the lake, and a couple weeks ago the hospital randomly shut down, and it was left abandoned. What if the hospital were conducting some kind of experiments? I get back to loading my guns, when I hear a loud “BANG” from downstairs. I run down there, just to see a green, animal looking thing. It had no eyes, but it was staring directly into my soul. If that makes sense. I didn’t hesitate. I unloaded a full clip from my AK-47 into this “thing”. It shredded it apart, leaving the purple goo that my friend was talking about. I then burn it in my furnace in my house, just to get rid of it. The smell was god-awful. 

I then get a text from my friend. His name is Dan, so that’s what i’ll be calling him from now on. Dan sent me this picture, and it was a bunch of military men walking down the street in gas masks, flamethrowers and guns in hand. He said that the military men won’t even speak to him, they just kept on going. I noticed that my data started to slow down, and my wifi was completely out. I called 9-1-1 to ask what is going on, and no response. the 994 number texted again, but this time, it was way scarier. “JAMES. WE KNOW WHERE YOU ARE. JUST LISTEN AND YOU WILL LIVE. GO INTO THE BEAM GO INTO THE BEAM GO INTO THE BEAM”. 

I was thinking “what the hell?” to myself. I go outside and see a giant pyramid-type flying piece of metal shining this purple beam. I also saw military men firing at it, failing to get rid of it. I hop in my car, and drive as fast as I can AWAY from the beam. I see then a channel 99.4 van on the side of the road, but somethings off. It’s now getting dark, and the lights are all on in the van. I pull closer, only to see blood splattered EVERYWHERE. on the tires, windshield, doors, handles, hell even the inside was covered. I sped off, hoping to reach city limits soon. 

I text Dan, asking if he’s alright, and i’m waiting on a response. I then approach city limits, only to realize that there’s a fence all around that is heavily guarded. I pull up to the gate, and ask the man standing next to it if I can leave, and this is exactly what he says. “No one comes in or out. Until we get things under control at least. Feel free to check again in a month. “A MONTH?” I thought to myself. HELL no. I tell him that i’m getting out one way or another. He did not like this comment very much, as he simply walked up to my car walked up to my car, and that’s all that I can remember. 

I woke up cold and in pain, slowly realizing where I am. I am inside of the hospital. I hear screams from all over, and lights constantly flickering. I can’t even stand, the pain is so bad. I look at my veins, and they have become this dark purple color. I run outside my room, only to see people turning into those blue monsters in the other rooms on this floor, and government officials are just behind bulletproof glass panes. I then see a door, and book it. I ended up into this empty hall, with an elevator at the end. I get on the elevator, fighting the pain, and go to the first floor. I see government officials all over the lobby, but at this point the adrenaline kicks in and I run. I call Dan, only to get no answer. I see a military jeep stopped, so I hop in. We rode out of the city, and I made it out. I did, however, notice that my skin now has this blue tint, and it’s getting worse. Must be nothing.

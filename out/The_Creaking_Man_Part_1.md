*-Signed Mr.Crickler*

I read through the letter and knew something wasn’t right from the start. The capitalization was all off. I skimmed over the letters and numbers and it appeared to be a message. I figured it out pretty quickly but it wasn’t my priority to contemplate further about it. Like the letter said I’m a private detective although I have since retired as my family needed more attention.

I was forced to take this job opportunity as I don’t have the funds to pay out of pocket for my daughter Charlotte's chemotherapy treatment. The insurance wouldn’t cover the full cost, so I ended my retirement and left as soon as I got the letter. Before that I made sure to let my husband and daughter know of what I was doing so they wouldn’t be worried.

An hour later I made it to the site. It was quite expansive like Mr.Crickler said with a look of a prison with tall watchtowers and iron wire gates going for miles. Why an entertainment company needed a compound like this to produce content was beyond me, but I can’t say it didn’t intrigue me all the more. I walk up to the gate and peer through to scope out the area, however I dared not touch the gate on the off chance it was electric.

I pulled the key out from my back pocket and with a quick flick of the wrist the massive front gate doors had started to automatically open. Bells rang from all parts of the compound, that must be the signal he was talking about for my acceptance of the job. Now I had to find my task paper which was hidden away. I walked in the tunnel, it was long and had some semi-circle cuts that made openings to the outside. My footsteps echoed throughout the area and I looked to the left wall of the tunnel. The whole English alphabet was lined up on the ends of bricks. This wall was unlike the rest of the tunnel, as if it were installed there for repairs. 

All the letters were lower cased in a red color. The outlier being a capital “J” colored in yellow. I touched all over the wall just to make sure. I knew that the “J” is what I was after as the others sound hollow upon knocking. I pushed in the J and it went to the back and when I let go it recoiled out to its original position. I pushed it in again and looked around to find anything. I found a square compartment located on the bottom of the square space. 

Inside was a letter and a small mirror. With childlike joy I opened the letter as my job just got a hell of a lot more interesting. The scope was beyond anything I had thought when I drove here. I pulled out a task paper with the several ones listed in detail. Residing there as well was a keycard and 50 dollars in CricklerBucks, fake money. I put it all away and read the task paper.

*dear jessica williams,*

*if you are reading this then congratulations on your new job! you may use anything at your disposal, and within this site to do your tasks. you need not worry about any property damage or inventory. not to mention that i have left useful items across the whole complex that will aid you. this letter won’t be long but i will now list the tasks for you.*

*#1 clean up blood in the entertainment hall. as soon as you go into the lobby, take the door on the north left. go through “sector a” and find the massive opening in the middle right. remember to wipe down and clean the pipe.*

*#2 find all coven related merchandise and burn it. the merchandise was found to be made with cheap flammable material and needed a recall. i need you to go to the counter, find the inventory journal, and seek out the items you need to throw into the incinerator room.*

*#3 find the red files. on the back left side of the merchandise area is the “file office”, it is locked behind a six digit code that I can’t tell you. You must figure it out yourself with the clues available.*

*#4 go into the board hall, remove all evidence of coven r. rithman, erase the boards and wash them. take any belongings of coven and burn them all in the incinerator. you may find the board meeting room by going through the north door of the lobby and down the hallway, to the left, then past the security office. you will need a new key card to get in. you may find one of that level in my office.* 

*#5 find mr.covens locked up office and break in. take gasoline from the entertainment hall storage area and burn the whole room. make sure to lock the door tight, and click the green button on the inside or outside to open air vents so that smoke doesn’t flood the area. the rooms are made to be fire proof so it won’t damage the integrity of our marvelous building. this area is located a little bit north of the board meeting room, on the right side there are three glass office rooms with name cards.*

*#6 delete the specialized folder in the security office room. you only have around 3 batteries in the room to supply power incase of an emergency. each battery only gives around 25% extra power. you have to last around 15 minutes until deletion has taken place. you know where the security room is by now.*

*#7 escape alive. run for the lobby door, use a fire exit, use anything you can to get out of there.* 

*each task you complete earns you a small lump sum of the total amount like i stated before. i know it looks bad, but i have my reasons for this. it goes only up from here jessica williams, i hope to see you soon.*

*-Signed Mr.Crickler*

I felt shocked once my tasks were unveiled to me, as it was clear as day something was being covered up. However I really need the money for Charlotte. Not to mention that there isn’t much that makes Mr.Crickler a suspect besides the fact of all these elaborate clues, puzzles, and letters existing. I would have to know more before I cast judgment.

I put the paper back into my pocket and took out the keycard. I looked to my left and right. There were roads leading to two massive parking lots. On the north left side was a fountain statue of a woman shooting water out of her hands. On the north right was a small trash area with what looked like the incinerator. I went fully north to the front entrance and swiped the keycard on my right and entered inside. 

The lobby was open and the air was fresh. I looked to my right and saw the merchandise area. North of my location was the semi-circle desk with a glass sliding door behind it. Next to that desk was a box TV on a metal cart with wheels, and a small plastic trash bin to the right of it. I walked over to the desk and searched for any resources that could help me with my mission like he said and I found a master key inside one of the four desk drawers. Of course there was the usual papers, office supplies, documents, and there was surprisingly some candy which happened to be my favorite kind. White chocolate orbs with a creamy inside. I took the box and put it on the table. I took two pieces from the box and walked towards the door.

\*BZZZZZZZZZZZZSHT\* I jumped in surprise.

Apparently the TV on the small metal cart flared to life with static on its own. I kneeled down and went to turn it off, but I saw that it was unplugged from the outlet. I took steps back to the desk and they made creaking noises, as if I was walking on a shambling wooden floor. The trash bin next to the TV cart fell over and two rats the size of cats scurried out and ran towards the door. I bolted away and swiped my keycard, locking the door behind me and looking through the small square window. 

The trash bin was upright again. 

I took a couple steps back from the door and sat down. Nothing of what I had experienced or seen made sense. My heart was pounding as I don’t like crawley things from rodents to spiders. My footsteps stopped making weird noises, and before all that the floor sounded normal with the usual clicks and clacks of my shoes on the black and white tiled floor. Something was horribly wrong with this place and I couldn’t put my finger on it just yet. I took a piece of chocolate from my pocket and unwrapped it. I popped it in my mouth as I got back up to look around.

After walking for a few seconds I found the door easily and didn’t bother wasting time looking at needless doors. I swiped my card and entered inside the Entertainment Hall and my footsteps made creaking noises once more. I was on guard, the hairs on the back of my neck stood up, I felt chills, a burning itch of pins and needles going down from my neck to my lower back. I pushed forward looking around. To my right was a locker with a towel bench. On my far north left was the entrance to the Storage Room. That was where I needed to get the janitorial equipment. 

There was what looked like an official crime scene in the middle with yellow tape and four wooden pikes holding it all up. A bloody mess and what looked like bone fragments laid in a dried up puddle of viscera. The large bloody pipe lay to the right side of the door to the Storage Room. I looked around myself  as if something was watching my very soul. I moved quickly and entered the storage room.

It hit me in the face so hard and I didn’t expect a thing based on how in shape this place was for being abandoned for years. The wicked smell of damp walls, rusted metal, mold, and other obscenities wafted to my nose as if trying to test my gag reflexes. My eyes teared and I wiped them with my sleeves. I walked around through the maze of tall shelves with various amounts of varied items in disarray, or the peak of unorganization as I call it.

Eventually I found a big clearing with the janitorial equipment which was claimed by mold and knocked over on the floor. I used one of the hoses by the sink to clean it, and fill the bucket with fresh water. The excess water went straight down the drain. I placed the mop in its proper position. I carted the equipment towards the door carefully to not knock any shelves over which could escalate into a dangerous situation.

I approached the door in which I had come in and entered the bathroom. Every footstep made a creaking noise. The wheels of the card made loud sloshing that mirrored a flowing river. As the cart slid across the floor it sent out ripples behind me, not unlike skipping stones at a lake. The place was abnormal, a pristine bathroom except lengthened into a massively long hallway that dips in quality as you go getting more decrepit and broken.

As I walked forward deeper in the porcelain hallway I passed the many sinks and mirrors. I felt that something was watching me but when I turned nothing was there. I looked forward and witnessed a horrifying sight. A man, a tall man who loomed over me and had abnormally lengthed fingers unlike a natural human. He wore an open safety harness over a greasy looking sweatshirt with patchwork sewing done all over. Especially in the two-opening pocket area. He wore well kept fancy dress pants, and his shoes were less to be desired. Wooden shoes that clicked and clacked with each step. Not to mention that string and leather strips were glued on to give them some semblance of fashion.

His face was gray and human, his eyes were lifeless. As if his smile alone could turn my blood to ice. I rubbed my eyes and my heart started pounding. The bathroom started to disappear from the back end and started to unmanifest towards me. Black fog jetted towards me without a second’s notice. The man approached me. Every limp resulted in a creak and crack that tickled my ear drums. Every joint and limb movement sent screams of agony to my ears, yet he never spoke. My legs started working on their own and I ditched the equipment without a second thought.

I didn’t focus on screaming as much as I did running. I couldn’t find the time to let out a yelp. The man got even faster as a consequence. The tortured and twisted sounds of hellish screams and crys for help. The snapping and cracking of bones as he tries to run but only results in an uncanny limp that speeds up as he moves closer with his blood lust. Tiles lifted from the floor and I was pelted relentlessly. Shielding the back of my head with my arms that got bruised and cut. The stall doors were opening and closing rapidly creating a swooshing sound of the ocean, the sinks faucets bent upwards towards me and blasted jet streams of water in my direction.

The mirrors shattered with glass everywhere like mini-explosions. I finally reached the door and ran outside into the Entertainment Hall. I stopped out of breath at the right side of the room in a panic. I had never experienced a monster like that before. My eyes twitched and my mind tried to make sense of something many would find hard to believe. I watched the door with the utmost readiness and anxiety, waiting for that same man to jump out at me once more.

However the noises ceased and everything felt normal once more. To comfort myself I tried to take out another one of my favorite white chocolates. The last one on me was not only melted, but it didn’t help that my clothes were soaked from the water and blood. I pushed back my messed up hair and squeezed the water out, and wiped my face with both hands. I remembered the towel bench on my left and walked over there. The adrenaline started to calm down and the pain settled in.

I put a towel on my hair and left it. I opened the locker and rummaged around, managing to find an emergency med kit. I spent two hours plucking and picking the glass and broken porcelain tile out of my body. I utilized my phone camera and that small mirror I had found before to get better angles on any hidden injuries. I used disinfectant, the burning sensation hurt like hell but thankfully wore off in a few minutes.

After that I wrapped my arms, thighs, back, and midsection in bandages. I pulled out an employee outfit I had found when putting the medkit back. I changed my clothes and felt better, sitting down and resting my head against the wall. I stared up at the ceiling giving deep breaths. I ended my break and carefully walked towards the ominous storage room. I peered inside and saw shelves broken and knocked over. Boxes of porcelain tiles were destroyed. The faucet of the sink was bent in a direction that pointed right at me. Safe to say that the place was a wreck, and I quickly carted the janitorial equipment out of there and to the crime scene.

I plunged the mop into the water and started sweeping the blood. I used the gloves in the cart to pick up the bone fragments and I dropped them into the bucket. When the blood was gone I dried up the mess with the towels. I turned my attention to the massive pipe covered in blood and I made a way to clean that as well. After all this I was done with my first task. I was tired and felt like going home, after that there was no way in hell I would sleep here tonight. Not to mention that I want answers from Mr.Crickler, of what he brought me into.

I grabbed the handle and pulled the equipment towards the storage room door. The man finally came out fuming, as if the act of cleaning up that blood was a mistake I had made. I pulled out my key card and started running. The man walked after me with a chilling confidence he would see me dead. I swiped the key card at the entrance and quickly shut the door. I ran down Sector A and heard glass blast to the wall as the door was broken by the mysterious force. 

My footsteps made creaking noises of varying decibels. The keycard felt slimy, and my shoes felt hot. The floor felt bouncy as if I walked on a trampoline. This got worse as I lost my balance smacking right into the door. I swiped the key card reader and opened the door. The man lifted his leg and kicked the door open shattering the glass. Thankfully I was far enough away to not get injured. I grabbed my bag and chocolate box from the desk and ran for the exit fearing for my life. 

That thing let out a sharp shrilling shriek in my direction that made me nauseous. It leapt forward at the door once I had shut it. I quickly put the chocolate in my bag and ran as fast as I could to my car. He kept following me as I started making my way down the tunnel. Iron gates began to manifest out of nowhere and fall from the slots of the ceiling behind me and the man could pass through them. They dropped faster and faster. The black inky liquid made its way to my feet and it was sticky as all hell.

I slid my feet out carefully and stood on my tippy toes inside the shoes. I side jumped and rolled on the grass. I didn’t have shoes now but I ducked into the last opening before another metal gate could materialize and fall down. With the pain of rocks and concrete hurting my feet I didn’t stop and  arrived at my car. I needed to catch my breath and rested on the driver seat with the door closed. I looked over at the man who had stopped chasing me as if he couldn’t leave that place. Or as if he didn’t want to leave that place just yet.

I looked at one of the camera’s and pulled a pen and paper out of my bag to write with. I wrote some questions and concerns I had as to what the hell was going on with that demon. I wrote that I wasn’t quitting, I would consider this situation from the safety of my home.

I was very exhausted mentally and physically from this. If someone else was in my position untrained I’m sure they would have died. But even as rusty as I am, I’m still capable. I started up the car and before I could drive off, a package fell from the sky and landed onto the ground with a thud. The drone flew off into the distance. My immense curiosity got the better of me and I went to inspect the box.

I would have assumed it were a bomb if it had not been dropped from so high in the air. Not to mention that the contents inside must not be fragile anyways.

I squatted down and used a pocket knife from my bag to slowly and carefully open the box. When I peered inside I was blown away. I counted $120,000 dollars inside total with a final note. I was excited to see what he had to say. As it is not everyday a drone drops payment on the same day you finish a shift. I took out the paper and read it.

*dear jessica williams,*

*i’m sorry if these letters seem repetitive. but it is one of the only ways i may communicate with you as my calls and emails are being tracked every day. i noticed that you wrote me a letter next to the camera. i am nearby, i’ll read it soon and get back to you. i saw that you had completed the first task and i’m proud of you. i’m horribly sorry for what I put you through without any warning.*  


*there is more to this story that you simply know. perhaps you have already gone to suspect me for something. but I promise you that all answers will come eventually, either given to you or sought out by you.* 

*your first lump sum payment has been sent for you remotely. you should go home to your family and rest for as long as you need. that should be enough to pay for your daughter's treatment out of pocket, however it really depends whether you wish to come back or not. if you don’t return within two weeks i will have considered that you had a change of mind and no longer wish to be an employee at fae entertainment Incorporated. however this misunderstanding can be mitigated with some simple letter to letter communication in this exact location under the gate camera. thank you again for the hard work jessica, and if you do decide to come back, I’ll inform you on what’s really going on here.*

I thought for a while inside my car. I wondered how he knew I needed money for my daughter's cancer treatment. Never in my life have I been in a fresh new situation like this as a private detective. My daughter's cancer treatment could be paid for now, but do I really want to be bored in early retirement as a mother? I feared for my life every second during those encounters with that man, however the rush I felt reminded me of the fun I had on the job. I kept the letter in a safe place for later, and drove home to see my family once more. I knew that if I were more prepared, I would welcome coming back with open arms.

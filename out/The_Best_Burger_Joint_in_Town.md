My dad let me borrow his 1969 mustang for my first date with Debbie Lynn. I felt like a king driving it carefully. I knew one scratch would be the end of my life.

“Be careful with it boy. It could be yours one day.” 

I didn’t have much money for a fancy dinner somewhere and it was only the first date . Dad let me borrow some money and told me after this he wants me to get a job. I definitely agreed. I’d love to have the freedom to buy whatever I want and maybe treat Debbie if she’d agree to be mine.

I picked her up at her parents house and met her at the door. Her dad shook my hand and didn’t seem too overly protective. 

“Have her home by eleven.” 

“Yes sir.”

It was a short drive to town and me and her made some good small talk. We both agreed to stop at the towns burger joint.

When I say they have the best food ever, I’m not joking. They have the best chili dogs, burgers, milkshakes ever. It’s been voted the best restaurant for the past ten years.

We pulled up and admired the 1950s style of the place and put our orders in. I was way too nervous but Debbie Lynn was everyone’s dream girl. She was so humble and sweet . I could tell she didn’t kiss on the first date but had some sass that she could hide well.

The employee came and sat out food down in front of us. I happened to notice it was one of my best buds.

“Hey John, how are you!” 

“I’m good, Brian. I am good. I just love my job. I love it! I’ve only been here about a week now but intend on staying.” He had on such a big smile but he’s eyes seemed...off.

“That sounds great buddy. Let me ask, are y’all hiring?”

He seemed to pause but his smile was frozen. 

“We’re uh...we’re. “

“We’ll go on and tell him big guy!” An older man wearing a white dress shirt and a retro tie wrapped his arm around him. Johns eyes got a bit bigger.

“We sure are!”

“My names Chuck! I’m the owner of this fine establishment! We sure are hiring and would love you to join.”

I shook his hand and thanked him.

“I know you won’t let me down. Come by Monday after school! Y’all enjoy your meal now.”

I looked back at Debbie Lynn and told her now id be able to take her out more. She had a smile on her face.

We enjoyed our date and rode around town a while. I got her home a few minutes early and she actually gave me a kiss. We became a couple officially.

Monday came around and I headed there after I got out of school. Chuck seemed very friendly and helped me learn some basic stuff I would be doing.

“Now this establishment has been under very tight management. We have a three strike system. So after three , you’re out.”

I assured him I would give it my all and he would be proud . 

“Alright everyone! Smiling faces.” The crew smiled and seemed overly happy.

This place was always busy and I tried my best to make Chuck proud and learn what I can. He even came by and patted my shoulder.

“You’re doing an excellent job, my friend. You deserve a break.” 

I walked out the back door and near the dumpsters were a few people lighting up cigarettes, John handed me one. Everyone had small talk and got to know me. A lot of these coworkers seemed older.

John checked his watch, “shit, it’s about time to go back in. You keep this pack of cigarettes and don’t open them until you get home.”

I slid the pack in my pocket and waited a few minutes before getting in early.

Towards the end of the shift I seen a woman in her early thirties approaching the counter. Chuck approached her with a big smile.

“Hello ma’am, what can I assist you with?”

“This burger has ketchup and mustard on it, I specifically requested it didn’t.” 

He blinked a few times and his smile was still frozen. “I see how that’s a problem . I’ll make sure you get another one on us and I’ll give you a coupon for a free one . We appreciate your business and I’m deeply sorry for this inconvenience.”

“Thank you so much.”

He personally made her one and she went on her way. 

“Okay guys, we need to have a meeting after we close in fifteen minutes.” Coworkers turned their head and looked worried. A girl named Emily had some tears in her eye.

We all cleaned up and the group seemed silent. They taught me how to mop and clean to Chuck standards.

“Alright gang, let’s all sit down.”

Everyone sat down and many had their heads down. 

“Who was running the grill before our little....incident.” 

No one was speaking and Emily’s eyes were closed and she began to shake.

“We are a team you guys. I’d sure hate to have to give everyone a strike for not being a team player.”

One of the older men pointed, “Emily did it.”

“Don’t lie you asshole.” She screamed out.

“Language , Emily. Now that wasn’t so hard. Thank you for that information. Now according to my chart, that puts you at strike two.”

“It was an accident.” She was sobbing.

“Now , now, just learn from it. Okay team, see you on your next shift and remember, if you’re not ten minutes early, you’re ten minutes late!”

I asked John if he could give me a ride but he declined because he had somewhere to get to. I wasn’t upset or anything, it was only a ten minute walk from the house and I was excited to give Debbie Lynn a call. 

I reached in the pack of smokes but noticed only a few cigarettes were in there and also a note folded up.

I opened it up and John wrote me a letter.

“Brian, you really made a grave mistake joining here. I wanted to warn you but Chuck overheard and I’m fairly convinced he sees and hears more that we notice. I’m really hoping this doesn’t get back to him either. Have you wondered why a lot of adults work here? It’s because he won’t let them quit . He’s let some people go freely but they are far and few in between, And I think he watches them after they go. Every strike he gives you has a worse consequence. I seen someone get mad and quit only to be missing for three weeks. They found his body mutilated in the woods. The police thought some wild animal did it. I watched an employee get a third strike and their car blew up two days later with him and his wife in it. My first strike was horrible, I woke up with claw marks down my chest. Just don’t mess up and hope he lets you freely quit.”

I heard a car honk. I looked up and it was Chuck.

“Hey buddy! Let me give you a ride home.”

“Ah, no thanks.” I put the note back into the pack and stuffed it in my pocket. 

“Please...in fact, I insist.” His smile seemed creepier than normal. “Come on.”

I’m gonna update you guys once I can

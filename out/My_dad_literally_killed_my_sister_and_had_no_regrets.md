When I was in 4th grade I was a quiet kid because my dad at the time had been in and out of jail to take care of me and my older sister. My sister was like my dad‘s fucking prized possession that no one dared to touch she would always be the center of attention everywhere and my dad would never talk about me and my sister didn’t even like me that much for some reason and blamed me for the death of our mother Who literally got hit by a drunk driver when I was 3 months old.
 
Now being older my dad probably just told her to say all that stuff or she would get the same punishment as I did. 

One day, I came home from school really ashamed of myself because I failed a test. it wasn’t even that important but my dad started hitting me and locked me in my closet with no food or water. When my sister came home I was so pissed because her my dad got to go on a shopping spree.

 That was the last time I saw my sister alive. That night I managed to find a way out of my closet and into my bed. A couple of hours later I woke up but it felt strange for some reason like my gut was telling me something was wrong when I just went to go get a honey bun.

 That morning at like 9am I want to go watch SpongeBob in my basement because I didn’t wanna wake up my dad. When I got downstairs. Ugh I got downstairs and I saw my sisters dead body I don’t even think I can explain it on Reddit without getting this taken down. I still question myself why I went to that godforsaken basement. I was screaming so loud until I lost my voice.

 I don’t remember much other than my dad rushing in the room calling 911 and the police is doing lots of investigation. After that, The abuse stopped and me and my dad got closer because we also moved from North Carolina to Colorado. 


Fast forward to when i was 17 I was just about to go to bed when I got that same gut feeling I got seven years back. I needed to get a charger from my dad‘s room to charge my iPod but then I saw my dad‘s with my sisters dead corpse in his bed. “What the fuck” I yelled in horror that night he told me everything about how lured my sister in the basement choked her with a wet towel and then just started stabbing her with a blade.

 I locked the door and called the police my dad got arrested. In court he was explaining how he admitted to doing it and had no regrets. The reason why he did this was because he wanted to find away to fuck me up for the rest of my life. He was originally going to kill me instead of My sister. 

He originally thought the kill me but realized if he killed me I would only be suffer for like 5 minutes and if he just killed my sister then I would be fucked for the rest of my life. He said he would do it again if he could. 

Now im 28 and feel sick to my stomach just typing this. I hate when I’m walking down the street and I see someone with a shirt with my dad‘s face on it saying. “The devil in disguise” A nickname for my dad that everyone calls him. My sister literally died in the hands of my “father” due to favoritism I just want nothing to do with my father anymore because he was a disgusting monster that deserved to be in jail for the rest of his life and get jumped 4 times.

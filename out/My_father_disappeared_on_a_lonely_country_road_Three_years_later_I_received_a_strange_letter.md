The address was written in a shaky hand and the envelope smelled like hospital. There was no return address.

But it was my name on the letter, no doubt about that. 

It shouldn’t have been possible. Ever since I moved away from my hometown, I’d done everything in my power to be untraceable. Deleted all social media, kept my address and phone number unlisted. When I met new people, I avoided any reference to my past: 

*“Oh, I grew up in a small town in Kentucky. Not much to tell, really.”*

After my father disappeared, our neighbors turned their backs on us. At first it’d been the casserole parade and hugs all around, but as time went on they began to avoid us–as though our family’s bad luck might rub off on anyone who came too close. It was our fault, somehow, for tainting their lives with a tragedy they didn’t want to think about. And who would?

Imagine that a loved one backs out of the driveway and never comes back. All that’s left behind is their car, abandoned in pristine condition on a road they took to work every day. 

Just gone, without a shred of evidence left behind. 

I couldn’t blame the people in my hometown for preferring not to think about something like that…but I didn’t exactly want to reconnect with them, either.  And the anonymous letter in my hand gave me the nasty sensation that I’d been *found.*

The message was simple:

*We’ve never met, but  I think I might have some information of interest to you. It’s about your father, Martin Hawkins. I’ll be at the Railway Diner at the corner of 6th and Water St. on the third Saturday of each month from 7:00 PM until 9:00 PM. I’ll leave a red notebook on the table in front of me.* 

*This sounds ridiculous, I know. Like something out of a cheesy spy novel. I’m sorry for the secrecy, really I am, but you’ll understand more when we talk. If we talk. I can promise you that I’ll be there every month for a year. That’s how important this is to me.* 

Of course I went. With a message like that, how could I not? Besides, it was hard to imagine a more safe or public place: the Railway was always packed, but even more so on weekends–and there was a police station one block away. 

The woman had a crumb-covered pie plate, a half-finished coffee, and a red pocket notebook on the formica table in front of her. She’d chosen the booth at the very back of the diner, near the restroom. From there, she could see all the rest coming and going. I slid into the booth across from her. It *had* felt like a cheesy spy novel, at first…but now it felt like a shakedown or a scam.

Because the woman across from me had the scabby, skull-like face of a hard-drug user. She could’ve been the poster girl for *“Meth: Not Even Once.”* 

“Hi Alex,” she greeted me with a thin smile. Maybe she was nervous. Maybe she just didn’t want to show what the drugs had done to her teeth. Maybe both. 

“Hi.” I replied. I wondered if she’d attack me if I just stood up and left. As if she could read my thoughts, she grabbed my wrist with a skeletal hand.

“Please don’t go.” She took a deep breath, and spoke a phrase I was sure she’d repeated many times over. “Okay…so…my name is Hailey, and I’m an addict. As part…as part of my program, my Sponsor thinks I should help the people I’ve hurt over the years get closure…”

“How did you find me?” I interrupted, not at all comfortable that this woman knew where I lived.

“Well, I mean, you’re listed on the website of the company you work for…” I inwardly cursed the HR department, I’d have to have a talk with them on Monday. “At first I didn’t believe it was really you, that we’d both wound up in the same town after so many years…but you were the right age, and I figured…”

That still didn’t explain how she’d found my address, but I was getting impatient. I cut to the chase: “and you say you have some information about Martin Hawkins?” 

“Well I can’t be *sure.* Everything back then is sort of…*blurry*, you know? The memories sort of swirl together.” Hailey hesitated. “Look, I did a lot of things I’m not proud of back then. I stole from my family until they were literally bankrupt. I sold my body, made videos…” she shuddered. I didn’t like where this was going at all. *What was I about to find out about my father?* 

“After a certain point…” Hailey went on, “I didn’t have anything left to sell. Nothing that anyone would want, anyway, and begging wasn’t enough to pay for the high I needed in those days. Until Cesar, one of the guys who…*managed…*us girls, told me about a way to make some quick cash.

“He said they’d pick me up in a black van. I know how that sounds, but at that point I would’ve done anything, literally *anything,* for a fix. I didn’t care.

“The van was new. It had tinted windows and rental plates. The rear door opened and a voice told me to *GET IN.*

“It was the strangest thing. There were four people inside the rear compartment. The Easter Bunny, Dracula, a Clown, and the Devil. Well, I mean, those were the rubber masks they were wearing. Their black clothes didn’t have tags and they used machines to disguise their voices. 

“They gave me a plastic bag full of expensive clothes, a wig, makeup, and a mirror. They did such a good job getting me ready that I jumped when I looked in the mirror…I didn’t recognize myself. The reflection looking back at me was an innocent high-class teenager, not…” she gestured to her ruined face, “...*this.* They dropped me off along the side of a two-lane road and told me to get a car to stop. A car with just one passenger.

“The masked ones hid themselves in the trees. The van drove off. I stuck my thumb out and tossed my hair–it’s not like it was the first time. A lot of cars just passed me by…but not all of them.

“I don’t remember the driver too well. A middle-aged white guy with brown hair. I do remember the *feeling,* though. The feeling of trying to invent a story, trying to keep him distracted while those masked people crept up from the woods. They moved so slowly, silently, on all fours like alligators…I could tell they’d done this before.

“I told the guy my jealous boyfriend had just abandoned me out here. That he’d taken my phone and I was scared, I just needed a ride to the next town…as soon as he unlocked the door, they struck. The masked ones dragged him out of the car, gagged him, put a bag over his head…then the van circled back around. They threw him in the back and pulled me in, too. He grunted and squirmed, but the bonds were strong. They didn’t say a word. Just stared at me. The bunny, the clown, dracula, and the devil.

“When we got back to town, they gave me an envelope with $200, cash. They said they’d pick me up again at the same time and place next month.

“The clothes and wigs were always different. So were the places: a gas station, a rest area, a state highway, a parking lot in a city far away…the only thing that stayed the same was the target: a car with a single driver. That *never* changed.”

“So you think,” I began, “That my father was a target of this…this…” I couldn’t even find words for what Hailey had just described. 

“I can’t be sure,” Hailey nodded, “but when I saw the photo in the newspaper article…he looked familiar.” 

My stomach lurched. The din and warm lights of the Railway Diner suddenly felt very far away. “And what happened to them? The people who *you* helped to capture?”

“I never saw any of them again.” Hailey took a deep breath. “I ODed six months ago and woke up in the hospital. Got put into a State-run detox program. Otherwise…I’d probably still be working for those masked people in the black van.”

“That’s it?!” I slammed my fist into the formica table. “Why would you tell me this? What does this solve for me?!”

Hailey recoiled as though I’d struck her. “I don’t…I didn’t…I just thought you should know. My Sponsor said–”

“Your sponsor?!” I raged, “for all I know all this is just some bad trip you had! None of this helps me at all!” 

Hailey got quiet. “You’re right. Of course you’re right. This was a mistake. I should go.” Hailey grabbed her red notebook, got shakily to her feet, wrapped a too-large coat around her bony frame and threw two crumpled $5 bills onto our table. 

Seconds later, I realized what my outburst had cost me. Hailey was the only person who might have information about these kidnappings, apart from the perpetrators themselves–and I was letting her walk out the door…

Into the dark alley parking lot…

Where a black van was idling.

I saw its reflection in the polished diner window, but by the time I pushed my was past the waitresses, the cashier line, and the obese family blocking my exit, it was too late. 

As I squeezed past the bulk of the bellowing mother-of-three in the doorway, I caught a glimpse of a man in black clothes and a rabbit mask grabbing Hailey’s arms. A clown and a devil heaved her into the darkness inside the van.

By the time I reached my car, the black van had disappeared around a corner. And although I circled the nearby neighborhoods for an hour, all while making a confused call to the police–I never saw the black van again. 

Which means that now, just like Hailey, I have no proof of my story. 

I still don’t know what to make of it. It’s clear to me that now that the kidnappings happened: regardless of whether they involved my father or not, *some people* were obviously taken. As to for what purpose or by whom, I have no idea. All I’m left with is a warning. 

Be careful who you trust, help, or try to take advantage of. Beware of odd hours and lonely places. And if you see a suspicious black van or four figures in rubber masks–

Please, send me a letter.

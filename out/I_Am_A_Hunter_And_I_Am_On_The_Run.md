Hello, my name is Sam. It’s my real name you can check my school records if someone would ask for it. Well currently I am on the run, not from police but with someone whom I made a deal and I guess most of us know who makes a deal. So I am on the run and surprisingly enough I brought this second....actually third hand laptop selling in one of the alley...so you know who well it might work. I want to tell my story before he catches me or the laptop gives up. I am a hunter...I don’t hunt animals of course, I hunt demons, monsters, creatures, spirits and sometimes insane humans and I also investigate these stuff. I wanted to be a pilot though when I was a kid but life never ends the way one plans. I want to start this at the beginning about how I become like this.

Everything is linked to my childhood, I was a normal boy in a lovely family and I had a little sister and she was the most beautiful thing that happened to me. I remember when she was born I was the first to hug the doctor even before my father...so yeah I loved her. I was born into a normal family and I never had a paranormal incident before that day. I was a normal kid going to school and everything was fine.

I remember it was raining that day, there was a alert on news so the school and offices were closed. I was 10 back then and my sister was 4. We were sitting in my room, she was playing with her blocks and toys and I was playing with her. I went to look in window to see how long will it rain but the clouds were not wanting to leave and it was really dark there. My eyes went to my lawn and there was a strange man standing there, his head was completely shaven and he a had a little tint of blue on his skin. He was looking at my house just looking when my eyes went to his face and strangely I noticed that his skin was more blue than it was...what color normal skins have. But his eyes, it still send shivers down my spine. He looked at me and our eyes met for a second but I could tell he was not a human, his eyes were pitch black, deep like a never ending void but something were screaming inside them, thousands of souls screaming behind those eyes when he suddenly smirked at me. I was frozen to my place for a second but I immediately ran for my sister who was just behind me. She was still playing and I took a deep breath relaxing my muscles. I looked at the window again but the man was gone.  

My sister and I played for another fives minutes when I heard a scream from the basement, my mom was washing clothes there while my dad was fixing the only source of light there. I ran down to the basement it was my father, small pieces of glasses were on floor while my dad was holding his face blood spilling out from where his eyes was supposed to be my mother crying holding his hands. Glass went into both his eyes and just like that in a single day my father lost his vision I went up to bring him a first aid box when I saw it blood was slipping from the the stairs, my thought immediately went to my sister I ran up the stairs and there were pieces laying on the floor to my room where my sister was...it was small pieces of flesh, I was stopping my tears from rolling down slowly walking to my room preparing myself for what I might see. I opened the door the whole room was colored in blood and my sister was no where to be found the window was open and there was something inscribed on my desk with nails ‘אראה אותך’ went I went to the basement to see my parent they vanished to and the whole room was covered in blood. I was left alone that day and since then I have been studying about everything paranormal as well as how to protect myself. I found the meaning of the note few years after the incident. It was written in herbrew and it said ‘be seeing you’...

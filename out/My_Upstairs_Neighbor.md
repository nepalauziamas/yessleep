I live in an apartment. 


Everyone besides the people on the top floor wonder what the sounds coming from their upstairs neighbors are. I don't have to wonder, the only sound that I ever hear, is laughter.


Never a footstep, the movement of furniture or the life-interupting explosion of something falling to the floor. It's a laugh of pure joy, Deep and hearty. He laughs like he's with friends but I never hear anyone else. 


One night, I was watching TV and we laughed at the same time. It felt like we were laughing at the same joke. I smiled...the first time it happened.


The next day, he laughed at the same time as me, twice. I figured we were watching the same channel. I flipped to a streaming service and turned on a horror movie. During one jump scare, I hear him yell.


I am really creeped out so I'm trying to watch happy programing. I'm not laughing anymore but he's still laughing at things I would have laughed at. 


The laughter lasts longer each time he does it. Every now and then, the laughter is accompanied by the sound of slapping on his floor. Its loud enough that it makes me jump, everytime. 


I am not the type to confront a neighbor about anything but I can't do nothing. I talk to the building manager. He tells me that unit is being renovated and there shouldn't be anyone up there. He asks me to call him right away if I hear it again.


I walk into booming, maniacal laughter as I enter my apartment. I call the building manager and hold my phone towards the ceiling. The building manager says he'll check it out.


A few minutes later the laughter stops. I hear the faint sound of footsteps across the floor. The laughter starts again. I hear a giant crash. The laughter pierces through the floor, like the squatter is right next to me.


Something heavy is now being dragged. I grab a hammer, dial 911 and run towards the stairwell. My building manager was up there because of me, if he was in trouble, I had to try to help him.


I reach the door, it's shut. I put my phone in my pocket and knock...


"Cooome in!" The hearty voice beckons like it's welcoming an expected friend.


I open the door and hold it in front of me like a sheild, I peak inside. There is nothing in the apartment aside from a petite, naked woman with long black hair. She is in the middle of the room, on her toes with her ear to a glass on the floor. Her body and neck are controrted into impossible angles. She is looking right at me, she is smiling.


She laughs, the deep, hearty laugh that I had associated with joy...and a man. I could now see it was the proud roar of madness.


She smashes the glass on the floor and starts chewing on the shards. Each skull shattering crunch reverberates through my body. I can feel it, like foil on my teeth. She doesn't break eye contact. She chokes, blood oozes from the corners of her mouth, the laughter resumes. 


I run back to the stairwell; she is right behind me. She runs on her knuckles and is still on her toes. She is surprisingly fast. I get down the stairwell and to my apartment door just before she does. I make it inside and lock the door.


She is clawing and snarling, choking... laughing. I pull the couch over to the door and lay on it. I haven't spoken to emergency services but they've been on the phone this whole time, they should be here soon.


I pull my phone out, blurt out my location and do my best to explain the situation. The woman on the other end assures me that the police are already on the way then starts to laugh.


A deep, hearty...joyful laugh.

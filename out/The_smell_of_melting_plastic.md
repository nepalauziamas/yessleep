I used to work at an old toy factory but I recently quit thanks to this one incident. I was working late at night with a few of my other coworkers. When one of them approached me mark I think his name was. He was my friend but now he’s fading away with all the other events that took place that night. He started talking but I wasn’t paying attention I had to handle some very fragile toys I had no time to drop them with the fear of getting fired. Then one of the things he said caught my attention. I told him to repeat what he had said. He told me he had found a dismembered arm in the tank of plastic.

I stared at him it was hard for me to process I dropped the toy I was holding. It landed straight on my foot I yelled a swarm of profanity’s. I cleaned it up then asked him did he tell the boss yet. He told me no it just happened but he thought he had to tell me. I looked at him in that moment he seemed like a complete idiot. I left then went to the bosses office.

On the way there I couldn’t tell if it was just me but on the way there everyone seemed to have fake eyes. Sorta like doll eyes everything else seemed totally fine. I finally reached his office I opened the door. A horrible smell filled the hall I entered it seemed to smell like melted plastic. I looked around i stepped in something it was boiling hot I jumped back in pain. I fell on the desk it broke into pieces i laid there. I was in pain all over. I looked over at the doorway I saw mark in shock his face pale like he had just seen a ghost and he was looking at me. I stared at him until I blacked out I woke up near a conveyer belt.

I looked to my left I saw mark staring at me he told me he called 911 and said the would be here soon. I told him I was fine and that I had just burned my foot and broke a desk. He then told me that it didn’t look like it. I guess I looked confused because he told me to look at my leg. I looked down and instantly got sick. 

My leg was broken with bits of hard plastic around it. On my foot there was a huge blister and bits of my skin was boiling. I wasn’t surprised about my foot but I wondered why my leg was broken. I looked around no one else was here. I asked were our coworkers are he told me he doesn’t know it’s like they disappeared. I asked him when will the police get here he told me they said in ten minutes. He then told me he would be back he had to find the boss. I looked around the factory was well lit so I wasn’t scared.

But that was only a few minutes I then heard a blood curdling scream I knew it was mark. I dragged myself to were the scream came from when I found him he was lying on the floor covered in hot boiling plastic the last word he said was run. But I couldn’t move I had used the last of my strength in hopes of saving him. I lay beside him the smell of burning flesh moving throughout my nose. I looked at his face he was gone. Then I blacked out then I awoke to police sirens and an ambulance. I opened my eyes I was in the back of an ambulance. I couldn’t talk and I couldn’t move I had nothing left. A lady told me that I’ll be fine and to stay awake.

I did stay awake until we got to the hospital. Before they took me inside I took a glance around then I saw it. Mark standing at the end of the road his body covered in hardened plastic only one of his arms and his face was visible. His arm was all kinds of messed up.

The skin on it was peeling of and huge blisters ran down it. Then I blacked out. When I awoke I was in a wheelchair with a cast on my foot. They told me the plastic was deep in my foot and leg. I was surprised I saw no plastic in my foot. They then asked me did the boss dislike any of us. I told him no. They then told me they reviewed the camera footage and they saw the boss staring at the camera then walked away. They then saw me enter the office the boss was behind the door the melted plastic was on the floor they then described each devastation but with the boss causing each one.

I was shocked to say the least but I mentioned one thing to them and they were a bit shocked too. I told them how mark looked then mentioned he was behind them reaching towards us then my eyes rolled out and was replaced with eyes of a porcelain doll and I smiled as the blood sprayed everywhere and their screams filled the hall.

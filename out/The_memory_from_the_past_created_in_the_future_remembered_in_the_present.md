I was tortured in the past for something I will do in the future

Let me explain…..

I was in bed, ready to fall asleep when I started remembering something I don’t remember remembering before.. I was walking home from my first job after closing up for the night when I was pulled into an alleyway by a masked man. I remember trying to scream for help but he punched me in the stomach and told me to shut up. 

I remember reaching into my pocket, taking out my wallet and begging him to take it from me so he wouldn’t hurt me but he said he wasn’t after my money. He was after me

“Me?” I thought. “Why me? I don’t know you” I asked

“Not yet you don’t but future you does”

“Future me? What are you on about?”

“You did something in the future to really piss me off, now I’m getting payback”

“This guy’s crazy” I thought

“Future? Yeah right”

I tried to stand up but he pulled a knife out of his back pocket and pointed it at me

“Move and I’ll kill you”

I stayed on the ground, confused

“So what did future me do to you then?”

“Can’t say or it won’t happen”

“Well if I did something to piss you off in the future, wouldn’t you want me to know what I did so I can avoid doing whatever it is I did to piss you off”

“Sure but that’s boring”

“So how did you get here then?”

By the way, I still thought this guy was crazy at this stage. I was just playing along to buy time and think of an escape

“This”. He rolled up his sleeve and showed me what looked like a watch

“A watch?”

“Not just a watch. A time travel watch”

“Okay then. Prove it”

I expected him to make up an excuse but he grabbed my wrist, said “1990” and then there was a flash of light. We were still in the same alleyway as before but it was a bit different. He told me to get up and follow him and when we were out of the alleyway, everything looked like it didn’t belong in the year 2018. 

“This is 1990. See, proof”. 

“This is real” I thought

He dragged me back into the alley and spoke to his watch

“2018” 

There was a flash of light and then we were back in the alleyway only this time it looked how it did before

“How far in the future do we meet?”

“About 10 years from now”

“When was time travel invented?”

“About 6 years from now”

“Why haven’t we seen proof of time travel?”

“You have. Ever heard of the Mandela affect?”

“Yeah”

“That was the creators of time travel experimenting”

“Experimenting?”

“Yes. You remember Looney Tunes being spelled “Looney T O O N S” correct? But it’s actually spelled “T U N E S?”

“Yes. Well it was originally spelled T O O N S but one of the creators traveled back in time, pitched the idea of it being spelled T U N E S and then it was changed. That’s why you remember it that way”

“I still don’t understand”

“When something is changed in the past, everyone in the present still remembers how things were originally in the past even though the thing had changed” 

“I’m still confused”

“Future yous won’t be though. Now, back to what I came here for”

He pulled out the knife on me again. 

“Woah woah, let’s talk about this”

“No”

First he kicked me in the head

“Please, let’s talk about this”

“Shut up”. He kicked me again.

Then he sat on me, lifted up my shirt and carved the word “cunt” on my stomach. I never remembered seeing a scar that resembled the word “cunt”, but when I lifted up my shirt to take a look, it was there. In big capital letters, carved into my stomach were the letters “C U N T”. 

Then he grabbed me by the shirt and pinned me against the wall. He placed the knife to my face and carved a penis shape into my cheek. That was never there before but when I took out my phone and switched to my front camera, there was a scar that resembled a penis.

Then he spent a few minutes beating me. I sat up against the wall, covered in blood.

“Wh-why now?” I asked

He didn’t reply and then spoke clearly into his watch “2031”. There was a flash of light and the man was gone. 

I stayed sitting there against the wall all night in pain, confused and trying to wrap my head around how all this time travel bullshit worked but never could. It was only that night, the night I remembered when I figured it out. The events of the memory were happening live as I was remembering them, just a few years in the past. The reason I never noticed those scars was because I didn’t have them until that night. 

Whoever he is, whatever I did to him must’ve been bad for him to do this to me. I guess I’ll just have to make sure not to piss anyone off anytime soon, or ever.

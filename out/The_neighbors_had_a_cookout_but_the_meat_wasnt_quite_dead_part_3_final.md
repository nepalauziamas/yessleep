I leaned forward and poked Aiden in the forehead. He didn't move. I don't know why I did that. Maybe I just thought I should be the one to make the first move. We heard the key turning in the front door. What would the father think when he saw all this?

Aiden took a step forward. His movements were a bit stiff, as if something inhabited his body that wasn't used to having limbs that long. I took a step back but he reached forward very quickly and placed his hands on either side of my head. Thiago moved forward to stop him. Aiden began to squeeze. He was way stronger than any human should be. I screamed. The father's footsteps had moved into the kitchen but he must have seen what happened because he stopped moving for a split second.

He reacted faster than I expected. Thiago had jumped on Aiden's shoulders and was trying to pry his arms off of me. Even Ariel was throwing his mother's shoes at Aiden, although he kept hitting Thiago instead. Greta, oddly enough, appeared paralyzed with fear. It was the first time I had seen her with no idea what to do.

What happened next hit me like a bucket of ice water. Probably because the father had just thrown a bucket of ice water onto Aiden and me. He had no time to prepare it. He must have walked into the house carrying it. But it accomplished what Thiago and Ariel could not. Aiden dropped me. He collapsed, weirdly sliding off of Eli's mangled corpse and convulsing at the foot of the stairs. I stumbled back and shook my head. I was still in intense pain, but I could think straight, and Aiden hadn't held on long enough to break any bones. With any luck, there would be no lasting damage.

Jasmine came forward. I thought she wanted to touch Eli's body but instead she grabbed Aiden by the arms and pulled. She was trying to move him to the center of the room so he could at least lie flat on the floor. Thiago understood and picked him up by the feet. Aiden was spasming and making weird choking sounds. I looked at the father, who stood there with a still-dripping bucket in his hands. He was short and bald, only a few inches taller than Ferdinand. Evidently he knew something about the threat we faced. 

"Are you guys okay?" he asked.

"I'm fine," said Thiago.

"I wasn't talking to you," said the father.

"We're okay," said Ariel. "The meat, it almost got Nando, but--"

"I choked," said Ferdinand, shifting from foot to foot. I recognized that body language. It was the same way I acted when I was a boy and didn't want my parents to know what I had done. Ferdinand was inventing a cover story. "I was eating this meat I found in the fridge and--"

"You didn't find any meat in the fridge," said the father. "It's the special stuff. Gary down at the corner store, he's always trying to get me to buy it. I was down there right now. I got him to tell me how to kill it. He said he sold it to somebody on this street. That's why I have this." He held up the bucket.

Greta descended the stairs and stood before the father. Her body language had changed completely. She could barely make eye contact with him. "I am so sorry," she said. "Your son, he almost died."

The father nodded. I could tell he was dealing with some complicated emotions right now. My friends with kids tell me that nothing forces you to grow up like becoming a parent. For the first time in your life, somebody else is more important than you are. So I have no idea what I could say to somebody who just lost a child. Fortunately, this man had not lost a child. But he had come within a hair's breadth. 

"We need to get it out of him," he said, motioning to Aiden. "He's still in there."

"How do we do that?" asked Jasmine.

"We make him really cold," he said. 

Several of us lifted Aiden up and carried him to the bathroom, laying him fully clothed in the tub. The father went back out to the car, bringing several bags of ice in with him. He really had come prepared. The bathroom was barely big enough to hold all of us, so most of us merely waited at the door as he and Greta filled the bathtub with cold water and dumped bag after bag of ice into it. We all stood watching. The convulsions stopped. Aiden went still. For a good ten minutes, nothing happened. He was completely immersed in the water yet showed no signs of drowning. Then he lurched upright like somebody rising from the grave.

Aiden placed both hands on the side of the tub and leaned over it. The father placed a bucket in front of him and Aiden vomited into it. Except he didn't just vomit, but expelled the meat from his mouth, nose and even tear ducts. It lasted about thirty seconds. How much had he eaten, and how long had it stayed inside him? At last, he stopped and looked up.

"I'm cold," he said. Jasmine and Greta helped him out of the tub. He was shaky but able to walk if he leaned on them. They led him out of the house and back to his and Greta's, presumably to get him changed out of his wet clothes and warmed up again.

Jasmine returned a few minutes later. She had an idea as to what to do with Eli's body. Some of us tried to talk her out of it, but she insisted it was the best cover story. After prying the gun out of his mouth, we backed his and Jasmine's car into the narrow alley between Greta's house and mine and loaded his body into the driver's seat. It was dark by now. Jasmine got into the passenger's seat and reached over, working the steering wheel as we pushed the car out into the street. Then she fastened her seatbelt and we stepped back. She put the car in drive, dropped a rock on the gas pedal and twisted the steering wheel so that the car slammed into a large tree going way faster than the speed limit. Eli's body went flying through the windshield. She told the paramedics that he had simply been driving recklessly and lost control of the car. Her injuries were relatively minor. Brave woman.

Greta is moving out. She told my  fiancée that in her own way, she felt responsible for what happened. Maybe. I saw Aiden sitting out on his front porch not too long after Eli's funeral. He wasn't just staring into space anymore, but playing a game on his phone. I waved and he waved back. I think he is doing a little better now, but I don't think he's ready to look for another job yet.

I talked to the father yesterday. He, Greta, and Jasmine went to the corner store and confronted Gary. They won't tell me exactly what happened, but Gary doesn't work there anymore. I suppose he should be glad that's all that happened to him. We still don't know where the meat came from, but we can hope that he won't go distributing it to anyone else. I don't know what the father told his wife. She seems oddly distant, and I have a suspicion that he has done most of the work in raising their kids. Either way, Ariel and Ferdinand seem fine. They took Ferdinand to the hospital immediately after exorcising Aiden and found nothing foreign in his lungs or stomach. But all things considered, the father is doing a pretty good job processing everything that happened.

Oh yeah, and when I called him "sir", he just laughed. "Call me Ferdinand," he said. We were chatting in his driveway.

"Really?" I said. "I had no idea your son was a junior."

"He doesn't like it when I call him that," said Ferdinand Sr. "So I'm just 'Dad' and he's just 'Ferdinand'."

"Well, as long as it's not 'Nando'," I said. "He really hates that."

Maybe we will go for a hike sometime and maybe not. It still bugs me that Gary is out there somewhere. Sometimes I think you can't really change bad people so much as just teach good people to recognize dangerous people and avoid them. There is no guarantee that Gary won't give out that meat to somebody else again, but I feel that my own neighborhood is a little bit safer now. We were able to kill the meat that had gotten into Ferdinand just by keeping it frozen for a long time. My  fiancée  and I are talking about where we will live after the wedding. I've told her that we should look for another place in this neighborhood. She [agrees](https://www.reddit.com/user/_Cu_Chulainn17).

His name was Eric Jameson, and he saved Stragview from the Riot of 2017.

Eric Jameson, Officer Jameson, was probably the nicest guy you'd ever meet. He was a career officer, a man who had forgotten more about corrections than most of us ever know. His appearance was vaguely Chinese or maybe Korean. He always wore his hair in one of those buns, his windows peek never touching the thick gray main on the top. He always reminded me of the uncle from the Avatar cartoon in the way he spoke and carried himself. 

I got to work with him on my first night flying solo on the compound, and it was an experience I wouldn't trade for anything. When you walked with him through the quad, it was as though the clouds lifted away from the sun. Inmates smiled more, officers were less surly, and everyone was just in a better mood when Jameson was around. He was personable, remembering inmates' names and asking about their troubles. He passed five times as much time in the quads as any other officer I'd ever known, a practice that would have gotten anyone but Jameson dragged into the Investigators' Office under speculation of Inmate collusion. Jameson did the same to his fellow officers, and I never saw anyone snap or take a surly tone with Jameson. He was knowledgeable, sharing his wisdom willingly, and the way he walked amongst his charges was utterly devoid of fear or care. He walked through the quad as though it were his home, and the inmates were no more than his neighbors whom he was greeting on his way home from work. 

This was not a skill he had gained from years of experience, though.

Jameson had a way about him that was undeniable.

Jameson had a vibration about him that broke up tension.

It was an ability I got to see firsthand.

About a year after I started with the department, we had a significant disturbance in F dorm. What had started as a skirmish between rival gangs had devolved into a fight that threatened to bathe the whole quad in blood. It all came to a head at lunchtime. The two gangs had taken advantage of the other inmates leaving and took the opportunity to privately air their grievances. We were poised to roll into the dorm with force. Blood and weapons were already present in the quad when Jameson stepped into the corridor. The Captain was just finishing up a blistering speech designed to prep us for the coming scuffle when Jameson walked through the door and stepped inside. Twenty or so men looked at him, their faces covered in a veneer of readiness, and their resolve melted away before we could take a step towards the door. He spoke to the two groups for less than a minute before both were ready to end hostilities and submit to the officers in the hallway. Jameson came out of the quad with a peaceful smile stretched across his old young face.

"They're ready to comply, Captain," he said, his voice a gentle river.

That was when I felt it. It was like when someone hits a tuning fork, and you feel like you can feel those vibrations on your skin, in your teeth, and in your gray matter as they wash over you. This was like that, except it was more like gentle wind chimes or soft temple bells. I saw it wash over the others in the hallway, and a general atmosphere of calm permeated us all. Even the Captain, who had been ready to spit nails when Jameson had walked onto that quad, smiled and clapped the grandfatherly fellow on the shoulder as he admonished him for his efforts.

I saw Jameson later as he came out of the area next to the captain's office that held the snack machines and asked him what had happened out there?

Jameson smiled, "Oh, just years of know-how at work. It's all about knowing what to say and when. You'll pick it up too, little brother."  

I shook my head, my body wanting to smile and agree with him as his proximity made me feel at ease again.

"No, I mean the thing that happened when you walked into the hallway. I heard a kind of...chime?" I tried lamely. I couldn't properly describe the emotion because it wasn't something I had ever felt before. The others seemed to accept it, almost seemed to welcome the feeling of ease that wafted around Jameson like a fog. I, on the other hand, wanted some answers. I wasn't one to just accept things as they were, and I hoped this was something he was aware of. If it wasn't, I was about to sound very crazy to someone I respected. 

Jameson smiled, chuckling a little in the face of my confusion.

"You're a little more pragmatic than the others I see. Yes, I suppose you could call it a tone. Since I was young, I've had it. A kind of aura that creates peaceful feelings in those around me. It's a gift I often use around here."

I was astonished, "You mean, you have this gift for bringing peace to those around you, and you use it in prison?"

He took a chip and chewed in speculative as though thinking about how he would answer that question.

"When I was thirteen, I thought I might use this ability to become a diplomat or a politician. If I could bring peace to those around me, I could be an asset to those in trying situations. I soon realized, though, that positions like that were out of my reach without a rich family to back me. I thought about training to be an actor, someone who could affect change just by the nature of celebrity. That was another path that was closed to me, however. The climate at that time was no kind to Asian Immigrants, even those not hailing from Japan. I then considered the Army, maybe I could do some good as an officer, and someone with my skill set could be useful on the battlefield. The Vietnam war was raging, and it was far better to enlist than to be drafted. I joined, served my time, but I never made it onto the battlefield. Instead, I was sent to a navy vessel and told to cook, something I was good at. I slung hash for the next eight years and retired with a pension and an unfulfilled ideal."

As he told his tale, I could almost imagine the younger man he had been. He had been full of ideas and hopes, just like me, and he felt dissatisfied by the world at large. He had a talent, but the world didn't see fit to use that talent. Sometimes, it seems like the world makes things harder for itself.

"I confided in an officer while aboard the USS Copeland that I had a gift for making people calm. He laughed until I proved it by calming a group of tired flightmen who were milling about the landing zone. They went from scowling and mumbling to smiling and going about their tasks with purpose within seconds of me having talked to them. He asked how this could be possible, and I told him about the strange aura I had held since childhood. However, the Officer told me that my best bet would be to keep this ability to myself. I would likely be thrown out as a loonie, or, worse, kept in a lab somewhere and experimented on if they believed me."

He sighed and seemed to stare off into space, reliving those glory days.

"So there I was, twenty-six, unemployed, and looking for the next place to use my talent. I considered a career in medicine, but I didn't have the memory or the stomach for it. I considered law enforcement, but my academy scores were never good enough to qualify. Corrections, on the other hand, decided that they would take me gladly. That was seventy-six, and a man with no family and an open schedule could find all the work he wanted with the department. I signed on with Stragview, and I've been here for nearly thirty years."

"Yeah," I cut in, "but why?"

Jameson looked across the yard, taking in the dorms and the chainlink and seeming to miss it already.

"Did you know that while I have been here, uses of force have declined by forty-five percent from the years previous to my hiring? When I am on shift, the need for physical force is at an all-time low. This prison sits on a nexus, son. I'm sure you've noticed some strange things around here?" he said, eyes twinkling a little in the moonlight.

Thinking back on it, I had indeed seen some strange things within the walls of Stragview. 

Sometimes some unexplainable things. 

"If my presence here can cause even one Officer to leave in his car as opposed to an ambulance, then my time here has been well spent. I do not consider my talents squandered here, quite the contrary. I think this is where they might be best served."

I always found that profound when I looked back on it.

I did before that night, at least.

Six months ago, Officer Jameson told me he was retiring.

I was on inside by that point. The Captain liked to have me on his yard team. I was going to pick up his count slips when he gave me the good news. 

"Next month will mark thirty years of service with the department. After thirty years, I think I might be ready for some much overdue rest."

I asked him how he meant to spend his retirement, and he told me about a piece of property he owned with a fish pond and a hunting lease. He intended to hunt, fish, care for his garden, and maybe even write his memoirs about his time in the war and his time with DOC. He seemed happy when he spoke of these things, and I was happy for him. He seemed pleased at the prospect of rest, and I wished him joy of his newfound freedom.

By the end of the month, he was gone, and we settled into life without Jameson at Stragview Prison.

When I arrived at work the next day, the change was immediate. The air around Stragview had always been heavy, the place seemed almost Lovecraftian at times, and an air of oppression seemed to roll in with the fog most mornings. Today, though, it seemed different. It felt like it might rain at any minute, and it was the first time I had ever thought about just climbing back in my truck and driving home.

We used force that night.

It was the ugly kind of force that you use on desperate men.

His name was Daffin, and it all started because he was hungry. Like many inmates, Daffin decided to sneak a second tray from the food line. Officer Wilde stopped him on the way through the chow hall and told him to give up the tray. Inmate Daffin explained that he had paid for this extra tray, not uncommon in prison economics, but Wilde was hearing none of it. He snatched the tray and told Daffin to take his ass to his table and not treat him like some rookie.

Daffin responded by punching Officer Wilde in the face.

Officer Wilde responded by breaking his jaw and nearly kicking off the first chow hall riot I had ever seen. We got them calmed down, and Daffin went to the infirmary while Wilde went home. I had seen violence on the compound before, but this was the closest I had ever seen to it coming off the rails. Tensions remained high for the rest of the night, but I would soon discover that the chow hall incident was just an overture.

The week after that, the outbreak started.                  

The previous week had been hard. Four stabbings, three fights, three assaults on staff, and two attempted suicides had made it the longest weekend I could remember. Daffin had gone to the hospital in the midst of it, his jaw rebreaking when he tried to break up one of the fights, and when they called me in on Monday, my first day off, I was not happy. I wasn't alone though, most of my shift was called in to lock down two of our open bay dorms. Daffin had come back from the hospital with something, and it had spread like wildfire in twelve hours. We were never sure if it was flu or what, but it made them cough and snot and acted more like pneumonia than anything.

After the fifth inmate had to be rushed to the hospital, they put a third dorm on lockdown.

After the first death, they put nearly all the dorms on lockdown.

The only two dorms not on lockdown by the end of the month were H and F Dorm. This was only because they were under too high a security level to get close to the infected inmates, which worked against them this time. They became responsible for cooking the meals, packed in styrofoam, and trucked down to the dorm. These were men with no experience in the kitchen, and as the quality of the food began to slip, the quarantine dorms began to make more and more noise. We were living in a powder keg, and a single spark would be all it would take to blow us all to kingdom come.

That spark came on the night of the Riot.

I had just got on shift when the call about the fight came down. Two officers from the previous shift were sent to help the dorm officer quell the disturbance. After I got my equipment, I headed that way to see if they needed help. When the sirens went off, I knew something terrible had gone down. I could see the doors of the dorm, and the Inmates were pressed against them as the mag locks held them in place. The Officer in the station had been quick enough to engage the locks, and I could see Creest glancing over his shoulder as he shunted an inmate away from the dorm. You could hear that blatting siren from halfway across the world, so when we got the word that F dorm was also in an uproar, we weren't surprised.

When they came boiling out of the side door like angry cockroaches, that did surprise us a little.

We'd been suited up for breaching, preparing to enter the side door of H dorm and rescue a wounded officer. The six of us were preparing to breach when a mob of howling inmates came spilling out from down the lawn. We would later find out that they had somehow gained access to the station and took the doors off lockdown. At that moment, though, all we could do was fallback for the gate and try to quell the tide.

We spent the better part of the night holding Center Gate. The inmates would push to the gate, attempt to rush us, and fall back after we put a few down. Killing isn't something you know you can do until you've done it, and the sight of those men sprawled out in the grass still haunts me a little. Our usual team, a six-man group that joked and laughed through weekly drills, were not toting empty guns tonight. Every weapon had lethal ammunition, and our goal seemed to be more than the usual "rescue the CO and quell the inmates" scenario.

We had put down another six when someone came to relieve another officer named Hardy and me.

The two of us were taken to the Warden's office, where he sat drinking tea as though this were any other day.

The Warden looked well put together for someone awake in the dead of night. His pinstripe was immaculate, his salt and pepper hair was uniform, and his gold-rimmed glasses were polished to a high gloss. He smiled at us, wolfishly, as we entered, and the smile was wide and toothy. I suddenly had a bad feeling that we were about to be called upon to do something not altogether legal. I didn't like the Warden much. I had only seen him a few times, and every time he had made my stomach turn over. During my interview, as the Assistant Warden and the Captain of my prospective shift had asked me questions, he had just sat there, staring at me. His eyes were predatory, calculating, and it was easy to imagine that he could see right through you as his eye bore into your very soul. He had interrupted the Assistant Warden mid-question to tell him that I had the job, and it had taken everything in my power to reach across and shake that hand.

Now, I wish I'd never taken this job.

"I need you, boys, to go on a little errand for me," he said, glancing over the rim of his cup like a mischievous cat.

I almost fancied that his eyes changed as he spoke.

He gave us directions and sent us out in a state van. As I rode shotgun, I wasn't happy about what we'd been told to do. The Warden wanted us to go to the address and pick up a CO who could help with our current situation. The CO in question was known to all of us. He had been on our shift last month.

"The general tremors around the compound have changed drastically since he left. We need a man of his… "Talents" back at work where he belongs."

We were going to roust Jameson from his much-deserved rest.

The whole trip, I felt very conflicted about this little errand. Jameson had earned the right to his rest, and we were going to drag him back to a place he had only recently escaped. Sometimes I joked with certain inmates that I had another twenty-seven years before my release date, that I was doing a thirty years stent. This made me wonder if, at the end of my time, would they be free to pull me back too? I didn't like the idea of that.

We pulled up in front of his house around three am and found him waiting on the front porch. He had put on his uniform, his hair scooped back into its typical warrior's knot, and he looked utterly at peace. I could feel his tone when I climbed out of the van, a calming breeze that blew across my face, but as we approached, I began to feel a strangeness amongst the notes, a discord that pervaded the tone. He was presenting it for us but was far from committed to the feeling.

"Sergeant Hardy, to what do I owe the pleasure of your company so early in the morning?"

Hardy paused for a moment but pressed on.

"I assume that you know, dressed as you are. I think you were waiting for us."

Jameson smiled placidly.

"Maybe. Maybe I woke up and sensed that my gifts were needed. Regardless, I am ready."

He sat in the back, and I chose to sit with him as Hardy drove. I felt less and less sure about this errand the longer it went on. It almost felt like we were escorting this man to his incarceration, if not execution. He sat, smiling, looking straight ahead as Hardy drove, and I found myself staring at him with ill-ease. He turned his smiling eyes to me, and my unease deepened.

He looked like a man whose mind is at peace with death.

"What's on your mind, son?" he asked.

I shook my head, "I just...I don't feel good about what we're doing. It feels wrong. It feels…"

Suddenly I was assaulted by his calming aura, and it washed over me like a warm bath.

"All will be fine. All is as it should be."

He gripped my hand and squeezed, and I felt at peace all the way back to the compound.

We arrived to find national guard vehicles in the parking lot. They had finally arrived, it seemed, and were preparing to go inside and gain control. We rolled through the front gate onto the compound, taking Jameson in through the front gate. He climbed out of the back, looking around with a sense of homecoming, and we made our way to Center Gate. Jameson floated between us, the picture of composure, but those jangles were still present amongst the calming aura he exuded. We led him, Hardy and I on either side of him, but it was he who truly led us.

When we approached the line at the gate, the Captain nodded at Jameson.

His look was full of something, but at the time, I couldn't place it.

Jameson patted his shoulder and stepped towards the mass of inmates keeping a muddled parameter near the gate, just outside of shotgun range.

"Jameson, what are you doing?" I called out, stepping towards him, "They'll tear you apart."

The Captain stopped me with an outstretched hand, "Let him work. This ain't his first rodeo."

The inmates noticed him and began to move towards him like a swarm of angry bees. He didn't falter in his course, didn't waver, and as they neared, I felt him reach out with that odd tone and give them the full brunt of his power. They charged him, raising clubs and shanks, but staggered as they came within ten feet of the man. They began to sway, began to fall, and as I watched, they all fell to their faces in the grass and placed their hands behind their back. They fell like cordwood, weapons falling from limp fingers, as they lay, smiling, on the grass in placid compliance.

It was at that moment that I understood the terrifying extent of Jameson's power. It was then that I understood why he had never been allowed to be a General, a Politician, a Diplomat, or anything more than a minder of the dregs of society. Had Jameson been a very different man, he could have used his gifts to devastating effect.

There was no way that a just and loving God would have allowed a man to be so tested without corruption.

We spent the next hour putting zip cuffs on inmates as Jameson moved across the compound. We couldn't take him into the dorms, of course. We couldn't risk such a weapon in the confined spaces behind the doors, but it seemed we didn't have to. Just his presence on the yard quelled much of the riot, and we began to receive reports of inmates throwing down their weapons and returning to compliance. As Jameson walked, order began to reassert itself. As Jameson went, so went peace in his wake.

He saved us from a riot that would have taken days to quell.

He saved hundreds of lives, and how did we repay him?

We were on the Rec Yard when it happened. We had cuffed them and were processing inmates on the yard as we tried to regain some normalcy. They identified the instigators, threw the others back into their dorm, and the light of dawn was just beginning to peek above the horizon. The Warden had come out with an armed escort and was overseeing the operation with the Captain, Hardy, and myself. Jameson was continuing to calm the situation, his tone stretching out like an ocean wave, and when he abled over to our group, he was haggard but smiling. It had taken something out of him to use it, and he looked ready to drop.

The Warden extended a hand to Jameson, and he looked as hesitant to shake it as I had been.

"Excellent work, Jameson. We've missed your little gift around here. How would you like to come back? I can see that you're promoted, moved to the admin shift, and put you up somewhere cozy."

Jameson smiled but shook his head, "I don't think so, sir. I'm willing to lend my gifts, now and again, but I've found that I like my retirement."

The Warden feigned a look of regret, "I was afraid you'd say that."

The Captain's shotgun's stock cracked into the back of Jameson's head, and he fell face-first onto the grass.

I had my gun slung around and pointing at them before I could stop myself. The Captain swung the barrel of his shotgun around to cover me, but the Warden shoved it away and stepped between my gun barrel and the group. His eyes did that funny thing again, where they shifted to something almost catlike. He didn't look angry or afraid but was, instead, curious as he studied me with his strange eyes.

"You know what must be done. If he leaves the compound, it will descend back into chaos. So he mustn't be allowed to leave. You know this is the best thing for the prison. A little sacrifice for the good of us all."

I pointed the gun at them, wanting to pull the trigger. If I did, though, I'd have to pull the trigger on myself next. I'd known what was happening here, hadn't I felt it from the beginning? The gun held firm for a count of ten, the Warden standing between us, the Captain looking nervous, Hardy's eyes darting for the best course of escape, but eventually, I dropped my gun barrel and let it hang underneath my arm.

The Warden said to grab him, and so we did.

We took him through the Rec Office and down a flight of stairs I had never seen before.

We came to a door, a big ugly metal thing that opened onto a shadowy corridor that seemed to stretch into the earth. It was lit by small islands of light created by overhead bulbs in small round cages. As we walked, a chorus of the damned yelled from the doors. They wanted food, wanted freedom, wanted death, and wanted to see the sun. We ignored them, and many shrank away when they saw the Warden was with us.

We deposited Jameson into one of these cells. He lay on the floor, breathing shallowly, and I paused in the door to look at him. Were we really about to do this? Were we really going to doom a man to spend his days in this dark hole? Would his gift even reach out from the hellish place?

As the door swung shut, I both hoped it would and prayed it would not.

That was a month ago, and the compound has never been more peaceful. In the wake of the riot, we returned to some semblance of peace, much like the days before the quarantine, but I know the truth. I've thought about quitting a thousand times, thought about putting a gun in my mouth and ending it all, but I always worry that I too might wake up in that lightless void beneath the prison.

So let us never forget Officer Jameson, the savior of our compound.

May his death come swiftly and release him from the hell he now resides in.

May it be enough to grant him the freedom he deserves.

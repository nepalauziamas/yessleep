**Rule #6:** *Should any patron hear a strange growling noise from any arcade, let them know you'll take care of it, get a kit from underneath the manager's desk, and place it behind the arcade game it is coming from.*

This incident I'll tell you about happened nearly 5 months into the job. It happens about 5 or 6 times a month. Some kid was complaining about hearing a low growl from the Frogger arcade. There's kits for each arcade underneath the manager's desk, supposedly containing different foods for different monsters inside each arcade.

They said that they heard the growling after they completed about 5 levels, and it distracted them so much that they ended up failing into a Game Over.

"Don't worry, kid. I'll take care of the problem."

I rushed to the manager's office and asked if I could get something from beneath his desk.

"Rule #6, Danforth?"

"Yes, Rule #6."

"Which arcade?"

"Frogger."

"Just a moment."

I waited about half an hour outside the manager's office. I was bored, so I was about to leave when he came out with the necessary kit.

"Here. Remember to place it directly behind the arcade!"

I rushed over to the Frogger arcade and quickly put the kit behind the arcade. Almost immediately, I thought I saw tentacles just take the kit nearly immediately. I'll admit that this made me jump so much that one of the kids asked me if I was okay.

"I-I'm good. Thanks for your concern, though."

"If you say it all strained like that, Mr. Crabb..."

"Don't worry about me! I'm fine!"

"Too late. I'm already picturing you as a sweat-scented candle!"

I wasn't surprised they said that because they were a teen. But I'm glad they made me smile after this.

**Rule #7:** *If a strange woman's face suddenly shows up at the game where you throw balls at bottles, close it off until the face is gone.*

I had the drive to follow this rule after I saw what happened when a patron actually played it when the face showed up. The face looked a LOT like that of Olivia Newton-John from when she was in *Grease*.

My getting distracted was what caused the effect of what happens if you break this rule. I saw this adult male start playing the game, and he threw two balls without incident.

The face showed up RIGHT AFTER he threw the third ball to topple the third set of plastic bottles. The ball hit the face, and I could not believe what happened.

The face showed a lot of anger. It stuck its tongue out, then opened wide.

The man could hardly believe his eyes. He looked scared.

Luckily, no one else was near the game.

But then, the face just went right off the game and appeared to eat the man whole.

I couldn't believe it. I noted the identity of the patron, closed off the game (we do so by adding the sign and some yellow tape to say it's being repaired), and ran to the manager immediately.

I told him everything.

"Danforth, that face tends to show when we least expect it. It's very rare that the face should show up right as the game is being played. You were supposed to tell him to wait between throws in case the face showed up."

"I did. And he complied."

"Okay."

"And that face showed right as he threw the ball!"

"Meaning that either the timing was bad, or that thing got smarter. I'll look into the incident. For now, close the game off for the rest of the day."

And that I did. The face usually goes away after an hour of the game being closed, but it will take longer if it gets to someone. Could be why he wanted me to close off the game for the rest of the day.

**Rule #8:** *If a brunette shows up wearing a black dress, wears a facial tattoo of a spiderweb, and walks as though she is floating, notify the manager immediately.*

Around a full 6 months into the job, I was making my rounds after hours, making sure to keep following the rules. The patrons were just leaving when I saw a brunette walk in.

It took me a while to notice her face. Yes, she wore a black dress. She did walk like she was floating. She was super tall, as though she was over 8 feet tall!

I was about to dismiss her as a patron coming for a prize when I noticed the unmistakable tattoo of a spiderweb, around her right eye.

After six months of noticing what happens if I break the rules, how could I not rush to the manager's office on instinct?

"Rule #8, boss!"

"Bring her to me, Danforth. It'll take a while, so wait outside when she's here."

I had a feeling that he might have met her before.

I looked all over for this girl. I'll admit she was beautiful, though the manager wants me to have her in his office.

When I found her near the Pac-Man, she looked at me as if she was scared to death.

I told her she'd be okay, and brought her to the manager's office. She immediately went inside, and I waited outside, just as he asked.

It did take a while. Boredom was setting in, and the arcade screens turning on and off and on and off was getting annoying.

The brunette walked out, seemingly calm, and she left the arcade.

The manager's eyes appeared bloodshot. I asked him what was going on.

"I can't tell you, but were the arcade screens acting strange?"

"They were turning on and off over and over."

He paused for a moment. He looked and the arcade screens were still doing it.

"Danforth..."

"Yes, boss?"

"It's time. We have to break Rule #9 tomorrow."

**Rule #9:** *Do not play the nameless arcade game that randomly shows up in every corner of the arcade.*

This arcade has no name at all. Almost every day, the game randomly shows up on another corner.

The arcade screens have different ways of acting if the brunette shows up, he told me. If they were showing weird images and cycling, it meant that there was nothing wrong. If they were showing the image of that girl while the brunette was there, he had to let her talk to the brunette. But if they were flashing like that like what happened the day before, then we'd have to do what we did that day.

This time, the nameless arcade showed up close to the entrance. It was almost like muscle memory for me to try and put the OUT OF ORDER sign on it, but the manager just waved me off.

"I need to do this, to keep this business going and to protect everyone."

I was looking over his shoulder as to what the game was all about. His own name, which I never knew until then, which was Lester Harrison, showed up in the top left corner.

Just like how the names of each kid had when they played *No Heart, No Soul*.

I heard that in this nameless arcade game, the avatar was consistent, unlike that one that Rule #1 is all about.

In it, the avatar looked like a rich male with a disfigured face. My boss got the man to the right of the arcade game, and the man talked to what appeared to be a zombified blend of a biker punk girl and the disguise that the two FBI characters in *White Chicks* donned.

They seemed to talk in an unintelligible language. A mix of Spanish and Irish, I think.

Then the screen changed to black with white text that said,

"Please choose a new manager."

Then the manager said,

"I already did. He's my best employee, I think he's fit for the job."

Then the text changed to say,

"Danforth Crabb? Indeed, he is eligible."

Then it changed into a game like one of the ones described in the one in Rule #1 that was added after the .exe ones, after the deaths of those two kids. In this case, it was the avatar in a burning version of the Green Hill Zone in *Sonic the Hedgehog*.

Then the manager went catatonic. His skin paler.

I decided to move his body off of it, and then the text said,

"Now that you have taken the managerial duties in his place, please move the character to the goal. He would have wanted you to manage the arcade and protect everyone."

Then, I did as it asked. I noticed that the name on the corner changed to mine.

So, I played it to bring the avatar to the goal. I was scared still, even when I managed to get it playing.

Scared because the manager died right then and there, before the game had me play.

I was mentally scarred by the experiences of following and seeing the effects of breaking each rule, but I had to do it.

It took a while, but when I finally got him to the goal, I was relieved.

Then it switched to a text that said,

"You have passed the test. I assure you that you will do what you can and save us all. Remember to read the manual on the desk so that you can fulfill your job. Goodbye."

And then the arcade turned itself off.

I went to Lester Harrison's office, now mine, and looked into the manual. I was scared because I had never taken such a job before, and witnessing his death, having been like what happened to Gabriel and Natalie, still scarred me.

The manual was leather-bound, had the rules, the reasons why, and instructions on how employees must be trained. On the last page, it said,

**Rule #10:** *The establishment must always have a manger and owner.*

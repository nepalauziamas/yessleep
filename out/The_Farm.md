When the winter snow had just started to melt away and spring was just upon us, my mother died at forty-six. She was a nice woman, always making sure to take care of my brother and me whenever something would happen that could hurt us. Which made it all the more surprising when it happened. She died from ‘mysterious causes’ or at least that's what the police report says. An investigation, which was opened briefly before being closed, looked into the death of my mother but our police department was so small that they couldn’t determine the cause of death. We all accepted her death, so we didn’t entirely care about *how* it had happened but the thought always seemed to bother me. *Could this also happen to me?* That thought seemed to come to me every night whilst I lay in bed, I always tried to push it to the back of my mind. That didn’t leave the people in our family thinking ways about what happened to her. I think she had a heart attack while my brother, during one of our ‘late-night’ conversations, said that she could have died of a brain aneurysm. Other than that curiosity, I didn’t want to talk about her anymore until the grief had completely left my mind, which seemed like an eternity.

We lived on a couple of acres of empty grasslands, with no houses or neighbours for another mile or so. The farm consisted of a large wooden barn, painted a shade of red that looked like a classic 60’s style barn. My father would always go out, day or night, and feed the animals inside the barn or ‘take care of them’ which meant killing them and preparing them for the process where either; he would sell the animals packaged at the grocery store or he would bring it inside and we would have it for breakfast, lunch or dinner. He would always keep the animals in the barn, so they didn’t ‘hurt us’ as he would always say, which I believed him because there have been people — at least in the place that we lived in — that had been attacked by cows and pigs, tearing their flesh off and crunching down on their bone, killing the person. That seemed like a very rare occurrence to happen and there was an issue with the animals but it didn’t matter. After hearing that, my father seemed very spooked by the incident to the point where he would keep the animals locked away in the barn. 

The barn was my father’s ‘safe’ place. A place where he could go and sit down and have a beer and relax, and my brother and I didn’t want to intrude on his private and safe space. I did get curious at times though, usually, whenever I saw the barn I would think: *What animals is he keeping inside of the barn? Why are the animals so hidden from us even though we are both older? That* could be chalked up to the fact that my mother (when she was alive) had hated animals ever since she was younger and didn’t like any aspect of them. Their look, their smell, and even the way that they tasted. That attitude probably carried over and stuck into my father and that it was normal. I had thought about actually going inside of the barn whenever my father was gone but I only needed the opportunity, which seemed like a one-in-a-million chance since he would be home all the time. *If I have the chance, I'll take it*. I wanted to see the animals inside. They seemed nice and friendly, at least the way my father described them, but of course, he was a big, large, strong man and the animals were probably scared of him so they acted friendly and what not but that thought didn’t linger too long inside my head before being replaced with another. And another. And another. The reasons almost started to pile up about why I should go inside the barn and I accepted it.

*Curiosity killed the cat*.

There were, of course, some annoyances to my father having a farm. I would never tell these issues directly to his face, but I’m sure he realizes. My father had, out of every other animal, a lot of rabbits. Mostly because we all liked to eat rabbits compared to other beef. Something about it, it tasted so *good*. Whenever we would go out to restaurants, we would sometimes get a rabbit and it didn’t taste as good. It was probably undercooked or maybe under-seasoned. *Maybe*.

Late at night, whenever my father brought home a rabbit he would go into the barn and kill them. He would always kill the animals late at night, so everyone who was sleeping in the house wouldn’t hear the sounds of the animals right before their head was chopped off or they would get a bolt pistol into their skull – the animals would let out a final, high-pitched scream, leading out all the air in their lungs before their eventual death – I would never tell my father that I was staying up that late since he and my mother always wanted me asleep before ten p.m. and my father would always go out to the barn at one or two a.m. *Why did I keep that to myself*?

The black and white analog clock, which ticked every time the second hand moved, hung on the kitchen’s lightly brown painted walls. A newly-opened calendar rested below the clock. The month on the calendar read, ‘JANUARY’ with a picture of an orange kitten playing with a ball of yarn. *Mom loved cats*, I thought, my throat starting to swell with tears starting to swell in my eyes but I held them in, bending my head down to face the plate and hide my tears from my father and brother in case they noticed and said something about it.

My brother, father and I all sat at the breakfast table. We were eating ham and eggs; the ham was fresh and so were the eggs. That thought always came to the back of my head but sometimes in the front of my mind. *I’m eating animal meat right now*. I wasn’t vegan at all but I wasn’t too crazy about eating meat, but my father sat directly across from me and I didn’t want to seem rude since he had worked so hard on it and had been excited to tell us when my brother and I got out of our bedrooms, heading to eat breakfast.

“Any plans for today?” My father asked, looking up from his plate to my brother and me.

No one answered for at least ten or twenty seconds before my brother stopped chewing his food to talk. “I need to go get a new rake at the hardware store in town,” My brother said, looking at my father. “Do you want to go too?”

“Yeah,” My father said, starting to smile. “I’d love to.”

I could tell, almost easily by the reaction, his face contorted, that he didn’t want to go. My father barely wanted to go anywhere but I’m sure he agreed so it would make my brother happier, plus he needed a ride to town — which was a good ten-minute drive from our house in the country to into town — ‘FAIRHOPE’ which was the name of our town that we lived in, had barely any stores inside the main living area of the town. It had one hardware store (which my brother and father were heading to), one medium-sized grocery store, a video store, and a donation center, which made the town money since people would bring in the things that they didn’t need anymore and then the town would sell them and get the money back. I was planning on moving out as soon as I started college. If I could escape.

“Great!” My brother said, grinning. “What do you need there?”

“Some of my tools for the farm are worn out, so I need to get new ones.” My father said, “We can go around twelve since they open at eleven.”

“Ah.” My brother said, starting to eat his food again.

“Do you wanna go into town?” My father said, turning away from my brother to face me. “Come for a ride maybe.”

“No thanks,” I said, realizing I had zoned out for the last part of the conversation between my father and brother. I looked at my father. “I have to do some math homework that I got on Friday.”

“Oh—” My father looked back at me. “That’s too bad.”

“I’ll go some other time though,” I said.

“Yeah,” My father said, agreeing.

Everyone continued to eat their breakfast. For the rest of the meal at the breakfast table, there was only silence before I finished eating, which was about a couple of minutes after the last word had been spoken. As I walked over to the sink, putting my dirty plate inside the sink and starting to scrub whatever was left on the plate I turned and looked to the left of me. The calendar. Thoughts and memories of my mother came back to me. Without me realizing it, tears started to silently roll down my cheeks as I continued to wash my plate. 

My father and brother got their coats on and quickly walked down the stairs, leading into the side porch of our house. I had volunteered to clean and put away my father’s and brother’s plates while they got ready for going into town. I lifted my head to look out the kitchen window, I saw the barn. The dark gloomy clouds in the sky emphasize the bright colour of the barn. It looked out of place. Strange. *Today is the day*, I thought, *I can finally go inside and look around*.

*Curiosity killed the cat.*

“We’ll be back home in about an hour or so,” my father said behind me. I turned around to see him and my brother both wearing their fall jackets with their shoes already on. “You sure there isn’t anything that you want while we’re gone?”

“No,” I said, now starting to dry both plates. “Thank you though.”

My father grinned briefly before turning around and walking down the stairs, and out the door leading to the side porch. My brother stood there for a second looking at me. “See you later."

He turned and followed behind my father, leaving the house through the side door. Quickly after my brother shut the side door, I heard the engine of my father’s 2003 Rav four turn on, followed by the passenger side door opening and shutting. I hurried away from the sink and down the stairs to the side porch. I opened the side door and walked a couple of steps out of the house. Looking into the small driveway next to our house.

My father turned around, grabbing something in the backseat. Revealed my brother, sitting in the passenger seat. He noticed me and smiled, waving at me. I waved back. My father turned back around and looked to the left of him where he saw me. He grinned before looking away from me and putting the car in drive. The car started to drive and pull out of the driveway, the car tires crunching on the gravel filling our driveway as it moved. Before the car got out of the driveway, my brother still looked at me, now grinning. Contorting his face in a funny way where his forehead was wrinkled and his cheek muscles lifted, basically scrunching his face in the middle. I giggled as I looked at him before he was out of my sight and I turned around and walked back into the house. That was the last time I ever saw my brother.

*Curiosity killed the cat.*

The saying continued in my head, almost repeatedly, in my mother’s voice. She had told me that many other times in the past when I was a child. The first was when I was caught searching for Christmas presents inside my parents' closet of their bedroom. I turned around and saw her standing at the door looking down at me. Blocking any exit that I could have tried to make. She took me aside and spanked me, before telling me a ‘life’s lesson’ as she would call it. This happened a couple more times but in different situations where I was either overthinking something or over investigating something. She said it so much it carried over with me even after her passing.

I stood on an area of grass on our property that would become muddy whenever rain would pass through. A cold draft of air came through the area, flowing through my hair before fading out. Unknowingly, I had walked into the mud puddle — I was still more focused on analyzing the area around the house than whatever I was stepping on, but I still tried to be careful since I could easily fall and slip if I wasn’t careful — I stood there, looking around the property. Making sure that there wasn’t anyone nearby that could see me doing such a thing and report it to my father. I did have some paranoia but that stuck with me. I’m not entirely sure where I got it but it wouldn’t leave my mind how hard I tried. I wore my green rain boots that stopped just below my knee. The colour reminded me of the garbage can that sat in the corner of the kitchen. I wore a yellow rain slicker with the hood up, covering my hair. It had just started to rain and was starting to calm from the original heavy downpour, which started around ten minutes after my father’s old Rav four left the driveway. The rain continued to drop onto the hood of the slicker, reminding me of rain falling on a shed roof. A comfortable sound. I continued walking.

The barn’s large doors were locked shut, which didn’t come as a surprise since they hadn’t been opened since my parents bought the house. A couple of feet above the large barn doors was a smaller door leading into the hayloft. The door was opened slightly, which caused it to bang against the frame whenever a gust of wind would come by. On the right of the large barn doors was a smaller door, painted the same colour of red as the barn was painted. The door seemed almost hidden. The only reason that I knew it was there was when I would stay up late at night, and watch as my father walked into the barn through the door. Usually holding an axe or a bucket of food that would be gone when he came out of the barn.

As I reached the barn my heart started to beat faster. Steadily it grew. Bum bum. Bum bum. Bum bum bum. My heartbeat seemed to be beating inside of my ears, as my breath slowed and steadied. The relaxing sound of rain hitting the hood of the rain slicker continued. The voice of my mother still repeated in my head as my boots continued moving, sometimes shuffling, through the wet grass and mud. The quick and potent smell of mildew hit me and I stopped, covering my nose whilst breathing through my nose. I continued walking toward the barn.

*Curiosity killed the cat.*

I finally reached the side barn door. My stomach became sore. *Am I hungry? No, I just ate fifteen minutes ago.* It was my gut feeling trying to stop me, but I didn’t realize that when I stood there, the rain continued to fall on and off from the rain slicker. I originally thought that, since the weather was cold, I was coming down on something. A fever, maybe the flu.

I zoned back into reality; my body seemed to be thrust along with it. My brain started to think again, my surroundings becoming more real than before. A cold gust of wind hit my body. Seemingly making its way through my clothes and directly to my flesh — causing my skin to burst out in gooseflesh — I stood there, mud starting to seep around my boots. I had only twenty minutes to live.

Eighteen minutes left.

My hand pulled out of my warm and comfortable pocket and aimed directly for the door. When my hand was halfway through opening the door, I noticed that it was shaking slightly. I couldn’t feel anything. *The cold air probably has my hand going limp*, I thought, but it was the anxiety and build-up to the situation that was making my body and brain over-react. As my hand went closer to push the door open, raindrops started to fall heavier and thicker onto my head and the land around me. My hand landed on the door before I could push it open. A splinter from the old, rotting wood dug deep into my ring finger. I pulled back away from the door. In a quick motion, I grabbed my right hand with my left, pulling it out of the pocket of the rain slicker. I winced as I held my hand. I bent my head down suddenly and exclaimed the splinter. It was a thick but stumpy splinter. I pinched my index finger and thumb together and pulled out the sprinter. As it moved slowly out of the small hole that the splinter had created, a small amount of blood drew from the hole. *I didn’t know splinters could do that*, I thought, before looking back up at the barn’s side door. It was right there, I could open it right now and know. I could finally know after all of these years. I had been seemingly obsessed with the topic for years, so curious, but I knew as soon as I told my dad that I wanted to go outside and into the barn so I could see the animals he would have gotten angry and I didn’t want that to happen so I never told him.

Ten minutes left.

I walked a couple of steps closer to the door. I finally pressed it open with my right hand, making sure to avoid any other splinters sticking out from the door as I did. As soon as I pushed the door was open, warm light came from the inside of the barn. Shining past and under the door, like smoke trying to escape from a small room. The rank smell of raw and dead rotting flesh hit me. As soon as it did, I quickly turned away from the door and bent down next to the barn on the wet grass and with a sudden retch I threw up on the grass. The smell still stayed with me even after I turned away from the barn and was breathing in the fresh, brisk air of the country. Alone. For miles. *The smell is dead animals rotting, just dead meat.* I lied to myself, and I knew it.

I turned back to the door, looking inside the barn. My eyes had gotten used to the light and I saw in the middle of the barn: A shrine.

*Curiosity killed the cat*. Those had been some of the last words that my mother had told me before she had died. I thought back quickly to the day right before the fear and terror struck.

\* \* \*

I sat down at our breakfast table, reading. The winter snow twisted and whirled with the wind outside our kitchen window. I would stare briefly at it since I found the sound of the wind hitting against the house as a ‘comfortable’ sound like rain on a shed. I forgot what book exactly I was reading but it was some pulp horror book that my mother loved to read as a ‘treat’, which was what she called them. She sat next to me, reading whatever she was reading at the time and I stopped reading, placing the bookmark inside of the book, closing it and putting it on the table. I turned and looked at her, and she looked down from her book and at me.

“Yes, honey?” She asked.

“Can I ask you something?”

My mother’s mind automatically went straight for ‘the talk’ since she or my father had not told me much about the subject yet, but they were waiting until I was mature enough.

“Maybe later honey—”

“No, I meant something else. About dad.” I said, my voice growing slower so my father wouldn’t hear my mother or me in the other room.

“What is it?”

“The barn,” I said. “I wanna see inside it.”

“Honey,” My mom said, tilting her head to look at me. She had heard me ask almost ten thousand times before and every time I would get the same response.

“Curiosity killed the cat,” she said in a way that sounded like she was trying to remind me of something that I had been taught before and I had forgotten.

“I know but—”

“No buts,” She giggled a little bit. She and I had the same sense of humour. “But I’m serious. Rules are rules and you don’t want to break them.”

“Alright,” I sighed, and continued reading.

\* \* \*

My mother’s body opened and stretched out and was nailed to a large piece of wood with a message written above her head, on a white wood board scrawled in blood, read (from what I could make out from where I was standing):

**I love you. Together forever.**

Her rib cage and internal organs were exposed. Most of her organs were either inside her body — half hanging out, half still inside her body — or had fallen out onto the dirty floor of the barn. Other corpses, some skeletons, others decaying human bodies, lay sitting against the barn walls. Pieces of hay were laid out scattered across the barn floor, with blood covering most pieces. In the back right corner of the barn was a table, covered completely in dried blood. *The same colour as the barn is painted*, the thought came to me and wouldn’t leave, no matter how hard I tried to push it to the back of my head. I stumbled backwards out of the barn, horrified at what I had seen. *This entire time?* I thought, *my dad was killing people? But he wouldn’t do anything like that. He’s … a good person.* As soon as my boots touched the wet, mildew-scented grass, I slammed the door shut. That didn’t stop the scent from still going through the barn, or maybe it was stuck on my clothes. Standing there, dumbfounded, I heard from behind me something rolling along the gravel driveway. Car tires. My head turned quickly to look behind my shoulder. I saw my dad’s car, with him sitting in the driver’s seat. A crazed, demented grin smeared across his face. We both locked eyes before I broke the stare, looking towards the passenger seat, *it was empty*. My brother, who was originally sitting in the passenger seat, was now gone.

I was next.

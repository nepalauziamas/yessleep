We all woke up from our nap about an hour ago I’ve found time works different here because it’s only been 4 hours since we all fell asleep and about 6 since we got stuck in the ocean.

The way I’ve found time works different is because when I checked my post somebody has said it’s been 14 hours which deeply confused me. But along with that they had an idea that may work. They said to call a relative When I saw that I decided to call my brother to see if he could help he lives relatively close to the beach where we had left in the boat. The call went somewhat like this.

“Hey what’s up?”
“Dude I need help me my friend and our girlfriends went on this boat right? We thought it’d be fun to go out to sea but after a while we realized that there was no clouds and no fish or anything! No land just water for miles and miles! But I was wondering I could give you my location and maybe you could come in your boat and see if we’re where it says we are? Please we’re desperate!”
“Uhh weird story but yeah yeah I can do that just send it right over.”
“Thank you! Thank you! I love you so much thank you! I’m gonna go now I’m saving my phone battery.”
“Ok bye love you too.”

It went well I just hope he’s able to find us. I’d also like to clear up a few things I don’t remember drinking or taking any drugs before this and also we aren’t sacrificing or harming anyone before we know what’s going on and what has to be done. I’ll leave this to you guys but I’m wondering if you’d like to hear from the other people like maybe I could hand them the phone and they could type what they want? But right now I’ll update you on everyone including me. First we’ll start with the girls as I feel they aren’t holding up as well as me and Peter are but out of those we’ll start with my girlfriend Patricia she seems to be handling it better than Alexis but I can tell she’s getting scared and depressed it’s easy to tell because she’s not very good at hiding her feelings but also I know that she hates being stuck somewhere for a while. Moving on to Alexis she’s not handling this well she’s been panicking almost all day Peter has barely been able to help due to him having to console her almost the whole time. She’s just stayed in bed silently crying I understand and I can’t help but to feel bad for her. Moving onto Peter he’s definetkey doing the best out of us I know that he hates seeing Alexis sad though. He’s also the strongest and tallest out of us more brawn then brain. Now how I’m doing I’m doing ok but hate being in the ocean I have conserved food and made a list that balances food consumption and aslong as we follow the list we will have food until the 18th. Only 3 more days until we run out of food unless we find a way to make a farm. I know we have plant pots but none of us know how to properly garden.

It’s been another hour it’s after dinner and we’re getting ready for bed again but we’ve decided to have somebody stay up and see if anything changes at night. Of course I’ve been told to be the one to do it cause I’m almost never tired and usually stay up all night. The next few typed will probably be about anything that happens.

The sky is beautiful it’s so bright because of the so many stars I hope they’re stars anyway but it seems nothing have changed other than that I do however think I see something in the distance still and unmoving. All of this is making me realize that I’m not as smart as most people say I am all in good at is math and that’s it. But let’s not think about that right now what’s important is that I defiantly see something I haven’t found anything like this anywhere on the internet but if I have access to it I could maybe search up how to garden or anything that could help. I’ll keep watch and update you but right now I need more help and also should I tell them about that thing I see and if so should we head to it and also should I give them the phone sometimes so they can type too?

The waters changed I hope it’s a good thing and that it means we might be in the real world it used to be completely still but now it’s waving around a little I do hope to see fish soon cause that may bring more food to us. I’ve found entertainment in making crappy edits on my phone and taking photos and videos that reminds me maybe I can find some board games or cards to keep everyone distracted from the situation we’re in. I also hope somebody packed a charger because I know I didn’t I don’t know if this boat has power though it might though? All I hope is that my brother will be here tomorrow I also hope we can find something to watch cause I think there’s a tv downstairs and maybe we can hook up a phone there and hook up a computer or something and watch a movie and atleast feel normal for a while.

It seems like it’s about 1am I don’t know what time it could be there for you but It says 1am in my phone maybe it just says that in normal time I don’t now what else to talk about but I do know that that thing I saw earlier could be a way home it seems to only be visible at night unless we’re moving and we haven’t noticed I miss my family, I miss my pets. I hope we’ll be off here soon I hope somebody has answers this is Daniel and I’m going to survive as long as I can and I’m going to find a way to get more food and find a way to get out of here good night you guys I hope you have more ideas and answers to my questions.

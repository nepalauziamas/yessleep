I'm not sure if anyone is hearing this right now, but if you are, please save us immediately. We've been trapped here since yesterday and we won't get out anytime soon. This, thing, has turned an event of fun activities lasting all night into a living horror story.

It all started yesterday, May 27th, 2022. School was ending for everyone in the town. And our church wanted to celebrate this by having a lock-in where we do fun stuff all night. Little did me and everyone else know that it would turn, HORRIBLY, wrong. 

It all started out normal and was fun, until we started playing a game called Sardines at 1:30. Sardines was this game where someone could hide anywhere in the church and everyone had to try to find them. It's kind of like a reverse hide-and-seek. The first person chosen to hide was a girl named Laura. We all split into groups to find her, I decided to join my two friends Carl and Joseph. 

The whole church was dark since it was 1:30 in the morning, so it was pretty scary, but cool at the same time. I've always been afraid of the dark but being with my friends made me feel better. Me, Carl and Joseph were searching with 3 other people, but then everyone heard a blood curdling scream that was extremely loud and scared the shit out of me. The scream came from the place where we go to worship every Sunday. Some people went to check was happened, but what they saw was something very unholy for a church.

They saw Laura's mutilated body completely fucked up, it couldn't have been anyone in the church. No one was searching in the worship place at the time, and the leaders were in the youth group room. Meaning it would either be someone who broke in, or something much more demonic and unholy. Everyone started freaking out after hearing the news. The leaders heard the scream too and went to check on us to see what happened. "What, what's going on here?" The youth leader Kevin said.

One of the people said "LAURA IS DEAD" "WHAT?", all the youth leaders said. They went to in the worship place to see what happened, but then we all heard many screams from there too, then they were all dead too. "What the fuck is going on?" One of the girls said, someone else said "Something horrible is going on here". Everyone was scared beyond comprehension, some people were even sobbing. We had to know what this thing was.

Considering the fact it was now 2:00 in the morning, it just made everything worse. We tried turning on all the lights, but then we realized that thing destroyed the circuits to all the lights. Everyone was running around screaming in fear. We were now in the big room where the check in place was, the entrance to the kids rooms and the worship place, it was all a huge place too. Me, Carl, and Joseph were absolutely terrified, Carl was always a tough person and I've only seen him cry once in my 7 years of knowing him, but he was pale and was absolutely terrified. 

Someone managed to get a glimpse of one of those, creatures, I guess you could say. I saw it too, I only saw it for one second and it was dark and I only saw a little of it. It kind of looked like the demogorgens from Stranger Things and the aliens from A Quiet Place. We also heard noises in the worship place, so that meant there was more than 1 creature here. The doors were also locked and there was no way to get out, we were now trapped in here with these creatures.

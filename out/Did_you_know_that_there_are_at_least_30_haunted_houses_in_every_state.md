“So how many dead squirrels is *too* many, Gerald?”

“Well… one is too many, but-”

“But we’ve had *seven*.”

“Margie, we’ve always lived in apartments. Now that we’re in our own house, we’re going to have to deal with cleaning up the natural shit that comes with owning a backyard.”

“*It’s not natural for so many squirrels to lose their heads,* Gerald.”

Dad just huffed. I couldn’t tell their reactions after that; I had to stay hidden, and that meant not peeking my head around the corner. There were lots of places to hide in our new house, and kids always hear more than parents think they do, so I could tell a lot by staying silent. 

“I’ve been noticing mood changes in Leonard.” Mom’s voice was a lot quieter now.

“He’s seven years old and just moved to a new house, he’s-”

“*You’ve* noticed mood changes in Leonard, too. If you’ve been paying attention, that is.”

Dad sighed. I pricked up my ears and leaned closer to the edge of the wall.

“It’s not about the move, Gerald. Something’s bothering him on – I don’t know – some kind of fundamental frequency. He’s upset, and I think he’s scared.”

They paused.

“Gerald, the truth is that *I’m* scared, too. Wild animals don’t decapitate squirrels and just leave their bodies behind. Something wants them to suffer.”

“Margie… what’s you’re saying doesn’t make logical sense.”

“Doesn’t make logical sense? Let’s put it all together, Gerald. Seven brutalized squirrels left for us like Easter eggs. Photos that we assumed were lost in the move show up in closets and bathrooms that haven’t been touched. Food is disappearing from the kitchen faster than we’re eating it, especially the salt – I’ve bought three different canisters, and all three are gone. Someone or some*thing* shredded my sage plant last night. And our son – it’s like I’m talking to a ghost, Gerald. It is *not* logical to blame every bizarre occurrence on a different unlikely cause. *Something is wrong with this house.*”

“I can’t do this, Margie. There’s no such thing as a haunted fucking house.”

I slunk away, slipping back inside and climbing the stairs to my new bedroom. Sunbeams streamed through the bay window, filling the mostly empty space with light. I sat down on the bare, wooden floor, directly in front of the sliding mirrored door of my walk-in closet. I stared at my reflection. 

Chills ran down my spine. I hated this part. I *hated* it. I never felt so exposed as I did in front of that mirror, shuddering at my own image, waiting for things to start.

“I’m alone,” I whispered. I shifted uncomfortably on the floor and wiped my eye. 

At first, there was nothing. My face just stared back in silence.

Then the door slowly slid open. Grimy fingers curled around its edges.

“What did you bring me?”

I pulled out a box of granola bars with a shaking hand. “My parents have noticed the missing food.”

I jumped as he leaned out of the closet and snatched the box. The man’s face was coated in grime; his black and yellow teeth soured breath that reeked of neglect and sadness as a lone drop of grease fell from his hair and landed on the floor with a tiny *plop*. 

My breath trembled as I spoke, but I knew the consequences of running, so I held very still. “You were right, M-Mom thinks it’s haunted, and I-I think she’ll convince Dad soon, too.”

He squeezed a granola bar onto a tongue coated with yellow film. Drool cascaded down his lips as he mashed it between loose teeth and exposed gums. 

“Good,” he answered, spraying my face with a fine mist of spit and granola chunks. “Remember the pictures, kid?”

I nodded. Of course I remembered the pictures; he’d shown them to me that first night in my new room, when he crawled out from under my bed. Candid shots of me, Mom, and Dad, sometimes together, sometimes separate, usually awake, sometimes while sleeping. He had one picture of my parents naked together, and one where I was looking at the camera but don’t remember it. The man said he kept very careful records and had 1,913 pictures of us. 

“Keep giving me food, and keep the secret, kid,” he mumbled while closing the closet door. “Remember that I’m watching far more than you realize. Don’t tell anyone about me, or your parents will beg me to kill all three of you when they find out [what I have planned in retaliation](https://www.facebook.com/P-F-McGrail-181784199029462/).”

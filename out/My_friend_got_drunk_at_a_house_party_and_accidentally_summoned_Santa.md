My friends and I would be considered the trouble makers in our school. We have never done anything bad but people have always assumed it by the way we dress. We are all metal fans and would dress accordingly.

It was pur final year in school so we decided it would be a good idea to throw a house party so we could go out with a bang. Everyone in our year was invited and it looked like they all intended to show up. We asked people to bring something with them so they weren't showing up empty handed.

We managed to organise an ungodly amount of alcohol as it was pretty obvious that it would probably be needed. My parents were going to be out of town so it was decided to throw the party at mine. It was at the end of a mn empty street so we didn't have to worry about the neighbour complaining.

The night of the party was chaotic as dozens of people showed up. It only took a short time before everyone was shit faced drunk. I was wandering around the house chatting away to people and really enjoying myself.

I walked downstairs and stopped dead in my tracks as I saw one of my friends Mark pouring salt on the ground. He saw my expression and started explaining that they planned to summon Satan to join us. I was honestly drunk at this time so I told him to do it. He poured the salt into a small circle in the middle of the floor.

Within a few minutes he had everything set up and had attracted a large crowd of people. He muttered some incantation and we all gasped as a small fog had appeared inside the circle.

We craned our necks to get a better view and were stunned as the man dressed in white and red suddenly stood in the circle.

The room was deathly silent as everyone stared at the apparition before us that we had all thought was a myth. His face broke into a smile and something about that smile made the hair on the back of my neck stand up.

Mark was the first to break the silence by cursing loudly. I looked over his shoulder to see he had written Santa instead of Satan when preparing the incantation. His bad spelling had once again fucked him over.

Everyone began speaking at once and asking Santa dozens of questions. He began answering them each in turn and started handing out presents out of a sack that magically appeared beside him.

He asked Mark to break the salt circle as he was feeling a bit claustrophobic being trapped in the circle. The primordial part of my brain screamed at me to not let him out but my body refused to act.

I watched in horror as Mark used a brush and moved some of the salt out of the way. The smile on Santa's face got bigger and a few people began backing away as his razor sharp teeth came into view. 

Before anyone could react, he lunged at Mark and buried his teeth into his throat. A spray of blood soaked a few people as he tore out a chunk of his flesh.

We all stood there staring as Mark's body collapsed to the ground with a surprised look on his corpse. The spell that held us in place was broken as one of the girls screamed and everyone ran towards the exits. 

We all rushed outside and stopped in our tracks as hundreds of tiny green men carrying sharpened sticks advanced on us. They were only about a foot high and their faces were covered in hundreds of scars that oozed puss. 

A few people who tried to push past them were slaughtered beyond recognition. They showed no mercy as they repeatedly plunged the sticks into their bodies. 

We fled back inside and some of the more sensible of us went to the kitchen to grab weapons. We had to step over some corpses as Santa had been busy intermittently killing anyone that got too close to him.

I grabbed two steak knives and prepared to fight off anything that came too close. The building began to shake as the elves outside were trying to force their way in. The people in the kitchen with me looked terrified and we all clustered together with our makeshift arsenal of weapons.

I was forced to shield my face as the kitchen window exploded inwards. I stared down at one of the elves whose body was riddled with glass and lay in a pool of his own blood. 

I was forced to back away from the window as dozens of the elves began flooding inside. The group I was with tried to fight but there were just two many of them. I started backing away as everyone else was quickly massacred. 

I rushed out of the kitchen and found my house littered with body parts. I saw a small little body lying amongst the carnage and came to the sickening realisation that one of the girls had been pregnant.

I stood there unmoving as every escape route was now blocked. The only sounds in thr house was the dripping of blood from the body parts that had been thrown against the roof.

Santa walked into the room snd I could see his clothes were completely red now as all of the white bits were now soaked in blood. He approached me slowly with a grin on his face.

He was about to rip my throat out but stopped inches from my throat. He looked at me closely for a second before pulling a scroll from somewhere up his sleeve. He looked down at it and then let out a sigh.

He snapped his fingers and all of the elves disappeared from sight. He pointed at the scroll and told me that I wasn't on the naughty list this year so he couldn't do anything to me. He handed me a pogo stick before vanishing in a cloud of smoke.

I threw the pogo stick to one side and then wept. I am writing this now as I hear my parent's car pull into the driveway. I don't know how I am going to explain the dozens of bodies or even if they will believe me. All I know is that Santa is real and it is very important to stay off his naughty list

I’m not really sure how it happened. I never considered myself particularly… witchy. I may be a bit eccentric. I do live by myself, in a small house surrounded by a wild garden. Maybe that’s a little suspect. And I tend to wear long dresses, big hats, a lot of black. Oh, and there’s the fact that I’ve got a black cat. He slunk into my garden one day and has just never left. I call her Poe.

Okay, I guess I can *kind of * see where they got the idea.

And I’ll admit that I didn’t do much to discourage it. I wouldn’t have the first idea how to, anyway. What am I gonna do? Wear a sign that says, ‘just FYI, I’m definitely *not* a witch’? Yeah, I’m sure that’ll go over well.

Some of the kids were afraid of me. Some of them intrigued. A few of them laughed and jeered, but an icy glare took care of that most of the time.

To be honest, it isn’t something I worried about or thought of much.

Not until Timothy Baker came knocking at my door.

*	*	*

It was just a few weeks before Halloween.

I remember because I’d already decorated. I had pumpkins all over the porch, and cobwebs hanging over the bamboo archway that covered the path to the front door. I had even stuck a broom outside my door, just to keep the kids guessing.

I’d just pulled a batch of bat-shaped pumpkin-flavored cookies out of the oven when I heard the knocking.

“In a minute!” I shouted, pulling off my oven mitts and stepping over to the door.

I was expecting the mailman or maybe Mrs. Wilford from next door, who promised to come share her favorite pumpkin bar recipe with me sometime. Instead, it was a little boy.

He had shaggy blonde hair and was wearing baggy clothing, clearly hand-me-downs from the wear and tear. He must have been nine, maybe ten, but his frame was slight, his cheeks hollowed out. He had skinned-up knees and a bruise along his left cheekbone. More importantly, his eyes were fixed down at the ground and he was trembling from head to toe.

“Yes? Can I help you?” I asked.

He took a shaky breath. “I… I’m here to… to ask for a f-favor.”

I cocked my head as I stared at him. He still wouldn’t look up at me.

“A favor? From me?”

“I brought something,” he mumbled, and I saw that, indeed, he did have a bag clutched in his hand. “I read you’re s’pposed to bring an offering when you ask a witch for help.”

For a moment, I was speechless, uncertain. I looked around and saw that the boy was well and truly alone. He was also terrified, and I was worried he was going to pass out on my front step.

“Well, then, I suppose you’d better come inside.”

The boy paled even further. “Do… do you promise not to eat me?”

I smiled. “I promise.”

“Witches can’t go back on promises.”

“No, they can’t. So, you know you’re safe then, don’t you?”

Even so, it took a few minutes for him to gather the courage to follow me inside. By the time he did, I’d already set out a few cookies for him and a glass of milk.

“Okay,” I said, gesturing for him to sit down, “let’s start with this. What’s your name?”

“Timothy Baker.”

“And what is it you’d like me to do?”

He gulped and set his bag on the table. “I… I want you to kill my brother.”

I took a deep breath and, for one long second, didn’t say anything. This was bad. I shouldn’t have asked the kid inside. I shouldn’t have gotten involved.

“You know, fratricide is frowned upon in most places.”

Timothy frowned. “What’s that?”

I shook my head. “Never mind. Why do you want your brother dead?”

He flinched a little, but didn’t deny it. He started to nibble on a cookie as he gathered his thoughts. I sensed Poe coming into the room, her twitching tail giving her away as she slunk under the table.

“He’s a bully,” said Timothy.

“Is he the one who gave you that bruise?”

He nodded.

“Look, Timothy…” I cast around the room, hoping the words I needed would appear out of thin air. They didn’t. “I know this must be hard for you. It sounds like you’re going through a tough time. But killing him isn’t a solution to your problem.”

“It’s not just me,” he rushed in to say. “Jake is… *mean.* Meaner than… than anyone I’ve ever known. It’s not just me he hurts. He hurts other people, kids at school. And… animals, sometimes.”

As if on cue, Poe jumped up from the floor into Timothy’s lap, settling herself down as the boy began to pet her on instinct.

“Do your parents know about what he’s doing?” I asked.

Timothy’s face twisted a little. “They don’t see most of it. I tried telling them but they just… didn’t listen. I think some other parents did, too, because Jake’s been bullying other kids so bad. But they just ignore it. I don’t know why they won’t *do* something!”

We sat in silent for a few minutes. Timothy ate his cookies and slowly began to relax into his chair. Poe started to purr from her perch.

“Have you tried to talk to a counselor at school about this?” I asked.

Timothy shook his head. “You don’t get it – there’s no more *time.* I have to do something *now!*”

“What do you mean?”

For the first time since he arrived at my door, Timothy looked me right in the eye. “Mom’s pregnant. I’m gonna have a little sister. And… and I’m really scared that Jake’s gonna kill her.”

Before I could respond to that, Timothy was dumping out the contents of his bag onto my kitchen table. I noted a few leaves, some rocks, and a couple of wriggling worms trying vainly to find their way to some dirt. Poe was watching them with great interest.

“I, um. I wasn’t sure what witches like. I read some stuff online but some of the things seemed… hard to get.” He was turning red all the way up to the tips of his ears.

“This is… great,” I said, while a voice in my head sighed *where exactly did I go wrong with my life?*

The boy looked at me expectantly and I realized he was waiting for me to say… something. To accept or to turn him down. To fix things. Because that’s what adults do, right? They fix things. And who better to ask than someone who had magic at their fingertips?

I made a decision right then and there, against all the clamoring in my brain and based only on a little flutter in my heart that says *he needs help and has no one else to turn to.*

“Alright,” I said. “I’ll take care of it.”

*	*	*

*Jasmine Lyset, you are an idiot.*

I walked through town, my brain pounding away at what appeared to be an unsolvable riddle, wondering why I’d agreed to help in the first place.

*Okay. Let’s do it this way. Let’s start with what we know.*

Based only on Timothy’s account and what I’d gleaned from paying attention to the neighborhood kids after his visit, Jake Baker was a bully at best, and an abusive shitstain at worse. Timothy’s parents had already proved to be useless, so going to them was out of the question. That left me with very few options.

I could try to contact the school’s guidance counselor… but it would seem suspicious, coming from a complete stranger with no children in the school.

The police? I had no evidence, no reason for them to take me seriously.

“Hey, witch bitch!”

I had barely a second to react before I was knocked off balance. A sharp pain radiated from my right shoulder blade. I went down hard and landed on my hands and knees on the pavement.

A boy rode by on his bike, skidding to a stop in front of me.

Jake Baker. Why was I not surprised?

He had a rock in his hand and a bag full of stones thrown over his shoulder. I realized with a shock that he’d actually hit me with a rock.

“Hope you’re ready for Halloween, bitch. Something’s coming your way.”

He spat at me and rode off, laughing and shouting. I watched adults and other children dart out of his way as he went.

I sat there on the ground for a moment, stunned. Then I slowly stood up, my brain coming back online. An idea crystalized in the back of my head, something dreadful… but effective.

*	*	*

October 31st.

I had everything in place for that night. I had buckets of candy ready for the children, along with caramel apples for anyone who wanted one. I didn’t anticipate too many children, given my reputation.

Plus, I’d done a little… redecorating in my yard.

I’d turned my entire property into a makeshift cemetery, complete with skeletons, ghosts, and headstones. I had scattered patches of dirt here and there, stuck zombie hands in them, really went the extra mile to make it look authentic. As fabulous as it looked, I was sure the children would find it a bit too daunting.

I was especially proud of my jack-o-lantern display at the rightmost edge of the yard, pushed right up against the tall wooden fence. I’d carved dozens of jack-o-lanterns and placed them both on the headstones and all over the ground. Their candles fluttered in the breeze but stubbornly remained lit. Poe tried to swat at a few of them before I banished her back into the house.

My predictions turned out to be correct. Only a few kids were brave enough to come up to the door, mostly accompanied by their parents. It was a quiet night until the sun fully set and it was too late to be out trick-or-treating.

I turned the porch light off and went back into the house. But I stayed up late that night, sitting downstairs and reading quietly. Enjoying the chill in the air contrasted by the warmth of my fireplace.

I heard him coming up the path at about one in the morning. He wasn’t very quiet, wasn’t trying to be. I wondered to myself if he was hoping to be caught, if he wanted me to come outside to confront him. He was shit out of luck, if that’s what he was thinking.

I listened for a while, trying to place the sounds I heard. That – he threw something at the house. And there – he turned over the candy bucket I’d left on the porch for wayward souls that ventured out late into the night.

Then I heard him smashing the pumpkins, and I smiled.

It didn’t take long after that until I heard a heavy *thump.*

And then – silence.

I waited for a while after that – a good twenty minutes, just to teach him a lesson. Then, with a sigh, I stood up from my chair, grabbed my flashlight and walked outside.

There were still a few pumpkins left. They gave off just enough light to warn me of the edges of the hole in my yard.

I stepped to the edge and shined my flashlight inside.

It had taken me days to dig that hole deep enough for my purpose. Of course, there’s only so far down you can dig on your own, so I needed a little help. A few sharpened wooden stakes stuck into the base of the pit did well enough.

Jake didn’t seem to think so, though. He was lying there, pinned right through, his blood seeping into the dirt. He was coughing a little, dragging air into his lungs but not enough to scream. I wondered if that was due to shock or if he’d managed to puncture a lung. He was so bloody by then that I couldn’t quite tell where all he’d been punctured.

“You know,” I said, grabbing my shovel from a nearby skeleton, “if you’d just skipped the pumpkins, you’d probably already be on your way home by now.”

His lips were pursing, opening, snapping shut. Like he was trying desperately hard to say something. Must’ve been important.

I took a shovel full of dirt – dirt that I’d spread nearby as part of the makeshift graveyard, of course – and tipped it into the hole. It rained down on his head and he sputtered, trying to cough it out of his mouth.

“But somehow, I just knew you wouldn’t be able to resist. You little shitbags never do. Awful lucky for me that you’re the only one who was pathetic enough to trash a pumpkin display on Halloween night. Why, we’re the only ones out here, you and I.”

He twitched a little on the ground, but not much. He was losing too much blood and the fight was going out of him. I’d need to make this quick.

“I hope this is as painful as I suspect it will be,” I said, as I sat the flashlight down and started shoveling the dirt into the hole.

If he tried to scream, I never heard it.

*	*	*

Nearly a year later, another knock came on my door.

It was almost Halloween once again and I was busy carving jack-o-lanterns. I’d decided to make my yard pumpkin-themed that year – I was going to have lit pumpkins all over the yard. I expected many more children that time around, so I wanted everything to look perfect.

It’s funny… within that last year, the children in town seemed to have a change of heart about me. They still thought I was a witch, of course, but now they seemed to have decided that I was a good witch. They’d come by and play in my yard after school more often than not, bringing along little treats for Poe. I always had treats for them in return. I got to know the local parents, too.

So, I wasn’t surprised when the knocking came at my door… but I was a little surprised to see who was standing there, with apple-red cheeks and a dazzling smile.

“Timothy Baker!” I said, my own smile growing to match his. “It’s been quite some time since I’ve seen you. Why don’t you come in?”

He came in right behind me this time, a bounce in his step that hadn’t been there before. He set himself down at the table and began tracing the grinning face on one of the pumpkins.

“I don’t know how you did it, but I know you did.”

“Did I do something?” I hummed, pouring some hot apple cider and grabbing a few cookies for the boy. “I can’t say I remember.”

“That’s okay,” he said, his grin showing off a missing front tooth, “I won’t tell anyone your secret. But I brought you something as a thank-you.”

He set a manila envelope on the table. “Don’t open it ‘til I’m gone!” he warned.

“Alright,” I said. “How’s your baby sister?”

“She’s great! Her name’s Allison. She’ll turn one this December.”

We chatted for a little bit longer before he got up to go. “Bye! See you on Halloween!!” He dashed down the front path and I watched him go, my eyes drifting over to a patch of green that was just a little fresher than the rest.

Soon, it would all begin to grow brittle and gray as the snow came. But for now, everything hung in the balance between life and death.

I turned back inside and tore open the envelope.

A small ornament dropped into my palm, clearly handmade from clay. It was a happy, grinning jack-o-lantern.

Not for the first time, I wondered how much Timothy had guessed of the truth.

With a smile, I hung the little bauble by my window and turned back to my own pumpkins. After all, there were only a few days left, and everything had to be just right.

Happy Halloween.

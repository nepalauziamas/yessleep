My family and I were taking a trip down to holden beach to visit my stepmoms family. We rented big houses and stayed with my stepmom's mom and 2 sisters. We were on vacation with her sisters, cousins, aunts, nieces, etc. A big trip that was planned out for about a year. 

So when we get there we unpack our stuff, say hi to everybody, and just hang out for that night. Then we go back to our house which was only about 1 minute in walking distance, but dark as can be. So we got to bed,and then woke up to go to the beach, hang out and enjoy the beautiful day.

So now it's about 8, almost dusk i'd say, and my dad says "hey Joseph, you wanna take a ride?" I respond with eh "not really" he then says "come on lets look for the basketball courts." So I go with him and we get in the truck and explore the island for about 15 minutes. Then we go to the corner of the island where the pool, b-ball court, and tennis court is. We get there and it's about 8ish maybe a little later, a little after dusk. 

We get out of the truck to see if the pool was open but it wasn't. Out of the corner of my eye I see a trail and I start to walk it. I hear my dad shut his truck door, and look back to see that he is in his truck. I walk about 50 more feet to go around the curve but there is still a long way to go. So I walk back to get my dad, and about 3 minutes pass for me to get back to him. It's getting darker and darker as I walk. When I get to him, I say "We should walk this trail, it's huge." So we start walking and about 2 or 3 minutes later we pass the spot that I got to. Then about 30 seconds later there was rustling in the bamboo trees next to us. So we ignored it and kept walking. But then it happened again, and it was louder, we still pretty much ignored it though. We just assumed it was the breeze. Then out of nowhere a bat flies right above us. It was only about 4 or 5 feet above us. 

We then get to an area where to the right it was just a empty circle of grass. The circle was about a diameter of 100 feet maybe. Then to the left there was an abandoned trailer with some bushes and grass. The trailer was beat up, and had screws and some tools in it. I then get a feeling as if somebody was watching us. So about 10 seconds later we hear a noise and walked towards the empty circle to the right. We didn't see anything and turned around. As we turn around we see a dark gray figure that looked at us for about a second and jumped behind a bush. We were frozen in fear, because 1 The figure might have been watching us the whole time, and 2 We didn't hear it run or walk away, and 3 it looked like a dear body, but it was on 2 legs. As we started to walk away with fear , we heard something almost like a dog whimpering but a human making the sound. We look around and see nothing, and continue to walk so we can get off the trail as soon as possible. As we continue to walk the whimpering got closer, so we jogged and heard rustling in the bamboo next to us. We started full on running by that time, and we heard growling, and the rustling was very loud at this point. We got off the trail before we could find out what it really was.

So when we got back we told everybody what happened, and people either said "Oh get out of hear, you just made that up." To be honest I really wish I was making it up. I was dark gray, standing on two legs, had horns on its head, and had super tight skin. I'm just thankful I didn't really see it's face because it was too dark. But other people in the family said it was either just a deer that was sick, or a SKIN WALKER. I'm convinced it was a skinwalker because it had the same tight, dry skin, same shape head, and walked on two legs, even though it has 4. I still have the image in my head to this day.

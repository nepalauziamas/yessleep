 

Okay first of all I don't know what the fuck is happening okay and as you can see by the title maybe it's just a simple misunderstanding. Bare in mind this has happened to me before multiple times actually, where I fall asleep then I start to get these imagery of things like me, myself looking extremely different!! Sometimes I get images or clips of places too that I don't recognize and of people too that I 

don't know then sometimes I get up or wake up quickly enough before anything happens then usually, I automatically fall asleep then my entire body stop moving everywhere is dark üåë and am lying flat down on my bed üõèÔ∏è and it feels like someone or something is pinned me down. This goes on for a couple of minutes where am trying to wake up or break free from what feels like monster-like thing 

holding my entire body down and then when am successful and finally wake up am not out of Breath or anything but it feels like I've been awake the whole time like it felt sooo fucking real and this happen alot over and over again on many nights it's literally one of reasons why I don't like sleeping but this time (couple minutes ago) it was totally different. After falling asleep in front of my laptop

after watching a show, I fell asleep instead of the usually stranger like imagery, I see my myself with a monster looking face and body with people all around in a yard like am at a friend's barbecue and then everything goes black and I just start falling unable to wake up or open my eyes and instead of me usually falling on my bed with something pinning me down I am somehow in a Astro like state

and yes I know I sound crazy but anyways my body can't move while I was in this state but I couldn't see myself at all and am just floating everywhere I could move around and go through things and touch people too and like they would open there eye and look at me then fall back asleep and there was a limit to how far I could go because I tried to leave my yard and I couldn't and two dogs saw me 

and started fiercely barking at me. Everything was hazy and it felt like I wasn't in much control anyways I pick up one of the dogs cause they were getting ready to attack me so I grad the small one and fighting to break free from my grip, I don't know what the fuck got in to me but something just told me to throw him on the roof and when I did that I when back to where I was sleeping hover off 

my body and just like that I woke up not scared frightened or uneasy but just an unusual level of calmness like it just felt I don't know natural and familiar.

Soooo u y'all need to tell me what in living hell is going on cause right now I'm drinking coffee ‚òï caffeine and taking pills to never go sleep again. So, where r all Dem expert at.

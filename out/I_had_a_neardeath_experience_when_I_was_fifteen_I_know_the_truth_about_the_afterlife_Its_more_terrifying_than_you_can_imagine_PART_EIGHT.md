When we finally felt safe (for the time being anyway) we halted in the middle of the road, winded and gasping, to catch our breath. I glanced back toward the town but there was no sign of them.

I doubled over and began to retch. I felt like I was going to vomit but could only dry heave. There was nothing in my stomach to regurgitate. The last meal I had eaten had been the breakfast my mother had made for me the day before. it dawned on me suddenly that that had been the last meal I had consumed in the mortal world. And probably the last meal I would ever consume - period.

Dante was still weeping quietly. "We left him, we fuckin left him..." he kept repeating.

Aaron tried to console him. "He wanted us to leave him, Dante."

"It's my fault. I wasn't paying attention."

"Even if you hadn't hit that pothole," Aaron told him, "there's no way we could have wheeled him fast enough to outrun them. We *all* would have died. Jeff knew the risk when he volunteered. We all did."

"I don't know how much more of this shit I can take," Dante admitted. "I don't know why we're even bothering to try. I just want it to be over..."

"We *have* to stay alive," Aaron told him adamantly. "We have to fight. As long as we possibly can. You know what the alternative is."

"Maybe we really *are* dead, Aaron. You ever think of that? Maybe this is Hell."

Me and Aaron looked at him. Neither of us said anything.

"Did you see what was painted on the side of the church when we were running back through town?" Dante asked us.

"What?" Aaron asked, confused.

"There was a message painted in black on the side of the church. Probably by some poor bastard who was stuck here before us. We didn't see it the first time because it was facing the other direction. But I saw it when we were running. After Jeff died." He looked at us. "Neither of you saw it?"

Aaron and I looked at each other and shook our heads. We had been too busy running for our lives to notice. "No," I said. "what was it?"

"It said, 'GOD HAS ABANDONED US,' " Dante said.

I felt a chill creep up my spine.

Aaron glanced up at the darkening gray sky. He looked worried. "We better get moving," he said. I doubt we've got even an hour left before it gets dark."

"There's no way we'll get back to the police station before nightfall," I pointed out.

"The kid's right," Dante said, "there's not enough time."

"We'll just have to use lanterns to ward off the Lurkers," Aaron said. "I just hope the light doesn't attract any Residents on the way."

We started on the return journey to the police station. The fading light grew dimmer and dimmer. It might have been twilight but it was hard to judge the time without the sun to use for reference.

As the light failed and night began to descend I felt an increasing sense of existential dread and fear. I felt how I imagine a hunted animal might feel when it detects the scent of an approaching predator. I seemed to sense something coming awake in the encroaching darkness, seem to feel the air becoming heavier, pressing down on us with a malevolent presence, something just beyond human perception, something that was coming for us...

"Let's get the lanterns going," Aaron said, stopping and turning to Dante.

"Yeah, sure," Dante said, removing his backpack and unpacking three battery-powered Coleman LED lanterns.

"Please tell me you've got some batteries," Aaron said to him.

"You bet," Dante said, taking out a pack of D batteries. He quickly loaded the batteries into the lanterns and switched them on. I was relieved when we were bathed in a circle of bright white illumination. I seemed to feel that presence recoil from us, repelled by the light.

"Here," Dante said, handing me a lantern.

"How much further to the station?" I asked Aaron as we resumed walking.

"Maybe another hour if we don't encounter any Residents," he told me.

Something occurred to me. I remembered something from earlier. "Hey, Aaron," I said, "back when we were in town trying to get away from those things, one of them looked like it was wearing a Civil War soldier uniform."

He chuckled dryly. "Maybe the guy was into reenactments when he was alive and was buried in his costume. Or maybe he was a real Civil War soldier."

"Really?" I said, surprised. "You think that's possible?"

"Why the fuck not? Who knows how long Dead Land's been around? It's not just the recently dead who show up here. Lost souls from all eras."

"But why is everything else so modern around here? Why are there gas stations and Walmarts and--"

"Kid," he interrupted me, getting annoyed, "there's no point in questioning *anything* about this fucking place. In case you haven't noticed, there's not a lot of rhyme or reason here. Why are the cars all dead and there's no electricity but bullets and batteries still work? Why do candles and gasoline still burn? If you ask yourself too many questions, if you really stop and think about how illogical this all is, you'll drive yourself crazy. Believe me; I've seen it happen."

He had a point. We walked in silence for a while, Dante behind us.

"Aaron," I said, "I have a personal question for you...if you don't mind me asking."

"Ask, but don't expect an answer."

"Why did you try killing yourself?"

He didn't answer me right away. I wondered if maybe I'd stepped out of line. We walked for a couple more minutes, then he sighed and said: "Alright. I'll tell you. I had a girlfriend. I guess we were in love. Maybe I would have even eventually gotten around to marrying her. She was pregnant with my kid. She wanted to keep it but I wasn't ready yet. I wanted her to get rid of it. We argued, she slapped me, I lost my cool and slapped her back. She left me. Had an abortion. Met someone else. I got depressed, became a drunk. Lost my job. All my friends and family bailed out on me when I needed them. I was getting evicted from my apartment so I just said 'fuck it' and put my belt around my neck in the closet. End of story." He turned and looked at me. "Happy now?"

"I'm sorry," I muttered.

"So am I. But it doesn't change anything. I'm still here and so are you. Saying 'I'm sorry' is the cheapest sentiment in the world. It and a buck will get you a cup of coffee."

I didn't know what to say to that. We continued on our way.

It was almost fully dark now.

A while later, Aaron halted and motioned for me and Dante to stop. He peered into the darkness.

"Something up ahead," he whispered to us, then took his binoculars out of his jacket.

"What good are those going to do in the dark?" I whispered.

"These aren't the ones I used before," he explained. "I picked these up while we were at Walmart. They have night vision. Thought they might come in handy."

He raised his new binoculars and peered through them. "Shit. It's that farmhouse we passed earlier."

"Great," I murmured sarcastically.

"We definitely can't walk by it with the lanterns. They'll spot us for sure. And we sure as fuck can't turn them off...not until we get back inside the station."

"So what, the cornfield again?" I suggested.

"You got it," he told me.

We got off the road and once again skirted the farmhouse using the cornfield for cover. We got past the farmhouse and back onto the highway without incident. I looked up at the night sky. It was a solid, inky black unlike any I had ever seen, unbroken by stars or clouds. There was no sign of the moon. It was alien and frightening. I felt like I was standing on a different planet.

Sometime later I heard Dante, still behind us, groan "Oh shit," with a sound of dread in his voice. Me and Aaron turned around.

Dante was looking at the lantern in his hand. It had begun to flicker very lightly. He looked at us, scared. "The batteries are dying."

"Shit," I hissed, "already?"

"Finding good batteries is a craps shot in Dead Land," Aaron told me. "You never know how old they are. They usually don't last for long. That's why we go through them so fast."

"Have you got anymore in your pack?" I asked Dante.

"Fuck no. I thought Aaron was the one who was supposed to stock up on batteries."

I turned to Aaron who looked at me gravely. "I dumped out most of the batteries in my pack to make room for those Molotov cocktails. What about you, kid?"

I shook my head. "I lost my pack to those things when we made a run for it."

"What about candles?" Aaron asked Dante.

"Yeah, I got boxes of those," he answered.

"If the batteries in the lanterns start to go bad, we'll just have to switch to candles," he said. "Dante, stay close to us in case your lantern goes out."

We kept walking. A few minutes later I heard Dante yell "Shit!" and looked around. His lantern had died. He threw it away in disgust and we moved on, Dante being careful to stay within the circle of light from Aaron's and my lanterns. Not long after that, Aaron's lantern began to flicker just like Dante's had.

"Fuck," Aaron muttered.

"Look," I said, pointing.

Just ahead of us was the manhole we had emerged from earlier that day, marked with the big orange X Aaron had painted.

Dante laughed with relief. "Hot damn, we're in the home stretch now."

Aaron sat down his faltering lantern, knelt, and used his crowbar to pry up the manhole cover. "You first, kid," he said, indicating me. I put the handle of my lantern in my mouth and climbed down into the sewer. Dante was right behind me. At the top, Aaron, his own lantern clamped between his teeth, slid the manhole cover back in place and descended the ladder.

As he reached the bottom, his lantern, which had begun to flicker rapidly while he was still moving the manhole cover, suddenly dimmed, then went out altogether...leaving only mine.

"Motherfucker," Aaron snapped angrily and threw it away. He turned to Dante. "Let's have those candles now before the kid's lantern conks out."

Dante took a box of them out of his backpack and we each removed one.

Aaron fumbled out his Bic lighter and flicked the wheel. It sparked...but didn't light. He tried it again. And again.

"Oh, fuck, oh fuck, no, are you fucking *kidding* me?" He moaned with rising panic as he first shook the lighter, then whacked it against his leg before trying once again to light it without success. He looked at me and Dante, scared. "Out of fuel."

I looked at Dante. "You got a lighter? or matches?"

Dante, his eyes wide, shook his head.

"How far are we from the police station?" I asked Aaron.

"Just a couple miles."

"We can make it," I said. "We've still got my lantern."

And no sooner had I spoken, as if to mock our plight...my lantern began to flicker unsteadily as the batteries started to fail.

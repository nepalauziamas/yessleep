Im currently a college student on summer break. To earn money over the summer, Ive been working   Monday, Wednesday, and Friday as a package handler at Fedex, working the night shift from 3-9am. Recently with people going on vacation and ordering less, the shifts have gotten shortened to 4:30-8:00, but it still sucks.

Anyway, this past Wednesday night I woke up at 3:30 to get ready to go to work, and the first thing i did was i went outside to my pool house to grab some water out of the fridge, like I always do. When I was out there though, I noticed it was eerily...quiet. I mean, thats normal for that late at night or early in the morning depending on how you look at it, but normally I hear and see bunnies, chipmunks, toads, and other small animals moving around in the grass and bushes around me. But this time, I didnt hear or see shit. Everything around me just kind of felt still, for lack of better terms to describe the vibe. For some reason I felt uncomfortable out there this particular night, so I just grabbed a couple water bottles and went back inside as quick as I could. Right when I was about to open the back door, however, I heard a long, bloodcurdling scream from the street to my right.

It sounded like a scream of pain mixed with an aggressive, intimidating scream. Its kinda hard to describe exactly how it sounded. My yard has a tall ass fence around it, so we dont get any big animals, but theres a forest at the edge of our neighborhood so sometimes we see deers and coyotes walking around at all times of the day. Knowing that, I just assumed that the scream was the death scream of an unfortunate animal. Because its not that rare for me and my family to hear screams when wolves and coyotes catch prey near my house.

Once I went through my morning routine, I went back outside to my front yard to get in my car. The atmosphere was still really uncomfortable, and I felt even worse having no fence in my front yard. And it mightve made it worse that it was a new moon that night, so I couldnt see shit other than what the street lights lit up. I made it to my car in one piece though. To give you an idea of how I get out of my neighborhood, I usually have my car parked facing into my neighborhood, so I usually turn onto the small street to my right, and back onto another one of the main roads where I turn out of my neighborhood. I hope that make sense.

The small street I usually turn onto first is the same one I thought I heard that scream come from. It isnt very well lit, so I didnt see much other than the road. But under the street light at the end of the road, I saw 3 coyotes blocking my path. When I got close enough, they all ran into a horizontal line, all facing me and baring their teeth. I knew I'd be safe in my car, but holy shit was it an unnerving sight. As much as I hate my job, I gotta be there on time cause I dont wanna get sent home.  So since the coyotes werent moving, I decided to try to squeeze by them along the very edge of the road. Thats when it happened.

The 3 coyotes' eyes turned red, and they slowly slid sideways into eachother, not moving their legs at all. They then merged together into a gigantic humanoid creature that had to be well over 10 feet tall, with a gigantic head, red eyes with a skeleton like nose and giant, sharp teeth. Since I was in my car, I wanna say its 2 fangs were even bigger than my tires, which arenâ€™t that big but still. The creature had elf like ears, with arms the width of a tree trunk and hands that were the size of the front of my car when they were in fists. I never saw its hands not in a fist, but I can only imagine how big they were. The creature was covered in very dark gray fur as well. For a second, I just sat there frozen in fear, looking at this giant monster, which was staring at me with his fists on the ground, looking ready to pounce. I thought I was hallucinating because of how tired I was from working the shift I work, but it didnt matter. It pulled its body back and got in position to lunge at me, and I threw the car in reverse, backing down the street as fast as the small street would allow. 

Once I got back onto my street, which is a lot longer, I floored it, all while the creature chased after me running with its legs and fists. I ended up going about 60 mph down my street, a small neighborhood street that itd be stupid to drive much more than 25 on. All while this monster was right behind me the whole time. Once I got onto the main road, which was luckily empty, I probably hit about 80 or 90. Keep in mind that this is a 30 mph road, so I was fucked if the cops saw me. But Id much rather go to jail or get in a terrible car crash than get stomped or eaten or whatever by that giant thing. Luckily 90 mph was fast enough, cause the giant creature slowly got smaller in my mirror.

When the creature was far enough back, I turned onto another main road, and thats when I heard a loud, deep scream of anger from the creature.

To give you an idea of how loud it really was, I was blasting hip hop at full volume during the ride like I always do. And my windows were down. And I still hear the scream over my music and my engine. I think it even shook my car a little bit. It could probably be heard for miles and maybe into other towns. I dont know exactly how many people heard it, but what I know for sure though is that it definitely woke up everyone near there if it was that loud. Luckily I had no problems the rest of the ride and got to work alive. Scarred, but alive.

I mentioned earlier how I thought maybe I was trippin. But I dont do any drugs besides smoke a ton of weed when Im at school. There have been times in my life where Ive been so tired I saw shit, but nothing so vivid and terrifying. I told myself I was trippin tho in order to get through the shift.

After my manager sent me home, I drove back home and went on that small street on the way back just for my sanity, and I found what I think was the source of the scream I heard when I was getting ready for work. I saw a dead deer, torn into 2 pieces that were getting devoured by hundreds if not thousands of flies each. Which probably meant that this poor creature was torn in half by the creature as it screamed in unimaginable pain. Then the creature shapeshifted back into the coyotes before I encountered it.

Anyway, after I took in the sight of the dead deer, I turned back onto my street and parked my car in front of my house. Now Im really nervous to go to work again, because when I looked in my side view mirror for a split second when I parked, and shit myself when I looked at my neighbors front yard behind me. And I skipped work on Friday because of what I saw.

There were 3 coyotes, all staring right at me through the mirror. And I just know that the creature is planning to finish what it started the other night. If any of you can identify the creature, Id really appreciate it. And if I dont update yall soon, it got me. So hopefully im still alive in a little while.

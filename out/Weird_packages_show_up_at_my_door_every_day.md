For a bit of background, I recently turned 19, so I thought it’d be time to move out. I looked everywhere for a good apartment and finally found one. While good might be giving it too much credit, It’s okay at best.
I sent the landlord, which we’ll call T an email asking for more info but only got answers to half the questions, which is fine since I guess she's just busy. I decided to accept since there was no way I’d find another apartment for this cheap. A week after I sent her the email, I received the key. I packed my bags and went to my new home.

I haven’t been here for long, but as soon as I got to my apartment, things started to feel off. The key I received is rusty and greasy. The door is creaky and old. As soon as I walked into the apartment I noticed a foul smell. The air was thicker than usual. I looked around, shocked by the old look of the apartment. I went over to the fridge to put away the care package my parents had given to me. When I approached the fridge I noticed a small, yellow sticky note on the fridge door. I picked it up and started reading.

“Hello Ch4rliezard, it’s T. We talked earlier through email. I left something to drink and eat in the fridge. I hope you like it, you can call me anytime.”

In the fridge, I found a jug of orange juice and a piece of meat.

The meat smelt and looked strange, It was unedible. I instantly threw it away in disgust.

After that I went to look around the apartment a bit, the living room is connected to the kitchen, and both look a bit old and honestly disgusting. Since the apartment was so cheap I guess it’s fine for now. The bathroom is a little tiny but honestly looks better than the rest of the house. Now, for the final part of the house. My room.

My room looks surprisingly good. I decided to get some rest and deal with the rest tomorrow.

The next day I woke up to the sound of my doorbell ringing. I walked over to the door, still exhausted from moving into my first apartment. When I opened the door there was nobody. I looked down and spotted a package. I picked up the package and walked back inside. I slowly opened the package, honestly, I was kind of nervous. I finally got it fully opened and looked inside, inside there was.. nothing. It was empty. Yet, when I opened it I got this weird feeling. Every day since then I’ve been getting these strange packages, I have no idea who they’re from, or where they came from. These packages include things like pictures of me taken without my knowledge and personal belongings.

Can someone help me? Should I be worried? Who do I contact to put a stop to this?

"Lately, I've been pretty sad lately. I'm stuck playing video games, work, and college. I can barely keep up with rent, not to mention my roommate doesn't pay a dime! Well, other than that it's been going pretty well. As you all know I've recently started MyTube but already have a massive fan base! As a reward, A journal will be posted in 30 days describing how the wilderness, Come back soon on RedBit and you'll see it! Anyways, ToryTheLory out!" As i take a sigh of relief, I think to myself "Am I really doing this shit?" Oh well, I'm already deep enough. Time to please the fans.

Day 1: Morning, Pretty well. The sights are amazing! Plenty of trees and stuff here but no water, Might check somewhere else.

Day 1: Noon, Ah! I found a water source, looks like a river, Plenty of fish for food too! I think I'll try and make some makeshift tools to make shelter. 

Day 1: Evening, Shit, This stuff really is tiring! Maybe this could be a 30 day abs journal too? Hah, just kidding. I think this shelter... could work? I haven't ever went camping. All I brought was a granola bar and a water bottle... Fuck, Why did I do this. Gotta start a fire too. Hypothermia is a shitty way to go.

Day 2: Ah, everything hurts, maybe sleeping on a bunch of dirt wasn't a smart idea...  Fuck I'm hungry, gotta start hunting ASAP or I'll die out here. But how the fuck to I skin and gut an animal...?

Day 2: Noon, Ha! Caught me a little fucker, it's a fish. I think I take off the skins and guts and cook it? I have no clue. I'll just go with my gut. Fire starting here I come!

Day 2: Afternoon, I GOT A FIRE! Holy shit, finally! I'm starving like hell, and that granola bar sure as hell didn't help. 

Day 2: Evening, Hohoho, that fish was bland but sure as hell Kinda filling! Just hope no bears come out after me after they smelt fish....

Day 2: ???: what the fuck was that rustling?! Maybe it was just a fox... Monsters don't exist, Silly! I'll just go back to sleep, Out of sight, Out of mind.

Day 3: Sunrise, AGH!! My neck hurts so much! NEVER using rocks as pillows ever again... Oh well, I think I'll go explore a bit more. See what that rustling was.

Day 3: Noon, These footprints... They look, human? But at the same time like a deers.... What the fuck? 

Day 3: Noon .5, WHAT THE FUCK IS THAT? This carcass.... its mutilated?! Its organs are everywhere and it's bones are sticking out.... oh god, I think I'm gonna puke... FUCK! I heard rustling in the bushes, I'm getting away from here!

Day 5: Nothing interesting yesterday, same old same old, Boil water. Cool, Drink. Hunt, Cook, Eat, Sleep. Shit, I can't get that body out of my head! It looked like something no animal or human could do... I couldn't even tell what it was!

Day 6: AfterNoon, YES! I got a rabbit, No more fish for me! Wait... These footprints, They look, Familiar? Huh. Strange. 

Day 10: This shit gets old fast! I've been bored out of my mind for so long, It's so annoying!

Day 10: Night. Huh?... There's a tall figure, It's looks around, 8 feet?! And are those...Horns?! Oh god. What the fuck is going on here. Fuck. FUCK FUCK FUCK! just, Don't move and stay still!

Day 11: Couldn't... Sleep.... Can't sleep...

Day 13: Shit, I'm starting to get light headed. Maybe a nap will help? I haven't slept since day 10 anyways.

Day 15: Shit, out cold for two days?! Can't let that happen again. Fuck it stinks, What is that smell? 

Oh god. Oh the lord. This... bear... its been torn apart. Its head is gone, It looks rough. The paws cut and bent. The legs, Shaven and dislocated. The insides, Spewing out, God. What kind of sick thing would do this?

Day 18: I need more weapons! That thing, I can't let it get me... But where would I get any?

Day 20: *Yawn* Damn. I'm tired I think I'll take a little nap for now.

Day 20: Oh god. Its here's again. Please, god no. Fuck. FUCK! it saw me. Goddamn it. ALL THIS DUMB SHIT OVER A MYTUBE VIDEO?! Goddamn it. I need to get out of here.

Day 22: It came again last night. This time, it looked like a bear, but... so much worse. So much goddamn worse. Only 8 days left.

? ? ?.  It won't leave. God no. It knows I'm here. It won't stop. Please, Help.

? ? ?. That's it. I'm running to my car. I can't do this shit... 

? ? ?. I DID IT. IM HOME. IM OKAY.
         
? ? ?. Did someone put red eyes outside my house as a scare or?... Why is it tapping my window?

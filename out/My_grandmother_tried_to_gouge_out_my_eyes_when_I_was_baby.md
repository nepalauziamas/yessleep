When I was around twelve months old, my parents desperately needed a break. I wasn't the most docile of babies and not the quietest either. They left me in the care of my grandmother, a sweet lady in her seventies, while they went out to grab a bite to eat. 

When they went out the door, everything was still alright. My granny was holding me on her lap as she was sitting in her rocking chair, waving them goodbye. However they'd barely made it to their car when my mother noticed she had forgotten her purse inside. She excused herself to my father who told her he'd wait by the car before making her way back inside as quickly as her heels would allow it. Unlocking the door, she tried to think of the possible places she could have left it at and eventually settled for the kitchen. She opened the door and stormed inside, only to find my grandmother standing in front of the open cupboard drawer holding her cutlery, an empty spoon in her hand which she was slowly lowering down to my face. 

For a moment, my mother just stood there, unable to tear her gaze off her child sitting on the kitchen counter, completely unperturbed as her mother-in-law proceeded to carefully lift my right eyelid with her fingertips. That was when she opened her mouth and began to scream at the top of her lungs. My grandmother spun around, dropping the spoon and staggering aside as my mom lunged forward and grabbed me, bringing as much distance between us as she could without leaving the room.

"What the hell do you think you're doing?" she yelled. Or that's probably what she would have liked to ask her. In hindsight, not much came out beyond incoherent shrieking. Fortunately, my father came running in just seconds later, alerted by my mother's screams. 

"What's going on?" he asked sharply, his eyes darting between my mom and grandma. 

"She tried to gouge Judith's eyes out!" my mom whispered, looking aghast. 

My father was taken aback. Utterly confused, he turned to look at his mother. "What?" Glancing over at his wife, he added, "Is this some sort of joke?"

To their surprise however, my grandmother shook her head, and in a quiet but firm voice, she uttered, "I can explain."

"You're crazy. Leo, call the police."

"I can explain!" Grandma repeated. 

"Then do it!" my father hissed.

"It'll take a while." Grandma's voice faltered as she bent down to pick up the spoon. "I'm not crazy. I know what I'm doing."

"Leo, call the cops. *Now.*" My mom was still staring at my grandmother in utter disbelief. When dad didn't make any move to reach for the phone however, she turned to face him. "She's mental, you don't really want to listen to some sick explanation, do you?"

My father's eyes were glued to his mother. There was sadness in her gaze, but she didn't look confused. She was clear of mind, he was sure of it. With a quick wave of his hand, he motioned for them to move into the living room. While they sat down at the table, he rushed to shut the door before joining them. He rested his hand on his wife's shoulder, trying to soothe her nerves. She was shaking with rage and shock, still cradling me in her arms. She shook off his hand, glaring at him in fury.

"Nelle, please," he whispered. "I just want to hear what she has to say." 

Mom swallowed before looking up at grandma again. "Explain then," she growled, her voice as hateful as could be. 

"I was trying to protect her."

Only silence followed these words. Both Nelle and Leo were staring at the old lady with bated breath. It took her a moment to go on; to collect herself and let the last sentence sink in. 

"Look at her eyes, Leo," she said quietly. "They're green."

My father frowned. "Yes. What does it matter?"

"I can't believe you're even listening to this," my mother chimed in, but my grandma interrupted her.

"I don't know if he's seen her yet. But as long as he hasn't, there's still a chance. I know how this sounds and yes, it is cruel, but it's the only way. I was going to do it while you were gone and then get her to the hospital straight away. If you leave now, I can still do it! They'll lock me up for sure but it'll be worth it. He won't know her eyes were green. He won't be able to prove it! She'll be able to live a normal life, trust me! I love her and if it means I have to play the crazy old hag, I'll do it. So long as she's safe from him." 

"Safe from him?" Dad inquired. "Who do you mean?" 

"Don't you remember?" 

He shook his head. 

"Leo… when you were little, I used to tell you about him… a lot. Bless your heart, you never knew it was all true, did you?" She let out a dry, mirthless chuckle. "God, what have we done," she murmured.

"Who are you talking about?" Mom asked sharply.

My grandmother pressed her lips together and looked over to the window, assuring herself that the curtains were drawn. "The King of Alder. The King of…" Her voice faltered and gave out. She swallowed and straightened up. "There are powers on this earth that are too old for us to rival or fully comprehend. I think about this a lot, actually… Nelle, I swear to you I'm sorry for what I've done. Not for trying to… you know, but for what I did when I was a girl. A long time ago, long before you were born, Leo, I met one of these beings."

My father sat and listened in awe as the stories my grandmother had told him when he was little slowly inched their way into his mind again. What his mother told him next was in fact not new to his ears–he had simply forgotten about it. He had never taken these tales very seriously anyways, even though they did spook him as a kid. 

"Back when I was little, I used to live in a farmhouse with my parents. We had these two horses and one of them was mine. A smaller, really pretty white and gray mare. She was calm as a horse could be and really friendly. I named her Juniper, I still remember her very well. I loved that horse. So one day, I was around sixteen I believe, I took her for a ride into a valley nearby. We were following this mostly dry riverbed. Of course, it had been there all our lives, but I'd never thought to follow it all the way. What can I say, we had time on our hands and I finally felt old and I guess brave enough to go exploring a little. The riverbed was very long and wide and after following it for a few hours at a slow pace, we found that it led right into a forest. 

I'd never ventured that far from home before. I… should have probably turned around then. Would have been the smart thing to do. Then again, there was nothing bad to expect in those woods. We were in the middle of nowhere and up on Juniper, I was confident there weren't any wild animals that could get to me. So I just… rode on. 

The woods didn't strike me as strange at all. Not at first, that is. It was mostly alder trees though. Nothing strange still. It just got boring after a bit, I guess. Nothing but green all around so I thought I'd head back. I was almost out of there when I saw this man standing right in front of me with his back turned to me. He wasn't moving at all, but he was blocking my path. Without thinking, I called out to him. I was a polite kid, so I asked him to move. I thought it was odd, sure, but I assumed he was harmless. 

He didn't turn around, but he told me he liked my eyes. I was getting a bit uneasy, so I asked him how he'd seen them. I certainly hadn't noticed anybody on my way in, let alone have someone come close enough to make out anything particular about my face. I kid you not, he shouted back saying he'd watched me the whole time. But he could tell what color they were and when he said that, I got scared for real. I figured I could just make a run for it. If I'd ride ahead fast, he would *have* to move, and there'd be no time for him to grab me either.

I was wrong. He didn't budge, he just… *stayed* there, he didn't even bother looking over his shoulder. But Juniper stopped. She stopped right in front of him. At that point, I had lost control over her and she moved to turn around, like she wanted to get away from this guy. But then she stopped again. I looked down and I thought I could see her front hooves trembling. It was like she was trying to get her legs going again, but was forced to stay in place. She was itching to run, I knew it, but something was keeping her from taking off. And then this man turned around and… he smiled at us. 

I can't really describe him. I know what he looked like and I'd recognize him for sure if I were to see him again but I can't really… nevermind that. It's not important either, because then he started to speak. He told me to get off the horse and come to him. I said no, but then I kind of… slid off the saddle and stood on the ground; I didn't *want* to. I wasn't moving on my own accord. He was doing this to me, I knew he was. He had me walk up to him and he asked me my name. Again, I refused. I was crying by then, I think. 

I guess I knew he wasn't human? I mean, it was pretty obvious. I didn't know how bad he was just yet, but I was starting to get an idea. He asked me my name two more times before giving up. He started pacing, like he was thinking about something and couldn't stay still during. Eventually, he looked up and told me he liked my eyes. I started weeping even louder, begging him to let me go, and then he asked me what I would give him in exchange for my freedom. The bastard was enjoying it so much. I asked him what he wanted. Then he started with all that… cryptic, weird talk. 

I don't know if this was *exactly* what he asked me, but it was to the tune of "if there were to be another little girl somewhere in the future of your family, one with eyes just like yours, would you let me have her?" I told him I didn't understand so he repeated himself, and he added something like "you don't want to come with me, that means I can't have you. You're too old to take by force. I could kill you on the spot, but I couldn't take you back with me." So I asked him how I could decide over the life of somebody who wasn't even born yet, I said that every person has a will of their own and that it wouldn't be my right. It was odd but… I think he agreed with me. 

But he wasn't done yet. He asked if I would give him my family name, so if there was to be a child like he had described, he could find her and try to convince her to come with him. That was the deal. My family name in exchange for my life. 

If I hadn't agreed to his terms, I wouldn't be sitting here telling you this right now. He allowed me to return home, and I did. I never forgot him. I pretended to, sure, but I never truly did. And when I gave birth, he was there again. I spotted him looking at me rocking Leo to sleep through the window of the kid's room when he was just a little over a year. I don't know how he could tell he was a boy… probably the colors of the room, or maybe he could sense it somehow, but I swear to God I could see the disappointment plain on his face."

This is where she paused and looked up at my parents. "Look at her eyes. They're leaf green."

My mom and dad were pretty much stunned into silence. I don't know if they believed her. They would later on, but these things take time. When my grandmother went on, it was in a grave, sad voice. "Hate me if you'd like. Lord knows you've got reason to. I know it was a selfish choice, but I was a child and I wanted to live. I can't say I regret it. But this baby won't grow up to live a pleasant life, not if we don't protect her." 

And thus, it was settled. My parents were of course unwilling to let her rip out my eyes, but they swore to each other that they would not let anything happen to me. I'm very happy that that's the route they chose because writing this as an adult, I do not like my chances of survival had my grandmother gone through with that horrifying plan of hers. I would only learn of it after her death, by the way. At first, they actually thought they could get a head start on the man from the woods. I spent the following months of my life either indoors or surrounded by a tight cluster of people, and certainly nowhere near nature. 

My grandmother recorded the very story I just transcribed so we would have it saved in case something would happen to her and we should need it. I was never by myself. The rest of their conversation is my own clumsy attempt at restaging it, by the way. They moved my crib into the master bedroom so they could keep a close eye on me all the time. No windows, blinds or curtains were left open without at least two people present in the room in question.

Up until my second birthday, they actually still had a sliver of hope that the man from among the alder trees hadn't noticed me yet. But as all good things tend to do, that sliver came to an end when they found a handwritten note on their doorstep. It was written on a dried piece of what looked to be cowhide, the words carved into it. 

**"She'll be wonderful."**

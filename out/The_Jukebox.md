“I don’t know why it keeps coming back, I’ve wheeled it out a hundred times and it comes back in once I turn around. I’ve tried to break it and it won’t.”

We watched on a screen  as a man in his fifties was answering an interview on a local television show.

“Well why don’t you just close down the place?” The microphone drew close to him again

“I thought about it, but I get horrible nightmares of my family being murdered and strange thing’s happening when I do. Something bad happens when I try to interfere.”

“You heard it here folks, a jukebox that can give you treasure or tragedy . Back to you, Bob.” The interview was twenty years ago.

I don’t think I had much of a choice. My job let me go, my girlfriend left, I was desperate. Troy, David, and Dakota was riding up to this bar with me as well, all of their lives weren’t doing too hot either.

We watched youtubers and tiktok users share their experiences and a lot of the people who says they got the bad music were fine.

The way it works is that you press B6 on the jukebox. It’s the only free “song.” 
If it plays a happy piano tune or a fun beat, something good happens to you. Most say it’s wealth or fame. If you get a piano song that is untuned or sounds eerie, something bad happens. And...I just needed something good to happen .

We pull up to this dusty, old bar and there’s only one car in the parking lot. We push through the rain and I hold open the door so Dakota can wheel himself in. 

We look around the area and see some pool tables, dart boards, some furniture, and standing at the bar was an old man full of white hair and wrinkles . He was wearing a dress shirt and bow tie and was hunched over while wiping out a beer mug.

The look on his face was one of defeat, I’m sure he’s tried to beg people not to push the button before. 

He looked up at us with a lifeless expression, “it’s over there.” He nodded across the room to where an old jukebox was sitting. 

We all walked over to it and gazed in wonder.

“Who’s going first?” Asked David.

I thought about and and volunteered to do it.

I leaned in and punched in the number and closed my eyes. The music was heavenly . A beautifully piano ballad that sounded as if an angel were playing. 

I turned to the bartender who was pouring himself a shot of whiskey and taking a deep breath.

A table near by had a beautiful woman with blonde hair sitting with a martini in her hand. Her voice had a strong southern drawl.

“Check your bank account, sugar.”

I pulled out my phone and noticed my balance was for fifty million dollars. I began jumping an the guys were cheering and patting my back. I looked back and the lady was gone.

Dakota wheeled up and pushed the button again. It was also a happy sound, not the same but quite similar to mine. 

“Guys , I can feel my legs.” He stood up and began to run laps through the bar. It was amazing to see him run and jump. Tears filled our eyes.

David quickly pushed the button while we were still in awe and the lights began to dim. The piano sounded like it wasn’t tuned right and felt so eerie. We all look around and to see what “tragic” thing will happen ....nothing happened.

“Maybe I should push it again?” He began clicking the button and no more music played, he clicked rapidly and no more music came on.

Troy pushed and eerie music came back on. But this time the music sounded like a jazz rhythm and all the instruments were damaged.

I turn my head and the bartender was pouring himself another shot.

A large door opened and an arm began stretching out and grabbed Troy. The arm was ridiculously long and looked decorated in a purple suede sleeve. That hand was so big it wrapped around his whole body and he let out a scream. It started to pull back slowly and Dakota was screaming that we needed to help.

“Nothing can be done, son.” The bartender looked at us with pity.

Dakota started hitting at the hand and it released its index finger and flicked him so hard that he shot against the wall on the opposite side of the bar. 

The arm made its way into the door and the door slammed into nothingness. It was completely gone.

I yelled out with tears “Troy!”

“He’s not coming back guys. Get out of here.”

We scooped up Dakota and ran out as fast as we could and sped out of the parking lot.

Weeks have went by and I bought a nice and fancy house and the guys have been staying with me. Dakotas been busy exercising and trying to keep everything off his mind. We were grilling and drinking by the pool last night and David came sprinting back to us and was terrified. 

He’s claiming that something has been following him. I’m going to update you guys as soon as I can

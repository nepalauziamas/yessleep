My wife and I were on our way home from dinner a couple of nights ago when we first saw it. Dead center (sorry) in the yard of the first house we saw, among all of the skeletons scary giant spiders and lights was a perfect replication of a dark brown coffin. My wife looked at me and said, “Damn! I wonder where they got that. It must have been expensive!” She looked a little jealous.

Typically, we are the house on the street that goes all out with the Halloween decorations, but after a couple of bad years for work, then the pandemic, we just haven’t bee able to refresh our hurting collection. I guess some of it is also the post-pandemic malaise that we haven’t quite gotten over.

We slowly passed to admire the decorations and noticed the house next to them had the same coffin decoration as well, even though they typically don’t decorate. In fact, the coffin was the only decoration. No lights, no jack-o-lanterns, no creepy dolls. Just a dark brown coffin in the center of the yard, almost invisible in the growing dark.

As I was scowling at the creepy weirdness of just the one decoration, I heard my wife gasp, “Oh, my god.. there’s another one.” I looked ahead to the other side of the road where she was pointing. 

I stopped the car.

“Jesus fuck...”, I said, “It’s all of them!”

Staring down the empty street ahead, and down the streets to the left and right, we saw the same exact coffin in the exact center of every lawn. We turned to each other, and I’m sure my face mirrored her freaked-the-fuck-out expression.

I crept down the streets towards our home, seeing coffin after coffin. Our neighbors had begun to notice, as we saw some were peering out the window at the apparently unexpected decoration. As we passed our next-door neighbors, we saw the couple in their yard, looking down at the coffin. His expression was one of fury, but she had her hand over her mouth as her shoulders shook with sobs. She had just beaten cancer.

Their van, parked in front of the house, hid our lawn, but I knew what we were going to see before we passed it and pulled into our driveway. Seeing it, I could feel my heart race and the cold sweat trickling down my spine. Almost robotically, we grasped at each others hands and walked up to the box. 

I gave it a little shove with my foot and it didn’t budge. A harder kick, and nothing. This wasn’t some cheap-o thing from Spirit Halloween, it felt like the real thing. I held Carrie’s hand tighter and scanned up and down the street. It was completely silent expect for the quiet sobs from my neighbor. More were out looking at the coffins, some trying to open them,, some trying to move them. All to no avail.

“Let’s go inside.” The sudden suggestion from my wife made me jump and I felt a stab of ice in my heart. Normally, scaring each other is a cause for celebration, but this time...

What kind of weird-ass joke is this? I’m looking at the damned thing from my living room window, and I have no idea what to do.

Every day is the same.

I wake up at 6:30 in the morning for work, with my wife, Barbara, standing over me, handing me my morning coffee, saying good morning to me and how she's going to be off work today.

I then get up after a couple of minutes, and take a quick shower. I then leave for work at around 7:00 and get there at 7:25, taking the same route every single time. When I walk in, my co-worker Steven always walks past me, saying "Nice day out today, is it?" Even the sun is out every day, even when it should be winter.

My job is quite simple, as I'm an accountant. Even my lunch breaks are always the same. My lunch always consists of a ham & cheese sandwich, some pretzels, and a soda that I get from the vending machine.

I always work for about 10 hours with absolutely no time to take breaks and nobody around to talk to me. Everyone is always just busy working. When I try to say something to someone, they just ignore me, like everyone always did before I got stuck in this time loop, that I still don't know how it started.

My wife also sends the same texts to me at the same time every day, and she really irritates me sometimes. Her texts always say; When are you getting home tonight?" and "What are you gonna bring home for dinner?" Which I always reply to, with no response back from her.

Trust me, I've tried to kill myself before to try and break out of this time loop but I always wake up the next morning, in the *same exact day.* It's driving me nuts.

I woke up yesterday, groaning that I have to suffer through this day again. I check the time. 6:30. I look up and see Barbara smiling down at me with a cup of coffee in her hand. She hands it to me, and I take it as I sit up. I take a quick drink of it.

"Good morning, honey!" Barbara says gleefully to me, in the same manner as she's always in.

"Morning, babe," I grumpily say, taking another sip of the coffee.

"So I'm gonna be off work today, just to let you know," Barbara starts telling me. I set my coffee down on my nightstand and get up, walking past her. I've heard her say these same sentences over and over again so I started tuning her out.

"I know, babe, just let me shower," I say, walking into the bathroom. I hear Barbara leave the bedroom, not another word coming from her.

I close the bathroom door and sigh as I get undressed, getting into the shower, and turning the water on, feeling the warm water rain onto me.

I forgot how long I've been in this loop. A week? 2 weeks? A month? I lost count. I just know that I can't move on to the next day, that I can't get out of *this* specific day, no matter how hard I try.

I start thinking back on everything I've tried doing, and I figure that I'm gonna be stuck in time- or whatever was happening, forever. I wipe my face in defeat at that realization, water continuing to pour onto my eyes.

I feel something start igniting inside of me. A mixture of anger but also sadness. I didn't want to work anymore, I didn't want to see anyone, but at the same time, I knew that nothing that I did was gonna break this cycle.

That's when I got the idea.

What if I started doing things that I wouldn't normally do on this day, or even on a typical day? Something that was a... Break in the loop? That could possibly bring me out of this cycle of living the same day over and over again. I could be free.

But there was a big part of me that was doubting that it would change anything, but at least it would make my days go differently and make them at the very least more interesting.

I got out of the shower, quickly dried myself off, got dressed, and prepared for my day. I walked downstairs and went to the kitchen. I hadn't seen Barbara yet, which was normal for this day at this point. I opened the fridge and saw my lunch, which I had packed the night before this day sitting there, waiting for me to pick it up.

I shook my head and instead grabbed a string cheese, and went to the pantry and picked up a granola bar for my lunch instead. I was getting tired of having to eat the same thing every day.

A break in the loop.

I drove to work, but this time I took a route and got to the office at around 7:23.

A break in the loop.

I got out of my car and thought of Steven. I walked past the normal entrance I walk through and go through a different entrance to avoid Steven.

A break in the loop.

I get to my work area and sit down. I pull my phone out and power it off to avoid getting any texts from Barbara.

A break in the loop.

The whole day I didn't attempt to talk to anyone around me.

A break in the loop.

It felt good to have the day go somewhat more unique, even if I was still just working and was slightly more boring. However, I started getting an odd sense of there being eyes on me, an uncanny feeling, a presence on top of me. The whole time I've been in this cycle I haven't quite had this kind of feeling, and it was unnerving.

I nervously looked around at everyone else in the office, but my co-workers were still hyper-focused on their work, too busy to look back at me. That odd feeling was lingering with me for the rest of the day, though.

When it was time for my break for lunch, I went to the vending machine, but instead of getting a soda, I got a bottled water.

A break in the loop.

The rest of the day went smoothly and averagely, which was weirdly refreshing for me, considering I did things differently today, and I was kinda ready to do the same thing tomorrow- on this same day... The same, damn day.

When I got in my car to go home, I breathed a sigh of relief and powered my phone back on. I saw that I had received 3 texts from Barbara, as opposed to just the normal 2.

A break in the loop.

I got rather confused as I opened up our messages and read the third text. It read; "*Why did you take a string cheese and granola bar for lunch?*"

That's... Weird. How did she know what I took for lunch when she wasn't in the kitchen? And why would she say it like that?

A break in the loop.

I responded quickly to her text, simply saying that I wanted to try something different. That was all today was, in fact. Just doing things differently on a day that I live over and over...

A break in the loop.

I got home later, getting out of my car, twirling my house keys around my finger. I walked up to the front door of my house, inserting my keys into the lock, and opened it. I was looking forward to doing something tonight as well, besides just going right to bed, considering it was always only 6. I close the front door and see Barbara standing still at the end of the hall.

"Barbara?" I say. This was creepy. She has never done this when I get home- or ever in our entire marriage. She's always in the kitchen awaiting my arrival, not in the hall.

A break in the loop.

Barbara doesn't say anything to me. Not a "hello," not a "how was your day," just pure silence.

A break in the loop.

"Barbara, hello?" I say, walking down the hall, closer to her. She was still just standing there, doing nothing. I got in front of her and looked in her face. It was expressionless, like she was a robot and just got powered off. It was uneasy to see my wife in such a state, a state of nothingness and nothing but low mannerisms.

A break in the loop.

I surveyed my house, which was oddly more chilling tonight than I had anticipated. The vents sounded louder than usual, and the lights were lower than usual too.

A break in the loop.

I keep trying to break Barbara out of her seemingly weird condition, but I give up and walk past her into the living room.

"Screw this," I mutter, sitting down on the couch, fumbling for the TV remote in the couch cushions, before I heard Barbara's voice from the hall.

"So you're just going to ignore me?" Barbara says to me, in an annoyed tone. I look back up at her, giving a stunned look towards her.

"What the fuck are you talking about? You were literally standing still just a second ago!" I respond, continuing to try and find the TV remote. Barbara walks closer to me.

"I guess if you weren't working all the damn time and you actually cared about me, you'd pay more attention to me. You didn't even respond to my texts today!" Barbara exclaims. I get annoyed and stand up.

"I literally responded to your text when I got off work, babe. I still don't know what the fuck you're talking about. I do give a damn about you, don't ever question that,"

"You haven't been yourself lately. It's like you don't even notice me!" Barbara exclaims at me. I didn't understand what she was talking about, this has never happened in this continuous day cycle.

A break in the loop.

"Barbara, you're really annoying me right now. You're screaming at me for no reason. Please just calm down..." I try to settle her down, but I can't.

"I guess me giving you coffee this morning didn't mean anything to you? Geez, it's like you think you're living the same day over and over again or something," Barbara remarks.

"Because I am-" I stop mid-sentence, and I feel myself start to get enraged. I loved Barbara, but with the number of times I've had to live through this day, it's really made me realize just how annoying she could be, and how much she could piss me off.

I couldn't control myself at that moment. I don't think as I put both of my hands around her neck and began strangling her with all of my strength, gripping tighter and tighter. I watch as she tries to desperately get out of my grasp, gasping for air and giving me pleading eyes.

"I love you Barbara, but I just need a break from you for the night," I say as calmly as I could to her as I watch all the color drain from her eyes, her skin turning pale nimbly. She was dying as she turned numb.

I watch her arms drop from my arms down to her side slowly, her face expressionless and pale, her eyes lifeless.

I had killed my wife.

A break in the loop.

I drop her to the floor, breathing heavily. I shake my arms out and stretch my hands from the amount of power I used there. I wasn't too worried about this because I knew that she was going to be alive and well in the morning when the loop begins again, like nothing had happened. This would be forgotten.

"I'll see you tomorrow, Barbara," I say down to her lifeless body. I felt really bad knowing I did that, and I felt like a monster, but I started justifying my actions, knowing that everything would be reset tomorrow. I started dreading knowing I had to live through the same day yet again but I felt better knowing that my wife would be okay.

I went upstairs to the bedroom, got into bed, and went to sleep, my wife absent from the room.

A break in the loop.

The next morning I woke up feeling extremely groggy and tired. I rubbed my eyes and blinked a couple of times, getting used to the unfamiliar light in the room. I soon noticed that Barbara wasn't standing over me today.

A break in the loop.

My heart dropped a little bit as I checked the time on my phone.

It was 7:00. A break in the loop.

I started getting the same feeling I got in my office yesterday, that same uncanny feeling, and in an instant, I jumped out of bed and sprinted to the stairs, running down them faster than I ever had before. Something was going differently and I started getting scared and anxious knowing what I did last night, when I was thinking today would be the same day as it always was for the longest time.

I made it downstairs, and my heart dropped completely. My life shattered into pieces at once when I saw Barbara in the same place I had dropped her last night, still dead. Lifeless.

End of the loop.

It all started when I was a child, we moved into a house that the previous owners had a kid that raped and murdered a little girl and stuffed her in a pillow case and then hid her body in his closet until until his mom found her and made him "get rid of it".. 

His name was Donald but I don't know anything more about him than what she told me. I won't go into detail because I don't want to put the evil on you that he put on her, her family and myself. 

Anyways, I just assumed that this poor tortured soul was just the little girl who came with the house. I was 4-5 years old when we moved in.. she told me her name was Veronica and her throat and  tummy hurt all the time and that she wasn't supposed to talk to me. .  

We eventually moved out of the house but I always met new people wherever I went until I realized that they were actually ghosts as I grew older. Once I realized it they kinda just went away.. 

Here's the scary part.  Eventually I started hearing them while I was awake and seeing them in my dreams. Naturally I began taking an interest in religion thinking I could somehow help the situation. And that's when things took a turn for the worst. Instead of children and the elderly I started being visited by, for lack of better words angels and demons. 

One of the really scary ones that's always stuck with me wore a white cape, mask and was seemingly invincible.. know matter what I did he was always there in the shadows.

One night I almost died wrecking my motorcycle, whilst laying in a pool of my own blood on my couch I dreamed that my dog was barking at the door like someone was there. I got up, limped to the door (which had a window in it) and saw the white mask with the same red markings on it. I knew it was the demon coming to take me to hell.. 

I unloaded my .45 that I kept in a sort of key holder/letter box by my door through the window into it's chest and it just came closer. Then I grabbed the shotgun I kept behind the bookcase by the door and unloaded it into the beast as I somewhat backed it into the yard. Eventually, in my dream, I did everything but saw it's head of with my pocket knife before accepting the idea that the thing was immune to anything I had to harm it with.

At this point my immediate response was to hand it over to a higher power.. I prayed, God, if you're there I could really use some help.. shooting stars began to cross the sky and both me and the demon looked at them as they began to take the shape of a Crane. Then it started flapping it's wings before exploding into the form of a giant man with white hair and golden armor. Immediately the demon fled into the shadows and I woke up to my dog barking at the door like someone was there.

I went to the door half expecting to see the demon and was extremely grateful for it's absence. I noticed my grandmother's old Bible on the bookshelf and sat it on the arm of my couch as I limped past it and down the hallway and to the bathroom for dressings for my wounds and any type of pain killers I might have. Some time later, I eventually made it back to the couch and noticed the old Bible wasn't on the couch anymore and was somehow on my coffee table. Had I blacked out and moved it? I thought to myself..

I popped a couple more Vicodin in my mouth and washed them down with a pull of whiskey from the bottle, grabbed the old Bible and opened it up. To my amazement there were all sorts of markings in it and certain passages we're underlined and some had stars and other things drawn next to them and everything was drawn with lazer precision. In red, blue and yellow ink.. red for bad, blue for good and yellow for just kinda neutral. I was amazed and read it over and over again that night until I eventually passed out from the pills and whiskey.

When I finally woke up sometime the next afternoon I immediately opened the old Bible and was amazed that the strange writing was still there. It wasn't a dream.. I grabbed the Bible and drove down to show my mother (who lived just down the road) before taking myself to the hospital. She brushed it off and said "oh, grandma must have written in it or something" which I knew wasn't the case because I've never seen the writing in there before. 

Over the years all the red, blue and yellow writing has disappeared from that old Bible little by little and every once in a while something new will show up outlined. The other day I told my wife that story and she said that she thought I had outlined all the passages and that she just thought I was some sort of closet religious freak or something. Apparently it had been talking to her as well, I asked her to show me what she talking about and when she opened it all the outlines we're back and we both just kinda stood there in amazement and suddenly a thundering voice said,
"Now you believe"?

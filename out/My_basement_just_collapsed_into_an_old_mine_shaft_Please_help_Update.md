After returning to Gertrude’s house, [I tried my best not to think about the voice in the basement.](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/xfj454/my_basement_just_collapsed_into_an_old_mine_shaft/)

A lot of you told me to just leave the rings there. But I couldn’t. At the same time, I wasn’t going to go back alone.

It was around 6 that Roger and I made it back to the house. Some of you (/u/MarilynMonheaux, /u/No-Welcome9711, /u/D2_Lx0wse) suggested retrieving the rings with magnets, which I thought was a great idea. Unfortunately, Google claims white gold doesn’t stick to magnets.

But I did come with a rope.

I tied it tightly around my waist at the top of the stairs. “Don’t let go,” I said, handing Roger the other end.

“Are you sure you don’t want me to go down instead?”

“Oh, *now* you want to help.”

He frowned at me.

“If you fall, I won’t be able to pull you back up,” I said, flicking the light switch. Still dead. I grabbed the flashlight from the floor and clicked it on instead.

That’s something I forgot to mention before. When the collapse first happened, the lights were working in the basement… but a few hours later, they didn’t. I guess the cave-in damaged the electrical lines or something.

Roger grabbed the other end of the rope, and I started down the stairs, holding the banister in one hand and a flashlight in the other.

I could still feel the draft. A breeze of cool air, rising up from the cavern. The wood creaked underneath me with each step. I tried not to look at the hole. Tried to keep my eyes on the rings.

But I couldn’t stop myself.

I looked.

The concrete around the edge was shattered and cracked like glass. Rock and dirt cascaded deeper into the mine. The slow, steady *drip drip drip* of water echoed from deep below. The box of my childhood stuff still teetered on the edge, spilling papers and toys into the hole. A pink teddy bear sat on a rocky ledge just a few feet from the rim.

I swallowed.

Almost 150 feet deep. That’s what /u/Maleficent-Spell4170 said on my last post. That’s 15 stories—taller than the building I work in. I could imagine the hole, tunneling deep into the earth, filled with pale eyeless creatures that evolved to live in the darkness.

I took another careful step. And then another. Then I was standing on the last step. I slowly bent down to pick up the rings. My fingers were inches away—

*Scrrrtch*

A scratching sound from inside the hole.

I swiveled the flashlight to the opening. No movement. *Probably just a mouse or something.* I reached down and picked up the rings. And before I could drop them again, I put them on my finger.

I turned around and started up the stairs—

The rope went slack.

*Thump, thump, thump.* Soft sounds above me. I flicked the flashlight up—to see the end of the rope bouncing down the stairs.

*Roger let go of the rope?!*

I ran up the stairs, fear pounding through me. The wood groaned under my feet. “Roger! I *told* you not to let go! What part of that did you not understand?!”

And as my voice echoed around me, I heard it again.

The voice.

But this time, it almost sounded like my own.

It was trying to imitate me.

I forced my legs to pump harder. I finally pushed my way to the top stair and stood there, panting, my entire body drenched in cold sweat. Then I slammed the door shut and pulled the deadbolt—something I’d forgotten to do last night.

The hallway was empty.

“Roger?” I called.

No reply.

I finally untied the rope from my waist and dropped it to the ground. The other end of the rope was still in the basement; it passed underneath the door. I sighed, then cupped my hands around my mouth: “Roger! I got the rings safely, no thanks to you!”

A soft *thump* from upstairs.

*He went upstairs?!* What would he have done if the basement caved in? Left me to die? Swearing under my breath, I started for the stairs.

*Shhliip*

I whipped around.

The rope. It was slowly moving across the floor. Through the crack under the basement door.

As if something were pulling it.

I ran to the front door. I had no idea where Roger was—getting stuff from upstairs to bring to Gertrude’s?!—but I had to get out of here. “Roger? I don’t know where you are, but we got to get out of here!” I called, not expecting him to reply.

But this time, he did.

“I’m up here.”

I started to turn around… and then stopped.

There was something off about his voice. I couldn’t place exactly what it was, but something maybe about the rhythm of the consonants, the emphasis on each syllable. I paused in the foyer, my hand on the doorknob.

“Can you help me with something?” he called down.

I turned around—

The stairs were wet.

Something shiny and dark was smudged all over the wood. Like something had been dragged upstairs.

I ran. Maybe that makes me a coward, but if something had taken Roger, there was no use in me dying too. I ran out into the front yard and called 911. Within ten minutes the police were here. They barged into the house as I stood outside, holding my breath.

Fifteen minutes later, they finally came out.

“We didn’t find your husband inside.”

The officer grimaced at me. I stared up at him, trying not to cry. “What about the blood?” I whispered. “Was that… was that his?”

He shook his head. “We didn’t see any blood.”

“There was blood—on the stairs—”

“There’s nothing on the stairs. Take a look for yourself if you want.”

I did. I walked inside the house… and the stairs were clean. The rope was gone. The house was quiet and filled with natural light.

“I don’t understand,” I whispered.

The police told me that I could file a missing person’s report if my husband didn’t show up soon. They assured me that he probably just went out, probably to try and help get this place fixed up.

But I have a horrible feeling he’s never coming back.

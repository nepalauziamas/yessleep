My wife Patience and I have been together for six years, married four. Things had been going great for a very long time; I made good money working as an industrial technician while Patience worked from home, broadcasting style/fashion/beauty tips to her absurdly large number of followers on social media. Being at home also meant she was able to spend plenty of time with our three year old son, Jimmy, and we also had great support from Patience's loving parents. I felt like the luckiest man in the world.

One night, as we sat having dinner, Patience started giving me *that* look as I was telling her about how much of a dick my boss had been that day.

"You're not listening to anything I'm saying, are you?" I chuckled, setting down my fork. My wife glared hungrily across the table at me.

"I want you to *fuck* me," she whispered, then got up from the table, strolling seductively towards the stairs. It had been nearly two weeks, so I quickly downed my wine, took a couple more bites of steak, and began tearing my socks off as I dashed up the stairs.

Patience shoved me aggressively onto the bed and began to dance seductively, raising her arms in the air and swaying her hips. I looked on excitedly before something caught my attention; I glanced to my left, noticing that the curtains hadn't been drawn. Our neighbors directly across the street were at their window, Mrs. Hunt looking horrified, Mr. Hunt grinning.

"Aw shit babe, we gotta close the curtains, the Hunts can see us."

"Good. Let's give them a show," Patience cooed, suddenly yanking off her top. I didn't know what had gotten into her, but I liked it; We went at it like rabbits, neither of us caring a bit that the neighbors could see. When we finished I passed out and woke to the smell fresh pancakes the next morning.

"Dracula has risen!" said my father-in-law Bill as I walked into the kitchen. Patience and her mom Carla both laughed as I walked up and kissed Jimmy on the forehead.

"You two should go ahead and do something nice today," muttered Carla in between bites of pancakes and fried fish. "Bill and I will take care of Jimmy. Go ahead, you guys have to keep things exciting!" If only she knew.

Patience and I went shopping, got ice cream, had lunch and drinks, and eventually ended up at the movies. Sitting in the backrow, Patience decided that she wanted to have a little bit of fun during the movie.

"Absolutely no way! Babe, do you see how many people-" She put a finger to my lips and dropped to her knees, unzipping my pants. I don't know if it was the bottomless mimosas or if it was something else, but I didn't fight it and, for the first time since I was a teenager, things got hot at the movie theater. I promptly passed out after and woke up feeling groggy as hell by an usher.

Patience was not done. She ended up convincing me to take her in the backyard in broad daylight, and I was positive, from the sudden slamming of doors, that at least a few neighbors had seen us. It was only a few days later when Patience made a shocking request.

"I want Wendy to watch us fuck."

I spat out my apple juice, some of it even squirting out of my nose. "Beg your pardon?" I sputtered, wiping my face.

"Come on babe, it'll be sexy! I know you've always found her attractive."

"That's not true," I lied, as the notion of Patience's best friend being in the room with us during our intimate acts began to excite me.

"Pleeease, honey! She won't touch either of us, I swear. Just let her watch. I'll even do that thing you like." She raised her eyebrows and winked. Well, I do like that thing that she does, so I sighed and agreed. But I had rules. Jimmy had to be over at his grandparents' and the curtains had to be closed. I didn't want the neighbors thinking we were nymphomaniacs.

I admit that I was a little nervous at first, having Wendy sitting there at the foot of the bed, but Patience had a way of getting the best out of me. It was probably the best sex we've ever had, which is saying a lot; When I awoke later on, both Patience and Wendy were gone. I went to the bathroom and noticed for the first time in the mirror that I seemed to be losing weight; I was also short of breath, which was concerning. Sexy times had ended a long time ago, why the hell was I so tired? I was getting dressed when I heard the chanting downstairs. Low, slow and rhythmic, I wondered if Patience was watching a movie or something.

When I opened the bedroom door, causing it to squeak, the chanting suddenly stopped; I found Patience, her parents, and Wendy all sitting at the dining room table, all grinning up at me.

"Hey tiger! Had a good snooze? It's damn near four o'clock!" said Bill, and, checking my watch, I was surprised. How had I managed to sleep in so late? And why was Wendy still here? And the chanting...well, maybe I had imagined it. I made sure to drink plenty of coffee, because I was completely out of it.

Patience tied me to the bed that night, placing a mask over my eyes. She bit my lip, drawing blood, and poured hot candle wax into my belly button.

"Fuck babe, slow down, this is moving way too fast!" I stammered, wriggling uncomfortably.

"Oh don't you worry, I'll take it slow," she whispered into my ear, and then we got into it. We were about ten minutes in when Patience's moans seemed to get deeper, almost animalistic, and for some reason it felt as though I was floating. Something else felt...off, so, sweat rolling down my forehead, I managed to get the mask to slide off. What I saw made my heart drop down out of my belly.

Bill and Carla were sitting there watching. They weren't only watching, but they were both naked, their eyes seemingly black in the candlelight. I did what any sensible person in that situation would do. I screamed.

"Patience what the fuck! Get off of me, what the fuck are they doing in here?"

Patience leaned in close, her yellow eyes burning into mine, and I blacked out.

When I woke the next day, I wondered if I had dreamt the whole thing. There was no sign of any candles, a mask, or Patience's parents. The whole house was quiet, but my heart was still hammering against my ribcage. I felt so weak I could barely crawl out of bed. When I did, I hit my head on the corner of our end table. Groaning and bleeding, I noticed that I had seemingly knocked something loose; A little black sphere was dangling from a cord on the table. I picked it up and inspected it, realizing in horror that it was a camera.

Had Patience been recording our sessions this whole time? And if so, who the hell could she have been sending the videos to?

I didn't know if she was in the house, so I had to be quick. I yanked open her drawer and dug through her things, throwing them out onto the floor. I found a thick black book, which, when I opened it, was written in a foreign language that I had never seen before in my life.

I don't know what the hell is going on around here, but when I went downstairs I found Patience in the kitchen, broadcasting herself cooking breakfast to her followers on her phone. She grinned when she saw me at the foot of the stairs.

"Good afternoon hun! Do you mind tidying up a bit? My parents are coming."

I weighed myself on the scale and it turns out that I've definitely lost at least twenty pounds. I want to take my son and flee until I figure things out, but I am so, so tired. Maybe just a little more sexy time will bring up my spirits.

It all started four days ago. I live in a small, country town in the southern part of Alabama, and we have a population of roughly three hundred people. My house is right beside a small highway that might see forty-fifty cars a day. It was about 9:30 at night, and I was taking the garbage out to the can, like I have done many times before. It’s important to know that our closest neighbor is roughly ten miles away, and the only thing around my house is woods in every direction. I had just thrown the bag into the can, and I was headed back towards the house. As I turned, I heard this unfamiliar almost tapping sound behind me. I quickly looked back and turned on the flashlight on my phone to see what it was. At this point my dog who is usually very quiet was growling in a way I had never heard before from him. I figured it was most likely a deer or some other animal, as it’s quite common to see a variety of animals where I live. What my phone’s flashlight revealed was something I will never be able to forget.   

I saw what I believed to be a woman about 6 feet from me. I think that’s it’s important to note that I’m a 6’4 250 pound guy that isn’t the easiest person to scare. What I saw was not normal, this woman who looked a solid two feet taller than me, was walking almost robotically. It was as if her back was broken, and her torso was behind her hips. She was unnaturally pale, and she was taking the most massive, painful strides I have ever seen in my life. Without stopping, she immediately turned to me, and I saw her face. It was long, scarred up, and she had sunken in, beady eyes. When she saw me, she let out a noise that I can best describe as a grunt, and she picked up speed. This is the point where you might think I stood my ground and protected my house, or my dog jumped out and attacked her, but no, I screamed like a six year old girl and sprinted back into my house, and locked all of the doors. My dog barked all night, and at 1:33 AM, there was a single loud knock on my window. I woke up and found that all four of my tires were slashed, and my front door was unlocked. The next night at the same time, I heard a single knock at the same window.   

My dog has been missing since the second day, and last night I heard 2 knocks at the window. The cops say they won’t come back for a knock when it’s 20 minutes one way for them. I have been having nightmares about her every night, and I am still trying to figure out what I should do next. I will not go outside past dark. I am gonna do some research to try and find out what this could be. I will update if something else happens.

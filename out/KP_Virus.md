In the future, there'll be a Man. A man who we place on the lowest of the low in our hearts and minds. This one man, changed everything.


That's right, I'm another one who's claiming their from the future.


Now, I'm not going to flood you with information or bleed myself dry trying to prove to you that I am indeed from the future, that's down to you whether you believe me or not. 


I apologise if my grammar is wrong from time to time, writing in all past, present and future tenses, especially when you're from the future, it can be quite difficult to keep track sometimes.


He is born Kevin P. Michaels, but in the future, we know him as Doc.

In 2011, the scientific community was outraged that researchers had engineered a mutant version of the bird flu H5N1 that was transmitted via the air. The results sparked fears that engineered deadly diseases could inadvertently escape from the lab or be intentionally released. Covid-19 did not help matters. This was when Doc began his work.

In 2022, sudden wide spread panic occurred as an outbreak of yet another engineered disease (known as KP500-a, or just KP) was "accidentally" released by Doc and his team via powder form, that exploded in random locations all around Europe, and eventually spreading worldwide. 

It took...takes?...whatever, it took 26 months before the world was finally eradicated of the awful disease, and everyone who had been infected and was still alive, was vaccinated.

The 2022 outbreak reported that 2.4 billion people lost their lives worldwide, and a further 1.7 billion people were vaccinated. 

Unfortunately for these people, the vaccine was also engineered by Doc. Apparently, it was the only known vaccine available and it changed us in ways that I still can't comprehend.

It took just 7 days for the vaccine to mutate the human DNA and turned those poor people into, well, you're going to find this hard to believe, but trust me, it happens, they turned into some kind of demonic-looking, skinless, winged humanoids.

Within these seven days, the unfortunate patient would go through absolute hell, both physically and mentally.

Day one, the person would experience high fever, chills, headache, severe back pain, abdominal pain and violent vomiting.

On day two, these symptoms would disappear and the patient would feel better. However, just as the patient started to feel better, a rash would appear. The rash started on the face and then spread to the hands, forearms, and the main part of the body. The person would become highly contagious until the rash disappeared, and were highly irrational and delusional. They would lash out at any one who came near them, scratching and biting. If they successfully broke the skin, the next person would be doomed.

Within two days of appearance, the rash would develop into abscesses that fill with fluid and pus. The abscesses would break open and spew pus in all directions. The scabs would eventually fall off, taking all layers of skin with it.

By day 5, the patient would no longer be considered human as they rapidly grow and change their molecular structure and eventually sprout wings.

I'm sure you can imagine the terrible world we now all live in.

Doc is out there right now, creating, tweeking and engineering the fuck out of his own powdered death concoction. 

Other than his real name, we know nothing else of him or the KP disease.

My mission is to spread the word as best I can in hopes of finding and stopping him. He could be your brother, your uncle, your husband or even your son...

Is anyone brave enough to give up a loved one for the sake of the human-race?...

Can any one help before it's too late?...

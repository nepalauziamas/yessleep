I live in Texas, My parents live in New Mexico. Today i got notification from my parents saying they have 30 years together anniversary and invited me to celebrate it. I dont visit my parents very much, but this was a exception, so i started preparing on the way, (because i am a bit paranoid about getting lost while in the desert, i am always packing up some food, water and gasoline). Everything was ready, and i decided to go.

&#x200B;

first 1 hour was okay, i was going the way i should go, no problems just everything okay.

&#x200B;

after 2 hours, i got a weird feeling, no cars, no changes in the terrain, everything same like if the way was repeating, and sun started going down very fast,

&#x200B;

after 4 hours was sunset, i remeber i was going in morning, so sunset would be 6-7 hours from now, it was very weird, actually i decided to refuel the car with some packed gasoline so i dont need to refuel it at night. Also i started thinking about i turn it and go home, but i said no.

&#x200B;

6 hours and still not any cars, i am starting to feel scared, to calm myself, i decided to open up can of cola and bag of chips and start eating. also i saw something blue in the distance.

&#x200B;

8 hours and and my car showed me high engine temperature warning, looks like my engine cooling system has some problems, after half a hour, my car engine stopped working. i wasnt feeling like going into the dark but i needed to check what is going on with car engine. i saw piece of cloth blocking the wents of the engine (in the front). WHO did this, i checked the car before going out and there wasnt anything, only chance when the piece of cloth could get there was when refueling the car, but who would do it? I started to feel very weird and run into the car, locked it and started driving at full speed ahead. just to get out of this fu\*\*ing desert.

&#x200B;

FINNALY, after 9 hours i saw a car in the distance, i decided to follow the car, finnaly someone. I saw hope in getting out of this dessert.

&#x200B;

after 10 hours, the car was getting faster and i started losing it, i was driving on the highest speed but the car was faster and faster, like if something was slowing down my car, after 15 minutes, i lost the car. My only hope was gone, and my fuel was getting low so i decided to stop and refuel,

&#x200B;

When refueling, i saw 2 white dots about 50 meters away, like it were eyes in the distance. i freezed on the place, unable to move how much i was scared, after 30 seconds i decided to run into the car, also the dots were getting closer, i started driving and run over it, it was thin, high and had very long hands. i saw it running behind my car, i speeded up and after some minutes lost it behind me.  i was not going to stop riding until sun rises (if it will rise).

&#x200B;

13 hours and sun still nowhere, i am scared to stop because it could find me, and kill me. i must slow down to not run out of fuel so fast. Also i started seing some blue light far in the dessert, i was getting crazy from this all. i started to know i will die. My gas was getting low, no gas reserve. no chance to get out of this hell alive. 

&#x200B;

14 hours passed, fuel almost gone, still night, sunrise nowhere, i tried to turn on the radio but was getting just buzzing sounds except one frequention where i heard some buzz combined with random words, just as i was about to stop, i saw the thing again running at me. I kicked up the speed and lost it again behind me, after losing it behind me, the frequency started buzzing like the others. Does this means it can communicate by radio frequentions, as i was thinking about it, car ran out of fuel and stopped.

&#x200B;

i started hearing again from the radio buzz and words, there was not chance i survive. The buzz tottaly stopped and i started hearing clicking sounds on the car roof.  then i was surrounded by darkness. 

&#x200B;

I heard someone saying with deep voice: **"you humans are so stupid, you get one more chance, do not waste it!"** after that, i woke up in my bed, like it was just terrible nightmare. But then i got notification from my parents saying they have 30 years together anniversary and invited me on the party to new mexico. I was calm but then i realized... EVERYTHING!

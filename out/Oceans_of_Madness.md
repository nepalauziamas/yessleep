The waves crashed up on the shore but I was left blissfully unmolested. 

Rinse, repeat.

The repetitiveness of the rough sound was comfort. 

A hurricane was blowing in, days out still. I knew this when I came out here tonight. I wrote my mother a letter. I left my sister the keys to my apartment.

And here I was.

The beach at night. 

Unpredictable waves. 

I stretched my arms out wide and made a sand angel, all while peering up into the night sky. 

A star blinked above me, I tried to decipher it, but whatever insights it had to offer weren’t meant for me.  

Each time the waves brought water into my chest and I coughed.

Loudly. Almost as if I had hoped someone with a peculiar ear would catch the sound and rescue me.   
 Rescue me from my own demise. 

When I closed my eyes the light danced upon my brain, a sort of drunkenness. An abstractness of thought. Maybe…perhaps…possibly… if I’d had this clarity before I could have set things in order. I could have changed. I would have made things right..,

But that was maybe. And this was now.

NOW the water was warm, and it was rough. 

I shifted my gaze upwards and to the left, it was enough of a break for the water to take me.

It pulled me in.

Further than I expected. 

Wave upon wave wrecked my face.

In rapid succession. 

Left me gasping for air. 

Thinking, for a brief moment, that it would all be over quicker than I could imagine. That it would end much like it had begun --Rough and brisk--.

But this isn’t what the swell had in mind for me. 

Lashing.

The water was quick. My body nimble.

I imagined I was one with the sea, took a deep breath of seawater and hope, and fancied that I was destined for this. 

The coarseness of the water quickly disabused me of the notion.

I was in over my head. Figuratively, and quite literally. 

I flailed my arms and gasped for air.

I turned to glance back towards the shore. So distant from me now. 

I oriented my body and fortified my thoughts. I was swimming back. This was the beginning and not the end.

Lashing, after cruel lashing. The sea is a cruel mistress. 

Every time I peered towards the cream-colored hope, I found myself pulled further away from it.  

I wanted to panic, and I thought for a moment I could…that I could scream, yell, curse obscenities that the barbarous water must bear…but my cries were lost in the rumble of the impact.

My arms gave up the fight without consulting me first, they just…complied. They went listless beneath me. They were heavy and leaden with the weight of life; the sea offered them some meaning not generally known. 

My muscles knew a grief that humans weren’t meant to endure. 

But here, in the sea, in the coarseness…it was a different world. These difficulties had met their match.

Never again would I shed a tear for lost life.

The sea shall shed a million for me

Never again would I worry for fear of a loved one not returned.

The sea shall send a force to be reckoned with.

Never again will I sacrifice my one and only life to the absurdity of the waves.

The sea shall see and seek that which is freely offered, and once preyed upon it shall never let it go.

I drifted further and further out.

The cries became nothing.

The crashing waves became everything.

I’ve made my choices, and so shall you.

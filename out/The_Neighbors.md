I recently moved into a new apartment, and during some unfortunate wall repairs I came across something odd. Pages, pages, and pages of handwritten notes.

*"If you take anything away from this note,* ***don’t answer the door.***

*My name is Scott Donaldson, and I moved into this apartment with my best friends David, Matt, and Kyle. That amazing outdoor space drew us here in the first place, along with the prices and the landlord that doesn’t really care what a bunch of college aged kids do. At least, we assumed because he lives out of the state and still agreed to rent it to us. Maybe that was intentional.*

*The first week we moved in we planned on throwing a get together for our friends as a housewarming. We thought we’d invite the neighbors too, so they’d get to know us, start to like us, and mainly be more ok with it when our casual Saturday nights would turn loud. After not a single person on our floor answered our incessant knocks, we decided to just leave a note on each door. We were also going around at 11am on a Wednesday, primo work hours, so we probably shouldn't have expected much. We never thought of it again, because from what we could tell later that night the notes we left had been removed from their spots stuck on the doors.*

*The party was a huge success with our friends, we had a great turnout. It was also the first time we saw the neighbors, though. We briefly saw a group of four elderly people come out of the building on the opposite side of the outdoor area, and we yelled over for them to join us. They went back inside almost immediately.*

*The next morning, I woke up to a single knock on the front door. My head was pounding, and I guess each of us in the apartment instantaneously came to the same conclusion: to stay in bed with our hangovers and not get up and answer the door. If we were in trouble because of last night, they could leave a note or come back later, or if they wanted to introduce themselves, they could have done it last night instead of 7am in the morning!*

*Later that night we started drinking again, and honestly more heavily than the night before. We stayed up way into the night, until each of us were on the border of blacking out. Kyle may have actually blacked out, now that I think about it. Around 4am he decided he needed to “use the restroom” outside, in the outdoor area. The rest of us took that as code for “I need to puke my guts out” and all laughed as he walked out the door.*

*Matt, David and I watched him reach the outdoor area through the blinds from our window on the 4th floor, and sure enough he did puke his guts out. He also decided he wasn’t done just yet, and started unzipping his pants. At this point, we’re laughing hysterically. While he was relieving himself, the same elderly neighbors we saw the night before at the party showed up in the outdoor area, and at this point there’s no stopping the drunken laughter as we realize Kyle's about to get absolutely chewed out by the neighbors, mid piss! Sure enough, they walk up right behind him, and tap him on the shoulder.*

*When he turned around, the neighbor who tapped him on the shoulder fell down, face into the grass, even hitting Kyle on the way down. And I now know for certain know I’m going to hell for this, but we were so drunk we thought an elderly person falling down was funny.* ***We should have been paying attention.***

*Although, the laughter didn’t end there. We were in absolute hysterics because Kyle still had his zipper down and was STILL peeing, now facing the other neighbors.* ***We should have been paying attention.***

*Had we been, we would have noticed that Kyle didn’t freak out that someone caught him puking and pissing out in the open, didn’t flinch that someone just fell face first into the ground and brushed past him, and in fact, didn’t even try to zip up his pants. He just kept peeing. And the neighbors didn’t seem to mind that their friend was still lying on the ground, or that they were getting doused. The situation was a strange moment of so many things occurring, yet nothing, at the same time.*

*From our perspective, it looked like Kyle was getting the scolding of a lifetime. Too bad he probably wouldn't remember it. Eventually, the neighbors and Kyle started walking back to the complex. David, Matt and I decided maybe the night had had it’s fun, and it was time to call it. The last thing we wanted was to all be in trouble two nights in a row. This night would be solely on Kyle’s stupidity.*

*I cant remember when but I fell asleep on the couch and woke up the next morning around noon or 1pm. Two knocks came in rapid succession, followed by footsteps scurrying off. Hell if I’m going to answer that door with puke covering my shirt. I took a shower, regretted my life choices, and made some coffee for the morning to cure the banging headache.*

*I was walking to turn on the TV when I noticed the curtain was still open, and a recollection of Kyle’s fun antic returned to me. I walked up to the window to shut it and screamed. There was someone laying face down in the grass. The whole night returned to me and I immediately knew that something must be seriously wrong if that person was still out there in the same position.*

*I called 911 and they took the body away within a half hour. They obviously had questions for me, Matt, and David so we told them everything we knew, each of us filling in details as we remembered them. They were especially interested to hear what Kyle may have to say, but I tried to tell them that I’d be surprised if he remembered anything past 2am.*

*Kyle wasn’t in his room, and since I was the first one up that day and didn't see him, we figured he was out. We called his cell phone but of couse he had left it in his room, as if he couldn’t be more irresponsible. The paramedics and cops told us that they’d have more questions for us and stop in later on in the day, and to not leave town. Maybe we should have.*

*By dinner time we still hadn’t heard from Kyle. We spent the mid afternoon looking for him around the apartment complex and some of his typical stops in town, but still nothing. The cops came back by before dinner and suggested that we call his parents, who had also heard nothing. We were concerned that Kyle might be missing, but the cops said we needed to wait at least 48 hours to file a report, which still blows my mind that’s a thing in most police departments.*

*At 6:30pm 4 knocks came on the door, followed again by footsteps scurrying away. What in the world? I opened the door but saw nothing in the hallway. The day had turned into a cacophony of dealing with a dead body, our missing friend, a massive hangover, AND now some prankster in the apartment that thought the best way of introducing themselves would be to freak us the fuck out? Probably some kid from the complex having a grand old time, but damn did they choose a shitty day.*

*At 10:30 pm 8 knocks came on the door. I opened the door in just enough time to see multiple footsteps turning the corner. Not just one prankster, but multiple! They were quite quick, and they definitely didn’t want to get caught. In an effort to take our minds off Kyle and the day in general, we decided to play along with their little game. We camped out next to the door's peephole to catch the pranksters the next time they came around.*

*Only about 30 minutes later we heard their footsteps getting closer, I moved up next to the peephole right before the footsteps reached a crescendo. It all happened in the blink of an eye. One by one each of elderly residents we saw before sprinted up and smacked multiple times on the door. Damn they were quick! Except, the last member of the door knocking party was Kyle. Again it happened so fast and by the time I tried to open the door and realized the deadbolt was still locked, they were gone.*

*Kyle was with them, which was great because now we know he’s not missing! But, why was he with them? It’d been almost a day now since his little stunt outside, there’d been ambulances and cops around all day, and we’d done a full search, and we’d gotten his parents involved.*

*We ran through the halls screaming for him but saw and heard nothing. After 30 minutes of also trying to knock on every door with no response AGAIN, we gave up and called the cops and Kyle’s parents, letting them know that we saw Kyle here but he was running around the apartment complex with some older people and pranking us by knocking on our door. It was tough to convince them we were telling the truth, and they said they’d be by sometime tomorrow.*

*Again we waited by the door, this time not expecting pranksters but expecting our friend, who obviously had some explaining to do. It was Matt’s turn to wait near the door and we were ready when the footsteps quickly approached. But this time, they stopped.*

*Matt must have seen them halt right outside the door through the peephole because he jumped, and then opened the door immediately. Matt yelled “Kyle!” as the door swung fully open and instantly another one of the elderly people fell through the door, flat on their face. I saw Matt’s eye burn red, face conjoin, and a combined expression of surprise and horror immediately turn into sudden calm.*

*Something was wrong. Instinctively, and I still don’t know why, I yelled at David to shut his eyes. Whatever was happening, making eye contact was not advised. Sitting at the counter, with my eyes shut, I heard the three outside the door quickly shuffle into the apartment.  I was sitting not ten feet from the door at the apartment's bar, completely exposed. They could not have been more than a couple of feet away at certain points of their search, but I instinctively kept my eyes closed, and prayed David did the same. My only solace was that I hadn’t heard another body fall.*

*After a few minutes, the footsteps ceased, and it got eerily quiet. I heard no sounds, no wind, no hum of electricity. But you know that feeling when you’re not alone, that someone or something is very, very close even though you have no evidence to perceive them? It persisted, and so I kept my eyes shut.*

*Almost five minutes later, I heard the floor creak not three feet away. One of the neighbors was right next to me, unmoving, unspeaking, trying to not make a sound. Trying to convince me they were gone. David yelled out from the other room that he thought it was over. Before I could yell out, I heard a brief scream from David get immediately drowned out by the sound of a body hitting the floor. He must have opened his eyes.*

*I heard and felt breathing near me, this time from behind. I heard footsteps approach from the other room, ones made by heavy feet. David was always a bigger guy than most.*

*I knew I was surrounded by all four of them. I kept my eyes closed for my life. No sounds, no words, blackness, and an unnerving and dynamic stillness on the air that comes from knowing you’re not alone. Three of which likely were my friends, surrounding me, staring at me, and waiting for me to make a mistake.*

*We stayed like this for a few minutes, during which I deduced a few things. First, if they, whatever they are, wanted to take me or rather if they could take me during this state of being totally helpless, they would have done so already. Which led to #2: they can’t interact with me, at least not directly. My theory is that they win only when you see them and they see you. The older one is released, and you take their spot as one of the four. You replace them, after they replaced someone else long ago. That must have been what happened to Kyle, what happened to Matt, and what happened to David. But damn if it's going to happen to me.*

*The most exhilarating and terrifying moment of my life was standing up off that barstool and feeling my way to the door, knowing how close they were. I tripped over the body lying in the doorway, but did not open my eyes. Never.*

*I heard the footsteps. I felt them surrounding me, not following but moving with me every step I took, never changing their distance. I had only lived in the apartment for a few months, but I knew the key to my survival was my memory of the route from my apartment door to the outside. It’s a good thing that memory was well seated because I had to make it out of this place blind.*

*While I made my way down the hallway, the four stayed within arms reach of me. One, in particular, was closest. I have to imagine now that it must have been the only elderly neighbor remaining, the one that had not been replaced, having waited who knows how long for this moment. All they needed me to do was momentarily let a sliver of light pass through my eyelids, and their wait would be over.*

*But not today. I breathed the fresh air, and I was free.*

*The reason this note is here, in this room, and not on THE FUCKING FRONT TABLE YOU STUPID IDIOT WHY DIDN’T YOU JUST LEAVE THE FUCKING NOTE ON THE STUPID FUCKING TABLE AND GET THE FUCK OUT OF THERE?? YOU STUPID FUCKING FUCK . Ugh…..the reason is because the lock on the front door broke. I came into the apartment the next day, when I thought they wouldn’t be able to be around (and realizing now I had no evidence to actually support that) in order to leave this note here as a warning to the next people who came across it. Who unknowingly came into this hell as I did.*

*When I closed the front door behind me, the knocking began. They were waiting. The knocks came multiple times a second, like the four of them were in a frenzy. But, now they have the strength of my three young friends instead of the four elders they had before. As soon as I heard the deadbolt snap, I ran into my room with my eyes shut and slammed the door behind me. As I write this, I know that the only thing that separates myself from sure damnation is an inch of wood, and my eyesight. The knocking is forceful, without pattern, and endless.*

*There’s no windows large enough for a person to squeeze through in this room, only the door that the knocks are coming from. I think I can get out, just like I did before. All I have to do is close my eyes, open the door those demons are waiting right behind, and walk out of the apartment while the four follow me, breathe down my neck, and wait for me to make a mistake. Easy, right?*

*But what if I don’t make it? Who will know how it ended? Who will know the signs to GET THE FUCK OUT! What’s the point of even writing this? How would you know if I get out or if I don’t? If I do get out, I promise I will end whatever this cycle is and this will just be a fun spook story for you who are now reading this, and I hope you enjoy your life never having to know this horror.*

*If I don’t get out,* ***don’t answer the door***. *I’ll have waited a long time to get replaced."*

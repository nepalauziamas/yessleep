I’ve worked as a journalist for over 40 years. In that time I’ve had to travel all across Scotland to write pieces from the wonderful to the utmost lame. There’s been a few abnormal experiences I’ve had on my travels but there is one event in particular that has left a permanent scar. I’ve had PTSD since this event. Sporadic nightmares. To this day, I’ll never be able to comprehend and rationalise the event that happened. As I retired recently, I feel that it is a time to try my best to tell this experience. The police told me I couldn’t say anything because an active investigation took place after the experience but nothing ever came of it. So fuck it…

Working for one of the biggest publications wasn’t easy. They would often make me stay at random places all over the country to write multiple pieces. It was tiresome and lonely but it did pay well. On January 27th 1985 my work took me to Loch Ness and no, I wasn’t in search of a monster. 

Due to it being a longer job I had to stay at Glenhaven Castle for the entire week. It was a convenient location. Just a few miles away from the loch ness where I had to write multiple reports. I remember approaching the castle for the first time and being captivated by it’s beauty. Admittedly it had seen huge renovations as it was transformed into a hotel during the 1920’s. Unlike most castles which are just an awkward formation of mossy rocks, Glenhaven was perfect. A large war monument without a scratch. I soon learned that this outer perfection was a stark contrast to the events of its indoors. 

Upon entering the castle I was surprised. The front entrance was a beautiful modern social space but there was not a single person in sight. Only thing I could hear were the creaks of the wooden floorboards as I approached the check-in. After a few minutes of waiting alone a tall, slender man greeted me at the reception.

“Sorry, hope you haven’t been waiting long.” 

\- “Thats okay, I’d like to book a room for the following week.” 

“Certainly, just let me see what we have available”

As the man pulled out a notebook I couldn’t help but ask about how eerily silent the place was. 

\- “Is it always this quiet around here?” 

“Haha, yes. It’s been like this for the last few months. It’s so peaceful. I think we’ve scared people away with our ghost stories.” 

* “ghost stories?” 

The man pointed behind me to a small stand containing brochures. 

...

“Okay so…I can book you into room 8 for the week” 

The man oddly seemed uneasy when telling me this but he maintained a strong smile.

I paid the man for the room and that was that. As I turned around I grabbed one of the brochures as I wanted to learn more about the history of the castle. For a brochure it contained a smattering of information about the history of Glenhaven. I took a seat in the reception room and began to read. 

The castle boasted some of the largest prison cells and torture chambers in the entire country. It held some of the most dangerous people in the land but it did not do a good job containing them. During the late 1700’s, the Glenhaven prison riot occurred which was an event that resulted in the deaths of 53 guards. Some of the guards were dragged by the prisoners to the torture chambers to endure pain of an unprecedented level. 

The brochure was filled with cliche sayings to spook its readers. 

“Be careful, you might see a ghost around any corner.”

“Don’t leave your room after midnight.”

“Check under your beds before your sleep.”

“You’re not alone, you are always being watched.”

This made me roll my eyes. 

What did catch my eye however was the fact that this brochure claimed to have information from the logs of the previous owners. The most interesting parts of Glenhaven’s history allegedly occurred during the early 1900’s. A rich man named Charles McDunn acquired the castle and wanted to transform it into a beautiful hotel. McDunn hired workers and had a total of 16 maidens, one of which was his own daughter named Aimee. 

This is where the brochure claimed that the ghostly encounters began.

When constructing the hotel, many of the maidens reported to McDunn about hearing random nosies in the castle. One of the maidens just before midnight claimed to see a dark figure roam the hallways. The maiden peered around the corner of the dimly lit hallway to see a shadow approach every door of the maidens rooms. 

Allegedly the maiden ran downstairs to McDunn’s room however she was dismissed as crazy when trying to explain what she saw. McDunn never took any of these stories seriously. He always brushed it off as the young women being “stupid”. 

On one night in 1935, McDunn awoke to hear screaming coming from one of the upstairs rooms. He got out of bed and exited his room. As he crept up the grand staircase the screams got louder and louder. After making it to the 5th floor and looking down the hallway he could see what was happening. His daughter Aimee was standing down the corridor. She was screaming so loud her voice was beginning to break. Her head was in her hands and as she bashed her skull against the walls. There were multiple bloodstains on the walls because of the force of her movements. Some of the maidens sleeping on the same floor as her had also been woken by the screams and tried to help Aimee. She ignored their efforts just kept sprinting into the walls. 

The brochure claimed that Aimee repeatedly yelled: “MAKE IT STOP! MAKE IT STOP! MAKE IT STOP!”

McDunn began to approach Aimee from down the hallway and yelled towards her 

“Aimee! What is wrong? Calm down!”.

Suddenly, Aimee began to stop screaming. She stopped throwing herself against the walls. Slowly, she removed her bloody hands that covered her face and began to look down the hallway towards her father. McDunn couldn’t even recognise his own daughter. Her face was smattered in her own blood and her eyes were lit up with a fierce red. McDunn froze on the spot, still trying to process what was happening. Before he could do so, Aimee began to charge towards her father. McDunn could now make out her facial expression. It wasn’t an expression of sadness, nor was it one that was seeking comfort. It was an expression of anger. Aimee ran to within a few feet of her father and McDunn quickly jumped to the side. 

Aimee didn’t stop running however. 

McDunn realised now she wasn’t running towards him, she was heading towards the grand staircase. Aimee continued to run at full speed until she hit the railing of the staircase before falling over and landing 5 stories below. McDunn quickly got up and ran over to the railings. He peered over the edge and saw his daughter laying on the ground below completely disfigured. He screamed at the top of his lungs. It was stated that Aimee McDunn died upon impact of the fall. 

Following the bizarre death of his daughter McDunn fell into a bottomless pit of depression. He began to drink extreme amounts and was confused as there was no reason found for the death of his daughter. She was a perfectly fine, healthy young woman who had a night of seemingly random madness. 

A few weeks after the passing of his daughter, McDunn wished to continue improving the hotel. It was a passion he and his daughter shared. One of the few things that kept him going. During one of the early mornings of work McDunn noticed something strange. 6 of the maidens were assigned with working the kitchen however only 5 of them reported for work that day. He found that maiden Caroline Leevy had not got up for work. McDunn assumed that perhaps she was ill and went to go check on her. Caroline was located in Room 8 on the second floor. 

McDunn approached the door to her room.

\*knock\* \*knock\* 

No response. 

“Caroline it’s Charles, are you feeling okay?” 

Still no response. 

The door was still locked but McDunn of course had another key for the door. He had to get it from another maiden as maidens were trusted to use it for cleaning the rooms. After unlocking the door he slowly edged it open slowly. He then jumped back and shouted. He’d found Caroline hanging from the middle of the room. Her skin had turned a twisted grey colour and her eyes remained open yet lifeless. What was most terrifying is that allegedly her lifeless eyes were staring directly towards the doorway. Directly at McDunn. It was almost as though her corpse was staring into his soul. She had a sadness to her face that made McDunn feel responsible for what had happened.

Following the death of a second maiden in a month, one of which was his own daughter, McDunn then sold the hotel. Despite the renovations and effort he’d put into it he simply couldn’t stay there. He was haunted by the memories of Glenhaven. His own daughter charging at him like a cheetah chases it’s prey before plummeting to her death. The lifeless maiden peering into his eyes. He needed to shake it off and move on with his emotionally scarred life. 

Over 50 years on and the hotel has changed substantially. It now uses the horrors of the past to entice citizens to stay at the castle. 

“…Wow”

I thought to myself lifting my head away from the brochure for the first time in what felt like weeks. I grabbed my belongings and began to head towards my room. I still couldn’t tell if any of the stories were actually real. Part of me thought it was just some forged lore to attract weird people searching for ghosts. After making it to the second floor I then found my room. I saw the big black lettering and that’s when it hit me. 

Room 8. 

The same room where Maiden Caroline Leevy took her own life. This left me a little creeped out but I tried to not make much of it. When things happen in the distant past we tend not to relate it to ourselves. Besides I didn’t believe in ghosts or anything like that so I just tried to brush it aside. When I actually opened the door the thought hit me hard. 50 years ago a woman may have killed herself here. She was looking over at this very doorway. It was hard to shake that off. The room itself was fairly small. It had a single bed, a window, a closet and a little table which was great for my writing. I put my belongings away and got started with my writing. 

The first night I had in Glenhaven was very peaceful. I spent most of it just writing away in a little world of my own. I had no distractions and also enjoyed a nice meal provided by the kitchen staff of the hotel. This put me more at ease after reading about all the horrors of the past. 

The second day also went similar. This day however I decided to work outside as it was a rare sunny day. I even saw some other people around the building. There was a family. A mother, father and 2 children who couldn’t have been older than 12. They were playing outside which was an annoying distraction for my work but at least I wasn’t in this creepfest alone. 

During the 2nd night I remember waking up randomly to hear that someone was knocking on my door. It must’ve been 3am. Why would anyone come to my room? It was strange as the knocks were consistent. 

\*knock...knock...knock...knock...knock\*

It wasn’t like a normal knock you’d hear. If anything it sounded more like a series of consistent more muted thuds. I crept out of bed and asked 

* “Who’s there? What’s the matter?” 

As soon as I spoke the knocking stopped. You see, doors back then didn’t have any peak holes. The only way I could really see who was out there was if I peaked to look under the door. Even then I’d only see a pair of feet. I chose not to go that route and bravely edged the door open. I stepped out and looked left and right down the hallway. It was extremely dark, I could only really see the outlines of other objects such as the doors for other rooms. To my surprise there was no one there. Or at least, I couldn’t see anyone there. I decided to ignore it and go back to bed. 

The next morning I was still bewildered at what I heard the night before. I went through every possibility in my head. 

* “Maybe it was the children?” I asked myself.

Then again, not sure why they’d be up at a time like that. I got through the third day and had almost forgotten about what had happened the night before. 

On third night I awoke. To my surprise, the knocking was there again.

\*knock...knock...knock...knock...knock\* 

It creeped the hell out of me. Again I got up. As I approached the door it felt like the knocks were getting faster and louder. Almost as though it was trying to emulate the current state of my heartbeat. This time instead of calling out and asking who’s there I decided to look under the door. I expected to see the silhouette of a pair of shoes. As I got on my knees and placed my head on the floor I peaked through to see...nothing. How could I hear this knocking if no one was there? I stood up and unlocked the door but as soon as I did, the knocking stopped. I opened the door to again find no one in the hallway. Now, the knocking was beginning to annoy me. I began to consider it was maybe a fault with the door itself.

The next day I went up to the same guy that checked me in. 

I said to the tall slender man at reception: 

* “Excuse me. I keep hearing weird noises coming from my door at night. I have no idea what’s going on.”

The man gulped. 

“Ah yes, you’re from room 8...I’ll have someone down to check you’re door.

It should be fine.” He stuttered as he went along. Avoiding eye contact with me. 

The man weirded me out but he did send someone down to check the door. I decided to do some work in the mean time. Later that day when I was heading back I noticed the family I’d seen from the other day going up the grand staircase. They went all the way up to the very top so they were about 3-4 floors above me. It then hit me that it appeared that I was the only person on the second floor. I hadn’t seen a single other person despite there being a multitude of rooms on this floor. 

I went to bed for the night rather early. I remember praying to not hear the knocking at the door. I was woken not long after but I awoke not to the sound of knocking at the door. Instead, I heard running back and fourth down the hallway. At this stage, I was convinced it was the children. The parents were probably just extremely irresponsible and thought the kids would be safe in a building like this. Clearly they hadn’t read all the creepy shit that I had been reading about. Kids want to play all the time even during the night so maybe the parents just didn’t care. Without hesitation this time I got up and unlocked the door. I could still hear the thudding of someone running back and fourth down the hallway.  I opened the door, and took a few steps out of my room and again looked left and right into the dark abyss of the hallway. I couldn’t see anything nor could I hear the thudding of the shoes banging on the floor. Just as I was about to walk back into my room I tilted my head back towards the corner of the hallway.

My heart dropped. I have never ever forgotten what greeted my eyes. I could make out another outline in the darkness. This time it wasn’t the outline of a door, or a painting on the wall.

I could see the outline of a head.

You see, in the back corner of the hallway opposite the grand staircase there was a small table. It had a few random ornaments on it but it was largely just there for the aesthetic. Standing in the doorway, I could make out the silhouette of a person crouched down hiding behind this table. The only thing I could see was part of a head. I stared directly at the silhouette. My eyes began to adjust to the darkness and I could see a little clearer. Clearly enough to notice a set of eyes, glaring at me from behind the table. 

At that moment my instincts kicked in and I ran into my room, slammed the door shut and locked it. I have never felt fear like it in my life. I didn’t know what to do. Despite being a rather modern hotel for its time they didn’t have phones in the rooms. I just sat in my bed. Totally paralysed I planned on waiting till the morning. A few hours of sitting in my room with a dim light on my paranoia was at an all time high. I remember thinking that I could hear breathing coming from inside the room somewhere. I couldn’t pin point where but it just sounded so distinct even though I was fairly certain I was alone in the room. 

My paranoia was eating up at me so much that I did something pretty stupid. I decided to quickly unlock the door and make a run for the reception. I quickly unlocked the door and bolted down towards the grand staircase. I didn’t care about my surroundings I just knew I had to run. 

I ran all the way down to reception and to my surprise the tall slender man was there. It was extremely early in the morning now. In fact I don’t even know if you could call it morning.

* “You have to help me! I think there’s someone in my room. Please!”

The tall slender man looked at me with an expression of serious concern. 

“Sir are you...feeling okay?” 

* “Yes I’m okay. I’m telling you I’m being stalked by people!”

“There’s currently no one booked into your floor sir. I er...highly doubt you saw anyone during the night...”

* “I know what I saw. There was a set of eyes honing in on me from behind the table. Then I heard breathing coming from inside my room.”

The tall slender man looked at me again with a look which conflicted between fear and confusion. I took a step back and began to walk away. I realised how crazy I was beginning to sound. Knocking at the door, running in the hallway and people in the dark staring at me. No wonder he seemingly didn’t believe me. 

I hadn’t even established what was happening. It could’ve been a figure of my imagination.

It could’ve even been the children from above playing an elaborate prank on me. How would I even ask the parents about that though? 

* “Hi there, do you let your children out at 3am because I’m pretty sure they are stalking me and hiding in my closet.” 

Makes sense..

The tall slender man walked me back towards my room. He frantically checked everywhere. The table by the hallway, the closet in my room. He even checked the other rooms to see if there was anyone hiding in them. Nothing. 

I didn’t do any work on day 5. I know what you’re thinking. Why on Earth would you stay there after the previous night? Despite all that had happened and how scared I was I stuck through and decided to try and make it through night 5. I know it sounds insane but I needed to know what was going on. Was I going crazy? 

On the 5th night my plan was simple. Do not open the door until morning. No matter what I hear. If the door is locked, no one could’ve gotten inside right? I tried to sleep but I had very little success for most of the night. Eventually though, I drifted off. I began to ease my eyes open after I woke up yet again during the middle of the night. I felt this bizarre pressure on my chest almost like a heavy book was placed on top of it. When I fully opened my eyes my heart sunk

I couldn’t believe what I saw. 

The blurry silhouettes of 2 figures were standing over me in the dark. Like they were watching me sleep. I panicked but as soon as they realised that I’d noticed their existence they pushed harder into my chest. My eyes were fully open and my vision was clearer now. I’ll never be able to explain what my vision displayed. The 2 figures were dressed like...maidens. They were either side of me pushing their hands hard into my chest. I tried to fight them off but it was almost as though my limbs were paralysed. I also noticed that both of these figures were seamlessly floating. They were just floating over my body pushing their cold hands into my chest. I struggled to breathe for about 20 seconds. I tried to yell for help but as time went on my voice quietened as the air began to flee my lungs. Eventually somehow, I pushed through their grasp and managed to run for the door. Somehow, the door was unlocked and open but in this moment I didn’t even acknowledge this. I just ran as fast as I could. 

Instead of running to reception I ran out of the castle and went straight for my car. I went to the local police station during the night. I was shaking non-stop in the car. I hadn’t even thought about what happened. In this moment I just knew I had to get to the police. I arrived at the station and ran into the room. I found a man standing behind the front desk and I tried to explain what had happened. 

* “You need to help me. There’s 2 girls at Glenhaven castle and they are trying to kill me!” 

The police officer, just like the tall slender man, looked at me in utter confusion. He pointed me towards a small room where people would talk to me in more detail. As I sat down in a lonely little chair it then hit me again. This sounds insane. How on Earth will they believe me? 

2 sturdy elderly men came in. 

“Okay son, tell us all about what happened” One of the men queried. 

I then proceeded to tell them everything. The knocking on my door, the running in the hallway and the two women literally trying to squeeze the air out of my lungs. 

I spurted it all out so quickly I’m surprised the men even understood me. I expected them to tell me I was going insane. That I was drunk, high or use some other lingo to gaslight me. 

I glanced at the 2 sturdy police officers and to my surprise they didn’t do either of these. 

Instead, they looked very concerned. 

They looked at each other in a shared state of fear. My experience was pretty terrifying but I didn’t expect them to empathise this much. One of the men then left the room while the other asked me more about what had happened. 

“Did you see their faces?” 

* “No I’d just woken up so my eyesight was pretty bad” 

“How did they get into your room?”

* “I have no idea. The door was locked every night but somehow they unlocked it and got inside”

“Not to terrify you but is there any way they could’ve gotten into your room whilst you were out? Maybe earlier in the day?”

* “Well…I was out of my room during the day to write but like I said my door was locked”

“Did you check your room before you slept? Maybe your toilet? Your closet? Under your bed?”

* “No…”

“Hmm…okay well is there anything you can tell me about their overall appearance? Anything at all”

* “Well they were dressed like maidens from decades ago”

Saying this, made the police officer look at me with an even deeper expression of concern. 

“This is a weird question to ask but, did you see them...floating?” 

* “What the hell? Yes I saw them floating over me.” 

The other man then came back into the room with a series of reports. I’m not sure if they were “allowed” to do this but they then told me about some things that occurred. 

They told me that 5 years ago a middle aged woman stayed at the hotel. One night when she was in her room alone she yelled and ran out of the room and came to report something to the police. It turns out, just before the woman was about to sleep, she saw what appeared to be someone’s hand poking out from under her bed. 

More recently only 2 years ago a man in his late 20’s stayed at Glenhaven Castle. He came to the police to report about an incident where he saw 2 figures that resembled maidens standing over him in his sleep. The man said the women tried to strangle him in his sleep but he managed to get out. This second story was identical to what I had experienced. The most haunting thing about this was the location of where these events occurred.

Room 8.

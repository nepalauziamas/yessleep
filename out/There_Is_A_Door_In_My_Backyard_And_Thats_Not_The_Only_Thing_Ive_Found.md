 

My   name is Hugh and I recently moved into a nice little house in the   woods. Sadly my Grandfather passed away and I recently inherited his   money. I was the only family he had and when I was born my father left   without saying a word and it drove my mother into a deep depression   causing her to take her own life.

My   grandfather kept me and raised me by himself. My grandfather told me  my  mother loved me but her mental health wasn’t the best sadly after my   father left us. He told me he wished he could have helped her more so   that I would have had a life with her.

I’d   constantly dream about her, imagining me and her going out for walks   and doing normal mother and son things. Like going out to eat or watch   movies together.

A way to keep the   memory of her my grandfather would show me recordings of him and her   together, and even videos of her holding me singing me to sleep when I   was a baby. She was beautiful but even tho I never got to meet her my   grandfather filled in the gaps for what a parent should be to their kid.

Gramps   always took care of me and made sure I was happy. He would always buy   me anything I wanted. He spoiled me and I loved him. So it broke my   heart when he sadly passed away from lung cancer…

My   Grandfather was against smoking but he got hooked at an early age. He   would smoke at least 4 packs a day or even more. He never smoked around   me tho he was ashamed of himself. His addiction killed him but I don’t   blame him. I know he always did his best for me he just struggled with   something he got hooked too when he was just a kid.

He   always told me to live life and go explore the world. He always told  me  that I should go out and see life and nature. He always would take  me  for walks out in the woods but they would never be for too long due  to  his condition.

I love nature   honestly that’s what led me to use my inheritance to buy a large amount   of land a nice cabin to live in. The place was beautiful, nice and   rustic. My own little humble abode.

Honestly   reminded me of some kind of magical forest home. I love lord of the   rings and fantasy shit so my inner nerd geeked out. Also, somehow I   managed to even get good internet so I could still play my computer   games.

Honestly, if it wasn’t for   my Gramps I would probably be sitting in my room playing World Of   Warcraft every day avoiding the sun like a bat.

One   of the big reasons why I love the woods is the mysteries and stories   behind them. My Grandfather would tell me all kinds of stories about the   woods. Honestly, I couldn’t tell if they were true or false. He always   told me to believe in what I want and that it's my decision if I want  to  believe because if I did I would be accepting a complete world of  the  unknown. A world were science can't explain with a microscope.

Honestly,   I never understood what he was even trying to say until recently, you   see I was exploring my property since I own a large amount of land and I   discovered some weird things. To make this easy let me make a list of   things.

The first strange thing I   discovered was a door out in the woods off of one of the paths on my   property. Its a strange thing, its just a plain white door. I tried   opening it and it was locked. The first thought that came into my head   was why was this random door just in the middle of no were standing up.

Let   me explain this thing was not attached to a building or even a  doorway,  in fact, its literally just a door. Your guess is as best as  mine I  still can't figure out what the hell that is about.

Another   thing I witnessed was something that is more common to me because it  is  something my grandfather used to talk about a lot. He always told me   stories about man-eating creatures that stalked forests picking off  lost  hikers. He called these creatures Wendigo a man-eating creature  that is  caused by someone who is lost and hungry that commits  cannibalism. I’m  not exactly sure if that is the creature I saw I would  love feedback. It  had a skull of a deer as its face and walked around  with the body of a  wolf.

Honestly  I know it might  seem like I am calm cool and collected about all of  this but honestly, I  am a little freaked out. The only thing that is  keeping me from leaving  this place currently is the fact that nothing  has tried attacking me so  far.

Finally,  the last creature /  human hybrid I saw or shall I say actually got to  speak to was this  creature I’ve decided to call a seedling. They are  these little tree  type creatures that walk around and tend to the  forest. They seem to be  friendly and when discovering them in my  garden. They gave me a wooden  bowl full of blueberries.

I  was  skeptical to eat them until the little creature picked one up and  ate  one in front of me. It seemed as if the little guy couldn’t talk  but he  seemed to understand me.

I asked him where did he come from?

He   pointed to the forest and when he did I noticed he wasn’t just  pointing  at the forest he was pointing at a little tree that led a hole  into the  ground. My eyes began to completely focus on it and I saw  another one  of the little creatures.

I asked the little guy if it was its family he gave me a little thumbs up.

I also asked if it was friendly and not going to hurt me and it hugged my leg as a sign of friendship.

After   that it walked off and crawled into its little tree stump. That was a   couple of hours ago and I’m not sure what to think currently. This  place  is strange but I have never seen this kind of stuff and I don’t  think  anyone actually has. I feel like I have a connection with the  forest and  I don’t want to leave.

Well  I  should be heading off to bed its 11:53 pm and I am mentally  exhausted  from today. To whoever is reading this. Give me some info on  what I saw  and maybe what these little sapling little creatures are.  They seem to  be friendly but you can never be too sure in this world.

Well later until next time.

I’m  sorry I have not updated everyone on my situation and for people just  now reading this go refer to my previous post There Is A Door In My  Backyard Part One My  Name is Hugh and I recently bought a house in the  woods and there is  something weird going on in the forest around me.  Some of the things  I’ve encountered are friendly so far but most of  them not so much.  
I  currently have something big to talk about. The  reason I have not posted  as of recently is that I have been dealing  with so much shit I am  practically going mad.

You  see  someone came to my home, He said he read the last post I put up. I  have  no idea how he managed to get my location from a Reddit post this   situation has kinda freaked me out about posting here but he said he   wanted to investigate the woods with me. I told him no obviously and   that it isn’t safe for people and that life isn’t some silly game and   that he shouldn’t be playing ghost hunter.

To   be completely honest I just don’t like the company especially from the   likes of people who creepily find my location online and think it is   okay to come to visit me without even asking. Also, I don’t want to   disturb the seedlings because they have been working on some kind of   project in my backyard. They have been really sweet as of recently and   have even made me some pretty cool chairs and table in my backyard out   of sticks and leaves. Honestly, they are quite comfy and I don’t want to   ruin my friendship with them.

The dude seemed to have fucked off and left me alone after me telling him to leave and scaring him by telling him this.

“The   Seedlings don’t take kindly to intruders of this property. Trust me   they have even almost taken me down a couple of times thinking I was   some stranger breaking into the house when I locked my self out.”

I’m   going, to be honest, they aren’t actually vicious and them attacking  me  thinking I was an intruder when I locked my self out was true but  when  they attacked me they charged at me with little sticks and were  hitting  my legs. Luck fully the little guys are weak and I was able to  quickly  tell them it's me and that everything was fine. This is  probably  actually why they are making me so many things as of lately.  Probable to  apologize for attacking my shins.

Well,   anyways a couple of nights after he left I was getting ready for bed. I   just finished watching the new season of South Park and I was pretty   tuckered out and was ready to hit the hay. I brushed my teeth and hopped   into bed. I was asleep for maybe 4 hours at most maybe?

Until   I heard the sounds of screaming and the sound of something hitting the   side of my house. I woke up and began to freak out because the  screaming  wasn’t the kind of screaming an animal would make but the  sound of a  human.

I was pretty  tired still  but I knew I had to check on whatever was screaming and  what the hell  hit my house. The sound sounded like it came from my  backyard. I tiptoed  into my kitchen which had a window allowing me to  see into my backyard.  What I saw was not something I have ever even  heard of and I know for  damn sure this thing is not a skinwalker,  wendigo or anything else I  have ever heard of.

Standing  there  trotting in my backyard was a horse type creature it was as  black as  the night with eyes glowing a light blue. The creature had the  body of a  horse but it had 6 legs and were its head should be extruded  another  body sort of like how a Centaur would look but instead of  human arms and  a face. Bladelike arms were on it appeared to be 4  coming out of it.  Two on each side, and the face oh my god…  
The face  was the worst part  its eyes glowed a light blue but its face was  stained with blood. It  appeared to have the face of a mantis. I just  dropped to the floor after  seeing this and began to cry my self to  sleep. I had never seen  anything remotely close to something that  terrifying in my entire life.  Not even that weird wolf deer hybrid  creature scared me this bad.

I   awoke to water splashing my face I jumped back hitting my head off of   one of my cabinets in my kitchen. When I opened my eyes I realized what   splashed water on me was one of the seedlings. The one that gave me the   bowl of berries.

I looked at the   creature and I gave it a hug and began to sob. I was so happy that it   was alive and not hurt. I couldn’t imagine the only living thing living   not miles away were to die.

The seedling hugged back and I felt as sap dripped from its little hollowed eye holes.

I   got up and asked him what happened and he pointed to my notebook on my   table and gestured for me to give it to him. I listen to him wondering   why he would need it. He picked up a pen I must have dropped on the   floor and began to write. I was in shock the little guy began to write   in English. It wasn’t perfect English but it was legible kind of like   how a 2nd graders handwriting and spelling would be sloppy.

What   he wrote down has me scared I’m going, to be honest. He wrote down the   words “Tha Old Won” I asked him what he meant and he wrote down the  word  “Old God”. I’m going, to be honest, I’m still freaking out about  this  but before I had to think about the whole situation. The little  guy  wrote down the words “Follow”.

I   followed them outside to the side of my sliding glass door leaving my   kitchen entering the backyard and next to the wall plastered on my wall   was a massive bloodstain and what seemed to be a small bucket full of   red liquid with a sponge floating in the water. I knew immediately what   must have happened.

What the   creatures call the Old One must have taken the life of the man I told to   leave. He must have stayed to see the unknown but the unknown saw him   first…

I asked the little guy  what  happened to the body and he pointed to a cherry blossom tree in my   backyard. This tree was not there yesterday apparently when they found   the man's body the put his body in a hole and used his body as   fertilizer allowing the tree to grow.

After   this whole scenario with the guy dying I’m just trying to wrap my head   around everything there is more stuff I want to talk about but writing   this is just stressing me out even more and I just currently want to  go  to bed. Well anyways everyone I’m going to go to bed I need advice  on  what should I do…

Wendigos,Skinwalkers,seedlings, and gods?

This   world is a strange one, a place full of mystery. People study for all   their lives to see the stuff I have seen. Should I say I'm lucky? Could   you call this luck? People go around searching for the unknown but let   me tell you this it's just not worth it. Live your life happily remain   in the dark for the things I’ve seen this past month has completely   changed my mindset on the world and my self as a person.

My   name is Hugh and I recently bought a house in the woods and there’s   something strange going on in the woods around me. This property is   changing me. Day by day night by night I feel as if my body is changing.   I noticed I have been able to lift a lot heavier things, thing’s I   probably shouldn’t be able to lift at my size. Honestly, I have no clue   why, well anyways. Its been a month and I have been absent and have not   been able to get my posts on here this was due to my internet being  out  and me studying.

You might be   wondering what I’m studying? There creatures that inhabit these woods   and the things I’ve spotted crawling around in the forest, and the   animals, for example, are even weirder than half the monsters I have   met. Yesterday I saw this skinny pale deer just straight up standing on   two legs no clue why and I shot it. No this was not a skinwalker or a   monster just a weird deer. Your guess is as good as mine as to why it   was doing what it was doing but you know what that isn’t even remotely   close to taking the top place for the weird shit I’ve discovered this   month.

I’ll be honest since my   last post my mindset has changed massively and I don’t believe I’m   mentally okay or how should I say it stable? I’ve noticed my feelings   have begun to fade, sensitivity is almost out the window. I find that   I'm more selfish now and been focusing on my self and Charles the   seedling and yes I named him Charles. I don’t remember the last time I   talked to someone that wasn’t just someone passing through my property   lost.

I swear this place is   changing me I can hear whispers at night trying to lure me outside of my   home, I swear one of these nights they are going to take me and it's   going to be the last of me. I don’t want to leave this place behind and   leave this place to corruption.

I   have one theory of what's going on like I said I’ve been doing lots of   research of my own. My first discovery which would make a lot of sense   of why I have been changing have to do with Charles. Charles has  always  made sure I eat the berries he picks for me every day. You might  be  thinking oh that’s sweet of him to do but I believe this is for a   reason. When the man died and was barred a cherry blossom tree grew   where he was set. I believe the berries could be infused with some   magical essence by the seedlings. Maybe they are like super vitamins but   in fruit form. I’ll agree it's awesome but this theory has some dark   sides to it…

I think the whole   reason for him feeding me these are to protect me which is awesome and   sweet but I believe he's making me stronger in hopes to destroy the   corruption of the property. I don’t know if I can just run from this   madness. I feel as if it already consumed me. What if these creatures   got out? Should I just run away and let them do as they wish? No? Yes? I   don’t know? I have so many questions so little time day by day more   come more go more stay.

I’m sorry let me recollect my self.

I   think I’ve been chosen by the forest to stop whats going on. I’ve done   studies on that weird door. Me and Charles took a trip to the door, on   the way I felt a strange feeling as if something was watching me the   whole entire time. My suspicion turned out not to be paranoia because   when I turned my back a white pale creature with no face was just   standing there staring at me. I don’t mean something stupid like slender   man, this fucking thing was copying my movements and it was nude. No   way I was letting that creepy little shit follow me any further than it   already had.

I raised my hands  and  it followed I clenched my hand and blew a hole into its chest. The   thing scampered away into the woods, I was not going to take any  chances  and if anyone feels bad for the creatures I caught that fucker  eating  my internet antenna, should have gone for the head.

When   we arrived at the door I noticed there were large hoof prints on the   ground around it and bones seemed to have been scattered around it. I   reached for the door handle and it twisted and actually opened. What I   saw in the inside was a darkness I didn’t dare walk through and for fear   of my life and Charles, I closed it immediately.

I   asked Charles where it lead and he pointed to a pile of bones laying  on  the ground. I picked him up and I ran back to the house and to  people  who don’t understand I believe Charles meant that its a land of  the  dead. My theory is that all these dark entities and creatures are  all  coming from the door whenever that old god comes through.

Throughout   this month I have discovered some pretty cool things, something I   thought was evil actually turned out to be friendly and hasn’t bothered   me and that is the skinwalker. I actually met it when I was hiking to   clear my mind and it just approached me and spoke to me and introduced   its self and told me its name was Henry weirdly enough and told me he   has no plans to attack or harm me, He asked if I could just leave him be   which I have complied and me and him have not run into each other   really since.

At this point I   don’t know what to believe in, so many people say these creatures are   evil but what the hell man? Are you kidding me a friendly skinwalker I   don’t even know anymore? Due to this place being so confusing I have   decided to write my self a set of rules.

Rule 1 - If in contact with unknown creature if it is creepy shoot it

Rule 2 - If creature approaches you and could have attacked you don’t shoot it

Rule 3 - Charles must be protected at all costs due to him being my only real friend

Rule 4 - don’t go through the door

Rule 5- don’t go outside at night

So far these rules have kept me safe and I’m sticking to them.

Something   is knocking on my door I have so much to say and I fear little time.   I'll try to keep everyone updated on what's going on I have to go.

\-Hugh

Insanity extreme foolishness or irrationality or the state of being mentally ill.

Confusion   and paranoia twenty-four-seven am I going mad? I swear I heard someone   knocking at the door but when I walked outside it was just darkness. I   could have sworn I saw something but when I took out my phone and  shined  the light  I saw nothing.

Rule 5 don’t go outside, rule 5 don’t go outside, rule 5 don't go outside. This thought kept racing through my head.

How   could I forget? There are five rules five fucking rules and I screwed   it up. I could hear the sound of whispers starting to swarm around me.   Their voices ever so growing louder I have no clue what these creatures   are or even if they are some form of monster? Maybe it's just in my  head  from all this madness I’ve experienced I thought.

I   came to the realization that this wasn’t completely in my head when I   saw the shining of yellow eyes surrounding me among the tree line of my   property. I swear there could have been hundreds of eyes staring me  down  then in there. I was frozen the voices began to get louder what  was I  to do? I saw as the eyes proceeded to get closer to me until I  saw a  flash of blue came running towards me, it bit my leg and dragged  me into  the inside of my home closing the door with its back leg and  biting the  lock turning it to lock the door.

I   snapped out of my fear and whipped out the revolver I keep on me at  all  times and I heard a voice say this “ I get I’m a monster but should  you  really be pointing a gun at someone who just saved your life?”

Then   in there, I realized it was Henry the skinwalker. I asked him what was   he doing outside of my house and why there are so many eyes outside  and  what was he going to do with me.

I heard him exhale

“Listen,   son, I’ve been in these woods for a long time and I’m not too sure  what  those creatures are either. I like to refer to them as the  Gossipers,  from what I can tell they seep themselves into your mind  just from their  stare and cause you to overly stress. You can snap out  of it though if  you realize whats going on quickly enough. I was trying  to get away from  them when I found you and decided to give you a hand”

I   thanked him but noticed something strange about Henry. He somehow   managed to change his look he wasn’t like how he was before. This time   he took the appearance of a dog/ Mountain lion hybrid.

I asked him if it hurt to change and he just remained silent.

I   told him he could sleep where ever he wanted and that I was going to  go  to bed, he laid on my couch and passed out and I went to bed.

I’d   be lying if I was to say I wasn’t scared of a skinwalker sleeping in   the other room, to be honest, I was terrified but he seemed to relax and   he did save my life so my mind was shortly put to ease.

Knocking   and the sounds of voices whispering outside my window continued all   through the night, I could hear the voices playing tricks on me.   Attempting to lure me out with the voice of my grandfather.

When   morning came around I heard Henry leave my house, and when I walked   outside of my bedroom I found a note on the ground explaining to me   that, Henry couldn’t take living in this forest anymore and that these   things were driving him crazy bringing back the urges to attack people.   In fear of attacking me or the creatures of the forest, he ran off.

I   still have no seen him and have been thinking about him. A lot of his   story is completely unknown to me but this world is strange and   sometimes we don’t get all the answers when we want them.

I   talked to Charles and me and home both decided it would be a good idea   to put up some walls around my house to keep some creatures out. Since   Charles is able to manipulate nature I asked him if he could just do  it  for me.

He shook his head and  told  me and explained to the best of his ability that his powers aren’t   strong enough to do that. This caused me me to be slightly irritated. I   wasn’t upset with Charles or his friends I was upset with the fact  that I  will have to leave the house to go down to the local town. I  realize I  just have to suck it up though for my own well being and  Charles.

It  took me some time to  start up my truck because I haven't used it in so  long, No there wasn’t  anything wrong with the engine or anything it was  just that. I left  some old food in it and it has made my car smell like  the county dump.  Not my proudest moments. While waiting for my car to  air out I decided  to clean it off and spray it down since its been  collecting dust.

While  cleaning  the truck I noticed strange claw marks all over it. Anxiety  began to  consume me and I started having a slight panic attack because I  began to  fear whatever was outside must have gotten in my home and  started  tearing up my truck. But all that anxiety and stress faded when  Charles  waddled towards me holding a rat.

My   fears turned into happiness. I know this is going to sound strange but   in my garage, I had an old cage I use to have my own pet rat that  lived  in. I took the rat out of Charles's little hands and let it run  all over  me. The little guy was varied quick and friendly. I cleared  out the  cage of my previous rat and put him in it and left some food  and water  for him. A new member of the family I told Charles. He  bounced up and  down in excitement.

After  all of  that, I hopped into the truck and started it up. Charles began  to try to  climb up into my lap to ride with me but I told him he had to  stay home  because he is too big and could be spotted by people. He  then began to  shrink until he was pocket-sized. This was amazing I  didn’t even know he  could shrink or enlarge himself. I told him I guess  he could come and  he hopped into my hoodie pocket and fell asleep. The  drive was long but  soothing. Honestly, I nearly dozed off while  driving it was the first  time I felt really at peace in these woods in a  long time.

I’ve  been  experiencing nightmares almost every night. Sometimes I don’t even   dream at all anymore. The Gossipers just talk, and talk, and talk. They   try to lure me out, its like torture. It makes me feel like there is a   hole in my chest because they just use the voices of my Grandfather I   can hear him screaming my name for help and it just hurts so bad.

The   ride soothed my mind and I felt all my anxiety melt away for a while  it  was just me, Charles, and the road into town. I saw the place I  needed  to go and purchased as much wood as I could fit in the back of  my truck.

I  decided to walk  through the town and check out the local stores, I  purchased some  things but when waiting at the register for the woman to  put all my  stuff in bags. I looked at a board that was put up and  covering it was  the names and faces of missing people. This caused me to  have a  flashback to when I found the door and there were bones  scattered all  around it.

I didn’t  realize the  corruption had spread all the way to the town. I should have  realized  all those bones couldn’t be coming from just lost hikers. I  mean I  thought at least some of it could have been from animals but  this. This  just proves it. Those monsters are coming into this town  taking  things. I was wondering why there are so few people around town.

I   felt Charles begin to wake up and he tugged at me through my pocket. I   could tell there was something wrong and that he wanted to leave. I  went  back into my truck and me and Charles began to drive away.

But…

Someone   began to tail us, they were speeding upon us and I floured it I began   to speed all through the windy roads leading back to my house. When I   turned around whoever was chasing me was gone. It was close to 9 pm and   the dark had already set around me and Charles. I made it into the  house  and here I am writing this now.

Today   has been exhausting and I can hear the whispers of the Gossipers   beginning to start. I’m just going to put on some Netflix and try to   fall asleep.

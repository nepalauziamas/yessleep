The amount of blood in this animal shelter was… uncomfortable.

“Damn. You weren’t lying, Ki-Ki.” Danny said.

“Don’t call me that.”

“Okay, as if your weird codename is any better.”

There were too many bodies. Well, there were before, but the police had removed them already, leaving outlines in their place. I had already made a visit at two in the morning the prior day. The bodies *were* there then. There were seven employees working the night it had happened. None of them had made it home that night. It was gruesome. The wounds on the bodies were animalistic. Some of them weren't even in one piece, which was indicated in the outlines the police laid down.

But only the bodies of the *employees* had been removed. The bodies of the animals had been left to rot. There were just too many to clear out in a timely manner. The decay in the air was palpable.

“Listen, ‘K, I’ve been on a lot of bad jobs, but this takes the cake.”

I turned towards her, “Do you ever stop talking?”

She frowned. “That’s no way to treat your partner.”

“You’re not my partner.”

“Well, we’re investigating this messed up dog pound together. But, you’re also paying me to be here, so maybe this is more of an employer-slash-employee relationship…”

I was beginning to wonder if contracting Ms. Danielle Hyde had been good idea or not.

After the events in my first post, I reached out to some of my contacts from college. Most of them weren’t thrilled to hear from me, but one of them recommended Ms. Hyde. She was someone who specialized in “investigating and resolving anomalous situations”... whatever that meant. But, as vague as it was, the friend who recommended her was solid, and I was beginning to think that I was out of my depth.

While most things in this world follow the set of rules that we collectively understand, there are *some* things that just don’t. I know that from experience, unfortunately. Disregarding my personal issue, however, I haven’t actually had many encounters with the anomalous, and with this dog situation involving more people than myself, I didn’t want to be caught off guard.

There are multiple answers to what could have happened at the shelter, and many of them don’t involve anything preternatural. One of you had also suggested that there was a tracking device planted in the dog, and while I wish it was that simple, I knew that it wasn’t. There isn’t anyone in this town who would do something as… unprofessional as turning an animal shelter into a slaughterhouse. Not if they wanted to live. And the only one in a position to plant a device in the dog was also the one who tasked me with finding it: it’s owner.

While I won’t get into the details of our arrangement, I’ve been employed by this individual for a few months now. Discretion is best for my employer, as he did not enjoy the limelight. Because of this I left the dog at the shelter so that my employer could retrieve it without having to meet in person. It was public, unlikely to be hit, and it wasn’t suspicious. The only reason to go to a shelter was to pick up a dog. But now the dog was missing. Again. And I promised my employer that I was going to make it un-missing. I didn’t like breaking my promises. So I contacted Hyde and we agreed to meet at an establishment that I frequent.

I walked into the *Bottoms Up* Bar & Grill about thirty minutes before I was supposed to meet Ms. Hyde. I walked towards the back, passing a few of the regulars, but there was already someone seated at our agreed-upon table. I eyed the bartender, Bert. I had told him to keep that table clear, but it was fine. The person would leave when I approached. Most did. But as I got closer the person, a woman, turned, and an expression of bemusement washed over her face. She smiled and waved.

As it turned out, Ms. Hyde enjoyed showing up early.

“You must be him,” she said as I sat down, “do they usually let people in masks just walk in?”

“I did the owner a favor once.” I answered, “You must be Ms. Hyde.”

“Call me Danny.” She offered her hand.

I looked at her. “Let’s get down to business, if you don’t mind.”

“Um, sure.” She withdrew her offer of a handshake, “Explain away.”

I had left my reasons for hiring her vague when contacting her, so I obliged and explained the situation.

After I was done she stared at me.

“A dog?”

“Yes.”

“And you think it just… escaped from the shelter.”

“I do. Based on the facts, am I wrong for suspecting?”

“Not necessarily,” she said pensively. “It isn’t out of the realm of possibility, assuming that this dog of yours isn’t what it seems, but that would leave something unexplained.”

“And what would that be?”

She looked at me. “If it was able to escape the shelter, then why didn’t it just escape the safehouse you mentioned?”

I hadn’t thought of that.

The crate they had kept it in wasn’t exactly special-grade. “I don’t know, Ms. Hyde, but–”

“Danny,” she interjected, “you can just call me Danny.”

“...Danny… there is no conceivable way that someone could have found it at the shelter before its rightful owner.”

“How do you know it wasn’t the owner, then?” she asked, glaring.

I glared back. “It was the *dog*. Now, if you’re unable to assist me, then I think our business here is–”

“Woah,” she said, backing off, “there’s no need to play the leaving game. I think I can help. But I’ll need to see the shelter. And, as for payment, I agree to the amount you offered, but I’ll need something else as well.”

Here we go. “And what is that, Ms.… Danny?”

“I need a favor from you.”

“...what favor?”

“I need your expertise for a case of mine. Just one. That’s it.”

I hesitated. I *did* need her, and if the favor she wanted was something I’d rather not do then it wasn’t like she could force me to without a lot of effort. And risk.

“...Fine.” I told her.

“Great. Alright, then. Let’s go to this dog pound of yours,” she said, and we got up to go. “Oh, and what should I call you?”

I turned to her.

“Ink.”

“...’Ink’? Like what you write with?”

“Yes.”

She paused for a moment, “O–kay…”

We left *Bottoms Up* and walked the couple blocks to where I parked my car. I noticed Danny staring at me.

“Do you have something you’d like to say?” I asked her.

“Yeah, do you just… walk around in broad daylight like that?” She gestured to my suit and mask.

“Yes.”

“And the police don’t find that… suspicious?”

“Danny, would you like to know a little fact about this town?”

“Um, sure?”

“The police and my employer have a similar interest: keeping crime, especially *violent* crime, off the streets. Now, do you think that the police would interfere with an employee of someone like that?”

She looked at me, “I guess they wouldn’t,” she paused, “but, if it was your employer’s ‘dog’, then how come you weren’t filled in about what it could do?”

“I… don’t know.”

She made a good point. I don’t often take orders from my employer directly, but it was unusual for this much information to be left unsaid.

“Well, *that’s* reassuring,” Danny muttered.

We were slowly making our way through the animal shelter later that night and, while she was chipper on our way over, Danny was quiet now, which was good. Maybe it was focus, maybe she just didn’t like seeing dead dogs. Either way, I was glad. I didn’t enjoy making conversation.

Danny was examining the wounds on the dead dogs; she took pictures and collected tissue samples off of most, if not all, of the corpses. As we continued deeper into the building she stopped me.

“This looks like where they kept it,” she said. “You can tell based on the bending of the bars… and the remains.”

I came over and looked. It was a large cage that stretched up to the ceiling. A holding area for multiple animals. The gate was ripped open, with the bars bent outwards. However, the inside was the most eye-catching aspect.

The floor was caked in gore and viscera. I could make out remains belonging to at least four different animals.

“I’m sorry I ever doubted you, Inky-Boy. There’s definitely *something* supernatural at play here.”

I ignored the stupid nickname. “I knew that already.” I said, “That's why I called you. Now, do you have any insight that would be *useful* to our current situation?”

She glared at me. “First of all, ouch. Second of all, yes. Despite your need for a better attitude, I do have some ‘useful insight’.” She reached down and picked up a bloody piece of metal with a pair of tweezers. “It’s a dog, right? We can assume that, despite its unnatural ability to shred it’s fellow dogs to pieces, it’s mind is still feral in nature.”

“As opposed to its mind being…?”

“Logical. Calculating. If it was smart it wouldn’t have waited until it was in a cage to break out. It would’ve done it when it was being weighed, or fed, or whatever they do at animal shelters.”

“And… why are we assuming that this thing could think logically?”

She put the object in a plastic bag. “My area of expertise, remember?”

“Right.”

“Anyways, the point is that if this thing escaped, it's not like it got on the freeway and down to the nearest overnight motel. It's probably still relatively close. I’m thinking in the woods out back.”

“Good. Let’s go, then.”

“Not so fast,” she said, “we need to make sure we’re on the same page before we do.”

I looked at her. “How so?”

“Do you want this thing captured or killed? From what I can infer…” she held up the bag with the piece of metal in it, “either would be difficult.”

It was a bullet casing. I looked at the ground, and there were more casings among the gore. A concerning amount more.

“I need it alive. I thought that was clear.”

She sighed. “It was, but I’m now officially worried about our survivability here. This thing looks serious.”

She was right.

“Have you dealt with something this strong before?” I asked.

“It’s hard to say. We now officially know that this thing is probably bullet-proof. *Minimum*. But that doesn’t mean that’s all it’s good for. It could be stronger than that.”

I looked at her. “What are the odds of it being too much to handle, do you think?”

“Likely. At least tonight. I only brought the duffel bag in the car and half the stuff in it is designed to do damage. I would be concerned even if we didn’t have to hold back.”

She was right. It was a risk. However, time was fleeting, and I had already lost the dog once by leaving it here. Not to mention the unnecessary casualties…

“It was docile when I retrieved it,” I said, “even after I had dealt with an opponent in front of it. We go looking.”

“Okay…” she said, steeling herself, “but don’t say I didn’t warn you.”

Once we had gotten to the car, Danny turned to me.

“The deal with any anomalous situation”, she explained, “is that you can’t rely on what makes sense. Just because you shoot something doesn’t mean that it’ll die. However, in my line of work there is usually some kind of unconventional ruleset or condition anomalous entities will tend to follow. That being said, I’ve brought some equipment that may help us.”

She had taken the duffel bag she brought out of the car and pulled out two things. “This net and this animal-catching-stick… leash… thing… are laced with materials that, for whatever reason, are far more durable than they should be.” She handed me the animal-control stick. “Net-throwing is more skillful than you’d think. And I’ve had more experience throwing nets than you’d think, so you take the stick.”

I stared. “I have questions about many of the things you just said, but they can wait.”

“Good.”, she said, “There’s more here that I brought, but, again, they all could hurt or kill the dog one way or another… I do have to ask though. Do you have a plan if this thing is too much to handle?”

“We’re going to capture it. Alive.”

She looked reproachful. “Listen, Ink. I get that you have a job to do, but if we can’t get this under control, and if it’s the ‘dog’ or me... I’m choosing me. Do you understand?”

I turned towards her. “I understand your motivation to leave here alive, and I understand, from what you’ve said, that there is risk and uncertainty here. But do *you* understand what will happen if you kill the animal when it could have been saved?”

She stared at me. “I do.”

“Good. Then we’re on the same page.”

The night was cloudy and the shelter was a little while away from town. This meant that there was hardly any natural light other than from our flashlights. However, as we walked into the woods, you could clearly see the outline of the tree tops against the black sky. The silhouette of the trees was an oppressive stain against the night sky that slowly swallowed us with each step we took. Our flashlights were strong, yet the trees and foliage still made it so that their beams didn’t cut very far. Danny checked for tracks, but so far she hadn’t seen anything canine. With no means of direct tracking, the best we could do was just walk.

This was a regrettable scenario. I considered whether or not I made the right call sending the dog to the shelter. If I had kept it with me would none of this have happened, or would something still have enraged it? What then? Would I have been able to contain whatever it was, or would I have had to kill it?

Would I have even been able to?

I was pondering these questions when Danny spoke.

“Can I tell you something?”

I looked ahead. “Sure.”

“You’re not what I expected if I’m being honest.”

“You’ve heard of me before?”

“Yeah,” she replied, “your whole incident at the tower turned a lot of heads.”

I glanced at her. “‘Incident at the tower’?”

“No need to play dumb, your college friend told me. ‘Hey, you remember the guy who stormed that skyscraper? Yeah I knew him once and he called me up asking for someone with your skill set’. I’m paraphrasing, but that’s basically what he opened with.”

“Interesting. Maybe I should remind him how uncourteous it is to tie old friends to high-profile criminal activity.”

“Eh. Maybe. But it didn’t deter me, did it? It almost made me more motivated to accept your offer. Didn’t seem smart to get on the bad side of someone like that.”

“Either way, why tell me that?”

She looked over. “I don’t know… I guess, from what I’ve heard about you, you didn’t seem like the type to seek employment in organized crime.”

I looked at her again. “Who said anything about organized crime?”

She glared. “Please. You implied it.”

I looked back forward. “My employer, whom you shouldn’t make assumptions about, has beliefs that align with mine.”

“I’m afraid to ask, but what beliefs?”

“...Ones that don’t concern you.”

She paused, “Ah, so it’s gonna be like that.”

I turned to her, “Like what?” I asked.

“Nothing, nothing. Just trying to make conversation.”

I felt my face settle into a deeper frown under my mask.

We walked in silence for about fifteen minutes when Danny stopped.

“Hold on, here’s something dog-ish. Follow me, we should stick together.”

I looked over at her. She had walked off the path where there seemed to be evidence of a skirmish. I followed.

“There’s blood,” she said, “be ready, it seems kind of fresh.”

I felt the gun in my jacket. It was the same, silenced one I had used the other night. Danny did have a point about the risk in us going out here, and I wasn’t stupid. I was beginning to seriously wonder why my employer wouldn’t have warned me about his pet’s capabilities. Did he think that this thing was so well trained that it wouldn’t snap? Not even once? Surely it wasn’t so dangerous that he thought I would be overwhelmed by it. But in that case how was it able to slaughter countless dogs and seven employees, one of which was armed?

Danny had gotten several yards ahead of me when I heard the snap of a twig to my right.

I turned immediately, shining my flashlight in the direction of the sound.

The dog.

It was staring at me, about six yards away.

I blinked and, and… wait.

The glare… it…

It wasn’t there.

I shone my flashlight around. There was nowhere it could have ran off to that quickly. And there was no noise of it moving after the initial twig breaking.

I ran over to where I had seen the dog.

“Ink? Where are you going?” Danny called.

I ignored her. I had seen it clear as day – what *happened?* If this was something involving *him*…

When I got to the spot I stopped.

The dog… it was there. But…

Noise behind me. I whipped around.

“Fuck!” Danny yelled, “Put the *gun* away, it's me!”

Gun? I looked toward my arm. I hadn’t even realized that I drew it.

She stared daggers at me. “What the hell did you come running over here for any– oh… *shit.*”

At my feet laid the body of the Australian shepherd I had rescued from the safehouse.

“Well, that’s not good,” Danny muttered as she squatted down to examine it. “Hey, someone cut off its left ear.”

I turned to her. “Someone…?”

“It’s a clean, even cut. Not by accident.”

If it wasn’t for the distinctive pattern on that type of dog, the body would have been almost unrecognizable. It had rained recently and the dog must have been out in the woods since then. The forest had to have absorbed the smell because, standing over the thing, it was almost overwhelming. The buzz of the flies must have also been blocked by the foliage and trees.

This was not good. Someone *did* get to the dog at the shelter. Or some*thing*. And whoever or whatever did this had the means and desire to kill. A lot. It also knew where the dog was located. And the only person that was informed of its location was…

“We need to leave.” I told Danny.

“What, why–?”

“*Now.*”

I ran back the direction we came. We were about thirty minutes deep into the woods. Running would cut that time in half.

Danny caught up quickly.

“What’s going on?” she said in between breaths.

“I only told one person where the dog was,” I told her, “and if they’re compromised… then my employer’s in danger.”

I felt the knife wound in my back reopen, but it didn’t matter.

It was unimportant.

I overlooked the possibility that my employer’s man had been compromised.

My employer was careful. He preserved his anonymity at any cost, and he ensured anyone who flipped on him would wish that they were never born.

You didn’t flip on him. You just didn’t.

Until now.

We reached the car in ten minutes. I threw the control stick to the ground, swung open the door, and threw myself into the driver’s seat.

I put the keys into the ignition and the car roared to life. I held the button on the wheel that triggered the voice assistant’s listening mode.

“Call Mr. Bones.”

“Calling.” It replied. I had no burner phones with his number. The mustang was the safest place, and I could only call him directly in emergency situations. Like I said, he valued his privacy. ‘Mr. Bones’ was an alias.

It took a ring and a half for him to answer.

“Yes?” came a deep baritone.

“You’re in danger, sir. Hansen’s been compromised. The dog is dead, and its left ear is missing.” I told him.

He paused for a moment. “Thank you, I was aware of the former, but unaware of the latter. I will make the necessary arrangements. Expect a call in ten minutes.” He hung up as Danny got into the car. Both of our breathing was still heavy.

“Well?” she asked.

“The situation’s under control, for now,” I replied, still unsure what to make of his words. He knew that the man he communicated with me through was compromised.

Why in hell wasn’t I told?

“Well, that’s good,” she said, “um… do you mind grabbing the leash-stick-thing?”

“Yes.”

“O–kay.” She got back out and threw it in the back.

Once she got back in she asked “What now?”

“We wait,” I answered, “he’s going to call back.”

It was exactly ten minutes later when the call arrived. The number was different, and when I answered a different voice was on the other end.

“Ink?”

“Yes.”

“Hello. On behalf of Mr. Bones, please make your way over to the address listed in the follow-up text. You will receive further instructions there. Goodbye–”

“Wait–” I tried to interject, but the person hung up.

“Damn,” I muttered. Hansen was high up, and he was compromised. How could I trust whatever *this* person said?

“So… what’s your move?” Danny said, looking at me, “You trust that?”

“I don’t have much of a choice.” I said as I pulled up the address. It was a place on the outside of town. I put the car in drive.

“Hold on,” she said, “yes. Yes, you *do* have a choice. You could wait it out. Or leave town.”

“No.”

“What do you mean, *‘no’?*”

“I’m not going to do that.”

“Why *not?!*”

My patience cracked, I turned to her, “*Because I’m not.*”

She stared apprehensively. “Fine. But you *are* gonna drop me off someplace before you go. Right?”

“...there isn’t time.”

“Excuse me?” she retorted, “Nuh, uh. I’m not a part of whatever this mob-power-grab shit!”

I paused. I understood, I did, but…

“Can you shoot?” I asked.

“Huh?”

“A gun. Can you shoot one?”

“Yes, why…? Wait, you don’t think I’m gonna *help*, do you?”

“They aren’t expecting two people.”

She looked at me. “This is ridiculous…”

“Danny. I looked into your background before I hired you.”

“...what? How? The amount of time that would take–”

“I know the trade,” I told her, “and I already knew of your escapade at the cottage, and several others.”

She stared.

“If your answer is no, that’s fine. You’ll get your money. But the best I can do is drop you off outside of town. But… I know you can fight. Well. I’ll pay you more if you do this; I’ll make it an hourly rate.”

She stared harder.

“If this is a trap, then another skilled fighter would be advantageous. And if it isn’t, then you’ll just get an hour or two of pay, at *my* rate, for sitting through a debriefing.”

She considered my offer for a minute or two.

“Fine,” she said, “you’ve got yourself a deal.”

Under my mask my mouth turned up in a smirk. “Good. There’s a selection of firearms in the back. You can have your pick when we arrive.”

I’m back with an update regarding what I told you in my previous post. 

So. I have– a lot to tell you, and little time to tell it. I’m running out of time to write this out. 

[I guess if you’re not up to date with what’s been going on, click here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/vkode6/ive_been_dating_a_famous_actor_for_three_months/)

To summarise what I said in my initial post, I have been able to sense how people are going to die from their scent since I was a kid– and I ignored it until I met someone who didn’t smell like gas, spoiled milk or rotten oranges. His scent was an inferno, a vicious burning stink curling in my nose.

Unlike others I’ve failed to save, he isn’t dead yet– and he should be. I’ve never met anyone who gives off a smell and doesn’t die. Ren had one of the best personalities I’d ever known. 

He brought me coffee every morning and broke out laughing halfway through a joke only he thought was funny. You would think a B list actor would make his career his whole personality, but he was the complete opposite, instead choosing to talk endlessly about video games and animal facts. God, he loved animal facts.

I pictured him as one of those kids who would get overly excited by the mini game on the back of a pack of cereal. After so long of distancing myself from people, being with him felt right. I felt comfortable with him. Safe. Then he started to get a little weird, and by ‘a little’ I mean incredibly weird. He didn’t change as a person, but I started to notice things weren’t completely right with him. 

He seemed to be scared of the moon, insisting on masking up every window and hiding away anything reflective. 

The night before he disappeared, and I caught his scent– I found him sitting cross legged in front of his bedroom wall, carving ancient symbols into plaster, his nails ragged and bloody, like claws. 

It wasn’t… him. I mean, it didn’t look like it. His eyes were unseeing, drinking in oblivion, as his fingers, smeared red, sketched out a tree, a snake embedded into its base, followed by more ancient text which hurt my eyes. It wasn’t just him though. There are three of them. Ren, and his friends Johnny and Luce. 

The most interesting people I’d ever met– and I lived in a city known for endearing weirdo’s. 

And according to the smell entangled around them, that same stink of smoke– they were going to burn. 

I saw phantom flames engulfing hair, writhing up squirming legs and bubbling flesh. 

I heard their screams, agonising monstrous cries echoing in endless oblivion, an inferno which didn’t seem real. One that would never end, never be put out. It just kept going, eating them, consuming them.

 Just like the first post, to avoid revealing names, I’ll be changing the names of everyone mentioned to the characters in Bram Stoker’s Dracula, because I don’t want to reveal any identities and I suck at aliases. It’s been almost a week since Ren left with the others, and I’ve had no choice but to try and figure out what the hell is going on. Any other normal person would have ran– and not stopped running until they were far, far away from anything remotely connected to them. But here’s the thing; I’ve been cursed with this ability since I was old enough to be aware of myself, and Ren’s was different. 

His scent didn't make sense, setting my body and mind into fight or flight, and unlocking a banshee like wail which I’ve been unable to swallow down. Unlike My mom and Caleb, the mail-man and Olivia Lennox, all the people who died with a scent attached to them, people I refused to help because I was a coward.  I wanted to help him. I wanted to know who he was. What he was, and why he was running. 

Luce and Johnny too. 

If I’m honest, I wish I hadn't been so curious– and I guess that saying is correct. 

Curiosity killed the cat. 

I wish I ran. I wish I listened to that voice in the back of my head screaming at me to ignore him.

Ignore them. 

But I didn't– and here I am. 

Running out of time. 

For two days I screamed none-stop, and it was hell, like the endless stink scorching my nose and throat and the back of my mouth was trying to tell me something. I didn’t get out of bed, instead burying my head in pillows to try and suffocate it, but that only made it worse; my own screech, an inhuman wail crashing into my skull and bleeding into my brain.

 Imagine you are in hysterics over something as a child, and you can’t stop screaming, your chest heaving, air getting progressively harder to suck in. It felt like a never ending quest to inhale air, to force yourself into breathing normally, and even then it’s hard. Like your blood is pumping battery acid. I could sense it. Sense them. The more time that passed the flames got brighter behind my eyes, the heat boiling me inside out. 

They were going to die, and it was getting close– so close I could feel it. They were going to die, chained to smoke and flame and I had no idea how. Because the fire didn’t make sense, it was an enigma in my head I couldn’t solve.  A fire that didn’t go out. 

How was that possible? 

I’m not sure exactly when it was when I came to my senses. I was standing in front of a room I hadn’t seen before, a large wooden door. The burning had subsided, at least for me, and I was left feeling empty and wrong, like a shell of myself. 

My body felt strange, like it was supposed to scream, like it was supposed to wail for death’s that were yet to come. I’ve spent my life running away from it and now it felt like whatever this curse was– it was evolving in ways I didn’t know. I wasn’t just able to sense scents anymore. 

WIth them came a screech I couldn’t control. And when it was gone, I felt weak and tired, and yet my body still dragged me through Ren’s apartment. LIke it was searching for something. There was something cool pressed to my mouth, and when I fully came to, I realised I’d wet a rag and used it to cover my mouth and nose to try and stop my haemorrhaging nose. It didn’t work. The rag was soaked in red, and the colour turned my stomach.

I dropped it onto the ground and reached out for the door handle, yanking it open. I wasn’t expecting much. Ren didn’t seem like he was planning to stay, more like he was using the apartment as a temporary living space, ready to bolt at any time. 

He was being hunted down, I thought dizzily. They all were. 

Luce’s expression was still vivid in my mind, her lips twisted, a fear I could barely comprehend igniting in her eyes. I’d never seen real fright until I saw the look on her and Johnny’s faces, followed by pain–   true unbridled despair. Like they had already given up.  

“They’ve found us.”

The girl’s last words reverberated in the back of my skull when I stepped into a room I thought was going to be like the others– empty and unused. I had become accustomed to that after moving in with Ren. His kitchen was always way too clean, and the lounge was nothing but a flat-screen and a couch. 

Not exactly a villain’s secret hide-out, but it wasn’t something I’d expect to find in a twenty-something year old actor’s apartment. I switched on the light and stepped into the allure, my gaze drinking in the space, a small room with a low ceiling, the windows taped up like every other.

But I wasn’t looking at the masses of duct tape covering the windows, blocking out every possible sliver of light. Instead, I was staring at paintings, drawings and print-outs of the moon and its cycles. I saw half moons, full moons, and what looked like ancient text half transcribed, stapled to a board on the wall. There were three beanbags, a desk and a laptop, mugs of coffee and books detailing astrology and eclipse’s piled on top of each other. So, I was right. For reasons unknown, Ren and the others were obsessed with the moon. 

Though exploring further, I found it went deeper than that. I glimpsed boxes at the corner of my eye, and when I peeked inside I was greeted to– apples. They were everywhere, when I looked closer. There was one on the desk by the laptop, a bite taken out of it, two by the door, and another that I almost stepped on. I had never seen so many apples. 

Fucking apples. 

I almost laughed. Why apples? 

Curious, I turned back to the wall of research, taking in the recent entries detailing the last full moon where somebody had written CLOSE CALL THANKS TO SOMEONE in black marker, and then below it: 

NO MORE PARTIES.

I could tell from the handwriting, and the clear passive aggressiveness in the smiley face, it was written by Luce calling out the boy’s, or likely Ren. 

Below that, the date June, 25th 2022 was circled in red. 

Did something important happen on that date? 

There was something else I hadn’t noticed, another drawing hidden behind a sea of print outs of a half moon cycle. I slowly made my way over to the wall and plucked out the exact same drawing of the tree Ren had carved into his bedroom wall.

It was a perfect mimic, even down to the serpent tail carved into the outer bark. There were more copies behind that, different variations by the three of them, some of them were scuffed and badly drawn with pencil and ballpoint pen, while others were neat and shaded, using coloured pencils for smear effect, light green for the leaves and different shades of brown and mixed maroon and red for the bark. 

I wondered who the artist was. 

When I took a slow step back, going over each drawing once again, something rang out, loud, penetrating my skull. It took me a moment to realise it was my phone– which was in my pocket. I didn’t remember picking it up. I pulled it out, my gaze never leaving the drawings. “Cal?”

“Mina!” Calliope’s voice was enough to snap me out of it, “Where are you? Dude, you will never believe this. This guy came into the store, and he was asking for some kind of weird gem?”

Her words fell into white-noise, crackling in my ears. 

“Home.” I croaked, replying to the first half of her yelling. 

“I’m sick. I should be in tomorrow.” 

“You’re kidding.” Calliope teased, “Did you go to another party with your big-shot boyfriend?”

“No. I just don’t feel good.”

“Uh-huh. Well, like I keep telling you, we all need to go on a double date. Johnny has this vibe, you know? I can tell he goes for both. Luce, on the other hand, was definitely checking me out. I’ve met them once and only once, and you’re a bad friend for keeping them all to yourself…”

Whatever she was saying wasn’t registering, a slither of dread creeping down my spine. 

“Cal, can I call you back?”

I wasn’t really concentrating on her reply, my attention suddenly on a door at the very back of the room. I’d seen it, I knew I had. But a voice in my head, my own perhaps, had told me to ignore it. 

I started towards it, a shiver creeping down my spine when the stink of mouldy cheese hit me, followed by lavender, and then freshly cut grass. 

I’d never smelled so many of them at once, and my senses were going into overdrive, my thoughts collapsing on on themselves. But I kept going, forcing my body to work, until my trembling hand was wrapped around a steel handle.

I didn’t have time to turn it, because when I tried, the scents were choking me, and I could feel another scream clawing at the back of my throat, inching to escape. I tried to pull away, but my hand was stuck, and the smells were so strong, so potent, suffocating me. Something flashed in my eyes– and I knew what it was automatically. The tree in the drawings. It felt real, like I was there, knelt in front of it surrounded by burning orange. 

Shadows dancing around me, a pooling black sky lit up in ominous red. 

The image flashed out of my vision before I could grasp hold of it. 

I remember Calliope still talking into my ear when I hit the ground, my phone slipping from my grasp.

 My hands clawed at my throat, and then to my chest, when the air grew thick and cold, and my vision blurred. I don’t remember falling face first on the ground, all I remember is the world spinning around me, and my friend’s voice. “Mina? Hey, are you still there? Mina?”

Cal’s voice was drowned out by another, which was suddenly so close. I could sense someone near me, so close, the sweet aroma of their perfume enveloping everything else. The smells came first, followed by noise; light chatter and clinking glasses, silverware and cutlery clanging together. I was no longer in Ren’s apartment. In fact, I was no longer myself. When I opened my eyes, a fancy restaurant surrounded me, the type I would never eat at. I was sitting at a table, in front of a platter of fruit, cheese and different types of bread. I couldn’t move my body, or speak, or even breathe.

I wasn’t alone. Sitting opposite me sipping a glass of wine was a tall woman with sour features, dark brown and a beige sweater, while on my right and left were Luce and Johnny, the two of them were well dressed, and looked different. 

Luce was a lot less paler, her hair a shade of chestnut, pulled into two pigtails, while Johnny, instead of hiding under his hood, like I was used to, wore shorts and t-shirt, his hair a lot shorter and spikier. His eyes, when I caught them, seemed far more animated. 

“Ren?”

The name caught me off guard, and it hit me like a wave of ice water. 

I was Ren. 

No, I was in his memory, pieces of whatever this was tainting the door handle I’d grabbed. 

The unfamiliar woman’s voice was an impatient hiss, and I looked down to find my, no, his, hands. He wore a smart button down shirt which was already splattered with cheese sauce. 

Ren’s reflection was in the silverware, and I glimpsed his familiar dark curls and pale face, shadows under his eyes. I was so used to his smile, but this time his lips were set into a permanent scowl. Ren’s gaze wandered, first landing on the sunset outside, blurs of pink and orange streaking across the sky, and then Johnny, put off by how the boy was tearing chicken from a drumstick, leaving a clean bone. I felt a shiver slip down his spine, disgust curl in his gut. For whatever reason, he was terrified.

I’d known smells my whole life, and the deaths attached to them, but there was something about emotions I couldn’t comprehend, especially when they weren’t mine. “Ren.” The woman said again, this time with bite. “I won’t ask again.”

“Hmm?” His voice came out soft, like he’d been daydreaming, “Sorry, what was that?”

Her lip quirked, though I sensed irritation. “I said, would you like more bread?” 

“She’s playing with me,” his panicked thoughts filling my head deafened everything else. 

“Fuck. She’s waiting for me to bring it up and knows I won’t– a classic game of cat and mouse.”

His gaze went to the others. “Luce is too scared, and Johnny is worried he’ll say the wrong thing…” Ren’s thoughts faded into static, and the ambience of his surroundings drifted back into focus.

“I’m okay.” He said out loud. I sensed his grin, forced and wrong, stretched across his face. “Smile,” His voice hit again. “Come on, man, you know how to smile.” There was a certain tension around the table.

Luce was glaring down at her plate, and Johnny kept catching his eye, a look of almost desperation in his expression. Something was burning in Ren’s throat, simple words that seemed easy to say, and yet they were tangled and wrong, and every time he tried to say them, he instead gulped down more wine from the silver encrusted glass next to his plate. When Ren fumbled with the glass, and then his hands in his lap, his palms were sticky with sweat. He took a breath and exhaled, “Actually, Claire, do mind if we talk about–”

She cut him off, like the woman had been waiting, praying on his every word. “I heard you have an interview next week.” Her lips curved into a fake smile while her eyes stayed narrowed.

One look at Luce and Johnny, the two of them were suddenly far too interested in their food.

“Yeah.” Ren said in a breath, struggling to make eye-contact with her, “It’s for a movie role.” 

“Again? Her eyes darkened, and he stiffened up, his breath suddenly heavy. 

“I thought I told you to drop the fantasy.”  

Ren cleared his throat, still smiling a stupid smile. “I think it would be good for us.”

The woman, or Claire, cocked a brow, before slapping down a piece of paper. Ren had been expecting it, but still, his heart sank into his gut. Claire stabbed each line with her index, enunciating every word. “Under section B, line 56— it clearly says not to step into the public eye and attract attention to yourself." She said. 

"You star in a movie, and already people are asking where you came from. How long before they come sniffing around us? Ren, you’re making a joke out of us. We were clear. Under no circumstances must any of you become a recognisable face. Because if you do, what will happen to us? Our family will be corrupted. I know every child has a dream, but that path is not yours. You were not born to be an entertainer. You were born to stand by her side. Through sickness and in health, till eternal death will you part. That is what you promised. You’re coming home. This phase of curiosity is over.” 

Claire’s gaze flashed to Luce and Johnny. “I am very disappointed in the three of you.”

I hate those words. Ren’s voice came again, harsher, slamming into me, and I was filled with a cocktail of his anger, and pain and desperation which was bubbling deep beneath his crumbling facade.

It was getting harder to keep his cool, to stop himself jumping up, grabbing Luce and Johnny, and running out of there. But he had to do this. If he didn’t, he’d never get out. While those thoughts rattled in my skull, his inside voice sounded like the cry of a child, pricking me like needles.  “I hate those words. I hate them. I fucking hate them. I hate them.”

“This isn’t curiosity.” Ren’s tone grew cold, “I want to give acting a real shot, and it’s not as bad as you said. You told me they’d laugh at me, but they actually gave me a chance in a big role.”

“You’re delusional.” Claire said in a sigh, “Oh, sweetie, you’re nothing to them.” 

“Claire, I starred in an actual movie…” Ren swallowed his words when he caught Luce’s subtle shake of the head. “I mean, what I’m trying to say is I’m good enough. They said that.”

Claire shook her head. “Take those words out of your mouth, Ren. They don’t suit you. I told you the truth. The entertainment industry does not care about you. They make money, all of it a vicious conveyer belt captained by billionaires who only get richer. They sell your face. Not your talent. They are materialistic and greedy, and we will not, I repeat not stand for one of our own going down that path. You’re going to come back to us. The community who raised you.” 

Her gaze went to Johnny, who was nervously nibbling on a breadstick.

And then Luce, twisting around in her chair, frightened eyes flitting for the exit. 

“All of you.” Claire finished, her lips splitting into a grin when the girl finally caught her eye. 

Luce was going to run, Ren thought dizzily. He could sense it, her restless foot tapping on the ground, the way she kept picking up her fork and dropping it before twisting back to the door. 

To the late afternoon commute, a sunset blurring into view. 

Freedom. 

But Ren knew she wouldn’t run without them. 

“Ren?” Claire inclined her head, “Have I gotten through to you? Are we going to put all of these nasty thoughts behind us and go back home?” Her eyes glistened with unkempt madness. 

“Back to her,” she said in a sing-song voice. “You’ll be coming back to her.”

Ren’s hands formed fists in his lap, his stomach galloping. “Claire, if you’ll just listen to us–”

His voice cracked, and there it was again– that overwhelming urge to splinter. 

To crack. 

To knock the crazy bitch out. 

Claire pulled out her phone, snake-like eyes snapping to the screen. 

“Ren, your name has been mentioned 306 times on Twitter today. That may not seem like a lot, but take on more  roles and you will expose yourself and bring all eyes on our dear family.”

“Family.” Johnny choked on a breadstick. 

“Sure.” He coughed, but his cough sounded a lot like “cult”.

Ren gave a swift kick under the table, jamming the toe of his shoe into the boy’s thigh. 

“Ow.” 

“We said we would hear her out.” 

“Yeah, I said I'd hear her out. I didn’t say anything about not calling her out on her bullshit.” 

“Jonathan.” Claire’s smile dampened. “Please refrain from swearing.” 

“Why? I’m away from that prison and I’m not living under your roof. Free speech, it’s 2021.”

“I'm not talking about free speech,” Claire shot back. “It’s about having respect.”

The clang of Johnny’s fork hitting his plate made Ren wince. “Respect?” 

He choked out a laugh, but it was cruel, his smile hollow, eyes haunted with things Ren had seen, all of them had seen— and it sent shivers down his spine. 

Johnny’s smile was cracking slowly, and the real him was starting to surface, his tone dripping venom. Ren had told him to hide it, because if he didn’t there was no way they were getting out of there. His words came out in hisses of breath, exaggerated and slow, a powder keg ready to blow.  “You want to talk about respect?” 

“Johnny.” Luce whispered, her fingers grasping the cuff of his shirt. “Not now.” 

When Johnny nodded, sitting back and taking a long swig of wine, Ren saw the opportunity to continue, to get it all out before he could stop himself. That’s what they had planned. They were going to just say it, and then run– and if she came after them, they would keep running until she was gone, and they were free. “Anyway.” 

He cleared his throat. “We’ve decided to leave the, um, the community. If that’s okay. There’s  a drama school in Boston we’ve been looking at. It has an arts program, and I figured we could start there.” Ren took a breath, risking a glance at her. Until then, Claire had been taking delicate bites of her salad. She didn’t stop, didn’t show any expression as he continued. Johnny and Luce were watching, their eyes wide– and Ren knew exactly what they were thinking. “Did she care? Was she going to let them go?” And he knew the answer, evident in the subtle curl in her perfectly made up lips. 

“Fucking cat and mouse.” Ren’s thoughts muttered, “She’s got us.”

The three of them held a collective breath as the woman picked up her napkin, swiped at her lips, and settled Ren with a lipsticky grin. “You’re not going to college,” she said, “You are not going to be an actor, or move out, or abandon our family. What you are going to be, all three of you,  is a child of Eden– to stand by her side when she awakens. We have been through this.”

“No.” His voice shakes, and his thoughts cry out, splintering. “No, we never wanted this. This… this family, it’s wrong. Like I said, I appreciate what you’ve done for us, but we’re not doing it.”

Claire blinked slowly. “But it’s so close to your anointing!” 

“I’m done. I don’t want to do this anymore.” Ren nodded to the others. He was trembling. 

“We don’t want to do this anymore.”

Claire was still smiling, but her lips were pinched. 

“The three of you are being irrational.” She said calmly. “I know you're scared. Everyone is. But it’s a beautiful process. Your parents went through it. I went through it. And look at us. We will still be walking the earth bathed in her light. A better earth. Where she will reign once more.” 

The woman was fucking crazy. 

"Yeah, it’s a hard pass,” Johnny straightened up in his chair, picking up an apple and taking a bite. “We’re not stupid. You might have successfully fucked with our heads since we were kids, but we’ve woken up.” He leaned on his fist, a smile prickling on his lips. “Surprise! The weird community we’ve been forced to be part of since we’ve been born is actually a psycho cult!”

Claire pushed away her salad. Ren had never seen her act so– human. "Johnny, I’ll have to stop you there. The ritual is a stepping stone for every Eden child. We do not use the C word.”

He raised a brow. “But it’s literally a cult. You can’t deny that.”

“We’re a family.” She gritted out. “Please stop saying that word.” 

“You want us to burn.” Luce finally speaks up. She had been the one terrified to come, and he’d convinced her and was starting to regret it. He saw how her body was quivering, her fingers tapping on the table. “The Eden ritual anoints us reborn while our souls burn in her light. We were taught this from first grade.” Her lip curled, years of pain bleeding into her words. “What family teaches their community that is okay? We were naive little kids.”

“We didn’t know any better.” Ren spoke up, his tone cutting. 

Claire nodded, like she was listening, like she was understanding, but Ren could see the cogs turning in her head. “Is this about your purifying ceremony?” She whispered. “You won’t feel it, we’ve told you this. The Summer solstice holds great power and she will be able to turn your mortal flesh into something far more desirable, where you can turn things like pain and emotion off like a light switch.” 

Her eyes grew wide, her lips following, “Doesn’t that sound truly beautiful? To no longer feel pain, to walk next to her in a body made of steel, and a heart filled with her light.” Claire’s lips were moving, curving into soundless words, but Ren had tuned her out. They hurt. What she was saying, what his mother and father had told him his whole life, brought him up to believe he was part of something beautiful. And it was beautiful. As a child he had worn a flower crown and danced around a fire while the chosen ones sang to the sky. 

But they weren’t singing, he’d come to realise. 

They were screaming. 

Luce slammed her fist into the table, and yet no-one in the room reacted. “You made me believe that I could surrender myself to her light, and allow her to set my soul on fire at the passing age.” She tightened her grip on the table. “You said I should never look at her during the night. That I should wait until I was anointed. And if I did, I would pay the consequences.”

Claire nodded. “That’s right.”

The girl’s lips twisted into a smile– not a friendly one, not the ones Ren had known his whole life. “You made me fear her, until one night I risked it. I looked, and guess what happened?”

“Tell us, sweetheart.” 

“Nothing.” Johnny said. He mimed an explosion. “Shocker.” 

“It’s not real.” Luce whispered. “You’re crazy, and my mom and dad. You’re all crazy.”

The woman lost her smile, sputtering a laugh. “You can’t just walk away!”

“Yes we can.” Luce said, her tone hardening. 

Claire wasn’t finished yet. 

“This is what your parents want! Why you were born!  Do you not like what we have given you? What we are about to give you? Impenetrable flesh. The ability to fully consume her light!” Her  eyes snapped to Ren. “Now, drop this ridiculous dream and come and finish your anointing.”

“Dream?” Johnny rolled his eyes.  “What’s wrong with making something of ourselves? You’ve kept us under lock and key our whole lives and want us to serve some fictional god, and you can’t stand that the facade has shattered and you can’t control us with your voodoo shit.”

Her hand slammed down on the table and Johnny jumped. 

“Tell me, Jonathan,” she said, her voice prickling, “Who put these ridiculous ideas into your head?”

Ren knew exactly who had. But he wouldn’t think back to it, he would keep suppressing it. 

Deep, deep down. 

Johnny shrugged. “When I realised you  worship the fucking moon and think she’s an actual God. I looked into the sky one day and it suddenly came to me! The moon isn’t some mystical being we need to give ourselves to. She’s just a funny dot on the horizon, and one day you guys kidnapped my mom and dad and brainwashed them into your psychotic hivemind.”

Claire hissed out. “Jonathan! What would Mr Harken say?”

“I don’t care. He’s not my dad.”

Johnny’s voice shook, despite his smile. “Truth is? I don’t think I’ve ever known him.” 

“We’re done here.” Ren managed to say, and stood up. 

As soon as he stood up, though, he flopped back down. 

Claire didn’t move from her seat. “I don’t think we are done here. Because what you don’t understand is that you were born to be her right hand. We don’t let potential like you go that easily.” Her laugh was shrill, “What do you expect us to do? Find other Children Of Eden who have reached the adult age of full maturity? No other twenty-five year old has what we want.”

Johnny was the first to say it, when he reached out and grabbed his glass. 

“Fuck.” He said, “She drugged the wine.” Then he laughed. “Of course she drugged the wine.”

Luce screamed, but the doors were already shutting on those last glitters of sunlight. 

Johnny dropped the glass, and it shattered on the ground. 

But he didn’t move, his body half slumping in the chair.

With panic setting in, Ren jumped up, and this time he was physically forced back into his chair. The room twitched around him, and he was seeing ordinary people rising from their chairs, and starting to come over, slowly, like zombies. I felt suffocated in his body, while warm arms were dragging him to his feet, and then back to the ground, silhouettes dancing above him. In the blur of his mind, Ren began to laugh. The figures, he thought. They looked like those… those...

Tube people, his mind came back for a moment, focusing on that thought. 

You know, those tube people with the funny spindly arms. 

They wave! They wave, and dance, and go weeeeeeeeeeeeee!

Funny. Tube. People. 

The ones at gas stations! His last thoughts were foggy, an endless stream of gibberish. 

I remember them. They were all… squiggly and wiggly and ha… hahahahaha… hahahahaha!

Ren woke after a while of drifting in the dark, thoughtless and buried in brain fog. I woke with with him, a cool breeze tickling his cheeks and crawling across exposed flesh. WIth consciousness came reality coming into view for him, at first confusion and then a sudden raw fear eating him from the inside, the overwhelming urge to run. But run where? His emotions weren’t just his, they were mine, filling me, his agony and pain and hopelessness erupting inside his mind. 

He opened his eyes to the vision I’d seen before bleeding into his memories. I saw the same tree in the drawings– and this time it was real, towering over him, a blur of orange light surrounding him, and an unearthly red glow in the sky. The tree was beautiful, truly mesmerising, taking even his breath away. From tangled branches sticking out in frenzied tendrils, bright red apples hung ripe and ready to be picked. When Ren lifted his head, he was blinking at a  blood moon poking through a starless night. Not quite at totality yet, but close. 

He was half naked, kneeling in front of the same tree tree. 

There was a young woman, around my age, kneeling in front of him. In her hand was a pile of what looked like ash. She dipped in a finger and with her index, painted symbols into his flesh. 

When he hissed out and tried to get up, he was shoved back down. 

Claire was behind him. He could sense her warm breath tickling the back of his neck. It was strangely silent and peaceful, the orange glow expanding into orange flecks dancing in the dark. Though the silence didn’t last for long, of course it didn’t. When the sounds of struggling and yelling hit him, a rush of pride and bittersweet joy was enough to fill the cavern in his gut. Johnny was pushed to his knees, his shirt stripped off, and then Luce, in her bra and jeans. Any attempts the others made to talk or yell, were met with beatings with a wooden cane. 

“Great. A midsommar rip off." Johnny’s voice was a slur next to him, “Have you no shame?” 

Ren’s whole body rattled when the cane came down, streaking across Johnny’s back. 

He didn’t cry out, instead burying his cries in the grass and laughing. 

“I mean seriously. You copied the whole movie– obviously, aside from the whole moon worship thing, but this is just ridiculous. You even got the creepy ass town ritual thing going on too.” 

This time the cane didn’t come down, instead a voice pierced the silence, and it was then when Ren found two familiar faces bleeding into the crowd. His heart ached for them at first glance, for them to do something, to save him. But deep down, he knew that wasn’t going to happen. 

I hate them, he thought, and the thought was feral, like he was screeching it. 

I fucking hate them. 

Evil bastards. 

“Silence.” A man appeared out of the dark, someone who Ren called an Elder. 

The man looked ancient, resembling a reanimated corpse. 

“Ren Fields. Lucy West. Jonathan Harken. We’ve been waiting for you.” 

His stern expression broke out into a crazed grin, and he raised his arms in the air. “Please. Allow your last few minutes as human beings to be peaceful. We want you to feel happy during your anointing.” 

“Do you know what would make me feel happy?” Johnny hissed. “Not fucking sacrificing me!”

“Sacrifice?” The elder laughed, and the crowd mimicked him. Johnny was right, it really was like Midsommar. “Mr Harken, we are not killing you. We are not giving you away, we would never give you away!” His smile widened. “We’re simply filling you with our Luna’s divine light.” 

“What?” Johnny croaked. “What the fuck are you talking about? It’s just the moon!”

“Eat from the tree. It symbolises rebirth.” The elder commanded, ignoring him.

Ren did as he was told, slowly raising to his feet and reaching for the closest apple in reach. 

Johnny followed suit, and then Luce, who had to be dragged to her feet.

Next, the same woman who had painted the ash symbols on his chest, came in front of Ren once more, this time holding a knife. She didn’t say anything, only ordering him to be restrained, before she dug the knife into his flesh. 

At first I thought she was trying to kill him, or cut out his heart. Instead, though, the woman, ignoring Ren’s cries of agony, and his muffled screeches into a stranger’s palm, carved a serpent starting on his chest and ending over his naval. Pain was a strange thing, Ren thought, when he’d stopped screaming. It was agonising, the worst pain he had ever felt, and it wasn’t stopping. It wasn’t faltering. It kept going until he was begging for death, squeezing his eyes shut and praying for the blade to pierce his heart. 

And yet despite the pain physically hurting him, it only fuelled his hatred for his parents. 

For the community he thought loved him. 

When dripping, pooling red hit the dirt beneath him, the serpent was finished. 

“Ren.” Johnny whispered. 

“Yeah?” 

“What… what do we do?”

His words were cut off, then, by a sudden cry. It wasn’t Johnny, who had choked on his words, it was the crowd, and the elder. All of them were crying out, tipping their heads back and gazing into the sky.

Ren did the same, his gaze finding a full moon taking shape, illuminating everything in its wake and bathing the crowd in light. Ren watched his parents' eyes fill with light, and then the crowd, one by one. He watched their bodies go slack and wrong, like puppets cut from their strings.

And then he was looking. He was really looking, and suddenly it was so hard to look away. 

Ren remembered exactly what it was he’d been taught, that the snake carved into his flesh was supposed to come alive and arm his heart, making him a right hand. He never believed it until he felt his flesh move and then ripple. He couldn’t look away from the moon, from her, and therefore couldn’t see the carving moving under the moon’s light and slowly but surely bleeding into reality, before burying itself under his skin. That was the moment when Ren Fields realised two things. 

His parents and the elders had always been his torturers since he was a child. They had always been the ones who had made him want to die. 

And yet, now he was seeing her light, and feeling her dripping into him, entangling herself with him, whispering into his head in a melodic murmur, a language which both made no sense, but was starting to, in a metamorphosing mind. It was never them, Ren thought, as he brought the apple to his lips and took a bite. They were just her puppets, her dolls to play with and control. 

Next to him, Johnny wasn’t moving, his wide eyes on the moon, slack jawed. 

Her voice was so sweet, inviting him to join her– join them. 

And he did. Ren took a bite of the apple, as instructed, only to get a mouthful of maggots. 

It was enough. 

The maggots were enough to temporarily break the spell cast over him. Ren came to his senses quickly, choking out a cry, and spitting out maggots which continued to pour from the apple. The crowd was still entranced in the sky, and Johnny and Luce were halfway through their apples.

I don’t know how Ren got to his feet. I wouldn’t have been able to. I would have been too scared to move. But he did. He forced himself to his feet, ignoring polling crimson spattering his chest. He pulled Johnny to his feet in one sharp breath, and Luce with another. 

They weren’t moving, though, half eaten apples still clutched in their hands, their eyes glued to the sky. Ren took the opportunity and ran, pulling them with him. He didn’t stop running until Johnny let out a sharp breath and coughed up maggots writhing in apple pieces, and then Luce shortly after. Where they were was so dark I couldn’t see, only endless stretches of grass and field which seemed to go on forever. “Don’t look at the sky.” 

Ren managed to say, tugging them harder. He knew that something had snapped inside of him, and lifting his head would give his last pieces of humanity to her. “Don’t look at the sky.” He said it in a mantra so even he would hear it, because the urge to look, to risk a peek burned through him like poison. 

“So. Can we… Can we establish some things?” 

“The moon.” Ren gasped out, “She’s.. real. She’s controlling them, or— or something.” 

“So, my dad—-“ 

“Yeah. Everyone.” 

“I can hear her.” Johnny whispered.  “She’s, fuck, she’s singing into my head–”

Whatever he was about to say was suddenly drowned out by ringing, and then– vibrating. 

My phone. 

I was pulled from the memory, and found myself lying face down on the floor, back in Ren’s apartment, and my chest was burning. When I lifted up my shirt, the the carving of the serpent was bleeding into my flesh, like Ren.  I sat up, my head spinning, a cacophony of voices still ringing in my head. The memory was still clinging to me, still going on without me. I could hear their hissed breaths. 

“We got away.” Luce whispered, “That’s… that’s good, right? We left them!”

Ren didn’t reply, but I knew what he was thinking. 

What Johnny was thinking. 

And I knew what was behind the mystery door suffocated in scents. 

Calliope was on the phone complaining of a sudden influx of customers, and I dragged myself to work. If anything, it was a distraction. I was halfway through my shift researching moon  cycles and on my phone, when footsteps startled me, and I lifted my head to find a Starbucks coffee cup inches from my face. Behind that coffee cup stood Ren, with an abnormal smile on his face. He looked better than usual– no, much better. 

His hair was its usual mess of brown curls, though there was no sign of the raybans he insisted on wearing. The dark circles under his eyes were gone, though his cheeks looked far more gaunt and pale, a certain light in his eyes I couldn’t look away from. “Mina.” He leaned forward, lips twitching. 

“Can we talk?” 

Calliope yelled something, and I twisted around for one second to check on my friend. 

When I turned back, he was gone. 

And so was the coffee. 

In his place was a new scent, a stink hanging in the air, twisting my gut. 

No longer burning. 

Rotting. 

…

It’s been almost a day since I last saw him and I don’t know what to do. I keep thinking about this. I think whatever happened to them was last year. 

Was June 24th the date of that ritual? And did the elders repeat it this year? 

What should I do? I’m at a loss!

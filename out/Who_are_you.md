This is the story of the last week of my life. 

It was a normal (enough)week until Saturday. 

On Sunday I woke up did homework,and watched, made and posted TikToks. 

On Monday I woke up went through a normal day, school, TikToks and sending TikToks to my editor then sleep. 

Tuesday I woke and went through the same routine but I felt like I was being watched, I played it off as being another gawking fan. 

Wednesday I still felt like I was being watched and I was invited to a party at Rachel's mansion Friday night. A detail I noticed but brushed off was the vent being open in the bathroom. 

Thursday I persuaded my parents to let me go to the party, yippee. However the feeling of being watched didn't go away and my editor found a dark figure in the corner of my video. 

Finally it's Friday, is what I thought, the party is tonight, the weekend starts tomorrow, what can go wrong? I met Macon, my boyfriend, we chatted between and during classes about the party. 

That night I got home from school put on some lingerie, a short silky black dress and jeans on top (to fool my naive party) I then applied makeup, I had a hard decision between red, pink or brown lipstick. 

I packed my bag, pads, tampons, money, phone etc. I left, chirping bye bye to my parents then got into my car. I took my jeans off when out of sight, carefully placing them in my car boot as not to crinkle them. 

I arrived at the party 10 minutes later and found Macon, after 5 minutes we found an empty bedroom and one thing led to another and we left the room an hour later, I wrote on my hand to take the morning after pill. 

We partied and I remembered not to drink as to drive home safely (that was useless!) 

When I got home my parents scolded me for arriving 10 minutes after my curfew (so strict it was such a good thing I remembered to put my jeans back on.) I just said that their was traffic then went to my room, filmed my nighttime routine, sent it to my editor then went to sleep. 

Saturday, worst day of my 17 year life really, I woke up got dressed and checked my phone. A video of me and Macon f*cking was on a corn site. 

I called Macon and Rachel and they knew nothing about it. 

I decided to go for a walk to calm my nerves, I admired the birds chirping and the beautiful green trees and plants. I smelt the flowers and felt close enough to peace that I could in that moment. 


Black. 


I awoke to burning pain all over my body. I was in the back of an oddly familiar van. I couldn't speak. 

"Hey!" shouted the driver his voice rough. 

He was dressed in all black,topped off with a black ski mask.He pulled over and climbed to the back, ripping the duck tape off my mouth. 

"Did you enjoy last night, you certainly enjoyed it with Macon, you moaned loudly"

"WTF, WHERE AM I, WHY AM I HERE JUST WHY?" 

"I'm taking you to the afterlife"

"Why?" Stupid question to ask, not can you have mercy, no why. 

"I am and always have been envious of you, so I got close to you, I'll say I found you on the side of the road, tell everyone on your TikTok and get tons of followers, simple" 

The last sentence that left my mouth was. 

"Who are you?" 

The last word, thing, person (if you can call him that) was 

"Macon"

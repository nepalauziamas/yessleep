I think I’m starting to lose my mind, I don’t know how to process last night. But I need to tell someone. I don’t expect anyone to believe me but here goes. 

I work night shift in a care home, I enjoy the peace and quite. Something changed last night,  I was standing doing the laundry, I make sure I’m facing the door so I don’t get accidentally jump scared. I was folding a gigantic pile of bedsheets and singing to myself. I heard a door open and expected a resident or a colleague but no one was there. I shrugged it off as nothing but the sense of dread kept creeping over me. Each time I lifted a sheet my view was obstructed. I felt something watching me. It’s dark and quiet so I thought I was over thinking it.  I decided to play a game with myself and held a sheet up in front of me and didn’t move, after what felt like 30 seconds a shadow appeared, it looked like the outline of a person standing in front me, I assumed it was another member of the night team and dropped the sheet, there was no-one there. I told myself that it was my shadow, I finished up in the laundry and went down stairs. 

As I sat in the break room I couldn’t get that image out of my head. The shadow was standing with their arms at their side, it was tall and slender. I’m not slender, and I was holding the sheet up. My arms were raised, I tried to convince myself that I was misremembering. I didn’t want to be the weird girl on nights.

Well it turns out I was very wrong, when I went to bed this morning, I closed the blinds and put on some brown noise to help me sleep, you know the one with the black screen. As I started to drift I felt a cold hand on my back, when my eyes shot open I noticed it, standing by the bed, a tall slender figure, covered in a white sheet, it wasn’t a clean sheet this time, it had oozing red and brown stains and I could hear it wheezing. I put the lights on and slowly turned round, it was gone. My cats faces told me I wasn’t the only one who seen it. They were at the bedroom door all puffed up, and when I looked at the bed there was a brown stain. 

I wanted this to be a nightmare but I was awake, and I’ve not slept , I hope it follows me back. I’ve not told my Husband yet, I blamed the stain on a cup of coffee. I’m back at work and every time I catch my reflection I see it, just behind me. I think it’s waiting for something. My two cats are avoiding me since this morning, they hiss and look over my shoulder. 

I am starting to hear a whisper, it’s a nice voice, almost like my Grannies.  I feel like I’m being pulled away, I won’t let it take me.

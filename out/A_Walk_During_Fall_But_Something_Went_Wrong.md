This was during Fall of 2021, I was going for a walk to feel the Fall breeze, I took walks every Tuesday and Thursday, and Friday I went on 1-hour walks, and some people find it unusual for guys to walk for 1-hour, but I did, so on Tuesday during October, I was going for a walk, I route was simple, left, right, etc.

I took a right and saw some figure, I could see tints of red, so I continued walking, and made a right, I got to the end of the road and turned around, I could see the figure again, but his hood was up. "You need something?" I said to the figure, he didn't respond and kept following me as I walked, he followed me until I got to an entrance of a road to a neighborhood that reminds me of The Backrooms, I had enough of this fucker following me, I turned around a yelled. "Look buddy I don't want yo-" I was cut of by his appearance, he put his hood down, and it was a demented looking human, his eyes widen, and he lunged at me, I ran until I got to another neighborhood near my house.

I was out of breath. "What the fuck was that thing? Why was he following me?" I thought, and then, I felt the feeling of being watched, it was normal since everyone watches me as I walk, but this time, I was paranoid, I continued to walk, and something beeped, I patted all around me, and felt a bump, I grabbed it, it looked like it was removable, so I took it out of my head and looked at it, it was a tracker... I broke the thing as fast as I can, and after I did that, I heard pixelated mumbles, and I realized something...

I was scared and continued to walk, I looked at the park that I pass every walk, and saw red and green things pixelated, I was scared as fuck, few minutes past and I got back to the sidewalk near my neighborhood, I was convinced no one was watching or following me, until I heard. "Hey!" I looked and it was the demented person, I backed up about to run when it yelled. "RUN!!! DON'T LET HER GET YOU!!!" "What?! What do you mean?!" "JUST FUCKING RUN DAMNIT!!!" I ran as fast as I can, I heard more running, I looked behind me and saw a scary pixelated woman, with red hair, I ran as fast as I can until I got to my house, slammed the door shut.

After that, I took a shower, and ate some dinner, and try to rationalize this situation, that demented person, was he trying to help me all this time? Why did he lunge at me then? Then I realize, the tracker, he lunged at me because of the tracker, I was relieved that he was trying to save me, and I calmed down and went to sleep.

My walking days didn't end whoever, but I was cautious every time I hear some kind of beep, because I can never know if it's that pixelated girl, looking for me.

The fourth letter from Mr. McCreary is posted below. You can read the previous letters [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/xs0puy/i_received_this_series_of_mysterious_emails_has/).

In the course of my correspondence with the sender, I was sent five letters in total. While I replied to all the letters and asked various follow up questions, he did not respond to any of my questions except for in this letter. You can read his response to my question at the end of this email.

This letter was the strangest yet.

*TO:* [*Rand.Curtis@xxxxxxxxxxxx.com*](mailto:Rand.Curtis@xxxxxxxxxxxx.com)

*FROM:* [*emccreary@xxxxxx.net*](mailto:emccreary@xxxxxx.net)

*SUBJECT: RE: Nowhere*

*——————————————————————————————————*

*It’s becoming more difficult to write these in time allotted. I think they may be monitoring me. The doctor asked me some unusual questions yesterday, ones that seemed prompted by government officials. Maybe the CIA, FBI…I don’t know. So tonight I’ve snuck into the computer lab without permission. I’ll try to be brief and get this off before anyone finds me.*

*So when I left off, I had just reunited with my old friend Wade Murrow. Suffice to say, we were all shocked, especially me. And of course I asked him a barrage of questions about where he’d been, what happened to his kids, why his house was out here in the woods…*

*But all of his answers were aloof. Either he was lying or being vague, and for what reason I couldn’t determine. At one point, the doctor leaned over to me.*

*“He’s lost his marbles,” he said.*

*By the way Wade was acting, I thought it might be true. He claimed that his house was always here, that it never moved. He claimed he never had a wife or children. And he insisted that he’d never disappeared.*

*“Wade, you and your family disappeared. We looked for you for months. You’ve been declared a missing person by the Sheriff’s department.”*

*“I’m not missing, Everett. I’ve always been right here.”*

*It was a strange conversation, with him always twisting words around to avoid answering. Eventually I gave up, and I was starting to believe that the doctor was right. I also decided not to bring up his wife’s death. I wasn’t sure what that would do to him in his current state.*

*So I decided to wait until morning to try again. I knew I’d get the information out of him eventually. So we all bed down for the night.*

*I don’t know how long I was asleep, but I woke with a start to see Wade hovering over me with a scalpel in his hand. My gun had been placed across the room, out of range. Wade’s hand clamped down hard on my shoulder and he plunged the blade. I’ll never forget what he said when he did it:*

*“I have to do this. It’s for your own good,” he said.*

*Well, I fought back with all I had, and I’m a good deal stronger than my friend, knife or not. The commotion woke the others.*

*The scalpel had sliced into my upper bicep, and blood was streaming down my arm. And for some reason, Wade kept going at the same spot, telling me to calm down and let him do what needed to be done.*

*Eventually I threw him off me. I scrambled for the gun to take control of the situation. That backed him off. I shouted for everyone to calm down. That’s when Esther pointed a finger at my arm.*

*“What’s that?” she exclaimed.*

*I looked down where the blade has slit me, and underneath the skin something was flashing. Emitting a faint light under the skin. I reached for it, bewildered, when Wade lifted his own shirt sleeve to reveal a scar on his own bicep. “That’s how they know where to find you,” he said.*

*I stuck my finger in the wound and pulled out what I can only describe as a small metal chip. The others crowded around to see it.*

*It was a small rectangle in shape, with a symbol on it, that looked like three 6’s entwined around one another.*

*“666 — the number of the Beast,” LeeAnn said.*

*Wade handed Doc Singh the knife. “You need to take them out of everyone or you’ll never be free,” he uttered.*

*Then came a loud low rumble. The same one we had heard when Percy had disappeared. It was distant, but getting closer.*

*“Do it now. All of you. There isn’t much time.” And with that, Wade ran from the cabin into the night. Only saying one last thing to me, “Don’t let them get you, Everett, you were my friend.” And then he was gone.*

*There was some protest, but eventually the others allowed the doctor to extract the devices from their arms. We tossed them on the floor, and headed out from the house into the surrounding woods. But when we reached the tree-line, the doctor stopped. “I need to see who’s after us.”*

*“No, we need to go. Get as far away from those things as possible,” I urged.*

*Then a curious look came over the doctor’s face. “I think I see Marla.”*

*Marla was the doctor’s wife, the one who’d run off those many years ago. I glanced back, but I didn’t see anyone. “Come on doctor, we have to go!” I shouted.*

*But he wouldn’t listen. He marched back toward the house as if in a trance. Whether he’d actually seen her or not, I didn’t know, but I couldn’t risk us all to follow after him.*

*Someone or something was after us. That was for sure. For what reason, I didn’t know. But what Wade had said had scared me enough to get away from there.*

*All that mattered to me at that point was finding Ava and Daniel.*

*And so we left him.*

*It was just me, Esther and LeeAnn from that point on. And the three of us just kept walking through the night.*

*We trudged on until a blue dawn began to light the spaces between the trees. Eventually, we emerged from the woods onto an overgrown highway.*

*My hope that we were near Brattleboro were soon dashed when we came upon an aging wooden sign along the road.*

*It read:* ***Welcome to Bennington***\*.\*

*Somehow we must have gotten turned around. I checked the compass, it was heading due east, toward Brattleboro. There was just no way we could’ve looped back. But the sun was rising from the west! That’s when I realized —* *the compass must have been broken*\*. I threw the damn thing in the woods.\*

*We were defeated, and with our tail between our legs returned home.*

*But as we approached the town, I could see some things were very different.*

*The big housing development just outside of town, was gone — nothing but an empty field remained. Where the Dairy Queen once stood was and old fashioned gas station. Even the overpass over I-9 was missing.*

*As we treaded further into town, it all became clear…*

*This was Bennington all right.*

*But as it was in the 1940s!*

*I could see the old movie posters at the town theatre. I could see an old Chevy DeLuxe and a Chrysler Thunderbird, parked beside the road. A restaurant boasted: “Steak Dinner: $3.95.”*

*It was like walking into a museum from the past, but deserted, abandoned and decaying.*

*None of us could say a word. Cold shock ran through our veins.*

*On a porch beside the road, someone had scrawled a desperate message into the shingles:*

***“God help us all!”***

*What had happened here, we didn’t dare to guess. But something horrific had occurred.*

*We quickly made our way to my farm, but as I suspected, there was nothing but an empty lot. My home had been built in 1963.*

*We retreated back into town square and took refuge in the Baptist Church, at LeeAnn’s insistence. To her, it was the only place she thought could protect us from whatever demons roamed out in the world, searching for us.*

*It was then we began to pontificate more about the situation. We wondered when and how all this had occurred. Esther kept coming back to the power plant outside Brattleboro.What had once been simple rumors and stories began to take on new suspicious relevance. I recounted all I’d witnessed…*

*The soldiers I had seen in town preceding the blackout.*

*Some kind of electrical surge.*

*The disappearances of the townsfolk.*

*The objects and people seemingly lost in time.*

*Had the government been tampering with unknown sciences, pushing the boundaries of physics? Had something gone horribly wrong in the aftermath?*

*And where was Ava and Daniel? Safe from all this? Or themselves lost somewhere beyond my reach?*

*I was leaning more and more toward some kind of government interaction theory, against LeeAnn’s more Biblical one. But frankly, anything was on the table at this point.*

*We didn’t do much that day. Rested on the pews. Ate some food from the backpack I had brought.*

*At night I woke with a start at a loud ruckus from outside. Esther and LeeAnn heard it too.*

*“What the hell is going on out there?” Esther exclaimed.*

*I offered to go out and check. I took the revolver with me. The two of them followed close behind me.*

*In the darkness, we saw a large and looming shape thrashing around the courthouse. Knocking over trash cans, smashing against cars. What we saw was so out of place of our experience, that I had to shake my head to see if it was true.*

*I’m no expert, but the thing looked like a rhinoceros. And I know it sounds insane to say it, but there it was, right in front of us. It was scared and fretting about.*

*“That’s a white rhino,” Esther offered. Like I said, she was whip smart, and well-versed in biology and literature. “But they’ve gone extinct.”*

*“Not this one,” I countered.*

*But she wasn’t amused. She kept trying to relate to me how strange it would be to see such a creature here, let alone this extinct species. I didn’t doubt her. She seemed to know what she was talking about. But before we could figure how a rhino ended up in Vermont, four humanoid shapes approached it from all sides. Slipping out of the darkness.*

*At their approach, the huge beast instantly collapsed, as if suddenly knocked unconscious or dead. It hit the ground with a thud that caused us all to stumble.*

*That’s when the figures caught sight of us and turned their attention our way.*

*“The demons!” LeeAnn shouted as she pointed.*

*But I had it my mind to call them something else:* ***Shepherds***\*.\*

*The ones who had been herding us like so much cattle.*

*Those who wrangled even this giant beast.*

*We turned and ran, as fast as our legs would take us. Down the alley and into the town square. It was there we encountered another strange anomaly —*

*The ground itself had split open, revealing a tunnel below. It was like a glitch in the landscape, for lack of a better word. The asphalt had lifted, unnaturally from the ground, opening like a mouth coming out of the ground. At first we avoided it, but with little other place to hide, I grabbed Esther by the wrist.*

*“We have to go in.”*

*“No,” she protested, yanking her hand away. “I’m not going in there. Thats where thy came from.”*

*But I was firm. I needed to see what was inside. My curiosity was at a boiling point.*

*“I’m going,” I declared. “Hide back in the church if you can.”*

*I threw myself inside. It was dark and cavernous. Deadly quiet.*

*Moments later I heard Esther and LeeAnn’s feet follow after me.*

*And while it seemed somewhat crazy, entering into this ungodly and unnatural place, it was this decision that ultimately helped me to find my way home. Not directly, as you will soon hear, but in a round about sort of way. And if you’ve been following along, you’ve probably figured it out already.*

*Because down that corridor, we made the most shocking discovery of all.*

*But that’s all the time I have today.*

*Also, in reference to your question, I am writing currently from the Capital District Psychiatric Center in Albany, New York. But don’t let that dissuade you from publishing my story. Due to what I ultimately experienced — which I will tell you about in my next letter — they simply want to have me here for observation for a short while. The whole ordeal was quite traumatic and the doctors inform me that they want to make sure I won’t suffer any post traumatic stress.*

*I would like to invite you to come visit me here so that I may tell you more in person, and so that in meeting me, you will be able to decide for yourself about the truth of my story.*

\- *Everett J. McCreary.*

&#x200B;

Yesterday, shortly after the posting of this last entry, two men in suits approached my car in the parking lot of a grocery store. They purported to be representatives from the Federal Bureau Of Investigation. These men informed me that it would not be prudent to continue to post any more of McCreary’s letters. When I asked them why, they refused to comment. I told them it was a free country and I was a member of the press, able to write or post anything I wanted. The left politely and without any further harassment. Nonetheless, the encounter did leave me somewhat shaken.

When I returned home, I found that my office had been ransacked. Papers had been shuffled and my computer was missing. I reported the incident to the local police but as of today they have no leads and don’t seem very intent on pursuing the issue.

I suspect the theft was connected somehow to the two men I encountered. Whether they truly are members of the FBI or not, I do not know.

I want to take a moment now to thank the community. Your comments and advice have been most helpful, as well as your warnings. But in the name of journalistic integrity, I have not been diverted from my goal.

I have also decided that I will accept Mr. McCreary’s invitation to visit him at the hospital to hear his story in greater detail.

Thank you all for your support and advice. I’ll post his [final letter](https://www.reddit.com/user/C_Rand_NYT/comments/y49c0f/i_received_this_series_of_mysterious_emails_has/) in the next installment.

As soon as I get a new computer.

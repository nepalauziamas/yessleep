Below is the third of five letters I received from the former sheriff of Bennington, Vermont detailing some strange events which occurred in the Green Mountains of New England, following an electrical blackout.

The writer is not specific as to the date of the occurrence.

I was able to find a number of local news stories about various electrical blackouts in Vermont, the most severe of which occurred in December of 2013. The writer, however, doesn’t seem to mention any winter weather. Rather, it seems as though the events depicted occurred in the later summer months. Green Mountain Power, which provides electricity to much of the state, including Bennington, lists several blackouts that could be the one described by the Sheriff, but at this point there is no way to know the exact timeframe being referenced from any clues in the letters themselves.

I will continue to pursue this story. You can catch up on the previous letter [in my last post](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/xm61nl/i_received_this_series_of_mysterious_emails_has/). The third letter is enclosed below.

*TO:* [*Rand.Curtis@xxxxxxxxxxxx.com*](mailto:Rand.Curtis@xxxxxxxxxxxx.com)

*FROM:* [*emccreary@xxxxxx.net*](mailto:emccreary@xxxxxx.net)

*SUBJECT: RE: Nowhere*

*——————————————————————————————————*

*To pick up from where I left off…*

*After we heard that scream on the radio, we were all pretty well freaked out. Sheriff Lieu didn’t respond to any further calls. Our assumption was that he was injured or dead. And many of the group were getting fearful. That’s when I decided to strike out on my own.*

*I was in the kitchen packing up a backpack of supplies when Esther caught me.*

*“What are you doing?”*

*“I’m going to head out to Brattleboro, see if I can find Ava and Daniel,” I told her.*

*“Are you crazy? You heard what happened to the Sheriff!”*

*I argued that we didn’t know what happened to him. But either way, I wasn’t going to hang around here, when my wife and child were out there somewhere. I had to know they were safe. And I wanted to reunite with them, wherever they were.*

*But I soon discovered I wasn’t going to trek out alone. Despite my best efforts.*

*Esther demanded to come with me, as did Percy. Even Doc Singh wanted to come, though I urged him to stay behind. He said he had nothing to lose, since his wife had passed, and he too didn’t want to sit around any longer. What could I do? If they wanted to come, they could come. It’s a free country. So we headed off in a group, leaving about ten or twelve others behind. We promised to send word and help as soon as we could.*

*A number of very strange things happened on that hike. I’ll try to remember them all. And I’ll try to get through the story a bit quicker.*

*Sorry about all this by the way, but I don’t really have the ability to write it all out in one message here. Even if I did, I worry they’d confiscate it anyway. That’s why I have to send it in emails. Anyway, here’s what happened…*

*You might think this a little thing but at some point I picked a leaf off a tree. It was starting to brown. And yet it was still rubbery and fresh. Not brittle as one would assume. I kept that leaf in my pocket for a couple days and it never crushed into dust.*

*As we crossed through the town square, the Harvest Festival banner was missing. It had been put up only a few days ago, but now the banner and all signs announcing the coming festival were gone. If people had been rapidly evacuated why had they spent precious time taking down a banner? It didn’t seem to make sense.*

*There’s a big stature of Robert Frost in that square, and below it a quote: “In three words I can sum up everything I learned about life: it goes on.” I never gave much thought to those words, but now they have deep resonance for me.*

*The Baptist Church is located right on the corner of the town square. As we were walking past it, we heard a loud commotion coming from inside. None of us knew what it was, but fearing that someone was trapped inside, we attempted a rescue. The front door had been barricaded, so we had to smash a stained glass window to get in. I hoped that wasn’t a sin.*

*I was walking up the center aisle, Esther had the left aisle, and Percy and Doc Singh had the right. I saw something moving in the shadows behind the pulpit.*

*I clicked on my flashlight and shined around the corner and startled at what I saw.*

*It was LeeAnn Purdy, a teenager girl from town that used to babysit for Daniel years ago.*

*She looked a mess and she seemed to be in shock. Esther had her in school and rushed over to comfort her. The girl kept muttering under her breath, “I thought I was the only one. I thought he only left me.”*

*Finally I asked her what she was talking about, and this is what she said:*

*“Don’t you know what’s happened? He left us. He left us all behind because we’re sinners. I thought I was the only one. But all of us are here because we’re evil. It’s the Rapture. The End Of Days has come.”*

*I’m not a religious person, but something about the way she said it, gave us all a bit of a chill. Doc Singh* *gave her a quick examination. Except for her emotional state, he pronounced her in good health. We offered to walk her back to join the others, but she didn’t want to leave Esther’s side. So she came along with us.*

*Another thing that was very strange occurred as we continued out of town along I-9. What we saw seemed absolutely impossible…*

***The highway itself ended***\*.\*

*Terminated into a crop of forest. It was the most bizarre thing you’ve ever seen, especially since I’d driven this road a thousand times, and I can tell you for sure, it doesn’t just dead end into some trees.*

*This is also where we found Sheriff’s Lieu’s gun.*

*Percy was the one who saw it, laying on the edge of road. A silver service revolver, the same kind I’d carried during my tenure in law enforcement.*

*I checked the chamber. There was one bullet left. I found the other spent shells gathered around. But as I glanced about I couldn’t imagine what he’d been shooting at. There was nothing but open fields and forest all around.*

*I also noticed a trickle of blood on the roadway.*

*I decided to keep the gun in my waistband. The doc didn’t like that much. Thought he should carry it, despite having no firearms training of any kind. But that was actually personal. See, when I was on the force it was Dr. Singh that signed my 5150. He thought I’d had some kind of mental breakdown over not finding the Murrows. In truth, I was just overworked and emotionally stressed. It wasn’t a breakdown. In fact, I think his committing me had more to do with the fact that his wife had left him and run off, but he reported it as a kidnapping and blamed me for never trying to find her. But believe me, there was never any evidence of a kidnapping. But people believe what they want to believe. Most of all, he just wanted me removed as Sheriff, and eventually he got his way.*

*“I don’t feel safe out here,” Esther said.*

*“Me either,” echoed Percy.*

*There was something eerie about the whole scene, and we decided it was time to get off the road anyway and press on through the woods.*

*I used my compass to lead us, but it would be much slower going through the forest than on a highway and I hoped the whole group was up for it.*

*It was getting close to dark when we came to a fence-line.*

*It was a chainlink fence with barb wire on the top, that cut all the way through the woods, as far as one could see.*

*“The military, they put this up to pen us in,” was Percy’s thought.*

*I, for one, had no idea why they’d do that, but there it was, plain as day. And there wasn’t any way to get over it.*

*As it was getting dark, we knew we’d have to make camp for the night and figure out what to do in the morning. Then Percy called me over to show me something in the trees. It was a child’s doll, hanging from a rope from one of the branches. It was so odd and out of place. Creepy.*

*Percy stepped toward it. And I had that strange pit in my stomach that he shouldn’t touch it. I was right. Because when he got close, he suddenly fell through the ground into a 8 foot deep pit. We all rushed over to see if he was okay. And it became immediately obvious that the pit was actually a trap. Like a tiger pit. Someone had built it. Had covered it over with a tarp, then hid it under leaves and brush.*

*Percy wailed in pain. His ankle had been broken and his head gushed blood. We quickly tied some shirts together and were able to pull him out of there. Doc looked after him and stopped the bleeding. Percy wasn’t the kind of man who wanted to be babied. In fact, I’d heard that he once killed a man in a bar fight, but I never knew for sure if that was true. And he never would talk about it.*

*Then there was this faint rumbling in the distance, growing steadily louder. It sounded like the noise you’d hear if a plane flew low and shook your house.*

*It seemed to be coming from the woods. I took the flashlight to investigate. Most everyone followed after me, except Percy, who just waved me off and said to leave him be.*

*The noise was thunderous. It wasn’t an earthquake though. More like a deep mechanical sound. But we couldn’t find anything. That’s when Percy started yelling for help from behind us.*

*We ran back to where we’d left him…*

*He was gone.*

*We searched everywhere, but there was no sign of him. Esther was a wreck, calling out his name with tears streaming down her cheeks.*

*Dr. Singh showed me to a spot where the brush had been crushed. It was a path in the field where someone had been walking. Perhaps whomever had come for Percy had travelled this way, I thought. It led to an open field of tall Johnson grass, up to your waist. But right in the middle of the field, the trail ended. Just stopped.*

*We decided not to tell Esther. She was scared enough as it was. And even more so after LeeAnn offered her explanation…*

*“They talk about this in the Bible. In the End of Days, after the Rapture, when the sinners are left on the earth. That’s when the final battle will happen between us and them?”*

*“Them?”*

*“The demons.”*

*I didn’t put any stock in what she was saying, but Esther and the Doc were pretty well spooked by it all. We determined not to stay put, but instead to continue to search the woods for our friend. We wandered long through the darkness, led only by the two flashlights I had brought. We were all exhausted and scared, but we kept on.*

*Whomever had taken Percy, and for what reason, I couldn’t fathom. But a thought began to tickle at the base of my brain. When I had cut my arm, that’s when something had set upon me. There was blood where Lieu had been taken, and then Percy had been taken just after he cut his head open. It got to wonder if whatever predator was out there, maybe it was akin to a shark, sensing blood or injury, and picking off the sick or hurt.*

*I proposed this to the group with a stern warning about being careful not to injure ourselves. The idea of climbing over the barbwire fence was also ruled out as it was sure to cut one of us open at least.*

*As it turned out, there was an easier solution.*

*I was scanning the grass along the fence-line when I noticed an area of the chain link had been open. A hole, big enough for a person to slip though. Like someone had cut through the wire.*

*I brought the three of them over to it and we all decided to climb through. Even Esther. By now she had figured that whomever took her husband had retreated with him past that fence. She was a tough lady and I respected her. She had enough piss and vinegar to go after them, whomever or whatever they were.*

*My mind was drifting then to the old stories about Bennington. The ones that featured that Bennington Monster that had overturned the stagecoach. And the others about the stones that suck people into the earth. I normally wouldn’t have entertained them, but it was getting late and my mind was wandering. Sometimes those old stories are told for a reason. Maybe there was some truth to them after all. Part of an old Frost poem popped into my head:*

*The woods are lovely, dark and deep*

*But I have promises to keep*

*And miles to go before I sleep,*

*And miles to go before I sleep.*

*We trudged on, until we eventually encountered a small brick house. I recognized it immediately.*

*It was Wade Murrow’s house.*

*But it was sitting out in the middle of the woods, miles from Bennington. This is not where his house had ever been. It was as if someone had picked up from Gage Street and dropped here in the forest.*

*I didn’t want to go inside, but I needed to know. My curiosity was always getting the best of me. So we pushed an open door and slipped into the house.*

*The home was in a state of horrible disrepair. Rotten wood, windows broken, furniture overturned, items piled up in the corners. Someone had set a bonfire inside at one point.*

*But still, it was shelter.*

*And we were exhausted.*

*So we dropped our packs and decided to rest a while.*

*I could see LeeAnn’s eyes getting heavy. And Dr. Singh was like a zombie. He would have collapsed if we’d decided to go any further.*

*Even I was worn out. I plopped down in a chair near the door and put the revolver on my knee, just in case. I’d keep vigil the first shift.*

*Moonlight was shining through the woods. And the rest of them had fallen asleep when I heard the front door open.*

*There was a silhouette standing in the threshold. I grabbed the gun and shouted, waking the others.*

*“Stand back. Who the hell are you?”*

*The figure stepped forward and smiled instantly. My blood ran cold. I felt the tingling start in my spine then run all the way to my fingertips as he spoke.*

*“Everett, you made it. It’s so good to see you,” he said.*

*I blinked my eyes to be sure, but there he was, standing right in front of me for the first time in years.*

*It was my old friend, Wade Murrow.*

*That’s all for now. Gotta go. Sorry.*

\-*Everett J. McCreary.*

Now, I should say that much of the story here begins to strain credulity in my mind. And when I first read the letter, I was beginning to wonder if I was indeed being hoaxed. In fact, even at the first posting of this series, I was still fairly certain that much of what Mr. McCreary said (if he is indeed the sender) was fictitious. But, shortly after the second post, I began to notice someone following me to and from my office. I also observed, on two occasions, men watching me though binoculars. You might think I’m being paranoid, but most people do have a certain spidey-sense about these things.

I also believe that my phone may be tapped, due to a message sent to me by a confidential informant inside the Justice Department that I cannot name.

These occurrences have led me to believe that perhaps Mr. McCreary’s story may have some truth to it, or at least it has garnered the attention of those who may fear its publication. I also suspect that my editor’s reluctance to publish this story may have to do with these incidents. Or someone from the DOJ who may have contacted him. To be fair, though, he has not admitted that to me.

This is also why I continue to post to the community for advice. I do worry for my safety. I appreciate any advice anyone may have.

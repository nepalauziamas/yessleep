As promised, here’s the second letter from the man claiming to be the former sheriff of Bennington, Vermont. The story he first told me shocked me to my very core. You can read for yourself [\[here\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/xg351e/i_received_this_series_of_mysterious_emails_has/). I first thought this was all a hoax, but I ran a check of the people he mentions in the story. They too are actual residents of the town. I was starting to worry at this point though, from where he was writing all this. And why he was acting so secretive.

Here’s the second letter I received.

*TO:* [*Rand.Curtis@xxxxxxxxxxxx.com*](mailto:Rand.Curtis@xxxxxxxxxxxx.com)

*FROM:* [*emccreary@xxxxxx.net*](mailto:emccreary@xxxxxx.net)

*SUBJECT: RE: Nowhere*

*——————————————————————————————————*

*Apologies, Mr. Rand. But I couldn’t finish my story. They only give us a limited time to use the computers. Let me pick up where I left off…*

*Now once I’d walked into a totally abandoned town square, I don’t mind saying, I was pretty freaked out. Anyone would be. But at the time I wasn’t yet panicking. For all I knew, there had been some kind of evacuation effort. Maybe a gas leak or something. Or maybe I just missed the memo that the town square would be shut down to make for some repairs or something. That’s what I thought at the time. But the truth was much worse than that.*

*I should say that Bennington town square is what inspired Shirley Jackson’s* The Lottery, when she was a resident here. At that moment, I had an eerie sense like I was living in the middle of one of her morbid stories.

*I hurried my way back home and arrived just before dark. The whole time I had this distinct feeling that I was being watched. I looked out to the tree line, bathed in the waning orange sun. I saw a crop of trees out there.*

*Movement. But maybe just the wind?*

*I hoped.*

*Until I realized, there wasn’t any wind at all. Not all day, as a matter of fact. Not even a little breeze. Dead still. That was unusual this time of year. I looked back to the tree line and noticed something else —*

***One of the trees was gone.*** *There had been a row of trunks extending down from the canopy of the forest. Had it been a trunk, or was someone tall and thin standing there, arms to its sides, motionless, and I had only mistaken it for a tree trunk? I hurried to the door, but in my haste, stumbled up the steps and caught my hand on a damn nail. Ripped the hand wide open.*

*I cradled it as I went inside. Dripping blood everywhere. But while I was washing it out, I saw shapes moving past the windows. Big monstrous, inhuman shapes, that I can’t even describe. I thought my mind was playing tricks on me.*

*With my hand tied up in a rag and snuck into the living room to hide.*

*There were four of them. I couldn’t make out the features. Just silhouettes in the darkness through the window. Then the door cracked open. And I hid against the wall.*

*I could hear them inside, moving around. I could hear the heavy thuds of their footfalls.*

*The house was completely dark. Still no power from the storm the night before. I waited. Tried to keep my hand from shaking. A creak of wood on the floorboards behind me…*

*I’m not sure what happened after that. In fact I have no memory of it at all. All I know is that I came to on my couch, and I swear to God that my hand was all healed up. Not a scar or a scratch on it. Made me wonder if I had cut it at all. Until I saw the blood in the sink. How it healed up so fast, I’ll never know. And what was in my house or why…I never could tell. You begin to doubt your sanity when that happens. But I know what I saw. Something was in my house.*

*A little while later there was a knock on the door.*

*Outside were about ten or twelve people from town, most all of which I knew. There was Sheriff Lieu, in uniform. My neighbors, Percy and Esther. The local town doctor, Doc Singh. And a handful of others I knew less well.*

*They had been going door to door looking for others left behind like me. The problem was, they were as much in the dark about what happened as I was.*

*“It was probably a quarantine. They took everyone out to keep them away from us. We could all be infected with something,” one of them said.*

*“I heard the government was going to use FEMA to put us in concentration camps,” said another.*

*“Maybe it was a nuke? And they evacuated everyone except us. We could all be irradiated!”“Everyone calm down,” Lieu interceded. “We don’t know anything yet. So let’s just keep our heads until we do know something.”*

*He was right. People are apt to get anxious and scared in these types of situations and very often there’s a mundane reason for everything that, when you look at it the right way, snaps into place.*

*Then the first airdrop happened.*

*We were sitting around on my porch, trading stories with each other trying to put the pieces together. No one theory held up completely. The only thing that seemed curious is that none of us were around others the night of the blackout. I was in the barn. The Sheriff was out on patrol and pulled over under an overpass. The Doctor spent the night in his office going through some patient records. And so on. It was curious, but didn’t add up to much.*

*In the middle of that conversation, we heard a loud crash behind the house. When we went out to check, there were three of four big ole wood crates filled with food. Plain crates. No markings of any kind.*

*“It’s the army. They’re airdropping food to us! That must mean we’ve been abandoned here,” Percy said.*

*I didn’t want to believe him, but what else could it be? The good news is that it probably meant that Ava and Daniel had gotten out. But I needed to be sure. I needed to find them. And I knew I’d die trying, if that’s what it took. When it’s your family, there’s no force on heaven or earth that can stop you. That’s the way I look at it anyway.*

*So I set in my mind to head out to go look for them.*

*“Wait, wait,” Sheriff Lieu protested. “No one is going anywhere. We need to stay put and wait for information about how to proceed.”*

*“From who?” I asked*

*“The government. They know we’re here. There will be some instruction about what to do next.”*

*“But my wife and kid are out there. And I don’t have a way to contact them. I need to see if they’re okay.”*

*I should mention that I’d already asked everyone if they had a working cell phone. No one did. Either the towers were out as well because of the blackout, or no one had charged their phones. Without a working TV or radio, it would be difficult to get any of this news Lieu had hoped for. As it turned out, I wasn’t the only one who thought this way.*

*“He’s right,” said Esther. “How will we hear anything? There aren’t any working phones?”*

*“Does anyone have a CB?”*

*“Or a short wave radio?”*

*“Someone needs to head out to the next town to see what’s going on there.”*

*Then all eyes turned to Lieu. He knew they were right, and nodded his head solemnly. “I’ll go. And report back to everyone what I find, or send help.”*

*Then he clipped a second radio from his belt and handed it to me. “You can use this to keep in touch with me along the way.”*

*I agreed. While I was no longer the sheriff of Bennington, and though we’ve had our differences, I knew that Lieu trusted me at least. Then he headed out.*

*On foot.*

*You see, it was quickly discovered that no one’s cars functioned after the blackout either. This didn’t make much logical sense though. A storm wouldn’t knock out the power of individual automobiles. That led some to speculate more strongly that a nuclear weapon had been denoted nearby and the resulting electromagnetic pulse was the reason for all the electronics being defunct.*

*“Or maybe a meltdown at the power plant,” suggested Percy.*

*“That wouldn’t cause an EMP wave,” countered Doctor Singh.*

*“Then what? There’s a lot of strange things going on at that plant, Doc.”*

*Singh just shook his head. People were going to get hysterical if a logical explanation didn’t present itself soon. I knew that about human nature. People needed to have things make sense. It’s just the way we’re built.*

*I looked across my field to a hill in the far pasture. That’s when I saw two figures standing there, awkwardly, in the broad daylight no more than a couple hundred yards away.*

*“Who are they?” I asked.*

*Esther saw them too. As did the rest of the group. We just turned and stared at them. And they stared back. Blank faces. No movement.*

*I waved my hand to them and called out, but they didn’t respond. They were both male, but dressed oddly in what I can only describe as Pilgrim costumes. And by Pilgrim, I mean like the outfits worn in any depiction of the arrival of The Mayflower on Plymouth Rock — those kind of Pilgrims: the black tri-corner hats, breeches and vests. It seemed so odd and out of place.*

*“Let’s see who these fellas are,” announced Percy, as he trotted off toward them. I followed behind as did a few of the others. As we approached, though, the men slowly retreated down the hill and out of view.*

*Percy and I sprinted to the top of the hill. When we reached the crest though, they were gone. It was strange. We both felt as if we had seen an apparition, because on the other side of the hill was nothing but empty fields for thirty acres. There was nowhere they could have gotten so fast to that we wouldn’t have seen them.*

*I wondered who those strange men were, and my mind couldn’t help but drift to the words of Abby Murrow as she died in my arms. Could these have been the Shepherds she mentioned?*

*Later that night, we all sat on my porch, waiting for any report from Sheriff Lieu. The nearest big town to Bennington is a place called Brattleboro, about 40 miles down I-9. Incidentally, the old power plant was located just outside of that town to the South. And most folks often went to Brattleboro to take advantage of its slightly better Walmart and a couple few restaurants that they liked better than our own. It was also were Ava’s mother lived, and if she had taken off, my bet was that she went there.*

*It was just after 8pm, when the radio chirped.*

*The message was distorted, but to the best of my recollection, the sheriff said something like, “I see them. They’re after me. Oh my god —”*

*I keyed the mike, asking him to clarify, but I must have cut him off, because he gave no response. We heard the squelching of the mike, but no answers to my repeated questions.*

*“Sheriff! Are you there? Are you okay. Sheriff? Please respond. Sheriff? Bill?”*

*We looked at each other. Everyone was frightened. You can’t imagine a situation like that, wondering what’s happening on the other end. Seconds seemed like hours. Then the mike keyed one last time.*

*All we heard after that were gunshots.*

***Followed by*** ***an ear-piercing scream***\*.\*

*That’s all I’ve got for time for today. Will tell you the rest as soon as I’m able.*

\-*Everett J. McCreary.*

This time, the letter writer signed his middle name with just J instead of James. I’m not sure if that’s a clue he was sending or just an oversight. Either way, by this point I was getting somewhat intrigued by the details.

I also looked into some research on government quarantines and procedures. I could find no record of any official or reported quarantine of Bennington, Vermont. And the procedures he described didn’t seem to fit any of those dictated by FEMA or any government agency. Had he truly experienced a mysterious mass disappearance case? Or was something more sinister going on?

His emails only got more bizarre from here on out. Will send the next one in the [following post.](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/xs0puy/i_received_this_series_of_mysterious_emails_has/)

It was the middle of June. The school year was in the process of ending. I studied for finals an hour every other day at best. Despite the stress of it, I was excited about summer break. I was expecting to go on a couple of trips, see some cool things. I was excited, but after what happened, I'm afraid a little bit of anxiety will be lingering in the back of my head for the course of the summer. Probably for the next year.


I was sitting in my Period 3 class when it began.


"Hello, this is your Principal, Mr. Sanderson. An intruder who has entered the school. Teachers, make sure your doors are locked. Students, hide out of the view of every window. This is not a drill."


A scream filled the air, cut off by the announcement ending. My stomach sank a bit. Hopefully this wouldn't last long and nobody would be hurt, I thought to myself. I got out of my seat and clamored with the others to the spot farthest away from the windows. A spot near a row of desks at the far end of the classroom. The teacher locked the door, switched the lights off, then she sat down with us. As we remained silent, four screams echoed from down the hallway. Each of them were followed by a loud thud. My heart began to speed up. That stuff didn't sound too good.


After another minute, there was a fifth scream, one that sounded a lot closer. It was cut off by a louder thud. My nerves began to choke me. I hadn't experienced a school lockdown like this before. In fact, the school I went to was lucky. The school across town would get at least one disturbance each year. This is the first disturbance this school has had since 2016. Those disturbances were normal ones though.


One weird thing was that I hadn't heard a single noise other then the echoing screams, but that was when I heard low sounding thumps coming from out in the hallway. They got louder… closer… they were chilling, in fact. I couldn't tell what could've been making the noise. I had never heard such sounds before. They were uncanny. Chilling. They sounded familiar, but at the same time, I had never heard a sound like it. I can't describe it in good enough detail. I only ever felt chills that deep when watching a scary movie.


While my unease got worse, the ceiling began to vibrate. A machine-like howl echoed from the mini-presentation room next door. What followed was a loud crash. I couldn't tell what was going on in there, but I could speculate. Thinking about it, trying to understand it based on nothing concrete, only made my nerves worse.


The low thumping continued. I glanced towards my classmates. There were looks of confusion, looks of terror, one making a blank facial expression, and some heads buried behind legs. I could guess I had a terrified expression myself. Some weird things were happening and it sounded like something was destroyed next door. I didn't want to know what was about to happen next.


Out of the corner of my eye, I saw the teacher take out her phone. I looked away, but I overheard her talk to herself.


"No service?" She asked.


I found it weird that her cell service signal would cut off like that, assuming she didn't think it would cut off randomly, based on her vocal expression. It didn't make any sense the more I thought about it. As I thought to myself, I noticed the outline of the trees outside was a bit off. I hesitated to get a better look though, as I didn't want the intruder to see me.


Things were silent again for some time. At one point, I noticed the air smelled cleaner than usual. My focus on the air was broken by the sound of pairs of boots speeding past the classroom.


"Don't focus on it. We know what's there. If you look at it, it will torture you," a female voice said.


"What is it digging for?" Another female voice asked.


"Keep quiet. People can hear," the first one responded.


Digging? It? I wanted to know what was going on. Why were we being intruded on by it? What was it? While I was curious, I was too afraid to find out. It sounded weird and destructive enough. It was dangerous. That's all I needed to know.


"Get back!" I heard the voices say as they echoed from down the hallway.


An eerie roar filled the air. Everything in the room began to shake. Once the roar stopped, the sound of claws clattering around began to come from next door. Awkward sounding growls that also sounded like the roar of machines followed. It sounded like a bunch of dogs had infested the room next door, but these dogs sounded off. After a couple more seconds, I heard three loud bangs. It sounded like somebody was trying to break the door down next door. The sound of wood hitting the ground surprised me. The door was taken down in seconds. Whatever those animalistic sounding things were, it sounded like they got their exit.


The sounds of claws and growls sped by our classroom. They didn't sound natural or normal at all. They alone sent chills down my spine.


Only seconds later, there was a banging on our classroom door. It was followed by intense scratching noises. I looked over at the door. I hoped whatever those things were would be stopped by somebody. The scratching continued. At one point, a claw pierced through the door, sending pieces of wood flying across the room. I held myself still. I had no idea what to do in the case of an attack like this, other than hiding. There was nowhere to run to at all. An intruder could break down the door at any moment. My heart was pounding. I was hoping my friends were okay.


The intense scratching on the door continued for some time until whatever was making it let out an erratic growl. The chilling growl went on for a few seconds, then it, along with all the other growls and scratching sounds, just stopped. Everything was silent again. I looked back over at the door. A purple smoke-like substance was beginning to leak through the hole in the door.


"What's happening out there?" The teacher asked herself.


I don't remember what happened right after that. All I know is that I was laying down in the hallway, right outside the classroom. I felt cold, sweaty, and my mind was racing with blank thoughts. I couldn't recall what had happened right after the teacher asked herself what was going on. Although, I could recall some of what I felt. It was chaotic, chilling, and dreadful. Trying to recall it felt as if I was trying to recall a fading dream.


I picked myself up. There was a tingling on both of my arms. I looked at them to see if there was anything on them. The lights were off, however, so I couldn't see them. I stepped back into the classroom, where there was sunlight shining in through the windows. The first thing I noticed was that the classroom was empty. No tables, no chairs, no people… just empty space. I looked at the windows. The view outside was very different from what I was used to. It was just grass, with a few trees scattered about. The concrete, fences, nearby buildings and parked cars were gone. A dirt road was in the place of the paved road I was familiar with.


I glanced at my arms. They were clean, aside from there being a mark on my lower right arm. A circle with a downwards pointing arrow going through it. Out of habit, I flipped the light switch. The lights didn't come on, however. I looked out into the hallway, noticing the door to the classroom across the hallway was open. Usually, a teacher's desk sat in the corner of that room, within view from the doorway. But it wasn't there. I walked over into the room to find it was empty as well. What happened? I wondered. Where did everybody… and everything… go?


If everything was moved and nobody was around, that had to mean the situation was over, right? I hoped. I was still anxious though. I peeked back out into the hallway, but I looked down the hallway in each direction. There was nothing down either end of the hallway. Of course, it was dark in most of the hallway, but every classroom door was open, letting some sunlight shine into the hallway.


I looked back out into the hallway. I saw nothing to my left. It was perfectly empty. I then looked to my right. For a second, I thought there was nothing in that direction. Then I noticed something was moving towards me at a slow pace. It took up the entire hallway from floor to ceiling, wall to wall, yet it was able to move forward. I couldn't make out what it was. It was pitch black, darker than the dark corners of the hallway. It made a light sweeping sound as it moved. It covered each doorway as it moved by, blocking the daylight shining into the hallway. It looked alive, but I didn't understand how it could be a living thing. It was uncanny. A pit formed in my stomach from just not being able to understand it.


As simple as it was, it was so uncanny. I stepped back into the classroom and shut the door. I took a couple steps back too. Although I didn't know what the mass was, I assumed it was part of the attack. I didn't know what it wanted, but I wasn't going to risk getting too close to it.


I stared out the small window on the classroom door for what felt like a few minutes. The dark mass wasn't covering the window or moving by at all. I could still see the interior of the classroom across the hallway. I was confused. I wasn't going to go back out there until it passed by, but what was it doing? I asked myself.


I'm not sure how long I waited. The clock above the door was stuck at 1:51 PM, so there was no way to be sure. I can only guess that it was a few minutes. Thinking the dark mass wasn't going to move, I walked up to the door. I opened it up. When I looked to my right, there it was. The dark mass. It was still there, sitting still, maybe two feet away from me. I stared at it in confusion. Chills ran down my spine as I took in its blank, dark, uncanny appearance.


I ducked out of the room. I hesitated to look behind me. I sped walked down the hallway. As I ran, I noticed there weren't any objects in the other classrooms either. When I saw the exit doors, I lunged towards them. Once I reached them, I pushed up against them, as they'd open when you pushed them. However, instead of bursting out of them, I slammed into them. They didn't open. I pushed them again, but they didn't budge. I turned my head back. The dark mass was about 10 rooms down, climbing towards me at a moderate pace. I ducked into the nearest room to my left, which happened to be the front office. I slammed the door shut.


I looked around the room. The front desk was still there, but the rest of the room was empty. That was aside from dozens of papers that were strewn all over the room. Ironically, there was only one piece of paper on the front desk. It was a sticky note with something written on it.


"Don't go into Room 127."


Room 127 was the classroom next to my Period 3 classroom. The classroom those crashing noises came from earlier on. Of course, I was going to follow what the note read. I still didn't want to know what was going on in there. I did recall seeing the door to that classroom being the most wide open as I was running from the dark mass. I didn't take a good look into the room, however.


I looked out the window. The black mass covered it. There was definitely no way I was leaving the room, unless I broke a window. Unfortunately, I couldn't find anything I could use to break any windows. The pit in my stomach grew deeper. There was no way out until that mass went away.


I stepped up to the small window on the door to get a close look at the black mass. As uncanny and chilling as it was, my curiosity was off the charts. I peered out the window. All I could see was a throbbing blackness. It looked blurry, but solid at the same time. A pit formed in my stomach again.


After what felt like an hour, I looked out the window again. The blackness was still there, throbbing. I walked up to the window on the far end of the room, hoping somebody was around. As I looked outside, I couldn't see anybody. No one was out there. It was just a sunny field, which I found to be kinda ironic. The dread within me got a tiny bit deeper.


The thumps returned, but they were coming from the floor above. Great, I thought. The ceiling began to shake and crack. At least, that's the best I can describe it. I jolted into the counseling office. Once there, I watched as the ceiling in the main room fell to the ground. Something came down with it. It took me a couple of seconds to piece together what I was looking at. When I began to comprehend it, a wave of dread washed over me. All I knew was that I was looking at a blurry figure. One that felt like 100 malicious souls that were giving me death stares. As I comprehended it a bit more, it became clear to me that it was wearing some sort of cloak or armor or some combination of the two. My head began to ache as I tried to make out his getup, so I looked away.


At least, it only took me a second to come up with a theory for why it crashed the ceiling to the ground as an entrance. He must have wanted to let his creatures get to the upper floor quicker.


The sound of heavy digging filled the room. I glanced sideways at whatever was going on. The thing was seamlessly digging into the ground. The last time a thing dug through the ground, a dozen growling things crawled out, as far as I heard. By association, dread washed over me. I shut the door.


As I prepared for the worst, multiple bangs shook the door. With each bang, the door cracked a little. After three, the door flew off its hinges. The thing with the cloak armour stepped in. It picked me up by my shoulders, squeezing my torso to the point where I could barely breathe. It brought me over to the hole it dug in the middle of the office. Dirt and debris were scattered everywhere. I looked down into the hole. It was pitch darkness, but I could hear the sounds of animalistic screeching. A lot of them echoed. My heart was pounding against my chest.


As I anticipated the worst, the sound of combustion came from outside. It was followed by a loud screech that sounded like a human scream. I looked at the small door window. The black mass fell. Thick dark grey smoke obscured the view from the window. The way the cloak armor guy was gripping me made me unable to take deep breaths. I began to feel light headed.


The door creaked open. A silver bar flew into the room, bouncing off of the desk. At this point, my vision was slipping away. A white flash filled the room. I saw a second of it before passing out.


I awoke some time later. I was sitting in the school auditorium. The lights were back on. An uptempo pop song was playing from the loudspeakers. It was being played annoyingly loud. Luckily it was just a fast drumbeat and a singer. Dozens of other students were there too. It clicked into my head that an average assembly was happening, but I didn't remember one being scheduled for that day. I looked over to my right. The kid sitting beside me was sleeping. I looked over to my left. The kid sitting on my left was lifting his head up. I took a look ahead. A bunch of other kids were lifting their heads. Some of the others looked fast asleep. Where were these people? I wondered.


Two people in suits were standing on the stage with the secretary, who was adjusting his shirt while standing still. After the song ended, he walked up to the microphone.


"Attention, students. Now that you're all awake or waking, I would like to address the mishap we had today. Luckily, none of you have sustained any more than some bruises. As for Principal Sanderson and the school officers… Unfortunately, they all had to be taken to the hospital. As for all of you, no one will believe that our school was taken over by the things we saw. We don't have any footage of the ordeal that we can show anybody, so it's best to look sane and call it a wild animal attack rather than have a psych look after us because someone thought we were crazy. And it is possible that it was just a gas leak, but we haven't gotten confirmation yet," he said.


Whatever happened felt like a dream at that point. I wanted to believe it was a dream, or a gas leak induced hallucination, but the Principal was taken to the hospital… I mean, a wild animal attack sounds about right, but it was more than that. No matter what it was though, I just wanted to get back home.


After it ended, we all exited the school. I looked around to get a look at the field, but it was gone. The pavement, parked cars, and buildings were back. I was downright confused.


When I got back home, my parents were standing outside. They hugged me, then they asked me what happened.


"An… animal… some wild animals somehow got in. Only the Principal and the school officers were hurt," I said.


That evening, I checked the local news. There was a report about my school having gone into lockdown due to a wild animal. It mentioned the thing about Principal Sanderson and the school officers being put in the hospital. There was no mention of the armor guy or the dark mass, or any of the destruction. The only pictures in the article were of the Principal and the school officers. None of the creatures or the destruction. There was nothing about a mystery field or a sudden dirt road either. According to the article, the police showed up in minutes, went in, then they came out two hours later.


What was up with the field then? I asked myself.


There were no witness reports either. There weren't any video news reports on YouTube, or any tweets about the ordeal whatsoever. I chalked most of the social media silence up to the fact the school was in a small town a hundred miles away from any city. The nearest city only being Eugene.


As I sat confused, I remembered the mark I saw on my arm. I turned my wrist towards my face. The mark was still there. I Googled the marking to see if anything would come up, but nothing like it came up.


I asked my friends if they remembered what happened. They told me they didn't want to talk about it. The next I attended school, I walked by the main office room. There was cardboard taped up over the windows. Everything else was normal. The desks were back, the chairs were back, and the lights were working again.


I still don't understand what happened that day. I don't even know why everyone disappeared, yet we all experienced it. One friend of mine told me he was being chased by a dark mass all alone. In the same rooms I was in. Yet, I didn't see or hear him. Everytime I think about dark spaces, a light sense of dread washes over me. I hope somebody gets to the bottom of what happened. Sooner or later.


I'm happy to get this out. I hope I will be able to enjoy the rest of this summer as much as I can, without my nerves getting too bad. I don't know why it happened and I don't know whether or not it'll happen again.

[Thank you for your concern, but it's not necessary.](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/v8p7l1/confessions_of_a_tarot_card_reader_line_in_the/)  

Really, the fact that I can come here and pour my heart out is... well... I suppose it's something, isn't it?

I mean, I could tell you anything and you'd take it as fact.  That's the beautiful thing about the internet.  It's a lovely thing when you take a minute and think about it.  Not that what I've just mentioned should sway you in the slightest from believing me when I tell you of my most recent adventure.

My deck, my lovely new deck is so much more than its predecessor.  I know I said previously that I wasn't sure of it, but I say now with full confidence that I am stronger and better with it in my life.

The old deck was reactive.  It had to be called upon.  This deck is *proactive*.  It doesn't wait for things to react to, it creates its own opportunities.

I'd just left Cecily and Roj and I know many of you were concerned that I'd made a rash decision, but trust me when I say I'm better off without them.  They were weights around my neck, holding me back when I'm meant to lead.  I've already accomplished a good deal since separating from them.  For starters, the divide in Oceanview is as apparent as ever and thanks to my actions today, growing rapidly.  Again, I owe this to my new deck.

I needed a new place to stay, somewhere I wouldn't be so easily found just to avoid the distractions of having to deal with interlopers.  Straight off, I knew the perfect location:  Jumpin' Jacks.  I know it sounds predictable and redundant, but I was certain no one would think to look for me here. Not even Cecily. My first few nights there passed without incident.  I took pleasure in witnessing the upheaval my message had caused, mostly because the gambit of having done it paid off when several of my would-be rivals were taken care of for me.

Even still, I knew it was only a matter of time before someone would connect the dots.  That, too, was part of my plan.  I'd left enough bread crumbs for the right people to follow and follow they did.

**Insidious Injustice** guided me through it all.  He is a truly glorious card, a delightful little whisper in the back of my mind that sees ten steps ahead of even the most advanced saboteur.  

**Hellfire** finished them off when they came knocking.

Jumpin' Jacks is now a pile of smoldering ash and I am temporarily homeless. But now the Hag knows better than to mess with me and is looking for new henchmen as I write this.

This wouldn't be a post if it weren't for something questionable occurring, something that leads me to seek help from the lot of you.  Though it pains me to have to admit this, I will.  If only because I'm hopeful someone might have some advice.

There's a part of me that almost held back.  A small sliver of myself that didn't want the chaos I worked so hard to nurture and create.  This insignificant speck of light almost overpowered my better sense.

I know it sounds laughable to most of you but you must understand how terrifying it is to have something like this inside you.  Something that could take hold at any moment and rob you of what you value and treasure most.

It's not physical and I can't fight it.  And no matter how hard I look I can't find it again.  But I know it's there and it's waiting for an opportunity to take hold.  My deck confirmed this and it told me I had to rid myself of it but when I pressed for answers as to *how*, it remained stubbornly silent.

So I went in search of the answer for myself. It was a risk, I knew, because I had no doubt Cecily and Roj would try to "save" me if they found me.  Fortunately, my deck promised me they'd be otherwise engaged and I had no reason to doubt my deck.

While I didn't know what I was looking for, I hoped I'd know it when I saw it.  Besides, I secretly reveled in the opportunity to witness my handiwork and I wasn't disappointed.  The tension within Oceanview was as palpable as a thick, juicy steak and almost as delicious.  Because the good people of Oceanview didn't suspect me, they didn't shun me.  They shared whatever news they had by way of warning me who and what to watch out for.  I was pleased to learn word of the inferno at Jumpin' Jacks had already circulated with rumors running rampant as to who was behind it.

My inquiries into how to protect myself from "unwanted interferences" were met with ready advice but none of it was useful.  Disappointed, I set out in search of my new home.

My next recollection was Cecily and Roj looming over me.  Cecily had bound my wrists and looked like hell.  Roj didn't look much better.  I was delighted at their misery, but disappointed my deck hadn't kept its promise.

The truly frightening part is the sliver I spoke of earlier, that insignificant sliver felt stronger and brighter in their presence.  Cecily was calling to it.  I don't know how but she was.  It was strong enough that I nearly fell to it but the feeling of losing myself to it sparked enough fear based adrenaline that I was able to call upon my deck.

They weren't expecting it.

They didn't know I had mastered the ability.

The cords binding my wrist turned into snakes that coiled protectively around my arm and lashed out at Cecily.  She fell back with a scream, radiating fear of her own.  It was intoxicating.  I grabbed onto her hand to prevent her from escaping as one of the snakes sunk its fangs into her arm.

"I warned you," I said, truthfully.  "Stay away."

I released her hand and the snakes disappeared.  Roj grabbed Cecily and they both backed away from me.  I marveled at the sight of them cowering before I left.  Drunk on the high, I decided to leave another message for everyone to enjoy.

Though it lacked the shock and awe of my first, I think I made it perfecty clear they won't be rid of me anytime soon.  [I'm here to stay](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/vm3moj/confessions_of_a_tarot_card_reader_the_light/).

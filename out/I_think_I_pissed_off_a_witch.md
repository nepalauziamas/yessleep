I don't know if I even believe this myself. I feel like I'm going insane.

My wife and I house flip. We buy a house, empty it out, pretty it up, and sell it. We bought a house in Jan of 2019 for a little under 28000. It had asbestos ceiling, so we had it torn out and the house emptied out, but we can't do as much as we used to. We were about to have to take a hit on this house, but we found a young couple woth kids that wanted to owner finance. We got them to sign for 90000, which was great. They paid deposit and have been paying monthly.

We found out that the couple had moved away for work, but they still sent a check, so it wasn't an issue. A couple times the check came a day late, but we had told them to have it postmarked by the first, and it was, so we couldn't really do much about it. It was annoying, and my wife started telling them to pay a week or so early. I had noticed that the yard looked pretty bad.

A month ago, I got a cash offer on the house, 35000. My wife and I talked, and we decided to take the house back and go through with the sale. We returned that months check to the parents that lived down the road, and left them a note for the couple explaining that we dissolved our contract and the house and everything in it was ours now. 

We immediately went from there to the house and started clearing it out. We found a bunch of horrible stuff in one of the bedroom, which had a lock and we had to damage the frame to open it.

 There was a plastic dresser full of spices and crystals and a bunch of random junk, a bunch of weird books, and handwritten journals full of symbols. No language I could recognize. It honestly looked like a bunch of m's and y's, fancied up in different styles. There were boxes and boxes of candles and jars, every color. The whole thing freaked my wife out, so I had to clear this out by myself.

After all the work to clear the house, we did a walkthough of the house with the new buyer, and he changed his mind. So we started looking for a new buyer.
The thing is, since then, everything is going wrong. Where do I begin?

 My wife's dog was run over

A pipe burst in our house while we were out of town for 2 weeks, so a bunch of stuff got ruined. 

My wife got in a minor wreck, but her car had to go to the shop the day before my car just gave out.

Every possible deal for that house falls through. I don't know why, it's a nice enough house.

My girlfriend confessed that she was born a man. I can't even process this.

Everyone we usually hang out with is avoiding us, we don't know why.

I have nightmares that get worse every night, all inside that house.

There were two dead birds in our fireplace this morning.

Our fridge went out yesterday. 

I'm using my old phone because mine won't even turn on.

There's a bunch more, but you get the picture.

When we were doing yet another walk through yesterday, the not-buyer picked up a folded piece of paper off the window sill and handed it to me. The top was covered in black wax. It was just a paper with more random symbols on it. I apologized to the not-buyer and explained I thought I'd cleared everything out, and stuck it in my pocket.

I don't believe in this stuff. I don't believe in this.

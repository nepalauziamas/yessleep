Disclaimer i used fake names!!!!

When i (female) was about 11-12 years old, (so going into grade 6) i had always had a hard time making friends, around that time because i was going threw puberty and was considered the “weird kid” and was bullied a lot in grade 3-5. 
 
Because of this i started to make online friends. There was about 6 of us and we all had a big group chat and texted a lot threw snapchat and or made musicallys about each other (this was in 2016-2017). There was me, a girl named Cookie, and another girl named Sam. Sam and Cookie were a little closer to each other then the rest of the girls but us 3 talked pretty much every single day. 

Fast forward into us 3 talking everyday for about a year, Cookie decided to get a plane ticket to where me and Sam lived (me and Sam lived in the same state just at different ends of it and Cookie lived about 5 states away from us). So threw the 6-3 months of us knowing about her coming we talked to are parents about it and they made sure we had all the information about HER MOTHER (that’s a key detail). This include a background check and conversations over the phone.  There trip to visit Sam and i was going to be about a 3 week vacation for Cookie so they had made a lot of different plans to go out and do since they were on vacation. 

The day has finally came where i was going to meet Cookie and Sam (Sam was already there but im not going to go into detail about there story since it’s their story and i don’t want to share information about her she doesn’t want out).  My family and i get to the hotel they were staying at. The only adult there to greet my family was Cookies mom. My parents go to the pool and end up having a couple drinks they get food and just have conversations about whatever and never once did she bring up that Cookies dad was there. Me, Cookie, and sam go back up into the hotel room. When we get there and walk into the hotel room her father is there.  at the time i didn’t see anything wrong with it but looking back i am noticing that it was a little off since her parents were not together anymore, and me and sam had no idea he was going to be there even though us 3 were talking about it for months.  Other then that nothing seemed out of the blue so i ended up going back to the pool to say goodbye to my family. 

so now my parents are gone and it’s just Me, Sam, Cookie, and Cookies Mother and Father. They had planned on going to a amusement park but since i couldn’t afford to go my mom (i wasn’t living with her at the time) had came and picked me up and drop me back off to stay with Cookie the following week.

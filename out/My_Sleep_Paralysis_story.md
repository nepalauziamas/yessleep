This experience has caused me to lose sleep on almost an everyday basis. For some context, I am currently a 20 year old man with sleep issues, issues I never had before my experience and I will probably never sleep the same again. Further context, at the time of this incident I was 16 and it was during the school summer in Georgia.

I had gone to bed early that night because I had been working for my dad earlier at his business which of course is a lot of manual labor, so I was pretty tired. I didn’t want anything more than to sleep for more than 8 hours and chill the next day. So with that said I fell asleep pretty fast and was enjoying a nice dream when all of a sudden I wake up.

When I awoke, I was already feeling like I had been awake for a while, full of energy for some reason. I go to get up and move to possibly see if my body was telling me to go to the bathroom. I wasn’t able to move. My eyes were open, I am fully conscious and can think clearly, but no movement other than my eyes. 

“Great” I thought, “sleep paralysis”

This wasn’t my first sleep paralysis experience by any means so I wasn’t worried or anything, as calm as can be. I started looking in my room waiting for it to wear off. My room is fairly spacious and for a bit of extra information I sleep opposite of the door leading into my room and the door leading to the bathroom. My bed is in between two windows and my closet is to the right of my bed. Past the window

I scan my room out of boredom and curiosity. I’m look at my door and then the bathroom door, but then next to the bathroom door, is a corner and it was looking really dark, darker than usual, not that I check how dark it is anyway, but it seemed so much darker than the rest of the room. I’m staring for a couple seconds and when I notice the darkness itself starts shifting, moving.

I just stare at it, without fear wondering what it was but it didn’t take long to find out. The darkness because a shape, one with a buck like head and it slowly drifted itself over to me. I leaned over and we stared at each other, I wasn’t scared, I knew my body was still asleep and thought it was cool how it projected this being through my eyes. I stared at it, studying it. I gained control of my neck and mouth all of a sudden, yet my torso and down were still in the trance.

I decided to speak to it, and It was probably the worst thing I could have said.

“You’re not real” I told this dark creature.

I thought it was funny for some reason but it made the thing move. It put its face up to mine and I saw a hand and arm come out of its body and it slowly made its way toward my neck. I was calm, wondering if this would be the last act of my sleep paralysis dream. It reached for my neck and it did something I wasn’t prepared for.

It touched me, this dark creature, touched me. I started to panic as it continued to wrap its hand around my neck. I hadn’t been afraid or fearful up to now and now I was in a full lockdown of terror. It grabbed my neck and started squeezing, I felt it’s hand grow tighter and tighter and it was becoming harder and harder to breath. My body finally entered fight and flight and I regained control of my limbs, I was close to blacking out and then I took a good look at its face and swung. It went right through it but the thing backed off and hung in the air. It then slowly dissipated back into the corner of which it came. I jumped and ran to the bathroom, splashed water on my face and my heart sank. 

“I’m awake” I said out loud

I looked at my neck and paused in terror, finger markings were there, all white from pressure and the single handed strangling. I moved and looked at my watch sitting on the counter, it was only 2am. I didn’t sleep the rest of the night, I didn’t try, I went into my kitchen and made coffee. I drank it till the morning.

That’s my story, I have more but they’re actual dreams, but Terrifying nonetheless. I hope this is a good read. I’ll answer any questions as fast as I can if any arise, thank you.

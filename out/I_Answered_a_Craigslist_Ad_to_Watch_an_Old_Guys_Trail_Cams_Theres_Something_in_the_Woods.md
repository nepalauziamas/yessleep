Part 1

Let me start by saying, I am not an outdoorsy person. I don’t work out for fun, I’m mildly allergic to bees and pollen and poison ivy, and I despise being muddy, or sticky, or damp. I enjoy nature in that I enjoy smoking blunts in hammocks, and indulging in the occasional recreational mushroom. Maybe that makes me an unreliable narrator for what I’m about to tell you, I guess you can be the judge.

I’ve spent most of my life as a pretty typical disappointment- dropped out of college, got dumped by my longtime girlfriend shortly after, and about a year ago, got myself fired from my close-to-minimum wage job at the local liquor store. Yeah, my parents are real proud.

Everyone told me I’d find a new dead end gig in no time- “everywhere is hiring! There’s a worker shortage!” I found out pretty quickly that despite the 50+ spam emails I got from Indeed every day, nowhere seemed to be interviewing. It’s not like I have a *bad* resume- I even have some pretty good references. I may not be anything special, but I wasn’t unreliable. But as my bills started to pile up, and my savings started to dwindle, I was desperate. Literally any job would do at this point.

So when a friend sent me the link from Craigslist, I pretty much jumped at the opportunity, not even caring that this job was absolutely not a good fit for me.

NIGHT TRAIL CAM MONITORS WANTED FOR PRIVATE PROPERTY. NO EXPERIENCE NEEDED. SHIFT 7pm-7am. GOOD PAY.

I called the number listed and immediately went to voicemail. Not the best sign, but again, I was desperate. “Uh, hi, my name is Sam. I saw your ad online, and I’m interested in the job-”

I was cut off by someone scrambling to the phone- a landline?? In 2022?

“Who the fuck is this?” a voice growled.

“Um, my name is Sam?” I started again, “I saw-”

“The fuck do you want? Why are you calling me?” the voice definitely belonged to an old man, that much I could gather.

“I saw your job posting on Craigslist for the trail cam thing,” I managed to answer before I could be interrupted again, “I’m interested.”

There was a pause. “Are you sure? What’s your name? You know it’s overnight?”

I hesitated, looking over at a letter on my kitchen table. A final notice for my electric bill. I sighed. “My name is Sam. Yes, I’m sure.”

—

My new boss is probably approaching 90 years old, and looks like a Scooby Doo villain. His name is Patrick, and he owns about 75 acres of woods in the middle of nowhere. My “interview” wasn’t questions about me, in fact, it seemed more like Patrick was trying to talk me out of taking the job, despite repeating over and over that he was desperate for the help.

“See, with this much property, you get a lot of trespassers, you know? I don’t need stupid kids scampering all over, falling into ravines, carving stupid shit into my trees, that kind of thing. And it’s dangerous out there at night, never know what can be lurking out there. My son installed cameras on my trails, but I didn’t know how to get them up and running until now. And look, kid, I’m too old to be staying up all night making sure the high school football team doesn’t get eaten by bears.” Patrick grumbled, showing me around the security cabin that would become my office. It was a one room building, with a desk surrounded by 12 or so monitors streaming live footage from around the property. A map was stuck to one of the walls, showing the various trails in the area, and a tattered blue rug decorated the floor. And, ominously, a old looking rifle was mounted above the door.

“Bears?” I raised an eyebrow. “You think anyone would come out here at night if there’s bears?”

Patrick glared at me over his half moon glasses. “Sam, right? Listen. This job ain’t for most people. I’m asking you to stay up all night and watch these cameras and not ask too many questions. Couple years back, we had a girl in town go missing. You remember hearing about that?” He didn't wait for me to answer, but I vaguely recalled the news about it. “Laura something-or-other. Fifteen. Came out here to my woods with some friends thinking they could get a fun little buzz in the forest. And then the drunken idiot tripped down a hill and bumped her head real good, and the cops found her five days later, after tearing my land apart and stomping all over the place. I don’t want it happening again.”

“That’s awful,” I replied. Patrick tilted his head slightly, as if this answer surprised him.

“Sure, yeah, awful. One of many awful things that can happen here at night. So, look, you watch these cameras, and if you see anything out of sorts, anyone who shouldn’t be here, you take that rifle there and you go chase it off my property.” I almost wanted to laugh- this guy was the “get off my lawn” old man in the extreme.

“Even bears?” I asked sarcastically.

The old man seemed to snap for a second. “I already said this job isn’t for everybody, especially not snarky little shits who won’t take it seriously. No, stupid, you don’t have to chase fucking bears out of the woods. Now do you want it or not?”

“Sorry, yeah, yes, I’ll do it,” I said quickly.

“Great, you can start tomorrow,” Patrick snarled, starting to back out of the cabin, “And one more thing, Sam. Don’t ever fucking smoke reefer in this cabin, I’ll know.”

My first couple weeks here have been uneventful. Most nights all I see are the occasional fox or deer, or once, a large snake slithering across one of the many paths on the property. It’s been an easy job, and I kill the hours alone with plenty of snacks, and- fuck you, Patrick- a steady supply of Mary Jane. Despite his warnings, my boss has been completely hands off since I started. Patrick has absolutely no interest in knowing how my nights go, as long as they’re peaceful and trespasser-free.

But tonight’s been different. It’s colder than usual, a sign that fall is almost upon us, and I’m mad at myself for forgetting to pack a hoodie. A fog is settling in amongst the trees, and for the first time, I’m almost unsettled to be out here alone. I shiver as I light my joint on the cabin’s front porch, leaving the door open behind me so I can still see the cam monitors. That’s when I hear it- a piercing shrieking sound from deep in the woods.

I run inside to check the monitors, but nothing’s in frame that I can see. Even indoors, I can still hear it. A fox? A dying deer? The sound leaves goosebumps down my neck, and I jump as my phone pings. A text from Patrick.

R THE BLINDS CLOSED?

I look to the open window behind me, showing me a moonlight hill and the beginning of the main path through the property. My car sits in the driveway in front of the house, but it’s too foggy to see much else.

My phone lights up again with another text.

U NEED TO CLOSE UR BLINDS OR IT WILL SEE U

What the fuck, Patrick? I text him back, “Ok. What are you talking about?” and get up to close the curtains over the cabin’s one window, pausing to look outside one final time. There’s nothing, but still, I’m uneasy. I relight my joint and take a good drag, nearly coughing up a lung, but immediately my muscles untense.

That’s when I see him- a tall, skinny man has walked into frame of one of the cams. He’s too far back to make any features out, and I can’t quite tell what he’s doing. He stands in the middle of the trail for a minute, totally still. I’m unnerved, but I have a job to do. Patrick was very clear- no trespassers. Despite my instincts telling me to stay inside, I sigh, slinging the rifle over one shoulder and grabbing the high powered flashlight I keep on my desk. To be completely honest, I’m just hoping having the gun on me is enough to scare this dude off- I have never shot anything in my life, let alone a gun that was probably used in, like, the Revolutionary War. When I look back one more time before leaving, the man is still there, still totally still in the middle of the gravel path, just staring.

This cam records a part of the trail that’s pretty close to the cabin, thankfully. It’s only about a 10 minute walk, and most of the path is through a large field that sits before the woods. I bring my joint with me- medicinal courage- and start my way down the slope into the clearing. I’m thinking this guy is probably one of the many homeless people in our town. I wasn’t the only one fired in the last year. In fact, when our shopping mall went completely under about 6 months ago, unemployment hit an all time high for our community. I’m sympathetic, but mostly I’m just hoping he’s gone by the time I get to the camera.

I’m practically shivering as I enter the forest- the temperature has dropped significantly since I started my night, and even in my long sleeve shirt, the air is bitingly frigid. The shrieking has stopped- in fact, it’s been eerily quiet since I left the cabin. I’m choosing to think of it as a good thing.

I see the light from the trail cam up ahead, and start looking around for the tall figure- he has to be just ahead of me now, if he’s still there at all. I make it to where the camera is mounted, but there’s no one in sight. I relax a little. Hopefully he’ll see himself off the property, and I can head back inside without anything else happening tonight. Then I notice- a paper, fluttering against the trunk of one of the trees a little further up the path. A flier? Or maybe a warning from Patrick? That could explain why the man’s gone, I guess. I head up to check it out.

It’s a hand written note, nailed to the tree.

HES WATCHING HES WATCHING HES WATCHING HES WATCHING

Nope. Nope nope nope. I turn around, hustling to get back to the cabin, behind a firmly locked door where I can wait for the sun to come up, and that’s when I notice- another note, closer to the edge of the forest, nailed to another tree. Did I miss it on my way in? Did someone put it up while I was checking out the trail cam? What the fuck?

HE SEES YOU HE SEES YOU

Is Patrick fucking with me? A punishment maybe, for smoking on the job? Whatever’s happening, I just want to get off this trail, now. I practically run through the clearing to get back, my flashlight bouncing in my hand and casting shadows all around me. The fog seems even thicker and I’m out of breath by the time I get back to the cabin. As I go to open the door, my heart practically jumps out of my chest, and I stop short, frozen on the front porch.

The curtains are wide open.

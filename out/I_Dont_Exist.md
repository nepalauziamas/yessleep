Well, that’s a misstatement. I walk, I talk, I eat, no other person or object can be in the same space as I am at the same time, I’m solid.


But according to the world that I hope this missive gets out to, I don’t. Never have.


Do you remember seeing all the Ukraine people in your world, that wouldn’t leave during the war? Because it’s their home. I feel the same way about my home. I never had a need for your crass, conflict-filled world where some people aren’t so lucky as to have a home, a place, like me.  It’s only my products that make it out there, and some of your money, that I need.



I hope I’m writing well, and using this odd glass paper-not-paper that’s always expanding no matter how much I have to say, right. Because I’m twenty-two, and never used a phone or computer before. My girlfriend taught me how writing with one works, and showed me a story she wrote earlier for a forum like this. If it seems like she wrote this one, well, she didn’t. It’s me, Faith, instead.



People in your world have two names. I think I must as well, but I don’t know my second. People in your world have…cards? And bits of paper they carry with them, so they can tell each other apart. I never needed that. Until now.



I don’t live in your world. Until I was a teenager, I believed the island *was* the world. In any case, I never had much time to think about what was beyond the lake until lately. Survival takes a lot of time, here.



My parents and I are the only ones on the island. See, the island was changed into something called a “national park” back when my great-grandfather was still alive. I don’t really know what that is, but the change meant that the community left, one by one, or were bought out generations ago.



But not our family. See, some people had built cabins on the island in the time before. And if you continue to pass the cabins down the family line, and actually live in and use them full-time, you can keep your home and scratch a living. Nothing has to change. That matters. A few years ago, my mom showed me a show about a nuclear accident. There was an old, old woman who refused to leave her home in Ukraine, even though it was radioactive. She tells a soldier “you’re not the first soldier to stand here with a gun and tell us to leave.” Then she recounts the history of that place, and how with war, famine, and revolution they never left. So why leave now because of some arbitrary order, for some reason she can’t see at all?



I had never felt that connected to a person in the screen before. My family and I so desperately want to keep our home. We do what we’ve always done.



Oops. You’re going to just think I’m some stupid peasant girl, right? That’s NOT TRUE! My parents lived in the world long enough to go to college, and my mom studied to be a teacher. I speak German, English, and a scattering of Ojibwe. I can write and do math, and I love to read when I have the time and the light. Mostly classic literature and stories of adventures in nature. I can’t relate to the rest of it all.



But mostly, I know about surviving. The Permit allows my family to be here, pass down the home, and do “subsistence farming, fishing, and logging.” Subsistence is to take what you need from the island, or so my mom says. But we’ve modernized, too. Solar panels. A wind turbine. Adding a storage cellar, a boat dock, a well, additional wood and propane stoves, and wiring up for enough electricity to have a refrigerator/freezer, washing machine in a shed hooked to the well, and a few hours of lights, especially in the winter. And then there’s the livestock. Two goats, six chickens, and the hives.



I milk the goats. I pick herbs. I sell the honey and homemade soap and candles from these things. Baskets from reeds. Beautiful woven rugs from animal skins and any cloth or clothing consigned to the rag bag. We don’t waste anything, here.



My mom teaches sailing and fishing, and in the winter does something in her office all day. My dad teaches survival skills and runs boot camps on the island in summer. That’s how I met my girlfriend. My parents don’t want me to interact too much with these people from your world, but I just can’t describe what I felt when I first saw her. This is her fourth summer on the island, and yesterday she talked to my dad. She even wants to live here, with me! We’ll want a child. We can keep the home for another generation. She wants a simple life.



To their credit, my parents don’t care that she’s a woman. But, they did say we can’t get married. I couldn’t think why. My girlfriend says that any two people can marry now, as long as they’re not related and old enough. You go into the world and they give you a bit of paper. Like the Permit.



But she said I needed another bit of paper, one with a second name and a photo (what is that?) to prove I am for sure me. What a stupid idea! I’m Faith, I know who I am.



I didn’t approach my mom, who was always the stricter one. Instead, I asked my dad for that paper of me. He sighed, knelt at my level, and said, “I’m sorry. But you don’t exist.”



What he said made no sense to either of us, and I haven’t been sleeping as I puzzle it over. So I thought I might put my situation in a place called “no sleep.”

No, I know what you're thinking, but this isnt an abduction story or a grainy photo of some light or something about area 51. No, this, I. I have trouble thinking about it, it gives me a certain kind of fear, fear of the unkown. So for context I work at SETI, the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence, an organization, as the name implies, that searches for extraterrestrial intelligence and we have been supported by NASA for a few decades now. And I work at a radio base im not even supposed to tell you the name of in the middle of Nevada. Now, the part where it gets interesting started about two weeks ago when I was finishing up some signal logs from the star,  Kepler-1649, and this star isnt too particularaly interesting besides that it may have a planet or two that has a breathable atmosphere, well, that was the most interesting thing until now.

Now these signal logs are just, radio recordings or signals emiting from the star or possibly a planet but it usually wasnt extrordinary it usually was just backround signal from the rotation of the star or said planet, but I got this signal, I call it the "hello signal" as, well, this signal, it-it.. It had what NASA and SETI would say is or may be proof of alien intelligence. As the signal is a repeating string of information that sounds like a beep, repeating every ten seconds that repeats every two hours, and, most extrordinary of all, i've pinpointed it's location to a specific planet,  Kepler-1649-J, a potentially habitable exoplanet that has thought to have an atmosphere and possibly has certain cemicals in its atmosphere that only life could produce, like fossil fuels or byproducts of machinery. Now, Im not exactly the best at deciphering signals and usually we would need a team of a bunch of people to decipher something like this, but it seems, rather easy? As if it was a simple signal from Earth, but, it isnt, I know that and it isnt on any frequncey humans use so, why is it so easy?

So I got to work, I eventually gathered some collegues that are experts in radio shit and stuff like that and are actually trained to decipher stuff like this if it ever happended. And so after about, a week and a half of deciphering and decoding, and with the help of some more specialist, we actually decoded, almost half the signal. And it looks to be a picture and some sort of numbers, like the ones we used on the golden record, they used hydrogen and oxeygen atoms as numbers or something like that I forget. But the thing most shocking about this picture, besides the fact that its grainy as hell and some spots are completly missing, one thing is mosterously clear, its a picture of a planet. The last half of the week we deciphered the last bit of the picture, but this side was, eerie to say the least, gut reanching to the say the most.

It apears to be numbers that directly correspond to a date, a human, date, like on a calender, and its only 5 years from now. I dont know who or what is coming, and what they might do, but one thing else that is what made me write this and why you haven't heard about it until now from the president, when I went to the higher ups in SETI about this they said to not worry about it **right now**, as in, worry about it later, perhaps as in 5 years from now later. Look up every once in a while for the next 5 years, see what you see.... you never know whats out there..

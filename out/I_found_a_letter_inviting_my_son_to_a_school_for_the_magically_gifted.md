"Jesus H. Christ, I am going to murder that boy." I tutted, surveying the absolute bombsite that was my son's bedroom.

Sheets dangled from the single bed in a messy knot and toys covered the floor in a layer so thick that it was impossible to tell there was a carpet underneath. I sighed, grabbed a trash bag, a duster, and my portable speaker, and got to work.

Progress was slow, but steady. A sizeable chunk of the cleaning was done by the time I slid open the top drawer of Terry's nightstand, and it was then that something caught my eye. Something that didn't quite fit.

Bright emerald ink stood out against the sea of clutter inside. Curious, I put aside my feather duster and shimmied free the poorly hidden envelope. I frowned down at it, studying the handwritten cursive at arms length.

*Terrance J. Walker,*

*for your eyes only.*

I perched on the end of Terry's bed, unfurled the envelope's contents and began to read.

*Dear Mr. Walker,*

*Please ensure you do not disclose the contents of this letter. These words are for you, and you alone.*

*Congratulations! You have been accepted into Bryce's Academy for the Magically Gifted, and will soon receive a visit from a representative of the school. This is an exciting opportunity; your world may be about to change. But do not take this decision lightly. Think long, and think hard. In time, friends and family will become nothing more than distant memories. Please ensure you fully understand what that entails before you make this choice. When your mind is made, use the enclosed pen to circle one of these two options:*

*I will attend Bryce's Academy for the Magically Gifted.*

*I will not attend Bryce's Academy for the Magically Gifted.*

*The date of collection will be 05/21/22, at 7:00PM.*

*We hope to see you then.*

I stared, dumbstruck, at the paper in my hands. There was a neat little circle drawn around the first option, and I felt a pang of sadness. Had I failed him so badly? Was my son so discontent with the life I gave him that he would actually consider something like this?

I scolded myself. Firstly, Terrance was an 11 year old boy, of course he would jump at any imagined opportunity of this nature. Second, there was an issue here far more pressing than my fragile parental ego. 

Some nutjob was planning to kidnap my child. *Today*. And not only that, but they'd even concocted this admittedly ingenious plan to have him go willingly. I lifted my eyes and scanned the room. 

There was a small plastic bag sitting in the corner, stuffed to the brim with clothes haphazardly tossed into it. The magenta sleeve of Terry's favourite shirt spilled over the top. That was a good sign, I thought. He wouldn't even spend the weekend at his father's without that shirt, so I knew he was at the very least planning to come home from school.

Unless, of course, the kidnapper intercepted him on his route. I thought it unlikely, given the bustling streets right now packed to the brim with witnesses, but decided that my first call should still be a quick one to Terrance. If the time given in the letter was to be trusted, I still had a few hours to have the authorities come over and spring a trap on that bastard. 

I let out a shout of surprise and my phone clattered to the floor as the paper resting in my lap surged with a sudden burst of heat. The emerald text had vanished, and new words were forming in its place in that same meticulous, looping handwriting. It was as if an invisible pen was gliding across the surface even as I watched. This time however, the words were inked in a vivid red.

*Dear Snooping Parent,*

*Due to this shocking breach of Terrance's privacy and subsequent exposure of the letter you are holding, you have left us with no choice but to go forth with our eradication method of extraction.*

*The representative will be with you presently.*

My mind was blank. I knew it had to be some complex trick, but for the life of me I couldn't fathom what was behind the curtain.

"Mom?"

Terry stood in the open doorway, school packpack slung over his shoulder. I hadn't even heard the front door open. His eyes were fixed on the letter in my hands. "Where did you find that?" 

Anger, fear, relief and confusion swirled inside me like a bubbling vortex; but all I wanted to do was wrap him tight in my arms and tell him that everything was going to be okay. That no one was taking him *anywhere*. 

I never got that chance.

A deafening blast echoed through the house and my hands clapped over my ears instinctively. Terrance did the same, falling hard against the doorframe as the ground quaked beneath us. An uncomfortable sensation played across my skin, and then I felt the air disappear from the very space around me. 

I closed my eyes tight against the force that threatened to pluck my eyes from their sockets, and tried to crawl my way over to Terrance. 

"Terry!" My voice filled my head, but it didn't leave my lips. "Baby, where are you?"  

Eventually, my fingers latched onto something. Some kind of crispy fabric that reminded me of a sofa singed with cigarette burns.

"Terry?" I tried to ask again.

Something struck me hard across the face and I felt my nose flatten. I fell to my elbows, the metallic taste of blood gushing into my mouth, and realised I could breathe again. I opened my eyes and immediately wished I hadn't.

Terrance was sobbing quietly beside me, but a new figure had taken residence in the doorway. 

He was cloaked in a tattered mess of ceremonial robes, and a wiry excuse for a beard poked out under a faded blue hood. His dull, gray eyes bore into my own and I scrambled away until my back hit the wall.

I could forgive the clothes, the beard, the eyes... But I couldn't look past that mouth. 

Really, it wasn't much of a mouth. It felt wrong to refer to it as such. Rather, it was a jagged black hole where a mouth should have been. His breath rattled within withered lungs, and his entire being shuddered as he raised a hand that resembled a white raisin.

An invisible force tightened around my neck and the bottoms of my feet lost contact with the carpet. The man inhaled once more, as if to mock my inability to do so, and I felt that familiar sensation of the air vanishing once again.

I winced and cowered and cried, but was unable to scream as I felt my bones bend with a sudden tension. My legs were the first to give out. They splintered and snapped while the man stared up at me unmoving from his spot and pointed, expression entirely unchanged. A sickening pop squelched in one of my hips and all I could do to vent my anguish was pound my fists uselessly against the wall. 

Most painful by far, though, were my lungs. I never knew how painful it could be to be physically incapable of filling your lungs with air. 

The colour had begun to fade from the world, but despite the agony I clung to life with everything I had. I couldn't die yet. That wasn't allowed. What kind of mother could rest peacefully in the next world knowing that they surrendered their only child to a monster such as this? 

But what choice did I have? I had nothing. No weapon, no words, no semblance of an idea to get Terrance out of this safely.

A salty tear fell from my cheek as my left arm snapped and a shower of hot crimson sprayed the room. The pressure tightened around my neck and it felt as though my head was swelling like a balloon. Everything went black, and my final thoughts were only of Terrance. Of how sorry I was.

\-\-\-

"-her alone!" 

My eyelids fluttered open. I lay in a heap of my own mangled limbs, and looked up at my son's quivering back. He seemed to have inserted himself between the representative and I. 

"You came here for me, right?" His voice trembled something fierce, but to me, no one had ever sounded braver. "Well I'm not going anywhere if you hurt my mom again!" 

A terrible screech shook the fragments of my bones and the room quaked once again as the horrible being approached Terrance's tiny frame. I could only watch and reach helplessly with my one good arm as it gazed down into his eyes, seeming to consider him.

For a moment, the pair stood just like that. Then the next, bony fingers curled over Terry's shoulder, gripping his sweatshirt tight. 

My son turned to look at me for the last time. I wanted to beg and plead with the monster to leave him be. To take me instead. But as I worked my jaw frantically, the words wouldn't form and I barely managed a croak. 

Terrance didn't give me a reassuring smile. Nor a thumbs up signalling that everything was going to be okay. No. The last thing I saw was the abject fear etched plain on his face and the horrible, gaping maw of the thing that stepped up beside him. 

There was a blinding flash of light, and they were gone.

\-\-\-

I was in a hospital bed, covered from head to toe in a mix of tightly wrapped bandages and hard cast. It felt like burning knives were twisting in the cracks left in my bones, but the doctors seemed to have done a decent job of setting them as far as I could tell. They weren't sticking out at acute angles anymore, at least. A man in blue scrubs stopped by shortly after I awoke to update me on my condition with a fixed, somber expression.

Apparently, half the neighborhood had heard the 'explosion'. The emergency services had been contacted by about a dozen different people. It was owed to that fact that I was still alive. 

My limbs would take some time to heal, but I should eventually regain full mobility with minimal discomfort. Aided, of course, by a metric tonne of pain medication. I'd also received a blood transfusion and my nose had to be reconstructed. When he opened his mouth again and began to say something grim about my orbital bone, I held up the hand I could move to silence him.

"Terrance," I wheezed. "Where's my son?" 

He shifted uncomfortably.

"Ma'am, the investigation is still ongoing. I don't believe I'm at liberty to comment. Give me a moment to fetch someone who can." 

The somber doctor returned just a few moments later with a rather disheveled companion at his side.

"Leave us," said the newcomer. "And you," he gestured to me as the door clicked shut. "Tell me everything that happened. Leave nothing out."

"You wouldn't believe me if I did."

He rolled a chair to my bedside and slid a blank piece of paper from inside his jacket, holding it up for me to see.

"Try me."

\-\-\-

As I write this, it's been two months to the day that Terrance was taken. The detective has inspired fresh hope in me that my boy isn't necessarily lost forever. Without that little glimmer of light at the end of this pitch-black tunnel, I don't know how I would have gotten through the hellish process of recovery. 

Everything still burns fresh in my mind, and I replay the memories on a never-ending loop. I search every day in any way I can, and am in constant contact with the detective heading the case. Whenever a lead runs dry, the aches and pains and empty house keep me resolute in what I have to do. There is no giving up, this is all there is.

I will find Terrance, and I will bring him home.

I won't fail him again.

I would do it every night. It didn't matter if it was humid or frigid. I sat out on the porch of the house my grandfather built and pour two shots of whiskey. My eyes often stared into the woods that surrounded my house. I had done it for years as I would sit in my favorite chair with my rifle leaned against the wall. I always found the sound of critters and bugs relaxing. It was around this time that I did my nightly ritual of pouring two shots of whiskey and placed them on the table my grandfather had built.

I never got to meet him in person. My Dad told me his old man was a strange fellow, but he was talented as I looked down to see his craftsmanship. A solid oak table that he engraved by hand. It had different words that a simple country boy couldn’t pronounce, and symbols I had seen nowhere else.  The way my Dad talked about him before he himself passed I would have liked him.

I lifted the first glass and drank it. The shot of a stiff drink burned as it went down my throat, leaving that little tingle in my chest. I heard the crickets chirp and closed my eyes soaking in the hot summer night until I could hear a faint growl at my feet.

"What is it, Mae?” I asked as my eyes looked down the red nose Pitbull that lied at my feet. She was a good dog and often sat outside with me. Some fool had left her on the edge of my property two years back. The one thing that the people in Cullman knew about me was that I could be a sucker for big dumb dogs. My luck hasn’t always been the best with them, though. They always end up disappearing in the woods and never coming back.

My friend Eugene always told me I needed to do something about those damn coyotes that keep getting my pets, but I knew the truth. It wasn't those scavengers that kept picking off my dogs. “You can smell’em, can’t you, girl?” I asked as I rubbed behind her ear.

I stood up from my chair and grabbed my rifle walking to the edge of the porch to see the treeline swaying as I could hear Mae whine behind me. I aimed the sights at the trees in the distance, while waited for those bastards to show themselves. It was a game of patience now. The sound of branches snapping echoed from the distance as I rested my finger on the trigger.

“Come on out here, boys, this is private property, and I got my Winny waitin’ for ya!’” I yelled hoping it was just another pair of dumb teens. They loved to come around at night sometimes. It was a dumb legend around here that my family land is haunted. It started when my Grandfather got torn apart in his own damn yard.

The legend goes that his ghost wanders the yard screaming and looking for his limbs that got torn off. It’s bullshit, honestly. I’ve never heard my ancestor screaming around the house. “Last chance, to show yourself, or I will start shootin’ that way!” I shouted my last warning.

Mae began to bark aggressively, and I fired off a shot into the woods.  The sound of a painful roar came soon after. I knew then it wasn’t any of the dumb boys from town. I cocked my rifle again and gripped it tightly waiting for them.

It had been a while since they showed themselves.

The three figures stepped out from trees and stared at me with their piercing hollow eyes. It had been almost six months since I had last seen the large gray-skinned beasts lumbering into my yard. It was time to get inside as I turned to my dog. “All right, Mae, let’s get inside,” I called as I patted my leg.

I stepped back and headed to the front door opening it. I could hear the creatures as I turned to see them moving quickly to the two of us. The dog quickly shuffled inside. I quickly followed and closed the front door keeping my rifle pointed at it as I waited for them to try to come inside.

The sound of their growls echoed around the house as their footsteps circled the place my grandfather had built. Mae continued to bark loudly. The dog hated the damn things more than I did. The roar pierced my eardrums, and then it was silent. I placed my finger on the trigger and waited for their next move. The next noise left me with the feeling of dread. It wasn’t another growl, nor footsteps that I could hear. It was much worse.

It was the wind, blowing inside my house.

I turned and quickly ran to the kitchen and knew that tonight differed from the others. The back door was wide open, blowing the night’s air into the house.

"Shit."

The sound of floor creaked from within as I could hear the dog barking furiously now. The steps were heavy as I followed them and began walking around each room. The bastards were becoming more clever and were coming up with strategies instead charging aimlessly as they had before.

“Mae, where are ya, girl?” I whispered while looking for my canine companion. My eyes scanned every corner as I tried to tread carefully and lightly through my home. The heavy creaks continued as I headed down the hall to the bedroom. That was Mae’s safe place where she would hide. I pushed open the door and paused. I could hear it as the footsteps rushed towards me.

I quickly turned around and let another gunshot, as my ears began to ring, I felt something else. The warm feeling of my blood dripping down my arm as my eyes saw the teeth sink into my shoulder. It released me briefly before it overpowered me and pushed my body into the wall. The feeling of my ribs cracking as it pressed on to me tightly. It snarled as I felt its hot breath on my face.

The beast screamed in agony as I saw the glimmer of a blade lunge into its back. I buckled as its paws released me and I fell to the ground from the pain of my ribs.  The monster wailed again as I could see the knife cut across its chest. “It’s about goddamn time you showed up!” I coughed.

I looked to see a man, one that I had only ever seen in pictures and heard stories about. He stood in between me and the creature as he cut the creature one last time before it had lost its courage and fled. I struggled to stand as he began to walk towards the front room. “They are growing in the numbers,” he said

“They are getting smarter too, Granddad,” I said as I watched him walk onto the front porch staring down the four beasts that stood frozen in my yard. He paused for a moment before looking at the shot of the whiskey and turning it to his lips. He wiped his face as the creatures began to turn and walk back into the woods.  I looked their direction for a brief moment to watch their retreat before turning back to the two empty glasses. He was gone again without saying a word to me.

I walked over to the table, pouring another shot of whiskey. My grandfather had worked hard tonight and saved my ass. He deserved another [offering](https://reddit.com/r/czarcarcosa).

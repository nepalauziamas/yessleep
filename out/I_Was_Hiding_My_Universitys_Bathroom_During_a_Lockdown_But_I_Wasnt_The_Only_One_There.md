 

There is too much to explain at the moment, but let me give you a brief introduction about myself. I’m an exchange student who came from China to Vancouver. I’m 18 and I’m currently studying architecture, the city is very beautiful, but running into homeless people is one of the problems in the city since they will beg the fuck outta you just for a few cents. I lived a fairly normal life, and have a good family, and had lots of friends over in China. I am writing this in a rush because there's something that is happening in my bathroom right now. 

Just a couple of weeks ago, my campus had a school shooter which means that we had to go into lockdown mode; where you know, people in classrooms hide under the tables and people in the washroom just sit there and pray. I was one of the guys who were stuck in the washroom by myself. The campus wasn’t the cleanest which is probably one of the reasons why not many people go there. As the lockdown began, all the lights in the facility were turned off as well as the one in the bathrooms, red flag. It was then that I realized that I forgot my phone in the lecture room, shit. Obviously, there is no way that I’m going outside since I don’t know if the shooter is still out there, so I just chilled there. I was there for a minute or two when I heard water dripping, not just anywhere in the facility, but on the floor of the bathroom. I didn’t really care since like I said before, the facility is shit. Not much happened for the next five or so minutes. What happened next fucked me up real good, the light outside the bathroom turned on for about 5 seconds, and as I stared at the bathroom stalls, the light coming from under the door illuminated a pair of wet feet in the stalls. It knows I’m here and so do I. I was too scared to scream and just stared at the bottom of the stall after the light turned off and left me frozen in the darkness. There was literally nothing I can do but just wait for the police to show up and burst out of the bathroom. As it gets more quiet and dark, I could hear the breathing of the thing inside the bathroom. I couldn’t really make up the height of the thing since the stall went all the way up the ceiling. Just then, I heard the stall door opening, I lost it. 

As I was about to storm out of the bathroom I see a pair of shoes at the door of the bathroom, it was the shooter but, it seems to be looking in the other direction not really looking in the direction of the bathroom. I can hear the thing crawling up the walls and heard one of the tiles on the ceiling shut. It is no longer in the bathroom which brings me a ton of relief, but I start to wonder why it hadn’t attacked me. I can hear the police sirens, it’s finally over. A few minutes later, the lights in the school turned on except the bathroom lights. I reached for the light switch but another hand was there. It had come from the ceiling, as I look up I can see the silhouette of the thing staring down at me. I screamed as loud as I can and it went back up the ceiling slamming the tiles, I bolted out of the bathroom and back to my lecture room, picked up my phone ran to the police who were still at the entrance of the facility. 

They did a search through the ceilings and the bathroom but found nothing, not even a trace or footprint, and told me to get some rest. I stopped going to my university and had to go back to China where I am now telling this experience to you guys. Whatever was in that bathroom that day, was definitely not human and I’m just glad that I’m with my parents, but recently water started dripping from my bathroom in the apartment, you guys might just ask if it’s just some drainage problem. But the thing is, I live on the top r/floor

&#x200B;

Hello, everyone, it’s Roy. I’m writing this for Neil who I’m sad to say along with Kelly, is no longer alive. I’ll get to how I came to be the one writing this. For now, I’ll explain what happened. The day after they came over, I called my friend, Will. He’s for a lack of a better word, a bit of a gun nut. I didn’t explain the whole truth. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I told him it would be for a hunting trip and convinced him to give them a good deal. He tends to sell more under the table if you catch my drift, so they were able to stock up for relatively cheap. The next thing they needed was some aiming practice. Will helped with this as well.  He let them shoot targets at his place.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Initially, I wanted my conversation with Kelly and Neil to be the most involvement I gave. I should have known the moment I agreed to the interview, that it wouldn’t end there. Marty’s death has haunted me for years and closure is something I’ve been needing. I’d be lying if I said I haven’t thought of doing what Kelly and Neil did, going over there guns blazing, and trying to lay waste to that nightmare. If I did that, though, my parents would just end up losing another son.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

What that did to my family is something I could never willingly put them through again. I can only imagine what Kelly’s and Neil’s are going through right now. I tried to warn them. I really did. I told them that whatever they were planning on using against that thing, it would probably not work. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

There’s something that anger can do to rationality to make you disregard it completely.  While this can certainly be admirable in some instances, it can also be, no sugarcoating it here, incredibly stupid or maybe I’m just secretly a coward or it could be both.  In any case, at least there’s someone here who can tell their story. My week was pretty busy so I tried to keep my mind occupied with work while they prepared.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

From here on out in this post, I’ll be sharing the last conversation I had with Neil in his hospital room.

&#x200B;

“It took us a while to find the tree you mentioned. I’ve never thing anything like it. Did you know it still looks the same?”

&#x200B;

“Really?”

&#x200B;

“Yeah,  no rot at all. We took a closer look at it and discovered a hole in the center.”

&#x200B;

“Where it lived?”

&#x200B;

“That’s right. It went deep. We thought it might so we brought some rope with us. There were tunnels down there, big ones.”

&#x200B;

“Made by it?”

&#x200B;

“Probably. The floor was wet.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

The way he said that made me tense up. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“With what?”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Tears flowed down Neil’s face.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Blood. Oh god,  there was a kid’s shoe wedged under the wall.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

A chill ran through me.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“What kind of shoe?” I asked.

&#x200B;

“It was a blue sneaker with purple stars drawn on.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

That confirmed it.  Something I didn’t mention in my interview with them was that when they found Marty, his shoes were missing.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Why do you ask?”

&#x200B;

“No reason.”

&#x200B;

My throat felt dry.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“I won’t lie. Part of me wanted to turn back, but I knew if I did, I’d regret it for the rest of my life, not that I have much of it left anyway.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Neil gave a humorless chuckle.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“That place was a lot bigger than we thought. We followed the trail and came to its home. There were bones everywhere and things it collected over the years. If it means anything, we found another shoe like the one I mentioned earlier.”

&#x200B;

“Was it waiting for you?”

&#x200B;

“No, it was asleep on all its…Souvenirs. “

&#x200B;

“What did it look like?”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

An expression of confusion came over Neil.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“It’s hard to explain.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

He described it as appearing humanoid with pale crawling scales running up and down its body. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Did you know it snores?”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

He said that in such a detached way as if we were chatting about the weather.  He turned away from me to stare up at the ceiling.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“It was the moment of truth for us.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Kelly signaled to Neil and they both got their guns ready, shotguns in particular. The creature’s mouth was open. Slowly, they cocked their weapons. As I listened, my grip on my chair’s armrests tightened.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“She was the first one to fire at it. She put the barrel of her gun in its mouth and fired.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

The cave shook and for a moment, he was afraid the cave would collapse on him. He fired next and both unloaded into it. Despite this, there was no blood and that’s when they knew they were in serious trouble. Now awake, it rose and took notice of them.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“It’s not often my meals come to me.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

It eyed them with delighted hunger like a child who’d received an early Christmas present.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“You killed my boyfriend,” Kelly told it.

&#x200B;

“And my best friend,” Neil coldly added.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

It only smiled.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“And you two are next.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

It moved fast, knocking them both away with a single clawed arm. They flew back, hitting the cave wall.  Now it was taller. Its eyes were coal-black akin to a starving shark’s. Kelly and Neil were shaking.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“What’s wrong?”  it taunted. “Aren’t you going to fight back? It’s not as fun if you don’t.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

They knew then no weapons would work on it. Their only option was to trap it. They’d bought something to do exactly that. It was their last resort, two hand grenades. What they wanted to do was toss knock it back with some more rounds, toss the grenades in, and then escape while the cave was crumbling. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

At first, this seemed to work.  They were able to drive it back and Neil pulled the pin on his grenade and tossed it first. The resulting explosion made debris fall from the cave ceiling. Realizing what they were up to, it retaliated.  As Kelly was about to toss hers, a clawed arm shot from the darkness. There wasn’t any time for her to react.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

The claws impaled her, pinning her against the wall. Neil screamed as the grenade fell from her hands and rolled to him. She could only say one last thing to him.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Run.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

He grabbed the grenade and did exactly that. He fled., feeling equal parts fear and shame. They’d failed. That’s all there was to it and now he needed to get out of there.  He came to the exit and scrambled up the rope. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

He was halfway up it when he heard a shrieking rattle below him.  Sharp tendrils were coming out of the shapeshifter’s back. It was using them to climb up the walls toward Neil.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“How did you escape?”

&#x200B;

“Luck. I was almost out of there when I felt it grab me. Those claws were so painful.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

He only had one hope. Struggling, he pulled the pin from the grenade and then tossed it down.  The boom from it caused the rest of the cave to crumble. While that thing was strong, the force of it caused it to let go of Neil and fall back into the darkness below. I happened to be driving through there.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I wouldn’t usually be. However, work was hell that day and I needed a shortcut home. My heart nearly stopped when a blood-covered Neil ran in front of my truck. I slammed on the breaks and came to a stop inches from him. By the time I got out, he’d already collapsed. There was already a good idea in my mind of what happened, but the details could wait.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

He was badly injured so I drove him to the hospital and luckily, they were able to help. Although, not for long.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“I’m sorry,” I told him.

&#x200B;

“Yeah, it’s not dead you know. It’ll be after me next.”

&#x200B;

“I could see about getting you out of here then.”

&#x200B;

“No, it won’t do any good. I can’t escape it in this condition.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I didn’t know what else to say.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“You should go. It won’t be long before it gets here. At least I won’t be far behind Kelly and Jake.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

He made a noise that I think was a cross between laughing and sobbing. It was harrowing to see and I knew this was a man whose mind was gone. Since there wasn’t anything that I could do for him, I left. The next day his death was reported on the local news and so was that cave collapse. Workers haven’t found anything in it which makes me think that it’s moved on.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

 That’s some good news I suppose, at least for this area. I don’t want to think about what it’ll be like for the next place it decides to make its home, though. All I can say is if you’ve noticed anything similar to Neil’s posts or this one, move far away and I hope that one day that thing will finally [meet](https://www.reddit.com/r/StoriesFromRose/) its [end.](https://twitter.com/RoseBlack2222)
